00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:27.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:29.236 A:middle
Welcome to WC 2016.

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:33.006 A:middle
Quite a bit has happened
since we met about a year ago.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.776 A:middle
With the addition of tvOS, then
our four Apple OS platforms,

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:39.336 A:middle
a lot of them with
their own app store,

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.816 A:middle
and all our platforms
are optimized

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:43.596 A:middle
for their own unique
experiences.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.246 A:middle
But they share a tremendous
amount of common technologies

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.506 A:middle
and APIs, making it easy
for you to bring your apps

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:50.966 A:middle
to all four platforms

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:55.316 A:middle
by leveraging the individual
character at the same time.

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:58.296 A:middle
Our expert tool chain is the
same for all four platforms.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.436 A:middle
They share most of their
frameworks and libraries,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.436 A:middle
They share most of their
frameworks and libraries,

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.096 A:middle
and the underlying
programming concepts

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.306 A:middle
and programming languages
are the same as well.

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:11.446 A:middle
And today we are announcing a
ton of new APIs and technologies

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.306 A:middle
that you'll be able
to take advantage of.

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:16.186 A:middle
You'll find many more ways
to express your ideas,

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:18.346 A:middle
and you'll be able to
target even more users

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.266 A:middle
in even more markets.

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:24.706 A:middle
Our iOS X in particular is
huge this year for developers.

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:27.856 A:middle
In fact, if you take a
look at the iOS at least

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:30.156 A:middle
that we announced this morning,
you'll find that we are opening

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.526 A:middle
up pretty much the entire user
experience of iOS to developers,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.416 A:middle
covering everything from
notifications to Phone,

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:38.486 A:middle
Messages, Maps, and even Siri.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:43.586 A:middle
An important concept that we use
to achieve that is extensions,

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:45.626 A:middle
and you might remember that
we introduced extensions two

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:46.196 A:middle
years ago.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:49.536 A:middle
They represent an increasingly
important mechanism for us

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:51.726 A:middle
because they allow you to
branch out from your apps

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:54.486 A:middle
and to participate in
our system functionality.

00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:58.156 A:middle
They allow you to
securely customize our OS's

00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:00.986 A:middle
by running short-lived
sandboxed services


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:00.986 A:middle
by running short-lived
sandboxed services

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:02.536 A:middle
that are launched on demand.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:07.316 A:middle
Our shipping products already
support a broad variety

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:10.286 A:middle
of extension points, and we're
adding many more this year,

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.836 A:middle
allowing you to hook even
deeper into our OS's and apps.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.436 A:middle
Perhaps the most exciting
new extension point is

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.826 A:middle
for creating iMessage Apps.

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:20.206 A:middle
And to tell you all about it,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.546 A:middle
I'm going to hand
over to Darin Adler.

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:29.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:32.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I'm having a great
time with the new Messages,

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:34.886 A:middle
and I hope you all will too.

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:38.006 A:middle
iMessage Apps are how you
can be a part of that.

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:42.236 A:middle
Now, as Andreas mentioned,
iMessage Apps are extensions,

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.136 A:middle
and that means that like other
extensions, you can include them

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.496 A:middle
in your apps on the App Store.

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:50.006 A:middle
But with iMessage Apps,
there's another option as well.

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:52.286 A:middle
You can include them in
the iMessage App Store,

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:54.436 A:middle
which you get at right
from inside Messages.

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:57.846 A:middle
Looks like this.

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:04.106 A:middle
Now, when you send interactive
messages with your iMessage App,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:04.106 A:middle
Now, when you send interactive
messages with your iMessage App,

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:09.306 A:middle
you'll have the icon of
the app up in the corner,

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:12.126 A:middle
but even more importantly,
if the person you send

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
that interactive message to
doesn't have the app yet,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:19.156 A:middle
they'll have this link that
says, "Get a name of app."

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:20.646 A:middle
If you tap on that link.

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:23.566 A:middle
That takes you right to
getting or buying the app,

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:27.536 A:middle
so it's an amazing way to have
your customers spread your app

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:29.186 A:middle
from one person to another.

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
Now, if you're building
a Sticker Pack App,

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:33.896 A:middle
it's really simple.

00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:35.156 A:middle
There's no coding required.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.836 A:middle
You just take all of the
graphics for the icons

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.506 A:middle
for the app, the
graphics for the stickers,

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:44.106 A:middle
put them into Xcode, build, and
then submit to iTunes Connect.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:48.006 A:middle
If you want to make a
more sophisticated app

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.036 A:middle
and take advantage of all
the power in iMessage Apps,

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:54.986 A:middle
you program with Swift
and use UIKit just

00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:56.166 A:middle
like with other extensions.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.536 A:middle
And there's a new
Messages extension point.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:02.856 A:middle
The classes in this Messages
extension point give you access


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:02.856 A:middle
The classes in this Messages
extension point give you access

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.056 A:middle
to everything you need
inside the Messages App.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.916 A:middle
So there's an object
representing a message

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:08.706 A:middle
that you send.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:11.366 A:middle
There's an object representing
the whole conversation the

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:12.286 A:middle
message is part of.

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:14.296 A:middle
There's even an object
representing a thing called a

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:17.236 A:middle
session, which lets you
group messages together,

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:20.616 A:middle
and it's a really great way to
do collaborative iMessage Apps.

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:26.466 A:middle
Now, all of this is done
without compromising the privacy

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.926 A:middle
that Messages is famous for.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:31.566 A:middle
Your app doesn't have
any access to anything

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.816 A:middle
in the conversation outside of
what's being done with the app,

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:39.456 A:middle
and if, it doesn't even
necessarily know who's involved,

00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:44.886 A:middle
who you're sending to, so that
helps keep the privacy intact.

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:49.506 A:middle
Now, adaptive design
is important

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.246 A:middle
to any iOS app development,

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.616 A:middle
and it's even more
important for iMessage Apps.

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:59.566 A:middle
That's because Messages runs in
all the different kinds of sizes

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.886 A:middle
and shapes of devices
and all the adaptations.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.886 A:middle
and shapes of devices
and all the adaptations.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:05.886 A:middle
And so it runs on iPad, it runs
on iPhone, it runs in slide

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:07.926 A:middle
over an iPad, portrait
and landscape,

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:10.916 A:middle
and so your iMessage
Apps need to too.

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:13.556 A:middle
But there's one additional
wrinkle for iMessage Apps,

00:05:13.616 --> 00:05:16.956 A:middle
which is that they run in this
Compact Mode down at the bottom

00:05:16.956 --> 00:05:18.836 A:middle
of the screen where the
keyboard is and you can slide

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.616 A:middle
between them or you
can take that same app

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:24.086 A:middle
and expand it to its full size.

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:24.956 A:middle
Sometimes the app will do it.

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:26.406 A:middle
Sometimes the user will do it.

00:05:26.406 --> 00:05:28.586 A:middle
Adaptive design is
very important

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:30.066 A:middle
to that experience as well.

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:34.886 A:middle
Everything you need to develop
iMessage Apps is available,

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:36.356 A:middle
and so you can really start now.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:39.906 A:middle
The SDK has all the things
I talked about everything

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.466 A:middle
from the Messages
extension point.

00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:45.806 A:middle
And the simulator even
has a new, special version

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:49.196 A:middle
of Messages just for developers
that lets you see both sides

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:52.796 A:middle
of a conversation and try
out your iMessage Apps

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:54.376 A:middle
to see how they're
both sent and received.

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:59.976 A:middle
And now Adele Peterson
will show you how all

00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:01.946 A:middle
of this comes together in iOS X.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Darin.

00:06:09.716 --> 00:06:10.546 A:middle
As you saw this morning,

00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:13.166 A:middle
our friends at Disney have
made some awesome stickers,

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:14.806 A:middle
so I'm going to show
you how they did it

00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:18.326 A:middle
by putting together a
sticker app in Xcode.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:19.556 A:middle
Now, this only takes a minute,

00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:22.116 A:middle
so even though I'm
starting a new project,

00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:22.896 A:middle
I'm actually almost done.

00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:25.506 A:middle
I'm going to start by
selecting the Sticker Pack

00:06:25.506 --> 00:06:26.396 A:middle
application template.

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:31.956 A:middle
I'll give it a good name
like Star Wars, save it,

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:34.976 A:middle
and I'll select the
Stickers Asset Catalog.

00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:38.826 A:middle
Now, I want my stickers to have
a great icon when I look at them

00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:40.836 A:middle
in the Messages app
drawer, so I'll start

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:43.156 A:middle
by dragging in my icons.

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:47.456 A:middle
And now I can select my sticker
pack and drag my stickers in.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:50.306 A:middle
Okay, let's give that a try.

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:54.076 A:middle
Now that Messages is in the
simulator, it will be easy

00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:57.816 A:middle
for you to try out your
stickers in iMessage Apps.

00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:02.536 A:middle

So I can test out sending one
and I can even test out peeling

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:12.476 A:middle
and dragging a sticker
onto another message.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.396 A:middle
Now onto iMessage Apps.

00:07:27.736 --> 00:07:32.066 A:middle
So I've got this ice cream app
here, and my daughter's really

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:33.856 A:middle
into these kinds of
apps that let her design

00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:36.696 A:middle
and create things, so I'm
making an iMessage App for her

00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:38.946 A:middle
to build ice cream
stickers with her friends.

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:41.006 A:middle
So here in the Compact View,

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:43.506 A:middle
you have the completed
ice cream stickers,

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:46.016 A:middle
and when I tap the
plus, the app expands

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:48.916 A:middle
and shows the ice
cream building UI.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.156 A:middle
So I'm going to select a
cone here and start this off.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:54.916 A:middle
So I'm going to select
it and send.

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:59.006 A:middle
So now the simulator shows both
the sender and receiver sides

to use two iOS devices to
test your iMessage App.

Let's look at it from the

launch the app, add some scoops,

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:19.616 A:middle
and send it back to John.

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:22.216 A:middle
And then on the other side

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:25.436 A:middle
of the conversation,
you receive this.

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.616 A:middle
You tap the message,
you add a topping,

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:32.186 A:middle
and send it back to Kate.

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:34.086 A:middle
Now, as delicious
as this all looks,

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:36.666 A:middle
I don't really want my entire
conversation to be filled

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:38.746 A:middle
with these partially
built ice cream cones.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.956 A:middle
There's actually a much
cleaner way to build this kind

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.236 A:middle
of collaborative iMessage App.

00:08:43.436 --> 00:08:45.696 A:middle
If I use the same MS session
for each of those messages,

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:47.566 A:middle
then the earlier steps

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:49.276 A:middle
of building ice cream
will be replaced

00:08:49.276 --> 00:08:52.396 A:middle
by concise descriptions, and
you'll only see the later,

00:08:52.646 --> 00:08:54.006 A:middle
the latest ice cream message.

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:55.946 A:middle
So I'm going to make
that change in Xcode

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.146 A:middle
and show you how it looks.

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
So let me switch over to
the ice cream project.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
So let me switch over to
the ice cream project.

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:03.126 A:middle
Let's see.

00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:06.516 A:middle
Okay, so here's the
part of my code

00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:08.246 A:middle
that creates the
MS message object.

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:12.796 A:middle
I'm going to drag in -- oops --
I'm going to drag in this code.

00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:15.816 A:middle
This code looks to see

00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:17.856 A:middle
if there's a selected
message in the conversation.

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:19.696 A:middle
That's what you get when
you tap that message

00:09:19.696 --> 00:09:21.456 A:middle
and it launches the
app full screen.

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:23.296 A:middle
So if there is a
selected message,

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.386 A:middle
we'll use the session
associated with that message,

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:27.846 A:middle
and if there isn't, we'll
pass in a fresh MS session.

00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:33.636 A:middle
So let's give that a try.

00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:38.186 A:middle
Okay, so now we'll
launch this app again.

00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:43.816 A:middle
We'll tap the Plus button,
select a cone, send it to Kate,

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:53.986 A:middle
add some toppings, send it back
to John, and then finish it off,

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:56.656 A:middle
and send it back to Kate.

00:09:56.656 --> 00:10:00.426 A:middle
So now you can see those
descriptions describing the


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:56.656 --> 00:10:00.426 A:middle
So now you can see those
descriptions describing the

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:01.536 A:middle
earlier steps of the process,

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:03.786 A:middle
and you no longer have those
partially built ice creams

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.036 A:middle
sitting on top of
the finished product.

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:07.606 A:middle
And that is a little taste

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:10.166 A:middle
of what you can do
with iMessage Apps.

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.616 A:middle
Next up, Robby Walker
to tell you about Siri.

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:17.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:18.046 --> 00:10:18.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Adele.

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:23.466 A:middle
Five years ago, we
announced Siri,

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:26.006 A:middle
the intelligent assistant
for iPhone.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.456 A:middle
Since then, Siri has spoken

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:30.466 A:middle
to people hundreds
of billions of times.

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:34.106 A:middle
As of today, Siri is now
available on five classes

00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:37.776 A:middle
of devices and in a
whopping 36 locales.

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:42.576 A:middle
Siri also has many new features
and an improved core experience.

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:47.056 A:middle
One cool example, on
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus,

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:49.776 A:middle
you can start talking to Siri
the instant you press the Home

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:52.726 A:middle
button with literally zero
milliseconds of latency thanks

00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:53.896 A:middle
to an amazing collaboration

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:55.286 A:middle
between our hardware
and software teams.

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.236 A:middle
But of course, until today,

00:10:58.236 --> 00:11:00.966 A:middle
something really important has
been missing, and that's apps,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.236 --> 00:11:00.966 A:middle
something really important has
been missing, and that's apps,

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:03.646 A:middle
so we're so excited to
launch the first version

00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:05.376 A:middle
of SiriKit on iOS.

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:12.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:13.336 --> 00:11:15.146 A:middle
We believe the best
experience for people is

00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:17.966 A:middle
to use the apps they love,
the apps you all have created,

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.666 A:middle
and with SiriKit, people
will now be able to interact

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.086 A:middle
with those applications in
a new, conversational way.

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.246 A:middle
I'm going to talk about how
your application will work

00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:28.926 A:middle
with SiriKit to provide a great,
conversational experience.

00:11:29.576 --> 00:11:33.996 A:middle
The first thing Siri does is
understand what the user said,

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:36.036 A:middle
taking audio and
turning it into text.

00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:39.916 A:middle
Then, Siri understands what the
user means, taking that text

00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:41.996 A:middle
and turning it into
what we call an intent.

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:46.306 A:middle
Based off that, on that
intent, Siri then takes action

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:49.376 A:middle
and provides responses,
both visual and verbal.

00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:52.386 A:middle
Your application will
provide three things.

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:55.546 A:middle
The first is vocabulary to
aid in Siri's understanding.

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:58.266 A:middle
The second is your app logic,
your core functionality,

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
and of course, a
great user interface.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
and of course, a
great user interface.

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:04.736 A:middle
Now, we designed SiriKit so that
Siri handles the conversation

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.776 A:middle
and your application
handles the functionality.

00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:09.906 A:middle
And what's great about that is
it means it's incredibly easy

00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.006 A:middle
to adopt SiriKit and your
users can expect a consistent,

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:14.776 A:middle
high-quality experience
that's natural,

00:12:15.126 --> 00:12:17.426 A:middle
feels like a conversation
and not like a command line.

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:19.286 A:middle
Let's dig in a bit.

00:12:20.336 --> 00:12:21.516 A:middle
The first role of
your application is

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:23.546 A:middle
to provide vocabulary,
and there's two kinds.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:25.466 A:middle
The first is app vocabulary.

00:12:25.836 --> 00:12:27.136 A:middle
These are terms that
would be known

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:28.566 A:middle
to any user of your application.

00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:30.246 A:middle
Things like UberX or Pinboard.

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:32.866 A:middle
The other is user vocabulary.

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:35.396 A:middle
These are terms that are
specific and important

00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:37.286 A:middle
to an individual user
of your application.

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:39.836 A:middle
Things like their contact
names or names of photo albums.

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.036 A:middle
The main role of
your application is

00:12:43.036 --> 00:12:44.956 A:middle
to provide your app
logic, and this comes

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:46.676 A:middle
in an extension at
three key moments.

00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:49.566 A:middle
The first is to help Siri
understand the parameters

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:50.306 A:middle
of the user's intent.

00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:54.056 A:middle
The second is to help Siri show
the user what will happen if

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:55.196 A:middle
and when they confirm
their intent.

00:12:55.536 --> 00:12:58.036 A:middle
And the third is to actually
of course handle the intent,

00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:00.436 A:middle
to accomplish what the
user came to accomplish.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:00.436 A:middle
to accomplish what the
user came to accomplish.

00:13:01.956 --> 00:13:04.446 A:middle
And during the conversation,
Siri presents visuals

00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.806 A:middle
to the user, and you can
optionally provide a second

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:09.066 A:middle
extension to customize
these so that using Siri

00:13:09.066 --> 00:13:10.636 A:middle
with your application
still feels

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:12.126 A:middle
like using your application
anywhere else.

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:14.836 A:middle
So let's take a look

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.826 A:middle
at a messaging app
integration called Hologram.

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:19.706 A:middle
Hologram is the number one
app for sending messages

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:21.316 A:middle
in a galaxy far, far away.

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:26.286 A:middle
So imagine someone says
to Siri, "Send a hologram

00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:28.246 A:middle
to Obi-Wan saying,
you're my only hope."

00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:32.236 A:middle
Now, it's Siri's job to
take that audio and turn it

00:13:32.236 --> 00:13:34.896 A:middle
into text, but Siri needs
help from your application.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.296 A:middle
Siri doesn't know on its own

00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:39.816 A:middle
that Obi-Wan is an important
user or important person

00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:42.186 A:middle
in your user's life, and
so by providing that piece

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.946 A:middle
of vocabulary to
Siri, you make sure

00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:45.596 A:middle
that Siri understands
what your user said.

00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:50.206 A:middle
Next, Siri works to understand
what the user is trying to do.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:52.466 A:middle
In this case, send a
very important message.

00:13:53.496 --> 00:13:55.396 A:middle
And Siri will also work
to understand parameters,

00:13:55.706 --> 00:13:57.286 A:middle
like the recipient
and the content.

00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:00.386 A:middle
Siri packages all
of this information


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:00.386 A:middle
Siri packages all
of this information

00:14:00.386 --> 00:14:03.396 A:middle
into a structured object
a nice, simple object.

00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:05.326 A:middle
Your application
doesn't have to worry

00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
about the countless ways someone
could express this same idea

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:09.876 A:middle
to Siri, whether it be
different phrasings,

00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:11.236 A:middle
multi-step interactions.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.156 A:middle
All of that's handled
and all you have to worry

00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.906 A:middle
about is this really
simple object.

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:19.116 A:middle
SiriKit will then hand this
object to your extension to help

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:20.416 A:middle
with parameter resolution.

00:14:20.546 --> 00:14:22.326 A:middle
For example, maybe
your application knows

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:24.556 A:middle
that the user said "Obi-Wan,"
but they usually refer

00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:25.716 A:middle
to this person as
Old Ben Kenobi,

00:14:26.086 --> 00:14:27.986 A:middle
and you can instruct
SiriKit to update the intent.

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:30.766 A:middle
Then comes the big event.

00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:32.646 A:middle
It's time to actually
handle the user's intent,

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:34.896 A:middle
and SiriKit will
again hand this object

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:36.346 A:middle
to your extension
for processing.

00:14:36.486 --> 00:14:38.216 A:middle
In this case, you're going to
send the message, you're going

00:14:38.216 --> 00:14:39.336 A:middle
to get in an escape pod,

00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.056 A:middle
roll over some sand dunes,
deal with some Jawas.

00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:43.056 A:middle
You're going to get the
job done for your users.

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:47.896 A:middle
And along the way, Siri will
provide a default user interface

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:49.146 A:middle
for this interaction.

00:14:49.146 --> 00:14:52.066 A:middle
And if you want, you can
also bring your application's

00:14:52.066 --> 00:14:54.506 A:middle
experience into Siri so
that it feels more familiar

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.266 A:middle
to your users.

00:14:56.616 --> 00:14:57.616 A:middle
And that's it.

00:14:57.616 --> 00:14:59.736 A:middle
Those are the three things
that your application has to do

00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:01.566 A:middle
because SiriKit handles
the conversation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:01.566 A:middle
because SiriKit handles
the conversation.

00:15:02.906 --> 00:15:04.986 A:middle
And handling the conversation
actually means a lot.

00:15:05.296 --> 00:15:06.686 A:middle
Siri's behavior is
different depending

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:09.146 A:middle
on how someone starts a
conversation with Siri.

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:12.286 A:middle
So if you're holding your
phone, pressing the Home button,

00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:13.276 A:middle
looking at your screen,

00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:15.616 A:middle
Siri will provide
more visual responses

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:16.766 A:middle
and say less things out loud.

00:15:17.186 --> 00:15:18.846 A:middle
But if you say, "Hey,
Siri," or if you're

00:15:18.846 --> 00:15:20.896 A:middle
in the car using
CarPlay, then Siri's going

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.576 A:middle
to show a lot more
and, or sorry,

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:24.576 A:middle
say a lot more and

00:15:26.486 --> 00:15:29.856 A:middle
SiriKit is powered by
extensions and NSUserActivity,

00:15:30.066 --> 00:15:32.006 A:middle
the same technologies that
power an increasing number

00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:34.226 A:middle
of OS integrations, and you'll
hear a lot about them this week.

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:38.896 A:middle
This year, SiriKit will connect
to applications in six domains,

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.806 A:middle
and in each of these
domains, there may be more

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.506 A:middle
than one intent to
provide a complete,

00:15:42.506 --> 00:15:43.596 A:middle
conversational experience.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:46.256 A:middle
For example, in Messaging,
you can send messages

00:15:46.256 --> 00:15:48.026 A:middle
or search them, and in Payments,

00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:49.886 A:middle
you can request payment
or send payment.

00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:54.086 A:middle
And SiriKit will be available
in all Siri languages,

00:15:54.596 --> 00:15:57.136 A:middle
and this is a big deal
because when I said earlier

00:15:57.136 --> 00:15:58.606 A:middle
that Siri handles
the conversation,

00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:01.866 A:middle

00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:44.386 A:middle
Let's dive in to
what's new with Swift?

00:16:45.026 --> 00:16:47.026 A:middle
Now, it's easy to forget
that we launched Swift

00:16:47.546 --> 00:16:49.836 A:middle
and released it less
than two years ago,

00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:53.296 A:middle
and in that short time,
you've built and submitted

00:16:53.296 --> 00:16:56.066 A:middle
to the App Store
over 100,000 apps,

00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.746 A:middle
including well-known
titles like these.

00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:01.696 A:middle
Now, Swift has also
been very popular

00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:01.696 A:middle
Now, Swift has also
been very popular

00:17:01.696 --> 00:17:02.636 A:middle
with the enterprise as well.

00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:05.746 A:middle
Just as a simple example,
IBM's already built

00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:08.586 A:middle
and deployed hundreds of
apps written in Swift.

00:17:10.156 --> 00:17:10.425 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:16.715 A:middle
Now, there's lots of reasons
that people love Swift,

00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:19.066 A:middle
one of which is that
we open sourced it less

00:17:19.066 --> 00:17:20.546 A:middle
than six months ago.

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:28.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:31.506 A:middle
And in that time, it's become
the number one most downloaded

00:17:31.506 --> 00:17:35.026 A:middle
language project on GitHub,
the number one most watched,

00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:37.046 A:middle
and the number one
most favorited,

00:17:37.426 --> 00:17:38.866 A:middle
and it's stayed on top.

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:43.126 A:middle
I think to me, even better than
this is that we've had a ton

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:45.126 A:middle
of new people get
involved with the project.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.386 A:middle
We now have hundreds of new
contributors contributing

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:50.846 A:middle
through open source, and
we've processed thousands

00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:51.856 A:middle
of poll requests.

00:17:51.956 --> 00:17:53.516 A:middle
The response has
just been phenomenal.

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.046 A:middle
Now, one of the reasons

00:17:56.046 --> 00:17:58.696 A:middle
that Swift being open is really
important to us is that we want

00:17:58.696 --> 00:17:59.826 A:middle
to see it go everywhere.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:03.646 A:middle
For example, we think that
Swift is awesome for the server,

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.726 A:middle
and so we ported it to Linux.

00:18:05.726 --> 00:18:07.876 A:middle
And the community agrees.

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:11.126 A:middle
In a very short period of time,
they've started bringing it

00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:14.186 A:middle
to other popular
platforms like FreeBSD,

00:18:14.186 --> 00:18:15.906 A:middle
Android, and even Windows.

[ Applause ]

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:26.096 A:middle
Now, to help Swift get to
all of these platforms,

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.186 A:middle
we started the Swift
Package Manager.

00:18:28.906 --> 00:18:31.656 A:middle
The Package Manager's a
great way to build, share,

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.816 A:middle
and reuse cross-platform
packages.

00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:36.606 A:middle
It can generate an
Xcode project file

00:18:36.786 --> 00:18:39.566 A:middle
and even compile
projects natively

00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:40.896 A:middle
on platforms like Linux.

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:44.016 A:middle
Another great thing about Swift
Open Source is you can get

00:18:44.016 --> 00:18:45.766 A:middle
involved with the design
of the language itself.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:49.076 A:middle
Swift-evolution has been
an amazing experience

00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:53.106 A:middle
with intense interest in
a completely insane number

00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:54.526 A:middle
of emails on mailing lists.

00:18:54.616 --> 00:18:55.306 A:middle
It's ridiculous.

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:59.146 A:middle
Now, we published an open
roadmap with the goals

00:18:59.146 --> 00:19:02.196 A:middle
for each release,
and we solicit ideas

for each release,
and we solicit ideas

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:04.696 A:middle
and discuss different
directions we could go

00:19:04.696 --> 00:19:06.686 A:middle
to push the language
forward together.

00:19:07.656 --> 00:19:10.726 A:middle
We then debate these
together openly as a community

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:12.886 A:middle
and we turn them into
formal proposals.

00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:17.266 A:middle
So far, we've had over 100
proposals to move Swift forward.

00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:22.546 A:middle
This is only in six months, and
this is just an amazing sign

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:23.726 A:middle
of how fast Swift moves.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:27.316 A:middle
But it also shows another
important and interesting point.

00:19:27.536 --> 00:19:30.616 A:middle
Despite its wide use, Swift
is still a relatively new

00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:31.426 A:middle
programming language.

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:34.666 A:middle
Now, as you've seen
I think, we've chosen

00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:39.946 A:middle
to quickly identify issues in
the Swift language and fix them

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:42.486 A:middle
because we don't want to be
stuck with issues forever.

00:19:43.606 --> 00:19:46.886 A:middle
We are building Swift as the
next great programming language,

00:19:47.356 --> 00:19:50.226 A:middle
and so we want it to be great
for the decades to come.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.976 A:middle
And now the problem with this
is that for some developers,

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:54.396 A:middle
the programming language
changing

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:58.946 A:middle
out from underneath you can be
concerning, and as Swift goes

00:19:58.946 --> 00:20:02.386 A:middle
to new platforms and new kinds
of users with Swift Playgrounds,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

to new platforms and new kinds
of users with Swift Playgrounds,

00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:04.626 A:middle
this becomes an even
bigger concern.

00:20:06.046 --> 00:20:07.046 A:middle
So with that as context,

00:20:07.396 --> 00:20:10.636 A:middle
let's dive into what's
new with Swift 3.

00:20:10.926 --> 00:20:14.696 A:middle
Swift 3. We announced
it in December as part

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:17.006 A:middle
of the open source
launch of Swift,

00:20:17.006 --> 00:20:19.256 A:middle
and we've been developing
it completely in the open.

00:20:20.116 --> 00:20:23.506 A:middle
The number one feature and the
number one goal of Swift 3 is

00:20:23.506 --> 00:20:27.396 A:middle
to get these early growing
pains over with and turn Swift

00:20:27.396 --> 00:20:31.006 A:middle
into a stable and mature base
that we can keep compatible

00:20:31.036 --> 00:20:32.356 A:middle
with future versions
of the language.

00:20:34.236 --> 00:20:34.456 A:middle
No?

[ Applause ]

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.146 A:middle
So because of that, we're
focusing on the core essentials

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.496 A:middle
of the language and
making the tools

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.056 A:middle
and the development
experience really great.

00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:49.816 A:middle
And there are a ton
of different ways

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:51.016 A:middle
that you can see this in Swift.

00:20:51.936 --> 00:20:54.946 A:middle
To give you a simple
example, one common complaint

00:20:54.946 --> 00:20:58.036 A:middle
about Swift 2 is that
the feel of some APIs

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.036 A:middle
in Cocoa didn't feel
natural in Swift.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.036 A:middle
in Cocoa didn't feel
natural in Swift.

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:03.866 A:middle
Swift loves clarity and it aims
to define away boilerplate.

00:21:04.736 --> 00:21:07.836 A:middle
On Swift 3, Cocoa APIs
have an elegant feel.

00:21:08.146 --> 00:21:09.906 A:middle
You could say they're
totally Swifty.

00:21:11.296 --> 00:21:13.986 A:middle
Now, we did this with a number
of different initiatives.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:17.146 A:middle
First, we sat down
and thought hard

00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:21.146 A:middle
about what really makes a great
Swift API, and we wrote it

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:24.086 A:middle
down in a document that's
now available on Swift.org.

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:28.266 A:middle
We then took that and took
those rules and built them right

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:31.436 A:middle
into the Swift recompiler, so
it automatically applies them

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:35.146 A:middle
to Objective-C APIs as it
imports them into Swift.

00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:38.586 A:middle
But Swift goes far
beyond just naming.

00:21:38.586 --> 00:21:39.856 A:middle
Naming's a pretty
hard problem, though,

00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:41.446 A:middle
but it goes beyond just naming.

00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:44.746 A:middle
And if you look at
foundation as a simple example,

00:21:44.746 --> 00:21:47.586 A:middle
you'll find entirely new
Swift native data types.

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:51.176 A:middle
Date is an example of this, and
if you compare Date to NSDate,

00:21:51.486 --> 00:21:54.156 A:middle
you'll find that it provides
proper value semantics,

00:21:54.156 --> 00:21:56.786 A:middle
it's about twice as
fast to pass around,

00:21:57.666 --> 00:22:00.006 A:middle
and it's about 40 times
faster to change due

00:22:09.546 --> 00:22:10.906 A:middle
Now, there are examples
everywhere,

00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:12.836 A:middle
and as Calendar becomes
Calendar,

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:16.396 A:middle
Global Constants become
scoped enums, Date Components,

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:18.316 A:middle
NSDate Components becomes
a proper value type,

00:22:18.316 --> 00:22:20.526 A:middle
and everything is
just feeling so Swift.

00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:26.246 A:middle
If you move beyond foundation,
Dispatch is another critical API

00:22:26.246 --> 00:22:27.736 A:middle
that we work with
all of the time,

00:22:28.566 --> 00:22:30.956 A:middle
but it provides this
low-level, C-style interface.

00:22:31.706 --> 00:22:34.406 A:middle
With Swift 3, Dispatch has
gotten a major overhaul,

00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:35.986 A:middle
has a beautiful object-oriented
API.

about the next big
thing, Swift on the iPad.

[ Applause ]

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:45.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chris.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.596 A:middle
So another aspect of Swift
that excites us is that it's

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:53.246 A:middle
so simple and so approachable
that it's not just great

00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:55.226 A:middle
for implementing apps
and server components.

00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:59.166 A:middle
It's also great as a first
program language to learn.

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:01.306 A:middle
In fact, we think this
is super important,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:01.306 A:middle
In fact, we think this
is super important,

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:02.356 A:middle
and when we designed Swift,

00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:03.946 A:middle
that's also an explicit
goal we had.

00:24:05.146 --> 00:24:06.366 A:middle
And right from the
launch of Swift,

00:24:06.456 --> 00:24:09.486 A:middle
we introduced Xcode Playgrounds,
an interactive environment

00:24:09.486 --> 00:24:11.306 A:middle
where you can quickly
iterate on your code.

00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:12.636 A:middle
And while it's great

00:24:12.636 --> 00:24:15.176 A:middle
for experienced developers
using our Xcode IDE,

00:24:15.826 --> 00:24:17.936 A:middle
and I want to dramatically
expand our focus

00:24:17.936 --> 00:24:20.656 A:middle
and include kits for just
beginning to learn how to code.

00:24:21.116 --> 00:24:23.456 A:middle
So today we are announcing
Swift Playgrounds,

00:24:23.486 --> 00:24:24.656 A:middle
a new app for the iPad.

00:24:24.986 --> 00:24:26.986 A:middle
You've already seen a demo
this morning with the keynote.

00:24:27.846 --> 00:24:30.776 A:middle
It is paired with Xcode
technology, but it's made

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:32.186 A:middle
from the ground up for learning

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:33.786 A:middle
and teaching how
to program Swift.

00:24:34.316 --> 00:24:36.746 A:middle
It's both playful and engaging
for the younger audience,

00:24:37.296 --> 00:24:39.786 A:middle
and it's a fun way of
trying out new things

00:24:39.786 --> 00:24:41.126 A:middle
for experienced developers.

00:24:42.216 --> 00:24:45.606 A:middle
It is designed to work with the
touch interface of the iPad.

00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:48.566 A:middle
We created a new Smart Keyboard

00:24:48.566 --> 00:24:50.746 A:middle
that brings you quick type
suggestions for your code,

00:24:50.826 --> 00:24:52.666 A:middle
similar to code completion
in Xcode.

00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:55.546 A:middle
You often can write entire
lines of code without having

00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:56.846 A:middle
to bring up a full keyboard.

00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
When you edit inline values
such as numbers and colors,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
When you edit inline values
such as numbers and colors,

00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:03.226 A:middle
we pop up these quick editing
controls that allow you

00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:05.726 A:middle
to easily select a value,
again, without having

00:25:05.726 --> 00:25:06.896 A:middle
to bring up a full keyboard.

00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:10.916 A:middle
You can quickly change the
code in your Playground simply

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:12.796 A:middle
by dragging the structural
elements

00:25:12.796 --> 00:25:13.946 A:middle
on the screen with your finger.

00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:17.096 A:middle
And as you would
expect, there's a library

00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:19.886 A:middle
of prebuilt code snippets you
can insert into your code simply

00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:22.366 A:middle
with a tap or again by
dragging them with your finger.

00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:26.016 A:middle
And for the times where you
do bring up a full keyboard

00:25:26.016 --> 00:25:27.326 A:middle
to write some code,
we present you

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:28.896 A:middle
with a dedicated
coding keyboard,

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:30.406 A:middle
which makes it super easy

00:25:30.406 --> 00:25:32.916 A:middle
to access the many special
characters and numbers

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:34.416 A:middle
that you need for
writing Swift code.

00:25:34.806 --> 00:25:37.086 A:middle
Just with a swipe of a finger.

00:25:37.616 --> 00:25:39.386 A:middle
No need to switch
keyboard planes.

00:25:41.366 --> 00:25:44.036 A:middle
The app also ships the
fantastic lesson content.

00:25:45.226 --> 00:25:47.236 A:middle
We're building an
entire series of lessons

00:25:47.236 --> 00:25:49.776 A:middle
that will introduce you to
programming Swift step by step

00:25:49.946 --> 00:25:52.046 A:middle
and we're planning to
rapidly expand this content

00:25:52.046 --> 00:25:55.006 A:middle
over the course of the
next year, but you can go

00:25:55.006 --> 00:25:57.396 A:middle
in to provide learners
with a steam of challenges

00:25:57.396 --> 00:25:58.976 A:middle
that they're going
to update frequently.

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:01.476 A:middle
So they keep coming back
to the app and stay engaged

So they keep coming back
to the app and stay engaged

00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:04.546 A:middle
with the learning process for
the number of deep dive topics.

00:26:05.976 --> 00:26:06.986 A:middle
But you're not limited

00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:09.466 A:middle
to following this
guided lesson content.

00:26:09.786 --> 00:26:12.636 A:middle
You also have the power and the
flexibility to explore coding

00:26:12.636 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
on your own with a set
of simple templates.

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:18.876 A:middle
We created one that makes it
easy to put together a program

00:26:18.876 --> 00:26:22.196 A:middle
with just text input and output
and another one that allows you

00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:24.776 A:middle
to explore and visualize
graphics concepts based

00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:25.396 A:middle
on shapes.

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:29.296 A:middle
And beyond that, since you
have the entire iOS SDK

00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:31.186 A:middle
at your fingertips, you're free

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.986 A:middle
to create pretty much
any Playground you'd like

00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:34.846 A:middle
and use the app to
teach many topics.

00:26:34.846 --> 00:26:38.326 A:middle
You can even control robots
like this one here on the screen

00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:40.146 A:middle
and other accessories
from your Playground,

00:26:40.726 --> 00:26:42.016 A:middle
so it ends up being
a lot of fun.

00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:43.486 A:middle
And to just show you
a little bit more

00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:46.026 A:middle
about how you can leverage the
app, I'm going to ask Ken Orr

00:26:46.026 --> 00:26:46.956 A:middle
to give us another demo.

00:26:57.186 --> 00:27:01.336 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds makes it easy
to get creative through code,

00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:03.206 A:middle
so let's take a look
at a Playground

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:05.896 A:middle
that I created earlier and
I'll show you just what I mean.

00:27:06.626 --> 00:27:11.236 A:middle
Now, I started here with
the Shapes template,

00:27:11.536 --> 00:27:14.036 A:middle
and you can see the
beginnings of my picture

00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:14.946 A:middle
over there on the right.

00:27:15.636 --> 00:27:17.836 A:middle
So just some squares
of different sizes

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.876 A:middle
and colors rotated
around the center.

00:27:20.796 --> 00:27:24.236 A:middle
Now, everything over on
the right is a product

00:27:24.236 --> 00:27:25.886 A:middle
of my code on the left.

00:27:25.886 --> 00:27:30.576 A:middle
At the heart of my code
over here is this for loop.

00:27:31.056 --> 00:27:33.496 A:middle
That's where I create
each one of those squares.

00:27:34.306 --> 00:27:36.936 A:middle
And then up at the very
top, I've got a variable

00:27:36.936 --> 00:27:39.906 A:middle
that defines how many
squares I should create.

00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:44.266 A:middle
Well, right now, that's set to
15, but I'd really like to get

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:47.426 A:middle
that entire right-hand side
to be filled up with color,

00:27:47.846 --> 00:27:50.736 A:middle
so to do that, let me just
try bumping this up to 80,

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:52.756 A:middle
and then I'll tap Run.

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:59.576 A:middle
Nice. And I think maybe instead
of maroon, I'll use a nice blue.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:01.316 --> 00:28:02.236 A:middle
That looks good.

00:28:02.696 --> 00:28:05.456 A:middle
And I really like the pattern
that I've got going on here

00:28:05.456 --> 00:28:07.286 A:middle
where the squares,
they're kind of spiraling

00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:08.746 A:middle
down into the center
of the Canvas.

00:28:09.096 --> 00:28:10.336 A:middle
That looks really cool.

00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:12.896 A:middle
I bet I could make
that even more obvious

00:28:13.156 --> 00:28:16.526 A:middle
if I change the size of those
squares more dramatically

00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:17.176 A:middle
over time.

00:28:17.786 --> 00:28:22.286 A:middle
So back down in the for loop
here where I calculate the size,

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:24.216 A:middle
I'm going to tap on the plus

00:28:24.316 --> 00:28:26.066 A:middle
between these two
different expressions.

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:28.756 A:middle
Rather than just
adding them together,

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:30.536 A:middle
why don't I try multiplication?

00:28:31.796 --> 00:28:34.356 A:middle
Run that. That looks good.

00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:38.426 A:middle
So you can start to get an
idea of just how easy it is

00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:42.486 A:middle
to explore and experiment
with code using just a touch.

00:28:44.006 --> 00:28:46.296 A:middle
So next, I'd like to
bring a little bit

00:28:46.296 --> 00:28:47.746 A:middle
of life to my picture.

00:28:48.296 --> 00:28:51.086 A:middle
I'll use some animation
for that.

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:54.006 A:middle
Now, to do that, I'm going
to use some API that's built

00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.406 A:middle
in to the Shapes template,

00:28:56.606 --> 00:29:02.156 A:middle
and I think what I want is I
want the squares to pop and spin


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:56.606 --> 00:29:02.156 A:middle
and I think what I want is I
want the squares to pop and spin

00:29:02.156 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
in from the center
of the stream.

00:29:04.886 --> 00:29:08.436 A:middle
So I'm going to tap right here
after I create each square,

00:29:08.876 --> 00:29:11.716 A:middle
and then down in the shortcuts
bar, I'm going to scroll over

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:13.736 A:middle
and I'm going to tap on
the Animate function.

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:18.316 A:middle
So I'll have an animation
that's maybe three seconds long

00:29:18.316 --> 00:29:22.776 A:middle
and I'll have it wait for just
one second before it starts,

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:26.476 A:middle
and then everything that I put
inside of that block there.

00:29:26.476 --> 00:29:30.296 A:middle
It's going to be automatically
animated for me, so I'm going

00:29:30.296 --> 00:29:32.306 A:middle
to pull in the rotation
like that.

00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:36.446 A:middle
And then I also want the size
of the square to animate,

00:29:36.756 --> 00:29:40.776 A:middle
so I think I'll start it out
at zero width and zero height,

00:29:41.566 --> 00:29:43.646 A:middle
and then back in
the Animate block,

00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:45.236 A:middle
I'll set it to what
it was before.

00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:51.816 A:middle
So I'll say square.size
equals size,

00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:55.526 A:middle
and then I already calculated
the size above, so I'll just use

00:29:55.526 --> 00:29:58.906 A:middle
that same variable,
and I'll tap Run.

And there's one more thing
that I'd like to do here.

00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:16.366 A:middle
I'd like to add a little
bit of touch handling.

00:30:16.876 --> 00:30:19.386 A:middle
And to do that, I'm going to
use some more API that's built

00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:20.606 A:middle
into the Shapes template.

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:22.816 A:middle
And down here at the bottom,

00:30:22.816 --> 00:30:26.996 A:middle
I've actually already added
a drag handler to the Canvas.

00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:30.186 A:middle
The block's waiting
for me to fill it in,

00:30:30.186 --> 00:30:31.836 A:middle
and I've also written
a function here

00:30:32.176 --> 00:30:35.146 A:middle
that will rotate each square
around the center of the Canvas.

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:38.596 A:middle
So I just need to call that
function in this block here.

00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:40.636 A:middle
So back in the shortcuts bar,

00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:44.736 A:middle
I'm going to say
squares.rotateforTouches

00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:46.796 A:middle
and then I'll tap Run.

00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:50.746 A:middle
And now I'm going to
tap my finger and hold

00:30:50.746 --> 00:30:54.176 A:middle
in the top right, and
I'm going to pull down,

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:58.756 A:middle
and just like that, I've
added Touch Handling.

00:30:59.376 --> 00:30:59.726 A:middle
Thank you.

like to show you this afternoon.

color picker here.

00:31:26.546 --> 00:31:27.516 A:middle
I'd love to show you that.

00:31:28.986 --> 00:31:32.966 A:middle
So when you tap on the color
swatch, the Color Chooser pops

00:31:32.966 --> 00:31:35.436 A:middle
out from underneath your
finger and you can drag around

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:36.996 A:middle
and pick the color you want.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:41.536 A:middle
Now, all the code to build
that is over on the left.

00:31:42.546 --> 00:31:45.276 A:middle
So let me make the code bigger
so we can take a quick look.

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:48.266 A:middle
Now, the first thing you'll
notice, up at the very top,

00:31:49.066 --> 00:31:54.106 A:middle
I'm importing UIKit, so I
have access to the iOS SDK

00:31:54.106 --> 00:31:58.106 A:middle
in this Playground and in
any Playground that I create.

00:31:59.276 --> 00:32:01.286 A:middle
And then all the way
down at the bottom here,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.276 --> 00:32:01.286 A:middle
And then all the way
down at the bottom here,

00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:05.286 A:middle
this is where I tell Swift
Playgrounds to take my view

00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:07.636 A:middle
and show it over on
the right-hand side.

00:32:09.846 --> 00:32:11.946 A:middle
There's one last thing
that I'd like to add

00:32:12.006 --> 00:32:15.206 A:middle
to my Playground here, and
that's I want to add something

00:32:15.206 --> 00:32:16.936 A:middle
that I can set the color of so

00:32:16.936 --> 00:32:18.876 A:middle
that I can try out
my Color Chooser.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:22.886 A:middle
So I think to do that, I'll
just add a simple UI Image View,

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:26.656 A:middle
so let me bring up the coding
keyboard, and I'm going to say,

00:32:27.086 --> 00:32:34.936 A:middle
"Let image view equal
UI Image View."

00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:38.166 A:middle
And I'm going to use the
initializer that takes an image,

00:32:38.486 --> 00:32:40.686 A:middle
and then I'm going to
tap on the third item

00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:42.546 A:middle
in the shortcut bar,
that little picture.

00:32:43.306 --> 00:32:44.576 A:middle
That's an image literal.

00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:47.866 A:middle
So when I tap on it in my
source code, I can choose

00:32:48.296 --> 00:32:50.636 A:middle
from resources that have been
added to this Playground.

00:32:51.516 --> 00:32:55.906 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:58.046 A:middle
So I added the Swift
bird earlier,

00:32:58.086 --> 00:32:59.326 A:middle
so I'm going to choose that.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:01.256 --> 00:33:04.656 A:middle
And then last thing I need to
do here, I need to get you,

00:33:04.656 --> 00:33:07.356 A:middle
the UI Image View into
the view hierarchy,

00:33:07.856 --> 00:33:16.176 A:middle
so I'll just say
viewController.view.addSubview,

00:33:17.046 --> 00:33:18.816 A:middle
toss in the image view.

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:22.466 A:middle
We'll run that, then I'm going
to make the view full screen.

00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:25.386 A:middle
And know we can see
I've got my image,

00:33:26.366 --> 00:33:28.976 A:middle
I've got our color picker,
and I actually snuck

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:30.766 A:middle
in one little other
feature here.

00:33:30.956 --> 00:33:33.156 A:middle
I want it to be a little
bit more fun, set the color

00:33:33.156 --> 00:33:36.926 A:middle
of the bird, figured hey,
why not do it that way?

00:33:43.256 --> 00:33:44.776 A:middle

00:33:45.076 --> 00:33:45.346 A:middle
Thank you.

00:33:45.826 --> 00:33:46.326 A:middle

00:33:52.226 --> 00:33:53.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ken.

00:33:57.626 --> 00:34:01.076 A:middle
So as you saw, no matter what
kind of Playground you create,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.626 --> 00:34:01.076 A:middle
So as you saw, no matter what
kind of Playground you create,

00:34:01.846 --> 00:34:05.866 A:middle
you always do so by
leveraging the actual iOS SDK,

00:34:05.986 --> 00:34:09.136 A:middle
including the APIs that give you
access to the device's hardware.

00:34:09.576 --> 00:34:11.196 A:middle
And by writing real Swift code,

00:34:11.396 --> 00:34:13.166 A:middle
this is perhaps the
biggest differentiator

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:15.896 A:middle
to other learning apps that
often use a limited approach

00:34:15.896 --> 00:34:17.326 A:middle
that users quickly outgrow.

00:34:17.686 --> 00:34:19.646 A:middle
In Swift Playgrounds,
you'll always learn how

00:34:19.646 --> 00:34:20.815 A:middle
to write real Swift code.

00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:22.696 A:middle
And by the way, as a side note,

00:34:22.696 --> 00:34:25.176 A:middle
the entire Playgrounds app
itself is also written in Swift.

00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:32.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:32.516 --> 00:34:34.996 A:middle
So Swift Playgrounds offers
you many ways to experiment

00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:38.806 A:middle
and to teach and to learn how to
code, and we are very passionate

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:41.485 A:middle
about letting as many users
as possible, especially kids,

00:34:41.966 --> 00:34:43.835 A:middle
take advantage of
this new opportunity.

00:34:43.906 --> 00:34:47.206 A:middle
And in fact, we hope that you
will help us create an entire

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.106 A:middle
platform for learning by
creating additional content.

00:34:50.545 --> 00:34:53.505 A:middle
And to get you started, we're
going to make documentation

00:34:53.505 --> 00:34:56.406 A:middle
on our Playground's file format
available on our website today.

00:34:57.065 --> 00:34:58.646 A:middle
And later this year,
we are planning

00:34:58.646 --> 00:35:00.296 A:middle
to publish our lesson materials,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.646 --> 00:35:00.296 A:middle
to publish our lesson materials,

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:03.416 A:middle
including the rich 3D
Puzzle World under a license

00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:06.616 A:middle
that will let you copy
and reuse our materials.

00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:07.966 A:middle
Incorporate your own ideas,

00:35:07.966 --> 00:35:10.386 A:middle
and help us reach many
audiences around the world.

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:14.896 A:middle
So once a user has
created a Playground,

00:35:15.276 --> 00:35:17.596 A:middle
there's numerous ways
for sharing the results.

00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:20.136 A:middle
Playgrounds are simply
documents so you can share them

00:35:20.136 --> 00:35:21.886 A:middle
in all the usual ways
that you're familiar with.

00:35:22.206 --> 00:35:23.266 A:middle
And we didn't stop there.

00:35:23.946 --> 00:35:25.416 A:middle
We made it easier
to take pictures

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.466 A:middle
of your program's output and
even incorporated replay kits

00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:30.206 A:middle
so that you can record
a coding session

00:35:30.426 --> 00:35:32.056 A:middle
and publish your
work as a video.

00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:33.846 A:middle
And for--

[ Applause ]

00:35:40.566 --> 00:35:42.966 A:middle
And for more advanced learners,
the Swift Playgrounds app

00:35:42.966 --> 00:35:46.326 A:middle
on the iPad and Xcode on the Mac
complement each other nicely.

00:35:46.876 --> 00:35:48.406 A:middle
You can move Playgrounds
back and forth

00:35:48.406 --> 00:35:50.746 A:middle
between the two environments
that eventually transition

00:35:50.746 --> 00:35:52.866 A:middle
into developing full
apps in the Xcode IDE.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:55.936 A:middle
And so that brings us
nicely to the next topic.

To tell you more about
Xcode, I'm going to hand

00:36:01.536 --> 00:36:02.456 A:middle
over to Matthew Furlich

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:13.386 A:middle
Xcode 8 is a big release
with much to talk about,

00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:15.816 A:middle
so let's just jump right
in and start talking

00:36:15.816 --> 00:36:16.726 A:middle
about our Source Editor.

00:36:17.406 --> 00:36:18.776 A:middle
For this release, we focused

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:20.926 A:middle
on adding the most
highly requested features

00:36:21.356 --> 00:36:21.826 A:middle
from all of you.

00:36:23.386 --> 00:36:25.446 A:middle
We started by adding in
active line highlighting,

00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:28.206 A:middle
and you can edit this color.

00:36:28.206 --> 00:36:29.726 A:middle
It'd work beautifully
with any Editor theme.

[ Applause ]

00:36:34.416 --> 00:36:34.906 A:middle
It gets better [laughter].

00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.176 A:middle
We also did a support
for Swift color literals

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:42.946 A:middle
so you can now view and define
colors right in your source.

00:36:43.516 --> 00:36:48.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:49.146 --> 00:36:49.606 A:middle
Let's go for three.

00:36:49.606 --> 00:36:52.516 A:middle
We added in Swift image literals
too so you can now view images

00:36:52.516 --> 00:36:57.076 A:middle
in your source and as
results for code completion.

00:36:57.076 --> 00:37:02.046 A:middle
And to help you write better
documentation, the editor has,

00:36:57.076 --> 00:37:02.046 A:middle
And to help you write better
documentation, the editor has,

00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:04.286 A:middle
now has a command
to generate mark-up

00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:05.376 A:middle
for documenting your APIs.

[ Applause ]

00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:13.566 A:middle
So these features and a number

00:37:13.566 --> 00:37:16.616 A:middle
of usability improvements really
make Xcode's editing experience

00:37:16.826 --> 00:37:19.486 A:middle
awesome, but we didn't
want to stop there,

00:37:19.826 --> 00:37:21.786 A:middle
so we've added one more
feature, and it turns

00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:23.686 A:middle
out to be your number

With Xcode 8, we are
opening up the IDE.

00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:38.886 A:middle
We're starting with
source editing.

00:37:39.656 --> 00:37:41.726 A:middle
This extension works
with the active editor

00:37:41.836 --> 00:37:44.276 A:middle
to enable transformations,
changes in selection,

00:37:44.486 --> 00:37:45.876 A:middle
and navigation within the file.

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:49.596 A:middle
And this opens up worlds of
opportunities for commands

00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:51.736 A:middle
such as reformatting,
commenting,

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:54.006 A:middle
localizations, even to-do items.

00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:57.536 A:middle
Now, you can implement many
actions in each extension,

00:37:58.056 --> 00:38:00.796 A:middle
and each action is listed
as part of the Editor menu.

these actions too to enable them

[ Applause ]

00:38:15.596 --> 00:38:17.226 A:middle
As developers of
extensions, you can ship them

00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:19.576 A:middle
through the App Store or
deploy with Developer ID,

00:38:19.976 --> 00:38:21.916 A:middle
and these extensions
work in Xcode 8

00:38:21.916 --> 00:38:23.826 A:middle
on both Sierra and El Capitan.

Now, as a standard extension,
users can feel safe too.

00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.986 A:middle
These extensions are run
as a separate process

00:38:35.076 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
and have their signatures
verified.

00:38:37.636 --> 00:38:40.446 A:middle
And to further reinforce
safety, Xcode is now secured

00:38:40.446 --> 00:38:42.186 A:middle
by system integrity protection.

00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:44.266 A:middle
Which means only
trusted libraries

00:38:44.336 --> 00:38:47.706 A:middle
and extensions can interact
with the IDE and your code.

00:38:49.576 --> 00:38:52.726 A:middle
So the new source editing
extension is our first step

00:38:52.896 --> 00:38:55.526 A:middle
towards making Xcode an
even more extensible IDE.

Now, we've also been
working on some improvements

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:05.396 A:middle
to that way you learn
about code, and for that,

00:39:05.396 --> 00:39:07.946 A:middle
we have a brand new API
reference experience.

00:39:10.206 --> 00:39:12.316 A:middle
We've merged together
the API documentation

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:15.806 A:middle
for our four platforms into
a single, unified reference.

00:39:16.996 --> 00:39:19.616 A:middle
Now, this reference
makes navigation easy,

00:39:19.986 --> 00:39:21.536 A:middle
working through frameworks
and symbols.

00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:25.266 A:middle
Now, searching the unified
reference means you see a single

00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:28.616 A:middle
result for each API and we've
integrated the same fuzzy

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:31.276 A:middle
matching we use for code
completion and open quickly.

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:33.876 A:middle
When browsing the reference,

00:39:34.136 --> 00:39:37.316 A:middle
the platform availabilities are
clearly listed for each API.

00:39:38.636 --> 00:39:40.696 A:middle
And in previous releases,
we ship this

00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:42.906 A:middle
as a separate download
because of its size.

00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:45.236 A:middle
With this release, we've
been able to shrink it

00:39:45.236 --> 00:39:47.526 A:middle
to almost one-tenth to
what it was previously,

00:39:47.796 --> 00:39:49.146 A:middle
so now we've included
it by default,

00:39:49.146 --> 00:39:51.066 A:middle
so you'll always have
the information you need.

00:39:52.516 --> 00:39:58.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:00.496 A:middle
Now, we also have some
great, new improvements

00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:00.496 A:middle
Now, we also have some
great, new improvements

00:40:00.556 --> 00:40:01.986 A:middle
to Interface Builder, and I'd

00:40:01.986 --> 00:40:03.416 A:middle
like to show them
to you in a demo.

00:40:11.056 --> 00:40:12.826 A:middle
So here we have a project.

00:40:12.826 --> 00:40:14.336 A:middle
We're calling this Trailblazer.

00:40:14.586 --> 00:40:15.956 A:middle
It's a social application

00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:17.506 A:middle
for sharing your
favorite hiking trails.

00:40:18.806 --> 00:40:22.076 A:middle
Now, in addition to the way
that your interface is laid out,

00:40:22.266 --> 00:40:24.536 A:middle
you'll now notice that Interface
Builder is showing you the way

00:40:24.536 --> 00:40:26.286 A:middle
it's going to render
on a device.

00:40:27.036 --> 00:40:29.876 A:middle
Interface Builder now shows you
visual effects like vibrancy,

00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:32.206 A:middle
blurs, and shadows
right on the Canvas,

00:40:32.726 --> 00:40:37.036 A:middle
making a seamless experience for
designing and running your app.

00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:39.156 A:middle
You'll also notice that we're
displaying the interface

00:40:39.156 --> 00:40:40.516 A:middle
in the dimensions of a device,

00:40:41.196 --> 00:40:43.316 A:middle
and there's a new configuration
bar along the bottom

00:40:43.506 --> 00:40:44.656 A:middle
with common device sizes.

00:40:45.856 --> 00:40:48.486 A:middle
Here we're looking at
it in an iPhone 6s Plus.

00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:52.326 A:middle
I can select one of the other
items, like let me click on one

00:40:52.326 --> 00:40:54.876 A:middle
of the iPads, and I can see
how my interface will be

00:40:54.876 --> 00:40:55.886 A:middle
displayed there.

00:40:56.516 --> 00:41:02.846 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:41:03.346 --> 00:41:05.826 A:middle
Here you see we've designed
an adaptive layout using two

00:41:05.826 --> 00:41:06.886 A:middle
columns on iPad.

00:41:08.496 --> 00:41:11.376 A:middle
To view it in other ways, I can
change the orientation if I want

00:41:11.376 --> 00:41:12.346 A:middle
to view it in landscape.

00:41:12.756 --> 00:41:14.866 A:middle
I can also view it in
one of the adaptations.

00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:18.026 A:middle
For example, let's look at it
in one-third size, which is used

00:41:18.026 --> 00:41:20.126 A:middle
for slide over as
for multitasking.

00:41:21.226 --> 00:41:22.796 A:middle
This is great because
it really allows me

00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:24.976 A:middle
to ensure I've implemented
the right interface

00:41:25.236 --> 00:41:29.166 A:middle
for all the ways users
will experience my app.

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:30.896 A:middle
Now, we've also improved
the experience

00:41:30.896 --> 00:41:33.686 A:middle
for creating adaptive
layouts using size classes.

00:41:33.686 --> 00:41:35.066 A:middle
Let me give you an example.

00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:39.256 A:middle
The designers of this app wanted
to put an image, a button on top

00:41:39.256 --> 00:41:42.056 A:middle
of the image to show the hiking
trails overlaid on a map.

00:41:42.826 --> 00:41:44.816 A:middle
But because of the size
of the map, they only want

00:41:44.816 --> 00:41:45.986 A:middle
to do it on wider displays.

00:41:47.016 --> 00:41:47.566 A:middle
That's really easy.

00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:51.576 A:middle
In the configuration bar, I'll
click the Vary for Traits button

00:41:51.866 --> 00:41:53.856 A:middle
and I'm presented with the
two size class options,

00:41:54.156 --> 00:41:56.236 A:middle
Width and height.

00:41:56.236 --> 00:41:58.776 A:middle
iPhones and iPads differ
on the width size class,

00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
so I'll check that option.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
so I'll check that option.

00:42:01.496 --> 00:42:03.666 A:middle
The configuration bar
turns blue to remind me

00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:06.576 A:middle
that I'm making customizations
for a specific size class.

00:42:07.576 --> 00:42:10.196 A:middle
But you'll also note the
list of devices have changed

00:42:10.396 --> 00:42:12.956 A:middle
to show me those devices
which will take advantage

00:42:13.156 --> 00:42:14.246 A:middle
of that customization.

00:42:15.046 --> 00:42:18.436 A:middle
Here I can see various iPads and
orientations and adaptations.

00:42:19.196 --> 00:42:22.736 A:middle
The last item, though, is the
iPhone 6s Plus in landscape.

00:42:23.596 --> 00:42:25.676 A:middle
That device and orientation
makes use

00:42:25.726 --> 00:42:28.986 A:middle
of the regular width size class,
and this is great information

00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:31.296 A:middle
because now I can ensure
I'm designing the interface

00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:32.366 A:middle
for the devices I intend.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:36.366 A:middle
I think our interface will look
great there, so let's go ahead

00:42:36.366 --> 00:42:37.316 A:middle
and make those changes.

00:42:37.316 --> 00:42:40.426 A:middle
I'll go into the library
and we'll grab a button out

00:42:40.856 --> 00:42:42.336 A:middle
and drag it into the interface.

00:42:43.406 --> 00:42:44.936 A:middle
If your hands weren't so sweaty,

00:42:44.936 --> 00:42:45.776 A:middle
you could grab the
button [laughter].

00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:49.976 A:middle
Come on.

00:42:53.306 --> 00:42:54.426 A:middle
Nobody look for a second.

00:43:14.266 --> 00:43:15.966 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:43:24.386 --> 00:43:25.976 A:middle
That should not be
the biggest applause.

00:43:26.026 --> 00:43:26.316 A:middle
Okay [laughter].

00:43:27.936 --> 00:43:29.346 A:middle
So let's continue on.

00:43:29.346 --> 00:43:31.986 A:middle
I'm going to delete the title
from this, and we'll go ahead

00:43:31.986 --> 00:43:33.676 A:middle
and set an image for it.

00:43:33.676 --> 00:43:35.706 A:middle
We'll make it this nice
compass icon we're given

00:43:36.206 --> 00:43:37.826 A:middle
and we'll just place
it correctly.

00:43:38.236 --> 00:43:40.826 A:middle
Now, I will connect up this
button a little bit later,

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:43.176 A:middle
but let's make sure we got
the interface we wanted.

00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:45.626 A:middle
I'll click Done in
the configuration bar

00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:49.616 A:middle
and we'll switch back to the
iPhone 6s Plus in landscape.

00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:50.596 A:middle
Our button appears.

00:43:50.886 --> 00:43:53.906 A:middle
When I switch back to
portrait, it does not,

00:43:54.146 --> 00:43:55.856 A:middle
and that's exactly the
interface I wanted.

00:43:56.496 --> 00:43:58.456 A:middle
So Interface Builder
now makes it really easy

00:43:58.456 --> 00:44:00.076 A:middle
to design adaptive layouts.

to design adaptive layouts.

00:44:01.226 --> 00:44:02.776 A:middle
The configuration bar is going

00:44:02.776 --> 00:44:05.396 A:middle
to show devices for
iOS and watchOS.

00:44:06.136 --> 00:44:08.026 A:middle
It also shows some
helpful options for tvOS.

00:44:08.996 --> 00:44:11.486 A:middle
I'll bring up the tvOS
version of our application,

00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:14.256 A:middle
and you'll see the configuration
bar now shows you options

00:44:14.306 --> 00:44:17.936 A:middle
for the light interface
and the dark interface.

00:44:18.586 --> 00:44:20.556 A:middle
And I can even make
customizations here too.

00:44:20.556 --> 00:44:22.536 A:middle
For example, let's
add a specialization

00:44:22.536 --> 00:44:25.476 A:middle
of the compass icon for
dark mode so that it pops

00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:26.146 A:middle
out a little bit better.

00:44:28.016 --> 00:44:29.066 A:middle
Now, there's one more feature

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.596 A:middle
for Interface Builder
I'd like to show you.

00:44:32.066 --> 00:44:34.356 A:middle
You'll see that the tvOS
Storyboard is zoomed

00:44:34.356 --> 00:44:36.596 A:middle
out so it fits on the
entirety of the Canvas.

00:44:37.676 --> 00:44:40.036 A:middle
Interface Builder now
supports Canvas operations

00:44:40.036 --> 00:44:41.596 A:middle
at any zoom level.

00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:49.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:49.706 --> 00:44:51.506 A:middle
So whether you want to
zoom all the way in,

00:44:51.506 --> 00:44:54.756 A:middle
get pixel perfect alignments,
or you want to zoom way back out

00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:56.926 A:middle
and work at an overview,
you can do it all.

Thank you.

00:45:16.006 --> 00:45:18.876 A:middle
Designing in Interface Builder
now feels like working directly

00:45:18.876 --> 00:45:20.356 A:middle
on a device, and editing

00:45:20.356 --> 00:45:23.326 A:middle
at any zoom level means you're
no longer constrained by how big

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:25.676 A:middle
or small those devices
really are.

00:45:28.066 --> 00:45:30.576 A:middle
For this release, we've also
focused on the accessibility

00:45:30.656 --> 00:45:32.466 A:middle
of our tools, and in particular,

00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:35.376 A:middle
we've made Interface Builder
work great with voiceover.

00:45:36.246 --> 00:45:38.736 A:middle
We've also completely rewritten
our AppleScript Dictionary,

00:45:38.806 --> 00:45:40.576 A:middle
making Xcode much
easier to integrate

00:45:40.576 --> 00:45:41.976 A:middle
with desktop automation.

[ Applause ]

00:45:48.596 --> 00:45:51.406 A:middle
Now, with each release, we add
additional support for finding,

00:45:51.686 --> 00:45:53.556 A:middle
diagnosing, and fixing issues.

00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:56.796 A:middle
And with Xcode 8, we are taking
another big step forward.

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.606 A:middle
Over the last year, we've
added over 100 new diagnostics,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.606 A:middle
Over the last year, we've
added over 100 new diagnostics,

00:46:01.866 --> 00:46:03.716 A:middle
which provide great
insight as you build

00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:05.756 A:middle
and as you edit your
code with live issues.

00:46:07.126 --> 00:46:10.046 A:middle
We've added three new static
analyzers for localization,

00:46:10.246 --> 00:46:11.956 A:middle
malleability, and deallocation.

00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:14.936 A:middle
All common patterns that can
cause issues in your apps.

00:46:16.366 --> 00:46:18.786 A:middle
And we've continued to
invest in our testing system,

00:46:19.116 --> 00:46:21.066 A:middle
improving stability,
performance,

00:46:21.546 --> 00:46:22.606 A:middle
and adding some new options.

00:46:24.756 --> 00:46:28.106 A:middle
Xcode will now capture and
display logs for crashes

00:46:28.526 --> 00:46:29.826 A:middle
that occur during your testing.

00:46:31.516 --> 00:46:35.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:37.656 A:middle
This is a great option
because you can run your tests,

00:46:38.006 --> 00:46:40.516 A:middle
collect those logs, and
just like crash logs,

00:46:40.516 --> 00:46:43.286 A:middle
you can view them right in the
debugger to diagnose the issues.

00:46:44.566 --> 00:46:46.806 A:middle
We've also enhanced
xcodebuild with a new option

00:46:46.806 --> 00:46:48.306 A:middle
to run prebuilt tests.

00:46:50.516 --> 00:46:54.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:55.646 A:middle
Woo hoo, indeed.

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.656 A:middle
It means this is perfect for
integrating scalable testing

00:46:58.746 --> 00:47:00.336 A:middle
with your own continuous
integration.

with your own continuous
integration.

00:47:02.816 --> 00:47:05.216 A:middle
So now more than ever, Xcode
will help you with issues

00:47:05.216 --> 00:47:08.176 A:middle
as you build, analyze,
and test your apps.

00:47:08.706 --> 00:47:10.866 A:middle
But oftentimes some of
the most interesting,

00:47:10.866 --> 00:47:13.726 A:middle
if not let's say
diabolical, issues happen

00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:14.896 A:middle
when you run your code.

00:47:15.676 --> 00:47:18.176 A:middle
For that, we're introducing
something new called

00:47:18.176 --> 00:47:19.096 A:middle
Runtime Issues.

00:47:20.516 --> 00:47:24.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:47:24.696 --> 00:47:26.226 A:middle
Runtime Issues are
like our others.

00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:28.306 A:middle
You're alerted to them
in the Activity view,

00:47:28.576 --> 00:47:31.076 A:middle
and you'll see details about
them in the Issue Navigator.

00:47:31.746 --> 00:47:34.896 A:middle
We've added a toggle at
the top to highlight them.

00:47:35.076 --> 00:47:37.636 A:middle
Now, there are three
kinds of runtime issues;

00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:40.176 A:middle
UI, threads, and memory.

00:47:41.026 --> 00:47:41.726 A:middle
Let's start with UI.

00:47:43.466 --> 00:47:46.436 A:middle
The View Debugger is already
a great tool for visualizing

00:47:46.436 --> 00:47:49.106 A:middle
and diagnosing problems
with your interface.

00:47:50.216 --> 00:47:52.736 A:middle
In addition to improved
accuracy and visual rendering,

00:47:53.066 --> 00:47:56.176 A:middle
the View Debugger will now
detect layout issues at runtime.

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:02.206 A:middle
With each capture, the View
Debugger is able to detect views

these are caused by missing

00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:06.386 A:middle

These issues are surfaced
right in the Navigator

and the Inspector provides
details to help you fix them.

00:48:19.276 --> 00:48:21.906 A:middle
Now, threading issues
are often unpredictable

00:48:21.906 --> 00:48:23.486 A:middle
and can be difficult to debug,

00:48:23.486 --> 00:48:25.566 A:middle
and there are many
potential causes.

00:48:25.816 --> 00:48:28.956 A:middle
Things like unlocking from the
wrong thread or data races.

To help you track down
these kinds of issues,

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:35.626 A:middle
we're integrating Thread
Sanitizer into Xcode 8.

00:48:36.946 --> 00:48:38.266 A:middle
When enabled for
you application,

00:48:38.436 --> 00:48:41.896 A:middle
the Thread Sanitizer is able to
detect common threading problems

00:48:42.296 --> 00:48:44.106 A:middle
and will surface them
as runtime issues.

00:48:45.146 --> 00:48:47.466 A:middle
You can have Xcode break on
these issues as they occur

00:48:47.686 --> 00:48:49.686 A:middle
or you can collect them
all and review them

00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:50.436 A:middle

of these issues,
giving you details

00:48:55.526 --> 00:48:56.746 A:middle
about any race conditions

Now, like threading,

memory issues are often
challenging to identify and fix.

00:49:12.536 --> 00:49:15.726 A:middle
And to debug them effectively,
you often want to view a graph

00:49:15.726 --> 00:49:18.016 A:middle
of your objects and see how
they're all interconnected,

00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:20.306 A:middle

00:50:05.786 --> 00:50:08.386 A:middle
Okay, so here we have the
Trailblazer application.

00:50:08.386 --> 00:50:10.186 A:middle
I'm going to launch
it in the simulator.

00:50:11.166 --> 00:50:12.496 A:middle
Now, I was debugging
this earlier

00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:14.296 A:middle
and I noticed some memory
issues I wanted to look at.

00:50:15.416 --> 00:50:17.366 A:middle
I'll bring up the memory
report while we're doing this

00:50:18.076 --> 00:50:19.266 A:middle
and I'll click on the trail.

00:50:19.776 --> 00:50:20.886 A:middle
You'll see that memory spikes.

00:50:21.376 --> 00:50:21.996 A:middle
That one's okay.

00:50:21.996 --> 00:50:23.696 A:middle
I investigated that
early, and that's just

00:50:23.696 --> 00:50:25.296 A:middle
from loading all the
assets for the trail.

00:50:26.506 --> 00:50:29.036 A:middle
What I noticed, though, was
as I clicked on each review,

00:50:29.206 --> 00:50:32.846 A:middle
our memory spikes, and we
don't reclaim that memory,

00:50:33.206 --> 00:50:34.686 A:middle
even if we go back all the way

00:50:34.686 --> 00:50:36.316 A:middle
to the beginning
of our application.

00:50:37.496 --> 00:50:39.656 A:middle
This is generally indicative
of a memory management problem

00:50:39.816 --> 00:50:42.016 A:middle
and something we can use the
Memory Debugger to investigate,

00:50:43.456 --> 00:50:45.846 A:middle
so I'll click the Memory
Debugger button in the bar here,

00:50:46.226 --> 00:50:47.696 A:middle
and as we pause your
application,

00:50:47.696 --> 00:50:49.606 A:middle
we capture a graph
of the objects.

00:50:50.726 --> 00:50:53.996 A:middle
The debug navigator now shows
me all the objects allocated

00:50:53.996 --> 00:50:56.276 A:middle
in my application,
both those I created

00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:10.696 A:middle
Here I've typed in "controller"
and I see I have three instances

00:51:10.696 --> 00:51:12.396 A:middle
of the Comment View
Controller around.

00:51:13.016 --> 00:51:14.646 A:middle

When I select any one of
them, we'll see a graph

00:51:17.756 --> 00:51:18.786 A:middle
for this object on the right.

00:51:19.846 --> 00:51:22.196 A:middle
Now, what you're seeing here
are all the reference paths

00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:25.146 A:middle
to this object that are
keeping it around in memory.

00:51:26.966 --> 00:51:30.116 A:middle
One of these objects I see here
is a Swift capture context.

00:51:30.526 --> 00:51:31.606 A:middle
This is somewhere in code

00:51:31.606 --> 00:51:34.536 A:middle
that my View Controller has been
captured as part of a closure.

to start looking.

I'll bring up the Inspector
to look at more details,

00:51:40.326 --> 00:51:42.996 A:middle
and one of the details we show
is the back trace to where

00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:44.036 A:middle
that capture happened.

to navigate directly to the line

This API returns an
observation token

00:52:06.326 --> 00:52:08.536 A:middle
that I see I've properly
cleared up down here

00:52:08.536 --> 00:52:09.386 A:middle
when the view goes away,

00:52:09.786 --> 00:52:11.776 A:middle
but I never retained
it in the first place.

00:52:12.386 --> 00:52:14.026 A:middle
That's a common and
simple mistake to make.

00:52:14.516 --> 00:52:16.806 A:middle
It's also one the Memory
Debugger makes really easy

00:52:16.886 --> 00:52:18.136 A:middle
to find and fix.

00:52:19.686 --> 00:52:22.256 A:middle
Now, I mentioned before the
Memory Debugger also finds

00:52:22.316 --> 00:52:24.246 A:middle
leaks, and it's alerting
me to three I have

00:52:24.296 --> 00:52:25.386 A:middle
up here in the Activity view.

00:52:26.416 --> 00:52:28.746 A:middle
I'll click on that and be
taken to the Issue Navigator

00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:31.016 A:middle
where I see three types
of objects I'm leaking.

00:52:31.536 --> 00:52:34.366 A:middle
An array, user review,
and user objects.

00:52:35.426 --> 00:52:37.696 A:middle
I'll click on one of the
reviews, I'm sorry, the users,

00:52:37.936 --> 00:52:39.726 A:middle
and now we see the
reference cycle.

00:52:40.826 --> 00:52:43.596 A:middle
A user has an array of
written reviews, and each one

00:52:43.596 --> 00:52:46.526 A:middle
of those user reviews has a
reference back to that user.

00:52:47.286 --> 00:52:49.056 A:middle
If all these references
are strongly held,

00:52:49.456 --> 00:52:50.836 A:middle
this will leak all
over those objects.

00:52:52.016 --> 00:52:54.146 A:middle
Now, it looks like I'm
leaking them all uniformly.

00:52:54.636 --> 00:52:57.076 A:middle
If I wanted more details though
on any one of these objects,

00:52:57.346 --> 00:52:59.376 A:middle
I can use the context menu
to print something right

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.546 A:middle
to the console or just bring

up a quick look to
see more details.

00:53:05.096 --> 00:53:07.546 A:middle
Now, in this case, the reviewing
user relationship is the one I

00:53:07.546 --> 00:53:11.096 A:middle
want to investigate, and we'll
just navigate just like code.

00:53:11.096 --> 00:53:13.856 A:middle
I'll just command click on it
and be taken right to the line

00:53:13.856 --> 00:53:15.246 A:middle
of code where that
reference came from.

00:53:15.786 --> 00:53:18.026 A:middle
And sure enough, I forgot
to declare that as weak.

00:53:19.206 --> 00:53:20.786 A:middle
So just like that, the
Memory Debugger was able

00:53:20.786 --> 00:53:23.276 A:middle
to show me the leaks I
had and help me fix them.

to ensure they always
included actionable information

00:56:05.586 --> 00:56:08.406 A:middle
You no longer need to revoke
or share a certificate from any

00:56:08.406 --> 00:56:09.066 A:middle
of your other development.

00:56:10.516 --> 00:56:16.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:56:17.046 --> 00:56:20.096 A:middle
So the new provisioning system,
automatic and customized signing

00:56:20.256 --> 00:56:22.046 A:middle
and multiple development
certificates.

00:56:22.206 --> 00:56:24.896 A:middle
Always that Xcode 8
makes provisioning easy

00:56:25.296 --> 00:56:26.516 A:middle
and gives you the
control you need.

00:56:28.726 --> 00:56:30.736 A:middle
And in this release, we
focused on performance,

00:56:31.076 --> 00:56:32.636 A:middle
and we have some great
achievements for you.

00:56:33.686 --> 00:56:36.386 A:middle
Compared to the release we
shipped just a year ago,

00:56:36.606 --> 00:56:39.466 A:middle
you'll find Xcode launches
twice as fast all the way

00:56:39.466 --> 00:56:42.726 A:middle
up to being 50 times faster
at the indexing of tests.

00:56:43.516 --> 00:56:48.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:56:49.046 --> 00:56:50.916 A:middle
These improvements all add
up to make Xcode 8 something

00:56:50.916 --> 00:56:52.776 A:middle
that is fast and fun to use.

00:56:54.426 --> 00:56:56.096 A:middle
So these have been some
of the many features

00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:58.076 A:middle
and enhancements
you'll find in Xcode 8.

00:57:00.156 --> 00:57:01.506 A:middle
and let us know what you think.

00:57:02.506 --> 00:57:04.546 A:middle
Next, I'd like to invite
up Sebastien Marineau-Mes,

00:57:04.826 --> 00:57:06.826 A:middle
who's going to give you some
information about exciting,

00:57:06.826 --> 00:57:08.116 A:middle
new platform technologies.

00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:09.086 A:middle
Sebastien [applause]?

00:57:12.136 --> 00:57:13.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Matthew.

00:57:14.066 --> 00:57:14.426 A:middle
Thank you.

00:57:15.486 --> 00:57:17.556 A:middle
Let me now give an
update on a number of key,

00:57:17.556 --> 00:57:19.186 A:middle
foundational technologies,
and I'm going

00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:20.606 A:middle
to start with compression.

00:57:21.576 --> 00:57:24.816 A:middle
Now, if you recall, last
year, we introduced lzfse

00:57:24.816 --> 00:57:26.176 A:middle
as our new mainstream
compression.

00:57:26.636 --> 00:57:29.076 A:middle
At three times the
speed of zlib and less

00:57:29.076 --> 00:57:30.596 A:middle
than half the energy
consumption,

00:57:30.736 --> 00:57:32.176 A:middle
it's a really compelling
technology

00:57:32.496 --> 00:57:34.206 A:middle
and one that's seen
great adoption.

00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:36.586 A:middle
Now, today we're announcing

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:39.736 A:middle
that we're open-sourcing
lzfse, and we [applause]--

00:57:42.176 --> 00:57:43.966 A:middle
There you go.

00:57:44.066 --> 00:57:46.766 A:middle
And we believe that this will
encourage further adoption,

00:57:47.056 --> 00:57:48.526 A:middle
especially for multiplatform

00:57:48.526 --> 00:57:50.966 A:middle
and backhand offline
compression use cases.

00:57:51.946 --> 00:57:54.196 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
talk about networking.

00:57:55.636 --> 00:57:57.876 A:middle
Now, we know that
the performance

00:57:58.386 --> 00:57:59.986 A:middle
of some applications
really depends

00:57:59.986 --> 00:58:01.866 A:middle
on having a great
network connection,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:59.986 --> 00:58:01.866 A:middle
on having a great
network connection,

00:58:02.136 --> 00:58:04.546 A:middle
but today's networks don't
really have a great way

00:58:04.546 --> 00:58:06.516 A:middle
to prioritize the traffic
that's most important.

00:58:07.206 --> 00:58:10.276 A:middle
For example, people
downloading YouTube cat videos

00:58:10.926 --> 00:58:13.326 A:middle
at work can interfere
with your really important

00:58:13.326 --> 00:58:14.036 A:middle
video conference.

00:58:14.956 --> 00:58:17.996 A:middle
And so in working with Cisco,
we've added intelligence

00:58:17.996 --> 00:58:20.066 A:middle
to the network, and what
the network is now able

00:58:20.226 --> 00:58:22.906 A:middle
to do is identify
those trusted devices.

00:58:23.576 --> 00:58:26.846 A:middle
Identify those applications
that are most important

00:58:26.846 --> 00:58:30.866 A:middle
to your business, and then
prioritize that traffic end

00:58:30.866 --> 00:58:32.456 A:middle
to end throughout the network.

00:58:32.796 --> 00:58:34.466 A:middle
Which gives you much
better performance

00:58:34.566 --> 00:58:36.996 A:middle
for those applications that
are most important to you.

00:58:38.126 --> 00:58:38.916 A:middle
That is networking.

00:58:39.696 --> 00:58:40.026 A:middle
Next--

00:58:41.516 --> 00:58:43.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:58:44.346 --> 00:58:46.626 A:middle
Next, let's talk about logging.

00:58:47.286 --> 00:58:49.186 A:middle
Now, logging is a
technology that all

00:58:49.186 --> 00:58:52.056 A:middle
of you use during
development, debugging,

00:58:52.146 --> 00:58:53.396 A:middle
and for field diagnostics.

00:58:54.496 --> 00:58:57.076 A:middle
Traditionally, logging
has been very fragmented.

00:58:57.346 --> 00:58:59.646 A:middle
A number of you roll
your own solutions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:03.106 A:middle
The solutions that are available
in the platform are often slow,

00:59:03.436 --> 00:59:06.516 A:middle
and so this year, we've
set out to rethink logging,

00:59:07.096 --> 00:59:08.486 A:middle
and we've come up
with a technology

00:59:08.486 --> 00:59:09.886 A:middle
that we think is
very compelling.

00:59:10.536 --> 00:59:11.356 A:middle
It's unified.

00:59:11.606 --> 00:59:13.096 A:middle
It's extremely fast.

00:59:13.096 --> 00:59:15.476 A:middle
It's very compact on how
it stores data on disc.

00:59:16.176 --> 00:59:19.346 A:middle
It also gives you enough
flexibility to support logging

00:59:19.346 --> 00:59:22.536 A:middle
across applications,
daemons, system services.

00:59:22.986 --> 00:59:25.346 A:middle
It has this concept
of in-memory tracing

00:59:25.346 --> 00:59:28.496 A:middle
where you can capture very
high-frequency log messages

00:59:28.836 --> 00:59:30.356 A:middle
that only get persisted to disc

00:59:30.356 --> 00:59:33.126 A:middle
when your application
actually hits an air condition.

00:59:33.766 --> 00:59:36.446 A:middle
And finally, we've
baked privacy right in,

00:59:36.746 --> 00:59:39.496 A:middle
so you can capture very rich
log messages during development

00:59:39.796 --> 00:59:41.816 A:middle
and have those be
automatically redacted

00:59:42.066 --> 00:59:44.496 A:middle
when you ship your application
through end customers.

00:59:46.066 --> 00:59:46.946 A:middle
Now, along with this
[applause] --

00:59:49.166 --> 00:59:52.956 A:middle
We have rewritten the console
application it is much richer

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:53.646 A:middle
in capability.

00:59:53.646 --> 00:59:56.036 A:middle
It gives you, for example,
the ability to live stream

00:59:56.256 --> 00:59:59.576 A:middle
through development devices,
the ability to advance filtering

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:02.336 A:middle
and grade system
introspection capabilities,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:02.336 A:middle
and grade system
introspection capabilities,

01:00:02.856 --> 01:00:04.556 A:middle
so that is the new logging.

01:00:05.406 --> 01:00:06.836 A:middle
Next up--

01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:09.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:12.786 A:middle
Next up, let's talk
about file systems.

01:00:12.786 --> 01:00:13.666 A:middle
All right.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:20.886 A:middle
Now, of course, HFS Plus is the
mainstream file system on Macs,

01:00:21.386 --> 01:00:24.116 A:middle
and it was first
released in 1998.

01:00:24.766 --> 01:00:27.836 A:middle
Today it's deployed
across every Apple product,

01:00:28.056 --> 01:00:30.126 A:middle
over a billion devices.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:35.116 A:middle
And of course, HFS Plus was
designed over 18 years ago,

01:00:35.496 --> 01:00:37.816 A:middle
and I think it's really a
testament to the strength

01:00:37.816 --> 01:00:40.216 A:middle
of its original design that
it's still a compelling file

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:40.956 A:middle
system today.

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:43.926 A:middle
But of course, when it was
designed, we had floppy drives

01:00:43.926 --> 01:00:48.786 A:middle
on Macs, and so we thought
now may be the time for us

01:00:48.786 --> 01:00:50.546 A:middle
to launch a new file system.

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:54.676 A:middle
And so today we're announcing
brand new Apple File System.

01:00:55.516 --> 01:01:01.166 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:01.926 A:middle
There you go.

01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:03.466 A:middle
I thought you guys
might be excited by this

01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:05.016 A:middle
or the crowd might be excited.

01:01:05.306 --> 01:01:08.006 A:middle
Now, the Apple File
System is scalable

01:01:08.006 --> 01:01:11.056 A:middle
from our smallest device, the
watch, to high-end Mac Pros

01:01:11.056 --> 01:01:12.716 A:middle
with very large storage
configurations.

01:01:13.606 --> 01:01:14.656 A:middle
It's also modern.

01:01:14.656 --> 01:01:16.746 A:middle
We designed it first
and foremost for today

01:01:16.746 --> 01:01:19.586 A:middle
and tomorrow's storage
technologies, Flash and SSD.

01:01:19.586 --> 01:01:22.486 A:middle
It's resilient and we've
used the opportunity

01:01:22.486 --> 01:01:25.976 A:middle
to unify encryption
across iOS and Mac OS,

01:01:26.156 --> 01:01:28.466 A:middle
which gives us great
flexibility going forward.

01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:32.456 A:middle
Now, the Apple File System has a
number of new, unique features,

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:34.366 A:middle
and I want to highlight
two of them for you.

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.916 A:middle
The first is called cloning.

01:01:37.316 --> 01:01:38.096 A:middle
Now, why cloning?

01:01:38.626 --> 01:01:40.686 A:middle
It turns out that if you look
at a system that's been running

01:01:40.756 --> 01:01:43.726 A:middle
for a while, you'll find many
duplicates of identical files.

01:01:43.726 --> 01:01:45.796 A:middle
It's kind of human nature
to copy things around.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:47.936 A:middle
That's of course inefficient.

01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:49.356 A:middle
It uses up storage space.

01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:53.136 A:middle
But with clones, you're able
to copy files and only pay

01:01:53.136 --> 01:01:56.106 A:middle
for that initial storage when
the files are actually modified.

01:01:56.776 --> 01:01:59.816 A:middle
It's very fast and you can
clone files, directories,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:02:00.126 --> 01:02:01.106 A:middle
and directory hierarchies.

01:02:02.416 --> 01:02:03.596 A:middle
The second feature that I want

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:05.476 A:middle
to highlight is called
Snapshots.

01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:06.736 A:middle
Now, what are Snapshots?

01:02:07.286 --> 01:02:08.716 A:middle
They're really an
image of the content

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:10.556 A:middle
of the file system
at a point in time.

01:02:11.366 --> 01:02:12.326 A:middle
Why would you want this?

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:15.036 A:middle
Well, let's say you're
creating a backup application.

01:02:15.616 --> 01:02:18.746 A:middle
Using Snapshots, you can go
and back up a consistent view

01:02:18.746 --> 01:02:20.486 A:middle
of the file system
at a point in time.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:24.176 A:middle
Another great example of
where this is useful is

01:02:24.176 --> 01:02:24.886 A:middle
in the classroom.

01:02:25.546 --> 01:02:28.426 A:middle
You may set up a device for
your students that has content,

01:02:28.486 --> 01:02:30.246 A:middle
configuration files,
applications,

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.926 A:middle
and so on that you're going
to use during a class.

01:02:32.476 --> 01:02:34.416 A:middle
As the students use a device,

01:02:34.956 --> 01:02:37.716 A:middle
they may inadvertently modify
the content or the settings,

01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:39.716 A:middle
and what you can do is you
can use Snapshots at the end

01:02:39.716 --> 01:02:42.456 A:middle
of the class to revert
the device back

01:02:42.456 --> 01:02:44.516 A:middle
to its original state
so that it's ready

01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:45.676 A:middle
for the next class of students.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:49.876 A:middle
Now, these are features of
the new Apple File System

01:02:50.406 --> 01:02:52.116 A:middle
with a developer
preview of it that's part

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:55.676 A:middle
of the Mac OS Sierra release
available to you today.

01:02:55.676 --> 01:02:57.966 A:middle
We'd encourage you all to
download it, check it out,

01:02:57.966 --> 01:03:00.846 A:middle
give us feedback, and the Apple
File System will be coming

give us feedback, and the Apple
File System will be coming

01:03:00.886 --> 01:03:02.886 A:middle
to all Apple devices soon.

[ Applause ]

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:09.296 A:middle
All right.

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:13.466 A:middle
Finally, let's talk
about privacy.

01:03:14.096 --> 01:03:16.536 A:middle
You heard about a new, powerful
technique called differential

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.796 A:middle
privacy in this morning's
keynote, and I will attempt

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:21.446 A:middle
to explain that to you.

01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:25.506 A:middle
I will start with the formal
math behind differential privacy

01:03:27.636 --> 01:03:30.906 A:middle
and remind, just note that
while it does look complex,

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:32.766 A:middle
I can guarantee you the
math actually works.

01:03:32.766 --> 01:03:34.816 A:middle
And I'm going to actually
instead explain it

01:03:34.816 --> 01:03:36.346 A:middle
to you using a couple
of examples.

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:38.536 A:middle
So the first example
is we're going

01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:41.046 A:middle
to use differential privacy
to try to resolve once

01:03:41.046 --> 01:03:43.466 A:middle
and for all one of
the most controversial

01:03:43.466 --> 01:03:44.376 A:middle
and important questions

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:48.446 A:middle
of modern computer science
code formatting [laughter].

01:03:51.066 --> 01:03:52.666 A:middle
This is of course an
important question.

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:55.706 A:middle
We're going to poll our audience
to get the answer to this.

01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:58.496 A:middle
It's also something that is
where you want your answer

01:03:58.496 --> 01:04:00.816 A:middle
to remain private
because let's face it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:03:58.496 --> 01:04:00.816 A:middle
to remain private
because let's face it,

01:04:01.126 --> 01:04:03.426 A:middle
some of your coworkers may be
pretty passionate about this.

01:04:04.266 --> 01:04:07.236 A:middle
So how do we do this using
differential privacy?

01:04:07.236 --> 01:04:10.176 A:middle
Well, first, each of you
would provide your preference,

01:04:11.246 --> 01:04:13.996 A:middle
but before we send that over to
Apple to aggregate the results

01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:16.456 A:middle
of the survey, through
differential privacy,

01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:18.176 A:middle
we add noise to each answer.

01:04:18.326 --> 01:04:20.756 A:middle
And after we've added noise,
we actually have no way

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:21.996 A:middle
to know what you
originally answered.

01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:24.716 A:middle
We send this to Apple,
and the beauty

01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:28.116 A:middle
of differential privacy is that
after we aggregate this data

01:04:28.116 --> 01:04:30.356 A:middle
over a large population,
we're actually able

01:04:30.356 --> 01:04:32.746 A:middle
to recover the answer
to our question.

01:04:32.746 --> 01:04:34.646 A:middle
Now, I'm not going
to pass judgment

01:04:34.646 --> 01:04:36.636 A:middle
on this, the actual answer.

01:04:36.636 --> 01:04:38.756 A:middle
It looks like of course
we're still very divided

01:04:38.756 --> 01:04:41.876 A:middle
in our opinions on this,
but I will remind everyone

01:04:41.876 --> 01:04:43.576 A:middle
that after you've run your
code through the compiler,

01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:48.576 A:middle
this doesn't actually really
matter, so [laughter] that's --

01:04:49.516 --> 01:04:53.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:04:54.046 --> 01:04:56.316 A:middle
Now, how are we actually
applying differential privacy

01:04:56.316 --> 01:04:57.036 A:middle
in iOS X?

01:04:57.036 --> 01:04:58.256 A:middle
Let me give an example of this.

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:01.856 A:middle
In Spotlight, we provide
suggestions for deep links


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:01.856 A:middle
In Spotlight, we provide
suggestions for deep links

01:05:02.186 --> 01:05:05.646 A:middle
and we'd of course like to
surface the most relevant

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:08.026 A:middle
and popular suggestions
to our end users.

01:05:09.236 --> 01:05:11.956 A:middle
And so the way that we do
this, we assign to each

01:05:11.956 --> 01:05:15.166 A:middle
of our deep links a unique
hash, and as users navigate

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:18.066 A:middle
on their device, whenever
they encounter a deep link,

01:05:18.506 --> 01:05:21.826 A:middle
we take that hash, add noise
to it, extract a fragment

01:05:21.826 --> 01:05:23.506 A:middle
of it, and send it to Apple.

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:25.516 A:middle
Now, any one of these fragments

01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:27.446 A:middle
on their own is completely
meaningless,

01:05:28.286 --> 01:05:31.166 A:middle
but when we aggregate this
across our entire user base,

01:05:31.586 --> 01:05:34.546 A:middle
we're able to recover the
popularity of our deep links

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.866 A:middle
and then use that to
surface them in Spotlight

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.266 A:middle
and improve our user's
experience.

01:05:40.476 --> 01:05:44.966 A:middle
That is the science behind
differential privacy.

01:05:45.256 --> 01:05:47.486 A:middle
There's one more aspect of it
though that I want to touch on.

01:05:48.096 --> 01:05:51.656 A:middle
You might think, well, if we're
capturing samples from users

01:05:51.796 --> 01:05:54.426 A:middle
and this works by capturing
many samples from many users,

01:05:54.836 --> 01:05:58.596 A:middle
what happens if Apple captures
too many samples from one user?

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.866 A:middle
Could you not then
figure out what I'm doing?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.866 A:middle
Could you not then
figure out what I'm doing?

01:06:01.516 --> 01:06:03.846 A:middle
And this is where the
privacy budget comes in.

01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:06.996 A:middle
The privacy budget limits
the amount of samples

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.956 A:middle
that we can capture from any
given user and it ensures

01:06:09.956 --> 01:06:12.166 A:middle
that in the end, we can
never recover any meaningful

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:14.236 A:middle
information from any
one of our users.

01:06:15.396 --> 01:06:16.936 A:middle
So that is differential privacy.

01:06:16.936 --> 01:06:19.706 A:middle
It's a powerful technique
that allows us to learn

01:06:19.706 --> 01:06:22.256 A:middle
from our users, improve
user experience,

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:24.576 A:middle
and still maintain your privacy.

01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:29.006 A:middle
So with this, I'm going to hand
it over to Toby, Toby Paterson,

01:06:29.006 --> 01:06:32.006 A:middle
who will be talking about
higher level features in iOS X.

01:06:32.186 --> 01:06:32.626 A:middle
Toby?

01:06:32.716 --> 01:06:33.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sebastien.

01:06:35.516 --> 01:06:39.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:06:40.236 --> 01:06:40.906 A:middle
Good afternoon.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:46.736 A:middle
There we go.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:52.186 A:middle
So, you know, it's really thanks
to all of you that we have

01:06:52.246 --> 01:06:57.396 A:middle
such a rich ecosystem on iOS,
and we are constantly looking

01:06:57.396 --> 01:07:00.746 A:middle
for new ways to help
users find applications,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:06:57.396 --> 01:07:00.746 A:middle
for new ways to help
users find applications,

01:07:01.336 --> 01:07:03.536 A:middle
get into the apps
they like to use,

01:07:03.996 --> 01:07:05.976 A:middle
and to integrate
your applications

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:07.266 A:middle
across the rest of the OS.

01:07:07.266 --> 01:07:12.966 A:middle
You saw earlier how your
app can propagate virally

01:07:13.536 --> 01:07:16.566 A:middle
through messages, and
we're making it really easy

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.976 A:middle
to tell people about your
application right here

01:07:20.006 --> 01:07:20.906 A:middle
from the home screen.

01:07:22.566 --> 01:07:25.596 A:middle
We've added a new Share button
to the Quick Actions List.

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:27.806 A:middle
This brings up the Share Sheet,

01:07:28.186 --> 01:07:31.246 A:middle
and so now you can Tweet your
application to the whole world,

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:33.836 A:middle
and this is available for
free in every application.

01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:39.806 A:middle
Now, we have a lot of ways
that we try to get users

01:07:40.016 --> 01:07:42.446 A:middle
into the right app at
just the right time.

01:07:42.556 --> 01:07:45.346 A:middle
I'm going to move through them
quickly, so bear with me here.

01:07:47.556 --> 01:07:51.556 A:middle
Handoff lets you carry on a
task from one device to another.

01:07:52.306 --> 01:07:55.616 A:middle
Spotlight can link directly
to your application content.

01:07:56.006 --> 01:07:59.436 A:middle
A Universal Link will take you
to the most appropriate place

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:02.066 A:middle
for a platform, and
you can link directly


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:02.066 A:middle
for a platform, and
you can link directly

01:08:02.066 --> 01:08:04.846 A:middle
from one application to another.

01:08:05.606 --> 01:08:09.466 A:middle
Siri will suggest apps here in
Today view and in Spotlight.

01:08:09.926 --> 01:08:12.256 A:middle
We can suggest an app
at just the right time

01:08:12.516 --> 01:08:14.786 A:middle
in the App Switcher
on the lock screen.

01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:17.956 A:middle
We can connect apps based
on common data types

01:08:18.036 --> 01:08:21.345 A:middle
like this and this and this.

01:08:22.336 --> 01:08:23.656 A:middle
Well, I think you get the idea.

01:08:24.216 --> 01:08:27.046 A:middle
There's only one thing I really
want you to take away from all

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:31.506 A:middle
of this, which is that
NSUserActivity is your gateway

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:33.316 A:middle
to a whole ton of functionality.

01:08:34.196 --> 01:08:38.036 A:middle
It's how your application tells
the OS what people are doing

01:08:38.036 --> 01:08:40.086 A:middle
in your app, and that allows us

01:08:40.086 --> 01:08:43.095 A:middle
to create intelligent
suggestions and connections

01:08:43.156 --> 01:08:44.736 A:middle
between your applications.

01:08:45.906 --> 01:08:49.935 A:middle
And in iOS X, we're adding two
important pieces of information.

01:08:51.446 --> 01:08:55.136 A:middle
Now, many apps use addresses
in a variety of ways,

01:08:55.486 --> 01:08:57.666 A:middle
and we can use that
to make connections

01:08:57.876 --> 01:08:59.466 A:middle
between your applications.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:00.216 --> 01:09:02.536 A:middle
Let me illustrate
with an example.

01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:05.185 A:middle
This is the Yelp page for one

01:09:05.185 --> 01:09:08.156 A:middle
of my favorite restaurants
in San Francisco.

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:11.586 A:middle
Now, suppose it were to
provide an NSUserActivity

01:09:11.996 --> 01:09:13.975 A:middle
with this address on it.

01:09:14.136 --> 01:09:15.515 A:middle
That would allow me to do things

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:18.916 A:middle
like asking Siri to
just take me here.

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:23.376 A:middle
My phone knows that I use
Uber a lot to get around,

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.656 A:middle
and it can make it
really easy for me

01:09:25.656 --> 01:09:28.566 A:middle
to order a ride directly
to the restaurant.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:33.595 A:middle
Or when I'm typing in a text
field that's expecting location

01:09:33.595 --> 01:09:37.666 A:middle
data, QuickType can suggest an
address that I was just looking

01:09:37.666 --> 01:09:42.866 A:middle
at and Maps can include that in
its list of suggestions along

01:09:42.866 --> 01:09:45.895 A:middle
with a quick way of getting
back into the application.

01:09:48.095 --> 01:09:51.116 A:middle
Now, we also interact with
people in a variety of ways,

01:09:51.116 --> 01:09:54.966 A:middle
and the OS can learn which
app I use to communicate

01:09:55.086 --> 01:09:56.276 A:middle
with any given person.

01:09:57.196 --> 01:09:58.856 A:middle
To do this, your app needs

01:09:58.856 --> 01:10:00.726 A:middle
to give us three
pieces of information.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:58.856 --> 01:10:00.726 A:middle
to give us three
pieces of information.

01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:03.976 A:middle
Enough context so that
we can find an entry

01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:07.636 A:middle
in the address book for this
person, the kind of service

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:11.436 A:middle
that you're providing, that's a
messages or video chat platform,

01:10:11.796 --> 01:10:14.356 A:middle
and the specific
identifier or handle

01:10:14.526 --> 01:10:17.756 A:middle
that you'll use for this person.

01:10:18.136 --> 01:10:20.416 A:middle
Now, this is the new
Address Book card,

01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:23.866 A:middle
which we're making available a
lot more prominently throughout

01:10:24.426 --> 01:10:26.836 A:middle
the OS, and you'll notice that
we can automatically include

01:10:26.836 --> 01:10:30.186 A:middle
in here information that we
learned from your applications.

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:35.406 A:middle
Now, when I tap on one of these
new Quick Communication buttons

01:10:35.526 --> 01:10:38.866 A:middle
at the top of the card, we
can also include your app

01:10:39.116 --> 01:10:40.516 A:middle
in the list of options.

01:10:41.326 --> 01:10:44.726 A:middle
When I make my choice,
we'll remember that so

01:10:44.726 --> 01:10:47.176 A:middle
that the next time
when I tap this button,

01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:50.426 A:middle
we can take you straight
into the application.

01:10:51.286 --> 01:10:54.706 A:middle
I should point out that all
of this learning is private

01:10:54.706 --> 01:10:57.826 A:middle
to the user and accessible
only on their devices.

01:11:00.676 --> 01:11:04.576 A:middle
Now, we deeply believe
that integrating your apps

01:11:04.576 --> 01:11:09.396 A:middle
across the OS makes for a
much richer user experience.

01:11:10.196 --> 01:11:12.366 A:middle
Extensions, of course,
are how you do that,

01:11:12.366 --> 01:11:15.296 A:middle
and you've heard earlier
about the new iMessage Apps,

01:11:15.496 --> 01:11:17.766 A:middle
Maps extensions, and SiriKit.

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:20.426 A:middle
Well, I'd like to
tell you a little bit

01:11:20.426 --> 01:11:24.186 A:middle
about two extension points that
we're adding to Notifications.

01:11:25.766 --> 01:11:29.246 A:middle
A service extension runs in
the background and allows you

01:11:29.246 --> 01:11:33.266 A:middle
to modify the push payload
before we show the notification

01:11:33.266 --> 01:11:33.976 A:middle
to the user.

01:11:34.766 --> 01:11:38.416 A:middle
It lets you do things like
downloading an image, a video,

01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:40.406 A:middle
or an audio file
in the background

01:11:40.716 --> 01:11:43.206 A:middle
and embedding it directly
in the notification.

01:11:44.236 --> 01:11:48.426 A:middle
Or you could encrypt your
push payload on your server

01:11:48.526 --> 01:11:52.086 A:middle
and use a service extension to
decrypt it locally on device,

01:11:52.626 --> 01:11:55.176 A:middle
providing for full
end-to-end encryption.

01:11:56.516 --> 01:11:59.096 A:middle

Now, I should point
out you may want

01:12:01.146 --> 01:12:02.716 A:middle
to use something
a little stronger

01:12:02.716 --> 01:12:05.516 A:middle
than the ROT13 algorithm
that we're proposing here.

01:12:06.066 --> 01:12:08.386 A:middle
We're going to double
ROT13 it next year

01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:09.546 A:middle
for extra security [laughter].

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:18.736 A:middle
Now, if you want an even
richer user experience,

01:12:19.186 --> 01:12:23.226 A:middle
a content extension can provide
an arbitrary view that we'll use

01:12:23.226 --> 01:12:25.516 A:middle
for the expanded look
of a notification.

01:12:26.236 --> 01:12:27.906 A:middle
This lets you provide a dynamic

01:12:27.906 --> 01:12:31.116 A:middle
and interactive experience
that's really tailored

01:12:31.116 --> 01:12:32.236 A:middle
to your application.

01:12:35.496 --> 01:12:38.826 A:middle
This morning, you got a quick
tour of the revamped Today view

01:12:38.996 --> 01:12:41.466 A:middle
with its vibrant,
new look for widgets.

01:12:41.856 --> 01:12:45.106 A:middle
Now, a widget can still
be any size you want

01:12:45.156 --> 01:12:48.696 A:middle
within reasonable limits,
but we're also adding a new,

01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:53.236 A:middle
compact, fixed size to optimize
for better information density.

01:12:53.776 --> 01:12:55.926 A:middle
And the thing that
we're really excited

01:12:55.926 --> 01:12:59.276 A:middle
about is making these
widgets available right here

01:12:59.276 --> 01:13:00.246 A:middle
from the home screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:12:59.276 --> 01:13:00.246 A:middle
from the home screen.

01:13:00.956 --> 01:13:02.436 A:middle
I'm going to tell you
what you need to do

01:13:02.436 --> 01:13:05.176 A:middle
to get this functionality
in your widgets.

01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:09.346 A:middle
The first thing you want to do
is probably update your look

01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:11.206 A:middle
and support the new compact size

01:13:11.206 --> 01:13:12.926 A:middle
so that your widget
doesn't look too funny.

01:13:14.116 --> 01:13:19.246 A:middle
You need to build with the
iOS X SDK, and that's it.

01:13:19.426 --> 01:13:22.626 A:middle
Nothing else has changed about
how you build your widgets.

01:13:23.086 --> 01:13:25.326 A:middle
You just get this new
functionality for free,

01:13:25.616 --> 01:13:26.936 A:middle
and so we're really excited.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.226 A:middle
We think this is going to
open up a whole new dimension

01:13:29.726 --> 01:13:30.946 A:middle
into your application.

01:13:33.156 --> 01:13:35.896 A:middle
Okay, let's switch gears
now and talk about the Mac.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:41.816 A:middle
So Mac OS Sierra is adding full
support for localizing your apps

01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:46.206 A:middle
in right-to-left languages,
including reversing UI elements

01:13:46.206 --> 01:13:47.756 A:middle
in places where that
makes sense.

01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:52.446 A:middle
The Mac now joins
with iOS and watchOS,

01:13:52.446 --> 01:13:56.156 A:middle
which quietly introduced support
for this earlier in the year.

01:13:57.056 --> 01:14:00.886 A:middle
And with so many potential
customers all over the world,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:13:57.056 --> 01:14:00.886 A:middle
And with so many potential
customers all over the world,

01:14:01.126 --> 01:14:03.826 A:middle
it's really more important
now than ever before

01:14:03.996 --> 01:14:07.376 A:middle
that your app be properly
localized and internationalized.

01:14:07.916 --> 01:14:09.646 A:middle
And you can learn
more about that here.

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:15.316 A:middle
Now, you know, when Sebastien
first started talking about tabs

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:17.336 A:middle
versus spaces, we were
pretty sure this was

01:14:17.366 --> 01:14:18.306 A:middle
where he was going.

01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:22.396 A:middle
You saw this morning how
people can gather together all

01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:25.176 A:middle
of their windows into
a single tabbed UI.

01:14:26.246 --> 01:14:29.906 A:middle
AppKit will take care of pretty
much everything here for you

01:14:29.906 --> 01:14:32.656 A:middle
and it's smart enough not to
pair your preferences windows

01:14:32.656 --> 01:14:35.686 A:middle
with your document windows,
and so on and so forth.

01:14:36.236 --> 01:14:38.256 A:middle
And in fact, if you're
using NSDocument,

01:14:38.256 --> 01:14:40.856 A:middle
there really is nothing
else that you need

01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:42.176 A:middle
to do in your application.

01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:45.956 A:middle
If you're not using
NSDocument, there's a little bit

01:14:45.956 --> 01:14:48.776 A:middle
of API you need to adopt to
support creating a new tab,

01:14:49.246 --> 01:14:51.106 A:middle
but I'd really encourage
you to take a look

01:14:51.106 --> 01:14:54.696 A:middle
at whether NSDocument isn't
appropriate for your use case.

01:14:55.896 --> 01:14:59.476 A:middle
You see, we also showed you this
morning how we're making it easy

01:14:59.476 --> 01:15:01.736 A:middle
for people to move their
documents and their data


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:14:59.476 --> 01:15:01.736 A:middle
for people to move their
documents and their data

01:15:02.246 --> 01:15:04.376 A:middle
into the cloud, and
we really believe

01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:06.906 A:middle
that this is the
future of file storage.

01:15:07.866 --> 01:15:12.276 A:middle
So it's super important that
your app adopt best practices

01:15:12.726 --> 01:15:15.856 A:middle
in terms of file
coordination and metadata query.

01:15:16.716 --> 01:15:20.586 A:middle
And here too if you're using
NSDocument, it will take care

01:15:20.586 --> 01:15:22.916 A:middle
of pretty much all the
heavy lifting for you,

01:15:23.126 --> 01:15:27.186 A:middle
along with UIDocument
as counterpart on iOS.

01:15:29.076 --> 01:15:32.016 A:middle
Now, I have an important
update for you about iCloud.

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:35.016 A:middle
As you know, the iCloud
APIs are available on all

01:15:35.016 --> 01:15:39.006 A:middle
of our platforms,
but on the Mac,

01:15:39.576 --> 01:15:42.906 A:middle
use of these APIs has
been restricted just

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:45.856 A:middle
to those apps distributed
via the Mac App Store.

01:15:46.866 --> 01:15:50.646 A:middle
Well, in Mac OS Sierra, we're
removing that restriction.

01:15:51.516 --> 01:15:57.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:15:58.276 --> 01:15:59.806 A:middle
Now, your app still
needs to be signed

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:02.856 A:middle
with a valid developer ID, which
by the way, will also get rid


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:02.856 A:middle
with a valid developer ID, which
by the way, will also get rid

01:16:02.856 --> 01:16:05.546 A:middle
of those pesky, untrusted
developer alerts.

01:16:06.116 --> 01:16:08.536 A:middle
But once you've done
that, you can use all

01:16:08.536 --> 01:16:11.096 A:middle
of these API no matter how
you distribute your app

01:16:11.246 --> 01:16:12.286 A:middle
to your customers.

01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:16.376 A:middle
Next, CloudKit.

01:16:17.526 --> 01:16:20.806 A:middle
We introduced CloudKit two years
ago, and it's the foundation

01:16:20.806 --> 01:16:24.426 A:middle
that we use for building all
of our new cloud services.

01:16:25.216 --> 01:16:28.096 A:middle
Now, it has a fairly
coarse-grained permission model.

01:16:28.826 --> 01:16:32.116 A:middle
Either your data could
be accessed by everybody

01:16:32.116 --> 01:16:36.246 A:middle
in the world or it's restricted
to just a single user.

01:16:37.456 --> 01:16:40.616 A:middle
Well, the new CloudKit
sharing feature opens that up

01:16:40.616 --> 01:16:42.626 A:middle
and gives your app
explicit control

01:16:42.626 --> 01:16:44.386 A:middle
over who can access your data.

01:16:45.516 --> 01:16:50.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:16:51.126 --> 01:16:56.856 A:middle
The new CKShare class gives
you a, governs the permissions,

01:16:56.856 --> 01:16:59.096 A:middle
who can read and write
a given set of records,

01:16:59.196 --> 01:17:02.866 A:middle
and this API is available
on all of our platforms.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:16:59.196 --> 01:17:02.866 A:middle
and this API is available
on all of our platforms.

01:17:04.106 --> 01:17:08.016 A:middle
On the Mac and on iOS,
we're providing standard UI

01:17:08.016 --> 01:17:11.696 A:middle
for taking care of the
mechanics of inviting people

01:17:11.696 --> 01:17:14.286 A:middle
and managing people
in your application.

01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:19.626 A:middle
We use CloudKit sharing for
the new collaboration features

01:17:19.666 --> 01:17:22.776 A:middle
that we've built into Notes,
and I encourage you to check it

01:17:22.776 --> 01:17:24.686 A:middle
out in the developer
preview today.

01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:27.926 A:middle
With that, I'd like to hand off

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:28.576 A:middle
to Josh Shaffer [assumed
spelling],

01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:30.756 A:middle
who's going to give you
some updates on watchOS.

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:31.546 A:middle
Thank you.

01:17:32.516 --> 01:17:37.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:17:38.276 --> 01:17:38.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Toby.

01:17:40.236 --> 01:17:44.076 A:middle
As you heard in the keynote,
watchOS 3 simplifies navigation

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.616 A:middle
and optimizes performance.

01:17:46.816 --> 01:17:49.596 A:middle
These improvements go
beyond just the system level

01:17:49.746 --> 01:17:52.156 A:middle
and include many enhancements
to the apps as well.

01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:54.786 A:middle
These enhancements focus

01:17:54.856 --> 01:17:57.436 A:middle
on three key qualities
for Watch apps.

01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:00.416 A:middle
The first is that
they be glanceable.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:00.416 A:middle
The first is that
they be glanceable.

01:18:01.246 --> 01:18:03.916 A:middle
Individual interactions
with Apple Watch are short,

01:18:04.456 --> 01:18:06.486 A:middle
so it's important to
present well-designed,

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:09.506 A:middle
simple information to
the user, focusing just

01:18:09.506 --> 01:18:13.316 A:middle
on what's most relevant to make
sure that it's easy to digest.

01:18:14.686 --> 01:18:16.366 A:middle
The second is that
they be actionable.

01:18:16.366 --> 01:18:19.156 A:middle
Now, this includes
simplifying access

01:18:19.156 --> 01:18:21.556 A:middle
to the most common actions
taken on the watch itself.

01:18:22.486 --> 01:18:25.146 A:middle
For example, we've
redesigned the Fitness app

01:18:25.146 --> 01:18:27.696 A:middle
to reduce the number of steps
necessary to start a workout.

01:18:28.926 --> 01:18:32.226 A:middle
It also means simplifying
access to key information

01:18:32.226 --> 01:18:34.596 A:middle
that your users will
want to act on even

01:18:34.596 --> 01:18:36.626 A:middle
if they won't take the
action on the watch itself.

01:18:36.626 --> 01:18:41.076 A:middle
And the third is ensuring that
your apps remain responsive

01:18:41.436 --> 01:18:43.526 A:middle
by keeping them up to
date and ready to act

01:18:43.526 --> 01:18:44.746 A:middle
as soon as they're needed.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:48.586 A:middle
Sure, thanks [laughs].

01:18:48.946 --> 01:18:53.656 A:middle
I agree. Okay, so when you think
about an app, the first thing

01:18:53.656 --> 01:18:56.516 A:middle
that may come to mind is an app
that takes up the full screen.

01:18:56.516 --> 01:18:59.786 A:middle
Now, that's definitely part
of it, but on Apple Watch,

01:18:59.786 --> 01:19:02.236 A:middle
it's important to keep in
mind that your app has access


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:18:59.786 --> 01:19:02.236 A:middle
it's important to keep in
mind that your app has access

01:19:02.306 --> 01:19:04.846 A:middle
to two other great
interfaces in the form

01:19:04.846 --> 01:19:06.916 A:middle
of complications
and notifications.

01:19:08.046 --> 01:19:11.016 A:middle
So these three interfaces are
just three different views

01:19:11.016 --> 01:19:13.396 A:middle
into your one app,
so it's important

01:19:13.396 --> 01:19:15.116 A:middle
that they present
consistent information.

01:19:15.906 --> 01:19:18.536 A:middle
When you update any one of
them, you'll want to update all

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:20.496 A:middle
of them because if they're
displaying different

01:19:20.496 --> 01:19:23.906 A:middle
information, then your users
won't trust any of them.

01:19:24.706 --> 01:19:27.266 A:middle
Now, you may remember
that in watchOS 2,

01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:28.866 A:middle
there was a fourth
interface called Glances.

01:19:29.956 --> 01:19:33.236 A:middle
Glances provided
simple access to the,

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:35.236 A:middle
a summary of your
favorite apps' information.

01:19:36.416 --> 01:19:39.926 A:middle
In watchOS 3, this functionality
is now provided by the new Dock

01:19:39.926 --> 01:19:42.616 A:middle
and is instantly
accessible from anywhere

01:19:42.616 --> 01:19:44.526 A:middle
with just a press
of the side button.

01:19:45.746 --> 01:19:48.226 A:middle
If your watchOS 2 app
included a Glance,

01:19:48.436 --> 01:19:51.786 A:middle
that separate interface is no
longer necessary in watchOS 3,

01:19:52.236 --> 01:19:55.466 A:middle
but its simple design can help
you update the primary interface

01:19:55.466 --> 01:19:57.786 A:middle
for your application to
make sure that it looks

01:19:57.786 --> 01:20:00.106 A:middle
and works great when
viewed from the Dock.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:19:57.786 --> 01:20:00.106 A:middle
and works great when
viewed from the Dock.

01:20:01.526 --> 01:20:04.936 A:middle
Apps in the Dock are instantly
responsive, helping to make sure

01:20:04.936 --> 01:20:07.976 A:middle
that the most common tasks taken
on the watch can be accomplished

01:20:08.076 --> 01:20:09.936 A:middle
in just a couple of seconds.

01:20:10.426 --> 01:20:13.206 A:middle
Now, that's obviously a very
short time, but striving

01:20:13.266 --> 01:20:15.016 A:middle
for it can be a great guide

01:20:15.056 --> 01:20:18.186 A:middle
in helping you design the
top-level features of your apps

01:20:18.186 --> 01:20:20.856 A:middle
to make sure that they work
really well on Apple Watch.

01:20:22.616 --> 01:20:24.546 A:middle
While each individual
interaction is short,

01:20:24.926 --> 01:20:26.746 A:middle
some apps may be
used multiple times

01:20:26.866 --> 01:20:28.256 A:middle
over a longer period of time.

01:20:29.106 --> 01:20:30.746 A:middle
For example, I may refer back

01:20:30.746 --> 01:20:33.216 A:middle
to my shopping list many
times while I'm at the store.

01:20:34.416 --> 01:20:36.696 A:middle
In watchOS 3, each
time I raise my wrist,

01:20:36.696 --> 01:20:39.576 A:middle
I can instantly see the
items I still need to get

01:20:39.576 --> 01:20:41.696 A:middle
and check off the ones
I've already picked up.

01:20:42.386 --> 01:20:44.816 A:middle
It's now really easy to design
apps that have this kind

01:20:44.816 --> 01:20:47.896 A:middle
of interaction model because
watchOS 3 will return you

01:20:47.896 --> 01:20:50.876 A:middle

using for up to 8 minutes

Once you're done using it,

01:20:53.966 --> 01:20:54.996 A:middle

When your app's not in use,

01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:05.906 A:middle
ensuring that it stays
responsive means keeping it

01:21:05.906 --> 01:21:07.756 A:middle
up to date in the
background so that it's ready

01:21:07.756 --> 01:21:09.516 A:middle
when you do want to use it.

01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:11.336 A:middle
To make this really easy,

01:21:11.436 --> 01:21:13.586 A:middle
watchOS 3 includes
a brand new set

01:21:13.586 --> 01:21:16.026 A:middle
of Background App Refresh APIs.

01:21:16.386 --> 01:21:18.386 A:middle
Background App Refresh
is a critical part

01:21:18.386 --> 01:21:20.656 A:middle
of building responsive
watchOS applications,

01:21:21.236 --> 01:21:22.836 A:middle
and periodically
updating your app

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:25.796 A:middle
in the background can be a great
enhancement no matter what type

01:21:25.796 --> 01:21:26.556 A:middle
of app you're building.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:30.336 A:middle
Now, if you're building a
fitness app, for these types

01:21:30.336 --> 01:21:32.586 A:middle
of apps, it's even more
important that they remain

01:21:32.586 --> 01:21:35.306 A:middle
up to date for the entire
duration of the workout,

01:21:35.386 --> 01:21:37.836 A:middle
so we have some additional
enhancements just for them.

01:21:39.176 --> 01:21:42.566 A:middle
During a workout session, these
apps will now run continually

01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:44.776 A:middle
in the background even
while the screen is off,

01:21:45.286 --> 01:21:47.186 A:middle
ensuring that they can
monitor workout progress

01:21:47.216 --> 01:21:48.916 A:middle
and provide updates to the user

01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:53.356 A:middle
when they reach key
milestones using haptics.

01:21:53.946 --> 01:21:57.076 A:middle
During the workout, they also
remain instantly available even

01:21:57.076 --> 01:21:59.226 A:middle
if you switch to another
app to perform another task.

So if I jump out to the Music
app to change the current track,

01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:04.306 A:middle
after I've dropped my wrist,

01:22:04.306 --> 01:22:07.026 A:middle
I'll very shortly be
returned back to my workout.

01:22:07.766 --> 01:22:09.936 A:middle
We've also enhanced the
access to the heart rate

01:22:09.936 --> 01:22:11.186 A:middle
and accelerometer sensors

01:22:11.186 --> 01:22:13.326 A:middle
so that they now
provide continuous values

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:15.576 A:middle
for the entire duration
of the workout as well.

01:22:21.086 --> 01:22:22.366 A:middle
In addition to these
sensor enhancements,

01:22:22.366 --> 01:22:25.706 A:middle
we've also got a whole bunch of
great, new hardware access APIs.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:28.666 A:middle
Crown events give you raw
access to rotation events

01:22:28.666 --> 01:22:29.546 A:middle
from the Digital Crown.

01:22:30.566 --> 01:22:32.546 A:middle
Gesture recognizers
make it really easy

01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:36.006 A:middle
to add custom tap interactions
to your apps, touch interactions

01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:39.046 A:middle
such as tap, swipe,
and pan, and of course,

01:22:39.046 --> 01:22:40.796 A:middle
the gyroscope is
now also accessible

01:22:40.796 --> 01:22:42.166 A:middle
in addition to the
accelerometer.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:48.936 A:middle
To make sure that you can do
really cool things with all

01:22:48.936 --> 01:22:51.546 A:middle
of these hardware access APIs,
we've also brought a bunch

01:22:51.546 --> 01:22:53.506 A:middle
of graphics and media
frameworks to the watchOS SDK.

01:22:53.506 --> 01:22:57.356 A:middle
SpriteKit and SceneKit give
you a ton of flexibility

01:22:57.496 --> 01:22:59.796 A:middle

01:23:02.986 --> 01:23:05.386 A:middle
AV Foundation makes it
really easy to play sounds

01:23:05.386 --> 01:23:07.716 A:middle
out of the watch
speaker, and in the spirit

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.286 A:middle
of simplifying navigation
in your apps,

01:23:09.556 --> 01:23:11.686 A:middle
you can now play
video back inline

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.416 A:middle
in your application
interfaces as well [applause].

01:23:16.436 --> 01:23:18.646 A:middle
Of course, you also
often need to get data on

01:23:18.646 --> 01:23:20.826 A:middle
and off the watch, and
to help make that easier,

01:23:20.826 --> 01:23:23.836 A:middle
as Toby mentioned, CloudKit is
now part of the watchOS SDK.

01:23:23.836 --> 01:23:28.426 A:middle
Because it's built on top of
NSURL session, it works even

01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:29.466 A:middle
when your phone's not present

01:23:29.466 --> 01:23:31.556 A:middle
and your watch is near
a known Wi-Fi network.

01:23:32.686 --> 01:23:35.916 A:middle
Apple Watch is already a great
way to pay for physical goods

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:39.946 A:middle
in stores, and in watchOS 3,
you can now offer physical goods

01:23:39.946 --> 01:23:42.666 A:middle
for sale within your
own apps to be purchased

01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:44.616 A:middle
with just a double-tap
of the side button.

01:23:46.046 --> 01:23:48.796 A:middle
Building a great watch app
is just the first step.

01:23:48.796 --> 01:23:50.966 A:middle
It's also important that
you make it easy for users

01:23:50.966 --> 01:23:52.966 A:middle
to discover and install
your apps.

01:23:52.966 --> 01:23:56.106 A:middle
And to help you with that,
the new watch face gallery

01:23:56.106 --> 01:23:59.406 A:middle
in iOS X includes an
entire section devoted just

01:23:59.406 --> 01:24:00.756 A:middle
to displaying all of your apps.

to displaying all of your apps.

01:24:02.086 --> 01:24:03.596 A:middle
With just a few simple steps,

01:24:03.596 --> 01:24:06.376 A:middle
you can create a complication
bundle which enables your app

01:24:06.376 --> 01:24:07.836 A:middle
to appear in the
watch face gallery.

01:24:08.736 --> 01:24:11.146 A:middle
It's the first thing that
a new watch owner will see

01:24:11.286 --> 01:24:12.426 A:middle
after they've paired
their watch,

01:24:12.836 --> 01:24:14.376 A:middle
and it displays the
complications

01:24:14.376 --> 01:24:15.886 A:middle
from all their favorite
apps that they use

01:24:15.886 --> 01:24:17.696 A:middle
on their iPhone every day.

01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:21.206 A:middle
This makes it really easy for
them to get their apps installed

01:24:21.206 --> 01:24:22.956 A:middle
and added right to
their watch face.

01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:25.376 A:middle
We've been working really hard

01:24:25.376 --> 01:24:27.956 A:middle
to give you all the tools you
need to build great, glanceable,

going to do with them.

&gt;&gt; Hi. So I have here an
application that I built

01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:54.326 A:middle
for watchOS 2, which shows
Max the panda, my friend,

01:24:54.566 --> 01:24:58.796 A:middle
and it tells me what his
mood is at different times.

01:24:59.406 --> 01:25:01.896 A:middle
So right now, you can
see that he's happy.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:24:59.406 --> 01:25:01.896 A:middle
So right now, you can
see that he's happy.

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:03.616 A:middle
If I now suspend the app,

01:25:04.696 --> 01:25:07.366 A:middle
you can see that I have a
complication also telling me

01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:11.176 A:middle
that he's happy, but here is
a notification that tells me

01:25:11.176 --> 01:25:12.786 A:middle
that suddenly Max
has become hungry.

01:25:13.636 --> 01:25:17.066 A:middle
Now, this app for watchOS
2 has a few problems

01:25:17.066 --> 01:25:18.066 A:middle
which I'm going to show you now.

01:25:18.526 --> 01:25:20.936 A:middle
The first is that when I
dismiss the notification,

01:25:21.456 --> 01:25:24.046 A:middle
my complication has not
updated to reflect the fact

01:25:24.256 --> 01:25:25.306 A:middle
that Max is now hungry.

01:25:26.556 --> 01:25:31.136 A:middle
And even worse, when I go
into the Dock, the snapshot

01:25:31.136 --> 01:25:34.886 A:middle
of the app in the Dock also
has not updated, so I'm failing

01:25:34.886 --> 01:25:38.146 A:middle
to show a unified set of data

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:42.656 A:middle
across all the interfaces
to my app.

01:25:42.886 --> 01:25:46.026 A:middle
So going now to the code,
there's a really easy way new

01:25:46.026 --> 01:25:48.326 A:middle
in watchOS 3 to address
these issues.

01:25:49.866 --> 01:25:52.636 A:middle
In my extension delegate, I
have a single funnel point,

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.806 A:middle
Handle Background Tasks,
which is the perfect place

01:25:55.886 --> 01:25:58.346 A:middle
to update all of these
interfaces as my data changes.

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:01.946 A:middle
Here in my Snapshot
Refresh background task,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:01.946 A:middle
Here in my Snapshot
Refresh background task,

01:26:02.176 --> 01:26:03.776 A:middle
I'm going to add just
two lines of code

01:26:03.776 --> 01:26:05.096 A:middle
to address both of
these problems.

01:26:05.556 --> 01:26:07.666 A:middle
The first is to update
my interface

01:26:08.636 --> 01:26:12.436 A:middle
for my current friend's
status, and second,

01:26:12.436 --> 01:26:16.916 A:middle
I'm going to also reload
my complication as well

01:26:16.916 --> 01:26:19.446 A:middle
when the snapshot is taken.

01:26:19.446 --> 01:26:21.936 A:middle
Okay, so that should address
the problems that we saw.

01:26:22.256 --> 01:26:23.406 A:middle
But while we're in here,

01:26:23.406 --> 01:26:27.266 A:middle
let me make this app a little
bit more fun because as you saw,

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.206 A:middle
Max was kind of just a
static image in watchOS 2.

01:26:30.566 --> 01:26:34.696 A:middle
But in watchOS 3, we can
incorporate a SceneKit scene

01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:36.216 A:middle
to make some animation happen.

01:26:37.536 --> 01:26:39.816 A:middle
So I'm going to switch
over here to my interface,

01:26:40.306 --> 01:26:42.046 A:middle
and here's my application
interface.

01:26:42.046 --> 01:26:47.976 A:middle
I'm going to delete the image
and drag in a SceneKit scene.

01:26:51.116 --> 01:26:54.056 A:middle
Now, I wrote a tiny bit
of code earlier just

01:26:54.056 --> 01:26:57.416 A:middle
to populate this scene
with some SceneKit assets

01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.676 A:middle
and to make an outlet, which
I'll connect right now.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:00.636 --> 01:27:04.196 A:middle
Drag it into my SceneKit
interface.

01:27:05.706 --> 01:27:08.276 A:middle
Now, not only can you
add a SceneKit scene

01:27:08.276 --> 01:27:11.026 A:middle
to your application itself,
but you can also add one

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:13.696 A:middle
to the notification, which
will be a lot more fun

01:27:13.766 --> 01:27:15.286 A:middle
than a text-based notification.

01:27:15.966 --> 01:27:17.776 A:middle
I'm going to drag one
into there as well.

01:27:17.776 --> 01:27:21.266 A:middle
I need to resize
this a little bit.

01:27:22.496 --> 01:27:24.446 A:middle
Hook it up to the outlet.

01:27:29.566 --> 01:27:31.396 A:middle
All right, and with those
changes, I'm going to go ahead

01:27:31.396 --> 01:27:32.486 A:middle
and run this application again,

01:27:32.596 --> 01:27:35.496 A:middle
and we'll hopefully see
something a little bit more

01:27:35.496 --> 01:27:36.566 A:middle
dynamic this time.

01:27:46.346 --> 01:27:48.506 A:middle
So here we have a much
happier looking version

01:27:48.506 --> 01:27:53.226 A:middle
of Max running around, and when
I now suspend the application,

01:27:54.266 --> 01:27:55.666 A:middle
wait for him to get hungry.

01:28:00.226 --> 01:28:02.876 A:middle
We see a really sad,
more convincing version

01:28:03.046 --> 01:28:04.656 A:middle
of Max rubbing his tummy.

[ Applause ]

01:28:09.106 --> 01:28:10.596 A:middle
So I think this is
a lot more fun.

01:28:10.596 --> 01:28:14.376 A:middle
When I dismiss the notification,
my complication has updated

01:28:14.376 --> 01:28:18.216 A:middle
as we hoped to reflect his
current status, and if I look

01:28:18.216 --> 01:28:20.096 A:middle
in the Dock, you can see

01:28:20.096 --> 01:28:22.596 A:middle
that the snapshot has also
now been updated to reflect

01:28:22.656 --> 01:28:23.886 A:middle
that he's hungry
and no longer happy.

01:28:24.386 --> 01:28:27.286 A:middle
So that's just a few of the
new things you can do which,

01:28:27.286 --> 01:28:29.356 A:middle
with the new APIs in watchOS 3.

01:28:29.356 --> 01:28:30.876 A:middle
We're excited to see
what you guys build.

01:28:31.256 --> 01:28:33.116 A:middle

to invite Jim Young

you guys have been very
busy bringing over 6000 apps

01:28:56.976 --> 01:29:00.166 A:middle
to the App Store, including
entertainment apps, games,

01:28:56.976 --> 01:29:00.166 A:middle
to the App Store, including
entertainment apps, games,

01:29:00.386 --> 01:29:02.866 A:middle
health and fitness, and
education apps, and many more.

01:29:03.716 --> 01:29:06.376 A:middle
So let's talk about what it
means to develop on tvOS.

01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:09.156 A:middle
First, it's already
familiar to you.

01:29:09.156 --> 01:29:11.576 A:middle
You use all the tools and
languages you already know.

01:29:13.036 --> 01:29:14.916 A:middle
And tvOS includes the
essential frameworks

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.626 A:middle
that you're familiar
with from iOS.

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.126 A:middle
Plus, we've got some
new frameworks specific

01:29:20.126 --> 01:29:21.076 A:middle
to tvOS that we've built.

01:29:22.556 --> 01:29:24.296 A:middle
There's all the foundational
support you need

01:29:24.296 --> 01:29:25.206 A:middle
for building great apps.

01:29:25.576 --> 01:29:28.366 A:middle
We have a rich media stack
for audio/video apps.

01:29:28.366 --> 01:29:31.506 A:middle
And of course, we've got
excellent support for games.

01:29:31.506 --> 01:29:35.696 A:middle
And we're bringing even more
features to the platform.

01:29:36.456 --> 01:29:38.926 A:middle
With PhotoKit, you can now
create these great apps

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:41.016 A:middle
that showcase users'
photos on their big screen,

01:29:41.886 --> 01:29:45.726 A:middle
and we've made it super easy to
add support for light and dark,

01:29:46.176 --> 01:29:47.706 A:middle
excuse me, our light/dark
appearance.

01:29:49.986 --> 01:29:51.386 A:middle
So it's a rich set
of technologies,

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.446 A:middle
and this is just a partial list.

01:29:52.446 --> 01:29:53.336 A:middle
There's a whole lot more.

01:29:54.116 --> 01:29:58.546 A:middle
Let's talk about using
all these technologies

01:29:58.546 --> 01:29:59.496 A:middle
and bringing them all together

01:29:59.496 --> 01:30:02.976 A:middle
to deliver a great
experience on tvOS.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:59.496 --> 01:30:02.976 A:middle
to deliver a great
experience on tvOS.

01:30:03.126 --> 01:30:05.416 A:middle
And I want to start with Touch.

01:30:05.416 --> 01:30:07.186 A:middle
When designing tvOS,
we knew we wanted

01:30:07.186 --> 01:30:09.536 A:middle
to bring a first-class Touch
experience into the living room.

01:30:10.606 --> 01:30:12.496 A:middle
Now, Touch needs to feel
fluid and connected.

01:30:12.496 --> 01:30:14.116 A:middle
It needs to be predictable.

01:30:14.116 --> 01:30:15.206 A:middle
It needs to be fun.

01:30:16.026 --> 01:30:17.716 A:middle
That's a particular
challenge in the living room

01:30:17.716 --> 01:30:19.006 A:middle
when the TV's 10 feet away.

01:30:21.096 --> 01:30:22.426 A:middle
So let's look at
how we solve this.

01:30:22.896 --> 01:30:26.076 A:middle
We have updated UIKit
so that all the controls

01:30:26.076 --> 01:30:27.896 A:middle
and views look beautiful
on the big screen.

01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:31.876 A:middle
We've added UIFocus to allow
you to indicate which elements

01:30:31.876 --> 01:30:33.126 A:middle
of your UI are focusable.

01:30:34.336 --> 01:30:37.546 A:middle
And we have updated
UIMotionEffect so it takes input

01:30:37.546 --> 01:30:38.506 A:middle
from the focus engine.

01:30:39.586 --> 01:30:41.586 A:middle
Now, altogether this
provides a direct connection

01:30:41.586 --> 01:30:43.256 A:middle
between what the user
is doing with the remote

01:30:43.256 --> 01:30:44.896 A:middle
and what they see
on the big screen.

01:30:46.926 --> 01:30:48.786 A:middle
Good news here is that we've
done all the heavy lifting

01:30:48.846 --> 01:30:49.356 A:middle
for you.

01:30:50.136 --> 01:30:51.766 A:middle
Your UIKit apps will get
all of this for free.

01:30:53.796 --> 01:30:55.126 A:middle
Now, if you have a
server-based app,

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.696 A:middle
apps used to deliver content.

01:30:57.076 --> 01:30:58.996 A:middle
We've got a lot of great apps
like this one from Showtime.

01:30:59.806 --> 01:31:01.646 A:middle
We have a technology
called TVMLKit,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:59.806 --> 01:31:01.646 A:middle
We have a technology
called TVMLKit,

01:31:01.646 --> 01:31:02.876 A:middle
a framework called TVMLKit.

01:31:04.036 --> 01:31:07.236 A:middle
TVMLKit is a new, high-level
framework we built specifically

01:31:07.236 --> 01:31:07.756 A:middle
for tvOS.

01:31:08.766 --> 01:31:11.306 A:middle
It's built on top of
UIKit so you get all

01:31:11.306 --> 01:31:13.376 A:middle
that connective Touch
experience that we just showed.

01:31:15.156 --> 01:31:16.496 A:middle
We provide a large
set of templates,

01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:18.826 A:middle
and you can even provide
your own custom templates

01:31:19.096 --> 01:31:20.076 A:middle
and native controls.

01:31:21.936 --> 01:31:24.346 A:middle
TVMLKit has allowed teams
to build these beautiful,

01:31:24.346 --> 01:31:27.296 A:middle
highly stylized, customized
apps in a short amount of time.

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:32.636 A:middle
Let's now talk about how you can
extend the experience outside

01:31:32.636 --> 01:31:36.116 A:middle
of Apple TV by integrating
with other Apple devices.

01:31:37.646 --> 01:31:39.536 A:middle
One easy thing to do is
to save app and game state

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:40.666 A:middle
in the cloud using CloudKit.

01:31:41.966 --> 01:31:44.436 A:middle
Making it easier for users to
start a game on their Apple TV

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.466 A:middle
and pick it up and resume
right where they left off

01:31:46.466 --> 01:31:47.946 A:middle
on their iPhone or iPad.

01:31:52.586 --> 01:31:53.726 A:middle
We've also seen some great apps

01:31:53.726 --> 01:31:55.736 A:middle
that use multiple Apple
devices at the same time.

01:31:56.576 --> 01:31:58.496 A:middle
With SongPop Party
from FreshPlanet,

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.586 A:middle
the whole family can
play using their iPhone


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.586 A:middle
the whole family can
play using their iPhone

01:32:01.336 --> 01:32:03.196 A:middle
to answer music trivia
questions.

01:32:03.196 --> 01:32:07.166 A:middle
And to make it even easier
to create apps that talk

01:32:07.196 --> 01:32:08.256 A:middle
to each other across devices,

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.356 A:middle
we're bringing Multipeer
Connectivity to the platform.

01:32:11.256 --> 01:32:12.306 A:middle
Just a few lines of code--

01:32:13.516 --> 01:32:17.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:32:17.646 --> 01:32:19.506 A:middle
Just a few lines of code,
you can easily connect

01:32:19.506 --> 01:32:21.106 A:middle
to your apps running
on a different device.

01:32:23.366 --> 01:32:25.806 A:middle
Now, this morning, we announced
the new Apple TV Remote app.

01:32:26.326 --> 01:32:27.746 A:middle
Now everyone in your household

01:32:27.856 --> 01:32:30.276 A:middle
that has an iPhone can have an
Apple TV Remote in their hands.

01:32:32.306 --> 01:32:33.706 A:middle
To your apps it looks
and behaves just

01:32:33.706 --> 01:32:36.526 A:middle
like the Siri Remote, but
we've added a couple features

01:32:36.526 --> 01:32:37.676 A:middle
to take advantage of the screen.

01:32:38.946 --> 01:32:41.586 A:middle
The Now Playing screen provides
a full set of playback controls

01:32:41.586 --> 01:32:43.016 A:middle
as well as cover
art for your media.

01:32:44.486 --> 01:32:47.506 A:middle
Just like showing art and
controls on the iOS lock screen,

01:32:47.736 --> 01:32:50.316 A:middle
use the Media Player Remote
-- I always get this one --

01:32:50.316 --> 01:32:51.526 A:middle
Media Player Remote Command API

01:32:51.526 --> 01:32:55.106 A:middle
to add this information
to Remote app.

01:32:55.936 --> 01:32:58.386 A:middle
The app also provides a
screen designed for gameplay.

01:32:58.386 --> 01:33:01.286 A:middle
To your game, the new app shows


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:58.386 --> 01:33:01.286 A:middle
To your game, the new app shows

01:33:01.286 --> 01:33:04.416 A:middle
up as a micro gamepad
just like the Siri Remote.

01:33:05.296 --> 01:33:07.956 A:middle
To take advantage of multiple
micro gamepads, you need to opt

01:33:07.956 --> 01:33:09.996 A:middle
in by setting an Info.plist key.

01:33:10.516 --> 01:33:14.516 A:middle
In addition to Siri Remote
and the new Remote app,

01:33:14.986 --> 01:33:17.396 A:middle
tvOS also supports
MFi game controllers.

01:33:18.916 --> 01:33:20.776 A:middle
And coming this fall,
tvOS will also support

01:33:20.776 --> 01:33:22.676 A:middle
up to four simultaneous
game controllers.

01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:28.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:33:29.266 --> 01:33:30.746 A:middle
But we didn't want
to stop there.

01:33:31.406 --> 01:33:33.286 A:middle
We wanted to enable
even more awesome games.

01:33:33.826 --> 01:33:36.016 A:middle
We wanted to enable games
that might require these kind

01:33:36.016 --> 01:33:39.126 A:middle
of controllers, so
we're happy to announce

01:33:39.766 --> 01:33:41.756 A:middle
that we're updating
our controller policy.

01:33:42.906 --> 01:33:45.586 A:middle
You can narrow your games to
require a game controller.

[ Applause ]

01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:56.316 A:middle
tvOS will check if the
required controller is present

01:33:56.316 --> 01:33:57.846 A:middle
and prompt the user
if it's necessary.

01:33:59.946 --> 01:34:01.396 A:middle
That's an update on tvOS.

We're super happy to be here.

01:34:03.616 --> 01:34:04.886 A:middle

labs and sessions

01:34:04.956 --> 01:34:07.716 A:middle
with the tvOS engineers there,
so please come by and stop by.

01:34:08.206 --> 01:34:10.186 A:middle
Next, I want to introduce
Geoff Stahl is going to come up

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:11.616 A:middle
and talk about graphics
technologies.

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:12.026 A:middle
Geoff?

01:34:13.516 --> 01:34:15.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:34:16.296 --> 01:34:16.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jim.

01:34:18.716 --> 01:34:19.726 A:middle
So I'm going to talk
about graphics.

01:34:19.726 --> 01:34:22.706 A:middle
I'm going to talk about a
couple areas of graphics.

01:34:23.176 --> 01:34:25.446 A:middle
We have really great
things to talk about today,

01:34:25.546 --> 01:34:26.696 A:middle
and I'll start with color.

01:34:28.386 --> 01:34:32.236 A:middle
So we're building
astonishing new displays

01:34:32.236 --> 01:34:35.856 A:middle
for our latest iPads and
Macs, ones that are capable

01:34:35.856 --> 01:34:38.266 A:middle
of reproducing absolutely
stunning color.

01:34:39.466 --> 01:34:41.526 A:middle
In fact, as DisplayMate says,

01:34:41.526 --> 01:34:45.956 A:middle
"The color accuracy is visually
indistinguishable from perfect."

01:34:47.386 --> 01:34:48.076 A:middle
So how do we do this?

01:34:48.076 --> 01:34:49.976 A:middle
Well, this is all
about color gamut.

01:34:51.246 --> 01:34:54.476 A:middle
So most displays are built
with the sRGB color gamut,

01:34:54.476 --> 01:34:57.596 A:middle
which is narrow and doesn't
reproduce all the colors you

01:34:57.596 --> 01:35:00.386 A:middle
would see in life accurately
of things like flowers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:34:57.596 --> 01:35:00.386 A:middle
would see in life accurately
of things like flowers

01:35:00.386 --> 01:35:03.086 A:middle
or paint colors or maybe
even the clothes you wear.

01:35:04.226 --> 01:35:08.786 A:middle
So we're moving to the wide P3
color gamut, which contributes

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:11.366 A:middle
to our ability to really
accurately reproduce

01:35:11.406 --> 01:35:12.816 A:middle
and render these
real-life objects.

01:35:13.706 --> 01:35:16.046 A:middle
But we're not stopping there.

01:35:16.046 --> 01:35:18.056 A:middle
We're going to go
all in on color.

01:35:18.506 --> 01:35:22.276 A:middle
From our system APIs to
our system applications,

01:35:22.456 --> 01:35:24.156 A:middle
we support deep and
wide color throughout.

01:35:24.576 --> 01:35:27.786 A:middle
And if you're an
application using UIImageView

01:35:28.096 --> 01:35:30.476 A:middle
or UIView, you get it for free.

01:35:30.476 --> 01:35:31.886 A:middle
You get it automatically.

01:35:31.886 --> 01:35:35.936 A:middle
If you have to manipulate wide
colors yourself synthetically,

01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:37.926 A:middle
we also offer APIs for that.

01:35:39.576 --> 01:35:41.356 A:middle
And of course, we have
a great capture story.

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:44.436 A:middle
Our latest cameras support
capturing deep and wide color.

01:35:45.076 --> 01:35:47.956 A:middle
We have APIs to access
raw images.

01:35:48.986 --> 01:35:52.676 A:middle
And we can also now capture
with APIs LivePhotos.

01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:54.816 A:middle
So that's color.

01:36:01.056 --> 01:36:01.726 A:middle
I'd like to talk

01:36:01.726 --> 01:36:04.046 A:middle
about technology now
that's changed the direction

01:36:04.046 --> 01:36:05.696 A:middle
of industry, and that's Metal.

01:36:06.906 --> 01:36:08.756 A:middle
Metal we introduced
two years ago

01:36:08.756 --> 01:36:10.516 A:middle
and has been wildly successful.

01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:13.126 A:middle
And keep in mind, when
we developed Metal,

01:36:13.326 --> 01:36:16.666 A:middle
when we enhance it, we enhance
it with our devices in mind.

01:36:16.666 --> 01:36:19.676 A:middle
Which allows us to innovate
in a rapid pace with things

01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:22.676 A:middle
like Metal tessellation that
allows high-order surfaces

01:36:22.866 --> 01:36:25.076 A:middle
for rendering accuracy
like never before

01:36:26.146 --> 01:36:27.986 A:middle
or Metal function
specialization.

01:36:28.216 --> 01:36:31.716 A:middle
Which when combined with S
code allows you to build a set

01:36:31.716 --> 01:36:34.266 A:middle
of shaders that automatically
handling your material

01:36:34.266 --> 01:36:35.606 A:middle
and lighting properties
in your scene.

01:36:36.206 --> 01:36:39.406 A:middle
And for things like
memoryless render targets,

01:36:39.686 --> 01:36:42.416 A:middle
which use the architecture
of our Tile cash

01:36:42.876 --> 01:36:44.276 A:middle
to reduce the amount
of memory used

01:36:44.276 --> 01:36:46.186 A:middle
in your application
or resource use.

01:36:46.526 --> 01:36:47.896 A:middle
Which allows your application

01:36:47.896 --> 01:36:51.526 A:middle
to specialize the way it handles
memory within a Metal app.

01:36:54.736 --> 01:36:55.906 A:middle
And Metal is everywhere.

01:36:56.226 --> 01:36:59.406 A:middle
Hundreds of millions
of devices use Metal.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:37:00.456 --> 01:37:01.756 A:middle
Our key graphics frameworks

01:37:01.886 --> 01:37:04.026 A:middle
and major game engines
are built on top of it.

01:37:05.776 --> 01:37:07.476 A:middle
So whether you're
using a high-level API

01:37:07.476 --> 01:37:09.806 A:middle
or programming directly
to Metal itself,

01:37:09.836 --> 01:37:13.246 A:middle
you get all the performance
optimizations we've built in.

01:37:14.766 --> 01:37:15.766 A:middle
Another thing about Metal,

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.036 A:middle
it's one of our foundational
technologies

01:37:18.616 --> 01:37:19.626 A:middle
of our games ecosystem.

01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:21.236 A:middle
So let's talk about games.

01:37:23.776 --> 01:37:26.906 A:middle
Over the past few years, we've
built a great games ecosystem,

01:37:27.056 --> 01:37:30.936 A:middle
and the goal of this is to
build the APIs and tools

01:37:30.936 --> 01:37:33.406 A:middle
which allow you to take
your ideas in gaming

01:37:33.526 --> 01:37:34.686 A:middle
and turn them into reality.

01:37:34.856 --> 01:37:37.006 A:middle
I want to cover some
highlights here today.

01:37:38.386 --> 01:37:40.206 A:middle
First, as mentioned this
morning, Replay Kit.

01:37:40.996 --> 01:37:42.416 A:middle
We introduced Replay
Kit last year,

01:37:42.416 --> 01:37:43.996 A:middle
and it's really super
easy to adopt.

01:37:44.676 --> 01:37:48.386 A:middle
It allows your users to start
a recording, play their game,

01:37:49.846 --> 01:37:53.036 A:middle
edit that recording, and then
share with their friends.

01:37:54.196 --> 01:37:56.036 A:middle
Well, this year, we're
going to take it up a notch

01:37:56.576 --> 01:37:59.056 A:middle
with ReplayKit Streaming.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:38:00.186 --> 01:38:03.076 A:middle
Now, Replay Kit can
live stream to services

01:38:03.076 --> 01:38:05.456 A:middle
that support the ReplayKit
Streaming Extension.

01:38:06.016 --> 01:38:11.296 A:middle
This allows your users to not
just go from, not just share

01:38:11.296 --> 01:38:13.396 A:middle
with their friends
but stream live

01:38:13.476 --> 01:38:16.796 A:middle
to the internet automatically
with ReplayKit Live Streaming.

01:38:16.926 --> 01:38:18.566 A:middle
And the -- absolutely.

01:38:19.516 --> 01:38:22.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:38:23.476 --> 01:38:26.586 A:middle
And even better, it's about
three lines of code to adopt

01:38:26.586 --> 01:38:27.716 A:middle
if you already use Replay Kit.

01:38:27.716 --> 01:38:31.096 A:middle
This is super easy and could
really expand the social reach

01:38:31.206 --> 01:38:32.246 A:middle
of your applications.

01:38:33.026 --> 01:38:37.456 A:middle
So speaking of social, let's
talk about Game Center.

01:38:37.616 --> 01:38:40.026 A:middle
We're changing the way that
Game Center Multiplayer works.

01:38:40.526 --> 01:38:42.586 A:middle
Now with our latest OS's,

01:38:42.996 --> 01:38:46.026 A:middle
you can invite anyone you
can send a message to.

01:38:46.026 --> 01:38:47.986 A:middle
So your users can invite
anyone they can reach

01:38:47.986 --> 01:38:50.126 A:middle
out via message,
and it is that easy.

01:38:50.126 --> 01:38:52.366 A:middle
It's just as easy as
sending a message.

01:38:53.716 --> 01:38:55.996 A:middle
And the cool thing here is if
you're already using the games

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:58.516 A:middle
that are multiplayer APIs,
you don't need to do anything.

01:38:58.846 --> 01:39:00.826 A:middle
With the latest OS's,
this just works,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:38:58.846 --> 01:39:00.826 A:middle
With the latest OS's,
this just works,

01:39:00.826 --> 01:39:04.016 A:middle
and we're not going
to stop with that.

01:39:04.436 --> 01:39:08.716 A:middle
We're going to add new
APIs to Game Center.

01:39:09.046 --> 01:39:10.006 A:middle
Game Center Sessions.

01:39:10.766 --> 01:39:14.456 A:middle
Game Center Sessions creates a
persistent, shared experience

01:39:14.676 --> 01:39:16.166 A:middle
where users can come and go.

01:39:16.436 --> 01:39:19.496 A:middle
This means you can design your
games with the mobile user

01:39:19.496 --> 01:39:21.436 A:middle
in mind the way they come and go

01:39:21.436 --> 01:39:24.206 A:middle
into your application that's
allowing a new paradigm

01:39:24.446 --> 01:39:26.096 A:middle
in multiplayer gaming
in the mobile space.

01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:30.446 A:middle
Finally, GameplayKit.

01:39:30.446 --> 01:39:32.796 A:middle
GameplayKit is our
component-based API

01:39:33.536 --> 01:39:35.896 A:middle
that allows you to instance
and customize these components

01:39:36.336 --> 01:39:38.416 A:middle
and make the building blocks
for your game objects,

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.306 A:middle
letting us do the
heavy lifting for you.

01:39:40.306 --> 01:39:45.886 A:middle
And I'd like to invite Norman
Wang on stage to give a demo

01:39:45.886 --> 01:39:48.276 A:middle
of these components and
our Xcode gameplay tools.

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:54.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:39:55.106 --> 01:39:55.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Geoff.

01:39:55.986 --> 01:40:00.186 A:middle
I'd like to show you how quickly
I can build a game in Xcode 8.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:39:55.986 --> 01:40:00.186 A:middle
I'd like to show you how quickly
I can build a game in Xcode 8.

01:40:00.436 --> 01:40:02.396 A:middle
Here's a game project
I'm currently working on.

01:40:03.156 --> 01:40:05.496 A:middle
It's a competitive
game involving a hero

01:40:05.496 --> 01:40:07.936 A:middle
and enemies throwing paint
balloons at each other.

01:40:08.856 --> 01:40:11.456 A:middle
Now, I have been using the
new APIs from SpriteKit

01:40:11.456 --> 01:40:12.656 A:middle
and GameplayKit this year.

01:40:13.076 --> 01:40:15.906 A:middle
As you can see, the game
needs three major elements

01:40:15.946 --> 01:40:20.156 A:middle
to be ready; a map, a hero,
and the gameplay pieces.

01:40:20.836 --> 01:40:25.436 A:middle
I have already implemented the
hero's movement and animation,

01:40:25.616 --> 01:40:28.296 A:middle
but it is clearly
missing the collision

01:40:28.296 --> 01:40:32.616 A:middle
with the island bounds, so
let's go ahead and fix that.

01:40:32.616 --> 01:40:34.496 A:middle
Opening our Xcode
project and looking

01:40:34.496 --> 01:40:35.836 A:middle
at the source code section,

01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:39.436 A:middle
I have already written a
few gameplay behaviors using

01:40:39.436 --> 01:40:41.776 A:middle
GKComponent provided
by GameplayKit,

01:40:42.276 --> 01:40:43.506 A:middle
like the fight component here.

01:40:44.226 --> 01:40:47.656 A:middle
And in Xcode 8, I
can now expose any

01:40:47.656 --> 01:40:52.766 A:middle
of my class properties
that's defined in my class

01:40:52.766 --> 01:40:56.236 A:middle
to the 2D editor then I can
customize whenever the behavior

01:40:56.236 --> 01:40:58.146 A:middle
gets attached to one
entity in the scene.

01:40:59.236 --> 01:41:00.546 A:middle
So to build the island map,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:40:59.236 --> 01:41:00.546 A:middle
So to build the island map,

01:41:01.046 --> 01:41:03.286 A:middle
I've been using the
new Tiled Map Editor.

01:41:03.836 --> 01:41:06.486 A:middle
So in my game, there's
three different tile sets

01:41:06.946 --> 01:41:07.886 A:middle
that I have specified.

01:41:08.516 --> 01:41:10.386 A:middle
There's sand, water, and grass.

01:41:11.416 --> 01:41:15.166 A:middle
Not only do I have the ability
to specify both the interior

01:41:15.166 --> 01:41:18.526 A:middle
and exterior tiles, I can
also introduce variance.

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:21.556 A:middle
So here for the red
edge, for example,

01:41:21.946 --> 01:41:25.236 A:middle
for this individual tile image,
if I want to add a new look

01:41:25.236 --> 01:41:28.646 A:middle
to it to get rid of the small
rock, I can simply just drag it

01:41:28.646 --> 01:41:29.826 A:middle
in from the Media Library.

01:41:30.316 --> 01:41:32.016 A:middle
And now this tile
set is complete.

01:41:32.496 --> 01:41:34.886 A:middle
Let me go ahead and show
you how I can use this.

01:41:35.576 --> 01:41:41.766 A:middle
So switching back to the island
map, the island is constructed

01:41:41.826 --> 01:41:44.146 A:middle
with the new tile map
functionality with,

01:41:44.146 --> 01:41:47.376 A:middle
provided by SpriteKit, so
to make a modification,

01:41:47.376 --> 01:41:48.976 A:middle
I can simply select
the tile map.

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.946 A:middle
Make a double click, and
select the active tile

01:41:51.946 --> 01:41:53.106 A:middle
that I want to work on.

01:41:53.426 --> 01:41:56.226 A:middle
Now that I think the island
looks a little bit too plain,

01:41:56.646 --> 01:42:00.656 A:middle
and to make such modifications,
I can just simply paint


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:41:56.646 --> 01:42:00.656 A:middle
and to make such modifications,
I can just simply paint

01:42:00.966 --> 01:42:05.286 A:middle
across the level and Xcode will
automatically paint the correct

01:42:05.366 --> 01:42:07.226 A:middle
tiles to make it with
surrounding neighbors.

01:42:07.496 --> 01:42:08.116 A:middle
It's that easy.

01:42:09.096 --> 01:42:11.966 A:middle
So now I think I got the look
I'm going after with the island.

01:42:12.116 --> 01:42:14.016 A:middle
Let's look at some of the
gameplay elements here.

01:42:14.806 --> 01:42:20.346 A:middle
To power the hero, our hero's
movement and animation,

01:42:20.346 --> 01:42:22.966 A:middle
I have already attached
the player input component

01:42:23.016 --> 01:42:24.076 A:middle
and the move component.

01:42:24.836 --> 01:42:29.126 A:middle
And to make the player
respect the island boundaries,

01:42:29.296 --> 01:42:32.296 A:middle
I can simply add a collision
component to have implemented.

01:42:32.886 --> 01:42:35.406 A:middle
So this way, it will
automatically create a physics

01:42:35.406 --> 01:42:37.986 A:middle
body for our hero
and the islands based

01:42:37.986 --> 01:42:40.986 A:middle
on the current tile sets
that's being set up.

01:42:41.336 --> 01:42:43.166 A:middle
And to give the player
the ability

01:42:43.166 --> 01:42:45.006 A:middle
to throw the water balloons,

01:42:45.006 --> 01:42:47.516 A:middle
I can simply add the
fight component to it.

01:42:47.976 --> 01:42:51.246 A:middle
And notice here how the
health property being exposed

01:42:51.246 --> 01:42:53.616 A:middle
by the fight component
class is now visible.

01:42:53.616 --> 01:42:56.316 A:middle
I can give it a custom
value here.

01:42:56.316 --> 01:42:59.706 A:middle
So for example, I can set
the value to be 2 rather

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:01.786 A:middle
than using the default
value of 1.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:01.786 A:middle
than using the default
value of 1.

01:43:02.456 --> 01:43:05.736 A:middle
And in addition, I have
a drone that drops the,

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:08.146 A:middle
these paint balloons
on the level

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:10.376 A:middle
and I have a enemy
that's in the scene.

01:43:11.026 --> 01:43:14.106 A:middle
So to give the enemy the same
fighting ability by picking

01:43:14.106 --> 01:43:16.676 A:middle
up the paint balloons
and throw at me,

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:19.146 A:middle
I'm going to give the
same fight component.

01:43:19.676 --> 01:43:21.406 A:middle
And to make this a fair game,

01:43:21.406 --> 01:43:24.126 A:middle
I'm going to give the same
health level of 2 rather

01:43:24.126 --> 01:43:26.616 A:middle
than using the default
value of 1.

01:43:27.796 --> 01:43:30.236 A:middle
Now, I think my level
is set up pretty good.

01:43:30.236 --> 01:43:33.206 A:middle
Let's run it and check it
out, the new implementation.

01:43:34.526 --> 01:43:35.426 A:middle
So the drones are going

01:43:35.426 --> 01:43:38.126 A:middle
to be dropping randomly
the paint balloons

01:43:38.126 --> 01:43:40.376 A:middle
and the paintball
fighter will start.

01:43:40.376 --> 01:43:42.906 A:middle
So looks like all the
elements are all there.

01:43:43.196 --> 01:43:48.186 A:middle
So in Xcode 8, it's very easy to
implement the level of the game

01:43:48.186 --> 01:43:52.826 A:middle
and connect all these
gameplay logics fairly quickly.

01:43:53.076 --> 01:43:55.526 A:middle
Because I'm using
SpriteKit and GameplayKit,

01:43:55.526 --> 01:43:58.386 A:middle
my game will automatically
run on all Apple platforms.

01:43:59.296 --> 01:43:59.756 A:middle
Thank you.

01:43:59.926 --> 01:44:00.706 A:middle

01:43:59.926 --> 01:44:00.706 A:middle
Now, back to Andreas.

01:44:01.516 --> 01:44:06.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:44:07.046 --> 01:44:08.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Norman.

01:44:08.156 --> 01:44:10.386 A:middle
All right, so just quickly
review the most important points

01:44:10.386 --> 01:44:11.066 A:middle
we talked about.

01:44:12.146 --> 01:44:15.206 A:middle
There are now four Apple
OS platforms, each of them

01:44:15.306 --> 01:44:17.366 A:middle
with their own App Store that
you can bring your ideas to.

01:44:18.446 --> 01:44:21.996 A:middle
And today we added a large
variety of new extension points

01:44:22.036 --> 01:44:24.916 A:middle
that allow you to hook
even deeper into our OS's.

01:44:25.486 --> 01:44:27.216 A:middle
Perhaps most importantly,
we recommend

01:44:27.216 --> 01:44:30.306 A:middle
that you consider creating
an iMessage App and also

01:44:30.306 --> 01:44:32.086 A:middle
that you integrate
your apps with SiriKit.

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:33.956 A:middle
But these are just two

01:44:33.956 --> 01:44:36.066 A:middle
of the many new APIs we
are announcing today.

01:44:36.996 --> 01:44:39.336 A:middle
And support for all of
them will be provided

01:44:39.366 --> 01:44:41.376 A:middle
by a new version
of our Xcode IDE.

01:44:41.696 --> 01:44:44.876 A:middle
Xcode 8 is going to run on
Mac OS El Capitan and Sierra.

01:44:44.936 --> 01:44:46.656 A:middle
Now, of course, it
also has support

01:44:46.656 --> 01:44:48.046 A:middle
for developing with Swift 3.

01:44:49.376 --> 01:44:51.736 A:middle
Now, all these technologies
are available for download

01:44:51.736 --> 01:44:53.946 A:middle
from the WWDC Attendee
Portal today,

01:44:53.946 --> 01:44:56.916 A:middle
so you can get early access and
use the time later in the year

01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:59.616 A:middle
when we ship out products to
get ready for all launches,

01:44:59.756 --> 01:45:02.506 A:middle
create even more powerful and
unique apps for your users.

create even more powerful and
unique apps for your users.

01:45:03.816 --> 01:45:05.726 A:middle
Also, go and check out the
new Swift Playgrounds app,

01:45:06.216 --> 01:45:07.746 A:middle
which we're including in
the iOS X Developer Preview.

01:45:07.746 --> 01:45:10.286 A:middle
I think you're going to
have a ton of fun with it

01:45:10.666 --> 01:45:12.736 A:middle
and perhaps you'll consider
creating additional content

01:45:12.796 --> 01:45:15.036 A:middle
for your kids to start
learning how to program Swift.

01:45:16.256 --> 01:45:18.096 A:middle
Now, there are many
opportunities here

01:45:18.096 --> 01:45:20.156 A:middle
at the conference for you to
learn more about everything

01:45:20.156 --> 01:45:21.196 A:middle
that we announced today.

01:45:21.196 --> 01:45:23.046 A:middle
There's more than 100
sessions you can attend

01:45:23.046 --> 01:45:23.896 A:middle
and even more labs.

01:45:24.296 --> 01:45:27.106 A:middle
You can meet every engineer
you see on site one on one.

01:45:27.106 --> 01:45:29.296 A:middle
They are here to answer
you specific questions.

01:45:30.296 --> 01:45:32.006 A:middle
So I hope you enjoyed the
session and I'll see you

01:45:32.006 --> 01:45:33.376 A:middle
around later this week.

01:45:34.516 --> 01:45:40.500 A:middle
