[ Music ]

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning and
welcome to session 406,

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:26.036 A:middle
Optimizing App Startup Time.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:29.136 A:middle
My name is Nick Kledzik,
and today my colleague Louis

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:31.096 A:middle
and I are going to take
you on a guided tour

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:32.276 A:middle
of how a process launches.

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:38.226 A:middle
Now you may be wondering,
is this topic right for me.

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:41.406 A:middle
So we had our crack developing
marketing team do some research,

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.786 A:middle
and they determined there are
three groups that will benefit

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:44.696 A:middle
by listening to this talk.

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:49.646 A:middle
The first, is app
developers that have a app

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:50.646 A:middle
that launches to slowly.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
The second group, is app
developers that don't want to be

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:56.366 A:middle
in the first group [laughter].

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.786 A:middle
And lastly, is anyone
who's just really curious


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.786 A:middle
And lastly, is anyone
who's just really curious

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:03.196 A:middle
about how the OS operates.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.906 A:middle
So this talk is going to
be divided in two sections,

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:10.276 A:middle
the first is more theory and
the second more practical,

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:11.906 A:middle
I'll be doing the
first theory part.

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.156 A:middle
And in it I'll be walking
you through all the steps

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:17.846 A:middle
that happen, all
the way up to main.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.356 A:middle
But in order for
you to understand

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:21.916 A:middle
and appreciate all
the steps I first need

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:25.226 A:middle
to give you a crash course
on Mach-O and Virtual Memory.

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:29.416 A:middle
So first some Mach-O
terminology, quickly.

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:31.566 A:middle
Mach-O is a bunch of file types

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.106 A:middle
for different run
time executables.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:37.146 A:middle
So the first executable, that's
the main binary in an app,

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:39.096 A:middle
it's also the main binary
in an app extension.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.676 A:middle
A dylib is a dynamic library,
on other platforms meet,

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:47.096 A:middle
you may know those
as DSOs or DLLs.

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:50.936 A:middle
Our platform also has another
kind of thing called a bundle.

00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:52.986 A:middle
Now a bundle's a
special kind of dylib

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:55.646 A:middle
that you cannot link against,
all you can do is load it

00:01:55.646 --> 00:01:57.866 A:middle
at run time by an
dlopen and that's used

00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:58.896 A:middle
on a Mac OS for plug-ins.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:01.816 A:middle
Last, is the term image.

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.646 A:middle
Image refers to any
of these three types.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.266 A:middle
And I'll be using
that term a lot.

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:08.606 A:middle
And lastly, the term
framework is very overloaded

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:12.416 A:middle
in our industry, but in this
context, a framework is a dylib

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:14.276 A:middle
with a special directory
structure around it

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:15.796 A:middle
to holds files needed
by that dylib.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.396 A:middle
So let's dive right into
the Mach-O image format.

00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:22.796 A:middle
A Mach-O image is
divided into segments,

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:27.156 A:middle
by convention all segment names
are, use upper case letters.

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:33.446 A:middle
Now, each segment is always
a multiple of the page size,

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.266 A:middle
in this example the text
is 3 pages, the DATA

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.466 A:middle
and LINKEDIT are each one page.

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:41.106 A:middle
Now the page size is determined
by the hardware, for arm64,

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:45.006 A:middle
the page size is 16K,
everything else it's 4k.

00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:49.286 A:middle
Now another way to look
at the thing is sections.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:51.126 A:middle
So sections is something
the compiler omits.

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.156 A:middle
But sections are really just
a subrange of a segment,

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.976 A:middle
they don't have any of the
constraints of being page size,

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:58.706 A:middle
but they are non-overlapping.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:06.556 A:middle
Now, the most common segment
names are TEXT, DATA, LINKEDIT,

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:09.796 A:middle
in fact almost every binary has
exactly those three segments.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.166 A:middle
You can add custom ones but it
usually doesn't add any value.

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:14.666 A:middle
So what are these used for?

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:17.216 A:middle
Well TEXT is at the
start of the file,

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:18.326 A:middle
it contains the Mach header,

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:20.586 A:middle
it contains any machine
instructions as well

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.456 A:middle
as any read only constant
such as c strings.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.366 A:middle
The DATA segment is rewrite,

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.486 A:middle
the DATA segment contains
all your global variables.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:29.956 A:middle
And lastly, is the LINKEDIT.

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.576 A:middle
Now the LINKEDIT doesn't
contain your functions

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:34.706 A:middle
of global variables, a
LINKEDIT contains information

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:37.166 A:middle
about your function of variables
such as their name and address.

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:42.286 A:middle
You may have also heard of
universal files, what are they?

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:45.746 A:middle
Well suppose you build
an iOS app, for a 64 bit,

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:48.306 A:middle
and now you have
this Mach-O file,

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:50.356 A:middle
so what happens the next code
when you say you also want

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.216 A:middle
to build it for 32 bit devices?

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:57.386 A:middle
When you rebuild, Xcode will
build another separate Mach-O

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:59.596 A:middle
file, this one built
for 32 bits, RB7.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:04.236 A:middle
And then those two files are
merged into a third file,

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:05.646 A:middle
called the Mach-O
universal file.

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.506 A:middle
And that has a header
at the start,

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:09.716 A:middle
and all the header has a
list of all the architectures

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.466 A:middle
and what their offsets
are in the file.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:14.596 A:middle
And that header is
also one page in size.

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:16.726 A:middle
Now you may be wondering,

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:19.046 A:middle
why are the segments
multiple page sizes?

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:21.776 A:middle
Why is the header a page sizes,
and it's wasting a lot of space.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:24.666 A:middle
Well the reason everything
is page based has to do

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.246 A:middle
with our next topic
which is virtual memory.

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:28.746 A:middle
So what is virtual memory?

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.886 A:middle
Some of you may know the
adage in software engineering

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:33.976 A:middle
that every problem can be solved

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:35.096 A:middle
by adding a level
of indirection.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.916 A:middle
So the problem with, that
virtual memory solves,

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.856 A:middle
is how do you manage
all your physical RAM

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:42.996 A:middle
when you have all
these processes?

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.006 A:middle
So they added a little
of indirection.

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:48.996 A:middle
Every process is a logical
address space which gets mapped

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.376 A:middle
to some physical page of RAM.

00:04:51.246 --> 00:04:55.866 A:middle
Now this mapping does not
have to be one to one,

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.096 A:middle
you could have logical addresses
that go to no physical RAM


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.096 A:middle
you could have logical addresses
that go to no physical RAM

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:02.176 A:middle
and you can have multiple
logical addresses that go

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:03.666 A:middle
to the same physical RAM.

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.496 A:middle
This offered lots of
opportunities here.

00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:08.856 A:middle
So what can you do with VM?

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:10.996 A:middle
Well first, if you
have a logical address

00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:14.066 A:middle
that does not map to any
physical RAM, when you access

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.466 A:middle
that address in your
process, a page fault happens.

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:19.106 A:middle
At that point the kernel stops
that thread and tries to figure

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:20.346 A:middle
out what needs to happen.

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:24.826 A:middle
The next thing is if
you have two processes,

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:26.526 A:middle
with different logical
addresses,

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.066 A:middle
mapping to the same
physical page,

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:30.946 A:middle
those two processes are now
sharing the same bit of RAM.

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.596 A:middle
You now have sharing
between processes.

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:37.056 A:middle
Another interesting feature
is file backed mapping.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:40.156 A:middle
Rather than actually
read an entire file

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:43.186 A:middle
into RAM you can tell the VM
system through the mmap call,

00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:47.226 A:middle
the I want this slice
of this file mapped

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:49.046 A:middle
to this address range
in my process.

00:05:49.756 --> 00:05:50.666 A:middle
So why would you do that?

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:53.196 A:middle
Well rather than having
to read the entire file,

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:54.486 A:middle
by having that mapping set up,

00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:57.556 A:middle
as you first access those
different addresses,

00:05:57.636 --> 00:06:01.266 A:middle
as if you had read it in memory,
each time you access an address


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.636 --> 00:06:01.266 A:middle
as if you had read it in memory,
each time you access an address

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:03.046 A:middle
that hasn't been accessed before
it will cause a page fault,

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:04.766 A:middle
the kernel will read
just that one page.

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.176 A:middle
And that gives you lazy
reading of your file.

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:10.066 A:middle
Now we can put all
these features together,

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:12.456 A:middle
and what I told you about
Mach-O you now realize

00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:14.896 A:middle
that the TEXT segment
of any of that dylib

00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:17.596 A:middle
or image can be mapped
into multiple processes,

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.816 A:middle
it will be read lazily, and
all those pages can be shared

00:06:20.816 --> 00:06:21.796 A:middle
between those processes.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.366 A:middle
What about the DATA segment?

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:28.676 A:middle
The DATA segment is read, write,

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.956 A:middle
so for that we have trick
called copy on write,

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:34.776 A:middle
it's kind of similar to
the, cloning that seen

00:06:34.776 --> 00:06:35.686 A:middle
in the Apple file system.

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:39.876 A:middle
What copy and write does is it
optimistically shares the DATA

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:41.176 A:middle
page between all the processes.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:45.466 A:middle
What happens when one process,
as long as they're only reading

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:46.796 A:middle
from the global variables
that sharing works.

00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:49.056 A:middle
But as soon as one process
actually tries to write

00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:51.586 A:middle
to its DATA page, the
copy and write happens.

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:54.156 A:middle
The copy and write causes
the kernel to make a copy

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:55.676 A:middle
of that page into
another physical RAM

00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:57.886 A:middle
and redirect the
mapping to go to that.

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:01.256 A:middle
So that one process now has
its own copy of that page.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:01.256 A:middle
So that one process now has
its own copy of that page.

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.536 A:middle
Which brings us to clean
versus dirty pages.

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
So that copy is considered
a dirty page.

00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:08.916 A:middle
A dirty page is something

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:11.236 A:middle
that contains process
specific information.

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:12.926 A:middle
A clean page is something

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:14.586 A:middle
that the kernel could
regenerate later if needed

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:15.916 A:middle
such as rereading from disc.

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:19.296 A:middle
So dirty pages are much more
expensive than clean pages.

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:22.816 A:middle
And the last thing is the
permission boundaries are

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:23.716 A:middle
on page boundaries.

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:28.526 A:middle
By that I mean the permissions
are you can mark a page

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.156 A:middle
readable, writable,
or executable,

00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:32.766 A:middle
or any combination of those.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:34.456 A:middle
So let's put this all together,

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:35.586 A:middle
I talked about the
Mach-O format,

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:36.716 A:middle
something about virtual memory,

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:38.026 A:middle
let's see how they
play together.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:40.776 A:middle
Now I'm going to skip
ahead and talk a little,

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:43.976 A:middle
how the dyld operates and in a
few moments I'll actually walk

00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:44.876 A:middle
you through this but for now,

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:45.996 A:middle
I just want to show
you how this maps

00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:47.436 A:middle
between Mach-O and
virtual memory.

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:51.246 A:middle
So we have a dylib file here,
and rather than reading it

00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:52.786 A:middle
in memory we've mapped
it in memory.

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:57.476 A:middle
So, in memory this dylib
would have taken eight pages.

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:01.576 A:middle
The savings, why it's
different is these ZeroFills.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:01.576 A:middle
The savings, why it's
different is these ZeroFills.

00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:04.066 A:middle
So it turns out most global
variables are zero initially.

00:08:04.456 --> 00:08:06.066 A:middle
So the static [inaudible]
makes an optimization

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:08.276 A:middle
that moves all the zero
global variables to the end,

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:09.986 A:middle
and then takes up no disc space.

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:12.076 A:middle
And instead, we use
the VM feature

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:14.436 A:middle
to tell the VM the first
time this page is accessed,

00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:15.106 A:middle
fill it with zero's.

00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:17.216 A:middle
So it requires no reading.

00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:21.066 A:middle
So the first thing dyld
has to do is it has to look

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:23.586 A:middle
at the Mach header, in
memory, in this process.

00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:25.656 A:middle
So it'll be looking at
the top box in memory,

00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:27.806 A:middle
when that happens,
there's nothing there,

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:29.966 A:middle
there's no mapping to a physical
page so a page fault happens.

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:31.996 A:middle
At that point the kernel
realizes this is mapped

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:34.765 A:middle
to a file, so it'll read
the first page of the file,

00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:37.535 A:middle
place it into physical
RAM, set the mapping to it.

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:41.145 A:middle
Now dyld can actually start
reading through the Mach header.

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:43.496 A:middle
It reads through the Mach
header, the Mach header says oh,

00:08:43.496 --> 00:08:44.155 A:middle
there's some information

00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:45.506 A:middle
in the LINKEDIT segment
you need to look at.

00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:47.836 A:middle
So again, dyld drops down what's

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:49.786 A:middle
in the bottom box
in process one.

00:08:50.676 --> 00:08:51.936 A:middle
Which again causes a page fault.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.256 A:middle
Kernel services it by reading

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:57.036 A:middle
into another physical
page of RAM, the LINKEDIT.

00:08:57.226 --> 00:08:58.906 A:middle
Now dyld can expect a LINKEDIT.

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:01.516 A:middle
Now in process, the
LINKEDIT will tell dyld,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:01.516 A:middle
Now in process, the
LINKEDIT will tell dyld,

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:03.716 A:middle
you need to make some
fix ups to this DATA page

00:09:03.716 --> 00:09:05.986 A:middle
to make this dylib runable.

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:11.026 A:middle
So, the same thing happens,
dyld is now, reads some data

00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:14.226 A:middle
from the DATA page, but there's
something different here.

00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:16.306 A:middle
dyld is actually going
to write something back,

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.756 A:middle
it's actually going to
change that DATA page

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.546 A:middle
and at this point, a
copy on write happens.

00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:21.286 A:middle
And this page becomes dirty.

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:26.036 A:middle
So what would have been
8 pages of dirty RAM

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:28.626 A:middle
if I just malloced eight pages
and then the read the stuff

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:30.026 A:middle
into it I would have
eight pages of dirty RAM.

00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:32.016 A:middle
But now I only have one page of
dirty RAM and two clean pages.

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:33.436 A:middle
So what's going to happen

00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:35.246 A:middle
when the second process
loads the same dylib.

00:09:35.816 --> 00:09:38.876 A:middle
So in the second process dyld
goes through the same steps.

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:39.926 A:middle
First it looks at
the Mach header,

00:09:40.786 --> 00:09:43.686 A:middle
but this time the kernel says,
ah, I already have that page

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:46.676 A:middle
in RAM somewhere so it simply
redirects the mapping to reuse

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:48.036 A:middle
that page no iO was done.

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:50.506 A:middle
The same think with
LINKEDIT, it's much faster.

00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:54.636 A:middle
Now we get to the DATA page,
at this point the kernel has

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.506 A:middle
to look to see if the DATA page,

00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:59.216 A:middle
the clean copy already still
exists in RAM somewhere,

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.496 A:middle
and if it does it can reuse it,
if not, it has to reread it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.496 A:middle
and if it does it can reuse it,
if not, it has to reread it.

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:04.986 A:middle
And now in this process,
dyld will dirty the RAM.

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:09.356 A:middle
Now the last step is the
LINKEDIT is only needed while

00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:10.666 A:middle
dyld is doing its operations.

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.316 A:middle
So it can hint to the
kernel, once it's done,

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
that it doesn't really need
these LINKEDIT pages anymore,

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:17.746 A:middle
you can reclaim them when
someone else needs RAM.

00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:21.896 A:middle
So the result is now we have two
processes sharing these dylibs,

00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:23.506 A:middle
each one would have
been eight pages,

00:10:23.626 --> 00:10:25.206 A:middle
or a total of 16 dirty pages,

00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:27.086 A:middle
but now we only have
two dirty pages

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:28.436 A:middle
and one clean, shared page.

00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:33.086 A:middle
Two other minor things
I want to go over is

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:35.846 A:middle
that how security effects dyld,
these two big security things

00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:36.726 A:middle
that have impacted dyld.

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:39.946 A:middle
So one is ASLR, address
space layout randomization,

00:10:40.726 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
this is a decade or
two old technology,

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.636 A:middle
where basically you
randomize the load address.

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:50.456 A:middle
The second is code signing, it
has to, many of you have had

00:10:50.456 --> 00:10:53.156 A:middle
to deal with code signing,
in Xcode, and you think

00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:56.496 A:middle
of code signing as, you
run a cryptographic hash

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:59.666 A:middle
over the entire file, and then
sign it with your signature.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.016 --> 00:11:03.186 A:middle
Well, in order to
validate that run time,

00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:04.966 A:middle
that means the entire file
would have to be re-read.

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:07.326 A:middle
So instead what actually
happens at build time,

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:10.986 A:middle
is every single page of your
Mach-O file gets its own

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:13.036 A:middle
individual cryptographic hash.

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:15.136 A:middle
And all those hashes are
stored in the LINKEDIT.

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:19.346 A:middle
This allows each
page to be validated

00:11:19.556 --> 00:11:21.046 A:middle
that it hasn't been
tampered with and was owned

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:22.666 A:middle
by you at page in time.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:26.656 A:middle
Okay, so we finished the
crash course, now I'm going

00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:28.036 A:middle
to walk you from exec to main.

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:33.006 A:middle
So what is exec?

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.306 A:middle
Exec is a system call.

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:38.306 A:middle
When you trap into the kernel,
you basically say I want

00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:40.156 A:middle
to replace this process
with this new program.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:42.926 A:middle
The kernel wipes the entire
address space and maps

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:44.646 A:middle
in that executable
you specified.

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:47.496 A:middle
Now for ASLR it maps it
in at a random address.

00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:51.866 A:middle
The next thing it does is from
that random, back down to zero,

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:54.406 A:middle
it marks that whole
region inaccessible,

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:56.456 A:middle
ad by that I mean it's
marked not readable,

00:11:56.456 --> 00:11:57.736 A:middle
not writeable, not executable.

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
The size of that region is at
least 4KB to 32 bit processes


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
The size of that region is at
least 4KB to 32 bit processes

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.546 A:middle
and at least 4GB for
64 bit processes.

00:12:04.896 --> 00:12:06.856 A:middle
This catches any NULL
pointer references

00:12:07.256 --> 00:12:08.656 A:middle
and also foresees more bits,

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:11.506 A:middle
it catches any, pointer
truncations.

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:17.556 A:middle
Now, life was easy for
the first couple decades,

00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:19.546 A:middle
of Unix because all I
do is map a program,

00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:20.856 A:middle
set the PC into it,
and start running it.

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.506 A:middle
And then shared libraries
were invented.

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:24.686 A:middle
So who loads dylibs?

00:12:25.636 --> 00:12:27.666 A:middle
They quickly realize that they
got really complicated fast

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:29.646 A:middle
and the kernel people didn't
want the kernel to do it,

00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:32.366 A:middle
so instead a helper
program was created.

00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:34.116 A:middle
In our platform it's
called dyld.

00:12:34.706 --> 00:12:37.056 A:middle
On other Unix's you
may know it as LD.SO.

00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:40.056 A:middle
So when the kernel's done
mapping a process it now maps

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:42.666 A:middle
another Mach-O called
dyld into that process

00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:44.146 A:middle
at another random address.

00:12:44.926 --> 00:12:48.066 A:middle
Sets the PC into dyld and
let's dyld finish launching

00:12:49.106 --> 00:12:50.416 A:middle
the process.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.066 A:middle
So now dyld's running in
process and its job is

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:55.706 A:middle
to load all the dylibs
that you depend on

00:12:55.936 --> 00:12:57.076 A:middle
and get everything
prepared and running.

00:12:58.186 --> 00:12:59.276 A:middle
So let's walk through
those steps.

00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:01.446 A:middle
This is a whole bunch
of steps and it has sort


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:01.446 A:middle
This is a whole bunch
of steps and it has sort

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:03.356 A:middle
of a timeline along
the bottom here,

00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:05.196 A:middle
as we walk through these we'll
walk through the timeline.

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:10.026 A:middle
So first thing, is dyld has to
map all the dependent dylibs.

00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:12.066 A:middle
Well what are the
dependent dylibs?

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:16.246 A:middle
To find those it first reads the
header of the main executable

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.466 A:middle
that the kernel already mapped
in that header is a list

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:19.556 A:middle
of all the dependent libraries.

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:21.466 A:middle
So it's got to parse that out.

00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:23.876 A:middle
Then it has to find each dylib.

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:27.946 A:middle
And once it's found each dylib
it has to open and run the start

00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:30.776 A:middle
of each file, it needs to make
sure that it is a Mach-O file,

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:33.816 A:middle
validate it, find
its code signature,

00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:35.246 A:middle
register that code
signature to the kernel.

00:13:35.866 --> 00:13:39.716 A:middle
And then it can actually
call mmap

00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:40.896 A:middle
at each segment in that dylib.

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:43.756 A:middle
Okay, so that's pretty simple.

00:13:44.506 --> 00:13:47.266 A:middle
Your app knows about
the kernel dyld,

00:13:47.266 --> 00:13:50.046 A:middle
dyld then says oh this app
depends on A and B dylib,

00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:51.166 A:middle
load the two of those,
we're done.

00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:53.566 A:middle
Well, it gets more
complicated, because A.dylib

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:56.236 A:middle
and B.dylib themselves could
depend upon the dylibs.

00:13:57.526 --> 00:14:00.426 A:middle
So dyld has to do the same
thing over again for each


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.526 --> 00:14:00.426 A:middle
So dyld has to do the same
thing over again for each

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:02.536 A:middle
of those dylibs, and each
of the dylibs may depend

00:14:02.536 --> 00:14:04.036 A:middle
on something that's already
loaded or something new

00:14:04.036 --> 00:14:05.736 A:middle
so it has to determine whether
it's already been loaded or not,

00:14:05.736 --> 00:14:07.176 A:middle
and if not, it needs to load it.

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:09.276 A:middle
So, this continues on and on.

00:14:10.676 --> 00:14:13.236 A:middle
And eventually it has
everything loaded.

00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:16.616 A:middle
Now if you look at a
process, the average process

00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:20.056 A:middle
in our system, loads anywhere
between 1 to 400 dylibs,

00:14:20.056 --> 00:14:22.296 A:middle
so that's a lot of
dylibs to be loaded.

00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:26.506 A:middle
Luckily most of those are OS
dylibs, and we do a lot of work

00:14:26.506 --> 00:14:28.576 A:middle
when building the
OS to pre-calculate

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
and pre-cache a lot of
the work that dyld has

00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:31.516 A:middle
to do to load these things.

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:34.046 A:middle
So OS dylibs load
very, very quickly.

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:40.556 A:middle
So now we've loaded all the
dylibs, but they're all sitting

00:14:40.556 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
in their floating
independent of each other,

00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:43.336 A:middle
and now we actually have
to bind them together.

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.406 A:middle
That's called fix-ups.

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.166 A:middle
But one thing about
fix-ups is we've learned,

00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:50.776 A:middle
because of code signing we can't
actually alter instructions.

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:53.916 A:middle
So how does one dylib
call into another dylib

00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.966 A:middle
if you can't change the
instructions of how it calls?

00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:57.986 A:middle
Well, we call back
our old friend,

00:14:58.036 --> 00:14:59.306 A:middle
and we add a lot
of old indirection.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.486 A:middle
So our code-gen, is
called dynamic PIC.

00:15:02.976 --> 00:15:04.186 A:middle
It's positioned independent
code,

00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:06.396 A:middle
meaning the code can be loaded
into the address and is dynamic,

00:15:06.396 --> 00:15:09.466 A:middle
meaning things are,
addressed indirectly.

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:12.026 A:middle
What that means is to call
for one thing to another,

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:15.276 A:middle
the co-gen actually creates
a pointer in the DATA segment

00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:17.296 A:middle
and that pointer points
to what you want to call.

00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:21.916 A:middle
The code loads that pointer
and jumps to the pointer.

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:24.986 A:middle
So all dyld is doing is
fixing up pointers and data.

00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
Now there's two main
categories of fix-ups, rebasing

00:15:29.476 --> 00:15:30.806 A:middle
and binding, so what's
the difference?

00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:33.626 A:middle
So rebasing is if you have
a pointer that's pointing

00:15:33.626 --> 00:15:37.106 A:middle
to within your image, and any
adjustments needed by that,

00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:38.686 A:middle
the second is binding.

00:15:39.016 --> 00:15:41.116 A:middle
Binding is if you're pointing
something outside your image.

00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:43.256 A:middle
And they each need to
be fixed up differently,

00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:44.476 A:middle
so I'll go through the steps.

00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.686 A:middle
But first, if you're
curious, there's a command,

00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:49.586 A:middle
dyld info with a bunch
of options on it.

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:52.866 A:middle
You can run this on any binary
and you'll see all the fix-ups

00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:57.546 A:middle
that dyld will have to be doing
for that binary to prepare it.

00:15:58.816 --> 00:15:59.536 A:middle
So rebasing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.816 --> 00:16:03.896 A:middle
Well in the old age you could
specify a preferred load address

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:07.596 A:middle
for each dylib, and that
preferred load address was the

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:10.106 A:middle
static linker and dyld work
together such that, if you load,

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:12.336 A:middle
it to that preferred load
address, all the pointers

00:16:12.336 --> 00:16:14.476 A:middle
and data that was supposed to
code internally, were correct

00:16:14.476 --> 00:16:15.806 A:middle
and dyld wouldn't have
to do any fix-ups.

00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:17.776 A:middle
But these days, with ASLR,

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:21.396 A:middle
your dylib is loaded
to a random address.

00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:25.256 A:middle
It's slid to some other address,
which means all those pointers

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:27.256 A:middle
and data are now still
pointed to the old address.

00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:31.346 A:middle
So in order to fix those up,
we need to calculate the slide,

00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.236 A:middle
which is how much has
it moved, and for each

00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:34.996 A:middle
of those interior pointers,

00:16:35.146 --> 00:16:36.906 A:middle
to basically add the
slide value to them.

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:41.446 A:middle
So rebasing means going
through all your data pointers,

00:16:41.656 --> 00:16:43.846 A:middle
that are internal, and basically
adding a slide to them.

00:16:44.286 --> 00:16:46.016 A:middle
So the concept is very
simple, read, add,

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:46.726 A:middle
write, read, add, write.

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:49.066 A:middle
But where are those
data pointers?

00:16:49.596 --> 00:16:51.166 A:middle
Where those pointers
are in your segment,

00:16:51.496 --> 00:16:52.986 A:middle
are encoded in the
LINKEDIT segment.

00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:56.926 A:middle
Now, at this point, all we've
had is everything mapped in,

00:16:57.256 --> 00:16:58.446 A:middle
so when we start doing rebasing,

00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.276 A:middle
we're actually causing
page faults to page


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.276 A:middle
we're actually causing
page faults to page

00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:01.386 A:middle
in all the DATA pages.

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:04.406 A:middle
And then we causing copy and
writes as we're changing them.

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:07.496 A:middle
So rebasing can sometimes be
expensive because of all the iO.

00:17:07.996 --> 00:17:10.336 A:middle
But one trick we do is
we do it sequentially

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:11.736 A:middle
and from the kernel's
point of view,

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:14.156 A:middle
it sees data faults
happen sequentially.

00:17:14.506 --> 00:17:17.246 A:middle
And when it sees that, the
kernel, is reading ahead for us

00:17:17.596 --> 00:17:18.935 A:middle
which makes the iO less costly.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.695 A:middle
So next is binding,
binding is for pointers

00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:25.266 A:middle
that point outside your dylib.

00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:28.636 A:middle
They're actually bound by name,
they're actually is the string,

00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:30.796 A:middle
in this case, malloc
stored in the link edit,

00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:33.256 A:middle
that says this data pointer
needs to point to malloc.

00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:36.676 A:middle
So at run time, dyld needs to
actually find the implementation

00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:41.396 A:middle
of that symbol, which
requires a lot of computation,

00:17:41.396 --> 00:17:42.346 A:middle
looking through symbol tables.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.026 A:middle
Once it's found, that
values that's stored

00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:44.856 A:middle
in that data pointer.

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.256 A:middle
So this is way more
computationally complex

00:17:47.256 --> 00:17:48.076 A:middle
than rebasing is.

00:17:48.616 --> 00:17:50.056 A:middle
But there's very little iO

00:17:50.056 --> 00:17:56.096 A:middle
because rebasing has done
most of the iO already.

00:17:56.406 --> 00:17:59.466 A:middle
Next, so ObjC has a
bunch of DATA structures,

00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:01.676 A:middle
class DATA structure which
is a pointer to its methods


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:01.676 A:middle
class DATA structure which
is a pointer to its methods

00:18:01.676 --> 00:18:03.216 A:middle
and a pointer to a super
gloss and so forth.

00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:06.186 A:middle
Almost all those are fixed
up, via rebasing or binding.

00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:10.776 A:middle
But there's a few extra things
that ObjC run time requires.

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:13.726 A:middle
The first is ObjC
is dynamic language

00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:16.806 A:middle
and you can request a class
become substantiated by name.

00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:19.286 A:middle
So that means the ObjC run
time has to maintain a table

00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:21.096 A:middle
of all names of which
class that they map to.

00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:23.546 A:middle
So every time you load
something, it defines a class,

00:18:23.756 --> 00:18:25.556 A:middle
its name needs to be
registered with a global table.

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:28.546 A:middle
Next, in C++ you may have heard

00:18:28.546 --> 00:18:32.216 A:middle
of the fragile ivar
problem, sorry.

00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:33.986 A:middle
Fragile base class problem.

00:18:35.116 --> 00:18:37.316 A:middle
We don't have that problem
with ObjC because one

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.116 A:middle
of the fix-ups we do is
we change the offsets

00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:41.206 A:middle
of all the ivars
dynamically, at load time.

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:46.616 A:middle
Next, in ObjC you
can define categories

00:18:46.616 --> 00:18:49.276 A:middle
which change the
methods of another class.

00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:52.006 A:middle
Sometimes those are in classes
that are not in your image

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:55.706 A:middle
on another dylib, that,
those method fix-ups have

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:56.596 A:middle
to be applied at this point.

00:18:58.156 --> 00:19:00.646 A:middle
And lastly, ObjC [inaudible] is
based on selectors being unique


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.156 --> 00:19:00.646 A:middle
And lastly, ObjC [inaudible] is
based on selectors being unique

00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:02.806 A:middle
so we need unique selectors.

00:19:05.036 --> 00:19:07.286 A:middle
So now the work that we've
done all the DATA fix-ups,

00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:10.076 A:middle
now we can do all
the DATA fix-ups

00:19:10.076 --> 00:19:11.946 A:middle
that can be basically
described statically.

00:19:12.256 --> 00:19:14.226 A:middle
So now's our chance to
do dynamic DATA fix ups.

00:19:14.816 --> 00:19:17.476 A:middle
So in C++, you can
have an initializer,

00:19:17.476 --> 00:19:19.606 A:middle
you can say [inaudible] equals
whatever expression you want.

00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:23.256 A:middle
That arbitrary expression,
at this time needs to be run

00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:24.466 A:middle
and it's run at this point now.

00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:28.566 A:middle
So the C++ compiler
generates, initiliazers

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:30.606 A:middle
for these arbitrary
DATA initialization.

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.486 A:middle
In ObjC, there's something
called the +load method.

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:37.356 A:middle
Now the +load method is
deprecated, we recommend

00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:38.056 A:middle
that you don't use it.

00:19:38.056 --> 00:19:39.586 A:middle
We recommend you use
a plus initialize.

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:41.506 A:middle
But if you have one,
it's run at this point.

00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:45.476 A:middle
So, now I have this big graph,

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:48.386 A:middle
we have your main executable
top, all the dylibs depend on,

00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:50.806 A:middle
this huge graph, we have
to run initializers.

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.586 A:middle
What order do we want them in?

00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:54.316 A:middle
Well, we run them bottom up.

00:19:54.316 --> 00:19:58.896 A:middle
And the reason is, when an
initialize is run it may need

00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:00.726 A:middle
to call up some dylib
and you want to make sure


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:00.726 A:middle
to call up some dylib
and you want to make sure

00:20:00.726 --> 00:20:02.506 A:middle
that dylibs already
ready to be called.

00:20:02.776 --> 00:20:04.986 A:middle
So by running the initializers
from the bottom all the way

00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.686 A:middle
up the app class
you're safe to call

00:20:07.686 --> 00:20:09.466 A:middle
into something you depend on.

00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:12.836 A:middle
So once all initiliazers
are done,

00:20:13.186 --> 00:20:15.646 A:middle
now we actually finally get
to call the main dyld program.

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:20.746 A:middle
So you survived this theory
part, you now all are experts

00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:22.826 A:middle
on how processes
start, you now know

00:20:22.826 --> 00:20:24.366 A:middle
that dyld is a helper program,

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:27.046 A:middle
it loads all dependent
libraries,

00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:31.116 A:middle
fixing up all the DATA
pages, runs initializers

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:32.066 A:middle
and then jumps to main.

00:20:32.556 --> 00:20:35.636 A:middle
So now to put all this
theory you've learned to use,

00:20:35.906 --> 00:20:37.196 A:middle
I'd like to hand
it over to Louis,

00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:40.276 A:middle
who will be giving you
some practical tips.

00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:47.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:48.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Nick.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.766 A:middle
We've all had that experience
where we pull our phone

00:20:52.766 --> 00:20:56.506 A:middle
out of our pocket, press the
home button, and then tap

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.796 A:middle
on an application
we want to run.

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:01.026 A:middle
And then tap, and tap, and
tap again on some button


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:01.026 A:middle
And then tap, and tap, and
tap again on some button

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.226 A:middle
because it's not responding.

00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:05.556 A:middle
When that happens to me,
it's really frustrating,

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:07.806 A:middle
and I want to delete the app.

00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:11.776 A:middle
I'm Louis Gerbarg I
work on dyld and today,

00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:13.756 A:middle
we're going to discuss how to
make your app launch instantly,

00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:16.000 A:middle
so your users are delighted.

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:25.996 A:middle
So first off, let's discuss
what we're going to go

00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:26.986 A:middle
through in this part
of the talk.

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:32.346 A:middle
We're going to discuss how fast
you actually need to launch

00:21:32.346 --> 00:21:35.066 A:middle
so that your users are going
to have a good experience.

00:21:36.816 --> 00:21:38.666 A:middle
How to measure that launch time.

00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:40.096 A:middle
Because it can be
very difficult.

00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:43.066 A:middle
The standard ways you measure
your application don't apply

00:21:43.066 --> 00:21:44.196 A:middle
before your code can run.

00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:47.316 A:middle
We're going to go through a list

00:21:47.316 --> 00:21:51.756 A:middle
of the common reasons why your
code, or sorry we're going to go

00:21:51.756 --> 00:21:53.716 A:middle
through a list of, why,

00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:55.566 A:middle
the common reasons your
launch can be slow.

00:21:56.646 --> 00:21:57.926 A:middle
And finally, we're
going to go through,

00:21:57.926 --> 00:22:00.566 A:middle
a way to fix all the slow downs.

00:21:57.926 --> 00:22:00.566 A:middle
a way to fix all the slow downs.

00:22:01.376 --> 00:22:03.346 A:middle
So I'm going to give
you a little spoiler

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:06.546 A:middle
for the rest of my talk.

00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:08.236 A:middle
You need to do less
stuff [laughter].

00:22:09.976 --> 00:22:12.756 A:middle
Now, I don't mean your app
should have less features,

00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:14.366 A:middle
I'm saying that your app has

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:16.616 A:middle
to do less things
before it's running.

00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:18.636 A:middle
We want you to figure
out how to defer some

00:22:18.636 --> 00:22:21.476 A:middle
of your launch behaviors
in order

00:22:21.476 --> 00:22:23.776 A:middle
to initialize them
just before execution.

00:22:26.326 --> 00:22:29.166 A:middle
So, let's discuss the goals,
how fast we want to launch.

00:22:29.606 --> 00:22:34.686 A:middle
Well, the launch time for
various platforms are different.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:38.946 A:middle
But, a good, a good
rule of thumb,

00:22:39.846 --> 00:22:42.206 A:middle
is 400 milliseconds
is a good launch time.

00:22:43.436 --> 00:22:48.336 A:middle
Now, the reason for that is
that we have launch animations

00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:50.266 A:middle
on the phone to give
a sense of continuity

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:53.326 A:middle
between the home screen
and your application,

00:22:53.326 --> 00:22:54.296 A:middle
when you see it execute.

00:22:54.856 --> 00:22:57.956 A:middle
And those animations take
time, and those animations,

00:22:59.146 --> 00:23:01.606 A:middle
give you a chance to
hide your launch times.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.146 --> 00:23:01.606 A:middle
give you a chance to
hide your launch times.

00:23:02.236 --> 00:23:03.806 A:middle
Obviously that may be different,

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:05.976 A:middle
in different context your app
extensions are also applications

00:23:05.976 --> 00:23:07.906 A:middle
that have to launch, they launch
in different amounts of time.

00:23:08.576 --> 00:23:10.556 A:middle
And a phone and TV, and a
watch are different things,

00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:14.066 A:middle
but 400 milliseconds
is a good target.

00:23:14.296 --> 00:23:16.526 A:middle
You can never take longer
than 20 seconds to launch.

00:23:16.556 --> 00:23:18.276 A:middle
If you take longer
than 20 seconds,

00:23:18.596 --> 00:23:20.446 A:middle
the OS will kill your
app, assuming it's going

00:23:20.446 --> 00:23:22.556 A:middle
through an infinite loop, and
we've all had that experience.

00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:24.396 A:middle
Where you click an app, it
comes up to a home screen,

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:26.396 A:middle
it doesn't respond, and
then it just goes away,

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.266 A:middle
and that's usually
what's happening here.

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:33.526 A:middle
Finally, it's very
important to test

00:23:33.526 --> 00:23:34.786 A:middle
on your slowest supported
device.

00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:36.886 A:middle
So those timers are
constant values

00:23:36.886 --> 00:23:39.426 A:middle
across all supported
devices on our platforms.

00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:43.686 A:middle
So, if you hit 400 milliseconds
on a iPhone 6S that you're using

00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:47.306 A:middle
for testing right now, you're
probably just barely hitting it,

00:23:47.306 --> 00:23:49.376 A:middle
you're probably not going
to hit it on a iPhone 5.

00:23:51.256 --> 00:23:54.116 A:middle
So let's do a recap of
Nick's part of the talk.

00:23:54.116 --> 00:23:56.576 A:middle
What do we have to do to
launch, we have to parse images,

00:23:56.576 --> 00:23:58.306 A:middle
map images, rebase
images, bind images,

00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.326 A:middle
run image initializers,
and then call main.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.326 A:middle
run image initializers,
and then call main.

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:02.506 A:middle
If that sounds like
a lot, it is,

00:24:02.706 --> 00:24:04.016 A:middle
I'm exhausted just saying it.

00:24:04.866 --> 00:24:09.756 A:middle
And then after that, we have
to call UIApplicationMain,

00:24:09.756 --> 00:24:11.776 A:middle
you'll see that in
your ObjC apps

00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:13.576 A:middle
or in your Swift apps
handled implicitly.

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:16.366 A:middle
That does some other things,

00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:19.016 A:middle
including running the
framework initializers

00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:20.026 A:middle
and loading your nibs.

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:22.686 A:middle
And then finally
you'll get a call back

00:24:22.686 --> 00:24:23.666 A:middle
in your application delegate.

00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:26.216 A:middle
I'm mentioning these last
two because those are counted

00:24:26.216 --> 00:24:28.526 A:middle
in those 400 milliseconds
times that I just mentioned.

00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:30.936 A:middle
But we're not going to
discuss them in this talk.

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:33.556 A:middle
If you want a better view
of what goes on there,

00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:36.916 A:middle
there's a talk from 2012, iOS
app performance responsiveness.

00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:39.246 A:middle
I highly recommend you go
back and view the video.

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:42.796 A:middle
But that's the last we're going
to speak of them right now.

00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:47.976 A:middle
So, let's move on, one more
thing I want to talk about,

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:49.446 A:middle
warm versus cold launches.

00:24:50.026 --> 00:24:51.276 A:middle
So when you launch an app,

00:24:51.436 --> 00:24:53.136 A:middle
we talk about warm
and cold launches.

00:24:53.546 --> 00:24:57.246 A:middle
And a warm launch is an app
where the application is already

00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:59.486 A:middle
in memory, either
because it's been launched

00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:02.736 A:middle
and quit previously, and it's
still sitting in the discache


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:02.736 A:middle
and quit previously, and it's
still sitting in the discache

00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:06.206 A:middle
in the kernel, or because
you just copied it over.

00:25:07.276 --> 00:25:10.416 A:middle
A cold launch is a launch
where it's not in the discache.

00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:15.216 A:middle
And a cold launch is generally
the more important to measure.

00:25:16.736 --> 00:25:18.666 A:middle
The reason a cold launch is more
important to measure is that's

00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:23.046 A:middle
when your user is launching an
app after rebooting the phone,

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:24.566 A:middle
or for the first
time in a long time,

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:26.956 A:middle
that's when you really
want it to be instant.

00:25:27.316 --> 00:25:29.456 A:middle
In order to measure
those, you really need

00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:30.946 A:middle
to reboot between measurements.

00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:34.876 A:middle
Having said that,
if you're working

00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:36.216 A:middle
on improving your warm launches,

00:25:36.216 --> 00:25:37.776 A:middle
your cold launches will
tend to improve also.

00:25:37.776 --> 00:25:40.016 A:middle
You can do rapid development
cycles on warm launches,

00:25:40.426 --> 00:25:46.246 A:middle
but then every so often,
test with a cold launch.

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:52.066 A:middle
So, how do we measure
time before main?

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:55.376 A:middle
Well, we have a built in
measurement system in dyld,

00:25:55.376 --> 00:25:58.446 A:middle
you can access it through
setting an environment variable.

00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.836 A:middle
DYLD Print Statistics.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.836 A:middle
DYLD Print Statistics.

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:04.746 A:middle
And it's been available
in shipping OSes actually,

00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:06.876 A:middle
but it prints out a lot

00:26:06.956 --> 00:26:08.596 A:middle
of internal debugging
information that's not

00:26:08.596 --> 00:26:10.796 A:middle
particularly useful, it's
missing some information

00:26:10.796 --> 00:26:11.796 A:middle
that you probably want.

00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:14.976 A:middle
And we're fixing that today.

00:26:16.926 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
So it's significantly
improved on the new OSes.

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:23.786 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:24.286 --> 00:26:27.626 A:middle
It's going to put out, a lot
more relevant information

00:26:27.626 --> 00:26:29.406 A:middle
for you that should
give you actionable ways

00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:30.816 A:middle
to improve your launch times.

00:26:31.286 --> 00:26:33.556 A:middle
And it will be available
in seed 2.

00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:39.986 A:middle
So, one other thing I want
to talk about with this,

00:26:40.556 --> 00:26:43.346 A:middle
is that the debugger
has to pause launch

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:46.736 A:middle
on every single dylib load
in order to parse the symbols

00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:50.116 A:middle
from your app and load your
break points, over a USB cable

00:26:50.116 --> 00:26:51.666 A:middle
that can be very time consuming.

00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:56.056 A:middle
But dyld knows about that and
it subtracts the debugger time

00:26:56.056 --> 00:26:57.406 A:middle
out from the numbers
it's registering.

00:26:57.456 --> 00:27:00.106 A:middle
So you don't have to worry
about it, but you notice it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.456 --> 00:27:00.106 A:middle
So you don't have to worry
about it, but you notice it

00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:02.506 A:middle
because dyld's going to give
you much smaller numbers

00:27:02.506 --> 00:27:04.356 A:middle
than you'll observe by looking
at the clock on the wall.

00:27:04.776 --> 00:27:06.546 A:middle
That's expected and understood,

00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:09.166 A:middle
and it's everything's going
correctly if you see that,

00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:12.326 A:middle
but I just wanted
to make note of it.

00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:19.176 A:middle
So let's move on, to setting an
environment variable in Xcode,

00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:22.326 A:middle
you just go to the
scheme editor,

00:27:23.046 --> 00:27:24.176 A:middle
and you add it like this.

00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:27.686 A:middle
Once you do that you'll get the
new console log into the output,

00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:28.936 A:middle
console output logged.

00:27:29.366 --> 00:27:31.486 A:middle
And what does that look like?

00:27:32.686 --> 00:27:34.346 A:middle
Well this is what the
output looks like,

00:27:34.346 --> 00:27:35.146 A:middle
and we have a time bar

00:27:35.146 --> 00:27:36.736 A:middle
on the bottom representing
the different parts of it.

00:27:37.366 --> 00:27:38.316 A:middle
And let's add one more thing.

00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:42.216 A:middle
Let's add an indicator for
that 400 milliseconds target,

00:27:42.756 --> 00:27:44.786 A:middle
which this app I'm
working on is not hitting.

00:27:46.096 --> 00:27:50.766 A:middle
So, if you look in, this is
in order basically the steps

00:27:50.766 --> 00:27:53.056 A:middle
that Nick discussed in order to
launch an app so let's just go

00:27:53.056 --> 00:27:53.716 A:middle
through them in order.

00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:59.806 A:middle
So dylib loading, the
big thing to understand

00:27:59.806 --> 00:28:01.706 A:middle
about dylib loading and the
slowdown that you'll see


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.806 --> 00:28:01.706 A:middle
about dylib loading and the
slowdown that you'll see

00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:04.516 A:middle
from it, is that embedded
dylibs can be expensive.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:07.636 A:middle
So Nick said an average app
can be 100 to 400 dylibs.

00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:11.056 A:middle
But OS dylibs are fast
because when we build the OS,

00:28:11.466 --> 00:28:14.146 A:middle
we have ways of pre-calculating
a lot of that data.

00:28:14.146 --> 00:28:16.956 A:middle
But we don't have every
dylib in every app

00:28:17.056 --> 00:28:18.306 A:middle
when we're building the OS.

00:28:18.476 --> 00:28:20.386 A:middle
We can't pre-calculate them
for the dylibs you embed

00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:21.466 A:middle
with your app, so we have to go

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
through a much slower
process as we load those.

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:30.276 A:middle
And the solution for
this is that we just need

00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:33.516 A:middle
to use fewer dylibs
and that can be rough.

00:28:34.026 --> 00:28:37.996 A:middle
And I'm not saying you can't
use any, but there are a couple

00:28:37.996 --> 00:28:39.976 A:middle
of options here you can
merge existing dylibs.

00:28:40.506 --> 00:28:43.766 A:middle
You can use static
archives and link them

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.896 A:middle
into both, into apps that way.

00:28:46.506 --> 00:28:50.706 A:middle
And you have an option to lazy
load, which is to use dlopen,

00:28:51.276 --> 00:28:55.166 A:middle
but dlopen causes some
subtle performance

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.746 A:middle
and correctness issues,
and it actually results

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:59.716 A:middle
in doing more work later
on, but it is deferred.

00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
So, it's a viable option but
you should think long and hard


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
So, it's a viable option but
you should think long and hard

00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:06.736 A:middle
about it and, I would discourage
it if at all possible.

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:12.066 A:middle
So, I have an app here that
currently has 26 dylibs,

00:29:12.566 --> 00:29:17.626 A:middle
And it's taking 240
milliseconds just to load those,

00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:22.096 A:middle
but if I change it and merge
those dylibs into two dylibs,

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:25.906 A:middle
then it only takes 20
milliseconds to load the dylibs.

00:29:26.326 --> 00:29:28.866 A:middle
So I can still have dylibs, I
can still use them to share,

00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:33.986 A:middle
functionality between my
app and my extension, but,

00:29:34.886 --> 00:29:36.336 A:middle
limiting them will
be very useful.

00:29:36.336 --> 00:29:39.156 A:middle
And I understand this is
a tradeoff you're making

00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:40.406 A:middle
between your development
convenience

00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:42.426 A:middle
and your application
launch time for your users.

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:45.316 A:middle
Because the more dylibs that you
have the easier it is to build

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:47.046 A:middle
and re-link your app in and
the faster your development

00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:47.446 A:middle
cycles are.

00:29:47.896 --> 00:29:51.396 A:middle
So you absolutely can and should
use some, but it's good to try

00:29:51.396 --> 00:29:54.236 A:middle
to target a limited number, we
would, I would say off hand,

00:29:54.236 --> 00:29:55.856 A:middle
a good target's about
a half a dozen.

00:29:57.596 --> 00:30:00.856 A:middle
So now that we've fixed up
our dylib count let's move


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.596 --> 00:30:00.856 A:middle
So now that we've fixed up
our dylib count let's move

00:30:00.856 --> 00:30:03.276 A:middle
on to the next place where
we're having a slowdown.

00:30:03.686 --> 00:30:08.486 A:middle
Between 350 milliseconds
in binding and rebasing.

00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:13.266 A:middle
So as Nick mentioned, rebasing
tends to be slower due to iO

00:30:13.266 --> 00:30:15.336 A:middle
and binding tends to be
computationally expensive

00:30:15.336 --> 00:30:16.396 A:middle
but it's already done the iO.

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:19.216 A:middle
So that iO is for both of
them and they're comingled,

00:30:19.216 --> 00:30:20.376 A:middle
the timing's also comingled.

00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:26.876 A:middle
So if we go in and look at
that, all that is fixing

00:30:26.876 --> 00:30:28.176 A:middle
up pointers in the DATA section.

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:32.176 A:middle
So what we have to do, is
just fix up fewer pointers.

00:30:32.906 --> 00:30:35.026 A:middle
Nick showed you a
tool you can run

00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:36.996 A:middle
to see what pointers
are being fixed

00:30:36.996 --> 00:30:38.586 A:middle
up in the DATA, section,
dyld info.

00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:43.046 A:middle
And it shows what segments
and sections things are in,

00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:45.006 A:middle
so that will give you a good
idea of what's being fixed up.

00:30:45.006 --> 00:30:48.466 A:middle
For instance, if you see
a symbol to an ObjC class

00:30:48.466 --> 00:30:51.516 A:middle
in ObjC section, that's probably

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.266 A:middle
that you have a bunch
of ObjC classes.

00:30:54.006 --> 00:30:57.336 A:middle
So, one of the things you
can do is you can just

00:30:57.336 --> 00:30:59.796 A:middle
to reduce the number
of ObjC classes object

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
and ivars that you have.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
and ivars that you have.

00:31:01.656 --> 00:31:04.866 A:middle
So there are a number
of coding styles

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:06.616 A:middle
that are encouraging
very small classes,

00:31:06.616 --> 00:31:08.036 A:middle
that maybe only have
one or two functions.

00:31:09.306 --> 00:31:15.086 A:middle
And, those particular patterns
may result in gradual slowdowns

00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:16.766 A:middle
of your applications as you
add more and more of them.

00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:18.416 A:middle
So you should be
careful about those.

00:31:18.726 --> 00:31:21.926 A:middle
Now having 100 or 1,000
classes isn't a problem,

00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:25.666 A:middle
but we've seen apps with
5, 10, 15, 20,000 classes.

00:31:26.026 --> 00:31:29.136 A:middle
And in those cases that can
add up to 7 or 800 milliseconds

00:31:29.136 --> 00:31:31.486 A:middle
to your launch time for
the kernel to page them in.

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:35.216 A:middle
Another thing you can do is
you can try to reduce your use

00:31:35.216 --> 00:31:37.036 A:middle
of C++ virtual functions.

00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:39.926 A:middle
So virtual functions create
what we call V tables,

00:31:40.296 --> 00:31:44.346 A:middle
which are the same as ObjC
metadata in that in the sense

00:31:44.406 --> 00:31:46.966 A:middle
that they create structures
in the DATA section

00:31:46.966 --> 00:31:47.906 A:middle
that have to be fixed up.

00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:51.786 A:middle
They're smaller than
ObjC, they're smaller

00:31:51.786 --> 00:31:53.976 A:middle
than ObjC metadata but
they're still significant

00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:55.056 A:middle
for some applications.

00:31:56.766 --> 00:31:58.286 A:middle
You can use Swift structs.

00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:01.506 A:middle
So Swift tends to use less
data that has pointers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:01.506 A:middle
So Swift tends to use less
data that has pointers

00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:02.536 A:middle
for fix-ups of this sort.

00:32:03.676 --> 00:32:09.416 A:middle
And, Swift is more inlinable and
can better co-gen to avoid a lot

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:13.846 A:middle
of that, so migrating to Swift
is a great way to improve this.

00:32:14.856 --> 00:32:17.076 A:middle
And one other thing,
you should be careful

00:32:17.076 --> 00:32:20.536 A:middle
about machine generated codes,
so we have instances where,

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:25.776 A:middle
you may describe some
structures in terms of a DSL

00:32:25.776 --> 00:32:28.296 A:middle
or some custom language
and then have a program

00:32:28.296 --> 00:32:30.576 A:middle
that generates other
code from it.

00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:33.516 A:middle
And if those generated programs
have a lot of pointers in them,

00:32:33.826 --> 00:32:34.996 A:middle
they can become very expensive

00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:37.046 A:middle
because when you generate your
code you can generate very,

00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:37.746 A:middle
very large structures.

00:32:37.746 --> 00:32:40.456 A:middle
We've seen cases where,
this causes megabytes

00:32:40.456 --> 00:32:41.726 A:middle
and megabytes of data.

00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:44.616 A:middle
But the upside is you
usually have a lot of control

00:32:44.616 --> 00:32:46.316 A:middle
because you can just
change the code generator

00:32:46.316 --> 00:32:47.456 A:middle
to use something
that's not pointers,

00:32:47.456 --> 00:32:50.156 A:middle
for instance offset
based, structures.

00:32:50.746 --> 00:32:52.016 A:middle
And that will be a big win.

00:32:52.096 --> 00:32:54.966 A:middle
So in this case, let's look
at what's going on here

00:32:54.966 --> 00:32:56.456 A:middle
with my, with my load time.

00:32:57.806 --> 00:33:01.396 A:middle
And I have at least 10,000
classes, I actually have 20,000,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.806 --> 00:33:01.396 A:middle
And I have at least 10,000
classes, I actually have 20,000,

00:33:01.636 --> 00:33:02.806 A:middle
so many it scrolled
off the slide.

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:06.256 A:middle
And if I cut it down
to 1,000 classes,

00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:09.966 A:middle
I just cut my launch times, my
time in this part of the launch

00:33:09.966 --> 00:33:12.036 A:middle
from 350 to 20 milliseconds.

00:33:13.796 --> 00:33:20.566 A:middle
So, now, everything but the
initializer is actually below

00:33:20.566 --> 00:33:24.976 A:middle
that 400 millisecond mark,
so we're doing pretty good.

00:33:25.516 --> 00:33:29.026 A:middle
So for ObjC set up, well Nick
mentioned everything it had

00:33:29.026 --> 00:33:29.436 A:middle
to do.

00:33:29.436 --> 00:33:33.576 A:middle
It had to do class
registration, it has to deal

00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:36.416 A:middle
with the non-fragile ivars, it
has to do category registration

00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:37.676 A:middle
and it has to do
selector uniquing.

00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:40.166 A:middle
And I'm not going to spend
much time on this one at all,

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:44.796 A:middle
and the reason I'm not is, we
solved all of those by fixing

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:48.056 A:middle
up the rebasing and
data, and binding before.

00:33:48.516 --> 00:33:49.886 A:middle
All the reductions
there are going

00:33:49.886 --> 00:33:51.136 A:middle
to be the same thing
you want to do here.

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.826 A:middle
So we just get a little bit of
a free win here, it's small.

00:33:53.826 --> 00:33:54.726 A:middle
It's 8 milliseconds.

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.986 A:middle
But we didn't do
anything explicit for it.

00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
And now finally, we're going
to look at my initializers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
And now finally, we're going
to look at my initializers

00:34:03.026 --> 00:34:04.596 A:middle
which are the big
10 seconds here.

00:34:05.766 --> 00:34:08.206 A:middle
So I'm going to go a little more
in depth on this than Nick did.

00:34:08.636 --> 00:34:10.906 A:middle
There are two types
of initializers,

00:34:11.585 --> 00:34:14.766 A:middle
explicit initializers,
things like +load.

00:34:14.766 --> 00:34:17.356 A:middle
As Nick said we recommend
replacing that with +initialize,

00:34:17.696 --> 00:34:21.606 A:middle
which will cause the ObjC run
time to initialize your code

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:24.186 A:middle
when the classes were
substantiated instead

00:34:24.186 --> 00:34:27.536 A:middle
of when the file is loaded.

00:34:28.005 --> 00:34:31.216 A:middle
Or, in C/C++ there's an
attribute that can be put

00:34:31.216 --> 00:34:35.646 A:middle
onto functions which will
cause it to, generate those

00:34:35.646 --> 00:34:38.356 A:middle
as initializers, so that's
an explicit initializer,

00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:41.016 A:middle
that we just rather
you didn't use.

00:34:41.016 --> 00:34:43.126 A:middle
We rather you replace them
with call site initializers.

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:46.966 A:middle
So by call site initializers I
mean things like dispatch once.

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:50.806 A:middle
Or if you're in cross
platform code, pthread once.

00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:54.065 A:middle
Or if you're in C++
code, std once.

00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:56.826 A:middle
All these functions have
basically the same sort

00:34:56.826 --> 00:34:59.226 A:middle
of functionality
where, any code in one

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
of these blocks will be
executed the first time its hit


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
of these blocks will be
executed the first time its hit

00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:01.626 A:middle
and only that.

00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:04.346 A:middle
Dispatch once is very, very
optimized in our system.

00:35:04.596 --> 00:35:07.146 A:middle
After the first execution of
it, it's basically equivalent

00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:10.526 A:middle
to a no op running past it, so
I highly recommend that instead

00:35:10.526 --> 00:35:12.876 A:middle
of using, explicit initializers.

00:35:14.106 --> 00:35:15.836 A:middle
So let's move on to
implicit initializers.

00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:18.616 A:middle
So inplicit initializers are
what Nick described mostly

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:21.686 A:middle
from C++ globals with
non-trivial initializers,

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.446 A:middle
with non-trivial constructors.

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:27.066 A:middle
And one option is
you can replace those

00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:30.106 A:middle
with call site initializers
like we just mentioned.

00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:32.876 A:middle
There's certainly places
where you can place globals

00:35:32.876 --> 00:35:36.606 A:middle
with non-global structures
or pointers to objects

00:35:36.606 --> 00:35:37.456 A:middle
that you will initialize.

00:35:39.156 --> 00:35:43.556 A:middle
Another option is that you don't
have non-trivial initializers.

00:35:43.556 --> 00:35:46.666 A:middle
So in C++ there's initializers
called a POD a plain old data.

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:51.066 A:middle
And if you're objects are just
plain old datas, the static,

00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:54.746 A:middle
or the static linker will
pre-calculate all the data

00:35:54.746 --> 00:35:56.956 A:middle
for the DATA section, lay it
out as just data seen there,

00:35:56.956 --> 00:35:58.886 A:middle
it doesn't have to be run, it
doesn't have to be fixed up.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:06.176 A:middle
Finally, it can be
really hard to find these,

00:36:06.896 --> 00:36:08.986 A:middle
because they're implicit,
but we have a warning

00:36:08.986 --> 00:36:11.346 A:middle
in the compiler
-Wglobal-constructors

00:36:11.346 --> 00:36:12.866 A:middle
and if you do that it will give
you warnings whenever you're

00:36:12.866 --> 00:36:13.606 A:middle
generating one of these.

00:36:13.606 --> 00:36:16.686 A:middle
So it's good to add that to
the flags your compiler uses.

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:20.606 A:middle
Another option is just
to rewrite them in Swift.

00:36:21.376 --> 00:36:25.276 A:middle
And the reason is, Swift
has global variables

00:36:25.276 --> 00:36:26.526 A:middle
and they'll be initialized,
they're guaranteed

00:36:26.526 --> 00:36:27.886 A:middle
to be initialized
before you use them.

00:36:27.966 --> 00:36:29.606 A:middle
But the way it does it, instead,

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:32.436 A:middle
is instead of using
an initializer, it,

00:36:32.436 --> 00:36:34.376 A:middle
behind the scenes, uses
dispatch once for you.

00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:35.966 A:middle
It uses one of those
call site initializers.

00:36:36.606 --> 00:36:39.406 A:middle
So moving to Swift will
take care of this for you,

00:36:39.696 --> 00:36:41.346 A:middle
so I highly encourage
it that's an option.

00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:46.146 A:middle
Finally, in your initializers
please don't call dlopen,

00:36:46.146 --> 00:36:49.166 A:middle
that will be a big performance
hit for a bunch of reasons.

00:36:49.796 --> 00:36:53.346 A:middle
When dyld's running it's
before the app has started and,

00:36:53.866 --> 00:36:55.836 A:middle
we can do things like
turn off our locking,

00:36:55.836 --> 00:36:56.736 A:middle
because we're single threaded.

00:36:57.176 --> 00:37:01.116 A:middle
As soon as dlopens
happened, in those situations,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:57.176 --> 00:37:01.116 A:middle
As soon as dlopens
happened, in those situations,

00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:03.046 A:middle
the graph of how our
initializers have

00:37:03.046 --> 00:37:04.716 A:middle
to run changes, we could
have multiple threads,

00:37:04.716 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
we have to turn on
locking, it's just going

00:37:05.966 --> 00:37:07.276 A:middle
to be a big performance mess.

00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:09.756 A:middle
You also can have
subtle deadlocking

00:37:09.756 --> 00:37:11.046 A:middle
and undefined behaviors.

00:37:12.416 --> 00:37:16.326 A:middle
Also, please don't start
threads in your initializers,

00:37:17.056 --> 00:37:18.186 A:middle
basically for the same reason.

00:37:18.506 --> 00:37:20.006 A:middle
You can set up a mute
text if you have to

00:37:20.006 --> 00:37:22.696 A:middle
and mute text even have like,
preferred mute texts even have,

00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:25.056 A:middle
predefined static values
that you can set them

00:37:25.056 --> 00:37:26.116 A:middle
up with that run no code.

00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:28.946 A:middle
But actually starting a
thread in your initializer is,

00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:32.616 A:middle
potentially a big performance
and correctness issue.

00:37:32.816 --> 00:37:35.286 A:middle
So here we have some
code, I have a C++ class

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.466 A:middle
with a non-trivial initializer.

00:37:36.766 --> 00:37:38.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm having trouble
with the connection.

00:37:38.776 --> 00:37:41.046 A:middle
Please try again in a moment.

00:37:41.336 --> 00:37:42.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Siri.

00:37:42.966 --> 00:37:46.506 A:middle
I'm having a, I have a
non-trivial initializer.

00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:52.576 A:middle
And I guess I had it in for
debugging all commented out

00:37:52.576 --> 00:37:56.176 A:middle
and okay, I'm down to
50 milliseconds, total.

00:37:56.176 --> 00:37:59.946 A:middle
I have plenty of time
to initialize my nibs

00:37:59.946 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
and do everything else,
we're in very good shape.

00:37:59.946 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
and do everything else,
we're in very good shape.

00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:04.526 A:middle
So now that we've
gone through that,

00:38:06.666 --> 00:38:11.006 A:middle
let's talk about what we
should know if you just,

00:38:11.276 --> 00:38:12.976 A:middle
this was really long
and pretty dense.

00:38:13.466 --> 00:38:15.846 A:middle
The first one is please
use dyld print statistics

00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:16.976 A:middle
to measure your times, add it

00:38:16.976 --> 00:38:18.786 A:middle
to your performance
or aggression suites.

00:38:19.146 --> 00:38:22.536 A:middle
So you can track how your
app is performing over time,

00:38:22.536 --> 00:38:24.306 A:middle
so as you're actively doing
something you don't find it

00:38:24.306 --> 00:38:28.436 A:middle
months later and have
trouble debugging it.

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:33.336 A:middle
You can improve your app launch
time by, reducing the number

00:38:33.336 --> 00:38:38.276 A:middle
of dylibs you have, reducing the
amount of ObjC classes you have,

00:38:38.606 --> 00:38:40.656 A:middle
and eliminating your
static initializers.

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:46.036 A:middle
And you can improve in
general by using more Swift

00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:47.576 A:middle
because it just does
the right things.

00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:50.856 A:middle
Finally, dlopen usage
is discouraged,

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.866 A:middle
it causes subtle
performance issues

00:38:52.866 --> 00:38:54.186 A:middle
that are hard to diagnose.

00:38:54.886 --> 00:38:57.626 A:middle
For more information you can
see the URL up on screen.

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:01.486 A:middle
There are several related
sessions later in the week

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:01.486 A:middle
There are several related
sessions later in the week

00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:05.306 A:middle
and again, there's the app
performance session from 2012

00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:07.386 A:middle
that goes into the other
parts of app launch,

00:39:07.526 --> 00:39:09.226 A:middle
that highly recommend you
watch, if you're interested.

00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:11.686 A:middle
Thank you for coming
everybody, have a great week.
