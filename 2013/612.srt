[ Silence ]

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome
to the advanced editing

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:13.986 A:middle
with AV foundation session.

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:17.116 A:middle
My name's Scott Johnston
on the AV Foundation Team.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:25.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:27.626 A:middle
So today we have two
main topics for you.

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:32.066 A:middle
Introducing custom video
compositing, and secondly,

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:34.226 A:middle
a really useful debugging
technique

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:35.846 A:middle
for debugging compositions.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.766 A:middle
So let's start with
custom video compositing.

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.036 A:middle
First of all, we're going
to take a few moments just

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:46.026 A:middle
to review the existing AV
Foundation Architecture.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
AV Foundation has been
available for a few years now.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.746 A:middle
Ever since iOS 4 and Lion.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.926 A:middle
It's used in a wide variety
of video editing applications

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.926 A:middle
It's used in a wide variety
of video editing applications

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:04.366 A:middle
in the app store
including those from Apple.

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:08.116 A:middle
It provides core and
key fundamental tools

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.526 A:middle
to create cuts only
temporal compositions,

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:15.276 A:middle
video mixing compositions,
and of course audio mixing.

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:24.136 A:middle
In Mountain Lion and iOS
6, it's quite possible

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:28.066 A:middle
to create a wide variety
of visual effects.

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:35.176 A:middle
Dissolves, scaling,
transformation effects,

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:43.636 A:middle
layering, picture in picture
effects, wipes, and slides.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:54.906 A:middle
And now, new for
Mavericks and iOS 7,

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.276 A:middle
we'd like to give you
guys the opportunity

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:00.386 A:middle
to place your code inside
the video composition

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:00.386 A:middle
to place your code inside
the video composition

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:01.206 A:middle
render pipeline.

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:10.686 A:middle
So giving you direct access
to the pixels with the CPU

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:17.746 A:middle
and the GPU to colorize,
warp, texture map.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.836 A:middle
Achieve a much wider
variety of complex effects.

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:29.756 A:middle
And we'll see more of the
sea otters later [laughter].

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.396 A:middle
So custom video compositor.

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:35.356 A:middle
But what is a video compositor?

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.626 A:middle
Well, it's basically a
chunk of video mixing code.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:44.756 A:middle
Which takes zero or more
source frames blending

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:50.186 A:middle
or modifying the pixels to
deliver a single output frame.

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:54.876 A:middle
We'll find the existing
built-in compositor inside the

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:55.986 A:middle
composition architecture.

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:01.566 A:middle
So looking inside
compositions as a whole,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:01.566 A:middle
So looking inside
compositions as a whole,

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:04.176 A:middle
we first see the AVComposition,

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:07.306 A:middle
which is our temporal
cuts-only edit.

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:14.956 A:middle
We place time ranges of
source assets in tracks.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:17.466 A:middle
Here we have two
tracks, A and B,

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:21.986 A:middle
and in this example we're going
to be dissolving from track A

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:23.866 A:middle
to B and back to A again.

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:27.826 A:middle
In order to achieve
the dissolve,

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:32.786 A:middle
we have the AVVideoComposition,

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:38.296 A:middle
which stores the video mixing
parameters and time ranges.

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:48.466 A:middle
So let's take a closer look at
the video composition itself.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:51.876 A:middle
Now for these time ranges
in the video composition,

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:53.536 A:middle
they're instruction objects,

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:56.736 A:middle
which store the mixing
parameters.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:02.976 A:middle
But some instructions
are simpler than others.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.906 A:middle
For example, one source track.

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:07.856 A:middle
Another can take more than one.

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:16.125 A:middle
And looking at the first
simple segment there,

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.206 A:middle
that first instruction.

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
It's effectively just passing
through frames from track A

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:27.276 A:middle
through the compositor
rendering the first segment.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.046 A:middle
Now the more interesting
segment is

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.916 A:middle
where the initial
dissolve happens,

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:35.096 A:middle
where we take two frames,
and using the parameters

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:37.936 A:middle
from the instruction to tell
the compositor to blend them.

00:04:38.886 --> 00:04:44.986 A:middle
And with them, we render
the rest of the edit.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:46.466 A:middle
Focusing even more
on the compositor,

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:53.146 A:middle
we have multiple source
frames and a single frame out.

00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:57.846 A:middle
Along with the source frames,
we have the instruction object

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.196 A:middle
with the mixing parameters.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:04.326 A:middle
In this case, a dissolve
which we encode

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:04.326 A:middle
In this case, a dissolve
which we encode

00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:05.966 A:middle
as a property in
the instruction.

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:09.716 A:middle
In this case, in ramp
from one down to zero.

00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:15.686 A:middle
At this point, we're
at the compositor,

00:05:15.686 --> 00:05:18.396 A:middle
so let's introduce the new
custom compositing API.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:25.326 A:middle
The built-in compositor is
green, you can now replace that

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:30.546 A:middle
and do your own stuff
in Mavericks and iOS 7.

00:05:32.476 --> 00:05:36.096 A:middle
In addition, you can implement
your own instruction to gather

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:39.396 A:middle
up and carry your own
set of mixing parameters.

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
It's bundled up with the source
frames in the request object.

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:52.596 A:middle
So you'll be implementing the
new protocol AVVideoCompositing,

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:56.836 A:middle
which receives the new object,

00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:00.306 A:middle
AVAsynchronousVideoComposition
request.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:00.306 A:middle
AVAsynchronousVideoComposition
request.

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:06.846 A:middle
And, in addition, you'll
be implementing the

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:09.966 A:middle
AVVideoCompositionInstruction.

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:16.546 A:middle
Now looking at the
methods involved here,

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:19.196 A:middle
you'll be receiving your request

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:21.756 A:middle
when you implement
startVideo CompositionRequest.

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:26.006 A:middle
And then deliver the
frame once you've rendered

00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:28.396 A:middle
with finishWith
ComposedVideoFrame.

00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:32.986 A:middle
Now in the event of an error,
you can call finishWithError

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:35.666 A:middle
or acknowledge a
cancelled request.

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:44.066 A:middle
Okay, so what about the
format of the source frames?

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.886 A:middle
How are the pixels arranged?

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:50.276 A:middle
Well you've probably
looked in our header files

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:52.136 A:middle
and seen a wide variety
of formats.

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:57.406 A:middle
You'll probably only see a
small subset here, but generally

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
when we're decoding H.264 video,
you'll receive YUV 8-bit 420.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
when we're decoding H.264 video,
you'll receive YUV 8-bit 420.

00:07:10.026 --> 00:07:13.596 A:middle
But that could vary and
your code may not be able

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:14.716 A:middle
to render into YUV.

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:17.176 A:middle
So you can express the exact
format that you require

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:20.086 A:middle
by implementing source
pixel buffer attributes.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:25.806 A:middle
Now here you can provide
an array of formats

00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:27.416 A:middle
that you would like to receive.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:33.196 A:middle
In this case, our example
requires 32-bit BGRA,

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:37.216 A:middle
and by doing so the
system will, on the fly,

00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:45.396 A:middle
convert the source
frames into that format.

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:47.986 A:middle
Similarly for the
output pixel format,

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:50.996 A:middle
you implement
requiredPixelBuffer

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:52.426 A:middle
AttributesForRenderContext.

00:07:55.386 --> 00:08:05.276 A:middle
And we're requiring
32-bit BGRA here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:55.386 --> 00:08:05.276 A:middle
And we're requiring
32-bit BGRA here.

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.956 A:middle
Now in order to get hold of a
new empty frame to render into,

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:10.956 A:middle
we go back to the
request object,

00:08:11.806 --> 00:08:16.166 A:middle
ask it for the render context,
which contains information

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:20.186 A:middle
about the aspect ratio and the
size that we're rendering to,

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:25.696 A:middle
and also the required
pixel format.

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
So we ask it for a
new pixel buffer.

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:29.316 A:middle
Now this comes from
a managed pool.

00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:39.346 A:middle
So the frame is allocated, we
can then render in to their,

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:43.275 A:middle
in this case our dissolve and
send the output on its way.

00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:49.156 A:middle
Now let's jump into Xcode
and we'll have a demo.

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:54.186 A:middle
Okay, so, in Xcode, here we are
with the Hello World equivalent

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:56.006 A:middle
of a custom compositor.

00:08:56.746 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
So, here we're implementing
our AVVideoCompositing protocol

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:56.746 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
So, here we're implementing
our AVVideoCompositing protocol

00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:08.616 A:middle
and those three methods that
we called out in the slides.

00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:14.866 A:middle
So again, we're requiring
BGRA and it's simply a case

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:16.516 A:middle
of putting in that value.

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:20.866 A:middle
Now remember it's an array, so
we can, if we do support YUV

00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:26.066 A:middle
in some flavor, we
can drop it in there.

00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:29.146 A:middle
Similarly for the output,
in this case it's identical.

00:09:29.766 --> 00:09:36.656 A:middle
Now the action happens
inside the rendering function

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:41.546 A:middle
startVideo CompositionRequest
receiving our request object.

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:43.566 A:middle
Let's open this guy.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:49.996 A:middle
Okay, so, the first
thing we do here is -

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:52.736 A:middle
it's slightly hard coded
just for simplicity -

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:56.826 A:middle
but we fish out the
source frames

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:59.726 A:middle
from the passed in
request object.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:03.056 A:middle
Now you'll get these as
Core Video pixel buffers,

00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:07.936 A:middle
and we'll try our hardest

00:10:07.936 --> 00:10:09.736 A:middle
to make sure they're
IOSurface backed,

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:11.966 A:middle
so they're going
to be on the GPU.

00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:16.966 A:middle
The next thing we do
is we allocate a fresh,

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:20.526 A:middle
new pixel buffer to render into
so, as we saw in the slides,

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:23.216 A:middle
we ask the request object
for the render context

00:10:24.476 --> 00:10:25.756 A:middle
and allocate a new pixel buffer.

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:31.406 A:middle
Then we do the rendering and
deliver the output frame.

00:10:31.726 --> 00:10:35.366 A:middle
So before we look at what's
inside that little render block,

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:39.436 A:middle
let's run up and
see what this does.

00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:43.256 A:middle
Okay here we are
with a deer again.

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:46.866 A:middle
Okay so this app, a simple
app, and it's really simple

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:50.766 A:middle
because we've managed to use
the new AVPlayerView from AVKit,

00:10:51.546 --> 00:10:55.116 A:middle
which gives you a nice, simple
player view with a scrubber

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:57.226 A:middle
and various other goodies.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:11:00.816 A:middle
So let's play and
we'll see what happens.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.946 --> 00:11:00.816 A:middle
So let's play and
we'll see what happens.

00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:03.596 A:middle
Okay so we've got a
really simple wipe,

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.246 A:middle
with that white line
coming down.

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:08.186 A:middle
Let's play it again
if you missed it.

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:11.526 A:middle
Okay so there's nothing
particularly exciting,

00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:17.456 A:middle
but the main thing is this will
illustrate how we can get hold

00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:20.876 A:middle
of those pixels, in
this case which is CPU,

00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:25.276 A:middle
so the pixel buffers you can
lock to the base address.

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:33.056 A:middle
At which point, you can then
ask for the usual things

00:11:33.056 --> 00:11:36.636 A:middle
like the bytes-per-row
and the base address,

00:11:36.636 --> 00:11:39.846 A:middle
and at which point we can then
start splatting the pixels.

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:43.286 A:middle
Now, you'll see this rather ugly
- and don't do this at home -

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.736 A:middle
memcpy and memset stuff.

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:52.676 A:middle
Just purely for simplicity
here, but I'll close that.

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:56.616 A:middle
Now, up here, when we
play that transition,

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:59.606 A:middle
obviously we're doing some
sort of animation and on

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:02.576 A:middle
to calculate the vertical
position of the white band.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:02.576 A:middle
to calculate the vertical
position of the white band.

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:08.056 A:middle
We have to basically interpolate
across our time range to work

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:12.206 A:middle
out exactly at what
point we are,

00:12:12.206 --> 00:12:14.366 A:middle
we use a thing called
tweening here,

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:16.976 A:middle
we calculate this tween factor.

00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:20.496 A:middle
Now we're going to come back to
this in the slides in a moment,

00:12:20.926 --> 00:12:23.656 A:middle
but basically there's some basic
arithmetic going on in here

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:28.726 A:middle
and it's all to do with
the time range associated

00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:32.166 A:middle
with the current video
composition instruction.

00:12:32.616 --> 00:12:34.256 A:middle
We'll come back to
that in a sec.

00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:37.266 A:middle
But this isn't a
particularly exciting example

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.506 A:middle
of a compositor, so
let's have a look

00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:41.416 A:middle
at something using
the GPU, using OpenGL.

00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:43.566 A:middle
So let's run this guy again.

00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:49.066 A:middle
And this time we're going
to change the composition,

00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:51.586 A:middle
and I've got some pre-prepared
ones fortunately, so,

00:12:52.736 --> 00:12:56.126 A:middle
let's switch to this guy.

00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:58.516 A:middle
Okay, so, let's play
it this time.

00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
Coming in quite fast, and
there's our otters again.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
Coming in quite fast, and
there's our otters again.

00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:03.646 A:middle
I'll play that again.

00:13:04.386 --> 00:13:08.196 A:middle
It goes through quite quickly,
but we can do something

00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:13.896 A:middle
about that, we can change the
[pause] video mixing parameters

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:16.216 A:middle
that we've placed
in our composition,

00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:24.416 A:middle
and I can reveal some controls
wired directly to properties

00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:26.996 A:middle
in our instruction, in our
custom instruction here.

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:30.336 A:middle
In this case, stiffening
and damping.

00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:35.826 A:middle
Now these are going to influence
the way we're calculating

00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:36.446 A:middle
the physics.

00:13:36.646 --> 00:13:37.846 A:middle
In this case we're mapping,

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:41.036 A:middle
texture mapping the
video onto a mash.

00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:46.926 A:middle
And then applying some
physics to the vertices.

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:49.306 A:middle
So let's see if we can slow
this down a little bit, so,

00:13:49.766 --> 00:13:54.216 A:middle
[pause] let's play
that through again.

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:56.336 A:middle
Okay, it's a little
bit different.

00:13:56.856 --> 00:14:02.716 A:middle
You can see the, as it comes in,
it's a strange, hypnotic effect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.856 --> 00:14:02.716 A:middle
You can see the, as it comes in,
it's a strange, hypnotic effect.

00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:06.866 A:middle
But this we can play
with it even more

00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:09.206 A:middle
by playing with the damping.

00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:13.176 A:middle
Woops. Okay.

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:29.356 A:middle
Of course that was all planned.

00:14:32.196 --> 00:14:34.386 A:middle
Okay so, we've set up
the stiffness and damping

00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:37.156 A:middle
to be a little bit
wilder this time.

00:14:38.316 --> 00:14:44.416 A:middle
Yeah. [Pause] Okay, so
anyway, that's an example

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.556 A:middle
of the OpenGL doing
something useful.

00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:52.566 A:middle
Let's switch back to the slides.

00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:55.426 A:middle
Okay we mentioned
tweening there,

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:56.546 A:middle
which is an interpolation.

00:14:56.546 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So let's have a quick
overview of that

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:56.546 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So let's have a quick
overview of that

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
in case you're not familiar
with how that works.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.946 A:middle
Now we'll focus in on
the second segment,

00:15:06.946 --> 00:15:09.586 A:middle
which does the dissolve
in this example.

00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:22.426 A:middle
Okay our instruction
contains our opacity ramp

00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:25.186 A:middle
from 100 percent
down to 0 percent.

00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:30.306 A:middle
Of course the interesting
properties in there,

00:15:30.306 --> 00:15:33.386 A:middle
as well as the opacity
ramp is the time range

00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:36.286 A:middle
and our first example
is arbitrarily starting

00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
at 5 seconds with a duration
of ten-thirtieths of a second.

00:15:41.946 --> 00:15:47.106 A:middle
Now in the first frame we've
only elapsed a few seconds in.

00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:50.976 A:middle
At which point, the passed
capacity should be 100 percent.

00:15:50.976 --> 00:15:56.016 A:middle
Now we calculate
this tween factor

00:15:56.606 --> 00:16:01.586 A:middle
by dividing the elapsed
time by the duration.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.606 --> 00:16:01.586 A:middle
by dividing the elapsed
time by the duration.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.866 A:middle
In which case we calculate
zero, which leads right

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:06.716 A:middle
to the beginning of
the opacity ramp.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.876 A:middle
Now things get a
bit more interesting

00:16:08.876 --> 00:16:10.536 A:middle
when we move forward one frame.

00:16:11.626 --> 00:16:13.486 A:middle
We've elapsed one-thirtieth
of a second in.

00:16:14.886 --> 00:16:19.126 A:middle
The tween factor is now
calculated to be 0.1,

00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:23.386 A:middle
which means we're a tenth of the
way through the opacity ramp.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:28.206 A:middle
By multiplying the opacity
by the tween factor,

00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:32.426 A:middle
we can then arrive at the
desired opacity for this kind

00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:34.186 A:middle
of point in time
with 90 percent.

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:38.716 A:middle
We do the same calculation

00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:41.626 A:middle
for each frame all the
way through to the end.

00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:44.786 A:middle
Arriving with a tween
factor of 1,

00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:47.666 A:middle
which means we'll get the
exact destination opacity

00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:49.276 A:middle
of 0 percent.

00:16:56.336 --> 00:16:59.836 A:middle
Okay, so there's some
performance considerations.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.426 --> 00:17:07.996 A:middle
[Pause] But before we get to the
performance, there's a caveat.

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:13.656 A:middle
When your app on
iOS is backgrounded,

00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:15.906 A:middle
OpenGL won't be available.

00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:19.016 A:middle
So you'll have to
have a CPU equivalent.

00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:29.976 A:middle
Of course you can use the
CPU in foreground too.

00:17:30.856 --> 00:17:34.436 A:middle
So, the three booleans inside
the new composition instruction.

00:17:34.966 --> 00:17:37.886 A:middle
It's important to look at these

00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:44.416 A:middle
because there are
performance wins to be had.

00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:46.326 A:middle
First up, passthroughTrackID.

00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:52.356 A:middle
So some segments are, sorry,

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:56.316 A:middle
some instructions are
simpler than others.

00:17:57.636 --> 00:18:01.336 A:middle
Some just take one source and
don't modify the frame at all,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.636 --> 00:18:01.336 A:middle
Some just take one source and
don't modify the frame at all,

00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:03.796 A:middle
they simply pass through
frames from track A.

00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:08.376 A:middle
In this example, this gets
you to the first segment.

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:11.646 A:middle
Simply passing through
frames on track A.

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:14.776 A:middle
[Pause] If we're not modifying
the frame, then we might

00:18:14.776 --> 00:18:16.686 A:middle
as well bypass the
compositor completely.

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:21.056 A:middle
Now this is a power win.

00:18:27.626 --> 00:18:30.276 A:middle
Next up is
requiredSourceTrackIDs.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:35.006 A:middle
So let's say that first
instruction is actually

00:18:35.006 --> 00:18:38.816 A:middle
modifying those single
source frames coming through.

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:41.666 A:middle
This say it's doing some
colorization effect.

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:45.896 A:middle
In which case we do
require frames from track A

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.696 A:middle
and we do want the
compositor to be called.

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:50.376 A:middle
So we set required
source track IDs

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:53.736 A:middle
to be track A, that
single track.

00:18:54.266 --> 00:19:00.246 A:middle
Now what we don't want
to do is just leave it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:54.266 --> 00:19:00.246 A:middle
Now what we don't want
to do is just leave it

00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:03.666 A:middle
to be the default value of
nil, because that's equivalent,

00:19:04.126 --> 00:19:06.696 A:middle
that says, deliver me
frames from all the tracks,

00:19:06.696 --> 00:19:09.586 A:middle
and it's going to
be wasted effort.

00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:17.176 A:middle
So containsTweening.

00:19:17.896 --> 00:19:20.066 A:middle
This is about our
animation again.

00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:23.446 A:middle
Now consider this composition.

00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:28.596 A:middle
We have a moving
picture-in-picture effect.

00:19:29.156 --> 00:19:31.786 A:middle
But all the source frames
coming at us are the same.

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:36.176 A:middle
Perhaps we've time extended
the source so we got a run

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.846 A:middle
of identical frames coming
through the compositor,

00:19:38.906 --> 00:19:40.386 A:middle
but we're still doing animations

00:19:40.386 --> 00:19:42.796 A:middle
so every output frame
is going to be unique.

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:50.356 A:middle
Because of that we set,
containsTweening to be yes.

00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:53.446 A:middle
[Pause] But if we leave
containsTweening as yes,

00:19:54.876 --> 00:19:56.846 A:middle
and then we stop doing
animation for some reason,

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:58.756 A:middle
so we have a static
picture-in-picture effect.

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:03.366 A:middle
The picture-in-picture is at
the top right for every frame.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:03.366 A:middle
The picture-in-picture is at
the top right for every frame.

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:05.446 A:middle
The same source frames
every time.

00:20:06.756 --> 00:20:09.486 A:middle
We're just re-rendering
identical output.

00:20:11.236 --> 00:20:13.756 A:middle
So by being careful to
set contains to be no

00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:15.226 A:middle
when you have no animation.

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:22.566 A:middle
Then after the initial frame,
the system is at liberty

00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:28.766 A:middle
to optimize away those renders
and reuse the identical output.

00:20:33.236 --> 00:20:37.946 A:middle
And then we look at the
pixel buffer formats.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:41.736 A:middle
There's another performance
win to be had here.

00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:45.506 A:middle
I think, as I said maybe
earlier, if we can work

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.756 A:middle
in a wider variety of formats,

00:20:49.076 --> 00:20:52.356 A:middle
in particular YUV 420
then do so, because then

00:20:52.686 --> 00:20:55.826 A:middle
that will avoid, generally
avoid a conversion hit

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.366 A:middle
on this source frames coming in.

00:20:57.906 --> 00:21:05.626 A:middle
With output it's less critical
since the display, for example,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.906 --> 00:21:05.626 A:middle
With output it's less critical
since the display, for example,

00:21:05.626 --> 00:21:08.376 A:middle
can accept multiple
formats, like BGRA and YUV.

00:21:08.376 --> 00:21:11.966 A:middle
There will be no conversion.

00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:25.516 A:middle
Okay, so we have some
sample code, AVCustomEdit.

00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:30.206 A:middle
In there you'll find
some OpenGL examples.

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:43.076 A:middle
Okay, the second topic is
debugging compositions.

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:55.486 A:middle
Debugging compositions,
well, it's quite possible

00:21:55.816 --> 00:22:01.696 A:middle
to construct elaborate
and complex compositions

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:55.816 --> 00:22:01.696 A:middle
to construct elaborate
and complex compositions

00:22:01.826 --> 00:22:09.396 A:middle
with entirely legal values while
producing unexpected results.

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.276 A:middle
Sometimes that's
just a black frame.

00:22:12.636 --> 00:22:18.986 A:middle
I like to think of this a bit
like building an OpenGL scene,

00:22:19.366 --> 00:22:23.286 A:middle
but inadvertently pointing
the camera view vector

00:22:23.286 --> 00:22:24.186 A:middle
in the wrong direction.

00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:28.266 A:middle
In all these cases, again,
there's a black frame.

00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:29.786 A:middle
How do you debug that?

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:30.526 A:middle
What's the best way?

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:34.766 A:middle
Well we found internally
something really useful.

00:22:35.726 --> 00:22:39.306 A:middle
Let's just consider
the types of problems

00:22:39.846 --> 00:22:40.566 A:middle
that you may encounter[Pause].

00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:45.956 A:middle
First of all, and probably
one of the worst ones,

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:50.006 A:middle
is leaving gaps between
the segments

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:51.306 A:middle
in the video composition.

00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:55.376 A:middle
It will almost certainly
result in black frames

00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:58.106 A:middle
or just hanging onto
the last frame.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:06.256 A:middle
And then just getting that
alignment in the tracks wrong.

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:08.236 A:middle
Maybe it's a rounding
error when working

00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:11.686 A:middle
with CMTime or something.

00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:19.376 A:middle
Or misalignment between the
video composition time ranges

00:23:19.376 --> 00:23:23.196 A:middle
and the AVComposition
track segments.

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:29.416 A:middle
Or a mistake in one of the
ramps, too long for example.

00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:37.726 A:middle
Or an error in the
transformation matrix

00:23:37.726 --> 00:23:40.116 A:middle
and spinning off your layers

00:23:40.286 --> 00:23:43.836 A:middle
into the ether beyond the
boundaries of the output frame.

00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:49.436 A:middle
[Pause] As I've said we've
found something really useful

00:23:49.436 --> 00:23:53.126 A:middle
internally and that is to
visualize the composition.

00:23:53.926 --> 00:23:56.566 A:middle
Rather than looking at the
code, you look at the picture.

00:23:57.386 --> 00:24:00.406 A:middle
So let's switch back
to the demo machine.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.386 --> 00:24:00.406 A:middle
So let's switch back
to the demo machine.

00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:03.536 A:middle
I think I see that, yeah, okay.

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:07.006 A:middle
Alright so if I run,
little lagging here,

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:09.856 A:middle
hopefully it doesn't crash.

00:24:10.706 --> 00:24:16.296 A:middle
Okay, so, we're looking
at our simple wipe again.

00:24:16.946 --> 00:24:21.176 A:middle
Now let's see, this is
AVCompositionDebugView.

00:24:22.066 --> 00:24:24.056 A:middle
This is going to be sample code.

00:24:25.626 --> 00:24:26.856 A:middle
I can display it like this.

00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:34.086 A:middle
And what were looking at here,
get it big enough here, okay,

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.336 A:middle
so, what we're seeing
here in green

00:24:36.386 --> 00:24:41.956 A:middle
and dark blue are
AVComposition tracks,

00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:47.506 A:middle
and green is the video tracks,
dark blue is the audio tracks.

00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:51.576 A:middle
And remember this is
the cuts only part.

00:24:52.396 --> 00:25:00.176 A:middle
So our source media starts
here for video track 2

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:52.396 --> 00:25:00.176 A:middle
So our source media starts
here for video track 2

00:25:00.176 --> 00:25:02.396 A:middle
and there for video track 1.

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:07.026 A:middle
And then down here's
the video mixing part,

00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:10.896 A:middle
is the AVVideoComposition
containing our instructions,

00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:16.106 A:middle
in this case this
instruction's made use

00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:19.576 A:middle
of that passthroughTackID
so we can label it as such.

00:25:20.296 --> 00:25:26.006 A:middle
And then into the
custom instruction.

00:25:26.976 --> 00:25:28.726 A:middle
And then at the bottom
is the audio mix.

00:25:28.726 --> 00:25:33.476 A:middle
Now you see the yellow
volume ramp there.

00:25:33.476 --> 00:25:36.216 A:middle
So, this looks like it
could be quite useful.

00:25:36.566 --> 00:25:38.546 A:middle
So let's put it to the test.

00:25:38.546 --> 00:25:43.526 A:middle
Let's give it a composition
that's broken in some way.

00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:47.116 A:middle
So let's switch to our
pre-prepared compositions.

00:25:47.376 --> 00:25:51.826 A:middle
Alright, I wasn't going to
show you the debug viewer yet.

00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:52.716 A:middle
Let's play this guy.

00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:57.756 A:middle
It's going to dissolve
into the deer,

00:25:58.286 --> 00:25:59.886 A:middle
there's something
visually wrong there,

00:25:59.886 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
let's just play that
slowly through.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.886 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
let's just play that
slowly through.

00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:07.256 A:middle
If we dissolve away from the
boat, the deer comes through

00:26:07.256 --> 00:26:09.786 A:middle
and it jumps straight
through that is not right.

00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:11.326 A:middle
Okay, so we've got
something wrong here.

00:26:11.516 --> 00:26:14.806 A:middle
Rather look at the code,

00:26:15.046 --> 00:26:17.786 A:middle
we'll see if we can
spot it with this guy.

00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:23.096 A:middle
Okay, you can probably spot that
straight away and you can see

00:26:23.096 --> 00:26:26.576 A:middle
that for video instruction,
the dissolve,

00:26:26.576 --> 00:26:32.046 A:middle
we can see the opacity ramp
descending all the way here.

00:26:32.666 --> 00:26:37.106 A:middle
So the video instruction
starts here and ends there,

00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:40.126 A:middle
so that's supposed to be
our dissolve, which is going

00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:44.056 A:middle
to take two source video tracks.

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:50.126 A:middle
One, that starts here, it
does last for the duration,

00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:54.306 A:middle
but this guy is too short.

00:26:55.996 --> 00:26:56.086 A:middle
[Pause] So.

00:26:56.336 --> 00:27:03.376 A:middle
And I just happen to know
where that problem is.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.336 --> 00:27:03.376 A:middle
And I just happen to know
where that problem is.

00:27:03.376 --> 00:27:08.866 A:middle
And your bugs won't
be this easy.

00:27:08.866 --> 00:27:15.956 A:middle
I tried to obfuscate
that, but [laughing].

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:16.516 A:middle
[Pause] Okay.

00:27:17.706 --> 00:27:21.316 A:middle
Switch to the, hopefully
now fixed, composition.

00:27:21.926 --> 00:27:26.846 A:middle
And there we see the
first video track.

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:27.646 A:middle
It looks good.

00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:30.046 A:middle
Now we get the dissolve.

00:27:30.686 --> 00:27:36.176 A:middle
Awesome. But there are worse
ways for the composition

00:27:36.176 --> 00:27:38.026 A:middle
to be broken than that.

00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:40.716 A:middle
In fact, let me just
run that again.

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:45.426 A:middle
Okay so let's have
a look at the,

00:27:46.256 --> 00:27:47.576 A:middle
the gap in the video
instruction.

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:51.716 A:middle
Black. Not good.

00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:54.496 A:middle
We'll have a look there.

00:27:55.186 --> 00:27:58.636 A:middle
And here, now, we can spot
this guy straight away.

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:03.666 A:middle
Down here we have a gap between
the dissolve instructions

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:03.666 A:middle
Down here we have a gap between
the dissolve instructions

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:07.726 A:middle
and the last instruction,
which isn't good.

00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:12.206 A:middle
So, that should be nice and easy
to fix just like the last one.

00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:14.436 A:middle
Now this guy here.

00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:16.789 A:middle
[Laughing]

00:28:17.142 --> 00:28:19.142 A:middle
[ Silence ]

00:28:19.496 --> 00:28:26.336 A:middle
Now the sea otters.

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:32.516 A:middle
[ Silence ]

00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:37.606 A:middle
And there we go,
job done, fixed.

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:46.596 A:middle
Okay. Okay so that's
AVCompositionDebugViewer,

00:28:46.596 --> 00:28:50.106 A:middle
which is a sample for
Mavericks and iOS 7.

00:28:51.816 --> 00:28:54.036 A:middle
Now we've made it simple so
that it's particularly easy

00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:58.326 A:middle
for you guys to drop it
into your app and modify it.

00:28:58.326 --> 00:29:00.316 A:middle
Extend it to draw your
own video instructions.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.326 --> 00:29:00.316 A:middle
Extend it to draw your
own video instructions.

00:29:01.066 --> 00:29:05.296 A:middle
Now remember, it's just a
noninteractive view, okay.

00:29:05.746 --> 00:29:10.806 A:middle
Now it's going to help you
spot those overlaps and gaps

00:29:10.806 --> 00:29:12.266 A:middle
as we saw, you know,
in the tracks,

00:29:12.266 --> 00:29:13.976 A:middle
the video instructions,
and the audio.

00:29:15.026 --> 00:29:21.946 A:middle
But don't forget the validation
API that we have in there,

00:29:22.376 --> 00:29:25.966 A:middle
the AVVideoComposition
ValidationHandling protocol.

00:29:26.276 --> 00:29:30.296 A:middle
So you want to implement that
and then you'll get callbacks

00:29:30.296 --> 00:29:33.026 A:middle
to see when we encounter
something a bit untoward

00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:33.906 A:middle
in your composition.

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:44.266 A:middle
So what have you
looked at today?

00:29:44.266 --> 00:29:47.886 A:middle
Well, we've spent a few minutes
just reviewing the composition

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:51.136 A:middle
architecture, to see where
the built-in compositor fits

00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:51.366 A:middle
in [Pause].

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:58.216 A:middle
And we've discovered the
new custom compositing API

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:02.366 A:middle
with the two new protocols
and the request object.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:02.366 A:middle
with the two new protocols
and the request object.

00:30:03.076 --> 00:30:07.586 A:middle
And we've see how
important it is

00:30:07.586 --> 00:30:12.166 A:middle
to choose the source pixel
buffer formats and the output.

00:30:12.836 --> 00:30:17.336 A:middle
And we looked a little
bit at tweening

00:30:17.336 --> 00:30:20.306 A:middle
and interpolating your
video mixing parameters

00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:22.176 A:middle
across the time range
of your effect.

00:30:26.456 --> 00:30:28.356 A:middle
And we talked a bit
about performance,

00:30:28.936 --> 00:30:32.676 A:middle
so remember those three booleans
inside the instruction protocol,

00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:36.966 A:middle
have a good look at them.

00:30:37.156 --> 00:30:39.496 A:middle
And lastly, we saw
our sea otters again

00:30:39.496 --> 00:30:41.696 A:middle
in debugging compositions.

00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:45.546 A:middle
So that's
AVCompositionDebugViewer,

00:30:45.816 --> 00:30:48.976 A:middle
which is a great visualization
technique and much simpler

00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:50.766 A:middle
than looking at reams of code.

00:30:56.456 --> 00:31:00.566 A:middle
So over the next few months,
I want to see you guys drop

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:56.456 --> 00:31:00.566 A:middle
So over the next few months,
I want to see you guys drop

00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:04.236 A:middle
in some great OpenGL visuals
and I want to see them appearing

00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:06.086 A:middle
in those video editing apps.

00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:09.446 A:middle
It's going to be, we're
going to see awesome effects,

00:31:09.876 --> 00:31:12.166 A:middle
transitions, and video
generators[Pause].

00:31:12.976 --> 00:31:17.456 A:middle
So if you need some information,

00:31:17.456 --> 00:31:21.856 A:middle
then do e-mail our
evangelist, John Geleynse.

00:31:21.856 --> 00:31:28.616 A:middle
We'll have some related
sessions that you can catch

00:31:28.616 --> 00:31:31.846 A:middle
on video now at WWDC app.

00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:32.926 A:middle
Thank you very much.
