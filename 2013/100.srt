You're going to have
incredible week.

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:23.756 A:middle
This is our 24th WWDC.

for you with over 100 sessions

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:55.446 A:middle
and over 120 hands-on labs so
you can bring in your code,

so grab them, make use of
them, they're here to help.

so that developers can
follow us remotely.

I'd like to get started
this morning

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:52.436 A:middle
with the few updates
beginning with Apple retail.

00:03:53.446 --> 00:03:56.616 A:middle
Of course, our retail stores
are the best place to discover

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:58.196 A:middle
and explore our products,

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:03.306 A:middle

It's phenomenal.

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:08.976 A:middle
Our stores are filled with
our colleagues who work

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.856 A:middle
at our stores because
they're passionate

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.696 A:middle
about how Apple technology
can enrich people's lives.

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.896 A:middle
Our stores had become
integral parts

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:18.586 A:middle
of the communities
that they serve.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:23.376 A:middle
Tens of thousands of school kids
pick their local Apple Store

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:26.136 A:middle
as the destination for
their annual field trip.

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:30.536 A:middle
And millions of customers
come to our stores

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.486 A:middle
for personal training so that
they can learn to get the most

00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:34.756 A:middle
out of their Apple products.

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:39.086 A:middle
We now have 407 stores
around the world.

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:41.506 A:middle
We're operating in 14 countries.

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:46.776 A:middle
And we've recently opened this
beautiful store in Berlin.

00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:49.416 A:middle
It is really awesome.

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.876 A:middle
It's in a 100 year old building.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:57.206 A:middle
It was originally one of the
first theaters in Berlin.

00:04:57.966 --> 00:05:01.176 A:middle

by restoring the facade
and the original theater,

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:08.736 A:middle
and added some classic
Apple touches along the way.

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:13.336 A:middle
The theater is integral to
the building but separate

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:16.226 A:middle
from the store, and we'll be
hosting many events throughout

from music to films and more.

Now, we're going to
start by sharing some

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:11.896 A:middle
of the technology
under the hood.

00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.596 A:middle
As we have these cars go
through a few formations,

00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:17.556 A:middle
realize that each of them is
completely driving themselves

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:20.746 A:middle
and our app is coordinating
the entire experience

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:21.846 A:middle
over Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:25.036 A:middle
The cars can control their speed
and they steer on the track

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.746 A:middle
by doing the same computations
your brain does when you drive.

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.376 A:middle
They sense where they're
located and they react

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:32.626 A:middle
to their surroundings
all in real time.

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:37.606 A:middle
This red car, he's
our hero, Aidan.

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.546 A:middle
We designed him and
all the other cars

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:40.776 A:middle
to be incredibly smart.

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.496 A:middle
Five hundred times per
second, they're running logic

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.896 A:middle
to sense a track, their position
on it, adjusting their steering

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:48.936 A:middle
and speed and communicating
back and forth

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:50.216 A:middle
with our AI engine
on that iPhone.

through the pack,

And not just for Aiden
but for every single car.

00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:17.846 A:middle
We are using iOS devices
not just as remote controls

00:12:17.976 --> 00:12:21.386 A:middle
but as the brains behind an
immersive real world experience.

00:12:21.906 --> 00:12:24.226 A:middle
And that is what lets this
bring these cars to life.

00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:26.646 A:middle
Now let's do something
interesting here.

00:12:27.056 --> 00:12:29.196 A:middle
Brad. He's going to
tell these other cars

00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:30.296 A:middle
to try to block Aiden.

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:32.816 A:middle
And just to be clear, none
of this is choreographed.

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:35.436 A:middle
All we're doing is defining
a new objective for each car

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:36.776 A:middle
and they'd figure out the rest.

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:41.016 A:middle
Here, Aiden, he's using the
exact same logic he was using

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:43.616 A:middle
before, sensing where he is
and reacting to the other cars

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:44.606 A:middle
as he looks for an opening.

00:12:45.216 --> 00:12:46.896 A:middle
Expect now, these other guys are

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:50.746 A:middle
on a mission to try
to block him.

The Mac install base now is
incredibly strong at 72 million.

00:15:01.346 --> 00:15:04.096 A:middle
This is double what it
was just five years ago.

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:08.476 A:middle
We announced the new iMac at
the end of last year and it went

00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:11.166 A:middle
on to become the number
one desktop in the US.

00:15:12.136 --> 00:15:16.066 A:middle
And the MacBook has
continued to define the future

00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:19.516 A:middle
of the notebook and is the
number one notebook in the US.

00:15:20.716 --> 00:15:24.006 A:middle
In fact, the Mac business
has outpaced the PC business

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.646 A:middle
for several years now.

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:28.106 A:middle
And if you look at
the last five years,

00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:32.136 A:middle
the average annual growth
rate isn't even close.

00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:35.946 A:middle
And if you look at the total
growth over that period of time,

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:39.116 A:middle
the Mac is at a 100 percent

00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle

for the Mac last year and one

00:16:10.956 --> 00:16:14.196 A:middle
of those was announced
here with Mountain Lion.

our latest release of OS X.

it the best selling release

of all time.

00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:30.266 A:middle

impressive is that 35 percent

latest version of using--

talk about OS X.

00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:21.336 A:middle
Our latest release,
Mountain Lion, is the ninth

00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:25.336 A:middle
of our big cat-named releases
in just over a decade.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:29.016 A:middle
As we turn our attention
now toward the 10th,

00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:30.736 A:middle
we've hit a real issue.

00:17:31.686 --> 00:17:37.346 A:middle
We do not want to be the
first software in history

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:42.536 A:middle
to be delayed due to a
dwindling supply of cats.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:47.876 A:middle
Now, fortunately, we do have
a creative group at Apple

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:49.456 A:middle
and we can think out of the box.

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:52.926 A:middle
And so, we thought, may be
we could take this lion thing

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:53.936 A:middle
in a different direction.

In fact, we're really excited
about the future of the Mac

was really obviously to us.

inspire us here in California,

about just three

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:25.516 A:middle
of them right now
starting with Finder Tabs.

Sounds like you guys you know
how this is going to work.

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
So, you of course can
work in the Finder

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:37.716 A:middle
with multiple windows.

00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:39.146 A:middle
It's a very powerful tool.

00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:42.406 A:middle
But now you can draw all those
windows together in tabs.

00:19:42.696 --> 00:19:46.616 A:middle
And each tab can have its own
location, its own view mode.

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:47.766 A:middle
It's a really powerful tool.

00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:50.636 A:middle
You can actually drag
contents and hover across tabs.

00:19:51.076 --> 00:19:53.126 A:middle
And of course, now that we
have Tabs in the Finder,

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:56.066 A:middle
it's also a great app
to take full screen.

tagging to the Mac.

00:20:08.026 --> 00:20:10.346 A:middle
So now, when you
save a document,

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:12.906 A:middle
in addition to providing
its location

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:14.676 A:middle
and name, you can tag it.

00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:17.786 A:middle
And when you do, it will appear
right in the Finder sidebar.

00:20:17.786 --> 00:20:21.486 A:middle
And in fact, you can tag
things wherever they are,

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.906 A:middle
whether they're in iCloud
or on a local file share,

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:27.906 A:middle
and all those will be brought
together and appear in Finder.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:32.936 A:middle
And, tags are great for really
powerful search as well.

00:20:33.956 --> 00:20:35.336 A:middle
Next-- yeah.

00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:37.716 A:middle
Next, Multiple Displays.

00:20:37.926 --> 00:20:38.206 A:middle
Really, all right.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:48.426 A:middle

giving you all the free multiple

display here.

00:20:49.106 --> 00:20:50.636 A:middle
This is software.

So, with multiple
displays in the Mac,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.186 A:middle
it's always been a powerful

But now, in Mavericks,
you can get at your menus

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.956 A:middle
across multiple displays.

00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:06.686 A:middle
You can summon your DOC
across multiple displays.

00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:09.156 A:middle
And when you take a window
full screen on one display,

00:21:09.156 --> 00:21:11.156 A:middle
it doesn't mess with your
desktop on the other display.

[ Applause ]

00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:20.276 A:middle
And I really love this.

00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:23.246 A:middle
When you pan your spaces,
you can do it independently

00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:24.576 A:middle
on each of your displays.

00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:27.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:33.526 A:middle
Finally, if you have an
AirPlay-connected HDTV,

00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:37.736 A:middle
it acts as a full power
separate display as well and I'd

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:39.626 A:middle
like to show all of
these to you now.

[ Applause ]

00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:47.996 A:middle
All right, let's take our
first look here at Mavericks

00:21:47.996 --> 00:21:50.236 A:middle
and we're going to
start with the Finder.

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:54.626 A:middle
So, here's Finder environment,
I got a lot going on,

00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:56.846 A:middle
a lot of windows, a lot
of different locations.

00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:58.856 A:middle
I'm going to go up
here to the Window Menu

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
and let's merge all my windows.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
and let's merge all my windows.

00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
Just like that, they
hop into a set of tabs.

00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:07.936 A:middle
Now, of course, these tabs
at different locations,

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:10.686 A:middle
different view settings for
each to those locations.

00:22:11.346 --> 00:22:13.466 A:middle
Creating a tab is
just as you'd expect.

00:22:13.576 --> 00:22:14.486 A:middle
Just click Plus.

00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:18.056 A:middle
I can select another location
like AirDrop, may be another

00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:20.306 A:middle
for this Work File Share.

00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:21.426 A:middle
I'm going right here.

00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:25.446 A:middle
And now that I have multiple
tabs, it's a really great way

00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:27.136 A:middle
to actually work
and copy documents.

00:22:27.136 --> 00:22:29.346 A:middle
If I want to copy this field
report, I can just hover

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:34.366 A:middle
over the AirDrop tab, drop it
just like that, really nice.

00:22:35.006 --> 00:22:40.526 A:middle
And, of course, I can now
take Finder full screen.

00:22:41.636 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
Next, let's take
a look at tagging.

00:22:43.976 --> 00:22:44.906 A:middle
This is really cool.

00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:46.716 A:middle
So as I go to save a document,

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:50.136 A:middle
you know as I can give it a name
like, let's say, Project Plan.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.486 A:middle
And in addition to its
location, in this case,

00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:55.036 A:middle
I'm going to save it in
iCloud, I can also give it a tag

00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:56.326 A:middle
from any of the tags
I've made up.

00:22:56.326 --> 00:22:59.066 A:middle
So I'm going to call
this document Important.

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
Looks pretty important to me.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
Looks pretty important to me.

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:04.196 A:middle
And we'll go here into
the Finder and you see

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.676 A:middle
in the Finder sidebar,
I have an Important tag

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:08.026 A:middle
and I see all these documents.

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
They're from different
locations,

00:23:09.216 --> 00:23:12.596 A:middle
different applications, all
drawn together in sidebar.

00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:14.046 A:middle
We have other tags.

00:23:14.046 --> 00:23:16.836 A:middle
I've given things for things
that are draft and in review.

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:18.146 A:middle
Now, of course with tags,

00:23:18.226 --> 00:23:20.666 A:middle
I can assign multiple
tags to the same document.

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:21.936 A:middle
That's part of the
power of tags.

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:25.256 A:middle
So I go here and I'm going to
say this one is also in review.

00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:27.966 A:middle
And you notice, as I sign
that tag, it now appears

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:29.336 A:middle
in that location as well.

00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:33.046 A:middle
And if I want to assign a
totally new tag, I want to make

00:23:33.046 --> 00:23:35.506 A:middle
up a tag on the fly, you
can just type it right here.

00:23:35.506 --> 00:23:37.256 A:middle
This is a website
project I'm working on.

00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:39.026 A:middle
It's says Create
New Tag Website.

00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:42.106 A:middle
And just like that,
I've created a new tag

00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:44.846 A:middle
and you can see it right
here in the Finder.

00:23:45.456 --> 00:23:47.716 A:middle
I can give that tag
a color of course.

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:51.606 A:middle
And now that I have that
tag, I can also assign tags

00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:54.836 A:middle
by just dragging things in
to the Tagger and the Finder.

00:23:55.026 --> 00:23:58.526 A:middle
So different assets from my
website, just drag them in

00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:00.076 A:middle
and they're tagged like that.

and they're tagged like that.

00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
And tags are great
for searching.

00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.486 A:middle
So if I start typing,
let's say, Important,

00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:08.126 A:middle
it can find all documents
that are important.

00:24:08.216 --> 00:24:10.476 A:middle
Let's go to All My Files,
we'll find all documents,

00:24:10.476 --> 00:24:14.416 A:middle
they're both important
and that are in review.

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:18.506 A:middle
Just like that, I found exactly
what I'm looking for with tags.

00:24:19.516 --> 00:24:24.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:25.326 --> 00:24:27.476 A:middle
Next, let's take a look
at Multiple Displays.

00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:29.676 A:middle
I'm going to open up some
other kind of windows

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:31.136 A:middle
that I'm often working with.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:35.086 A:middle
We'll open iPhoto here, may
be a keynote presentation.

00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:37.426 A:middle
And I actually have a
second display connected

00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:38.446 A:middle
to this MacBook Pro.

00:24:38.446 --> 00:24:40.726 A:middle
Let's show that up
there on display now.

00:24:40.726 --> 00:24:42.576 A:middle
Of course with multiple
displays,

00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:46.456 A:middle
I can just move windows across
displays like you'd expect.

00:24:47.046 --> 00:24:50.306 A:middle
But now, I can get up at my
Menu bar in the second display.

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:51.646 A:middle
If I go down to the bottom,

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:54.136 A:middle
I can summon the
DOC just like that.

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:57.226 A:middle
If I want to open an app on the
second display, I can just open

00:24:57.226 --> 00:24:59.826 A:middle
that on the DOC here
and here is iTunes.

Take this app full
screen just like that.

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:06.876 A:middle
And as I swipe spaces,
just right back there.

00:25:06.876 --> 00:25:09.836 A:middle
Just on that display, let's take
a keynote full screen as well.

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:13.236 A:middle
I'm going to go back to
my first display here.

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:15.956 A:middle
Let's even take iPhoto
full screen.

00:25:15.956 --> 00:25:17.546 A:middle
So now, I have different
full screen apps

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:18.696 A:middle
on my different displays.

00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:20.316 A:middle
This is actually really
fantastic way to work.

00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:23.996 A:middle
Go in here into Favorite Travels
and I can now drag assets

00:25:23.996 --> 00:25:27.896 A:middle
across my full screen apps
like that, super cool.

00:25:28.266 --> 00:25:30.996 A:middle
And, Mission Control has
just been super charged

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:31.916 A:middle
for multiple displays.

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:34.586 A:middle
So, I'm going to go now
into Mission Control

00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:37.626 A:middle
and we see my different
full screen spaces

00:25:37.886 --> 00:25:40.706 A:middle
and desktops across
applications.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:43.266 A:middle
I can drag a window from
one display to another.

00:25:43.266 --> 00:25:47.156 A:middle
I can also go and drag
a full screen app right

00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:50.266 A:middle
across displays, bring
Preview open, and now I have

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:52.376 A:middle
that full screen on
this display as well.

Now, this is pretty
over the top.

So I can actually go
here into AirPlay.

00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:13.856 A:middle
I'm going to connect
to this Apple TV.

00:26:14.846 --> 00:26:18.856 A:middle
So now, it's a full

00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:21.616 A:middle
You can see I have my
Menu bar and my DOC.

00:26:22.336 --> 00:26:25.096 A:middle
I can go over here
and get my DOC here.

00:26:25.716 --> 00:26:28.806 A:middle
And, I can go into
Mission Control, even,

00:26:28.946 --> 00:26:33.046 A:middle
and I can go get a window

Next, I'd like to talk

00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:54.406 A:middle
about some advanced
technologies in Mavericks.

00:26:55.206 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
You know, our power users are
increasingly doing their work

00:26:58.476 --> 00:26:59.276 A:middle
on the go.

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
They want great responsiveness

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
They want great responsiveness

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:03.226 A:middle
but they also want
great battery life.

00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:06.626 A:middle
And in Mavericks, we've
introduced a whole host

00:27:06.626 --> 00:27:09.146 A:middle
of technologies to
address that challenge.

00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.086 A:middle
Things like Compressed Memory

00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.716 A:middle
that make sure you have
memory available very quickly

00:27:13.716 --> 00:27:14.816 A:middle
when apps demand it.

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:16.766 A:middle
Technologies like App Nap

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:19.436 A:middle
that actually makes sure
we're directing power only

00:27:19.436 --> 00:27:20.456 A:middle
to those applications

00:27:20.596 --> 00:27:22.086 A:middle
where you're really
benefiting from it.

00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:25.656 A:middle
System-wide Core Animation
Accelerated Scrolling

00:27:25.656 --> 00:27:28.936 A:middle
and OpenGL 4 for super
responsive graphics.

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:30.966 A:middle
And, a topic I want to go

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:33.966 A:middle
into in a bit more detail
now, Timer Coalescing.

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:38.446 A:middle
So you know, when you look at
battery life on your computer,

00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:41.316 A:middle
the real factor that software
has the most influence

00:27:41.316 --> 00:27:44.596 A:middle
over is CPU activity
and its draw on power.

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.736 A:middle
And if you look at what
your system is doing

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:50.466 A:middle
at any given time, what
you'll see as you look

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:53.876 A:middle
under the hood is not a smooth
line, but actually hundreds

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:56.396 A:middle
of interrupts occurring per
second where the system is going

00:27:56.396 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
from a power-efficient
sleep state up to a state

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
of high power use and back down.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
of high power use and back down.

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:05.326 A:middle
And all of those transitions
actually consume a lot of power.

00:28:05.856 --> 00:28:09.396 A:middle
Well in Mavericks, we
intelligently align all

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:12.076 A:middle
of that work, reducing those
numbers of transitions.

00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:15.506 A:middle
This, in combination with
technologies like App Nap

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:20.476 A:middle
and other power optimizations,
reduce CPU utilization activity

00:28:20.476 --> 00:28:23.666 A:middle
for these kinds of
scenarios up to 72 percent.

00:28:24.176 --> 00:28:24.976 A:middle
It's pretty awesome.

Next, let's talk about
Compressed Memory.

00:28:34.876 --> 00:28:37.256 A:middle
Nothing affects the
performance of your Mac,

00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:39.406 A:middle
the responsiveness more of
a Mac, that's under load

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:42.466 A:middle
than its ability to provide
free memory to an app.

00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:45.146 A:middle
Now, typically, when you
look at your app runtime,

00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:46.836 A:middle
all your memory is inactive.

00:28:46.836 --> 00:28:49.726 A:middle
In fact, a subset of your
memory is actively being used

00:28:50.116 --> 00:28:52.156 A:middle
and others is memory
we have to keep around

00:28:52.326 --> 00:28:53.806 A:middle
but isn't being used by the app.

00:28:54.206 --> 00:28:57.956 A:middle
Well, now if you open a
document, your system is going

00:28:57.956 --> 00:29:00.926 A:middle
to need to get free memory
and it does that in the past

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.956 --> 00:29:00.926 A:middle
to need to get free memory
and it does that in the past

00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:03.866 A:middle
by writing those inactive
bits of memory out to disk,

00:29:03.866 --> 00:29:05.106 A:middle
and that's a slow process.

00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:07.956 A:middle
Now, with Compressed Memory,

00:29:08.076 --> 00:29:11.526 A:middle
we're able to rapidly compress
the inactive memory making free

00:29:11.526 --> 00:29:13.786 A:middle
space available almost
instantaneously

00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:14.636 A:middle
to the application.

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:17.856 A:middle
This can have great
effects on responsiveness

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:18.876 A:middle
of systems under load.

00:29:19.296 --> 00:29:21.886 A:middle
You see, 1.4X kinds
of improvements,

00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:24.596 A:middle
even on fast SSD
systems for activities

00:29:24.736 --> 00:29:27.616 A:middle
like opening new documents
or reactivate an application,

00:29:27.976 --> 00:29:32.086 A:middle
and up to 1.5X improvement for
waking a system from standby,

00:29:32.886 --> 00:29:36.386 A:middle
these are just two of
many improvements to power

00:29:36.386 --> 00:29:38.106 A:middle
and performance in Mavericks.

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:40.716 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Safari.

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
In the last decade of life,
Safari is focused not just

00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:48.336 A:middle
on providing the easiest to use

00:29:48.336 --> 00:29:50.226 A:middle
and most elegant
browsing experience,

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:52.486 A:middle
but also the most innovative.

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:55.616 A:middle
These are the kinds
of innovations

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:58.236 A:middle
that Safari has brought,
private browsing,

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:00.896 A:middle
blocking of third party
cookies for privacy,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:00.896 A:middle
blocking of third party
cookies for privacy,

00:30:01.256 --> 00:30:03.656 A:middle
making the web easier to read
with features like Reading List,

00:30:03.746 --> 00:30:08.186 A:middle
and the HTML5 audio and
video tag, all Safari-firsts.

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:10.326 A:middle
And the engine in
Safari, WebKit,

00:30:10.326 --> 00:30:14.246 A:middle
is used by over 1.5
billion devices.

00:30:15.156 --> 00:30:18.456 A:middle
Well in Mountain Lion, we're
making Safari even better.

00:30:19.126 --> 00:30:22.236 A:middle
We have a great clean new
homepage with top sites.

00:30:22.596 --> 00:30:27.066 A:middle
From there, you can get at great
sidebar where you have access

00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:29.916 A:middle
to all of your bookmarks
and you can browse right

00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:30.856 A:middle
from your bookmarks.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:34.726 A:middle
And in that sidebar, we
also have Reading List

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:37.216 A:middle
where now you can
continuously scroll

00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:39.776 A:middle
through your articles moving
from article to article

00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:40.886 A:middle
without ever having to click.

00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:46.556 A:middle
And a great new feature called
Shared Links where you see all

00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:48.566 A:middle
of the links shared by
people you're following

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:49.806 A:middle
on Twitter and LinkedIn.

00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:51.196 A:middle
You can browse them right here.

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:55.966 A:middle
Now in addition to these
end-user improvements,

00:30:56.116 --> 00:30:59.776 A:middle
there's also a lot going on
under the hood, big improvements

00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:03.286 A:middle
to JavaScript, a full
process-per-tab architecture,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:03.286 A:middle
to JavaScript, a full
process-per-tab architecture,

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:05.066 A:middle
and memory efficiency
improvements

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:08.396 A:middle
with the shared memory resource
cache, and a whole bunch

00:31:08.426 --> 00:31:10.476 A:middle
of big power savings as well.

00:31:11.016 --> 00:31:11.846 A:middle
When you look at the effects

00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:13.466 A:middle
of these changes,
it's pretty profound.

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:16.906 A:middle
If you take a synthetic
benchmark like SunSpider,

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:20.276 A:middle
you see how Safari fairs
against the competition.

00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:22.576 A:middle
But, you know, researchers
have started to look

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:26.626 A:middle
at more real world JavaScript
by sampling the JavaScript

00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:27.876 A:middle
that actually occurs on sites

00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:31.226 A:middle
like the Google homepage,
Facebook, Amazon.com.

00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:33.996 A:middle
And when you look at Safari's
performance on a benchmark

00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:38.196 A:middle
like that, JSBench, the
results are really incredible.

00:31:39.516 --> 00:31:45.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:49.376 A:middle
Safari is also awesome when
it comes now to memory usage,

00:31:49.706 --> 00:31:51.856 A:middle
using way less memory
than the other browsers

00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:54.456 A:middle
which means more memory for
you to browse with more tabs

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:55.766 A:middle
and do more on your system.

00:31:56.266 --> 00:31:59.536 A:middle
And when it comes to energy
use, it's not even closed.

00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:03.026 A:middle
Safari uses way less
energy than Chrome.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:03.026 A:middle
Safari uses way less
energy than Chrome.

00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:05.986 A:middle
And when you compare to
Firefox, it's just kind of sad.

00:32:07.376 --> 00:32:08.296 A:middle
So that's Safari.

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.546 A:middle
I'd love to give
you a demo of some

00:32:10.546 --> 00:32:12.756 A:middle
of our advanced technologies
in Safari right now.

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:21.966 A:middle
So, let's start with
responsiveness

00:32:21.966 --> 00:32:24.106 A:middle
and I'm going to
go now into mail.

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:28.466 A:middle
And so here, we have a mailbox
with about 100,000 messages

00:32:28.466 --> 00:32:33.306 A:middle
in your inbox and I just want
to show you how you scroll now

00:32:33.306 --> 00:32:34.566 A:middle
with that accelerated scrolling.

00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:37.846 A:middle
Perfectly smooth,
incredibly fast,

00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.936 A:middle
almost 60 frames a
second whenever you do it,

00:32:40.936 --> 00:32:41.986 A:middle
it's just epic.

00:32:41.986 --> 00:32:44.976 A:middle
And when you look
here at scrolling

00:32:44.976 --> 00:32:47.416 A:middle
through a conversation,
this is a conversation

00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:48.936 A:middle
with 26 messages in it.

00:32:49.606 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
Again, just super glassy
smooth, super fast,

00:32:54.386 --> 00:32:55.696 A:middle
it's really, really nice.

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:57.726 A:middle
Let's take a look
at that in Safari.

00:32:58.096 --> 00:33:00.466 A:middle
In Safari, we've
improved scrolling

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.096 --> 00:33:00.466 A:middle
In Safari, we've
improved scrolling

00:33:00.506 --> 00:33:04.086 A:middle
for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:08.946 A:middle
for retina displays so now, it's
just super fast, super smooth.

00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:10.956 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at power.

00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:13.286 A:middle
Yeah, there's a fan of
smooth scrolling right there

00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:13.736 A:middle
in the front.

00:33:16.486 --> 00:33:18.296 A:middle
I'm a fan of smooth
scrolling as well.

00:33:18.616 --> 00:33:21.046 A:middle
So let's take a look at power
use, so you have a power meter

00:33:21.046 --> 00:33:23.196 A:middle
up here that's showing
CPU activity in Safari

00:33:23.196 --> 00:33:25.306 A:middle
and you notice right
now, it's quite low

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:26.726 A:middle
because we're not
doing anything.

00:33:26.936 --> 00:33:30.356 A:middle
But let's go into a website
that's going to use a lot

00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:32.626 A:middle
of power and you notice
the power meter shoot right

00:33:32.626 --> 00:33:35.646 A:middle
up because we're doing a lot of
animation here using all the CPU

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.286 A:middle
and that's OK, that's
what the CPUs for,

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:38.846 A:middle
it's doing something
cool for me right here.

00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:41.286 A:middle
But very often, you'll have
something like this happening

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:43.996 A:middle
in an add off in the corner,
you've covered this window up

00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:46.206 A:middle
and yet, it's still
draining your battery life,

00:33:46.386 --> 00:33:47.366 A:middle
you don't even realized it.

00:33:47.886 --> 00:33:51.586 A:middle
Well now, with this technology
we call AppNap, we keep track

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.116 A:middle
of what's going on and what
things you actually to see

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:55.726 A:middle
to decide where to direct power.

00:33:56.186 --> 00:33:59.886 A:middle
So watch what happens when I
bring up this iTunes window

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:02.326 A:middle
over the Safari window,
the power drops right down

00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:10.766 A:middle
and that's extending
your battery life.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:16.396 A:middle
But of course, that
thing is still running,

00:34:16.396 --> 00:34:19.726 A:middle
it's still available to me so if
I pull it aside, there it goes,

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.386 A:middle
you can see everything
happening right now.

00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:25.196 A:middle
The power goes up, cover back
up, power goes right back down,

00:34:25.326 --> 00:34:30.795 A:middle
it's really going to
help your battery life.

00:34:31.326 --> 00:34:35.346 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at
the new Safari top sites.

00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:37.856 A:middle
Really clean, really nice.

00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:39.246 A:middle
We'll bring out the new sidebar.

00:34:39.386 --> 00:34:40.946 A:middle
You see I have all
my bookmarks here.

00:34:41.306 --> 00:34:43.456 A:middle
I have my bookmark
folders as well.

00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:46.366 A:middle
If I want to bring a side
over for my bookmarks

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:48.576 A:middle
in the top sites, I can
just drag it out like this.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:49.525 A:middle
It's really nice.

00:34:49.666 --> 00:34:52.186 A:middle
I can open it up, animates in.

00:34:52.536 --> 00:34:57.796 A:middle
From the side bar, we also have
access to our shared links.

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:01.216 A:middle
You see sites that I'm following
here on Twitter and LinkedIn

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:01.216 A:middle
You see sites that I'm following
here on Twitter and LinkedIn

00:35:01.476 --> 00:35:03.996 A:middle
and click on a site-- a
link that's been shared.

00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:07.686 A:middle
It loads it up, I can
even retweet it right here

00:35:07.686 --> 00:35:08.646 A:middle
if I-- if I wish.

00:35:08.826 --> 00:35:10.626 A:middle
And we now have one-click
bookmarking

00:35:10.626 --> 00:35:12.446 A:middle
so I'll just click this plus
and it's going to hop right

00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:14.276 A:middle
in to my Reading
List right there.

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:16.186 A:middle
Let's go take a look
at my Reading List.

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:19.826 A:middle
See all the articles I've
added here to my Reading List?

00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
I want you to watch how
scrolling works because now,

00:35:23.156 --> 00:35:25.166 A:middle
when I scroll and I'm
reading through one article,

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.746 A:middle
I read this, this is great,
I'm really enjoying it.

00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:30.036 A:middle
Get to the bottom,
there's the next article.

00:35:30.036 --> 00:35:32.926 A:middle
I can just scroll right
through to the next article just

00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:33.376 A:middle
like that.

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:40.106 A:middle
Awesome. We also have a
beautiful new look for Reader.

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:43.476 A:middle
Here is Reader and I'm
going to bring up my--

00:35:43.546 --> 00:35:46.526 A:middle
I can actually close
up my sidebar here.

00:35:47.056 --> 00:35:49.896 A:middle
And now, as I scroll reading
and I just want to read

00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:52.466 A:middle
from one article to the
next, it's just like that.

00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:57.166 A:middle
Super clean and super nice and
that's Safari in Mavericks.

00:35:57.166 --> 00:35:57.966 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:05.916 A:middle
So, we have some
more improvements

00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:08.336 A:middle
that I think are going to really
help you with your browsing

00:36:08.336 --> 00:36:11.586 A:middle
and one of them is
iCloud Keychain, yeah.

00:36:14.516 --> 00:36:17.246 A:middle
You know, to really
be secure these days,

00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:20.896 A:middle
you want to have a different
complex password for every site

00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:23.396 A:middle
where you have a log in
but this inevitably brings

00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:25.716 A:middle
up the question,
"what's my password?"

00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:28.516 A:middle
and these solutions
are not recommended.

00:36:29.526 --> 00:36:30.676 A:middle
There is a better way.

00:36:30.946 --> 00:36:34.356 A:middle
With iCloud Keychain, we can
remember your website logins,

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.706 A:middle
your credit card numbers,
even your Wi-Fi networks

00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:44.126 A:middle
and they're always encrypted,
synced across all of your system

00:36:44.126 --> 00:36:45.466 A:middle
so they are always
available to you.

00:36:45.886 --> 00:36:48.106 A:middle
Now, when you go to
sign up for a website,

00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:51.706 A:middle
you can of course enter your own
password and we'll remember it

00:36:51.706 --> 00:36:56.136 A:middle
but as well, Safari can auto
suggest a password for you.

00:36:56.946 --> 00:36:59.856 A:middle
You don't have to remember that
but it'll enter it in for you

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
and then sync it across
all of your systems

00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.616 A:middle

iCloud Keychain is great
for your shopping as well.

00:37:14.456 --> 00:37:18.916 A:middle
When you come to a credit card
field, you can suggest any

00:37:18.916 --> 00:37:21.626 A:middle
of your remembered
credit cards, select one

00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:24.476 A:middle
and it'll just enter it in
for you just like that along

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:25.526 A:middle
with your expiration date.

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:27.766 A:middle
But you have to remember
your own security code,

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:29.446 A:middle
that's what makes
it secure after all

00:37:30.636 --> 00:37:31.976 A:middle

Next, some improvements
to Notifications.

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:45.636 A:middle
So now, with Notifications on
the Mac, if you're a Californian

00:37:45.636 --> 00:37:48.186 A:middle
like me, you'll often get
this kind of notification,

00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:50.816 A:middle
"Hey want to go surf
these 30 foot waves?"

00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:53.896 A:middle
And you response, surely is
to mouse over the notification

00:37:53.896 --> 00:37:56.736 A:middle
and immediately right there,
reply, "Yeah sure I'm going

00:37:56.736 --> 00:37:57.796 A:middle
to surf that 30 foot wave."

00:37:58.016 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
You can reply right inside the
Notification and you can do this

You can reply right inside the

00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:02.626 A:middle
for things like email

00:38:02.626 --> 00:38:04.776 A:middle

with without even
having to go to Mail.

00:38:07.376 --> 00:38:09.936 A:middle
If you get a FaceTime call,
you can response saying,

00:38:09.936 --> 00:38:11.866 A:middle
"Hey I'm going to call
you later," or remind

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:13.336 A:middle
without having to
pick up the call.

00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:14.496 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:17.616 A:middle
We also handle a new
kind of notification.

00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:21.676 A:middle
So if you have an app today
that sends push notifications

00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:24.686 A:middle
to iOS devices, well
now, you can sign

00:38:24.686 --> 00:38:27.126 A:middle
up to receive those push
notifications on your Mac

00:38:27.126 --> 00:38:29.886 A:middle
as well whether Safari
is running or not.

00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:36.356 A:middle
So, things like your
Fantasy Football alert,

00:38:37.316 --> 00:38:42.926 A:middle
maybe Breaking News, news
about that buy on eBay.

00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:48.346 A:middle
And now, in Mavericks when
your machine is sleeping,

00:38:49.546 --> 00:38:51.906 A:middle

will tell you everything

00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:54.296 A:middle
that you missed while you're

about this, take
a note like that.

00:46:16.096 --> 00:46:18.996 A:middle
Because it's a Mac, of

When it comes time to study,
you have this great study cards,

00:46:34.106 --> 00:46:37.276 A:middle
you can just flip through
them, use all your notes

&gt;&gt; Well, good morning everyone.

00:48:03.056 --> 00:48:08.796 A:middle
I'd like to talk to you
about the MacBook Air.

00:48:09.516 --> 00:48:12.736 A:middle
The MacBook Air answer
the question in this age

00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:15.846 A:middle
of the iPad, what is the
future of the notebook?

00:48:16.416 --> 00:48:19.096 A:middle
The MacBook Air really
gave us a direction

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.816 A:middle
of where the notebook can go,

00:48:20.816 --> 00:48:23.856 A:middle
and it's really become
everyone's ultimate

00:48:24.246 --> 00:48:26.046 A:middle
everyday notebook.

00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:28.776 A:middle
And that's why we're really
pleased to tell you today

00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:32.656 A:middle
that we've updated an entirely
new line of MacBook Air.

00:48:32.656 --> 00:48:36.296 A:middle
And these new MacBook Airs
deliver the most important

00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:37.736 A:middle
feature we always want

00:48:38.076 --> 00:48:42.696 A:middle
in a portable device,
all day battery life.

00:48:42.696 --> 00:48:42.866 A:middle
Yes.

00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:47.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:49.686 A:middle
And the MacBook Air is based

00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:52.926 A:middle
on a new 4th Generation
Intel Core Processor,

00:48:53.286 --> 00:48:55.486 A:middle
otherwise known as Haswell ULT.

00:48:55.486 --> 00:48:59.366 A:middle
And if you don't know Haswell
ULT, it's a great processor

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:01.506 A:middle
for incredible power savings.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:01.506 A:middle
for incredible power savings.

00:49:01.736 --> 00:49:03.996 A:middle
There's more energy-efficient
CPUs,

00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:06.316 A:middle
there's twice the
graphics execution units

00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:08.796 A:middle
so we can run them actually
to slower clock speed

00:49:08.796 --> 00:49:12.466 A:middle
to save energy and still
deliver the 40 percent faster

00:49:12.466 --> 00:49:13.506 A:middle
graphics performance.

00:49:14.046 --> 00:49:15.776 A:middle
And the Apple engineers
have worked together

00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:19.436 A:middle
with the Intel engineers on
some great low power state

00:49:19.436 --> 00:49:21.636 A:middle
so we can do things
like wake in one second

00:49:21.886 --> 00:49:24.406 A:middle
or standby for up to 30 days.

00:49:24.946 --> 00:49:26.896 A:middle
But the biggest benefit
is battery life

00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:29.666 A:middle
so here is the current
generation MacBook Air,

00:49:29.956 --> 00:49:31.536 A:middle
11 inch and 13 inch.

00:49:31.876 --> 00:49:35.266 A:middle
The 11 inch is now going to go
from 5 hours of battery life

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:43.866 A:middle
up to an incredible 9
hours of battery life.

00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:46.436 A:middle
And if you like that,
the 13 inch goes from 7

00:49:46.436 --> 00:49:51.306 A:middle
to 12 hours of battery life.

00:49:51.306 --> 00:49:54.266 A:middle
Yes, true, all day
battery life and it helps

00:49:54.266 --> 00:49:55.676 A:middle
across your entire system.

00:49:56.016 --> 00:49:58.716 A:middle
For example, if you like
watching movies from iTunes,

00:49:58.716 --> 00:50:01.976 A:middle
up to 10 hours, you can watch
almost the entire Trilogy

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.716 --> 00:50:01.976 A:middle
up to 10 hours, you can watch
almost the entire Trilogy

00:50:01.976 --> 00:50:03.966 A:middle
of Lord of the Rings,
it's amazing.

00:50:04.116 --> 00:50:07.376 A:middle
And of course, MacBook Air
is based entirely on Flash.

00:50:07.636 --> 00:50:10.286 A:middle
Flash is faster, up
to 45 percent faster

00:50:10.286 --> 00:50:13.466 A:middle
than the previous version
and Wi-Fi is faster too,

00:50:13.466 --> 00:50:16.126 A:middle
now 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking.

00:50:18.496 --> 00:50:21.536 A:middle
Now, ac gets you up to
three times the performance

00:50:21.536 --> 00:50:24.216 A:middle
of 802.11n at the same distance.

00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:27.186 A:middle
But the way to get that of
course is you want your MacBook

00:50:27.186 --> 00:50:31.816 A:middle
Air to talk to a Wi-Fi base
station that supports 802.11ac.

00:50:32.036 --> 00:50:33.366 A:middle
So, we're really happy to along

00:50:33.366 --> 00:50:37.156 A:middle
with MacBook Air announce some
new AirPort Base Stations,

00:50:37.486 --> 00:50:41.636 A:middle
entirely new designs, they're
actually a very small base,

00:50:41.636 --> 00:50:44.726 A:middle
just 4 inches square but
extruded 6 and a half inches

00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:46.906 A:middle
to get wider range
from those antennas.

00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:50.556 A:middle
So there's a new AirPort
Extreme that does 802.11ac.

00:50:50.676 --> 00:50:52.696 A:middle
There's also room in
there for a hard drive

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:55.076 A:middle
so you have a new AirPort
Time Capsule as well

00:50:55.076 --> 00:50:57.116 A:middle
and these are great
base stations.

00:50:57.426 --> 00:50:58.746 A:middle
They're incredibly powerful,

00:50:58.746 --> 00:51:00.266 A:middle
they have a lot of
cool features.

they have a lot of

00:51:00.266 --> 00:51:01.116 A:middle
I'll just point out one,

00:51:01.426 --> 00:51:03.576 A:middle
beamforming, it even
sounds cool.

00:51:03.826 --> 00:51:08.456 A:middle
Beamforming can send more energy
directly to an 802.11ac device

00:51:08.716 --> 00:51:10.536 A:middle
to enhance the throughput
and performance.

00:51:10.976 --> 00:51:12.406 A:middle
So, these are great
base stations.

00:51:13.516 --> 00:51:16.566 A:middle
The MacBook Air comes in
11 inch and 13 inches sizes

00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:19.016 A:middle
and the value is even
greater than before.

00:51:19.016 --> 00:51:20.816 A:middle
The 11 inch starts at 999

00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:23.856 A:middle
with 128 gigabytes
that's twice the storage

00:51:24.046 --> 00:51:25.586 A:middle
at the same price as before.

00:51:25.586 --> 00:51:29.676 A:middle
And the 13 inch with
128 gigs starts at 1099,

00:51:29.676 --> 00:51:32.156 A:middle
that's 100 dollars less
expensive than before.

Like with MacBook Air,

00:53:12.766 --> 00:53:15.526 A:middle

00:55:46.646 --> 00:55:48.786 A:middle
Inside is state-of-the-art
technology,

00:55:48.786 --> 00:55:52.366 A:middle
a new generation Intel Xeon
chip, up to 12 core configs,

00:55:52.366 --> 00:55:56.576 A:middle
256-bit-wide floating-point
PCI Express gen 3.

00:55:56.576 --> 00:55:59.076 A:middle
This is double the
CPU performance

00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:00.246 A:middle
of the previous generation.

of the previous generation.

00:56:00.956 --> 00:56:04.396 A:middle
The fastest memory we've ever
put in our product, ECC memory,

00:56:04.646 --> 00:56:09.376 A:middle
1,866 megahertz DDR3 on a
four-channel controller,

00:56:09.676 --> 00:56:12.036 A:middle
60 gigabyte per second
bandwidth.

00:56:12.716 --> 00:56:15.726 A:middle
That's double the performance
of the previous generation.

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:19.506 A:middle
Internal storage
is based on flash.

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:23.606 A:middle
Not any old flash,
new PCIe-based flash.

00:56:23.956 --> 00:56:28.096 A:middle
1.25 gigabytes per second reads
a gigabyte per second writes.

00:56:28.726 --> 00:56:30.916 A:middle
That's two and a
half times faster

00:56:30.916 --> 00:56:32.306 A:middle
than any flash we've ever built.

00:56:32.646 --> 00:56:35.566 A:middle
It's 10 times faster than
any hard drive we've put

00:56:35.566 --> 00:56:36.706 A:middle
in a Mac Pro before.

00:56:37.606 --> 00:56:41.446 A:middle
All expansion is external,
you can add storage arrays,

00:56:41.446 --> 00:56:43.166 A:middle
you can add expansion chassis

00:56:43.586 --> 00:56:48.306 A:middle
over the brand new announced
Thunderbolt 2, it's 20 gigabit

00:56:48.306 --> 00:56:53.036 A:middle
for seconds up to six
Thunderbolt 2 devices per port.

00:56:53.036 --> 00:56:56.346 A:middle
It's backwards compatible with
Thunderbolt 1 and FireWire

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:59.466 A:middle
and it's double the performance
of the industry's standard

00:56:59.466 --> 00:57:01.516 A:middle
and industry of leading
Thunderbolt 1.

WEBVTT

and industry of leading
Thunderbolt 1.

00:57:02.256 --> 00:57:05.736 A:middle
But the place where the team has
probably gone, the most crazy

00:57:05.736 --> 00:57:08.206 A:middle
and done something we've never
done before is in graphics.

00:57:08.546 --> 00:57:11.846 A:middle
This is the first Mac
ever that comes standard

00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:17.226 A:middle
with dual workstation GPUs,
AMD FirePro graphics in it.

00:57:17.596 --> 00:57:21.306 A:middle
You can configure it up to
4,096 screen processors,

00:57:22.016 --> 00:57:24.886 A:middle
528 gigabytes per seconds.

00:57:25.156 --> 00:57:28.276 A:middle
This is two and a half times
the graphics performance

00:57:28.276 --> 00:57:29.496 A:middle
in the last generation.

00:57:29.726 --> 00:57:31.696 A:middle
And for those of
you who use OpenCL

00:57:31.696 --> 00:57:35.556 A:middle
and you all know you should,
this delivers seven teraflops

00:57:35.826 --> 00:57:37.676 A:middle
of compute power to
your applications.

00:57:38.386 --> 00:57:41.716 A:middle
Of course, you want to hook on
the latest third party displays

00:57:42.146 --> 00:57:44.336 A:middle
and this supports 4K displays.

00:57:45.366 --> 00:57:49.996 A:middle
Yes, multiple streams
of 4K displays.

00:57:50.526 --> 00:57:53.356 A:middle
You can have up to
three 4K displays

00:57:53.486 --> 00:57:59.586 A:middle
on the built-in dual
workstation graphics.

00:57:59.586 --> 00:58:01.836 A:middle

you can be this guy.

00:58:12.166 --> 00:58:15.136 A:middle
It is a Mac unlike
any we've ever made.

00:58:15.136 --> 00:58:18.886 A:middle
It delivers so much more
performance, capabilities

00:58:18.886 --> 00:58:20.896 A:middle
and expansion than
anything we've made

00:58:21.506 --> 00:58:23.476 A:middle

00:58:31.126 --> 00:58:35.086 A:middle
of its capability inside
one eighth the volume

00:58:35.086 --> 00:58:36.156 A:middle
of the previous generation.

00:58:36.626 --> 00:58:37.876 A:middle
The one thing everyone loved

00:58:37.876 --> 00:58:40.336 A:middle
about the old generation Mac
Pro is those handles on the top

00:58:40.336 --> 00:58:43.576 A:middle
so you can move it around
to get access to the I/O.

00:58:43.806 --> 00:58:47.916 A:middle
Well, the entire top of the new
generation Mac Pro is a handle.

00:58:48.116 --> 00:58:50.616 A:middle
Just put your hand in it,
you can spin it around,

00:58:51.056 --> 00:58:52.546 A:middle
get access to the I/O.

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:55.316 A:middle
It's all organized
beautifully on the back for you.

who use this stuff know
what I'm talking about.

It's gigabit Ethernet, HDMI
out and it has a motion sensor

00:59:10.836 --> 00:59:12.966 A:middle
so when you turn
it, it even lights

00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.386 A:middle

I did say this is a sneak peek.

00:59:33.666 --> 00:59:36.456 A:middle
It is designed by brilliant

Next, I'd like to
talk about iCloud.

01:00:28.556 --> 01:00:34.416 A:middle
We've now passed 300 million
iCloud accounts making iCloud

01:00:34.416 --> 01:00:37.386 A:middle
the fastest growing
Cloud service ever.

01:00:38.646 --> 01:00:43.896 A:middle
Now, by comparison, it
took Facebook five years

01:00:43.896 --> 01:00:45.136 A:middle
to reach this many accounts.

01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:50.036 A:middle
One of the most popular features
of iCloud is iTunes in the Cloud

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:52.946 A:middle
which makes all of your
purchase content available

01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:54.126 A:middle
on all of your devices.

01:00:54.796 --> 01:00:58.676 A:middle
We now have 300 million users
of this feature and they read

01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:02.946 A:middle
out of their content
35 billion times.

01:01:04.026 --> 01:01:08.216 A:middle
Now, the back-end infrastructure
of iCloud allows us

01:01:08.216 --> 01:01:11.456 A:middle
to provide Cloud services
across many of our products

01:01:12.326 --> 01:01:15.396 A:middle
like Game Center, our
social gaming network now

01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:18.136 A:middle
with over 240 million users.

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.176 A:middle
Sixty of the top 100 games

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:24.496 A:middle
on the App Store integrate
Game Center support right

01:01:26.556 --> 01:01:30.776 A:middle
iCloud is also --
has incredible scale

01:01:31.586 --> 01:01:35.106 A:middle
like sending 800
billion iMessages,

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:40.796 A:middle
or a mind-boggling 7.4
trillion push notifications.

01:01:44.516 --> 01:01:48.776 A:middle
iCloud allows us to seamlessly
integrate Cloud services

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:50.476 A:middle
into so many of our products

01:01:50.556 --> 01:01:54.786 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Hello. Hi, let me tell
you a little bit about iWork.

01:02:21.216 --> 01:02:23.426 A:middle
iWork is pages, numbers,

01:02:23.896 --> 01:02:26.766 A:middle
And we think it's the best way
to create beautiful documents,

01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.416 A:middle
spreadsheets and presentations.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.716 A:middle
Of course, iWork was born on
the Mac and it has full support

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:36.166 A:middle
for the awesome feature set
of Mac OS X and Mac hardware.

01:02:37.036 --> 01:02:40.416 A:middle
We also have amazingly powerful
and fully multi-touch versions

01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:43.766 A:middle
of these apps on the
iPad and on the iPhone.

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:46.996 A:middle
We think our multi-touch
apps are the most powerful

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.666 A:middle
productivity apps ever
created for a mobile device.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:53.386 A:middle
And later this year, we're going
to have awesome new releases

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.326 A:middle
of both our Mac and
our iOS suites.

and go straight to
my iCloud homepage

01:03:32.216 --> 01:03:36.166 A:middle
where you see three new app

This is all happening in
a web browser of course.

01:04:10.006 --> 01:04:11.586 A:middle
So I can just click
here and type.

01:04:12.346 --> 01:04:17.296 A:middle
And over here, I have all
the formatting controls

01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:19.336 A:middle
in our new context-sensitive
format panel.

01:04:19.336 --> 01:04:23.926 A:middle
So I'll just select some
text, go up to my Styles,

01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:29.666 A:middle
choose a text style, select
some more text, choose another.

01:04:30.426 --> 01:04:33.036 A:middle
I can click on some images.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.296 A:middle
And you see, my controls
now show me Image Controls.

01:04:36.296 --> 01:04:39.836 A:middle
I can click on a bunch of
styles, choose that one.

01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:43.656 A:middle
Now, of course, Pages has always
been great at handling graphics.

01:04:43.786 --> 01:04:45.426 A:middle
So, how do I add graphics?

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:48.346 A:middle

I open it up.

[ Pause ]

01:05:21.446 --> 01:05:24.356 A:middle
And here I am editing a
Microsoft Word document

01:05:24.726 --> 01:05:26.846 A:middle
in Pages for iCloud.

01:05:27.516 --> 01:05:32.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:05:33.306 --> 01:05:34.696 A:middle
All right, let's take
a look at numbers.

01:05:35.116 --> 01:05:37.496 A:middle
Back to my iCloud homepage,
click the Numbers icon.

01:05:38.576 --> 01:05:40.046 A:middle
Again, a bunch of
beautiful documents.

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:45.986 A:middle
As you can see, this spreadsheet
has a bunch of different sheets

01:05:45.986 --> 01:05:49.256 A:middle
in it, great charts,
great tables and graphics.

01:05:50.056 --> 01:05:51.596 A:middle
Here on the last
sheet, we have a table

01:05:51.596 --> 01:05:52.506 A:middle
that hasn't been finished.

01:05:52.506 --> 01:05:55.566 A:middle
So I'm just going to click
in a cell, hit Equals.

01:05:56.266 --> 01:05:59.226 A:middle
We get help for the over
250 functions that we have.

01:06:00.016 --> 01:06:03.396 A:middle
But I'll just type SUM,
select this column,

01:06:03.986 --> 01:06:06.676 A:middle
and there you go,
my chart updates.

01:06:07.276 --> 01:06:10.326 A:middle
If I want to fill this
across the rest of the table,

01:06:10.936 --> 01:06:13.636 A:middle
I'll just drag it across,
a real spreadsheet.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.956 A:middle
Again, this is all
happening in a web browser.

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:22.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:24.756 A:middle
All right, let's try Keynote.

01:06:25.436 --> 01:06:29.026 A:middle
I will open this
presentation here.

01:06:30.066 --> 01:06:34.166 A:middle
And it's a real keynote
presentation,

01:06:35.336 --> 01:06:37.316 A:middle
photographs, texts, fonts.

01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:40.486 A:middle
I can rearrange the
slides if I want to.

01:06:41.396 --> 01:06:42.446 A:middle
I can add a new slide.

01:06:42.446 --> 01:06:45.676 A:middle
I'll click the Plus button
down here, choose this layout.

01:06:45.676 --> 01:06:47.266 A:middle
Let's give it a title.

01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:51.676 A:middle
And let's try again imaging.

01:06:51.996 --> 01:06:58.986 A:middle
Move it around, get the
alignment guides we all love

01:06:58.986 --> 01:06:59.646 A:middle
from Keynote.

scale up that mask a

01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:09.746 A:middle
Let's give it a photo border,

01:07:09.746 --> 01:07:12.086 A:middle
let's make the border
a little thicker.

01:07:13.216 --> 01:07:15.026 A:middle
Let's rotate the image.

01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:18.376 A:middle
This is all happening in a

[ Applause ]

01:07:24.556 --> 01:07:25.726 A:middle
How about animations?

01:07:26.036 --> 01:07:30.966 A:middle
Let's add a cube animation
here and click play.

beautiful Keynote 3D animations

01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:40.776 A:middle
in a browser window.

[ Applause ]

01:07:49.136 --> 01:07:49.426 A:middle
All right.

01:07:49.426 --> 01:07:51.576 A:middle
I'm sure everyone wants to know
how does this work on Windows.

01:07:52.226 --> 01:07:54.116 A:middle
Well, here it is.

01:07:54.116 --> 01:07:58.926 A:middle
This is a Windows 8 desktop,
I have IE and Chrome here,

01:07:58.926 --> 01:08:00.186 A:middle
I'm just going to
fire up Chrome.

01:08:09.116 --> 01:08:09.936 A:middle
into on the Mac.

01:08:09.936 --> 01:08:11.666 A:middle
So I'm going to open
that same document.

01:08:12.276 --> 01:08:17.006 A:middle
As you can see, it's the same,
there's the slide we just made.

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:21.746 A:middle
Let's go in there and make
that mask a little bit tighter

01:08:21.746 --> 01:08:23.086 A:middle
and move it around a little.

01:08:23.906 --> 01:08:24.345 A:middle
And there we go.

01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:27.305 A:middle
I'm editing a Keynote

[ Applause ]

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:39.145 A:middle
All right.

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:40.496 A:middle
That is iWork for iCloud.

01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:42.176 A:middle
Now, we know, in a lot of cases,

01:08:42.176 --> 01:08:43.876 A:middle
that the best user
experiences are made

01:08:43.876 --> 01:08:45.156 A:middle
with native app technologies.

01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:47.345 A:middle
But I think you can
see with iWork

01:08:47.345 --> 01:08:49.636 A:middle
for iCloud you can do some
pretty great stuff on the web.

01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.656 A:middle
As I mentioned, we
support IE or--

01:08:52.656 --> 01:08:54.595 A:middle
we support Safari
best I should say.

01:08:55.036 --> 01:08:57.015 A:middle

run best in Safari.

as a developer beta.

01:09:13.975 --> 01:09:17.595 A:middle
Just go to iCloud and
we'll expand that beta

01:09:17.595 --> 01:09:20.196 A:middle
to include all users of
iCloud later in the year.

[ Applause ]

01:09:40.206 --> 01:09:43.286 A:middle
iOS is the world's most
advanced mobile operating system

and powers the world's
best mobile devices.

But, it's extraordinary
and we're proud of it,

01:10:02.956 --> 01:10:04.226 A:middle
but it's not what drives us.

01:10:05.396 --> 01:10:08.426 A:middle
We want to make the best
products that people use more

01:10:08.456 --> 01:10:10.526 A:middle
and love more than
anyone else's.

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:13.436 A:middle
And I'm really happy
to tell you,

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:16.866 A:middle
people are using our
products substantially more

01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:17.726 A:middle
than anyone else's.

01:10:18.526 --> 01:10:19.276 A:middle
Let me show you.

01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:24.936 A:middle
This recent study from Experian
showed that iPhone users use

01:10:24.936 --> 01:10:30.516 A:middle
of iPhone 50 percent more than
Android users use their phone.

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:34.486 A:middle
Now this is incredible
but may be not surprising.

01:10:34.486 --> 01:10:43.026 A:middle
And if you look at mobile web
share, it's not even close.

01:10:43.556 --> 01:10:47.716 A:middle
iOS is two and a
half times Android.

01:10:47.716 --> 01:10:52.526 A:middle
And if you look at iPads
compared to all other tablets,

01:10:53.076 --> 01:10:54.456 A:middle
it's not even comparable.

01:10:55.326 --> 01:10:57.966 A:middle
iPad is over four times more.

01:10:59.466 --> 01:11:01.626 A:middle
Now this shows up in
a variety of ways.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:10:59.466 --> 01:11:01.626 A:middle
Now this shows up in
a variety of ways.

01:11:01.626 --> 01:11:06.556 A:middle
As an example, just like
iOS customers buy more

01:11:06.556 --> 01:11:11.646 A:middle
of your incredible apps,
they evidently also buy a lot

01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:14.426 A:middle
of everything else according
to a recent IBM survey.

01:11:15.536 --> 01:11:19.456 A:middle
Both iPhone and iPad
customers were responsible

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:22.696 A:middle
for materially more
mobile shopping traffic

01:11:23.126 --> 01:11:26.776 A:middle
than all other Android
devices combined

01:11:26.856 --> 01:11:29.066 A:middle
on the most critical day
of shopping last year.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.136 A:middle
Now, it probably
doesn't surprise you

01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:37.256 A:middle
if people are using them
more, they love them more.

01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:43.276 A:middle
And this is what is
most important to us.

01:11:43.506 --> 01:11:45.156 A:middle
iPhone was named number one

01:11:45.156 --> 01:11:47.786 A:middle
in customer satisfaction
by J.D. Power.

01:11:48.226 --> 01:11:52.296 A:middle
Not just once, but
nine consecutive times.

01:11:52.356 --> 01:11:54.356 A:middle

has ever been done.

[ Applause ]

01:12:01.496 --> 01:12:04.986 A:middle
And iOS satisfaction is
literally off the charts.

01:12:05.346 --> 01:12:09.356 A:middle
Change Wage [phonetic] recently
measured it at 97 percent.

01:12:09.896 --> 01:12:14.156 A:middle
And if you look at those
people that responded

01:12:14.156 --> 01:12:18.246 A:middle
that they're very satisfied
and really look at the detail

01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:23.966 A:middle
which I'm sometimes known to
do, you would see that iOS blows

01:12:23.966 --> 01:12:27.276 A:middle
out everyone else,
20 points better

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:29.356 A:middle
than our closest competitor

01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:32.426 A:middle
and almost 25 points
better than Android.

[ Applause ]

01:12:39.136 --> 01:12:41.246 A:middle
One of the reasons for this is

01:12:41.246 --> 01:12:44.316 A:middle
that we provide amazing
software updates

01:12:44.806 --> 01:12:48.146 A:middle
that provide users
incredible new features.

01:12:49.086 --> 01:12:52.216 A:middle
And we do this easily
and make them available

01:12:52.216 --> 01:12:54.326 A:middle
to as many users as possible.

01:12:55.436 --> 01:12:56.296 A:middle
Let me show you.

01:12:57.386 --> 01:13:03.326 A:middle
Over 90 percent of iOS users are
using the latest version of iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

Over 90 percent of iOS users are
using the latest version of iOS.

01:13:03.326 --> 01:13:08.256 A:middle
Now, that's in stark contrast
to the world of Android.

01:13:10.106 --> 01:13:14.646 A:middle
And by the way, this is the
most ideal state of Android.

01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:17.686 A:middle
It only includes us version
of Android which talk

01:13:17.686 --> 01:13:19.156 A:middle
to the Google Play store.

01:13:19.476 --> 01:13:21.986 A:middle
So it doesn't things
like Kindles and Nooks.

01:13:23.136 --> 01:13:26.486 A:middle
But even then, it's
a pretty bleak story.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:31.826 A:middle
More than a third of Android
users are using an operating

01:13:31.936 --> 01:13:36.986 A:middle
system that was released
in 2010.

01:13:37.116 --> 01:13:41.276 A:middle
And if you look at the customers
of each operating system

01:13:41.536 --> 01:13:45.946 A:middle
which are using the latest
version, it's not even close.

01:13:47.206 --> 01:13:49.476 A:middle
Now this isn't just
bad for users,

01:13:49.996 --> 01:13:52.586 A:middle
but this version
fragmentation is terrible

01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:57.426 A:middle
for developers as
many of you know.

01:13:57.836 --> 01:14:00.606 A:middle

01:13:57.836 --> 01:14:00.606 A:middle
In fact, if you do the
math, you would find

01:14:00.606 --> 01:14:05.736 A:middle
that iOS 6 is the world's most
popular mobile operating system

01:14:06.326 --> 01:14:09.216 A:middle
and in second place is
a version of Android

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:11.886 A:middle
which was released in 2010.

01:14:13.626 --> 01:14:18.866 A:middle
Now this is why we get so
excited when we're working

01:14:18.866 --> 01:14:22.726 A:middle
on a new version of
iOS because we know

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:26.386 A:middle
that we can positively
affect millions of developers

of users.

what we've been up to.

01:16:20.556 --> 01:16:24.146 A:middle
True simplicity is
derived from so much more

like redesigning all the icons,

and developing a grid

01:17:18.296 --> 01:17:21.496 A:middle
to achieve a much more
harmonious relationship

Trash and More Options

01:26:12.196 --> 01:26:13.926 A:middle
as well right here in Mail.

01:26:14.996 --> 01:26:17.256 A:middle
Finally, let's take a look
at Notification Center.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:19.656 A:middle
Same as always, we can
just swipe out from the top

01:26:19.656 --> 01:26:21.726 A:middle
of the device, comes
down with a nice thud,

01:26:21.726 --> 01:26:24.486 A:middle
you can see all notifications,
just might miss once.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.296 A:middle
And we've just great
new Today view.

01:26:26.296 --> 01:26:29.666 A:middle
So you can see you friends'
birthdays current look

01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:35.366 A:middle
at the weather, your upcoming
invitations, your calendar,

01:26:35.596 --> 01:26:39.706 A:middle
your stocks, and even a
quickly look at tomorrow.

01:26:40.156 --> 01:26:41.216 A:middle
You know, it's really great

01:26:41.216 --> 01:26:45.136 A:middle
as for the first time ever
Notification Center is now

01:26:45.136 --> 01:26:47.586 A:middle
available from the
lock screen as well.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.316 A:middle
You don't even have
to unlock your device.

01:26:51.846 --> 01:26:55.626 A:middle
[applause] So that's
a quick look at iOS 7.

01:26:56.146 --> 01:27:01.026 A:middle
It's a comprehensive end-to-end
redesign of the user experience.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:26:56.146 --> 01:27:01.026 A:middle
It's a comprehensive end-to-end
redesign of the user experience.

01:27:01.846 --> 01:27:04.416 A:middle
Installing iOS 7
on your phone is

01:27:04.416 --> 01:27:06.176 A:middle
like getting an entirely
new phone,

01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:08.556 A:middle
but when you already
know how to use,

01:27:09.046 --> 01:27:12.826 A:middle
when it's so much more beautiful
and functional than ever before.

01:27:14.456 --> 01:27:16.966 A:middle
But iOS 7 is actually
more than that.

01:27:17.536 --> 01:27:20.266 A:middle
It's also a major
feature release as well.

01:27:20.266 --> 01:27:23.346 A:middle
I have 10 features I want
to talk to you about today,

01:27:23.766 --> 01:27:26.226 A:middle
starting with Control Center.

01:27:27.646 --> 01:27:29.036 A:middle
Control Center is
something that's

01:27:29.356 --> 01:27:31.396 A:middle
so simple and yet so essential.

01:27:31.926 --> 01:27:34.036 A:middle
You have those switches
that you just want to get

01:27:34.036 --> 01:27:35.816 A:middle
to really quickly
from wherever you are.

01:27:35.906 --> 01:27:38.966 A:middle
Well, now, with Control Center,
swipe up from that bottom

01:27:38.966 --> 01:27:41.376 A:middle
of the device and
there they are.

01:27:42.516 --> 01:27:46.476 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:50.646 A:middle
Turn on Airplane Mode, adjust
your brightness, play a song,

01:27:51.476 --> 01:27:57.096 A:middle
even get at a flashlight,
and available from anywhere,

01:27:57.096 --> 01:27:58.306 A:middle
including your lock screen.

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.286 A:middle
So if you wake up in the middle
of the night and you need

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.286 A:middle
So if you wake up in the middle
of the night and you need

01:28:00.286 --> 01:28:02.876 A:middle
to find something, your
flashlight's right there.

01:28:03.586 --> 01:28:05.126 A:middle
And that's Control Center.

01:28:05.846 --> 01:28:08.636 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about Multitasking.

01:28:09.686 --> 01:28:12.976 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 has always been built

01:28:12.976 --> 01:28:16.266 A:middle
on the industrial strength
foundations of OS X.

01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:20.876 A:middle
It's had intrinsic powerful
multitasking capabilities.

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.156 A:middle
But we had to be careful
about how we'd exposed these

01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:26.266 A:middle
to applications because we want
to preserve great battery life.

01:28:27.246 --> 01:28:31.696 A:middle
Now on iOS 4 we did add
support for select kinds

01:28:31.696 --> 01:28:33.536 A:middle
of applications to
do multitasking.

01:28:33.596 --> 01:28:37.216 A:middle
Things like plain music in the
background or receiving a voice

01:28:37.216 --> 01:28:40.246 A:middle
over IP call, or your
app is in the background.

01:28:40.806 --> 01:28:44.026 A:middle
Well, now, in iOS 7, I'm pleased
to announce that we're going

01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:48.976 A:middle
to have multitasking for all
apps with great battery life.

01:28:49.516 --> 01:28:55.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:28:55.576 --> 01:28:56.466 A:middle
So, how does it work?

01:28:57.386 --> 01:28:58.836 A:middle
Well, imagine you have an app

01:28:59.136 --> 01:29:01.436 A:middle
that you're using
constantly throughout the day,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:28:59.136 --> 01:29:01.436 A:middle
that you're using
constantly throughout the day,

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:03.986 A:middle
a social networking app or
something and you're checking

01:29:03.986 --> 01:29:07.176 A:middle
in all of the time, what iOS
7 has noticed is that pattern

01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:08.816 A:middle
of use and is going
to provide that app

01:29:08.816 --> 01:29:11.866 A:middle
with frequent background
activity to stay up to date.

01:29:11.866 --> 01:29:15.226 A:middle
And there's even other app you
used, maybe that you just check

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:17.786 A:middle
in on in the morning or
breakfast, maybe at night

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:20.356 A:middle
after work, well iOS
7 notices that too.

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.646 A:middle
And it's going to give that
app background cycles just

01:29:23.646 --> 01:29:25.836 A:middle
in time to-- it's up to
date for when you need it.

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:29.716 A:middle
Now, in addition to this
intelligence scheduling,

01:29:30.176 --> 01:29:32.746 A:middle
iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates.

01:29:33.106 --> 01:29:36.146 A:middle
The average user wakes their
device dozens of time a day

01:29:36.146 --> 01:29:37.696 A:middle
and those provide
great opportunities

01:29:37.896 --> 01:29:39.216 A:middle
when the system's
already powered

01:29:39.216 --> 01:29:41.316 A:middle
up to update apps
on the background.

01:29:42.066 --> 01:29:44.616 A:middle
It also adapts intelligently
the network conditions.

01:29:45.056 --> 01:29:46.856 A:middle
So if it's in-- you
have good coverage,

01:29:47.096 --> 01:29:48.466 A:middle
it's a great time to fetch.

01:29:49.286 --> 01:29:52.586 A:middle
And it coalesces updates
across multiple applications.

01:29:52.586 --> 01:29:54.396 A:middle
So once you have those
radios powered up,

01:29:54.396 --> 01:29:57.156 A:middle
lets multiple applications
take advantage of it

01:29:57.156 --> 01:29:58.366 A:middle
for their background updates.

01:29:58.806 --> 01:30:03.206 A:middle
And, finally, iOS 7 response to
push notifications as a trigger

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:58.806 --> 01:30:03.206 A:middle
And, finally, iOS 7 response to
push notifications as a trigger

01:30:03.206 --> 01:30:05.956 A:middle
to give that application
time in the background.

01:30:06.046 --> 01:30:07.136 A:middle
So when you follow
that notification,

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:08.516 A:middle
the app will already
be up to date.

01:30:09.516 --> 01:30:14.786 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:18.536 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 also has a great
new user interface for moving

01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.846 A:middle
between all the things you
have going on on your phone.

01:30:21.366 --> 01:30:25.446 A:middle
Now, you could double click and
move into Notifications Center

01:30:25.446 --> 01:30:27.586 A:middle
and just swipe between
your running applications,

01:30:27.706 --> 01:30:32.236 A:middle
tap and move right in and
that is multitasking in iOS 7.

01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:38.226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:40.736 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Safari.

01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:45.496 A:middle
Safari is the most popular
mobile browser in the world.

01:30:46.166 --> 01:30:48.386 A:middle
And in iOS 7 we're
making it even better.

01:30:49.726 --> 01:30:52.836 A:middle
Has a great new full
screen look,

01:30:53.446 --> 01:30:54.926 A:middle
really focused on your content.

01:30:55.586 --> 01:30:57.586 A:middle
If you pull down
or tap at the top,

01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:59.616 A:middle
you can now get a
smart search field.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:00.546 --> 01:31:04.756 A:middle
From that search field, you can
get it one tap access to all

01:31:04.756 --> 01:31:09.026 A:middle
of your favorites as well
as do search and access URLs

01:31:09.436 --> 01:31:12.756 A:middle
and there's a great new
interface for your tabs.

01:31:13.566 --> 01:31:16.496 A:middle
In addition to all of this,
it has parental controls

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:20.166 A:middle
and integration with the same
iCloud Keychain you saw earlier

01:31:20.746 --> 01:31:21.506 A:middle
with Mavericks.

01:31:22.126 --> 01:31:24.896 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a demo of Safari now.

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.916 A:middle
Let's take a look.

01:31:27.516 --> 01:31:31.086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:37.786 A:middle
OK, head on in to Safari.

01:31:39.106 --> 01:31:40.536 A:middle
So here we are in Safari.

01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:42.306 A:middle
I'm going to just
zoom in on this page.

01:31:42.306 --> 01:31:47.406 A:middle
I want you to watch as I scroll,
all the controls just recede

01:31:47.406 --> 01:31:49.756 A:middle
and now you have that full
screen for your content.

01:31:50.606 --> 01:31:52.626 A:middle
We've really improved the way
you navigate now in Safari.

01:31:52.626 --> 01:31:56.876 A:middle
I'm just going to tap in here
to link to a detailed story.

01:31:57.006 --> 01:31:59.446 A:middle
I mean you can even zoom
in of course on this page.

01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:02.456 A:middle
And that same gesture you saw
earlier for going back well

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:02.456 A:middle
And that same gesture you saw
earlier for going back well

01:32:02.456 --> 01:32:04.166 A:middle
of course that works
in Safari as well.

01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:05.956 A:middle
So I just swiped in from
the edge of the display

01:32:05.956 --> 01:32:08.326 A:middle
and I can navigate
back and forth

01:32:08.326 --> 01:32:11.526 A:middle
through my browser
history just like that.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.126 A:middle
It's such a fantastic
way to browse.

01:32:15.026 --> 01:32:17.136 A:middle
Next, let's look at that
unified search field.

01:32:17.136 --> 01:32:18.636 A:middle
I'm just going to tap
up here at the top.

01:32:19.116 --> 01:32:22.066 A:middle
You see I have one tap
access to all my favorites.

01:32:22.176 --> 01:32:23.786 A:middle
It's really convenient
but I'm going to type

01:32:23.786 --> 01:32:25.846 A:middle
in this case so I'll type DIS.

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:30.146 A:middle
And you notice, I have
a top URL hit as well

01:32:30.146 --> 01:32:33.266 A:middle
as Google Search suggestions as
well available all right here.

01:32:34.336 --> 01:32:36.236 A:middle
We've really improved
bookmarking as well.

01:32:36.236 --> 01:32:38.046 A:middle
I use this bookmark
control down at the bottom.

01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:41.496 A:middle
I see my bookmark
folders, all my bookmarks.

01:32:41.926 --> 01:32:42.866 A:middle
We also have shared links.

01:32:42.866 --> 01:32:46.076 A:middle
You can see stories posted by
people you follow on Twitter.

01:32:46.546 --> 01:32:48.046 A:middle
And my Reading List.

01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:50.776 A:middle
And, now, just like you
saw on Mavericks on iOS,

01:32:50.776 --> 01:32:53.276 A:middle
you can scroll continuously
from article to article

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:54.756 A:middle
without coming back to the list.

01:32:55.016 --> 01:32:55.876 A:middle
It's really awesome.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:59.206 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at tabs.

01:32:59.626 --> 01:33:05.436 A:middle
I'm going to click here at the
bottom into tabs, unbelievable,

I'm going to click here at the
bottom into tabs, unbelievable,

01:33:05.886 --> 01:33:07.566 A:middle
and you're no longer
limited to just eight.

[ Applause ]

01:33:14.366 --> 01:33:17.586 A:middle
And down at the bottom are
also all your iCloud tabs.

01:33:17.586 --> 01:33:21.106 A:middle
You can see what you left open
on your other devices as well.

01:33:21.106 --> 01:33:25.576 A:middle
And tabs, they're
really nice to use.

01:33:25.576 --> 01:33:28.556 A:middle
You can just tap,
sweep into a tab,

01:33:28.746 --> 01:33:32.246 A:middle
back out, back in, back out.

01:33:32.426 --> 01:33:33.386 A:middle
It's just fantastic.

01:33:33.386 --> 01:33:35.856 A:middle
If you want to reorder your
tabs, just tap and hold,

01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:37.556 A:middle
just rearrange them like this.

01:33:37.786 --> 01:33:40.556 A:middle
And if you're done with
the tab, just swipe it off

01:33:40.556 --> 01:33:42.406 A:middle
to the side and it goes away.

01:33:43.536 --> 01:33:45.186 A:middle
And that's the new Safari.

Let's take a look now
at Control Center.

01:33:55.846 --> 01:33:58.616 A:middle
So I'm just going to swipe up
from the bottom of my display

01:33:59.036 --> 01:34:00.456 A:middle
and up comes Control Center.

and up comes Control Center.

01:34:00.926 --> 01:34:03.906 A:middle
See how these great switches
at the top can turn on and off.

access my brightness,

you can even access a

course this is available

to me everywhere so if I'm
in Safari for instance.

You can turn off that music.

And you notice how its layering

01:34:27.276 --> 01:34:30.096 A:middle
and transparency take the
personality, the environment

It's just a great way to get

01:34:44.286 --> 01:34:45.876 A:middle
across all the things
you're doing on your device

01:34:45.876 --> 01:34:47.616 A:middle
so if I just double click
here on my Home button,

01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:49.756 A:middle
jump into Multitasking.

01:34:50.116 --> 01:34:52.516 A:middle
I can just swipe across
everything I have running.

01:34:52.676 --> 01:34:57.186 A:middle
I want to move into one,
Messages, double tap, back out.

01:34:58.346 --> 01:35:03.356 A:middle
Move into Mail, back
out, just like this.

01:35:04.216 --> 01:35:05.176 A:middle
It's really, really nice.

01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:07.656 A:middle
That's multitasking in iOS 7.

01:35:08.606 --> 01:35:09.076 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

01:35:14.496 --> 01:35:15.656 A:middle
So of course there's much,

01:35:15.656 --> 01:35:18.976 A:middle
much more to iOS 7,
including AirDrop.

[ Applause ]

01:35:23.696 --> 01:35:27.106 A:middle
AirDrop is absolutely
the easiest way to share

01:35:27.106 --> 01:35:28.706 A:middle
with the people that
are right around you.

01:35:29.206 --> 01:35:33.376 A:middle
So now when you're in any app
that supports a Share Sheet,

01:35:33.556 --> 01:35:36.356 A:middle
you bring up the Share Sheet
and your friends that are all

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:38.636 A:middle
around you just show
up right there.

01:35:39.646 --> 01:35:44.166 A:middle
You tap on one and they're
going to get a panel right

01:35:44.166 --> 01:35:46.846 A:middle
on their display and they
can accept what it is

01:35:46.846 --> 01:35:47.616 A:middle
that you shared.

01:35:48.226 --> 01:35:49.046 A:middle
They accept it.

01:35:49.216 --> 01:35:51.726 A:middle
They're taken right into the
app and you know if you want

01:35:51.726 --> 01:35:55.526 A:middle
to share with multiple people
you just tap, tap, tap.

01:35:55.906 --> 01:35:57.636 A:middle
No need to wander
around the room,

01:35:57.996 --> 01:35:59.976 A:middle
bumping your phone or whatever.

01:36:09.036 --> 01:36:11.516 A:middle
Now, this is system wide for
any app that's supports a Share

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:16.086 A:middle
Sheet and of course it uses peer
to peer Wi-Fi for maximum speed

01:36:16.386 --> 01:36:19.156 A:middle
and all your transmissions
are securely encrypted

01:36:19.556 --> 01:36:22.536 A:middle
because it uses the latest
Wi-Fi hardware, it's supported

01:36:22.536 --> 01:36:25.576 A:middle
on the iPhone 5, the
fourth-generation iPad,

01:36:26.126 --> 01:36:29.326 A:middle
iPad mini and the
fifth-generation iPod Touch

01:36:30.186 --> 01:36:32.166 A:middle
and that is AirDrop.

01:36:32.596 --> 01:36:34.146 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about the camera.

01:36:35.216 --> 01:36:38.816 A:middle
So, now, your camera in iOS
7 is four cameras in one.

01:36:39.186 --> 01:36:42.546 A:middle
You just swipe from your video
camera to your photo camera,

01:36:43.596 --> 01:36:46.956 A:middle
to your square cropped
camera, to your pano camera.

01:36:47.566 --> 01:36:50.246 A:middle
And when you're taking
stills, you now have access

01:36:50.736 --> 01:36:54.556 A:middle
to live photo filters from
some gorgeous black and whites,

01:36:54.986 --> 01:36:58.106 A:middle
to some classic color
filters as well.

01:36:58.256 --> 01:36:59.686 A:middle
So with your great,
new camera we want

01:36:59.686 --> 01:37:02.256 A:middle
to give you a great new
way to manage your photos

to give you a great new
way to manage your photos

01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:03.876 A:middle
and it's the new Photos app.

01:37:04.706 --> 01:37:08.406 A:middle
You know for many users this is
what their photo organization

01:37:08.566 --> 01:37:10.436 A:middle
looks like: an endless,

01:37:10.436 --> 01:37:12.946 A:middle
unorganized stream
of their camera roll.

01:37:12.946 --> 01:37:14.406 A:middle
We've all been there
but, you know,

01:37:14.406 --> 01:37:15.966 A:middle
it doesn't have to be this way.

01:37:17.666 --> 01:37:19.926 A:middle
There's great information
in those photos.

01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:22.926 A:middle
iOS knows where you took the
photos and when you took them

01:37:22.926 --> 01:37:26.186 A:middle
and that provides inherent
structure that we can use

01:37:26.186 --> 01:37:27.746 A:middle
to organize those photos.

01:37:27.896 --> 01:37:31.036 A:middle
And now in photos
in iOS 7, we do.

01:37:31.406 --> 01:37:33.036 A:middle
We organize them into moments.

01:37:33.166 --> 01:37:35.276 A:middle
And I'd like to give you
a demo of that right now.

01:37:36.516 --> 01:37:41.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:37:42.436 --> 01:37:44.136 A:middle
So let's take a look
now at the Photos app.

01:37:45.766 --> 01:37:49.916 A:middle
So here you see some photos
that were taken in San Francisco

01:37:49.916 --> 01:37:53.896 A:middle
and you see nothing was done to
organize these photos explicitly

01:37:53.896 --> 01:37:54.816 A:middle
and yet they have these labels.

01:37:54.816 --> 01:37:56.416 A:middle
It's like the Palace
of Fine Arts,

01:37:57.426 --> 01:37:59.716 A:middle
Baker Beach, Lombard Street.

01:37:59.716 --> 01:38:01.556 A:middle
It provides this
natural organization

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:37:59.716 --> 01:38:01.556 A:middle
It provides this
natural organization

01:38:01.556 --> 01:38:02.916 A:middle
for appreciating the photos.

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:05.986 A:middle
We can go up that more trips
at more times in San Francisco,

01:38:05.986 --> 01:38:08.526 A:middle
Golden Gate, to San
Francisco Fisherman's Wharf.

01:38:08.796 --> 01:38:10.496 A:middle
But then you see we have home.

01:38:10.576 --> 01:38:12.856 A:middle
We have photos taken at
home and photos taken

01:38:12.856 --> 01:38:15.576 A:middle
at the elementary school
and around that area.

01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:19.246 A:middle
And now if you want to
zoom back out to get a--

01:38:19.246 --> 01:38:21.146 A:middle
more of bird's eye view
of your collection,

01:38:21.556 --> 01:38:23.696 A:middle
we draw these moments
intelligently together

01:38:23.696 --> 01:38:24.466 A:middle
into collections.

01:38:25.746 --> 01:38:27.816 A:middle
So see here how that
multiple day trip

01:38:27.816 --> 01:38:30.556 A:middle
around San Francisco is
collected-- sorry about that,

01:38:30.556 --> 01:38:32.466 A:middle
I've got a little
excited there, into--

01:38:32.466 --> 01:38:34.756 A:middle
it's a very exciting interface

01:38:34.756 --> 01:38:38.396 A:middle
into a multi-day trip
in San Francisco.

01:38:38.516 --> 01:38:40.936 A:middle
And that time at home and
around the school, well,

01:38:40.936 --> 01:38:44.026 A:middle
that's one moment-- that's
one collection as well.

01:38:44.466 --> 01:38:46.226 A:middle
It's a really great way
to browse your photos.

01:38:46.566 --> 01:38:50.316 A:middle
You can even go all the
way out to the year level.

01:38:51.716 --> 01:38:53.696 A:middle

01:39:01.276 --> 01:39:04.196 A:middle
And look how we pull out the
interesting places that you went

01:39:04.196 --> 01:39:08.966 A:middle
in that year like 2011 was
Colorado and Hawaii, 2012,

01:39:09.266 --> 01:39:10.346 A:middle
went to South America.

01:39:10.346 --> 01:39:11.666 A:middle
You may not remember
when you did it

01:39:11.666 --> 01:39:13.946 A:middle
but iOS does and
it's right there.

01:39:14.736 --> 01:39:18.456 A:middle
And, you know, with this retina
display you can even can make

01:39:18.456 --> 01:39:20.516 A:middle
out patterns of photos in
one different occasions

01:39:20.516 --> 01:39:22.736 A:middle
or in a course we found like
we had the urge that we wanted

01:39:22.736 --> 01:39:24.206 A:middle
to just tap in right from here.

01:39:24.516 --> 01:39:26.576 A:middle
And so now in fact you can.

01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:28.776 A:middle
You can just tap and scrub

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:32.356 A:middle
and find the photo you're
looking for just like that.

01:39:32.356 --> 01:39:33.876 A:middle
It's really just amazing.

01:39:33.876 --> 01:39:36.866 A:middle
So I can just pick a photo
here whichever one I want.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:39.876 A:middle
It's kind of cute and
now we can edit it

01:39:39.876 --> 01:39:41.106 A:middle
because we have photo filters.

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:42.506 A:middle
So I can go into
the filters here,

01:39:42.886 --> 01:39:47.086 A:middle
I can try different color
effects, and if I find one I

01:39:47.086 --> 01:39:49.036 A:middle
like maybe a nice
black and white,

01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:50.496 A:middle
you can do it just like that.

01:39:50.726 --> 01:39:52.586 A:middle
I'll apply it and
save that photo away.

01:39:53.266 --> 01:39:54.316 A:middle
We also have great new ways

01:39:54.356 --> 01:39:56.486 A:middle
to share your photos
in the Photos apps.

I'd see you, it looks
like it didn't leak,

so that's good you're not

01:40:03.876 --> 01:40:06.416 A:middle
in there right now,
but you have AirDrop.

01:40:06.546 --> 01:40:08.776 A:middle

It's going to iCloud
photo sharing.

01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:19.686 A:middle
And from here, I can
select the Photo Streams

01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:20.786 A:middle
that I want to share too.

01:40:21.066 --> 01:40:23.376 A:middle

but I'm going to drill in

01:40:23.816 --> 01:40:26.506 A:middle
and I can see other Photo
Streams I've set up.

01:40:26.506 --> 01:40:30.536 A:middle
And now, other people can share
into my Photo Stream as well.

I could see my photo
with a comment.
