[ Silence ]

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:14.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Designing
Accessories for iOS and OS X.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.666 A:middle
So, my name is Peter Langenfeld.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:20.676 A:middle
I'll be walking you guys
through the session today,

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.836 A:middle
and a little bit about what
are we going to talk about.

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:24.906 A:middle
Of course, we're going to
talk about the new features

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:27.336 A:middle
in iOS 7 and in Mavericks.

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:30.726 A:middle
We want to spend a
little bit of time talking

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:33.006 A:middle
about the frameworks
that you guys can use

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.046 A:middle
as application developers
to utilize accessories

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.366 A:middle
and to better expand
the accessory ecosystem.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.086 A:middle
And then, of course, we
want to focus in on some

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.796 A:middle
of the technologies and new
things we've done overall

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:44.696 A:middle
and the exciting--

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:46.306 A:middle
these exciting parts that
we think you guys have

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:50.726 A:middle
opportunities in regarding
Wi-Fi, AirPlay, Bluetooth,

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:52.076 A:middle
Lightning connector,
few other things

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:53.876 A:middle
that we'll probably
touch on in between.

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:57.146 A:middle
So, first, I want
to thank you guys,

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.806 A:middle
thank you for coming today,
thank you giving me a nice crowd

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.806 A:middle
thank you for coming today,
thank you giving me a nice crowd

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:02.296 A:middle
to get nervous in front of.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.706 A:middle
But also thank you
for developing

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:05.976 A:middle
such great devices
and accessories.

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:08.416 A:middle
It really makes us excited
everyday to come in to work

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.626 A:middle
and to work on the overall
accessory ecosystem,

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.076 A:middle
see how many cool
things appearing

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.326 A:middle
for our users to enjoy.

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:20.876 A:middle
You know, one of the big
things that we notice working

00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:22.806 A:middle
on accessories in the
accessory ecosystem is

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:27.996 A:middle
that you guys have really
helped our devices become a part

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
of people's everyday lives,
a critical part of that.

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:32.466 A:middle
And so I want to give
you guys a few examples

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.716 A:middle
of the things we find
really interesting and kind

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.936 A:middle
of maybe give you some ideas

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:38.986 A:middle
of areas you can work
on and expand on.

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.276 A:middle
Of course, we always like
to see new things as well.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
So health and fitness
is great area

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.686 A:middle
that we've been seeing a
lot of expansion recently.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:49.226 A:middle
You know, in this
particular example,

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.726 A:middle
we have a blood pressure cuff,

00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:54.796 A:middle
but we also have fitness
monitors, Wi-Fi scales,

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.206 A:middle
things that basically
help people to keep track

00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:00.766 A:middle
of their everyday lives to
become better individuals

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:00.766 A:middle
of their everyday lives to
become better individuals

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.466 A:middle
and to really make the
merging of the applications,

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
the iOS device, the Mac device,
and the accessory system meshed

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.326 A:middle
into their everyday lives
and improve life in general.

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:12.396 A:middle
And we think that's great.

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:13.756 A:middle
We love seeing it.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.506 A:middle
Of course, we also have
some home products as well.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:21.056 A:middle
Here's the Nest thermostat
and it really, again,

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.856 A:middle
just highlights the fact
that you can merge this

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:27.186 A:middle
into your life, you can
utilize it, you can decide

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:29.996 A:middle
to save some energy, you can
decide to heat up your home,

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.616 A:middle
you can decide to see
how you're doing as far

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:37.236 A:middle
as performance overall so that
you can add something more

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.066 A:middle
to your overall experience
than just "Oh,

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.246 A:middle
I feel cold," or "I feel hot."

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:41.976 A:middle
You can actually see
how things are going

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:42.876 A:middle
and we think that's great.

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:44.546 A:middle
And then finally, fun.

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:46.816 A:middle
Everybody likes to have fun.

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:48.006 A:middle
We like to have fun.

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:51.236 A:middle
And we think it's fun that you
guys have enabled things like--

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:53.936 A:middle
they are drawn to play
kind of the interactive,

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.226 A:middle
virtual reality video
games essentially.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:00.476 A:middle
And all of that is
enabled by accessories.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:00.476 A:middle
And all of that is
enabled by accessories.

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.016 A:middle
All of that is enabled
by you guys.

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:04.726 A:middle
And it makes us excited
and thrilled to come

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.666 A:middle
to work every day,
create solutions together

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.626 A:middle
that we can really get
the overall consumer base

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:11.236 A:middle
excited about.

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:12.836 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.336 A:middle
Well, here's the
infamous super slide.

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:19.266 A:middle
These are all the different
technologies that we support.

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.436 A:middle
There's obviously many more

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:22.726 A:middle
but we think these ones
are particularly important.

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.656 A:middle
And this here, I
think, we really want

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:30.946 A:middle
to highlight the fact that OS
X and OS 7-- iOS 7, excuse me,

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:33.976 A:middle
work together and
as app developers

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:37.446 A:middle
and accessory manufacturers, you
guys can support both platforms,

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:42.666 A:middle
mostly seamlessly and really
support more consumers overall.

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:47.016 A:middle
So we have a few actual
connectivity options listed

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:47.576 A:middle
on the slide.

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:51.806 A:middle
Of course, Wi-Fi, Lightning,
Bluetooth low energy are things

00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
that we're very excited about

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.656 A:middle
and are pushing forward
constantly as far

00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:57.626 A:middle
as the technology bases.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.776 A:middle
But also things such as
the 3.5-millimeter jack,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.776 A:middle
But also things such as
the 3.5-millimeter jack,

00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:03.706 A:middle
the headphone jack are
also opportunities for you

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:07.036 A:middle
as developers to take
advantage of in both your apps

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.806 A:middle
and in the overall
accessory ecosystem.

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:11.046 A:middle
So we want to highlight
those things.

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:16.255 A:middle
Of course, there are also the
way you access these things

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:20.106 A:middle
from apps, the actual protocols
and the frameworks, like I said,

00:04:20.106 --> 00:04:24.076 A:middle
that are available, again,
across both OS platforms.

00:04:24.356 --> 00:04:25.936 A:middle
And so let's dive in
to a couple of these.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.836 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about
what you can do with them

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.716 A:middle
and we won't be able to
hit them all but hopefully,

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.716 A:middle
we can give you some
ideas of places

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:34.366 A:middle
where you could start developing

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:35.956 A:middle
and getting some
exciting products going.

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:39.876 A:middle
First up, USB Audio.

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:43.086 A:middle
You access USB Audio
as an app developer

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.346 A:middle
through the Core Audio
Framework that's both

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.276 A:middle
on iOS and OS X again.

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:52.476 A:middle
And, you know, you
can design products

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:56.406 A:middle
that are USB 1 compliant
and we will support them.

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:59.816 A:middle
We'd really recommend you guys
start thinking about USB 2.0

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.906 A:middle
as a standard and that's on the
accessory manufacturing side.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.906 A:middle
as a standard and that's on the
accessory manufacturing side.

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:06.266 A:middle
And that's for both
input and output devices.

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
You know, although you
can support a number

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:14.356 A:middle
of sampling rights on both the
physical device side and the OS,

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.326 A:middle
the application side, we want
to stress that, you know,

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:20.616 A:middle
16-bit when you're
PCM, 32, 4401,

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:23.466 A:middle
48 kilohertz is really the
standard that we focus in on.

00:05:23.716 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
And so we do make
it a requirement

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:28.956 A:middle
of all external accessories to
support those sampling rights

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:31.816 A:middle
and we would suggest as
application manufacturers,

00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:34.776 A:middle
application developers,
you also focus

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:37.126 A:middle
in on supporting those rights
and make sure not to block them

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:38.196 A:middle
from requirement standpoint.

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:41.046 A:middle
You do have access
to multichannel audio

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.346 A:middle
on both sides should
you choose to use it.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.386 A:middle
And then finally, of course,
volume synchronization.

00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:50.536 A:middle
If you adjust the volume on the
OS side or you adjust the volume

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.646 A:middle
on the accessory side, the
two should be synchronized.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.246 A:middle
You should get volume
increases and decreases

00:05:55.496 --> 00:05:57.586 A:middle
as the consumer really sees fit

00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:00.046 A:middle
and that's all available
to you as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:00.046 A:middle
and that's all available
to you as well.

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:02.376 A:middle
So next up, something new.

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:04.716 A:middle
We talked about this
a little bit yesterday

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:06.236 A:middle
and we'll be talking about
it more throughout the week,

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:07.556 A:middle
is game controller.

00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:09.276 A:middle
This, we think, is great.

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.766 A:middle
This is something we're
really excited about.

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:15.186 A:middle
We've decided to standardize
around the concept that iOS

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:19.396 A:middle
and Mavericks should have a
consistent game controller

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:21.126 A:middle
experience that you
can use in both places,

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:23.356 A:middle
and that application
developers can utilize

00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:25.966 A:middle
to create richer,
more immersive games.

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:29.666 A:middle
As you can see, we have a
standard game controller

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:31.966 A:middle
and of course, we
also expand that out

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:33.436 A:middle
to an extended game controller.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:37.056 A:middle
Really, the extended game
controller adds a secondary

00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:40.556 A:middle
trigger button or shoulder
button and some joysticks.

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:44.876 A:middle
And we do have a session
later today actually

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:47.606 A:middle
to talk a little bit more
detail about the hardware

00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:49.536 A:middle
and the software
requirements of that.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.726 A:middle
Also, reference it a little
bit later in this presentation.

00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:54.496 A:middle
But please, if you're
interested in game controller,

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.886 A:middle
come to the labs, go to the
sessions, and really get

00:06:56.886 --> 00:06:58.846 A:middle
to know more about this 'cause
this is something we think is

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:02.946 A:middle
really to make the game space
a great, a better experience

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:02.946 A:middle
really to make the game space
a great, a better experience

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:06.376 A:middle
than it even is today,
and that's hard to create.

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:09.156 A:middle
Okay. So iPod accessory
protocol.

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:11.706 A:middle
We now refer to this
as iAP usually,

00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:13.736 A:middle
and you'll hear us
all slip in to that,

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:16.546 A:middle
so that's what we're referring
to if we talk about it.

00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:20.776 A:middle
And the key here is it's
basically how you access a bunch

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:23.056 A:middle
of the system services on iOS.

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:28.156 A:middle
It's been around since we
introduced the 30-pin dock many

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.726 A:middle
years ago, we've kept it around.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.176 A:middle
We continued to expand it.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.596 A:middle
We continued to think it's
a great way to interface

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:36.906 A:middle
with accessories in
an Apple-specific way.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:40.596 A:middle
We've given you access
to the media library,

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:42.756 A:middle
and what that means is you
can look at all the metadata

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:46.316 A:middle
on the device, organize as
we organize it, and you can--

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:49.476 A:middle
on your accessory side, you
can decide to display it

00:07:49.476 --> 00:07:52.016 A:middle
to your user in a way that
you think makes the most sense

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:54.346 A:middle
to them and allow them to browse

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:56.026 A:middle
and use playback
controls, et cetera.

00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.686 A:middle
Next up, of course,
is the accessory--

00:07:58.736 --> 00:08:02.426 A:middle
external accessory protocol,
EA as we like to call it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.736 --> 00:08:02.426 A:middle
external accessory protocol,
EA as we like to call it.

00:08:02.426 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
It's the best way to have
an application talk directly

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:08.506 A:middle
with your physical accessory
that you decide to design.

00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:10.066 A:middle
And the exciting
part there, I think,

00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:13.476 A:middle
is that we also have app
discovery and app launch.

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:16.186 A:middle
So, if someone goes out
to the store and decides

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:19.126 A:middle
to buy an accessory for the
first time, they plug it

00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:21.156 A:middle
in to their device or they
connect it to their device.

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.046 A:middle
The first thing that
the device does

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:25.366 A:middle
from a system aspect is
ask you, "Do you want

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:26.726 A:middle
to download the app
for this device?"

00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:28.096 A:middle
It's a great feature.

00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:30.226 A:middle
It prevents people from
having to search on the store.

00:08:30.446 --> 00:08:31.646 A:middle
It prevents people
from having to look

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:32.956 A:middle
through the manual, et cetera.

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:35.275 A:middle
And we think people
really enjoy it

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:38.836 A:middle
and we love the way it's working
out and we hope you guys decide

00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:40.645 A:middle
to try and exercise
that a little bit too.

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:43.456 A:middle
The next, location information.

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
You can decide to expand
the location capabilities

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:46.566 A:middle
of your device.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:48.046 A:middle
Finally, accessibility.

00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:51.706 A:middle
Obviously, some people, some
of our customers need some help

00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:55.326 A:middle
in using our devices and we've
made these frameworks available

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.486 A:middle
to you to make sure you
can design accessories

00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
that help them use that
and help everyone enjoy

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
that help them use that
and help everyone enjoy

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:03.626 A:middle
and utilize their iOS
device to its fullest.

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:09.546 A:middle
Many of the technologies
I've been talking about fall

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.036 A:middle
under the MFi Licensing Program.

00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:14.986 A:middle
MFi is made for iPod,
iPhone and iPod.

00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:16.496 A:middle
And what does it include?

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:22.226 A:middle
Well, it's a program that gives
you access to our connectors,

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.436 A:middle
to receive a Lightning
connector.

00:09:24.516 --> 00:09:28.786 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:32.026 A:middle
Our headphone with remote
system which is a great way

00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:36.406 A:middle
to not only listen to the music
and audio from your devices,

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:40.366 A:middle
both on the MAC side
and on the iOS side,

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.506 A:middle
but also allows you
to use the controls.

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:46.366 A:middle
Again, volume controls,
play/pause, all of the things

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:48.686 A:middle
that people are used to
using on a day-to-day basis.

00:09:48.846 --> 00:09:51.976 A:middle
Finally, AirPlay
licensing, we now allow you

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:55.756 A:middle
to create AirPlay accessories
and finally, AirPrint.

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.856 A:middle
And really, the intent
here is to make sure

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:01.366 A:middle
that there's a sense of
quality for the consumer

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:01.366 A:middle
that there's a sense of
quality for the consumer

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
when they go into a store.

00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:05.876 A:middle
We keep the MFi Program
around and we allow the badge

00:10:05.876 --> 00:10:08.496 A:middle
to be used on products
that Apple

00:10:08.496 --> 00:10:10.446 A:middle
and the accessory
manufacturers have worked hard

00:10:10.446 --> 00:10:14.456 A:middle
to guarantee our solid quality
experiences for the consumer.

00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:16.866 A:middle
So, when you go shopping
for an accessory,

00:10:17.186 --> 00:10:19.786 A:middle
you know with confidence
that if I buy this accessory

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.126 A:middle
and take it home, it'll
work with my device today,

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:24.286 A:middle
and it'll also work with
my devices in the future.

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:27.716 A:middle
If you want to join
the MFi Program,

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:30.466 A:middle
we obviously have many
people you can talk

00:10:30.466 --> 00:10:31.596 A:middle
to in the lab sessions today.

00:10:32.886 --> 00:10:34.636 A:middle
We highly encourage
you to chat with us,

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:37.016 A:middle
understand with it's about,
understand what you get.

00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:39.996 A:middle
Some of the highlights, you
get full technical information

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:43.006 A:middle
of how to interface
with our devices.

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:45.896 A:middle
You get access to all the
components, so connectors,

00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:48.866 A:middle
headphone, mic-- and
mic systems, et cetera.

00:10:49.286 --> 00:10:51.616 A:middle
All tools that we
make available as far

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:54.816 A:middle
as developing accessories,
this will help you understand

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:58.046 A:middle
if you're speaking the protocols
properly, if you're electrically

00:10:58.086 --> 00:10:59.986 A:middle
in sync with our specifications.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:03.426 A:middle
And finally, it gives you access
to the product certification

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:06.306 A:middle
and the logos and
compatibility icons

00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:08.116 A:middle
if you pass product
certification.

00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:14.516 A:middle
So that's what I'm going to
do from a high-level overview.

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:16.306 A:middle
Obviously, it's a complex phase.

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:19.046 A:middle
Like I said, we definitely
have many lab sessions

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:21.626 A:middle
that we are more than
happy and willing to talk

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:22.546 A:middle
to you guys about this.

00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:24.436 A:middle
And, you know, I'm just
trying to highlight here

00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:27.176 A:middle
that no matter what
transport you decide to use,

00:11:27.696 --> 00:11:29.426 A:middle
you pretty much have an
option to do some sort

00:11:29.426 --> 00:11:31.966 A:middle
of communication, whether here
it's audio or communication

00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:35.906 A:middle
with apps, there's also a
number of other options we have.

00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:38.056 A:middle
So, hopefully, you guys
are getting inspired,

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:39.286 A:middle
hopefully you guys
are getting excited

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:41.306 A:middle
to make some accessories,
to make some apps that work

00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:45.106 A:middle
with accessories, and we would
really enjoy talking to you.

00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:47.806 A:middle
So, please come along
and ask some questions.

00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:53.846 A:middle
Let's switch gears just a little
bit and let's talk about some

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.706 A:middle
of the advances we have in
specific technology areas.

00:11:56.996 --> 00:12:00.876 A:middle
First up, I'd like to
highlight wireless.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:56.996 --> 00:12:00.876 A:middle
First up, I'd like to
highlight wireless.

00:12:01.356 --> 00:12:03.146 A:middle
We at Apple think wireless
is a great solution,

00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:05.846 A:middle
and wireless includes
both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:09.096 A:middle
and Bluetooth low
energy of course.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:13.816 A:middle
And why we like wireless so
much is that the consumer gets

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
to keep the device in their
pocket or in their hand,

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:17.956 A:middle
and they don't have to worry
about walking over to it

00:12:17.956 --> 00:12:19.416 A:middle
and plugging in it or having a--

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:21.246 A:middle
forgetting it somewhere
and leaving it.

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:23.456 A:middle
They can just walk into the
room where these things exist

00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:25.536 A:middle
and they can start
using it seamlessly,

00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:26.566 A:middle
which we think is great.

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:30.866 A:middle
On the Wi-Fi front, couple

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:32.346 A:middle
of things we think you guys
should be thinking about.

00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:37.226 A:middle
On the software side, definitely
realize that networking sockets

00:12:37.226 --> 00:12:39.046 A:middle
and ports are your friends.

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.266 A:middle
We have great frameworks
for dealing with both.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:42.506 A:middle
They're totally open.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.896 A:middle
You can determine how
you want to speak to

00:12:44.896 --> 00:12:47.226 A:middle
and communicate with
your accessory.

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:50.996 A:middle
And I also highlight that we
have Bonjour, and I'll talk

00:12:50.996 --> 00:12:52.196 A:middle
in some more detail in a minute

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:55.786 A:middle
but Bonjour is really the best
way we think for consumers

00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:59.106 A:middle
to be able to interact with
network devices without having

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:00.516 A:middle
to know the technical
details of them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:00.516 A:middle
to know the technical
details of them.

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:03.376 A:middle
On the hardware front, a couple
of things I want to stress,

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:06.036 A:middle
and I've talked about this
in the past but hopefully,

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.666 A:middle
we can all get on
board with this now.

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.806 A:middle
The Wi-Fi Alliance Certification
is really important

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:11.736 A:middle
in the Wi-Fi space.

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.686 A:middle
It makes sure and ensures
that you have inoperability,

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:19.226 A:middle
it makes sure that when your
customer brings the device,

00:13:19.226 --> 00:13:21.286 A:middle
it's not going to interfere
with other Wi-Fi devices

00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:23.176 A:middle
in their home, and it's
also going to work well

00:13:23.176 --> 00:13:26.046 A:middle
with any brand of
router and any brand

00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:27.766 A:middle
of infrastructures
that they may have.

00:13:29.196 --> 00:13:31.466 A:middle
Dual band operation I think
is also something that we

00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:33.006 A:middle
like to stress and
I realize it's--

00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:35.556 A:middle
it may seem unnecessary
on the accessory front.

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:40.546 A:middle
But we all have more and more
RF interference in our homes.

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:43.996 A:middle
And obviously, everything is
using the 2.4 gigahertz space.

00:13:43.996 --> 00:13:45.246 A:middle
We have Wi-Fi, we
have Bluetooth,

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:47.696 A:middle
we have all these technologies,
ISM unlicensed band.

00:13:48.016 --> 00:13:49.176 A:middle
And so we really
want to encourage you

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:53.776 A:middle
to give the consumer the option
to put both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

00:13:54.246 --> 00:13:57.016 A:middle
into the device so they can use
whatever gives them the best

00:13:57.016 --> 00:14:00.196 A:middle
experience, so, to
avoid audio dropouts

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.016 --> 00:14:00.196 A:middle
experience, so, to
avoid audio dropouts

00:14:00.436 --> 00:14:04.416 A:middle
and communication breakdowns
and the fact that if you walk

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:05.706 A:middle
to one corner of your home

00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:08.006 A:middle
and your neighbor has
a strong Wi-Fi signal,

00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:10.246 A:middle
you may get more
error rate, et cetera.

00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:13.496 A:middle
If you enable the products
with dual band performance,

00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:16.306 A:middle
hopefully, we can avoid that
and we can get to a better place

00:14:16.306 --> 00:14:20.746 A:middle
as far as wireless usability and
enjoinment from our consumers.

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:24.306 A:middle
The final two things are
really on the software front

00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:27.316 A:middle
but they're specifically
targeted towards hardware OEMs.

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:30.006 A:middle
And so, I want to stress
quality of service, WMM,

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.916 A:middle
this is an inherent
part of 802.11n.

00:14:33.296 --> 00:14:34.426 A:middle
You have to certify for it.

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:37.216 A:middle
What I really make sure
is that high bandwidth

00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:39.186 A:middle
and high priority traffic

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:42.046 A:middle
on the network actually gets
the priority it deserves.

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:45.426 A:middle
So, it makes sure that you
avoid network dropouts again,

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:47.566 A:middle
it'll make sure you,
you know, avoid glitches

00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:49.706 A:middle
in your video stream, which
is in your audio stream,

00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:50.956 A:middle
those sorts of things.

00:14:51.396 --> 00:14:53.286 A:middle
And finally, IPv6 versus IPv4.

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:57.556 A:middle
Now that we're entering the
age of the internet of things,

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.986 A:middle
the fact that everything is
connected, we're quickly going

00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:01.426 A:middle
to start running out addresses.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:01.426 A:middle
to start running out addresses.

00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:05.376 A:middle
And so we at Apple, believe
strongly we should all be making

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:08.336 A:middle
the transition over to IPv6
and we encourage you guys

00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:10.106 A:middle
to make sure that you have
the ability to do the same.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:12.126 A:middle
A little bit more on Bonjour.

00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:15.176 A:middle
So, as I mentioned before,

00:15:15.536 --> 00:15:19.586 A:middle
Bonjour is a zero-configuration
networking protocol suite.

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:21.396 A:middle
Really, what it boils down to

00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:25.106 A:middle
from the consumer's perspective
is that use a friendly name.

00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:31.346 A:middle
So, you don't have
192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.326 A:middle
or something identifying
your product.

00:15:33.846 --> 00:15:37.436 A:middle
You name it WAMP or computer
or microphone or something

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.496 A:middle
that means what it
does to the consumer

00:15:40.496 --> 00:15:42.746 A:middle
and the consumer has the
ability to rename that device

00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:44.786 A:middle
and to have the experience
to find that device

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:47.336 A:middle
on their network just by using
the name that they can remember.

00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:48.776 A:middle
We think that's great.

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:53.086 A:middle
No worry about IP addresses,
no worry about URLs, hopefully,

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.276 A:middle
no worry about having to go
to the user manual to find

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:57.466 A:middle
out where to find out
where they should be going

00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:58.336 A:middle
to configure things.

00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:00.966 A:middle
It should just be easy for
them to bring something home,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:00.966 A:middle
It should just be easy for
them to bring something home,

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:03.046 A:middle
put it on their network
and enjoy it

00:16:03.316 --> 00:16:04.376 A:middle
with the name they recognize.

00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:09.106 A:middle
Next up is network
service discovery.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
What this does is
it allows the--

00:16:11.996 --> 00:16:14.376 A:middle
well, allows applications
to filter

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:18.756 A:middle
down what devices the consumer
sees by the actual function

00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:19.576 A:middle
that they want to provide.

00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:24.016 A:middle
So, for example for AirPlay,
we use Bonjour to make sure

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.586 A:middle
to only display those devices

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:28.946 A:middle
that support AirPlay audio
coming to them instead

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.716 A:middle
of showing all the
devices on your network

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:32.756 A:middle
that might perhaps
support something

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:33.506 A:middle
that you're interested in.

00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:36.636 A:middle
By doing this, you give to
your consumer a much targeted,

00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:39.486 A:middle
a much more enjoyable experience
'cause they only see the things

00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:40.996 A:middle
that they need, they
only see the things

00:16:40.996 --> 00:16:43.486 A:middle
that they can use
right now for the type

00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:45.016 A:middle
of things that they want to do.

00:16:45.966 --> 00:16:47.176 A:middle
We believe so strongly in this.

00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:49.196 A:middle
We've actually made
this open source.

00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:52.426 A:middle
It's part of the
mDNSResponder project.

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:55.086 A:middle
You can find it at the
address listed there.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.626 A:middle
We highly encourage you
to go and take a look

00:16:57.626 --> 00:16:59.276 A:middle
and if you have any
more questions

00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:02.476 A:middle
about general functionality,
obviously you can talk to us

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:02.476 A:middle
about general functionality,
obviously you can talk to us

00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:04.685 A:middle
in the accessory labs or I'm
sure you can find someone

00:17:04.685 --> 00:17:06.766 A:middle
in networking labs that can
help talk you through this

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:10.425 A:middle
and give all of our consumers
a better or raw experience.

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:12.656 A:middle
Configuring wi-fi accessories.

00:17:12.846 --> 00:17:15.306 A:middle
You know, I talked about this
need to make sure we get way

00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:20.076 A:middle
from forcing people to go to the
user manual and forcing people

00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:24.415 A:middle
to come home with their device,
set it up, get ready to use it,

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.925 A:middle
only to realize, "Oh
wait, how do I get this

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:28.076 A:middle
on my Wi-Fi infrastructure?"

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:31.016 A:middle
But we took care of
this a couple years back

00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:33.106 A:middle
and we enabled Wi-Fi
information sharing.

00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:35.956 A:middle
What it does is you plug the
accessory into a physical port

00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:38.926 A:middle
or Bluetooth and then it
asks you, "Do you want

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:40.546 A:middle
to share your networking
credentials

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
to your iOS device that's
already on with your accessory?"

00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:45.576 A:middle
Great, perfect.

00:17:45.576 --> 00:17:46.096 A:middle
They can say yes.

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:46.836 A:middle
They can say no.

00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.066 A:middle
Great, it's all configured,
you don't have worry about it.

00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:49.786 A:middle
No manual needed.

00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:55.246 A:middle
However, we did hear from a
few people, wouldn't it be nice

00:17:55.246 --> 00:17:56.626 A:middle
if we didn't have to
include a physical port?

00:17:56.626 --> 00:17:58.716 A:middle
Wouldn't it be nice if you
can do this Wi-Fi-only?

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:01.656 A:middle
Well, we agreed and now you can.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:01.656 A:middle
Well, we agreed and now you can.

00:18:02.636 --> 00:18:05.746 A:middle
So, what I'm showing you
here is a Wi-Fi-only way

00:18:05.746 --> 00:18:07.036 A:middle
to configure your accessories.

00:18:07.846 --> 00:18:09.926 A:middle
Essentially, what happens on
the accessory front is it goes

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:12.546 A:middle
into a software AP mode,
software access point mode.

00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:15.556 A:middle
And we identify it as
non-configured device.

00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:17.916 A:middle
So, up there on the screen,
you can see set up new device.

00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:20.576 A:middle
This is a very similar
system that we've had

00:18:20.576 --> 00:18:21.976 A:middle
for our AirPort products
for a while.

00:18:22.306 --> 00:18:23.366 A:middle
We've just added third parties.

00:18:23.366 --> 00:18:24.706 A:middle
So, you see Thermostat there.

00:18:25.386 --> 00:18:29.136 A:middle
So, if I select Thermostat,
I now get the option

00:18:29.136 --> 00:18:32.486 A:middle
to join the network to my
iOS device that's already on.

00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:35.196 A:middle
I can obviously show
other networks

00:18:35.196 --> 00:18:36.836 A:middle
so I can select a
different network if I like.

00:18:36.836 --> 00:18:38.866 A:middle
And then I can rename it.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:40.866 A:middle
If I click on the name--
accessory name section,

00:18:40.946 --> 00:18:43.236 A:middle
I can decide I want to call it
something other than Thermostat.

00:18:43.546 --> 00:18:45.756 A:middle
I want to call it, you know,
Back Bedroom Thermostat

00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
or Garage Thermostat or
somewhere else that I want it.

00:18:49.256 --> 00:18:52.756 A:middle
Then I click Next,
voila, lo and behold,

00:18:53.516 --> 00:18:56.426 A:middle
we securely transfer all the
networking credentials including

00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:59.566 A:middle
the passwords and anything
else that user may not remember

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.006 A:middle
down to the accessory.

00:19:01.396 --> 00:19:04.826 A:middle
The accessory rejoins the
target network and you're done.

00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:06.916 A:middle
We do have one more thing,

00:19:07.726 --> 00:19:09.286 A:middle
if that accessory
has an application,

00:19:09.446 --> 00:19:12.826 A:middle
we also allow you to-- the
consumer to click on Find

00:19:12.826 --> 00:19:13.806 A:middle
Out for this Accessory.

00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:16.406 A:middle
It will do a search and take
you directly to the App Store

00:19:17.006 --> 00:19:18.866 A:middle
and they can be off on their
way again without having

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.626 A:middle
to open the manual,
without having

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.266 A:middle
to think anymore about it.

00:19:22.826 --> 00:19:25.156 A:middle
Of course, we don't want to
leave Mavericks out of this.

00:19:25.786 --> 00:19:30.646 A:middle
So, we also have the ability
to go up to the Wi-Fi menu,

00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:34.556 A:middle
obviously you see new accessory
up there, same choices,

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:36.166 A:middle
you select Thermostat,

00:19:38.306 --> 00:19:40.576 A:middle
or AirPort updater
program launches.

00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.866 A:middle
You have the ability to
select both of them there.

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:47.456 A:middle
Again, chose your network,
rename if you so please

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:49.826 A:middle
and you're also on
the network there.

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:51.776 A:middle
So, whether you're
using Mavericks

00:19:51.776 --> 00:19:53.126 A:middle
or whether you're using iOS 7,

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.896 A:middle
your consumer now has the
ability to get on to the network

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:57.946 A:middle
in easy way only using Wi-Fi.

00:19:58.076 --> 00:19:58.896 A:middle
We think this is great.

00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
It's going to be part of the MFi
Program and we're super excited

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
It's going to be part of the MFi
Program and we're super excited

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:05.656 A:middle
to have people come and talk to
us about how you implement this.

00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:06.726 A:middle
So please come and talk to us.

00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:09.616 A:middle
Obviously, one of the
great things this pairs

00:20:09.616 --> 00:20:11.456 A:middle
with is AirPlay Audio
and we've talked

00:20:11.456 --> 00:20:12.986 A:middle
about AirPlay Audio a
little bit in the past.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:14.596 A:middle
It's a third-party program.

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:17.416 A:middle
It is part of MFi that allows
you to configure the device

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:21.486 A:middle
and have it be part of
our AirPlay ecosystem

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.696 A:middle
so you can stream audio
to the third-party device.

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:27.956 A:middle
We have audio/video receivers,
speaker docks, television.

00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:31.466 A:middle
We have all sorts of things
in this expansive ecosystem

00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:32.656 A:middle
that allows you to listen

00:20:32.656 --> 00:20:34.686 A:middle
to your music how you
see it fit as a consumer.

00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:37.396 A:middle
But we've had one
little snuck in the past.

00:20:37.396 --> 00:20:39.206 A:middle
It's been a little
restrictive perhaps.

00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:41.126 A:middle
So I'm happy to announce

00:20:41.426 --> 00:20:44.066 A:middle
that we're also transferring
this into a more program.

00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:48.066 A:middle
We're going to look at
essentially enabling all of you

00:20:48.066 --> 00:20:52.546 A:middle
to develop and create
AirPlay accessories

00:20:52.546 --> 00:20:53.876 A:middle
on whatever platform,

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:55.656 A:middle
on whatever hardware
platform you see fit.

00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:59.336 A:middle
It's the same program,
same product definitions,

00:20:59.336 --> 00:21:03.486 A:middle
same feature set, same terms
of compliance, same everything.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.336 --> 00:21:03.486 A:middle
same feature set, same terms
of compliance, same everything.

00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:04.596 A:middle
It's just that now you get

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.056 A:middle
to choose whatever
hardware you would

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:09.206 A:middle
like to enable your AirPlay
accessories and hopefully,

00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:11.466 A:middle
that will give you guys a
little bit more flexibility

00:21:11.766 --> 00:21:13.876 A:middle
and we'll expand that
ecosystem even further.

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:16.796 A:middle
With that, thank you.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.866 A:middle
I'd like to bring in my
colleague, Brian Tucker,

00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:21.426 A:middle
to talk a little bit more
about Bluetooth and some

00:21:21.426 --> 00:21:22.416 A:middle
of the exciting things
we have there.

00:21:22.806 --> 00:21:23.876 A:middle
Thanks guys.

00:21:23.876 --> 00:21:24.406 A:middle
[Applause]

00:21:24.406 --> 00:21:24.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:25.976 A:middle
Thank you, Peter.

00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:30.096 A:middle
My name is Brian Tucker and
I am ultimately responsible

00:21:30.096 --> 00:21:33.436 A:middle
for Bluetooth at Apple
and that includes iOS

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:37.186 A:middle
and now OS X Mavericks.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:42.946 A:middle
And I have an incredible honor,
the guys gave me the opportunity

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:46.016 A:middle
to come up and talk about
what's next for Bluetooth,

00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:48.816 A:middle
what are we doing with
Bluetooth now, what's the state

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:50.096 A:middle
of the union of Bluetooth?

00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:53.166 A:middle
I'm obviously very, very
passionate about this.

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:55.606 A:middle
I've actually had the
opportunity to meet a lot of you

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.616 A:middle
in the audience here today.

00:21:57.986 --> 00:22:00.356 A:middle
We do have a followup
session to this

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.986 --> 00:22:00.356 A:middle
We do have a followup
session to this

00:22:00.356 --> 00:22:04.076 A:middle
that specifically covers Core
Bluetooth in a lot more detail.

00:22:04.446 --> 00:22:08.046 A:middle
And so what I'm going to do in
this session is give you kind

00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:11.946 A:middle
of a sneak peak at some of the
things that we've done specially

00:22:11.946 --> 00:22:15.716 A:middle
in iOS 7 to really take Core
Bluetooth to the next level.

00:22:16.536 --> 00:22:17.996 A:middle
So where's Bluetooth today?

00:22:17.996 --> 00:22:21.636 A:middle
Well, Bluetooth is
over a decade old.

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:24.856 A:middle
In fact, it's about 12
or 13 years old now.

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:27.856 A:middle
Core Bluetooth or Bluetooth
low energy just came

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:30.676 A:middle
in the market a couple of
years ago, three years ago.

00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:33.786 A:middle
This marks our third iteration

00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:36.136 A:middle
of Bluetooth low
energy implementations

00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:38.926 A:middle
in Apple products,
but what's going on?

00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:41.816 A:middle
This last year was crazy.

00:22:42.046 --> 00:22:43.476 A:middle
[laughs] It was nuts.

00:22:43.476 --> 00:22:47.796 A:middle
I mean, one of things that
blew me away is in the SIG,

00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:52.116 A:middle
we saw 451 percent
increase in listed devices

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:53.286 A:middle
for Bluetooth speakers.

00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:54.836 A:middle
I mean that's just nuts.

00:22:54.836 --> 00:22:56.886 A:middle
If you look at the
chart, it kind of grows,

00:22:56.886 --> 00:22:59.216 A:middle
and then last year, it's
just this hockey puck.

00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
And this year is no different.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
And this year is no different.

00:23:01.406 --> 00:23:04.046 A:middle
We're seeing more and
more devices get listed

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:06.716 A:middle
in the classic Bluetooth space.

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:10.336 A:middle
So classic Bluetooth, it
is definitely here to stay.

00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:12.906 A:middle
It is still growing
by leaps and bounds.

00:23:13.116 --> 00:23:14.616 A:middle
We want to continue to improve

00:23:14.616 --> 00:23:16.546 A:middle
that user experience
with customers.

00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:18.166 A:middle
You know, we want to do this

00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:20.716 A:middle
like make AC perform
even better,

00:23:20.906 --> 00:23:24.826 A:middle
perform better coax algorithms,
to improve audio quality

00:23:24.826 --> 00:23:26.356 A:middle
for conversational audio.

00:23:26.726 --> 00:23:29.336 A:middle
All those areas around
Core Bluetooth that are key

00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:32.066 A:middle
to the customer experience,
we want to make better.

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:35.186 A:middle
And what we're doing with you
guys is we're updating our

00:23:35.186 --> 00:23:38.426 A:middle
Bluetooth Guidelines document
to make better suggestions

00:23:38.426 --> 00:23:41.986 A:middle
about how to implement
hands-free and HTTP devices,

00:23:42.226 --> 00:23:46.776 A:middle
as well as make improvements
on [inaudible] in OS X and iOS.

00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:47.596 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:50.396 A:middle
So Bluetooth low
energy, obviously,

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:51.926 A:middle
I just spoke of,
it's pretty new.

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:54.086 A:middle
It's only been around
four, three years.

00:23:54.086 --> 00:23:59.536 A:middle
But what's amazing is in a few
market reports that I've read

00:23:59.536 --> 00:24:01.636 A:middle
and have been provided
to the Bluetooth SIG,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.536 --> 00:24:01.636 A:middle
and have been provided
to the Bluetooth SIG,

00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:05.806 A:middle
we're going to surpass a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices

00:24:05.856 --> 00:24:06.326 A:middle
this year.

00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:08.046 A:middle
That's ridiculous.

00:24:08.386 --> 00:24:12.096 A:middle
A Bluetooth-- a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:14.766 A:middle
with a technology that
realistically has only been

00:24:14.766 --> 00:24:16.076 A:middle
around for a couple of years.

00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:17.736 A:middle
That's insane.

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:20.086 A:middle
So clearly, this
is a huge market

00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:21.416 A:middle
for you guys to step into.

00:24:22.466 --> 00:24:25.666 A:middle
And then finally, and I think
this is pretty important,

00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:29.856 A:middle
is that now every major mobile
OS manufacturer supports

00:24:30.036 --> 00:24:31.136 A:middle
Bluetooth low energy.

00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:34.256 A:middle
So I like to personally
welcome them to the pool,

00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:37.536 A:middle
the water is great,
but this is awesome

00:24:37.536 --> 00:24:40.456 A:middle
because this now gives you
the ability to truly look

00:24:40.456 --> 00:24:43.156 A:middle
at a technology across
the entire spectrum

00:24:43.156 --> 00:24:44.176 A:middle
of mobile devices.

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:48.356 A:middle
So no longer is it just our
play, we're going to continue

00:24:48.356 --> 00:24:49.876 A:middle
to drive this market forward.

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:52.576 A:middle
We're going to continue
to innovate in this space,

00:24:52.576 --> 00:24:54.056 A:middle
but I think it's
important to note

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:57.726 A:middle
that everybody feels the same
way about Bluetooth low energy

00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:00.046 A:middle
that we do, which I think
is really, really cool.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.686 --> 00:26:00.256 A:middle
And we wanted to kind of put
our money where our mouth is.

00:26:00.256 --> 00:26:04.206 A:middle
We wanted to say, "If these
are so important to you guys,

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:06.526 A:middle
if we're saying that
these are super important,

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:09.406 A:middle
then what can we do to
make these even better?"

00:26:10.056 --> 00:26:12.706 A:middle
So, I wanted to highlight a
few of these particular areas.

00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:13.866 A:middle
I'm not going to
through all of these.

00:26:13.866 --> 00:26:14.856 A:middle
I don't have enough time.

00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:18.376 A:middle
But I want to highlight a
few things that we've done

00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:21.006 A:middle
to make some of these user
experiences even better.

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:22.986 A:middle
And the first one I want to
talk about is health care.

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:27.776 A:middle
And like Peter said, health care
is growing by leaps and downs.

00:26:27.776 --> 00:26:29.726 A:middle
If you look at what
we're doing with LE,

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:33.846 A:middle
we're allowing the consumer
to quantify themselves.

00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:36.896 A:middle
I'm not sure I like this
concept called quantify itself,

00:26:36.896 --> 00:26:38.116 A:middle
but the-- or the name.

00:26:38.116 --> 00:26:39.176 A:middle
I love the concept.

00:26:39.176 --> 00:26:40.586 A:middle
And the idea is that you

00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:44.066 A:middle
as a consumer can now
take active control

00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:45.096 A:middle
over your own health care.

00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:47.296 A:middle
You can monitor your
own blood glucose.

00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:48.736 A:middle
You can monitor your
own heart rate.

00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:52.746 A:middle
I saw a product that monitors
your blood glucose level

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:56.656 A:middle
and actually gives you real-time
body chemistry information

00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:57.906 A:middle
as you eat your food.

00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:01.626 A:middle
So, like you can go eat a bagel
and your phone will tell you,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:01.626 A:middle
So, like you can go eat a bagel
and your phone will tell you,

00:27:01.906 --> 00:27:04.356 A:middle
"Dude, your blood sugar level
is spiking, you may not want

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:06.656 A:middle
to have any carbs for lunch,"
you know, kind of thing.

00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:11.226 A:middle
And that's awesome, 'cause now
I can immediately know how the

00:27:11.226 --> 00:27:12.926 A:middle
system is operating, right?

00:27:12.996 --> 00:27:15.646 A:middle
And as an engineer, that's
huge, [inaudible], right?

00:27:15.646 --> 00:27:20.576 A:middle
And if I have data on my body,
I can make the right choices

00:27:20.576 --> 00:27:24.796 A:middle
in real-time as I go out
throughout my day, huge,

00:27:24.796 --> 00:27:27.846 A:middle
huge opportunity
here in this market.

00:27:28.796 --> 00:27:31.446 A:middle
Another area is providing
a better relationship

00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:33.286 A:middle
between the patient
and the care provider,

00:27:33.696 --> 00:27:35.486 A:middle
the nurse practitioner
or your doctor.

00:27:35.956 --> 00:27:39.996 A:middle
And connecting the device
that's on your body with the iOS

00:27:40.156 --> 00:27:42.796 A:middle
or the OS X device
and connecting

00:27:42.796 --> 00:27:44.316 A:middle
that to your doctor directly.

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:48.546 A:middle
So now, the doctor can take
an active role in your life

00:27:48.546 --> 00:27:51.016 A:middle
without you having to be in
the hospital the whole time.

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:55.936 A:middle
And for my parents, especially,
it even gives me the ability

00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:57.776 A:middle
to monitor their
health remotely.

00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:01.846 A:middle
They live in Arizona, I live
in California, it's just peace

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:01.846 A:middle
They live in Arizona, I live
in California, it's just peace

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:04.036 A:middle
of mind, but they
can still continue

00:28:04.036 --> 00:28:05.826 A:middle
to live their lives
the way they want to.

00:28:05.826 --> 00:28:08.226 A:middle
I think that's just huge.

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:10.116 A:middle
It changes the world, right?

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:12.356 A:middle
Another area where
we're kind of--

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:14.686 A:middle
we put our money where
our mouth is this idea

00:28:14.686 --> 00:28:17.946 A:middle
of MFi hearing aids, or
Apple designed hearing aid

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.086 A:middle
audio transport.

00:28:19.946 --> 00:28:24.026 A:middle
Now, about a year and a
half ago, we were looking

00:28:24.026 --> 00:28:25.986 A:middle
at this space and
we're like, you know,

00:28:25.986 --> 00:28:29.806 A:middle
Bluetooth is being used but
the experience is just less

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:30.536 A:middle
than ideal.

00:28:30.806 --> 00:28:32.526 A:middle
You had to wear something
around your neck,

00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:34.366 A:middle
or you had to wear a
thing on your belt,

00:28:34.726 --> 00:28:38.776 A:middle
and it was like Bluetooth
that and magnetic inductance

00:28:38.776 --> 00:28:42.646 A:middle
to your hearing aid, or
you put it up to your ear

00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.176 A:middle
and it just sounded
really crappy.

00:28:44.176 --> 00:28:46.166 A:middle
And we're like, "We
can make this better."

00:28:46.836 --> 00:28:49.526 A:middle
And so, we first started looking
at Bluetooth and like, "No,

00:28:49.756 --> 00:28:51.926 A:middle
that's not going to
work, too much power,

00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:55.326 A:middle
the chips are too
expensive, they're too big."

00:28:55.326 --> 00:28:58.126 A:middle
And then we started
looking at low energy,

00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:00.206 A:middle
and I remember having
conversations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:00.206 A:middle
and I remember having
conversations

00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:03.066 A:middle
with some chip guys and they
literally laughed at us,

00:29:03.066 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
you know, they didn't think
that that is even possible.

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:08.886 A:middle
But we hammered it
and we hammered it,

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:12.006 A:middle
and we came up with
a way to push audio

00:29:12.216 --> 00:29:15.346 A:middle
down to lower energy link,
and this is Apple iP.

00:29:15.346 --> 00:29:18.386 A:middle
And we're enabling the
hearing aid market.

00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:21.556 A:middle
In fact this year, we'll
start seeing hearing aids

00:29:21.556 --> 00:29:25.496 A:middle
on the market using this
technology, and it's crazy tool.

00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:28.806 A:middle
I mean, we'll start to see this
technology in cochlear implants,

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.916 A:middle
where you technically have
an audio linked directly

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.566 A:middle
from your phone into your brain.

00:29:33.816 --> 00:29:36.826 A:middle
I mean, it's just
nutty technology.

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.446 A:middle
And it's also a data pipe.

00:29:38.936 --> 00:29:41.466 A:middle
So, not only that we're
pushing audio to your ears

00:29:41.766 --> 00:29:45.046 A:middle
but the doctor-- you can call
up the doctor, talk to them

00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:48.456 A:middle
on the phone and they can adjust
your hearing aids over the phone

00:29:48.736 --> 00:29:53.136 A:middle
as you're talking to them,
just awesome, awesome stuff.

00:29:53.136 --> 00:29:55.196 A:middle
So this is what I
mean about kind

00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:56.596 A:middle
of putting our money
where our mouth is.

00:29:56.596 --> 00:29:59.116 A:middle
And then finally--
and this is one

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.396 A:middle
of those sneak peeks
I'm giving you based

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.396 A:middle
of those sneak peeks
I'm giving you based

00:30:01.396 --> 00:30:05.056 A:middle
on our Core Bluetooth session,
but this idea of improved--

00:30:05.156 --> 00:30:06.966 A:middle
we improved Core
Bluetooth backgrounding.

00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:12.206 A:middle
So now with app preservation and
restoration, we give the ability

00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:14.976 A:middle
to launch apps in the
background and interact

00:30:14.976 --> 00:30:17.576 A:middle
with Bluetooth low
energy devices regardless

00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:18.976 A:middle
of the state of your
application.

00:30:19.466 --> 00:30:24.376 A:middle
So this gives a whole new
market of interaction especially

00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:28.116 A:middle
in areas of long-term care and
some of the areas I want to talk

00:30:28.116 --> 00:30:28.966 A:middle
about here in a minute.

00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:32.906 A:middle
So sports and fitness
is the next area.

00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:35.846 A:middle
Now sports and fitness seems
to be completely designed

00:30:35.846 --> 00:30:36.936 A:middle
for Bluetooth low energy.

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:40.596 A:middle
Some of the products that
we've seen in the market

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:45.766 A:middle
and the space, the Fitbit Flex,
a Bluetooth low energy product.

00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:46.816 A:middle
This is really cool.

00:30:46.816 --> 00:30:48.466 A:middle
It monitors your activity,

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:50.616 A:middle
but it also monitors
your sleep cycles.

00:30:50.656 --> 00:30:52.516 A:middle
So it tells you how
well you slept,

00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:55.516 A:middle
as well as how sedentary
your life is.

00:30:55.516 --> 00:30:58.016 A:middle
As an engineer, I struggle
with this constantly.

00:30:58.436 --> 00:31:02.816 A:middle
But it says, "Get off your
butt and go exercise."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.436 --> 00:31:02.816 A:middle
But it says, "Get off your
butt and go exercise."

00:31:02.816 --> 00:31:03.676 A:middle
It's a great product.

00:31:04.606 --> 00:31:08.516 A:middle
This is one that I'm especially
excited about with my kids.

00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:11.526 A:middle
This is soccer ball made by
Adidas, the Adidas Smart Ball.

00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:14.846 A:middle
What's cool about this is it
has Bluetooth low energy radio

00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:17.546 A:middle
in the middle and then
sensors that spider

00:31:17.546 --> 00:31:19.366 A:middle
out to the outside of the ball.

00:31:19.366 --> 00:31:21.676 A:middle
It looks like a spider
exploded inside the ball, right?

00:31:21.676 --> 00:31:23.556 A:middle
And it is connected to the ball

00:31:23.556 --> 00:31:25.396 A:middle
and it actually monitors
the activity

00:31:25.396 --> 00:31:28.036 A:middle
of the soccer ball during use.

00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:31.066 A:middle
So it monitors how well
you're passing a ball.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.066 A:middle
How much spin you're
putting on the ball.

00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:36.686 A:middle
In fact, it a has feature
where you take a shot on goal

00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:39.226 A:middle
and if you're looking
particular curve to the shot,

00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:42.876 A:middle
it will monitor that curve
and then compare your shot

00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:46.056 A:middle
against a pro shot and it will
actually tell how well you're

00:31:46.056 --> 00:31:47.526 A:middle
doing against maybe Beckham.

00:31:47.526 --> 00:31:50.766 A:middle
And you want this, that cool,
you know, right to left curve

00:31:50.766 --> 00:31:53.696 A:middle
into the top-right or
top-left corner of the goal.

00:31:53.696 --> 00:31:55.436 A:middle
This ball will let you do that.

00:31:55.436 --> 00:31:59.966 A:middle
So for coaches, this is huge
because it gives you the data.

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:03.166 A:middle
In addition to that in
basketball, there is a product

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:03.166 A:middle
In addition to that in
basketball, there is a product

00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:06.976 A:middle
by 94Fifty, a smart ball that
does very similar things,

00:32:06.976 --> 00:32:08.796 A:middle
but in a basketball space.

00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:12.276 A:middle
You take a shot, it tells
you the rotation of the ball,

00:32:12.506 --> 00:32:15.666 A:middle
it tells you the shot angle
of the ball to the goal,

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:17.036 A:middle
how well you're dribbling.

00:32:17.036 --> 00:32:18.616 A:middle
I mean, it's awesome.

00:32:18.616 --> 00:32:21.146 A:middle
And that somebody like
that's a data junky,

00:32:21.396 --> 00:32:24.096 A:middle
this is just a really, really
great way to get feedback

00:32:24.096 --> 00:32:25.506 A:middle
on how well you're doing,

00:32:25.766 --> 00:32:29.346 A:middle
as well as how well
your athletes are doing

00:32:29.346 --> 00:32:30.116 A:middle
if you're a coach.

00:32:30.526 --> 00:32:31.476 A:middle
Really, really cool.

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:36.686 A:middle
And so, again, we feel like with
iOS 7 in the app preservation,

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:40.086 A:middle
you can now do long-term
accessory interaction.

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.876 A:middle
Now there is a lot to
be talked about in here

00:32:43.026 --> 00:32:45.116 A:middle
and a lot more detail in
the Core Bluetooth session.

00:32:45.426 --> 00:32:48.616 A:middle
Reno [phonetic] and Jason go in
this in great detail and talk

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:51.416 A:middle
about how your apps
can really interact

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:53.826 A:middle
with these devices
long-term always.

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:57.176 A:middle
As long as the phone is with the
consumer, the phone can interact

00:32:57.176 --> 00:32:58.216 A:middle
with these accessories.

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.896 A:middle
So the third thing is security

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.896 A:middle
So the third thing is security

00:33:01.386 --> 00:33:05.326 A:middle
and security is kind
of snuck up on us.

00:33:05.326 --> 00:33:07.056 A:middle
Security has just exploded.

00:33:07.056 --> 00:33:10.686 A:middle
In fact, just recently, we're
starting to see just a ton

00:33:10.686 --> 00:33:16.956 A:middle
of products in the space that
are providing you experiences

00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:20.146 A:middle
around home similar to
the experiences you get

00:33:20.146 --> 00:33:23.646 A:middle
around your car with a
wireless remote or wireless key.

00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:28.516 A:middle
Kwikset Kevo is a similar
product, you walk up,

00:33:28.516 --> 00:33:30.166 A:middle
your phone interacts
with the door,

00:33:30.396 --> 00:33:33.426 A:middle
you touch the door
lock and it unlocks.

00:33:33.426 --> 00:33:37.686 A:middle
This is a Kickstarter,
guys, Lockitron where--

00:33:37.686 --> 00:33:39.676 A:middle
a product where it just
goes over the door lock

00:33:39.676 --> 00:33:43.106 A:middle
and it can open and
unlock the door lock.

00:33:43.106 --> 00:33:45.876 A:middle
And then just recently,
just a couple of weeks ago,

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:48.586 A:middle
a company called August
makes up Smart Lock

00:33:48.836 --> 00:33:51.646 A:middle
that does very similar
things, beautiful product.

00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:54.806 A:middle
One of the things in their video
I thought was really cool is

00:33:54.806 --> 00:33:58.556 A:middle
this idea of being able to
share your key virtually.

00:33:58.946 --> 00:34:01.136 A:middle
So if I want to allow
my plumber, for example,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.946 --> 00:34:01.136 A:middle
So if I want to allow
my plumber, for example,

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:04.056 A:middle
to get in my home,
let's say this Thursday

00:34:04.056 --> 00:34:06.746 A:middle
which I know I'm not going
to be there from 12 to 2,

00:34:07.036 --> 00:34:10.755 A:middle
I can send him my key and say,
"You can get into my home only

00:34:10.755 --> 00:34:12.835 A:middle
from 12 to 2" and
oh, by the way,

00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:15.406 A:middle
when he does enter the
home, his phone tells me

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.235 A:middle
that he entered the
home and left the home.

00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:20.005 A:middle
It's pretty really,
really, really cool stuff.

00:34:20.005 --> 00:34:22.295 A:middle
And, again, we think
state preservation

00:34:22.295 --> 00:34:26.036 A:middle
and restoration is key here
because if the app goes away

00:34:26.036 --> 00:34:28.235 A:middle
or dies, you don't
have the ability

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:30.065 A:middle
to unlock your door, right?

00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:31.835 A:middle
It doesn't interact
with the door

00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:34.025 A:middle
because the app is
no longer there.

00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:37.686 A:middle
And iOS doesn't a have perceived
knowledge of what it means

00:34:37.686 --> 00:34:38.826 A:middle
to interact with the door lock.

00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:42.866 A:middle
So this is really, really,
really key to this product space

00:34:42.866 --> 00:34:46.446 A:middle
and we think that this is going
to just explode this market.

00:34:48.156 --> 00:34:54.235 A:middle
Entertainment, so briefly Peter
covered this, but I just wanted

00:34:54.235 --> 00:34:56.466 A:middle
to cover a couple of
areas where entertainment

00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:58.636 A:middle
and low energy is converging.

00:34:58.746 --> 00:35:01.166 A:middle
Game controller is
obviously an area

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.746 --> 00:35:01.166 A:middle
Game controller is
obviously an area

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.746 A:middle
where Bluetooth low energy
is perfect for this space.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:09.476 A:middle
The small data packet
sizes, the data intervals,

00:35:09.476 --> 00:35:10.836 A:middle
the connection intervals

00:35:10.836 --> 00:35:13.126 A:middle
that you can achieve
just perfectly aligned

00:35:13.126 --> 00:35:14.196 A:middle
with game controllers.

00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:18.106 A:middle
Obviously, keyboards, I'm not
sure keyboards are entertaining,

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:21.706 A:middle
but you can connect to
keyboards maybe to play games

00:35:21.706 --> 00:35:24.216 A:middle
that are a little
bit more complicated,

00:35:24.526 --> 00:35:26.196 A:middle
and then of course,
remote controls.

00:35:26.506 --> 00:35:29.986 A:middle
Like this remote control
potentially can be LE

00:35:29.986 --> 00:35:34.166 A:middle
and probably should be LE given
that this could connect directly

00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:38.466 A:middle
to an iO-- or an Apple product.

00:35:38.466 --> 00:35:40.706 A:middle
So, what have we
done in this space?

00:35:40.706 --> 00:35:44.206 A:middle
Well, now on iOS 7, we
natively support HID

00:35:44.436 --> 00:35:46.086 A:middle
over BLE accessories.

00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:49.686 A:middle
So now, if you make
a BLE keyboard,

00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:55.986 A:middle
you can connect directly to
iOS and to OS X Mavericks.

00:35:56.286 --> 00:35:59.816 A:middle
And what's important to
note here especially, well,

00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:03.156 A:middle
in both platforms is
this is the first time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:03.156 A:middle
in both platforms is
this is the first time

00:36:03.426 --> 00:36:07.276 A:middle
that we have supported
profiles in the LE space.

00:36:07.756 --> 00:36:12.486 A:middle
That means that device
management is now being managed

00:36:12.946 --> 00:36:16.716 A:middle
by the OS, but that doesn't
take away device management

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:17.926 A:middle
from your apps.

00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:20.626 A:middle
So if your apps still want to
discover devices and connect

00:36:20.626 --> 00:36:23.316 A:middle
to them and interact with
them, they can totally do that.

00:36:23.316 --> 00:36:24.346 A:middle
That's totally fine.

00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:29.356 A:middle
But the case of hosted
profiles such as HID over GATT,

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:34.156 A:middle
we now managed those
devices for you.

00:36:34.516 --> 00:36:37.786 A:middle
So we felt like it's a more
of a system level functionally

00:36:37.786 --> 00:36:39.886 A:middle
and we thought it
was important for us

00:36:39.886 --> 00:36:41.566 A:middle
to put this into the product.

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:44.086 A:middle
And then finally, proximity,

00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:47.356 A:middle
and this has been talked
about a little bit.

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:50.556 A:middle
I've had countless
questions, people like,

00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:52.026 A:middle
"What's this iBeacons thing?"

00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:53.576 A:middle
You know, all those
kind of stuff.

00:36:53.576 --> 00:36:55.726 A:middle
So, I wanted to briefly
talk about this.

00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:58.796 A:middle
Some of the areas
where proximity is key,

00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
we already talked
about security,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
we already talked
about security,

00:37:01.206 --> 00:37:05.796 A:middle
advertising the ability
to go into a retail space,

00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:08.666 A:middle
and my phone starts to
interact with that retail space

00:37:08.666 --> 00:37:10.046 A:middle
in an advertising way.

00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:13.096 A:middle
I think Minority Report, but
hopefully not that creepy.

00:37:13.386 --> 00:37:18.676 A:middle
Location services,
obviously, if I'm up--

00:37:18.676 --> 00:37:20.586 A:middle
going up to a statue
[phonetic] and I want

00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:23.136 A:middle
that statue do tell me something
about the points of interest,

00:37:23.406 --> 00:37:24.446 A:middle
that's really interesting.

00:37:24.526 --> 00:37:26.766 A:middle
So what have we done
in this space?

00:37:26.826 --> 00:37:32.926 A:middle
Well, now, natively, we give
you the ability to do this iOS

00:37:32.926 --> 00:37:35.516 A:middle
to iOS built right
within core location.

00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:37.446 A:middle
And this is using
Bluetooth low energy.

00:37:37.446 --> 00:37:40.126 A:middle
We don't make it obvious that
it's using Bluetooth low energy.

00:37:40.126 --> 00:37:44.056 A:middle
But then you have the ability
to engage from consumer

00:37:44.056 --> 00:37:46.406 A:middle
to consumer, iOS
device to iOS device,

00:37:46.456 --> 00:37:47.966 A:middle
these proximity services.

00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:54.716 A:middle
So that's just a few areas that
we've been working on in iOS 7.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:58.766 A:middle
So as a review, these are some
of the new things that we talked

00:37:58.766 --> 00:38:01.746 A:middle
about here, Core Bluetooth
App Preservation Restoration.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.766 --> 00:38:01.746 A:middle
about here, Core Bluetooth
App Preservation Restoration.

00:38:02.056 --> 00:38:04.766 A:middle
I know it's an interesting
name, but it's really cool.

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:05.836 A:middle
Learn about it.

00:38:05.836 --> 00:38:06.936 A:middle
It will change your life.

00:38:07.476 --> 00:38:10.896 A:middle
BLE based proximity services,
we talked about this already.

00:38:11.196 --> 00:38:15.676 A:middle
iOS hosted BLE profiles,
HID over BLE.

00:38:15.676 --> 00:38:16.896 A:middle
That should be HID over GATT.

00:38:16.896 --> 00:38:17.806 A:middle
It was the official name.

00:38:17.806 --> 00:38:20.016 A:middle
And then finally,
hearing aid support

00:38:20.356 --> 00:38:24.096 A:middle
which we think is
hugely profound

00:38:24.096 --> 00:38:27.676 A:middle
and truly does make a difference
in the world which is one

00:38:27.676 --> 00:38:29.856 A:middle
of our mission statements
in wireless software

00:38:30.146 --> 00:38:31.836 A:middle
and we think this fulfills that.

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:34.646 A:middle
Real quick, this is kind
of our state of the union.

00:38:34.936 --> 00:38:38.456 A:middle
This is the classic Bluetooth
protocols and profiles

00:38:38.456 --> 00:38:41.806 A:middle
that we support in OS X.

00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:44.346 A:middle
You can write this
down real quick, no.

00:38:44.346 --> 00:38:47.516 A:middle
These are all available
and visible to you

00:38:47.516 --> 00:38:50.276 A:middle
in the current release
of Mavericks.

00:38:50.606 --> 00:38:54.436 A:middle
And then on the LE side, we
have a couple of new roles

00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:58.566 A:middle
on the LE side and that is
low energy peripheral role.

00:38:58.676 --> 00:39:01.516 A:middle
Apparently, we thought enough
about it to add it twice.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.676 --> 00:39:01.516 A:middle
Apparently, we thought enough
about it to add it twice.

00:39:01.976 --> 00:39:05.676 A:middle
And-- but anyway, we did
give you the ability now

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.956 A:middle
to offer up services in OS X.

00:39:07.956 --> 00:39:12.876 A:middle
And now on the iOS side,
from a Core Bluetooth--

00:39:12.876 --> 00:39:15.836 A:middle
or from a classic Bluetooth
perspective, excuse me,

00:39:15.836 --> 00:39:18.486 A:middle
these are the profiles that
we're currently supporting.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.936 A:middle
Nothing new here, just
a lot of bug fixes

00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:24.046 A:middle
and interrupt ability
changes to make our products,

00:39:24.046 --> 00:39:26.896 A:middle
our devices work better
with your products.

00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:30.286 A:middle
We also continue to support
the iPod accessory protocol

00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:34.916 A:middle
over Bluetooth and that's still
very much an active technology.

00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:37.456 A:middle
I use it every day
when I go to sleep.

00:39:37.826 --> 00:39:41.306 A:middle
And then on the LE side, we have
a couple of new things there.

00:39:41.576 --> 00:39:44.906 A:middle
As I said before, Alert
Navigation Service.

00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:46.326 A:middle
We have this new thing,

00:39:46.586 --> 00:39:49.916 A:middle
brand new called Apple
Notification Center Service.

00:39:50.026 --> 00:39:52.496 A:middle
There is also going to
be documentation posted

00:39:52.496 --> 00:39:55.576 A:middle
to the developer site very,
very soon, hopefully today.

00:39:55.966 --> 00:39:57.916 A:middle
So check it out in
there and a lot

00:39:57.916 --> 00:39:59.416 A:middle
of this information
will be on that.

00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.016 A:middle
And then finally, the
current time service is also

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.016 A:middle
And then finally, the
current time service is also

00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:02.906 A:middle
always available.

00:40:03.056 --> 00:40:06.466 A:middle
So if you have an accessory
and you want that accessory

00:40:06.466 --> 00:40:08.466 A:middle
to use an accurate
schedule or timer,

00:40:08.696 --> 00:40:10.946 A:middle
the timer in the phone is
always available to you.

00:40:11.106 --> 00:40:14.956 A:middle
So hopefully, that was a very
brief informative overview

00:40:14.956 --> 00:40:18.186 A:middle
of where Bluetooth is right
now within our OS products.

00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:21.616 A:middle
So with that, I'd like to
invite up Edwin Foo to run us

00:40:21.616 --> 00:40:23.706 A:middle
through Wired and to
continue our presentation.

00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:24.086 A:middle
Thank you.

00:40:24.196 --> 00:40:27.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right everybody,
so you're still with us.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:31.096 A:middle
Thanks for holding up this
far throughout the talk.

00:40:31.786 --> 00:40:34.756 A:middle
I'm Edwin and I am going to
spend a few minutes talking

00:40:34.756 --> 00:40:38.146 A:middle
with you about some of the Wired
interfaces that are available

00:40:38.266 --> 00:40:41.296 A:middle
to accessory developers
for both iOS devices

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:44.126 A:middle
and Macs running OS X.

00:40:45.756 --> 00:40:47.446 A:middle
Let's start with Thunderbolt.

00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:50.236 A:middle
This has been around
for a while--

00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:51.736 A:middle
a little while now
and it has worked

00:40:51.736 --> 00:40:54.556 A:middle
out really well for
us on the Macs.

00:40:54.796 --> 00:40:57.836 A:middle
Thunderbolt is a high-speed
transport that's capable

00:40:57.836 --> 00:41:01.156 A:middle
of transferring both data and
[inaudible] digital video,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.836 --> 00:41:01.156 A:middle
of transferring both data and
[inaudible] digital video,

00:41:01.156 --> 00:41:06.136 A:middle
namely DisplayPort, at really
high speeds and it can handle--

00:41:06.136 --> 00:41:07.856 A:middle
it can handle, actually
be daisy chained

00:41:08.376 --> 00:41:12.196 A:middle
up to six devices per
port and carry power.

00:41:12.196 --> 00:41:14.666 A:middle
It's a bit of mouthful, but
in short what this means is

00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:19.816 A:middle
that you can have high transfer
speeds, one cable from the Mac

00:41:20.226 --> 00:41:23.136 A:middle
to your Thunderbolt accessory
so there's no messed up cables.

00:41:23.416 --> 00:41:27.456 A:middle
And, of course, once your
users have multiple Thunderbolt

00:41:27.556 --> 00:41:28.736 A:middle
peripherals hooked
up to their Mac,

00:41:29.256 --> 00:41:32.696 A:middle
you still don't have a messed
up cables going from the Mac

00:41:32.696 --> 00:41:34.126 A:middle
to every single Thunderbolt
peripheral.

00:41:36.516 --> 00:41:39.006 A:middle
For applications that require
really, really high speed,

00:41:39.006 --> 00:41:42.476 A:middle
mass storage really
comes to mind as well

00:41:42.476 --> 00:41:43.506 A:middle
as digital video of course.

00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:46.986 A:middle
Thunderbolt is a great choice
and we strongly consider

00:41:47.306 --> 00:41:52.426 A:middle
that you consider using it
in accessories like that.

00:41:54.016 --> 00:41:55.136 A:middle
So how do you get started?

00:41:55.136 --> 00:41:58.456 A:middle
Well, first, there is
a certification program

00:41:58.456 --> 00:41:58.996 A:middle
for Thunderbolt.

00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:01.056 A:middle
And the reason

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:01.056 A:middle
And the reason

00:42:01.056 --> 00:42:02.826 A:middle
that certification
program is there is

00:42:02.826 --> 00:42:06.126 A:middle
that it helps ensure a really
high quality of offerings

00:42:06.126 --> 00:42:08.256 A:middle
to users and customers
out there.

00:42:08.256 --> 00:42:11.596 A:middle
They want to be able to buy
Thunderbolt peripherals,

00:42:11.776 --> 00:42:13.136 A:middle
plug them in, and
just have them work.

00:42:13.676 --> 00:42:17.016 A:middle
And that works in both
directions because it means

00:42:17.016 --> 00:42:19.086 A:middle
that as users and customers
get more comfortable

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:22.696 A:middle
with Thunderbolt and depend on
it more and more, they'll begin

00:42:22.696 --> 00:42:23.526 A:middle
to think less and less

00:42:23.526 --> 00:42:26.856 A:middle
about buying your Thunderbolt
peripherals and wondering

00:42:26.856 --> 00:42:27.676 A:middle
if they'll work with Macs.

00:42:28.266 --> 00:42:30.446 A:middle
For those of you
who are interested

00:42:30.446 --> 00:42:32.416 A:middle
in buying device drivers
for Thunderbolt accessories,

00:42:33.346 --> 00:42:35.966 A:middle
refer to the Thunderbolt
Device Driver Programming Guide

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.466 A:middle
on the Apple Developer website.

00:42:37.766 --> 00:42:42.426 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
talk about USB 3.0.

00:42:43.576 --> 00:42:46.546 A:middle
Most Macs today ship
with USB 3.0 ports.

00:42:46.956 --> 00:42:50.376 A:middle
And like Thunderbolt, USB
ports can also, of course,

00:42:50.376 --> 00:42:54.706 A:middle
provide power up to
900 milliamps of it

00:42:55.146 --> 00:42:58.176 A:middle
to your USB accessories
for power and charging.

00:42:59.516 --> 00:43:02.756 A:middle
USB throughput is
still quite fast,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.516 --> 00:43:02.756 A:middle
USB throughput is
still quite fast,

00:43:03.666 --> 00:43:05.326 A:middle
although not quite
as fast Thunderbolt.

00:43:06.206 --> 00:43:08.006 A:middle
And for those of
you who are thinking

00:43:08.006 --> 00:43:10.166 A:middle
of making USB mass
storage accessories,

00:43:10.576 --> 00:43:12.226 A:middle
we definitely recommend
that instead

00:43:12.226 --> 00:43:14.236 A:middle
of using the USB
Mass Storage Class,

00:43:14.776 --> 00:43:19.106 A:middle
please consider using the
USB Attached SCSI Class.

00:43:20.346 --> 00:43:24.976 A:middle
The performance is much
better and all Macs--

00:43:25.066 --> 00:43:28.316 A:middle
most Macs especially Macs
that will be shipping

00:43:28.316 --> 00:43:30.226 A:middle
with OS X Mavericks
will support this.

00:43:30.576 --> 00:43:33.646 A:middle
And last but not least,
we definitely recommend

00:43:33.646 --> 00:43:35.376 A:middle
that you have your
USB peripherals

00:43:35.786 --> 00:43:38.636 A:middle
and accessories certified
by the USB Integrators Form.

00:43:39.676 --> 00:43:43.166 A:middle
This will guarantee that your
accessories have maximum chance

00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:45.706 A:middle
of working out of the box
without have additional--

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.416 A:middle
install additional
drivers with Macs

00:43:47.456 --> 00:43:49.576 A:middle
and OS X releases down the road.

00:43:50.446 --> 00:43:54.606 A:middle
Next, I'd like to give
brief overview of Lightning.

00:43:54.776 --> 00:43:57.036 A:middle
I don't want to spend
a whole time at it

00:43:57.036 --> 00:44:02.656 A:middle
because we did talk a lot about
Lightning last fall, of course.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.036 --> 00:44:02.656 A:middle
because we did talk a lot about
Lightning last fall, of course.

00:44:02.896 --> 00:44:05.076 A:middle
But to briefly summarize,

00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:08.016 A:middle
the Lightning connector
is all digital interface.

00:44:08.616 --> 00:44:12.246 A:middle
It is completely reversible
so that your users don't need

00:44:12.246 --> 00:44:14.916 A:middle
to worry about which way they're
plugging in your accessory.

00:44:15.866 --> 00:44:17.726 A:middle
And one interesting
thing about Lightning

00:44:17.726 --> 00:44:21.376 A:middle
that may not be very
obvious to most people,

00:44:21.376 --> 00:44:23.376 A:middle
but is actually felt every
single day when you plug

00:44:23.376 --> 00:44:24.196 A:middle
in your phone to charge it,

00:44:24.526 --> 00:44:27.456 A:middle
is that Lightning connectors
have a very positive insertion

00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:28.176 A:middle
and removal feel.

00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:33.356 A:middle
There was no mistaking when
your user has connected their

00:44:33.356 --> 00:44:37.176 A:middle
accessory to a phone, and
likewise, there is no mistaking

00:44:37.176 --> 00:44:38.396 A:middle
when the user is disconnected.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.846 A:middle
It sounds like a purely
mechanical [inaudible]

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.486 A:middle
but it actually is--
contributes greatly

00:44:44.486 --> 00:44:46.916 A:middle
to the overall user experience.

00:44:46.916 --> 00:44:48.866 A:middle
Because if you have, I'm
sure that some of you

00:44:48.866 --> 00:44:50.406 A:middle
in the audience have
had experiences with--

00:44:50.786 --> 00:44:53.756 A:middle
dealing with connectors
that feel a little bit loose

00:44:53.756 --> 00:44:54.796 A:middle
or slipped out and the like,

00:44:54.996 --> 00:44:58.286 A:middle
and that can also sometimes
result in a poor experience.

00:44:58.986 --> 00:45:00.066 A:middle
You won't have that
with Lightning.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.986 --> 00:45:00.066 A:middle
You won't have that
with Lightning.

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:02.866 A:middle
Lightning connectors
just stop by the end

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:03.856 A:middle
and they start working.

00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:06.946 A:middle
Another important
feature of Lighting

00:45:06.946 --> 00:45:10.216 A:middle
which maybe is not
necessarily immediately apparent

00:45:10.216 --> 00:45:12.356 A:middle
to most people is that it
actually provides power

00:45:12.416 --> 00:45:13.306 A:middle
on both directions.

00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:18.186 A:middle
Lightning based accessories do
not just have to provide power

00:45:18.346 --> 00:45:22.876 A:middle
to the Apple devices although
of course we love getting power

00:45:22.876 --> 00:45:24.156 A:middle
so please send us all you can.

00:45:25.636 --> 00:45:28.466 A:middle
But it is also possible to draw
a power from Apple devices.

00:45:28.836 --> 00:45:31.856 A:middle
Now, we do put some limitations
on that and some requirements

00:45:31.856 --> 00:45:34.116 A:middle
because we don't want users

00:45:34.116 --> 00:45:37.316 A:middle
to be wondering why they have
this vampire essentially sucking

00:45:37.316 --> 00:45:38.186 A:middle
power out of their phone.

00:45:38.666 --> 00:45:44.466 A:middle
But for the right categories
of accessories, getting power

00:45:44.466 --> 00:45:46.456 A:middle
from an Apple device is
a very powerful feature.

00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:48.846 A:middle
It means that your accessory
doesn't have to have a battery.

00:45:48.936 --> 00:45:52.266 A:middle
It doesn't have to even have
a power supply at the box

00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:55.126 A:middle
or even a connector for
external power supply.

00:45:55.376 --> 00:45:57.736 A:middle
All you see on the accessory
is the Lightning connector.

00:45:58.486 --> 00:45:59.716 A:middle
The Lightning connector
also has--

00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:01.876 A:middle
is multifaceted in terms
of its data transmission.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:01.876 A:middle
is multifaceted in terms
of its data transmission.

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.916 A:middle
That supports multiple types

00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:08.336 A:middle
of connectivity technologies
starting with USB host,

00:46:08.876 --> 00:46:10.786 A:middle
USB device, and Serial.

00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:15.496 A:middle
Now, the availability of various
accessory interface features

00:46:15.776 --> 00:46:19.406 A:middle
over these transports does
vary based on the transport.

00:46:19.406 --> 00:46:22.876 A:middle
So, we definitely do recommend
that your accessories make use

00:46:22.976 --> 00:46:26.206 A:middle
of the USB host mode
on Apple devices.

00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:27.956 A:middle
And by this, I mean
just be clear

00:46:27.956 --> 00:46:31.646 A:middle
that the Apple device is
playing the role of the USB host

00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:34.546 A:middle
and your accessory
is a USB device.

00:46:35.166 --> 00:46:36.426 A:middle
As you can see here
from the slide,

00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:38.596 A:middle
there are more features
available today

00:46:39.006 --> 00:46:40.406 A:middle
to USB host mode accessories

00:46:40.406 --> 00:46:41.936 A:middle
than to USB device
mode accessories,

00:46:42.856 --> 00:46:44.866 A:middle
and that is definitely
a trend that we expect

00:46:44.866 --> 00:46:46.216 A:middle
to see continuing forward.

00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:49.476 A:middle
We have a left out
Serial though.

00:46:50.146 --> 00:46:54.636 A:middle
Why? Well, Serial interfaces
are really, really simple

00:46:54.636 --> 00:46:58.296 A:middle
to implement and they're very,
very low cost and they're very,

00:46:58.296 --> 00:47:01.566 A:middle
very low power, kind
of going back to why--

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.296 --> 00:47:01.566 A:middle
very low power, kind
of going back to why--

00:47:01.566 --> 00:47:03.566 A:middle
the question about drawing
power from Apple devices.

00:47:03.706 --> 00:47:07.096 A:middle
It's something you
should definitely consider

00:47:07.096 --> 00:47:10.176 A:middle
if your accessory design falls
into that kind of category.

00:47:10.226 --> 00:47:12.956 A:middle
If your data transmission
rate is not too high

00:47:14.076 --> 00:47:19.946 A:middle
and you're drawing power from
an Apple device, you may want

00:47:19.946 --> 00:47:21.196 A:middle
to consider that interface.

00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:24.846 A:middle
I also want to talk briefly

00:47:24.846 --> 00:47:27.426 A:middle
about the headphone
with remote and mic.

00:47:28.236 --> 00:47:31.866 A:middle
One, the most obvious example of
course is the EarPods that comes

00:47:31.866 --> 00:47:32.916 A:middle
in a box of every iPhone.

00:47:35.026 --> 00:47:36.906 A:middle
Accessory headphones that
implement the headphone remote

00:47:36.906 --> 00:47:38.396 A:middle
and mic feature all have

00:47:38.396 --> 00:47:40.286 A:middle
to use a standardized
microphone and transmitter chip.

00:47:40.326 --> 00:47:42.606 A:middle
And what this means
is that they all work

00:47:42.606 --> 00:47:44.986 A:middle
with all iOS devices
and most Macs.

00:47:45.576 --> 00:47:48.226 A:middle
Applications running
on iOS devices

00:47:48.226 --> 00:47:50.516 A:middle
and on Macs can receive events
from the remote control.

00:47:50.816 --> 00:47:52.616 A:middle
So it isn't just limited
to changing the volume

00:47:52.616 --> 00:47:54.436 A:middle
and starting playback
or pausing playback.

00:47:54.946 --> 00:47:59.676 A:middle
And last but not
least, I want to bring

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:02.086 A:middle
up the game controller
feature one more time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:02.086 A:middle
up the game controller
feature one more time

00:48:02.706 --> 00:48:05.466 A:middle
and I'm mentioning
specifically in the context

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:06.776 A:middle
of Wired accessory interfaces

00:48:06.776 --> 00:48:08.106 A:middle
because we're actually
very excited

00:48:08.106 --> 00:48:13.426 A:middle
to consider what possibilities
await for both game developers

00:48:13.596 --> 00:48:15.456 A:middle
and game controller
manufacturers

00:48:15.746 --> 00:48:19.076 A:middle
when you consider the
power of tactile feedback

00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:22.236 A:middle
from the game controller
buttons combined

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:27.116 A:middle
with the multi-touch screen tilt
and driver sensors in an iPhone.

00:48:29.436 --> 00:48:31.026 A:middle
We're really looking forward

00:48:31.026 --> 00:48:34.046 A:middle
to see what creativity
arises from all this.

00:48:34.956 --> 00:48:37.976 A:middle
And not only but the game
controller framework is going

00:48:37.976 --> 00:48:41.206 A:middle
to be standardized so that if
you're making game controllers,

00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:42.226 A:middle
you won't need to worry

00:48:42.226 --> 00:48:44.976 A:middle
about which apps your game
controller is compatible

00:48:44.976 --> 00:48:47.956 A:middle
with 'cause the answer
is all of them.

00:48:47.956 --> 00:48:49.896 A:middle
And we need to go
check the compatibility

00:48:49.896 --> 00:48:51.826 A:middle
with every single app out
there by trying that yourself.

00:48:52.456 --> 00:48:54.956 A:middle
The inverse holds true
for the game developers.

00:48:54.956 --> 00:48:57.976 A:middle
They won't need to have a
closet full of game controllers

00:48:57.976 --> 00:48:59.636 A:middle
that they keep testing
every single time.

For those of you in the
audience who are thinking

00:49:01.666 --> 00:49:02.966 A:middle
about getting involved
with this,

00:49:02.966 --> 00:49:04.796 A:middle
with the controller
manufacturing inside of things,

00:49:05.236 --> 00:49:08.646 A:middle
look for update to the
MFi accessory interface

00:49:08.646 --> 00:49:12.626 A:middle
specification coming soon.

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:16.046 A:middle
So, for more information
about all the technologies

00:49:16.046 --> 00:49:18.346 A:middle
that we talked about
today, definitely,

00:49:18.346 --> 00:49:20.486 A:middle
feel free to contact
any of the three people,

00:49:20.716 --> 00:49:23.666 A:middle
named on this slide in addition

00:49:23.666 --> 00:49:25.906 A:middle
to visiting the Apple
Developer Forums

00:49:26.656 --> 00:49:28.776 A:middle
and contacting Apple
Developer Support.

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:32.116 A:middle
There are a bunch of related
sessions that you may want

00:49:32.116 --> 00:49:33.916 A:middle
to pay attention to as a result

00:49:33.916 --> 00:49:35.526 A:middle
of having heard the
content mentioned here.

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:40.016 A:middle
And with that, that
concludes the session.

00:49:40.326 --> 00:49:40.886 A:middle
Thanks for attending.

00:49:40.951 --> 00:49:42.951 A:middle
