X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.936 A:middle
Welcome to WWDC 2013.

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:07.576 A:middle
The epic ecosystem continues to
thrive for hundreds of millions

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:11.106 A:middle
of users enjoying their
iPhones, iPads and Macs.

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.966 A:middle
This morning, we had
several great announcements

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.696 A:middle
that will make our
users even happier.

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:21.506 A:middle
Starting of course with
iOS 7, the big theme

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:23.936 A:middle
of iOS 7 is its beautiful
new look.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:27.116 A:middle
And it also contains
features like control center

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:29.916 A:middle
and multi-tasking
UI and AirDrop.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:35.156 A:middle
OS X Mavericks is a
very compelling mix

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.196 A:middle
of infrastructure improvements
that lower power consumption,

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:39.396 A:middle
increase responsiveness.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.106 A:middle
Together, let's [inaudible]
user features

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:44.616 A:middle
like margin monitor
support and file tagging

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:47.386 A:middle
and of course our new maps
and iBooks applications.

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:50.826 A:middle
Now, what we didn't
tell you this morning is

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:53.216 A:middle
that we also have big news
on our developer tools.

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.656 A:middle
In addition to our
operating systems,

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:57.646 A:middle
we're also announcing
a major new version

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.976 A:middle
of Xcode today, version 5.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:01.376 A:middle

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:04.763 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.756 A:middle
The most important purpose
of Xcode 5 is of course

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:14.516 A:middle
to let you take advantage
of all the new APIs in iOS 7

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.776 A:middle
and OS X Mavericks, so
that you can get the most

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:17.976 A:middle
out of these operating systems.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:20.966 A:middle
But it also contains
features that will allow you

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.026 A:middle
to create higher quality apps
with a really strong-focus

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.366 A:middle
on testing and debugging.

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:28.596 A:middle
And all of this gets
surfaced in a fresh new look

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:30.506 A:middle
that simplifies the
Xcode experience.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:32.586 A:middle
This is the new Xcode 5.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:35.516 A:middle
Everything is more
compact and clear.

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:39.736 A:middle
With fewer distractions from
your source code, you're going

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.326 A:middle
to see quite a bit about the new
Xcode 5 throughout this session.

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.036 A:middle
But for now, I'm going to focus
a little more on our agenda

00:03:45.036 --> 00:03:46.276 A:middle
with platform ecosystem.

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.046 A:middle
One of the major forces

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.656 A:middle
that prepares our
platforms is the continued

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:56.266 A:middle
and growing success
of our app stores.

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
Just recently, we
crossed this amazing mark

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.016 A:middle
of over 50 billion
app downloads.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.016 A:middle
of over 50 billion
app downloads.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.976 A:middle
And the rate of downloads
start accelerating

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.406 A:middle
because they're constantly
working

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.226 A:middle
on improving our app
store experience.

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:11.026 A:middle
This year, we're making
it easier for users

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.756 A:middle
to discover new apps through
our apps [inaudible] feature

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:16.636 A:middle
which crowd-sources relevant
apps that you might want

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.065 A:middle
to use based on your location.

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.156 A:middle
So for example, you can
find apps that's specific

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.466 A:middle
to a shopping mall
you're entering,

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.086 A:middle
or a sports event you're
attending or an area

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
that you're visiting
as a tourist.

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:31.526 A:middle
You're also significantly
improving our volume purchase

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
program which allows
companies and schools

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.646 A:middle
to initiate mass purchases
of app licenses for both iOS

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.796 A:middle
and Mac and to distribute
those licenses to their users

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:42.496 A:middle
with the help of MDM service.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:46.716 A:middle
And for you developers, we're
improving our purchase receipts.

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:50.136 A:middle
We're now encrypting through
receipts on both platforms,

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.256 A:middle
and via extending the data, you
can access from these receipts.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:56.806 A:middle
The concrete example that is
really useful is if you're

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.336 A:middle
in the process of
moving your app

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.666 A:middle
from a paid app to be a premium.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

from a paid app to be a premium.

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.106 A:middle
In which case, you can
validate with the receipts

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:05.486 A:middle
which users have already
paid in full for these apps

00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:08.156 A:middle
and credit them [inaudible]
app purchases you might want

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:08.926 A:middle
to offer for free.

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:16.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.686 A:middle
So taking it all together,
they are making improvements

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.696 A:middle
for our end users
for enterprises

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.386 A:middle
and schools and for developers.

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.516 A:middle
And all these features
work together

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:27.696 A:middle
to make the app store
experience even more compelling

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:28.786 A:middle
that we're adding

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.906 A:middle
to the business opportunities
they offer to you

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:31.966 A:middle
as third-party developers.

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.956 A:middle
I'd also like to give you a
very brief update on iCloud.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.316 A:middle
iCloud provides a
set of services

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:41.896 A:middle
that integrate seamlessly
with applications

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:45.366 A:middle
so that users can access
their documents, their media,

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:48.106 A:middle
and their app data from any
device they choose to work on.

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:52.106 A:middle
And it's a huge success
for hundreds

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
of millions of users worldwide.

00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:57.896 A:middle
iCloud also offers a
set of developer APIs

00:05:57.896 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
that users can use to integrate
these services with your apps.

00:05:57.896 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
that users can use to integrate
these services with your apps.

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
Now, we understand that there
is one specific area that many

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:06.976 A:middle
of you have struggled
to get to work right.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:10.636 A:middle
And that is our documents in
the Cloud API with core data.

00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:14.166 A:middle
So this is an area
that we have decided

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.036 A:middle
to not implement any new
features this year but instead

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:19.636 A:middle
to focus on reliability
and quality.

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.956 A:middle
We have fixed a ton of
perks in this space.

[ Applause ]

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.516 A:middle
We've also made it
easier for you

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.736 A:middle
to interact with
this technology.

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:36.266 A:middle
We're adding specific iCloud
debugging tools to Xcode 5.

[ Applause ]

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:44.226 A:middle

the key-value store

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.486 A:middle
and the Document API from the
simulator for better testing.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:52.136 A:middle
And in case your users -- in
case if users ever need a way

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:54.736 A:middle
to reset their Cloud data, we
would give them a way to do just

00:06:54.806 --> 00:06:57.066 A:middle
that later this year
on icloud.com.

All right, for the
remainder of this session,

00:07:13.856 --> 00:07:14.586 A:middle
we're going to take a look

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:17.466 A:middle
at how our new products
impact your apps.

00:07:18.106 --> 00:07:19.766 A:middle
You already got a good
idea for what they bring

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:23.066 A:middle
to the table this morning
in the keynote for end users

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:25.266 A:middle
and at this session, they're
going to focus on what they --

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:27.116 A:middle
what this all means
for you as developers.

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:29.916 A:middle
We're going to start
with iOS 7, and for that,

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.656 A:middle
I'm going to bring Toby
Paterson up on stage.

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:43.476 A:middle
We've been working for
quite a while on iOS 7

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:46.316 A:middle
and I'm really excited to
tell you a bit about it today.

00:07:46.316 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
We've got a lot of new
things for you here.

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:51.906 A:middle
Just for fun, we took a
look and counted the number

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:54.356 A:middle
of new symbols in our
public frameworks.

00:07:54.916 --> 00:08:00.936 A:middle
We've got 114 new
classes, 679 new methods

We've got 114 new
classes, 679 new methods

00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:04.076 A:middle
and 917 new properties.

00:08:04.746 --> 00:08:07.096 A:middle
Wow! All right, we'll take
that for what it's worth.

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:08.966 A:middle
But the bottom-line here
is that we've got a lot

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:12.406 A:middle
of new things for
you to dig into.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
Right now though, I want to
talk about just one thing.

00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:21.446 A:middle
The new user interface,
the visual changes

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:23.916 A:middle
that we've made are of course
the most obvious difference.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.906 A:middle
But it goes much
deeper than that.

00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:27.616 A:middle
This is not just a facelift.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.646 A:middle
We broke down all
of our applications

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:34.166 A:middle
and reassembled them,
focusing first on the content

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:36.346 A:middle
and then building the
chrome around that.

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:40.626 A:middle
The result is a fundamental
change to our user experience

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:43.265 A:middle
that will affect
all applications.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.126 A:middle
This is not something
that we undertook lightly.

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.036 A:middle
We took a very serious and
measured approach to this.

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.796 A:middle
And there are three big ideas at
the heart of our redesigned UI.

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:57.776 A:middle
The first of these,
clarity is all

00:08:57.776 --> 00:08:59.346 A:middle
about showing what's relevant.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:03.256 A:middle
It means presenting data to
users in a way that makes sense.

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:06.936 A:middle
Providing features which
are self-explanatory

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:09.796 A:middle
and discoverable and
providing a consistent

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:13.566 A:middle
and cohesive user experience
across your applications.

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:17.916 A:middle
Deference can be
summed up simply

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.166 A:middle
as getting the chrome
out of the way.

00:09:21.286 --> 00:09:24.046 A:middle
Your users care about their
content, their videos,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:25.606 A:middle
their messages, their music.

00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:27.776 A:middle
The user interface
should not compete

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
with that for their attention.

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.986 A:middle
This is perhaps the
most radical change

00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:33.366 A:middle
that we've made in the new UI.

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:36.336 A:middle
And I think that
new understated look

00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:39.886 A:middle
of iOS 7 will really allow the
personality of your applications

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:42.656 A:middle
to shine through far
more than ever before.

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:47.676 A:middle
Now, although we've
simplified the user interface,

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:50.286 A:middle
that doesn't mean
that it's static.

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
iOS 7 has tremendous vitality

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:55.096 A:middle
through the use of
depth and motion.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:59.866 A:middle
Parallax blurs and translucency
take the place of gradients

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.946 A:middle
and shadows and cut-lines in
defining your content areas.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.946 A:middle
and shadows and cut-lines in
defining your content areas.

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:06.296 A:middle
And sophisticated animations
make this perhaps the most

00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:09.216 A:middle
lifelike of the any
iOS release yet.

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:12.426 A:middle
Take a look at the
use of Parallax

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.476 A:middle
on the home screen here.

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:16.906 A:middle
Notice how the background
appears behind the application

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
icons and the badge
appears to float above it.

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.166 A:middle
So what does this mean for you?

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.696 A:middle
There are four things that
you need to pay attention to.

00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:29.456 A:middle
The first of these are changes

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:31.236 A:middle
to the way your content
is laid out.

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
We have some new metrics on
our system controls and buttons

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:39.146 A:middle
and pickers have a new look
and a new behavior about them.

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:41.636 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a quick demo now.

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:44.196 A:middle
I'm going to walk through
some of the applications

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:46.596 A:middle
that Craig showed you this
morning, and just point

00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
out some things that we think
you should pay attention to.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.986 A:middle
Let's go into photos here.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:02.936 A:middle
And right away, you can
see some differences.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:02.936 A:middle
And right away, you can
see some differences.

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:11.316 A:middle
Let's try this one
and there we go.

00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:15.226 A:middle
Okay, let's go into photos here.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:18.146 A:middle
Right away, you can see
some big differences.

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.616 A:middle
Take a look at the bars
at the top and the bottom.

00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:22.856 A:middle
Gone are the gradients
and the shadows

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:25.986 A:middle
and we've got a much more
muted understated look.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:29.666 A:middle
If I drill into some content
here and start scrolling,

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.996 A:middle
take a look closely at the
bars at the top and the bottom.

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:36.346 A:middle
You can see some of your
content just sort of hinting

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.276 A:middle
through the bar there.

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:40.106 A:middle
The bars are partially
translucent

00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:43.726 A:middle
and we put a heavy blur on them
so that the text on the buttons

00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:45.606 A:middle
on your bars remain legible.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:48.816 A:middle
If you take a look at the
buttons in the navigation bar,

00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:51.336 A:middle
the Back button on the left and
the Select button on the right,

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.596 A:middle
you'll notice also that they
don't have any borders anymore.

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:58.166 A:middle
Let me select a couple of
photos here and have a look

00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.166 A:middle
at the buttons at the bottom.

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:01.266 A:middle
They too have no boarders.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:01.266 A:middle
They too have no boarders.

00:12:01.406 --> 00:12:03.826 A:middle
And in fact, you'll notice
that we're starting to use text

00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:06.836 A:middle
in place of icons in some
place for greater clarity.

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:09.566 A:middle
Now this is not something
special to photos.

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:11.976 A:middle
We actually made this change
throughout the system.

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:15.836 A:middle
Let's go into mail now, and
we'll see here a message

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:16.856 A:middle
that I was reading earlier.

00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:20.096 A:middle
As I scroll up, you can
see the content showing

00:12:20.096 --> 00:12:21.116 A:middle
through the bars as well.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.726 A:middle
And here too the
buttons have no borders.

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:27.136 A:middle
Now, this begs a very important
question, how is the user meant

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:27.906 A:middle
to know what to tap on?

00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:31.946 A:middle
Well, we're using color in place
of borders to indicate things

00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:34.746 A:middle
that are tappable or can
otherwise be interacted with.

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:37.666 A:middle
In the case of mail
here, the color is blue

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.176 A:middle
but every application
has its own personality.

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.216 A:middle
And so you can tailor
the tint color

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:43.906 A:middle
to your application's theme.

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.396 A:middle
Let's go back up to
the message list.

00:12:46.396 --> 00:12:48.056 A:middle
There's one more thing
I want to show you here.

00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:51.506 A:middle
I'm going to swipe on a message
and tap the More button to bring

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:53.966 A:middle
up the action sheet, and
take a look at the buttons

00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:55.446 A:middle
up in the navigation bar now.

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:57.546 A:middle
You'll notice that
they've lost their color

00:12:58.246 --> 00:12:59.876 A:middle
because of course
I can't tap on them

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:01.116 A:middle
because the action sheet is up.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:01.116 A:middle
because the action sheet is up.

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.526 A:middle
If I just missed the action
sheet, the color goes away.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:07.666 A:middle
And this is not just a
simple dimming effect.

00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:10.996 A:middle
We're actually desaturating the
tint color of the control there.

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:12.856 A:middle
What's happening
under the covers is

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:16.136 A:middle
that UIKit is changing the tint
color on the inactive controls

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:17.906 A:middle
and posting a notification.

00:13:18.436 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
You can listen for that
notification in your app

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:23.526 A:middle
so that you can update the color
of your controls accordingly.

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:26.706 A:middle
And I have a small
confession to make.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.776 A:middle
My eyes aren't what they used
to be and I'm having a bit

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:31.456 A:middle
of trouble reading
the text in mail here.

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:34.336 A:middle
So, I want to show you a
new text-sizing feature

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:35.896 A:middle
that we've added to iOS 7.

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:38.346 A:middle
I'm going to switch
into settings here

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:40.166 A:middle
and you can see right here.

00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:43.096 A:middle
This is a great example of the
new group style Table View.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:46.106 A:middle
This is the case where we've
changed some of the metrics.

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:49.156 A:middle
You'll notice the cells are
now going edge-to-edge instead

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:51.346 A:middle
of being inset into
rounded racks.

00:13:52.496 --> 00:13:55.386 A:middle
Let's drill into general
and text size and you'll see

00:13:55.386 --> 00:13:56.566 A:middle
that I've got a slider here.

00:13:56.736 --> 00:14:00.466 A:middle
I can drag it to the left to
make text smaller or drag it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.736 --> 00:14:00.466 A:middle
I can drag it to the left to
make text smaller or drag it

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.006 A:middle
to the right to make text
larger in applications

00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:04.256 A:middle
which adopted this feature.

00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:07.066 A:middle
I'm going to leave it on the
right in the largest setting

00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:09.566 A:middle
and switch back through
multi-tasking to mail.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.176 A:middle
And you can see that mail is
now using a much larger font

00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:15.936 A:middle
and it's also adapted to
the layout of the cells

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.886 A:middle
to accommodate the larger text.

00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:20.856 A:middle
This is a place where I think
Auto Layout Constraints are

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:23.886 A:middle
really going to help you in your
application with this feature.

00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:26.976 A:middle
Now, I'm having so
much fun up here

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:29.256 A:middle
that I worry the session
may go a little bit late.

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:31.556 A:middle
Let's check the calendar
and see if that's going

00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
to cause any problems.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.886 A:middle
Sure enough, we've got the
Apple Design Awards coming

00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:36.776 A:middle
up a little bit later.

00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:38.646 A:middle
We better do something
about that.

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:43.556 A:middle
I'm going to tap into the awards
event and edit it and I'm going

00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:46.036 A:middle
to tap on the start time here
to push it back a little.

00:14:46.696 --> 00:14:48.386 A:middle
Notice how the picker slides

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:50.466 A:middle
or notice how the
Table View slides open

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:51.686 A:middle
to reveal the new picker.

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:55.306 A:middle
Once I've changed the time to
push it back or we don't need

00:14:55.306 --> 00:14:57.146 A:middle
to go to 6, I think
5 will be fine.

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
I'm going to tap the Start
Time to accept my action

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
I'm going to tap the Start
Time to accept my action

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:04.466 A:middle
and the Table View slides
closed to hide the picker.

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:07.566 A:middle
This is a new way of using
pickers which will take a bit

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:09.286 A:middle
of work in your code to adopt it

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:11.896 A:middle
but I think the result
is a much lighter weight,

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.556 A:middle
easier to use control.

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:16.296 A:middle
Okay, let's go back
to the slides now.

00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:18.946 A:middle
I want to recap briefly some

00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:20.226 A:middle
of the things we've
just talked about.

00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:27.586 A:middle
So first, your content
needs to go full screen now.

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:30.736 A:middle
We've always had
translucent bars in UIKit.

00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:34.606 A:middle
The difference now is that
all bars are translucent all

00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:34.996 A:middle
the time.

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:39.566 A:middle
If your content is in the scroll
view, we can dynamically resize

00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:43.336 A:middle
that and set the content
insets appropriately for you.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:45.626 A:middle
If your content isn't
in a scroll view,

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:47.836 A:middle
you'll have to do a
little bit of work

00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:49.286 A:middle
to adopt for the new layout.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:55.106 A:middle
Buttons have no borders anymore
whether you're using a UI button

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:58.056 A:middle
with a now horribly misnamed
bordered bar button item.

00:15:58.476 --> 00:15:59.446 A:middle
The borders are gone.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:05.556 A:middle
And we're using tint
color to indicate things

00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:07.836 A:middle
that can now be interacted
with or tapped on.

00:16:08.356 --> 00:16:12.596 A:middle
Group style Table Views and
some of our new controls or some

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.256 A:middle
of our controls have
new metrics.

00:16:14.826 --> 00:16:17.926 A:middle
Now, we tried very hard to
minimize the number of places

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:19.866 A:middle
where we did this because
we're fully cognizant

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:22.996 A:middle
of the impact this will have in
the layout of our application.

00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:25.026 A:middle
Those places where we did do it,

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.526 A:middle
we felt were absolutely
essential

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:28.626 A:middle
to the goals of the
redesigned UI.

00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:33.696 A:middle
And finally, a new way
of using pickers in line.

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:38.926 A:middle
So those are some of the things
that have change in UIKit.

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:41.736 A:middle
The thing to bear in
mind is the vast majority

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.096 A:middle
of the kit remains the same.

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:46.566 A:middle
I'd like to talk a little
bit now about some new things

00:16:46.566 --> 00:16:48.276 A:middle
that we've added to help you

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:51.396 A:middle
in your applications adopt
the new principles of design.

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:54.716 A:middle
Let's start with typography.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:59.676 A:middle
Retina devices permit this
incredible quality of text.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:02.806 A:middle
What's been missing are some
of the more advanced ideas

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:06.816 A:middle
in typography that come from
the printed publishing world.

00:17:07.976 --> 00:17:11.215 A:middle
The first of these are kerning
and ligatures which we turned

00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:15.136 A:middle
on by default in text throughout
the system whether using UIKit

00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:16.326 A:middle
or WebKit.

00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
Now, for those of you wondering
what kerning and ligatures mean,

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:25.455 A:middle
kerning is when two letters
overlap each other such as the T

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:27.136 A:middle
and the R at the
start of truffle.

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:31.296 A:middle
And ligatures tie letters
together such as the F, F,

00:17:31.296 --> 00:17:32.776 A:middle
and L at the end of the word.

00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:36.846 A:middle
This might strike some of you
as a rather esoteric point.

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:39.006 A:middle
But it's one of those
little details that we

00:17:39.006 --> 00:17:40.636 A:middle
at Apple find so important.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:44.306 A:middle
I think the result is text
that's much more legible

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.306 A:middle
and frankly more beautiful.

00:17:47.356 --> 00:17:49.636 A:middle
We even support some of
the more extreme cases

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.636 A:middle
out there such as Zapfino.

00:17:52.186 --> 00:17:55.646 A:middle
Another thing that
we've added is a new way

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.106 A:middle
of working with the system font.

00:17:57.706 --> 00:18:00.846 A:middle
Instead of a single
one-type-fits-all system font,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.706 --> 00:18:00.846 A:middle
Instead of a single
one-type-fits-all system font,

00:18:01.176 --> 00:18:03.866 A:middle
we've introduced a family of
fonts that are being chosen

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:06.166 A:middle
by our designers to work
well with each other.

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:09.616 A:middle
We looked at text across
all of our applications

00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:11.836 A:middle
and classified them
into a series

00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:14.376 A:middle
of usage categories or styles.

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:17.866 A:middle
And for each of those styles,
we chose a specific font

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:21.256 A:middle
and size relative to each other.

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:24.266 A:middle
Now typically, if you wanted
to present more information

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.216 A:middle
on the line or make
text more readable,

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:28.106 A:middle
you would just scale
the font down

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:29.686 A:middle
or scale it up appropriately.

00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:33.716 A:middle
The problem with that is that it
can leave text very hard to read

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:36.526 A:middle
at the smaller sizes or
your letters can be big

00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:38.466 A:middle
and blocky at the larger sizes.

00:18:38.816 --> 00:18:41.446 A:middle
So, we're introducing a
new way of sizing text.

00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:43.886 A:middle
You saw me demonstrate
this in mail just now.

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:47.526 A:middle
We actually changed the
stroke width and the character

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:51.286 A:middle
in the line spacing of text
at each of the relative sizes.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:55.776 A:middle
There's a new API on UIKit
that were turned use --

00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:59.496 A:middle
the specific font to use
for a given size and style.

00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
And WebKit makes
this available to you

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
And WebKit makes
this available to you

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.746 A:middle
through the use of
CSS font values.

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.966 A:middle
We're calling this dynamic type.

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:10.996 A:middle
It's a very -- we think it's
a very advanced typography,

00:19:11.186 --> 00:19:13.186 A:middle
set of typography features
that we're giving to you

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:14.636 A:middle
in a mobile operating system.

00:19:14.996 --> 00:19:16.006 A:middle
We think it's pretty cool.

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:20.256 A:middle
Another thing that
we've added is Text Kit.

00:19:21.336 --> 00:19:24.836 A:middle
Text Kit is an advanced text
and layout rendering engine.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.556 A:middle
It's a great compliment
to WebKit for those times

00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:32.156 A:middle
where you want to use code to
control the layout of your text.

00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.896 A:middle
We took the Cocoa Text
technology from OS X

00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:39.666 A:middle
and brought it to iOS in the
form of a new set of APIs.

00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:41.516 A:middle
Those of you who are familiar

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:44.796 A:middle
with Cocoa Text will have
no problem using these APIs.

00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:46.996 A:middle
For the most part,
they're the same.

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.016 A:middle
And that's it for text.

00:19:50.726 --> 00:19:53.206 A:middle
Let's talk about animations now.

00:19:53.576 --> 00:19:56.906 A:middle
There are generally three ways
that we sort of group animations

00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:57.916 A:middle
when we talk about them.

00:19:58.536 --> 00:20:00.376 A:middle
Transitions are canned
animations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.536 --> 00:20:00.376 A:middle
Transitions are canned
animations

00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:02.376 A:middle
between your view
controllers, for example.

00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:07.406 A:middle
Motion effects tie animations
to the movement of the device.

00:20:07.836 --> 00:20:11.306 A:middle
And dynamics are animations
that interact with the user.

00:20:12.176 --> 00:20:13.276 A:middle
Let's dig into these a little.

00:20:14.706 --> 00:20:17.206 A:middle
So out of the box, we
write a standard set

00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:18.856 A:middle
of view controller transitions.

00:20:18.856 --> 00:20:20.346 A:middle
Your view slide up
from the bottom

00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
when you present them
modally or from right to left

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:25.206 A:middle
when you push them on to
a navigation controller.

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
Well, we're opening
that up to you now

00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:30.646 A:middle
so that you can define your own
animations for a transition.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.286 A:middle
If you want to flip your
view around when you push it

00:20:33.286 --> 00:20:35.486 A:middle
on to a navigation
controller, for example.

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:39.196 A:middle
We're also making it easy for
you to tie your animations

00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:43.406 A:middle
to the system transition so that
you can animate alongside one

00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:45.776 A:middle
of the system transitions
or kick off a set

00:20:45.776 --> 00:20:49.726 A:middle
of animations at the end.

00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:52.346 A:middle
UI motion effects.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:56.836 A:middle
So as I said before,
motion effects tie movement

00:20:56.936 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
of the device to
changes in your UI.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:56.936 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
of the device to
changes in your UI.

00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
You're familiar with
core motion.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:05.026 A:middle
Well we took that and packaged
it up in an easy to use API,

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:07.346 A:middle
that we're calling
UIMotionEffects.

00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:10.056 A:middle
We take the event
string from core motion

00:21:10.056 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
and we crunch the numbers and
convert that into a series

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.286 A:middle
of perspective changes.

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.826 A:middle
We then feature those
perspective changes

00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:19.226 A:middle
so that you can adapt
your UI accordingly.

00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.726 A:middle
This is how we implement
the Parallax effect

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:25.056 A:middle
on the Home screen and
the new tab UI in Safari.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:31.226 A:middle
And finally, I'd like to talk
a bit about UIKit dynamics.

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:35.236 A:middle
I asked one of my engineers for
a succinct description of this,

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:37.196 A:middle
and he's a smart guy, a doctor.

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:38.386 A:middle
And this is what he told me.

00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.106 A:middle
I had to think about this
one for a little bit.

00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:43.476 A:middle
And I think I can sum it up
a little more simply for you.

00:21:44.196 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
We built a physics
engine into UIKit.

00:21:48.856 --> 00:21:51.976 A:middle
So the idea is that the
physics engine deals in terms

00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:55.166 A:middle
of real world type behaviors
-- collisions, gravity,

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.346 A:middle
forces, that kind of thing.

00:21:57.586 --> 00:22:00.886 A:middle
You associate a set of behaviors
with using your hierarchy.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.586 --> 00:22:00.886 A:middle
You associate a set of behaviors
with using your hierarchy.

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:04.216 A:middle
And as the physics engine
runs, it updates properties

00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:06.906 A:middle
on your views and changing
that frame orientation.

00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:10.546 A:middle
Conversely, if you change
properties on your view, say,

00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:13.436 A:middle
in response to the user
swiping across the screen,

00:22:13.976 --> 00:22:16.996 A:middle
we feed those back into the
physics engine and it runs

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:19.416 A:middle
until -- I'm sorry, it runs

00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:21.046 A:middle
until it come back
to an equilibrium.

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:24.546 A:middle
This is a super powerful
system that lets you --

00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:27.986 A:middle
makes it very easy to compose
sophisticated interactions

00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:28.716 A:middle
with users.

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:31.056 A:middle
That's what we call
UIKitDynamics.

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:35.546 A:middle
Let's talk about
images a little bit.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.776 A:middle
In the beginning, it
was really simple.

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:41.916 A:middle
You created your image, you gave
it a name, and you looked it up.

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:46.186 A:middle
Well then we added iPad
and we needed a way

00:22:46.186 --> 00:22:49.106 A:middle
of differentiating your iPad
art from your iPhone art.

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:52.396 A:middle
And so we came up with a clever
way of mangling the filename.

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:56.886 A:middle
Well then we added Retina
iPhones and we need a new way

00:22:56.886 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
of differentiating your iPhone
high-res art from your 1x art.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:56.886 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
of differentiating your iPhone
high-res art from your 1x art.

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:04.126 A:middle
And then we added
Retina iPad, so frankly,

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:05.756 A:middle
it all just start
getting out of control.

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:08.666 A:middle
We were running out of ways
of mangling your filenames.

00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
With iOS 7, we are
ending the insanity.

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:20.066 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:23.916 A:middle
We've got a great new UI in
Xcode that makes it really easy

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:24.966 A:middle
to manage your images.

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:28.106 A:middle
You can tell at a glance if
you're missing some Retina art,

00:23:28.186 --> 00:23:30.946 A:middle
and we've integrated
this tightly with UIKit.

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
You still look up your
images the same way

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.816 A:middle
that you've been
doing it for years,

00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:36.676 A:middle
and it's a little
bit faster to boot.

00:23:36.926 --> 00:23:40.316 A:middle
I'd like to invite Max Drukman
on stage now to give you a demo

00:23:40.316 --> 00:23:42.936 A:middle
of this and some other cool
new features in Xcode 5.

Welcome to Xcode 5.

00:23:55.746 --> 00:23:59.156 A:middle
Now as Andreas told you, Xcode
5 is much cleaner and lighter

00:23:59.506 --> 00:24:00.826 A:middle
and does a really good job

and does a really good job

00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
of keeping your content
front and center.

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:05.436 A:middle
You'll see a lot more of
Xcode 5 in this session,

00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:07.436 A:middle
but for right now, I'm
going to talk to you

00:24:07.436 --> 00:24:11.506 A:middle
about two new features, Asset
Catalogs, that's the feature

00:24:11.506 --> 00:24:13.776 A:middle
that gets rid of that
naming convention for you,

00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:17.406 A:middle
and the totally revamped
Auto Layout.

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:19.146 A:middle
Let's have a look.

00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:21.626 A:middle
Here's a game project
I'm working on.

00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:26.376 A:middle
I'm going to dive right
in to the intro screen.

00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:28.346 A:middle
Here I have a couple of buttons

00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:31.126 A:middle
and it's fairly typical
in a game project.

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:35.186 A:middle
I'm using UIKit buttons but I'm
styling them with custom art.

00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:37.996 A:middle
Since there are only two
buttons on this screen,

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:40.186 A:middle
I think I'll make
them as big as I can.

00:24:40.186 --> 00:24:42.996 A:middle
And I'm going to push
them over to the side

00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:45.696 A:middle
and I'll make this one
really, really wide.

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:51.936 A:middle
And here we see that's one of
the pitfalls of using custom art

00:24:51.936 --> 00:24:53.076 A:middle
with a scalable button.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:24:57.816 A:middle
I made my button big but my
artwork got all distorted.

00:24:58.756 --> 00:25:02.136 A:middle
Now, I know what most of you are
already saying to yourselves,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.756 --> 00:25:02.136 A:middle
Now, I know what most of you are
already saying to yourselves,

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:03.476 A:middle
I know how to fix that problem.

00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:06.576 A:middle
You need to get art that's
sliced into three parts.

00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:11.536 A:middle
Well, you're absolutely right
and I appreciate you bringing

00:25:11.536 --> 00:25:14.756 A:middle
that up because it gives me
just the segue way I need

00:25:14.876 --> 00:25:16.986 A:middle
to start talking
about Asset Catalogs.

00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:21.936 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to the
Asset Catalog in my project.

00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:23.476 A:middle
And here we are.

00:25:24.286 --> 00:25:27.566 A:middle
On the left is an outline
with all of the visual assets

00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:31.366 A:middle
of my project and on the
right, there's a thumbnail view

00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
that keeps all of my assets
and their variants organized.

00:25:35.946 --> 00:25:40.696 A:middle
Here we can see the background
of the screen I was just on,

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:44.426 A:middle
that sort of lime color, with
both the 1x and 2x variants.

00:25:45.696 --> 00:25:49.466 A:middle
The next screen over, the sort
of stone color, also 1x and 2x.

00:25:50.186 --> 00:25:52.806 A:middle
And even my app icon
and launch images

00:25:53.146 --> 00:25:56.216 A:middle
with their five representations.

00:25:56.916 --> 00:25:57.406 A:middle
That's right.

As Toby told you, gone
are the days of the -427K

at 1x twiddle i something.

00:26:06.696 --> 00:26:09.846 A:middle
Naming convention, now we
can all go back to the foo,

00:26:09.846 --> 00:26:12.886 A:middle
bar and baz convention
that we all love so well,

00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:18.466 A:middle
or no convention at all because
the Asset Catalog keeps your

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:20.596 A:middle
image reps organized for you,

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:23.346 A:middle
it doesn't really matter what
you name your images anymore.

00:26:23.906 --> 00:26:26.556 A:middle
Let's go back to
my orange buttons.

00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:29.606 A:middle
Now as we know, we need
these in three parts.

00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:33.616 A:middle
Well, one of the features
of the asset catalog editor

00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:37.946 A:middle
in Xcode 5 is that you can
now do slicing right in Xcode.

00:26:38.516 --> 00:26:42.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:43.186 A:middle
That's right.

00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:47.736 A:middle
I'm going to click the Show
Slicing button down here

00:26:47.736 --> 00:26:48.726 A:middle
in the bottom of the editor.

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:53.946 A:middle
And here we see the
slicing UI with the 1x

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:57.986 A:middle
and 2x representations of my art
blown up so we can see pixels.

00:26:58.846 --> 00:27:00.536 A:middle
I can even zoom in
a little more.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

I can even zoom in
a little more.

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.376 A:middle
Now, all I need to do is
click the Start Slicing button

00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:06.356 A:middle
and I'm given three choices.

00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.366 A:middle
I can slice in three parts

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:12.816 A:middle
so that my image can scale
horizontally, or in three parts

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:17.956 A:middle
so it can scale vertically,
or of course in nine parts

00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:20.876 A:middle
so that it can scale both
horizontally and vertically.

00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:22.566 A:middle
Somebody out there wins a prize.

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:26.026 A:middle
I only need mine to
scale horizontally,

00:27:26.026 --> 00:27:27.246 A:middle
so I'm going to choose that.

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:32.816 A:middle
Now, Xcode analyzed my image
and found the best place

00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:34.716 A:middle
to put the slice points.

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:39.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:45.786 A:middle
So I have a left cap, a right
cap, and one pixel of stretch.

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:47.936 A:middle
The grayed out area
won't be used.

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:50.296 A:middle
Now, of course, you can
make your own decisions

00:27:50.296 --> 00:27:52.326 A:middle
and change the width of
the caps if you want.

00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:55.786 A:middle
You can even change the
width of the center portion

00:27:55.786 --> 00:27:58.736 A:middle
and it will repeat
rather than stretch.

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:03.976 A:middle
But I like what Xcode gave me,
so I'm going to slice the 1x

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:03.976 A:middle
But I like what Xcode gave me,
so I'm going to slice the 1x

00:28:03.976 --> 00:28:05.226 A:middle
in exactly the same way.

00:28:05.886 --> 00:28:09.436 A:middle
And now, when I use the back
button to go to my story board,

00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:12.166 A:middle
my art is doing the right thing.

00:28:13.516 --> 00:28:20.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:23.146 A:middle
And now, even when I
scale the other one,

00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:24.746 A:middle
everything is looking great.

00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:27.896 A:middle
Now, let's talk about
Auto Layout.

00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:31.116 A:middle
Obviously, I'm designing
my interface

00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:32.536 A:middle
in the landscape orientation.

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:36.446 A:middle
But what happens when my
user rotates her device

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.956 A:middle
to see it in portrait?

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.596 A:middle
I need to know what
my interface is going

00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:43.006 A:middle
to do when that happens.

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:46.906 A:middle
Now, of course, I can
run my app in a simulator

00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:48.416 A:middle
or run a device if
I have one handy.

00:28:49.206 --> 00:28:51.766 A:middle
But we've made it
even easier in Xcode 5

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:55.056 A:middle
because we've added
a preview assistant.

00:28:56.506 --> 00:28:59.746 A:middle
The preview assistant allows
you to look at your story boards

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:02.486 A:middle
under different visual
conditions.

00:29:03.486 --> 00:29:06.056 A:middle
So here, I'm designing
in landscape,

00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:08.276 A:middle
but previewing in portrait.

00:29:08.896 --> 00:29:12.156 A:middle
I can essentially design in
two orientations at once now.

00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:17.186 A:middle
And you can see that I have
an Auto Layout problem.

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:22.046 A:middle
Of course, these demos always
start with a problem, right?

00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:26.386 A:middle
Now, notice that my buttons are
clipped off and they're kind

00:29:26.386 --> 00:29:27.816 A:middle
of floating in the
center somewhere.

00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:33.406 A:middle
But my background and
the logo of my game,

00:29:33.816 --> 00:29:35.216 A:middle
they're actually
doing the right thing.

00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:37.936 A:middle
That's because of a
big change we've made

00:29:37.936 --> 00:29:39.516 A:middle
to Auto Layout in Xcode 5.

00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:42.216 A:middle
Now while you're working
with your interfaces,

00:29:42.546 --> 00:29:45.946 A:middle
you no longer need to have
every object constrained.

[ Applause ]

00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:50.436 A:middle
Yeah, that's got to
be worth something.

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:54.896 A:middle
It makes it really easy
to work iteratively

00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:57.006 A:middle
through your interfaces
without Auto Layout,

00:29:57.076 --> 00:29:58.146 A:middle
well, getting in your way.

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:05.186 A:middle

stop there though.

stop there though.

We've also added a lot

00:30:07.296 --> 00:30:09.546 A:middle
of different ways
to make constraints.

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.026 A:middle
Let me show you my favorite.

00:30:11.526 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
Control drag.

00:30:13.136 --> 00:30:16.136 A:middle

button by control dragging

00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:19.206 A:middle
from it to its superview.

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:23.536 A:middle
Well, wait.

00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:27.166 A:middle
I can even make more than
one constraint at a time.

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:31.866 A:middle
And now the preview assistant
updates, so I see that I'm

00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:34.416 A:middle
on the right track and
I know that I only need

00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.356 A:middle
to make one more constraint,

00:30:36.886 --> 00:30:38.886 A:middle
and now my button is
doing the right thing

00:30:38.886 --> 00:30:39.876 A:middle
in both orientations.

Now, doing the other
button is even easier.

00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:54.196 A:middle
I can control drag to
the other button and set

00:30:54.196 --> 00:30:57.256 A:middle
up all three constraints
at once.

this next view over.

00:31:05.786 --> 00:31:08.446 A:middle
It's obviously having
some layout difficulties.

00:31:08.486 --> 00:31:10.826 A:middle
That's because there are no
constraints in this view at all.

00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
Now, control drag is great for
setting up one, two, three,

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:18.756 A:middle
a handful of constraints, but
of course, you can do things

00:31:18.756 --> 00:31:23.236 A:middle
like select all of the objects
in this view and add all

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:24.446 A:middle
of the constraints at once.

and I know a number
of my engineers are

00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:17.826 A:middle
up here to talk with you.

00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:21.386 A:middle
So how should you get
started with this?

00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:25.416 A:middle
Well, first of course, download
the SDK, build your application,

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:28.315 A:middle
and boom, you've got
the new user interface.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:31.985 A:middle
You may need to update
your UI to accommodate some

00:34:31.985 --> 00:34:33.576 A:middle
of the changes that
we've talked about,

00:34:33.786 --> 00:34:37.295 A:middle
but we really encourage you to
actually take a deeper rethink

00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:41.315 A:middle
on the design of your
UI along the lines

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:43.156 A:middle
of what we've done in iOS 7.

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:46.835 A:middle
Let's take a look at these
numbers again from this morning,

00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:51.436 A:middle
93 percent of our users are
running the latest iOS release.

00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:53.016 A:middle
That's pretty incredible.

00:34:53.755 --> 00:34:55.116 A:middle
We think it won't be very long

00:34:55.116 --> 00:34:57.216 A:middle
after all before
the vast majority

00:34:57.216 --> 00:34:59.586 A:middle
of your users are running iOS 7.

00:35:01.336 --> 00:35:03.956 A:middle
We've got some great
documentation on the web,

00:35:03.956 --> 00:35:08.076 A:middle
and I encourage you to download
the iOS 7 UI Transition Guide

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:10.796 A:middle
available at this URL here.

00:35:13.816 --> 00:35:15.206 A:middle
If you can type that
one quickly.

00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:19.376 A:middle
And that's it for iOS 7.

00:35:20.596 --> 00:35:24.226 A:middle
Now, games are a very important
category of application.

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:26.566 A:middle
And to talk about some
exciting new stuff,

00:35:26.566 --> 00:35:28.016 A:middle
I'd like to hand
off to Jeff Stone.

00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:28.836 A:middle
Jeff?

00:35:29.516 --> 00:35:32.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:33.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Toby.

00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:38.186 A:middle
So we have some really great
new game technology to talk

00:35:38.186 --> 00:35:41.966 A:middle
about today, first let's do an
update -- update on Game Center.

00:35:42.566 --> 00:35:46.996 A:middle
Apple's social gaming network,
we introduced it three years ago

00:35:46.996 --> 00:35:52.446 A:middle
and it's doing amazingly well
with 240 million players.

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:56.456 A:middle
Of course, Game Center supports
things like leaderboards

00:35:56.826 --> 00:35:59.886 A:middle
and multiplayer challenges
and friends.

00:35:59.886 --> 00:36:02.816 A:middle
And we're going to
continue to enhance it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.886 --> 00:36:02.816 A:middle
And we're going to
continue to enhance it.

00:36:03.416 --> 00:36:05.776 A:middle
Now leaderboards, you can
have over 500 leaderboards,

00:36:05.826 --> 00:36:07.556 A:middle
you can have up to
500 leaderboards.

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:10.986 A:middle
We have modal challenges that
allow you to tie a challenge

00:36:10.986 --> 00:36:12.786 A:middle
to a specific mode of your game.

00:36:13.566 --> 00:36:15.826 A:middle
And we have -- we have turn --

00:36:15.826 --> 00:36:19.086 A:middle
you can add to turn-based
applications either auctions

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:21.276 A:middle
or in-game trading
among other things.

00:36:23.066 --> 00:36:25.666 A:middle
But the big news today is
we have two new technologies

00:36:26.156 --> 00:36:29.166 A:middle
to introduce that makes
game development easier

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:29.956 A:middle
and better than ever.

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:35.326 A:middle
First, I want to
introduce Sprite Kit.

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:38.526 A:middle
So if you're building a game
like one of our iconic games

00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:42.706 A:middle
on the platform, Cut the
Rope, Where's My Water,

00:36:43.406 --> 00:36:45.286 A:middle
or Jetpack Joyride, you need

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:48.566 A:middle
to spend time building
a good game engine.

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:50.926 A:middle
And to build a good game
engine, it takes a lot

00:36:50.926 --> 00:36:52.386 A:middle
of knowledge to do that.

00:36:52.386 --> 00:36:54.256 A:middle
So we thought, what can we do

00:36:54.256 --> 00:36:58.166 A:middle
to help you game developers
make your life easier?

00:36:59.096 --> 00:37:00.426 A:middle
So that's why we
created Sprite Kit.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.096 --> 00:37:00.426 A:middle
So that's why we
created Sprite Kit.

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
It has everything you
expect in a game engine.

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:06.916 A:middle
It has a great animation
system, particles, physics,

00:37:07.246 --> 00:37:11.756 A:middle
image effects, video tie-in,
and all that and more.

00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:13.806 A:middle
It's high performance with --

00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:17.346 A:middle
at its core is a
high-performance rendering

00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:18.386 A:middle
engine built by people

00:37:18.386 --> 00:37:21.936 A:middle
who really know GPU
development inside and out.

00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:26.626 A:middle
We have integrated tools in
Xcode and it's easy to learn,

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.286 A:middle
which means you have
less code to write.

00:37:28.576 --> 00:37:31.296 A:middle
Let us do the heavy lifting for
you and so you can concentrate

00:37:31.296 --> 00:37:32.606 A:middle
on building a great game.

00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:37.306 A:middle
And of course, it's available
for both iOS and OS X,

00:37:37.396 --> 00:37:40.856 A:middle
which means the code you write
can be used on both platforms.

00:37:41.366 --> 00:37:42.406 A:middle
So let's take a look at a demo.

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:53.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:54.296 --> 00:37:56.956 A:middle
So here's a little tour of some
of the features of Sprite Kit.

00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:59.106 A:middle
First, obviously, is
an animation system.

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:01.826 A:middle
The animation system has all
the things you would expect --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:01.826 A:middle
The animation system has all
the things you would expect --

00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:06.256 A:middle
translation, rotation,
scaling, fade in, fade out,

00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:11.156 A:middle
and these actions can
be chained together --

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:13.756 A:middle
chained together or combined
and run in parallel in groups.

00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:18.506 A:middle
Oops, let's try that again.

00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:21.236 A:middle
This is also optimized
for both --

00:38:21.876 --> 00:38:26.626 A:middle
for OS X and iOS hardware
with the added benefit

00:38:26.626 --> 00:38:28.446 A:middle
that it makes it really
battery-efficient.

00:38:32.996 --> 00:38:34.596 A:middle
So that -- so that's
the animation system.

00:38:34.936 --> 00:38:35.736 A:middle
Next is physics.

00:38:36.076 --> 00:38:37.716 A:middle
We obviously -- we have
integrated physics.

00:38:37.716 --> 00:38:41.516 A:middle
But this is not just, we provide
physics alongside of Sprite Kit,

00:38:41.516 --> 00:38:43.786 A:middle
we actually have
integrated physics.

00:38:43.786 --> 00:38:45.646 A:middle
Putting physics into your
application is as simple

00:38:45.646 --> 00:38:47.946 A:middle
as one API call for
setting the physics body.

00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:50.796 A:middle
So we can -- we can kind
of lean one direction

00:38:51.236 --> 00:38:53.336 A:middle
or we can go back the other way,

00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:57.016 A:middle
and also we can obviously
put some touch events

00:38:57.016 --> 00:38:59.516 A:middle
in to add some impulses
to our physics engine.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:04.126 A:middle
Really efficient physics
engine built into Sprite Kit.

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.396 A:middle
The -- next, particles.

00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:09.286 A:middle
We have full particle system
in there, 37 properties

00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:12.736 A:middle
of these particles, and the key
here is you can either modify

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.876 A:middle
these with your code
or you can --

00:39:14.876 --> 00:39:16.086 A:middle
or you can modify the data

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:18.566 A:middle
which means you can
build particles offline

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:20.516 A:middle
and archive them for
use by your application.

00:39:21.586 --> 00:39:24.196 A:middle
We also have an interpolated
spawning [phonetic] system

00:39:24.476 --> 00:39:26.806 A:middle
which we think of this as
an anti-clumping technology.

00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:29.446 A:middle
As I move this around, you
see the particles are evenly

00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:30.646 A:middle
distributed in the trail.

00:39:31.486 --> 00:39:34.056 A:middle
Everything like that, all of
this 60 frames per second,

00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:35.666 A:middle
I can even write with it.

00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:37.956 A:middle
Here you go.

00:39:38.966 --> 00:39:40.416 A:middle
We've also integrated Sprite Kit

00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:43.526 A:middle
into our existing graphics
technology core image.

00:39:44.326 --> 00:39:47.936 A:middle
So you can apply CI filters
to your application here.

00:39:47.936 --> 00:39:49.766 A:middle
And once we toss
a filter on here,

00:39:49.766 --> 00:39:54.466 A:middle
so you can have this great,
yeah, this great pinch effect

00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:57.586 A:middle
on there as the physics
simulation continues to run.

00:39:59.696 --> 00:40:02.046 A:middle
We have a pixelate filter
on top of the system.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.696 --> 00:40:02.046 A:middle
We have a pixelate filter
on top of the system.

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
And these filters can be applied
to all or part Sprite tree

00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:07.326 A:middle
and finally a really,
really cool --

00:40:09.076 --> 00:40:10.196 A:middle
-- twirl effect.

00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:13.306 A:middle
So you can apply CI filters
right on top of your scene.

00:40:14.806 --> 00:40:15.476 A:middle
Finally, the video.

00:40:16.596 --> 00:40:18.686 A:middle
We've taken our great
media technologies

00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.296 A:middle
and integrated video
in the Sprite Kit.

00:40:20.476 --> 00:40:22.116 A:middle
This means you can
mass the video

00:40:22.116 --> 00:40:23.896 A:middle
and I can manipulate the
mass on top of the video.

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:26.096 A:middle
And you can combine
this into your scene

00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:29.556 A:middle
such the video is not just for
cut scenes and transitions.

00:40:29.556 --> 00:40:31.326 A:middle
I can add sprites in here.

00:40:31.326 --> 00:40:34.396 A:middle
And you see the sprites fly
in front and behind the video.

00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:36.936 A:middle
Video is a first class
citizen in Sprite Kit.

00:40:38.356 --> 00:40:39.736 A:middle
So that's a quick
tour of Sprite Kit.

00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:48.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:50.686 A:middle
I thought of making the
game development easier

00:40:50.766 --> 00:40:51.256 A:middle
for all of you.

00:40:51.656 --> 00:40:52.726 A:middle
How else I'm going to do that?

00:40:53.116 --> 00:40:57.326 A:middle
Well, we're going to introduce
comprehensive, full-featured,

00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:00.266 A:middle
production quality game
sample code for you guys.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:00.266 A:middle
production quality game
sample code for you guys.

00:41:00.766 --> 00:41:03.966 A:middle
So let me jump in here
and show you what we have.

00:41:06.416 --> 00:41:07.806 A:middle
So this is our adventure game.

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:11.066 A:middle
It is a Multiplayer
Dungeon Crawler

00:41:11.066 --> 00:41:12.376 A:middle
with all the features
you would expect.

00:41:16.126 --> 00:41:20.166 A:middle
So it has a multi-directional
scrolling, parallax effects,

00:41:20.406 --> 00:41:22.356 A:middle
we have part of this falling
leaves particle effects

00:41:22.356 --> 00:41:25.316 A:middle
that the enemies have AI,
with high quality art work.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:30.876 A:middle
All of this was production
quality code which allows you

00:41:30.986 --> 00:41:33.726 A:middle
to just grab it, and either
start your next game project

00:41:33.756 --> 00:41:37.476 A:middle
with it, or adapt the two, or
pull some technologies out of it

00:41:37.476 --> 00:41:39.646 A:middle
to adapt it to your
current game.

00:41:41.016 --> 00:41:41.446 A:middle
There you go.

00:41:41.496 --> 00:41:44.546 A:middle
So let's jump back in the
Xcode and take a look.

00:41:45.006 --> 00:41:49.066 A:middle
So these samples are made
for both OS X and iOS

00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:51.976 A:middle
which means the vast majority
of the source files are shared,

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.476 A:middle
so you can use them to support
either operating system.

00:41:54.936 --> 00:41:57.116 A:middle
We have over 1,700 art
files in this sample.

00:41:57.116 --> 00:41:58.586 A:middle
And if we go look at the part --

00:41:58.586 --> 00:41:59.856 A:middle
one of the particle
effects here,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:01.886 A:middle
this is a leaf particle effect,

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.746 A:middle
what you'll notice is we
build a particle editor right

00:42:04.746 --> 00:42:05.536 A:middle
in the Xcode.

00:42:06.516 --> 00:42:11.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.686 A:middle
So I can change the generation
rate on the particles here.

00:42:14.686 --> 00:42:16.876 A:middle
We take a lot more of leaves --

00:42:16.876 --> 00:42:18.796 A:middle
that that's felt
better for the game.

00:42:19.116 --> 00:42:21.726 A:middle
And, you know, leaves fall in
the fall not when they're green

00:42:21.726 --> 00:42:23.776 A:middle
so we want to change one
of our key colors here.

00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:26.426 A:middle
And we'll make that red.

00:42:26.426 --> 00:42:27.906 A:middle
And we've changed
the particle effect.

00:42:28.236 --> 00:42:29.796 A:middle
Again, this is editing
the particle data

00:42:30.016 --> 00:42:31.566 A:middle
so when you build your
application again,

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:33.416 A:middle
when you build your game,
it's picked right up

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:34.816 A:middle
and your game will
have this effect in it.

00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:39.766 A:middle
So that's a quick tour of
one of our new game samples.

00:42:47.686 --> 00:42:49.516 A:middle
The next big technology we have

00:42:49.576 --> 00:42:52.246 A:middle
to announce today
is Game Controllers.

00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:58.736 A:middle

00:42:59.236 --> 00:43:01.936 A:middle
We're taking the gaming
experience to a new level

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.236 --> 00:43:01.936 A:middle
We're taking the gaming
experience to a new level

00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:03.716 A:middle
by defining the standard --

00:43:04.046 --> 00:43:07.086 A:middle
a common standard for game
controllers that allow high --

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:09.556 A:middle
that allow all users to have
high quality game controllers.

00:43:09.556 --> 00:43:10.356 A:middle
So how are we doing this?

00:43:10.826 --> 00:43:12.916 A:middle
We are providing the users --

00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:15.656 A:middle
users can pick whatever
third-party controller

00:43:15.656 --> 00:43:16.386 A:middle
they prefer.

00:43:16.716 --> 00:43:20.526 A:middle
Software developers can build a
single software interface rather

00:43:20.526 --> 00:43:21.656 A:middle
than having to support
a multitude

00:43:21.656 --> 00:43:24.786 A:middle
of software interfaces,
thus as game developers,

00:43:25.116 --> 00:43:26.746 A:middle
you can concentrate
in building your game

00:43:26.976 --> 00:43:29.116 A:middle
versus supporting a whole bunch
of different game controllers.

00:43:29.626 --> 00:43:31.716 A:middle
This comes into two parts.

00:43:31.756 --> 00:43:35.516 A:middle
First, a hardware standard,
this is part of our MFi program.

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:40.406 A:middle
And secondly, a software
interface

00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:42.836 A:middle
which allows software
developers to build --

00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:45.576 A:middle
which allows you to build
to a common interface.

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.076 A:middle
Let's first talk
about the hardware.

00:43:48.176 --> 00:43:49.546 A:middle
The hardware comes
into two types,

00:43:49.936 --> 00:43:52.276 A:middle
either form-fitting
snapping controls,

00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:53.936 A:middle
or your stand-alone controllers.

00:43:54.196 --> 00:43:55.656 A:middle
There's also two configurations.

00:43:56.006 --> 00:43:59.216 A:middle
The standard configuration
has a d-pad, four buttons,

00:43:59.516 --> 00:44:00.546 A:middle
and some shoulder buttons.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.516 --> 00:44:00.546 A:middle
and some shoulder buttons.

00:44:01.666 --> 00:44:04.976 A:middle
The hands configuration adds two
thumb sticks and two triggers.

00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:09.606 A:middle
All inputs are
pressure-sensitive.

00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:11.786 A:middle
And we talked about
high quality.

00:44:11.786 --> 00:44:13.816 A:middle
We want to ensure there are
high quality controllers

00:44:13.816 --> 00:44:15.806 A:middle
to give your users
a great experience,

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:18.076 A:middle
we do these by requiring
no calibration,

00:44:18.076 --> 00:44:20.546 A:middle
the inputs can't drift,
and all the buttons have

00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:21.556 A:middle
to have the same feel.

00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:24.606 A:middle
Of course there's a
software piece of this.

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:27.796 A:middle
So you can -- so your software
can communicate directly

00:44:27.796 --> 00:44:28.516 A:middle
with controllers.

00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:31.486 A:middle
And this is, the truth be told,
this is really easy to adopt

00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:33.796 A:middle
with both polling and
callback types of inputs.

00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:35.096 A:middle
We've also designed it

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:37.986 A:middle
so you can actually use
the Multi-Touch interface

00:44:37.986 --> 00:44:40.266 A:middle
or the gyro in conjunction
with your controller

00:44:40.516 --> 00:44:44.516 A:middle
so you can make a great a hybrid
experience for your users.

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:50.026 A:middle
And of course this is both
on iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

00:44:50.736 --> 00:44:52.616 A:middle
So I think the best way
to show what you can do

00:44:52.616 --> 00:44:54.346 A:middle
with controllers
is to do a demo.

00:44:54.346 --> 00:44:56.366 A:middle
I like to invite Thomas
Schegloff [assumed spelling]

00:44:56.366 --> 00:44:59.226 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:45:06.376 --> 00:45:09.126 A:middle
Last week, we reached out
to Crytek, they're working

00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:14.496 A:middle
on their new iOS application
collectibles and they came in

00:45:15.456 --> 00:45:18.316 A:middle
and integrated game controllers
into their application.

00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:20.136 A:middle
Within a day, they had a
standard controller working.

00:45:20.746 --> 00:45:25.386 A:middle
What you have here is a tactical
action game and this is running

00:45:25.386 --> 00:45:29.456 A:middle
on the iPhone and you can use
the controller using the D-pad

00:45:29.586 --> 00:45:31.686 A:middle
for relative movements
to avoid those explosions

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:35.356 A:middle
and advance his squad,
as he advances his squad,

00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:36.786 A:middle
he get -- comes under fire.

00:45:36.786 --> 00:45:38.076 A:middle
What he now can do
is hit a button

00:45:38.276 --> 00:45:39.366 A:middle
to move the squad to cover.

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:41.276 A:middle
He finds that he wants

00:45:41.276 --> 00:45:43.516 A:middle
to directly manipulate
some of his troops.

00:45:43.516 --> 00:45:46.596 A:middle
What he can do is he can use
at the touch interface to touch

00:45:46.596 --> 00:45:48.686 A:middle
on a troop and he can
drag it specifically

00:45:48.686 --> 00:45:50.076 A:middle
to a point he wants
deploy them at.

00:45:50.436 --> 00:45:53.966 A:middle
But this allows a great hybrid
mix of the game controller

00:45:54.196 --> 00:45:55.426 A:middle
and the Direct-Touch interface.

00:45:57.256 --> 00:45:59.216 A:middle

in a little trouble,

he can hit the shoulder button,
calling some air support,

00:46:06.856 --> 00:46:10.036 A:middle
now the D-pad switches over to
controlling his air support.

So Mavericks, the big
architectural focus area is

00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:56.836 A:middle
optimizing power consumption.

00:47:57.246 --> 00:48:00.656 A:middle
All of us here are already
used to optimizing our apps

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.246 --> 00:48:00.656 A:middle
All of us here are already
used to optimizing our apps

00:48:00.656 --> 00:48:03.446 A:middle
for low memory use and
low CPU utilization.

00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:06.776 A:middle
But the majority of computers
used nowadays are laptops

00:48:06.946 --> 00:48:10.846 A:middle
and mobile users really also
care about long battery life.

00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:14.966 A:middle
These added several features to
Mavericks that allows end users

00:48:14.966 --> 00:48:16.776 A:middle
to understand the
power consumption

00:48:16.776 --> 00:48:18.076 A:middle
of the apps they're
using better.

00:48:18.326 --> 00:48:20.946 A:middle
For example, by listing
how are hungry apps

00:48:20.946 --> 00:48:23.336 A:middle
in the battery menu extra
and in activity monitor.

00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:25.946 A:middle
And you probably don't want
your apps to show up there.

[ Laughter ]

00:48:28.426 --> 00:48:30.396 A:middle
The good news is
that the following --

00:48:30.396 --> 00:48:33.836 A:middle
a few very straightforward
rules like not using unnecessary

00:48:34.126 --> 00:48:37.236 A:middle
or too frequent timers, you can
often achieve great results.

00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:40.216 A:middle
This slide here shows
a comparison of OS X,

00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:43.336 A:middle
10.8 and 10.9 running
on the same hardware.

00:48:43.956 --> 00:48:46.586 A:middle
As you can see, just two
software changes, we were able

00:48:46.586 --> 00:48:49.236 A:middle
to squeeze out significant
improvements to battery life

00:48:49.236 --> 00:48:53.396 A:middle
and so can you in your own apps.

00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:56.386 A:middle
Another big focus area
for us was responsiveness

00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:59.686 A:middle
such as the scroll speed of
table use and the smoothness

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:00.936 A:middle
of animations and switching

of animations and switching

00:49:00.936 --> 00:49:02.356 A:middle
between different
application states.

You saw this morning in the key
note how nicely made [inaudible]

00:49:05.626 --> 00:49:08.756 A:middle
and Safari, now react
to user events.

00:49:09.306 --> 00:49:13.006 A:middle
Now one problem is that
optimizing power consumption

00:49:13.496 --> 00:49:16.986 A:middle
and preparing an app for great
responsiveness can sometimes

00:49:17.046 --> 00:49:17.976 A:middle
trade often each other.

00:49:18.526 --> 00:49:20.416 A:middle
So the trick is to
find the right balance,

00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:23.066 A:middle
the right intersection between
power and responsiveness.

00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:26.096 A:middle
Let's take a look at a few
things within the Mavericks

00:49:26.156 --> 00:49:27.986 A:middle
that you believe
represent the right choices.

00:49:29.356 --> 00:49:30.716 A:middle
We implemented new mechanisms

00:49:30.816 --> 00:49:32.766 A:middle
that vastly improved
memory management.

00:49:33.546 --> 00:49:36.026 A:middle
We introduced in our scrolling
architecture in App Kit

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:40.976 A:middle
and of course we added the new
App Net feature which started,

00:49:40.976 --> 00:49:44.796 A:middle
it's the power consumption
of background with apps.

00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:48.176 A:middle
For memory, we've now
centralized all our management

00:49:48.176 --> 00:49:51.326 A:middle
policies which makes the OS more
efficient and more predictable.

00:49:53.006 --> 00:49:55.816 A:middle
For several releases
already, we have notified apps

00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:58.416 A:middle
if you needed their help
because memory pressure

00:49:58.416 --> 00:49:59.686 A:middle
in the system had
reached the level --

00:49:59.686 --> 00:50:01.416 A:middle
that we needed to free
some extra memory.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:59.686 --> 00:50:01.416 A:middle
that we needed to free
some extra memory.

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:05.176 A:middle
But they only notified once we
had already reached a very high

00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:06.106 A:middle
level of memory pressure.

00:50:06.496 --> 00:50:08.846 A:middle
So in general, apps didn't
really know what was going

00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:11.246 A:middle
on around them and
then it was okay again

00:50:11.246 --> 00:50:12.296 A:middle
to become more aggressive.

00:50:12.556 --> 00:50:13.566 A:middle
That's using more memory.

00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:16.086 A:middle

two ways and [inaudible].

to send you two notifications
why the memory pressure

00:50:20.516 --> 00:50:21.106 A:middle
is increasing.

00:50:22.096 --> 00:50:25.616 A:middle
An early warning and also a
critical level notification.

00:50:25.616 --> 00:50:29.016 A:middle
And then we're also going to
send you an all clear signal

00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:32.426 A:middle
if the memory drops back down
to normal levels then it's okay

00:50:32.426 --> 00:50:35.076 A:middle
for you for example to create
larger in-memory caches again.

00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.916 A:middle
So by listening to all
this notifications,

00:50:38.146 --> 00:50:40.306 A:middle
apps can now make much
more informed decisions

00:50:40.306 --> 00:50:42.106 A:middle
about their memory use.

00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:46.646 A:middle
We've also improved all
purgeable memory handling

00:50:46.646 --> 00:50:48.206 A:middle
and made it actually
predictable.

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:52.166 A:middle
Instead of purging memory based
on age, you now purge based

00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:53.876 A:middle
on the memory pressure
in the system.

00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:55.976 A:middle
And they're allowing apps

00:50:56.066 --> 00:50:59.116 A:middle
to specify more fine-grained
priorities to indicate

00:50:59.116 --> 00:51:01.256 A:middle
which regions are best
to take down first.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.116 --> 00:51:01.256 A:middle
which regions are best
to take down first.

00:51:02.516 --> 00:51:05.816 A:middle
Unlike low memory notifications,
purgeable memory is designed

00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:07.416 A:middle
so that the system
can free memory

00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:09.076 A:middle
without unvoiding any apps.

00:51:09.406 --> 00:51:10.776 A:middle
So it's quicker and
it's cheaper.

00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:14.686 A:middle
And with the new behavior,
it is a lot more useful now.

00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:18.146 A:middle
The easiest way for you to
leverage purgeable memory is

00:51:18.146 --> 00:51:23.146 A:middle
through our Libcache
and NSCache APIs.

00:51:23.356 --> 00:51:24.806 A:middle
We've also added a compressor

00:51:24.806 --> 00:51:26.736 A:middle
to the memory management
techniques you now use

00:51:26.736 --> 00:51:27.246 A:middle
in Mavericks.

00:51:28.026 --> 00:51:30.386 A:middle
Instead of swapping out
memory directly to disc,

00:51:30.846 --> 00:51:33.076 A:middle
you're now freeing pages
by compressing them

00:51:33.136 --> 00:51:34.476 A:middle
in an intermediate stage,

00:51:35.186 --> 00:51:37.286 A:middle
which dramatically
improves responsiveness

00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:42.136 A:middle
to memory regress, because
there is no I/O needed.

00:51:43.176 --> 00:51:45.186 A:middle
And if you do have to
swap out to disc later,

00:51:45.186 --> 00:51:48.226 A:middle
we can do so in an asynchronous
fashion that's larger,

00:51:48.346 --> 00:51:49.776 A:middle
more uniformed chunks of memory.

00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:52.536 A:middle
It also has a really nice
side effect of swap --

00:51:52.936 --> 00:51:55.416 A:middle
side effect of swapped
files staying smaller

00:51:55.486 --> 00:51:56.516 A:middle
and less fragmented.

00:51:57.816 --> 00:52:00.796 A:middle
So all this memory management
techniques now work together

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:57.816 --> 00:52:00.796 A:middle
So all this memory management
techniques now work together

00:52:00.796 --> 00:52:04.326 A:middle
in Mavericks to give us the
most efficient memory management

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:08.876 A:middle
system you've ever had in OS X.

00:52:09.116 --> 00:52:11.146 A:middle
Next, our scrolling
architecture.

00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:13.866 A:middle
To improve responsiveness
of scroll views,

00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:16.696 A:middle
you've completely reinvent
all the scrolling architecture

00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:17.236 A:middle
in AppKit.

00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:20.916 A:middle
To maybe achieve the smooth
scrolling you observed this

00:52:20.916 --> 00:52:22.986 A:middle
morning and in [inaudible]
calendar is

00:52:22.986 --> 00:52:24.506 A:middle
that you're now pregenerating

00:52:24.506 --> 00:52:27.776 A:middle
and buffering additional review
content beyond the visible view

00:52:27.776 --> 00:52:30.746 A:middle
areas and just scrolling
that content with the help

00:52:30.746 --> 00:52:33.376 A:middle
of core animation just makes
it hardware accelerated.

00:52:34.706 --> 00:52:36.326 A:middle
So let's say we have
a scroll view

00:52:36.326 --> 00:52:38.596 A:middle
that shows a portion
of a larger document.

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.286 A:middle
AppKit will now ask
the application

00:52:41.286 --> 00:52:44.166 A:middle
to render extra content
in small chunks

00:52:44.376 --> 00:52:46.016 A:middle
when the system is
otherwise idle?

00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:51.996 A:middle
Notice that we are not
changing the threading model

00:52:51.996 --> 00:52:53.256 A:middle
of AppKit in any way.

00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:54.966 A:middle
All the rendering
still takes place

00:52:54.966 --> 00:52:56.716 A:middle
on the main thread as usual.

00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.646 A:middle
But since this happens
in small chunks as long

00:52:59.646 --> 00:53:02.056 A:middle
as your application can render
that content quickly enough

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.646 --> 00:53:02.056 A:middle
as your application can render
that content quickly enough

00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:04.786 A:middle
if we never block them in main
thread for long and interfere

00:53:04.786 --> 00:53:05.746 A:middle
with the user in any way.

00:53:06.906 --> 00:53:09.676 A:middle
Also, so that we can easily give
the memory back to the system

00:53:09.676 --> 00:53:11.316 A:middle
in case we get in the
high memory pressure,

00:53:11.936 --> 00:53:14.776 A:middle
they're storing this overdraw
of content in purgeable memory.

00:53:15.486 --> 00:53:20.386 A:middle
Now, when the user
initiates a scored event,

00:53:20.476 --> 00:53:23.026 A:middle
AppKit can respond
immediately [inaudible]

00:53:23.026 --> 00:53:24.286 A:middle
of the available overdraw.

00:53:25.026 --> 00:53:27.436 A:middle
So AppKit will stop
at the attempt scoring

00:53:27.436 --> 00:53:29.936 A:middle
with a perfect 60
frames a second as long

00:53:29.936 --> 00:53:31.766 A:middle
as there are sufficient
overdraw available,

00:53:32.206 --> 00:53:34.286 A:middle
but at the same time
right from the beginning

00:53:34.286 --> 00:53:36.876 A:middle
of the event working with your
app to draw even more content

00:53:36.876 --> 00:53:37.976 A:middle
for the download document.

00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:40.936 A:middle
So chances are that by the time
the scored event has reached

00:53:40.936 --> 00:53:43.556 A:middle
these new areas, the
application is already had time

00:53:43.556 --> 00:53:45.216 A:middle
to finish rendering
those as well.

00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:48.076 A:middle
And the net result is
that became as long

00:53:48.076 --> 00:53:49.376 A:middle
as your application can render

00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:52.066 A:middle
that content quickly
enough often achieve better,

00:53:52.066 --> 00:53:55.726 A:middle
smooth 60 frames a second
for the entire scroll event.

00:53:58.716 --> 00:54:01.286 A:middle
Responsive scrolling
takes effect automatically

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:58.716 --> 00:54:01.286 A:middle
Responsive scrolling
takes effect automatically

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:04.456 A:middle
for most applications linked
against our latest tested case.

00:54:04.456 --> 00:54:06.806 A:middle
There is no special
adoption required,

00:54:07.316 --> 00:54:09.106 A:middle
but they did add a few
methods to end this view

00:54:09.106 --> 00:54:10.796 A:middle
and in the scroll
view that allow you

00:54:10.796 --> 00:54:11.966 A:middle
to customize the behavior

00:54:11.966 --> 00:54:13.846 A:middle
in case your application
has special needs.

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:18.066 A:middle
Next, let's talk about App Nap.

00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.056 A:middle
The perhaps most
effective way we found

00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:22.646 A:middle
to lower power consumption

00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:24.996 A:middle
of the overall system is
the new App Nap feature.

00:54:25.906 --> 00:54:28.356 A:middle
It focuses system
resources on the user --

00:54:28.356 --> 00:54:30.786 A:middle
on the work that made us the
most to the user right now,

00:54:31.396 --> 00:54:34.096 A:middle
while at the same time
drastically scaling back the

00:54:34.096 --> 00:54:37.196 A:middle
resources being offered to
applications that aren't

00:54:37.196 --> 00:54:40.676 A:middle
as critical to the user
at this point in time.

00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:43.076 A:middle
App Nap takes effect
after a short delay,

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:47.346 A:middle
but once an application naps if
it see a reduction in priority

00:54:47.486 --> 00:54:50.946 A:middle
for I/O and CPU --
for I/O and CPU time.

00:54:51.846 --> 00:54:54.586 A:middle
And also, maybe most
importantly, if it see any time

00:54:54.586 --> 00:54:56.676 A:middle
as it sets up being
rate limited.

00:54:58.176 --> 00:55:01.866 A:middle
We found that unnecessary, in
two frequent timers and one

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:58.176 --> 00:55:01.866 A:middle
We found that unnecessary, in
two frequent timers and one

00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:03.006 A:middle
of the largest sources

00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:05.186 A:middle
of unnecessary power
drain in the system.

00:55:05.606 --> 00:55:09.246 A:middle
So we are quite aggressive with
our RAID limiting, napping apps,

00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:12.426 A:middle
received events, time events,
only every 10 seconds or so.

00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:15.586 A:middle
And the -- even aligning the
time as of all the napping apps

00:55:15.616 --> 00:55:18.336 A:middle
so that don't end up breaking
up the CPU individually,

00:55:18.486 --> 00:55:20.976 A:middle
but instead perform their work
together at the same time.

00:55:22.846 --> 00:55:24.756 A:middle
To decide whether an
application can nap,

00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:26.506 A:middle
we take a look at manufactures.

00:55:26.966 --> 00:55:28.536 A:middle
The decision is fairly
easy if a user

00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.086 A:middle
for example hides
an application.

00:55:30.656 --> 00:55:32.096 A:middle
But the -- even monitoring
things

00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:34.226 A:middle
like drawing activity
of backgrounded apps.

00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:35.756 A:middle
So that applications that are

00:55:35.756 --> 00:55:37.756 A:middle
in the background may
be possibly occluded

00:55:37.756 --> 00:55:40.536 A:middle
by other windows to
-- for you to App Nap

00:55:40.756 --> 00:55:44.926 A:middle
if they don't update the
UI in any visible way.

00:55:45.446 --> 00:55:46.356 A:middle
Another factor we take

00:55:46.356 --> 00:55:48.846 A:middle
into consideration is whether
applications have declared

00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:49.826 A:middle
in power assertions.

00:55:50.516 --> 00:55:53.066 A:middle
This is an area that is going to
be more important going forward.

00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:55.116 A:middle
Applications need
to tell the system

00:55:55.516 --> 00:55:58.256 A:middle
if they are performing any work
that the user still expects

00:55:58.256 --> 00:55:59.746 A:middle
to finish quickly even

00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:01.466 A:middle
if the application is
being backgrounded.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:01.466 A:middle
if the application is
being backgrounded.

00:56:01.826 --> 00:56:03.576 A:middle
For example, a long
running file export.

00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:05.936 A:middle
And the easiest way
to do that as

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:09.476 A:middle
to the new NSProcessInfo API
was listed here on the slide.

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.626 A:middle
Now, to show you a little bit
more about how App Nap works,

00:56:13.796 --> 00:56:15.346 A:middle
I'm going to ask
Max Drukman to come

00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:16.906 A:middle
up on stage again
for another demo.

00:56:18.516 --> 00:56:22.496 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:56:22.996 --> 00:56:25.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you [inaudible].

00:56:25.096 --> 00:56:28.156 A:middle
Can we switch to the
demo machine, please?

00:56:28.156 --> 00:56:28.396 A:middle
All right.

00:56:29.036 --> 00:56:31.976 A:middle
Here is the Mac version of the
game I was working on earlier

00:56:31.976 --> 00:56:35.046 A:middle
and now we can all thrill as
I implement power assertions.

00:56:35.786 --> 00:56:37.266 A:middle
Now, just kidding.

00:56:37.726 --> 00:56:41.196 A:middle
I'm going to show you App Nap
in action and some features

00:56:41.196 --> 00:56:45.576 A:middle
in Xcode 5 of course that
can help you spot performance

00:56:45.576 --> 00:56:47.436 A:middle
problems you might not
have known you had.

00:56:48.436 --> 00:56:50.606 A:middle
We're going to run my app.

00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:52.576 A:middle
Here it is.

00:56:52.606 --> 00:56:55.856 A:middle
But before we look at the
app, let's look at Xcode

00:56:56.056 --> 00:56:57.496 A:middle
and see what it's showing us.

00:56:58.176 --> 00:57:01.496 A:middle
I'm going to zoom in
so we get a good look.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:58.176 --> 00:57:01.496 A:middle
I'm going to zoom in
so we get a good look.

00:57:01.696 --> 00:57:03.626 A:middle
Now, in the debug navigator,

00:57:04.016 --> 00:57:06.676 A:middle
we showed you what we
were calling debug gauges.

00:57:07.186 --> 00:57:10.626 A:middle
There is one each for CPU,
memory and energy impact.

00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:14.076 A:middle
There's super low
overhead and they're great

00:57:14.076 --> 00:57:16.706 A:middle
for spotting problems
with your app.

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:21.606 A:middle
Here we can see that my app
is taking, well, zero CPU,

00:57:21.886 --> 00:57:26.276 A:middle
the memory is stable and the
energy impact is low to zero.

00:57:26.786 --> 00:57:29.236 A:middle
That means this view in
this app is doing great.

00:57:29.236 --> 00:57:30.366 A:middle
It's a good citizen.

00:57:30.856 --> 00:57:32.546 A:middle
Nothing much to see
here, move along.

00:57:33.126 --> 00:57:36.266 A:middle
But now let me show
you a problem scenario

00:57:36.726 --> 00:57:38.726 A:middle
that in the past was
kind of hard to spot.

00:57:39.746 --> 00:57:42.366 A:middle
I'm implementing a new
feature behind this map button.

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:46.496 A:middle
And what that does is it allows
my users to bring up a level map

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:50.136 A:middle
in the game and see where they
are as represented by this pin

00:57:50.136 --> 00:57:54.416 A:middle
in the center as well as
other players around the world

00:57:54.526 --> 00:57:56.116 A:middle
who were playing
on the same level.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:02.206 A:middle
Now, the position of the other
players is provided by a server.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:02.206 A:middle
Now, the position of the other
players is provided by a server.

00:58:02.776 --> 00:58:04.426 A:middle
There are obviously
aren't any players yet,

00:58:04.426 --> 00:58:07.386 A:middle
I'm still developing here,
but the codes in place

00:58:07.386 --> 00:58:08.536 A:middle
to provide that information.

00:58:09.656 --> 00:58:13.026 A:middle
But if we look back
in Xcode we can see

00:58:13.026 --> 00:58:13.866 A:middle
that there is some trouble.

00:58:14.766 --> 00:58:19.456 A:middle
My CPU and energy impact
gauges have spiked up

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:21.546 A:middle
and kind of stayed there.

00:58:22.036 --> 00:58:23.726 A:middle
Let's have a closer look.

00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:26.926 A:middle
When you select a
debug gauge in Xcode,

00:58:27.246 --> 00:58:29.886 A:middle
you see its report
in the editor area.

00:58:30.796 --> 00:58:34.966 A:middle
The report gives you the
current status as well as a view

00:58:34.966 --> 00:58:39.486 A:middle
over time and a button that
even allows you to dive directly

00:58:39.486 --> 00:58:42.436 A:middle
into instruments right away
if there's a problem you spot

00:58:42.796 --> 00:58:44.406 A:middle
and wants to deeply analyze.

00:58:46.996 --> 00:58:49.256 A:middle
The memory report is similar

00:58:49.336 --> 00:58:51.526 A:middle
with the current
and overtime views.

00:58:52.376 --> 00:58:57.226 A:middle
Energy impact provides that data
as well as your App Nap status

00:58:57.856 --> 00:59:01.996 A:middle
and various aspects
of power usage.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:58:57.856 --> 00:59:01.996 A:middle
and various aspects
of power usage.

00:59:02.456 --> 00:59:05.996 A:middle
Each of which has a button
that allows you to analyze

00:59:06.106 --> 00:59:08.316 A:middle
that aspect in the instruments.

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:12.546 A:middle
Now, let's start with CPU here.

00:59:12.906 --> 00:59:17.576 A:middle
High CPU usage is often
associated with drawing,

00:59:17.576 --> 00:59:20.626 A:middle
but it sure doesn't look like
my app is doing any drawing.

00:59:21.446 --> 00:59:23.956 A:middle
Luckily, Xcode 5 has
given us something

00:59:23.956 --> 00:59:25.086 A:middle
that can help us with that.

00:59:26.046 --> 00:59:30.736 A:middle
We've added Cocoa view debugging
support so I can do something

00:59:30.736 --> 00:59:32.386 A:middle
like turn on view drawing.

00:59:33.646 --> 00:59:37.836 A:middle
And now, every time a view
redraws, I get a highlight.

00:59:38.516 --> 00:59:42.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:59:43.366 --> 00:59:45.716 A:middle
Oh, well, you may be thrilled
by that but of course,

00:59:45.986 --> 00:59:48.886 A:middle
what this tells me is that I
didn't do a very clever thing.

00:59:48.886 --> 00:59:51.956 A:middle
My map pin is redrawing itself
all the time even though it

00:59:51.956 --> 00:59:52.586 A:middle
isn't moving.

00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:56.486 A:middle
The one clever thing I did do,
however, is add a debug menu

00:59:57.316 --> 00:59:58.936 A:middle
so I can turn off draw updating.

00:59:59.506 --> 01:00:01.416 A:middle
There, problem solved.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:59.506 --> 01:00:01.416 A:middle
There, problem solved.

01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.091 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.946 A:middle
Now, my CPU is looking good

01:00:05.946 --> 01:00:08.376 A:middle
but my energy impact
is still kind of high.

01:00:09.046 --> 01:00:11.026 A:middle
Let's see if App Nap
helps us with that.

01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:19.296 A:middle
I'm going to maximize Xcode
so that my app is behind

01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:22.056 A:middle
and would -- should
get App Nap to kick in.

01:00:22.696 --> 01:00:25.586 A:middle
Now, on this machine, I've
set App Nap to kick in quicker

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:29.036 A:middle
than normal and hopefully we're
going to see it any second now.

01:00:29.606 --> 01:00:32.976 A:middle
And, there it goes.

01:00:33.626 --> 01:00:39.296 A:middle
Now, App Nap has done its
thing and my app is now driven

01:00:39.366 --> 01:00:43.466 A:middle
to zero energy usage or almost.

01:00:44.346 --> 01:00:48.626 A:middle
Notice that I'm getting
little blips on the graph.

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.856 A:middle
Now, as Andreas told us earlier,

01:00:51.156 --> 01:00:52.976 A:middle
that's indicative
of a timer firing.

01:00:53.586 --> 01:00:55.896 A:middle
And sure enough, I've
got a timer firing.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:57.436 A:middle
Yet another bad pattern.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:01.596 A:middle
I've gone with here is that
my app is pulling the server

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:01.596 A:middle
I've gone with here is that
my app is pulling the server

01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:06.846 A:middle
for user updates instead of
waiting for a notification.

01:01:07.396 --> 01:01:08.876 A:middle
That's not a great
design pattern

01:01:09.176 --> 01:01:12.476 A:middle
but it's one who's impact was
kind of tough to spot before.

01:01:12.896 --> 01:01:15.846 A:middle
After all, I wasn't seeing
poor graphics performance

01:01:16.216 --> 01:01:19.196 A:middle
or beach balling
or my fan spinning.

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:22.826 A:middle
But that doesn't mean there
wasn't a significant energy

01:01:22.826 --> 01:01:23.956 A:middle
impact going on.

01:01:25.436 --> 01:01:29.566 A:middle
So, even though App Nap does
the right thing for your users,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.296 A:middle
it really pays to
do the extra work

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:37.226 A:middle
to make your app also a good
energy citizen whether it's

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.196 A:middle
active or it's napping.

01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:41.616 A:middle
And Xcode 5 gives
you the tools to make

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:43.496 A:middle
that possible and easy to do.

01:01:44.886 --> 01:01:45.546 A:middle
Back to you, Andreas.

01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:52.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:53.626 A:middle
Thank you, Max.

01:01:54.976 --> 01:01:57.176 A:middle
There's a few more
APIs and behaviors I'd

01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.756 A:middle
like to cover starting with
our new margin monitor support

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.756 A:middle
like to cover starting with
our new margin monitor support

01:02:01.226 --> 01:02:04.486 A:middle
which makes using [inaudible]
displays even more powerful

01:02:04.486 --> 01:02:05.276 A:middle
and flexible.

01:02:05.276 --> 01:02:07.676 A:middle
Do you think this is going
to work especially great

01:02:07.676 --> 01:02:09.626 A:middle
for all pro-users who often work

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.386 A:middle
with multiple apps
at the same time?

01:02:11.846 --> 01:02:13.636 A:middle
And by the way, it also
works well to the Xcode

01:02:13.636 --> 01:02:15.176 A:middle
that you can run
Xcode on one screen

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:17.136 A:middle
and the back end application
on the other screen.

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:21.356 A:middle
Now, we also believe
that the new behavior

01:02:21.356 --> 01:02:23.796 A:middle
to make it more likely that
users will choose to go

01:02:23.796 --> 01:02:24.886 A:middle
into full screen modes.

01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:27.936 A:middle
So now more than ever it's
worth spending the extra time

01:02:27.936 --> 01:02:29.946 A:middle
on implementing a great
full screen experience

01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:33.076 A:middle
in your own apps.

01:02:33.326 --> 01:02:36.016 A:middle
Now, there's a few behaviors you
might have felt like in the past

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.396 A:middle
that don't hold through anymore.

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:41.096 A:middle
Most importantly, there's no
distinction between primary

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.236 A:middle
and secondary displays.

01:02:43.036 --> 01:02:44.466 A:middle
So, an app cannot assume anymore

01:02:44.466 --> 01:02:46.706 A:middle
that it has the entire
screen available to itself

01:02:46.706 --> 01:02:48.856 A:middle
on another display
because now the doc

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:50.766 A:middle
and the Menu bar show
up there as well.

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.886 A:middle
You might want to validate
that your apps behave properly

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.226 A:middle
under these new conditions
before we ship Mavericks later

01:02:56.226 --> 01:02:56.786 A:middle
this year.

01:02:57.246 --> 01:03:01.866 A:middle
Another exciting change in
Mavericks is the TVs can now act

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:02:57.246 --> 01:03:01.866 A:middle
Another exciting change in
Mavericks is the TVs can now act

01:03:01.866 --> 01:03:04.066 A:middle
as fully independent
displays via AirPlay.

01:03:04.066 --> 01:03:05.606 A:middle
AirPlay is not limited

01:03:05.606 --> 01:03:07.366 A:middle
to mirroring the
primary screen anymore.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:09.886 A:middle
That opens up whole new
ways for you to innovate.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:13.456 A:middle
If your apps would benefit from
the special presenter display,

01:03:14.026 --> 01:03:16.016 A:middle
AirPlay is now an even
more attractive option.

01:03:16.366 --> 01:03:17.426 A:middle
We're looking very much forward

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.376 A:middle
to the new ideas you guys
are going to come up with

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:21.006 A:middle
to leverage this new capability.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.176 A:middle
Next is Map Kit.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.616 A:middle
If you brought Map
Kit over to the Mac,

01:03:27.616 --> 01:03:30.476 A:middle
that's practically the
identical API that many

01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:32.556 A:middle
of you are already
familiar with from iOS.

01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:35.496 A:middle
So you can now have beautiful
fast vector-based maps

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.466 A:middle
integrated with your
Mac apps as well.

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:40.786 A:middle
In addition to creating the
actual maps application,

01:03:41.116 --> 01:03:43.066 A:middle
they started using this
new API [inaudible]

01:03:43.066 --> 01:03:44.416 A:middle
in Mavericks in various ways.

01:03:44.976 --> 01:03:46.796 A:middle
For example, by adding
a new data detector,

01:03:47.136 --> 01:03:49.596 A:middle
all by supporting map
locations in the calendar app.

01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:54.426 A:middle
Map Kit is a really fantastic
edition to the OS X API.

01:03:54.426 --> 01:03:57.966 A:middle
And just like with our other
cloud services based APIs,

01:03:58.386 --> 01:04:00.826 A:middle
it's available to apps shipping
through the Mac App Store

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:03:58.386 --> 01:04:00.826 A:middle
it's available to apps shipping
through the Mac App Store

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:03.206 A:middle
that declare the use of
Map Kit as a capability.

01:04:03.826 --> 01:04:08.376 A:middle
Now, there's numerous
more APIs in Mavericks

01:04:08.456 --> 01:04:10.156 A:middle
that I do not have time
to cover in this session.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.866 A:middle
AppKit has a fantastic
new stack view.

01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:15.106 A:middle
They even added things
like vec notifications.

01:04:15.486 --> 01:04:18.286 A:middle
But you'll also push
notifications to a Mac even

01:04:18.286 --> 01:04:20.026 A:middle
if you don't have a
native application for it.

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.966 A:middle
You can learn about
many of these APIs here

01:04:22.966 --> 01:04:24.266 A:middle
in later sessions
at the conference.

01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:27.156 A:middle
But for now, I'm going to
hand over to Matthew Firlik

01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:28.676 A:middle
to tell you more about Xcode 5.

[ Applause ]

01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:38.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Andreas.

01:04:39.696 --> 01:04:42.176 A:middle
Xcode 5 is our latest
tools release

01:04:42.506 --> 01:04:44.846 A:middle
for iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

01:04:45.056 --> 01:04:47.916 A:middle
And it is packed with features
I think you guys are going

01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:49.416 A:middle
to love.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:53.016 A:middle
From the earlier demonstrations
you've seen Xcode's new clean

01:04:53.116 --> 01:04:54.076 A:middle
interface design.

01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:58.706 A:middle
This design surfaces Xcode's
familiar workflows and features.

01:04:58.706 --> 01:05:01.716 A:middle
It works to minimize clatter
and really put the focus

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:58.706 --> 01:05:01.716 A:middle
It works to minimize clatter
and really put the focus

01:05:01.756 --> 01:05:04.606 A:middle
on the controls and
your content.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.756 A:middle
To highlight your content,

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:09.406 A:middle
we'd worked to reduce
the application chrome.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.356 A:middle
Compared with the
previous release,

01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:13.756 A:middle
our toolbar is 30
percent smaller.

01:05:14.236 --> 01:05:16.236 A:middle
And its work is great
on small displays.

01:05:18.276 --> 01:05:20.526 A:middle
We've also focused on
improving the activity view.

01:05:20.946 --> 01:05:24.116 A:middle
You now see more details for
your activities, bigger icons

01:05:24.116 --> 01:05:27.766 A:middle
for issues, and overall
progress is much easier to see.

01:05:28.296 --> 01:05:31.896 A:middle
And throughout the interface,
you'll see our design focuses

01:05:31.896 --> 01:05:36.066 A:middle
on removing borders, simplifying
items, and through this use

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.246 A:middle
of a simple blue highlight
presenting a feeling

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:40.886 A:middle
of seamlessness and
fluidity throughout the ID.

01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:45.316 A:middle
Now, a focus on simplicity
does not mean a lost

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.636 A:middle
in functionality, actually
quite to the contrary.

01:05:48.096 --> 01:05:49.566 A:middle
In most cases, we were able

01:05:49.566 --> 01:05:52.356 A:middle
to put more functionality
in a smaller space.

01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:54.466 A:middle
The UI for looking

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:56.776 A:middle
at project-wide finds is
a really good example.

to put the same functionality
in less than half of the space.

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:09.446 A:middle
And in a way that is
far easier to use.

01:06:10.706 --> 01:06:12.866 A:middle
Now, with the additional real
estate, we wanted to bring

01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:15.276 A:middle
to the surface even
more of your content.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.886 A:middle
In the previous Xcode release,
search results were shown

01:06:19.096 --> 01:06:20.836 A:middle
at a single line displace.

01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:23.516 A:middle
Xcode 5, we're bringing
in wrapping.

01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:26.946 A:middle
So, now, you can see even more
context for your search results.

[ Applause ]

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:33.706 A:middle
And if that wasn't enough

01:06:33.706 --> 01:06:36.176 A:middle
for bringing the same
display to issues as well.

01:06:36.486 --> 01:06:37.596 A:middle
So for errors and warnings --

01:06:43.676 --> 01:06:45.886 A:middle
-- not that that you have
issues, but for all the errors

01:06:45.886 --> 01:06:48.146 A:middle
and warnings that might come
up for all the other guys,

01:06:48.396 --> 01:06:49.706 A:middle
you can see all of the details.

01:06:51.356 --> 01:06:54.936 A:middle
Now, another area of focus
for us is documentation.

01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:57.226 A:middle
And we have a brand
new interface for you.

01:06:58.076 --> 01:07:01.406 A:middle
Documentation is now its own
separate window using all

Documentation is now its own
separate window using all

01:07:01.406 --> 01:07:02.396 A:middle
of the new design elements.

01:07:03.316 --> 01:07:05.676 A:middle
Now, on top of some great
documentation content,

01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:08.206 A:middle
you now have better
and faster searching,

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:11.756 A:middle
scrollable search results,
tab based browsing,

01:07:12.186 --> 01:07:14.376 A:middle
and a great book marking
system so you can work

01:07:14.376 --> 01:07:16.436 A:middle
with multiple documents
really easily.

01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:25.056 A:middle
And if that wasn't enough,
once you find a document

01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:27.006 A:middle
that you like, the
new integrated table

01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:29.076 A:middle
of contents makes it
really easy to browse

01:07:29.116 --> 01:07:29.926 A:middle
and navigate the content.

[ Applause ]

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:38.196 A:middle
You'll see elements of a new
design throughout our interface,

01:07:38.396 --> 01:07:41.656 A:middle
and it really focuses
on surfacing the value

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:44.876 A:middle
of the technologies that are
underneath because the same time

01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:47.516 A:middle
that we are changing things
you can see on the front end.

01:07:47.866 --> 01:07:50.946 A:middle
We were doing a lot of work
on the back ends too in ways

01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:54.056 A:middle
that you won't be able to see
but you will definitely feel.

01:07:55.286 --> 01:07:56.696 A:middle
Xcode 5 has been converted

01:07:56.696 --> 01:07:59.056 A:middle
over to Automatic
Reference Counting or ARC.

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:01.036 A:middle
And as part of this transition,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:01.036 A:middle
And as part of this transition,

01:08:01.316 --> 01:08:03.786 A:middle
we have some awesome performance
wins to share with you.

01:08:04.866 --> 01:08:08.436 A:middle
Many of the tasks, new perform
every day, are much faster

01:08:08.436 --> 01:08:10.676 A:middle
in Xcode 5, things
like searching

01:08:10.676 --> 01:08:13.196 A:middle
and incremental builds
are up to twice as fast.

01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:16.095 A:middle
And working with tabs, devices,

01:08:16.156 --> 01:08:18.395 A:middle
and project editor
is quicker than ever.

[ Applause ]

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:27.676 A:middle
Inside and out, Xcode
5 really sings.

01:08:28.926 --> 01:08:31.466 A:middle
So on top of the new UI
and its great foundation

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:34.805 A:middle
of faster technologies, we've
built some amazing new features.

01:08:35.076 --> 01:08:37.206 A:middle
And it starts with
interface design.

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:42.026 A:middle
Xcode 5 provides access to
the latest views and controls

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.296 A:middle
for iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.725 A:middle
So, you can get started today
using all of these new UIs

01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:49.616 A:middle
and features in your
application.

01:08:50.696 --> 01:08:54.206 A:middle
And, Max demonstrated three new
editions to our design tools.

01:08:54.606 --> 01:08:57.636 A:middle
The new workflow for Auto
Layout, the Asset Catalog,

01:08:58.006 --> 01:08:59.826 A:middle
and the new Preview
Assistant for iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:00.935 --> 01:09:03.196 A:middle
These features in concert
with other editions

01:09:03.196 --> 01:09:05.416 A:middle
to interface builder,
make it easy for you

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:08.316 A:middle
to design applications
that look and feel great

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:09.746 A:middle
for all of your users.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:12.805 A:middle
Now, Mac still a little
bit of the Thunder 2

01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:15.076 A:middle
and showed you another
great addition to Xcode 5

01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.236 A:middle
in the form of debug gauges.

01:09:18.326 --> 01:09:20.046 A:middle
The debug gauges
provide a way for you

01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:23.756 A:middle
to ensure your application is
behaving exactly as you expect.

01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:27.866 A:middle
You now have CPU memory and
other information available

01:09:27.866 --> 01:09:32.015 A:middle
to you at a glance and in a way
that is really easy to track.

01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:36.446 A:middle
The integrative reports
provide even more detail

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:38.106 A:middle
on the performance
of your application.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:40.416 A:middle
So you can dig in
when issues arise.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:45.886 A:middle
Now, as Max noted, the gauges
perform high level profiling

01:09:45.996 --> 01:09:48.856 A:middle
in a super efficient manner
so as not to interrupt

01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:50.746 A:middle
with your own applications
performance.

01:09:51.356 --> 01:09:52.776 A:middle
But when you need
more information,

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:55.556 A:middle
the power of instruments
is just a click away.

01:09:56.086 --> 01:09:58.586 A:middle
We'll launch a session
automatically configured

01:09:58.616 --> 01:10:01.406 A:middle
to your application and
you'll get all the information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:58.616 --> 01:10:01.406 A:middle
to your application and
you'll get all the information

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:02.606 A:middle
you need.

01:10:03.376 --> 01:10:09.066 A:middle
Now we have gauges for CPU,
memory and energy and two others

01:10:09.066 --> 01:10:11.356 A:middle
in the form of iCloud
and OpenGL ES.

01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:14.936 A:middle
And these gauges present
themselves automatically

01:10:15.206 --> 01:10:16.676 A:middle
when you start using
these technologies.

01:10:17.756 --> 01:10:20.076 A:middle
So we think debug gauges are
going to be a great way for you

01:10:20.076 --> 01:10:23.726 A:middle
to monitor, maintain, and
improve the performance

01:10:23.956 --> 01:10:24.846 A:middle
for your applications.

01:10:26.176 --> 01:10:28.446 A:middle
But we didn't stop there
because we have some other great

01:10:28.446 --> 01:10:30.836 A:middle
additions to the
debugging technologies.

01:10:31.316 --> 01:10:34.346 A:middle
First up, our debugging
services.

01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:38.356 A:middle
Xcode provides new functionality
to help you during development.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:41.576 A:middle
For example, we can
simulate a backgroundd fetch

01:10:41.776 --> 01:10:44.996 A:middle
for iOS 7 making it really easy
for you to adapt to the new API.

01:10:46.506 --> 01:10:50.016 A:middle
We can also simulate location
changes for iOS and OS X

01:10:50.676 --> 01:10:54.136 A:middle
which are great to use with
colocation and with maps.

01:10:54.956 --> 01:10:56.066 A:middle
And a cocoa view debugging

01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:58.926 A:middle
that Max demonstrated before
is a great way for you

01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:00.526 A:middle
to be interactive
with your application

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:00.526 A:middle
to be interactive
with your application

01:11:00.946 --> 01:11:04.976 A:middle
and see things you might
not been able to before.

01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:08.676 A:middle
Another area of focus for us was
on presentation of variables.

01:11:09.756 --> 01:11:13.016 A:middle
A new variables view is
simple, clean, and compact.

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.406 A:middle
And the improvements of the data
formatters really highlight the

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:17.506 A:middle
essential information.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.786 A:middle
But, we know that not all
objects present themselves well

01:11:21.786 --> 01:11:23.816 A:middle
in summary or in textural form.

01:11:24.426 --> 01:11:26.656 A:middle
So for this release we've
integrated a technology

01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:29.476 A:middle
that should be very familiar
to you right in the debugger

01:11:29.956 --> 01:11:32.366 A:middle
in the form of Quick Look.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:36.006 A:middle
Now, in the variables
view and in the editor

01:11:36.866 --> 01:11:39.156 A:middle
across every variable, you
will see a Quick Look button.

01:11:39.746 --> 01:11:41.156 A:middle
And in this case, a poke

01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:43.066 A:middle
in the eye is actually
a really good thing.

01:11:44.616 --> 01:11:47.726 A:middle
We now have Quick Look support
for common geometric types

01:11:47.726 --> 01:11:50.906 A:middle
like points, rects,
sizes, and bezier paths.

Working with plain or
rich text, super easy.

01:12:03.956 --> 01:12:07.246 A:middle
Media types like images present
themselves really naturally.

01:12:08.646 --> 01:12:11.886 A:middle
Object types like Pads
and URLs actually resolve

01:12:11.886 --> 01:12:13.996 A:middle
to their remote content
whether it's a website

01:12:14.216 --> 01:12:15.526 A:middle
or a local document.

And when running
on OS X Mavericks,

01:12:22.146 --> 01:12:25.226 A:middle
locations present themselves
using the gorgeous new map view.

01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:29.606 A:middle
These are just a few

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.906 A:middle
of the Quick Look support
we've innovated in the debugger

01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:34.456 A:middle
and I'm absolutely certain you
guys are going to love this.

01:12:35.896 --> 01:12:39.466 A:middle
So the combination of debug
gauges, debug services,

01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:42.486 A:middle
and the Quick Look for
variables, all great ways

01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:44.066 A:middle
for you guys to get
more information

01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:45.326 A:middle
about your applications.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.196 A:middle
Now, debugging is generally

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:50.586 A:middle
about getting your application
into a working state.

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:54.616 A:middle
In contrast, unit testing is
about keeping it in that state.

01:12:55.856 --> 01:12:58.456 A:middle
We feel that testing is a
really essential component

01:12:58.606 --> 01:12:59.976 A:middle
to writing a great application.

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.546 A:middle
we're providing some new
powerful testing tools

for you to use.

little bit more,

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:18.266 A:middle
So here we have the
Adventure project that Max

01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:19.206 A:middle
and I have been working on.

01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:22.006 A:middle
Max has been adding some of
the configuration screens.

01:13:22.056 --> 01:13:25.086 A:middle
I've been working on adding
some new villainous characters

01:13:25.086 --> 01:13:26.646 A:middle
and some additional
game play options.

01:13:27.586 --> 01:13:29.926 A:middle
Now along the way, Max and I
have been writing unit tests

01:13:30.466 --> 01:13:32.276 A:middle
to make sure that
we're staying on track

01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:33.336 A:middle
and then we're not regressing.

01:13:33.936 --> 01:13:34.666 A:middle
And we've been using some

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.606 A:middle
of the new features
of Xcode 5 with that.

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.516 A:middle
One of the new features
I've been using is the new

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:41.576 A:middle
test navigator.

01:13:42.496 --> 01:13:43.886 A:middle
When I select here on
the left hand side,

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.446 A:middle
the test navigator now
shows you all of the tests

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:50.026 A:middle
for your project organized by
test class and by test case,

01:13:50.336 --> 01:13:53.236 A:middle
making it really easy for you
to navigate and select an item.

01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:57.376 A:middle
The navigator can show you all
of your tests or just the ones

01:13:57.606 --> 01:13:59.136 A:middle
that are configured for
your current scheme.

01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:02.606 A:middle
Now as you might expect,
I made some changes

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.496 A:middle
to my project right
before coming up on stage.

01:14:04.826 --> 01:14:07.046 A:middle
And I like to see how I'm doing.

01:14:07.896 --> 01:14:10.436 A:middle
So we'll go ahead and
perform the test command here

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:11.646 A:middle
and see the results.

01:14:12.396 --> 01:14:14.446 A:middle
And you can see that
the status for all

01:14:14.446 --> 01:14:17.016 A:middle
of my tests is now displayed
in the test navigator.

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.566 A:middle
All of the passing
tests are in green

01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:21.366 A:middle
and the failing tests
are in red.

01:14:22.116 --> 01:14:24.836 A:middle
We can see I have a couple red
icons here so we know that --

01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.906 A:middle
I probably shouldn't check
this code in quite yet.

01:14:28.356 --> 01:14:31.376 A:middle
Let's select one of
the failing tests.

01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:35.086 A:middle
This test is testing that
the chase radius for one

01:14:35.086 --> 01:14:37.076 A:middle
of my anime characters
is actually larger

01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:39.226 A:middle
than the character himself,
seems to make sense.

01:14:40.126 --> 01:14:41.776 A:middle
I'd like to actually
debug this test

01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:43.046 A:middle
to figure out why it's failing.

01:14:43.576 --> 01:14:46.326 A:middle
And to do that, I'm going to
use a new feature of Xcode 5.

01:14:47.076 --> 01:14:48.386 A:middle
I'll put a breakpoint
in my test.

01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:50.876 A:middle
But in order to just
work on this one test,

01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:53.156 A:middle
I'll hover over this indicator.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.666 A:middle
And you'll see it turns
into a play button.

01:14:55.446 --> 01:14:58.116 A:middle
This gives me the ability
to run just this one test.

[ Applause ]

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:07.466 A:middle
Actually, this feature
is even cooler.

01:15:07.996 --> 01:15:10.076 A:middle
Anywhere you see this
status icons you get the

01:15:10.076 --> 01:15:11.066 A:middle
same functionality.

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:12.506 A:middle
So if I clicked on the icon

01:15:12.506 --> 01:15:14.846 A:middle
at the class level it
would perform all the tests

01:15:14.846 --> 01:15:17.586 A:middle
in the class at the
bundle level, all the tests

01:15:17.586 --> 01:15:18.756 A:middle
with a bundle and so forth.

01:15:19.606 --> 01:15:21.346 A:middle
For this case, I just
want to run this one test.

01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:24.296 A:middle
So I click here, and
it's going to build

01:15:24.296 --> 01:15:25.886 A:middle
and now I'm stopped
here right into my test.

01:15:27.746 --> 01:15:30.456 A:middle
To debug this a little further,
I want to get some information

01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:33.036 A:middle
on the variables to make sure
that the values are as I expect.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.756 A:middle
I'll hover over the
chase radius here

01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:38.186 A:middle
and if you can look really
closely, a little tool that pop

01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:40.816 A:middle
up showing that that the value
is 8,000, that's correct,

01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:42.226 A:middle
that's what I expected to be.

01:15:43.216 --> 01:15:44.996 A:middle
Let's take a look
at this next piece.

01:15:44.996 --> 01:15:46.546 A:middle
I have an image for
the character.

01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:48.206 A:middle
I want to make sure
that it's the right one.

01:15:48.826 --> 01:15:51.676 A:middle
I'll hover over it and click
the little Quick Look icon

01:15:52.016 --> 01:15:52.576 A:middle
and there we go.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:53.976 A:middle
There is a picture of my boss.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:58.726 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.416 A:middle
Actually, I want to
clarify a second.

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.416 A:middle
Actually, I want to
clarify a second.

01:16:00.496 --> 01:16:01.856 A:middle
I said that's a picture
of my boss.

01:16:02.126 --> 01:16:04.136 A:middle
It's not actually a picture
of my boss, it's picture

01:16:04.136 --> 01:16:06.506 A:middle
of the character in the game.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:06.956 A:middle
All right.

01:16:07.226 --> 01:16:07.906 A:middle
Let's move on.

01:16:08.576 --> 01:16:10.456 A:middle
I can also check the size

01:16:10.456 --> 01:16:12.856 A:middle
of the character is correct
and that looks right.

01:16:12.856 --> 01:16:14.296 A:middle
You know what?

01:16:14.296 --> 01:16:15.166 A:middle
I see the problem here.

01:16:15.206 --> 01:16:16.536 A:middle
It's actually just
a logic error.

01:16:16.946 --> 01:16:18.766 A:middle
I use greater than
instead of less than.

01:16:19.296 --> 01:16:22.516 A:middle
So let me fix that and
remove my breakpoint.

01:16:22.976 --> 01:16:24.676 A:middle
And let's run the test
again to make sure

01:16:24.676 --> 01:16:27.286 A:middle
that that fix is correct.

01:16:27.436 --> 01:16:29.316 A:middle
And sure enough,
my test succeeds,

01:16:29.396 --> 01:16:32.056 A:middle
the indication is updated and
now I know that I can move on.

01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:35.126 A:middle
So just like that I was able
to use the navigator to get

01:16:35.126 --> 01:16:37.766 A:middle
to my tests that are failing,
used the status indication

01:16:37.766 --> 01:16:40.256 A:middle
in your workflows to
focus on this one test.

01:16:41.966 --> 01:16:44.386 A:middle
Now, we've seen the navigator,
I have some other failing tests.

01:16:44.906 --> 01:16:47.066 A:middle
They're little bit strewn
out across my project.

01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:49.406 A:middle
I'm going to turn on
the filter at the bottom

01:16:49.406 --> 01:16:51.856 A:middle
of the test navigator to show
me only the failing tests.

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:55.826 A:middle
Now, I see here that I
have three or four tests

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:59.766 A:middle
that look all the same and
are failing in a similar way.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:17:00.156 --> 01:17:02.416 A:middle
Earlier, I added some new
functionality to the game,

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:04.446 A:middle
a new way for anime characters

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:05.846 A:middle
to meet their maker,
so to speak.

01:17:06.196 --> 01:17:07.986 A:middle
It's affectionately known
as splort [phonetic].

01:17:08.296 --> 01:17:10.796 A:middle
You can imagine what it does.

01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:13.896 A:middle
To test for this, I first
look for the characters health

01:17:14.006 --> 01:17:17.816 A:middle
to be non-zero beforehand,
tell them to splort

01:17:17.906 --> 01:17:20.466 A:middle
and then test afterwards
to see that is zero.

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.206 A:middle
This test is failing.

01:17:22.936 --> 01:17:24.816 A:middle
Now the test itself
is relatively simple,

01:17:25.116 --> 01:17:26.686 A:middle
so it's probably
somewhere in my AppLogic.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:29.166 A:middle
That's okay, we can take a look.

01:17:30.226 --> 01:17:32.906 A:middle
I'll command click on the
API to jump right to it.

01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:35.996 A:middle
And this kind of highlights
are really interesting scenario

01:17:36.066 --> 01:17:37.986 A:middle
where sometimes you'll
be working on your tests

01:17:38.586 --> 01:17:40.056 A:middle
and sometimes you'll
be working on your API.

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:42.696 A:middle
But often you want to
correlate between the two.

01:17:42.696 --> 01:17:44.926 A:middle
To make sure you're
making decisions correctly

01:17:45.176 --> 01:17:45.916 A:middle
on both sides.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.086 A:middle
Xcode 5 provides a really
great way to do this.

01:17:50.296 --> 01:17:51.326 A:middle
Let's collapse the navigator

01:17:51.326 --> 01:17:52.556 A:middle
to give ourselves
a little more room.

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:56.506 A:middle
With -- my focus inside of
this method, I'm going to click

01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:59.286 A:middle
on the related files
pop-up here and we'll see

01:17:59.286 --> 01:18:00.636 A:middle
that there are two
new categories.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:17:59.286 --> 01:18:00.636 A:middle
that there are two
new categories.

01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.446 A:middle
Test classes and test colors.

01:18:04.366 --> 01:18:06.936 A:middle
I'm going to hold on the Option
key and select the test colors,

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.706 A:middle
and have it opened up
in the assistant editor.

01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:10.476 A:middle
Now, what is this showing me?

01:18:11.036 --> 01:18:13.406 A:middle
It's showing me on the
left hand side my API.

01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:15.556 A:middle
And the right hand side,
it's showing the tests

01:18:15.756 --> 01:18:17.316 A:middle
that directly call that API.

01:18:17.976 --> 01:18:19.576 A:middle
Making it really easier
for me to correlate.

01:18:21.356 --> 01:18:23.016 A:middle
And actually, this is
really helpful in this case

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:25.646 A:middle
because I see that my test
is testing for health,

01:18:26.146 --> 01:18:27.966 A:middle
but I don't actually
use that value any

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:29.296 A:middle
over here in my actual method.

01:18:29.776 --> 01:18:31.706 A:middle
And it turns out
that's my fault.

01:18:31.966 --> 01:18:33.696 A:middle
What I forgot to do
was to call super,

01:18:33.696 --> 01:18:35.346 A:middle
when I implemented this method.

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:37.456 A:middle
So let's go ahead and fix that.

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:39.726 A:middle
And while I'm still
in the assistant here,

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.366 A:middle
I'll just run my other tests.

01:18:42.526 --> 01:18:43.786 A:middle
Sure enough, that was the fix.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.026 A:middle
We'll use the power of this
system here to just flip

01:18:46.026 --> 01:18:49.276 A:middle
to the next one and make sure
that that one is fixed too and,

01:18:49.276 --> 01:18:50.266 A:middle
yep that was my problem.

01:18:51.066 --> 01:18:54.046 A:middle
So just like that, I was able
to correlate my API and my tests

01:18:54.636 --> 01:18:56.796 A:middle
and work with them
together to fix my problem.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:59.356 A:middle
So that was just a
quick view of some

01:18:59.356 --> 01:19:01.526 A:middle
of the great new testing
features in Xcode 5.

features in Xcode 5.

01:19:02.246 --> 01:19:02.946 A:middle
Let's go back to slides.

[ Applause ]

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:17.186 A:middle
So the new unit testing features
of Xcode, the test navigator,

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:19.916 A:middle
the assistant editor, and the
new workflow integrations,

01:19:20.396 --> 01:19:23.626 A:middle
all great ways for you to
make testing a seamless part

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:24.876 A:middle
of your development workflow.

01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:30.566 A:middle
Now, another investment for
us in the area of testing was

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:31.966 A:middle
in the test framework itself.

01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:33.446 A:middle
And for this release,

01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:35.716 A:middle
we are announcing a
new framework XC test.

01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:39.016 A:middle
XC test is derived from OCUnit.

01:19:39.726 --> 01:19:42.036 A:middle
And for this release we've
made some minor enhancements.

01:19:42.816 --> 01:19:45.196 A:middle
Going forward, XC test
will be our vehicle

01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:47.586 A:middle
for providing great
testing features for you.

01:19:48.476 --> 01:19:50.686 A:middle
Now Xcode 5 continues
to include OC unit

01:19:51.116 --> 01:19:53.636 A:middle
and it includes a powerful
migration utility for you

01:19:53.636 --> 01:19:56.156 A:middle
to convert over whenever
you're ready.

01:19:57.356 --> 01:19:59.666 A:middle
Now, from all the
feedback you've provided,

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.486 A:middle
the number one request
you've had in the area

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.486 A:middle
the number one request
you've had in the area

01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:05.066 A:middle
of testing is better
ways to integrate it

01:20:05.206 --> 01:20:06.416 A:middle
into your automation systems.

01:20:07.146 --> 01:20:09.786 A:middle
And with Xcode 5, we have
a great new option for you

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:11.906 A:middle
in the form of command
line testing.

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:17.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:20.296 A:middle
I didn't know a terminal
window is so exciting.

01:20:22.036 --> 01:20:25.086 A:middle
The test command is now fully
supported from the command line.

01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:28.906 A:middle
And this command mirrors the
test action inside of the IDE.

01:20:29.456 --> 01:20:31.346 A:middle
So, your investment in
setting up your schemes

01:20:31.346 --> 01:20:34.746 A:middle
and your test plans now pay
off beautifully inside the IDE

01:20:35.326 --> 01:20:35.726 A:middle
and out.

01:20:36.946 --> 01:20:37.736 A:middle
The command allows you

01:20:37.736 --> 01:20:39.696 A:middle
to specify the destination
you'd like.

01:20:40.046 --> 01:20:42.456 A:middle
So, for example, you can
target one of the simulators.

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:46.136 A:middle
As you might expect, you can
also target a connected device.

01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:48.746 A:middle
And, as a little
gift to you guys,

01:20:48.746 --> 01:20:51.006 A:middle
you can also specify
multiple destinations

01:20:51.266 --> 01:20:52.416 A:middle
in a single invocation.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:07.726 A:middle
Your Apple ID is your
identity, but it's also your key

01:21:07.726 --> 01:21:08.816 A:middle
to communicating with Apple.

01:21:09.456 --> 01:21:11.906 A:middle
And for this release we've
made Apple IDs simple

01:21:12.266 --> 01:21:14.326 A:middle
and more powerful to use.

01:21:14.896 --> 01:21:19.306 A:middle
Xcode 5 now includes a new
Accounts pane to manage all

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:21.126 A:middle
of the Accounts that
the ID will use.

01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:24.876 A:middle
Entering your Apple ID
gives you access to all

01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:27.376 A:middle
of the assets necessary
for App Store development.

And for those amongst you
who have multiple Apple IDs,

01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:33.176 A:middle
you can enter them all into
the panel here and select

01:21:45.646 --> 01:21:46.876 A:middle
And to take things
a step further,

01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:48.936 A:middle
we've built some great
functionality on top of this

01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:52.086 A:middle
in the form of Automatic
Project Configuration.

01:21:52.586 --> 01:21:55.316 A:middle
Wrong button there.

01:21:59.616 --> 01:22:02.126 A:middle
So, with each platform release,

01:22:02.806 --> 01:22:05.486 A:middle
we give you guys amazing new
features and capabilities,

01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:08.716 A:middle
each with their own options and
also with some requirements.

01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:11.006 A:middle
And we wanted to make it
really easy for you guys

01:22:11.036 --> 01:22:12.466 A:middle
to get started with
these features.

01:22:12.976 --> 01:22:13.976 A:middle
So, we've built a section

01:22:13.976 --> 01:22:16.816 A:middle
of the Project Editor
dedicated directly to each

01:22:16.816 --> 01:22:19.716 A:middle
of these capabilities with
all the necessary requirements

01:22:19.716 --> 01:22:21.266 A:middle
and options in one place.

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:24.956 A:middle
And getting started with
the feature is really easy.

01:22:25.476 --> 01:22:27.856 A:middle
It's a simple matter
of flipping a switch.

01:22:28.746 --> 01:22:31.876 A:middle
Doing so, let's extra -- make
all of the necessary changes

01:22:32.076 --> 01:22:33.496 A:middle
to set up your machine
for development.

01:22:33.996 --> 01:22:36.956 A:middle
That includes changing project
settings, adding frameworks,

01:22:37.226 --> 01:22:40.256 A:middle
setting entitlements, and
making all of the requests

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:42.606 A:middle
and downloads necessary
for App IDs,

01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:44.926 A:middle
provisioning profiles,
and certificates.

[ Applause ]

01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:58.416 A:middle
From start to finish, you
can stay in Xcode and focus

01:22:58.416 --> 01:22:59.596 A:middle
on the work you want to do

01:22:59.866 --> 01:23:03.136 A:middle
and frankly let Xcode do
all of this work for you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:22:59.866 --> 01:23:03.136 A:middle
and frankly let Xcode do
all of this work for you.

01:23:03.696 --> 01:23:08.246 A:middle
We wanted to provide also some
great source control features

01:23:08.246 --> 01:23:09.026 A:middle
for you to use.

01:23:09.326 --> 01:23:11.716 A:middle
And in order to do
that, we re-imagined

01:23:11.716 --> 01:23:14.606 A:middle
and redesigned our workflows
to integrate them directly

01:23:14.606 --> 01:23:16.256 A:middle
into the project life cycle.

01:23:17.846 --> 01:23:21.176 A:middle
In Xcode 5, you will find a new
top-level Source Control menu

01:23:21.456 --> 01:23:24.456 A:middle
with all of the options you
need and accessible at any time

01:23:24.756 --> 01:23:25.926 A:middle
in a really simple manner.

01:23:27.216 --> 01:23:29.276 A:middle
When you want to access the
project for the first time,

01:23:29.356 --> 01:23:31.946 A:middle
the new checkout workflow
makes that really easy.

01:23:32.486 --> 01:23:35.546 A:middle
Select the repository, select
the branch, and Xcode will check

01:23:35.546 --> 01:23:37.256 A:middle
out your project
and open it for you.

01:23:38.456 --> 01:23:39.876 A:middle
Now, once you have
the project open,

01:23:40.096 --> 01:23:42.516 A:middle
you'll notice the new working
copies area of the menu.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:45.676 A:middle
This provides a list of all the
working copies you have opened

01:23:45.676 --> 01:23:48.996 A:middle
in your project plus their
current branches, making it easy

01:23:48.996 --> 01:23:50.806 A:middle
for you to keep track of
what you're working on.

01:23:52.136 --> 01:23:54.546 A:middle
The Associated Branch
menu gives you all

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:56.396 A:middle
of the branch management
functions you need,

01:23:56.476 --> 01:23:59.296 A:middle
such as creating new
branches, switching branches,

01:23:59.586 --> 01:24:02.106 A:middle
and merging right from
inside the project workflow.

and merging right from
inside the project workflow.

And when you want more detailed
information about what's changed

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:06.956 A:middle
in your working copy,

01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:09.736 A:middle
the Integrative History
View provides a browsable

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:12.626 A:middle
and searchable display
that works across all

01:24:12.626 --> 01:24:13.356 A:middle
of your working copies.

01:24:15.466 --> 01:24:17.316 A:middle
For this release,
we've really focused

01:24:17.316 --> 01:24:19.406 A:middle
on giving you guys great
Source Control tools.

01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:21.326 A:middle
We've added functionality
to the editor,

01:24:21.426 --> 01:24:24.826 A:middle
giving you the preferences
and integrated Subversion 1.7.

01:24:25.646 --> 01:24:27.866 A:middle
So, for all of you not
using Source Control today,

01:24:28.026 --> 01:24:33.666 A:middle
I highly recommend you guys
give this new features a try.

01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:34.976 A:middle
Continuous integration.

01:24:36.246 --> 01:24:38.016 A:middle
For those of you not
familiar with this term,

01:24:38.216 --> 01:24:41.466 A:middle
Continuous integration is the
practice of taking changes

01:24:41.466 --> 01:24:44.036 A:middle
from many developers and
merging them frequently.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:47.136 A:middle
Ensuring the code
builds, your tests pass,

01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:49.706 A:middle
and that generally your
project meets your requirements.

01:24:50.566 --> 01:24:54.326 A:middle
By integrating frequently,
you can minimize the effect

01:24:54.326 --> 01:24:58.466 A:middle
of any individual change, often
known as integration hell.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:01.466 --> 01:25:04.796 A:middle
Now integration systems need to
provide a myriad of features.

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:07.056 A:middle
And they need to fit well
in your development process.

01:25:08.376 --> 01:25:09.776 A:middle
One item that is often missing

01:25:09.776 --> 01:25:12.906 A:middle
from these systems is
tight IDE Integration,

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:16.056 A:middle
which you want are
continuous integration systems

01:25:16.056 --> 01:25:18.656 A:middle
that are an extension of
your development process.

01:25:19.266 --> 01:25:20.296 A:middle
In fact, you want them built

01:25:20.296 --> 01:25:22.216 A:middle
on the native concepts
of your tools.

01:25:23.646 --> 01:25:26.086 A:middle
And for Xcode 5, that's
exactly what we've done

01:25:26.316 --> 01:25:28.136 A:middle
in the form of bots.

Cool icon, even cooler
technology.

01:25:38.816 --> 01:25:41.196 A:middle
Bots are continuous
integration systems that --

01:25:41.696 --> 01:25:44.736 A:middle
well, bots are tasks and
they run on OS X server.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:48.746 A:middle
And their primary reason for
being is to do your bidding.

01:25:49.696 --> 01:25:52.076 A:middle
So bots use the Xcode
5 technologies

01:25:52.226 --> 01:25:54.706 A:middle
to perform integrations,
which are sorts of tasks

01:25:55.536 --> 01:25:57.686 A:middle
like build, test, and analyze.

01:25:58.526 --> 01:26:00.666 A:middle
And to get to what the final
-- the slide finally says here,

01:25:58.526 --> 01:26:00.666 A:middle
And to get to what the final
-- the slide finally says here,

01:26:00.666 --> 01:26:02.976 A:middle
I'm going to show you a
demo of how bots work.

01:26:08.756 --> 01:26:12.546 A:middle
So here I have the iOS
version of a project.

01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:16.446 A:middle
Now, behind the scenes here,
my team has set up a Mac mini

01:26:16.876 --> 01:26:18.636 A:middle
and installed the
latest OS X server.

01:26:19.316 --> 01:26:22.246 A:middle
And we've created bots for all
of the projects that we're going

01:26:22.246 --> 01:26:23.956 A:middle
to use throughout WWDC.

01:26:25.186 --> 01:26:26.646 A:middle
For me to take advantage
of the bot,

01:26:26.816 --> 01:26:30.066 A:middle
all I need to do is add the
account to this Xcode instance.

01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:32.626 A:middle
So I'll bring up
my preferences here

01:26:32.986 --> 01:26:34.336 A:middle
and we see the new
Accounts pane.

01:26:35.786 --> 01:26:37.746 A:middle
I'll click the plus
sign and say Add Server.

01:26:37.746 --> 01:26:42.556 A:middle
Now we see that on my Mac mini
is broadcasting over Bonjour.

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:47.296 A:middle
I can select that and I'll enter
my extremely secure credentials.

01:26:48.506 --> 01:26:52.426 A:middle
Now, when I click Add,
I want you to watch

01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:54.706 A:middle
in the left hand side in
the project navigator.

01:26:55.286 --> 01:26:57.496 A:middle
You see when I click
Add, a new item appears.

01:26:58.066 --> 01:26:59.386 A:middle
That's my bot.

01:27:00.956 --> 01:27:02.946 A:middle
What we're seeing here
is the log navigator

01:27:03.006 --> 01:27:05.296 A:middle
which normally presents
all of your local actions.

01:27:06.056 --> 01:27:08.326 A:middle
We wanted to integrate the
bot into the log navigator

01:27:08.326 --> 01:27:10.506 A:middle
so you could correlate what
the bot is doing for you

01:27:10.776 --> 01:27:12.146 A:middle
with all the work
you see locally.

01:27:13.746 --> 01:27:16.466 A:middle
Selecting the bot is going to
show me the integration summary.

01:27:17.056 --> 01:27:17.676 A:middle
And here it is.

01:27:18.216 --> 01:27:19.976 A:middle
And there's a lot of
information going on here.

[ Applause ]

01:27:24.716 --> 01:27:27.076 A:middle
Across the top, you're seeing
the integration results.

01:27:27.516 --> 01:27:29.806 A:middle
These are the kind of
statistics of the last run --

01:27:30.276 --> 01:27:32.546 A:middle
errors, warnings,
analyses, and tests.

01:27:33.596 --> 01:27:34.756 A:middle
We see I have zero errors,

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:36.626 A:middle
so my product is
building successfully,

01:27:36.976 --> 01:27:39.256 A:middle
but I still have some issues I
should probably be resolving.

01:27:40.616 --> 01:27:42.326 A:middle
Across the middle of our charts

01:27:42.376 --> 01:27:45.646 A:middle
that display the relative
recent history of my bot,

01:27:45.986 --> 01:27:47.496 A:middle
for things like builds
and tests.

01:27:48.776 --> 01:27:51.856 A:middle
We can see that I've had some
warnings happen for a while.

01:27:52.756 --> 01:27:54.256 A:middle
We can see this integration
here right in the middle

01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:56.356 A:middle
with the red bar, that's
one that actually failed.

01:27:57.076 --> 01:27:58.646 A:middle
On tests I'm not
doing too badly.

01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:00.986 A:middle

tests that passed.

The green are all the
tests that passed.

01:28:00.986 --> 01:28:03.106 A:middle
But it looks like we had some
failures introduced recently.

01:28:03.586 --> 01:28:06.006 A:middle
I should probably look at that.

01:28:06.226 --> 01:28:08.286 A:middle
Across the bottom are
the integration details.

01:28:08.446 --> 01:28:11.726 A:middle
These are the specifics of what
happens during this integration.

01:28:12.656 --> 01:28:14.946 A:middle
They might look kind of
familiar, it's very similar

01:28:14.946 --> 01:28:16.816 A:middle
to the style we present
them in the bill blogs.

01:28:17.316 --> 01:28:18.976 A:middle
And in fact they
work very similarly.

01:28:20.196 --> 01:28:22.116 A:middle
I'll double-click on our
olm here and it's going

01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:24.796 A:middle
to take me right to that
place in my source code.

01:28:25.456 --> 01:28:27.036 A:middle
Now I want to point
out what this is doing.

01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:29.396 A:middle
It's taking information
the bot gave me

01:28:29.556 --> 01:28:31.586 A:middle
and presenting it right
inside of my project.

01:28:31.976 --> 01:28:34.316 A:middle
So now I can change the
source code, integrate it,

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.576 A:middle
and push those changes out.

01:28:36.276 --> 01:28:37.486 A:middle
So it's a really
great integration

01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:40.426 A:middle
between the two systems.

01:28:40.426 --> 01:28:42.556 A:middle
We'll go back to the
summary here and look

01:28:42.556 --> 01:28:43.716 A:middle
at some more information.

01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:46.936 A:middle
One of the really
valuable things

01:28:46.936 --> 01:28:49.176 A:middle
about the bot is doing
for me is testing.

01:28:49.886 --> 01:28:51.796 A:middle
And if I select the
Test tab across the top,

01:28:52.096 --> 01:28:54.906 A:middle
we'll see the test history
for all the integrations

01:28:54.906 --> 01:28:55.776 A:middle
that have happened recently.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:29:00.106 A:middle
Across the top is a timeline
that shows me my test history.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

Across the top is a timeline
that shows me my test history.

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:03.026 A:middle
You can see my tests have
been building up over time,

01:29:03.426 --> 01:29:06.936 A:middle
but recently, it looks like we
had some tests not get performed

01:29:06.936 --> 01:29:08.386 A:middle
but it looks like
we're back on track.

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:11.996 A:middle
I could actually grab this
loop and move it anywhere back

01:29:11.996 --> 01:29:15.316 A:middle
in time and look at the test
history to get more information

01:29:15.386 --> 01:29:16.256 A:middle
on a particular issue.

01:29:16.796 --> 01:29:21.146 A:middle
The bottom section is
showing me a combination

01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:22.306 A:middle
of pieces of information.

01:29:22.916 --> 01:29:25.456 A:middle
The rows are all of the
tests in my project.

01:29:26.046 --> 01:29:27.566 A:middle
The columns are the integrations

01:29:27.856 --> 01:29:29.496 A:middle
or the actions the
bot are performing.

01:29:30.376 --> 01:29:32.036 A:middle
So we can see here,
this is when some

01:29:32.036 --> 01:29:34.296 A:middle
of the tests were created
the first time they were run.

01:29:35.056 --> 01:29:36.546 A:middle
We can also see where
tests failed.

01:29:37.296 --> 01:29:39.876 A:middle
This column right here, this
is the integration that failed

01:29:40.026 --> 01:29:41.226 A:middle
and none of my tests ran.

01:29:42.046 --> 01:29:44.256 A:middle
So it gives me a great way to
kind of see how the evolution

01:29:44.256 --> 01:29:45.376 A:middle
of my project has gone.

01:29:46.856 --> 01:29:47.466 A:middle
Let's say we wanted

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:49.576 A:middle
to investigate this
particular test issue,

01:29:50.436 --> 01:29:51.336 A:middle
well I have a couple options.

01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:54.256 A:middle
One would be to double-click
on it and navigate

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:56.486 A:middle
to the source code like
I did before and try

01:29:56.486 --> 01:29:57.546 A:middle
to fix the problem myself.

01:29:59.116 --> 01:30:02.286 A:middle
Another option though would
be to look at the integration

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:59.116 --> 01:30:02.286 A:middle
Another option though would
be to look at the integration

01:30:02.316 --> 01:30:05.006 A:middle
and see who made the changes
and get them to fix it.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:08.456 A:middle
Well, I'll do that
one right now.

01:30:09.496 --> 01:30:11.946 A:middle
So to do that, I'm going to
double-click on the Integration,

01:30:12.596 --> 01:30:14.046 A:middle
and jump to the Integration
Details.

01:30:14.736 --> 01:30:16.256 A:middle
This is similar to what
I was saying before,

01:30:16.396 --> 01:30:17.556 A:middle
it's showing me the results

01:30:17.736 --> 01:30:19.816 A:middle
and it's showing me the
specific details below.

01:30:19.816 --> 01:30:22.256 A:middle
But there are some other
tabs across the top

01:30:22.256 --> 01:30:23.976 A:middle
that will provide
additional information.

01:30:25.196 --> 01:30:26.636 A:middle
I'll select the Tests tab

01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:29.156 A:middle
and we'll now see here are
the results from my tests.

01:30:30.906 --> 01:30:33.266 A:middle
Important thing to note here is
it's also showing me the devices

01:30:33.266 --> 01:30:35.976 A:middle
it was running on, this bot
is running all of my tests

01:30:36.266 --> 01:30:39.756 A:middle
on three separate devices,
an iPad and two iPods.

01:30:40.886 --> 01:30:43.556 A:middle
Now, my test is failing
uniformly across all of them

01:30:43.646 --> 01:30:44.946 A:middle
so it's probably
a logic failure,

01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:47.786 A:middle
but this would be a really great
way for me to be able to test

01:30:48.256 --> 01:30:51.776 A:middle
if different devices
cause problems for my app

01:30:51.776 --> 01:30:56.756 A:middle
or even devices running
different OS's how my tests do.

01:30:56.966 --> 01:30:59.856 A:middle
I'll select the Commits tab
across the top and look to see

01:30:59.856 --> 01:31:02.126 A:middle
who made the change
and up it was Max

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:59.856 --> 01:31:02.126 A:middle
who made the change
and up it was Max

01:31:02.126 --> 01:31:05.036 A:middle
who made this change,
so we can blame him.

01:31:06.196 --> 01:31:08.246 A:middle
Actually this is probably
difficult for you guys

01:31:08.246 --> 01:31:11.046 A:middle
in the back to read, but if I
read the commit message it says,

01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:13.896 A:middle
"Re-enable tests that should
have never been disabled."

01:31:14.056 --> 01:31:18.166 A:middle
If I wanted to figure out more
about what Max means by that,

01:31:18.166 --> 01:31:21.006 A:middle
I can just click on the Show
Modified Files, and it's going

01:31:21.006 --> 01:31:24.646 A:middle
to show me that very familiar
comparison view of the changes

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.616 A:middle
for this integration and sure
enough looks like Max took

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:29.096 A:middle
out some comments
for some tests.

01:31:29.836 --> 01:31:30.856 A:middle
We should probably
go and fix that.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:34.426 A:middle
But right here you can see the
bot is doing a bunch of work

01:31:34.426 --> 01:31:37.446 A:middle
for me, building, analyze,
testing and I can get

01:31:37.446 --> 01:31:39.236 A:middle
that information
right here inside

01:31:39.236 --> 01:31:41.286 A:middle
of the IDE quickly and easily.

01:31:41.866 --> 01:31:44.946 A:middle
So, this is just a little
bit of the power of bots.

01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:48.196 A:middle
What I'd like to show you next
is how easy it is to create one.

01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:51.516 A:middle
We already have one from
my iOS project here.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:54.556 A:middle
So, let's bring up the
OS X project I had before

01:31:54.816 --> 01:31:56.026 A:middle
and create a bot for this.

01:31:57.406 --> 01:31:59.786 A:middle
Creating a bot is as simple as
going under the Product menu

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:00.036 --> 01:32:02.286 A:middle
and selecting Create bot.

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:06.296 A:middle
The first question it's going
to ask is what I want to build.

01:32:06.296 --> 01:32:08.216 A:middle
And this is going to
be a very familiar list

01:32:08.216 --> 01:32:10.316 A:middle
of all the schemes
in my project.

01:32:11.476 --> 01:32:12.276 A:middle
I'll select this one,

01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:13.726 A:middle
the project I want
or the item I want.

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:16.516 A:middle
My servers are already
selected, and I'm going

01:32:16.516 --> 01:32:19.136 A:middle
to leave this box checked to
say integrate immediately,

01:32:19.466 --> 01:32:21.146 A:middle
we wanted to kick off and
start doing this work.

01:32:22.736 --> 01:32:23.606 A:middle
I'll select Next.

01:32:23.966 --> 01:32:25.606 A:middle
And I now have some
options for when

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:27.196 A:middle
and what the bot does for me.

01:32:27.966 --> 01:32:30.886 A:middle
I can set the schedule to go on
periodically at a certain time,

01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:34.006 A:middle
manually at my request
or uncommit.

01:32:34.886 --> 01:32:37.036 A:middle
I'm going to select uncommit
because I want the bot

01:32:37.036 --> 01:32:39.136 A:middle
to do this work every time
someone makes a change.

01:32:40.736 --> 01:32:44.076 A:middle
I'll leave the default actions
checked, I wanted to analyze,

01:32:44.146 --> 01:32:48.406 A:middle
test and create an archive
of my project when it's done.

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:49.406 A:middle
I'll select Next.

01:32:50.276 --> 01:32:52.936 A:middle
And the bot now provides
me access to send

01:32:52.936 --> 01:32:54.316 A:middle
out email notifications

01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:56.686 A:middle
when integration is
successful or when it fails.

01:32:56.686 --> 01:32:59.416 A:middle
I definitely want people to
know when they break something,

01:32:59.536 --> 01:33:00.866 A:middle
so I leave this check
box enabled

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:59.536 --> 01:33:00.866 A:middle
so I leave this check
box enabled

01:33:01.996 --> 01:33:04.426 A:middle
and we'll click Create Bot.

01:33:04.636 --> 01:33:08.106 A:middle
That's it, Xcode and the
server have not communicated

01:33:08.106 --> 01:33:09.786 A:middle
to create a bot for
this project.

01:33:10.276 --> 01:33:12.096 A:middle
And here it is it shows
out in my navigator.

01:33:13.086 --> 01:33:15.316 A:middle
So, just like that I
was able to make use

01:33:15.316 --> 01:33:16.726 A:middle
of the continuous
integration system

01:33:16.986 --> 01:33:18.206 A:middle
to start tracking my project.

01:33:19.306 --> 01:33:21.846 A:middle
Now, it's going to take a second
here to perform the integration.

01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:23.796 A:middle
So, in the meantime what I want

01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:28.366 A:middle
to do is show you some other
features we have in the system.

01:33:28.516 --> 01:33:31.236 A:middle
In order to keep track of all of
the projects you might be using,

01:33:31.496 --> 01:33:32.836 A:middle
we have an integrated web view.

01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:35.836 A:middle
You can see here a list of
all the projects that I have,

01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:39.246 A:middle
their current status and the
ability to interact with them.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:42.286 A:middle
In fact I can go ahead and
click on anyone of these

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:43.746 A:middle
to create an integration

01:33:44.026 --> 01:33:46.396 A:middle
or download the product
of any of these bots.

01:33:47.146 --> 01:33:49.276 A:middle
So, this is a great way
for engineering, QA,

01:33:49.276 --> 01:33:52.286 A:middle
and other groups to leverage
the value and the power

01:33:52.286 --> 01:33:53.716 A:middle
of the continuous
integration system.

01:33:55.036 --> 01:33:57.626 A:middle
But to keep everybody kind
of on a level playing field

01:33:57.626 --> 01:33:59.536 A:middle
with how things are
working, we also want

01:33:59.536 --> 01:34:02.986 A:middle
to provide a really interactive
and fun display and we've done

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:33:59.536 --> 01:34:02.986 A:middle
to provide a really interactive
and fun display and we've done

01:34:02.986 --> 01:34:05.076 A:middle
that in the form of Scoreboard.

01:34:06.516 --> 01:34:12.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:34:13.186 --> 01:34:15.516 A:middle
The Scoreboard presents
a view of all of the bots

01:34:15.586 --> 01:34:16.656 A:middle
that are running on my server.

01:34:16.656 --> 01:34:19.256 A:middle
On the left hand side
you can see the projects

01:34:19.256 --> 01:34:20.286 A:middle
and their current status;

01:34:20.846 --> 01:34:22.736 A:middle
on the right hand side
you can see the details.

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:25.856 A:middle
Integration results the
commit logs and devices

01:34:25.856 --> 01:34:26.606 A:middle
that it was running on.

01:34:27.616 --> 01:34:28.606 A:middle
And you'll see that it cycles

01:34:28.606 --> 01:34:32.196 A:middle
through each one giving me the
details, it happens to hang

01:34:32.196 --> 01:34:34.606 A:middle
out a little bit longer on
failed ones which is not good

01:34:34.606 --> 01:34:36.716 A:middle
for me right now, but you'll see

01:34:36.716 --> 01:34:38.696 A:middle
when it actually switches
it will give you the details

01:34:38.696 --> 01:34:40.796 A:middle
about each including
who made the changes.

01:34:41.686 --> 01:34:44.896 A:middle
So, this is a great way whether
it's running on TVs or monitors

01:34:44.896 --> 01:34:47.356 A:middle
around your office, or just
running on your desktop

01:34:47.356 --> 01:34:48.616 A:middle
for you guys to keep track

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.776 A:middle
of how the continuous
integration system is working,

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:54.306 A:middle
the status of your projects,
and frankly who the heroes

01:34:54.306 --> 01:34:55.976 A:middle
and the villains are
in your own office.

01:34:57.836 --> 01:35:00.136 A:middle
And that's Continuous
Integration with Xcode 5.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:34:57.836 --> 01:35:00.136 A:middle
And that's Continuous
Integration with Xcode 5.

[ Applause ]

01:35:10.756 --> 01:35:12.336 A:middle
So, bots and Continuous
Integration.

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:16.426 A:middle
At the heart of this
solution is OS X server.

01:35:17.486 --> 01:35:21.426 A:middle
OS X server continuous deliver
powerful services such as mail,

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:25.306 A:middle
calendaring, and wiki, and the
Xcode service now joins them

01:35:25.336 --> 01:35:27.186 A:middle
to deliver continuous
integration.

01:35:28.206 --> 01:35:31.236 A:middle
And running OS X server
is easier than ever.

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:35.286 A:middle
The set of experience has
been redesigned and simplified

01:35:35.626 --> 01:35:38.226 A:middle
and in literally just a few
minutes you can have the server

01:35:38.226 --> 01:35:39.636 A:middle
up and running on your network.

01:35:41.256 --> 01:35:44.206 A:middle
Now the Xcode service leverages
many of the functionalities

01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:47.456 A:middle
and features of Xcode 5
including the Apple ID

01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:50.996 A:middle
integration, unit testing,
and source control features.

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:54.366 A:middle
And layers on top elements
like Bonjour discovery,

01:35:54.556 --> 01:35:57.976 A:middle
repository hosting, and the
new web client, and Scoreboard.

01:35:59.046 --> 01:36:01.136 A:middle
The combination of these
features is a continuous

The combination of these
features is a continuous

integration system
that you, your team,

01:36:04.046 --> 01:36:07.446 A:middle
and your entire company can
use to deliver great iOS

01:36:07.966 --> 01:36:09.176 A:middle
and OS X applications.

01:36:11.816 --> 01:36:16.696 A:middle
Xcode 5, we have a ton of great
features for you in this release

01:36:17.026 --> 01:36:18.746 A:middle
and I'm pretty sure you
guys are going to love them.

01:36:19.426 --> 01:36:22.536 A:middle
With Xcode 5 you should be able
to build applications better,

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:26.486 A:middle
faster, and easier than ever,
and we're really excited

01:36:26.486 --> 01:36:27.206 A:middle
to see what you do with it.

01:36:27.826 --> 01:36:28.096 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Matthew.

01:36:38.846 --> 01:36:39.176 A:middle
All right.

01:36:39.546 --> 01:36:43.586 A:middle
So we announced three major new
products to you today, iOS 7,

01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:47.426 A:middle
OS X Mavericks, and
also Xcode 5.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.146 A:middle
They contained fantastic
new features for end users

01:36:51.216 --> 01:36:54.306 A:middle
and developers and we recommend
that you use the next few months

01:36:54.346 --> 01:36:56.966 A:middle
to get ready for us launching
these products later this year.

01:36:57.846 --> 01:37:00.406 A:middle
To get you started, you're
going to make developer previews

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:36:57.846 --> 01:37:00.406 A:middle
To get you started, you're
going to make developer previews

01:37:00.406 --> 01:37:02.696 A:middle
of all these products
available for you today.

01:37:02.866 --> 01:37:04.436 A:middle
So, you'll be able to go

01:37:04.436 --> 01:37:06.606 A:middle
to the WWDC attendee
website later this evening

01:37:06.606 --> 01:37:09.406 A:middle
and download previews of
iOS 7 for your iPhones,

01:37:09.656 --> 01:37:12.716 A:middle
iPads will come a little
later, OS X Mavericks,

01:37:13.096 --> 01:37:16.066 A:middle
Xcode 5 with the SDKs
for both of this new OS's

01:37:16.066 --> 01:37:19.466 A:middle
and even the new server app for
Mavericks which allows to try

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.206 A:middle
out a new continuous
integration features

01:37:21.416 --> 01:37:22.316 A:middle
