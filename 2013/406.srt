[ Applause ]

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; How you guys doing?

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.356 A:middle
Oh, come on.

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.446 A:middle
You guys aren't [noise]
yeah, here we go.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:20.236 A:middle
I'm about to say like this
is a 10:15 session, right?

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.636 A:middle
You guys are way more
awake than the 9 o'clock.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:23.696 A:middle
All right!

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:24.886 A:middle
My name is Kevin Cathey, I'm one

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.136 A:middle
of the Interface
Builder Engineers.

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.026 A:middle
And, later my co-worker
Tony is going to be joining

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:31.086 A:middle
up on stage taking the reins.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.526 A:middle
And, what we're going to
be talking about today is,

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.506 A:middle
hence the title,
Auto Layout in Xcode.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.236 A:middle
But before I talk about
Auto Layout in Xcode,

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.466 A:middle
I just want to take a
brief kind of crash course

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.996 A:middle
into what Auto Layout is.

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:46.106 A:middle
In case you're new to the
technology, new to the platform.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.446 A:middle
So let's do that real quick.

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:50.896 A:middle
If I were to define Auto Layout
in a sentence, which I've done,

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:55.236 A:middle
is that it is a constraint-based
descriptive layout system.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:56.916 A:middle
That was helpful.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.306 A:middle
So let's look at
what that means.

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.776 A:middle
So I have an interface here
and I want to describe it once.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.776 A:middle
So I have an interface here
and I want to describe it once.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.816 A:middle
But I wanted to look good in
both portrait and landscape.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.556 A:middle
So what are some ways that
I can describe the interface

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:10.606 A:middle
like I have here?

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:14.066 A:middle
OK. One way I could do it would
be with the Hard-Coded Layout.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:19.006 A:middle
But, when I rotate my device,
if I keep my frame origin fixed

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.266 A:middle
like that, you know,
139,270, then it's going to be

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.976 A:middle
in the wrong spot when
I rotate my device.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:27.626 A:middle
So clearly, that's
not what we want.

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:31.916 A:middle
So what's another way that we
could describe this interface?

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.696 A:middle
Well, if I were to go
like to the white board

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:37.036 A:middle
and like describe it to
someone, I might use terms like,

00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:40.586 A:middle
the control is centered
vertically in my container or,

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.686 A:middle
to fix the distance
from the right edge,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.136 A:middle
and this is exactly
what Auto Layout is.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:47.126 A:middle
What Auto Layout is, is
it's taking this kind

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.776 A:middle
of white board human
readable descriptions

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:52.066 A:middle
and its codifying them
into these objects

00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:53.536 A:middle
that we call constraints.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:58.766 A:middle
Now, what the automatic
part is of Auto Layout is

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.336 A:middle
that you provide the
constraints for us

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.336 A:middle
that you provide the
constraints for us

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:03.826 A:middle
and then we automatically
determine those frames based

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:04.706 A:middle
upon the constraints.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.346 A:middle
Now, this is really
cool and really powerful

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:08.056 A:middle
for a couple of reasons.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:10.895 A:middle
So, like I mentioned, first
of all, it's relational.

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:13.176 A:middle
I'm just describing it how you
would describe it to someone

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:14.456 A:middle
if you were just
explaining it to them

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.456 A:middle
in the hallway or
on a white board.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.436 A:middle
And this relationship-based
layout is also going

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:23.136 A:middle
to benefit us in other ways
too, especially when things

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:24.836 A:middle
around us start changing.

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:27.396 A:middle
This is the fun part
of writing code, right?

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:30.416 A:middle
So, for example, let's talk
about metrics for a second.

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:33.196 A:middle
I already talked about
rotation where the size

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.416 A:middle
of container is changing
based upon the orientation

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:39.736 A:middle
of our device or the think about
screen sizes, the difference

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:42.396 A:middle
between a retina 3 and a half
inch and a retina 4 inch.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.636 A:middle
Or as we've been talking
about so far with this WWDC,

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:49.416 A:middle
the differences between
iOS 6 and iOS 7

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.666 A:middle
where not only do we have
changes in the metrics

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.436 A:middle
of controls like UI
switch and UI slider,

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:57.526 A:middle
but we also have a great
new dynamic text feature

00:02:57.686 --> 00:02:59.116 A:middle
where the user can
actually change the size

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.116 A:middle
of the font on the fly.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.116 A:middle
of the font on the fly.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:04.946 A:middle
So, using Auto Layout and using
relationships to describe things

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:08.736 A:middle
like spacings, alignments, equal
sizes, these are the things

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:11.876 A:middle
that are going to translate
regardless of what the size

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.486 A:middle
of the container is, so
the size of the control,

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:14.546 A:middle
the size of your contents.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:16.436 A:middle
So, let's talk about content.

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:20.976 A:middle
So, Localization is a really
common place that this comes up.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
Now you guys are all
localizing applications, right?

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:24.986 A:middle
I can just assume you are.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:26.446 A:middle
I'll take it by the yes's

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.156 A:middle
in several languages
that you are, great!

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.386 A:middle
If you're not, then this is a
great time to start doing so,

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.596 A:middle
'cause not only it will
benefit you for Localization

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:35.566 A:middle
but also all of the things
I've been talking about.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:38.236 A:middle
So let's talk about
expressiveness.

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.636 A:middle
With Auto Layout,
you can do things

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:42.966 A:middle
that just weren't
possible before

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:44.896 A:middle
without writing a lot of code.

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:47.876 A:middle
And as we all know, writing
code is writing bugs,

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
less code equals more
awesome most of the time.

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:53.756 A:middle
So with Auto Layout, you
can express really powerful

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:55.926 A:middle
relationships, and
if you're using Xcode

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:57.956 A:middle
in Interface Builder, you can
express these really powerful

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:00.316 A:middle
relationships again, without
writing a single line of code,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:00.316 A:middle
relationships again, without
writing a single line of code,

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.086 A:middle
and that is just a huge win.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:07.946 A:middle
So, as we've kind of been
saying so far with WWDC 2012,

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:10.686 A:middle
this is a great time to
start adopting Auto Layout.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.126 A:middle
And so you might be wondering,
well, how do I do that?

00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:14.756 A:middle
I don't even know
where to start.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.826 A:middle
So, the first place to start
is with Interface Builder.

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:20.826 A:middle
If you guys are using Interface
Builder, the first step that I

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:22.726 A:middle
like to recommend is that
you go in Interface Builder

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:25.436 A:middle
and you upgrade your documents
to start using Auto Layout

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:26.666 A:middle
and you add constraints.

00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.986 A:middle
Now, let me pause here
and mention something

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:31.226 A:middle
that I think it's
really critical to talk

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.096 A:middle
about when it comes to some
of these new technologies.

00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:36.006 A:middle
Auto Layout can be
adopted incrementally.

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:37.626 A:middle
It's not an all or
nothing thing.

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.186 A:middle
You don't have to turn
it on for you whole app,

00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:41.736 A:middle
make it work all at once, right?

00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:42.636 A:middle
We all have deadlines.

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:44.516 A:middle
And, sometimes the task

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:48.446 A:middle
of adopting a new technology
looks daunting given a deadline.

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.406 A:middle
But, with Auto Layout and
many of our new technologies,

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:53.916 A:middle
with iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks,

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.876 A:middle
is that you can adopt them
incrementally, bit by bit.

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.466 A:middle
So, with Auto Layout,
the kind of granularity

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.356 A:middle
for this is per view controller

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.356 A:middle
for this is per view controller

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.036 A:middle
or per Interface
Builder document.

00:05:03.756 --> 00:05:06.146 A:middle
And you can add just that one
piece in to use Auto Layout,

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:08.446 A:middle
get it to work and
move on to the next.

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:10.576 A:middle
You might only get two or
three view controllers working,

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.606 A:middle
the place is what makes the
most sense then say, "You know,

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:13.876 A:middle
I have to ship," great.

00:05:14.276 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
After the release, come
back, and keep moving on.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.276 A:middle
So I just want to make sure
that's really clear as we go on.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:24.956 A:middle
Now, a lot of us do things
outside of Interface Builder

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:26.566 A:middle
with code, we add
extra subviews,

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:27.876 A:middle
make little adjustments
here and there.

00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:31.236 A:middle
And this is the last part of
adopting Auto Layout is to go

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.356 A:middle
to those places where you're
adding subviews dynamically

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:36.046 A:middle
at runtime and you'll need
to update those call sites

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:37.206 A:middle
to be aware of Auto Layout.

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:38.656 A:middle
So previously, with the springs

00:05:38.656 --> 00:05:40.876 A:middle
and struts system you would
do things like setFrame,

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:42.226 A:middle
addSubview, things like that.

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:44.216 A:middle
You'll continue to
call addSubview,

00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:46.646 A:middle
but instead of calling
setFrame, now what you want

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:49.626 A:middle
to do is either add constraints
or modify those constraints.

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:52.766 A:middle
Now, the risk of being overly
complicated too quickly,

00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:54.856 A:middle
I'm going to point out one thing
that I want you to be aware

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:55.976 A:middle
of as you're adopting
Auto Layout

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.916 A:middle
and this property called
translatesAutoresizing

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.086 A:middle
MaskIntoConstraints.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.086 A:middle
MaskIntoConstraints.

00:06:00.606 --> 00:06:02.866 A:middle
What this does is it just
tells the system, "Hey,

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.306 A:middle
I want you to help me by
generating constraints

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:07.946 A:middle
that exactly mimic
the Autoresizing Mask.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:10.646 A:middle
So go back to this idea
of adopting incrementally.

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:12.806 A:middle
In code, you can actually
get down to the level

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:14.116 A:middle
of adopting it per view.

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:16.666 A:middle
Now if you want to add your
own constraints, you're going

00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:18.296 A:middle
to want to have
translatesAutoresizing

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.886 A:middle
MaskIntoConstraints turned to
"No," the default is "Yes."

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.556 A:middle
If you use Interface Builder,

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:24.586 A:middle
don't worry we'll
handle all for you.

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:26.476 A:middle
But as you're adding
subviews and code,

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.416 A:middle
you want to make sure you
turn that off if you want

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:29.736 A:middle
to add your own constraints.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:30.286 A:middle
All right!

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:35.526 A:middle
That was like the 3-minute crash
course into what Auto Layout is.

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:37.636 A:middle
If you want to know more,
if you're still confused

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.806 A:middle
at this point, you can go
check out these sessions

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:43.296 A:middle
from the previous WWDC, there's
three great sessions here.

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:44.786 A:middle
So if you're watching
the videos,

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:46.766 A:middle
hit the spacebar,
go check this out.

00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:48.996 A:middle
If you're in the
audience, well buckle up.

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:50.266 A:middle
All right!

00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:52.826 A:middle
So let's talk a little
about kind

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.586 A:middle
of how Auto Layout
has come to be.

00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:58.586 A:middle
So you may know in 2011, we
first introduced Auto Layout,

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:01.526 A:middle
it was brand new for the
Mac, brand new for Xcode,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:01.526 A:middle
it was brand new for the
Mac, brand new for Xcode,

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:04.686 A:middle
and it was all about helping you
create Auto Layout interfaces

00:07:04.746 --> 00:07:06.966 A:middle
quickly, with the
Visual Format Language

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:09.786 A:middle
and with the Interface Builder's
automatic constraint addition.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.536 A:middle
Now last year, it was all

00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:13.446 A:middle
about helping you build
Auto Layout interfaces

00:07:13.446 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
in more places, bringing
Auto Layout to iOS.

00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:20.546 A:middle
Now, it's been really cool
to get to work with you guys

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:21.616 A:middle
over the last two years.

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:23.316 A:middle
I've had a chance
to meet many of you.

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:25.536 A:middle
And man, you guys are
doing some cool stuff,

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.606 A:middle
like some really
custom cool stuff.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:30.126 A:middle
I just think it's awesome.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:32.896 A:middle
And so, what we're going to do
this year is we want to put you

00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:35.566 A:middle
in the driver seat when
it comes to Auto Layout.

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
And so, with Xcode 5 where we're
introducing a completely new

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:42.746 A:middle
workflow for working with
Auto Layout in Xcode,

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:46.216 A:middle
that will give you both kind
of broad painting strokes

00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:47.486 A:middle
for working with Auto Layout,

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:50.516 A:middle
but also that really
fine-tune grained control

00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:53.286 A:middle
that will help you
accomplish and build those apps

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:57.386 A:middle
that are just fantastic.

00:07:57.426 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
Now, as we talk about phases
of development, right,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.426 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
Now, as we talk about phases
of development, right,

00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:01.816 A:middle
we're adding features
that are going to help you

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
in every phase of development.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.666 A:middle
What are some of those
different phases?

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:06.496 A:middle
Well, we all start here, right?

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:09.366 A:middle
Initial Layout, and this is
just where you're dragging stuff

00:08:09.366 --> 00:08:13.116 A:middle
out for the first time, you
want to get stuff to show up.

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:17.886 A:middle
At this point, I mean I'm not
really thinking about rotation

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:21.556 A:middle
or localization, I'm just
pretty much concerned with--

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:23.466 A:middle
can I remember how to
connect to a database

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:24.976 A:middle
and can I populate my UI label,

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:26.936 A:middle
that's pretty much what I'm
concerned at this point,

00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:28.866 A:middle
and getting things up and
running as quick as possible.

00:08:29.806 --> 00:08:31.596 A:middle
But then, eventually, I
do want start thinking

00:08:31.596 --> 00:08:34.405 A:middle
about how is my application
going to adopt when I rotate,

00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:36.346 A:middle
change devices, change
localizations?

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:38.246 A:middle
And this is in an
Auto Layout world

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.655 A:middle
where we start adding
constraints.

00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:44.186 A:middle
And then we all go through the
inevitable Debug cycle, well,

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.756 A:middle
except here at Apple 'cause
we don't have any bugs.

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:47.636 A:middle
No, I'm just kidding.

00:08:47.636 --> 00:08:49.076 A:middle
So we all go through
that Debug cycle,

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:50.876 A:middle
we identified problems
and fix them.

00:08:50.876 --> 00:08:54.036 A:middle
And then we kind of push
our interfaces often

00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:57.326 A:middle
to this Maintenance Mode, right,
I may make a few tweaks here

00:08:57.326 --> 00:08:59.366 A:middle
and there, but generally we're
not touching our interface

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.016 A:middle
for probably quite a while.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.016 A:middle
for probably quite a while.

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:03.396 A:middle
And it's really important
in this phase

00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:07.426 A:middle
that when you're making those
single edits to your document,

00:09:07.536 --> 00:09:09.576 A:middle
that things aren't changing
that you're not aware of.

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:12.756 A:middle
And this is last arrow that kind

00:09:12.826 --> 00:09:15.876 A:middle
of connects maintenance
and Initial Layout.

00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:19.316 A:middle
And you can think about this
when you start your next version

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:20.906 A:middle
of your app, you
shift from version 1,

00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:22.046 A:middle
you shift to version--
and I'm going

00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:23.896 A:middle
to start working on version 2.

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:25.836 A:middle
Your marketing guy comes
in and says, "Great,

00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:27.116 A:middle
let's change the whole thing."

00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:31.226 A:middle
Awesome! So then, you need
a chance and some tools

00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:34.166 A:middle
to help you start over
with some of your layout.

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:37.186 A:middle
So what Tony and I are going
to show you today is how

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:39.936 A:middle
with Xcode 5, we've added
features to help you

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:40.846 A:middle
with each one of these phases.

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:42.826 A:middle
So what we're going to do
is we're just going to walk

00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:44.026 A:middle
through each one of
these one by one.

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:46.846 A:middle
So let's start with, at the
beginning, Initial Layout.

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:50.176 A:middle
Now, again, this is just when
you're first adding views,

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.506 A:middle
positioning, resizing,
I mean the stuff--

00:09:52.506 --> 00:09:54.176 A:middle
you guys got the stuff,
this stuff was easy.

00:09:55.466 --> 00:09:57.886 A:middle
And again, when you're working
in the space, you're not

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:59.946 A:middle
yet thinking about
how it's going

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
to react the changes around you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
to react the changes around you.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.286 A:middle
So, with Xcode 5,
when you add a view,

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:07.556 A:middle
you get to add constraints
when you're ready.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:09.576 A:middle
Interface Builder is not
going to add any constraints

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:17.976 A:middle
when you first add a view, you
get to decide when that's best.

00:10:17.976 --> 00:10:18.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:20.206 A:middle
So then, you add a view, you
don't add any constraints,

00:10:20.206 --> 00:10:20.936 A:middle
and you build and run.

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:22.566 A:middle
Well, what do you
expect to happen?

00:10:23.086 --> 00:10:25.686 A:middle
With Xcode 5, if you
haven't added any constraints

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:29.226 A:middle
to the view yet, we will at
Build Time add fix position

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:32.816 A:middle
and size constraints, so
that you can experiment very,

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.626 A:middle
very quickly without
having to think

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:36.276 A:middle
about constraints again
until you're ready.

00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:40.506 A:middle
Now, what this allows you
to do is this allows you

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.986 A:middle
to separate your Layout
and Interface Builder

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.206 A:middle
with your layout at runtime.

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:47.646 A:middle
What you are dragging around and
resizing an Interface Builder,

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.796 A:middle
could be independent of how
you're thinking about things

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:51.686 A:middle
at runtime and then
you get to decide

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:52.706 A:middle
when you want to sync that up.

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:55.086 A:middle
You might say, "OK,
I want my constraints

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:57.136 A:middle
to reflect what I have
in Interface Builder,"

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:57.846 A:middle
or you might say,
" You know what,

00:10:57.846 --> 00:10:58.686 A:middle
I don't want Interface Builder

00:10:58.686 --> 00:11:00.166 A:middle
to reflect what my
constraints at."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.686 --> 00:11:00.166 A:middle
to reflect what my
constraints at."

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:03.076 A:middle
And we've added features that
give you the precise control

00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:07.656 A:middle
over when you want to do that
and how you want to do that.

00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:10.406 A:middle
Now again, at this
point, I'm still thinking

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:12.636 A:middle
of my interface as
a static entity.

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:16.156 A:middle
But eventually, I want to start
thinking about how does it react

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:18.276 A:middle
to changes, and this is when
we start adding constraints.

00:11:18.526 --> 00:11:22.516 A:middle
We've added a lot of new ways
to add constraints with Xcode 5.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:25.816 A:middle
And really, I think, the best
way to show you is with a demo.

00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.926 A:middle
So let's do that now.

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:34.176 A:middle
So all the features I'm
going to show you work

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:36.516 A:middle
with both iOS and OS X.

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:38.846 A:middle
But what we're going to
do is we're going to look

00:11:38.846 --> 00:11:41.296 A:middle
at just an iOS application here.

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:44.906 A:middle
And this is an app that you've
seen in a couple of sessions,

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:47.056 A:middle
I believe, it's our
adventure game.

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.786 A:middle
And what we're going to do is
we're going add a Front End UI

00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:53.236 A:middle
to this to kind of navigate
around some of the things

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:54.366 A:middle
like a creating a new game,

00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:56.046 A:middle
loading a game, things
like that.

00:11:57.456 --> 00:11:59.106 A:middle
All right, so let's
get started here.

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:02.946 A:middle
What we're going to do is we're
going to build a splash screen

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:02.946 A:middle
What we're going to do is we're
going to build a splash screen

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:04.816 A:middle
by adding some buttons here.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.796 A:middle
So what I can do is I can
just-- here is my library,

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:12.086 A:middle
I'm just going to drag
out a button and drop it,

00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:15.676 A:middle
and again the first thing you're
going to notice by zooming here

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.066 A:middle
with Interface Builder
is waiting

00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:19.166 A:middle
to add constraints
until I'm ready.

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:25.356 A:middle
All right, so, my artwork is
going to send me a designer.

00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
My designer is going
to send me some artwork

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:29.656 A:middle
so in the meantime
I'm just going to fill

00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:31.316 A:middle
in with a background color,

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.006 A:middle
just a placeholder
background color here.

00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:34.996 A:middle
I want to call this,

00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:36.846 A:middle
if I double-click, I
can edit the title.

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:39.426 A:middle
I'm going to call
this "New Game."

00:12:40.716 --> 00:12:42.896 A:middle
And I can just position
this, resize this,

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.556 A:middle
and it just works
just how I expect.

00:12:46.396 --> 00:12:51.496 A:middle
Again, let's see, load game,
and then the most important part

00:12:51.496 --> 00:12:53.546 A:middle
for us as developers,
the credits.

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:56.976 A:middle
And then, whoops, I
didn't mean to do that.

00:12:56.976 --> 00:13:00.736 A:middle
And let's resize this, position
them, all right, we're good.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.976 --> 00:13:00.736 A:middle
And let's resize this, position
them, all right, we're good.

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:02.756 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
build and run this.

00:13:02.756 --> 00:13:04.516 A:middle
Again, I haven't added
a single constraint yet,

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:06.526 A:middle
but my document's
using Auto Layout.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.456 A:middle
And you'll see when I build
and run my application

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.106 A:middle
and it shows up,
it's going to show

00:13:11.106 --> 00:13:13.266 A:middle
up exactly how it looks
in interface builder.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:16.296 A:middle
And these are those constraints
that we add at Build Time

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:18.556 A:middle
so that you can build
run your application

00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:21.076 A:middle
and quickly experiment
with what you're doing.

00:13:21.326 --> 00:13:23.876 A:middle
We'll even tag those
constraints at runtime so that,

00:13:24.106 --> 00:13:25.816 A:middle
if you start getting
log messages and stuff,

00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:29.306 A:middle
you can see exactly what object
what Nib file those constraints

00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:32.396 A:middle
came from right at runtime.

00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:32.756 A:middle
All right!

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:35.596 A:middle
So you can see the effect
of our fixed position

00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:38.756 A:middle
and size constraints
when I rotate my device.

00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:41.306 A:middle
Well, that's clearly
not I want to happen.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.456 A:middle
So let's go back to Xcode and
let's add some constraints.

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:47.816 A:middle
I'm going to show you three
ways in this demo to--

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.406 A:middle
new ways to add constraints.

00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:51.746 A:middle
You've already seen two
of them, and I'm going

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:52.956 A:middle
to reiterate those first.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:54.666 A:middle
Let me stop this.

00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:55.676 A:middle
All right!

00:13:55.726 --> 00:13:58.896 A:middle
So the first way I'm going to
show you is via Control-Drag.

00:13:59.076 --> 00:14:01.406 A:middle
Just like you can
control drag between views

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.076 --> 00:14:01.406 A:middle
Just like you can
control drag between views

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:05.376 A:middle
to add relationships like
actions and outlets for views,

00:14:05.376 --> 00:14:07.126 A:middle
now you can control
drag between views

00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:08.816 A:middle
to add relationships
that are constraints.

00:14:09.296 --> 00:14:11.916 A:middle
So hold Control, I
can just could drag

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:13.336 A:middle
from this new button off

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:16.006 A:middle
to create a leading
space to my superview.

00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:18.496 A:middle
I'm going to pause again
and point out a few things.

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:21.096 A:middle
When you add your first
constraint to a view,

00:14:21.096 --> 00:14:24.196 A:middle
what you're telling Interface
Builder is, "Hey, I want to be

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.936 A:middle
in charge of the
layout of this view,"

00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:28.716 A:middle
and now what Interface Builder
does is it starts trying

00:14:28.716 --> 00:14:32.066 A:middle
to help you, by just pointing
things out, and just making sure

00:14:32.066 --> 00:14:33.956 A:middle
that you're getting the
constraints that you want.

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:36.696 A:middle
So there's two things I want
to point out here: First,

00:14:36.966 --> 00:14:39.436 A:middle
the constraint that I've added,
I've only added one constraint,

00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:41.226 A:middle
and the constraint that
I've added is orange,

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:44.336 A:middle
which is indicating to me "Hey,
I still have more work to do."

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:47.606 A:middle
The other that Interface
Builder is doing is,

00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:49.906 A:middle
it's showing me my
Runtime Layout.

00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:54.186 A:middle
Like I said, with Xcode 5, you
can have your Design Time Layout

00:14:54.186 --> 00:14:56.376 A:middle
and your Runtime Layout be
different while you're building

00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.696 A:middle
as you get to the
point where you want

00:14:58.696 --> 00:14:59.696 A:middle
to have the UI that you want.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.146 --> 00:15:02.126 A:middle
And so, what Interface Builder
is showing me is, "OK, this is--

00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:05.536 A:middle
this big rectangle here is
where my Design Time Layout is,

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:09.476 A:middle
and this dotted rectangle is
what the constraints would

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:10.706 A:middle
generate at runtime."

00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:14.206 A:middle
And so what I can
do is if I control

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:15.136 A:middle
and I got off the right edge,

00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:19.956 A:middle
you can see that it
jumps over that side.

00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:22.406 A:middle
So why is it-- it
actually have a height,

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:23.776 A:middle
I haven't add any
height constraint,

00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:24.596 A:middle
why does it have a height?

00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:26.726 A:middle
And this goes to one of
the concepts in Auto Layout

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:29.686 A:middle
that is also really
powerful, which is the idea

00:15:29.686 --> 00:15:31.746 A:middle
of the intrinsic content size.

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:36.706 A:middle
Most views like or most controls
rather like labels, buttons,

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:40.656 A:middle
other things like that have a
size that is like they're sized

00:15:40.656 --> 00:15:43.986 A:middle
to fit size, think about it like
the size of the text of a label,

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:45.776 A:middle
that's a great example
of something that--

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:47.196 A:middle
the intrinsic content size is.

00:15:47.636 --> 00:15:50.856 A:middle
So from my button, the intrinsic
content size is the size

00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:52.096 A:middle
of the text, New Game.

00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:54.396 A:middle
So in this case, the
height there is showing me,

00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.366 A:middle
the height of the string game.

00:15:56.946 --> 00:16:01.596 A:middle
So, Control-Drag is
context sensitive.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.946 --> 00:16:01.596 A:middle
So, Control-Drag is
context sensitive.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:06.166 A:middle
So based upon the views I'm
dragging between and the angle

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:08.436 A:middle
of the line that I'm drawing,
it will give me suggestions.

00:16:09.076 --> 00:16:11.826 A:middle
So if I'm drawing out a vertical
line and some horizontal,

00:16:12.226 --> 00:16:16.476 A:middle
you can see it gives me options
for vertical or horizontal--

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.836 A:middle
vertical and horizontal
constraints.

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:20.286 A:middle
We have a top space here

00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:22.366 A:middle
and then our horizontal
constraint is centering,

00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:25.066 A:middle
so based upon that line
that I've just drawn.

00:16:25.536 --> 00:16:28.336 A:middle
So I can pick a top
space and then I'm going

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:29.586 A:middle
to draw one more constraint here

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:32.826 A:middle
which is the height
of my button.

00:16:33.256 --> 00:16:35.766 A:middle
Now, generally, you do not
want to add explicit width

00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:36.686 A:middle
and height constraints.

00:16:37.366 --> 00:16:39.326 A:middle
If you add an explicit
width or heights constraint,

00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:41.606 A:middle
then as the intrinsic
content size changes,

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:44.446 A:middle
say when the font size changes

00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:46.866 A:middle
or the string inside
of it changes.

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:49.156 A:middle
That control will
not change size

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:51.516 A:middle
so you might get clipped text
or really awkward spaces.

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:54.596 A:middle
Now I'm adding a height
constraint here 'cause this is a

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.256 A:middle
custom button and
there's artwork

00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:58.396 A:middle
that my designer will provide
for me later, but for now,

00:16:58.396 --> 00:16:59.796 A:middle
I'm just going to add
a height constraint.

00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:00.976 A:middle
But when I got my artwork,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:00.976 A:middle
But when I got my artwork,

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:04.096 A:middle
I would probably
want to delete this.

00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:04.556 A:middle
All right!

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:08.465 A:middle
So just like I can create
constraints between my superview

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:11.175 A:middle
and across myself, I can also
created them by siblings.

00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:14.185 A:middle
So to do that, I can
control drag from new game

00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:17.195 A:middle
down the load game, and you can
see I get a few more options

00:17:17.195 --> 00:17:21.056 A:middle
here, I get a vertical space, I
get some alignments on the left,

00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:24.086 A:middle
center and right, and
also some equal sizes.

00:17:24.455 --> 00:17:25.925 A:middle
So I'm going to select
vertical space.

00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:29.246 A:middle
That constraint is orange
telling me, I still got to work

00:17:29.246 --> 00:17:31.136 A:middle
to do so I'm going to add
some more constraints.

00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:34.416 A:middle
I can add them one at a time or
I can add multiple at a time.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:36.866 A:middle
Before I do that, I'm going
point out something else.

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:38.966 A:middle
Well, just this little dot
right here which is telling me

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:41.366 A:middle
that I've already added this
vertical spacing constraint.

00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:41.986 A:middle
All right!

00:17:42.676 --> 00:17:45.766 A:middle
So now I can hold
command or shift

00:17:45.826 --> 00:17:47.386 A:middle
to add multiple constraints
at once.

00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:50.446 A:middle
So I can do left and
right, I can hit return

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:52.846 A:middle
or just click away, and it's
added those two constraints

00:17:53.296 --> 00:17:53.786 A:middle
really quickly.

00:17:54.746 --> 00:17:58.216 A:middle
And now I can finish off my view
by adding my height constraint.

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.996 A:middle
Great! I've go my two
buttons done here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.996 A:middle
Great! I've go my two
buttons done here.

00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:03.136 A:middle
Let's talk about the
third button here.

00:18:03.526 --> 00:18:05.876 A:middle
The third button you can
see here doesn't have any

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.006 A:middle
constraints yet, and
it still not kind

00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:09.666 A:middle
of fixed position
and size state.

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:11.846 A:middle
When you build and
run your application

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.776 A:middle
and Interface Builder adds
those fallback constraints.

00:18:13.776 --> 00:18:17.066 A:middle
If you haven't added any
constraints yet, it's per view.

00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:19.486 A:middle
So you can as you get them
up and running, you can work

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:22.036 A:middle
on like one part of UI, move
on to the other part of UI,

00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:23.486 A:middle
and work on it again
incrementally.

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:28.106 A:middle
Now, I can control drag between
all my views to add constraint

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:29.696 A:middle
which is again a really precise

00:18:29.696 --> 00:18:31.056 A:middle
and quick way to
add constraints.

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.786 A:middle
But right now, I just
want to kind of get more

00:18:33.786 --> 00:18:35.346 A:middle
of a broader paint stroke.

00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:37.346 A:middle
I want Interface Builder
to give me a suggestion

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.706 A:middle
of constraints that
I can work with.

00:18:39.376 --> 00:18:40.216 A:middle
So to do that, I'm going

00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:43.466 A:middle
to use the new Auto Layout Issue
Resolving Menu, and Tony's going

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:45.996 A:middle
to talk more about this later,
but I'm just going to point

00:18:45.996 --> 00:18:47.876 A:middle
out a few things, so
let's zoom in down here

00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:50.146 A:middle
and I can pop this guy open.

00:18:50.256 --> 00:18:51.836 A:middle
It's got a bunch of
different commands here

00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:54.576 A:middle
for doing larger brush
strokes with constraints.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.686 A:middle
One of these is reset the
suggested constraints.

00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:00.206 A:middle
That will clear any
existing constraints I have

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:00.206 A:middle
That will clear any
existing constraints I have

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:04.166 A:middle
on just this view, and then
it will add some suggested

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:06.676 A:middle
constraints for me,
that sounds great.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:09.456 A:middle
So I select that, and you
can see it's added the exact

00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:12.606 A:middle
constraints that I would add
with Control-Drag, left, right,

00:19:12.926 --> 00:19:15.186 A:middle
spacing, and a height
constraint, perfect.

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.126 A:middle
That's exactly what I wanted.

00:19:17.126 --> 00:19:22.546 A:middle
And now, we build and run
our application, you will see

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:25.776 A:middle
that our layout comes up,
looks great in portrait

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:30.116 A:middle
and in landscape, well, OK,
horizontally it looks good.

00:19:30.116 --> 00:19:31.426 A:middle
We still got to work
on the vertical.

00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:34.016 A:middle
Let's go back to IB and
figure out what we need to do.

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:37.416 A:middle
We rotate that back,
we write Xcode.

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:39.836 A:middle
And if I select all my views, it
will show me all the constraints

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:43.426 A:middle
for those views, and there
is my obvious constraint

00:19:43.426 --> 00:19:44.406 A:middle
that I don't want anymore

00:19:44.406 --> 00:19:46.986 A:middle
which was this top
space to my superview.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.866 A:middle
I would really like all the
buttons to stay centered.

00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:52.766 A:middle
So, with Xcode 5, it's
very easy to get rid

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:53.906 A:middle
of a constraint I
no longer want.

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:55.716 A:middle
I just select it
and hit the Delete.

00:19:56.216 --> 00:20:01.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:56.216 --> 00:20:01.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:03.986 A:middle
Who knew that deleting
would be so exciting?

00:20:05.366 --> 00:20:05.716 A:middle
All right!

00:20:05.796 --> 00:20:07.536 A:middle
So let's add the constraint
that I actually want

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:10.466 A:middle
which is our center
vertically in our container.

00:20:10.726 --> 00:20:13.566 A:middle
OK. Now we should be
good if I build and run.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.416 A:middle
It looks great in
portrait, great in landscape.

00:20:17.976 --> 00:20:18.936 A:middle
All right!

00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:21.716 A:middle
So those are the first two ways
that we can add constraints.

00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:25.666 A:middle
Control drag and the Auto
Layout issue resolving menu.

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.716 A:middle
OK. Now we're going to move

00:20:28.716 --> 00:20:30.876 A:middle
on to a few more interesting
example is we're going

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.606 A:middle
to combine some of the different
techniques, and I'm going

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.796 A:middle
to show you the third way
that we add constraints.

00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:37.616 A:middle
So again, I can control
drag between views

00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:38.436 A:middle
to add the constraints.

00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:41.596 A:middle
I can control drag between
scenes to add actions

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:44.216 A:middle
and it just automatically
detects the context

00:20:44.216 --> 00:20:45.346 A:middle
and it gives me what I need.

00:20:45.636 --> 00:20:47.096 A:middle
In this case, I want
to add a push segue.

00:20:48.656 --> 00:20:51.006 A:middle
Now, in my new game
view controller,

00:20:51.006 --> 00:20:53.916 A:middle
we're going to add a few
different controls here.

00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:57.246 A:middle
We're going to add one for being
able to select my character

00:20:57.596 --> 00:21:00.096 A:middle
and I want to add one for
adjusting the strategy

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.596 --> 00:21:00.096 A:middle
and I want to add one for
adjusting the strategy

00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:03.286 A:middle
that I want, and then I
want a big old play button

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:04.686 A:middle
so I can start playing my game.

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:08.136 A:middle
Let's start with the play
button that sounds exciting.

00:21:08.706 --> 00:21:10.676 A:middle
So once again, I'm going to
drag out a button and I'm going

00:21:10.676 --> 00:21:13.766 A:middle
to give it my background
color, my design--

00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:15.426 A:middle
just for right now
until I get my artwork,

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:19.186 A:middle
which will someday be
delivered by my designers.

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:22.396 A:middle
I type in play here
and then let's go ahead

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:25.676 A:middle
and position this,
resize, snap, good.

00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:28.826 A:middle
I'm going to show you the third
way now to add constraints.

00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:32.506 A:middle
Control drag offered you a
precise way to add constraints,

00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
and you can add a few at once.

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:36.816 A:middle
And then the Auto Layout issue
resolving menu allowed you

00:21:36.816 --> 00:21:38.706 A:middle
to do broader strokes,
and now I'm going

00:21:38.706 --> 00:21:40.616 A:middle
to show you the
constraint-addition popover

00:21:40.616 --> 00:21:42.846 A:middle
where I can kind of do a
combination of all of that.

00:21:44.066 --> 00:21:47.686 A:middle
So down here in the
bottom right of my canvas,

00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:51.376 A:middle
I have my little pin
button, I can select that

00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:52.936 A:middle
and a popover comes up.

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:54.316 A:middle
And let me kind of
walk you through some

00:21:54.316 --> 00:21:55.436 A:middle
of the pieces of this popover.

00:21:56.006 --> 00:21:58.036 A:middle
At the top, we have
something called "Spacing

00:21:58.036 --> 00:22:00.616 A:middle
to Nearest Neighbor," OK,
what's the nearest neighbor?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.036 --> 00:22:00.616 A:middle
to Nearest Neighbor," OK,
what's the nearest neighbor?

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:03.786 A:middle
The nearest neighbor
is the nearest sibling

00:22:04.276 --> 00:22:05.766 A:middle
in the direction indicated.

00:22:05.766 --> 00:22:07.736 A:middle
So the nearest neighbor
off the left edge,

00:22:08.256 --> 00:22:09.686 A:middle
the nearest sibling
off the right edge,

00:22:09.716 --> 00:22:11.426 A:middle
bottom edge, top
edge, and so on.

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:14.316 A:middle
If there's no sibling, then
it picks the superview.

00:22:15.306 --> 00:22:17.936 A:middle
So in this case, it's
showing me that it's going

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:20.326 A:middle
to pick the superview 20 points
away 'cause I don't have any

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:22.626 A:middle
other siblings, and
so I can just select

00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:23.696 A:middle
that I want these
constraints just

00:22:23.696 --> 00:22:24.776 A:middle
by clicking these
little iBeams[phonetic].

00:22:25.236 --> 00:22:28.246 A:middle
So I want 20 on the leading,
trailing, and bottom edge.

00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:31.276 A:middle
And I can also add a
height constraint just

00:22:31.276 --> 00:22:32.386 A:middle
by checking height.

00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:36.726 A:middle
And then I can go ahead, add
my constraints and viola,

00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:39.206 A:middle
I have my constraints
really, really quickly.

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:45.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:46.676 A:middle
But it gets cooler.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:50.816 A:middle
So like I said, Interface
Builder,

00:22:50.906 --> 00:22:53.706 A:middle
you can do your Design Time
Layout and your Runtime Layout,

00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:54.916 A:middle
they're kind of--
they're separate,

00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:58.766 A:middle
but when I add constraints
I cannot do both my Runtime

00:22:58.826 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
and Design Time Layout
at the same time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.826 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
and Design Time Layout
at the same time

00:23:01.206 --> 00:23:03.186 A:middle
and let Auto Layout do
all the work for me.

00:23:03.516 --> 00:23:06.026 A:middle
So I'm going to add some buttons
to select between my archer

00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:07.686 A:middle
or my warrior characters.

00:23:08.216 --> 00:23:11.546 A:middle
Quick poll, warrior or archer?

00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:13.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Warrior.

00:23:14.666 --> 00:23:16.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's why
it's going first.

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:17.556 A:middle
All right!

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.656 A:middle
So we're going to
add a button here

00:23:18.656 --> 00:23:21.596 A:middle
and warrior will be
our first choice here.

00:23:22.156 --> 00:23:25.486 A:middle
And then I'm going to duplicate
this by this option dragging.

00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:27.466 A:middle
I'm going to call
this my archer.

00:23:28.856 --> 00:23:29.096 A:middle
All right!

00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:31.656 A:middle
So, I want these buttons
to be the same size,

00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:34.766 A:middle
I want to have them to be space,
all space apart, space the--

00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:36.376 A:middle
my container and at the top.

00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:41.406 A:middle
Now I could position and size
these all myself right now or,

00:23:41.406 --> 00:23:43.316 A:middle
again, I can let Auto
Layout do the work for me.

00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:45.026 A:middle
So I'm going to open

00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:47.636 A:middle
up my constraint-addition
popover again,

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.786 A:middle
and these text fields
are editable.

00:23:51.616 --> 00:23:54.296 A:middle
So what I can do
is punch in 20, 20,

00:23:54.866 --> 00:24:00.086 A:middle
20 and what that will do is
it will add a leading top

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:54.866 --> 00:24:00.086 A:middle
20 and what that will do is
it will add a leading top

00:24:00.396 --> 00:24:02.046 A:middle
and trailing constraint
at 20 each.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.526 A:middle
For both of these, it will
just do it to my container

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:07.766 A:middle
on the top, and then for
my warrior it will do it

00:24:07.796 --> 00:24:09.956 A:middle
to my superview,
and for my archer,

00:24:09.956 --> 00:24:10.926 A:middle
it will do it to the warrior.

00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:15.336 A:middle
On the trailing edge, it will
do archer to my superview

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:17.026 A:middle
and warrior to my archer.

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:19.926 A:middle
Kevin, you say, Kevin,
you're just going

00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.616 A:middle
to add two constraints
still in the middle.

00:24:22.306 --> 00:24:24.816 A:middle
When you add constraints using
the constraint-addition popover,

00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:27.296 A:middle
however, we will unique
the type of constraints

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:30.416 A:middle
so you're only end up
adding one of that type

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.386 A:middle
of constraint when
we go to add it.

00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:36.076 A:middle
Now, I can also say that I
want them to be the same width

00:24:36.176 --> 00:24:39.516 A:middle
and I can also give them a
height so my designer says,

00:24:39.696 --> 00:24:41.276 A:middle
"A hundred," I say, "Sure."

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:44.976 A:middle
And now, I can quickly
add the constraints button

00:24:45.006 --> 00:24:46.676 A:middle
which will not touch
my Design Time Layout,

00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:47.716 A:middle
I'll just add the constraints.

00:24:48.256 --> 00:24:51.686 A:middle
Or, I can click this nifty
add and update frames button,

00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:54.236 A:middle
it will add the constraints and
then it will size in position

00:24:54.236 --> 00:24:57.776 A:middle
to views in the canvas
to match the constraints.

00:24:58.326 --> 00:25:00.036 A:middle
So I click that, boom!

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.326 --> 00:25:00.036 A:middle
So I click that, boom!

00:25:00.036 --> 00:25:02.596 A:middle
Constraints and layout
all in one action.

00:25:03.096 --> 00:25:07.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:09.876 A:middle
And you could see how
this can help you get

00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:11.556 A:middle
through what you're going
for to show quickly.

00:25:11.556 --> 00:25:13.386 A:middle
You can just drag out views.

00:25:13.386 --> 00:25:14.586 A:middle
You don't really need to
[inaudible] their position,

00:25:14.586 --> 00:25:16.896 A:middle
you can add constraints
and let Auto Layout do

00:25:16.896 --> 00:25:17.486 A:middle
that work for you.

00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:18.836 A:middle
It's actually pretty cool.

00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:20.146 A:middle
All right!

00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:23.516 A:middle
So, you might be able to
tell what these pictures are,

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:25.066 A:middle
but I'm just going to
add some labels just

00:25:25.066 --> 00:25:27.576 A:middle
so that we make sure we know
what we're looking at here.

00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:32.596 A:middle
So I'm going to add
warrior label and position

00:25:32.596 --> 00:25:36.666 A:middle
that right here, and then
I'm going to do my archer.

00:25:37.246 --> 00:25:40.416 A:middle
Let's make sure he's centered.

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:43.756 A:middle
OK. Now I'm going to
combine techniques here

00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:45.056 A:middle
and show you how you can--

00:25:45.056 --> 00:25:47.286 A:middle
again, you can think
about layout in a way

00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:48.316 A:middle
that you want to think about it.

00:25:48.946 --> 00:25:53.266 A:middle
So I can Control-Drag
between my warrior to my--

00:25:53.456 --> 00:25:55.786 A:middle
label to my warrior image 'cause
I know I want a vertical space.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:59.016 A:middle
So I know I want vertical
spaces for both these labels

00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
through their respective
buttons.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
through their respective
buttons.

00:26:01.656 --> 00:26:02.866 A:middle
Now, I'm having stage fright

00:26:03.106 --> 00:26:04.886 A:middle
so I forget whatever
constraints I need to add.

00:26:05.446 --> 00:26:07.086 A:middle
Never fear, Interface
Builder is here to help you.

00:26:08.236 --> 00:26:11.296 A:middle
So they go to Auto Layout
resolving menu down here.

00:26:11.296 --> 00:26:13.176 A:middle
I'm going to point
out one other command

00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:14.746 A:middle
which is Add Missing Constrains.

00:26:15.246 --> 00:26:18.006 A:middle
What Add Missing Constrains
do is it will only add the

00:26:18.006 --> 00:26:20.706 A:middle
suggested constraints on
top of what you already have

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:23.786 A:middle
so that my constraints are
no longer orange so that--

00:26:23.786 --> 00:26:27.456 A:middle
the position and the size of
my view is fully specified.

00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:30.686 A:middle
So let's click that,
and you can see

00:26:30.686 --> 00:26:32.686 A:middle
that Interface Builder
has suggested to me

00:26:32.686 --> 00:26:34.646 A:middle
to center X constraints
and that's--

00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:36.236 A:middle
that's exactly what I want.

00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:36.866 A:middle
Now, remember.

00:26:37.866 --> 00:26:39.136 A:middle
Now what you notice again is

00:26:39.136 --> 00:26:40.916 A:middle
that Interface Builder
doesn't give us any width

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.706 A:middle
or height constraints,
and this goes back again

00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:43.756 A:middle
to what I was talking
about earlier

00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:45.306 A:middle
with this intrinsic
content size.

00:26:45.766 --> 00:26:48.026 A:middle
With things like labels that
have text or other things

00:26:48.026 --> 00:26:50.406 A:middle
that have text or content that
you don't want to get clipped,

00:26:51.096 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
you want to make sure that
the size is being driven

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:56.376 A:middle
by the intrinsic content size,
otherwise., when I localize this

00:26:56.376 --> 00:26:58.456 A:middle
in another language and
the strings get really long

00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:01.046 A:middle
or really short, they might
start occluding, overlapping,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:01.046 A:middle
or really short, they might
start occluding, overlapping,

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:03.006 A:middle
and I definitely
don't want that.

00:27:03.406 --> 00:27:04.536 A:middle
So that's why I don't
have any width

00:27:04.596 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
or height constraints
'cause that is coming

00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:08.306 A:middle
from the system for me.

00:27:09.106 --> 00:27:09.376 A:middle
All right!

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:12.286 A:middle
So, that's an example
of kind of mixing,

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.876 A:middle
mixing the different
patterns of approaches here.

00:27:15.876 --> 00:27:17.846 A:middle
And we're going to have
one more piece to our UI,

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:20.886 A:middle
which is to allow me
to adjust my strategy.

00:27:21.816 --> 00:27:24.346 A:middle
So I'm going to add a
slider that will allow me

00:27:24.346 --> 00:27:27.756 A:middle
to either be weak or slow.

00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:33.676 A:middle
So I got a slider here.

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:37.306 A:middle
And so based upon, you know,
how I'm feeling that day,

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:39.906 A:middle
maybe I'm really good
at attacking my enemies,

00:27:39.906 --> 00:27:40.936 A:middle
so I'm going to be
a little stronger.

00:27:40.936 --> 00:27:43.016 A:middle
Maybe I'm really good at
running, I'm probably good

00:27:43.016 --> 00:27:46.326 A:middle
at running away and so then
I can choose to be faster.

00:27:47.996 --> 00:27:50.616 A:middle
So what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to get an initial set

00:27:50.616 --> 00:27:53.286 A:middle
of constraints here so
we're going to go back

00:27:53.996 --> 00:27:55.906 A:middle
to our menu here, and this
is speed key for this,

00:27:56.326 --> 00:27:57.016 A:middle
so you can learn that

00:27:57.016 --> 00:27:59.346 A:middle
and quickly get the constraints
suggested that you want.

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.506 A:middle
And now, I got a
bunch of constraints

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.506 A:middle
And now, I got a
bunch of constraints

00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:03.796 A:middle
so let's go take a look
at what we got here.

00:28:03.796 --> 00:28:06.066 A:middle
And the way I'm going to
show you how to do that is,

00:28:06.066 --> 00:28:08.166 A:middle
in the Size Inspector you
can actually see a list

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:09.206 A:middle
of all of your constraints.

00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:14.466 A:middle
So if I select the weak label
and open the Size Inspector

00:28:14.466 --> 00:28:16.636 A:middle
and roll over this, you
can see the constraints

00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:18.646 A:middle
that have been added
for this view.

00:28:19.326 --> 00:28:22.486 A:middle
Now, I can see that this
top space here, well,

00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:23.926 A:middle
that's not really what I wanted.

00:28:24.296 --> 00:28:26.646 A:middle
So again, it's as easy, I
can select it in the canvas,

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:31.086 A:middle
or here I can just select it,
hit delete, and now it's gone.

00:28:31.296 --> 00:28:33.406 A:middle
So what I really want
is for my weak label

00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:37.096 A:middle
to be centered vertically
with my slider, I'm just going

00:28:37.096 --> 00:28:40.526 A:middle
to hold control, I'm going
to drag, and I'm going

00:28:40.526 --> 00:28:43.616 A:middle
to get a center Y constraint
and there now that looks great.

00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:45.626 A:middle
Let's build it and run it,

00:28:45.626 --> 00:28:49.206 A:middle
and see how it looks
after we run it.

00:28:51.586 --> 00:28:55.966 A:middle
OK, wonderful splash screen,
new game, oh it looks beautiful.

00:28:56.356 --> 00:28:59.916 A:middle
Let's rotate it and, well,
that's not exactly what I want.

00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:01.636 A:middle
We don't want that
stuff to overlap.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:01.636 A:middle
We don't want that
stuff to overlap.

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:04.636 A:middle
So I go and tell my
designer, "Hey, Mr. Designer,

00:29:05.516 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
this step is overlapping, I
need some more help here."

00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:12.576 A:middle
Now, he gives me one suggestion
which is to change the size

00:29:12.946 --> 00:29:17.636 A:middle
of my images here so I
say, "OK, let's do that."

00:29:18.586 --> 00:29:20.016 A:middle
So I have this two
height constraints, right,

00:29:20.016 --> 00:29:23.186 A:middle
that I've created, and I
can select both of those

00:29:24.556 --> 00:29:26.986 A:middle
and in the Attributes Inspector
I can change the value, he says,

00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:29.926 A:middle
"OK, they have to be
no smaller than 72."

00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:32.096 A:middle
Now I want to make
sure that my--

00:29:32.486 --> 00:29:36.946 A:middle
those two buttons for selecting
my character never clip, never,

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:40.356 A:middle
never crash my slider or overlap
with my slider so I'm going

00:29:40.356 --> 00:29:44.296 A:middle
to create a constraint between
my slider and my warrior label.

00:29:45.706 --> 00:29:48.476 A:middle
Now, when I drag that horizontal
line, as I got farther

00:29:48.476 --> 00:29:50.686 A:middle
and farther away, right,
it's unclear whether

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:52.796 A:middle
or not you want horizontal
constraints

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:53.746 A:middle
or vertical constraints.

00:29:53.986 --> 00:29:56.466 A:middle
So again, based upon that
line or actually in this case,

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:57.576 A:middle
we'll show you all the options

00:29:57.816 --> 00:30:00.056 A:middle
so that you can quickly create
the constraints that you want.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.816 --> 00:30:00.056 A:middle
so that you can quickly create
the constraints that you want.

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:02.596 A:middle
A little pro tip, if you
want to create both vertical

00:30:02.596 --> 00:30:05.296 A:middle
and horizontal at the same
time, just draw a diagonal line

00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:07.486 A:middle
and then you can select the
constraints that you need.

00:30:08.566 --> 00:30:13.666 A:middle
Now, I don't want it to be a
fixed-- fixed position, right?

00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:14.866 A:middle
I don't want it to
be a fixed space.

00:30:14.866 --> 00:30:15.886 A:middle
I want it to be able to be--

00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:18.336 A:middle
just make sure that they
don't run into each other.

00:30:18.336 --> 00:30:21.306 A:middle
So I'm going to change the
relation of this constraint

00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:23.346 A:middle
from a quality into
an inequality.

00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:27.106 A:middle
So, I can do that by
double-clicking the constraint.

00:30:27.656 --> 00:30:30.816 A:middle
Now this a-- this will be
available in a upcoming seed

00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:33.636 A:middle
of Xcode 5 and I'm going
to show it to you know.

00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:35.426 A:middle
So, by just like double-clicking

00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:38.246 A:middle
on the constraint I can
change the relation from equal

00:30:38.556 --> 00:30:41.156 A:middle
to greater than or equal,
and then for the constant,

00:30:41.336 --> 00:30:44.296 A:middle
I can open this up and I
can picture different kinds

00:30:44.296 --> 00:30:44.846 A:middle
of values here.

00:30:45.036 --> 00:30:47.616 A:middle
I can punch in the value
myself or I can say,

00:30:47.616 --> 00:30:49.806 A:middle
use the standard value or the
current candidate's value.

00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:52.456 A:middle
I'm going to select
standard and what this is

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:54.506 A:middle
that will give me what the
system thinks is the best

00:30:54.506 --> 00:30:56.146 A:middle
spacing in between
these two views.

00:30:56.146 --> 00:31:00.626 A:middle
So I'm just going to use the
standard space and there we go.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:56.146 --> 00:31:00.626 A:middle
So I'm just going to use the
standard space and there we go.

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:03.406 A:middle
Now that slider should
never get a--

00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:05.266 A:middle
never get occluded
by our warrior label.

00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:07.326 A:middle
Now, I can build,
run and preview this

00:31:07.326 --> 00:31:09.266 A:middle
or I can preview this
right inside of Xcode.

00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:11.646 A:middle
To do that I'm going
to use some--

00:31:11.646 --> 00:31:14.316 A:middle
a new feature of Xcode 5 which
is our preview assistant.

00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:17.326 A:middle
And I love tips and
tricks so I'm going

00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:18.556 A:middle
to keep giving you
guys tips and tricks.

00:31:19.126 --> 00:31:22.386 A:middle
I can quickly get to the preview
edit by opening assistant

00:31:22.586 --> 00:31:23.716 A:middle
or I can select it here.

00:31:23.716 --> 00:31:26.066 A:middle
But what I'm going to do
is I'm going to hold Option

00:31:26.356 --> 00:31:28.876 A:middle
and Shift when I select this.

00:31:30.086 --> 00:31:33.016 A:middle
And I'm going to get a little
navigator and this allows me

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
to target where I want to put
the thing that I'm opening.

00:31:36.456 --> 00:31:39.636 A:middle
So, this works with anything,
any file that you ever open,

00:31:39.706 --> 00:31:42.776 A:middle
any sort of link that
jumps you and opens a file,

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:45.056 A:middle
you can hold Option and Shift
and get this little picker.

00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:47.546 A:middle
I can pick a new window,
I can pick a new tab,

00:31:47.546 --> 00:31:50.536 A:middle
I can actually pick other splits
and other tabs that are open.

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:53.396 A:middle
Now, in this case I'm just going
to say opening the assistant.

00:31:53.446 --> 00:31:56.156 A:middle
And I'm going to select
that and you're going

00:31:56.156 --> 00:31:58.156 A:middle
to see it's open the
same view over here

00:31:58.536 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
but now I can change attributes
about this view to preview it.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.536 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
but now I can change attributes
about this view to preview it.

00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:04.486 A:middle
So for example, I can say,
what is it going to look

00:32:04.486 --> 00:32:08.946 A:middle
like in landscape and
you can see it's clipped.

00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:11.006 A:middle
Now, I'd been thinking to
myself, what does it look

00:32:11.006 --> 00:32:13.306 A:middle
like landscape in iOS 6?

00:32:13.686 --> 00:32:17.936 A:middle
I could change this or using
our little navigation control,

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.676 A:middle
I'm going to open
a second assistant.

00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:23.636 A:middle
So, again, I'm going to come
up here, preview, hold Option

00:32:23.636 --> 00:32:28.246 A:middle
and Shift and then I can
target a new split and enter

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:31.196 A:middle
and now I'm seeing another
view of the same view.

00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:34.756 A:middle
I can rotate this,
and set it to iOS 6.

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:38.206 A:middle
And now I can edit in
portrait and landscape

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:39.206 A:middle
for two operating systems.

00:32:45.076 --> 00:32:48.216 A:middle
So, this makes it really easy
to preview what you're doing.

00:32:48.926 --> 00:32:50.596 A:middle
OK, so now I'm going to show
it to you, I'm actually going

00:32:50.596 --> 00:32:52.096 A:middle
to show you one more thing too.

00:32:52.096 --> 00:32:53.396 A:middle
So, I'm actually going
to close the assistant.

00:32:53.436 --> 00:32:55.666 A:middle
We know that there's a problem
here but I actually want

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:58.006 A:middle
to see this in my main
editor and I actually

00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.506 A:middle
with that problem right,
right at my fingertips.

WEBVTT

with that problem right,
right at my fingertips.

00:33:01.716 --> 00:33:03.146 A:middle
So, to do that, I'm going

00:33:03.146 --> 00:33:05.126 A:middle
to show you what I
called simulated metrics.

00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:07.936 A:middle
And simulated metrics are
just a way for you to kind

00:33:07.936 --> 00:33:10.026 A:middle
of hint the Interface
Builder, hey at runtime.

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:12.926 A:middle
The stuff around my
ViewController is going to look

00:33:12.926 --> 00:33:16.416 A:middle
like this and that will allow us
to give you a design experience

00:33:16.486 --> 00:33:17.626 A:middle
that matches that environment.

00:33:18.836 --> 00:33:20.586 A:middle
So I can select my
ViewController

00:33:20.586 --> 00:33:21.526 A:middle
by clicking down here.

00:33:21.526 --> 00:33:23.276 A:middle
But I'm going to show
you another tip and trick

00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:26.276 A:middle
and I love tips and tricks
and that's the ability

00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:31.226 A:middle
to select views that might
be occluded in your UI.

00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:35.366 A:middle
So, if I hold Control and
Shift or just Shift right click

00:33:35.876 --> 00:33:39.626 A:middle
over my slider here
and select I get a menu

00:33:39.966 --> 00:33:42.446 A:middle
and this menu shows me
everything under the mouse

00:33:42.446 --> 00:33:43.406 A:middle
at this point in time.

00:33:44.346 --> 00:33:47.206 A:middle
And so you can see I have my
slider, my container view,

00:33:47.346 --> 00:33:49.906 A:middle
and my ViewController and
I can just quickly select

00:33:49.906 --> 00:33:50.476 A:middle
my ViewController.

And now I'm going to change
my orientation to landscape.

00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:02.766 A:middle
Again, this is just previewing
it right here and inside

00:34:02.766 --> 00:34:05.316 A:middle
of Interface Builder and there
sure enough, there's the problem

00:34:05.316 --> 00:34:06.866 A:middle
with my warrior label.

00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:09.456 A:middle
And what's happening is all the
constraints that we've added

00:34:09.456 --> 00:34:11.295 A:middle
so far have been required.

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.346 A:middle
And so, you've got
to fulfill this.

00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:17.505 A:middle
So, Auto Layout has followed
your beckoning and it's followed

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:19.666 A:middle
that but at the cost of
clipping some of my content

00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:20.596 A:middle
and I don't want this.

00:34:20.596 --> 00:34:22.295 A:middle
So, I'm going to show you
one of the powerful things

00:34:22.295 --> 00:34:24.806 A:middle
about Auto Layout which
is called priorities.

00:34:25.485 --> 00:34:30.476 A:middle
Priorities are a way that you
can indicate the preferability

00:34:30.476 --> 00:34:31.036 A:middle
of something.

00:34:32.005 --> 00:34:35.266 A:middle
So, in this case, you know, I
want my slider to be centered

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:37.065 A:middle
but if it's going
to clip my content,

00:34:37.235 --> 00:34:38.755 A:middle
well that's not exactly
what I want.

00:34:39.275 --> 00:34:43.516 A:middle
So, I can change the priority
of my constraint to be basically

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:44.616 A:middle
like try to be satisfied

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:46.846 A:middle
but if you can't be satisfied
then don't worry about it,

00:34:46.846 --> 00:34:47.766 A:middle
just get as close as you can.

00:34:49.025 --> 00:34:53.136 A:middle
So, I can select my slider and
select the horizontal, sorry,

00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:55.116 A:middle
the vertical centering
constraint, open that up.

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:57.866 A:middle
And again, I can
punch in a value

00:34:57.866 --> 00:34:59.526 A:middle
if I know what priority
I'm going for

00:34:59.816 --> 00:35:01.646 A:middle

some suggestions now

I can choose Required,
High, Low,

00:35:07.046 --> 00:35:10.126 A:middle
or what Interface Builder would
do is actually analyzes your

00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:12.186 A:middle
interface and it looks for
that content which is clipped.

00:35:12.296 --> 00:35:15.076 A:middle
It will figure out which
constraints are involved

00:35:15.076 --> 00:35:16.856 A:middle
in clipping that label
and it will figure

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:19.576 A:middle
out what priority needs to
be changed on that constraint

00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:21.476 A:middle
so that that label no
longer gets clipped.

00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:23.056 A:middle
And that's exactly what I want.

00:35:23.346 --> 00:35:31.606 A:middle

my slider out of the way.

And that is a brief look at
adding constraints with Xcode 5.

00:35:36.256 --> 00:35:39.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:40.136 --> 00:35:43.096 A:middle
All right, so what did
we see in this demo?

00:35:44.276 --> 00:35:45.506 A:middle
Again, with initial layout,

00:35:45.766 --> 00:35:47.446 A:middle
this is when you're first
adding your constraints

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:48.956 A:middle
and when you added
view, you haven't added

00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.446 A:middle
into constraints yet, it will
add them for you at build time

00:35:51.676 --> 00:35:53.226 A:middle
to fix that position and size.

00:35:53.226 --> 00:35:56.856 A:middle
I showed you three ways to add
constraints, using Control-Drag

00:35:56.856 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
for that fine control, using
the Auto Layout resolving menu

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.856 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
for that fine control, using
the Auto Layout resolving menu

00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:04.076 A:middle
for those kind of broader brush
strokes and finally the kind

00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:05.216 A:middle
of combination of all of it

00:36:05.416 --> 00:36:07.556 A:middle
which is this constraint
addition popover.

00:36:08.986 --> 00:36:11.116 A:middle
Now, one of the things that I
did was I kind of waved my hands

00:36:11.116 --> 00:36:12.756 A:middle
over a lot of kind of debugging

00:36:12.756 --> 00:36:14.046 A:middle
and resolving some
of the issues.

00:36:14.346 --> 00:36:15.806 A:middle
So, how do you see
what's going on?

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:18.316 A:middle
How do you identify those
problems and to do that,

00:36:18.316 --> 00:36:20.936 A:middle
I'm going to invite up my
co-worker Tony and he's going

00:36:20.936 --> 00:36:23.186 A:middle
to walk you through what
that looks like in Xcode 5.

00:36:23.186 --> 00:36:23.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:30.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kevin.

00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:32.626 A:middle
Good morning.

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:35.296 A:middle
My name is Tony Ricciardi
and I'm also an engineer

00:36:35.296 --> 00:36:36.226 A:middle
on the interface builder team.

00:36:36.726 --> 00:36:40.736 A:middle
So, Kevin just gave you
an overview of Auto Layout

00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:42.486 A:middle
and showed you how you can
get started adding constraints

00:36:42.486 --> 00:36:43.736 A:middle
to your views and
Interface Builder.

00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:46.326 A:middle
Now, I'm going to over the
next step which is debugging

00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:48.536 A:middle
and resolving any issues you
might encounter while designing

00:36:48.536 --> 00:36:49.506 A:middle
your layout.

00:36:51.496 --> 00:36:53.996 A:middle
All right, so as you add
and remove constraints

00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:56.006 A:middle
to your views, your
layout will transition

00:36:56.006 --> 00:36:57.146 A:middle
through intermediate states.

00:36:57.726 --> 00:36:59.676 A:middle
And you can think of this like
you would think of writing code.

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:01.796 A:middle
If you were to build and
run your app in the middle

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:01.796 A:middle
If you were to build and
run your app in the middle

00:37:01.796 --> 00:37:03.896 A:middle
of writing a line of code,
it probably wouldn't compile

00:37:04.336 --> 00:37:06.096 A:middle
or even if it did, it probably
wouldn't do what you want

00:37:06.096 --> 00:37:06.416 A:middle
at runtime.

00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:08.696 A:middle
So, in the same way, your layout

00:37:08.696 --> 00:37:10.006 A:middle
and interface builder
won't always be

00:37:10.006 --> 00:37:12.066 A:middle
in a complete state
and ready to run.

00:37:13.556 --> 00:37:14.976 A:middle
There are three different types

00:37:14.976 --> 00:37:17.056 A:middle
of intermediate states
you'll encounter.

00:37:17.696 --> 00:37:20.846 A:middle
First you can have an ambiguous
frame which means you haven't

00:37:20.846 --> 00:37:22.856 A:middle
yet added enough information
to one of your views

00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:24.176 A:middle
to fully specify its layout.

00:37:25.456 --> 00:37:27.286 A:middle
On the other hand, you
can also add too much

00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:30.346 A:middle
in which case you might end up
with conflicting constraints.

00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:34.386 A:middle
And third, you can also
have a misplaced view

00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:35.726 A:middle
which means your view's frame

00:37:35.726 --> 00:37:37.876 A:middle
in the Interface Builder
canvas doesn't match the size

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:38.376 A:middle
and position.

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:40.266 A:middle
It's going to have at runtime
based on its constraints.

00:37:40.306 --> 00:37:42.526 A:middle
So, I'm going to into
little more detail in each

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.786 A:middle
of these three intermediate
states

00:37:43.786 --> 00:37:44.726 A:middle
and show you few examples.

00:37:44.726 --> 00:37:46.856 A:middle
And then after that I'm
going to head over to Xcode

00:37:46.966 --> 00:37:48.266 A:middle
and show you some new
features we've added

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.836 A:middle
to help you quickly diagnose
and resolve these issues.

00:37:51.196 --> 00:37:54.716 A:middle
All right, so first we
have ambiguous frames.

00:37:55.746 --> 00:37:58.076 A:middle
You can get an ambiguous
frame simply

00:37:58.076 --> 00:38:00.296 A:middle
by just not adding enough
constraints to your view.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.076 --> 00:38:00.296 A:middle
by just not adding enough
constraints to your view.

00:38:00.766 --> 00:38:03.396 A:middle
So, if you we take my example
here with my warrior imageView,

00:38:03.946 --> 00:38:06.136 A:middle
I've added three constraints,
one for the top space,

00:38:06.136 --> 00:38:07.456 A:middle
one for the height
and one for the width.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:12.226 A:middle
And together these three
constraints specify its size

00:38:12.226 --> 00:38:13.296 A:middle
and its vertical position

00:38:13.746 --> 00:38:15.946 A:middle
but they live its
horizontal position ambiguous.

00:38:16.366 --> 00:38:18.256 A:middle
And you can imagine if I
were to rotate the device,

00:38:18.466 --> 00:38:19.866 A:middle
the system wouldn't
know whether I want

00:38:19.866 --> 00:38:21.846 A:middle
to keep it centered
horizontally or keep

00:38:21.846 --> 00:38:26.266 A:middle
at the same distance
from the left.

00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:28.346 A:middle
Here's a slightly more
interesting example

00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:28.916 A:middle
of ambiguity.

00:38:29.326 --> 00:38:30.476 A:middle
Let's say, now I have two labels

00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:33.376 A:middle
with a horizontal spacing
constraint between them

00:38:33.596 --> 00:38:35.566 A:middle
and I have another
constraint between each label

00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:36.356 A:middle
at the edge of each container.

00:38:37.396 --> 00:38:40.076 A:middle
When I rotate the device,
the total horizontal space

00:38:40.076 --> 00:38:42.646 A:middle
in the container grows and
one of those labels need

00:38:42.646 --> 00:38:44.586 A:middle
to be stretched to fill
in that extra space.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.296 A:middle
Without any more information
the system doesn't know

00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:48.546 A:middle
which label I want to stretch.

00:38:48.546 --> 00:38:50.786 A:middle
So, my layout is
once again ambiguous.

00:38:51.426 --> 00:38:55.796 A:middle
So you can get conflicting
constraints

00:38:56.186 --> 00:38:58.546 A:middle
by over constraining
your view and it could be

00:38:58.546 --> 00:38:59.706 A:middle
as simple as this example here.

00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.936 A:middle
I've added two-- two
height constraints

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.936 A:middle
I've added two-- two
height constraints

00:39:01.936 --> 00:39:03.726 A:middle
to my warrior imageView
saying it

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:06.866 A:middle
to be two different
heights at the same time.

00:39:06.866 --> 00:39:08.936 A:middle
You can also get them in
slightly more subtle ways.

00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:11.656 A:middle
Let's say instead that I
have three constraints,

00:39:11.946 --> 00:39:13.866 A:middle
one for the top space,
one for the bottom space

00:39:13.866 --> 00:39:14.796 A:middle
and then one for the height.

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:17.526 A:middle
And together they
add up to the--

00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:20.846 A:middle
the height of my screen
in landscape mode but then

00:39:20.846 --> 00:39:24.096 A:middle
when I rotate the device the--
the height of the screen grows

00:39:24.096 --> 00:39:27.366 A:middle
and now those constraints create
a conflict with the screen size.

00:39:29.736 --> 00:39:34.046 A:middle
The third type of issue is
misplaced views and this happens

00:39:34.046 --> 00:39:37.186 A:middle
when you resize or you
reposition your view

00:39:37.186 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
in Interface Builder without
updating its constraints.

00:39:40.436 --> 00:39:42.536 A:middle
So, let's say that now that
I have four constraints

00:39:42.536 --> 00:39:46.446 A:middle
that fully specify my imageViews
layout and it's not ambiguous,

00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:48.856 A:middle
it does not have any
conflicts but then I decided,

00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:50.646 A:middle
I really want to have
it centered vertically

00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:51.376 A:middle
in that container.

00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:54.576 A:middle
So, I just drag it down to the
center in Interface Builder

00:39:54.776 --> 00:39:57.236 A:middle
and not it's misplaced because
I still have that constraint

00:39:57.236 --> 00:39:59.626 A:middle
at the top saying it should
be 20 points from the top.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.466 --> 00:40:02.406 A:middle
So, interface builder
doesn't automatically update

00:40:02.406 --> 00:40:03.326 A:middle
your constraints.

00:40:03.376 --> 00:40:05.686 A:middle
And that's because it doesn't
know what your intent is.

00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:06.566 A:middle
It doesn't know whether you'd--

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:09.386 A:middle
whether I want to update
that height constraint

00:40:09.386 --> 00:40:12.106 A:middle
and just stretch it down to the
middle or that I want to get rid

00:40:12.106 --> 00:40:15.036 A:middle
of it and replace it with a
vertical centering constraint.

00:40:15.526 --> 00:40:17.586 A:middle
So, rather than pick one
of those options for you,

00:40:17.586 --> 00:40:19.816 A:middle
it just makes it really easy
to update your misplaced view.

00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:25.056 A:middle
All right, so-- so those were
the three different types

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:28.566 A:middle
of intermediate states and we've
added a ton of new features

00:40:28.566 --> 00:40:31.226 A:middle
to Xcode to help you quickly
debug and resolve these issues.

00:40:31.226 --> 00:40:32.576 A:middle
And the best way to show
you those features are

00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:36.246 A:middle
with the demo, so I'm going
to head over to Xcode now.

00:40:36.246 --> 00:40:37.446 A:middle
OK, let's start with
top one here.

00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:39.636 A:middle
I'll select and drag
up on its [inaudible].

00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:42.756 A:middle
OK, so when I did that,
a couple things happened.

00:40:43.896 --> 00:40:46.206 A:middle
First I got that dashed
rectangle and it tells me

00:40:46.206 --> 00:40:47.406 A:middle
that my button is misplaced.

00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:49.956 A:middle
And at runtime its
frame is going to be

00:40:49.956 --> 00:40:50.866 A:middle
where you see the dashes.

00:40:52.126 --> 00:40:55.536 A:middle
Also, over here my height
constraint turned orange

00:40:55.726 --> 00:40:56.906 A:middle
and I got this little badge.

00:40:56.996 --> 00:41:00.246 A:middle
So, that tells me that it's
currently 32 point shorter

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:56.996 --> 00:41:00.246 A:middle
So, that tells me that it's
currently 32 point shorter

00:41:00.246 --> 00:41:01.776 A:middle
than the height of the
button in the canvas

00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:04.016 A:middle
and that it explains
why it's misplaced.

00:41:04.016 --> 00:41:05.616 A:middle
I need to update that
height constraint.

00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:09.106 A:middle
So, I could do that by selecting
the height constraint and going

00:41:09.106 --> 00:41:11.306 A:middle
over the inspector and adding
32 points to its value.

00:41:11.846 --> 00:41:13.886 A:middle
But this is a very
common type of operation.

00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:15.196 A:middle
So, we've got a short
cut for doing that.

00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:20.686 A:middle
So instead, I'm going to head
down here, and what I'm going

00:41:20.686 --> 00:41:23.836 A:middle
to do is use this command
here, Update Constraints.

00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:27.516 A:middle
So, this looks at your
selected view, and it looks

00:41:27.516 --> 00:41:28.986 A:middle
at all the constraints
that are touching it,

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.436 A:middle
and it updates their values

00:41:30.436 --> 00:41:31.856 A:middle
to reflect its current
frame in the canvas.

00:41:32.726 --> 00:41:35.156 A:middle
So when I click that, it's going
to update my height constraint

00:41:35.156 --> 00:41:38.426 A:middle
over there, and you can see
now it's no longer misplaced.

00:41:39.116 --> 00:41:43.956 A:middle
All right, let's move
on to the other buttons.

00:41:43.956 --> 00:41:46.476 A:middle
I could follow the exact
same, the back exacts in step,

00:41:46.476 --> 00:41:49.976 A:middle
so I could just resize them and
update their height constraints.

00:41:50.336 --> 00:41:52.336 A:middle
But then I'd have to make sure
I made them all exactly the

00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:52.856 A:middle
same height.

00:41:53.486 --> 00:41:54.226 A:middle
So instead, what I'm going

00:41:54.226 --> 00:41:55.796 A:middle
to do is create an Equal
Heights constraint.

00:41:56.556 --> 00:42:00.836 A:middle
I'm going to Control-Drag down
here and choose Equal Heights.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:56.556 --> 00:42:00.836 A:middle
I'm going to Control-Drag down
here and choose Equal Heights.

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:03.976 A:middle
So, this constraint is going to
make the system enforce the fact

00:42:03.976 --> 00:42:05.006 A:middle
that they all have
the same height.

00:42:05.576 --> 00:42:07.896 A:middle
So, I choose that,
I get a conflict.

00:42:08.576 --> 00:42:10.746 A:middle
The reason why I got a conflict
is I still have this old height

00:42:10.746 --> 00:42:12.806 A:middle
constraint here,
and it's telling me

00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:15.166 A:middle
that it's 43 points tall.

00:42:15.496 --> 00:42:18.346 A:middle
So, now I have that constraint
saying it should be 43 points,

00:42:18.706 --> 00:42:20.846 A:middle
and I also went and added
that Equal Heights constraint,

00:42:21.096 --> 00:42:22.026 A:middle
saying it should
be the same height

00:42:22.026 --> 00:42:24.066 A:middle
as the Top button
which is 75 points.

00:42:25.036 --> 00:42:26.836 A:middle
So, I need to delete
one of these constraints

00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:27.736 A:middle
to resolve this conflict.

00:42:28.736 --> 00:42:30.816 A:middle
I'm just going to delete
that old height constraint

00:42:30.866 --> 00:42:35.356 A:middle
because it's-- I don't
need that anymore.

00:42:35.446 --> 00:42:36.466 A:middle
All right, so I did that.

00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:41.156 A:middle
I got rid of the conflict, but
now my button is still misplaced

00:42:41.156 --> 00:42:44.556 A:middle
because its-- the frame in
the canvas hasn't-- has--

00:42:44.556 --> 00:42:46.946 A:middle
is no longer reflecting that
Equal Heights constraint.

00:42:48.376 --> 00:42:50.426 A:middle
So, I could resolve
this by going

00:42:50.426 --> 00:42:52.146 A:middle
into the button's size inspector

00:42:52.616 --> 00:42:54.986 A:middle
and adding 32 points
to its height.

00:42:55.096 --> 00:42:58.106 A:middle
But again, this is a very
common type of operation,

00:42:58.106 --> 00:42:59.766 A:middle
so we've added another
shortcut for doing that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.196 --> 00:43:02.106 A:middle
And that's over here in
the bottom of the canvas,

00:43:02.436 --> 00:43:04.136 A:middle
back in our Auto Layout menu.

00:43:04.136 --> 00:43:06.886 A:middle
So this time, I'm going
to choose Update Frames.

00:43:08.106 --> 00:43:11.626 A:middle
Update Frames resizes and
repositions your views according

00:43:11.626 --> 00:43:13.526 A:middle
to their constraints,
so it makes their frame

00:43:13.526 --> 00:43:15.676 A:middle
in the canvas match
their frame at runtime.

00:43:16.686 --> 00:43:21.116 A:middle
When I choose that, now my
button is no longer misplaced

00:43:21.116 --> 00:43:25.366 A:middle
and it's resized
just like I wanted.

00:43:25.456 --> 00:43:27.016 A:middle
All right, let's do the same
thing for the Middle button.

00:43:27.016 --> 00:43:29.226 A:middle
I'm going to start by deleting
its height constraints,

00:43:29.226 --> 00:43:31.466 A:middle
so it doesn't-- so I don't
run into that conflict.

00:43:31.866 --> 00:43:35.246 A:middle
And I'm going to
Control-Drag down and add

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:39.046 A:middle
that Equal Heights constraint.

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:41.396 A:middle
OK, so now my Middle
button is misplaced

00:43:42.126 --> 00:43:46.256 A:middle
because I have an updated site
and by virtue of growing taller,

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.926 A:middle
it's going to push apart
those other two buttons.

00:43:48.176 --> 00:43:50.026 A:middle
So now actually if I
select these buttons,

00:43:50.026 --> 00:43:51.606 A:middle
you can see they're
all misplaced.

00:43:51.606 --> 00:43:53.516 A:middle
They're all either in the wrong
position or have the wrong set.

00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:56.906 A:middle
So, let's go back to the
menu and update their frames.

00:43:59.496 --> 00:44:02.406 A:middle
This time, I want to
point out the fact

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.496 --> 00:44:02.406 A:middle
This time, I want to
point out the fact

00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:04.796 A:middle
that this menu is
divided into two halves,

00:44:05.146 --> 00:44:06.016 A:middle
so we're zooming down here.

00:44:06.576 --> 00:44:08.626 A:middle
It's divided into two halves.

00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:10.896 A:middle
On the top half, we
have command that apply

00:44:10.896 --> 00:44:13.586 A:middle
to the currently selected
view, and on the bottom half,

00:44:13.986 --> 00:44:16.066 A:middle
we have commands that
apply to all views

00:44:16.066 --> 00:44:17.926 A:middle
in the current scene
in your story board.

00:44:18.896 --> 00:44:23.286 A:middle
So in this case, I want to
choose update all the frames

00:44:23.386 --> 00:44:24.846 A:middle
in my splash screen
view controller.

00:44:24.886 --> 00:44:26.546 A:middle
So that's going to apply
that update frames command

00:44:26.546 --> 00:44:27.556 A:middle
to all three buttons at once.

00:44:28.496 --> 00:44:33.526 A:middle
When I do that, it resizes or
repositions all three buttons,

00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:34.856 A:middle
and now they're not
misplaced anymore.

00:44:34.856 --> 00:44:35.086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:42.516 A:middle
OK, so you just saw a
couple different ways

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.646 A:middle
to resolve misplaced views.

00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:47.036 A:middle
Now, I'm going to move
on to ambiguous frames.

00:44:47.736 --> 00:44:48.916 A:middle
And to that, I'm going
to head over here

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:50.256 A:middle
to my load game view controller.

00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:55.006 A:middle
OK, so this is a
table view controller,

00:44:55.006 --> 00:44:56.326 A:middle
and it has a prototype cell.

00:44:57.116 --> 00:44:59.226 A:middle
That prototype cell is going
to get reused at runtime

00:44:59.226 --> 00:45:01.376 A:middle
for every saved game
that the player can load.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.226 --> 00:45:01.376 A:middle
for every saved game
that the player can load.

00:45:02.236 --> 00:45:03.876 A:middle
And the cell has a
couple of labels here,

00:45:03.876 --> 00:45:07.856 A:middle
and those represent the name,
the name of my character

00:45:07.856 --> 00:45:09.486 A:middle
and the date that I last
played with that character.

00:45:10.406 --> 00:45:11.396 A:middle
And when I select these labels,

00:45:11.396 --> 00:45:13.406 A:middle
you can see they currently don't
have any constraints on them,

00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:16.296 A:middle
so at runtime, they're going to
have fixed sizes, fixed frames,

00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:17.756 A:middle
fixed positions and sizes.

00:45:18.626 --> 00:45:21.776 A:middle
So, I want to hit Build and Run
now, and so you can take a look

00:45:22.316 --> 00:45:23.806 A:middle
at this table view without,

00:45:23.806 --> 00:45:25.066 A:middle
before I start adding
constraints.

00:45:25.066 --> 00:45:30.856 A:middle
All right, so here's our splash
screen, I'm just going to tap

00:45:30.856 --> 00:45:33.006 A:middle
on Load Game, and
here's our table view.

00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:35.586 A:middle
And so you can see all the
labels are getting clipped,

00:45:35.586 --> 00:45:37.886 A:middle
and that's because
those static sizes

00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:39.526 A:middle
that we gave them
are just too short

00:45:39.526 --> 00:45:41.196 A:middle
to fit their content at runtime.

00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:43.956 A:middle
So, let's go back to IB
and add some constraints

00:45:43.956 --> 00:45:45.056 A:middle
to let them grow dynamically.

00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:50.456 A:middle
[pause] Let's start with
our date label here.

00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:52.706 A:middle
I'm just going to
Control-Drag over

00:45:52.736 --> 00:45:55.206 A:middle
and add a leading space
constraint, that's just going

00:45:55.206 --> 00:45:56.416 A:middle
to pin it to the left
side of the cell.

00:45:56.976 --> 00:46:00.466 A:middle
And when I did that, it gave
me an orange constraint.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:56.976 --> 00:46:00.466 A:middle
And when I did that, it gave
me an orange constraint.

00:46:00.996 --> 00:46:04.746 A:middle
It's orange because my
date label is ambiguous,

00:46:05.536 --> 00:46:11.446 A:middle
and I can also see this at
the top of the canvas up here

00:46:11.446 --> 00:46:14.876 A:middle
in the-- in our mini navigator.

00:46:15.136 --> 00:46:16.826 A:middle
So, this button here
is a mini navigator

00:46:16.826 --> 00:46:17.966 A:middle
and it gives you a quick summary

00:46:17.966 --> 00:46:19.716 A:middle
of all the unresolved
issues in your document.

00:46:20.026 --> 00:46:22.896 A:middle
So when I click that, it tells
me the vertical position is

00:46:22.896 --> 00:46:24.026 A:middle
ambiguous for my date label.

00:46:24.496 --> 00:46:28.906 A:middle
So, that makes sense because
we've only added a single

00:46:29.196 --> 00:46:30.946 A:middle
horizontal constraint.

00:46:30.946 --> 00:46:32.356 A:middle
So, we need to add
more constraints

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:33.966 A:middle
to fully specify its position.

00:46:34.266 --> 00:46:37.186 A:middle
I could keep adding
constraints to each of my labels

00:46:37.186 --> 00:46:38.846 A:middle
until they're unambiguous,
but instead I'm going

00:46:38.846 --> 00:46:39.766 A:middle
to use another shortcut.

00:46:40.076 --> 00:46:42.876 A:middle
So, when I head back to this
menu, and this time I'm going

00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:45.016 A:middle
to choose Add Missing
constraints

00:46:45.016 --> 00:46:46.076 A:middle
and Load Game Table at the cell.

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:46.996 A:middle
So, it's going to apply

00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:49.306 A:middle
that same Add Missing
constraints command

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.626 A:middle
that Kevin showed you, and
it's going to apply it to all--

00:46:51.626 --> 00:46:52.646 A:middle
both my labels at once.

00:46:52.886 --> 00:46:56.346 A:middle
So when I choose that,
my constraints turn blue

00:46:56.556 --> 00:46:58.466 A:middle
and you can see now I
have four constraints.

00:46:59.156 --> 00:47:02.256 A:middle
And these are enough to
fully specify the layout

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.156 --> 00:47:02.256 A:middle
And these are enough to
fully specify the layout

00:47:02.256 --> 00:47:04.146 A:middle
of my two labels.

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.516 A:middle
So, I got a leading
space constraint.

00:47:07.516 --> 00:47:08.716 A:middle
I got a top space constraint.

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.086 A:middle
I got a baseline alignment
constraint that's going

00:47:11.086 --> 00:47:12.366 A:middle
to align the two
labels vertically.

00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:16.086 A:middle
And I got a little horizontal
spacing constraint between them.

00:47:16.496 --> 00:47:19.286 A:middle
So, you might be wondering
why I didn't get any with

00:47:19.286 --> 00:47:21.796 A:middle
or height constraints, and
that gets back to the idea

00:47:21.796 --> 00:47:24.716 A:middle
of this intrinsic content
size that we get from UILabel.

00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:26.946 A:middle
So at runtime, it's going
to infer its size based

00:47:26.946 --> 00:47:29.996 A:middle
on its content and that's
going to let it grow and resize

00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:32.356 A:middle
and our labels won't
be clipped anymore.

00:47:33.236 --> 00:47:34.766 A:middle
So, let's see what
that looks like.

00:47:42.156 --> 00:47:44.856 A:middle
[Pause] All right, so now
our labels are no longer

00:47:44.856 --> 00:47:45.436 A:middle
getting clipped.

00:47:46.266 --> 00:47:49.086 A:middle
The first two cells look
great and the third cell,

00:47:49.086 --> 00:47:50.546 A:middle
I have a character with
a really long name,

00:47:50.946 --> 00:47:53.276 A:middle
and that's just running right
off the edge of the cell,

00:47:54.056 --> 00:47:57.046 A:middle
and it's actually occluding
my disclosure indicator here.

00:47:58.236 --> 00:48:00.196 A:middle
So, what I want to do
is add a little padding

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:58.236 --> 00:48:00.196 A:middle
So, what I want to do
is add a little padding

00:48:00.196 --> 00:48:01.556 A:middle
on the right side, so that

00:48:01.556 --> 00:48:04.116 A:middle
that name label gets
clipped before it runs

00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:06.026 A:middle
over in the disclosure
indicator, so let's do that.

00:48:06.076 --> 00:48:12.166 A:middle
All right, so I'll
just control-drag over

00:48:12.166 --> 00:48:13.476 A:middle
and choose trailing space.

00:48:14.046 --> 00:48:16.366 A:middle
And that gave me a bit
more padding that I wanted,

00:48:16.366 --> 00:48:19.846 A:middle
so I'm just going to double
click it and choose 40 points.

00:48:21.196 --> 00:48:22.806 A:middle
So I did that, I
got a new issue.

00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:25.296 A:middle
This is a new type of ambiguity.

00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:27.866 A:middle
And it's ambiguous
because if you add

00:48:27.866 --> 00:48:30.506 A:middle
up the 3 horizontal constraints
we have and the widths

00:48:30.506 --> 00:48:32.346 A:middle
of the two labels,
it doesn't quite add

00:48:32.346 --> 00:48:33.456 A:middle
up to the full width
of the cell.

00:48:34.086 --> 00:48:36.836 A:middle
And so one of those labels
needs to be stretched to fill

00:48:36.836 --> 00:48:39.196 A:middle
in the extra space, and I
haven't told Interface Builder

00:48:39.196 --> 00:48:41.266 A:middle
which one I want to resize yet.

00:48:42.076 --> 00:48:44.946 A:middle
For situations like this when
you encounter a new issue,

00:48:45.066 --> 00:48:46.726 A:middle
and maybe you're not
familiar with it,

00:48:46.726 --> 00:48:47.986 A:middle
you're not sure how
to resolve it.

00:48:47.986 --> 00:48:49.826 A:middle
You want to get some
suggestions on how to fix it.

00:48:50.186 --> 00:48:52.466 A:middle
You can always head over to the
Interface Builder outline view,

00:48:52.556 --> 00:48:53.476 A:middle
and get some information.

00:48:53.826 --> 00:48:55.246 A:middle
So, let's do that.

00:48:57.806 --> 00:48:59.916 A:middle
If you look here by my
load game view controller,

00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:01.946 A:middle
you can see I have
this button here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:01.946 A:middle
you can see I have
this button here.

00:49:02.236 --> 00:49:04.806 A:middle
And that's-- that indicates

00:49:04.886 --> 00:49:07.226 A:middle
that I have unresolved Auto
Layout issues in that scene.

00:49:07.956 --> 00:49:10.866 A:middle
When I click on that,
the AL view slides over

00:49:11.326 --> 00:49:13.236 A:middle
and I get a list of
the unresolved issues.

00:49:14.166 --> 00:49:16.906 A:middle
Here's telling tell me I have
content priority ambiguity.

00:49:17.396 --> 00:49:21.746 A:middle
All right, and I can find

00:49:21.746 --> 00:49:25.016 A:middle
out what content
priority ambiguity is by--

00:49:25.246 --> 00:49:26.606 A:middle
there we go, clicking
on this button here.

00:49:26.686 --> 00:49:28.696 A:middle
It gives me a detailed
explanation

00:49:28.696 --> 00:49:30.116 A:middle
of content priority ambiguity.

00:49:30.876 --> 00:49:35.796 A:middle
Oh, OK. And here in the second
paragraph, it says to fix,

00:49:35.796 --> 00:49:38.106 A:middle
I need to increase or
decrease the content priority

00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:38.576 A:middle
of my labels.

00:49:38.996 --> 00:49:40.746 A:middle
So, you could think
of content priority

00:49:40.746 --> 00:49:42.956 A:middle
as how strongly a
view wants to remain

00:49:42.956 --> 00:49:44.286 A:middle
at its intrinsic content size?

00:49:45.006 --> 00:49:47.996 A:middle
And in this case, I want my
Name label to get stretched

00:49:47.996 --> 00:49:49.886 A:middle
or clipped more easily
than my Date label.

00:49:50.236 --> 00:49:51.936 A:middle
So, I wanted the content
priority to be lower

00:49:51.936 --> 00:49:53.346 A:middle
than my Date label's
content priority.

00:49:57.236 --> 00:50:01.116 A:middle
If I click on this button
here, it gives me a suggestion

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:57.236 --> 00:50:01.116 A:middle
If I click on this button
here, it gives me a suggestion

00:50:01.436 --> 00:50:05.226 A:middle
for how I might want
to fix this issue.

00:50:05.436 --> 00:50:08.946 A:middle
So, it's offering to
decrease the content priority

00:50:08.946 --> 00:50:09.676 A:middle
of my Name label.

00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:11.586 A:middle
And wants it to make--
wants to make it lower

00:50:11.586 --> 00:50:13.906 A:middle
than my Date label's priority,
and that's exactly what I want.

00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:15.536 A:middle
So, I'm just going to
choose Change Priority.

00:50:16.066 --> 00:50:21.606 A:middle
And when I did that, oh, you
can see my labels are no longer

00:50:21.606 --> 00:50:22.366 A:middle
marked as ambiguous.

00:50:22.366 --> 00:50:23.256 A:middle
They have blue constraints.

00:50:23.326 --> 00:50:32.966 A:middle
So, let's hit Build and Run
and take a look at that.

00:50:32.966 --> 00:50:33.176 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:50:33.176 --> 00:50:33.796 A:middle
OK, there we go.

00:50:33.866 --> 00:50:36.616 A:middle
So now, it's getting clipped
with a little bit of padding,

00:50:36.776 --> 00:50:40.616 A:middle
and it's no longer occluding
that disclosure indicator.

00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:46.826 A:middle
All right, so just saw a couple
different types of ambiguity,

00:50:47.276 --> 00:50:48.986 A:middle
and I showed you a
couple of different ways

00:50:48.986 --> 00:50:50.296 A:middle
to resolve that ambiguity.

00:50:50.636 --> 00:50:52.126 A:middle
There's just one more
feature I'd like to show you

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.506 A:middle
which is useful when you
defined your own custom

00:50:54.506 --> 00:50:56.696 A:middle
controlling code.

00:50:56.756 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
And so for this example,
let's imagine that instead

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:56.756 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
And so for this example,
let's imagine that instead

00:51:00.076 --> 00:51:01.036 A:middle
of this Date label here.

00:51:01.376 --> 00:51:03.696 A:middle
I want to use my own
custom data control

00:51:03.696 --> 00:51:04.736 A:middle
that I've implemented in code.

00:51:05.406 --> 00:51:07.236 A:middle
Actually, I already have a
scene and the story board set

00:51:07.236 --> 00:51:09.466 A:middle
up that way, so I'm going
to scroll over down here.

00:51:10.056 --> 00:51:15.856 A:middle
OK, so this is the exact same
table view only we have replaced

00:51:15.856 --> 00:51:17.626 A:middle
that Date label with UIView,

00:51:17.626 --> 00:51:19.716 A:middle
and that UIView has
its custom class set

00:51:19.716 --> 00:51:22.696 A:middle
to my date control class.

00:51:22.876 --> 00:51:24.586 A:middle
You can see when I select
it, I already have a bunch

00:51:24.586 --> 00:51:26.546 A:middle
of constraints, and I
can get more details

00:51:26.546 --> 00:51:28.516 A:middle
on those constraints in the
size inspector over here.

00:51:29.656 --> 00:51:31.816 A:middle
And in particular, I want to
point out that it has a width

00:51:31.816 --> 00:51:32.536 A:middle
and a height constraint.

00:51:33.626 --> 00:51:36.096 A:middle
So, earlier I mentioned
you don't want to add--

00:51:36.096 --> 00:51:38.236 A:middle
you don't want to add explicit
width or height constraints

00:51:38.476 --> 00:51:40.516 A:middle
to views that define
intrinsic content sizes

00:51:40.516 --> 00:51:43.926 A:middle
because then you risk clipping
or getting somewhere in padding.

00:51:45.116 --> 00:51:47.936 A:middle
And my date control does define
an intrinsic content size.

00:51:49.116 --> 00:51:50.576 A:middle
However, Interface
Builder only knows

00:51:50.576 --> 00:51:53.366 A:middle
about the built-in
system controls.

00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:55.266 A:middle
It doesn't know about this
intrinsic content size

00:51:55.266 --> 00:51:56.306 A:middle
that I have implemented in code.

00:51:57.236 --> 00:52:04.366 A:middle
And when I delete these
height constraints,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:57.236 --> 00:52:04.366 A:middle
And when I delete these
height constraints,

00:52:04.366 --> 00:52:07.246 A:middle
my view is ambiguous because
Interface Builder doesn't have

00:52:07.246 --> 00:52:09.446 A:middle
enough information to know
what it size should be.

00:52:10.646 --> 00:52:12.776 A:middle
So for situations like this
where you know you want

00:52:12.776 --> 00:52:16.396 A:middle
to use information at runtime to
get your intrinsic content size,

00:52:16.986 --> 00:52:19.086 A:middle
you can tell Interface
Builder, it's OK, you don't need

00:52:19.086 --> 00:52:21.996 A:middle
to warn me about an
ambiguous size, and you can do

00:52:21.996 --> 00:52:24.446 A:middle
that by giving in a placeholder
intrinsic content size.

00:52:24.446 --> 00:52:26.706 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on this
button and choose Placeholder.

00:52:27.866 --> 00:52:29.336 A:middle
And now, I've just
told Interface Builder

00:52:29.336 --> 00:52:31.936 A:middle
to use this size as my
intrinsic content size,

00:52:31.936 --> 00:52:33.966 A:middle
and it's OK if I don't have
width or height constraints.

00:52:34.316 --> 00:52:36.356 A:middle
And when I did that,
it's no longer ambiguous.

00:52:36.856 --> 00:52:41.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:52:41.686 --> 00:52:43.766 A:middle
All right, so you just saw
a bunch of different ways,

00:52:43.766 --> 00:52:44.906 A:middle
a bunch of different
tools we've added

00:52:44.906 --> 00:52:46.846 A:middle
to help you resolve
Auto Layout issues.

00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:49.886 A:middle
First, you can use
the canvas decorations

00:52:49.946 --> 00:52:52.566 A:middle
to see how your view is
misplaced or ambiguous

00:52:53.386 --> 00:52:56.366 A:middle
or you can get a quick look
at all the unresolved issues

00:52:56.366 --> 00:53:00.216 A:middle
in your document using the mini
navigator, issue navigator.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:56.366 --> 00:53:00.216 A:middle
in your document using the mini
navigator, issue navigator.

00:53:01.276 --> 00:53:03.196 A:middle
If you want to quickly
update the constraints

00:53:03.196 --> 00:53:05.076 A:middle
on your misplaced view
or add constraints

00:53:05.076 --> 00:53:09.086 A:middle
to an ambiguous view, you can
use the Canvas Resolving menu

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:10.066 A:middle
at the bottom of the canvas

00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:13.656 A:middle
or if you want some more
information about your issue,

00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:15.686 A:middle
you can always head over to the
Interface Builder outline view

00:53:15.686 --> 00:53:17.106 A:middle
to get more detailed help.

00:53:18.656 --> 00:53:21.146 A:middle
So, that wraps up
the new workflows

00:53:21.146 --> 00:53:22.286 A:middle
for Auto Layout in Xcode 5.

00:53:23.126 --> 00:53:24.466 A:middle
Before we finish, I just want

00:53:24.466 --> 00:53:27.736 A:middle
to add one quick note
on compatibility.

00:53:27.736 --> 00:53:30.656 A:middle
So all the features we discussed
today are fully compatible

00:53:30.656 --> 00:53:33.766 A:middle
with any previous OS version
that supports Auto Layout,

00:53:34.736 --> 00:53:37.226 A:middle
or we use these great features,
and you'd be using Xcode 5,

00:53:37.946 --> 00:53:40.736 A:middle
and your Interface Builder
document won't be compatible

00:53:40.736 --> 00:53:41.956 A:middle
with previous versions of Xcode.

00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:45.636 A:middle
If you really need your,
[inaudible] story board

00:53:45.636 --> 00:53:47.716 A:middle
to be backwards compatibility,
you can always downgrade it

00:53:47.716 --> 00:53:49.806 A:middle
in the File Inspector, but
then you won't have access

00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:50.506 A:middle
to these features.

00:53:51.016 --> 00:53:55.476 A:middle
And of course and along with
the new Auto Layout workflows

00:53:55.476 --> 00:53:56.796 A:middle
and of course support for iOS 7,

00:53:57.446 --> 00:53:59.466 A:middle
Xcode 5 brings along
a new readable

00:53:59.466 --> 00:54:01.056 A:middle
and diff-able XML
format for this.

and diff-able XML
format for this.

[ Applause ]

00:54:01.156 --> 00:54:09.396 A:middle
If you'd like more information,

00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:12.056 A:middle
you can contact the Dev
Tools Evangelist, Dave DeLong

00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:14.146 A:middle
or you can post it
on developer forums.

00:54:15.526 --> 00:54:18.366 A:middle
We'll be having auto
or-- we also have--

00:54:18.366 --> 00:54:20.746 A:middle
we also recommend you checkout
the Auto Layout related sessions

00:54:20.746 --> 00:54:23.606 A:middle
from last year's conference, or
the Interface Builder session

00:54:23.606 --> 00:54:24.366 A:middle
for this year's conference.

00:54:25.136 --> 00:54:26.266 A:middle
And with that, thank you.
