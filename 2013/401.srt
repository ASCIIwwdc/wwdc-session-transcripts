[ Silence ]

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:18.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Anders Bertelrud: Welcome

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:22.066 A:middle
to session 401, Xcode
Core Concepts.

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:24.776 A:middle
I'm Anders and later on in
this session I'll be joined

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:25.726 A:middle
by my colleague Rick.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:30.186 A:middle
So, this morning in Presidio

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:33.506 A:middle
in the previous Xcode session
we saw what's new in Xcode 5.

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.916 A:middle
And in this session I like
to talk a little bit more

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:39.366 A:middle
about the core concepts
behind Xcode, both those in 4

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
and also those that are
newly expressed in Xcode 5.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:45.356 A:middle
And the goal is to give
you better understanding

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:46.346 A:middle
of what you're seeing in the UI

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:49.236 A:middle
and to make you a lot more
efficient as you're using Xcode.

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:51.986 A:middle
So specifically we're
going to start talking

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:55.376 A:middle
about the user interface and
the various concepts behind

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.716 A:middle
that with the special
focus on navigation.

00:00:58.106 --> 00:00:59.246 A:middle
When you're working
with your code,

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
a lot of the times you're
going back and forth

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
a lot of the times you're
going back and forth

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
between various source
files or UI files.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.416 A:middle
I want to make that as efficient
as possible and Xcode has a lot

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:07.306 A:middle
of good features for that.

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:10.046 A:middle
We're going to talk
about working effectively

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:13.106 A:middle
with editors, with the single
editor as well as multiple ones.

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:15.936 A:middle
We're going to talk specifically
about some of the things

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:18.416 A:middle
in the source editor that you
can use to be more productive.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.936 A:middle
I'm going to talk a little bit
about documentation integration,

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.476 A:middle
and how to customize
Xcode's behaviors.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:27.116 A:middle
Xcode has fairly flexible
behavior system that you can use

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.326 A:middle
to really improve your workflow.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.676 A:middle
After that, my colleague Rick's
going to come up on stage

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.766 A:middle
and talk about the fundamental
concepts that underlie Xcode,

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:36.436 A:middle
the once you're manipulating
through the UI.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.916 A:middle
That includes workspaces,
projects, targets,

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:43.766 A:middle
schemes and run destinations.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.906 A:middle
So some of this will be
familiar from Xcode 4

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.916 A:middle
but there may be a lot of things
there you don't know about

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.736 A:middle
and some will be new in Xcode 5.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.866 A:middle
We'll start with the UI.

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:54.266 A:middle
This is the familiar
Xcode workspace window.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:56.846 A:middle
And so I won't go
into it in detail

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:58.926 A:middle
because you all have
seen it before.

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:02.126 A:middle
But briefly, to the left
here is the navigation area.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:02.126 A:middle
But briefly, to the left
here is the navigation area.

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:06.546 A:middle
All of that area are
consists of different panes

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:10.545 A:middle
that show you a different
view into your code.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:16.586 A:middle
I should say also on the right
there is the utility area

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:19.416 A:middle
consisting of the inspector
on the top and library

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.676 A:middle
at the bottom and in the middle
is where you do the editing,

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.616 A:middle
and of course you can
close any of these panes.

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:26.386 A:middle
So let's start by that
focusing and navigation.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:30.406 A:middle
So the navigator area here
on the left, the very top

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:33.056 A:middle
of that are the selectors
for choosing

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:34.396 A:middle
which navigator you want to see.

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:36.856 A:middle
We'll go into each of
these in a bit more detail.

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:40.246 A:middle
We have the project
navigator, the symbol navigator,

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.616 A:middle
find, issue navigator.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:46.526 A:middle
The new one in Xcode 5 is the
unit test testing navigator,

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:50.076 A:middle
debugging and related
is breakpoints and then

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:51.346 A:middle
of course the log navigator.

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:54.656 A:middle
So taking a closer look
at those, first of all,

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:57.546 A:middle
I want to show that at the
bottom of most of these,

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
we have a filter bar that's
down there at the bottom--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
we have a filter bar that's
down there at the bottom--

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:03.106 A:middle
it's different, slightly
different for each

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:05.586 A:middle
of the navigators but it fills
the same function for each.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:10.256 A:middle
There's usually a way to create
the new entry of the content

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.236 A:middle
that you're looking at,
whether that's a file

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:13.586 A:middle
or breakpoints or any of those.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.146 A:middle
There are state filters
that are specific

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:18.206 A:middle
to the particular
navigator you're looking at.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.926 A:middle
And then there's
usually, most of them,

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:24.066 A:middle
have a generic text filter,
where if you know the name

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:26.346 A:middle
or a substring of the name
of what you're looking for,

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:27.996 A:middle
you can just type it
in and quickly narrow

00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:29.626 A:middle
down on what you're looking for.

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:33.366 A:middle
So, looking at each
the navigators in turn,

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:37.126 A:middle
we'll see first here with
the project navigator,

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:40.346 A:middle
there is a recently
edited, first of all,

00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:42.876 A:middle
of course it shows you the
project contents, projects,

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.366 A:middle
files, those kinds of things.

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:48.386 A:middle
At the bottom there,
there is a recent filter

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.376 A:middle
and this could be very useful
if you have a very large project

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:54.386 A:middle
and you've been working
on a certain set of files,

00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:55.536 A:middle
you have a certain working set.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:59.746 A:middle
So those will show you the ones
you've been visiting recently.

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:03.376 A:middle
The modified filter will
focus just on those things

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:03.376 A:middle
The modified filter will
focus just on those things

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.406 A:middle
that you modified since the
last time you checked anything

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.636 A:middle
into source code or that
have interesting SCM state.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.576 A:middle
And of course there is the
filter field where you can,

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.486 A:middle
in this case, we type
in the string render

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:16.755 A:middle
and we see just the entries
that-- that contain that name.

00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:19.456 A:middle
So that's pretty simple.

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:21.716 A:middle
Now the symbol navigator,
it shows you all kinds

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:24.786 A:middle
of symbolic information that
we get from indexing your code.

00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:28.716 A:middle
So this includes of course
classes, methods, enumerations,

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:29.776 A:middle
all those kinds of things.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:33.436 A:middle
There are filters there to
let you focus just on your own

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:35.486 A:middle
or the ones that are
in the system as well.

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:40.226 A:middle
The find navigator is where
you do workspace wide searching

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:43.636 A:middle
of either regular plain text
strings or regular expressions.

00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:49.946 A:middle
And so-- one of the things
that you can do here is to go

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:54.696 A:middle
into replace modes, you could do
search or you could do replace.

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.946 A:middle
And as you saw yesterday we

00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:00.916 A:middle
in Xcode 5 we streamlined the
UI here to make it a lot easier

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:00.916 A:middle
in Xcode 5 we streamlined the
UI here to make it a lot easier

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.336 A:middle
to get at these various things.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:06.466 A:middle
You can actually delete search
results, as you go through them,

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.886 A:middle
and that doesn't delete them
from your code, it just takes it

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:10.516 A:middle
out of the list of the
ones you're operating on.

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:16.076 A:middle
There's also a scope field
and what that lets you do is

00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:18.296 A:middle
to narrow down the
search or replace

00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:21.076 A:middle
on just a particular
part of your workspace.

00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:23.996 A:middle
Now that could be either
a subtree or subfolder

00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:27.186 A:middle
or a project, or you could
define your own filters

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:28.526 A:middle
that define a set of files

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.846 A:middle
such as all header
files or all nib files.

00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:35.496 A:middle
The issue navigator
shows you issues

00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.306 A:middle
that Xcode has discovered
with your project.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.886 A:middle
So this could be,
of course, warnings

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:42.446 A:middle
and errors form the
compiler or linker,

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.956 A:middle
but also static analysis
results.

00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:47.206 A:middle
And also Xcode itself, you--

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:50.386 A:middle
before you build will check
for certain consistency issues,

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:53.246 A:middle
such as if you don't have
the right SDK installed

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:54.546 A:middle
that you'll need
for the project,

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:55.416 A:middle
you'll see that right away.

00:05:56.216 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
And sometimes, if Xcode detects
a modernization suggestion,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.216 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
And sometimes, if Xcode detects
a modernization suggestion,

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.496 A:middle
it will actually tell
you here as well.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.006 A:middle
So that's a good
place to check and try

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.276 A:middle
to keep this as empty
as possible.

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:08.786 A:middle
The test navigator
is new in Xcode 5

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:10.796 A:middle
and this shows your unit tests

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:14.276 A:middle
and that also let's you create
new ones from here and run them,

00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:19.316 A:middle
and there's a whole session
about that coming up and so,

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.996 A:middle
so I won't say much more about
that here, that's on Thursday.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:27.276 A:middle
The debug navigator is of course
where you see the current state

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:31.256 A:middle
of your program, that's where we
have the new gauges in Xcode 5

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:36.416 A:middle
and there's a whole session on
that as well, so I will skip

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.006 A:middle
over that one as well because
there's a lot more to talk

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:39.776 A:middle
about in this session.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.096 A:middle
That debugging session
is on Wednesday.

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:44.886 A:middle
The breakpoint navigator
is closely related

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:48.636 A:middle
to the debug navigator, and
unlike the debug navigator,

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.006 A:middle
this is one where you
can create content even

00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:52.096 A:middle
if your program is not running.

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:54.056 A:middle
So for example, you can
create new breakpoints,

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:56.946 A:middle
new symbolic breakpoints or
just breakpoints in your code.

00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:59.186 A:middle
One of the new things
in Xcode 5 is

00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:04.026 A:middle
that this pane shows you
the resolved breakpoints

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:04.026 A:middle
that this pane shows you
the resolved breakpoints

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:05.296 A:middle
of any symbolic ones you have.

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:06.896 A:middle
So you can enter
symbolic breakpoints

00:07:06.896 --> 00:07:10.366 A:middle
for a certain method name and
then you can see all the places

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:12.676 A:middle
that match that in the code and,

00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:14.206 A:middle
and click on them to
go directly there.

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:18.336 A:middle
And of course the
activity log navigator,

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:22.826 A:middle
that shows SCM activity, it
shows you build, warnings

00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:24.436 A:middle
and errors and those
kinds of things.

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:28.866 A:middle
And in Xcode 5 it also shows
you the diagnostics and logs

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:32.346 A:middle
that you get from your
Xcode service bots.

00:07:32.436 --> 00:07:34.886 A:middle
There's a whole session on that
called "Continuous Integration

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:37.366 A:middle
in Xcode 5" and that's going to
be this afternoon at Presidio.

00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:43.086 A:middle
So, because these are
very commonly used

00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:45.986 A:middle
and very useful different
entry points into your code,

00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:49.736 A:middle
they have very convenient
keyboard shortcuts.

00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:54.046 A:middle
So control simply 1 through
8 will put the cursor

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:57.376 A:middle
in the navigator, switch to
the right one, put the cursor

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.526 A:middle
in there so you can use the
arrow keys to go up and down

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.176 A:middle
and then quickly go
to the file you want.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.176 A:middle
and then quickly go
to the file you want.

00:08:02.176 --> 00:08:04.686 A:middle
So even if your hands are on
the keyboard, your text's--

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:06.186 A:middle
you're looking at your text,

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.776 A:middle
this is the-- the
way to do that.

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:09.506 A:middle
Let me just very
quickly go there.

00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:12.476 A:middle
So let's talk a little
bit about editors

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:14.156 A:middle
and working effectively
with editors.

00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:16.556 A:middle
We've seen now how to navigate
between the different content

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:18.416 A:middle
and get different
files into the editor.

00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:22.306 A:middle
So at the top of the editor,
on top of every editor,

00:08:22.306 --> 00:08:23.796 A:middle
there's a jump bar
as we call it,

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:25.156 A:middle
and it has various components.

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:27.726 A:middle
So, there's the-- the
related files menu,

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.206 A:middle
I'm sure you've used before
but I hopefully I can--

00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:32.916 A:middle
show some, some extra
tricks on how to use that.

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:37.346 A:middle
There's back and forth buttons,
each editor works a little bit

00:08:37.346 --> 00:08:39.336 A:middle
like web browser in the
sense that there's a history,

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:41.366 A:middle
you go back and forth
not only between files

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.756 A:middle
but also the locations
within the particular file.

00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:47.786 A:middle
The location of the file in
the workspace does two things.

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:51.456 A:middle
It-- it tells you what file
you're editing especially useful

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.186 A:middle
if you have multiple
files with the same name,

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.556 A:middle
but also it lets you access any

00:08:55.556 --> 00:08:57.786 A:middle
of the other files
reachable from your workspace.

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:02.366 A:middle
And on the-- right here is
the issue mini navigator.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:02.366 A:middle
And on the-- right here is
the issue mini navigator.

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:05.926 A:middle
If you have any issues at the
issue pane that are associated

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:08.846 A:middle
with files, you can use the
arrow keys to go back and forth

00:09:08.846 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
between them or pop that menu
and just cycle through the,

00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:15.406 A:middle
the issues and fix them.

00:09:15.606 --> 00:09:20.516 A:middle
So, the-- starting off from the
left here, we can hit control 1

00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:23.696 A:middle
or we go, we click
on the, the menu.

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.736 A:middle
We get to the related
files menu.

00:09:25.736 --> 00:09:29.226 A:middle
And when Xcode indexes
your project it knows a lot

00:09:29.226 --> 00:09:31.526 A:middle
about each file and how that
can be related to the other one,

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:33.186 A:middle
so obviously there
is a recent menu.

00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:36.326 A:middle
Counterparts include most
obviously if you're looking

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.956 A:middle
at the implementation you can
see the header, vice versa,

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:43.046 A:middle
superclasses, pretty
straightforward, categories,

00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:43.966 A:middle
and those kinds of things.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:49.306 A:middle
Now, there's also a convenient
way to get to any other file

00:09:49.306 --> 00:09:51.796 A:middle
that this file includes
or vice versa to get

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:53.416 A:middle
to any other includers
of this file.

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:55.096 A:middle
That's great for a header
when you're wondering

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.746 A:middle
which other files
include it and you want

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:57.886 A:middle
to go quickly between them.

00:09:59.296 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
And then of course,
new in Xcode 5 is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.296 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
And then of course,
new in Xcode 5 is

00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:05.246 A:middle
that you can get
to tests as well.

00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:09.416 A:middle
At the bottom there are
controls to get to preprocess

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.146 A:middle
and assembly language
outputs of your current file.

00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
And when you do that you get
a preview of the assembler

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:18.006 A:middle
and you can pick if
you have let's say code

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:21.666 A:middle
that compiles both for iOS
and for OS X, you can pick

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:24.326 A:middle
which CPU you want the
assembler output for.

00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.636 A:middle
The back and forth buttons
are pretty straightforward.

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:28.986 A:middle
I won't spend a lot
of time on those.

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.626 A:middle
But there are keyboard
equivalents for each

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:36.016 A:middle
of these and, and so that
will conveniently get you

00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:36.546 A:middle
up to the menu.

00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:42.386 A:middle
The menu that shows you the
entire workspace can be quite

00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:46.646 A:middle
big but it uses submenus to let
you navigate really to any file

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.236 A:middle
at all that you can
reach from the workspace,

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:49.366 A:middle
so that can be fairly
convenient.

00:10:51.146 --> 00:11:00.026 A:middle
And then finally, if you--
if you hit Control 5,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:51.146 --> 00:11:00.026 A:middle
And then finally, if you--
if you hit Control 5,

00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:03.576 A:middle
you get to the menu that
shows just the files.

00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:07.186 A:middle
Very often the other file you're
looking to go to is up here

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:11.536 A:middle
of the one that you're already
viewing and so control 5 put you

00:11:11.536 --> 00:11:13.586 A:middle
on that menu, you can use
the arrow keys and return key

00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:17.056 A:middle
to quickly go to any
one of those files.

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:23.406 A:middle
And control 6 pulls down to
Symbol menu which is, well,

00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:24.966 A:middle
shows you all the
classes and methods.

00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:27.216 A:middle
And one of the tricks
that actually works

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:28.886 A:middle
with all these menus
is type-aheads.

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:30.526 A:middle
You can just start typing
when you're looking at any

00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:32.496 A:middle
of these menus and it
will quickly filter

00:11:32.496 --> 00:11:35.836 A:middle
down to exactly what you're
looking for and that can be--

00:11:35.836 --> 00:11:38.106 A:middle
that actually works in all of
them and that can be a great way

00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:40.106 A:middle
to just very quickly get
to the menu you want.

00:11:41.226 --> 00:11:44.156 A:middle
So, we've looked a little
bit about the jump bar

00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:45.146 A:middle
at the top of editors.

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:48.626 A:middle
So let's talk about the
assistant editor, when you open

00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:52.736 A:middle
up Xcode by default, you get
just the single standard editor,

00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:55.186 A:middle
and whenever you choose
a new thing to look

00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:58.856 A:middle
at though navigation, then
the content is replaced.

00:11:58.856 --> 00:12:00.946 A:middle
Now, the assistant
editor is a secondary

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.856 --> 00:12:00.946 A:middle
Now, the assistant
editor is a secondary

00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:04.156 A:middle
or it can even be
tertiary that opens up

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.676 A:middle
and it will track the
contents of the primary editor.

00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:10.406 A:middle
And so this is excellent for
looking at auxiliary content.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.366 A:middle
And one of the things that you
might not know is that you can--

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.376 A:middle
you have several
options for how to lay

00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:16.846 A:middle
out the assistant editors.

00:12:16.846 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
They can stack from
top to bottom,

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:19.746 A:middle
or right to left, et cetera.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:24.766 A:middle
So with the Assistant
Editor, how do you invoke it?

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:27.216 A:middle
One of the ways you can
invoke that is most obviously

00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:32.506 A:middle
with the tool bar and you see
here the highlighted button

00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:35.676 A:middle
there, it gets you into standard
editor mode, just clicking

00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:37.286 A:middle
on the assistant
editor button put you

00:12:37.286 --> 00:12:38.346 A:middle
on assistant editor mode.

00:12:38.906 --> 00:12:41.956 A:middle
You can conveniently access
any kind of SCM information

00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:43.266 A:middle
about the current file as well.

00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:45.366 A:middle
And for each of this there's,

00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:48.566 A:middle
there's key equivalents you can
see in here, command Option,

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:49.746 A:middle
command Shift, et cetera.

00:12:50.256 --> 00:12:55.146 A:middle
There's a whole session on SCM
and Xcode and that's going to be

00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:57.846 A:middle
on Friday in Pacific Heights
and that will talk a lot more

00:12:57.846 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
about the functionality that you
get underneath that, that mode.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.846 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
about the functionality that you
get underneath that, that mode.

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:04.466 A:middle
Going back to the
Assistant Mode here,

00:13:04.706 --> 00:13:06.716 A:middle
regardless of how you invoke it.

00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:09.976 A:middle
What happens when you invoke
it is you get a second editor

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:12.916 A:middle
that tracks and by default it
will track whatever is most

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:16.226 A:middle
appropriate as a counterpart to
the file and the primary editor.

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:21.696 A:middle
Xcode knows things like
header files being associated

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:22.946 A:middle
with implementation files.

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.336 A:middle
It also knows for example that
a vertex shader is associated

00:13:25.336 --> 00:13:26.166 A:middle
with a fragment shader.

00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:27.996 A:middle
So when you choose
counterparts here,

00:13:28.196 --> 00:13:32.036 A:middle
it will go between the
various, various files

00:13:32.036 --> 00:13:34.996 A:middle
and when you switch a file,
the assistant editor tracks.

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:37.286 A:middle
This is particularly useful

00:13:37.286 --> 00:13:39.146 A:middle
when you have contents
such as a nib file.

00:13:39.406 --> 00:13:42.336 A:middle
So if you're looking, for
example, at a view controller,

00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:46.216 A:middle
you can see that
the corresponding UI

00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:48.226 A:middle
in the right hand side there.

00:13:48.226 --> 00:13:50.736 A:middle
And then what happens
when you're looking

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:53.056 A:middle
in the assistant editor
is you may very well want

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:56.426 A:middle
to actually focus on that for
a bit so you can choose the--

00:13:56.426 --> 00:13:58.686 A:middle
to make that the
primary content.

00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:00.606 A:middle
And what happens in that case is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:00.606 A:middle
And what happens in that case is

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:04.386 A:middle
that the assistant content
becomes the primary content,

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:07.186 A:middle
and now the assistant
editor is available

00:14:07.186 --> 00:14:09.026 A:middle
to show you related
content to that.

00:14:09.146 --> 00:14:11.546 A:middle
So that way you can sort
of navigate back and forth

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:14.356 A:middle
in your graph of connectedness
between your files.

00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:17.736 A:middle
In this case, as you
click in the nib file,

00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:21.006 A:middle
you can see the source
files that are related

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.696 A:middle
to the various doc-- various
objects in your nib file.

00:14:24.136 --> 00:14:27.846 A:middle
And you'll notice that the
Assistant menu now has changed

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:31.786 A:middle
to show you entries that are
relevant to the nib file.

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:34.966 A:middle
So you can very easily,
for example, go through all

00:14:34.966 --> 00:14:36.216 A:middle
of the different
actions that are,

00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:37.776 A:middle
that are presented
in this nib file.

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:41.306 A:middle
In activating the assistant
editor, how do you do that?

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:43.976 A:middle
Well one is of course, you can
use the button in the tool bar,

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:49.616 A:middle
but there's a very useful
thing throughout Xcode,

00:14:50.076 --> 00:14:53.746 A:middle
and that is the Option key where
when you use the Option key,

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:56.456 A:middle
and combine that with
other modes of navigation,

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:59.636 A:middle
instead of putting the source
file into the primary editor,

00:14:59.636 --> 00:15:02.796 A:middle
it'll open up an assistant,
and this could be very useful.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.636 --> 00:15:02.796 A:middle
it'll open up an assistant,
and this could be very useful.

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:04.576 A:middle
It exists in a variety
of places.

00:15:04.576 --> 00:15:08.736 A:middle
So for example, command click
on a symbol will navigate

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:11.186 A:middle
to the source of that symbol
to-- to where it's defined.

00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:16.216 A:middle
If you also hold down the Option
key, it will do the same thing

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.476 A:middle
but open up an assistant editor.

00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:20.306 A:middle
And you can do the same thing
when you click on a File

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.966 A:middle
and then any of the navigators,
hold on the Option key

00:15:23.126 --> 00:15:25.146 A:middle
and it will instead put that
content in the assistant.

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:28.366 A:middle
And that can be very useful
when you're navigating

00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:31.366 A:middle
and you don't actually want to
focus on what it is that's--

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:32.826 A:middle
that you're seeing, you
just want to keep it

00:15:32.826 --> 00:15:35.156 A:middle
up as auxiliary content
to maybe for reference.

00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:38.786 A:middle
And in addition to that, if
you want even more power,

00:15:39.256 --> 00:15:42.336 A:middle
if you hold down the Shift
key in addition you can get

00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:43.496 A:middle
to the navigation chooser.

00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:50.636 A:middle
You can also get to it from
the menu, the Open in menu.

00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:55.446 A:middle
But again, Command,
Option, Shift will bring

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:56.576 A:middle
up the navigation chooser.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
This is a HUD that lets you
use arrow keys and return key

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
This is a HUD that lets you
use arrow keys and return key

00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:04.106 A:middle
to really do anything you want.

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.106 A:middle
You can put the content
in a new tab,

00:16:07.326 --> 00:16:09.246 A:middle
you could add a new
assistant editor

00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:11.736 A:middle
or you can even create
a new tab,

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:14.766 A:middle
it will put in an existing tab
or put content in a new window.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.986 A:middle
This is very customizable
and the user,

00:16:18.986 --> 00:16:21.246 A:middle
perhaps you can set exactly
what happens when you hold

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:23.136 A:middle
on the option key, when you
double click, et cetera.

00:16:23.256 --> 00:16:25.706 A:middle
So if you haven't customized
this you may want to take a look

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:27.016 A:middle
at that and see if you--

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:30.716 A:middle
find a better workflow for
you with these options.

00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:35.856 A:middle
All right, so another way
to navigate is open quickly,

00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:37.686 A:middle
and I'm sure many
of you use this.

00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:40.806 A:middle
Command, Shift, O,
brings up open quickly,

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:45.686 A:middle
and here you simply type
the name or a part of a file

00:16:46.036 --> 00:16:50.336 A:middle
or a symbol and Xcode
narrows down the list.

00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:51.906 A:middle
And as you notice, you
actually don't have

00:16:51.906 --> 00:16:53.506 A:middle
to type the contiguous range.

00:16:53.606 --> 00:16:56.586 A:middle
Very often if you just remember
the first parts of various,

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:58.456 A:middle
of the subwords,
you could type that.

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:01.706 A:middle
And very quickly get to
where you want to go.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:01.706 A:middle
And very quickly get to
where you want to go.

00:17:02.186 --> 00:17:04.636 A:middle
And also the Option
key works here too,

00:17:04.886 --> 00:17:06.185 A:middle
so if you just hit return now

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:09.616 A:middle
or just select this then
you'll be replacing the content

00:17:09.616 --> 00:17:10.546 A:middle
of your primary editor.

00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:12.576 A:middle
If you hold down the
Option key as well,

00:17:12.796 --> 00:17:13.986 A:middle
it'll open up assistant editor.

00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.626 A:middle
So let me show you few things
about the source editor.

00:17:16.846 --> 00:17:19.266 A:middle
So that's couple things
about the assistant editor

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:21.396 A:middle
and the key takeaway
there is the,

00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:23.705 A:middle
the power of the Option key,
it can really, really help you

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:24.396 A:middle
with your workflow there.

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:28.886 A:middle
With the source editor,
there are couple of things--

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
there a lot of features, but
a couple of things I want

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:31.636 A:middle
to call out in particular.

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:35.306 A:middle
It's very common to want to
rename all the local variables,

00:17:35.306 --> 00:17:37.406 A:middle
a-- a local variable,
all the occurrences

00:17:37.406 --> 00:17:40.136 A:middle
of a local variable to,
to have a single name.

00:17:40.136 --> 00:17:43.936 A:middle
So, you can do that by
editing each occurrence of it,

00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:47.256 A:middle
but a better way is to
do Edit All in Scope

00:17:47.456 --> 00:17:48.876 A:middle
and there's a menu item for that

00:17:48.926 --> 00:17:50.336 A:middle
but there's also
command, Control E.

00:17:51.216 --> 00:17:55.386 A:middle
And when you do that, what
Xcode does is to take what's

00:17:55.386 --> 00:17:58.926 A:middle
under this-- the cursor, and
there's actually a submenu

00:17:58.926 --> 00:18:00.506 A:middle
that shows up underneath
an arrow there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.926 --> 00:18:00.506 A:middle
that shows up underneath
an arrow there.

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.606 A:middle
You can-- so there's
variety of ways to invoke it.

00:18:02.856 --> 00:18:04.796 A:middle
And then as you just type,

00:18:05.096 --> 00:18:08.606 A:middle
Xcode will replace all the
locations of that same symbol.

00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:11.886 A:middle
And it's not purely a
textual replacement.

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:14.686 A:middle
It uses the index and it
knows that two variables

00:18:14.686 --> 00:18:16.386 A:middle
with the same name
are actually different

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:17.786 A:middle
if they're in different scopes.

00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:19.156 A:middle
So that-- that can
be a really great way

00:18:19.156 --> 00:18:22.516 A:middle
to rename a variable to,
to have a better name

00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:24.526 A:middle
if you picked the wrong
one the first time around.

00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:29.516 A:middle
Another very useful
feature is Code Snippets.

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:34.176 A:middle
So, very often when you're
coding, you come to a point

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:36.596 A:middle
where you say, "Well
there's a sort of,

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.356 A:middle
the sort of pattern
here of function call

00:18:39.356 --> 00:18:41.126 A:middle
or a loop that I want to use."

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:44.976 A:middle
And Xcode has a fairly large
library built in Code Snippets

00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:47.456 A:middle
for common idioms into
various frameworks.

00:18:48.646 --> 00:18:51.446 A:middle
One way to instantiate it
is to just drag and drop.

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:54.816 A:middle
And then what you get is you get
tokens for where you're going

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:56.026 A:middle
to fill in your own content.

00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:57.386 A:middle
And you can just fill that in

00:18:57.866 --> 00:19:01.316 A:middle
and then just have your
own-- your own code there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.866 --> 00:19:01.316 A:middle
and then just have your
own-- your own code there.

00:19:02.296 --> 00:19:06.366 A:middle
But very often, you will have
your own code where you want

00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:07.766 A:middle
to create your own
shortcuts for it.

00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:11.026 A:middle
So you can also create custom
Code Snippets, and to do that,

00:19:11.176 --> 00:19:15.926 A:middle
you just select a bunch of
code and then you drag it over

00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:18.906 A:middle
and drop, and you
see that it shows

00:19:18.906 --> 00:19:20.316 A:middle
up right there on
the-- on the side.

00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:24.066 A:middle
A popover comes up and
it will let you edit any

00:19:24.066 --> 00:19:24.956 A:middle
of the content in here.

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:29.446 A:middle
So there are menus to let
you choose the platform

00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:32.036 A:middle
and the scope and the language,
that's pretty straightforward.

00:19:32.726 --> 00:19:35.966 A:middle
You edit the contents of it and
I want to call out one thing

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:40.626 A:middle
in particular, when you edit the
contents, you can use the syntax

00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:44.326 A:middle
that uses angle brackets and
hash marks to surround parts

00:19:44.326 --> 00:19:46.596 A:middle
of your text that
you want to tokenize.

00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:50.896 A:middle
So those then become tokens when
you instantiate the Code Snippet

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:53.056 A:middle
that can be easily replaced.

00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:58.906 A:middle
That turns into a token, and
then you can also crucially,

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:02.446 A:middle
you can set a code completion
default because as fun as it is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:02.446 A:middle
you can set a code completion
default because as fun as it is

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:04.346 A:middle
to drag code snippets,
you probably don't want

00:20:04.346 --> 00:20:06.856 A:middle
to keep the utility area open,
and certainly you don't want

00:20:06.856 --> 00:20:08.106 A:middle
to reach for the mouse in order

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:09.756 A:middle
to do instantiate
a code snippet.

00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:13.966 A:middle
So, by associating a substring
here, now it becomes avail--

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:15.476 A:middle
and I'm hitting OK, I'm done.

00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:18.946 A:middle
Then it becomes available when
you go down and put your cursor

00:20:18.946 --> 00:20:22.646 A:middle
in the code, and you
can instantiate it.

00:20:23.236 --> 00:20:24.496 A:middle
And when you start typing,

00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:27.546 A:middle
code completion will
include that code snippet.

00:20:27.546 --> 00:20:30.266 A:middle
And then when you
instantiate it, it shows up

00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:31.226 A:middle
and you can just replace it.

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:37.106 A:middle
So, with that I'd like to invite
my colleague Rick on stage

00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:38.176 A:middle
to show you some
of this in action.

00:20:39.026 --> 00:20:39.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Rick Ballard:
OK, thanks Anders.

00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:43.496 A:middle
So, right now I'm going to
take you through a quick demo

00:20:43.816 --> 00:20:46.146 A:middle
of using some of the features
that Anders just talked

00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:47.986 A:middle
about to work efficiently
in Xcode.

00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:51.986 A:middle
All right, so, I've
got my project here

00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:54.606 A:middle
and I have a problem
I want to investigate.

00:20:54.606 --> 00:20:55.976 A:middle
So, first of all
I want to go look

00:20:55.976 --> 00:20:57.466 A:middle
at the method where
the problem is.

00:20:57.466 --> 00:21:02.826 A:middle
So, as Anders told you, you
can just use Command, Shift,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.466 --> 00:21:02.826 A:middle
So, as Anders told you, you
can just use Command, Shift,

00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:07.006 A:middle
and O to bring up Open Quickly
and start typing the name

00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:10.656 A:middle
of any symbol in your workspace
and we'll find it via the index.

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:13.946 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm going to
start typing part of shape class

00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:16.516 A:middle
and it found my method,
register shape class with tag,

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:20.126 A:middle
and I just hit Return
and here's the method

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.166 A:middle
that I want to take a look at.

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:25.126 A:middle
So, this method is dispatching
something to a concurrent queue.

00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:28.186 A:middle
And the problem I have is
that one of the callers

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:30.596 A:middle
of this method is passing nil
for one of the parameters.

00:21:30.596 --> 00:21:31.966 A:middle
So, this is assert is firing.

00:21:32.476 --> 00:21:34.856 A:middle
Now normally I'd just look
at the backtrace of my assert

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:36.916 A:middle
to see who called
this the wrong way.

00:21:37.186 --> 00:21:39.336 A:middle
But since this is dispatched
to a concurrent queue,

00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:41.446 A:middle
that backtrace just
shows dispatch machinery

00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:44.556 A:middle
and I can't see who's calling
my method with a bad parameter.

00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:46.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to use the
power of the assistant editor

00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:49.236 A:middle
and our callers functionality
to track

00:21:49.276 --> 00:21:51.156 A:middle
down who might be
causing this here.

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:54.296 A:middle
So, first of all I'm
going to go ahead

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:58.916 A:middle
and select the assistant editor
in upper right-hand corner

00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:03.716 A:middle
and I can go and see a bunch
of different related content

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:03.716 A:middle
and I can go and see a bunch
of different related content

00:22:03.716 --> 00:22:04.796 A:middle
in the assistant editor.

00:22:05.106 --> 00:22:07.276 A:middle
In this case I'm going to
go take a look at callers,

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:11.116 A:middle
and here Xcode through its
index has found everything

00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
in this workspace that
calls this method,

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.546 A:middle
there are three callers.

00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:17.286 A:middle
So, now I can easily
just select one of them

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:21.136 A:middle
and here I can see this method
is definitely not passing nil

00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:22.166 A:middle
for that parameter.

00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.486 A:middle
So, this is not the problem.

00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:25.866 A:middle
So to go to the next
one, I'm actually going

00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:27.106 A:middle
to use a keyboard shortcut now.

00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:31.016 A:middle
If I use control 4 it will
pop-up the assistant menu again.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.756 A:middle
And I can just use
the Arrow keys

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:34.576 A:middle
and select the next caller here,

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:38.366 A:middle
and I see this one also is not
passing nil for that parameter.

00:22:38.786 --> 00:22:40.846 A:middle
So, I'm going to do
that one more time,

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:44.776 A:middle
I'll select the last
caller and this one is--

00:22:44.776 --> 00:22:46.026 A:middle
has forgotten to pass a tag.

00:22:46.026 --> 00:22:47.076 A:middle
So, there's my problem.

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:49.966 A:middle
So, I can just say
fill in this--

00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:53.066 A:middle
fill in this tag and
I fix that problem.

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.356 A:middle
OK, I'm going to go back
to my standard editor

00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:57.436 A:middle
so you can see well here.

00:22:57.866 --> 00:22:59.076 A:middle
And the next problem I want

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:02.956 A:middle
to solve is I have this property
isLoaded here and I maybe want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:02.956 A:middle
to solve is I have this property
isLoaded here and I maybe want

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.616 A:middle
to give that a bit more
of a descriptive name.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:07.336 A:middle
That property reflects
whether my cache is loaded.

00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:09.906 A:middle
So, I think I actually want
to call it, isCacheLoaded.

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:13.066 A:middle
So to rename a method,
normally I could use--

00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:15.986 A:middle
to use Xcode's refactoring
feature to rename a method

00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:18.306 A:middle
and it would rename that method
and all callers of that method.

00:23:18.886 --> 00:23:22.126 A:middle
But in this case, this property
is, key-value observed by some

00:23:22.126 --> 00:23:24.366 A:middle
of the callers and
so this method name

00:23:24.366 --> 00:23:26.846 A:middle
or this property name just
shows up in string values

00:23:27.036 --> 00:23:28.106 A:middle
to key-value observing

00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:30.106 A:middle
so the rename refactoring
isn't sufficient.

00:23:30.106 --> 00:23:33.246 A:middle
So, for this case, I'm actually
going to use a textual find

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:35.176 A:middle
and replace in order
to rename this method.

00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:38.146 A:middle
So first of all I'm going
to go to the find navigator,

00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:40.426 A:middle
command 3 will bring
that up easily.

00:23:41.216 --> 00:23:42.906 A:middle
And I'm going to
select the word "Loaded"

00:23:42.906 --> 00:23:44.166 A:middle
that I'm going to replace here.

00:23:44.486 --> 00:23:46.926 A:middle
Command E will put that
in the find pasteboard.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.956 A:middle
So, you see it's showing up here
in the upper left-hand corner.

00:23:50.046 --> 00:23:53.906 A:middle
And if I hit Return, I can find
all instances of the word loaded

00:23:53.906 --> 00:23:56.806 A:middle
in source code in my
workspace, just like that.

00:23:57.726 --> 00:23:59.546 A:middle
So, I actually want to
do a replacement here.

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.926 A:middle
So, I'm going to choose
replace then I want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.926 A:middle
So, I'm going to choose
replace then I want

00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:04.696 A:middle
to replace the word
Loaded with cacheLoaded.

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:07.056 A:middle
So, if I hit replace on
that it will go ahead

00:24:07.056 --> 00:24:08.066 A:middle
and make this change.

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:10.116 A:middle
But before I do that,
I ought to make sure

00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:11.286 A:middle
that all these instances

00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:14.596 A:middle
of the word loaded are actually
references to my property name

00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:15.886 A:middle
and not that word showing

00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:17.556 A:middle
up somewhere else
in my source code.

00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:20.846 A:middle
So, if I start flipping through
these, I see, here's a case

00:24:20.846 --> 00:24:22.866 A:middle
where that property is
being key-value observed.

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:25.176 A:middle
Here-- here is that
key path again.

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:28.296 A:middle
Actually, almost of these are
my property, but there's one

00:24:28.296 --> 00:24:31.286 A:middle
that isn't and that's the
underlying shape cache

00:24:31.396 --> 00:24:32.446 A:middle
isLoaded property.

00:24:32.446 --> 00:24:33.446 A:middle
I'm not renaming that.

00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:36.066 A:middle
So, I don't want my find and
replace to touch that one.

00:24:36.486 --> 00:24:38.766 A:middle
So as Anders said, you can
actually delete find results

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.036 A:middle
out of the find navigator.

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:42.576 A:middle
So, with this selected, if
I just press the Delete key,

00:24:42.766 --> 00:24:44.066 A:middle
it deleted that find result.

00:24:44.296 --> 00:24:47.036 A:middle
And now when I do my batch
replace, it's not going

00:24:47.036 --> 00:24:48.326 A:middle
to touch that one case.

00:24:48.326 --> 00:24:50.176 A:middle
So, I can just replace
the instances

00:24:50.176 --> 00:24:51.326 A:middle
of the string that I want to.

00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:53.906 A:middle
So, I'm going to say
replace all, I'm not going

00:24:53.906 --> 00:24:55.166 A:middle
to use snapshots at the moment.

00:24:55.386 --> 00:24:56.296 A:middle
And now, it's gone ahead

00:24:56.296 --> 00:24:58.636 A:middle
and renamed our property
to isCacheLoaded.

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
All right, there's one more
thing I want to show you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
All right, there's one more
thing I want to show you.

00:25:01.286 --> 00:25:04.486 A:middle
I have a method that I want to
validate that some other methods

00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:06.876 A:middle
that I call are doing the
right with change management.

00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:08.886 A:middle
So, first of all
I'm going to go back

00:25:08.886 --> 00:25:10.936 A:middle
to the project navigator
to find this file.

00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:12.326 A:middle
I could use open quickly
again, but I'm going

00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
to show you a different way.

00:25:13.736 --> 00:25:17.986 A:middle
Down in the lower left, if I
select the recent files filter,

00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:20.666 A:middle
you'll see just the files that
I've been editing recently.

00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:23.056 A:middle
And this provides a
really nice working set.

00:25:23.056 --> 00:25:24.196 A:middle
If I'm going back and forth

00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:26.016 A:middle
between a few files
I edit frequently,

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:27.806 A:middle
I can just see them all here

00:25:27.806 --> 00:25:29.546 A:middle
and have them all
immediately accessible.

00:25:29.756 --> 00:25:33.156 A:middle
So, in this case the file I
want to edit is SKTDocument.

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.716 A:middle
And now, I need to find
the method I'm looking

00:25:35.716 --> 00:25:39.426 A:middle
for so I'm going to use control
6 to bring up the symbol pop-up.

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:42.176 A:middle
And with type-ahead, I can
just start typing what I'm

00:25:42.176 --> 00:25:42.826 A:middle
looking for.

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:45.306 A:middle
So, I'm going to
say readFromData.

00:25:45.306 --> 00:25:48.496 A:middle
Here it is, there's the
method I want, I select that,

00:25:48.496 --> 00:25:51.016 A:middle
and here's the method I
want to take a look at.

00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:55.206 A:middle
So, down here this method
is removing some graphics

00:25:55.446 --> 00:25:57.126 A:middle
and then inserting
some graphics,

00:25:57.346 --> 00:25:58.556 A:middle
and I want to make
sure that both

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.126 A:middle
of these are doing
the right thing.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.126 A:middle
of these are doing
the right thing.

00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:03.856 A:middle
So, if I command click on this
symbol it would jump right

00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:05.636 A:middle
to that method and I
could see what it's doing.

00:26:05.636 --> 00:26:07.976 A:middle
But in this case, I actually
want to see my code side

00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:10.596 A:middle
by side, so I can see that
it's all coordinating properly,

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:12.906 A:middle
so to use that I'm going to
use the assistant editor.

00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:16.526 A:middle
So as Anders said any
navigation that you can do

00:26:16.526 --> 00:26:18.946 A:middle
if you add the option key,
it will send that navigation

00:26:18.946 --> 00:26:19.966 A:middle
to the assistant editor.

00:26:20.126 --> 00:26:22.066 A:middle
So, instead of command
clicking on this,

00:26:22.356 --> 00:26:24.356 A:middle
I'm going to command
option click on it

00:26:24.356 --> 00:26:27.166 A:middle
and that will automatically
open up the assistant editor

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:28.926 A:middle
and you can see here's
the method

00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:30.166 A:middle
that I want to take a look at.

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:31.306 A:middle
So, that's great.

00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:33.996 A:middle
I also want to look at
insertGraphics at the same time.

00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:35.586 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to open

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:38.296 A:middle
up another assistant
editor to do that.

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:41.706 A:middle
So, Anders mentioned that
Option, Shift, Navigation brings

00:26:41.706 --> 00:26:43.606 A:middle
up the navigation
chooser and let you choose

00:26:43.606 --> 00:26:44.976 A:middle
where your concept will go.

00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:49.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to Command, Option
Shift, click on this method.

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:53.766 A:middle
There's my navigation chooser,
I can just go down and tell it

00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:56.816 A:middle
that I want to open a new
assistant editor, hit Return,

00:26:57.046 --> 00:26:59.236 A:middle
and here's this method
opening in a new--

00:26:59.236 --> 00:27:00.816 A:middle
you open in a new
assistant editor.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.236 --> 00:27:00.816 A:middle
you open in a new
assistant editor.

00:27:01.276 --> 00:27:05.256 A:middle
So, I can go down here and
see that my remove method,

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.846 A:middle
before it does the remove,
it stops observing graphics.

00:27:08.206 --> 00:27:10.246 A:middle
My insert method, after
it does the insert,

00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.956 A:middle
it starts observing graphics.

00:27:12.186 --> 00:27:13.966 A:middle
So, this looks like it's
all behaving correctly

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.126 A:middle
and works the way I want.

00:27:15.126 --> 00:27:17.366 A:middle
So, that's just a quick example

00:27:17.366 --> 00:27:19.516 A:middle
of how you can use
Xcode's navigation features

00:27:19.516 --> 00:27:20.536 A:middle
and our assistant editor

00:27:20.826 --> 00:27:23.116 A:middle
to build really efficient
nice workflows.

00:27:23.646 --> 00:27:25.026 A:middle
Let's turn it back
over to Anders.

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:26.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Anders Bertelrud: So,
let's talk a little bit

00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:28.226 A:middle
about documentation integration.

00:27:28.226 --> 00:27:30.646 A:middle
Xcode 4 had good
documentation integration,

00:27:30.646 --> 00:27:32.246 A:middle
and in Xcode 5 it's even better.

00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:35.586 A:middle
One of the ways, of course,
when you want to look

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:38.146 A:middle
at documentation is you're
looking at your code,

00:27:38.146 --> 00:27:39.426 A:middle
you have your hands
on the keyboard,

00:27:39.766 --> 00:27:41.856 A:middle
and you may want information
about a certain method.

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:46.296 A:middle
So, in Xcode, we
provide documentation

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:49.566 A:middle
with the command completion.

00:27:49.566 --> 00:27:52.126 A:middle
So, when you go to
complete code,

00:27:52.256 --> 00:27:53.956 A:middle
you can now get information

00:27:53.956 --> 00:27:55.936 A:middle
about the item under
your selection.

00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
If you have more than one
as you arrow up and down,

00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.476 A:middle
you get a short summary.

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:00.896 A:middle
This is great if you
don't know exactly

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:00.896 A:middle
This is great if you
don't know exactly

00:28:00.896 --> 00:28:04.086 A:middle
which method you're using,
that you want to use,

00:28:04.206 --> 00:28:06.436 A:middle
then you can get
a summary of it.

00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:10.426 A:middle
Another thing you can
do is to option click

00:28:11.096 --> 00:28:13.636 A:middle
and that will get you,
instead of command click goes

00:28:13.636 --> 00:28:16.946 A:middle
to the definition, option click
will get your documentation

00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:18.076 A:middle
about the symbol under there.

00:28:18.076 --> 00:28:20.456 A:middle
And as you can see, we
have complete documentation

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:24.746 A:middle
about the symbol without even
having to open up a utility area

00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:25.656 A:middle
or documentation area.

00:28:26.276 --> 00:28:28.506 A:middle
That's great when you just want
to know some more information

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.756 A:middle
about a particular method
that you see being used,

00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:32.716 A:middle
method or function or
enumeration, et cetera.

00:28:33.256 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
Sometimes though
you want to look

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:39.836 A:middle
at documentation a little
bit more permanently

00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:42.956 A:middle
or less transiently, so what
you can do there is to open

00:28:42.956 --> 00:28:47.526 A:middle
up the right side of the utility
area there, and then keep

00:28:47.526 --> 00:28:49.896 A:middle
that open, and as you
move the cursor around,

00:28:50.436 --> 00:28:52.256 A:middle
the quick help will
show you the information

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:54.166 A:middle
about whatever is
currently under your cursor.

00:28:54.286 --> 00:28:56.166 A:middle
So as you use arrow
keys up and down

00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:57.806 A:middle
for example the content
there will change.

00:28:57.996 --> 00:28:59.516 A:middle
So, that's all great.

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:01.876 A:middle
That's for the built-in
documentation for iOS,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:01.876 A:middle
That's for the built-in
documentation for iOS,

00:29:01.876 --> 00:29:03.956 A:middle
for OS X, SDKs, etceteras.

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:05.546 A:middle
So, what about your own code?

00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:07.456 A:middle
Well, this is what you see

00:29:07.456 --> 00:29:10.516 A:middle
if you haven't told Xcode
anything else, all it knows is

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:13.046 A:middle
where you declare it which would
be in a header file usually.

00:29:13.656 --> 00:29:15.886 A:middle
But, as you may have seen
in the previous sessions,

00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:17.316 A:middle
in Xcode 5, you can do better.

00:29:17.916 --> 00:29:20.476 A:middle
So, this is how your
declaration looks

00:29:20.476 --> 00:29:23.826 A:middle
without any other adornment
and that's the help you get.

00:29:23.876 --> 00:29:25.616 A:middle
You sort of get what
you put into it.

00:29:26.436 --> 00:29:29.776 A:middle
If you put some comments
in, for regular comments,

00:29:29.876 --> 00:29:32.126 A:middle
you can put some special
annotations in there,

00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:36.736 A:middle
Xcode will parse that, in this
case we're using doxygen type

00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:41.696 A:middle
tags there, and then Xcode
can actually show a pop-up

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:43.176 A:middle
that will give you a
lot more information.

00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:45.166 A:middle
The same amount of
information that you get

00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:47.106 A:middle
for the built-in SDKs.

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:52.816 A:middle
So, in this case for example,
you see how the various parts

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:56.766 A:middle
of your comment translate to
the various parts of the pop-up.

00:29:56.766 --> 00:29:57.916 A:middle
And you can get more information

00:29:57.916 --> 00:30:01.366 A:middle
about the syntax,
at doxygen.org.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.916 --> 00:30:01.366 A:middle
about the syntax,
at doxygen.org.

00:30:02.276 --> 00:30:05.096 A:middle
So, now if you go back
to our source code,

00:30:05.406 --> 00:30:06.896 A:middle
when we try to use
code completion

00:30:06.896 --> 00:30:08.026 A:middle
on our own method instead

00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:10.506 A:middle
of just the header we
get full documentation

00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:13.246 A:middle
and of course we get the same
thing with the option click

00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:16.416 A:middle
for the pop-over, and we get
the same thing in the quick help

00:30:16.926 --> 00:30:17.886 A:middle
on the right side of the screen.

00:30:18.996 --> 00:30:21.116 A:middle
So, that way, you can
really make your own code

00:30:21.116 --> 00:30:24.806 A:middle
for your own sake and the
sake of your teammates be

00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:26.726 A:middle
as well documented
as Apple's APIs are.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.516 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit more
about the documentation window.

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:32.506 A:middle
You've seen this one
before I think also

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:33.726 A:middle
in the Intro to Xcode 5.

00:30:34.216 --> 00:30:37.376 A:middle
In Xcode 5, we've pulled
the documentation viewer

00:30:37.376 --> 00:30:40.946 A:middle
out of the organizer and put
it into its own window which--

00:30:40.946 --> 00:30:43.616 A:middle
and along with the new great
multi windows full-screen

00:30:43.616 --> 00:30:46.376 A:middle
support can be a great
way to put your doc

00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.236 A:middle
on one window, et cetera.

00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:53.716 A:middle
The documentation viewer now
let's you look at the content

00:30:53.716 --> 00:30:57.326 A:middle
and also the Table of
Contents on the right

00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:59.876 A:middle
for whatever document
you're looking at.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.966 --> 00:31:05.296 A:middle
And also whenever you see
anything that you want

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:06.876 A:middle
to highlight that's
particularly relevant

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:09.856 A:middle
to what you were looking at
or what you need to work on,

00:31:10.226 --> 00:31:14.456 A:middle
you just click on the Bookmark
icon and then that entry shows

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:16.436 A:middle
up in the bookmark
pane on the left

00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:18.386 A:middle
where you can very
quickly access any part

00:31:18.386 --> 00:31:20.166 A:middle
of the documentation
whether it's a method

00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:22.296 A:middle
or conceptual documentation
or anything like that.

00:31:22.896 --> 00:31:26.226 A:middle
And of course, you can
close both of those sidebars

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:29.556 A:middle
to see the full documentation
experience when you really want

00:31:29.556 --> 00:31:30.686 A:middle
to read a particular document.

00:31:32.036 --> 00:31:35.506 A:middle
Finally, I want to talk a
little about and this is--

00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:37.436 A:middle
finally you have
UI part of this.

00:31:37.436 --> 00:31:40.696 A:middle
I want to talk about how you
can customize Xcode's behaviors

00:31:40.796 --> 00:31:42.306 A:middle
to increase your efficiency.

00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:46.146 A:middle
So Xcode has a lot of
filters-- features built in,

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:49.156 A:middle
and there are also
a lot of triggers

00:31:49.156 --> 00:31:51.646 A:middle
that you can associate
custom behavior with.

00:31:51.766 --> 00:31:54.296 A:middle
So on the left side here,
this is in the PrefPane,

00:31:54.296 --> 00:31:55.876 A:middle
and you may have seen
this before, you may not.

00:31:56.236 --> 00:32:00.396 A:middle
In the PrefPane, there are
a bunch of built-in triggers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.236 --> 00:32:00.396 A:middle
In the PrefPane, there are
a bunch of built-in triggers

00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:03.086 A:middle
of various kinds when your
program hits a breakpoint,

00:32:03.146 --> 00:32:07.006 A:middle
when your program crashes, when
you check something into SCM,

00:32:07.066 --> 00:32:09.446 A:middle
you can associate those with
the actions on the right.

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:13.096 A:middle
And so there are
several built-in actions.

00:32:13.646 --> 00:32:15.886 A:middle
One of the ones I want to point
out which you might not be aware

00:32:15.886 --> 00:32:19.346 A:middle
of is one that works in
conjunction with tabs.

00:32:19.346 --> 00:32:21.516 A:middle
I didn't talk a lot
about the tabs,

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.896 A:middle
but we actually have talked
about them a lot in past years

00:32:24.896 --> 00:32:27.796 A:middle
and there are videos from
previous WWDCs going into detail

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:28.906 A:middle
about how you can use those.

00:32:29.316 --> 00:32:31.416 A:middle
One of the things you can
do is give a name to a tab,

00:32:31.896 --> 00:32:35.806 A:middle
and then when a certain trigger
occurs, you can cause that tab

00:32:35.806 --> 00:32:39.136 A:middle
with a certain name to be
opened in a separate window

00:32:39.136 --> 00:32:40.576 A:middle
or in the same window,
et cetera.

00:32:40.886 --> 00:32:42.576 A:middle
This is great for
combining with things like,

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:45.216 A:middle
oh there was console
output, let me go to the Tab

00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:46.236 A:middle
that I've named Console.

00:32:46.236 --> 00:32:48.296 A:middle
So, if you like working
in the tab format--

00:32:48.706 --> 00:32:52.056 A:middle
with a tab workflow, that's
a great way to set it up.

00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:55.596 A:middle
You could also create
your own custom actions,

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:57.146 A:middle
your custom triggers

00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:59.406 A:middle
and associate a key
equivalent with those.

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:02.906 A:middle
So then, obviously that
triggers whenever you hit

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:02.906 A:middle
So then, obviously that
triggers whenever you hit

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:03.856 A:middle
that key combination.

00:33:04.726 --> 00:33:05.986 A:middle
And that's very useful not only

00:33:05.986 --> 00:33:08.926 A:middle
for invoking the built-in
behaviors that Xcode has,

00:33:09.306 --> 00:33:11.986 A:middle
but also for invoking
custom behaviors.

00:33:11.986 --> 00:33:14.496 A:middle
You can choose any shell script
that you want to have run

00:33:15.016 --> 00:33:17.166 A:middle
and associate that with
any action including the

00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:17.746 A:middle
Command key.

00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:20.706 A:middle
So, the script can get
past certain information

00:33:20.706 --> 00:33:22.696 A:middle
about the context like the
file you're looking at.

00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:25.656 A:middle
So, this can be a great way
to invoke custom scripts,

00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:28.296 A:middle
really those power users you
want to do custom operations

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:29.306 A:middle
when you hit ceratin keys.

00:33:30.626 --> 00:33:34.276 A:middle
And so, with that, that
was a quick view of the UI.

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:37.326 A:middle
I'd like to hand it back to Rick
who's going to talk about some

00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:39.216 A:middle
of the underlying
concept of Xcode.

00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:41.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Rick Ballard: Thanks, Anders.

00:33:43.046 --> 00:33:45.436 A:middle
So, that's an introduction
to Xcode user interface.

00:33:45.806 --> 00:33:48.746 A:middle
Let's talk about the underlying
conceptual model in Xcode

00:33:48.746 --> 00:33:51.036 A:middle
that you want to know about
to get things done day to day.

00:33:51.936 --> 00:33:53.566 A:middle
After this section,
you should come away

00:33:53.566 --> 00:33:55.016 A:middle
with a few important takeaways.

00:33:55.476 --> 00:33:58.846 A:middle
You should understand how set up
your own workspace with projects

00:33:58.846 --> 00:34:01.496 A:middle
and targets, how to
configure your settings

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.846 --> 00:34:01.496 A:middle
and targets, how to
configure your settings

00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:03.856 A:middle
to produce the products
that you want to produce,

00:34:04.456 --> 00:34:07.516 A:middle
how to use schemes to perform
actions on those products

00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:10.545 A:middle
like running in the debugger,
testing your unit tests,

00:34:10.886 --> 00:34:12.106 A:middle
profiling for performance,

00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:13.996 A:middle
statically analyzing
your source code,

00:34:14.226 --> 00:34:16.045 A:middle
and archiving your
product for distribution.

00:34:16.786 --> 00:34:18.766 A:middle
And you should come away
with the better understanding

00:34:18.766 --> 00:34:21.726 A:middle
of Xcode's underlying conceptual
model which will help you feel

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.136 A:middle
like you know what
you're doing in Xcode.

00:34:23.616 --> 00:34:25.806 A:middle
So, the fundamental
concepts we're going to go

00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:28.806 A:middle
over today are workspaces,
projects

00:34:28.806 --> 00:34:31.976 A:middle
and the build configurations
they contain, targets

00:34:32.246 --> 00:34:34.696 A:middle
and the build settings and
build phases that they contain,

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:38.315 A:middle
schemes, and finally
run destinations.

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.616 A:middle
Let's get started
with workspaces.

00:34:41.116 --> 00:34:44.596 A:middle
Workspaces are collections of
files and projects with state.

00:34:45.966 --> 00:34:49.466 A:middle
So, a workspace contains a
set of related Xcode projects

00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.306 A:middle
that you want to work
with at the same time,

00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:54.056 A:middle
along with any other related
files that you want to have

00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:57.486 A:middle
like todos and notes
that go along with it.

00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:59.936 A:middle
Your workspace provides
repository for state.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
So that means things like
the user interface state.

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:03.916 A:middle
What windows and tabs
did you have opened

00:35:03.916 --> 00:35:05.026 A:middle
and what files are they showing?

00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:07.216 A:middle
It means what breakpoints
do you have set

00:35:07.566 --> 00:35:10.576 A:middle
and other related state,
all get saved per workspace.

00:35:11.836 --> 00:35:13.876 A:middle
Your workspace also
provides a unique location

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:15.036 A:middle
for your build products.

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.936 A:middle
So, all the build products
produced by targets and projects

00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:20.726 A:middle
in one workspace will go to
that workspace's unique location

00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:22.536 A:middle
and won't get mixed up
with the build products

00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:23.596 A:middle
from another workspace.

00:35:24.876 --> 00:35:27.396 A:middle
Finally, your workspace
provides a symbol index

00:35:27.396 --> 00:35:29.306 A:middle
of all the symbols
in that workspace.

00:35:29.596 --> 00:35:33.016 A:middle
So, anything, any method, any
class, any symbols you have,

00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:35.556 A:middle
in any projects in that
workspace, you can get to easily

00:35:35.556 --> 00:35:37.126 A:middle
from anywhere else
in the workspace

00:35:37.126 --> 00:35:38.536 A:middle
with our features
like open quickly.

00:35:40.136 --> 00:35:42.436 A:middle
So, when should you actually
create your own explicit

00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:43.466 A:middle
workspace document?

00:35:43.826 --> 00:35:46.486 A:middle
Well, anytime you have
a set of Xcode projects

00:35:46.486 --> 00:35:48.786 A:middle
that you use together,
it generally makes sense

00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:51.236 A:middle
to create a workspace
document, put those projects

00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:53.836 A:middle
in the document and
work with that workspace

00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:55.506 A:middle
when you're working with them.

00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:57.116 A:middle
Another important
reason to think

00:35:57.116 --> 00:35:59.936 A:middle
about workspaces is what we
call implicit dependencies.

00:35:59.936 --> 00:36:03.076 A:middle
So, you can make targets
explicitly depend on each other,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.936 --> 00:36:03.076 A:middle
So, you can make targets
explicitly depend on each other,

00:36:03.206 --> 00:36:04.816 A:middle
but you don't actually
have to do that.

00:36:04.866 --> 00:36:08.096 A:middle
If you have an application and
it links against the library

00:36:08.456 --> 00:36:11.166 A:middle
and you put the project
that builds the application

00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:13.986 A:middle
in the same workspace with the
project that builds the library,

00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:17.806 A:middle
Xcode will notice that implicit
dependency and make that happen

00:36:17.806 --> 00:36:20.056 A:middle
so that whenever you build
the application target,

00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:23.386 A:middle
it will build the library
target first automatically

00:36:23.586 --> 00:36:26.496 A:middle
so the application can link
against the built library.

00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:29.976 A:middle
So, you can use workspaces
to put things in together

00:36:29.976 --> 00:36:32.266 A:middle
when you want to detect
those implicit dependencies.

00:36:32.266 --> 00:36:35.996 A:middle
The last thing to know about
workspaces is in Xcode,

00:36:35.996 --> 00:36:38.716 A:middle
even if you haven't created an
explicit workspace document,

00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:40.466 A:middle
you always have a workspace.

00:36:40.776 --> 00:36:43.526 A:middle
Xcode projects, like if you
open a bare Xcode project,

00:36:43.526 --> 00:36:46.336 A:middle
it will act as its
own implicit workspace

00:36:46.566 --> 00:36:48.766 A:middle
and provide a unique
location for build products,

00:36:49.046 --> 00:36:50.836 A:middle
saved state, and so forth.

00:36:50.836 --> 00:36:53.256 A:middle
So, anything I say about
workspaces applies to working

00:36:53.256 --> 00:36:54.846 A:middle
with bare Xcode projects
as well.

00:36:56.156 --> 00:36:57.506 A:middle
So, let's talk about projects.

00:36:58.136 --> 00:37:01.056 A:middle
Your Xcode projects are
collection of files, targets,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.136 --> 00:37:01.056 A:middle
Your Xcode projects are
collection of files, targets,

00:37:01.316 --> 00:37:03.326 A:middle
schemes, and build
configurations.

00:37:04.576 --> 00:37:08.036 A:middle
So, a project contains file
references to source files

00:37:08.036 --> 00:37:11.456 A:middle
and resource files that you
want to use, a set of targets

00:37:11.616 --> 00:37:13.376 A:middle
which process those
files in order

00:37:13.376 --> 00:37:16.686 A:middle
to produce your build
products, a set of schemes

00:37:16.896 --> 00:37:18.846 A:middle
which will tell those targets
to build their products

00:37:18.846 --> 00:37:21.976 A:middle
and then perform actions on
the product of these targets,

00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:24.806 A:middle
and a set of build
configurations which allow you

00:37:24.806 --> 00:37:26.296 A:middle
to vary your build settings.

00:37:26.546 --> 00:37:29.936 A:middle
So, build configurations
are build setting variants.

00:37:30.486 --> 00:37:32.676 A:middle
All your settings
normally have a value,

00:37:32.926 --> 00:37:35.276 A:middle
but when you have build
configurations you can vary

00:37:35.276 --> 00:37:37.536 A:middle
their value across
those configurations.

00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:40.596 A:middle
So, by default out of the
box, we give you debug

00:37:40.596 --> 00:37:42.216 A:middle
and release build configurations

00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:43.726 A:middle
and that's all most
of you will need.

00:37:43.726 --> 00:37:46.636 A:middle
You generally just have
two modes, I'm, you know,

00:37:46.836 --> 00:37:50.146 A:middle
working in the debugger or
I'm going to release my app.

00:37:50.146 --> 00:37:51.896 A:middle
Most settings don't
actually need to vary it all.

00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:53.086 A:middle
You generally just
need one value.

00:37:53.086 --> 00:37:55.766 A:middle
But there's some that you do
like your optimization level.

00:37:56.096 --> 00:37:57.186 A:middle
When you're debugging your code,

00:37:57.186 --> 00:37:58.746 A:middle
you don't want your
code to be optimized.

00:37:58.936 --> 00:38:00.996 A:middle
When you're releasing to the
App store you definitely do.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.936 --> 00:38:00.996 A:middle
When you're releasing to the
App store you definitely do.

00:38:00.996 --> 00:38:02.966 A:middle
So, that's when you use
build configurations.

00:38:03.876 --> 00:38:07.086 A:middle
Finally, you can create your own
build configurations if you need

00:38:07.086 --> 00:38:08.946 A:middle
to vary your build settings
for another purpose.

00:38:09.276 --> 00:38:11.306 A:middle
But, most of you are
probably going to be just fine

00:38:11.306 --> 00:38:12.946 A:middle
with just debug and release.

00:38:14.276 --> 00:38:15.806 A:middle
You can get your
build configurations

00:38:15.806 --> 00:38:18.066 A:middle
and your other project
settings in the project editor.

00:38:18.576 --> 00:38:19.936 A:middle
You first select the project

00:38:19.936 --> 00:38:21.736 A:middle
in the project navigator
on the left.

00:38:22.246 --> 00:38:24.666 A:middle
And then from the project
editor pop-up, you make sure

00:38:24.666 --> 00:38:26.086 A:middle
that the project is selected.

00:38:26.896 --> 00:38:28.956 A:middle
This gives you the
project editor on the right

00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:31.476 A:middle
which has some common
project settings and this is

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:33.426 A:middle
where you define your
build configurations.

00:38:33.926 --> 00:38:36.626 A:middle
Let's talk about targets.

00:38:37.056 --> 00:38:40.396 A:middle
Targets are the instructions
for building one build product.

00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:42.856 A:middle
So, your targets can--

00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:45.186 A:middle
will reference some or all
of the all source files

00:38:45.186 --> 00:38:47.816 A:middle
and resource files in
that target's project.

00:38:48.556 --> 00:38:51.176 A:middle
And the target contains
a set of build phases.

00:38:51.406 --> 00:38:53.686 A:middle
The build phases are the
high level sequence of steps

00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:54.956 A:middle
that the target is going to take

00:38:55.216 --> 00:38:56.756 A:middle
when it produces
your build product.

00:38:57.656 --> 00:38:59.066 A:middle
There's also a set
of build rules

00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:02.536 A:middle
that determine how the compile
sources build phase will compile

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:02.536 A:middle
that determine how the compile
sources build phase will compile

00:39:02.536 --> 00:39:03.236 A:middle
your sources.

00:39:03.546 --> 00:39:05.896 A:middle
You notice a build rules
tab in the target editor,

00:39:05.896 --> 00:39:07.486 A:middle
but most of you don't
need to mess with this.

00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:11.406 A:middle
And finally, a set of build
settings will define pretty much

00:39:11.406 --> 00:39:13.916 A:middle
every aspect of how that
build process works.

00:39:14.876 --> 00:39:17.386 A:middle
Targets can also depend on
one or more other targets

00:39:17.686 --> 00:39:21.006 A:middle
and a target you depend on will
be built first automatically

00:39:21.006 --> 00:39:23.566 A:middle
whenever your target is built.

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:25.666 A:middle
So, let's talk about
target build phases.

00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:28.286 A:middle
Build phases again are the
high level sequence of steps

00:39:28.286 --> 00:39:30.596 A:middle
that your target will take
when producing a product.

00:39:31.726 --> 00:39:34.406 A:middle
So, some of the common
reasons why you might want

00:39:34.406 --> 00:39:36.226 A:middle
to go edit the build
phases are--

00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:38.886 A:middle
you might want to set per
file compiler build settings.

00:39:39.636 --> 00:39:42.586 A:middle
You might want to add
resources to your product

00:39:42.586 --> 00:39:43.726 A:middle
or configure exactly

00:39:43.726 --> 00:39:46.066 A:middle
where inside your product
those resources go.

00:39:46.536 --> 00:39:48.896 A:middle
You might want to make a target
depend on another target.

00:39:49.686 --> 00:39:52.336 A:middle
You might want run a script
while building in order

00:39:52.336 --> 00:39:54.576 A:middle
to do just about anything
else that isn't covered

00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:55.616 A:middle
by the built-in behavior.

00:39:55.746 --> 00:39:59.176 A:middle
You get at your build
phases in the target editor.

00:39:59.646 --> 00:40:01.656 A:middle
So, from the project
editor pop-up,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.646 --> 00:40:01.656 A:middle
So, from the project
editor pop-up,

00:40:01.656 --> 00:40:04.176 A:middle
make sure that your target is
selected that you want to edit,

00:40:04.376 --> 00:40:06.296 A:middle
and you get the target
editor on the right.

00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:08.946 A:middle
And this-- In the general
tab, we'll show some

00:40:08.946 --> 00:40:12.086 A:middle
of the common target settings
you might want to get at.

00:40:12.296 --> 00:40:14.146 A:middle
If you select the
build phases tab,

00:40:14.886 --> 00:40:16.766 A:middle
we'll show you the high
level sequence of steps

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:19.116 A:middle
that your target is going to
take when building your product.

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:21.216 A:middle
So, let's go through
this briefly.

00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:24.796 A:middle
The Target Dependencies
phase lists all the targets

00:40:24.796 --> 00:40:26.066 A:middle
that your target depends on

00:40:26.066 --> 00:40:27.596 A:middle
and you can add and
remove them here.

00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:31.906 A:middle
The Compile Sources phase
shows all the source files

00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:33.286 A:middle
that your target is
going to compile.

00:40:33.486 --> 00:40:35.616 A:middle
If you want to set per
file compiler flags

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:38.136 A:middle
like maybe you want to turn off
ARC for just one of your files,

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.046 A:middle
you can do that on the
Compile Sources phase.

00:40:41.796 --> 00:40:45.046 A:middle
The Link Binaries with Libraries
phase lets you setup what

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:47.396 A:middle
libraries and frameworks your
target's product is going

00:40:47.396 --> 00:40:48.196 A:middle
to link against.

00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:52.076 A:middle
If your target produces
a framework on OS X,

00:40:52.076 --> 00:40:55.536 A:middle
you can control which headers
get copied into that framework

00:40:55.796 --> 00:40:57.626 A:middle
with the Copy Headers
build phase.

00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:01.476 A:middle
If your target produces any
sort of bundle type output

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:01.476 A:middle
If your target produces any
sort of bundle type output

00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:04.416 A:middle
like an application bundle,
you can copy resources

00:41:04.466 --> 00:41:07.106 A:middle
in to your bundle with
the Copy Resources phase

00:41:07.286 --> 00:41:09.236 A:middle
and by default this
will copy your resources

00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:11.366 A:middle
into the resource's
subdirectory of the bundle.

00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:14.186 A:middle
But if you want to copy files
anywhere else into your product,

00:41:14.456 --> 00:41:17.226 A:middle
you can setup custom
copy file phases as well.

00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:20.166 A:middle
This allows you to specify where
you want the file to be copied.

00:41:20.376 --> 00:41:23.996 A:middle
And for example, here I've got
a helper tool and I'm copying it

00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:26.156 A:middle
into the executables
directory of my bundle

00:41:26.156 --> 00:41:28.656 A:middle
so that my application can
launch its helper tool whenever

00:41:28.656 --> 00:41:29.216 A:middle
it needs.

00:41:30.376 --> 00:41:32.326 A:middle
Finally, anything else
you want to do as part

00:41:32.326 --> 00:41:34.586 A:middle
of the build process, you
can do with shell scripts

00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:35.946 A:middle
with the run script build phase.

00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:38.506 A:middle
They can be created and
dragged to reorder them.

00:41:38.806 --> 00:41:41.356 A:middle
We'll provide the build
settings for the target

00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:44.006 A:middle
in the environment of your
scripts so it can do things

00:41:44.006 --> 00:41:46.586 A:middle
like find where your target's
product has been placed

00:41:46.586 --> 00:41:47.426 A:middle
and manipulate it.

00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:49.716 A:middle
Let's talk about
build settings now.

00:41:50.056 --> 00:41:51.376 A:middle
Build settings are
the set of values

00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:53.846 A:middle
that control exactly how
your product is built.

00:41:55.016 --> 00:41:56.766 A:middle
So, some common reasons to want

00:41:56.766 --> 00:41:59.196 A:middle
to go change your build
settings are you might want

00:41:59.196 --> 00:42:01.076 A:middle
to rename your product,
it's time to ship

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.196 --> 00:42:01.076 A:middle
to rename your product,
it's time to ship

00:42:01.076 --> 00:42:02.596 A:middle
and you're renaming
your application.

00:42:02.596 --> 00:42:03.616 A:middle
There's a build setting
for that.

00:42:04.046 --> 00:42:06.526 A:middle
You might want to set
what SDK you're targeting

00:42:06.686 --> 00:42:10.326 A:middle
or change the preprocessor
defines that the compiler passes

00:42:10.326 --> 00:42:12.596 A:middle
to outsource files
when it compiles.

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:14.686 A:middle
You might want to
update your warning flags

00:42:14.686 --> 00:42:17.356 A:middle
to configure just what warnings
you get, and there are many,

00:42:17.356 --> 00:42:19.186 A:middle
many more reasons to go
in to the build settings.

00:42:19.186 --> 00:42:19.886 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:42:20.406 --> 00:42:23.226 A:middle
If you select the build settings
tab from the target editor,

00:42:23.546 --> 00:42:26.096 A:middle
you'll see the list of all
the build settings available.

00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:27.996 A:middle
There's a basic tab
you can select

00:42:27.996 --> 00:42:29.206 A:middle
to just see the most
common ones,

00:42:29.206 --> 00:42:31.246 A:middle
but here I'm showing
you all build settings,

00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:32.716 A:middle
and they're categorized as well.

00:42:33.466 --> 00:42:35.476 A:middle
You notice that most of these
build settings only have a

00:42:35.476 --> 00:42:37.556 A:middle
single value that's because
they don't need to vary.

00:42:37.886 --> 00:42:39.736 A:middle
But, there are some
like optimization level,

00:42:39.886 --> 00:42:41.836 A:middle
that vary across
build configurations.

00:42:41.836 --> 00:42:44.226 A:middle
So, there's a different value
for debug versus release.

00:42:44.426 --> 00:42:45.726 A:middle
There's actually another axis

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.456 A:middle
on which you can vary
your build settings,

00:42:47.686 --> 00:42:49.786 A:middle
that you can make your build
settings have different values

00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:52.236 A:middle
per architecture or per SDK.

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:55.956 A:middle
And to do that, you just hover
the mouse over one of these rows

00:42:56.146 --> 00:42:58.146 A:middle
and a little plus button
will appear allowing you

00:42:58.146 --> 00:43:00.466 A:middle
to vary your build settings
along another access.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.146 --> 00:43:00.466 A:middle
to vary your build settings
along another access.

00:43:00.656 --> 00:43:02.676 A:middle
So, this is the build settings
that are set in the target.

00:43:02.876 --> 00:43:05.716 A:middle
There's actually an inheritance
flow of build settings however.

00:43:05.886 --> 00:43:07.676 A:middle
If you select the
levels tab at the top,

00:43:07.676 --> 00:43:08.586 A:middle
it will show that to you.

00:43:09.236 --> 00:43:11.876 A:middle
So, the project also has
a build settings tab,

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:14.426 A:middle
even if the project doesn't
directly produce anything,

00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:17.476 A:middle
any build settings you set on
the project will be inherited

00:43:17.476 --> 00:43:19.116 A:middle
by all targets in that project.

00:43:19.116 --> 00:43:21.476 A:middle
So, it provides a good
way to set uniform values

00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:23.016 A:middle
across multiple targets.

00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:25.436 A:middle
In the levels mode, we'll
show you that inheritance.

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:28.466 A:middle
On the right, you'll
see the default value

00:43:28.466 --> 00:43:30.156 A:middle
for every build setting
that would be used

00:43:30.156 --> 00:43:31.366 A:middle
if you didn't customize it.

00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:34.756 A:middle
To the left of that are
all the build settings

00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:36.166 A:middle
that are set in the project.

00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:39.256 A:middle
So, these will be inherited by
all targets in that project.

00:43:39.606 --> 00:43:42.406 A:middle
Next come, the build
setting values

00:43:42.406 --> 00:43:44.746 A:middle
that you've set specifically
in this one target,

00:43:44.886 --> 00:43:46.846 A:middle
and those will override
the project build settings.

00:43:47.266 --> 00:43:49.416 A:middle
You'll also notice that
there are green boxes drawn

00:43:49.416 --> 00:43:50.406 A:middle
around some of these cells.

00:43:50.596 --> 00:43:53.746 A:middle
We draw a green box to show you
exactly where the final value

00:43:53.746 --> 00:43:55.986 A:middle
from each build setting
is being taken from.

00:43:55.986 --> 00:43:58.856 A:middle
So, you can see that
at a glance.

00:43:58.856 --> 00:44:01.256 A:middle
Finally, on the far left,
you see the result value

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.856 --> 00:44:01.256 A:middle
Finally, on the far left,
you see the result value

00:44:01.256 --> 00:44:02.186 A:middle
for every build setting

00:44:02.186 --> 00:44:03.866 A:middle
that will actually get
used when you build.

00:44:04.456 --> 00:44:06.296 A:middle
All right, let's
talk about schemes.

00:44:06.806 --> 00:44:09.276 A:middle
Schemes are the instructions
for building a set of targets

00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:11.966 A:middle
to produce a product and
then performing an action

00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:12.956 A:middle
on that product.

00:44:14.676 --> 00:44:17.936 A:middle
We support scheme actions
for running on the debugger,

00:44:18.366 --> 00:44:21.416 A:middle
profiling for performance,
testing your unit tests,

00:44:21.756 --> 00:44:24.956 A:middle
statically analyzing your source
code, and archiving your product

00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:26.436 A:middle
for distribution
to the App store

00:44:26.436 --> 00:44:30.046 A:middle
or to just save a freeze-dried
copy of your product.

00:44:30.736 --> 00:44:33.386 A:middle
For each of those actions
the scheme allows you

00:44:33.386 --> 00:44:35.626 A:middle
to specify the set of
targets that you want to build

00:44:35.626 --> 00:44:36.906 A:middle
when you're performing
that action,

00:44:37.176 --> 00:44:39.316 A:middle
and the build configuration
that this target should build

00:44:39.316 --> 00:44:41.046 A:middle
with from-- when you're
going to perform that action.

00:44:41.046 --> 00:44:44.236 A:middle
To get at your schemes
you're going to go

00:44:44.236 --> 00:44:45.266 A:middle
to the upper left-hand corner

00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.496 A:middle
of the workspace window
to the scheme pop-up.

00:44:48.176 --> 00:44:49.956 A:middle
If you just close
this, you'll see a list

00:44:49.956 --> 00:44:52.266 A:middle
of the schemes available
to you in your workspace.

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:55.306 A:middle
And you can choose to
edit scheme here to bring

00:44:55.306 --> 00:44:57.796 A:middle
up the scheme pop-up on the
currently selected scheme.

00:44:58.406 --> 00:44:59.856 A:middle
The scheme pop-up
is where you go

00:44:59.856 --> 00:45:01.986 A:middle
to edit all the settings
for that scheme.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.856 --> 00:45:01.986 A:middle
to edit all the settings
for that scheme.

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.676 A:middle
To perform a scheme action,
you can use the run button

00:45:04.676 --> 00:45:06.506 A:middle
in the upper left-hand corner
of the workspace window

00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:08.746 A:middle
or the product menu
which offers all of them.

00:45:08.986 --> 00:45:11.606 A:middle
So, here you can see
there's a run, test, profile,

00:45:11.606 --> 00:45:13.066 A:middle
analyze, and archive command.

00:45:13.756 --> 00:45:17.106 A:middle
There are also subcommands for
building for specific actions

00:45:17.106 --> 00:45:18.516 A:middle
without actually
performing that action,

00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:21.226 A:middle
and for performing an action
without building if you want

00:45:21.226 --> 00:45:24.216 A:middle
to just use your last built copy
that you built for that action.

00:45:26.096 --> 00:45:28.136 A:middle
So, that's what your
schemes are.

00:45:28.136 --> 00:45:29.426 A:middle
Let's talk about
where they come from.

00:45:30.176 --> 00:45:32.286 A:middle
Out of the box, we
will automatically try

00:45:32.286 --> 00:45:34.566 A:middle
to create the schemes
we think you want and so

00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:37.526 A:middle
that means the first time you
open a project or workspace

00:45:37.736 --> 00:45:40.126 A:middle
or whenever you create a
new project that has targets

00:45:40.266 --> 00:45:43.856 A:middle
or a new target, we'll create
a scheme for every target

00:45:43.856 --> 00:45:46.186 A:middle
that we see so that you
have at least one scheme

00:45:46.186 --> 00:45:47.946 A:middle
that will build every target.

00:45:48.726 --> 00:45:51.586 A:middle
Now, I said every target,
that's not quite true

00:45:51.586 --> 00:45:53.686 A:middle
if you have unit
test bundle targets.

00:45:53.976 --> 00:45:56.096 A:middle
Instead of putting those
tests in their own scheme,

00:45:56.296 --> 00:45:57.656 A:middle
we'll try to put
them in the scheme

00:45:57.656 --> 00:45:58.716 A:middle
of the product they go with.

00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:00.576 A:middle
So, if your tests
test an application,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:00.576 A:middle
So, if your tests
test an application,

00:46:00.576 --> 00:46:04.676 A:middle
in that application scheme's
test action we'll add the test

00:46:04.676 --> 00:46:05.366 A:middle
bundle target.

00:46:05.966 --> 00:46:07.936 A:middle
Likewise, if you
create new test bundles,

00:46:08.216 --> 00:46:10.766 A:middle
you probably don't want separate
schemes for them, you can delete

00:46:10.766 --> 00:46:13.756 A:middle
that scheme if we create it and
instead add your test bundle

00:46:13.886 --> 00:46:16.636 A:middle
to the test action of
whatever it is it tests.

00:46:17.396 --> 00:46:19.106 A:middle
These schemes that we
create automatically

00:46:19.106 --> 00:46:20.366 A:middle
for you are per user.

00:46:20.576 --> 00:46:23.306 A:middle
So, every user will get their
own copy of these schemes.

00:46:24.036 --> 00:46:27.036 A:middle
Finally, you should feel free
to delete any of the schemes

00:46:27.036 --> 00:46:28.316 A:middle
that we create that
you don't want,

00:46:28.316 --> 00:46:31.186 A:middle
because you can manually create
them again anytime you want

00:46:31.186 --> 00:46:32.926 A:middle
later from the scheme
management sheet.

00:46:32.926 --> 00:46:35.926 A:middle
And you might also find that
you want to create new schemes

00:46:36.136 --> 00:46:39.306 A:middle
to support custom workflows
with run script scheme actions,

00:46:39.306 --> 00:46:40.446 A:middle
and I'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:46:41.096 --> 00:46:42.476 A:middle
Let's talk about why
you might want to go

00:46:42.476 --> 00:46:44.966 A:middle
to the scheme editing sheet
to actually change settings.

00:46:46.006 --> 00:46:47.366 A:middle
So, first of all, you might want

00:46:47.366 --> 00:46:49.616 A:middle
to change the build
configuration that's being used

00:46:49.716 --> 00:46:52.296 A:middle
to build your targets when
performing one of your actions.

00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:55.656 A:middle
You might want to change
which unit tests get run

00:46:55.656 --> 00:46:57.046 A:middle
when you perform the test action

00:46:57.046 --> 00:47:00.326 A:middle
and you can also perform your
tests in the test navigator one

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:57.046 --> 00:47:00.326 A:middle
and you can also perform your
tests in the test navigator one

00:47:00.326 --> 00:47:03.086 A:middle
by one or as a suite or
a bundle if you want now.

00:47:03.426 --> 00:47:04.306 A:middle
But, when you want to configure

00:47:04.336 --> 00:47:06.856 A:middle
which tests get run standard
every time you test your scheme,

00:47:06.986 --> 00:47:08.186 A:middle
you do that on the test action.

00:47:09.156 --> 00:47:11.416 A:middle
You can also set arguments
and environment variables

00:47:11.416 --> 00:47:14.006 A:middle
that get passed to your App when
it's running in the debugger

00:47:14.186 --> 00:47:17.476 A:middle
or being profiled or get
passed to your unit test,

00:47:17.476 --> 00:47:20.226 A:middle
and that's done in the
scheme editor as well.

00:47:21.176 --> 00:47:22.826 A:middle
We support a bunch
of diagnostics.

00:47:22.826 --> 00:47:25.536 A:middle
There's a bunch of checkboxes in
the run action that allows you

00:47:25.536 --> 00:47:29.096 A:middle
to easily turn on things like
malloc stack logging or zombies

00:47:29.216 --> 00:47:31.606 A:middle
without having to remember the
underlying environment variable

00:47:31.606 --> 00:47:32.246 A:middle
that controls it.

00:47:32.246 --> 00:47:35.466 A:middle
And there are many other options
that you'll see when you go

00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:36.646 A:middle
to the scheme editing sheet.

00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:38.706 A:middle
We also have a more
detailed walkthrough of them

00:47:38.706 --> 00:47:41.606 A:middle
in last year's presentation
on understanding schemes.

00:47:41.976 --> 00:47:45.426 A:middle
So, if you bring up the
scheme editing sheet,

00:47:45.576 --> 00:47:47.906 A:middle
you'll see that on the
left we have a row for each

00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.396 A:middle
of the scheme actions
we support.

00:47:49.396 --> 00:47:53.856 A:middle
And there's also a row for the
build action or for building.

00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:55.826 A:middle
Building is not actually
an action.

00:47:56.066 --> 00:47:58.426 A:middle
Building is a step that
happens before each

00:47:58.426 --> 00:47:59.676 A:middle
of the other scheme actions.

00:47:59.936 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
So, when you perform an action
usually you build the prod--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.936 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
So, when you perform an action
usually you build the prod--

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:05.666 A:middle
or the targets for that action
and then perform that action.

00:48:06.446 --> 00:48:08.506 A:middle
You'll also see there's
a row of checkboxes here,

00:48:08.736 --> 00:48:11.376 A:middle
these determines which targets
gets built for which action.

00:48:11.376 --> 00:48:13.536 A:middle
And this is notable in
particular for the test action.

00:48:13.846 --> 00:48:15.376 A:middle
There's no reason to
build your unit test

00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:16.316 A:middle
if you're not going to test.

00:48:16.546 --> 00:48:19.396 A:middle
So, the test bundle,
test bundle is only built

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.576 A:middle
for the test action by default

00:48:20.576 --> 00:48:22.006 A:middle
and you can configure
this further.

00:48:22.426 --> 00:48:23.806 A:middle
Also I mentioned,
you notice some

00:48:23.806 --> 00:48:25.686 A:middle
of these checkboxes
are disabled that means

00:48:25.686 --> 00:48:28.416 A:middle
that that target is explicitly
being used by that action.

00:48:28.676 --> 00:48:30.986 A:middle
So, if you wanted to uncheck
this target you'd have

00:48:30.986 --> 00:48:33.596 A:middle
to go tell the action not
to use its product anymore.

00:48:34.686 --> 00:48:36.606 A:middle
You'll notice that there's no
build configuration in this

00:48:36.606 --> 00:48:37.786 A:middle
in the build tab and that's

00:48:37.786 --> 00:48:40.186 A:middle
because you set the build
configuration per scheme action.

00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:42.396 A:middle
So, if you select
another action like test,

00:48:42.716 --> 00:48:45.756 A:middle
you'll see that each action has
a build configuration pop-up.

00:48:46.006 --> 00:48:47.716 A:middle
So, for most scheme
actions you usually want

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:49.226 A:middle
to use the debug
build configuration.

00:48:49.466 --> 00:48:50.846 A:middle
Say, when you're
running on a debugger

00:48:51.006 --> 00:48:53.246 A:middle
or performing your unit test,
but when you're archiving

00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:54.616 A:middle
for distribution, you want

00:48:54.616 --> 00:48:57.096 A:middle
to use the release build
configuration and so we set

00:48:57.096 --> 00:48:58.806 A:middle
that up by default
to do that for you.

00:48:58.896 --> 00:49:03.016 A:middle
We also support additional
scheme action

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.896 --> 00:49:03.016 A:middle
We also support additional
scheme action

00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:04.066 A:middle
as I alluded to before.

00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:07.196 A:middle
If you disclose the disclosure
arrow to the left of any

00:49:07.196 --> 00:49:09.266 A:middle
of these actions or
before the build step,

00:49:09.566 --> 00:49:11.746 A:middle
you can set pre-imposed actions.

00:49:11.876 --> 00:49:14.206 A:middle
It will run before
or after that action

00:49:14.386 --> 00:49:16.616 A:middle
or before or after the build.

00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:19.296 A:middle
We support send e-mail
as one of these actions,

00:49:19.296 --> 00:49:21.736 A:middle
but more usefully there's
a run script action.

00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:23.496 A:middle
So, you can set up
custom schemes

00:49:23.496 --> 00:49:26.086 A:middle
to run any script you want to
support your custom workflows.

00:49:26.536 --> 00:49:28.326 A:middle
This is especially useful

00:49:28.326 --> 00:49:30.146 A:middle
with our continuous
integration features.

00:49:30.446 --> 00:49:33.626 A:middle
You can for example have
a post-archive script

00:49:33.936 --> 00:49:37.126 A:middle
which copies your built
archive to some shared servers.

00:49:37.126 --> 00:49:40.166 A:middle
So, everytime the bot produces
an archive, you put it somewhere

00:49:40.166 --> 00:49:41.616 A:middle
where everyone can
get at it easily.

00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:44.846 A:middle
The archive action provides
some things in the environment

00:49:44.846 --> 00:49:47.296 A:middle
to your script to tell it
where to find that product

00:49:47.626 --> 00:49:49.846 A:middle
and you can additionally
set a target

00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:53.046 A:middle
to provide its build settings in
the environment to your script.

00:49:53.746 --> 00:49:57.356 A:middle
The last thing I want to mention
here is, why you would use this

00:49:57.486 --> 00:50:00.096 A:middle
versus a run script
build phase in a target?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:57.486 --> 00:50:00.096 A:middle
versus a run script
build phase in a target?

00:50:00.656 --> 00:50:02.676 A:middle
Well, if your script
is an integral part

00:50:02.816 --> 00:50:06.356 A:middle
of producing the products of the
target, that probably belongs

00:50:06.356 --> 00:50:08.366 A:middle
as a run script build
phase in the target.

00:50:08.586 --> 00:50:10.686 A:middle
So, no matter which scheme
is building that target

00:50:10.846 --> 00:50:14.226 A:middle
that script gets run and the
product gets produced correctly.

00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:17.996 A:middle
If on the other hand your script
is part of a custom workflow,

00:50:17.996 --> 00:50:19.656 A:middle
that probably belongs
in the scheme.

00:50:19.656 --> 00:50:20.976 A:middle
So that you can have
different schemes

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:23.436 A:middle
with different custom
workflows or have a scheme

00:50:23.436 --> 00:50:25.076 A:middle
that doesn't run it
when you don't want to.

00:50:25.076 --> 00:50:26.446 A:middle
So, that's how to
edit your schemes.

00:50:26.596 --> 00:50:27.866 A:middle
Let's talk about
how to manage them.

00:50:28.656 --> 00:50:30.536 A:middle
In the scheme pop-up
in the upper left,

00:50:30.976 --> 00:50:33.976 A:middle
there's a Manage Schemes
option and if you choose this,

00:50:33.976 --> 00:50:36.856 A:middle
it will bring up the scheme
management sheet giving you all

00:50:36.856 --> 00:50:39.226 A:middle
the schemes in your workspace
and projects and a list

00:50:39.226 --> 00:50:40.316 A:middle
of settings you can change.

00:50:40.316 --> 00:50:41.796 A:middle
So, let's talk about these.

00:50:42.246 --> 00:50:44.546 A:middle
First of all, there's
a shared checkbox

00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:45.656 A:middle
for each of these schemes.

00:50:45.966 --> 00:50:48.846 A:middle
Now, I said before that every
scheme we give you is per user,

00:50:49.016 --> 00:50:51.946 A:middle
just for you, but sometimes
you might have authored the

00:50:51.946 --> 00:50:52.766 A:middle
perfect scheme.

00:50:53.006 --> 00:50:55.296 A:middle
It's got just the targets
that you want to build

00:50:55.296 --> 00:50:56.496 A:middle
and the right arguments

00:50:56.496 --> 00:50:58.226 A:middle
and environment variables
being passed when you run

00:50:58.226 --> 00:50:59.866 A:middle
in the debugger, and
you want to share this

00:50:59.866 --> 00:51:02.126 A:middle
with your coworkers 'cause
everybody wants to use this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.866 --> 00:51:02.126 A:middle
with your coworkers 'cause
everybody wants to use this.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:04.356 A:middle
So, if you click the
shared checkbox here

00:51:04.696 --> 00:51:07.236 A:middle
that scheme will actually be
moved to a shared location

00:51:07.236 --> 00:51:09.946 A:middle
within the project or workspace
bundle, and everybody else

00:51:09.946 --> 00:51:10.936 A:middle
who works with that project

00:51:10.936 --> 00:51:13.546 A:middle
or workspace will get a
copy of that scheme too.

00:51:13.876 --> 00:51:15.786 A:middle
This also means that any
edits that anyone makes

00:51:15.786 --> 00:51:17.886 A:middle
that scheme will be
shared with everybody,

00:51:17.886 --> 00:51:20.076 A:middle
because it's a one
shared copy of the scheme.

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:22.326 A:middle
You know, some times if you work
on a big team and have a lot

00:51:22.326 --> 00:51:24.716 A:middle
of shared schemes, you might
have some that you don't care

00:51:24.716 --> 00:51:26.926 A:middle
about and don't want cluttering
up your scheme pop-up.

00:51:26.976 --> 00:51:29.636 A:middle
For example the QA team might
have some special schemes

00:51:29.636 --> 00:51:31.066 A:middle
that they use for
custom workflows,

00:51:31.286 --> 00:51:32.666 A:middle
but you don't always
want to be wading

00:51:32.666 --> 00:51:33.866 A:middle
through those when
you're working.

00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:36.136 A:middle
So, we have a show
checkbox on the left

00:51:36.356 --> 00:51:39.796 A:middle
and if you uncheck this,
that scheme just won't show

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:41.626 A:middle
up for you in the
scheme pop-up anymore,

00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:43.676 A:middle
but that won't affect
anybody else.

00:51:43.676 --> 00:51:45.976 A:middle
Anybody who's sharing that
scheme will still be able

00:51:45.976 --> 00:51:49.096 A:middle
to use it and this
checkbox is per user.

00:51:49.096 --> 00:51:49.966 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit

00:51:49.966 --> 00:51:52.106 A:middle
about where these schemes
actually are stored.

00:51:52.636 --> 00:51:55.876 A:middle
Actually before that, when
you have a shared scheme,

00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:59.276 A:middle
you may sometimes want to make
some temporary one-off changes

00:51:59.276 --> 00:52:00.896 A:middle
like you want to
enable a diagnostic

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:59.276 --> 00:52:00.896 A:middle
like you want to
enable a diagnostic

00:52:01.196 --> 00:52:03.116 A:middle
or add an additional
command line argument.

00:52:03.456 --> 00:52:05.786 A:middle
But if you do that to a
shared scheme it will show

00:52:05.786 --> 00:52:07.906 A:middle
up for everybody and that's
not always what you want.

00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:09.756 A:middle
So, in that case we
generally recommend

00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:12.616 A:middle
that you create a duplicate of
that scheme that shared scheme,

00:52:12.726 --> 00:52:15.746 A:middle
with the Duplicate command,
and make your modifications

00:52:15.986 --> 00:52:18.656 A:middle
in your own per-user
copy of that scheme.

00:52:19.066 --> 00:52:21.396 A:middle
When you're done with that
per-user copy, you can delete it

00:52:21.396 --> 00:52:23.326 A:middle
to go-- go back to
using the shared scheme.

00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:25.946 A:middle
So, now let's talk about
where exactly these schemes

00:52:25.946 --> 00:52:26.446 A:middle
are stored.

00:52:26.876 --> 00:52:29.316 A:middle
Every scheme is actually
stored in its own separate file

00:52:29.316 --> 00:52:31.356 A:middle
so that you can manage it
easily in source control.

00:52:31.786 --> 00:52:34.186 A:middle
And that scheme file is
stored inside a project

00:52:34.186 --> 00:52:35.286 A:middle
or workspace wrapper.

00:52:36.336 --> 00:52:39.206 A:middle
So, that container column
here shows you which project

00:52:39.206 --> 00:52:41.826 A:middle
or workspace wrapper each
scheme file is stored in.

00:52:42.116 --> 00:52:43.946 A:middle
And you can bring up
a menu here to change

00:52:43.946 --> 00:52:45.626 A:middle
where you want to
store that scheme.

00:52:46.236 --> 00:52:47.426 A:middle
This is important to think

00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:49.276 A:middle
about when you're working
with source control.

00:52:49.726 --> 00:52:52.576 A:middle
So, under source control,
you'll see inside a project

00:52:52.576 --> 00:52:55.986 A:middle
or workspace wrapper, there's
a separate shared data section

00:52:55.986 --> 00:52:58.676 A:middle
and user data section for
the data that's shared

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:01.776 A:middle
between all users or the
data that's per user to you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:01.776 A:middle
between all users or the
data that's per user to you.

00:53:02.236 --> 00:53:04.666 A:middle
In the shared data section,
you'll see any schemes

00:53:04.666 --> 00:53:06.966 A:middle
that you've chosen to share,
and so generally you want

00:53:06.966 --> 00:53:09.296 A:middle
to commit this to source
control so that anybody else

00:53:09.296 --> 00:53:10.786 A:middle
in your team who
checks out your project

00:53:10.786 --> 00:53:13.816 A:middle
or workspace will actually get
a copy of that shared scheme.

00:53:14.346 --> 00:53:17.656 A:middle
In the per-user section, you see
all your own personal schemes,

00:53:17.716 --> 00:53:20.836 A:middle
as well as the scheme management
property list that records

00:53:21.006 --> 00:53:22.946 A:middle
which schemes you've
chosen to show and hide

00:53:23.136 --> 00:53:25.816 A:middle
and what order you want them to
show up in, in the scheme pop-up

00:53:25.816 --> 00:53:27.336 A:middle
since you can drag
to reorder them

00:53:27.336 --> 00:53:28.446 A:middle
in the scheme management sheet.

00:53:29.176 --> 00:53:31.626 A:middle
You might often want to check
in your own schemes here

00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:33.746 A:middle
as well just so you
can track changes

00:53:33.936 --> 00:53:36.716 A:middle
and have those personal schemes
available to you if you set

00:53:36.716 --> 00:53:39.476 A:middle
up any custom settings, whenever
you check out that project

00:53:39.476 --> 00:53:40.706 A:middle
or workspace somewhere else.

00:53:41.076 --> 00:53:42.746 A:middle
There's one more thing I
want to talk about today

00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:44.086 A:middle
and that's run destinations.

00:53:44.416 --> 00:53:45.836 A:middle
Run destinations are the devices

00:53:45.836 --> 00:53:48.016 A:middle
on which you can
perform scheme actions.

00:53:48.246 --> 00:53:51.326 A:middle
So, the run destinations we
give you are all the devices

00:53:51.326 --> 00:53:54.036 A:middle
that you want to
build for and run on,

00:53:54.946 --> 00:53:58.326 A:middle
and we let you choose among
all plugged in iOS devices

00:53:58.326 --> 00:53:59.626 A:middle
which are configured
for development,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:00.336 --> 00:54:03.396 A:middle
all available simulators,
and the local Mac.

00:54:04.276 --> 00:54:06.096 A:middle
But of course we'll
only give you choices

00:54:06.096 --> 00:54:09.396 A:middle
of those run destinations which
are compatible with the targets

00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:12.856 A:middle
in your schemes,
Deployment Target setting,

00:54:12.856 --> 00:54:14.106 A:middle
and Base SDK setting.

00:54:14.106 --> 00:54:18.236 A:middle
You can get at the
run destinations

00:54:18.236 --> 00:54:20.376 A:middle
in the upper left-hand corner
of the workspace window,

00:54:20.586 --> 00:54:22.196 A:middle
just to right of
the scheme pop-up.

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.166 A:middle
And if you disclose the run
destination pop-up you'll see

00:54:25.166 --> 00:54:27.686 A:middle
all the destinations that are
available to run on, again,

00:54:27.686 --> 00:54:28.556 A:middle
those that are compatible

00:54:28.556 --> 00:54:31.356 A:middle
with your Deployment
Target and Base SDK.

00:54:32.016 --> 00:54:34.656 A:middle
Here, I have a couple iOS
devices and several simulators.

00:54:34.856 --> 00:54:38.096 A:middle
If you, through the
download PrefPane in Xcode,

00:54:38.276 --> 00:54:40.466 A:middle
choose to install
older simulators

00:54:40.696 --> 00:54:42.606 A:middle
like you install
the iOS 6 simulator,

00:54:42.856 --> 00:54:44.746 A:middle
we'll give you those
choices as well as long

00:54:44.746 --> 00:54:45.986 A:middle
as your target is compatible.

00:54:45.986 --> 00:54:47.726 A:middle
So, you'd also say, you
have to have your target--

00:54:47.726 --> 00:54:49.886 A:middle
deployment target set to 6.0,

00:54:50.406 --> 00:54:52.806 A:middle
and with that simulator
installed now we give you choice

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:54.576 A:middle
of which OS you want to simulate

00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.236 A:middle
when you're choosing
your run destination.

00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:59.006 A:middle
So that about wraps it up
for the fundamental concepts.

00:54:59.246 --> 00:55:02.786 A:middle
We've talked about
workspaces, projects, targets,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:59.246 --> 00:55:02.786 A:middle
We've talked about
workspaces, projects, targets,

00:55:03.036 --> 00:55:05.086 A:middle
schemes, and run destinations.

00:55:05.916 --> 00:55:09.046 A:middle
After today's talk, I hope you
have a few useful takeaways.

00:55:09.416 --> 00:55:11.146 A:middle
You should feel comfortable
navigating

00:55:11.146 --> 00:55:13.056 A:middle
and editing efficiently
in Xcode.

00:55:13.766 --> 00:55:15.916 A:middle
You should know how to
integrate your own documentation

00:55:16.076 --> 00:55:19.336 A:middle
in Xcode's help and code
completion using the

00:55:19.336 --> 00:55:20.486 A:middle
doxygen format.

00:55:21.266 --> 00:55:24.016 A:middle
You should understand how to
customize Xcode's behavior,

00:55:24.016 --> 00:55:26.756 A:middle
so the UI behaves
just the way you want.

00:55:27.306 --> 00:55:28.406 A:middle
You should know how to create

00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:30.796 A:middle
and configure your own
workspaces, projects,

00:55:30.796 --> 00:55:33.066 A:middle
and targets and set their
settings appropriately.

00:55:33.636 --> 00:55:35.836 A:middle
And you should understand
how to manage

00:55:35.836 --> 00:55:38.046 A:middle
and share your schemes
with your teammates.

00:55:38.526 --> 00:55:42.136 A:middle
If you have more questions
I highly encourage you

00:55:42.136 --> 00:55:44.586 A:middle
to contact Dave Delong
who's our App Frameworks

00:55:44.586 --> 00:55:45.946 A:middle
and Developer Tools Evangelist.

00:55:46.466 --> 00:55:48.486 A:middle
We also have documentation
on Xcode

00:55:48.486 --> 00:55:51.926 A:middle
at developer.apple.com/xcode
as your jumping off point.

00:55:52.576 --> 00:55:55.506 A:middle
And if you haven't used it
already the Apple dev forums are

00:55:55.506 --> 00:55:58.536 A:middle
great place to come and
discuss and ask question

00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:02.186 A:middle
about the new versions of
Xcode or existing features.

about the new versions of
Xcode or existing features.

00:56:02.386 --> 00:56:04.326 A:middle
That's at devforums.apple.com.

00:56:04.876 --> 00:56:08.596 A:middle
We have some more sessions about
Xcode coming up for you today.

00:56:08.846 --> 00:56:13.776 A:middle
I encourage you to take a
look at these and go to any

00:56:13.776 --> 00:56:14.526 A:middle
that strike your fancy.

00:56:14.526 --> 00:56:16.186 A:middle
We've got a lot of great
information for you.
