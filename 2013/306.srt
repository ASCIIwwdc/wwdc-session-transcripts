[ Silence ]

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:10.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dave Van Tassell:
OK, good morning.

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
Welcome to iTunes Connect,

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:16.286 A:middle
What's New in iTunes
Connect [applause].

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:18.236 A:middle
I'm Dave Van Tassell,

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.146 A:middle
Engineering Manager,
iTunes Connect.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:20.836 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:26.676 A:middle
This year, we are excited to
go over three new features

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:28.616 A:middle
that are some of the more
highly requested features

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:29.776 A:middle
from you for us.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:33.766 A:middle
First one is enhanced score
and leaderboard management.

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:36.616 A:middle
Second, app transfer.

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:38.226 A:middle
[Cheering and applause] Yes.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.446 A:middle
Third, enhanced command
line automation.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.486 A:middle
And then at the end
we want to go

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:46.116 A:middle
over some App Review
dos and don'ts.

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.716 A:middle
OK, score management,
what is this?

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.456 A:middle
Well, let's look at some high
scores from different games.

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:56.006 A:middle
Angry Birds Star Wars
let's take a look here.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.336 A:middle
We can see the highest
score for their total game.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:00:59.526 A:middle
That's a good score.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.906 A:middle
What about Harry Potter.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.906 A:middle
What about Harry Potter.

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.276 A:middle
Let's see here, this is the
number of studs collected,

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:08.556 A:middle
and Hogwarts has
never looked so clean.

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.776 A:middle
Now, we have Scrabble.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:17.456 A:middle
This is the most wins, and
you must really love your iPad

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:18.656 A:middle
to play that many games.

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.846 A:middle
So, what do all these
scores have in common?

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:26.666 A:middle
This is a big number.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.236 A:middle
I got to be honest, I didn't
know exactly what it is

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:29.516 A:middle
in English.

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:30.966 A:middle
I had to look it
up 9 quintillion.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.996 A:middle
Most of you in this room should
be thinking to yourselves,

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:36.396 A:middle
I've seen that number, I
know what that number is,

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:40.016 A:middle
it looks familiar, Max
Int, something like that.

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:43.516 A:middle
So these high scores,
are they high scores?

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.816 A:middle
Or, are they unearned scores?

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:47.366 A:middle
I think people have
been cheating.

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:50.356 A:middle
So, how do we prevent this?

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.916 A:middle
Well, at iTunes Connect,
we have score range.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:55.576 A:middle
You can enter in a
min and a max score,

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.136 A:middle
and if any score is posted
outside of that range,

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:00.636 A:middle
then we don't post it to the
Game Center leaderboards.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:00.636 A:middle
then we don't post it to the
Game Center leaderboards.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:03.646 A:middle
New this year is score signing

00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:07.416 A:middle
to help make those
scores more safe.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.436 A:middle
And, there was some information,

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:10.786 A:middle
there was a Game Center
session yesterday,

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:13.116 A:middle
and there's another one today to
talk more about those features

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:15.666 A:middle
and enhancements we've
made with both of them.

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:16.506 A:middle
But that's great.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.076 A:middle
How do we fix these
existing scores?

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:21.606 A:middle
Well, that's what leaderboard
score management is all about.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.046 A:middle
Exactly what it is, you
log into iTunes Connect,

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:26.456 A:middle
and you click on a leaderboard.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.036 A:middle
Once you do that, you
want to manage the scores.

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:31.736 A:middle
You'll be presented with the top
100 scores for that leaderboard.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.656 A:middle
You can choose at that point to
either delete the invalid score,

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:38.936 A:middle
or you can block a user and
all their invalid scores.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:42.586 A:middle
So, let's focus on
deleting a score right now.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.496 A:middle
What this does, it just removes
the score from the leaderboard.

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:50.026 A:middle
And the user is able
to play the game again

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:51.066 A:middle
and post another score,

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:53.296 A:middle
and hopefully this
time a real score,

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:55.126 A:middle
and it will show
up on Game Center.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:01.296 A:middle
No other leaderboards
are affected by this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:01.296 A:middle
No other leaderboards
are affected by this.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:02.226 A:middle
Blocking a user.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.936 A:middle
This will remove the score
not only from that leaderboard

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:08.386 A:middle
but all leaderboards
on your app.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.786 A:middle
Not only is the score deleted,
but the user is then blocked

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:15.396 A:middle
from posting any new
scores for that leaderboard

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.446 A:middle
and all the leaderboards
on your app.

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:19.826 A:middle
If your app happens
to be grouped,

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:21.446 A:middle
then the same thing applies

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:22.736 A:middle
to all the leaderboards
in that group.

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.486 A:middle
The scores are wiped from all
the leaderboards in that group,

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:28.576 A:middle
and they are blocked from
posting any new scores

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:29.396 A:middle
to those leaderboards.

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:33.666 A:middle
So, that's leaderboard
score management.

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:38.316 A:middle
You can delete unearned scores,
you can block the cheaters.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.466 A:middle
It's a great way to
offer customer service

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:45.096 A:middle
to your customers, and it will
be available later this year.

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:47.706 A:middle
But I'm going to remind you,

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.956 A:middle
with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:51.486 A:middle
And, I think you know
where I'm going with this.

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:54.146 A:middle
These are your customers;
they're our customers.

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:56.786 A:middle
Let's treat them fairly and
with the respect they're due.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:01.536 A:middle
So that's score management.

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:02.006 A:middle
Let's talk a little

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:05.216 A:middle
about leaderboard
management, leaderboard sets.

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:07.686 A:middle
If you attended yesterday's
Game Center session or played

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.076 A:middle
around a little on
iTunes Connect this week,

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.166 A:middle
you've seen leaderboard sets.

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:13.056 A:middle
And what this is, is a way to
collect similar leaderboards

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:15.566 A:middle
and give them a common
name, a shared icon.

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:17.346 A:middle
It gives you better
leaderboard navigation.

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:21.446 A:middle
We're also giving
you the ability

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:23.426 A:middle
to have a display
name localization,

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:25.266 A:middle
so each leaderboard can have
a custom name in these sets.

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:26.906 A:middle
And the great thing

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:28.196 A:middle
about leaderboard
sets is you're allowed

00:04:28.196 --> 00:04:30.406 A:middle
to have 500 leaderboards
per app.

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.176 A:middle
So, we talked about
leaderboards today.

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:36.366 A:middle
So, we have our Touch Fighter
2 game with four leaderboards.

00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:38.456 A:middle
They kind of just flow
down in front of the user

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:39.256 A:middle
when they go to Game Center.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.296 A:middle
Level 1 High Score,
Level 1 Fastest Time.

00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:44.686 A:middle
Level 2 High Score,
Level 2 Fastest Time.

00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:48.766 A:middle
What we want to do now is create
a couple of sets for them.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:51.146 A:middle
So, we'll take those first
two Level 1 leaderboards

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.636 A:middle
and create a set called Level 1.

00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:55.836 A:middle
Take the second two
leaderboards of Level 2,

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.246 A:middle
and there they go
into Level 2 set.

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.726 A:middle
Talk about display
name localization.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.726 A:middle
Talk about display
name localization.

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:03.676 A:middle
Again, we have these
four leaderboards.

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:04.826 A:middle
We create our set.

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:08.346 A:middle
Level 1 High Score can rename
to just High Score in this set.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:10.806 A:middle
Level 1 Fastest Time
is just Fastest Time,

00:05:11.796 --> 00:05:12.976 A:middle
similar to the Level 2 set.

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.936 A:middle
Take their High Score and
Fastest Time leaderboards

00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:17.326 A:middle
and then you get
the display name

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:18.916 A:middle
of High Score and Fastest Time.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.986 A:middle
And if we introduced a third
set where you mix and match,

00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:25.586 A:middle
we can change that Level 1 High
Score now has a display name

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:26.346 A:middle
of just Level 1.

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:33.386 A:middle
Level 2 High Score,
display name of Level 2.

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:35.066 A:middle
Again, leaderboard
sets: The great thing

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:38.856 A:middle
about it is 500 leaderboards
per game, and you can mix it --

00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:40.996 A:middle
you can put your leaderboards
in as many sets as you want.

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:45.146 A:middle
However, once you do put
your leaderboards into a set,

00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:46.076 A:middle
then all of your leaderboards

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:47.306 A:middle
in your app will
need to be in a set.

00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:48.226 A:middle
There's no mixing and matching.

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:52.416 A:middle
This works for both grouped
and non-grouped games.

00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:54.816 A:middle
You add your localization
in iTunes Connect,

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.566 A:middle
and it is available
in sandbox mode today.

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.636 A:middle
With that, I'd like
to turn the time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.636 A:middle
With that, I'd like
to turn the time

00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:03.426 A:middle
over to Daniel Miao
[phonetic] to give us a demo

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:04.926 A:middle
of this feature in
iTunes Connect.

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:06.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Daniel Miao: My
name is Daniel.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:08.316 A:middle
I'm an engineer on
iTunes Connect.

00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:11.576 A:middle
And, now that you've heard about
some of the new features we have

00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:15.626 A:middle
in iTunes Connect,
let's take a closer look

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.306 A:middle
at leaderboard sets
and score management.

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:24.156 A:middle
So, here we have the
Touch Fighter 2 app page.

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:27.196 A:middle
We're going to go into the
Manage Game Center Flow.

00:06:27.636 --> 00:06:32.806 A:middle
And many of you will recognize
this page as where you go to set

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:34.166 A:middle
up your leaderboards
and achievements.

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:36.756 A:middle
Now, you'll notice we
have two new buttons here.

00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:40.856 A:middle
Move All Leaderboards into Sets
and Manage Scores and Players.

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.786 A:middle
For the purposes of this demo,

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.256 A:middle
we have four leaderboards
set up.

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:49.136 A:middle
We have two Level 1 leaderboards
and two Level 2 leaderboards.

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:53.296 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and add
these into two leaderboard sets,

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.026 A:middle
one for Level 1,
and one for Level 2.

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:57.226 A:middle
So, in order to start
this process,

00:06:57.226 --> 00:06:58.646 A:middle
we're going to click
Move All Leaderboards

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
into Sets, right here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
into Sets, right here.

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:04.476 A:middle
And this page is asking us what
we'd like to call our first set.

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:07.716 A:middle
So, let's go ahead
and call that Level 1.

00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:14.876 A:middle
Then we'll give it an ID of
Touch Fighter Set Level 1.

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:16.856 A:middle
Click Continue.

00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:19.966 A:middle
And here on this page, we'll see

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:22.416 A:middle
that so far we have
one set created,

00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.086 A:middle
and we're currently
editing it, the Level 1 set.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.386 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and add
a leaderboard to this set.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:30.126 A:middle
So we'll click Add
to Display Set.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:32.066 A:middle
We'll choose a leaderboard.

00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:36.546 A:middle
In this case, we'll
choose Level 1 High Score

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.716 A:middle
and give it an English
display name.

00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:43.346 A:middle
We'll just call it High Score.

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:46.466 A:middle
Now, as Dave had mentioned,

00:07:47.256 --> 00:07:49.466 A:middle
display names designate what
we'd like this leaderboard

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:51.756 A:middle
to show up as, inside
of this set.

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:56.486 A:middle
So, in a Level 1 set, the Level
1 High Score leaderboard will

00:07:56.486 --> 00:07:59.806 A:middle
show up as just High Score,
so Level 1 High Score.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:04.766 A:middle
So hit Save and save this
leaderboard to this set.

00:08:05.636 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
Then we'll go ahead and
add our second leaderboard.

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:12.116 A:middle
We'll choose Level
1 Fastest Time,

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.506 A:middle
add an English display
name again.

00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:22.706 A:middle
We'll just call this
one Fastest Time.

00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:27.306 A:middle
Now we'll add a localization
for this set.

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:29.836 A:middle
We'll choose English.

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:34.246 A:middle
And we'll just call this
one Level 1 in English.

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:37.256 A:middle
And there's also an optional
image that you can add

00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:38.426 A:middle
to these leaderboard sets.

00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:42.066 A:middle
We'll hit Save to save
this localization.

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:44.576 A:middle
And now we're finished
setting up our Level 1 set.

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.606 A:middle
So, let's add our Level 2 set.

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.066 A:middle
Click Add Display Set.

00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:52.616 A:middle
Call this one Level 2.

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:54.806 A:middle
Give an ID.

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:00.456 A:middle
Hit Save to create it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:00.456 A:middle
Hit Save to create it.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.566 A:middle
And we'll see up here that
now we have both Level 1

00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:06.026 A:middle
and Level 2, and as you create
more sets, they'll be listed

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:08.246 A:middle
out here and you can switch
between them to edit them

00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:10.476 A:middle
at any time during this process.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.766 A:middle
So, on our Level 2 leaderboards
now, we'll click Add

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:17.766 A:middle
to Display Set, and the first
thing you'll notice here is

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.796 A:middle
that now we have two sections
now; one for leaderboards not

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:22.536 A:middle
in a set, and one for
leaderboards in a set.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:25.476 A:middle
As Dave had mentioned earlier,
if you're moving leaderboards

00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:28.226 A:middle
into sets, all your
leaderboards have to be moved.

00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:29.816 A:middle
You can't have some
leaderboards in a set

00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:31.256 A:middle
and some leaderboards
not in a set.

00:09:31.256 --> 00:09:33.706 A:middle
So, this helps us to track
which leaderboards we have

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.916 A:middle
yet to move before we can finish
this initial migration process.

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:39.256 A:middle
So here we'll move our
Level 2 High Score.

00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:44.996 A:middle
Add an English display
name again.

00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
Call it High Score.

00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:53.516 A:middle
And then we'll add our
second Level 2 leaderboard.

00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:00.266 A:middle
Choose an English display name.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:00.266 A:middle
Choose an English display name.

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.106 A:middle
Call it Fastest Time.

00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:07.156 A:middle
And now all our leaderboards
have been added to sets.

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:09.336 A:middle
Now, we'll add a language.

00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:18.396 A:middle
In English, we'll
call this Level 2.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.596 A:middle
And now we're finished.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:22.636 A:middle
We've added all our
leaderboards into sets,

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:24.416 A:middle
and we have our two sets
with four leaderboards.

00:10:24.946 --> 00:10:26.956 A:middle
So hit "Save" in order
to complete this process.

00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:31.486 A:middle
And we'll see that
we have our two sets,

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.466 A:middle
and we still have the
four leaderboards below.

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:36.126 A:middle
And if we want to preview which
leaderboards are in which sets,

00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:38.286 A:middle
we click View Leaderboards
in Display Sets, right here.

00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:44.216 A:middle
And we'll see here that we
have two Level 2 leaderboards

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:47.606 A:middle
in a Level 2 set, and two Level
1 leaderboards in a Level 1 set.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.426 A:middle
And of course you can put
each leaderboard into more

00:10:49.426 --> 00:10:50.886 A:middle
than one set as you go on.

00:10:50.886 --> 00:10:53.626 A:middle
So those are leaderboard sets.

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
So we're going to go
ahead and take a look

00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:57.556 A:middle
at To Manage Scores
and Players now.

00:10:57.786 --> 00:11:00.656 A:middle
In order to do that, we
click this button right here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.786 --> 00:11:00.656 A:middle
In order to do that, we
click this button right here.

00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:05.446 A:middle
And this brings up a list
of our live leaderboards.

00:11:06.216 --> 00:11:08.366 A:middle
From here, let's say we want
to take a look at the scores

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:09.566 A:middle
in Level 1 High Score.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:11.286 A:middle
Click Manage.

00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:15.796 A:middle
And we have five
scores posted so far.

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:17.926 A:middle
Now, this first player,
we'll notice,

00:11:17.926 --> 00:11:20.956 A:middle
has a score of course
that's way too high

00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.286 A:middle
to be achievable in this game.

00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:24.796 A:middle
And not only is it
on this leaderboard,

00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:27.956 A:middle
but we've seen this player post
it across all our leaderboards,

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:29.966 A:middle
and even on other
games that we publish.

00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:32.706 A:middle
So what we'd like to do is --

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.966 A:middle
obviously, there's an
abuse of the system here,

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:36.256 A:middle
so we'd like to block
this player

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:38.926 A:middle
and clear all of his scores.

00:11:38.926 --> 00:11:43.746 A:middle
So, in order to do that, we
click Block, we confirm that,

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.496 A:middle
and now his score is gone
from this leaderboard

00:11:46.496 --> 00:11:48.096 A:middle
and all the leaderboards
in our game,

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.346 A:middle
and he can no longer
post any scores

00:11:50.946 --> 00:11:51.986 A:middle
to the leaderboards
in this game.

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:56.206 A:middle
Now, the second player,
who's now in the first spot,

00:11:56.606 --> 00:11:58.156 A:middle
also has a score
that's too high,

00:11:58.156 --> 00:12:00.346 A:middle
but this one's not his fault.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.156 --> 00:12:00.346 A:middle
but this one's not his fault.

00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:02.326 A:middle
This one's due to the
fact that we had a bug

00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:04.476 A:middle
in our game a few versions ago

00:12:04.476 --> 00:12:07.326 A:middle
that was having trouble
calculating scores properly and,

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.266 A:middle
you know, a few of the scores
slipped through and ended

00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:10.606 A:middle
up being posted to
the leaderboards.

00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:12.426 A:middle
So we'd like to clean
this one up.

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:14.316 A:middle
So what we'll do here is
we'll just click Remove

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.926 A:middle
and remove that one.

00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:20.726 A:middle
And that specifically
removes that score

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:24.926 A:middle
from this leaderboard, but this
player can continue posting

00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:26.746 A:middle
and playing this game as usual.

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:30.036 A:middle
And now we have a clean
leaderboard with fair scores,

00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:32.586 A:middle
and our players are happy
because now they can compete

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.646 A:middle
on the same playing field.

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:36.776 A:middle
And that's score management.

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:43.106 A:middle
So, we hope that you enjoy these
new features, and I'm going

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:43.886 A:middle
to hand it back to Dave.

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:45.256 A:middle
And thank you.

00:12:45.836 --> 00:12:48.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dave Van Tassell:
OK, thank you, Daniel.

00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:51.956 A:middle
So that was score and
leaderboard management.

00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:54.596 A:middle
Next, let's move
on to App Transfer.

00:12:54.956 --> 00:12:57.126 A:middle
So this is a story
many of you know.

00:12:57.356 --> 00:12:58.716 A:middle
You create your app.

00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
It's on the App Store.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
It's on the App Store.

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:03.726 A:middle
It's doing very well and now
you -- somebody wants to buy it.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.746 A:middle
So, how do you do that?

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.076 A:middle
Well, we thought this
was a good idea as well,

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:11.966 A:middle
so here's our blue button
from iTunes Connect.

00:13:11.966 --> 00:13:15.246 A:middle
What we did is we
managed to just push them

00:13:15.246 --> 00:13:17.026 A:middle
down a little bit, leaving
a little bit of space,

00:13:17.386 --> 00:13:19.466 A:middle
and then we put Transfer App.

00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:21.266 A:middle
But what does this actually do?

00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:23.566 A:middle
Basically, App Transfer
changes ownership

00:13:23.996 --> 00:13:25.466 A:middle
from one developer to another.

00:13:26.016 --> 00:13:28.766 A:middle
It's fairly -- it's
transparent for your user.

00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:31.896 A:middle
In fact, the customer
reviews and the ratings,

00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:33.826 A:middle
they actually go
with the ownership

00:13:33.826 --> 00:13:35.586 A:middle
of the app to the new owner.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:38.796 A:middle
The App Store has
very minimal changes.

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:40.776 A:middle
That developer name in that
upper left-hand corner,

00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:43.096 A:middle
hat will change,
as well as the URL,

00:13:43.096 --> 00:13:44.876 A:middle
support privacy marketing URLs.

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:49.386 A:middle
In Game Center, if you are
using cross-app compatibility,

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:51.876 A:middle
then we will move that
compatibility with other apps

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:52.936 A:middle
as part of the transfer.

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:56.816 A:middle
And if your app is grouped, then
it will be ungrouped and put

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:59.686 A:middle
in with the new owner as
a stand-alone game again.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.236 --> 00:14:03.556 A:middle
The app ID is also transferred.

00:14:03.716 --> 00:14:06.386 A:middle
And even though the app itself
transfers from one developer

00:14:06.386 --> 00:14:10.716 A:middle
to another, that 10-character
prefix, which is the team ID

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
of the original owner,
transfers with the app ID

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:13.546 A:middle
into your member center.

00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:16.906 A:middle
So, let's take a
look at the flow.

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:18.016 A:middle
You're the current owner.

00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.116 A:middle
You log into iTunes Connect.

00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:23.426 A:middle
You're going to give
us some new information

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:25.066 A:middle
about who the new owner
is so that we know

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:27.466 A:middle
who to transfer the app to.

00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:28.976 A:middle
At this point, you need
to sign a contract,

00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
and this is a good time to tell
you that it will be need --

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:32.926 A:middle
it will need to be the
team agent who does this,

00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:34.796 A:middle
as they will have the
rights to sign contracts.

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:40.036 A:middle
Once they do this, our app
is pending app transfer,

00:14:40.596 --> 00:14:43.096 A:middle
and the new owner will receive
an email letting him know this

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.266 A:middle
transfer process has started.

00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:47.316 A:middle
They too log into
iTunes Connect.

00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:50.736 A:middle
They enter in the required
metadata to be able

00:14:51.436 --> 00:14:53.346 A:middle
to transfer the app,
those URLs and so forth

00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:54.076 A:middle
that we were talking about.

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:57.716 A:middle
And, again, this same person
needs to be a team agent,

00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:00.456 A:middle
as they will need to sign an app
transfer contract on their end.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:00.456 A:middle
as they will need to sign an app
transfer contract on their end.

00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:04.186 A:middle
Once they do that, we begin
to process the app transfer.

00:15:05.366 --> 00:15:09.046 A:middle
Once we transfer this app from
provider to the next provider,

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:10.196 A:middle
off it goes to the new owner.

00:15:11.186 --> 00:15:14.026 A:middle
A couple of rules for
the current owner:

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:15.946 A:middle
You need to make sure all of
your contracts are up-to-date.

00:15:16.886 --> 00:15:18.346 A:middle
We've just released new
contracts this week;

00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:21.866 A:middle
I encourage you to go sign them
for this and for every reason

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:22.646 A:middle
to get your apps on the store.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:25.326 A:middle
You do need to have
approved app version.

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:27.696 A:middle
If your app has never been
approved, is not on the store,

00:15:27.696 --> 00:15:28.916 A:middle
there's no reason to go
through App Transfer.

00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:32.436 A:middle
And also, if you have any
updates that are in review,

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:35.046 A:middle
get them through the
review queue before you try

00:15:35.046 --> 00:15:35.656 A:middle
to transfer the app.

00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:39.976 A:middle
Same thing for In-App purchases;
if you have any In-App purchases

00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:42.086 A:middle
that are currently in
review, they need to be

00:15:42.346 --> 00:15:46.246 A:middle
through the review queue
before you transfer the app.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:47.216 A:middle
What you need to bring.

00:15:47.216 --> 00:15:49.966 A:middle
Like I said, you
need the Apple ID

00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:51.646 A:middle
of the recipient's team agent.

00:15:52.016 --> 00:15:55.336 A:middle
And you'll also need
the recipient's team ID,

00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:57.326 A:middle
which is that unique
ID that everybody has,

00:15:57.326 --> 00:15:58.516 A:middle
and you can find it
in the Member Center.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:03.216 A:middle
Once you transfer the
app, it will no longer be

00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:05.336 A:middle
in iTunes Connect, so any app
history that you want to get,

00:16:05.336 --> 00:16:08.296 A:middle
you need to download that
before you transfer the app.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.496 A:middle
If you want a new catalog
report with that information,

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:12.406 A:middle
do that before you
transfer the app.

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:16.176 A:middle
The source code and
binary is not handled

00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:17.496 A:middle
through the app transfer
process;

00:16:17.496 --> 00:16:18.806 A:middle
you need to make
special arrangements

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:24.136 A:middle
between the two developers
on how to do that.

00:16:25.646 --> 00:16:28.106 A:middle
Once the app transfer is
begun, you are allowed

00:16:28.106 --> 00:16:30.216 A:middle
to change the price of
your app, you're allowed

00:16:30.216 --> 00:16:32.036 A:middle
to change the price of
in-app purchases; however,

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:33.456 A:middle
the rest of the metadata
is locked down.

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:36.746 A:middle
And you have 60 days to
complete the transfer.

00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:41.276 A:middle
Either the new owner or the
current owner can cancel it

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:44.786 A:middle
at this time; however, after
60 days, if it hasn't finished,

00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:46.476 A:middle
then you'll have to
start all over again.

00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:51.056 A:middle
For the new owner,
what's their checklist?

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:53.076 A:middle
We need that new app metadata.

00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:57.336 A:middle
We also need to know who to
contact if we have questions

00:16:57.336 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
about the app: Name,
phone number, email,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.336 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
about the app: Name,
phone number, email,

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:01.446 A:middle
those fields you see
in iTunes Connect.

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:04.576 A:middle
If your app uses encryption

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:06.816 A:middle
and export compliance
documentation is required,

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:09.976 A:middle
you will need to have that
before you can sign the contract

00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:10.695 A:middle
that transfers the app.

00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:15.356 A:middle
At this point, once you've
signed your contract,

00:17:15.356 --> 00:17:18.175 A:middle
App Transfer has begun, it's
processing App Transfer,

00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:21.036 A:middle
the pricing is locked down,
and it cannot be canceled.

00:17:22.766 --> 00:17:24.526 A:middle
The app will begin to move
from the current owner

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:28.806 A:middle
over to the new owner,
and then it shows

00:17:28.806 --> 00:17:30.016 A:middle
up in the new owner's
iTunes Connect.

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:33.596 A:middle
You have a few steps to take.

00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:35.716 A:middle
If you are the new owner, once
this app has been transferred,

00:17:35.716 --> 00:17:37.126 A:middle
there's a couple things to do.

00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:40.146 A:middle
If the app makes use of Apple
Push Notification Service,

00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:42.316 A:middle
then you'll need to log
into your Member Center

00:17:42.826 --> 00:17:44.876 A:middle
and provision the newly
transferred app ID

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:45.846 A:middle
for the service.

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:49.966 A:middle
Also, if the app uses
Keychain, you need to discuss

00:17:49.966 --> 00:17:51.736 A:middle
with the previous owner
how they did that,

00:17:51.736 --> 00:17:54.356 A:middle
as when you update the app with
a new version, it won't be able

00:17:54.356 --> 00:17:57.576 A:middle
to access that same data.

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.486 A:middle
That is App Transfer.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.486 A:middle
That is App Transfer.

00:18:01.056 --> 00:18:03.096 A:middle
It's available today,
and we're very excited

00:18:03.096 --> 00:18:03.656 A:middle
to see how you use it.

00:18:03.656 --> 00:18:05.236 A:middle
[applause] Dave: With that,
I'm going to turn the time

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.286 A:middle
over to Nick Oogloff
[phonetic] to talk

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.876 A:middle
about our automation
enhancements.

00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:10.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Nik: I'm Nik Uglov,
Engineering Manager,

00:18:11.316 --> 00:18:13.606 A:middle
iTunes Store, Content
Management.

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:15.326 A:middle
As Dave said, I'm going to talk

00:18:15.326 --> 00:18:20.106 A:middle
about command line
automation with Transporter.

00:18:21.346 --> 00:18:22.676 A:middle
Well, what is it?

00:18:23.146 --> 00:18:23.846 A:middle
What's in it for you?

00:18:23.846 --> 00:18:24.676 A:middle
Why should you care?

00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:27.786 A:middle
With command line
automation with Transporter,

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:32.936 A:middle
you will be able to address your
most repetitive interactions

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:35.296 A:middle
with iTunes Connect
without having

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:36.346 A:middle
to go through the web GUI.

00:18:36.346 --> 00:18:39.826 A:middle
You will be able to
manage your data in bulk,

00:18:39.826 --> 00:18:43.646 A:middle
and you can integrate
that management --

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:45.446 A:middle
you can integrate
iTunes Connect --

00:18:45.446 --> 00:18:47.526 A:middle
with your backend content
management systems,

00:18:48.256 --> 00:18:49.366 A:middle
whatever those may be.

00:18:50.476 --> 00:18:54.206 A:middle
Ultimately, it's
about being efficient

00:18:54.206 --> 00:18:55.966 A:middle
in publishing your
app on the store.

00:18:56.326 --> 00:19:00.316 A:middle
And the time savings that you
gain, you'll be able to reinvest

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:56.326 --> 00:19:00.316 A:middle
And the time savings that you
gain, you'll be able to reinvest

00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:03.136 A:middle
into making your
apps even better.

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:07.166 A:middle
So, I'm going to introduce
a command line tool called

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:10.176 A:middle
Transporter, which
manages the interaction

00:19:10.176 --> 00:19:12.676 A:middle
between your environment
and iTunes Connect.

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:16.406 A:middle
And it does that by using
an app metadata XML feed.

00:19:17.476 --> 00:19:21.156 A:middle
The feed covers the areas of
version level localization,

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:25.346 A:middle
rights and pricing for your
app, the in-app purchases

00:19:25.676 --> 00:19:27.546 A:middle
and Game Center achievements
and leaderboards.

00:19:27.656 --> 00:19:30.616 A:middle
Through Transporter, you can
also get your catalog reports

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:32.116 A:middle
on a command line.

00:19:32.876 --> 00:19:36.166 A:middle
So, let's start by reviewing
how you currently edit this data

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:36.926 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:19:37.336 --> 00:19:40.056 A:middle
This is the screen that
you usually go to for this,

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:44.296 A:middle
and there are seven fields
to fill in, and there are

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:46.426 A:middle
up to five screenshots
per device type

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:47.976 A:middle
that you support to supply.

00:19:47.976 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
It certainly pays to
supply multiple screenshots

00:19:50.946 --> 00:19:53.236 A:middle
to show your app in the
most advantageous light.

00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:59.486 A:middle
Also, the stores available
in up to 28 languages,

00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:02.096 A:middle
so in order to appeal
most effectively

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:02.096 A:middle
so in order to appeal
most effectively

00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:05.286 A:middle
to your customers worldwide, it
pays to provide that information

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:06.776 A:middle
in the language that
they can understand.

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:09.806 A:middle
So, there are up to 28
screens like that to fill in.

00:20:09.996 --> 00:20:13.516 A:middle
And a lot of you have
multiple apps to maintain,

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:17.456 A:middle
which is wonderful, but
it increases your burden

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:21.596 A:middle
in providing all that data.

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:24.806 A:middle
The GUI as it stands is
fine for a few items.

00:20:24.896 --> 00:20:27.846 A:middle
In fact, that's the most
efficient way to fill

00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:30.426 A:middle
in this information if all
you are doing is changing a

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.946 A:middle
description here and
there, adding a screenshot.

00:20:34.146 --> 00:20:38.046 A:middle
But as you scale up to multiple
localizations and multiple apps,

00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:42.346 A:middle
this gets burdensome, and
it could be error-prone,

00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:44.736 A:middle
because you're probably
copying this data --

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:47.276 A:middle
copy-pasting it from some
document somebody put together.

00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:49.846 A:middle
You probably don't know
all of the 28 languages.

00:20:49.846 --> 00:20:52.256 A:middle
Some of you maybe do,
but probably not all.

00:20:53.256 --> 00:20:55.646 A:middle
So, you could make a
mistake in this copy-paste.

00:20:55.886 --> 00:20:58.346 A:middle
And ultimately, you can't
automate this process,

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:01.716 A:middle
because you can't script
the Web GUI effectively.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:01.716 A:middle
because you can't script
the Web GUI effectively.

00:21:04.016 --> 00:21:06.236 A:middle
You've been telling us about
it; you've been filing a lot

00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:08.186 A:middle
of bug reports, and we
certainly read them.

00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:14.476 A:middle
In fact, last year, we
introduced an XML feed

00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:16.356 A:middle
that covers a portion
of that interaction.

00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:19.166 A:middle
It covers the areas
of In-App purchases,

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:22.686 A:middle
Game Center leaderboards,
and Game Center achievements.

00:21:23.036 --> 00:21:25.956 A:middle
Well, today, today
we're introducing --

00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:27.876 A:middle
we're building on top
of that foundation

00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:30.926 A:middle
and introducing support for
version-level localization

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:34.446 A:middle
in a version section,
pricing and availability,

00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:38.466 A:middle
and in the in-app purchase
area, we're also allowing you

00:21:38.466 --> 00:21:42.866 A:middle
to upload the hosted content
packages that you can produce

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:46.596 A:middle
with Xcode, through the feed.

00:21:46.816 --> 00:21:47.856 A:middle
Let's review the features.

00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:49.326 A:middle
What's available there?

00:21:50.696 --> 00:21:52.656 A:middle
Well, first and foremost
there is Transporter,

00:21:52.726 --> 00:21:55.566 A:middle
which is a command-line tool
for managing this interaction.

00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:59.386 A:middle
And the first thing you
do with it is you look

00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
up the current state, the
current metadata for your app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
up the current state, the
current metadata for your app.

00:22:02.876 --> 00:22:05.226 A:middle
When you do that, it gets
downloaded as a package,

00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:08.396 A:middle
which is really just a fancy
name for a directory named

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:11.296 A:middle
after the app's SKU
with a .itmsp extension.

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:15.296 A:middle
You crack it open -- crack
that directory open --

00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:18.696 A:middle
and what you find in there is
a file called metadata.xml,

00:22:18.986 --> 00:22:21.856 A:middle
and that encapsulates
current state of your data

00:22:21.856 --> 00:22:23.696 A:middle
in iTunes Connect,
the data for your app.

00:22:24.726 --> 00:22:26.836 A:middle
This is the file
that you need to edit

00:22:26.836 --> 00:22:29.206 A:middle
to make changes to your app.

00:22:30.126 --> 00:22:33.426 A:middle
You edit it to your heart's
content, and then any assets

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:37.346 A:middle
that need to go with it, let's
say screenshots, you park them

00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:39.556 A:middle
in the same directory, right
next to that metadata.xml.

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.176 A:middle
You build up the
package this way,

00:22:43.036 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
and then you can validate it.

00:22:45.946 --> 00:22:48.966 A:middle
Validation, as a
separate action,

00:22:48.966 --> 00:22:51.266 A:middle
is optional because you could
just go ahead and upload it,

00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:55.196 A:middle
and the validation will also
be performed when you do that.

00:22:55.406 --> 00:23:00.346 A:middle
This is the lifecycle, the flow
overall: download the package;

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:55.406 --> 00:23:00.346 A:middle
This is the lifecycle, the flow
overall: download the package;

00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:05.706 A:middle
modify XML; add screenshots and
other assets; do the validation,

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.506 A:middle
either by itself or as
a part of the upload;

00:23:07.506 --> 00:23:10.966 A:middle
if there are any errors, you
address them by editing XML

00:23:10.966 --> 00:23:12.866 A:middle
and changing the
assets as needed;

00:23:12.866 --> 00:23:14.686 A:middle
and ultimately you
upload the package.

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:17.326 A:middle
It gets to iTunes Connect,
and you have your data there.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:22.226 A:middle
Here's the first
command you need to know:

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:25.696 A:middle
Transporter with a
method "lookup metadata".

00:23:26.376 --> 00:23:30.406 A:middle
You provide your iTunes Connect
username and the vendor ID

00:23:30.406 --> 00:23:32.136 A:middle
for your app, which
is your app's SKU.

00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:35.246 A:middle
That's the same thing:
App's SKU is the vendor ID.

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:38.166 A:middle
You provide the local
destination folder where you'd

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
like the package to end
up, and what happens,

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:48.076 A:middle
it gets downloaded
locally as a package named

00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:50.286 A:middle
after the app's SKU
with a .itmsp extension.

00:23:50.866 --> 00:23:52.726 A:middle
And the reason you want
to go with this first,

00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:54.846 A:middle
the reason to do the
lookup and not the upload is

00:23:55.276 --> 00:23:58.006 A:middle
so that you wouldn't have to
come up with this big XML file

00:23:58.006 --> 00:24:00.166 A:middle
with everything about your
app in there, from scratch.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.006 --> 00:24:00.166 A:middle
with everything about your
app in there, from scratch.

00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:03.556 A:middle
You could use this as a skeleton
to bootstrap your automation.

00:24:04.606 --> 00:24:05.506 A:middle
It's a lot easier this way.

00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:09.546 A:middle
Next up is validation
with Transporter.

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:13.886 A:middle
Use the "verify" method, supply
your iTunes Connect username

00:24:14.346 --> 00:24:16.816 A:middle
and the name of the package
that you're validating.

00:24:17.336 --> 00:24:21.776 A:middle
What happens then is we validate
both the metadata and the assets

00:24:22.006 --> 00:24:23.816 A:middle
that you're providing,

00:24:24.306 --> 00:24:26.716 A:middle
and we validate them using the
same rules that are applied

00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:28.566 A:middle
in iTunes Connect,
same conditions.

00:24:29.346 --> 00:24:31.216 A:middle
If there are any errors
during that process,

00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:34.036 A:middle
you get them reported to
you on a command line.

00:24:34.036 --> 00:24:34.876 A:middle
Here's an example.

00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:38.826 A:middle
"No software found with
vendor ID 'bogus'."

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:42.426 A:middle
Well, not surprising, given
the vendor ID I chose.

00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:45.026 A:middle
What is it that we validate?

00:24:45.186 --> 00:24:47.796 A:middle
Well, quite a lot; there's
a lot of validations.

00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:50.456 A:middle
I wouldn't be able to go through
all of them here in the session,

00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:53.226 A:middle
but you can take a look in the
documentation, which I'll point

00:24:53.226 --> 00:24:55.366 A:middle
out to you in a few minutes.

00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:57.426 A:middle
But to kind of give
you a flavor:

00:24:57.426 --> 00:24:59.966 A:middle
you have to identify your
app properly by the SKU;

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.676 --> 00:25:02.776 A:middle
the version needs to be
in an editable state --

00:25:02.776 --> 00:25:05.836 A:middle
if it's currently in
review, you can't modify it,

00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:09.556 A:middle
same goes for in-app
purchases; the screenshots need

00:25:09.556 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
to be appropriate dimensions --

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:12.496 A:middle
the same ones that
iTunes Connect requires.

00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:18.236 A:middle
Next up, Transporter
"upload" method.

00:25:18.616 --> 00:25:21.116 A:middle
That's the one that actually
sends the data to us.

00:25:21.966 --> 00:25:26.326 A:middle
You supply your iTunes Connect
user ID, supply the name

00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:28.326 A:middle
of the package to upload.

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:33.066 A:middle
What happens here is the same
validation is performed that's

00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:36.066 A:middle
in the verification step,
and the same, ultimately,

00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:37.756 A:middle
rules as in iTunes Connect.

00:25:38.786 --> 00:25:40.876 A:middle
If there are any
errors, they are reported

00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:41.806 A:middle
to you on the command line.

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:43.856 A:middle
If everything went fine,

00:25:44.706 --> 00:25:47.306 A:middle
what happens is the
package gets uploaded to us,

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:50.896 A:middle
and it enters an asynchronous
processing queue that's shared

00:25:50.896 --> 00:25:53.266 A:middle
between all the content
that we process.

00:25:54.056 --> 00:25:58.846 A:middle
That would be music, movies,
and books, and other software.

00:25:59.686 --> 00:26:01.416 A:middle
You could expect there
to be a few minutes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.686 --> 00:26:01.416 A:middle
You could expect there
to be a few minutes

00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:04.636 A:middle
of delay before your data
is actually reflected

00:26:04.636 --> 00:26:05.376 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:09.386 A:middle
There is actually another
mode in Transporter

00:26:09.386 --> 00:26:11.156 A:middle
that would let you
look up the status

00:26:11.156 --> 00:26:12.696 A:middle
of your most recent
upload; you can take a look

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:13.686 A:middle
at that in documentation.

00:26:14.226 --> 00:26:19.016 A:middle
A few other details
before I move on.

00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:24.696 A:middle
The app and the version need to
already exist in iTunes Connect.

00:26:25.386 --> 00:26:27.366 A:middle
You set them up in iTunes
Connect as you do now,

00:26:27.366 --> 00:26:29.086 A:middle
sort of in a skeletal
shape, if you will,

00:26:29.636 --> 00:26:32.446 A:middle
and then you can use the
feed to populate them

00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:33.586 A:middle
with all the rich information.

00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:37.746 A:middle
All the state transitions are
managed in iTunes Connect:

00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:40.256 A:middle
let's say if you're
moving the app to ready

00:26:40.256 --> 00:26:41.246 A:middle
to upload the binary,

00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:48.706 A:middle
or submitting the in-app
purchases for a review.

00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:50.896 A:middle
When you're ready to upload
that binary, you still do

00:26:50.896 --> 00:26:53.956 A:middle
that with Xcode or Application
Loader, no changes there.

00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:57.036 A:middle
And the feed is available

00:26:57.036 --> 00:26:59.866 A:middle
for both iOS apps
and Mac apps equally.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:04.376 A:middle
I mentioned documentation
a little earlier.

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:06.816 A:middle
This is where you'll find
it: on iTunes Connect

00:27:06.816 --> 00:27:09.966 A:middle
in Manage Your Apps
screen on the bottom.

00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:12.266 A:middle
There are two pieces of
information you need:

00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:13.846 A:middle
the Transporter User Guide,

00:27:13.846 --> 00:27:16.486 A:middle
which lists all the commands
I'm going to go through today

00:27:16.486 --> 00:27:19.666 A:middle
in a lot more detail,
and there's more of them.

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:23.326 A:middle
And the App Metadata XML
specification, which that's

00:27:23.326 --> 00:27:24.856 A:middle
where all of the tags are listed

00:27:24.856 --> 00:27:26.626 A:middle
with all the requirements
that apply to them.

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:33.746 A:middle
This was a general introduction
to Transporter and an overview

00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:35.496 A:middle
of the app metadata XML feed.

00:27:36.646 --> 00:27:38.376 A:middle
Well, what does the XML
feed actually look like?

00:27:38.376 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
What do you see there?

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:42.796 A:middle
It looks something like this.

00:27:43.006 --> 00:27:45.596 A:middle
You have the required
elements that kind

00:27:45.596 --> 00:27:46.656 A:middle
of wrap everything else.

00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:51.946 A:middle
And what you have there is you
have a package for your account,

00:27:52.006 --> 00:27:53.676 A:middle
which is identified by team ID.

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.566 A:middle
The package contains software.

00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:59.396 A:middle
The software is for the specific
app, identified by vendor ID,

00:27:59.396 --> 00:28:00.306 A:middle
which is the app's SKU.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.396 --> 00:28:00.306 A:middle
which is the app's SKU.

00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:04.276 A:middle
And within it the metadata.

00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:05.736 A:middle
Those are required elements.

00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:08.056 A:middle
The rest of the stuff here,

00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:10.116 A:middle
the rest of the sections,
are optional.

00:28:11.276 --> 00:28:14.036 A:middle
Well, what exactly
do I mean by that?

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:17.336 A:middle
What I mean is that if
you're not making changes

00:28:17.336 --> 00:28:19.816 A:middle
to some component there,
you could omit that.

00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:22.306 A:middle
If you're not making
changes in Game Center,

00:28:22.306 --> 00:28:23.416 A:middle
you can omit the entire section.

00:28:23.416 --> 00:28:26.626 A:middle
Not making changes In-App
purchases, omit that.

00:28:27.696 --> 00:28:30.196 A:middle
I don't mean that
you must omit it.

00:28:30.446 --> 00:28:34.506 A:middle
If you just did a metadata
lookup, made a few changes,

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.996 A:middle
you could just re-upload
the package as-is,

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:39.226 A:middle
and if there are no changes
in certain sections, well,

00:28:39.226 --> 00:28:40.746 A:middle
no changes will occur
in iTunes Connect.

00:28:41.066 --> 00:28:43.506 A:middle
All I'm saying is it's
optional to include the sections

00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.326 A:middle
that don't have any changes.

00:28:45.806 --> 00:28:49.446 A:middle
Let's dive in.

00:28:49.816 --> 00:28:54.936 A:middle
First thing in the package is
you need to specify your account

00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:58.266 A:middle
by team ID, which is a value
that's been provided previously

00:28:58.266 --> 00:28:58.866 A:middle
to you by Apple.

00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:02.596 A:middle
And in the software section,
you have to identify,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:02.596 A:middle
And in the software section,
you have to identify,

00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:03.736 A:middle
well, what app is it for?

00:29:03.736 --> 00:29:05.596 A:middle
And that's done by
the vendor ID,

00:29:05.596 --> 00:29:07.396 A:middle
which is the same
as the app's SKU.

00:29:07.736 --> 00:29:09.186 A:middle
That's exactly the same value.

00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:13.076 A:middle
Diving in, into the
software metadata section,

00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:17.396 A:middle
what you'll find there is
the versions for your app.

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:18.876 A:middle
And just like in iTunes Connect,

00:29:18.876 --> 00:29:22.226 A:middle
there are up two versions
that you can address.

00:29:22.226 --> 00:29:27.046 A:middle
The current one; in this example
1.5, identified in the feed

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:28.386 A:middle
as version string 1.5.

00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:31.996 A:middle
And if you have a new one
that you're building up,

00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:36.366 A:middle
getting ready, then
that's available as well,

00:29:36.366 --> 00:29:42.156 A:middle
version 2.0 in this example,
with version string 2.0.

00:29:42.346 --> 00:29:47.256 A:middle
Diving into the version element,
you'll finally see the locales,

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:49.396 A:middle
which are all the
localizations for your app.

00:29:49.396 --> 00:29:53.396 A:middle
In iTunes Connect, you do
that by using this pull-down

00:29:53.396 --> 00:29:55.516 A:middle
to identify the language:
English,

00:29:55.516 --> 00:29:56.946 A:middle
U.S. English to be precise here.

00:29:57.626 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
In the feed, that's
locale element

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.626 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
In the feed, that's
locale element

00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:04.306 A:middle
with the language
identified by name en-US,

00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:07.286 A:middle
and that's a BCP
47 language tag.

00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:13.016 A:middle
BCP 47 is a very wide format
for referring to a language.

00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:16.546 A:middle
You can refer to any language
spoken on this planet this way.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:20.486 A:middle
But the store is only
available in 28 languages,

00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:23.816 A:middle
so to see the list of the ones
that are actually valid here,

00:30:23.816 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
please take a look
at the documentation.

00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:29.336 A:middle
Let's dive in further
down into the locale,

00:30:29.336 --> 00:30:33.826 A:middle
and what you see there is
finally these fields addressed

00:30:33.826 --> 00:30:37.246 A:middle
that you normally edit
in iTunes Connect.

00:30:37.246 --> 00:30:38.056 A:middle
"Name" is the title.

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:40.546 A:middle
"Description" is
the description.

00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:45.206 A:middle
And "What's new in this version"
is "version what's new".

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:49.106 A:middle
Keywords are comma
delimited in iTunes Connect;

00:30:49.106 --> 00:30:51.066 A:middle
in the feed they're
separate elements.

00:30:51.846 --> 00:30:54.726 A:middle
And URLs: three of
them in iTunes Connect;

00:30:54.726 --> 00:30:57.756 A:middle
three of them in the feed.

00:30:57.846 --> 00:30:58.506 A:middle
Screenshots.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:03.306 A:middle
Well, screenshots are just
a bit more complicated

00:31:03.306 --> 00:31:06.896 A:middle
because you have to refer to
both the type of the device

00:31:06.896 --> 00:31:08.786 A:middle
that the screenshot is
for and its position

00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:10.896 A:middle
in iTunes Connect and,
ultimately, in the store.

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:17.066 A:middle
Positions go 1 through 5 because
there's up to five per device.

00:31:18.016 --> 00:31:21.396 A:middle
For 4-inch iPhone, I have
display target iOS 4-inch

00:31:22.016 --> 00:31:26.006 A:middle
in Position 1; and,
for example for iPad,

00:31:26.006 --> 00:31:28.856 A:middle
here it is - iOS
iPad Position 1.

00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.296 A:middle
Postions go 1 through 5.

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:33.526 A:middle
Well, there's one
more thing to note

00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:37.456 A:middle
in the software screenshot
section, with regards

00:31:37.456 --> 00:31:39.616 A:middle
to the requirements
for the elements.

00:31:40.326 --> 00:31:43.146 A:middle
I said earlier that you
could omit the sections

00:31:43.646 --> 00:31:45.486 A:middle
that you're not making
any changes to.

00:31:45.786 --> 00:31:46.766 A:middle
And that's true.

00:31:46.966 --> 00:31:49.106 A:middle
You can omit the entire
software screenshot section

00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:50.446 A:middle
if there are no changes in it.

00:31:50.896 --> 00:31:53.916 A:middle
However, if there are
changes in the section --

00:31:54.136 --> 00:31:55.486 A:middle
let's say you're
adding a screenshot,

00:31:55.486 --> 00:31:57.916 A:middle
you're moving them about,
or you're deleting one --

00:31:58.686 --> 00:32:00.286 A:middle
please supply the
entire section.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.686 --> 00:32:00.286 A:middle
please supply the
entire section.

00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:02.676 A:middle
Here's why.

00:32:03.796 --> 00:32:05.956 A:middle
If you omit a screenshot

00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:08.026 A:middle
within the software screenshots
section, that's your signal

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.496 A:middle
to us that we should remove it.

00:32:09.956 --> 00:32:12.886 A:middle
So please state the
entire section

00:32:12.886 --> 00:32:14.276 A:middle
if you make any changes
in there.

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:17.916 A:middle
That doesn't mean that
you'll actually end

00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:21.116 A:middle
up uploading the screenshot
file over and over again,

00:32:21.116 --> 00:32:23.726 A:middle
and that's because for
each screenshot file,

00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:27.966 A:middle
you have to supply the
size in bytes, the filename

00:32:27.966 --> 00:32:29.866 A:middle
of course, and the checksum.

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:33.776 A:middle
If the size and the
checksum match what we have

00:32:34.406 --> 00:32:37.676 A:middle
for this device type,
in this position,

00:32:38.006 --> 00:32:39.566 A:middle
Transporter will skip the upload

00:32:39.566 --> 00:32:43.936 A:middle
because we already have the
file; we don't need it again.

00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:45.786 A:middle
So, version level
localization tags.

00:32:46.896 --> 00:32:49.636 A:middle
Let's take a look at the rights
and pricing for your app.

00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:52.646 A:middle
In iTunes Connect, that's under
Rights and Pricing button.

00:32:52.646 --> 00:32:56.276 A:middle
And in the feed, that's
in the Products Section.

00:32:57.426 --> 00:33:01.826 A:middle
What you'll see there
corresponds to iTunes Connect,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.426 --> 00:33:01.826 A:middle
What you'll see there
corresponds to iTunes Connect,

00:33:01.826 --> 00:33:06.606 A:middle
in that most of the settings are
applicable worldwide, globally.

00:33:07.056 --> 00:33:08.246 A:middle
So let's go through those first.

00:33:08.956 --> 00:33:12.126 A:middle
You identify the global
applicability of those settings

00:33:12.126 --> 00:33:14.636 A:middle
by using the Product element
for Territory Worldwide.

00:33:14.636 --> 00:33:15.946 A:middle
That's here.

00:33:16.526 --> 00:33:20.396 A:middle
Then what goes in there is
first the availability date

00:33:20.396 --> 00:33:24.116 A:middle
for your app, which is sales
start date; if you have discount

00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.276 A:middle
for education institutions,

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:27.006 A:middle
that's under Allow
Volume Discount,

00:33:27.006 --> 00:33:28.186 A:middle
true or false, a Boolean value.

00:33:29.436 --> 00:33:31.836 A:middle
Also, on the global level,

00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:37.576 A:middle
you have the pricing
information for your app.

00:33:37.576 --> 00:33:39.786 A:middle
In iTunes Connect, that's
a pull-down for price tier;

00:33:40.396 --> 00:33:42.436 A:middle
in the feed, that's
wholesale price tier.

00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:44.136 A:middle
I have it as 3 in this example.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:48.596 A:middle
The tiers actually apply in
intervals that let you set

00:33:48.596 --> 00:33:50.436 A:middle
up sales windows ahead of time.

00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:52.276 A:middle
Here I have the interval
section,

00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:57.156 A:middle
and this interval starts
on the start date there;

00:33:57.156 --> 00:34:00.466 A:middle
same concept as in
iTunes Connect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.156 --> 00:34:00.466 A:middle
same concept as in
iTunes Connect.

00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:02.646 A:middle
And the tier end
date is End Date.

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:07.106 A:middle
What this corresponds to in
iTunes Connect is the ability

00:34:07.106 --> 00:34:09.786 A:middle
to set up the schedule
for the changes

00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.126 A:middle
of the prices ahead of time.

00:34:11.565 --> 00:34:15.246 A:middle
So, for example, I have an
app that's normally at Tier 3,

00:34:15.476 --> 00:34:18.626 A:middle
but for the duration of this
conference, it goes on sale

00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:20.746 A:middle
down to Tier 1, and
then comes back to 3

00:34:20.746 --> 00:34:22.076 A:middle
after the end of the conference.

00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:24.996 A:middle
Now you could do the same
in a feed, of course.

00:34:25.896 --> 00:34:26.406 A:middle
This is how.

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:29.826 A:middle
In the Intervals element,
first interval goes

00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:33.436 A:middle
until June 10, at Price Tier 3.

00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:37.446 A:middle
Then it goes on sale for the
duration of the conference

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:41.766 A:middle
down to Tier 1 and then
comes back up to Tier 3.

00:34:42.556 --> 00:34:44.315 A:middle
Notice no end date, which means

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.976 A:middle
that this is the tier that's
effective in perpetuity,

00:34:46.976 --> 00:34:48.666 A:middle
until you decide to change it.

00:34:49.536 --> 00:34:53.216 A:middle
These are all the globally
applicable elements.

00:34:53.696 --> 00:34:55.866 A:middle
What could you do on
a per-territory basis?

00:34:56.366 --> 00:34:57.736 A:middle
Well, what you get
to do there is

00:34:57.736 --> 00:35:00.006 A:middle
to state whether your app is
available for sale there or not,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.736 --> 00:35:00.006 A:middle
to state whether your app is
available for sale there or not,

00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:01.756 A:middle
and there are two
ways to go about it:

00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:04.446 A:middle
by exclusion or by inclusion.

00:35:05.206 --> 00:35:08.216 A:middle
The exclusion principle
goes like this.

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:10.436 A:middle
You start by saying that
your app is available

00:35:10.436 --> 00:35:14.886 A:middle
for sale everywhere: territory
WW; cleared for sale, true.

00:35:15.226 --> 00:35:18.086 A:middle
And then you enumerate
through the product sections,

00:35:19.476 --> 00:35:22.046 A:middle
stating the territories where
it should not be available.

00:35:22.046 --> 00:35:24.376 A:middle
So here's an example of
the app not being available

00:35:24.376 --> 00:35:25.146 A:middle
for sale in Japan.

00:35:25.476 --> 00:35:27.866 A:middle
If you go with the
exclusion principle

00:35:27.866 --> 00:35:32.176 A:middle
and Apple opens app stores
in additional territories,

00:35:32.176 --> 00:35:34.396 A:middle
your app will automatically go
on sale there; nothing you need

00:35:34.396 --> 00:35:35.896 A:middle
to do for that, because, well,

00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:37.186 A:middle
it's not excluded
from sale there.

00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:41.136 A:middle
The inclusion principle
is the exact opposite.

00:35:41.516 --> 00:35:43.706 A:middle
You start by saying that
your app is not available

00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:46.946 A:middle
for sale anywhere: cleared
for sale is false for WW.

00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:50.246 A:middle
And then you enumerate
the Product blocks,

00:35:50.346 --> 00:35:52.176 A:middle
stating which territories
the apps should be available

00:35:52.176 --> 00:35:52.886 A:middle
for sale in.

00:35:52.886 --> 00:35:55.106 A:middle
Here's the example of
the app being available

00:35:55.106 --> 00:35:56.086 A:middle
for sale in Japan only.

00:35:56.656 --> 00:36:00.346 A:middle
So, two ways of going about
that territory settings.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.656 --> 00:36:00.346 A:middle
So, two ways of going about
that territory settings.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.496 A:middle
So, these were rights
and pricing for your app.

00:36:03.496 --> 00:36:06.546 A:middle
I'm going to briefly talk
over In-App purchases

00:36:06.546 --> 00:36:07.666 A:middle
and Game Center in the feed.

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:10.626 A:middle
Briefly, because those
features have been available

00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:11.406 A:middle
since last year.

00:36:12.716 --> 00:36:14.926 A:middle
In-App purchases in
iTunes Connect are

00:36:14.926 --> 00:36:18.096 A:middle
under Manage In-App
Purchases button, of course,

00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:19.036 A:middle
and in the feed they are

00:36:19.036 --> 00:36:22.306 A:middle
under In-App Purchases
section, which is fairly deep.

00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:24.356 A:middle
There's a lot of detail in
there, please take a look

00:36:24.356 --> 00:36:26.216 A:middle
at that documentation
for what's available.

00:36:26.216 --> 00:36:30.346 A:middle
What we are adding here
today is the ability

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:34.786 A:middle
to submit hosted content
packages that you can create

00:36:34.786 --> 00:36:37.476 A:middle
with Xcode, but now you can
submit them through the feed;

00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:37.956 A:middle
you would have had

00:36:37.956 --> 00:36:41.736 A:middle
to use Application Loader
for that previously.

00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:45.326 A:middle
To remind what that is, if
your In-App purchase happens

00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:48.876 A:middle
to be a non-consumable,
such as say a map or a level

00:36:48.876 --> 00:36:50.836 A:middle
for the game, and if
you would like Apple

00:36:50.836 --> 00:36:54.216 A:middle
to actually host the content
for it, you produce that package

00:36:54.366 --> 00:36:57.546 A:middle
in Xcode, and then you
can indicate in the feed

00:36:57.546 --> 00:37:00.596 A:middle
that you would like Apple
to host it and provide it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:57.546 --> 00:37:00.596 A:middle
that you would like Apple
to host it and provide it

00:37:00.596 --> 00:37:06.526 A:middle
as an asset in the
package when you upload.

00:37:06.526 --> 00:37:09.286 A:middle
Game Center in the feed works
the same way it's been working

00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:10.276 A:middle
since last year.

00:37:10.726 --> 00:37:13.436 A:middle
In iTunes Connect, that's
under Manage Game Center.

00:37:13.436 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
In feed, that's Game Center
section with the subsections

00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:18.706 A:middle
of Achievements and
Leaderboards,

00:37:18.706 --> 00:37:20.576 A:middle
and each of those
is fairly deep.

00:37:20.756 --> 00:37:22.606 A:middle
Please take a look at
documentation for details.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.396 A:middle
These were the In-App purchases
and Game Center, and this kind

00:37:28.396 --> 00:37:30.486 A:middle
of wraps up the metadata
portion.

00:37:30.486 --> 00:37:33.436 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier,

00:37:33.436 --> 00:37:37.396 A:middle
Transporter could also
obtain catalog reports

00:37:37.396 --> 00:37:38.756 A:middle
for you on a command line.

00:37:40.046 --> 00:37:42.606 A:middle
If you haven't used
catalog reports,

00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:46.996 A:middle
these are tab-delimited,
downloadable reports

00:37:46.996 --> 00:37:50.236 A:middle
that give you a sweeping
overview of the data

00:37:50.236 --> 00:37:54.706 A:middle
that you have in iTunes
Connect for your apps,

00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:58.286 A:middle
the in-app purchases, or
recently added reports

00:37:58.286 --> 00:37:59.586 A:middle
for leaderboards
and achievements.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.426 --> 00:38:01.536 A:middle
You select which ones you want,

00:38:01.776 --> 00:38:06.446 A:middle
you click the Request New
Reports, and you'll get an email

00:38:06.446 --> 00:38:08.086 A:middle
when the report is
available for download.

00:38:08.346 --> 00:38:09.586 A:middle
You could do that
up to once a day.

00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:12.766 A:middle
Well, the same capability
is now present

00:38:13.606 --> 00:38:15.576 A:middle
through on a command line.

00:38:15.696 --> 00:38:18.606 A:middle
There are two modes;
for requesting reports

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:20.136 A:middle
and for checking
on their status.

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:24.806 A:middle
You would use the Request
Reports method in Transporter:

00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:28.856 A:middle
supply the iTunes Connect
username, the type of reports --

00:38:28.856 --> 00:38:30.646 A:middle
in this case, I'm
asking for all of them,

00:38:30.646 --> 00:38:32.436 A:middle
or you could specify
one of the four --

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:34.326 A:middle
and then the location of
a local destination folder

00:38:34.326 --> 00:38:34.996 A:middle
where you'd like it.

00:38:35.416 --> 00:38:36.586 A:middle
And two things might happen.

00:38:37.016 --> 00:38:38.796 A:middle
If the reports are
already ready for download,

00:38:38.796 --> 00:38:41.516 A:middle
you would just get them right
away in the reports folder.

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:45.156 A:middle
If they haven't been
asked for yet today,

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:46.726 A:middle
you'll get a message saying

00:38:46.726 --> 00:38:48.956 A:middle
that they will be
made available soon,

00:38:48.956 --> 00:38:50.616 A:middle
and you'll get an
email when they are.

00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:52.296 A:middle
But you don't have to
wait for that email,

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.636 A:middle
because you could
check on the status

00:38:53.636 --> 00:38:57.756 A:middle
of previously issued requests
through the list reports method,

00:38:57.846 --> 00:39:01.756 A:middle
and you get a status
output for each report type

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.846 --> 00:39:01.756 A:middle
and you get a status
output for each report type

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:02.706 A:middle
that you've requested.

00:39:05.006 --> 00:39:09.346 A:middle
So, these were catalog
reports through Transporter.

00:39:13.156 --> 00:39:15.746 A:middle
Well, now, now's your turn.

00:39:16.686 --> 00:39:20.726 A:middle
It's your turn because these
features are available now.

00:39:20.726 --> 00:39:21.786 A:middle
They're out there;
you can use them.

00:39:21.786 --> 00:39:24.966 A:middle
You have Transporter, which
manages the interaction

00:39:24.966 --> 00:39:26.806 A:middle
between your environment
and iTunes Connect.

00:39:26.806 --> 00:39:31.326 A:middle
You have app metadata XML feed
for version level localization,

00:39:31.326 --> 00:39:35.376 A:middle
rights and pricing for
your app, in-app purchases,

00:39:35.586 --> 00:39:38.666 A:middle
and Game Center, and you
can also get catalog reports

00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:39.406 A:middle
through Transporter.

00:39:40.806 --> 00:39:45.366 A:middle
What I'd like you to do today,
a little later, tomorrow,

00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:49.226 A:middle
is download documentation
that we have on iTunes Connect

00:39:49.226 --> 00:39:50.476 A:middle
on the Manage Your Apps screen.

00:39:50.696 --> 00:39:52.276 A:middle
You need two pieces
of information:

00:39:52.816 --> 00:39:55.016 A:middle
"Transporter User Guide," that
goes through all the commands

00:39:55.016 --> 00:39:58.006 A:middle
that we went through today --
and there's actually a lot more,

00:39:58.006 --> 00:39:59.406 A:middle
and certainly a lot
more options for them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.286 --> 00:40:02.556 A:middle
And the "App Metadata
Specification," which goes

00:40:02.556 --> 00:40:04.506 A:middle
into minute detail
for all the tags

00:40:04.506 --> 00:40:08.226 A:middle
and all the requirements
for them.

00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:11.876 A:middle
Armed with this information,
what you'd be able

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:15.316 A:middle
to do is automate a lot
of your interactions

00:40:15.316 --> 00:40:16.116 A:middle
with iTunes Connect.

00:40:16.116 --> 00:40:20.976 A:middle
You will be able to bulk manage
data, and you can integrate

00:40:20.976 --> 00:40:24.536 A:middle
that management with your
backend content management

00:40:24.536 --> 00:40:27.516 A:middle
systems, whatever
shape they are in.

00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:30.546 A:middle
Even, let's say if you are
an individual developer

00:40:30.946 --> 00:40:32.336 A:middle
and you have one or
two apps in the store,

00:40:32.336 --> 00:40:34.766 A:middle
this is still applicable to
you because you could come

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:37.646 A:middle
up with this package, you
could put it all together

00:40:38.246 --> 00:40:40.846 A:middle
and upload it in one
shot and be done.

00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:47.896 A:middle
But to get back to the
integration idea, how it shapes

00:40:47.896 --> 00:40:51.326 A:middle
up is really up to
you, because, well,

00:40:51.326 --> 00:40:53.246 A:middle
we don't know what those
content management systems

00:40:53.986 --> 00:40:56.606 A:middle
in your company are.

00:40:56.606 --> 00:40:59.486 A:middle
You know that; we don't.

00:40:59.486 --> 00:41:03.386 A:middle
They suit your flows;
they suit your processes.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.486 --> 00:41:03.386 A:middle
They suit your flows;
they suit your processes.

00:41:04.026 --> 00:41:07.466 A:middle
What we're providing is the
ability to integrate with them.

00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:10.826 A:middle
We're providing the tool,
Transporter, and the format,

00:41:10.826 --> 00:41:15.526 A:middle
metadata XML feed, and
the rest is up to you.

00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:19.576 A:middle
But we do have a demo of what

00:41:19.576 --> 00:41:22.946 A:middle
that interaction might look
like, and my colleague, Aravind,

00:41:22.946 --> 00:41:23.796 A:middle
will take you through it now.

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:24.156 A:middle
Thank you!

00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:24.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Aravind: Thank you Nik.

00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:29.526 A:middle
Well, that was an incredible
amount of new information there.

00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:33.246 A:middle
And naturally, the questions
would be, what's next...

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:34.386 A:middle
how do we get started...

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:37.236 A:middle
more importantly, how do
we put this in practice.

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:39.416 A:middle
Good morning, my
name is Aravind.

00:41:39.696 --> 00:41:40.876 A:middle
I'm an engineer in
the iTunes Store.

00:41:42.396 --> 00:41:47.226 A:middle
I'm here today to show you, how
you could keep your app metadata

00:41:47.226 --> 00:41:49.796 A:middle
in sync with iTunes Connect
using command line tools.

00:41:49.796 --> 00:41:54.516 A:middle
So, what we're going to do today
is, first invoke Transporter

00:41:54.516 --> 00:41:57.856 A:middle
with the lookupMetadata method,
which will get all the data

00:41:57.856 --> 00:41:59.266 A:middle
down to your local storage.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:03.446 A:middle
We'll visualize it, make
changes, and when we're ready

00:42:03.446 --> 00:42:06.196 A:middle
to upload, we'll use the
upload method in Transporter

00:42:06.196 --> 00:42:07.476 A:middle
to upload it back
to iTunes Connect.

00:42:07.826 --> 00:42:09.656 A:middle
We'll see the changes
on iTunes Connect.

00:42:09.946 --> 00:42:12.096 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:15.756 A:middle
Let's in fact start with
what we already know

00:42:17.046 --> 00:42:18.586 A:middle
and are familiar
with: iTunes Connect.

00:42:19.936 --> 00:42:22.666 A:middle
So here we have the iOS app.

00:42:22.826 --> 00:42:23.596 A:middle
It's got two versions.

00:42:24.456 --> 00:42:25.936 A:middle
There's one version
that is Ready for Sale

00:42:25.936 --> 00:42:27.606 A:middle
and another version that
we're preparing for upload.

00:42:28.066 --> 00:42:29.366 A:middle
Let's play today
with the version

00:42:29.366 --> 00:42:31.346 A:middle
that we're preparing for upload.

00:42:32.236 --> 00:42:35.446 A:middle
So we see that it's
got some basic data,

00:42:35.446 --> 00:42:39.436 A:middle
there's no localization, just
basic app default language.

00:42:39.976 --> 00:42:41.386 A:middle
It has a couple of screenshots.

00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:43.996 A:middle
Let's go back up to
Rights and Pricing.

00:42:45.506 --> 00:42:51.436 A:middle
We see that our app is on sale
at price tier 3 and it's only

00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:52.806 A:middle
on sale in the United States.

00:42:53.206 --> 00:42:55.026 A:middle
So, this is the data
that we have.

00:42:55.026 --> 00:42:56.106 A:middle
This is what we're
starting out with.

00:42:56.746 --> 00:42:57.566 A:middle
And this is what we want

00:42:57.566 --> 00:42:59.486 A:middle
to download before we can
start playing with it.

00:42:59.836 --> 00:43:05.316 A:middle
So, we'll invoke a script,
and because this is all meant

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.836 --> 00:43:05.316 A:middle
So, we'll invoke a script,
and because this is all meant

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:08.646 A:middle
to show case command line
ways of automating your stuff,

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:10.226 A:middle
everything is scripted.

00:43:11.246 --> 00:43:14.676 A:middle
So, the first script I'm going
to run is, lookupMetadata.

00:43:15.146 --> 00:43:17.326 A:middle
You can see that it's a simple
shell script and it's going

00:43:17.326 --> 00:43:18.706 A:middle
to invoke a bunch of
other scripts and so on.

00:43:19.176 --> 00:43:21.076 A:middle
And the first thing it's going
to do is download the metadata.

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:24.286 A:middle
We hit return and we see
that it is attempting

00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:25.096 A:middle
to invoke Transporter.

00:43:25.096 --> 00:43:27.466 A:middle
Let's quickly go
over the options

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.616 A:middle
that we're passing
to Transporter.

00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:32.606 A:middle
The first parameter is the
"-m lookupMetadata" parameter

00:43:33.046 --> 00:43:34.386 A:middle
and it's basically
telling Transporter

00:43:34.986 --> 00:43:36.126 A:middle
to download the metadata.

00:43:37.146 --> 00:43:38.826 A:middle
Metadata for what?

00:43:39.126 --> 00:43:40.766 A:middle
If you look at the
parameter called "vendor-id",

00:43:40.936 --> 00:43:43.366 A:middle
that's your app SKU and that
basically tells Transporter

00:43:43.816 --> 00:43:47.756 A:middle
to lookup the metadata
for that particular app.

00:43:47.986 --> 00:43:49.596 A:middle
We pass in the username
and password.

00:43:50.266 --> 00:43:52.336 A:middle
Note that this is not the
actual username and password.

00:43:52.566 --> 00:43:55.376 A:middle
This is another automation
feature that tells Transporter

00:43:55.376 --> 00:43:57.446 A:middle
to lookup your actual
username and password

00:43:57.446 --> 00:43:59.126 A:middle
from environment
variables USERNAME

00:43:59.126 --> 00:44:00.126 A:middle
and PASSWORD, uppercase.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.126 --> 00:44:00.126 A:middle
and PASSWORD, uppercase.

00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:03.986 A:middle
And finally, the "destination"
parameter tells Transporter

00:44:03.986 --> 00:44:07.346 A:middle
where to actually store the
data on your local storage.

00:44:08.556 --> 00:44:09.896 A:middle
You'll also notice
the "-v" parameter

00:44:09.896 --> 00:44:12.156 A:middle
that just tells Transporter
to log only critical messages.

00:44:13.126 --> 00:44:15.696 A:middle
So, I hit return, and,
Transporter does a bunch

00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:18.286 A:middle
of self-checks, and begins
downloading the data.

00:44:19.266 --> 00:44:19.766 A:middle
And it's done.

00:44:21.336 --> 00:44:24.856 A:middle
So, what Transporter did was
create a package directory

00:44:24.856 --> 00:44:27.546 A:middle
called itmsp with the
name of your app SKU

00:44:28.596 --> 00:44:29.976 A:middle
and our script now
takes over and wants

00:44:29.976 --> 00:44:31.286 A:middle
to open the XML document.

00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:38.226 A:middle
Let's hit return, and,
we open it in Xcode.

00:44:39.396 --> 00:44:42.856 A:middle
Now, this is a giant XML
document, and I don't want to go

00:44:42.856 --> 00:44:43.956 A:middle
through it in great detail.

00:44:43.956 --> 00:44:47.376 A:middle
It's not that useful
for human visualization.

00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:49.636 A:middle
But let me just point
out a couple of things.

00:44:49.916 --> 00:44:52.746 A:middle
The thing I wanted to show
you was the identifiers.

00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:55.456 A:middle
The team-id and the vendor-id.

00:44:56.036 --> 00:44:59.206 A:middle
Now, I point this out
because, when you do a lookup,

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:02.216 A:middle
you get the metadata and these
identifiers are provided to you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:02.216 A:middle
you get the metadata and these
identifiers are provided to you.

00:45:02.856 --> 00:45:04.346 A:middle
When you're ready to
send the data back,

00:45:04.586 --> 00:45:06.586 A:middle
you have to provide these
two identifiers as well.

00:45:06.586 --> 00:45:09.276 A:middle
And then there's a whole
bunch of other data.

00:45:09.396 --> 00:45:11.636 A:middle
Now, as I said, this is XML

00:45:11.636 --> 00:45:14.136 A:middle
and it's not exactly
usable or human friendly.

00:45:14.136 --> 00:45:17.656 A:middle
So what we want to do is
transform this to a format

00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:19.646 A:middle
that we can actually
work with and use.

00:45:19.646 --> 00:45:22.256 A:middle
Now, this is where it
gets a little interesting.

00:45:22.776 --> 00:45:26.396 A:middle
For the purpose of this demo,
I've made a deliberate choice

00:45:26.396 --> 00:45:28.926 A:middle
to model this XML
as a series of flat,

00:45:29.246 --> 00:45:30.656 A:middle
simple command separated values.

00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:34.246 A:middle
When you are ready to
integrate iTunes Connect

00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:35.816 A:middle
with your Content
Management System,

00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:38.146 A:middle
you get to make your
choices of how you mode

00:45:38.146 --> 00:45:40.456 A:middle
and how you transform it.

00:45:41.036 --> 00:45:44.116 A:middle
So let's close our Xcode.

00:45:44.246 --> 00:45:45.246 A:middle
Go back to our script.

00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:48.626 A:middle
Our script is ready to transform
this XML to a CSV document.

00:45:49.156 --> 00:45:52.596 A:middle
I hit return, transformation
complete, and it wants

00:45:52.596 --> 00:45:54.296 A:middle
to open this CSV document.

00:45:55.036 --> 00:45:58.386 A:middle
Speaking of CSV documents,
the most obvious choice

00:45:58.606 --> 00:46:00.286 A:middle
for opening a CSV
document is ...

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.606 --> 00:46:00.286 A:middle
for opening a CSV
document is ...

00:46:01.106 --> 00:46:06.686 A:middle
Numbers. So, we hit return and
open the document in Numbers.

00:46:06.786 --> 00:46:08.376 A:middle
And... Boom!

00:46:09.326 --> 00:46:12.786 A:middle
Just the data, without all
that distracting XML tags.

00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:16.096 A:middle
Ok, so what are we
looking at here?

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.556 A:middle
You can kind of make out
that there are four sections

00:46:18.556 --> 00:46:23.026 A:middle
or blocks of data,
labeled as Entities.

00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:25.876 A:middle
So, the first entity
type is locale.

00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:27.916 A:middle
It's got all the
basic app metadata,

00:46:28.426 --> 00:46:30.866 A:middle
across various versions,
across various localizations.

00:46:33.036 --> 00:46:34.676 A:middle
Currently, of course, as
we saw on iTunes Connect,

00:46:34.676 --> 00:46:37.256 A:middle
it only has English, US-English,
and that's what we see here.

00:46:38.286 --> 00:46:39.926 A:middle
The second section
deals with screenshots.

00:46:40.236 --> 00:46:42.266 A:middle
It's got all the screenshots
across all versions,

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:44.866 A:middle
across all localizations,
across all device types.

00:46:45.976 --> 00:46:48.456 A:middle
And again, we saw on iTunes
Connect, we have just a couple

00:46:48.456 --> 00:46:50.416 A:middle
of screenshots for version 2.0.

00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:52.786 A:middle
The third and fourth sections,

00:46:52.786 --> 00:46:54.516 A:middle
deal with Pricing
and Availability.

00:46:55.336 --> 00:46:59.256 A:middle
As we saw on iTunes Connect, our
app is on sale at price tier 3,

00:46:59.906 --> 00:47:02.096 A:middle
and it's available only
in the United States.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.906 --> 00:47:02.096 A:middle
and it's available only
in the United States.

00:47:03.096 --> 00:47:06.986 A:middle
So, this is the data we saw on
iTunes Connect, we were able

00:47:06.986 --> 00:47:08.216 A:middle
to successfully download
it here,

00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:10.226 A:middle
and we're able to visualize it.

00:47:11.556 --> 00:47:12.576 A:middle
We like the data...

00:47:13.966 --> 00:47:15.166 A:middle
let's change it.

00:47:16.056 --> 00:47:18.206 A:middle
Let's say we want to add a
couple of new localizations.

00:47:18.516 --> 00:47:20.426 A:middle
Let's say we want
to add app metadata

00:47:20.426 --> 00:47:22.006 A:middle
for Spanish and Russian.

00:47:23.226 --> 00:47:25.156 A:middle
We want to make the app
available for sale in Russia

00:47:25.156 --> 00:47:28.846 A:middle
and in Spain in addition
to the United States.

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:32.756 A:middle
And while we're at it, we
want to make our app er,

00:47:33.746 --> 00:47:37.986 A:middle
put out app on sale at price
tier 1 for let's say a month.

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:40.326 A:middle
Now, that's a lot of changes.

00:47:40.796 --> 00:47:42.656 A:middle
Now, I could make
all those edits here,

00:47:42.656 --> 00:47:45.986 A:middle
but we don't have the time.

00:47:45.986 --> 00:47:47.346 A:middle
Plus, I don't know
Spanish or Russian.

00:47:48.336 --> 00:47:49.556 A:middle
So, let me close this out.

00:47:49.846 --> 00:47:54.176 A:middle
I have somebody do all the hard
work of translating all this,

00:47:54.176 --> 00:47:59.066 A:middle
so I have another document,
that has all these edits.

00:47:59.066 --> 00:48:02.476 A:middle
Alright, so what are
we looking at here?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.066 --> 00:48:02.476 A:middle
Alright, so what are
we looking at here?

00:48:02.716 --> 00:48:04.816 A:middle
It's practically, the same
document we saw earlier.

00:48:06.476 --> 00:48:07.946 A:middle
The changes are highlighted

00:48:07.946 --> 00:48:09.766 A:middle
in bright eye-popping
yellow, so you don't miss it.

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:12.346 A:middle
The ones I haven't
changed are greyed out.

00:48:13.086 --> 00:48:16.346 A:middle
So you can see that we have
some content for Spanish,

00:48:16.876 --> 00:48:19.816 A:middle
content for Russian,
all that nice,

00:48:19.996 --> 00:48:21.596 A:middle
happy looking Cyrillic
characters there...

00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:26.706 A:middle
we have a bunch of screenshots
for every device type,

00:48:27.506 --> 00:48:28.856 A:middle
so we have a whole bunch
of screenshots here.

00:48:30.696 --> 00:48:32.806 A:middle
We see that we're
making the app available

00:48:32.806 --> 00:48:34.176 A:middle
for sale in Spain and Russia.

00:48:35.676 --> 00:48:38.956 A:middle
And we also see the price
tier go down for a month to 1.

00:48:40.096 --> 00:48:42.326 A:middle
So, that's a lot of changes.

00:48:43.116 --> 00:48:44.236 A:middle
Let's upload it.

00:48:45.636 --> 00:48:47.436 A:middle
I go back but this time
use a different script.

00:48:48.706 --> 00:48:51.706 A:middle
This script is going to do
sort of like the mirror image

00:48:51.776 --> 00:48:52.786 A:middle
of what the previous script did.

00:48:53.136 --> 00:48:56.736 A:middle
It's going to take this flat,
comma separated values document,

00:48:57.306 --> 00:49:00.536 A:middle
transform it to XML and then
upload it to iTunes Connect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.306 --> 00:49:00.536 A:middle
transform it to XML and then
upload it to iTunes Connect.

00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:05.826 A:middle
I invoke a script called
upload-metadata.sh.

00:49:06.836 --> 00:49:09.836 A:middle
So the first thing it's doing
is converting the CSV to XML.

00:49:09.836 --> 00:49:11.176 A:middle
Done. Hit enter.

00:49:11.746 --> 00:49:13.306 A:middle
Now, it wants to
invoke Transporter.

00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:15.676 A:middle
Now, these options, should
be familiar to you by now,

00:49:15.676 --> 00:49:17.496 A:middle
except the first option "-m".

00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:19.916 A:middle
This time, we're using
the "upload" method

00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:23.376 A:middle
that tells Transporter to take
your package and send it over.

00:49:24.606 --> 00:49:25.566 A:middle
Where is the package?

00:49:25.656 --> 00:49:27.306 A:middle
That's the "-f" parameter,
that says,

00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:30.126 A:middle
look for the itmsp package here,

00:49:30.126 --> 00:49:31.896 A:middle
and that's the content
that's going

00:49:31.896 --> 00:49:32.896 A:middle
to be sent to iTunes Connect.

00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:37.936 A:middle
I hit return, and the
upload process begins.

00:49:38.006 --> 00:49:40.436 A:middle
Transporter does its self
checks, sends the data over,

00:49:41.336 --> 00:49:45.566 A:middle
and it looks like we failed.

00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:48.296 A:middle
OK. Nik mentioned earlier
that we do all the validations

00:49:48.436 --> 00:49:49.936 A:middle
that you're familiar with
in iTunes Connect, here,

00:49:49.936 --> 00:49:51.116 A:middle
and this is an example.

00:49:51.736 --> 00:49:54.176 A:middle
Every single field validation
that you have and you love

00:49:54.176 --> 00:49:55.716 A:middle
on iTunes Connect is
done here as well.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:57.026 A:middle
And some more.

00:49:57.076 --> 00:49:58.586 A:middle
Because of the nature
of the interaction,

00:49:59.226 --> 00:50:00.476 A:middle
we do some additional
validations.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:59.226 --> 00:50:00.476 A:middle
we do some additional
validations.

00:50:01.286 --> 00:50:05.056 A:middle
In this case, it turns
out, version 2.0,

00:50:05.056 --> 00:50:08.376 A:middle
in the Russian localization,
there is something wrong

00:50:08.376 --> 00:50:09.936 A:middle
in the ordering of
the screenshots

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:11.716 A:middle
for iOS 4 inch device.

00:50:12.316 --> 00:50:13.426 A:middle
The error message
is pretty clear,

00:50:13.426 --> 00:50:16.036 A:middle
so let's go to our original data
and see what's going on here.

00:50:16.826 --> 00:50:21.586 A:middle
I'm looking at the screenshots
section, version 2.0, iOS 4 inch

00:50:22.086 --> 00:50:23.426 A:middle
and here is my list
of positions.

00:50:24.286 --> 00:50:28.016 A:middle
And sure enough, we see that
it's not ordered correctly.

00:50:28.366 --> 00:50:33.006 A:middle
There's a typo, so
let me fix it.

00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:34.976 A:middle
There! That should fix it.

00:50:34.976 --> 00:50:36.846 A:middle
Save it. And let's
try this again.

00:50:36.846 --> 00:50:42.306 A:middle
Invoke upload-metadata.sh,
transform to XML,

00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:43.956 A:middle
invoke Transporter, hit return,

00:50:43.956 --> 00:50:46.746 A:middle
and let's see what we
end up with this time.

00:50:48.146 --> 00:50:49.226 A:middle
The same process happens.

00:50:49.266 --> 00:50:51.556 A:middle
The server does a
bunch of validations,

00:50:52.336 --> 00:50:55.936 A:middle
and if everything is good,
it should accept the upload.

00:50:57.046 --> 00:50:58.316 A:middle
And it turns out,
everything was good.

00:50:59.236 --> 00:51:00.406 A:middle
But we're not done yet.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.236 --> 00:51:00.406 A:middle
But we're not done yet.

00:51:01.866 --> 00:51:04.356 A:middle
The upload is done, but,

00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:06.416 A:middle
what we've uploaded
needs to be processed.

00:51:06.536 --> 00:51:08.806 A:middle
The server takes a little
bit of time to do that.

00:51:09.506 --> 00:51:12.286 A:middle
So let's make use
of that time to look

00:51:12.286 --> 00:51:13.816 A:middle
at what exactly we sent over.

00:51:14.596 --> 00:51:20.766 A:middle
We notice that, that's the
directory we gave Transporter

00:51:20.766 --> 00:51:21.276 A:middle
to upload.

00:51:21.836 --> 00:51:25.696 A:middle
So let me "cd" to that directory
and see what's going on there.

00:51:27.176 --> 00:51:29.136 A:middle
We can see that there'a
metadata.xml.

00:51:29.746 --> 00:51:32.686 A:middle
That XML is essentially the
transformation of the flat,

00:51:32.876 --> 00:51:35.026 A:middle
giant spreadsheet from
before into an XML format.

00:51:35.616 --> 00:51:36.676 A:middle
And a bunch of screenshots.

00:51:37.406 --> 00:51:40.936 A:middle
Now, if you're wondering,
we had three localizations,

00:51:40.936 --> 00:51:43.006 A:middle
fifteen screenshots each,
so forty five screeshots,

00:51:43.006 --> 00:51:44.236 A:middle
but we only see fifteen
screenshots here,

00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:46.076 A:middle
this is a demo, so I'm
reusing the screenshots

00:51:46.076 --> 00:51:47.226 A:middle
across all localizations.

00:51:48.436 --> 00:51:51.236 A:middle
And, while we'e at it,
let's look the metadata.xml.

00:51:51.276 --> 00:51:54.466 A:middle
This is the outgoing
metadata.xml.

00:51:54.466 --> 00:51:59.546 A:middle
Notice that, the format is
almost exactly the same.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:00.096 --> 00:52:04.086 A:middle
We notice that we're sending the
team-id back, vendor-id back,

00:52:04.736 --> 00:52:06.286 A:middle
and pretty much all
the localizations.

00:52:07.126 --> 00:52:10.736 A:middle
Before we move on, let me
point out just one quick thing.

00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:14.876 A:middle
We made one Transporter
call, got everything down,

00:52:15.436 --> 00:52:16.856 A:middle
all that's relevant
for localizations,

00:52:17.386 --> 00:52:19.666 A:middle
and we made changes
to the format,

00:52:19.756 --> 00:52:22.376 A:middle
and another Transporter call and
uploaded the whole thing back.

00:52:23.116 --> 00:52:25.856 A:middle
Now that's automation at its
simplest and most efficient.

00:52:27.406 --> 00:52:28.836 A:middle
OK, so that was a
lot of changes...

00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:30.216 A:middle
but did it work?

00:52:31.236 --> 00:52:34.206 A:middle
Let's go back to iTunes
Connect, and check.

00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:39.006 A:middle
I'll do a refresh, I guess
it's still working on it.

00:52:39.696 --> 00:52:40.256 A:middle
(Refresh again).

00:52:40.256 --> 00:52:43.946 A:middle
There! We see the price tier
go down to tier 1 for a month,

00:52:44.296 --> 00:52:45.726 A:middle
and then back to tier 3.

00:52:46.566 --> 00:52:51.446 A:middle
Our app is on sale in Spain,
in Russia, and of course,

00:52:51.476 --> 00:52:53.296 A:middle
we didn't change anything for
the United States, so it's still

00:52:53.296 --> 00:52:54.476 A:middle
on sale in the United States.

00:52:55.206 --> 00:52:56.946 A:middle
Let's go back to localizations.

00:52:57.896 --> 00:52:58.846 A:middle
I'll cancel this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:00.196 --> 00:53:04.086 A:middle
Version 2.0, right!

00:53:04.086 --> 00:53:06.096 A:middle
In English, the only thing we
did was we added a whole bunch

00:53:06.096 --> 00:53:07.546 A:middle
of screenshots and those
screenshots are here.

00:53:07.546 --> 00:53:09.776 A:middle
Ok, how about the
other localizations?

00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:10.556 A:middle
Russian...

00:53:11.286 --> 00:53:11.806 A:middle
very good.

00:53:12.026 --> 00:53:12.526 A:middle
They're all here.

00:53:13.386 --> 00:53:14.176 A:middle
And Spanish....

00:53:15.546 --> 00:53:18.736 A:middle
and... they're all here.

00:53:18.926 --> 00:53:21.346 A:middle
So, that pretty much brings
us to the end of the demo.

00:53:22.486 --> 00:53:25.166 A:middle
What we did was, we downloaded
the metadata, we were able

00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:27.686 A:middle
to transform it to a form we
could visualize and play with,

00:53:27.686 --> 00:53:30.216 A:middle
store etc. and we
uploaded the metadata.

00:53:31.016 --> 00:53:33.246 A:middle
I hope this gave you some ideas

00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:35.966 A:middle
about how you can integrate
your Content Management Systems

00:53:36.096 --> 00:53:36.816 A:middle
with iTunes Connect.

00:53:37.696 --> 00:53:38.946 A:middle
Happy Integration,
and Thank you.

00:53:39.236 --> 00:53:40.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dave Van Tassell:
OK, thank you Aravind.

00:53:40.586 --> 00:53:42.226 A:middle
That's a lot of information.

00:53:42.326 --> 00:53:44.656 A:middle
There will be a test when
you leave the room there.

00:53:44.656 --> 00:53:46.496 A:middle
People in red shirts
have it for you.

00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:49.876 A:middle
So there's our enhanced
command-line automation.

00:53:50.986 --> 00:53:52.966 A:middle
Every year, we like
to ask App Review

00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:54.746 A:middle
if they have any
suggestions for you.

00:53:55.506 --> 00:53:57.446 A:middle
A few dos and don'ts,
so let's go over those.

00:53:57.446 --> 00:54:01.506 A:middle
On the metadata side, if you're
providing a demo account,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:57.446 --> 00:54:01.506 A:middle
On the metadata side, if you're
providing a demo account,

00:54:01.506 --> 00:54:03.236 A:middle
make sure it's full
access to the app.

00:54:03.706 --> 00:54:06.316 A:middle
Please list any hardware that's
required to review your app.

00:54:07.366 --> 00:54:09.096 A:middle
The screenshots and the
description: They have to be

00:54:09.096 --> 00:54:13.606 A:middle
about your app and need to
have the rights for any content

00:54:13.606 --> 00:54:15.386 A:middle
and keywords that
you put in your app.

00:54:16.746 --> 00:54:21.416 A:middle
For the app behavior itself,
high quality experience;

00:54:21.416 --> 00:54:22.436 A:middle
I think that speaks for itself.

00:54:22.586 --> 00:54:23.476 A:middle
Please test the app.

00:54:23.476 --> 00:54:24.896 A:middle
I know I shouldn't
have to say that.

00:54:24.896 --> 00:54:27.706 A:middle
After five years, we
are still reviewing apps

00:54:27.706 --> 00:54:29.556 A:middle
that crash and have bugs.

00:54:31.276 --> 00:54:33.166 A:middle
Appropriate usage of
both background mode

00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:35.066 A:middle
and iCloud storage
is very important,

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:38.676 A:middle
as is if you are selling any
digital content or services,

00:54:38.676 --> 00:54:40.156 A:middle
in-app purchases
are the way to go.

00:54:41.106 --> 00:54:43.406 A:middle
For privacy, we value
our users' privacy.

00:54:44.256 --> 00:54:45.486 A:middle
Please don't ask
for any information,

00:54:45.486 --> 00:54:47.526 A:middle
unless it is relevant for
the app functionality.

00:54:48.466 --> 00:54:49.946 A:middle
And lastly, iPhone 5 support.

00:54:50.636 --> 00:54:53.646 A:middle
This is the number one reason
that apps upon upload move

00:54:53.646 --> 00:54:56.686 A:middle
into the invalid binary
section, invalid binary state.

00:54:56.686 --> 00:54:59.626 A:middle
It is a mistake with the
iPhone 5 launch image.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:00.056 --> 00:55:02.246 A:middle
There's a lot of
documentation information online

00:55:02.296 --> 00:55:03.366 A:middle
about how to do that correctly.

00:55:03.586 --> 00:55:04.086 A:middle
Please look it up.

00:55:04.596 --> 00:55:10.476 A:middle
And that is App Review
Dos and Don'ts.

00:55:10.556 --> 00:55:11.606 A:middle
Little bit more information.

00:55:12.066 --> 00:55:15.966 A:middle
Paul Marcos, our
evangelist, the documentation

00:55:16.126 --> 00:55:17.796 A:middle
as Nick showed you, is
all on iTunes Connect,

00:55:17.796 --> 00:55:19.726 A:middle
including the developer guide,

00:55:19.726 --> 00:55:23.196 A:middle
