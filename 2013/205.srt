[ Silence ]

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:19.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:20.916 A:middle
[applause] Thank you.

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:23.826 A:middle
Welcome to What's New in Cocoa.

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:26.696 A:middle
My name is Ali Ozer, I'm the
director Cocoa Frameworks

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:27.276 A:middle
at Apple.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:30.986 A:middle
So, what are we going
to talk about today?

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.616 A:middle
We're going to give you
a high level overview

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:38.876 A:middle
of the updates we made to Cocoa
in Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9,

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:42.336 A:middle
and we're going to give you
pointers to related sessions

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:45.756 A:middle
and labs because we have
many sessions and labs.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.696 A:middle
Note that everything we're going
to talk about today is new,

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.986 A:middle
so I'm not going to be
putting this new badge

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.516 A:middle
on every single slide that
has new material on it,

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:54.896 A:middle
pretty much most things are new.

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:57.886 A:middle
And this is not a
complete reference

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:59.866 A:middle
to all the things we've added.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.726 A:middle
These are the highlights, we
have Heather file updates,

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:04.696 A:middle
we have Release Notes,

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:07.496 A:middle
and in many cases coming
soon we have documentation.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:09.916 A:middle
Please refer to those
for the complete story.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:13.836 A:middle
OK, first let's talk about Tags,

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:16.336 A:middle
you saw the feature
yesterday in the Keynote.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
Tags is a new feature
which enables users

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.596 A:middle
to assign arbitrarily named
labels to their files.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.856 A:middle
And users can search
for their files

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.076 A:middle
or group their files
using these Tags.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:30.776 A:middle
It's a pretty powerful feature.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:32.186 A:middle
Just to recap what
it looks like,

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:36.096 A:middle
so here is some files
grouped by Tag for instance

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.276 A:middle
that you can see the tags
are shown along the side

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:41.626 A:middle
and also under the file names.

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:44.346 A:middle
You can search by
tag as shown here,

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:47.386 A:middle
you type your search tags
there and you will be displayed

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.906 A:middle
that files with those
tags will be displayed.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:54.406 A:middle
You can bring up a side bar
which lists the tags you have.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.886 A:middle
You can go ahead and use tags
in your iCloud open panel.

00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:00.956 A:middle
You can see the tags and their
iCloud documents as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:00.956 A:middle
You can see the tags and their
iCloud documents as well.

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:04.476 A:middle
You can go ahead and assign tags
to files as you're saving them

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:06.436 A:middle
or you can go ahead
and change the tags

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:10.045 A:middle
on files using this new
document popover that comes

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:11.126 A:middle
out from the title bar.

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.666 A:middle
So there are many ways for
users to interact with Tags.

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:17.636 A:middle
Now, let's talk at-- look at
the APIs we've added for tags.

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:20.666 A:middle
It's actually not too many APIs
here we don't need too many.

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:25.586 A:middle
One is a new, NSURL resource
key, NSURL tag names key

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.996 A:middle
and the value of this is
an NS array of NS strings.

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:32.806 A:middle
You would use this API on
an NSURL, get resource value

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:36.466 A:middle
for KeyError which of course
an API NSURL already has

00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:40.106 A:middle
to get the list of Tags
assigned to a given file,

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:43.656 A:middle
and you would use the set
API to set tags on a file.

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:47.956 A:middle
Now, as you saw earlier, we
also have support for Tags

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:51.256 A:middle
in the safe panel and
it's actually automatic,

00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:54.406 A:middle
not just for NSDocument-based
applications

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.026 A:middle
but also any application

00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:59.996 A:middle
that uses the safe panel will
get a TagsField as shown here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:02.796 A:middle
Now, the safe panel
will show the TagsField,

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.936 A:middle
it will allow the users
to edit those tags

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.676 A:middle
and it will also
automatically apply those tags

00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:10.076 A:middle
to the saved file, so you don't
really have to do anything.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
Now, there might be cases
where this doesn't work right

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.626 A:middle
or there might be
cases where you want

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:15.876 A:middle
to customize this behavior.

00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:18.236 A:middle
In those cases, we
do have an API.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.356 A:middle
You can explicitly indicate that
you want to show the TagsField

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:23.906 A:middle
or you don't want to
show the TagsField.

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.696 A:middle
And if you are showing the
TagsField, you can then go ahead

00:03:26.696 --> 00:03:29.016 A:middle
and get and set the list of tags

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:31.736 A:middle
that the user has
specified on that file.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.086 A:middle
And then you would
apply them yourself

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:34.536 A:middle
or do whatever else you
want to do with them.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.966 A:middle
Next thing I want to talk about
is Light Content Controls.

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:40.336 A:middle
So, these are new controls,

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:43.666 A:middle
variants of our controls
are Standard Aqua Controls

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:47.046 A:middle
that are meant for Window
bodies or Document Content.

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
Here's some example.

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:52.606 A:middle
This is the event inspector
in the Calendar application

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.476 A:middle
and the buttons you see
here, down the side,

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.486 A:middle
these are Light Content
Controls.

00:03:57.486 --> 00:03:59.806 A:middle
As you can see they're
somewhat lighter,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.656 A:middle
than standard Aqua
controls and they're meant

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.106 A:middle
for that white lighter
colored background.

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:08.076 A:middle
Here's another example, this
is the Contacts application,

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:10.936 A:middle
and the buttons along the side
are light content controls.

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:13.246 A:middle
Here's the Maps application.

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.315 A:middle
Now, the buttons along the top
here are standard Aqua controls

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.666 A:middle
because they're just
being displayed on top

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.466 A:middle
of the standard Window
background.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.076 A:middle
But if you bring up a
popover in this application,

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:25.146 A:middle
then the buttons you
see in the popover again

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:28.006 A:middle
in that light background, these
are light contents controls.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.466 A:middle
So, how do you access these
light content controls?

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:34.646 A:middle
Well, they're available through
a new API called NS Appearance.

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:39.116 A:middle
This is a class that lets you
access alternate appearances

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.126 A:middle
and it's got a bunch of
methods, the one I'm going

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:44.676 A:middle
to show here is appearance name,

00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:46.216 A:middle
you just give it
an appearance name

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.026 A:middle
and it fetches an
appearance for you.

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:49.466 A:middle
And we have two appearances
to find;

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.156 A:middle
Standard Aqua, and
Light Content.

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:53.826 A:middle
Now, once you have
an appearance,

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:54.606 A:middle
what do you do with it?

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.626 A:middle
You would use this protocol
which is to find on View,

00:04:57.726 --> 00:04:59.386 A:middle
on NSView and NSWindow,

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
the appearance customization
protocol.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
the appearance customization
protocol.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:04.906 A:middle
You can go ahead and the set
the appearance of that View

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:09.146 A:middle
or Window, and all the UI
elements inside that View

00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:12.186 A:middle
of Window will now
inherit this appearance,

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:13.876 A:middle
and start using the
appearance you've specified.

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
And since the UI element
can inherit its appearance

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:19.816 A:middle
from its parent views
there's also another property,

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:21.766 A:middle
a Read Only property
called Effective Appearance

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.696 A:middle
which lets you tell what
appearance a UI element should

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:25.146 A:middle
be using.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:28.716 A:middle
Now, you don't have to use codes
for this, you can also do this

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:32.256 A:middle
in Xcode in the Attributes
Inspector

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:33.626 A:middle
in Xcode interface builder.

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:40.216 A:middle
So here for instance is the
Attributes Inspector for box.

00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:41.836 A:middle
You can do this for
container classes.

00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:45.056 A:middle
And at the bottom here, you
see the appearance setting.

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.446 A:middle
It's now showing Aqua.

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.126 A:middle
If you click on it
you can see that,

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:52.286 A:middle
you can now specify light
content for that container

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.726 A:middle
and as I said, all the elements

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:55.686 A:middle
in there will now start
using this appearance.

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.826 A:middle
Next thing I want to talk
about is NS StackView.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.226 A:middle
NS StackView is a
new class we've added

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.226 A:middle
NS StackView is a
new class we've added

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.136 A:middle
to AppKit in Mavericks.

00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:05.046 A:middle
It's a class which
manages stacks of views

00:06:05.216 --> 00:06:07.056 A:middle
and it uses Auto
Layout internally.

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:09.486 A:middle
It lets you group the views

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:11.296 A:middle
and we'll be seeing an
example of that shortly.

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:14.656 A:middle
And it also will manage
the sizing of the views

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:17.856 A:middle
and it will also drop Views, or
click Views, or tighten Views

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.646 A:middle
as necessary as the
StackView size changes.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.476 A:middle
Let me give you a
little example.

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:27.316 A:middle
This is the kind of view you
might build with NS StackView.

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:30.406 A:middle
Here you have a group of
controls on the left side

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:32.996 A:middle
and you have another control,
a slider on the other side.

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:36.916 A:middle
As this view is made smaller,
the slider comes closer

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.666 A:middle
to the other group and then the
slider starts getting smaller.

00:06:39.996 --> 00:06:42.266 A:middle
And then, the text field
starts getting smaller.

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:45.606 A:middle
And eventually when there's no
more room and pressure's rising,

00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:48.606 A:middle
the button all the way at this
end is voted off the island

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.726 A:middle
and then things start to
continue to get even smaller.

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:53.976 A:middle
So, as you can see, StackView
they're not only used

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:57.876 A:middle
to using Auto Layout, it's also
hiding and removing some Views

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.866 A:middle
as needed and it will
also bring them back

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:01.616 A:middle
when the StackView
is made larger.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
So, in this way StackView is
using Auto Layout and building

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:06.576 A:middle
on top of it, and you
yourself don't have to worry

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:09.446 A:middle
about any creating those
constraints or managing them

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:10.926 A:middle
which is, you know, not

00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:13.366 A:middle
that [inaudible] especially
once you're removing

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.636 A:middle
and adding Views and so on.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.786 A:middle
Now, StackViews don't
have to be horizontal,

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:18.036 A:middle
they can also be vertical.

00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:20.736 A:middle
Here's a kind of view you might
build with a vertical StackView,

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:22.626 A:middle
this is an inspector
panel you might see

00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:24.286 A:middle
in drawing application.

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:30.466 A:middle
As you expand the various
pieces, various elements up here

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:32.776 A:middle
and you know, they will collapse
as well and that's the kind

00:07:32.776 --> 00:07:35.746 A:middle
of thing that's fairly simple
to build with a StackView.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:38.766 A:middle
The API of NS StackView
is purely straightforward,

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:42.586 A:middle
you create one by giving it
some views, StackView with views

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:46.866 A:middle
or you can choose to add Views
explicitly one at a time.

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:49.906 A:middle
Here, you're specifying gravity
and the gravity is the grouping,

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:53.036 A:middle
either one end, to the other end
or the middle of the StackView.

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.536 A:middle
And there are other
properties on StackView

00:07:55.806 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
that lets you specify properties
in Layouts such as the spacing,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:55.806 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
that lets you specify properties
in Layouts such as the spacing,

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:01.856 A:middle
the priority, what the clipping

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.656 A:middle
and hugging priorities
are and so on.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:07.566 A:middle
There will be a more in-depth
coverage of NS StackView

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:09.856 A:middle
in this talk which is tomorrow,

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:12.746 A:middle
best practices for
Cocoa Animation.

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:16.336 A:middle
This talk will also go into
various animation techniques

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:19.476 A:middle
for Cocoa both old and new,
so it's a great to talk

00:08:19.476 --> 00:08:21.946 A:middle
to learn both about animation
and StackView and in fact

00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:23.566 A:middle
about animating StackViews
as well.

00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:25.476 A:middle
So, next I want to talk--

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.766 A:middle
so just of having to
talk about Auto Layout,

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:30.006 A:middle
let me just talk a bit
about Auto Layout as well.

00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:33.046 A:middle
In Auto Layout, we've made a
lot of performance improvements

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:36.086 A:middle
and this is true in
general but especially

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:37.645 A:middle
in view-based TableViews.

00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:41.116 A:middle
That's because constraints are
now attached to Views in a way

00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:43.566 A:middle
that as Views are removed
or added to the hierarchy,

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:44.856 A:middle
they stick to the View.

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:47.416 A:middle
In addition, we've
made the enumeration

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:50.416 A:middle
of constraints a lot more
efficient and predictable,

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:53.546 A:middle
so that you will see much
more predictable behavior in--

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:55.846 A:middle
when dealing with Views that
have a lot of constraints.

00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:58.376 A:middle
So, that's something you should
notice in your applications.

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:01.016 A:middle
In addition, we have
a new workflow to deal

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:01.016 A:middle
In addition, we have
a new workflow to deal

00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:02.516 A:middle
with Auto Layout in Xcode.

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:07.746 A:middle
In general, Xcode is a lot
more flexible and forgiving

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.946 A:middle
about letting you do
Auto Layout in Xcode.

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:12.396 A:middle
You can now delete constraints,

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:15.326 A:middle
you can create ambiguous
structures, you can move Views

00:09:15.326 --> 00:09:18.346 A:middle
around et cetera and Xcode
won't throw a fit anymore.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:20.856 A:middle
So this is-- you
are more in control.

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:24.786 A:middle
And you can see more about
this in tomorrow's session,

00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:27.176 A:middle
taking control of Auto
Layout in Xcode 5.

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:29.286 A:middle
Next, I want to talk about
Responsive Scrolling,

00:09:29.356 --> 00:09:33.266 A:middle
and you saw a demo of this
yesterday at the Keynote,

00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:35.576 A:middle
in addition you saw it perhaps
at the State of the Union

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.026 A:middle
in the afternoon as
well it's something

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.966 A:middle
that we've worked a lot on

00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:43.026 A:middle
and it's you know
something we think is great.

00:09:43.576 --> 00:09:45.496 A:middle
The goal here is to
provide the users

00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:48.406 A:middle
with non-stuttering
fluid scrolling.

00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:52.986 A:middle
So let me just give you a review
of how scrolling works in 10.8.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:56.236 A:middle
So here it is a view and assume,

00:09:56.236 --> 00:09:58.856 A:middle
not the blue border there
is your divisible area

00:09:58.856 --> 00:09:59.646 A:middle
of the ScrollView.

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
In 10.8, when the user
scrolls, they see this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
In 10.8, when the user
scrolls, they see this.

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:07.186 A:middle
Now, really what's
happening under the covers is

00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:10.736 A:middle
that when the scroll
starts, divisible area

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:15.236 A:middle
of the view is copied up
a blip, blip if you will.

00:10:15.236 --> 00:10:18.806 A:middle
And then the-- reveal the area
is drawn in by calling drawRect.

00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:20.606 A:middle
And then this happens again

00:10:20.606 --> 00:10:22.416 A:middle
for every little
slice that's visible.

00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:25.476 A:middle
And of course, the user
never see the black flash

00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:28.076 A:middle
because we actually copy
the bits up and then we fill

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:30.386 A:middle
in that area without
flushing the Window

00:10:30.616 --> 00:10:32.366 A:middle
so that the user actually
doesn't see a flash.

00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:37.716 A:middle
But one thing you will notice is
that in a situation like this,

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:40.376 A:middle
the scrolling performance
is really at the mercy

00:10:40.376 --> 00:10:41.896 A:middle
of the performance of drawRect.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
If that drawRect
call just to fill

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:47.056 A:middle
in that little strip
takes say, half a second,

00:10:47.336 --> 00:10:50.116 A:middle
scrolling all stutter,
really for half a second.

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:52.756 A:middle
And actually more generally,
scrolling performance is

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:54.116 A:middle
at the mercy of the main thread

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:56.626 A:middle
because the drawRect is
happening on the main thread

00:10:56.826 --> 00:10:59.146 A:middle
and the main thread is
a pretty popular place.

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
There is the Run Loop there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
There is the Run Loop there.

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:02.726 A:middle
You know, things are happening.

00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:04.866 A:middle
All sorts of things
might be happening,

00:11:04.866 --> 00:11:06.316 A:middle
network activity,
who knows what?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:10.476 A:middle
So, even if drawRect wasn't
badly behaving there might be

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:13.446 A:middle
other factors which cause the
whole scrolling experience

00:11:13.496 --> 00:11:15.196 A:middle
to stutter in certain
conditions.

00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:16.816 A:middle
So, what's the solution?

00:11:17.896 --> 00:11:22.806 A:middle
The solution is to dissociate
the scrolling from domain thread

00:11:22.806 --> 00:11:24.906 A:middle
as much as possible and
we've done two things

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:25.946 A:middle
to help with this.

00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:29.196 A:middle
One, is to get scroll events
of a secondary thread.

00:11:29.976 --> 00:11:32.236 A:middle
Now, despite itself is good

00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:34.366 A:middle
because the main thread is
now longer fetching events.

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:37.866 A:middle
However, it's not
good enough by itself

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:40.256 A:middle
because if you get scroll
events on a secondary thread

00:11:40.256 --> 00:11:41.326 A:middle
and if you scroll the view

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.116 A:middle
on the secondary thread there
still won't be any content

00:11:44.116 --> 00:11:44.536 A:middle
to show.

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:47.616 A:middle
So, there will be white
flashes as the user scrolls,

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:50.516 A:middle
clearly not, not ideal.

00:11:50.756 --> 00:11:52.446 A:middle
So the second part
of the solution is

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:54.696 A:middle
to prepare Overdraw
regions ahead of time,

00:11:54.986 --> 00:11:57.356 A:middle
so that the scrolling
can happen smoothly.

00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:58.906 A:middle
And let me show how this works.

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
Here is our ScrollView again

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
Here is our ScrollView again

00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:04.856 A:middle
and this time we have a visible
area, the area that user sees.

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:08.096 A:middle
In addition, we have this
additionally drawn area

00:12:08.156 --> 00:12:09.476 A:middle
which we called the
Overdraw area

00:12:09.476 --> 00:12:11.156 A:middle
and that's not visible
at the moment.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:13.816 A:middle
So as the user scrolls this up,

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.576 A:middle
notice that drawRect
doesn't need to be called

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:18.666 A:middle
and the user maybe scrolls down
again no drawRect being called.

00:12:19.216 --> 00:12:23.366 A:middle
And-- but if the user scrolls
a bunch, then we might go ahead

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:25.786 A:middle
and call drawRect to fill
in that Overdraw area.

00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:28.956 A:middle
And of course Overdraw area
is well exists on any edge

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.946 A:middle
that the user can
scroll towards.

00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:35.496 A:middle
Now, this responsive
scrolling is actually automatic

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.276 A:middle
so you don't-- in most cases
you don't have to do anything

00:12:38.276 --> 00:12:40.036 A:middle
and your app should
get this feature,

00:12:40.316 --> 00:12:43.456 A:middle
assuming they're linked
on 10.8 or newer SDK.

00:12:43.456 --> 00:12:46.036 A:middle
And there are also a
few other conditions.

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:49.936 A:middle
Now, your application can
chose to explicitly opt in our

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:54.436 A:middle
out by overwriting this method
and this is a purview method

00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:56.416 A:middle
because you might want
some ScrollViews to do this

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:59.896 A:middle
and some ScrollViews not to is
com/public responsive scrolling

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.876 A:middle
by overwriting and
returning yes you say

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.876 A:middle
by overwriting and
returning yes you say

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.326 A:middle
"I'm doing responsive
scrolling no matter what."

00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:05.456 A:middle
Or "No, I don't want

00:13:05.456 --> 00:13:07.296 A:middle
to do responsive
scrolling no matter what."

00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:11.016 A:middle
So there's a bunch more
APIs here and a lot more--

00:13:11.016 --> 00:13:14.116 A:middle
lot more stuff to
learn and we will cover

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:16.476 A:middle
that in Optimizing
Drawing and Scrolling talk

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:18.576 A:middle
with is tomorrow
afternoon at 3:15.

00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:21.416 A:middle
And the next, I want to talk
a bit about Export as PDF.

00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:24.086 A:middle
And we talked about
Export as PDF before

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:28.006 A:middle
and maybe you've heard about
it in its using its other name

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:32.586 A:middle
such as save as PDF, save to
PDF, export to PDF et cetera.

00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:37.026 A:middle
The idea here is to enable the
user to generate a PDF file

00:13:37.026 --> 00:13:38.356 A:middle
without going through
the print panel.

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:41.226 A:middle
And in fact in general,
we'd like the UI

00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:44.086 A:middle
to separate PDF generation
from the print panel

00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:46.626 A:middle
and the whole printing
process as much as possible

00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:48.566 A:middle
from the point of
view of the user.

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:53.276 A:middle
So, in 10.9 here is what happens
when you choose Export as PDF

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:55.046 A:middle
in an application like TextEdit.

00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:56.366 A:middle
Here's my window.

00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:59.326 A:middle
You get a nice, simple
safe panel.

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.266 A:middle
It does nothing to do with
printing just a safe field.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.266 A:middle
It does nothing to do with
printing just a safe field.

00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:03.936 A:middle
And you can go ahead and save.

00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:04.756 A:middle
That's it.

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:05.596 A:middle
Your PDF is generated.

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:09.326 A:middle
If you want to go ahead and set
some parameters the users want

00:14:09.356 --> 00:14:11.976 A:middle
to have some control
or what, what they get.

00:14:12.406 --> 00:14:14.426 A:middle
They can click the
Show Details button

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:17.556 A:middle
and get a somewhat expanded
panel which has field

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.276 A:middle
such as page, size
and orientation

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.996 A:middle
if appropriate for
your application.

00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:23.966 A:middle
In addition, possibly
some additional views

00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:27.106 A:middle
that the application
is adding custom views.

00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:29.446 A:middle
And you know, we normally refer
to those as accessory view.

00:14:29.766 --> 00:14:32.836 A:middle
Now, we've added new APIs
and behaviors in 10.9

00:14:32.836 --> 00:14:35.206 A:middle
to make it lot easier
to do all this.

00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:39.156 A:middle
If you're NSDocument based
application there is a new

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.516 A:middle
action method, save
document to PDF.

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:44.636 A:middle
If you connect the
menu item to this,

00:14:45.636 --> 00:14:47.056 A:middle
that's pretty much
all you have to do

00:14:47.056 --> 00:14:48.976 A:middle
and you'll get the
experience I showed you.

00:14:49.366 --> 00:14:51.826 A:middle
Now, you might want to customize
though the PDF generation.

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.976 A:middle
For instance maybe
during PDF generation,

00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
you want to take a
different printing code path.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.666 A:middle
Not the one you would get
when the user print it.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:01.626 A:middle
In that case, you can
overwrite this method--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:01.626 A:middle
In that case, you can
overwrite this method--

00:15:02.096 --> 00:15:05.616 A:middle
I'm sorry, I skipped the
PDF print operation method

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:07.536 A:middle
and customized the
print operation.

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:10.176 A:middle
Now, if you're a non
NSDocument-based application,

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:12.386 A:middle
and it's also fairly easy

00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:15.726 A:middle
when you're generating your
Print operation, go ahead

00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:19.176 A:middle
and specify the job
disposition of Print Save job

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:22.456 A:middle
but do not supply a URL,
what that will do is

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:24.786 A:middle
that will cause the
save panel to be shown

00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:27.876 A:middle
and the user will be able to
specify file name as you saw.

00:15:28.446 --> 00:15:30.246 A:middle
There's a few other
ways to customize this.

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:33.766 A:middle
One new class, one other
new class is NS PDF panel,

00:15:34.036 --> 00:15:36.786 A:middle
this gives you more panel over
the panel and the excess review.

00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:39.556 A:middle
For instance, let's
say you don't want

00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:41.356 A:middle
to export just one
PDF file but you want

00:15:41.356 --> 00:15:43.476 A:middle
to export the whole bunch
of related PDF files

00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:46.736 A:middle
and you just want the user
to choose one location.

00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:49.946 A:middle
With this, there's an option
that lets you choose a folder

00:15:50.046 --> 00:15:51.656 A:middle
to save the PDF files too.

00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:55.076 A:middle
And then there's this other
class NS PDF info that sets

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.316 A:middle
and gets that basically
holds the user choices

00:15:57.316 --> 00:15:57.936 A:middle
that are being made.

00:15:58.276 --> 00:16:00.876 A:middle
Next thing I want to talk
about is Media Library Access.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.276 --> 00:16:00.876 A:middle
Next thing I want to talk
about is Media Library Access.

00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:05.316 A:middle
So the media library is the
user's library of images,

00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:08.246 A:middle
music, videos and so on.

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:10.976 A:middle
And they're managed by
applications such as iPhoto,

00:16:10.976 --> 00:16:12.756 A:middle
Aperture, iMovie, iTunes.

00:16:13.576 --> 00:16:16.706 A:middle
So, we have two sets of
APIs to make it easy for you

00:16:16.706 --> 00:16:18.236 A:middle
to access these media resources.

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:20.606 A:middle
One of them is a very simple API

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:23.526 A:middle
that just gives you
a non modal panel

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:25.626 A:middle
that will appear in
your applications.

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:29.686 A:middle
It's a new class of an app kit
called NS Media Library Browser

00:16:29.686 --> 00:16:31.746 A:middle
Controller and it's
fairly easy to use.

00:16:31.996 --> 00:16:33.976 A:middle
You would go ahead and
create the shared instance.

00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:37.666 A:middle
You would specify what kind of
what library you want to see

00:16:37.666 --> 00:16:39.976 A:middle
in this case image
so the photo library.

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:43.076 A:middle
And then make the UI visible.

00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:46.946 A:middle
When you do this, you will
get the panel that looks

00:16:46.946 --> 00:16:48.916 A:middle
like this appearing
in your application.

00:16:49.136 --> 00:16:51.896 A:middle
As you can see, it's showing
you your iPhoto events just

00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:53.146 A:middle
to where the user is used to.

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:57.486 A:middle
The user can go ahead and choose
or browse for individual images.

00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:01.056 A:middle
They can also go ahead and
browse through locations, faces,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:01.056 A:middle
They can also go ahead and
browse through locations, faces,

00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:04.766 A:middle
et cetera just like it appears
in iPhoto, Aperture et cetera.

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.266 A:middle
They can also go ahead and look
at the images in a list view

00:17:08.266 --> 00:17:10.165 A:middle
which gives them more
details about the images.

00:17:10.346 --> 00:17:13.156 A:middle
So, it's as fairly
simple, not customizable.

00:17:13.156 --> 00:17:16.086 A:middle
But you know, that only took two
or three lines of code to show.

00:17:16.406 --> 00:17:19.496 A:middle
The other API we have
gives you low-level access

00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:21.886 A:middle
to the user's library and
this comes in the form

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:24.516 A:middle
of a new framework called
medialibrary.framework.

00:17:25.036 --> 00:17:28.306 A:middle
This library provides you
with an Objective-C data model

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:30.666 A:middle
that represents all
of the user's media.

00:17:31.386 --> 00:17:35.446 A:middle
It's a read-only model so you
can only access the images

00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:37.426 A:middle
for showing in your app or
importing into your app.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.886 A:middle
It's also asynchronous
in the sense

00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:42.026 A:middle
that your application
doesn't have to be blocked

00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:44.056 A:middle
as you're rummaging
through library.

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:46.486 A:middle
And just to give
you a quick overview

00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:48.096 A:middle
of what this framework
looks like,

00:17:48.406 --> 00:17:49.766 A:middle
there are four principal
classes,

00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:52.276 A:middle
ML MediaLibrary represents
the library.

00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:56.066 A:middle
ML MediaSource represents
the individual applications

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
or source of images.

00:17:58.016 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
ML MediaGroup represents
groups that make sense

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.016 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
ML MediaGroup represents
groups that make sense

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:07.056 A:middle
within that source for
instance playlists or locations

00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:10.056 A:middle
or photo albums and so on.

00:18:10.236 --> 00:18:13.056 A:middle
And finally, ML MediaObject
represents individual

00:18:13.056 --> 00:18:13.956 A:middle
media objects.

00:18:14.236 --> 00:18:17.636 A:middle
This-- this class will
provide you with properties

00:18:17.636 --> 00:18:19.546 A:middle
of that object such
as the dimensions,

00:18:19.546 --> 00:18:20.816 A:middle
the length of the
movie, et cetera.

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.396 A:middle
In addition, that will
also return to you a URL

00:18:23.716 --> 00:18:26.246 A:middle
which you can use to
access the media object even

00:18:26.246 --> 00:18:27.616 A:middle
in SandBox applications.

00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:31.386 A:middle
Next, I want to talk about
block-based sheet presentation.

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:36.376 A:middle
As you know, blocks are a
feature we introduced in 10.6

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.666 A:middle
and since then we've been
incrementally updating our APIs

00:18:39.916 --> 00:18:41.346 A:middle
to take advantage of blocks.

00:18:41.346 --> 00:18:42.796 A:middle
In one area where
we haven't done that

00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:44.746 A:middle
yet is generalized
sheet presentation.

00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:48.366 A:middle
In 10.8 and earlier, if you
want to present the sheet

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:50.216 A:middle
in your application, here's
the code you would write.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:53.936 A:middle
You tell NS app to begin
a sheet you provide

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.346 A:middle
which Window the sheet
should be attached to

00:18:56.346 --> 00:18:59.266 A:middle
and then you provide a call
back in the form of a selector.

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.226 A:middle
And then you go ahead and
implement your selector.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.226 A:middle
And then you go ahead and
implement your selector.

00:19:01.926 --> 00:19:04.086 A:middle
And inside that selector,
inside that method,

00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:06.506 A:middle
you process whatever
the user chose.

00:19:07.116 --> 00:19:09.096 A:middle
So, you know it's pretty
powerful, pretty good stuff

00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:10.636 A:middle
but it does take a
few lines of code.

00:19:11.256 --> 00:19:12.946 A:middle
You know, not super convenient.

00:19:13.626 --> 00:19:16.016 A:middle
And in 10.9 here is
all you need to do.

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:18.466 A:middle
You tell the parent
window to show the sheet

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:20.786 A:middle
and then you execute the
code that should happen

00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:21.886 A:middle
when the sheet is dismissed.

00:19:22.346 --> 00:19:23.616 A:middle
So, that's really it.

00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:25.046 A:middle
So that's the code
you're writing here.

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:26.136 A:middle
So it's much better.

00:19:26.326 --> 00:19:28.516 A:middle
Now, this thing has
few other advantages.

00:19:28.516 --> 00:19:30.216 A:middle
This approach has
few other advantages.

00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:34.156 A:middle
For one thing, this version will
automatically dismiss the sheet.

00:19:34.156 --> 00:19:35.706 A:middle
You don't have to call
order out anymore.

00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:37.826 A:middle
When that completion
block is done,

00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:39.086 A:middle
the sheet will be dismissed.

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.226 A:middle
It will queue up multiple
sheets for presentation.

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:45.726 A:middle
Although it's not, you know,
UI we generally recommend,

00:19:46.086 --> 00:19:47.906 A:middle
sometimes some subsystems
might want

00:19:47.906 --> 00:19:49.336 A:middle
to show sheets one
after another.

00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:51.916 A:middle
And you all want those sheets
to appear on top of another

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:54.146 A:middle
which doesn't exactly
working all cases.

00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:55.636 A:middle
This one will actually
queue them

00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:57.946 A:middle
so as one sheet is dismissed,
the next one will appear.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.746 A:middle
Now, however, if you're
a subsystem and you want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.746 A:middle
Now, however, if you're
a subsystem and you want

00:20:02.816 --> 00:20:05.566 A:middle
that sheet of your stuff here
immediately for some reason,

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:08.276 A:middle
there is a big and critical
sheet completion handler

00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:09.836 A:middle
which will get your
sheet to cut--

00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:11.346 A:middle
you know, cut through
the line and up here

00:20:11.346 --> 00:20:11.976 A:middle
on top of everything else.

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:15.566 A:middle
Clearly this would only be
used for some serious errors,

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:16.596 A:middle
emergencies, whatever.

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:19.326 A:middle
But anyway yes you have
that API if needed.

00:20:19.706 --> 00:20:23.216 A:middle
One thing you saw yesterday at
the Keynote is our new support

00:20:23.216 --> 00:20:26.596 A:middle
for multiple monitors and I
mean, here we say full screen

00:20:26.596 --> 00:20:27.466 A:middle
for multi-monitors,

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:30.026 A:middle
it's actually goes way
beyond full screen as well.

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.296 A:middle
Let me just recap what
this feature looks like.

00:20:32.686 --> 00:20:37.056 A:middle
So, here we have a MacBook Pro
and a larger screen attached

00:20:37.056 --> 00:20:40.886 A:middle
to your MacBook Pro and as you
can see here both screens have a

00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:43.096 A:middle
Menu Bar that Safari
is running on this one

00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:45.096 A:middle
and iPhoto is running
on this one.

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:48.436 A:middle
So that the MacBook
Pro screen is active

00:20:48.906 --> 00:20:50.296 A:middle
because it's got
an active Menu Bar

00:20:50.296 --> 00:20:51.686 A:middle
and that's the active
application.

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:53.496 A:middle
If the user goes and
clicks on iPhoto,

00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:57.866 A:middle
the menu on the other screen
is now active and the menu

00:20:57.866 --> 00:20:59.896 A:middle
on the smaller screen is
now appearing inactive

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.796 A:middle
so that's you have a one active
screen at any given time.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.796 A:middle
so that's you have a one active
screen at any given time.

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:05.106 A:middle
So the user can go ahead
and interact with iPhoto put

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:08.916 A:middle
into full screen mode, go into
edit mode and in fact even put

00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:11.886 A:middle
into gorgeous full screen
editing mode like this,

00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:13.086 A:middle
fairly straightforward.

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:15.256 A:middle
They can also go ahead
and do the same thing

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:17.666 A:middle
on their other screen and put
Safari into full screen mode,

00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.976 A:middle
again all part of a
standard operation.

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:23.886 A:middle
They can also go ahead and just
switch between different spaces

00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:27.056 A:middle
on any screen they want as far
as they can switch the maps

00:21:27.056 --> 00:21:28.266 A:middle
or they can switch the pages

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:30.386 A:middle
or they can switch the
desktop screens and so on.

00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:33.346 A:middle
So it's very powerful,
very flexible environment

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:36.716 A:middle
and this is all controlled
with really just one setting.

00:21:37.156 --> 00:21:39.916 A:middle
If you launch Preferences
and go to Mission Control,

00:21:40.206 --> 00:21:41.456 A:middle
the setting here displays

00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:44.456 A:middle
out separate spaces is what
controls all this new behavior.

00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:46.746 A:middle
Now, users can go turn them off

00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:50.256 A:middle
in which case they get back
the 10.8 behaviors that--

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:53.146 A:middle
you know that we had in 10.8.

00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:56.006 A:middle
So this is a user choice

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:01.746 A:middle
and in this mode what happens
is each screen has its own set

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:01.746 A:middle
and in this mode what happens
is each screen has its own set

00:22:01.746 --> 00:22:03.626 A:middle
of spaces as you saw.

00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:05.886 A:middle
Each screen has its
own Menu Bar as you saw

00:22:06.026 --> 00:22:08.696 A:middle
and Windows do not span screens
so Window will either to be

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:11.206 A:middle
on one screen or the other
but not span screens.

00:22:11.536 --> 00:22:16.066 A:middle
Since this is a user choice
there's not much control your

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:18.866 A:middle
application has over it
and there are no new APIs.

00:22:19.156 --> 00:22:20.966 A:middle
There's some changes
in behaviors however.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.766 A:middle
For instance NS screen main
screen method will now return

00:22:24.966 --> 00:22:27.966 A:middle
the active screen and
active screen being defined

00:22:27.966 --> 00:22:31.416 A:middle
as the screen with
the Menu Bar on it.

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:34.086 A:middle
And resumed Windows and
resumed applications

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.846 A:middle
so these are state-restored
Windows,

00:22:36.086 --> 00:22:38.716 A:middle
will return to their previous
locations wherever they might be

00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:40.366 A:middle
on all the user screens

00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:43.906 A:middle
and newly opened Windows will
prefer the active screen.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.566 A:middle
So we believe these
behaviors will be appropriate

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:47.756 A:middle
for most applications.

00:22:48.396 --> 00:22:50.346 A:middle
If you get a chance, we'll pop

00:22:50.346 --> 00:22:52.436 A:middle
that second screen you're
carrying around in your bag

00:22:52.436 --> 00:22:53.606 A:middle
and try your applications.

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:55.336 A:middle
And if you don't happen
to bring a second screen,

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:58.286 A:middle
we do have some downstairs
in the labs and you can hook

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
up your portables
to those screens

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
up your portables
to those screens

00:23:00.766 --> 00:23:02.386 A:middle
and see how well your
applications work

00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:03.486 A:middle
in full screen modes.

00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:07.226 A:middle
So next thing I want to
mention is we have an updated

00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:07.966 A:middle
system font.

00:23:08.756 --> 00:23:12.086 A:middle
So how many of you noticed that
we have an updated system font?

00:23:12.486 --> 00:23:14.106 A:middle
I'm not talking about my iOS 7,

00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:15.696 A:middle
OK a few if you have
noticed that's good.

00:23:16.236 --> 00:23:19.626 A:middle
So, yeah we do have a
new font for UI Elements

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:21.886 A:middle
and it's actually not a
drastic change at all.

00:23:21.886 --> 00:23:25.746 A:middle
It's very similar to the font
we had before-- Lucida Grande.

00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:27.726 A:middle
It's optimized for
retina display

00:23:27.726 --> 00:23:29.146 A:middle
so they're just slight tweaks.

00:23:29.676 --> 00:23:31.756 A:middle
This font is-- it's-they're
slight tweaks

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:34.076 A:middle
but they're really not
significant enough at all

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:36.846 A:middle
where they will cause
rewrapping of text and so

00:23:36.846 --> 00:23:39.246 A:middle
on so we're pretty
certain that's the case.

00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
This font is not
intended for general use.

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:44.526 A:middle
This font is really just
a UI Optimized version

00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:47.156 A:middle
of Lucida Grande so any users
who are using Lucida Grande

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:48.166 A:middle
in their documents and so

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:50.786 A:middle
on will continue to
use Lucida Grande.

00:23:51.466 --> 00:23:55.606 A:middle
Now you're saying, "Hey, my
application is UI Elements.

00:23:55.756 --> 00:23:56.806 A:middle
How do I use this font?"

00:23:57.226 --> 00:23:59.726 A:middle
Well, it's pretty simple use it
the exact same way you've been

00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:00.456 A:middle
using before.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:00.456 A:middle
using before.

00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:03.296 A:middle
If you're calling NS
Font system font of size,

00:24:04.016 --> 00:24:07.926 A:middle
you will get this new
font now or in Xcode,

00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:11.926 A:middle
in the Attributes Inspector, if
you have selected system font

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:15.426 A:middle
which is by the way the default
in most cases and has been

00:24:15.426 --> 00:24:19.206 A:middle
for many years, the system
font here is the right one.

00:24:19.206 --> 00:24:20.516 A:middle
So if you're using this one,

00:24:20.796 --> 00:24:21.956 A:middle
you will be getting
the correct font.

00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:24.746 A:middle
So no worries, your applications
might already be using this font

00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:26.136 A:middle
properly in 10.9.

00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:29.096 A:middle
Now, if you ever
bring up a font panel

00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:33.016 A:middle
and to see this font
called Dot Lucida Grande UI,

00:24:33.016 --> 00:24:35.596 A:middle
just ignore it, it's not there.

00:24:37.336 --> 00:24:38.546 A:middle
We hope it will go away soon.

00:24:38.546 --> 00:24:40.666 A:middle
This is-- this might make an
appearance in a few places,

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.146 A:middle
this is not even a final name

00:24:42.146 --> 00:24:45.486 A:middle
or we don't know how this
will land but ignore this.

00:24:45.486 --> 00:24:46.656 A:middle
Don't reference it by name.

00:24:46.656 --> 00:24:48.826 A:middle
Again just use the system
font of size method.

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:55.166 A:middle
And I want to shift gears a bit
and talk a bit about App Nap

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:59.956 A:middle
which you also heard about
yesterday in the Keynote

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.196 A:middle
and also State of the Union.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.196 A:middle
and also State of the Union.

00:25:01.946 --> 00:25:05.156 A:middle
So App Nap is a new system
feature in OS X Mavericks

00:25:05.656 --> 00:25:10.096 A:middle
where the system will throttle,
non for grand applications

00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:11.736 A:middle
that are not doing useful work.

00:25:12.416 --> 00:25:14.986 A:middle
So now some of you are wondering
what this throttle means.

00:25:14.986 --> 00:25:18.316 A:middle
Some of you are wondering
what this useful work means so

00:25:18.826 --> 00:25:20.136 A:middle
and not for grand apps like--

00:25:20.136 --> 00:25:21.576 A:middle
'cause they have to
maybe is the question,

00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:23.276 A:middle
but anyway so there are a
bunch of questions here.

00:25:23.276 --> 00:25:24.116 A:middle
What do all of these mean?

00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:25.106 A:middle
How's it going to do to my app?

00:25:25.236 --> 00:25:26.466 A:middle
And that's maybe the
biggest question.

00:25:27.036 --> 00:25:29.556 A:middle
So first let me define
what throttle means,

00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:32.366 A:middle
the biggest thing about
throttling apps is

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:36.316 A:middle
that timers will be delayed
and they will be rate limited.

00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:40.736 A:middle
So once an app is decided
as not doing useful work,

00:25:40.736 --> 00:25:43.496 A:middle
it will be put into App
Nap mode and in this mode,

00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:48.046 A:middle
say the app has a timer to
set off to go in one second.

00:25:48.106 --> 00:25:49.606 A:middle
The timer might actually
not go off

00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:52.046 A:middle
for 10 seconds or
maybe even more.

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:54.556 A:middle
Let's say an application
is that timer that's set

00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:56.516 A:middle
to go 60 times a second.

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:00.616 A:middle
That timer will now start
going off every 10 seconds,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:00.616 A:middle
That timer will now start
going off every 10 seconds,

00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:03.456 A:middle
so you know it's really
going to be sleeping.

00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:06.536 A:middle
Another thing that
happens is apps

00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:09.446 A:middle
that are napping will have
lower I/O and CPU priorities.

00:26:09.746 --> 00:26:11.456 A:middle
So even when they're
executing code,

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.876 A:middle
their overall throughput
will be somewhat reduced.

00:26:13.876 --> 00:26:17.306 A:middle
Now it's not a drastic reduction
but it will be reduced compared

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:19.186 A:middle
to other applications, the
foreground applications

00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:20.476 A:middle
and not napping applications.

00:26:20.776 --> 00:26:24.176 A:middle
So the other question is, well
what does useful work mean?

00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:26.416 A:middle
Well so there are
some heuristics

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:29.766 A:middle
to determine useful work because
as you might guess it's not easy

00:26:29.766 --> 00:26:33.006 A:middle
to tell an application that's
using a hundred percent CPU

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:34.336 A:middle
and doing something useful

00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:36.646 A:middle
versus something that's
using hundred percent CPU

00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:37.866 A:middle
and not doing anything at all.

00:26:38.246 --> 00:26:39.386 A:middle
So here are our heuristics,

00:26:39.676 --> 00:26:42.926 A:middle
one is handling a user
event or an action method.

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:45.746 A:middle
So, if we find ourselves
that were in action method

00:26:45.746 --> 00:26:47.816 A:middle
in the main thread,
that's clearly as a result

00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:51.386 A:middle
of the user having hit a button
or chosen some Menu items

00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:53.126 A:middle
so that's presumably
useful work.

00:26:54.226 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
Drawing visibly, if the app
is actually drawing something

00:26:56.626 --> 00:27:00.036 A:middle
visibly while the user is seeing
that drawing so we really want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.626 --> 00:27:00.036 A:middle
visibly while the user is seeing
that drawing so we really want

00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:03.396 A:middle
that drawing to continue
playing audio as well

00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:05.856 A:middle
and the disabling system sleep.

00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:09.786 A:middle
Now some of you might be aware,
we have this API previously

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:12.696 A:middle
in fact power assertion API
where an application can say,

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:15.156 A:middle
"I want to disable
system sleep."

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:18.386 A:middle
This is where the system goes
to sleep after no activity.

00:27:18.556 --> 00:27:21.146 A:middle
Applications can disable that
and the reason they do that is

00:27:21.146 --> 00:27:23.106 A:middle
because they're doing some
long-running operations

00:27:23.106 --> 00:27:27.316 A:middle
such as exporting images or
doing something else long,

00:27:27.316 --> 00:27:28.866 A:middle
and then they don't want
the system to go to sleep.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:31.456 A:middle
So, we take that
as a hint to mean

00:27:31.456 --> 00:27:33.886 A:middle
that the app is doing useful
work and we disable App Nap

00:27:34.006 --> 00:27:35.746 A:middle
for the duration for
that application.

00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:38.916 A:middle
And finally we have some new
APIs that we'll talk about.

00:27:39.346 --> 00:27:43.146 A:middle
You can use APIs to declare
activity formally and then we--

00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:46.256 A:middle
of course say, "OK you're doing
useful work, useful activity,

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.346 A:middle
we won't put you to sleep."

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:50.926 A:middle
Now App Nap is automatically
applied to all applications.

00:27:50.996 --> 00:27:53.256 A:middle
In fact that's the
goal of App Nap.

00:27:54.346 --> 00:27:55.676 A:middle
You know, we know that
there are a lot of apps

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:58.596 A:middle
out there probably enough of
yours but there are a bunch

00:27:58.596 --> 00:28:00.866 A:middle
of apps out there that
do misbehave sometimes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.596 --> 00:28:00.866 A:middle
of apps out there that
do misbehave sometimes

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:02.606 A:middle
and they're sitting in the
background just chewing

00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:05.426 A:middle
through CPU-- you know maybe
well-intentioned purpose

00:28:05.426 --> 00:28:08.906 A:middle
but again they are still chewing
through CPU and we're going

00:28:09.156 --> 00:28:12.516 A:middle
to apply App Nap to all these
apps who haven't been updated

00:28:12.806 --> 00:28:15.486 A:middle
or who-- you know,
won't get updated maybe

00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:17.616 A:middle
for a few more months or years
or you know, the ones we want

00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:19.646 A:middle
to apply to all these apps
that's why we're applying--

00:28:20.086 --> 00:28:21.406 A:middle
you know, no opt-in required.

00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:24.346 A:middle
Apps will get App Nap however

00:28:24.676 --> 00:28:26.976 A:middle
if some applications
are misbehaving,

00:28:27.126 --> 00:28:29.726 A:middle
users can disable App
Nap for that application

00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:33.206 A:middle
by using the prevent
App Nap check box

00:28:33.306 --> 00:28:36.616 A:middle
in the File Info
Panel and Finder.

00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:38.776 A:middle
That will disable App Nap

00:28:38.836 --> 00:28:40.586 A:middle
for that version of
that application.

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:43.076 A:middle
Note that this check
box will go away,

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:46.066 A:middle
will vanish for applications
that are linked on 10.9

00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:49.566 A:middle
with the intent that when you
put up 10.9 linked versions

00:28:49.566 --> 00:28:53.076 A:middle
of your applications, they're
hopefully App Nap savvy

00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:56.016 A:middle
and users don't have to turn off
App Nap for those applications

00:28:56.016 --> 00:28:57.586 A:middle
so that's something
to look into.

00:28:58.026 --> 00:29:01.106 A:middle
Now earlier I mentioned
activity APIs,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.026 --> 00:29:01.106 A:middle
Now earlier I mentioned
activity APIs,

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:03.166 A:middle
let me just give a
quick overview of those.

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:07.366 A:middle
These APIs allow you to declare
the activities your application

00:29:07.396 --> 00:29:07.966 A:middle
is doing.

00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:11.306 A:middle
APIs are in process info.

00:29:12.356 --> 00:29:13.066 A:middle
Here's one of them.

00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:14.546 A:middle
Perform activity with options.

00:29:15.306 --> 00:29:18.296 A:middle
I'll talk about the options,
a recent string which is used

00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:19.816 A:middle
for debugging end the block

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:22.356 A:middle
and this is the Activity
Block that's being executed.

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:25.146 A:middle
Now if you can't represent
your activity as a block,

00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:27.396 A:middle
you can also call the
Begin and End methods

00:29:27.396 --> 00:29:28.876 A:middle
which are also on process info.

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:31.636 A:middle
So let me talk a little
bit about those options,

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.406 A:middle
those options that
you specify the kind

00:29:33.406 --> 00:29:34.716 A:middle
of activity that's happening.

00:29:35.136 --> 00:29:38.716 A:middle
One common one is NS
Activity user-initiated.

00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:42.016 A:middle
This is simply an activity where
the user wanted to do something.

00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:45.896 A:middle
They hit some button;
they chose some Menu item

00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:48.386 A:middle
so something is happening
clearly the app should finish

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.296 A:middle
that even if app is
not in the foreground.

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:53.256 A:middle
Another example is activity
user-initiated allowing

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:54.016 A:middle
system sleep.

00:29:54.366 --> 00:29:55.476 A:middle
An example of this is

00:29:55.476 --> 00:29:58.086 A:middle
for instance an application
that's sitting there constantly

00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.076 A:middle
giving you stock price updates.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.076 A:middle
giving you stock price updates.

00:30:00.076 --> 00:30:01.376 A:middle
The user might have
initiated that.

00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:04.886 A:middle
However, such an application
typically would not prevent

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:07.396 A:middle
system idle sleep because it's
an application that's just

00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:08.976 A:middle
giving their-- showing
some status update.

00:30:10.006 --> 00:30:13.046 A:middle
Another example is
activate the background.

00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:14.216 A:middle
That's the kind of activity

00:30:14.216 --> 00:30:16.006 A:middle
that the user did not
necessarily initiate

00:30:16.296 --> 00:30:19.316 A:middle
but it should still
continue but maybe some--

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:22.046 A:middle
the system should still
be apply some heuristics

00:30:22.046 --> 00:30:23.476 A:middle
to lower power usage.

00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:25.776 A:middle
But however, it's
still is something

00:30:25.776 --> 00:30:28.806 A:middle
that the app should not go to
App Nap during this activity.

00:30:28.806 --> 00:30:31.526 A:middle
An example of this is for
instance indexing in Xcode

00:30:31.846 --> 00:30:36.226 A:middle
or thumbnail generation
in an app like Aperture.

00:30:36.496 --> 00:30:38.686 A:middle
These are not things that
the user directly initiates

00:30:39.026 --> 00:30:41.056 A:middle
but these are things that
are being done on behalf

00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:42.866 A:middle
of the user, so they
should really complete.

00:30:43.526 --> 00:30:45.026 A:middle
There are a bunch of more
activities and you can look

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:46.536 A:middle
at header files to see
what they're about.

00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:48.726 A:middle
Now, app nap is something
that's applied

00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:50.986 A:middle
to non-foreground
apps automatically.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:54.396 A:middle
We also have some APIs that
let you control some of these,

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:56.566 A:middle
some of these facilities
explicitly.

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.556 A:middle
Timer tolerance APIs
are one of them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.416 --> 00:31:02.816 A:middle
So, NSTimer now is
property called tolerance

00:31:03.146 --> 00:31:06.636 A:middle
and that lets you specify the
amount of delay you're willing

00:31:06.636 --> 00:31:07.916 A:middle
to tolerate on the timer.

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:11.976 A:middle
So, the timer can fire by
up to that much time later

00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:13.486 A:middle
than the time it specified for.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:17.306 A:middle
So, the benefits here are
that this allows the system

00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:19.996 A:middle
to synchronize timers
across the system

00:31:20.236 --> 00:31:22.366 A:middle
so they're firing
at the same time.

00:31:22.366 --> 00:31:25.996 A:middle
And this as you saw yesterday
during the Keynote increases the

00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:30.356 A:middle
amount of time that the CPU
is idle which in turn impacts,

00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:32.016 A:middle
improves battery life.

00:31:32.476 --> 00:31:33.996 A:middle
So, let me show you an example

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:36.276 A:middle
of how timers work
with tolerance.

00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.326 A:middle
So, here is a very
simple timer called

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:41.326 A:middle
without tolerance you're
creating at one time,

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:44.036 A:middle
one shot timer to
fire in two seconds.

00:31:44.476 --> 00:31:47.276 A:middle
And here is our timeline,
the timer will fire there.

00:31:47.746 --> 00:31:50.126 A:middle
Now, note that despite
the flaming graphics,

00:31:50.206 --> 00:31:51.256 A:middle
timers don't really fire.

00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:52.826 A:middle
But anyway, so, it will--

00:31:52.826 --> 00:31:54.546 A:middle
the timer will kick-off
at 2 seconds.

00:31:54.776 --> 00:31:57.066 A:middle
Now, if you were to go ahead
and provide the tolerance

00:31:57.236 --> 00:32:00.656 A:middle
of 1 second, then the
timer can fire anywhere

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.236 --> 00:32:00.656 A:middle
of 1 second, then the
timer can fire anywhere

00:32:00.656 --> 00:32:02.536 A:middle
between 2 to 3 seconds.

00:32:02.966 --> 00:32:06.726 A:middle
And then if you're to go ahead
and create a repeating timer

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:10.256 A:middle
with that 2-second time period
but a 1-second tolerance,

00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:12.826 A:middle
the first time you'll
fire is here,

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:16.006 A:middle
the second time you'll
fire is from 4 to 5

00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:17.876 A:middle
and the third time,
6 to 7 and so on.

00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:20.296 A:middle
So as you noticed, the
timer isn't really drifting.

00:32:20.296 --> 00:32:21.996 A:middle
It's still firing
every 2 seconds.

00:32:22.346 --> 00:32:25.496 A:middle
However, the fire time might
be delayed by up to 1 second.

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:28.706 A:middle
Another set of API's
we're giving you is the

00:32:28.706 --> 00:32:29.366 A:middle
occlusion APIs.

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:32.466 A:middle
You can now tell whether
Windows are visible or not

00:32:32.756 --> 00:32:35.576 A:middle
and the advantage here is
by telling that a Window

00:32:35.576 --> 00:32:38.236 A:middle
that you're drawing something
into is not visible to the user.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:41.436 A:middle
You can actually stop doing
the work of drawing stuff

00:32:41.436 --> 00:32:44.256 A:middle
and maybe even stop doing some
other work that's supporting

00:32:44.256 --> 00:32:45.006 A:middle
that drawing work.

00:32:45.356 --> 00:32:47.706 A:middle
This API exist on NSWindow
and NSAapplication.

00:32:47.706 --> 00:32:50.276 A:middle
You can tell what the
occlusion state of a Window is.

00:32:50.746 --> 00:32:52.486 A:middle
And there also notifications
that tell you

00:32:52.486 --> 00:32:54.566 A:middle
when that occlusion
state to changes.

00:32:55.816 --> 00:32:57.846 A:middle
We do have a whole talk
dedicated to App Nap.

00:32:58.436 --> 00:33:01.126 A:middle
That's tomorrow morning
at 10:15,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.436 --> 00:33:01.126 A:middle
That's tomorrow morning
at 10:15,

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:03.336 A:middle
"Improving Power
Efficiency with App Nap."

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.896 A:middle
In addition we have a lab
right after that Cocoa

00:33:07.896 --> 00:33:11.046 A:middle
and Foundation Lab where you can
ask App Nap questions as well

00:33:11.046 --> 00:33:13.306 A:middle
as any other foundation or
Cocoa questions in fact.

00:33:13.836 --> 00:33:15.366 A:middle
And then we have one more talk.

00:33:15.506 --> 00:33:16.676 A:middle
We actually have a lot of talks

00:33:16.676 --> 00:33:18.706 A:middle
about battery life
and power and so on.

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.056 A:middle
But one that you might
have missed this morning

00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:23.946 A:middle
at 11:30 is maximizing
battery life on OS X

00:33:24.296 --> 00:33:27.466 A:middle
which is a great overview of
this effort and it's given by,

00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:30.256 A:middle
it was given by Bud
Tribble, vice president

00:33:30.256 --> 00:33:31.446 A:middle
of Software Technology.

00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:36.366 A:middle
Bud was also one of the original
designers of Mac OS in fact.

00:33:36.626 --> 00:33:37.936 A:middle
So, if you haven't seen

00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:39.746 A:middle
that talk you might want
to catch it on video.

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.206 A:middle
So the next thing I want to talk

00:33:41.206 --> 00:33:43.186 A:middle
about is another new
facility we've added

00:33:43.226 --> 00:33:44.446 A:middle
to foundation called
the progress,

00:33:44.446 --> 00:33:45.786 A:middle
supporting and cancellation.

00:33:46.256 --> 00:33:50.216 A:middle
This is a new facility for
reporting progress of work.

00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:56.846 A:middle
It also allows the progress
to be presented to the user

00:33:57.146 --> 00:34:00.906 A:middle
and for the user to cancel
the work that's represented

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.146 --> 00:34:00.906 A:middle
and for the user to cancel
the work that's represented

00:34:00.936 --> 00:34:01.846 A:middle
by that progress.

00:34:01.936 --> 00:34:05.966 A:middle
And now, this facility
has got some aspects,

00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:09.815 A:middle
it's loosely coupled
meaning the subsystem

00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:12.076 A:middle
that is reporting
progress doesn't know

00:34:12.076 --> 00:34:14.896 A:middle
about the subsystems that might
be displaying that progress.

00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:17.436 A:middle
This facility is composable

00:34:17.436 --> 00:34:19.786 A:middle
across layers meaning
different layers

00:34:19.786 --> 00:34:23.556 A:middle
of software can be generating
progress in their own terms

00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:26.136 A:middle
and they might not even be aware
of other layers of the system.

00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:29.126 A:middle
For instance, the user
might say" Go ahead

00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:32.636 A:middle
and compress this
folder full of images."

00:34:33.096 --> 00:34:37.446 A:middle
So, at the top level we're
processing 42 images,

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:40.116 A:middle
one image out of 42, two
images out of 42 et cetera.

00:34:40.346 --> 00:34:43.746 A:middle
But at the lower layer as each
image is being processed it's

00:34:43.746 --> 00:34:45.156 A:middle
running through a
Scanline so kind

00:34:45.156 --> 00:34:47.606 A:middle
of Scanline100 and
101 et cetera.

00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:49.835 A:middle
And each layer reports
progress in its own terms

00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:51.386 A:middle
but it's composed across layers.

00:34:51.525 --> 00:34:53.516 A:middle
And this is also across process.

00:34:53.856 --> 00:34:59.556 A:middle
One-- process the application
that's reporting progress might

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
be different than the
one that's observing it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
be different than the
one that's observing it.

00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:03.316 A:middle
A great example of
this is Safari

00:35:03.796 --> 00:35:05.306 A:middle
which is downloading a file.

00:35:05.396 --> 00:35:09.026 A:middle
It's reporting progress of
that download but Finder

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.606 A:middle
or Dock can be observing
that progress

00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:14.566 A:middle
and showing actually how much
of that download is finished.

00:35:14.566 --> 00:35:17.146 A:middle
And in fact that those
facilities do use NS Progress

00:35:17.586 --> 00:35:18.236 A:middle
in the system.

00:35:18.466 --> 00:35:19.796 A:middle
So let me give you
a quick example

00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:21.286 A:middle
of how you use NS Progress.

00:35:21.556 --> 00:35:24.096 A:middle
Here's a simple method
which does some work.

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:27.736 A:middle
It runs through an array
of stuff just one by one

00:35:27.736 --> 00:35:29.266 A:middle
and it processes the items

00:35:29.266 --> 00:35:30.896 A:middle
in the array fairly
straightforward.

00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:32.826 A:middle
If you want to make
this progress savvy,

00:35:33.126 --> 00:35:34.946 A:middle
you would insert these
two lines of code.

00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:37.616 A:middle
One of them goes and
creates an NS Progress object

00:35:38.026 --> 00:35:41.636 A:middle
and you specify a total unit
count for an array of elements,

00:35:41.986 --> 00:35:44.236 A:middle
the number of elements in an
array is a perfect unit account

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:46.276 A:middle
for a file, the byte count

00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:49.046 A:middle
of the file might be the
unit count to use and so on.

00:35:49.786 --> 00:35:51.706 A:middle
And then each time through
the loop we go ahead

00:35:51.706 --> 00:35:53.296 A:middle
and set the completed
unit count.

00:35:53.906 --> 00:35:57.026 A:middle
We increment the completed unit
count to indicate we're done

00:35:57.026 --> 00:35:59.086 A:middle
with one more item, so
fairly straightforward.

00:35:59.496 --> 00:36:02.326 A:middle
Now, you can also go to the next
step and make those cancelable.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.496 --> 00:36:02.326 A:middle
Now, you can also go to the next
step and make those cancelable.

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:04.636 A:middle
To do that, you would
go ahead and say

00:36:04.636 --> 00:36:08.396 A:middle
if the progress is canceled then
you go ahead and exit the loop

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:10.446 A:middle
with an appropriate
canceled error.

00:36:10.906 --> 00:36:12.476 A:middle
Of course, this would
also indicate

00:36:12.476 --> 00:36:14.766 A:middle
that you would tell the
progress that's cancelable

00:36:14.766 --> 00:36:18.146 A:middle
and that upper levels would
provide the ability for the user

00:36:18.146 --> 00:36:19.326 A:middle
to cancel the progress.

00:36:19.666 --> 00:36:21.716 A:middle
But you know, you can just
add this code here as a way

00:36:21.716 --> 00:36:23.966 A:middle
to say that, "hey, I know
about cancellation I'll deal

00:36:23.966 --> 00:36:24.916 A:middle
with it if the user did."

00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:28.196 A:middle
Observing progress is also
fairly straightforward.

00:36:28.596 --> 00:36:32.436 A:middle
There are properties
such as total unit count,

00:36:32.436 --> 00:36:34.656 A:middle
completed unit count,
fraction completed

00:36:34.656 --> 00:36:36.816 A:middle
that you can display in your UI.

00:36:37.006 --> 00:36:39.376 A:middle
There's also a localized
description that's generated

00:36:39.376 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
fairly generically or
it might be specialized

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.216 A:middle
by whoever is generating
the progress.

00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:44.906 A:middle
In addition, there
are other properties

00:36:44.906 --> 00:36:47.296 A:middle
such as whether the
progress is in determinant

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:49.186 A:middle
and of course whether
it's cancelable or not.

00:36:49.646 --> 00:36:52.316 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier,
an example of you know,

00:36:52.316 --> 00:36:54.506 A:middle
observing progress
is a finder window

00:36:54.506 --> 00:36:57.486 A:middle
where this file is being
either copied or downloaded

00:36:57.806 --> 00:37:00.886 A:middle
but the little bar at the
bottom is showing the progress

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:57.806 --> 00:37:00.886 A:middle
but the little bar at the
bottom is showing the progress

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:02.276 A:middle
and the X in the corner there

00:37:02.276 --> 00:37:03.936 A:middle
in the upper left
corner is showing you

00:37:03.936 --> 00:37:05.486 A:middle
that it's a cancelable progress.

00:37:05.486 --> 00:37:08.716 A:middle
So the user can click it at any
point to stop the operation.

00:37:08.996 --> 00:37:11.436 A:middle
So the next thing I want to talk
about is date and time handling.

00:37:11.826 --> 00:37:13.386 A:middle
And this is a favorite
topic of ours

00:37:13.386 --> 00:37:17.476 A:middle
because I think we've talked
about this every WWDC for a few,

00:37:17.476 --> 00:37:19.736 A:middle
for the last few years now it's

00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:21.546 A:middle
because current calendar
computations turned

00:37:21.546 --> 00:37:22.186 A:middle
out to be hard.

00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:24.976 A:middle
They're hard because there
are different calendar systems

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:25.896 A:middle
in use around the world.

00:37:25.896 --> 00:37:27.836 A:middle
They're hard because there
are daylight savings.

00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:30.346 A:middle
They're hard there because of
their time zones and so on.

00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:32.256 A:middle
So there are a lot of little
complications involved

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:33.506 A:middle
in current calendar
computations.

00:37:34.186 --> 00:37:36.336 A:middle
So to help with this, we
provided a bunch more APIs.

00:37:36.336 --> 00:37:38.846 A:middle
And I'm just going to
touch upon a few of them.

00:37:39.576 --> 00:37:42.416 A:middle
Some of the APIs are
just what we would refer

00:37:42.416 --> 00:37:43.956 A:middle
to as communions APIs.

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:46.926 A:middle
They just give you very
simple one-line ways

00:37:46.926 --> 00:37:50.436 A:middle
to achieve some things that
might have been few lines before

00:37:50.436 --> 00:37:52.046 A:middle
or maybe in fact
more lines in fact.

00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:53.736 A:middle
And there might have
been hidden pitfalls.

00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:55.696 A:middle
An example is just
asking a question

00:37:55.696 --> 00:37:57.296 A:middle
like "is date in today?"

00:37:57.706 --> 00:38:00.316 A:middle
Is this NSDate object
some time in today?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.706 --> 00:38:00.316 A:middle
Is this NSDate object
some time in today?

00:38:00.896 --> 00:38:03.196 A:middle
One-line call now to your
appropriate calendar.

00:38:03.856 --> 00:38:05.726 A:middle
Another one is this
date in the weekend.

00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:08.596 A:middle
That's you know that's not
getting fairly powerful

00:38:08.596 --> 00:38:11.536 A:middle
because you know definition of
weekend might change depending

00:38:11.536 --> 00:38:14.036 A:middle
on what calendar and what
part of the world you are.

00:38:14.666 --> 00:38:18.266 A:middle
Another call along the same
lines "is date equal to date"

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:20.286 A:middle
in unit ground [inaudible]
in this case,

00:38:20.286 --> 00:38:23.206 A:middle
it will tell you whether two
dates are within the same month

00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:25.816 A:middle
in that calendar
system and so on.

00:38:25.876 --> 00:38:28.426 A:middle
There's a bunch of methods here
I would encourage you to go look

00:38:28.426 --> 00:38:30.936 A:middle
at the header file to
see what we've all added.

00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:33.636 A:middle
We also have a bunch of
new enumeration APIs here.

00:38:34.226 --> 00:38:35.786 A:middle
And again, I will just--

00:38:35.786 --> 00:38:38.416 A:middle
I want to go through them all
just show you one of them.

00:38:39.446 --> 00:38:41.246 A:middle
Enumerate dates starting
after date.

00:38:42.046 --> 00:38:45.476 A:middle
Now, this method here will
enumerate dates you are

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:47.756 A:middle
providing a date
components instance

00:38:47.756 --> 00:38:49.846 A:middle
which represents your
enumeration parameters.

00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:54.326 A:middle
And then options parameter which
represents what to do in case

00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:55.896 A:middle
of various exceptional cases.

00:38:56.446 --> 00:38:57.696 A:middle
Let me give you a quick example.

00:38:58.956 --> 00:39:01.916 A:middle
Let's say you want to create
NSDate representing 2:30 a.m.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.956 --> 00:39:01.916 A:middle
Let's say you want to create
NSDate representing 2:30 a.m.

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:02.696 A:middle
every day.

00:39:03.826 --> 00:39:06.266 A:middle
You'd create a date
components object set the hour

00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:08.276 A:middle
and the minute like
this to 2 and 30.

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.596 A:middle
And then you would ask
your current calendar

00:39:11.596 --> 00:39:13.526 A:middle
which is usually the
most appropriate calendar

00:39:13.796 --> 00:39:14.296 A:middle
to enumerate.

00:39:14.656 --> 00:39:15.726 A:middle
So fairly straightforward

00:39:16.136 --> 00:39:19.466 A:middle
and you would start NSDate
date it's right now June 11th

00:39:19.466 --> 00:39:24.006 A:middle
at 4 p.m. So, you start running
this program and it will report

00:39:24.036 --> 00:39:27.096 A:middle
to you June 12th at 2:30
a.m. so on and so forth.

00:39:27.316 --> 00:39:30.596 A:middle
March 8th 2:30 a.m.,
March 9th at 3 a.m.

00:39:30.596 --> 00:39:33.236 A:middle
And it will continue
on reporting 2:30.

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:36.596 A:middle
So what happened there on
March 9th, I think most

00:39:36.596 --> 00:39:37.936 A:middle
of you already can guess it's

00:39:38.036 --> 00:39:39.976 A:middle
when daylight savings
time happens here

00:39:39.976 --> 00:39:40.996 A:middle
in the United States.

00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:43.436 A:middle
So the algorithm chose
to give you 3 o'clock

00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:45.746 A:middle
but it also told you that
the time was not exact.

00:39:46.246 --> 00:39:48.206 A:middle
So you know that
something went wrong.

00:39:48.666 --> 00:39:51.666 A:middle
So where did the 3
o'clock come from?

00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:53.086 A:middle
Well, it came from
this argument here,

00:39:53.086 --> 00:39:54.666 A:middle
NSCalendar match next time.

00:39:54.946 --> 00:39:58.356 A:middle
This option tells you that if
this given time doesn't exist

00:39:58.356 --> 00:40:00.246 A:middle
and in this case of
course there's no 2:30

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.356 --> 00:40:00.246 A:middle
and in this case of
course there's no 2:30

00:40:00.246 --> 00:40:02.736 A:middle
on March 9th time
jumps from 2 a.m.

00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:03.826 A:middle
to 3 a.m. just give
me the next time.

00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:04.686 A:middle
So it gives you 3 a.m.

00:40:05.276 --> 00:40:10.246 A:middle
There are other options which
give you other choices like 3:30

00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:12.796 A:middle
or 1:30 or maybe it doesn't
give you a return result at all

00:40:12.796 --> 00:40:14.176 A:middle
and just generates
an error instead.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:18.956 A:middle
So to find out more about the
various challenges and issues

00:40:18.956 --> 00:40:22.196 A:middle
and the various solutions we've
come up with, and to hear more

00:40:22.196 --> 00:40:24.066 A:middle
about these options in
this enumeration case.

00:40:24.066 --> 00:40:26.856 A:middle
You can go to this talk
on Friday at 11:30,

00:40:27.266 --> 00:40:29.656 A:middle
Solutions to Common Date
and Time Challenges.

00:40:29.726 --> 00:40:30.656 A:middle
You know, there are a lot

00:40:30.656 --> 00:40:32.746 A:middle
of hard things actually it
turns out in programing.

00:40:32.746 --> 00:40:35.036 A:middle
Another thing that's
hard is handling plurals.

00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:39.066 A:middle
Now, many of you might say,
"what's hard with that?,

00:40:39.306 --> 00:40:44.376 A:middle
I wrote this code" you know,
if N equals one, yes you know,

00:40:44.376 --> 00:40:48.296 A:middle
there is one and if otherwise
you know percent D files are

00:40:48.296 --> 00:40:48.976 A:middle
selected right?

00:40:48.976 --> 00:40:51.336 A:middle
So many of us are either
proud of within this--

00:40:51.476 --> 00:40:53.296 A:middle
having this code,
or maybe guilty

00:40:53.296 --> 00:40:54.296 A:middle
of having written this code?

00:40:54.696 --> 00:40:57.466 A:middle
So this code is actually fine
for English but it doesn't work

00:40:57.466 --> 00:40:59.346 A:middle
in other languages,
most other languages.

00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:02.186 A:middle
For instance, even French
turns out, treats zero

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:02.186 A:middle
For instance, even French
turns out, treats zero

00:41:02.186 --> 00:41:05.486 A:middle
and one differently
than the plural cases.

00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:07.926 A:middle
While in English, zero is
treated like the plural case.

00:41:08.306 --> 00:41:11.436 A:middle
And forget about Arabic,
here's what you get,

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:15.046 A:middle
you get six different cases and
I'm not even going to you know,

00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:16.016 A:middle
run through this code.

00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:17.836 A:middle
But it's not simple
and so if you are going

00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:19.626 A:middle
to write a properly
localized application

00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:23.156 A:middle
that handles all these cases,
there's a lot of if statements

00:41:23.156 --> 00:41:24.926 A:middle
and a lot of localizations
we're having to deal with.

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:29.816 A:middle
So, we have a solution
for this in foundation

00:41:30.176 --> 00:41:32.606 A:middle
and we call it localized
Populous File

00:41:32.856 --> 00:41:36.576 A:middle
and it was also known as
strings dict resource files.

00:41:37.216 --> 00:41:39.506 A:middle
Those of you familiar with the
way we do localization know

00:41:39.506 --> 00:41:40.846 A:middle
that we have strings file.

00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:44.506 A:middle
Strings dict files as you
can guess is just a glorified

00:41:44.506 --> 00:41:46.876 A:middle
strings file which actually
contains the full-fledged

00:41:46.926 --> 00:41:47.966 A:middle
dictionary in there.

00:41:48.536 --> 00:41:52.616 A:middle
It provides localized
forms based on plurality

00:41:52.686 --> 00:41:54.496 A:middle
as I showed and also gender.

00:41:54.566 --> 00:41:57.726 A:middle
It turns out gender, most of
you know isn't easy either.

00:41:57.866 --> 00:41:59.646 A:middle
Some languages have
one, some have two,

00:41:59.646 --> 00:42:01.376 A:middle
turns out some have
even more like up

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.646 --> 00:42:01.376 A:middle
turns out some have
even more like up

00:42:01.376 --> 00:42:02.996 A:middle
to five in some languages.

00:42:03.436 --> 00:42:05.256 A:middle
And you know, and who
knows what will happen

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.746 A:middle
when you discover an
alien race with 10 sexes?

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:09.736 A:middle
So gender is not easy OK?

00:42:10.336 --> 00:42:13.206 A:middle
So anyway the good thing
here is there's no new API

00:42:13.386 --> 00:42:14.046 A:middle
to do any of this.

00:42:14.046 --> 00:42:15.836 A:middle
You just have in fact one
code of path, for instance,

00:42:15.836 --> 00:42:17.146 A:middle
here's a kind of
code you might write.

00:42:17.596 --> 00:42:20.376 A:middle
Just localize a string,
percent D files selected,

00:42:20.376 --> 00:42:21.656 A:middle
it's a nice generic string,

00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:24.676 A:middle
it'll work in case no
localization exist.

00:42:24.676 --> 00:42:26.796 A:middle
It's clearly suboptimal
but it will work.

00:42:27.206 --> 00:42:29.066 A:middle
However if this was
properly localized,

00:42:29.976 --> 00:42:32.726 A:middle
here is what the
localization would look like.

00:42:33.766 --> 00:42:37.536 A:middle
So let's look at a strings
file, the strings dict file.

00:42:38.096 --> 00:42:39.756 A:middle
First of all, avert your eyes

00:42:39.756 --> 00:42:41.146 A:middle
because there are
a lot of XML here.

00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:44.456 A:middle
And XML, you know
is this ugly glass

00:42:44.456 --> 00:42:46.016 A:middle
that makes everything
look unattractive.

00:42:46.416 --> 00:42:50.316 A:middle
So let's hide all this stuff
and maybe just pull out the guts

00:42:50.316 --> 00:42:51.436 A:middle
of what we're trying to look at.

00:42:51.766 --> 00:42:53.666 A:middle
So the string we're
localizing is up here,

00:42:53.666 --> 00:42:55.136 A:middle
percent D file selected.

00:42:55.436 --> 00:42:57.396 A:middle
It's been localized
into this string.

00:42:57.906 --> 00:43:01.946 A:middle
File count selected and that
substring file count is actually

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.906 --> 00:43:01.946 A:middle
File count selected and that
substring file count is actually

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.586 A:middle
being selected out of
this dictionary here.

00:43:03.586 --> 00:43:06.236 A:middle
Either the substring if file is

00:43:06.236 --> 00:43:08.616 A:middle
or the substring
percent D files are based

00:43:08.616 --> 00:43:10.786 A:middle
on the number we
have is one or other.

00:43:11.196 --> 00:43:12.936 A:middle
This works for the English case

00:43:12.936 --> 00:43:14.666 A:middle
and this is the English
strings dict file.

00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:18.276 A:middle
However, if the same
situation was being localized

00:43:18.276 --> 00:43:21.816 A:middle
for other languages, there would
be other cases here such as zero

00:43:21.816 --> 00:43:24.626 A:middle
or two or few or many,
which would apply

00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:26.616 A:middle
to different localizations
and different languages.

00:43:26.616 --> 00:43:30.296 A:middle
So this is the way that we
handle localizations now if you,

00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.516 A:middle
and it's a manner
of just you know,

00:43:33.516 --> 00:43:35.156 A:middle
coming up with the
current localization files

00:43:35.156 --> 00:43:36.926 A:middle
which can be done of
course in parallel

00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:38.086 A:middle
to your application development.

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.606 A:middle
So I'm going to talk a
bit about instance type.

00:43:40.606 --> 00:43:42.456 A:middle
Instance type is a
feature we introduced

00:43:42.456 --> 00:43:44.496 A:middle
in 10.8 in objective C.

00:43:44.766 --> 00:43:46.026 A:middle
Instance type indicates

00:43:46.026 --> 00:43:48.936 A:middle
that a method returns an
instance of its receiver.

00:43:49.276 --> 00:43:50.726 A:middle
And you might already
be familiar with it.

00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:53.086 A:middle
It's already applied
implicitly to methods

00:43:53.086 --> 00:43:54.776 A:middle
such as ELAC, NEW and INIT.

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:57.846 A:middle
Although these are not the
declarations you see in 10.8.

00:43:57.926 --> 00:44:00.646 A:middle
SDKs, this is the way
it works implicitly.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.926 --> 00:44:00.646 A:middle
SDKs, this is the way
it works implicitly.

00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:04.506 A:middle
So this means that when you
send NSArray and ELAC method,

00:44:05.256 --> 00:44:08.126 A:middle
the return now is
implicitly assumed

00:44:08.126 --> 00:44:09.526 A:middle
to be an instance of NSArray.

00:44:09.806 --> 00:44:12.256 A:middle
So this is applied only to
a very few methods in 10.8

00:44:12.576 --> 00:44:15.246 A:middle
because many other methods
are not implicitly done.

00:44:15.246 --> 00:44:19.386 A:middle
But in 10.9, we've declared this
on many more methods in a number

00:44:19.386 --> 00:44:23.446 A:middle
of foundation classes including
NSString, NSDictinary, NSSet,

00:44:24.246 --> 00:44:28.586 A:middle
NSDate etc. So let me just
show you how this helps you.

00:44:29.716 --> 00:44:34.286 A:middle
Here is a line of code which
some people might have written

00:44:34.286 --> 00:44:36.796 A:middle
at some point, probably
nobody in this room.

00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:40.006 A:middle
And I'm just going
to put a big X on it

00:44:40.006 --> 00:44:42.316 A:middle
because there's a giant
error in this line of code.

00:44:42.696 --> 00:44:44.036 A:middle
And you know, you're saying

00:44:44.036 --> 00:44:48.166 A:middle
of NSMutableSet mySet
equals NSMutableArray array.

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:52.296 A:middle
Now the thing is so, in 10.8,
the compiler says OK, whatever.

00:44:52.716 --> 00:44:54.706 A:middle
It doesn't even generate
a warning.

00:44:55.766 --> 00:44:56.906 A:middle
And that's because
the arraignment

00:44:56.906 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
to the 10.8 is declared to
return ID so the compiler think

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:56.906 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
to the 10.8 is declared to
return ID so the compiler think

00:45:00.026 --> 00:45:00.886 A:middle
that it's a good match here.

00:45:01.456 --> 00:45:04.176 A:middle
Now, what's even sadder
is that if you go ahead

00:45:04.176 --> 00:45:07.206 A:middle
and write the next line
like this, mySet add object,

00:45:07.426 --> 00:45:10.746 A:middle
this also works because add
objects happens to exist both

00:45:10.746 --> 00:45:12.806 A:middle
in NSMutableArray
and NSMutableSet.

00:45:13.196 --> 00:45:14.276 A:middle
So now you've written a code

00:45:14.306 --> 00:45:17.036 A:middle
which is totally not
doing what you intended.

00:45:17.036 --> 00:45:21.056 A:middle
But it is working and the
bad thing is this will work

00:45:21.336 --> 00:45:23.966 A:middle
with a number of
items like 5, 10, 20.

00:45:24.236 --> 00:45:26.066 A:middle
But you know, as you add
more items to the array,

00:45:26.066 --> 00:45:28.056 A:middle
instead of getting
set characteristics

00:45:28.056 --> 00:45:29.326 A:middle
that you might have
been expecting,

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:31.056 A:middle
you will be getting
array characteristics.

00:45:31.056 --> 00:45:33.196 A:middle
So your performance
will be suddenly showing

00:45:33.746 --> 00:45:34.576 A:middle
weird behaviors.

00:45:34.576 --> 00:45:39.996 A:middle
So, the bottom-line in 10.8, the
compiler is happy, no complaints

00:45:39.996 --> 00:45:41.026 A:middle
and the Apps seems to work.

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:43.576 A:middle
In 10.9, here's what
the compiler will do,

00:45:43.576 --> 00:45:44.816 A:middle
it will give you a big warning,

00:45:45.236 --> 00:45:47.426 A:middle
telling you yes,
something's wrong.

00:45:47.826 --> 00:45:49.886 A:middle
You won't be clapping
actually once you complied your

00:45:49.886 --> 00:45:52.336 A:middle
applications on 10.9
and get warnings.

00:45:52.926 --> 00:45:57.326 A:middle
However, it's very important to
pay attention to these warnings

00:45:57.326 --> 00:46:00.066 A:middle
because we found out
many cases where we--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:57.326 --> 00:46:00.066 A:middle
because we found out
many cases where we--

00:46:00.146 --> 00:46:01.686 A:middle
we've gotten warnings
due to this,

00:46:01.686 --> 00:46:05.256 A:middle
were actually either real bugs
or bugs waiting to happen.

00:46:05.256 --> 00:46:07.126 A:middle
So it's a good idea to pay
attention to these warnings.

00:46:07.576 --> 00:46:08.146 A:middle
They are good for you.

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:13.596 A:middle
Now, speaking of NSArray, let's
talk about a tidbit in NSArray.

00:46:14.006 --> 00:46:17.066 A:middle
For the longest time, we've had
a method called last object.

00:46:18.326 --> 00:46:21.816 A:middle
And now, we've added a
method called first object.

00:46:21.816 --> 00:46:23.226 A:middle
And because we love you so much,

00:46:23.226 --> 00:46:25.796 A:middle
it actually works
back to 10.6 in iOS4.

00:46:25.826 --> 00:46:27.576 A:middle
So we made that happen to you.

00:46:27.876 --> 00:46:30.236 A:middle
We decided it was about time,
we were keeping it you know,

00:46:30.236 --> 00:46:31.946 A:middle
it was just ripening
on the tree.

00:46:31.946 --> 00:46:32.606 A:middle
So there it is.

00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:37.036 A:middle
Another tidbit about NSData,
so NSData now has basics

00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:38.686 A:middle
for encoding and
decoding support.

00:46:38.686 --> 00:46:41.026 A:middle
You can encode/decode
back the strings and data.

00:46:41.656 --> 00:46:42.096 A:middle
Thank you.

00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:46.256 A:middle
You can also cast the dispatch
data ts to NSData's now

00:46:46.256 --> 00:46:50.076 A:middle
and this is actually a one way--
one way bridging effectively.

00:46:50.466 --> 00:46:53.806 A:middle
They're sometimes you-- you
know, you cross API boundaries

00:46:53.806 --> 00:46:55.856 A:middle
and you need to do this.

00:46:55.906 --> 00:46:58.326 A:middle
And note that since dispatch
data ts, those of you

00:46:58.326 --> 00:46:59.356 A:middle
who are familiar
might know this.

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:03.426 A:middle
Dispatch data ts can represent
discontiguous blocks of data.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:03.426 A:middle
Dispatch data ts can represent
discontiguous blocks of data.

00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.206 A:middle
There's a slight, you know,

00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:08.776 A:middle
maybe mismatch with
NSData there.

00:47:09.146 --> 00:47:12.106 A:middle
If you call NSData, bytes method
will actually make it work.

00:47:12.106 --> 00:47:13.756 A:middle
However, if you want
to be more efficient

00:47:14.046 --> 00:47:15.616 A:middle
with these continuos
blocks of data,

00:47:16.026 --> 00:47:18.286 A:middle
you can actually use this new
enumeration method we've added

00:47:18.316 --> 00:47:21.426 A:middle
which lets you enumerate NSData
in terms of the blocks it has.

00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:23.286 A:middle
And of course, if you
happen to call this on one

00:47:23.286 --> 00:47:26.136 A:middle
of the traditional style datas,
you'll still get just one block.

00:47:26.136 --> 00:47:28.146 A:middle
It will be as efficient as
calling the bytes method.

00:47:28.146 --> 00:47:31.416 A:middle
So it's you know, it's a pretty
good method to use in general.

00:47:31.676 --> 00:47:33.766 A:middle
So just call enumerate
byte ranges using block

00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:35.686 A:middle
and it will return to
you the radius where the,

00:47:35.746 --> 00:47:37.856 A:middle
the ranges where the
discontiguous memory

00:47:37.856 --> 00:47:38.716 A:middle
blocks exist.

00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:43.236 A:middle
OK, NSURL component is another
new class in foundation.

00:47:43.376 --> 00:47:47.476 A:middle
NSURL components is to NSURL
what NSDate components is

00:47:47.476 --> 00:47:48.196 A:middle
to NSDate.

00:47:48.196 --> 00:47:52.016 A:middle
It's a mutable class that lets
you parse and create URLs.

00:47:52.486 --> 00:47:54.646 A:middle
And for those of you
who are into RFCs.

00:47:54.976 --> 00:47:59.156 A:middle
This now allows NSURL to be
compliant with this RFC up here.

00:47:59.736 --> 00:48:01.896 A:middle
The API is fairly
straightforward.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.736 --> 00:48:01.896 A:middle
The API is fairly
straightforward.

00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:03.706 A:middle
You can initialize
one from a URL

00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.286 A:middle
or you can just initialize
an empty one.

00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:08.036 A:middle
You can go ahead and set
various properties on here

00:48:08.036 --> 00:48:10.746 A:middle
such as the scheme, the
user, the path, the query.

00:48:11.316 --> 00:48:13.956 A:middle
And you just go ahead
and extract the URL.

00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:17.436 A:middle
And just to show you
a quick example, you--

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:20.326 A:middle
so let me create one just
specify those parameters

00:48:20.496 --> 00:48:22.216 A:middle
and I can go ahead
and ask the URL

00:48:22.216 --> 00:48:23.266 A:middle
and here's the output you get.

00:48:23.346 --> 00:48:25.876 A:middle
So it's much, much
more straightforward

00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:28.926 A:middle
than using the previous
URLs and the APIs and NSURL.

00:48:29.576 --> 00:48:31.996 A:middle
NSURLSession is another
API in foundation.

00:48:31.996 --> 00:48:34.406 A:middle
It's actually a set
of related classes,

00:48:34.886 --> 00:48:37.316 A:middle
it's replacement APIs
for NSURLConnection.

00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:39.526 A:middle
It's-- gives you
improved control

00:48:39.526 --> 00:48:40.926 A:middle
over configuration options

00:48:40.926 --> 00:48:43.376 A:middle
such as authentication
cookies and caching.

00:48:43.646 --> 00:48:45.876 A:middle
You no longer have to fiddle
with the global settings,

00:48:45.876 --> 00:48:48.596 A:middle
you can just set them for the
operation you have at hand.

00:48:49.096 --> 00:48:51.676 A:middle
It has ability to pour out
from out of process downloads

00:48:51.676 --> 00:48:54.136 A:middle
and uploads and it will
notify you when it's done.

00:48:54.626 --> 00:48:57.496 A:middle
And there's also some
convenience APIs in NSURLSession

00:48:57.496 --> 00:49:00.616 A:middle
that lets you do simple
cancelable asynchronous

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.496 --> 00:49:00.616 A:middle
that lets you do simple
cancelable asynchronous

00:49:00.616 --> 00:49:02.846 A:middle
operations which has
a few lines of code.

00:49:02.846 --> 00:49:05.026 A:middle
I'm not going to go
into more depth here

00:49:05.026 --> 00:49:08.106 A:middle
because there's a talk
about NSURLSession,

00:49:08.106 --> 00:49:09.836 A:middle
what's new in foundation
networking.

00:49:10.096 --> 00:49:12.446 A:middle
We have some improvements in
the core data and you heard

00:49:12.446 --> 00:49:14.166 A:middle
about this yesterday as well.

00:49:14.656 --> 00:49:17.136 A:middle
In the area of iCloud
support, we now made it

00:49:17.136 --> 00:49:21.506 A:middle
so that core data does lot more
of the tedious things for you.

00:49:21.646 --> 00:49:24.876 A:middle
For instance, core data will
now manage your fallback store.

00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:26.166 A:middle
You don't have to
deal with it anymore.

00:49:26.466 --> 00:49:30.386 A:middle
Core data will do asynchronous
iCloud initialization,

00:49:30.736 --> 00:49:32.906 A:middle
so you don't have to worry
about writing that code anymore.

00:49:33.186 --> 00:49:36.156 A:middle
And core data will also
automatically handle account

00:49:36.156 --> 00:49:36.906 A:middle
changes for you.

00:49:36.906 --> 00:49:39.026 A:middle
So that's another block of code
that you don't have to write

00:49:39.086 --> 00:49:40.396 A:middle
in your coded applications.

00:49:40.976 --> 00:49:43.846 A:middle
In addition, there are
many other fixes not just

00:49:43.846 --> 00:49:46.066 A:middle
in core data but also
in the iClouds stack,

00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:47.566 A:middle
both in the client and server

00:49:47.986 --> 00:49:49.616 A:middle
that will make your
applications--

00:49:49.616 --> 00:49:51.646 A:middle
that will help make your
applications more robust

00:49:51.776 --> 00:49:52.296 A:middle
than before.

00:49:52.486 --> 00:49:55.136 A:middle
There are other changes in core
data as well and one of them is

00:49:55.136 --> 00:49:57.106 A:middle
that we've enabled
write-ahead logging,

00:49:57.486 --> 00:49:58.856 A:middle
journaling on by default.

00:49:58.856 --> 00:50:00.706 A:middle
This replaces rollback
journaling

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.856 --> 00:50:00.706 A:middle
This replaces rollback
journaling

00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:02.276 A:middle
that was on by default before.

00:50:02.886 --> 00:50:04.786 A:middle
This write-ahead
logging journaling is--

00:50:04.926 --> 00:50:08.066 A:middle
has improved reliability,
concurrency, and performance

00:50:08.066 --> 00:50:09.276 A:middle
so it's a good thing in general.

00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:12.616 A:middle
So you can hear more about
core data changes and core data

00:50:12.616 --> 00:50:16.836 A:middle
and iCloud as well tomorrow
morning in this talk,

00:50:16.836 --> 00:50:17.966 A:middle
What's New in Core
Data and iCloud.

00:50:18.866 --> 00:50:20.686 A:middle
There is also a talk
tomorrow at 2,

00:50:20.966 --> 00:50:23.016 A:middle
core data performance
optimization and debugging.

00:50:23.196 --> 00:50:30.736 A:middle
A new feature in objective C
for 10.9 and iOS7 is modules.

00:50:31.386 --> 00:50:34.566 A:middle
Modules is a better way to
import a framework's interface.

00:50:35.426 --> 00:50:38.436 A:middle
So instead of using pound
import that you're you know,

00:50:38.696 --> 00:50:40.506 A:middle
used to love, it's been
around for a while.

00:50:40.506 --> 00:50:44.596 A:middle
Cocoa/cocoa.h you can now
use at import of coco.

00:50:45.486 --> 00:50:49.626 A:middle
What this does is it loads a
binary representation, however,

00:50:49.626 --> 00:50:51.456 A:middle
I mean, just something
you could do before

00:50:51.456 --> 00:50:53.506 A:middle
with pre-compiled headers,
but it's more flexible

00:50:53.506 --> 00:50:56.346 A:middle
that pre-compiled headers
because you don't have to manage

00:50:56.346 --> 00:50:58.086 A:middle
that list of pre-compiled
headers anymore.

00:50:58.086 --> 00:50:59.746 A:middle
The system will take
care of it for you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:00.626 --> 00:51:02.576 A:middle
This is also immune to effects

00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:05.016 A:middle
of local macro definitions
you know,

00:51:05.016 --> 00:51:08.406 A:middle
there's that C programmer
mistake of pound to find int

00:51:08.536 --> 00:51:10.266 A:middle
to you know, short
or whatever you know.

00:51:10.266 --> 00:51:12.206 A:middle
That will no longer be
an issue in this case

00:51:12.206 --> 00:51:16.596 A:middle
because those macro definitions
do not take effect in interfaces

00:51:16.596 --> 00:51:18.876 A:middle
that you've imported as modules.

00:51:19.466 --> 00:51:21.686 A:middle
These are enabled for
new projects by default

00:51:21.686 --> 00:51:24.606 A:middle
and you can also enable it for
your existing projects as well.

00:51:25.206 --> 00:51:27.726 A:middle
So there'll be a lot
more coverage of modules

00:51:27.726 --> 00:51:29.636 A:middle
in advances in objective C.

00:51:29.636 --> 00:51:30.906 A:middle
I just want to mention,

00:51:30.906 --> 00:51:33.116 A:middle
highlight of few new
frameworks we've added.

00:51:33.426 --> 00:51:34.396 A:middle
One of them is MapKit.

00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:35.856 A:middle
It was on iOS6.

00:51:35.856 --> 00:51:39.136 A:middle
It's now available on 10.9.

00:51:40.176 --> 00:51:42.476 A:middle
Sprite Kit, you heard
about Sprite Kit yesterday.

00:51:42.476 --> 00:51:46.486 A:middle
It's a new framework for
doing games or applications

00:51:46.486 --> 00:51:50.176 A:middle
with game-like animations
and physics needs and so on.

00:51:50.826 --> 00:51:53.186 A:middle
And there's also AV
Kit which is used

00:51:53.186 --> 00:51:55.006 A:middle
in conjunction with
AV foundation.

00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.646 A:middle
It's you know, you
can replace usage

00:51:57.646 --> 00:51:59.506 A:middle
of queue ticket in
your applications.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:00.296 --> 00:52:03.586 A:middle
There are talks for this, moving
to AV Kit and AV Foundations,

00:52:03.586 --> 00:52:06.216 A:middle
introduction to Sprite Kit
and what's new in Map Kit.

00:52:06.216 --> 00:52:08.226 A:middle
So I'm going to talk
a bit about Textkit.

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.316 A:middle
Textkit, you heard
about this yesterday

00:52:11.316 --> 00:52:12.926 A:middle
in the State of the Union Talk.

00:52:14.036 --> 00:52:17.786 A:middle
Textkit well, let me choose
Textkit by saying when you look

00:52:17.786 --> 00:52:21.136 A:middle
at Cocoa Text on OS X,
you see NS Text View.

00:52:21.886 --> 00:52:24.066 A:middle
However, if you make
any sophisticated use

00:52:24.066 --> 00:52:26.956 A:middle
of the text system on OS X,
you know that's actually made

00:52:26.956 --> 00:52:28.466 A:middle
up of these underlying classes

00:52:28.736 --> 00:52:30.696 A:middle
which gives you a lot more
power and flexibility.

00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:35.286 A:middle
When you look at Textkit on iOS,
which is a new feature in iOS7,

00:52:35.286 --> 00:52:36.866 A:middle
if I didn't make that clear,

00:52:37.336 --> 00:52:39.596 A:middle
you see that there is
the UI Text View class

00:52:39.726 --> 00:52:41.216 A:middle
which has existed
for a long time.

00:52:41.536 --> 00:52:43.516 A:middle
However, if you look
underneath now,

00:52:43.846 --> 00:52:46.226 A:middle
you'll see the same
set of classes.

00:52:46.636 --> 00:52:48.266 A:middle
In addition, they have the same

00:52:48.436 --> 00:52:50.306 A:middle
or very similar set
of APIs as well.

00:52:50.606 --> 00:52:54.306 A:middle
So I'm mentioning this to you
because yeah, those of you

00:52:54.306 --> 00:52:56.996 A:middle
who have a sophisticated
text need of applications

00:52:56.996 --> 00:52:58.856 A:middle
with sophisticated
text users on OS X,

00:52:59.086 --> 00:53:00.456 A:middle
you can now import
these applications

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.086 --> 00:53:00.456 A:middle
you can now import
these applications

00:53:00.456 --> 00:53:03.396 A:middle
to iOS with a lot more ease.

00:53:04.116 --> 00:53:05.616 A:middle
So you can find out
more about Textkit

00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:08.986 A:middle
in the two talks introducing
Textkit and advanced Textkit.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:13.076 A:middle
OK so, as I'm running out of
time, I just want to throw

00:53:13.216 --> 00:53:16.506 A:middle
up a list of some other
changes we have bunch

00:53:16.506 --> 00:53:18.336 A:middle
of Table View outline
view improvements,

00:53:18.496 --> 00:53:20.166 A:middle
we have layer-backed
new improvements.

00:53:20.166 --> 00:53:22.546 A:middle
Again please look at the
release notes, read about these.

00:53:22.986 --> 00:53:27.036 A:middle
NSSlider has some new APIs and
we got rid of some crusty ones.

00:53:27.036 --> 00:53:28.146 A:middle
Some built-in services,

00:53:28.146 --> 00:53:30.826 A:middle
additional built-in services
and NSSharingService.

00:53:31.216 --> 00:53:33.086 A:middle
There's some NSCalendar
convenience APIs

00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:35.496 A:middle
which make it easier to move
your code back and forth

00:53:35.496 --> 00:53:37.336 A:middle
between UIColor and NSColor.

00:53:38.066 --> 00:53:40.756 A:middle
We've-- all right, some
people have tried that

00:53:40.756 --> 00:53:41.846 A:middle
and now it's even better.

00:53:42.466 --> 00:53:44.176 A:middle
So we've deprecated some NSNib

00:53:44.176 --> 00:53:46.166 A:middle
and NSBundle nib-loading
methods.

00:53:46.166 --> 00:53:47.516 A:middle
And the new ones
we had introduced

00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:49.656 A:middle
in 10.8 are the ones you
should move forward to.

00:53:49.846 --> 00:53:53.606 A:middle
And in foundation, we have
some further NSURL improvements

00:53:53.646 --> 00:53:54.636 A:middle
beyond the ones I've talked

00:53:54.636 --> 00:53:57.636 A:middle
about including some built-in
character sets for URL handling.

00:53:58.046 --> 00:54:01.976 A:middle
NS metadata APIs and foundation
level attribute names you no

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:58.046 --> 00:54:01.976 A:middle
NS metadata APIs and foundation
level attribute names you no

00:54:01.976 --> 00:54:04.016 A:middle
longer have to go
to CF level APIs

00:54:04.016 --> 00:54:06.256 A:middle
to get your spotlight
attribute names.

00:54:07.106 --> 00:54:12.186 A:middle
NSUser defaults suite--
whatever, I can't say that word.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.986 A:middle
If you have a bunch of related
applications and they want

00:54:14.986 --> 00:54:18.136 A:middle
to share defaults, these are the
APIs you would use, thank you.

00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:22.666 A:middle
And then also NSScanner has
support for unsigned long long.

00:54:22.666 --> 00:54:25.056 A:middle
So please refer to the
10.9 release notes.

00:54:25.846 --> 00:54:28.726 A:middle
And now, I want to just put
a reminder of some features

00:54:28.726 --> 00:54:30.506 A:middle
that have come and
I would have still.

00:54:30.906 --> 00:54:32.156 A:middle
If you haven't taken advantage

00:54:32.156 --> 00:54:34.326 A:middle
of these features
please consider doing so.

00:54:34.326 --> 00:54:36.516 A:middle
Some of these have
been around since 10.7.

00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:37.706 A:middle
In fact some earlier than that

00:54:37.706 --> 00:54:39.256 A:middle
and some were introduced
in 10.8.

00:54:39.666 --> 00:54:41.046 A:middle
But these are all great features

00:54:41.046 --> 00:54:42.996 A:middle
that will make your
applications more powerful,

00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:44.656 A:middle
more consistent,
more user-friendly.

00:54:45.066 --> 00:54:48.636 A:middle
So please freeze frame
this on your VCRs at home

00:54:48.636 --> 00:54:50.686 A:middle
and choose the features
you want to implement.

00:54:51.266 --> 00:54:52.616 A:middle
We have a lot of
related sessions.

00:54:53.026 --> 00:54:55.766 A:middle
I'm not going to go through
them, just highlight one here.

00:54:55.766 --> 00:54:58.306 A:middle
I've already put these up
in other slides but one

00:54:58.306 --> 00:55:00.516 A:middle
that I haven't talked about
is if you have an iOS App,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:58.306 --> 00:55:00.516 A:middle
that I haven't talked about
is if you have an iOS App,

00:55:00.516 --> 00:55:01.946 A:middle
you're thinking of
bring it to OS X.

00:55:02.206 --> 00:55:04.716 A:middle
We have session Thursday
morning, "Bringing your iOS Apps

00:55:04.716 --> 00:55:06.936 A:middle
to OS X" you might
want to go to that.

00:55:07.436 --> 00:55:10.786 A:middle
And with that, Jake Behrens
is our evangelist if you need

00:55:10.786 --> 00:55:12.186 A:middle
to talk to an evangelist.

00:55:12.706 --> 00:55:14.476 A:middle
And that's it, thank
you very much.

00:55:14.976 --> 00:55:22.560 A:middle
[Applause]
