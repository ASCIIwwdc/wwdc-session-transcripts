[ Silence ]

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:11.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My name is Daniel Kurtz.

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:13.946 A:middle
I'm an iOS engineer on the
Game Center team here at Apple.

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:15.976 A:middle
And I'm here to talk
to you today

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.486 A:middle
about what's new in Game Center.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.706 A:middle
So before we really get into
it, let's do a quick recap

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:23.196 A:middle
of what Game Center actually is.

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:27.566 A:middle
Game Center is a gaming platform
which allows the players

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.816 A:middle
of your games, be they
single player or multiplayer,

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.606 A:middle
to be able to interact with each
other by tracking their scores

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:35.386 A:middle
and achievements that they'd
been earning in your game,

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.736 A:middle
sending challenges to
their friends in order

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.326 A:middle
to beat those scores
and achievements.

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:42.366 A:middle
And then going even further
with the multiplayer support,

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.696 A:middle
we have hosted turn-based gaming
within the game kit framework,

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:48.406 A:middle
as well as real-time
multiplayer matchmaking.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:52.636 A:middle
Now, Game Center has been
incredibly successful.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.176 A:middle
You might have heard the
other day that we have

00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:57.036 A:middle
over 240 million
players in Game Center,

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:59.126 A:middle
and they're playing games both

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.896 A:middle
on their iOS devices
as well as on OS X.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.896 A:middle
on their iOS devices
as well as on OS X.

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:06.556 A:middle
So we've-- when I
asked you what's new

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.636 A:middle
in Game Center this year,
perhaps the first thing

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:10.736 A:middle
that comes to mind
is our brand new UI

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.636 A:middle
for our Game Center
app on iPhone.

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:15.536 A:middle
And we're very happy
about this UI.

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:17.196 A:middle
We think it's very
exciting and fun.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.286 A:middle
But we're not stopping here.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.936 A:middle
We've got a lot of things going

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:24.046 A:middle
on under the covers new
this year for Game Center

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:27.176 A:middle
that you can take advantage
of within your game in order

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:29.046 A:middle
to make it even further
integrated

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:30.306 A:middle
and social with your players.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.006 A:middle
So today, we've got a
large grab back of topics

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.016 A:middle
that we're going to talk about.

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:39.066 A:middle
First up is the Game
Center in-game experience

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.746 A:middle
with the GK Game
Center view controller.

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:44.346 A:middle
We also have a lot of new
changes regarding leaderboards

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:46.606 A:middle
and scores, Leaderboard Sets,

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:48.786 A:middle
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:50.746 A:middle
a new type of leaderboard
that allows you

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:51.946 A:middle
to track scores in a new way.

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:55.636 A:middle
Also, because we're talking
so much about scores today,

00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:57.546 A:middle
we have improved
security measures

00:01:57.546 --> 00:01:59.566 A:middle
to help you limit
cheating within your game.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:02.896 A:middle
And building on top of both
scores and achievements,

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.816 A:middle
we've improved challenges
even further

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:07.606 A:middle
to make it more immersive
for your players.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:10.765 A:middle
And then, finally,
last but not the least,

00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:12.076 A:middle
we're going to round
it out of talking

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:16.856 A:middle
about how you can take advantage
of handling local player events

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:19.886 A:middle
and some fundamental API
changes that we've done

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:22.026 A:middle
with how you can respond
to events relevant

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:23.326 A:middle
to the local player
of your game.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.776 A:middle
So let's get right into it.

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:28.466 A:middle
Let's talk about the Game
Center in-game experience.

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:32.596 A:middle
And you probably all already
know this game, perhaps,

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:34.626 A:middle
it's the in-game menu
for Temple Run 2.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:37.346 A:middle
And on that right
column in the middle row,

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:38.436 A:middle
it's the leaderboards button.

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.066 A:middle
Now, today, if you were
to pull out your iPhone

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.516 A:middle
and play this game and tap
that leaderboard button,

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:46.016 A:middle
up would pop the GK Game
Center view controller,

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:49.516 A:middle
giving you the ability to take a
look at your leaderboard scores,

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:51.496 A:middle
your achievements, perhaps
new challenges you've earned.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:55.366 A:middle
In iOS 7, that same
thing still happens

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:57.106 A:middle
and we've updated the look,

00:02:57.106 --> 00:02:59.846 A:middle
the UI of the GK Game
Center view controller

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:02.306 A:middle
in a very radical way.

00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:05.716 A:middle
We feel that this makes
it much more ingrained,

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.636 A:middle
much more embedded
within Temple Run 2.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.996 A:middle
As you can see, Temple
Run 2's screen still shows

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:11.916 A:middle
through in the background.

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.936 A:middle
However, the same information is
still available to your players.

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:18.776 A:middle
You still have the same list
of leaderboards, can still look

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:20.576 A:middle
at the achievements that
your players have earned

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:22.506 A:middle
or currently endeavoring
to earn,

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:25.166 A:middle
and the challenges they've
gotten from their friends,

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:28.196 A:middle
as well as the ability to rate
the game within the App Store

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:31.376 A:middle
up in the top left or like the
game on Facebook if they wish.

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:35.836 A:middle
So programmatically,
nothing has really changed

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:36.686 A:middle
as to how you're going

00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:38.926 A:middle
to present the GK Game
Center view controller.

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:43.236 A:middle
It's the same exact API
that you'd be using before

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:45.336 A:middle
with a little bit of a wrinkle

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:47.276 A:middle
when you're thinking
about performance.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.736 A:middle
So let's take a look
at some code.

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:51.886 A:middle
Let's say that you have
a target action setup

00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:55.666 A:middle
for that leaderboard button in
your game and you want to hear

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:56.856 A:middle
when that button is tapped

00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:58.716 A:middle
to show the Game
Center view controller.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.846 A:middle
Well, in your target
action method,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.846 A:middle
Well, in your target
action method,

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:04.406 A:middle
the first thing you're going to
do is grab the shared instance

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:06.006 A:middle
for the GK Game Center
view controller,

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:07.596 A:middle
setting up the delegate to cells

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:09.186 A:middle
so that you can dismiss
it appropriately,

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:11.176 A:middle
set up your view state

00:04:11.176 --> 00:04:14.226 A:middle
to whatever appropriate initial
view state you wish to show.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.516 A:middle
And here's a little
bit of a wrinkle,

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:18.036 A:middle
the throttle rendering call.

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:19.586 A:middle
We'll get into that
in just a moment.

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.755 A:middle
And then, finally, you're going

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.816 A:middle
to present the view
controller just like you would

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:25.856 A:middle
with any other UI view
controller within you game.

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:29.196 A:middle
Now that throttle rendering call
that I'm talking about, right?

00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:32.886 A:middle
As I mentioned, the GK
Game Center view controller

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
with iOS 7 is partially
transparent.

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.266 A:middle
Moreover, it's also
doing some blurring

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:40.406 A:middle
and other heavy compositing
on the GPU.

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:44.036 A:middle
So in order to make this
present as smoothly as possible

00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:46.346 A:middle
so that players can get in
and out of the menu and back

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:48.706 A:middle
to playing your game,
you don't really need

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:52.056 A:middle
to be running graphics at 60
frames per second and you're

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:53.766 A:middle
about to push this
view controller over.

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:56.906 A:middle
So you can step back in
the gas pedal a little bit

00:04:56.906 --> 00:04:58.646 A:middle
and let the view
controller present,

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
dismiss when you need to,
and get right back to it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
dismiss when you need to,
and get right back to it.

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:04.406 A:middle
So really, that's
all that's changed

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:05.996 A:middle
with the GK Game
Center view controller.

00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:11.166 A:middle
It's really just the exact
same API with a brand new look

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.546 A:middle
that we feel really makes it

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:15.196 A:middle
that much more ingrained
within your game.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:19.716 A:middle
So let's move on to the
next new topic of today.

00:05:20.496 --> 00:05:21.636 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets.

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:24.176 A:middle
This is something we're
very excited about.

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:29.116 A:middle
Today, on-- in iOS 6 device
or on OS X Mountain Lion,

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:32.286 A:middle
your game currently has
at most 25 leaderboards

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:34.426 A:middle
that it can define and
use on Game Center.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:37.026 A:middle
Now, I'm happy to tell you

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:40.406 A:middle
that we have increased
this maximum limit

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.156 A:middle
to 100 leaderboards.

00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:45.436 A:middle
You can have at most 100
leaderboards in a flat list

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.506 A:middle
that your game can
use in Game Center.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.506 A:middle
And we're not stopping there.

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.876 A:middle
With this new feature that
we have, Leaderboard Sets,

00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:55.776 A:middle
we're increasing actually
the maximum amount

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
of leaderboards you can use
within your game twentyfold

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:00.536 A:middle
to 500 maximum leaderboards.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:00.536 A:middle
to 500 maximum leaderboards.

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:03.346 A:middle
And now, with Leaderboard Sets,

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.736 A:middle
we're introducing an
organizational hierarchy,

00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:08.046 A:middle
a structure that you can
impose on these leaderboards.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:11.266 A:middle
You can think of Leaderboard
Sets as a tagging architecture

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:14.226 A:middle
where a single leaderboard can
belong to many different sets,

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:17.406 A:middle
and likewise, a single
set can contain many

00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:18.456 A:middle
different leaderboards.

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:21.646 A:middle
Then you have at most
100 sets that you can use

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:24.126 A:middle
within your game and at
most 100 leaderboards

00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:26.186 A:middle
that you can put
in a single set.

00:06:26.816 --> 00:06:29.016 A:middle
So why are we asking you

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:32.396 A:middle
to use Leaderboard Sets before
you can actually unlock the full

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:34.616 A:middle
500 leaderboards for
use within your game?

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:37.526 A:middle
It actually comes down
to usability issue.

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:41.006 A:middle
Let's say you've got a Water
Planet group of stages, right?

00:06:41.426 --> 00:06:43.336 A:middle
And also, for this
group of stages,

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.796 A:middle
you have a boss level
at the end.

00:06:45.136 --> 00:06:47.936 A:middle
And maybe you've also
got different levels

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.586 A:middle
of difficulty-- easy,
medium, hard.

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:52.036 A:middle
So one possible leaderboard

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:54.296 A:middle
that your game has is the
Water Planet Boss Level

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:55.236 A:middle
Medium leaderboard.

00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:58.926 A:middle
You, being the endeavoring game
developer that you are, however,

00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:02.106 A:middle
also have 499 other leaderboards

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:02.106 A:middle
also have 499 other leaderboards

00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:03.486 A:middle
that you've made
within your game.

00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:06.556 A:middle
So when a player wants to
go and checkout their score

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:08.696 A:middle
on the Water Planet Boss
Level Medium leaderboard,

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:11.786 A:middle
either within your game,
the Game Center application,

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:13.776 A:middle
or the GK Game Center
view controller,

00:07:14.116 --> 00:07:17.426 A:middle
how are they supposed to find
this leaderboard amongst all

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:18.636 A:middle
500 leaderboards?

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:22.036 A:middle
It really comes down to a needle
in a haystack problem, right?

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:27.086 A:middle
So what sets allow us to
do is to organize this

00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:30.186 A:middle
into meaningful groups of
data to make it a lot easier

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:31.226 A:middle
for players to parse

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:32.656 A:middle
when they're looking
through your game.

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:36.366 A:middle
Here's an example from the GK
Game Center view controller

00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:39.606 A:middle
for this game, where when the
player taps the leaderboard

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:43.156 A:middle
segment, the first thing that
they are shown is the list

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:44.816 A:middle
of Leaderboard Sets
within the game.

00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
Then if we were to tap that
Water Planet set up at the top,

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:51.746 A:middle
the very next screen would
show all the leaderboards

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:54.066 A:middle
that are contained within
the Water Planet set.

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:56.476 A:middle
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:07:57.296 --> 00:08:02.126 A:middle
So let's consider how we
could actually put this single

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.296 --> 00:08:02.126 A:middle
So let's consider how we
could actually put this single

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.206 A:middle
leaderboard into various sets

00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:07.386 A:middle
and how we can start imposing
some order to the chaos

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
of these 500 leaderboards.

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:12.686 A:middle
Well, right off the bat, we
have three pretty obvious ways

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.626 A:middle
or three pretty obvious sets

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:16.666 A:middle
that we could organize a
single leaderboard into.

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:20.816 A:middle
One characteristic of this
leaderboard is that it belongs

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:23.516 A:middle
to the Water Planet group
of stages within the game.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:26.336 A:middle
There's also the boss
level for the Water Planet,

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.396 A:middle
and its medium difficulty.

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:30.856 A:middle
So right there, that's
three different sets

00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:32.816 A:middle
that this leaderboard
could belong to.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:36.256 A:middle
And while this leaderboard
could belong to these sets,

00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:39.285 A:middle
we could also add all the
other leaderboards that belong

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.696 A:middle
to these appropriate
sets as well.

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:45.366 A:middle
So the Water Planet set
contains all the stages

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:49.266 A:middle
for Water Planet-- water
boss, medium, et cetera.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:53.376 A:middle
So just like with leaderboards,

00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:56.336 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets can have
names of players saved.

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:00.786 A:middle
And moreover, depending
upon the set

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:00.786 A:middle
And moreover, depending
upon the set

00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:02.486 A:middle
that a leaderboard
is contained within,

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:05.536 A:middle
the name for that individual
leaderboard can change as well.

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:08.956 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the examples

00:09:09.056 --> 00:09:11.286 A:middle
of what this actually
means and how it works.

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:15.536 A:middle
So we go back to these three
sets that we've defined

00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:17.786 A:middle
that the Water Boss Medium
Level leaderboard can be

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:18.486 A:middle
contained within.

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:22.866 A:middle
In Water Planet set, we could
simply just name Water Planet,

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:27.176 A:middle
and that Water Boss Medium Level
leaderboard, when it's contained

00:09:27.176 --> 00:09:30.426 A:middle
within the Water Planet, that
is when the player has navigated

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:32.756 A:middle
to the Water Planet set to
look at this leaderboard,

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:35.736 A:middle
we could just display
the string boss medium.

00:09:36.216 --> 00:09:39.816 A:middle
From here, it's clear that
this is the Boss Medium Level

00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:42.806 A:middle
leaderboard for the Water
Planet group of stages.

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:44.986 A:middle
There's no redundant
information.

00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:46.486 A:middle
Everything is very
much contextual.

00:09:47.616 --> 00:09:50.646 A:middle
And we can go and name all the
other leaderboards appropriately

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:51.626 A:middle
for that set as well.

00:09:53.036 --> 00:09:55.936 A:middle
Then the Water Boss Set,
just call it Water Boss.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:58.976 A:middle
That same leaderboard when
it's in the Water Boss Set,

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:01.116 A:middle
we only have to call it medium

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:01.116 A:middle
we only have to call it medium

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:03.516 A:middle
because it's obvious it's the
medium level of difficulty

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:03.976 A:middle
for the water boss set.

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:07.146 A:middle
We go and name all
the other leaderboards

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:08.156 A:middle
in that set appropriately.

00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:09.416 A:middle
And then you're getting
the picture

00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.806 A:middle
with medium set, call it medium.

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
And we could call this
one stage Water Boss.

00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:19.056 A:middle
And name all the other
medium level leaderboards

00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:21.386 A:middle
in the medium set
appropriately as well.

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.986 A:middle
So we've gone and we've
given this single leaderboard

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
different names depending
upon the way the players have

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.636 A:middle
actually navigated to it.

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
But it's still the
exact same leaderboard.

00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:36.216 A:middle
That is, regardless of the
path that players happen to go

00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:41.436 A:middle
or take in order to find this
leaderboard, the exact same list

00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:43.456 A:middle
of scores is going to be
displayed to the user.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:46.436 A:middle
It's just really UI
customization option

00:10:46.436 --> 00:10:48.766 A:middle
that you have at your
disposal in order

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:52.846 A:middle
to make information
contextual and not redundant.

00:10:54.496 --> 00:10:57.436 A:middle
So let's take a look at how
we can actually set your game

00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:00.056 A:middle
up in iTunes Connect in
order to use Leaderboard Sets

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:00.056 A:middle
up in iTunes Connect in
order to use Leaderboard Sets

00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:02.096 A:middle
and start organizing
the leaderboards

00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:04.026 A:middle
of your game into these sets.

00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:05.706 A:middle
We're going to take a very,

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:08.546 A:middle
very quick blow-by-blow
quick flyover here.

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.376 A:middle
I definitely urge you to check

00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:12.476 A:middle
out the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow, however,

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:14.986 A:middle
if you want to get more
detail as how you can set

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:16.366 A:middle
up Leaderboard Sets
within your game.

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:21.696 A:middle
So in the Game Center page for
your game on iTunes Connect,

00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:25.386 A:middle
in the leaderboard section of
that page is this new button,

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:27.586 A:middle
Move All Leaderboards
into Display Sets.

00:11:28.286 --> 00:11:31.886 A:middle
When you click this button,
you're going to be asked

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:34.836 A:middle
to create the very
first set for your game.

00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:38.356 A:middle
And now, the first thing that
you're going to have to do

00:11:38.356 --> 00:11:41.226 A:middle
when you're creating this
set is to find a handle.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.966 A:middle
This is really just the
name that you're going

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:46.556 A:middle
to be referring to this set

00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:48.756 A:middle
when you're configuring
it on iTunes Connect.

00:11:48.966 --> 00:11:51.586 A:middle
This isn't the same as the
string that players are going

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.976 A:middle
to see when they're
using your game.

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle
It's really just a
convenience for you.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.046 A:middle
Then, after creating that
handle, that Set Reference Name,

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:04.246 A:middle
you're going to have to
create a leaderboard set ID.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:04.246 A:middle
you're going to have to
create a leaderboard set ID.

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:08.486 A:middle
Just like leaderboards, you have
to create a unique identifier

00:12:08.486 --> 00:12:10.446 A:middle
for your set on iTunes Connect.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.626 A:middle
And we suggest that
you create it

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:14.836 A:middle
as a reverse DNS style string.

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:17.286 A:middle
So in this case, for
the Water Planet set,

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.656 A:middle
we're going to give it
this reverse DNS string.

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:21.566 A:middle
Now, after that,
you've created a set.

00:12:22.816 --> 00:12:25.776 A:middle
And from creating a set, you
actually have to give it a name

00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:27.506 A:middle
that is going to be
displayed to your players.

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:31.316 A:middle
So the very next step you're
going to have to take is

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:35.386 A:middle
within the Display Set
Localization portion

00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:37.106 A:middle
of the screen after
creating the set,

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:39.366 A:middle
there's an Add Language
button here.

00:12:40.856 --> 00:12:42.816 A:middle
And you need to then go

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:47.906 A:middle
and create language-specific
display names for this set.

00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:52.876 A:middle
So we could take, say,
English as the first language

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:56.186 A:middle
that we're going to define
a name for, for this set.

00:12:56.956 --> 00:13:00.226 A:middle
We're going to name this Water
Planet set just Water Planet,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.956 --> 00:13:00.226 A:middle
We're going to name this Water
Planet set just Water Planet,

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:01.586 A:middle
liked we talked about
in the example.

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:06.516 A:middle
And then we can also create an
English locale-specific image

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:09.576 A:middle
that we wish to be displayed
to players when they're looking

00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:12.016 A:middle
at this set on English
locale devices.

00:13:12.576 --> 00:13:15.746 A:middle
And then, further, if
you're creating your games

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.296 A:middle
for multiple languages
either now or in the future,

00:13:18.816 --> 00:13:22.646 A:middle
you can create other
localizations as you see fit.

00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:26.576 A:middle
So after you've created the
display name for this set,

00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:28.866 A:middle
the next thing you need to
do is actually start adding

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:32.486 A:middle
leaderboards in your
game into this set.

00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:34.806 A:middle
So you'll see another
part on the screen

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:37.496 A:middle
that says Leaderboards in This
Set with Add to Set button.

00:13:38.156 --> 00:13:41.146 A:middle
Clicking that button, you're
going to be asked to select one

00:13:41.146 --> 00:13:43.046 A:middle
of the leaderboards that
you've already defined

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:43.896 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:47.766 A:middle
Let's take that Water Boss
Medium Level leaderboard.

00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:51.116 A:middle
And then you're going to have
to give that leaderboard a name

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:53.846 A:middle
when it's being displayed
within the Water Planet set.

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:59.156 A:middle
So again, you choose a
language, give, in this case,

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:00.796 A:middle
the English language
string that's going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:00.796 A:middle
the English language
string that's going

00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.006 A:middle
to be displayed to your players.

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:03.916 A:middle
And then either now
or in the future,

00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:06.116 A:middle
go and give other
languages if you decide

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:08.026 A:middle
to localize your game
for multiple locales.

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:12.296 A:middle
So that's really all there is to
it for actually setting up sets

00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:13.066 A:middle
within iTunes Connect.

00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:16.156 A:middle
Now, using Leaderboard
Sets programmatically

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:18.666 A:middle
with the Game Kit Framework
is very straightforward.

00:14:19.936 --> 00:14:23.086 A:middle
We nowhave a GK Leaderboard
Set class

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.066 A:middle
and it defines three fundamental
properties that you're going

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:28.086 A:middle
to have to care about
when you're using sets

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:29.086 A:middle
within your game.

00:14:30.316 --> 00:14:32.536 A:middle
The first is an NS string title.

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.936 A:middle
Now this is really just the
display name that you set

00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:36.646 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect
for your set.

00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:39.926 A:middle
And if your game is running
on an English locale device,

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:42.296 A:middle
it's going to display the
English name, Japanese

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:43.816 A:middle
or Japanese name, et
cetera, et cetera,

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.856 A:middle
just like how leaderboard
titles work today as well.

00:14:49.136 --> 00:14:51.136 A:middle
Then you're going to have
your NS string identifier.

00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:55.486 A:middle
This is just the set ID that
you defined on iTunes Connect.

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:58.666 A:middle
And, as well, optionally,
there's the group identifier.

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:02.066 A:middle
Now we didn't talk about this
in the iTunes Connect overview,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:02.066 A:middle
Now we didn't talk about this
in the iTunes Connect overview,

00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:05.946 A:middle
but just like how leaderboards
work with game groups,

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:07.526 A:middle
a feature that we
introduced last year,

00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:09.896 A:middle
so too do Leaderboard Sets.

00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:11.896 A:middle
And we're not really
going to talk a whole lot

00:15:11.896 --> 00:15:14.056 A:middle
about the group identifier
in game groups

00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:17.126 A:middle
with Leaderboard Sets today,
but I definitely urge you again

00:15:17.206 --> 00:15:18.976 A:middle
to check out the iTunes
Connect session tomorrow

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:21.116 A:middle
for more detail on that.

00:15:21.496 --> 00:15:23.786 A:middle
So we've got the GK
Leaderboard Set class.

00:15:24.036 --> 00:15:26.606 A:middle
Just like GK Leaderboard
objects before,

00:15:26.606 --> 00:15:28.656 A:middle
you can actually use
the sets that you've set

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:30.256 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect
within your game.

00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:33.886 A:middle
The very first thing you need
to do is load all the sets

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:34.806 A:middle
that belong to your game.

00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:38.246 A:middle
And you can do that calling
Load Leaderboard Sets

00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:39.126 A:middle
with Completion Handler.

00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:42.646 A:middle
Now, when your completion
handler is called, you're going

00:15:42.646 --> 00:15:46.286 A:middle
to be passed back an NS array
of GK Leaderboard set instances.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.816 A:middle
And from there, you're on free.

00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:50.586 A:middle
You can do anything
that you wish

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:52.236 A:middle
with these leaderboard
set objects.

00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:55.476 A:middle
For instance, you can
load the leaderboards

00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:57.016 A:middle
that are contained
within those sets.

00:15:57.796 --> 00:16:00.276 A:middle
So when this completion handler
is called, we can take one

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.796 --> 00:16:00.276 A:middle
So when this completion handler
is called, we can take one

00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:01.576 A:middle
of the sets that
we've been given back.

00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:04.516 A:middle
And to load the leaderboards
that are contained

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:07.286 A:middle
within that set, we could
call Load Leaderboard

00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:09.996 A:middle
with Completion Handler
or Load Leaderboards

00:16:09.996 --> 00:16:10.816 A:middle
with Completion Handler.

00:16:11.756 --> 00:16:14.376 A:middle
And when that completion
handler is called back,

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:17.316 A:middle
you'll be provided an NS array
of GK Leaderboard instances.

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:20.796 A:middle
And now I'm assuming that
you're already familiar

00:16:20.796 --> 00:16:23.136 A:middle
with GK Leaderboard
objects, from this point,

00:16:23.136 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
you can treat these objects just

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:26.906 A:middle
like you would any other
GK Leaderboard object

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.836 A:middle
within your game.

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:29.926 A:middle
One other thing that you can do

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:33.346 A:middle
with GK Leaderboard set
instances is to load the image

00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:35.636 A:middle
that you upload with
iTunes Connect for that set.

00:16:36.466 --> 00:16:38.826 A:middle
So within this Load
Leaderboard Sets

00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:41.406 A:middle
with Completion Handler called
back, you could take one

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:43.996 A:middle
of those sets and call Load
Image with Completion Handler.

00:16:44.616 --> 00:16:47.746 A:middle
And that completion handler will
pass back a GK image object.

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:52.196 A:middle
So a GK image object is
really just a typedef.

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:54.576 A:middle
If you're running on iOS,
then that's going to point

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:58.476 A:middle
to UI image, if you're running
on OS X, they'll be an NS image.

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:00.926 A:middle
And once this completion
handler is called back,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:00.926 A:middle
And once this completion
handler is called back,

00:17:00.926 --> 00:17:03.036 A:middle
you can use it just like
any other image asset

00:17:03.036 --> 00:17:03.686 A:middle
within your game.

00:17:04.246 --> 00:17:07.576 A:middle
So that's Leaderboard Sets.

00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:11.435 A:middle
Again, it's-- you can think of
them as a tagging architecture.

00:17:11.496 --> 00:17:15.185 A:middle
It allows you to group multiple
leaderboards into a set.

00:17:15.546 --> 00:17:17.156 A:middle
A single leaderboard
can be contained

00:17:17.156 --> 00:17:18.526 A:middle
within many different sets.

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:21.866 A:middle
An important thing that I
wish to pint out here is

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:24.715 A:middle
that if you wish to unlock
all 500 leaderboards, that is,

00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:27.425 A:middle
if you wish to adopt Leaderboard
Sets within your game,

00:17:27.955 --> 00:17:30.576 A:middle
then you must make sure
that every leaderboard

00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:35.546 A:middle
that you create within your game
is a member of at least one set.

00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:39.086 A:middle
So let's move on to the next new
thing with leaderboards today,

00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:41.556 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards.

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.726 A:middle
So you're all probably
already familiar

00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:46.766 A:middle
with how leaderboards
work within Game Center,

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.656 A:middle
the best score ranking system.

00:17:49.216 --> 00:17:51.746 A:middle
That is, if you've got
an ascending leaderboard

00:17:51.746 --> 00:17:53.306 A:middle
or ascending sort
order leaderboard,

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:56.756 A:middle
and your player happens to
earn 10,000 points today,

00:17:56.756 --> 00:18:00.276 A:middle
then tomorrow, when they
score 5,000 points, let's say,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:56.756 --> 00:18:00.276 A:middle
then tomorrow, when they
score 5,000 points, let's say,

00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:04.916 A:middle
5,000 isn't better than 10,000,
so 10,000 is going to remain

00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:08.206 A:middle
on the all-time time span
for that leaderboard.

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:10.876 A:middle
Or what if you want to
implement a leaderboard

00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:13.416 A:middle
where scores can both go
up and down over the course

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:16.366 A:middle
of people playing your
game, like batting average.

00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:18.716 A:middle
If you want to track your
player's batting average

00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:20.216 A:middle
over a season, that's going

00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:22.926 A:middle
to not just be monotonically
increasing or decreasing,

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.916 A:middle
it's actually going
to be increasing

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:26.566 A:middle
or decreasing over time.

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:29.376 A:middle
So that's what a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard allows you

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:30.126 A:middle
to do.

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:33.246 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
they're just an alternative

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.586 A:middle
to Best Score Leaderboards.

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:37.306 A:middle
And the way that they function
should be pretty obvious

00:18:37.306 --> 00:18:37.906 A:middle
by the name.

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:41.306 A:middle
It's just that the next score
that you submit to a leaderboard

00:18:41.306 --> 00:18:43.726 A:middle
for your player, that's going
to be the score that shows

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:45.546 A:middle
up on the leaderboard
in Game Center.

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:51.346 A:middle
So really, what this means, it's
actually a very profound effect

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:55.616 A:middle
of this is that it allows you
to take full 100 percent control

00:18:55.616 --> 00:18:57.966 A:middle
over the ranking system
for this leaderboard.

00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:01.216 A:middle
You could do things like power
rankings for your chess game

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:01.216 A:middle
You could do things like power
rankings for your chess game

00:19:01.216 --> 00:19:03.376 A:middle
or your legendary
RPG Heroes game.

00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:06.846 A:middle
You could do win/lose
percentage or even, you know,

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:10.496 A:middle
simpler things like batting
average or golf strokes or OPS.

00:19:10.846 --> 00:19:12.356 A:middle
Really, it's entirely up to you.

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.596 A:middle
And setting up a Most
Recent Score Leaderboard

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:18.236 A:middle
for your game is really
just a single checkbox away

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:20.976 A:middle
on iTunes Connect.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.166 A:middle
Within the Leaderboard
Configuration screen

00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:25.556 A:middle
on iTunes Connect when you're
creating a new leaderboard,

00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:28.296 A:middle
you'll notice that there's a
new field here called Score

00:19:28.296 --> 00:19:29.006 A:middle
Submission Type.

00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:33.406 A:middle
Now by default, that Best Score
field is going to be clicked.

00:19:34.186 --> 00:19:38.536 A:middle
However, if you click the Most
Recent Score checkbox right

00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:41.096 A:middle
there, that instantly
turns this leaderboard

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.786 A:middle
into a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard.

00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:45.666 A:middle
Now you may already be familiar

00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:49.016 A:middle
with the Sort Order field
right below, we've had this

00:19:49.016 --> 00:19:51.076 A:middle
for a long while already.

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:54.346 A:middle
Sort Order is just as applicable

00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:56.906 A:middle
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards as it is

00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:58.286 A:middle
to Best Score Leaderboards.

00:19:59.016 --> 00:20:02.296 A:middle
If you say set this
to low to high,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.016 --> 00:20:02.296 A:middle
If you say set this
to low to high,

00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:03.746 A:middle
then the lowest scores are going

00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:04.976 A:middle
to get the best ranks
on this leaderboard.

00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:09.196 A:middle
So using baseball,
again, as an example,

00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:12.166 A:middle
if you want to track ERA, you'd
probably want it to be low

00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:14.126 A:middle
to high because lower is better.

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:16.646 A:middle
High to low for batting average.

00:20:16.646 --> 00:20:19.486 A:middle
You want it so that the highest
scores get the best ranks.

00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:24.296 A:middle
So Most Recent Score
Leaderboards programmatically

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:25.436 A:middle
are identical.

00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:28.946 A:middle
100 percent identical to
regular best score leaderboards

00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:30.106 A:middle
in the Game Kit Framework.

00:20:31.036 --> 00:20:33.556 A:middle
However, since you are
now being given the power

00:20:33.556 --> 00:20:36.706 A:middle
to entirely customize the
ranking system that's afforded

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:39.426 A:middle
to you, there's a lot of
things that you could do

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:41.616 A:middle
when you're preparing these
scores for submission.

00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:46.186 A:middle
So let's take a look at an
example of what you could do.

00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:48.916 A:middle
Let's say that you want to
create a power ranking system,

00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:53.216 A:middle
that is, you have a
multiplayer game and you've got

00:20:53.216 --> 00:20:56.206 A:middle
like a ladder ranking system
within your game so that

00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:58.996 A:middle
if a high-rank player and a
low-rank player play each other

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:02.106 A:middle
in a match and the low-rank
player happens to win,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:02.106 A:middle
in a match and the low-rank
player happens to win,

00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:04.496 A:middle
then the low-rank player's
rank is going to jump

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:08.516 A:middle
up the difference of those two
players' ranks, and vice versa,

00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:10.226 A:middle
the high-rank player,
because he lost,

00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:11.766 A:middle
is going to drop
by the difference.

00:21:12.866 --> 00:21:15.576 A:middle
Well, what we could do here
programmatically is at the end

00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:20.016 A:middle
of the match, we could
load the leaderboard scores

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:22.706 A:middle
for those two players, the local
player and the other player,

00:21:23.466 --> 00:21:26.456 A:middle
setting the identifier for
the GK Leaderboard object

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:28.796 A:middle
to that Most Recent Score
Leaderboard identifier you've

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:31.636 A:middle
set up on iTunes Connect.

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:34.446 A:middle
So once you've loaded the
scores with completion handler

00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:35.976 A:middle
and your completion
handler is called back,

00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:38.306 A:middle
you can grab the score values

00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:40.316 A:middle
for both the local player
and the other player.

00:21:41.236 --> 00:21:45.936 A:middle
And then, based upon the
previous power ranking, that is,

00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:48.936 A:middle
the local player's value
of the local player

00:21:48.936 --> 00:21:51.216 A:middle
and the previous ranking of
the other player's value,

00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:53.446 A:middle
as well as the outcome

00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:56.026 A:middle
of the match whether the local
player happened to win or lose,

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:59.056 A:middle
you can create a new
local player score value.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:02.976 A:middle
Then from there, you
submit these scores just

00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:04.276 A:middle
like you would any other score

00:22:04.276 --> 00:22:06.036 A:middle
to any other regular
old leaderboard.

00:22:06.676 --> 00:22:10.656 A:middle
You allocate a native score
with the leaderboard identifier

00:22:10.656 --> 00:22:13.526 A:middle
for the Most Recent Score
Leaderboard, you set the value

00:22:13.526 --> 00:22:16.456 A:middle
to the new local player's
value, and then, finally,

00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:18.626 A:middle
you call report scores
passing in an array

00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:20.056 A:middle
with that local player's score.

00:22:21.836 --> 00:22:24.286 A:middle
So, really, that's all there is

00:22:24.286 --> 00:22:26.456 A:middle
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards.

00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:30.516 A:middle
It's very, very similar
to how you would work

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:32.686 A:middle
with Best Score leaderboards
programmatically,

00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:35.406 A:middle
but since there's so much
else that you can do in order

00:22:35.406 --> 00:22:39.006 A:middle
to customize the
ranking system, really,

00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:42.976 A:middle
the opportunities are
endless as to what it can do.

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:45.216 A:middle
So while we're in the
neighborhood of GK Leaderboard

00:22:45.366 --> 00:22:48.356 A:middle
and its API, I just want to
touch on a couple of changes

00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:50.996 A:middle
that we have this year with iOS
7 for the Game Kit Framework.

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:53.206 A:middle
First of all, you
may be familiar

00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:55.336 A:middle
with the GK Leaderboard
Category property.

00:22:55.706 --> 00:22:59.596 A:middle
That was a pointer for basically
the NS string identifier

00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:00.846 A:middle
that you set up on
iTunes Connect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:00.846 A:middle
that you set up on
iTunes Connect.

00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:05.206 A:middle
We're deprecating this in favor
of the identifier property.

00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:06.996 A:middle
And the reason is basically

00:23:06.996 --> 00:23:10.466 A:middle
because with GK Leaderboard
Sets, sets and categories,

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:12.886 A:middle
they sound sort of familiar
or similar to each other,

00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:16.096 A:middle
so in order to, you know,
allay any confusion,

00:23:16.096 --> 00:23:17.776 A:middle
we're deprecating the
category property.

00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:21.786 A:middle
You may also be familiar with
the Set Default Leaderboard

00:23:21.786 --> 00:23:23.126 A:middle
with Completion Handler Call

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:25.396 A:middle
on GK Leaderboard
as a class method.

00:23:26.186 --> 00:23:29.526 A:middle
Now, this basically allowed
you to make it such that

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:32.536 A:middle
when a player is viewing your
game within the Game Center app,

00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:35.136 A:middle
that the very first leaderboard
that they're presented

00:23:35.136 --> 00:23:38.516 A:middle
with within your game detail
view is the leaderboard

00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:39.206 A:middle
that you're choosing.

00:23:39.996 --> 00:23:42.586 A:middle
But since this is something that
isn't so much of the property

00:23:42.586 --> 00:23:45.266 A:middle
of the leaderboard, but
much more the local player,

00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:49.326 A:middle
we're deprecating the GK
Leaderboard method in favor

00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:53.076 A:middle
of GK Local Player Set
Default Leaderboard Identifier

00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:54.306 A:middle
Completion Handler method.

00:23:54.426 --> 00:23:56.966 A:middle
So use that instead in
case you're interested.

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:02.206 A:middle
So we've talked a lot about
new leaderboard features today,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:02.206 A:middle
So we've talked a lot about
new leaderboard features today,

00:24:02.206 --> 00:24:04.416 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets, to
increase the maximum amount

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:05.626 A:middle
of leaderboards that
you can use,

00:24:06.016 --> 00:24:08.116 A:middle
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,

00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:11.356 A:middle
and new ranking systems that
you can create using them.

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:14.086 A:middle
Let's take a quick
peek under the hood

00:24:14.086 --> 00:24:17.496 A:middle
as to how actual
score submission works

00:24:17.636 --> 00:24:20.096 A:middle
in the Game Kit Framework
in the Game Center platform,

00:24:21.006 --> 00:24:22.226 A:middle
and what's going
on under the hood

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:23.896 A:middle
when you're communicating
with Game Center.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:28.666 A:middle
So when your game is running
and it's making submissions

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:31.286 A:middle
to Game Center, whether it's
running on an iOS device

00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:35.646 A:middle
or an OS X system, it's
actually not alone.

00:24:35.646 --> 00:24:37.356 A:middle
We have a daemon called gamed

00:24:37.716 --> 00:24:39.276 A:middle
that is always running
in the background.

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:42.106 A:middle
And when your game
is communicating

00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:44.696 A:middle
through the Game Kit Framework
with the Game Center platform,

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:47.866 A:middle
transparently, as in you don't
need to remember any of this,

00:24:48.126 --> 00:24:50.996 A:middle
transparently, your game
is actually establishing a

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:53.066 A:middle
connection with gamed,
our daemon.

00:24:53.766 --> 00:24:56.876 A:middle
Then in turn, gamed is
establishing a connection

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.966 A:middle
with the Game Center
servers in the outside world.

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:02.196 A:middle
So when you submit
a score, let's say,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:02.196 A:middle
So when you submit
a score, let's say,

00:25:02.946 --> 00:25:04.546 A:middle
to the Game Center system,

00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:08.176 A:middle
you're actually submitting
that to gamed.

00:25:09.166 --> 00:25:11.876 A:middle
And now, gamed is going
to automatically relay

00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:13.486 A:middle
that to the Game Center server.

00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
So why do we do this?

00:25:16.746 --> 00:25:20.216 A:middle
Well, let's say, for instance,
that internet connectivity

00:25:20.216 --> 00:25:23.636 A:middle
of the device happens to be
lost, and thus, the connection

00:25:23.636 --> 00:25:25.876 A:middle
with the Game Center
server is separate.

00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:29.696 A:middle
Well, for any score submissions
or achievement submissions

00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:33.046 A:middle
or any other type of submissions
happen to fail because of this,

00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:35.856 A:middle
gamed will automatically
store those requests

00:25:35.856 --> 00:25:36.496 A:middle
that you're making.

00:25:37.176 --> 00:25:39.656 A:middle
Any of the failed ones
or any of the future ones

00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:42.986 A:middle
that you're making to game d,
your game doesn't need to worry

00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:45.486 A:middle
about internet connect--
internet connectivity,

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:48.336 A:middle
gamed is always just
there managing it for you.

00:25:49.236 --> 00:25:52.066 A:middle
So that when Game Center
server, the connection

00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:53.926 A:middle
with the server happens
to be reestablished

00:25:53.926 --> 00:25:55.366 A:middle
and the device comes
back online,

00:25:56.246 --> 00:25:58.226 A:middle
or even if your game happens

00:25:58.226 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
to go offline before these
submissions make it over,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.226 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
to go offline before these
submissions make it over,

00:26:01.916 --> 00:26:04.456 A:middle
gamed is going to immediately go

00:26:04.456 --> 00:26:06.226 A:middle
and forward those
score submissions

00:26:06.746 --> 00:26:10.276 A:middle
over to the Game Center
server on your behalf.

00:26:10.356 --> 00:26:12.276 A:middle
Really, you don't need to
worry about any of this,

00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
it's all done transparently
for you.

00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:18.326 A:middle
So you may be familiar
with the report scores

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:22.756 A:middle
with completion handler API
and how our completion handler,

00:26:22.756 --> 00:26:26.306 A:middle
as a signature, such that it can
pass back an NS error object.

00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:28.776 A:middle
This is largely vestigial.

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.546 A:middle
This whole store and
forward mechanism

00:26:31.546 --> 00:26:33.516 A:middle
with the gamed daemon
is something

00:26:33.516 --> 00:26:35.576 A:middle
that we introduced in iOS 5.

00:26:36.766 --> 00:26:39.006 A:middle
So it's been running
up through today.

00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:43.596 A:middle
As long as your score and/or if
you're submitting achievements,

00:26:43.596 --> 00:26:45.526 A:middle
your achievements
happen to be in it

00:26:45.686 --> 00:26:48.886 A:middle
with the proper consistent
identifier that you set

00:26:48.886 --> 00:26:51.376 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect,
you don't need to worry

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.796 A:middle
about checking this NS
error object and its value.

00:26:54.586 --> 00:26:56.446 A:middle
We're actually not going
to hand one back to you.

00:26:56.946 --> 00:26:59.846 A:middle
In the past, before we
implement the store and forward,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:01.996 A:middle
we used to ask you
to check to see

00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:03.796 A:middle
if there was an internet
connectivity error

00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:04.836 A:middle
that was handed back to you.

00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:07.616 A:middle
And if so, we asked you
to actually do the storing

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:10.016 A:middle
and forwarding of
these requests later.

00:27:10.756 --> 00:27:12.176 A:middle
But you don't need to do that.

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:14.186 A:middle
You haven't had to
do that since iOS 5.

00:27:14.986 --> 00:27:17.426 A:middle
So if you've got a code
like that within your game,

00:27:17.426 --> 00:27:18.636 A:middle
definitely take it out.

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:20.346 A:middle
You don't have to worry

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:22.006 A:middle
about caching your
scores and achievements.

00:27:22.506 --> 00:27:23.906 A:middle
In fact, we definitely
urge you not

00:27:23.906 --> 00:27:25.276 A:middle
to because there
are complications

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.096 A:middle
that can arise with challenges.

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:30.416 A:middle
Just the moment that your
player has earned the score

00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:32.066 A:middle
and achievement,
submit right away.

00:27:32.656 --> 00:27:35.186 A:middle
Give it over to gamed, it'll
do the heavy lifting for you.

00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:39.376 A:middle
And that being said, if you're
submitting multiple scores

00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:41.866 A:middle
for a single play-through
session, like, let's say,

00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:44.746 A:middle
your player is going to be
earning coins in the session,

00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:48.686 A:middle
they're also going to be getting
a track time around the level,

00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:50.026 A:middle
and then finally,
you're also going

00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:52.406 A:middle
to be submitting another
score for their high score

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:54.946 A:middle
in that level, then those
are three different scores,

00:27:54.946 --> 00:27:57.686 A:middle
you should batch those into
a single NS array and pass

00:27:57.686 --> 00:27:59.686 A:middle
that in via report
scores method.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:00.176 --> 00:28:03.876 A:middle
So that's what new
in leaderboards.

00:28:03.876 --> 00:28:05.066 A:middle
A lot of new stuff.

00:28:05.066 --> 00:28:07.916 A:middle
We've got many more leaderboards
with Leaderboard Sets,

00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:10.586 A:middle
up to 500 leaderboards that you
can define within your game.

00:28:10.796 --> 00:28:13.626 A:middle
We also have Most Recent Score
Leaderboards that allow you

00:28:13.626 --> 00:28:16.016 A:middle
to create custom ranking
solutions for your game.

00:28:16.826 --> 00:28:18.916 A:middle
And we also took a quick
peek under the hood

00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:21.216 A:middle
of how gamed works when
you're submitting scores

00:28:21.436 --> 00:28:23.416 A:middle
and also achievements
and other requests

00:28:23.416 --> 00:28:26.576 A:middle
to the Game Center platform,
and how we do the heavy lifting

00:28:26.576 --> 00:28:29.506 A:middle
for you so you don't have to
worry about this caching logic

00:28:29.506 --> 00:28:30.626 A:middle
and network connectivity.

00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:34.086 A:middle
You just have to submit your
scores and then get right

00:28:34.086 --> 00:28:37.796 A:middle
on to letting players
play your game.

00:28:37.986 --> 00:28:40.666 A:middle
So we've talked a lot
about leaderboards today

00:28:41.176 --> 00:28:44.266 A:middle
on a very related topic that I
think dovetails pretty nicely.

00:28:44.496 --> 00:28:46.986 A:middle
Let's talk about how we can
limit cheating within your game.

00:28:48.296 --> 00:28:52.186 A:middle
Now you may all be familiar a
bit with screens such as this.

00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:55.256 A:middle
In case you don't recognize

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:57.256 A:middle
that there's some
suspicious score values here.

00:28:57.566 --> 00:29:00.876 A:middle
I don't think, you know, the
six top players or however many

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.566 --> 00:29:00.876 A:middle
I don't think, you know, the
six top players or however many

00:29:00.876 --> 00:29:03.686 A:middle
in this game happened to
have earned in 64 max,

00:29:03.756 --> 00:29:06.366 A:middle
but I don't think that's
actually ever humanly possible.

00:29:07.316 --> 00:29:10.256 A:middle
So clearly, something
suspicious is going on here

00:29:10.256 --> 00:29:11.776 A:middle
and it probably means
that there are people

00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:12.686 A:middle
who are cheating in the game.

00:29:13.556 --> 00:29:16.446 A:middle
I'm happy to tell you
today that with iOS 7,

00:29:16.446 --> 00:29:19.906 A:middle
we are doing three things
in order to help you limit

00:29:19.906 --> 00:29:21.486 A:middle
and combat cheating
within your game.

00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:24.926 A:middle
And the first is
completely free for you.

00:29:24.926 --> 00:29:28.186 A:middle
When your game is
submitting scores to gamed

00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:33.076 A:middle
on an iOS 7 device, when it
reaches gamed and gamed goes

00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:35.456 A:middle
to relay that score to
the Game Center server,

00:29:35.496 --> 00:29:39.166 A:middle
it is automatically attaching
a cryptographic signature

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.826 A:middle
to the score submission, as well

00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:42.526 A:middle
as other submissions
like achievements.

00:29:43.036 --> 00:29:46.046 A:middle
So that if a nefarious player
happens to go and tamper

00:29:46.046 --> 00:29:48.276 A:middle
with that submission
when it's in midstream

00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:51.026 A:middle
to the Game Center servers,
that's going to get picked

00:29:51.026 --> 00:29:54.106 A:middle
up automatically and
Game Center is going

00:29:54.106 --> 00:29:55.576 A:middle
to reject that score outright.

00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:57.736 A:middle
That's free for you.

00:29:57.736 --> 00:30:00.836 A:middle
You don't have to do any sort of
coding or configuration steps.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.736 --> 00:30:00.836 A:middle
You don't have to do any sort of
coding or configuration steps.

00:30:01.096 --> 00:30:03.216 A:middle
If your game is running
on iOS 7, we've gotten

00:30:03.216 --> 00:30:04.526 A:middle
that taken care of for you.

00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:07.646 A:middle
Now another thing that
you can do in order

00:30:07.646 --> 00:30:09.406 A:middle
to help limit cheating
within your game

00:30:09.596 --> 00:30:13.646 A:middle
like from an exploit
level or angle is

00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:16.016 A:middle
with the Score Range property

00:30:16.116 --> 00:30:18.776 A:middle
on the Leaderboard Configuration
screen in iTunes Connect.

00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:22.326 A:middle
If you've got a leaderboard
where it's only believable

00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:27.816 A:middle
or only humanly possible for
a player to legitimately earn

00:30:27.856 --> 00:30:31.826 A:middle
at most 10,000 points within
that leaderboard on your game,

00:30:32.616 --> 00:30:35.496 A:middle
then I definitely suggest
that you set that To Value

00:30:35.966 --> 00:30:38.236 A:middle
in the Score Range
field to 10,000.

00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:43.256 A:middle
What this does is it essentially
creates a visible score range

00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:45.656 A:middle
for scores within your
leaderboard for that game.

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:49.686 A:middle
And what I mean by that is if a
player happens to submit, say,

00:30:49.796 --> 00:30:51.656 A:middle
one billion points
to this leaderboard,

00:30:51.966 --> 00:30:53.956 A:middle
when it's really only
humanly possible for them

00:30:53.956 --> 00:30:55.856 A:middle
to earn 10,000 legitimately,

00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:58.236 A:middle
then the Game Center
server is going to accept

00:30:58.236 --> 00:31:01.476 A:middle
that score submission, it's
just not going to be visible

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.236 --> 00:31:01.476 A:middle
that score submission, it's
just not going to be visible

00:31:01.476 --> 00:31:02.946 A:middle
to other players of the game

00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:04.246 A:middle
when they're looking
at that leaderboard.

00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:08.576 A:middle
So we're hanging on to
these scores, right?

00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:12.356 A:middle
There are a lot of reasons,
one is because circumstances

00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:14.246 A:middle
within your game
might actually change.

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.536 A:middle
You might realize that you
forgot to carry the one,

00:31:16.536 --> 00:31:19.356 A:middle
for instance, when you're trying
out your game design docs,

00:31:19.736 --> 00:31:21.986 A:middle
and you realized that it's
actually totally allowable

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:24.626 A:middle
and believable for a player to
earn at most a billion points

00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:25.496 A:middle
within this leaderboard.

00:31:26.096 --> 00:31:28.226 A:middle
So at a later time, you
can come back to the screen

00:31:28.226 --> 00:31:31.236 A:middle
in iTunes Connect, vamp that
To field up to a billion,

00:31:31.236 --> 00:31:35.266 A:middle
and that player's score
that was earlier hidden

00:31:35.266 --> 00:31:37.616 A:middle
by the Game Center server
will now become visible.

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:41.466 A:middle
So this isn't an
unforgiving configuration set.

00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:46.406 A:middle
It's just another arrow in your
quiver to help limit cheating

00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:48.976 A:middle
and exploits within your
game, but it will allow you

00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:51.356 A:middle
to backtrack in case
you decide that, "No,

00:31:51.356 --> 00:31:53.206 A:middle
it's totally OK all along."

00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:58.636 A:middle
The third thing that we are
providing you with iOS 7

00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:00.476 A:middle
and OS X with iTunes Connect

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:00.476 A:middle
and OS X with iTunes Connect

00:32:00.476 --> 00:32:04.256 A:middle
to help limit cheating is a
brand new configuration tool

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:05.206 A:middle
within iTunes Connect.

00:32:05.936 --> 00:32:08.726 A:middle
And this tool is going to help
you audit suspicious player

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:10.616 A:middle
activity on your
leaderboards of your game.

00:32:10.616 --> 00:32:12.366 A:middle
And now, we've got
a lot of things

00:32:12.366 --> 00:32:13.456 A:middle
that we're talking about today.

00:32:13.746 --> 00:32:16.396 A:middle
So I definitely urge you
to check out what's new

00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:18.436 A:middle
on iTunes Connect session
tomorrow 'cause they're going

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.816 A:middle
to go into in-depth as to
how you're going to be able

00:32:20.816 --> 00:32:23.686 A:middle
to actively manage player
activity within your game,

00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:26.036 A:middle
'cause you know you're
being best, you made it.

00:32:26.236 --> 00:32:27.566 A:middle
And it's a living
breathing thing

00:32:27.566 --> 00:32:29.746 A:middle
so you understand it
as it's being played.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:32.366 A:middle
So with this tool, you'll
be able to make sure

00:32:32.366 --> 00:32:34.006 A:middle
that everything is
running smoothly.

00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:39.166 A:middle
So that's what's new in
security for Game Center.

00:32:39.786 --> 00:32:42.286 A:middle
We've got signed submissions,
this is totally free for you.

00:32:42.286 --> 00:32:44.146 A:middle
We are signing every
submission we're making

00:32:44.146 --> 00:32:46.286 A:middle
to the Game Center
platform and to the server.

00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:48.336 A:middle
So if anybody happens
to tamper with it,

00:32:48.506 --> 00:32:51.586 A:middle
when it leaves the device and
goes off into the internet,

00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:53.826 A:middle
we're going to detect that on
the other end and we're going

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:55.256 A:middle
to reject those submissions
outright.

00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:59.296 A:middle
Definitely, I suggest you
use the Score Range field

00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:03.226 A:middle
within iTunes Connect on the
Leaderboard Configuration screen

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:03.226 A:middle
within iTunes Connect on the
Leaderboard Configuration screen

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:07.706 A:middle
in order to filter out
anybody who's exploiting issues

00:33:07.706 --> 00:33:08.416 A:middle
within your game.

00:33:08.416 --> 00:33:12.096 A:middle
And then finally, we've got a
new management tool that's going

00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:14.566 A:middle
to allow you to help audit
suspicious player activity.

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:17.456 A:middle
And you can find out
more about that tomorrow.

00:33:20.096 --> 00:33:24.276 A:middle
So we've gone through new
leaderboard features as well

00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:27.286 A:middle
as how we can help you limit
cheating within your game

00:33:27.286 --> 00:33:28.386 A:middle
if it's Game Center enabled.

00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:32.106 A:middle
Let's move on to the next
topic today-- Challenges.

00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:35.186 A:middle
So Challenges was
a brand new feature

00:33:35.186 --> 00:33:37.876 A:middle
that we introduced last
year, and we've been thrilled

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:41.546 A:middle
with the uptake and adoption
of challenges in your games.

00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:45.386 A:middle
And we introduced, again, last
year with iOS 6 Mountain Lion.

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:48.776 A:middle
And what it really does is
whether your game is a single

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:49.996 A:middle
player or a multiplayer,

00:33:50.596 --> 00:33:53.576 A:middle
challenges add a competitive
element to your game.

00:33:54.106 --> 00:33:56.566 A:middle
If your game support
leaderboards or achievements

00:33:56.566 --> 00:33:59.566 A:middle
within Game Center, and
players can challenge each other

00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:02.716 A:middle
to either meet or beat
those leaderboard scores

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:02.716 A:middle
to either meet or beat
those leaderboard scores

00:34:02.886 --> 00:34:04.736 A:middle
or to earn those achievements
that they've earned.

00:34:04.736 --> 00:34:08.065 A:middle
And this was also supported
automatically whether

00:34:08.065 --> 00:34:11.016 A:middle
through the Game Center
app on iOS or OS X

00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:15.025 A:middle
or through the GK Game Center
view controller, players that go

00:34:15.025 --> 00:34:18.076 A:middle
through our UI, select their
scores, challenge their friends

00:34:18.076 --> 00:34:19.996 A:middle
to beat those scores,
same with achievements,

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:22.666 A:middle
and players would start
receiving notifications

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:24.626 A:middle
and would complete
everything, and it was great.

00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:29.536 A:middle
We also provided you, however,
with API to extend your game

00:34:29.536 --> 00:34:32.416 A:middle
for custom challenge
gameplay to hook into events

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.116 A:middle
when players happen to
complete a challenge,

00:34:34.446 --> 00:34:37.025 A:middle
and also to allow you to issue
challenges programmatically

00:34:37.025 --> 00:34:37.676 A:middle
within your game.

00:34:38.806 --> 00:34:42.556 A:middle
So before we talk about what's
new in Challenges this year,

00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:44.206 A:middle
let's just do a quick run

00:34:44.206 --> 00:34:45.856 A:middle
through of how Challenges
work currently.

00:34:46.806 --> 00:34:49.906 A:middle
So let's say Tom is playing
a racing game and he happens

00:34:49.906 --> 00:34:52.636 A:middle
to earn a lap time of 50
seconds around the track.

00:34:53.646 --> 00:34:55.706 A:middle
Then he could challenge
Alice to go

00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:57.516 A:middle
and beat his lap
time of 50 seconds.

00:34:57.516 --> 00:34:59.596 A:middle
So he sends a challenge
to Alice.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:03.846 A:middle
Alice gets that challenge
and she opens up your game,

00:35:04.186 --> 00:35:06.476 A:middle
and she happens to play that
same track getting a score

00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:09.256 A:middle
of 40-second lap time.

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:12.006 A:middle
Now, 40 seconds is
better than 50 seconds,

00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:14.436 A:middle
so Alice has completed
that challenge.

00:35:14.436 --> 00:35:16.316 A:middle
She gets a push notification
to her device

00:35:16.316 --> 00:35:17.846 A:middle
from the Game Center
server telling her

00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:19.006 A:middle
that she just beat
the challenge.

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:21.966 A:middle
Automatically in the background,
since the score challenge,

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:25.656 A:middle
Tom gets a new challenge
from Alice challenging him

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.416 A:middle
to beat her score of 40 seconds.

00:35:28.576 --> 00:35:33.226 A:middle
So that's great and that's
how Challenges work currently.

00:35:34.056 --> 00:35:36.126 A:middle
But let's say that
Tom happened to earn

00:35:36.126 --> 00:35:39.826 A:middle
that lap time using a beat-up
old pickup truck per se.

00:35:40.316 --> 00:35:43.536 A:middle
So it might be hard to actually
get 50 seconds as a lap time

00:35:43.536 --> 00:35:46.316 A:middle
with a beat-up old
pickup truck and much,

00:35:46.316 --> 00:35:48.276 A:middle
much harder than doing it
with, say, a super car.

00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:52.006 A:middle
So how can we make it such that
when Alice gets that challenge

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:55.836 A:middle
from Tom that she can only
complete that challenge as long

00:35:55.836 --> 00:36:00.076 A:middle
as she's earned that score
with the same gameplay context

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:55.836 --> 00:36:00.076 A:middle
as she's earned that score
with the same gameplay context

00:36:00.076 --> 00:36:01.516 A:middle
that Tom used to earn his score?

00:36:02.676 --> 00:36:04.246 A:middle
Well, that's what a new feature,

00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:06.476 A:middle
Modal Challenges,
allows you to do.

00:36:07.336 --> 00:36:09.696 A:middle
Now, Modal Challenges, what
they allow you to do is

00:36:09.696 --> 00:36:11.956 A:middle
when you're reporting scores
and reporting achievements

00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:14.586 A:middle
to Game Center, you can
optionally provide us

00:36:14.586 --> 00:36:17.656 A:middle
with a list of challenges
that you wish the server

00:36:17.656 --> 00:36:19.096 A:middle
to consider for completion.

00:36:19.986 --> 00:36:21.956 A:middle
And this entails some new API.

00:36:22.756 --> 00:36:27.026 A:middle
Report Scores and Report
Achievements now have extra

00:36:27.026 --> 00:36:29.536 A:middle
methods for Report Scores
with Eligible Challenges

00:36:29.536 --> 00:36:31.756 A:middle
with Completion Handler
and Report Achievements

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:34.006 A:middle
with Eligible Challenges
with Completion Handler.

00:36:34.896 --> 00:36:37.806 A:middle
This API doesn't replace
the current Report Scores

00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:39.716 A:middle
and Report Achievements
API that you know.

00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:43.356 A:middle
It's really just an augmented
version in case you wish

00:36:43.356 --> 00:36:45.796 A:middle
to make use of Modal
Challenges within your game.

00:36:46.706 --> 00:36:48.826 A:middle
So let's take a look
at how we can make sure

00:36:48.826 --> 00:36:52.636 A:middle
that when Alice is earning
her lap time around this track

00:36:52.636 --> 00:36:55.026 A:middle
in your game that she
only completes challenges

00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:58.946 A:middle
that were earned for
that exact same car

00:36:58.946 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
that Alice has raced
around with.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.946 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
that Alice has raced
around with.

00:37:00.536 --> 00:37:03.946 A:middle
So at the end of Alice's
play through, right,

00:37:04.356 --> 00:37:07.246 A:middle
first thing that you could do
is load the Received Challenges

00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:08.916 A:middle
that Alice got from her friends,

00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:11.146 A:middle
and that completion
handler is called back.

00:37:11.676 --> 00:37:13.916 A:middle
You could filter through
any of the score challenges

00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:16.396 A:middle
because we only really care
about lap times in this case.

00:37:17.146 --> 00:37:19.716 A:middle
For every score challenge
that Alice has received

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:23.426 A:middle
from her friend, there
is a context property.

00:37:24.456 --> 00:37:27.696 A:middle
Now this is something that has
existed forever in Game Center.

00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:31.686 A:middle
Every score has a UN64
property called context

00:37:31.906 --> 00:37:34.806 A:middle
that you can add any value
that you wish to the score.

00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:37.766 A:middle
And when you either submit
it to a leaderboard or attach

00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:40.056 A:middle
to a challenge, that context
is going to be attached

00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:42.046 A:middle
to that score on the other end.

00:37:42.266 --> 00:37:46.506 A:middle
So you could embed the car
model that Tom happened to race

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:48.896 A:middle
around the track with on
that score that he used

00:37:48.896 --> 00:37:49.736 A:middle
to create the challenge.

00:37:50.306 --> 00:37:51.786 A:middle
And then on Alice's device,

00:37:52.016 --> 00:37:54.286 A:middle
you can pull the car
model out of that score.

00:37:55.676 --> 00:37:57.846 A:middle
All you need to do is check
to see whether the car model

00:37:57.846 --> 00:37:58.916 A:middle
for that challenge happens

00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:01.236 A:middle
to match the car
model Alice just used

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:01.236 A:middle
to match the car
model Alice just used

00:38:01.236 --> 00:38:02.156 A:middle
to race around the track.

00:38:03.046 --> 00:38:04.836 A:middle
And if it does match,
you can add it

00:38:04.836 --> 00:38:06.696 A:middle
to these challenges
with same car array.

00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:08.746 A:middle
Really, just a list
of challenges you wish

00:38:08.746 --> 00:38:11.076 A:middle
to be considered by the Game
Center servers for completion.

00:38:12.656 --> 00:38:16.556 A:middle
And finally, you're going to use
the new API for Report Scores.

00:38:17.416 --> 00:38:20.316 A:middle
You're going to pass the
score that Alice just earned

00:38:20.316 --> 00:38:23.886 A:middle
in her play through session
and you're going to pass a list

00:38:23.886 --> 00:38:26.896 A:middle
of the challenges that
were created with scores

00:38:27.146 --> 00:38:28.686 A:middle
with the exact same care

00:38:28.766 --> 00:38:31.436 A:middle
that Alice just raced
around the track end.

00:38:31.436 --> 00:38:33.086 A:middle
And then the optional
completion handler.

00:38:33.616 --> 00:38:35.186 A:middle
And that's it.

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:37.626 A:middle
That's how Modal
Challenges work.

00:38:38.056 --> 00:38:40.916 A:middle
As well as making sure
that only challenges

00:38:40.916 --> 00:38:43.056 A:middle
that makes sense can be
completed within your game,

00:38:43.326 --> 00:38:45.116 A:middle
this also allows
you to do things

00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:47.696 A:middle
like challenge-specific modes
within your game so that

00:38:47.696 --> 00:38:50.166 A:middle
when a player launches
your game because they wish

00:38:50.166 --> 00:38:52.466 A:middle
to play a single
challenge, you could set them

00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:56.456 A:middle
up an entirely new gameplay mode
so that when they are in a score

00:38:56.456 --> 00:38:58.706 A:middle
in that mode, only that
one challenge is completed.

00:38:59.426 --> 00:39:00.806 A:middle
Really, it's all up to you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.426 --> 00:39:00.806 A:middle
Really, it's all up to you.

00:39:02.796 --> 00:39:05.276 A:middle
A new feature that we
have for Challenges

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:08.526 A:middle
as well regards programmatically
issuing challenges

00:39:08.526 --> 00:39:09.966 A:middle
within your game.

00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:14.126 A:middle
Now, we allowed you to
programmatically send Challenges

00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:17.636 A:middle
to players within your game when
we released Challenges in iOS 6

00:39:17.826 --> 00:39:18.946 A:middle
and OS X Mountain Lion.

00:39:19.796 --> 00:39:22.496 A:middle
And we further augmented
this with iOS 7.

00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:25.416 A:middle
So let's say that your
player just happened

00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:28.686 A:middle
to complete a level and they
earned a score of 500 points

00:39:28.686 --> 00:39:30.126 A:middle
and maybe they even
earned an achievement,

00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:33.526 A:middle
right now will be a great
time to allow your players

00:39:33.526 --> 00:39:35.136 A:middle
to send a challenge
to their friends.

00:39:35.866 --> 00:39:37.926 A:middle
You don't want them to have to
exit your game in order to go

00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:40.446 A:middle
into the Game Center app to
do this, it's better for them

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:42.236 A:middle
to just do it right here
so that they can get

00:39:42.236 --> 00:39:44.696 A:middle
on with playing your game.

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:48.856 A:middle
Now again, last year, with
iOS 6 and OS X Mountain Lion,

00:39:49.076 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
we allowed you to do this.

00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:53.776 A:middle
We're making it even easier
this year by providing you

00:39:53.776 --> 00:39:57.466 A:middle
with a friend picker and compose
controller that we create

00:39:57.466 --> 00:39:59.306 A:middle
on your behalf and
present to the player,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.116 --> 00:40:01.746 A:middle
where they get a list
of their friends,

00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:03.286 A:middle
and if it's an achievement
challenge

00:40:03.286 --> 00:40:05.386 A:middle
which friends have earned
this achievement or eligible

00:40:05.386 --> 00:40:09.096 A:middle
to receive this challenge, the
player can then select friends,

00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:12.086 A:middle
one or many, that they wish
to send this challenge to,

00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:15.946 A:middle
pressing the Next button, up
comes a composed controller

00:40:16.276 --> 00:40:18.186 A:middle
with a preformatted
default message

00:40:18.186 --> 00:40:21.756 A:middle
that you can optionally pass
to us that they can edit,

00:40:21.756 --> 00:40:23.986 A:middle
and then they can choose to send
that challenge to their friends.

00:40:25.476 --> 00:40:29.906 A:middle
Using this composed
controller flow is very,

00:40:29.906 --> 00:40:31.286 A:middle
very straightforward.

00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:33.196 A:middle
And let's take a look
at how we can do this

00:40:33.196 --> 00:40:34.516 A:middle
with achievement challenges.

00:40:35.756 --> 00:40:36.856 A:middle
The first thing that
you're going

00:40:36.856 --> 00:40:40.856 A:middle
to do is allocate your GK
achievement object just

00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.736 A:middle
like you would in any
achievement challenge

00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:44.736 A:middle
that you wish to issue
programmatically previously.

00:40:45.416 --> 00:40:48.096 A:middle
You set up the achievement,
setting the identifier

00:40:48.096 --> 00:40:50.386 A:middle
with the appropriate
identifier on iTunes Connect.

00:40:51.206 --> 00:40:52.756 A:middle
And you make sure that you set

00:40:52.756 --> 00:40:54.816 A:middle
that percent complete
value to 100 percent.

00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:56.796 A:middle
You can only challenge friends

00:40:56.796 --> 00:41:00.096 A:middle
to 100 percent complete
achievement, not part way.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:56.796 --> 00:41:00.096 A:middle
to 100 percent complete
achievement, not part way.

00:41:00.676 --> 00:41:04.586 A:middle
And then, to get this
UI view controller

00:41:04.726 --> 00:41:06.596 A:middle
that represents the
composed sequence,

00:41:07.456 --> 00:41:08.786 A:middle
you're going to call a new API.

00:41:09.826 --> 00:41:13.716 A:middle
And it's available on both
GK achievement and GK score,

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.196 A:middle
and it's this method here.

00:41:15.976 --> 00:41:18.486 A:middle
Its challenge composed
controller with players

00:41:18.666 --> 00:41:21.276 A:middle
where you can pass in an
optional list of friends

00:41:21.276 --> 00:41:23.466 A:middle
of the local player that
you wish to be preselected.

00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:26.956 A:middle
Then a message which is
an optional NS string

00:41:26.956 --> 00:41:29.796 A:middle
that you can pass that will pop
up in the composed controller

00:41:29.986 --> 00:41:32.066 A:middle
as the default message
that players can then edit.

00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:34.056 A:middle
And then the completion handler.

00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:36.796 A:middle
And when the completion
handler is called back,

00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:38.496 A:middle
that means that the
player happen

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.356 A:middle
to either send the
challenge to their friends

00:41:40.886 --> 00:41:42.706 A:middle
or cancel sending the challenge.

00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:45.396 A:middle
And at this point, you need
to dismiss the view controller

00:41:45.396 --> 00:41:48.286 A:middle
and then do whatever
post processing you wish

00:41:48.496 --> 00:41:50.326 A:middle
because we also tell you
whether the player happened

00:41:50.326 --> 00:41:54.006 A:middle
to really issue that challenge,
and if they did, which friends

00:41:54.006 --> 00:41:55.946 A:middle
and player IDs they
sent that challenge to.

00:41:56.496 --> 00:41:59.586 A:middle
And then finally, once
you've gotten this incense

00:41:59.586 --> 00:42:02.246 A:middle
of the UI view controller,
you just need to present it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.586 --> 00:42:02.246 A:middle
of the UI view controller,
you just need to present it

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:04.806 A:middle
like you would any other UI
view controller within your app.

00:42:06.216 --> 00:42:07.156 A:middle
And that's it.

00:42:07.156 --> 00:42:08.776 A:middle
That's how you do
programmatic issuing

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.036 A:middle
of challenges with iOS 7.

00:42:11.316 --> 00:42:14.386 A:middle
We think it makes it even
easier in order to allow players

00:42:14.386 --> 00:42:15.686 A:middle
to send challenges
to each other.

00:42:16.966 --> 00:42:19.346 A:middle
So you may be familiar already

00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:22.526 A:middle
with our existing
Issue Challenge

00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:23.656 A:middle
to Players Message method.

00:42:24.496 --> 00:42:26.646 A:middle
And since we've really
streamlined the way

00:42:27.016 --> 00:42:30.766 A:middle
that you can send challenges to
friends of your local player,

00:42:31.046 --> 00:42:32.816 A:middle
we're deciding to
deprecate this method.

00:42:33.516 --> 00:42:35.026 A:middle
And instead, we urge you to move

00:42:35.026 --> 00:42:37.196 A:middle
on to using the Challenge
Composed Controller

00:42:37.196 --> 00:42:41.236 A:middle
with Players Message
Completion Handler, the new API.

00:42:41.446 --> 00:42:45.116 A:middle
Now, in case your game is
running on an iOS 7 device

00:42:45.116 --> 00:42:48.826 A:middle
and is still using this legacy
API, they'll still work,

00:42:49.246 --> 00:42:51.696 A:middle
but we're going to present
a composed controller

00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:54.866 A:middle
and friend picker to the player
on your behalf automatically.

00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:58.386 A:middle
And this is great, but
I definitely urge you

00:42:58.386 --> 00:43:00.006 A:middle
to consider moving
over to the new API

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.386 --> 00:43:00.006 A:middle
to consider moving
over to the new API

00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:02.826 A:middle
because if you were
programmatically sending

00:43:02.826 --> 00:43:05.196 A:middle
challenges in the middle of
a gameplay session per se,

00:43:05.556 --> 00:43:08.096 A:middle
you definitely don't want
a view controller to pop

00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:11.516 A:middle
up in the middle of a player
jumping over a very wide pit.

00:43:11.696 --> 00:43:13.916 A:middle
So you know when
the timing is best

00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.066 A:middle
to actually present this UI.

00:43:15.796 --> 00:43:18.466 A:middle
So definitely move on to
the new API that we have.

00:43:20.356 --> 00:43:22.206 A:middle
So that's what's
new in Challenges.

00:43:22.436 --> 00:43:25.056 A:middle
We've got modal challenges
for selective completion

00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:27.106 A:middle
of challenges within
your game based

00:43:27.106 --> 00:43:28.506 A:middle
on context that you define.

00:43:29.426 --> 00:43:33.186 A:middle
We've got brand new programmatic
issuing of challenges API

00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:35.726 A:middle
to make it even easier to
send challenges to friends

00:43:35.756 --> 00:43:36.926 A:middle
with a local player
in your game.

00:43:37.996 --> 00:43:40.676 A:middle
And we've also-- because
of this streamlined API,

00:43:40.746 --> 00:43:42.826 A:middle
we've deprecated the
issue challenge API.

00:43:42.826 --> 00:43:46.036 A:middle
And if your game still happens
to use it when it's running

00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:49.566 A:middle
on iOS 7, it's still going
to work, but the new UI,

00:43:49.566 --> 00:43:51.776 A:middle
that new view controller,
is automatically going

00:43:51.776 --> 00:43:53.136 A:middle
to be presented to
the local player.

00:43:54.626 --> 00:43:57.176 A:middle
So that's Challenges,
that's what's new

00:43:57.276 --> 00:43:58.616 A:middle
in Game Center for Challenges.

00:43:58.616 --> 00:44:00.766 A:middle
Let's move on to the next
big topic of the day--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.616 --> 00:44:00.766 A:middle
Let's move on to the next
big topic of the day--

00:44:01.276 --> 00:44:03.526 A:middle
handling events relevant
to the local player.

00:44:04.116 --> 00:44:07.006 A:middle
Now you may be familiar
with handling events

00:44:07.006 --> 00:44:09.806 A:middle
for the local player in the
Game Kit Framework today.

00:44:10.186 --> 00:44:12.856 A:middle
We have a lot of different
singleton objects that you had

00:44:12.856 --> 00:44:14.126 A:middle
to declare delegates for.

00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:18.146 A:middle
If you want to hook into when
the local player completed the

00:44:18.146 --> 00:44:20.136 A:middle
challenge, we have the GK
Challenge Event Handler

00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:23.216 A:middle
Singleton and we had the GK
Challenge Event Handler Delegate

00:44:23.266 --> 00:44:26.496 A:middle
Protocol that you would set as a
delegate for that event handler.

00:44:26.826 --> 00:44:28.526 A:middle
We also had things
for turn-based match--

00:44:28.676 --> 00:44:31.756 A:middle
or for a turn-based gameplay,
they had a singleton object,

00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:34.226 A:middle
and the GK Matchmaker
had an invite property.

00:44:35.176 --> 00:44:39.186 A:middle
Well, we've thoroughly revamped
the way and redefined the way

00:44:39.186 --> 00:44:42.266 A:middle
in iOS 7 that you can
handle events relevant

00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:43.146 A:middle
to the local player.

00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:45.486 A:middle
And we're doing it like this.

00:44:46.386 --> 00:44:49.786 A:middle
You can think of the GK Local
Player instance as the source

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:52.516 A:middle
of all the events that are
relevant to your local player.

00:44:53.446 --> 00:44:55.966 A:middle
And so, whether the players
received the challenge,

00:44:55.966 --> 00:44:58.306 A:middle
completed the challenge,
gotten a new turn,

00:44:58.306 --> 00:45:01.046 A:middle
maybe a turn-based invite
or some matchmaking invite,

00:44:58.306 --> 00:45:01.046 A:middle
maybe a turn-based invite
or some matchmaking invite,

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.706 A:middle
that's going to be channeled
through the local player.

00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:08.006 A:middle
And the local player can have
multiple listeners registered

00:45:08.036 --> 00:45:08.346 A:middle
to it.

00:45:09.296 --> 00:45:11.916 A:middle
And when a local player
listener is registered

00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:14.536 A:middle
on the local player and a
message happens to come in,

00:45:14.536 --> 00:45:17.866 A:middle
an event is triggered, that
listener or any listener

00:45:17.866 --> 00:45:21.926 A:middle
that is compatible for that
callback is going to get called.

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:25.256 A:middle
Your listener object when you
register on a local player,

00:45:25.486 --> 00:45:28.626 A:middle
it needs to conform to the GK
Local Player Listener Protocol.

00:45:29.356 --> 00:45:33.796 A:middle
And this protocol, in turn,
conforms to three sub-protocols,

00:45:34.516 --> 00:45:36.156 A:middle
all defining optional methods.

00:45:36.156 --> 00:45:38.596 A:middle
None of the methods in these
protocols are required,

00:45:38.596 --> 00:45:39.686 A:middle
so you can pick and choose.

00:45:39.726 --> 00:45:42.536 A:middle
First is the GK Challenge
Listener Subprotocol

00:45:42.816 --> 00:45:44.656 A:middle
that defines the
various callbacks

00:45:44.656 --> 00:45:45.896 A:middle
that you can optionally conform

00:45:45.896 --> 00:45:49.116 A:middle
to when the player has completed
a challenge or had some sort

00:45:49.116 --> 00:45:51.156 A:middle
of challenge relevant
event occur.

00:45:51.836 --> 00:45:54.136 A:middle
We've also got GK
Turn-Based Event Listener

00:45:54.426 --> 00:45:56.616 A:middle
for turn-based gaming
specific callbacks

00:45:56.956 --> 00:46:00.476 A:middle
and GK Invite Event
Listener for GK Matchmaking,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:56.956 --> 00:46:00.476 A:middle
and GK Invite Event
Listener for GK Matchmaking,

00:46:00.696 --> 00:46:02.426 A:middle
real-time matchmaking callbacks.

00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:06.646 A:middle
Once you've created your
listener, in order to register,

00:46:06.646 --> 00:46:07.836 A:middle
it's very straightforward.

00:46:08.596 --> 00:46:10.696 A:middle
I'm going to adopt one of
these subprotocols or any

00:46:10.696 --> 00:46:13.356 A:middle
of those methods and those
subprotocols, and you're going

00:46:13.356 --> 00:46:16.176 A:middle
to call on the Local Player
Instance Register Listener

00:46:16.436 --> 00:46:19.406 A:middle
passing this listener
instance that you've set up.

00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:23.456 A:middle
And you can pass-- you can
register multiple listeners.

00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.746 A:middle
And you also don't need
to worry about the timing

00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:28.396 A:middle
that you're registering
these listeners.

00:46:28.796 --> 00:46:31.706 A:middle
You may be familiar that
previously we asked you

00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:35.756 A:middle
to register or set delegates
on turn-based event handlers,

00:46:35.756 --> 00:46:37.886 A:middle
challenge event handlers,
all those other singletons

00:46:38.276 --> 00:46:40.596 A:middle
in the authentication
handler callback.

00:46:41.276 --> 00:46:43.176 A:middle
Well, you don't need to
worry about that anymore.

00:46:43.386 --> 00:46:46.616 A:middle
In case your-- the local player
happened to receive some sort

00:46:46.616 --> 00:46:49.536 A:middle
of event and there is
no listener registered

00:46:49.536 --> 00:46:51.636 A:middle
for the local player at
that time that could handle

00:46:51.636 --> 00:46:54.246 A:middle
that event, the local player
is going to cache that event.

00:46:54.916 --> 00:46:57.406 A:middle
So when you register
listener at some time later,

00:46:57.936 --> 00:47:01.156 A:middle
it'll have that event to
dispatch to your listener or all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:57.936 --> 00:47:01.156 A:middle
it'll have that event to
dispatch to your listener or all

00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:06.326 A:middle
of the listeners that are
capable of handling that event.

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:09.376 A:middle
So since we've talked a
bit about challenges today,

00:47:09.616 --> 00:47:11.186 A:middle
how about we take a look
at the group of methods

00:47:11.186 --> 00:47:13.776 A:middle
that you can implement
optionally within your listener

00:47:14.016 --> 00:47:16.386 A:middle
in order to hook into
challenge relevant gameplay?

00:47:17.676 --> 00:47:21.156 A:middle
The GK Challenge Listener
Subprotocol defines four

00:47:21.156 --> 00:47:25.086 A:middle
different methods that you can
optionally implement in order

00:47:25.086 --> 00:47:27.526 A:middle
to hook into challenge-specific
events concerning the

00:47:27.526 --> 00:47:28.186 A:middle
local player.

00:47:28.956 --> 00:47:31.556 A:middle
Let's take a quick look
through these different methods,

00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:33.846 A:middle
what they mean, and
how you can use them

00:47:34.046 --> 00:47:37.026 A:middle
within your listener
object or objects in order

00:47:37.096 --> 00:47:40.336 A:middle
to enable custom challenge
based gameplay in your game.

00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:44.926 A:middle
The first is concerning
selecting challenges.

00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:48.226 A:middle
That is, when a player
happens to receive a challenge

00:47:48.226 --> 00:47:50.696 A:middle
from a friend, whether
they are playing your game

00:47:50.696 --> 00:47:54.576 A:middle
or they're hanging around
in the Game Center app,

00:47:55.036 --> 00:47:58.876 A:middle
and they tap an iOS
notification center banner

00:47:59.086 --> 00:48:01.796 A:middle
or they tap a play bubble
within the Game Center app,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.086 --> 00:48:01.796 A:middle
or they tap a play bubble
within the Game Center app,

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:04.166 A:middle
or if they tap a play bubble

00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:06.036 A:middle
within the GK Game
Center view controller,

00:48:06.506 --> 00:48:09.456 A:middle
we're going to call back to
your listener Player Wants

00:48:09.456 --> 00:48:10.266 A:middle
to Play Challenge.

00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.146 A:middle
And really, what this means is

00:48:12.146 --> 00:48:14.956 A:middle
that the player tapped this
challenge banner and they want

00:48:14.956 --> 00:48:17.276 A:middle
to play your game in order
to complete that challenge.

00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:20.406 A:middle
So at that point, if you've
got challenge-specific gameplay

00:48:20.406 --> 00:48:24.356 A:middle
modes within your game, you
can call Self-Start Challenge

00:48:24.356 --> 00:48:26.086 A:middle
for Challenge if you've
got a method like that,

00:48:26.086 --> 00:48:27.646 A:middle
passing in the challenge to set

00:48:27.646 --> 00:48:29.816 A:middle
up this gameplay
mode for challenges.

00:48:31.176 --> 00:48:33.656 A:middle
Similar to selecting
challenges within your game,

00:48:33.656 --> 00:48:36.076 A:middle
we also got receiving
challenges.

00:48:36.646 --> 00:48:39.466 A:middle
This is an event that
is called back to your--

00:48:39.466 --> 00:48:40.966 A:middle
on your local player listener

00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:44.526 A:middle
when the player is playing your
game currently and they happen

00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:45.906 A:middle
to receive a challenge
from a friend.

00:48:46.596 --> 00:48:49.836 A:middle
At that time, player did receive
challenge is going to called

00:48:49.836 --> 00:48:53.356 A:middle
on your listener and you may
wish to present some custom UI,

00:48:53.356 --> 00:48:55.366 A:middle
like if Alice sent
Tom a challenge

00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:57.106 A:middle
to beat her track
score, you might want

00:48:57.106 --> 00:49:00.116 A:middle
to show Alice's picture right
there with the challenge message

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.106 --> 00:49:00.116 A:middle
to show Alice's picture right
there with the challenge message

00:49:00.116 --> 00:49:01.166 A:middle
that she happened to define.

00:49:01.546 --> 00:49:03.196 A:middle
And you could do that
within this method.

00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:08.066 A:middle
The last two methods in the GK
Challenge Listener Protocol are

00:49:08.066 --> 00:49:09.966 A:middle
concerning completing
challenges.

00:49:10.786 --> 00:49:13.516 A:middle
The first, when the local player
happened to complete a challenge

00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:15.806 A:middle
that they receive from a friend,

00:49:15.866 --> 00:49:18.826 A:middle
Player Did Complete Challenge
Issued by Friend is called

00:49:18.826 --> 00:49:20.966 A:middle
when the local player completes
a challenge in your game.

00:49:21.596 --> 00:49:24.026 A:middle
And at this point, you know,
if you want to congra--

00:49:24.026 --> 00:49:26.356 A:middle
display a congrats banner to
the player or whatever UI,

00:49:26.826 --> 00:49:29.366 A:middle
maybe even reward them
gameplay-wise within your game,

00:49:29.516 --> 00:49:30.356 A:middle
you could do that here.

00:49:30.856 --> 00:49:35.606 A:middle
And then, also, when the
local player's friend happened

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:38.676 A:middle
to have completed the challenge
that the local player sent then,

00:49:39.506 --> 00:49:43.146 A:middle
that's where Player Issue
Challenge was Completed

00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:45.656 A:middle
by Friend is going to be
called back on your listener.

00:49:46.406 --> 00:49:48.246 A:middle
At this point, you might
want to inform the player

00:49:48.246 --> 00:49:49.856 A:middle
that perhaps their friends
are a little bit better

00:49:49.856 --> 00:49:53.126 A:middle
than they thought they were,
and again, do whatever you wish

00:49:53.126 --> 00:49:55.466 A:middle
in your game that makes sense.

00:49:56.136 --> 00:49:58.566 A:middle
So that's just how
challenges work

00:49:58.566 --> 00:49:59.956 A:middle
with GK Local Player Listener.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:00.696 --> 00:50:02.546 A:middle
But we're also doing a lot

00:50:02.546 --> 00:50:05.046 A:middle
of things concerning
turn-based gaming as well

00:50:05.046 --> 00:50:06.706 A:middle
as real-time matchmaking.

00:50:07.186 --> 00:50:09.926 A:middle
Those are all built with
the GK Local Player Listener

00:50:10.576 --> 00:50:11.946 A:middle
architecture as well.

00:50:12.796 --> 00:50:15.726 A:middle
And as you may guess, that
means that we are, in turn,

00:50:15.956 --> 00:50:18.276 A:middle
deprecating the GK
Challenge Event Handler,

00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:22.136 A:middle
the GK Turn-Based Event Handler
Singleton and their delegates,

00:50:22.136 --> 00:50:24.206 A:middle
as well as the Invite
Handler property

00:50:24.466 --> 00:50:26.646 A:middle
of the GK Matchmaker object.

00:50:27.806 --> 00:50:30.886 A:middle
And since this affects
multiplayer as well, tomorrow,

00:50:30.886 --> 00:50:33.416 A:middle
Nathan's got a multiplayer
session,

00:50:33.526 --> 00:50:35.836 A:middle
making multiplayer
games with Game Center,

00:50:35.836 --> 00:50:37.876 A:middle
I definitely urge you to
check that out in order

00:50:37.876 --> 00:50:41.196 A:middle
to learn how you can adopt GK
Local Player Listener Protocols,

00:50:41.486 --> 00:50:43.596 A:middle
in order to use turn-based
gaming

00:50:43.596 --> 00:50:45.546 A:middle
within your game
and GK Matchmaking.

00:50:47.616 --> 00:50:51.366 A:middle
So we've learned a lot of
different things today.

00:50:51.486 --> 00:50:54.476 A:middle
In addition to our brand new
UI that we've also got going

00:50:54.476 --> 00:50:56.446 A:middle
on with the GK Game
Center view controller,

00:50:56.846 --> 00:50:59.066 A:middle
we've increased the maximum
amount of leaderboards

00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:02.046 A:middle
that you can use within your
game to 500 leaderboards.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:02.046 A:middle
that you can use within your
game to 500 leaderboards.

00:51:02.466 --> 00:51:04.446 A:middle
And you can impose a
hierarchical structure

00:51:04.446 --> 00:51:07.696 A:middle
on these leaderboards with a new
feature called Leaderboard Sets.

00:51:08.426 --> 00:51:10.726 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
in case you want to make it

00:51:10.726 --> 00:51:14.006 A:middle
such that player scores on
a leaderboard can go both up

00:51:14.006 --> 00:51:17.556 A:middle
and down, and completely
customize the way

00:51:17.556 --> 00:51:19.516 A:middle
that you rank players
within a leaderboard

00:51:19.516 --> 00:51:21.086 A:middle
for your game, we've
got those too.

00:51:22.286 --> 00:51:25.236 A:middle
Security measures that
we're taking on your behalf

00:51:25.236 --> 00:51:28.886 A:middle
and we're also allowing you to
take in order to help combat

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:31.046 A:middle
and limit cheating
within your game.

00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:34.936 A:middle
Challenges, we've
got modal challenges,

00:51:35.046 --> 00:51:36.916 A:middle
further augmenting
challenge-based gameplay,

00:51:37.306 --> 00:51:39.866 A:middle
and making it even easier
for you to allow your friends

00:51:39.866 --> 00:51:42.396 A:middle
to send-- or your
players to send challenges

00:51:42.396 --> 00:51:43.726 A:middle
to their friends
within their game.

00:51:44.736 --> 00:51:48.126 A:middle
And then finally, we have
totally redefined the way

00:51:48.126 --> 00:51:49.926 A:middle
that you can handle
events with--

00:51:49.926 --> 00:51:51.896 A:middle
concerning the GK Local Player--

00:51:52.186 --> 00:51:53.976 A:middle
with the GK Local
Player Listener API.

00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:58.046 A:middle
So it's a ton of stuff that
we've got going on this year,

00:51:58.076 --> 00:52:00.516 A:middle
and that means that you probably
have a lot of questions.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.076 --> 00:52:00.516 A:middle
and that means that you probably
have a lot of questions.

00:52:01.046 --> 00:52:02.936 A:middle
So Allan Schaffer,
he's our Graphics

00:52:02.936 --> 00:52:04.386 A:middle
and Game Technologies
Evangelist.

00:52:04.386 --> 00:52:05.966 A:middle
You can reach him at
this address right here.

00:52:05.966 --> 00:52:09.276 A:middle
Ask him if you've got any
questions after the conference.

00:52:09.796 --> 00:52:12.456 A:middle
Also, we've got brand
new documentation updated

00:52:12.456 --> 00:52:15.346 A:middle
for this year's Game Kit
Framework available at the URL

00:52:15.346 --> 00:52:18.746 A:middle
in the screen, as well as
at developer.apple.com,

00:52:18.746 --> 00:52:21.496 A:middle
we've got some sample code
exhibiting how you can make use

00:52:21.496 --> 00:52:25.926 A:middle
of best practices in order to
adopt Game Center features,

00:52:26.296 --> 00:52:29.456 A:middle
both new for this year
with iOS 7 and preexisting.

00:52:29.786 --> 00:52:30.956 A:middle
So definitely check that out.

00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:34.736 A:middle
As well as Apple developer
forms, definitely use those.

00:52:35.016 --> 00:52:38.676 A:middle
So a couple of sessions, what's
new in iTunes Connect tomorrow,

00:52:38.876 --> 00:52:40.806 A:middle
