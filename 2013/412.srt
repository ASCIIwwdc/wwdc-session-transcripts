[ Applause ]

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:15.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:19.216 A:middle
Welcome to Continuous
Integration in Xcode 5.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.316 A:middle
My name is Andrew Nesbitt.

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:22.816 A:middle
I am the engineering manager

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:24.996 A:middle
on the OS X Server
part of this feature.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:30.246 A:middle
So as you heard in
yesterday's platform kick off,

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:34.846 A:middle
the theme for Xcode 5
is building better apps.

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:37.266 A:middle
And Xcode 5 is packed, full
of amazing new features

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.426 A:middle
to help you share this goal.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.636 A:middle
In this afternoon, we're going
to spend our time looking at one

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.766 A:middle
of those new features in
particular and that is

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.456 A:middle
of course Continuous
Integration.

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:48.216 A:middle
And hopefully you will learn
how you can use Continuous

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.356 A:middle
Integration to build
better apps.

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:55.446 A:middle
So the lineup for this
afternoon is that we will start

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:57.736 A:middle
out with a little bit of a
terminology refresh of the some

00:00:57.736 --> 00:00:59.796 A:middle
of the key Xcode terms
that we need to know.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
And after that we'll
dig right in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
And after that we'll
dig right in.

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:04.726 A:middle
We'll start exploring the
Xcode Service and we'll talk

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.886 A:middle
for a while about
configuring OS X Server

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:08.106 A:middle
for Continuous Integration.

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:11.376 A:middle
After that we'll do a
deep dive into Xcode 5

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.406 A:middle
and the band new bots
feature that we have.

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:16.856 A:middle
And then we'll spend some time
looking at the web application

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:18.636 A:middle
and the feature that
we call Scoreboard.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:21.536 A:middle
And after that we'll finish
with some best practices

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:24.796 A:middle
that we have learned inside
Apple for deploying the service.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.486 A:middle
So the big question is why
use Continuous Integration?

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.926 A:middle
Over the years, through
many iOS and OS X releases,

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.966 A:middle
we have given you an enormous
toolbox of features to use.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.606 A:middle
And you guys have definitely
arisen to the challenge

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:40.106 A:middle
by shipping amazing
applications.

00:01:41.186 --> 00:01:44.076 A:middle
And of course, shipping
amazing applications we all know

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:45.016 A:middle
requires testing.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:49.216 A:middle
And as the number of OS versions
that you target and the types

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:52.076 A:middle
of devices that you target
skill it becomes more

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:54.326 A:middle
and more difficult to test
your applications well.

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:56.456 A:middle
And this is where Continuous
Integration comes into play.

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.726 A:middle
Continuous Integration will
give you the opportunity

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.726 A:middle
Continuous Integration will
give you the opportunity

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.796 A:middle
to do testing on
multiple OS versions

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:04.576 A:middle
and multiple hardware models.

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.946 A:middle
Of course, once you have
a server in the mix,

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:10.526 A:middle
you're now in the
position to build, analyze

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.356 A:middle
and test your project often.

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:15.906 A:middle
And of course, having a server
will give you the opportunity

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.686 A:middle
to catch problems quickly and
this is the key automatically.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:24.576 A:middle
Many of you have more than
one Mac and I'm sure a lot

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.756 A:middle
of you have a Mac sitting in
your office doing nothing.

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:30.626 A:middle
And this is a great opportunity
to put that Mac back to work.

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:33.236 A:middle
Let the server do the
heavy-lifting of building your--

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.816 A:middle
building your project
automatically.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.016 A:middle
And having a server lets you
do things that you can't do

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.166 A:middle
in Xcode or that you
can't do in Xcode feasibly

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.436 A:middle
and the big thing here is
the ability to gather, build,

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:45.226 A:middle
and test history for
your project over time.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.356 A:middle
And, of course, having a server

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.126 A:middle
in the mix gives you an awesome
new way to distribute builds

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:54.206 A:middle
to your team and I see some
examples about coming up.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.976 A:middle
So to get started, let's
talk for a little second

00:02:57.976 --> 00:02:59.886 A:middle
about some terminology that
you're going to need to know.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:02.496 A:middle
There are three key terms.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.186 A:middle
Number one is that of a scheme.

00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:08.576 A:middle
And a scheme is a very simple
concept; it's just a recipe

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:10.066 A:middle
for building your project.

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
A scheme defines what
targets you're going to build,

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.706 A:middle
what dependent targets
you're going to get built,

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.446 A:middle
and also what build
settings will be pass

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:18.596 A:middle
when those targets do get built.

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:22.236 A:middle
And because we're dealing with
the server, a server needs

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.146 A:middle
to have access to this
scheme information.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:25.906 A:middle
And schemes are typically
personal things,

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.676 A:middle
I'm sure you all have a
bunch of schemes that you set

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:28.736 A:middle
up just the way you like them.

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:32.326 A:middle
But we're going to use a little
extended version of the scheme

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:34.136 A:middle
and that is of a shared scheme.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.146 A:middle
And a shared scheme is
nothing more than a scheme

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:38.466 A:middle
that has been checked in to your
source controller repository

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:40.486 A:middle
and shared with the
rest of your team.

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:43.046 A:middle
So that's item number one.

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:45.596 A:middle
Number two is that of a bot.

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:50.946 A:middle
And a bot is a configuration
for analyzing, building, testing

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:53.416 A:middle
and archiving your
project on a schedule.

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:54.966 A:middle
And we'll come back to
this guy in a second.

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:59.316 A:middle
The third item of terminology
is that of an integration.

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.966 A:middle
And an integration is just
a single run of a bot.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.966 A:middle
And an integration is just
a single run of a bot.

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:04.176 A:middle
So every time your bot
runs, your bot is said

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.866 A:middle
to be performing an integration
or it is integrating.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:12.456 A:middle
So let's look at a little bit
more detail of surrounding bots.

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:16.666 A:middle
So like I said, a bot
is a configuration

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:17.685 A:middle
for building your project.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.736 A:middle
A bot defines what
we're going to build.

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:23.236 A:middle
So there are two things here.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.346 A:middle
Firstly, it defines where
the source code lives

00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:27.256 A:middle
that we are going to build.

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:29.406 A:middle
So what repository that
source code lives in?

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:31.086 A:middle
How are we going to
access that repository

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:32.066 A:middle
to get that source code?

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:36.176 A:middle
And secondly, the project
or the workspace inside

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.726 A:middle
that SCM location that
we're going to access

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:39.926 A:middle
where that project lives?

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:45.646 A:middle
Secondly, a bot defines when
we're going to build it.

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:48.766 A:middle
So we have some great scheduling
options in the Xcode Service.

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:53.546 A:middle
We have periodic options so you
can build your project hourly,

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:57.536 A:middle
daily at a time or weekly on a
day at a time of your chosen.

00:04:58.696 --> 00:04:59.946 A:middle
We have on-commit options.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:02.676 A:middle
So you can build when your
source repository changes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:02.676 A:middle
So you can build when your
source repository changes

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:03.806 A:middle
and you can tell the server

00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:05.826 A:middle
when your source repository
changes by a heap script.

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:08.376 A:middle
Or you can have the
server periodically checked

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:10.926 A:middle
with your SCM server when
your source code is available,

00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:12.276 A:middle
otherwise known as pulling.

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
And of course there's manual.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:16.266 A:middle
So you will-- this will
be you will run the bot

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:17.406 A:middle
when you feel like
running the bot.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:20.816 A:middle
The third slice of the
bot configuration is

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:22.676 A:middle
that of how we're going
to build your project.

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:26.916 A:middle
And this is composed of the
shared scheme information

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:28.616 A:middle
that you've defined
when you set up the bot,

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.696 A:middle
which scheme you'd
like us to use.

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:33.606 A:middle
And then some options, we have
some action options available

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:34.126 A:middle
for your bot.

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:36.926 A:middle
So you can choose whether or
not you would like your bot

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:40.076 A:middle
to perform static analysis,
whether or not you would

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:41.886 A:middle
like your bot to
perform testing.

00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:46.616 A:middle
And if you are performing
testing, which devices

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.096 A:middle
on which you would like
to perform testing.

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:51.356 A:middle
And we support bot testing on
the Mac which is the server.

00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:54.386 A:middle
We support testing on
simulators, we support testing

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:57.296 A:middle
on a single device, we support
testing on multiple devices

00:05:57.716 --> 00:05:59.726 A:middle
or any other combinations
of those settings.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:01.526 A:middle
Where that makes sense?

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:02.716 A:middle
Of course.

00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:06.716 A:middle
And lastly, your bot can define
whether or not you would like us

00:06:06.716 --> 00:06:07.646 A:middle
to produce an archive.

00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:12.026 A:middle
And an archive will produce both
a package and an .xcarchive file

00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:13.846 A:middle
for a Mac project or an IPA

00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:16.086 A:middle
on an .xcarchive file
for an iOS project.

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.126 A:middle
We also have some great
notification settings

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.106 A:middle
for the Xcode Service.

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:23.166 A:middle
So when you set up a bot,
you got a couple of options.

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:28.496 A:middle
So we let you notify people, we
have checked in code to that bot

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.956 A:middle
so all the source controls
submissions that have been made

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:34.866 A:middle
since that bot last run, all
those people can get notified

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.566 A:middle
and you can choose whether
to notify those people

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:38.936 A:middle
when the bot is successful
or when the bot fails.

00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:42.946 A:middle
And you can also define
lists of e-mail addresses

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:44.506 A:middle
for people you would
like to e-mail

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:45.436 A:middle
on those conditions as well.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:51.016 A:middle
So the Xcode story can
really be thought of--

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:53.466 A:middle
the Xcode Service story can be
thought off in two parts here.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:55.616 A:middle
So there is OS X Server

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.806 A:middle
and we have an amazing
preview releasable OX X Server,

00:06:57.806 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
and of course there's Xcode 5.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.806 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
and of course there's Xcode 5.

00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:02.886 A:middle
So let's start by digging

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:05.956 A:middle
in to the OS X Server
part of the story first.

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:09.896 A:middle
So in the Mountain
Lion timeframe,

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:12.086 A:middle
we made server an application.

00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:15.036 A:middle
No longer a server, an entirely
separate operating system

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:18.676 A:middle
that you have to set up, Server
is just an app that you purchase

00:07:18.756 --> 00:07:21.116 A:middle
and download and install
from the Mac App Store.

00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:24.026 A:middle
And it's never been simpler to
turn your Mac into a server.

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:29.406 A:middle
And carrying on this theme of
simplicity in the next version

00:07:29.406 --> 00:07:31.206 A:middle
of Server the pre-release
that we have available.

00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:33.326 A:middle
We have some great new features.

00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:34.826 A:middle
And one of those
is simple setup.

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:38.196 A:middle
Simple setup takes out all
the complexities setting

00:07:38.196 --> 00:07:38.836 A:middle
up your server.

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:41.426 A:middle
No longer will you be asked a
bunch of complicated questions

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:44.546 A:middle
about networking configurations
or Apple ID configurations,

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:45.826 A:middle
you're asked one question

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:47.636 A:middle
that is an administrator
user name and password.

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:50.106 A:middle
And once you've entered that
credential, the Server is

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.656 A:middle
up to the races setting
itself up

00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:53.346 A:middle
and within seconds you
have a server available

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:56.976 A:middle
and ready to be used.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.696 A:middle
We also have some
brand new UI in server.

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
Server looks great,
it's never look better

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
Server looks great,
it's never look better

00:08:01.586 --> 00:08:03.926 A:middle
and we're actually servicing
some really useful information

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:05.736 A:middle
that we find that people
really, really want.

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:08.326 A:middle
Like how your service
is behaving,

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:09.916 A:middle
how to access your service

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:11.306 A:middle
and whether your
service is on or off.

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.456 A:middle
So as an example, let's
dig in to what it takes

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:17.066 A:middle
to set up an OS X Server.

00:08:19.116 --> 00:08:21.396 A:middle
So when you launch OS X
Server, you'll see this.

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:23.246 A:middle
And this is the Welcome
menu for the application.

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:26.236 A:middle
And when you click
Continue, you'll be asked

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:27.486 A:middle
for a user name and password.

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:31.196 A:middle
And once you type those
guys in, the Server goes off

00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:35.405 A:middle
and starts doing its thing.

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:36.775 A:middle
And very quickly you're launched

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:38.645 A:middle
into the OS X Server
application.

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:42.186 A:middle
And in the left you'll
see all the services

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.066 A:middle
that the OS X Server
application supports.

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:45.396 A:middle
And on the right, you'll
see the detailed view

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:46.136 A:middle
for those services.

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:50.956 A:middle
So before we go any further,
you're probably all wondering

00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:52.466 A:middle
about the thing that
you're here--

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.646 A:middle
you're here to hear about
which is the Xcode Service.

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:00.476 A:middle
The Xcode Service
when it's turned

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:00.476 A:middle
The Xcode Service
when it's turned

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:03.046 A:middle
on in OS X Server will
start advertising itself

00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:05.396 A:middle
across your network and it
uses Bonjour to do that.

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:08.666 A:middle
So any Xcode 5 user
that's sitting

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.946 A:middle
within your network will see
servers that are available--

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:13.026 A:middle
that have been available, made
available in your network.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:18.466 A:middle
Once the service is turned on,
it's super simple to create

00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:22.626 A:middle
and manage bots that build
both Mac and iOS projects.

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:25.286 A:middle
And if you're a little bit
fuzzy about Access settings,

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:27.956 A:middle
we do have some great ways
to configure that too.

00:09:29.556 --> 00:09:31.306 A:middle
You can define both who
you would like to be able

00:09:31.306 --> 00:09:34.026 A:middle
to create bots on your
server and also who you would

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:35.996 A:middle
like to be able to view
bots on your server.

00:09:35.996 --> 00:09:37.796 A:middle
And you can set this up in
whatever way that you like,

00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:41.856 A:middle
whatever way that makes
sense for your team.

00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:44.216 A:middle
We also have some really,
really great integration

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.446 A:middle
with the Apple Developer
Program.

00:09:45.646 --> 00:09:47.736 A:middle
And this means that you
can join your Server

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.776 A:middle
to your existing
Apple Developer team.

00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:53.086 A:middle
And the question might be well
why I would I want to do that?

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:56.056 A:middle
And the answer is when your
Server joins your team,

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:59.256 A:middle
your Server has the opportunity
to request its own Mac

00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:02.506 A:middle
and iOS signing identities
and also download all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:02.506 A:middle
and iOS signing identities
and also download all

00:10:02.506 --> 00:10:03.686 A:middle
of the team provisioning
profiles

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:04.756 A:middle
that exist for your team.

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.976 A:middle
And this puts us in
a great position.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.726 A:middle
And this brings me on to my
next point which is devices.

00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:13.226 A:middle
OS X Server has great
support for devices for bots.

00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:15.856 A:middle
So once your server is a
member of a developer team,

00:10:16.136 --> 00:10:17.886 A:middle
you'll see devices
in OS X Server.

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.976 A:middle
You can easily add and
remove devices both to

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:24.966 A:middle
and from your team and of
course once you've done that,

00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:27.116 A:middle
those devices become
available when people set

00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:29.686 A:middle
up bots using Xcode 5
against your Server.

00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:35.156 A:middle
Another feature that we've been
asked for a lot in OS X Server

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:38.196 A:middle
for the last couple of years
is source control hosting

00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:39.806 A:middle
and we are adding
this feature too.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.326 A:middle
So, OS X Server will support
Hosted Git repositories

00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:45.516 A:middle
and once they're set up
with just a few clicks,

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:47.596 A:middle
you'll have a Hosted Git
repository that's accessible

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
by SSH, HTTP or HTTPS.

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:51.546 A:middle
And equally you can lock

00:10:51.546 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
that repository done just
the way you like it to.

00:10:54.516 --> 00:11:00.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:54.516 --> 00:11:00.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:01.446 --> 00:11:03.806 A:middle
And of course, if you're
not ready to make the move

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:05.886 A:middle
to hosting your source code
in an OS X Server just yet

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:08.436 A:middle
or you're using an external
source control system

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:12.746 A:middle
like your hub, then OS X Server
will equally well connect

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:13.776 A:middle
to those repositories too.

00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:16.586 A:middle
So, we can connect to remote
SVN and remote Git repositories

00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:19.586 A:middle
and we can connect to those
repositories anonymously

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:21.906 A:middle
with username and
password or with public,

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:23.636 A:middle
private SSH key pair
authentication.

00:11:23.886 --> 00:11:25.216 A:middle
And it's really easy
to set that up too.

00:11:25.446 --> 00:11:29.246 A:middle
So, as an example, let me take
you through what it takes to set

00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:31.666 A:middle
up the Xcode Service
in OS X Server.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.416 A:middle
So, when you go the Xcode
Service you see this,

00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.136 A:middle
and this is the Xcode
Service panel

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:40.916 A:middle
and it's split into two parts.

00:11:41.006 --> 00:11:43.226 A:middle
On the left is everything
to do with bots

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.756 A:middle
and configuring your
service and on the right,

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:48.936 A:middle
the second tab is everything
to do with hosted repositories

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:51.816 A:middle
and remote repositories that
your server can connect to.

00:11:52.686 --> 00:11:55.276 A:middle
So, let's say we want to add our
server to our development team,

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:56.246 A:middle
what does it take to do that?

00:11:56.496 --> 00:11:57.546 A:middle
And it's really easy.

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.166 A:middle
So, to do that, we click
the Add button right here

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.166 A:middle
So, to do that, we click
the Add button right here

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:03.496 A:middle
and we'll be asked for
username and password.

00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:07.796 A:middle
And the Server will go wide
to the Apple Developer Program

00:12:07.796 --> 00:12:10.266 A:middle
and figure out which teams
this Apple ID is a member of.

00:12:10.326 --> 00:12:12.846 A:middle
And because I am just a
member of one team right now,

00:12:12.846 --> 00:12:13.986 A:middle
I'm getting this
sheet which says,

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.146 A:middle
"It looks like you're
a member of a team,

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:16.846 A:middle
would you like to join
your server to this team?"

00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:18.946 A:middle
But if you're a member
of multiple teams,

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:21.696 A:middle
let's say you're a contractor
then you'll get a list

00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:22.966 A:middle
of all the teams that
you're a member of

00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:26.036 A:middle
and you can join your server
to one or all of those teams.

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:30.666 A:middle
You can have as many teams as
you like with the OS X Server.

00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:33.346 A:middle
Once you've added your team,
your server will set itself up

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:35.206 A:middle
and you see that this
server is not a member

00:12:35.206 --> 00:12:36.126 A:middle
of that development team.

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:39.876 A:middle
The next step of course
is adding some devices,

00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:41.166 A:middle
and once you plug in devices,

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:43.556 A:middle
devices are able to
be used for bots.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.476 A:middle
So, the server is
recognized here

00:12:45.476 --> 00:12:47.756 A:middle
that this device does not
have a development that's set

00:12:47.756 --> 00:12:49.506 A:middle
and this device is
not actually enabled

00:12:49.506 --> 00:12:50.636 A:middle
for development for my team yet.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.416 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on Use
for Development right here

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:55.766 A:middle
and the server will
quickly and easily add

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:56.676 A:middle
that device to my team.

00:12:56.806 --> 00:13:01.086 A:middle
And as an example, we do
support source control hosting

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.806 --> 00:13:01.086 A:middle
And as an example, we do
support source control hosting

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:03.896 A:middle
like I said and here's
what it takes to set

00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:05.676 A:middle
up some hosting repositories.

00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:07.496 A:middle
So we can either host
it or remote repository

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
and you see some more of this
in our demo in a little second.

00:13:11.316 --> 00:13:14.726 A:middle
So, that is the OS X
Server part of the story

00:13:14.776 --> 00:13:17.896 A:middle
and of course there's the
Xcode 5 part and this is

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:19.396 A:middle
where it gets really
exciting in my opinion.

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:23.386 A:middle
Xcode 5 is an incredible
release.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.766 A:middle
If you have not downloaded Xcode
5 yet, I suggest that you go

00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:28.086 A:middle
and do so immediately,
it's really great.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:31.676 A:middle
And one of the nicest
features I think

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.906 A:middle
in Xcode 5 is the
Testing Edition

00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:35.936 A:middle
and the new Continuous
Integration service.

00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:38.866 A:middle
So, as you go along with the
theme of Continuous Integration

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:40.786 A:middle
in Xcode 5, there are a
couple of things that I'd

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:41.786 A:middle
like to draw your attention to.

00:13:42.076 --> 00:13:45.386 A:middle
Firstly, we have some great
new kind of preferences.

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:48.956 A:middle
So, it's really easy to add
an OS X Server to Xcode 5.

00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:51.746 A:middle
You open the Preferences, type
in the username and password

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:54.176 A:middle
or choose guest if your
server administrator set it

00:13:54.176 --> 00:13:54.726 A:middle
up that way.

00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:59.996 A:middle
And you can quickly add
your server to your Xcode.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.136 --> 00:14:01.686 A:middle
Once you've done that, you're

00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:05.216 A:middle
in a position whereby you
can create bots for project

00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:09.206 A:middle
and workspaces that you
use in Xcode every day.

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:11.856 A:middle
Once you create a bot, the bot
show up in the log navigator

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:13.736 A:middle
and you see our beautiful
reports

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.326 A:middle
for Build and Test history.

00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:18.476 A:middle
And these reports
are not just reports,

00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:21.356 A:middle
these are fully live
interactive reports

00:14:21.356 --> 00:14:23.056 A:middle
that have great assistant
editor support.

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:25.456 A:middle
So, you can select things
on the left in the report

00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:28.566 A:middle
and you'll see the source code
that caused that error issue

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
or test failure right on the
right in the assistant editor.

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:35.666 A:middle
And of course, this affords
you to dig in to your issues,

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.816 A:middle
or errors and you're
wondering to write

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:37.526 A:middle
where they're happening too.

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:39.556 A:middle
So you see things going wrong
in a bot and you can play

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:43.276 A:middle
with the source code and Xcode.

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:46.646 A:middle
We also have great multi-device
support in the Xcode Service

00:14:46.846 --> 00:14:49.116 A:middle
and we have some
really great UI in Xcode

00:14:49.116 --> 00:14:50.376 A:middle
for looking at those results.

00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:53.206 A:middle
You can see your
test results overtime

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.136 A:middle
on across multiple
devices for your bot.

00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:59.616 A:middle
And for each integration
that happens

00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:02.436 A:middle
in the server you'll also see
full commit history for all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:02.436 A:middle
in the server you'll also see
full commit history for all

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:04.736 A:middle
of the commits that were
included in that build.

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:07.866 A:middle
And you'll see all of the log
files that you're familiar

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.586 A:middle
within Xcode today be
produced on the server

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:10.466 A:middle
and sent down to the client.

00:15:12.636 --> 00:15:14.696 A:middle
You have some great
ways to view download --

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:16.096 A:middle
view and download archives

00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:17.856 A:middle
of your project right
from within Xcode.

00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:22.656 A:middle
And we also have some really
nice source control integration

00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:24.456 A:middle
that you'll see in
our demo coming up.

00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:28.666 A:middle
So to do that, I would
like to invite Brent Shank

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:31.196 A:middle
who is a software
engineer on the Xcode team.

00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:34.356 A:middle
To come up here and show us the
Continuous Integration service.

00:15:35.516 --> 00:15:40.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:41.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot, Andrew.

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:44.296 A:middle
Well, I'm really excited
to be up here today,

00:15:44.656 --> 00:15:46.756 A:middle
not just because I had
five espressos this morning

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.076 A:middle
but because I love this stuff.

00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:50.106 A:middle
I love unit test and I loved it

00:15:50.106 --> 00:15:53.056 A:middle
for the first time this
Continuous Integration System

00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:54.556 A:middle
that just works.

00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:57.056 A:middle
I don't know about you but I
spend a lot of time dealing

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.516 A:middle
with some-- the other
systems that are out there.

00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.046 A:middle
And they're great but they
can be hard to set up,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.046 A:middle
And they're great but they
can be hard to set up,

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:04.146 A:middle
they can be hard to maintain,
what we've done is super easy

00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:05.696 A:middle
to set up, it's super powerful.

00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:08.106 A:middle
Let me show you what
it looks like in Xcode.

00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:09.956 A:middle
So, the first thing
we have to do

00:16:09.956 --> 00:16:13.506 A:middle
to get Continuous Integration
working on Xcode is we have

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:16.296 A:middle
to tell Xcode about an OS
X Server that's running the

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:18.116 A:middle
Continuous Integration
service, the Xcode Service.

00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:21.976 A:middle
I do that by adding an
account for an OS X Server.

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.396 A:middle
And as you've heard by
now, we have three types

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:26.416 A:middle
of accounts in Xcode 5.

00:16:26.836 --> 00:16:30.826 A:middle
There's one for your Apple ID
or Apple IDs, there's accounts

00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:32.076 A:middle
for source control repositories,

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.206 A:middle
and of course there are
accounts for OS X Servers.

00:16:34.816 --> 00:16:38.546 A:middle
And I access those through the
new Accounts preference pane.

00:16:39.686 --> 00:16:41.806 A:middle
Okay, well here's our beautiful
new Accounts preference pane,

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:43.286 A:middle
you can see there, no
accounts right now.

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:45.536 A:middle
It's really easy to add any
of those three account types.

00:16:45.946 --> 00:16:47.926 A:middle
I'm going to own account for
an OS X Server right now.

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:49.816 A:middle
I click the Add Server button.

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:53.046 A:middle
And as Andrew said,
any server that's set

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:54.536 A:middle
up on your local
network is going

00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:57.116 A:middle
to be advertised via Bonjour
and you can add it that way.

00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:59.256 A:middle
You can also add a
server by host name or IP,

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
and that's really good
idea if you want to able

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
and that's really good
idea if you want to able

00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:01.946 A:middle
to access it from anywhere.

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.215 A:middle
I'm going to select
this one on the list.

00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:09.106 A:middle
Click Next and authenticate
and here we go.

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:10.915 A:middle
So, I've added an account for
server, it's really easy to do.

00:17:10.915 --> 00:17:12.906 A:middle
You can add as many
servers as you want,

00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:14.076 A:middle
OS X Servers that you want here.

00:17:14.455 --> 00:17:15.986 A:middle
So, what does this
enable me to do?

00:17:16.226 --> 00:17:19.476 A:middle
Well, we have some really tight
integration of source control

00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:21.685 A:middle
with the Xcode Service
and Xcode 5.

00:17:22.455 --> 00:17:24.296 A:middle
And part of where
we surface that is

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:25.776 A:middle
in the new checkout workflow.

00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:28.646 A:middle
That's available in the
Source Control menu.

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:31.276 A:middle
I go there now, and
I'll click Checkout.

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:33.576 A:middle
So, what's in this table here?

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.976 A:middle
Well, this is going to
show me a repository

00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:39.446 A:middle
for every source control
account that I've added

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:40.276 A:middle
in that preference pane.

00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:43.606 A:middle
It's also going to show me
any Hosted Git repository

00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:45.586 A:middle
for an OS X Server that
I have an account for.

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:48.336 A:middle
So as Andrew mentioned, this is
the new feature in OS X Server

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.686 A:middle
that it can Host
Git repositories.

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:52.276 A:middle
And you can see here, these
are all repositories that are

00:17:52.276 --> 00:17:53.366 A:middle
on that server that I added.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:56.256 A:middle
I'm going to select
BubbleGum, click Next,

00:17:57.316 --> 00:17:58.806 A:middle
it's going to authenticate
and checkout.

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:03.186 A:middle
So that's a really great way to
get source code for your team.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:03.186 A:middle
So that's a really great way to
get source code for your team.

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:05.956 A:middle
So, let's see what the state
of this project is like.

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:11.156 A:middle
I'm going to build it, and
build failed because I need

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.076 A:middle
to switch to the simulator.

00:18:12.076 --> 00:18:13.356 A:middle
I'll do that now.

00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:15.906 A:middle
The build succeeded,
this is great,

00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:17.136 A:middle
let's see how the tests look.

00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:21.326 A:middle
I'll run unit tests,
the simulator launches,

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:25.926 A:middle
the test are going to run,
and will they succeed?

00:18:25.926 --> 00:18:26.676 A:middle
They didn't, they failed.

00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:28.126 A:middle
Well, this is good, this
is what I wanted to happen.

00:18:28.946 --> 00:18:30.686 A:middle
Well, how can we use
Continuous Integration

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:32.296 A:middle
to figure out what went wrong?

00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:34.736 A:middle
So I just checked out this
project from source control,

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:35.846 A:middle
I didn't make any changes.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:39.066 A:middle
So, this means someone else
broke this test somehow.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.746 A:middle
So, let's use Continuous
Integration in bots

00:18:43.746 --> 00:18:44.966 A:middle
to figure out what went wrong.

00:18:45.786 --> 00:18:48.206 A:middle
So, we surfaced bots
from the log navigator.

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:50.206 A:middle
And you can see there
a couple of things here

00:18:50.206 --> 00:18:52.926 A:middle
that you haven't seen
before in Xcode; Bubblegum

00:18:52.926 --> 00:18:54.936 A:middle
and Bubblegum Nightly
are both bots.

00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:57.936 A:middle
You can set up as many bots
as you want for projects,

00:18:57.996 --> 00:18:58.786 A:middle
it's really easy to do.

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:02.426 A:middle
I'm going to show you
the bot for Bubblegum.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:02.426 A:middle
I'm going to show you
the bot for Bubblegum.

00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:03.146 A:middle
I'll click on that here.

00:19:04.216 --> 00:19:05.426 A:middle
So, this is the bot report.

00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:09.656 A:middle
You can see it's really
clean, it's really beautiful

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:11.746 A:middle
and provides a lot
of great information.

00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:15.586 A:middle
So, let's go from
top to bottom here.

00:19:15.586 --> 00:19:18.056 A:middle
At the top here, any time you
want to run an integration,

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:18.886 A:middle
you just click Integrate Now.

00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:19.546 A:middle
No problem.

00:19:19.546 --> 00:19:21.546 A:middle
Usually, bots run out of
schedule, you configure them

00:19:21.546 --> 00:19:23.346 A:middle
to run manually,
whatever you want,

00:19:23.346 --> 00:19:25.266 A:middle
whenever you want integration,
just click that button.

00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:28.866 A:middle
This button here, it will
let you download an archive

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:30.536 A:middle
or a product that
your bot created.

00:19:30.966 --> 00:19:32.086 A:middle
And Wi-Fi let you install it

00:19:32.086 --> 00:19:34.436 A:middle
on a device that's connected
locally, that's pretty cool.

00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:37.156 A:middle
And finally, on this menu over
here, you can edit the bot,

00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:39.046 A:middle
delete the bot, do
other things with it.

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:42.196 A:middle
And below that, in the
status counts area,

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:45.366 A:middle
this shows you a high
level status for your bot

00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:47.936 A:middle
for the last integration that
is the last run of your bot.

00:19:48.296 --> 00:19:50.436 A:middle
So if there are any errors or
warnings, you'll see that here.

00:19:50.966 --> 00:19:53.676 A:middle
If you chose settle the bot
from-- on static analysis,

00:19:54.106 --> 00:19:55.316 A:middle
you'll see the status
of that there.

00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:58.256 A:middle
And if the bot is running
tests, you'll see the status

00:19:58.256 --> 00:19:59.116 A:middle
of those unit tests there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.236 --> 00:20:03.836 A:middle
Below that in the build history
chart, you see the status

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:06.246 A:middle
of all the integrations that are
displayed here and we show you

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:07.716 A:middle
as many integrations
as we can show you.

00:20:08.236 --> 00:20:10.146 A:middle
So, what you want to
see here is you want

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:13.006 A:middle
to see there is a no issues
line with the green checkmark.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:15.776 A:middle
That means everything went well.

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.466 A:middle
You build bots and there
were no errors, warnings

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:19.596 A:middle
or static analysis issues.

00:20:20.256 --> 00:20:22.746 A:middle
But if you do have some, that's
okay, that's what this is for,

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.736 A:middle
they'll show up in
this stock bars

00:20:25.366 --> 00:20:28.756 A:middle
and these colors are obvious to
you, warnings on yellow, blue--

00:20:28.756 --> 00:20:31.496 A:middle
static analysis uses-- are in
blue and errors are in red.

00:20:32.016 --> 00:20:34.296 A:middle
And I can click this bar, I can
get a little more information

00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:36.046 A:middle
about what's going on,
and there's even a button

00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:36.556 A:middle
that will take me

00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:38.976 A:middle
to the integration summary
for this integration.

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
Let's keep going down.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.156 A:middle
The chart below here shows me
the status of the unit tests

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.126 A:middle
for all the integrations
that are displayed here

00:20:46.126 --> 00:20:48.816 A:middle
and the goal here is to see
these full high green bars.

00:20:49.176 --> 00:20:50.736 A:middle
That means you had the
unit tests, they run

00:20:50.736 --> 00:20:52.196 A:middle
and they all run successfully.

00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:57.466 A:middle
Below that in the integration
details area, this shows you all

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:59.186 A:middle
of the crucial information
from the logs

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:01.016 A:middle
that were created
when this bot run.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:01.016 A:middle
that were created
when this bot run.

00:21:01.316 --> 00:21:02.446 A:middle
So you made-- the only sub--

00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:05.936 A:middle
logs for the build and you may
have logs for analysis issues

00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
or test failures

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:08.686 A:middle
if you configure your
bot to do those things.

00:21:09.626 --> 00:21:11.186 A:middle
What's really neat
about this view is

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:14.086 A:middle
that it's fully integrated
with all of the navigation

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.176 A:middle
that you used to in Xcode.

00:21:15.596 --> 00:21:17.066 A:middle
So what does that mean?

00:21:17.136 --> 00:21:18.946 A:middle
I'll make my window a
little wider here to--

00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:21.786 A:middle
so you can see that.

00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:24.786 A:middle
So that means when I open the
assistant editor which I do

00:21:25.156 --> 00:21:27.256 A:middle
from the tool bar and this is

00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:29.766 A:middle
where I get a left side
by side editor view.

00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:32.396 A:middle
The left editor essentially
acts as the master editor

00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:35.066 A:middle
when the assistant editor is
in the Reference Files Mode.

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:37.176 A:middle
I can click one of
these failures down here

00:21:37.176 --> 00:21:38.706 A:middle
and Xcode will take me
right to the source code

00:21:38.706 --> 00:21:39.596 A:middle
where this problem occurred.

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:43.306 A:middle
So this is a really fast
and great way to get

00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:44.106 A:middle
to the heart of the problem.

00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:48.376 A:middle
So now we're using bot to
figure out what went wrong.

00:21:48.696 --> 00:21:50.996 A:middle
We see unit tests
here and we can dig

00:21:51.296 --> 00:21:54.906 A:middle
into the bot a little
further to diagnose the issue.

00:21:54.906 --> 00:21:59.236 A:middle
I'm pretty sure Andrew
caused this problem by one

00:21:59.266 --> 00:22:01.666 A:middle
of his classic late night
integration sessions

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.266 --> 00:22:01.666 A:middle
of his classic late night
integration sessions

00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.496 A:middle
where he wasn't as
careful as he usually

00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:04.556 A:middle
as about checking things in.

00:22:04.746 --> 00:22:08.086 A:middle
I can explore that a little bit
more if I click the bar here--

00:22:08.936 --> 00:22:10.496 A:middle
that's never happened before.

00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:14.436 A:middle
This will jump me right
into the Integration Report

00:22:14.946 --> 00:22:17.146 A:middle
and you can see there
are four tabs here.

00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:20.256 A:middle
One of the tabs is the Commits
tab and indeed when I go

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:23.056 A:middle
to that I see the Commit Log
for this particular integration.

00:22:23.446 --> 00:22:25.086 A:middle
And looks like Andrew is
messing with me a little bit

00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:26.806 A:middle
and he deliberately
broke this field.

00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:31.816 A:middle
I'm going to go back and I'm
just going to change this

00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:35.776 A:middle
so I know that there are
actually are five tea-flavored

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:36.856 A:middle
colors of Bubblegum here.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:46.406 A:middle
So I'll just change this and
I'm going to save and I'm going

00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:48.606 A:middle
to check this in so we
can run an integration

00:22:48.606 --> 00:22:49.496 A:middle
and see what that looks like.

00:22:51.836 --> 00:22:56.166 A:middle
Fixing tests, commit.

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:57.436 A:middle
Okay. So while that's running,

00:22:57.666 --> 00:22:59.786 A:middle
let's explore the bot
report a little bit more

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.146 A:middle
and to close this is another.

00:23:02.236 --> 00:23:04.556 A:middle
So there are two tabs, there is
a Summary Tab that's we've been

00:23:04.556 --> 00:23:06.396 A:middle
looking at and there's
the Test Tab

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:09.056 A:middle
and this is a really great view
because it shows you the history

00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:11.476 A:middle
of the unit tests for
all the integrations

00:23:11.566 --> 00:23:12.476 A:middle
that we can display here.

00:23:12.626 --> 00:23:13.816 A:middle
We can display a
lot of integrations.

00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:16.336 A:middle
You saw this this morning,
this is a really great view

00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:19.076 A:middle
because it shows you at a glance
how a particular unit test is

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:21.536 A:middle
doing and you can see most of
mine are doing really well.

00:23:21.796 --> 00:23:24.036 A:middle
I can filter this table to show
me just the ones that failed

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.706 A:middle
and if there's a particular test
that's been giving you trouble

00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:28.926 A:middle
and you know its name, you
might type that in here

00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:30.696 A:middle
and filter the table even more.

00:23:31.246 --> 00:23:33.646 A:middle
Of course, over time, your
server is going to build

00:23:33.986 --> 00:23:35.906 A:middle
up history for thousands
of integrations

00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:39.146 A:middle
and you need an ability to
go back and forth in time

00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:40.126 A:middle
to check these things out.

00:23:40.376 --> 00:23:42.336 A:middle
So you can see how this
interesting trend line here

00:23:42.336 --> 00:23:44.336 A:middle
where I had most of
my unit test breaking

00:23:44.336 --> 00:23:47.176 A:middle
and then they all got better
so I can move the loop

00:23:47.356 --> 00:23:49.856 A:middle
in this graph and I can
slope just the integrations

00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:50.396 A:middle
like here about.

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:53.976 A:middle
And these views also integrated
with the assistant editor

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:58.386 A:middle
so I can bring it up again
and when I select a test case,

00:23:58.386 --> 00:24:01.686 A:middle
it will show me the source code
for that particular test case.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.386 --> 00:24:01.686 A:middle
it will show me the source code
for that particular test case.

00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:03.006 A:middle
I think that's really great.

00:24:03.336 --> 00:24:06.736 A:middle
So let's jump back to the
report for the integration.

00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:08.376 A:middle
I can also see the
latest integrations

00:24:08.376 --> 00:24:09.196 A:middle
in the log navigator.

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:11.656 A:middle
I'm going to click
this one here.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:14.406 A:middle
Let's just explore
this a little more.

00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:17.406 A:middle
The Summary tab is very similar

00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:19.016 A:middle
to the Summary tab
for the bot itself.

00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:20.436 A:middle
It shows you the
high level status.

00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:22.296 A:middle
It shows you the important
integration details.

00:24:22.886 --> 00:24:24.836 A:middle
There's also the Logs tab

00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:26.886 A:middle
and that shows you the
exact same Build logs

00:24:26.886 --> 00:24:27.336 A:middle
that you would see

00:24:27.336 --> 00:24:31.126 A:middle
if you performed this
particular bot run locally,

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:32.516 A:middle
if you perform this
build locally.

00:24:33.046 --> 00:24:33.846 A:middle
So this is really great.

00:24:33.846 --> 00:24:35.436 A:middle
You can have the server
storing these logs

00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:36.846 A:middle
for thousands of integrations.

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:37.976 A:middle
You don't have to
store them locally.

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:40.346 A:middle
Whenever you needed that data
and you want to look at it,

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:41.996 A:middle
Xcode will download it
for you and that's one

00:24:41.996 --> 00:24:44.616 A:middle
of the great benefits of having
a server that's performing your

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:45.496 A:middle
continuous integration.

00:24:45.706 --> 00:24:47.406 A:middle
But let's look at the Test tab.

00:24:47.406 --> 00:24:51.286 A:middle
Starting this is the most
exciting part of this feature.

00:24:51.806 --> 00:24:54.356 A:middle
So what you can see here,
there are four devices listed.

00:24:54.636 --> 00:24:56.206 A:middle
They're actually all
right here connected

00:24:57.026 --> 00:25:01.036 A:middle
and what this means is the Xcode
Service is running unit tests

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.026 --> 00:25:01.036 A:middle
and what this means is the Xcode
Service is running unit tests

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:02.496 A:middle
on all these devices.

00:25:02.796 --> 00:25:03.456 A:middle
Now, think about this.

00:25:03.576 --> 00:25:06.076 A:middle
There's never been a way to
do this automatically before.

00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:09.026 A:middle
There's never been a way
for Xcode to run unit tests

00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:10.606 A:middle
on multiple iOS devices at once.

00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:11.836 A:middle
And this is a huge deal.

00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:14.696 A:middle
If you want to see how your
product performs with iOS 7,

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:16.746 A:middle
for example, whether up
on one of your devices,

00:25:17.066 --> 00:25:19.696 A:middle
plug it into your OS X Server
that's running the continues

00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:21.486 A:middle
integration service
and you'll get

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:22.986 A:middle
to see you get a
high level overview

00:25:23.036 --> 00:25:26.876 A:middle
of how your software is
doing on that new OS.

00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:29.996 A:middle
I think that's very cool for
people who have been writing

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:32.206 A:middle
in the test and have
a lot of time

00:25:32.206 --> 00:25:33.296 A:middle
and energy invested in them.

00:25:33.746 --> 00:25:36.116 A:middle
This is going to immediately
add a lot of value to them.

00:25:36.116 --> 00:25:38.556 A:middle
And for those of you who
haven't been writing in a test,

00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.176 A:middle
I think this is a
great reason to start.

00:25:41.136 --> 00:25:43.456 A:middle
And, again, this
is all connected

00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:46.236 A:middle
with the assistant editor so
you can click Test Case and jump

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:46.766 A:middle
to the source code

00:25:46.766 --> 00:25:47.926 A:middle
and do everything you
would expect to do.

00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:50.686 A:middle
So we've explored
the bot report,

00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:52.496 A:middle
we've explored the bot
integration report,

00:25:53.076 --> 00:25:55.136 A:middle
but what does it like
to create a new bot?

00:25:55.996 --> 00:25:59.356 A:middle
And to do that-- and I
should create a new project.

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:01.636 A:middle
I'll show you what it looks
like from the beginning.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:01.636 A:middle
I'll show you what it looks
like from the beginning.

00:26:02.406 --> 00:26:04.286 A:middle
So, I'll put in an
Xcode project,

00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:07.636 A:middle
I would just create a simple
iOS Utility Application--

00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:10.746 A:middle
I'll just call it Demo App.

00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:17.486 A:middle
So in this Safe panel
here, you probably noticed

00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:19.936 A:middle
for a while an Xcode
4 has offered

00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:22.006 A:middle
to create a local GIT
repository for this project

00:26:22.006 --> 00:26:23.396 A:middle
and that's a really
great thing to do.

00:26:24.196 --> 00:26:26.866 A:middle
But now if you've added an
account for an OS X Server

00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:29.826 A:middle
in the Accounts Prep Pane,
it will list any server here.

00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
And if I choose this server
which I'll do and click Create,

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:35.966 A:middle
let me draw your attention
to the Activity View up here.

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:39.006 A:middle
What's going to happen is
Xcode is going to create

00:26:39.006 --> 00:26:40.206 A:middle
that local GIT repository.

00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:43.336 A:middle
It's going to create the remote
GIT repository and it's going

00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:44.186 A:middle
to push it up to the server.

00:26:44.586 --> 00:26:46.196 A:middle
So now you have the
best of both worlds,

00:26:46.196 --> 00:26:48.266 A:middle
you have a local GIT
repository, your Scratch Pad

00:26:48.266 --> 00:26:50.436 A:middle
and when you're ready to show
those changes into your team,

00:26:50.686 --> 00:26:53.076 A:middle
there's already a server that's
backing up your data for you,

00:26:53.286 --> 00:26:56.456 A:middle
you push those changes up there
and your team has access to it.

00:26:57.646 --> 00:26:59.516 A:middle
This is really great.

00:26:59.716 --> 00:27:02.496 A:middle
Okay. So we created a new
project, let's create a bot.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.716 --> 00:27:02.496 A:middle
Okay. So we created a new
project, let's create a bot.

00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:05.746 A:middle
We do that in a Product Menu,
there's a Create Bot item.

00:27:06.636 --> 00:27:09.296 A:middle
So this is a new project
so there's only one scheme.

00:27:09.806 --> 00:27:12.476 A:middle
You probably have a few schemes
in your project and in order

00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:15.056 A:middle
for the bot to build
your project,

00:27:15.056 --> 00:27:15.876 A:middle
you need to share the scheme.

00:27:15.876 --> 00:27:18.326 A:middle
We can do that automatically
for you but--

00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:20.466 A:middle
and you should keep this check
but I'm going to uncheck it

00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:22.666 A:middle
so I can show you-- I want you
to understand what this means.

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:24.126 A:middle
I'll show you how
to do this manually.

00:27:24.806 --> 00:27:29.006 A:middle
I want this bot to run my unit
tests whenever anyone checks

00:27:29.006 --> 00:27:31.776 A:middle
in codes so we'll call that,
I'm choosing the server here

00:27:32.726 --> 00:27:36.016 A:middle
and I'll uncheck that
particular button there.

00:27:36.616 --> 00:27:37.846 A:middle
Okay. While-- We'll
keep that checks

00:27:37.846 --> 00:27:38.816 A:middle
since it will let me otherwise

00:27:38.816 --> 00:27:40.736 A:middle
but I'll still let you
know, help you out.

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:42.736 A:middle
I want this bot to
run on Commit.

00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.366 A:middle
Again, you have your choice here
when you want your bot to run,

00:27:45.366 --> 00:27:46.666 A:middle
and you can edit this
at any time later.

00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:50.906 A:middle
And as Andrew said, you get to
decide what you want your bot

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
to do so of course your
bot is always going

00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:54.176 A:middle
to build your projects.

00:27:54.176 --> 00:27:56.416 A:middle
So you're always going to know
if there are warnings or errors,

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.386 A:middle
but these three other
things are optional.

00:27:58.676 --> 00:28:01.166 A:middle
You may or may not want your
bot to run static analysis,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.676 --> 00:28:01.166 A:middle
You may or may not want your
bot to run static analysis,

00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:02.926 A:middle
to perform tests or
to build archives.

00:28:03.456 --> 00:28:07.316 A:middle
In this case for this bot, I
just want it to run unit tests

00:28:07.316 --> 00:28:08.486 A:middle
so I'll uncheck these two

00:28:08.866 --> 00:28:10.846 A:middle
and we perform test
action intact there.

00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:14.426 A:middle
I'll click Next, and because
I told that I want to build--

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.846 A:middle
to run unit tests,
it's going to ask me

00:28:15.846 --> 00:28:17.916 A:middle
which iOS devices I
want it to run on.

00:28:18.206 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
I have four here and
I think they should--

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:21.006 A:middle
the test should be
run on all of those

00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:22.526 A:middle
but you can configure
this the way you want.

00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:27.226 A:middle
I'll click Next and, again,
so what happens by default

00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:28.896 A:middle
when the build fails
is anyone who committed

00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:30.976 A:middle
since the last integration
will get an e-mail

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:32.546 A:middle
but you can configure
this however you want.

00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:35.406 A:middle
So it's just a few
clicks and we've created

00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:37.216 A:middle
in a bot for this project.

00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:40.896 A:middle
Yes, the bot scheme
needs to be committed.

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:42.996 A:middle
Exactly. So what
this is all about?

00:28:42.996 --> 00:28:47.006 A:middle
Well, let's go into the manage
scheme sheet here for a second

00:28:47.436 --> 00:28:48.936 A:middle
and you can see this
check box is checked

00:28:49.086 --> 00:28:50.466 A:middle
which is a good thing
in this case.

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:52.846 A:middle
So I need the scheme
to be shared

00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:54.696 A:middle
so that the bot can
build my product

00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:58.006 A:middle
and my default schemes are
not shared so that check box

00:28:58.046 --> 00:29:00.036 A:middle
that I left checked in
the Assistant, that's good

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.046 --> 00:29:00.036 A:middle
that I left checked in
the Assistant, that's good

00:29:00.336 --> 00:29:02.956 A:middle
but if you don't do that, you
can always show your scheme

00:29:03.046 --> 00:29:04.246 A:middle
into the Manage Scheme
sheet here.

00:29:05.136 --> 00:29:08.236 A:middle
I'll click Okay and when I do
that Xcode change to the files

00:29:08.236 --> 00:29:10.036 A:middle
that are involved in the
schemes so I need to commit

00:29:10.036 --> 00:29:13.156 A:middle
and push those up to the
server and you can see here

00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:15.416 A:middle
in the Commit sheet
there's these things related

00:29:15.416 --> 00:29:18.296 A:middle
to the scheme you don't need
to worry about what they are

00:29:18.676 --> 00:29:22.066 A:middle
but you do need to do this in
order for the bot field to run.

00:29:22.766 --> 00:29:25.736 A:middle
So I've committed those
changes and I can force it

00:29:25.736 --> 00:29:29.666 A:middle
to integrate now and you can
see the integration has started.

00:29:30.576 --> 00:29:33.436 A:middle
So really easy to create a
new bot with the rich sourcing

00:29:33.436 --> 00:29:35.476 A:middle
for integration that
we have with these--

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:37.586 A:middle
these two parts of this
system that's why it's easy

00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:39.826 A:middle
to get source control
and get source code

00:29:39.926 --> 00:29:42.386 A:middle
and to push source code
back up to the server.

00:29:43.056 --> 00:29:45.646 A:middle
And I can see here,
you can't see it

00:29:45.716 --> 00:29:46.616 A:middle
but test are already running

00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:48.146 A:middle
on these devices
which is very cool.

00:29:48.756 --> 00:29:50.396 A:middle
So with that, I'm going
to give it back to Andrew

00:29:50.396 --> 00:29:52.436 A:middle
so he can show you
more about the web UI

00:29:52.436 --> 00:29:53.836 A:middle
where we surface
all these things to.

00:29:54.246 --> 00:29:54.586 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:55.516 --> 00:30:01.536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

WEBVTT

00:29:55.516 --> 00:30:01.536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:02.036 --> 00:30:02.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Brent.

00:30:04.516 --> 00:30:06.276 A:middle
Could we switch back
the slides, Brent?

00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:06.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:07.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Please?

00:30:08.896 --> 00:30:10.066 A:middle
You get my demo away.

00:30:11.586 --> 00:30:14.746 A:middle
Okay. So, Brent just showed
you how awesome the Continuous

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.516 A:middle
Integration support
as an Xcode 5.

00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:20.736 A:middle
And just to recap what you
saw, we have a newer kind

00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:22.596 A:middle
of Preferences tab and
the Preferences pane.

00:30:22.776 --> 00:30:25.346 A:middle
So it's really easy to
add and use server kinds

00:30:25.346 --> 00:30:26.386 A:middle
to the Xcode preferences.

00:30:27.006 --> 00:30:30.236 A:middle
You can connect to
servers using username

00:30:30.236 --> 00:30:32.286 A:middle
and password or as a guest.

00:30:33.096 --> 00:30:34.836 A:middle
And once you've done
that, the server shows up.

00:30:34.836 --> 00:30:36.106 A:middle
And once you have a server,

00:30:36.106 --> 00:30:38.006 A:middle
you're now in a position
whereby you can check

00:30:38.006 --> 00:30:40.596 A:middle
out the source code that's
hosted on those servers.

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:42.026 A:middle
Xcode will automatically figure

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.756 A:middle
out what source repositories
exist on the server

00:30:43.756 --> 00:30:44.756 A:middle
and offer to check those out.

00:30:45.866 --> 00:30:48.856 A:middle
So we chose the Bubblegum,
I'm going to check it out.

00:30:48.856 --> 00:30:51.766 A:middle
And by clicking in the
log navigator on the bot,

00:30:51.886 --> 00:30:53.596 A:middle
we could see the
bot summary report.

00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:55.796 A:middle
And here you see all the
beautiful test information

00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:56.486 A:middle
for your bot.

00:30:56.486 --> 00:30:59.126 A:middle
Along the top, you see
so many kinds for errors,

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
issues and warnings
and test results.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
issues and warnings
and test results.

00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:04.766 A:middle
In the center you see summary
grafts for your build history

00:31:04.766 --> 00:31:06.386 A:middle
and your test result history.

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:08.906 A:middle
And at the bottom you see
some integration details

00:31:08.906 --> 00:31:10.756 A:middle
for the most recent integration.

00:31:13.186 --> 00:31:15.576 A:middle
Expanding the side bar you
see each of the integrations

00:31:15.576 --> 00:31:16.716 A:middle
that this bot has performed.

00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:20.546 A:middle
I'm looking at the test results
view, you see a beautiful graph

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:23.596 A:middle
of your test results over time
for all of your integrations.

00:31:24.096 --> 00:31:27.356 A:middle
And of course the best way is

00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:28.716 A:middle
that we support multiple
devices.

00:31:28.716 --> 00:31:30.406 A:middle
So when you click in a
particular integration and look

00:31:30.406 --> 00:31:32.846 A:middle
at the test tab for bot
integration, you'll see all

00:31:32.846 --> 00:31:34.746 A:middle
of the tests split
out by device.

00:31:34.746 --> 00:31:36.066 A:middle
You could see which
tests are passing,

00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:38.296 A:middle
which tests are failing
on which device.

00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:42.086 A:middle
And of course we have the
assistant editor support

00:31:42.086 --> 00:31:42.476 A:middle
as well.

00:31:42.476 --> 00:31:44.586 A:middle
So when you're digging around
in the test result table,

00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:46.546 A:middle
you can see the information

00:31:46.546 --> 00:31:47.886 A:middle
of the assistant
editor on the right.

00:31:49.816 --> 00:31:52.546 A:middle
Finally, Brent showed you what
it takes to set up a new project

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:56.746 A:middle
and host out source
code on an OS X Server.

00:31:56.786 --> 00:32:02.206 A:middle
And with just a few clicks, it
created a rebuild and it was

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.786 --> 00:32:02.206 A:middle
And with just a few clicks, it
created a rebuild and it was

00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:04.346 A:middle
on the server ready for him and
the rest of his team to use.

00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:07.736 A:middle
So the last thing that
I would like to talk

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.806 A:middle
about today is our
web application.

00:32:09.806 --> 00:32:11.386 A:middle
And the web application
is really designed

00:32:11.386 --> 00:32:12.736 A:middle
for everyone who's involved

00:32:12.736 --> 00:32:15.246 A:middle
in the development process
that's not necessarily living

00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:16.506 A:middle
inside Xcode all day.

00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:19.576 A:middle
And I'm sure there are lot
of people that you work

00:32:19.576 --> 00:32:21.206 A:middle
with that fall in
to this category.

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:23.446 A:middle
There are localizers,
there are testers,

00:32:23.516 --> 00:32:25.626 A:middle
there are project
managers if you're lucky

00:32:25.626 --> 00:32:26.696 A:middle
or unlucky to have one.

00:32:27.076 --> 00:32:31.036 A:middle
But the web application
becomes a really useful feature

00:32:31.036 --> 00:32:31.696 A:middle
for those people.

00:32:32.896 --> 00:32:34.986 A:middle
The web application
will give you a view

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.966 A:middle
of your project outside
of Xcode.

00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:40.136 A:middle
So Xcode will only show you bots
that are relevant for projects

00:32:40.136 --> 00:32:42.126 A:middle
and workspaces that you
currently have open.

00:32:42.806 --> 00:32:44.906 A:middle
The server will give you
a server-centric view

00:32:44.906 --> 00:32:45.836 A:middle
of these projects.

00:32:45.836 --> 00:32:49.006 A:middle
So you see a list of all the
bots that live on your server.

00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:55.266 A:middle
And you can easily add and edit
bots right from the web for all

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:57.516 A:middle
of the repositories that your
server already knows how to talk

00:32:57.516 --> 00:32:59.146 A:middle
to so those can be
host of repositories

00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:00.206 A:middle
or remote repositories

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:00.206 A:middle
or remote repositories

00:33:00.206 --> 00:33:03.866 A:middle
that you've already
connected up in server app.

00:33:04.026 --> 00:33:07.046 A:middle
And once you click on a bot, you
see the same beautiful reports

00:33:07.046 --> 00:33:09.636 A:middle
that we have on Xcode.

00:33:09.636 --> 00:33:12.526 A:middle
One feature that's unique to the
web application is the archive C

00:33:12.526 --> 00:33:14.716 A:middle
and admittedly this feature
that we stole from one

00:33:14.716 --> 00:33:15.806 A:middle
of our internal systems.

00:33:15.896 --> 00:33:19.316 A:middle
And this becomes the destination
place for your tester

00:33:19.316 --> 00:33:22.356 A:middle
in the morning to go and get a
list of the most recent products

00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:23.916 A:middle
or archive for your application.

00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:26.736 A:middle
So there's obviously archive
in product downloading.

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.776 A:middle
But we have some really
nice features too.

00:33:29.396 --> 00:33:30.666 A:middle
There's build flagging.

00:33:30.666 --> 00:33:33.776 A:middle
So you can flag a build as being
a great build or flag a build

00:33:33.776 --> 00:33:35.106 A:middle
as being a terrible
build depending

00:33:35.106 --> 00:33:36.586 A:middle
on your definition
of being flagged.

00:33:36.586 --> 00:33:39.516 A:middle
And of course we
support build printing.

00:33:39.516 --> 00:33:41.466 A:middle
So if you know that you
have a build that's sitting

00:33:41.466 --> 00:33:43.406 A:middle
in your list that you maybe
don't want to keep around

00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:45.386 A:middle
or that you know was a
particularly bad build,

00:33:45.436 --> 00:33:47.066 A:middle
you can instantly delete
it just with one click.

00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:52.146 A:middle
And probably my favorite feature
of the web application is

00:33:52.146 --> 00:33:56.396 A:middle
that if you point an iOS device
at the web app with one tap.

00:33:56.396 --> 00:33:58.706 A:middle
You can install a
build application

00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:00.736 A:middle
from the Xcode Service
right in your iOS device.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:00.736 A:middle
from the Xcode Service
right in your iOS device.

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:07.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:08.436 --> 00:34:11.025 A:middle
And then we have another great
feature that we call Scoreboard.

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:14.106 A:middle
And you've all seen it I'm sure
but I'll save that one for demo.

00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:17.246 A:middle
So with that, let's look at the
demo of the new web application

00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:18.485 A:middle
and the Xcode Service.

00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:22.616 A:middle
So here I am in Safari
and to get

00:34:22.616 --> 00:34:24.726 A:middle
to the web application you've
got a number of options.

00:34:25.126 --> 00:34:28.096 A:middle
Inside Xcode when you're looking
at the bot we have a Gear menu

00:34:28.096 --> 00:34:29.896 A:middle
and you can click on the Gear
menu there's a handy link

00:34:29.896 --> 00:34:31.366 A:middle
in there and it takes
you right to the web app.

00:34:32.696 --> 00:34:35.235 A:middle
If you have a host name for
your server and that may be,

00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:37.966 A:middle
you know, a local host name
for your server, you can visit

00:34:37.966 --> 00:34:39.775 A:middle
that hosting and it will take
you right to this web app.

00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:42.126 A:middle
And also if you're in
server app, we have a link

00:34:42.126 --> 00:34:43.436 A:middle
that takes you right
to the web app too.

00:34:43.696 --> 00:34:48.025 A:middle
So this is the bot list
for the web application.

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:50.476 A:middle
And you'll see that we have
an alphanumeric sorted list

00:34:50.476 --> 00:34:51.436 A:middle
of the bots down the left

00:34:52.005 --> 00:34:54.166 A:middle
and you see some great
information for those bots.

00:34:54.966 --> 00:34:57.486 A:middle
We see we have a number of bots
here and a number of states.

00:34:57.546 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
Some bots are succeeding,
some bots are queued ready

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.546 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
Some bots are succeeding,
some bots are queued ready

00:35:00.176 --> 00:35:02.626 A:middle
to be built, some bots
are failing tests,

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:05.356 A:middle
some bots actually have
catastrophic build failures

00:35:05.356 --> 00:35:05.646 A:middle
right now.

00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.896 A:middle
Along the top you see some
summary information for the bots

00:35:08.896 --> 00:35:09.896 A:middle
that are running on your server.

00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:12.456 A:middle
So the most recent bot that
Brent actually just created

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:14.486 A:middle
in run, we could see
it has zero errors,

00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:15.736 A:middle
warnings, or analysis issues.

00:35:16.286 --> 00:35:18.566 A:middle
The Bubblegum Nightly
bot just kicked off

00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:20.216 A:middle
and on the right you can see

00:35:20.216 --> 00:35:22.496 A:middle
that we have handy download
links for the Bubblegum bot too.

00:35:23.776 --> 00:35:26.806 A:middle
So let's click on the
Bubblegum bot and explore

00:35:26.806 --> 00:35:27.936 A:middle
that in a little
bit more detail.

00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
So here you see we
have the same reports

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.676 A:middle
that you see inside of Xcode.

00:35:34.626 --> 00:35:36.436 A:middle
We have five great
tabs along the top,

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:37.906 A:middle
they give you summary
information,

00:35:37.906 --> 00:35:40.196 A:middle
information about your Tests,
information about your Commits,

00:35:40.196 --> 00:35:42.646 A:middle
your Logs and of course the
Archives page which is unique

00:35:42.646 --> 00:35:43.576 A:middle
to the web application.

00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:46.276 A:middle
I can click around and just

00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.546 A:middle
like in Xcode I can see
the full test history

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:50.296 A:middle
for my project right
here on the web browser.

00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:53.736 A:middle
And I can scroll back in
time just like in Xcode

00:35:53.786 --> 00:35:55.956 A:middle
to select any range of
test brought up that I'd

00:35:55.956 --> 00:35:57.046 A:middle
like to explore a
little bit more.

00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
So you can see here
that our project went

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
So you can see here
that our project went

00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:02.386 A:middle
through a particularly
rough patch of having a lot

00:36:02.386 --> 00:36:04.206 A:middle
of failing test and then
we slowly brought that back

00:36:04.206 --> 00:36:05.326 A:middle
in to zero again which is great.

00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:07.206 A:middle
That's exactly what
we wanted to do.

00:36:08.076 --> 00:36:10.676 A:middle
We have the Commits tabs and the
Logs tab which I'll skip over,

00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:12.236 A:middle
and I'll go straight
to the Archives tab

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.096 A:middle
because that's the most
interesting part of this--

00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:15.176 A:middle
part of the web application.

00:36:15.396 --> 00:36:19.746 A:middle
So the Archives tab is a time
sorted list of the products

00:36:19.806 --> 00:36:22.346 A:middle
and the archives for all the
bots that live on your server.

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.206 A:middle
And each bot has its
own Archive's page.

00:36:25.406 --> 00:36:28.456 A:middle
You can see that on the left
we have some great flag icons.

00:36:28.736 --> 00:36:30.936 A:middle
So I know that yesterday's
build was a great build.

00:36:31.226 --> 00:36:33.686 A:middle
We shipped the build for
WWDC of the Bubblegum app

00:36:33.806 --> 00:36:36.026 A:middle
and we know it was good so
I'm going to mark that one

00:36:36.026 --> 00:36:37.776 A:middle
as a flag build,
such a great build.

00:36:39.436 --> 00:36:42.106 A:middle
And also if have
build here that I know

00:36:42.106 --> 00:36:44.286 A:middle
that the day before yesterday
was maybe not a great build.

00:36:44.286 --> 00:36:46.306 A:middle
I can easily click the
trashcan here and just delete

00:36:46.756 --> 00:36:47.656 A:middle
that build with one click.

00:36:50.426 --> 00:36:51.896 A:middle
The other feature that we have

00:36:51.986 --> 00:36:54.236 A:middle
in the web application
is Scoreboard.

00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:57.916 A:middle
And Scoreboard is designed
for the big screen TV

00:36:58.486 --> 00:37:01.546 A:middle
or spare monitor presentation
of all the bots in your server.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.486 --> 00:37:01.546 A:middle
or spare monitor presentation
of all the bots in your server.

00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:04.496 A:middle
So if you have an open
area in your workspace,

00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.766 A:middle
like a coffee area or you have
some space in your development

00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:09.146 A:middle
and this is a perfect candidate
for mounting a display in a wall

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.666 A:middle
and having some fun with bots.

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.026 A:middle
We do this at Apple
and this is great.

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:14.946 A:middle
So there are two ways
to get into Scoreboard.

00:37:15.176 --> 00:37:18.166 A:middle
First, I can click on the
navigation icon right here

00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:19.586 A:middle
and you can see we
have a Scoreboard link.

00:37:19.586 --> 00:37:21.006 A:middle
But we love Scoreboard so much

00:37:21.006 --> 00:37:23.986 A:middle
that we give Scoreboard its
own top level navigation item.

00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:26.976 A:middle
And right here beside the Plus
icon I can click on Scoreboard.

00:37:26.976 --> 00:37:31.436 A:middle
And you can see this takes me
into Scoreboard for this server.

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.106 A:middle
So right now we have
a number of bots

00:37:34.176 --> 00:37:36.316 A:middle
and those bots are
sorted by name.

00:37:37.306 --> 00:37:39.416 A:middle
On the left you see we
have a list of the bots

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:42.076 A:middle
and all their states and on
the right we have a huge card

00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:43.676 A:middle
with some great information
about this bot.

00:37:44.286 --> 00:37:47.246 A:middle
Along the top you see huge kinds
for the errors, issues, warnings

00:37:47.246 --> 00:37:48.626 A:middle
and test succeeds or fails.

00:37:49.596 --> 00:37:51.466 A:middle
You see a list of the
commits that contributed

00:37:51.466 --> 00:37:53.666 A:middle
to that integration and we just
cycle through those commits.

00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:57.136 A:middle
And at the bottom you see the
device information for the tests

00:37:57.276 --> 00:37:58.266 A:middle
that we run for this button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.646 --> 00:38:03.326 A:middle
And as we cycle to the next bot,
you'll see some information.

00:38:03.996 --> 00:38:07.616 A:middle
And it looks like for this
bot, a number of tests were run

00:38:07.616 --> 00:38:09.206 A:middle
and at the bottom we
have a bunch of devices

00:38:09.206 --> 00:38:10.256 A:middle
on which those tests run.

00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:13.426 A:middle
And it seems like Brent kicked
off the Bubblegum bot just

00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:14.336 A:middle
before he left the stage.

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.626 A:middle
And that bot just
succeeded and we can see

00:38:16.626 --> 00:38:19.476 A:middle
that that has one analysis
issue and 27 passing test

00:38:19.476 --> 00:38:21.596 A:middle
across the four devices that
are connected to our server.

00:38:21.776 --> 00:38:22.866 A:middle
This was great.

00:38:24.816 --> 00:38:26.586 A:middle
So let's switch back to slides.

00:38:32.536 --> 00:38:34.156 A:middle
So that's the web application.

00:38:34.156 --> 00:38:36.816 A:middle
The web application is designed
for everyone who is not inside

00:38:36.816 --> 00:38:39.186 A:middle
of Xcode including developers
you may be away from Xcode

00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:40.146 A:middle
at any particular time.

00:38:40.696 --> 00:38:42.846 A:middle
You see the full list of bots
that exist on your server

00:38:43.756 --> 00:38:46.196 A:middle
and you can sort and filter
that list of bots really easily.

00:38:47.336 --> 00:38:49.896 A:middle
You see the same rich reports
that you see inside of Xcode.

00:38:49.896 --> 00:38:53.986 A:middle
And of course you can dig and
drill through test history

00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:54.836 A:middle
for your product just

00:38:54.836 --> 00:38:56.376 A:middle
by scrolling a graft
box three times.

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.046 A:middle
And of course we have
the Archives page.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.046 A:middle
And of course we have
the Archives page.

00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.956 A:middle
And the Archives page is
a great way to ship builds

00:39:01.956 --> 00:39:02.846 A:middle
to the rest of your team.

00:39:02.846 --> 00:39:04.906 A:middle
Or to have one place the
people and your team can go

00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:07.266 A:middle
to every morning to download the
latest build of your project.

00:39:07.266 --> 00:39:09.816 A:middle
And, so these builds
can be flagged

00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:11.256 A:middle
or deleted at your choosing.

00:39:11.366 --> 00:39:14.516 A:middle
And of course we have
the Scoreboard feature.

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:15.506 A:middle
And Scoreboard is great.

00:39:15.626 --> 00:39:17.286 A:middle
I would encourage you all
to set up a spare display

00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:19.596 A:middle
in your development room or if
you like, Brent and his bedroom.

00:39:19.596 --> 00:39:23.186 A:middle
And, you know, have
some fun with bot

00:39:23.216 --> 00:39:24.036 A:middle
so that makes it really fun.

00:39:25.936 --> 00:39:28.416 A:middle
So I did have some best
practices that I'd like to pass

00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:31.706 A:middle
on based on our internal
usage of the Xcode Service

00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:33.566 A:middle
with our small and
large development teams.

00:39:35.696 --> 00:39:37.366 A:middle
The first is that
if you're sitting

00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:40.146 A:middle
in the audience here thinking
yeah you know, this is well

00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:42.416 A:middle
and good, this works great for,
you know, the small iOS app

00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.996 A:middle
or the small mac or the apps
that are showing on stage

00:39:44.996 --> 00:39:46.446 A:middle
or any app apart from my app,

00:39:47.136 --> 00:39:49.366 A:middle
maybe your source code
is structured in a weird

00:39:49.366 --> 00:39:52.426 A:middle
and wacky way where you have to
check out multiple nested copies

00:39:52.426 --> 00:39:56.286 A:middle
of source code or you have
multiple cross reference Xcode

00:39:56.286 --> 00:39:58.836 A:middle
project files or you know,
something pretty normal,

00:39:59.336 --> 00:40:00.916 A:middle
then you'll be glad to hear

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.336 --> 00:40:00.916 A:middle
then you'll be glad to hear

00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:03.186 A:middle
that the Xcode Service
actually supports bots

00:40:03.256 --> 00:40:04.896 A:middle
that are configured
against multiple source

00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:05.796 A:middle
control repositories.

00:40:06.396 --> 00:40:08.856 A:middle
And the answer that I would have
for you for that questions is

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.996 A:middle
to structure your code in
workspaces and if you think

00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:14.536 A:middle
about this, this is the best way
that the server is going to be

00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:16.896 A:middle
in a position where it can
reassemble your source code

00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:19.416 A:middle
in a way that we can
build it the same way

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.786 A:middle
that you build the
source code locally.

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:25.516 A:middle
The second is more of a security
best practice and that is

00:40:25.516 --> 00:40:27.356 A:middle
if you are connecting
your OS X Server

00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:31.216 A:middle
to existing remote repositories
with SVN or Git repositories,

00:40:31.836 --> 00:40:33.636 A:middle
I would strongly encourage
you to use role accounts

00:40:33.636 --> 00:40:34.416 A:middle
for those repositories.

00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:35.736 A:middle
That's just generally
a good practice.

00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:38.896 A:middle
You don't necessarily want to be
entering your personal username

00:40:38.896 --> 00:40:41.716 A:middle
and password onto the server and
having the server check out code

00:40:41.716 --> 00:40:43.966 A:middle
as you that's why role
accounts were invented,

00:40:43.966 --> 00:40:45.226 A:middle
they're really good
for that purpose.

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.276 A:middle
And also I would
also encourage you

00:40:47.276 --> 00:40:49.876 A:middle
to use SSH public/private
key pair authentication

00:40:49.876 --> 00:40:51.956 A:middle
and the OS X Server that
makes it really easy

00:40:52.406 --> 00:40:54.936 A:middle
to generate new public/private
key pairs and with one click,

00:40:54.936 --> 00:40:56.936 A:middle
copy the public key right to
your clipboard so you can paste

00:40:56.936 --> 00:40:58.686 A:middle
into websites like
GitHub in just a second.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:02.276 A:middle
The third best practice

00:41:02.276 --> 00:41:04.406 A:middle
that I have is actually
just some suggested bots.

00:41:04.406 --> 00:41:06.136 A:middle
These are bots that
we set up that we find

00:41:06.186 --> 00:41:07.196 A:middle
to be really, really useful.

00:41:09.556 --> 00:41:12.136 A:middle
So the first of those
is a non-commit bot

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.356 A:middle
and this one is fairly obvious
one but if you think about it,

00:41:14.356 --> 00:41:16.316 A:middle
you will have the
supply in sitting

00:41:16.316 --> 00:41:19.286 A:middle
in your office that's doing
building, that's doing testing,

00:41:19.606 --> 00:41:21.726 A:middle
that's running static
analysis for your code base

00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:24.496 A:middle
and running your tests for every
source control change that's

00:41:24.496 --> 00:41:26.176 A:middle
made and that's a
really awesome feature.

00:41:26.956 --> 00:41:29.266 A:middle
And if you have a
slightly larger project,

00:41:29.566 --> 00:41:31.266 A:middle
you can adapt this
concept and say you would

00:41:31.266 --> 00:41:34.236 A:middle
like to have a bot that's
doing this work every hour

00:41:34.276 --> 00:41:36.406 A:middle
or once a day, that's a
really good thing to have.

00:41:37.976 --> 00:41:41.076 A:middle
The second is a Nightly
bot, Nightly bots are great.

00:41:41.296 --> 00:41:44.996 A:middle
Nightly bots can build and
archive your project just

00:41:44.996 --> 00:41:48.166 A:middle
in the same way you do locally
and it will produce a signed Mac

00:41:48.366 --> 00:41:51.356 A:middle
or a signed iOS Application
that your testers can come

00:41:51.356 --> 00:41:54.026 A:middle
in the morning and click
in one link on the web app

00:41:54.026 --> 00:41:56.186 A:middle
and download a build
ready to be tested.

00:41:56.366 --> 00:41:57.006 A:middle
So this is great.

00:41:57.536 --> 00:42:01.796 A:middle
And the third is if you are like
my team, we recently switched

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.536 --> 00:42:01.796 A:middle
And the third is if you are like
my team, we recently switched

00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:03.666 A:middle
to Git and we're a little
branch happy right now

00:42:03.766 --> 00:42:05.026 A:middle
so we branch for everything.

00:42:05.506 --> 00:42:08.806 A:middle
And if you branch a lot then
bots are a perfect candidate

00:42:08.806 --> 00:42:09.356 A:middle
for branching.

00:42:09.796 --> 00:42:12.646 A:middle
They're so light weight and
it's a great way to continue

00:42:12.646 --> 00:42:13.536 A:middle
to reap the benefits

00:42:13.536 --> 00:42:15.256 A:middle
of Continuous Integration
while you're using a

00:42:15.256 --> 00:42:16.186 A:middle
branching workflow.

00:42:16.696 --> 00:42:18.346 A:middle
So when you cut yourself
a branch for a feature,

00:42:18.486 --> 00:42:20.566 A:middle
create yourself a bunch of
bots and you're ready to go.

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:27.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:28.436 --> 00:42:31.406 A:middle
So the next question is, how
do you get these features?

00:42:31.406 --> 00:42:33.596 A:middle
And I'm guessing a lot
of you have already gone

00:42:33.596 --> 00:42:35.756 A:middle
and figured this out but let's
go through it just in case.

00:42:36.436 --> 00:42:39.486 A:middle
So the best way is to go to
developer.apple.com today

00:42:39.486 --> 00:42:41.036 A:middle
and you're going to
need three things.

00:42:42.136 --> 00:42:45.306 A:middle
The first thing is you
will need the preview list

00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:47.196 A:middle
of OS X Mavericks.

00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:50.556 A:middle
After that, you'll need the
preview the list of OS X Server

00:42:50.556 --> 00:42:52.946 A:middle
and OS X Server requires
some of the technologies

00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:55.536 A:middle
that shipping is part of
OS X Mavericks so you need

00:42:55.536 --> 00:42:57.176 A:middle
to be running server
on a Mavericks machine.

00:42:58.746 --> 00:43:01.616 A:middle
And after that, you need to
get yourself a copy of Xcode 5

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.746 --> 00:43:01.616 A:middle
And after that, you need to
get yourself a copy of Xcode 5

00:43:01.616 --> 00:43:05.356 A:middle
and Xcode 5 will run happily
on Mountain Lion and Mavericks

00:43:05.406 --> 00:43:07.826 A:middle
and Xcode 5 will also run
happily on the same machine

00:43:08.046 --> 00:43:09.616 A:middle
or a separate machine from
the server if you want

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:11.376 A:middle
to run a bot server locally,
that's perfectly fine.

00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:17.426 A:middle
After that, you can join
your existing ADC teams today

00:43:17.426 --> 00:43:20.376 A:middle
if you're a team agent or
team admin with no changes.

00:43:20.406 --> 00:43:21.976 A:middle
Just enter your Apple
ID and password,

00:43:21.976 --> 00:43:24.096 A:middle
your server will join your team
and everything is set to go.

00:43:24.096 --> 00:43:28.156 A:middle
And, of course, once
you've done that,

00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:30.156 A:middle
your server will obtain
signing certificates,

00:43:30.196 --> 00:43:31.986 A:middle
special signing certificates
for the server.

00:43:31.986 --> 00:43:34.406 A:middle
Your server will obtain
provisioning profiles

00:43:34.406 --> 00:43:36.646 A:middle
for all the devices that have
been registered for your team

00:43:36.646 --> 00:43:38.646 A:middle
and you can just plug the
devices that you already have

00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:41.036 A:middle
into your server and everything
will be ready and just work.

00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:44.156 A:middle
So you can quickly build iOS
projects just by plugging

00:43:44.156 --> 00:43:45.536 A:middle
in devices and entering
your Apple ID.

00:43:48.656 --> 00:43:49.946 A:middle
So, in summary, I hope--

00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:52.876 A:middle
today you've seen that the
Xcode Service and OS X Server

00:43:52.876 --> 00:43:56.546 A:middle
and Xcode 5 is really designed
to help you build better apps.

00:43:56.946 --> 00:44:00.036 A:middle
It's super simple to set up and
once you've set up these bots,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:56.946 --> 00:44:00.036 A:middle
It's super simple to set up and
once you've set up these bots,

00:44:00.686 --> 00:44:04.336 A:middle
you can build and you can
catch build issues, errors,

00:44:04.656 --> 00:44:07.206 A:middle
run static analysis regularly
and importantly run your tests

00:44:07.206 --> 00:44:09.906 A:middle
and run your tests on simulators
on the Mac or run your test

00:44:09.906 --> 00:44:12.326 A:middle
in single or multiple threaded
devices to your server.

00:44:13.116 --> 00:44:15.496 A:middle
And the value of a server
is really keeping history

00:44:15.496 --> 00:44:16.396 A:middle
around for your project.

00:44:16.396 --> 00:44:18.356 A:middle
This is not something that
you can feasibly do locally

00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:19.966 A:middle
when you're running
Xcode, so being able

00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:22.256 A:middle
to keep all the build logs,
all the build products

00:44:22.476 --> 00:44:24.136 A:middle
and all the results
for your builds back

00:44:24.136 --> 00:44:25.936 A:middle
through time is a really
great asset for your team.

00:44:27.406 --> 00:44:29.746 A:middle
You'll be easily able to
distribute builds to your team

00:44:29.746 --> 00:44:32.406 A:middle
and the integration
with Xcode is amazing.

00:44:32.406 --> 00:44:35.136 A:middle
You'll have fully deep
integration in the IDE

00:44:35.136 --> 00:44:37.416 A:middle
with the Xcode Service
and of course

00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:39.186 A:middle
for everyone who's
not living in Xcode,

00:44:39.186 --> 00:44:41.376 A:middle
there's the web application and
of course there's Scoreboard

00:44:41.376 --> 00:44:43.526 A:middle
for the big screen television
presentation of the stuff.

00:44:46.026 --> 00:44:47.906 A:middle
So there are a couple
of related sessions

00:44:47.906 --> 00:44:50.536 A:middle
that I would highly encourage
you guys to go along and attend.

00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:53.376 A:middle
So later in the week we have
a dedicated testing session

00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:54.366 A:middle
for Xcode 5.

00:44:54.826 --> 00:44:55.596 A:middle
We'll be looking at some

00:44:55.596 --> 00:44:57.816 A:middle
of the really great new
testing features including some

00:44:57.816 --> 00:44:59.646 A:middle
of the integration with bots

00:44:59.976 --> 00:45:02.406 A:middle
and also there's a dedicated
source control session later

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.976 --> 00:45:02.406 A:middle
and also there's a dedicated
source control session later

00:45:02.406 --> 00:45:03.006 A:middle
in the week too.

00:45:03.286 --> 00:45:06.776 A:middle
So with that, I would like to
thank you for you afternoon

00:45:06.936 --> 00:45:08.176 A:middle
and I hope you have a good week.

00:45:09.516 --> 00:45:13.516 A:middle
