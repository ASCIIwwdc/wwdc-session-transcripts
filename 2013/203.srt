00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:11.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:14.026 A:middle
Welcome to this morning's
session

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:15.366 A:middle
for what's new in Cocoa Touch.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.286 A:middle
If you were here for the
Building User Interfaces

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:21.376 A:middle
for iOS 7 talk with Jason
Beaver and Andy Matuschak,

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:23.326 A:middle
they had a lot of
really pretty pictures.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.546 A:middle
They went into some
fantastic detail

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:29.126 A:middle
about the design
aspects of iOS 7.

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:32.726 A:middle
And I'm going to spend a lot
of time on the actual API

00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:34.966 A:middle
that you're going to be using
in order to implement a lot

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.076 A:middle
of the stuff that
they talked about.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:37.936 A:middle
So if you weren't able
to get into the room,

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:41.786 A:middle
if you're listening to this
on the tape, you probably want

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.786 A:middle
to go back and watch
that talk on video first

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:45.046 A:middle
and then start in here.

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:48.096 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:51.416 A:middle
One of the things that
you'll notice, of course,

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.786 A:middle
is that stuff used
to look like this.

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.436 A:middle
This wouldn't be a
presentation of mine

00:00:56.436 --> 00:00:57.546 A:middle
without a picture of my dog.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.846 A:middle
But now, it has a little
bit different look.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.846 A:middle
But now, it has a little
bit different look.

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:05.476 A:middle
And again, they spent a lot of
time talking about how this--

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.826 A:middle
you know, the reasons behind
this and how this works

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:10.906 A:middle
in the previous talk, so please
make sure you go see that.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:12.846 A:middle
I'm going to spend,
again, a lot more time

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.516 A:middle
on the really low
level details here.

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:18.096 A:middle
So first, we'd like to talk
about adaptive multitasking.

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:21.586 A:middle
So in iOS 6, if you
were a multitasking app,

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:24.246 A:middle
you fell into one of
the void categories

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:26.276 A:middle
or the audio categories
and things like that.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.026 A:middle
So we're adding new
mechanisms for you to be able

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:32.346 A:middle
to keep your content fresh and
to be able to keep the illusion

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:35.806 A:middle
as if your application is
running all the time in iOS 7.

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:38.506 A:middle
And that involves three new
things, background fetching,

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:41.806 A:middle
remote notifications,
and background transfers.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:43.806 A:middle
So for background fetching,

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.566 A:middle
what you'll do is you'll
add this new fetch category

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:51.846 A:middle
to your background mode in
your application's Info.plist.

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:53.996 A:middle
At that point, your
application will be

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:55.246 A:middle
launched opportunistically.

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:58.076 A:middle
So what we're doing here is
watching the user's patterns

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.196 A:middle
for how they use
your application.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.196 A:middle
for how they use
your application.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:02.746 A:middle
And if we notice that, for
instance, they're firing

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:07.966 A:middle
that application up every day
at 7:55, we might fire you up at

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:12.936 A:middle
about 7:50 and say, "OK, go
ahead and do this fetch,"

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:16.076 A:middle
you'll get a new delegate
method on UIApplication,

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
application performFetchWith
CompletionHandler.

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:24.076 A:middle
And the idea here is you'll get
called back at this point, say,

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.766 A:middle
we fired you up, you go off
and do your network traffic.

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:29.246 A:middle
And then at the end of that,

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:32.306 A:middle
you're handed a completion
handler that you have to call.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.506 A:middle
That's how you tell us when
you're done with your transfer.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:40.226 A:middle
The background fetching
interval is controlled

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.406 A:middle
by this method on UIApplication.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:45.156 A:middle
It's setMinimumBackground
FetchInterval.

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.876 A:middle
You can use one of these two
constants, UIBackground--

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:50.856 A:middle
UIApplicationBackground
FetchIntervalMinimum

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:56.066 A:middle
which is the slowest callback
interval that you can give us.

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:59.476 A:middle
ApplicationBackground
FetchIntervalNever is please

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
don't call me at all.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
don't call me at all.

00:03:00.606 --> 00:03:03.346 A:middle
You'll have to call
this method at launch.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.036 A:middle
Make sure that you get set

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.896 A:middle
or you can turn yourself
off during your run.

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.826 A:middle
And your own values above
minimum will work as well.

00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:15.856 A:middle
So, for the remote notifications
mechanism, if you're using--

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.286 A:middle
if your app uses a server
and the server knows

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:21.106 A:middle
that it has new information
for one of your applications,

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:24.386 A:middle
you'll be able to get a push
notification from the server

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:25.616 A:middle
and you'll get called back

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.206 A:middle
on this delegate
method application

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:30.976 A:middle
didReceiveRemoteNotification
FetchCompletionHandler.

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:34.086 A:middle
And you'll also add that remote
notification background mode

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:35.526 A:middle
to your Info.plist.

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:39.836 A:middle
The handler here is, again,
your opportunity to go out

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.946 A:middle
and do a bunch of work 'cause
the userInfo dictionary is the

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:44.806 A:middle
push notification userInfo
dictionary you've been

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:45.626 A:middle
getting before.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:47.866 A:middle
And again, when you go
out and complete that,

00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.106 A:middle
you'll call the completion
handler

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:51.786 A:middle
with a UIBackgroundFetchResult.

00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:55.066 A:middle
And you don't have a lot of time
to be able to do these things.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.526 A:middle
You've got a certain
fixed amount of time.

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.806 A:middle
If you don't call that
completion handler in time,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.196 A:middle
we may not actually fire
you up the next time

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:05.976 A:middle
for either an opportunistic
fetch or for a remote fetch.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:07.686 A:middle
So you need to make sure that
you're getting your work done

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.546 A:middle
in a very short amount of time.

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:11.776 A:middle
The UIBackgroundFetchResult,

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.706 A:middle
this is the completion
handler signature.

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.136 A:middle
When you call the completion
handler, you're going to pass

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:19.136 A:middle
in one of these three
values, ResultNewData,

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:21.196 A:middle
ResultNoData, or ResultFailed.

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.436 A:middle
And this is how you tell
us exactly what happened

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
so that we know "Well,
if the result failed,

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.426 A:middle
maybe we'll call you back
again in a few minutes

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:28.586 A:middle
and maybe it will succeed then."

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:32.366 A:middle
Or if you had no data, then we
know that "Well, maybe every day

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.266 A:middle
at 7:50, there isn't any data

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:35.796 A:middle
and we don't actually
need to fire you up."

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.416 A:middle
All right, so that gives
us some ability to be able

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:42.076 A:middle
to tune the behavior of the
system to your user's behavior

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:43.696 A:middle
and your app's behavior as well.

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:49.746 A:middle
So the new multitasking
also has new Foundation API

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:51.126 A:middle
and NSURLSession.

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.476 A:middle
So this is really a replacement
system for NSURLConnection.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.176 A:middle
It handles data, upload
and download tasks.

00:04:57.556 --> 00:04:59.886 A:middle
Sessions have identifiers,
so you can actually restore

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:03.796 A:middle
from an identifier much the
same way you can create things

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:04.726 A:middle
from state restoration.

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:07.346 A:middle
There's a new delegate on
UIApplication that gets called.

00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:08.636 A:middle
So if we know that
you've got one

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:10.926 A:middle
of this background transfers
going, you may have to fire

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:11.966 A:middle
up in order to handle things

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
like authentication
or transfer of data.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.876 A:middle
So application handleEventsFor
BackgroundURLSessio:

00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:22.016 A:middle
completionHandler gets called.

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:23.276 A:middle
You get the session identifier.

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:25.226 A:middle
We instate the session
identifier--

00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:26.936 A:middle
the URLSession from
the identifier

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.356 A:middle
and then do your behaviors.

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:29.856 A:middle
So-- and again, here
you're going

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:30.986 A:middle
to call the completion handler

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:33.026 A:middle
when you're done
handling the callbacks.

00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:34.156 A:middle
And this completion
handler just is--

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:36.276 A:middle
is a void void, so you can
just call it immediately.

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:39.706 A:middle
There is a talk on What's
New in Foundation Networking

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
in the Mission, Wednesday
at 9:00.

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:44.856 A:middle
If you're doing any this
kind of downloading or work

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:47.856 A:middle
with connections or sessions,
you're definitely going

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:50.756 A:middle
to want to go see that talk.

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:57.436 A:middle
So, you saw in the previous
talk about all the changes

00:05:57.436 --> 00:05:59.436 A:middle
that we've made for rendering
and things like that,

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:01.966 A:middle
so let's talk about views
and images a little bit.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:01.966 A:middle
so let's talk about views
and images a little bit.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:09.796 A:middle
We have some new image
rendering modes in UIKit to deal

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:13.626 A:middle
with the way that you might
actually display an image.

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:18.206 A:middle
So, if you are working with
template images before,

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.996 A:middle
you are probably going
out to UIImage imageNamed,

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:25.056 A:middle
pulling an image off of disk,
calling rendering context

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:26.646 A:middle
with a bunch of color
and stuff like that

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:28.196 A:middle
and then slamming that color in.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:29.806 A:middle
So you actually do a
bunch of work to be able

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.416 A:middle
to colorize a template of image.

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:33.426 A:middle
This actually takes
care that for you.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.276 A:middle
So once you have an image
in hand, you're going

00:06:35.276 --> 00:06:37.516 A:middle
to call UIImage
imageWithRenderingMode.

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:40.346 A:middle
And that rendering
mode has three options.

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
Automatic means that
we will do something

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:44.776 A:middle
with this image in
a given context.

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.036 A:middle
I'll talk about that
in a second.

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:51.686 A:middle
ImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal
means always use the pixels

00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:53.186 A:middle
as they came off of disks.

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:55.976 A:middle
So if you've got a non-template
image and you want to make sure

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:57.976 A:middle
that it doesn't get
changed when it's put

00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.606 A:middle
into a different context,
you'll be able to use this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.606 A:middle
into a different context,
you'll be able to use this.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.476 A:middle
Template means go
ahead and colorize it

00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:08.666 A:middle
or apply the template the way
that the context defines it.

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:09.796 A:middle
So what's the context?

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.406 A:middle
The context is defined
by a new UIView property

00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:14.666 A:middle
called tintColor.

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:17.476 A:middle
So, Andy talked about the fact

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:19.266 A:middle
that we've taken the
tintColor concept

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:22.616 A:middle
and hoisted it all the
way up to UIView, right.

00:07:23.106 --> 00:07:25.866 A:middle
So UIView now has this
top level tintColor idea.

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:27.556 A:middle
It's hierarchical.

00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.036 A:middle
You can set it on your window

00:07:30.146 --> 00:07:31.506 A:middle
which will push the
tintColor all the way

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:33.886 A:middle
through your application
and things like controls

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.016 A:middle
and images will respond to that.

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:40.536 A:middle
And you can also pull from that.

00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:43.016 A:middle
So, if somebody set
it on a higher view

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:45.696 A:middle
in your view hierarchy and then
you go down to a much lower view

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:48.446 A:middle
and call tintColor, you'll
find out what the tintColor is.

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:51.266 A:middle
You can render in context with
that tintColor if you like

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:53.826 A:middle
or just find-- you know, use
it for your own purposes.

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:55.856 A:middle
What does this look like?

00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:58.986 A:middle
So, the default tintColor
is this blue that you use.

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:02.826 A:middle
What I've got here is
a top level UIView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:02.826 A:middle
What I've got here is
a top level UIView.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:05.796 A:middle
There's a UIImage view there
which has the little chevron

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.566 A:middle
and that's a UI button
that says "Onward."

00:08:09.226 --> 00:08:12.776 A:middle
And if you call, for
instance, set tintColor red,

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.746 A:middle
the only thing I've done here
is that image has the previous

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.676 A:middle
on image rendering
mode set to template.

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:22.016 A:middle
So if I call set tintColor
red, everything that's

00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:24.456 A:middle
in that view hierarchy
inherits that tintColor.

00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:27.276 A:middle
So you don't have to do any of
the rendering context anymore

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:29.426 A:middle
and all of our controls
will take care of this.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.396 A:middle
This is a really good way
to be able to apply, say,

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:33.836 A:middle
a theme color or a signature
color to your application.

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:37.616 A:middle
We also have this thing
called the TintAdjustmentMode.

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:41.135 A:middle
And when we present
popovers on the pad

00:08:41.135 --> 00:08:44.816 A:middle
or when present alert
sheets on the phone,

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.336 A:middle
when we cover the content,

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:48.186 A:middle
we're going to put a
dimming view over that.

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:49.456 A:middle
And one of the things
that we'd like to be able

00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:51.206 A:middle
to do is indicate that things

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:53.956 A:middle
with a signature tintColor
are no longer inter-actable.

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:57.036 A:middle
And so, the TintAdjustmentMode
allows us to say, "OK,

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:01.336 A:middle
this is a gray automatically
desaturation.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:01.336 A:middle
this is a gray automatically
desaturation.

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:02.996 A:middle
If you don't want that behavior,

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.836 A:middle
you can change the
TintAdjustmentMode

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.926 A:middle
so that it doesn't
desaturate, OK."

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.076 A:middle
So this is what it looks
like with it's desaturated.

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.416 A:middle
You can tweak that if you
do actually want that--

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
those elements to
not get changed.

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:17.066 A:middle
When you find out about
changes to the tintColor,

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:18.796 A:middle
frequently this kind

00:09:18.796 --> 00:09:21.226 A:middle
of tintColor changes don't
require layout changes.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:22.466 A:middle
You don't have to
go back through

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:23.776 A:middle
and re-layout all your views.

00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:25.696 A:middle
You just need to change
the colors, right.

00:09:26.056 --> 00:09:28.706 A:middle
If you implement
tintColorDidChange

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:32.286 A:middle
on your UIView subclass,
you'll get called and told

00:09:32.286 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
when either somebody changes the
tintColor up at the top level

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:36.416 A:middle
or the view hierarchy
which you inherit,

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:40.136 A:middle
or when somebody calls
set tintColor explicitly,

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:41.806 A:middle
or when any of these
TintAdjustmentMode

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:43.106 A:middle
changes occur.

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:46.896 A:middle
So that's your opportunity to do
things like call the tintColor

00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:49.756 A:middle
from high in the hierarchy,
do a rendering context,

00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:52.146 A:middle
and get the look with your
tintColor that you want.

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:55.766 A:middle
So View Animations can
be a little tricky.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:56.936 A:middle
And we've introduced
a new method

00:09:57.606 --> 00:09:59.086 A:middle
called performWithoutAnimation.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:01.616 A:middle
And by introduce, I
mean, we discovered

00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:02.626 A:middle
that we were needing this a lot

00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:04.766 A:middle
and we probably figured you
guys needed it a lot too.

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.326 A:middle
It's very easy to get
caught up in either some

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:12.656 A:middle
of UIKit's default animation
block or some animation block

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:13.846 A:middle
that you've created elsewhere.

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:16.666 A:middle
And you can even do some layout
changes or some behaviors

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:20.946 A:middle
that really require fixed layout
that goes into a view hierarchy

00:10:20.946 --> 00:10:22.606 A:middle
so that it doesn't get
accidentally animated

00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:23.376 A:middle
if these things happen.

00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:25.996 A:middle
So you can call
UIViewperformWithoutAnimation.

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:26.986 A:middle
This is a class method.

00:10:27.846 --> 00:10:30.856 A:middle
And anything you put in that
block will happen instantly

00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:33.406 A:middle
so it won't get animated when
it gets into a view hierarchy

00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:33.966 A:middle
or anything like that.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.266 A:middle
So this avoids a little effects
where you created something,

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:39.376 A:middle
for instance, with CGRectZero
and then suddenly it expands

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:41.496 A:middle
out during an implicit
animation block.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.886 A:middle
The other thing that we've
done is we've also added new

00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:48.766 A:middle
UIViewAnimation level
KeyframeAnimation API.

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:52.186 A:middle
So you don't have to drop down
the CAKEyframeAnimation anymore.

00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:55.456 A:middle
You can use
animateKeyframesWithDuration

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.666 A:middle
delay options animations
completion.

00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:58.946 A:middle
So this looks very similar

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:01.156 A:middle
to the UIViewAnimation
API you already have.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:01.156 A:middle
to the UIViewAnimation
API you already have.

00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:03.926 A:middle
Once you've got that
you can also put

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:06.056 A:middle
in
addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime

00:11:06.056 --> 00:11:07.726 A:middle
relativeDuration animations.

00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:08.836 A:middle
And you can compose this

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.816 A:middle
with the UIViewAnimation
blocks as well.

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
So what's you're getting here
is the ability to do things

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:15.926 A:middle
like start animations
consistently at relative times,

00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:18.936 A:middle
have those animations
run a proportional value

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:20.296 A:middle
of the containing animation.

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:23.006 A:middle
And there are a ton
of options for this.

00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:24.026 A:middle
Some of them are familiar

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:27.136 A:middle
if you've been using the UIView
Animation mechanism before.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.956 A:middle
So UIViewKeyframeAnimation
options, layoutSubviews,

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:33.196 A:middle
AllowUserInteraction,
all of those are the same

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:36.166 A:middle
as the UIViewAnimation
API you're already using.

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:39.586 A:middle
There are few, OK.

00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:42.946 A:middle
And there are new timing methods

00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:47.226 A:middle
for calculating how those
relative values will run

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:48.096 A:middle
through the animation.

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:51.206 A:middle
So this should be a
really easy way to be able

00:11:51.206 --> 00:11:54.696 A:middle
to do the really subtle, really
timed animations that you'd had

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:57.296 A:middle
to dropdown to KeyframeAnimation
for.

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.676 A:middle
So, you can stay up at
the UIView level here now.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:01.776 A:middle
Andy talked a little bit

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:03.896 A:middle
about motion effects
in the previous talk.

00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:05.926 A:middle
Motion effects are the
things where when you pick

00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:08.736 A:middle
up the device and
you start moving it,

00:12:09.466 --> 00:12:12.176 A:middle
that you get those effects
like things are floating above

00:12:12.176 --> 00:12:16.306 A:middle
or below various
aspects of the interface.

00:12:17.016 --> 00:12:20.186 A:middle
Motion effects apply relative
values to key paths of a view.

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:23.056 A:middle
So what you'll do is specify
which key paths you want,

00:12:23.556 --> 00:12:24.946 A:middle
those things will get
applied to the view.

00:12:24.946 --> 00:12:28.106 A:middle
And it applies the animatable
properties of the view.

00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:30.756 A:middle
So if it's a CA animatable
property, you'll be able

00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:32.246 A:middle
to use it with motions effects.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.956 A:middle
And the idea is that
you're going

00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:38.836 A:middle
to produce a very subtle effect
that really intrigues your user

00:12:38.836 --> 00:12:40.616 A:middle
and really indicates the content

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:43.896 A:middle
or the focus of your
application.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:44.916 A:middle
So the motion effects--

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:48.056 A:middle
the easiest motion effect to
use is a canned one that we have

00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:50.556 A:middle
in UIKit called
UIInterpolatingMotionEffect.

00:12:51.756 --> 00:12:54.236 A:middle
There's one initializer
and it was KeyPath type.

00:12:54.236 --> 00:12:58.136 A:middle
And the KeyPath is the property
on the view that you want

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:00.826 A:middle
to effect, and the type is
one of these two things.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:00.826 A:middle
to effect, and the type is
one of these two things.

00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:04.856 A:middle
It's either along the horizontal
axis or along the vertical axis.

00:13:05.716 --> 00:13:08.176 A:middle
And so, you'll specify, if you
want to do something in both,

00:13:08.176 --> 00:13:10.946 A:middle
you'll have to create two of
these and decide with KeyPath

00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:12.496 A:middle
and which type you're
going to be affecting.

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:15.676 A:middle
It interpolates between
the minimumRelativeValue

00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:18.226 A:middle
and the maximumRelativeValue,
right.

00:13:18.926 --> 00:13:21.086 A:middle
So you'll be able
attach these to a view.

00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:23.876 A:middle
And having it attach
to those views

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:27.086 A:middle
as the device moves
will take care

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:30.116 A:middle
of doing all the application
of that effect to the view.

00:13:30.116 --> 00:13:32.746 A:middle
So you can do things like change
the center, change the size,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:33.966 A:middle
change the offset, you know,

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.596 A:middle
all of the various
animatable properties,

00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:37.626 A:middle
you can change the
frame as well.

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:40.776 A:middle
If you want to write your
own, you can do that.

00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:45.656 A:middle
You can use the UIMotionEffect
Abstract superclass.

00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:47.226 A:middle
There's one method on it,

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:51.856 A:middle
keyPathsAndRelative
valuesForViewsOffset--

00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.386 A:middle
ViewerOffset, there we go.

00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:57.246 A:middle
The ViewerOffset is expressed--
we don't use UIOffset very much

00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:59.336 A:middle
in our API if you've seen
but just as a reminder,

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:01.146 A:middle
that's a horizontal
and vertical offset.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:01.146 A:middle
that's a horizontal
and vertical offset.

00:14:01.146 --> 00:14:03.726 A:middle
So horizontal is obviously
that the axis that we're using

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:06.266 A:middle
for the interpolating motion
effect as well as the vertical.

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:09.596 A:middle
You'll overwrite this and
provide-- you'll get a--

00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:13.126 A:middle
you know, provide a dictionary
of the key paths that you want

00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:16.906 A:middle
and what values given the
inputs of that UIOffset.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:18.086 A:middle
So this is how you can write all

00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:22.616 A:middle
of your own more
complicated motion effect.

00:14:22.756 --> 00:14:25.576 A:middle
You'll add or move them to the
view with just addMotionEffect

00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:26.606 A:middle
and removeMotionEffect.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.896 A:middle
And if you need find out
what affects are on the view,

00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:32.826 A:middle
you can go ahead and call
the motion effect's accessor.

00:14:35.986 --> 00:14:39.096 A:middle
These are really,
really interesting APIs

00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:40.746 A:middle
because there's not
much to the API

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:42.516 A:middle
but it concentrates on behavior.

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:45.776 A:middle
So what you'll be able to do
is add these things gradually

00:14:45.776 --> 00:14:47.526 A:middle
to your application and
touches here and there.

00:14:48.116 --> 00:14:51.196 A:middle
And it'll really make
your application pop, so.

00:14:51.986 --> 00:14:54.806 A:middle
We've made some enhancements
to collection views, all right.

00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:56.966 A:middle
Collection view is
really flexible.

00:14:57.336 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
There are really interesting
ways to be able to combine them.

00:14:57.336 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
There are really interesting
ways to be able to combine them.

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:05.046 A:middle
And you're really able to do a
large scale layouts without lots

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:09.116 A:middle
and lots of individual layouts
subview tweaky little calls.

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:12.146 A:middle
One of the things that we've
added is a convenience API

00:15:12.146 --> 00:15:14.806 A:middle
for switching between two
collection view layouts,

00:15:14.876 --> 00:15:17.956 A:middle
setCollectionViewLayout animated
completion is a new method

00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:19.666 A:middle
which compliments the old one

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:21.326 A:middle
that didn't have the
completion handlers.

00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:23.696 A:middle
Now, if you are animating
it, you can find out exactly

00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:25.966 A:middle
when that animation completed.

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:29.036 A:middle
So this is just a
little one off method

00:15:29.036 --> 00:15:30.056 A:middle
to help you out with that.

00:15:30.606 --> 00:15:32.956 A:middle
But one of the things we've
done in terms of switching

00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:36.326 A:middle
between two different collection
view layouts is added a really

00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:38.876 A:middle
easy way to be able to
interpolate between the two

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:40.886 A:middle
with what's called
UICollectionView

00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:41.956 A:middle
TransitionLayout.

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:46.296 A:middle
And a transition layout is a
UICollectionViewLayout object.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:49.836 A:middle
You hand it two other collection
view layouts, the current lay

00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:52.516 A:middle
out and the next layout,
and then we'll take care

00:15:52.516 --> 00:15:54.656 A:middle
of interpolating
between those two

00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:57.126 A:middle
as you drive the
transition progress.

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
So if you're needing to update
values in there yourself

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
So if you're needing to update
values in there yourself

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.906 A:middle
for a custom subclass,
you'll get called

00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:07.246 A:middle
with updateValueForAnimatedKey
or value forAnimatedKey

00:16:07.246 --> 00:16:08.526 A:middle
so you find out what's happening

00:16:08.526 --> 00:16:09.876 A:middle
as the
CollectionViewTransitionLayout

00:16:09.876 --> 00:16:10.416 A:middle
is firing.

00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:12.396 A:middle
But for the most part,
you'll just be able

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:15.586 A:middle
to call this transition,
setTransitionProgress property

00:16:16.186 --> 00:16:18.676 A:middle
and say, "You know, I'm 10
percent, 20 percent, 30 percent,

00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:20.976 A:middle
40 percent of the way through
it," and we'll take care

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:22.986 A:middle
of interpolating between
all of the elements

00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:24.456 A:middle
in your collection view layout

00:16:24.456 --> 00:16:27.316 A:middle
in the starting collection
layout and the ending one

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:31.396 A:middle
and take care all of the
movement of the views

00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:32.686 A:middle
and everything else for you.

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:36.086 A:middle
So, this transition API is
really handy if you combine it

00:16:36.086 --> 00:16:40.146 A:middle
with the UIView controller,
API to be able to switch

00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:42.596 A:middle
between navigation
controllers and handoff

00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:45.186 A:middle
that collection view
itself that we're talking

00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:46.806 A:middle
about in the previous talk.

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:52.806 A:middle
So, collection view layout, very
powerful, very easy now be able

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:54.886 A:middle
to ship between two
different layouts.

00:16:56.286 --> 00:16:59.216 A:middle
View controllers, of
course, are the unit

00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:03.846 A:middle
of composition for UIKit.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:03.846 A:middle
of composition for UIKit.

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:06.296 A:middle
We've made a lot of
changes to view controllers

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:09.076 A:middle
to accommodate the new
API-- the new appearance.

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:11.465 A:middle
We've also made a number of
changes, try to make it easier

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:14.566 A:middle
for you to be able participate
in a lot of the things

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.175 A:middle
that we do in terms of canned
animations and stuff like that.

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.546 A:middle
But of one of the
first things I want

00:17:18.546 --> 00:17:21.376 A:middle
to mention is
wantsFullScreenLayout.

00:17:22.486 --> 00:17:26.945 A:middle
So, a lot of what you were
doing in iOS 6 in terms

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.396 A:middle
of full screen layout was
dealing with things like this.

00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:31.016 A:middle
Here's a picture of the dog.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:33.846 A:middle
He was helping me out with
my presentation last week,

00:17:33.976 --> 00:17:37.996 A:middle
cleaning things up or, as
I like to call it, snoring.

00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:43.096 A:middle
This is a non-full screen
layout iOS 6 view controller.

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:47.166 A:middle
And if you were going to call
wantsFullScreenLayout yes,

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:50.746 A:middle
and then if you set your
navigation bar appearance

00:17:50.746 --> 00:17:52.756 A:middle
to be translucent and
your status bar appearance

00:17:52.756 --> 00:17:54.556 A:middle
to be translucent, you
get something like this

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:57.486 A:middle
and this is the classic
barb with full screen layout

00:17:57.486 --> 00:17:58.606 A:middle
which is, you know,
you're not really--

00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:00.876 A:middle
I'm not stretching out the
content here to make sure

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:00.876 A:middle
I'm not stretching out the
content here to make sure

00:18:00.876 --> 00:18:02.356 A:middle
that it fits the
full screen layout.

00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:04.166 A:middle
One of the things that
we want to make sure

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:07.466 A:middle
that you guys are doing is
using full screen layout

00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:11.616 A:middle
because iOS 7 deprecates
this property entirely.

00:18:12.106 --> 00:18:14.456 A:middle
wantsFullScreenLayout
is no longer useful.

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.696 A:middle
We will treat as if it
were yes all the time

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.286 A:middle
for [inaudible] or after 7.0.

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:23.086 A:middle
So, with Bud resting
here, you can kind

00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:24.866 A:middle
of see how the content is slid

00:18:24.866 --> 00:18:28.166 A:middle
up under the navigation bar
and-- but the way that--

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.786 A:middle
in iOS 7 that we're
going to have you specify

00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:34.486 A:middle
which edges get stretched
in a situation like this is

00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:35.906 A:middle
with this extended edge API.

00:18:37.056 --> 00:18:39.106 A:middle
And some of this is in flux,

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:40.926 A:middle
but this is what in
Seed 1 right now.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:42.186 A:middle
It may look a little different.

00:18:42.186 --> 00:18:43.636 A:middle
We're still tinkering
with some of the names.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:48.876 A:middle
But the extended edge API here
is specifying that the edges

00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:51.036 A:middle
for extended layout for
your view controller,

00:18:52.146 --> 00:18:54.076 A:middle
this property is going
to be all by default.

00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:56.986 A:middle
We want to be able to take
you views and expand them

00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:58.526 A:middle
to their full content size.

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:01.226 A:middle
But if you want to specify
only the left and right edges

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:01.226 A:middle
But if you want to specify
only the left and right edges

00:19:01.226 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
and leave the top and
bottom the way they are,

00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:05.556 A:middle
you would logically [inaudible]
some of the flags together.

00:19:06.316 --> 00:19:07.046 A:middle
You can also check

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.166 A:middle
if the extended layout
includes the opaque bars.

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:11.016 A:middle
This is no by default in iOS 7.

00:19:11.626 --> 00:19:14.576 A:middle
And automatically
AdjustsScrollViewInsets is how

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:17.206 A:middle
we're going to take a look at
the scroll view that's probably

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:19.856 A:middle
at the top of your view
controller and say, "OK,

00:19:20.796 --> 00:19:22.876 A:middle
I can adjust the content
insets to make sure

00:19:22.876 --> 00:19:26.766 A:middle
that the content is actually
positioned correctly inside a

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:30.106 A:middle
navigation controller or a Tab
bar controller because now all

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:33.306 A:middle
of those bars, the Nav bar and
the Tab bar and the Tool bar

00:19:33.586 --> 00:19:37.196 A:middle
or Tab bar at the bottom have
that blur translucent effect."

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:39.816 A:middle
So we want to make sure that
all of your content is winding

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:40.806 A:middle
up in the right place.

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:43.906 A:middle
These methods are how we're
going to help you adjust

00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:44.966 A:middle
that content automatically.

00:19:44.966 --> 00:19:47.556 A:middle
So automatically
AdjustsScrollViewInsets will

00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.236 A:middle
take of a lot of
those numbers of you.

00:19:49.446 --> 00:19:52.446 A:middle
And this also takes care things
like when the device rotates,

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:55.066 A:middle
exactly how far you adjust
those insets because, of course,

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:57.106 A:middle
on the phone, when you
rotate to landscape,

00:19:57.106 --> 00:20:00.446 A:middle
the Nav bar's a little
shorter, so.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.106 --> 00:20:00.446 A:middle
the Nav bar's a little
shorter, so.

00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:04.096 A:middle
We also we have new
API for content size.

00:20:04.096 --> 00:20:08.256 A:middle
So in many cases, we take a
view controller from you guys

00:20:08.256 --> 00:20:10.976 A:middle
or from-- you take one
from another component

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.836 A:middle
like address book or something
like that, and you're going

00:20:13.836 --> 00:20:16.376 A:middle
to make a child view controller
of your view controller,

00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:17.516 A:middle
you want to find
out how big it is.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:20.426 A:middle
So preferredContentSize is
a way for view controller

00:20:20.426 --> 00:20:23.216 A:middle
to tell UIKit or tell
parent view controllers,

00:20:23.786 --> 00:20:26.576 A:middle
"I'd like to be this
size," right.

00:20:26.716 --> 00:20:30.786 A:middle
And this is actually replacement
for the content size review

00:20:30.786 --> 00:20:32.206 A:middle
in popover call because
we're going

00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:34.796 A:middle
to use this call
everywhere now in iOS 7.

00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:36.766 A:middle
So if you want to tell us how
big your view controller ought

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:38.766 A:middle
to be right when
we initialize it,

00:20:39.126 --> 00:20:40.386 A:middle
this is your opportunity
to do it.

00:20:41.286 --> 00:20:42.706 A:middle
And it's a great way
to be able say, "OK,

00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:43.856 A:middle
I'm going to take
this view controller,

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:47.466 A:middle
make it a certain size, how
big do you want it to be?"

00:20:47.826 --> 00:20:49.946 A:middle
So, layout is very important.

00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:54.256 A:middle
In terms of the status bar
appearance, there's new behavior

00:20:54.256 --> 00:20:56.446 A:middle
for the status bar and the
status bar actually has

00:20:56.446 --> 00:20:57.116 A:middle
no background.

00:20:57.116 --> 00:21:01.126 A:middle
What's you're seeing in iOS 7
is the navigation bar getting

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.116 --> 00:21:01.126 A:middle
What's you're seeing in iOS 7
is the navigation bar getting

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:04.076 A:middle
taller and the status bar
being over laid on it.

00:21:04.076 --> 00:21:07.696 A:middle
UIStatusBarStyleDefault
is what you see--

00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:09.586 A:middle
it's got what we
call "Dark content",

00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:13.296 A:middle
meaning the status
bar information is all

00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:14.796 A:middle
in black or dark color.

00:21:15.596 --> 00:21:16.346 A:middle
Status bar--

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:20.506 A:middle
UIStatusBarStyleLightContent
has white text up there.

00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:24.326 A:middle
So if your content
is going to be dark

00:21:24.326 --> 00:21:28.296 A:middle
or otherwise not contrast
with the default, you may want

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:30.336 A:middle
to set UIStatusBarLightContent.

00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:33.036 A:middle
And this refers to the content
of the status bar itself.

00:21:34.036 --> 00:21:37.836 A:middle
These other two properties,
StatusBarStyleBlackTranslucent

00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:41.876 A:middle
and StatusBarStyleBlackOpaque,
those refer to the background

00:21:42.066 --> 00:21:43.456 A:middle
which really doesn't
make any sense anymore.

00:21:43.456 --> 00:21:44.596 A:middle
They don't have a
background now.

00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:46.366 A:middle
So, those are deprecated.

00:21:46.366 --> 00:21:47.326 A:middle
You can stop using them.

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:52.536 A:middle
So if you recall with-- there
are two major sections of UIKit

00:21:52.606 --> 00:21:56.796 A:middle
or behaviors in UIKit where
we do these transitions,

00:21:56.796 --> 00:22:00.386 A:middle
where you slide, you do a push
pop in navigation controllers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.796 --> 00:22:00.386 A:middle
where you slide, you do a push
pop in navigation controllers

00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:01.836 A:middle
or for a modal transition,

00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:07.386 A:middle
the presentation slides
up from the bottom.

00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:08.906 A:middle
Those are all canned
transitions.

00:22:08.906 --> 00:22:09.636 A:middle
You haven't been able

00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:12.396 A:middle
to participate in
those until iOS 7.

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:16.446 A:middle
So iOS 7 introduces
custom transitions in all

00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:18.166 A:middle
of our API that does it.

00:22:18.216 --> 00:22:20.286 A:middle
So you're talking about
navigation controller push

00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:23.656 A:middle
and pop, we've got
modal transitions.

00:22:24.506 --> 00:22:28.666 A:middle
You'll be able to drive
these both off a timer.

00:22:29.106 --> 00:22:32.236 A:middle
So if you're just doing a
straight push or a straight pop,

00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:35.106 A:middle
you'll be able to participate in
that with your own transition,

00:22:35.246 --> 00:22:38.156 A:middle
or you'll be able set up
an interactive transition

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:40.766 A:middle
with the user actually
sliding their thumb across

00:22:40.766 --> 00:22:42.856 A:middle
and you'll get all kinds of
events about things like whether

00:22:42.856 --> 00:22:44.106 A:middle
or not they made it all
the way across [inaudible],

00:22:44.136 --> 00:22:45.616 A:middle
whether they canceled
the transition,

00:22:46.456 --> 00:22:48.036 A:middle
or whether they made
it all the way across

00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:49.836 A:middle
and actually finished
the transition.

00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:51.376 A:middle
There's a new delegate method

00:22:51.376 --> 00:22:54.326 A:middle
of UIViewController called
transitioningDelegate.

00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:58.116 A:middle
The transitioningDelegate is
going to be the object called

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:00.866 A:middle
to find out how to
do this transition.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:00.866 A:middle
to find out how to
do this transition.

00:23:00.866 --> 00:23:02.996 A:middle
So, let's say you've got
an UINavigationController,

00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:04.736 A:middle
you're pushing a new
view controller on it.

00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:08.176 A:middle
If that view controller has a
transitioningDelegate property

00:23:08.336 --> 00:23:11.446 A:middle
set on it, that object's going
to get one of these methods,

00:23:11.446 --> 00:23:13.986 A:middle
animationController
ForPresentedController,

00:23:14.336 --> 00:23:16.796 A:middle
presentingController,
sourceController.

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.236 A:middle
So the sourceController or
the presentingController,

00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:22.016 A:middle
you're given all of
the view controllers

00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:25.076 A:middle
that are participating
in the transition.

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:28.746 A:middle
And animationController
ForDismissedController,

00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:32.086 A:middle
this is basically the equivalent
of a pop or a dismissal

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:33.546 A:middle
of a modal transition.

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:37.176 A:middle
The objects conform
to this protocol,

00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:40.216 A:middle
UIViewController
AnimatedTransitioning protocol.

00:23:40.216 --> 00:23:43.216 A:middle
The protocol is really
useful here because it means

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.076 A:middle
that you can specify any object.

00:23:45.076 --> 00:23:46.226 A:middle
It can be another
view controller.

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.786 A:middle
It can be an object
of your own type.

00:23:48.396 --> 00:23:50.686 A:middle
As long as it conforms to
this protocol, you'll be able

00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:52.756 A:middle
to drive these transitions.

00:23:53.846 --> 00:23:58.116 A:middle
For interaction, we'll ask
the transitioningDelegate

00:23:58.116 --> 00:24:00.256 A:middle
for an interaction
controller for a presentation

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.116 --> 00:24:00.256 A:middle
for an interaction
controller for a presentation

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:02.466 A:middle
or an interaction
controller for dismissal

00:24:02.466 --> 00:24:03.316 A:middle
when the thing's going away.

00:24:03.316 --> 00:24:05.496 A:middle
So presentation on Nav
contoller is, of course, a pop,

00:24:06.076 --> 00:24:08.176 A:middle
the dismissal would
be-- I'm sorry--

00:24:08.336 --> 00:24:11.676 A:middle
presentation's a push,
dismissal is a pop.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:13.526 A:middle
It has its own protocol as well.

00:24:13.526 --> 00:24:17.206 A:middle
So you are in a maze of twisty
little protocols all alike.

00:24:18.696 --> 00:24:19.886 A:middle
They're actually not all alike.

00:24:19.886 --> 00:24:21.736 A:middle
They're very, very powerful.

00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:23.746 A:middle
And for instance,

00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:26.556 A:middle
the AnimatedTransitioning
protocol, it's pretty simple.

00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:28.706 A:middle
The transitionDuration,
animateTransition,

00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:30.616 A:middle
and animationEnded,
these are all methods

00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:34.866 A:middle
that your transitioning
object will get called on.

00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:37.666 A:middle
You can return the
transitionDuration

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:39.436 A:middle
for a given transition context.

00:24:39.516 --> 00:24:42.006 A:middle
The animateTransition
for a transition context.

00:24:42.006 --> 00:24:43.646 A:middle
This is when you're told, "Go
ahead and do the animation."

00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:47.336 A:middle
We're ready to go do your
slide, do your fading,

00:24:47.336 --> 00:24:50.776 A:middle
do your twirly transition there.

00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:54.466 A:middle
And animationEnded, this
is how you find out when

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:55.956 A:middle
that transition ended.

00:24:56.126 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
So, the animated bits,
this is for the parts

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:56.126 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
So, the animated bits,
this is for the parts

00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:02.446 A:middle
where things are
happening on a timer,

00:25:02.446 --> 00:25:04.186 A:middle
things are happening
on our context.

00:25:05.696 --> 00:25:06.616 A:middle
Custom transitions

00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:09.256 A:middle
for UIViewController
InteractiveTransitioning,

00:25:09.516 --> 00:25:11.846 A:middle
you'll be told when to
start the animation,

00:25:12.316 --> 00:25:14.006 A:middle
the interactive transition,
right?

00:25:14.006 --> 00:25:16.006 A:middle
So just like the other API,
this is where you're going

00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:16.826 A:middle
to start the interaction.

00:25:17.186 --> 00:25:19.946 A:middle
And the completionSpeed and the
completionCurve are used to find

00:25:19.946 --> 00:25:24.866 A:middle
out when the user got far enough
across, did they finish or not,

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.976 A:middle
and if they didn't
or if they did,

00:25:27.266 --> 00:25:31.126 A:middle
how fast do you want the rest
of the animation to run, right?

00:25:31.126 --> 00:25:33.026 A:middle
So when you're sliding
your thumb across

00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:35.676 A:middle
and you're driving one of these
things based on user gestures,

00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:37.876 A:middle
if you get all the way across,

00:25:37.876 --> 00:25:39.726 A:middle
then it must have
run the completion,

00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:41.936 A:middle
I think half way across, a
little bit more than half way.

00:25:41.936 --> 00:25:44.176 A:middle
And that means, yes, you
can actually do the rest

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:45.586 A:middle
of the transition as
if they completed.

00:25:45.846 --> 00:25:48.786 A:middle
This is how you specify how long
it takes and what the curve is.

00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:51.806 A:middle
And the curve is
the UIAnimation bit.

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:53.856 A:middle
Here's the meat of it.

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:57.806 A:middle
The UIViewController
ContextTransitioning, again,

00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.036 A:middle
this is a protocol that
your objects conform to.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.036 A:middle
this is a protocol that
your objects conform to.

00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:03.706 A:middle
This is where you put all of
the information that you need

00:26:03.706 --> 00:26:05.426 A:middle
in order to drive
these animations.

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:07.516 A:middle
You'll need to supply
a container view.

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:10.246 A:middle
Frequently, this is the
parent view controller's view.

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:13.156 A:middle
Whether or not it's
animated, whether or not

00:26:13.156 --> 00:26:15.236 A:middle
in it's interactive, whether

00:26:15.236 --> 00:26:17.446 A:middle
or not a particular transition
was canceled, you'll be able

00:26:17.446 --> 00:26:20.766 A:middle
to do all of that and
find out from this

00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:22.646 A:middle
that the transition
was canceled.

00:26:23.116 --> 00:26:26.196 A:middle
You'll also specify -- you can
specify presentation styles

00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:27.666 A:middle
and all kinds of stuff.

00:26:28.426 --> 00:26:31.516 A:middle
This is incredibly powerful.

00:26:31.516 --> 00:26:33.636 A:middle
And this is the mechanism that
we're using, for instance,

00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:36.366 A:middle
to do the slide transition in
navigation controllers now,

00:26:36.716 --> 00:26:39.556 A:middle
so you'll be able to participate
in all of those things yourself.

00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:43.056 A:middle
We've got a Custom Transitions
Using View Controllers talk

00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.276 A:middle
in Pacific Heights
on Thursday at 11:30.

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:48.196 A:middle
If you've ever wanted to be able
to participate in these things,

00:26:48.636 --> 00:26:49.986 A:middle
that's the talk to go to.

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:51.836 A:middle
So, let's talk a little bit

00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:54.166 A:middle
about some new stuff
in State Restoration.

00:26:54.896 --> 00:26:56.816 A:middle
One of the things that
we've noticed in terms

00:26:56.816 --> 00:26:59.606 A:middle
of our own usage of state
restoration is there are times

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:02.716 A:middle
where your content or the state

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:02.716 A:middle
where your content or the state

00:27:02.716 --> 00:27:06.126 A:middle
that you're restoring doesn't
really match the snapshot we

00:27:06.126 --> 00:27:10.466 A:middle
took when your app got
killed before, right.

00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.436 A:middle
So, one of the new
methods that's available

00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:17.396 A:middle
in state restoration
is ignoreSnapshotOn

00:27:17.396 --> 00:27:18.766 A:middle
NextApplicationLaunch.

00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:21.466 A:middle
So, you've discovered as
a function of starting

00:27:21.466 --> 00:27:25.296 A:middle
through the state restoration
mechanism that allow,

00:27:25.296 --> 00:27:27.226 A:middle
you know what, the
snapshot that's going

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:29.226 A:middle
to get taken won't
make any sense.

00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:31.336 A:middle
You can call
ignoreSnapshotOnNextAppLaunch.

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:33.656 A:middle
That method will prevent
us from taking a snapshot.

00:27:33.656 --> 00:27:35.086 A:middle
You'll get the default
ping when it comes up.

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:37.716 A:middle
You'll be able to still do
state restoration things

00:27:37.716 --> 00:27:41.276 A:middle
when your app comes up but
it won't have the old content

00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:43.836 A:middle
if it doesn't make sense.

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:47.226 A:middle
One of the other things that's
been a very popular request is

00:27:47.456 --> 00:27:50.386 A:middle
for objects that aren't views
or view controllers to be able

00:27:50.386 --> 00:27:52.536 A:middle
to participate in a state
restoration machinery.

00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:54.806 A:middle
So you may have your
own model objects

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:57.676 A:middle
or you may have your own
informational objects

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.126 A:middle
or created models, things like
that, that are all going to need

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.126 A:middle
or created models, things like
that, that are all going to need

00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:01.856 A:middle
to participate in
state restoration,

00:28:02.396 --> 00:28:04.806 A:middle
you can use this method,

00:28:05.456 --> 00:28:07.616 A:middle
registerObjectFor
StateRestoration

00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:08.866 A:middle
restorationIdentifier.

00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:12.906 A:middle
So just like view controllers
can have restorationIdentifiers

00:28:12.906 --> 00:28:16.056 A:middle
just like other views can
restorationIdentifiers,

00:28:16.406 --> 00:28:19.026 A:middle
you'll now be able to specify
a restorationIdentifier

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:20.896 A:middle
for arbitrary objects.

00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.056 A:middle
You'll call UIApplication
registerObject

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:25.916 A:middle
ForStateRestoration
restorationIdentifier,

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:27.856 A:middle
tell us the object,
tell us the identifier.

00:28:28.286 --> 00:28:30.736 A:middle
And as long as you conform to
the state restoring protocol,

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.966 A:middle
we'll go ahead and
restore that object along

00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:36.506 A:middle
with everything else during the
state restoration mechanism.

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.806 A:middle
So this is a great way be
able hand us more information

00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:42.636 A:middle
and you guys can do a little bit
less work in terms of archiving

00:28:42.636 --> 00:28:45.106 A:middle
and saving off your additional
state 'cause we'll keep track

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:46.996 A:middle
of it for you.

00:28:47.636 --> 00:28:50.056 A:middle
We also now support a couple
of interesting features.

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.656 A:middle
If you're using Core
Bluetooth and you've paired

00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:57.126 A:middle
up with a Bluetooth Central or a
peripheral in your application,

00:28:57.566 --> 00:29:00.626 A:middle
we can now state restore
those things for you as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.566 --> 00:29:00.626 A:middle
we can now state restore
those things for you as well.

00:29:01.486 --> 00:29:03.966 A:middle
So UIApplicationLaunchOptions
BluetoothCentralsKey,

00:29:03.966 --> 00:29:07.156 A:middle
when you get the state
restoration method callback,

00:29:07.556 --> 00:29:08.116 A:middle
one of these things

00:29:08.116 --> 00:29:09.636 A:middle
in the userInfo dictionary
will be the--

00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:11.966 A:middle
all of the identifiers
for the Bluetooth Centrals

00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:14.256 A:middle
that we can determine
that were present

00:29:14.256 --> 00:29:16.036 A:middle
when you went down before.

00:29:16.036 --> 00:29:18.186 A:middle
So, you'll be able to
pull all those back up

00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:19.466 A:middle
and reconnect very easily.

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:22.816 A:middle
And if you were connected to
peripherals, you'll be able

00:29:22.816 --> 00:29:24.656 A:middle
to get to all of
those peripherals back

00:29:24.656 --> 00:29:27.606 A:middle
out of the array that's
returned by this key as well.

00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:30.176 A:middle
So, you don't have
to go back and try

00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
to repair everything without--

00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:35.296 A:middle
and keep track of
all of that stuff

00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:36.996 A:middle
because we'll take
care of it for you.

00:29:37.566 --> 00:29:40.596 A:middle
Let's talk a little
bit about AirDrop.

00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:43.126 A:middle
AirDrop is new iOS 7.

00:29:43.126 --> 00:29:45.376 A:middle
You've got the Activity
View Controller that comes

00:29:45.376 --> 00:29:46.916 A:middle
up in AirDrop as an option.

00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:49.636 A:middle
One of things that you'll
do is go ahead and look

00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:53.036 A:middle
in the
ActivityItemSourceProtocol,

00:29:53.556 --> 00:29:55.336 A:middle
make sure that your
object conforms to that.

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.956 A:middle
You'll update your
Info.plist which will create

00:29:57.956 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
or register the UTIs for
the things that you're going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.956 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
or register the UTIs for
the things that you're going

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:01.966 A:middle
to be able to accept
as an AirDrop.

00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:04.386 A:middle
And there's a new
Documents/Inbox directory.

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:06.906 A:middle
This directory lives in
your application's wrapper.

00:30:08.146 --> 00:30:12.586 A:middle
And that wrapper-- the Inbox
directory will accept all

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.186 A:middle
of the things that
are being AirDropped

00:30:14.186 --> 00:30:16.356 A:middle
to your application, right.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.136 A:middle
So whenever your
application activates,

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.266 A:middle
you'll want to take a tour
through this directory and see

00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:22.306 A:middle
if there's anything new in there
that you'll want to pull in.

00:30:22.906 --> 00:30:25.626 A:middle
New documents, new things
that other users have shared

00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:28.776 A:middle
with you are going to come along
with these app activations.

00:30:29.586 --> 00:30:31.056 A:middle
And you should check this even

00:30:31.056 --> 00:30:34.106 A:middle
if you don't get the
usual application:openURL

00:30:34.106 --> 00:30:35.656 A:middle
:sourceApplication :annotation:

00:30:35.656 --> 00:30:37.146 A:middle
call because these
things are going to come

00:30:37.146 --> 00:30:39.726 A:middle
in from other places and
they may come in frequently.

00:30:39.726 --> 00:30:43.616 A:middle
So somebody AirDrops 10 or 12
things to you, you might want

00:30:43.616 --> 00:30:44.856 A:middle
to be able to queue
that work up.

00:30:44.856 --> 00:30:47.346 A:middle
You don't want to do all of
the transition work of "Oh,

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:49.816 A:middle
I received this thing and then
I'm going to move it over here

00:30:49.816 --> 00:30:50.956 A:middle
and process it somehow."

00:30:51.186 --> 00:30:53.926 A:middle
You want to defer that until a
point where the application is--

00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:57.176 A:middle
you want to make sure that the
application to stay responsive.

00:30:57.176 --> 00:30:58.576 A:middle
You don't want to block
the user doing that.

00:30:58.626 --> 00:31:00.476 A:middle
So you might want to queue
this stuff up if you discover

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.626 --> 00:31:00.476 A:middle
So you might want to queue
this stuff up if you discover

00:31:00.476 --> 00:31:05.216 A:middle
that there are 12 or 15
things in the Inbox directory.

00:31:05.686 --> 00:31:08.236 A:middle
This is tremendously
exciting because it's going

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:12.156 A:middle
to be a very easy behavior-base
way for you guys to add really,

00:31:12.586 --> 00:31:14.016 A:middle
really, really subtle effects

00:31:14.056 --> 00:31:16.526 A:middle
but really fantastic
physics-base effects

00:31:16.526 --> 00:31:18.076 A:middle
and animations to
your application.

00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:20.646 A:middle
The idea is to be
able to provide fluid,

00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:24.996 A:middle
very responsive animations
that enhance the interactions

00:31:24.996 --> 00:31:26.796 A:middle
in your application, all right.

00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:28.766 A:middle
This is not something
that you should be using

00:31:28.766 --> 00:31:29.626 A:middle
that says, "Hey look.

00:31:29.626 --> 00:31:31.536 A:middle
This is animating and it's
bouncy and it's physics."

00:31:31.536 --> 00:31:34.136 A:middle
It should be really,
really carefully considered.

00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:37.536 A:middle
And the concentration of
the API is on behaviors.

00:31:38.276 --> 00:31:40.246 A:middle
We don't want you to have to
write lots and lots of code

00:31:40.246 --> 00:31:41.526 A:middle
to be able to get basic things

00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:44.826 A:middle
like views dropping
down from the screen.

00:31:45.216 --> 00:31:48.266 A:middle
The Lock Screen effect
where you bounce the camera,

00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:50.486 A:middle
you bounce the Lock
Screen to find the camera,

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:53.006 A:middle
that's very few lines of code.

00:31:53.006 --> 00:31:56.236 A:middle
It's attaching behaviors to
a view rather than having

00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:58.726 A:middle
to write all of the
physics behavior behind it.

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:02.786 A:middle
What you'll do is create one of
these UIDynamicAnimator objects.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:02.786 A:middle
What you'll do is create one of
these UIDynamicAnimator objects.

00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:05.556 A:middle
And a Dynamic Animator
concentrates

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:06.456 A:middle
on a reference view.

00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:09.396 A:middle
Most of the time, you'll be
using this view initializer,

00:32:09.486 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
initWithReferenceView.

00:32:11.746 --> 00:32:13.666 A:middle
That view contains-- it's going

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.996 A:middle
to apply behaviors
to everything in it.

00:32:17.056 --> 00:32:18.756 A:middle
You'll add dynamic behaviors

00:32:18.756 --> 00:32:21.136 A:middle
or remove dynamic behaviors
depending on what's going on.

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:24.106 A:middle
And you can also find out if
you're writing one of your own,

00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:25.646 A:middle
all of the items
in a given rect.

00:32:25.646 --> 00:32:28.676 A:middle
So you may want to be able
to do things like only look

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:30.886 A:middle
at the visible rectangle and
only animate those things

00:32:30.886 --> 00:32:32.156 A:middle
that are actually
visible if you're going

00:32:32.256 --> 00:32:33.896 A:middle
to write your own
dynamic animators.

00:32:34.226 --> 00:32:37.046 A:middle
You can also find out
whether or not it's running

00:32:37.566 --> 00:32:38.666 A:middle
so you'll be able
to know whether

00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.736 A:middle
or not the animation
has come to rest.

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:45.436 A:middle
And there's a delegate that
tells you also when things come

00:32:45.436 --> 00:32:47.166 A:middle
to rest, when things
started up again.

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:49.776 A:middle
So, one of the things that we're
doing with this is making sure

00:32:49.776 --> 00:32:53.696 A:middle
that you're concentrating on the
behavior, we're concentrating

00:32:53.696 --> 00:32:55.086 A:middle
on the bookkeeping
for the physics.

00:32:55.976 --> 00:33:01.526 A:middle
Dynamic behaviors are
just a tree of all kinds

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:55.976 --> 00:33:01.526 A:middle
Dynamic behaviors are
just a tree of all kinds

00:33:01.526 --> 00:33:03.586 A:middle
of supported things for gravity

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:05.166 A:middle
and collisions and
stuff like that.

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.976 A:middle
So you'll add or
remove child behaviors

00:33:06.976 --> 00:33:08.406 A:middle
to a given dynamic behavior.

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:12.436 A:middle
And a dynamic behavior
defines all kinds

00:33:12.496 --> 00:33:14.536 A:middle
of timings and things like that.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.906 A:middle
One of the things that you can
do is you can also implement an

00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:17.896 A:middle
action block.

00:33:18.286 --> 00:33:21.406 A:middle
It gets called at every frame
of the dynamic animation.

00:33:21.406 --> 00:33:22.486 A:middle
So if you need to do something

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:26.876 A:middle
that our built-in behaviors
don't do or can't really support

00:33:26.876 --> 00:33:30.216 A:middle
without additional help from
the system as it's running,

00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:31.716 A:middle
you can implement
this Action method.

00:33:32.066 --> 00:33:34.856 A:middle
It shouldn't be too
common, but you can do it.

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:36.916 A:middle
What are those supported
behaviors?

00:33:37.886 --> 00:33:39.476 A:middle
Attachments, so if
you want to be able

00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:41.506 A:middle
to have one view
follow another view,

00:33:42.156 --> 00:33:43.856 A:middle
you can attach the
two views together

00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:45.146 A:middle
and they'll animate together.

00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:48.916 A:middle
CollisionBehavior, if two
views are going to bump

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:50.116 A:middle
into each other and bounce off

00:33:50.116 --> 00:33:51.616 A:middle
of each other, you
can specify that.

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.646 A:middle
GravityBehavior, how
much gravity is involved,

00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:59.356 A:middle
and that's how we control how
fast that Lock Screen drops back

00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.636 A:middle
down when you're
bringing the camera up.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.636 A:middle
down when you're
bringing the camera up.

00:34:01.366 --> 00:34:04.946 A:middle
A PushBehavior is if you
give it a view an impulse

00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:08.005 A:middle
as if you were giving it a force
and it's going to slide off

00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:09.235 A:middle
and bump into something else.

00:34:09.686 --> 00:34:12.466 A:middle
We have a new unit
of measure I think

00:34:12.466 --> 00:34:13.396 A:middle
that we're introducing there.

00:34:13.396 --> 00:34:14.876 A:middle
You'll have to go to
the Animation talk

00:34:14.906 --> 00:34:15.896 A:middle
to find out what it is.

00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:19.666 A:middle
A SnapBehavior, SnapBehaviors
are really interesting.

00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:23.335 A:middle
They allow you to be able to
specify essentially a well

00:34:23.335 --> 00:34:25.936 A:middle
or a snap so that when a
view overlaps another one,

00:34:26.176 --> 00:34:28.326 A:middle
it folds into place
at that location.

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:32.456 A:middle
And if you need to do
something that isn't setup here,

00:34:32.556 --> 00:34:35.686 A:middle
UIDynamicItemBehavior is your
opportunity to participate

00:34:35.686 --> 00:34:37.235 A:middle
in the system yourself.

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:43.416 A:middle
So DynamicItem is just something
that conforms to this protocol,

00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:46.386 A:middle
center, bounds, transform.

00:34:46.806 --> 00:34:47.815 A:middle
And that's how we move things

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:50.216 A:middle
around on the screen
during the animations.

00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:54.116 A:middle
There are two Dynamics
talks, Getting Started

00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:56.815 A:middle
with UIKit Dynamics
right here at 4:30.

00:34:57.336 --> 00:34:58.896 A:middle
The demos are awesome.

00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:02.616 A:middle
And Olivia will an absolutely
fantastic job talking

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:02.616 A:middle
And Olivia will an absolutely
fantastic job talking

00:35:02.616 --> 00:35:03.396 A:middle
about this.

00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:07.676 A:middle
Advanced Techniques with UIKit
Dynamics, Thursday here at 3:15.

00:35:08.946 --> 00:35:10.406 A:middle
It's very composeable.

00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:12.116 A:middle
It's tremendously powerful.

00:35:12.116 --> 00:35:13.446 A:middle
There's a lot of stuff here.

00:35:13.976 --> 00:35:16.416 A:middle
If you're interested in this
kind of physics-base animation,

00:35:16.876 --> 00:35:19.866 A:middle
you're going to want
to see this talk.

00:35:20.046 --> 00:35:25.156 A:middle
So, let's talk a
little bit about text.

00:35:25.326 --> 00:35:29.596 A:middle
We've always had a concentration
on beautiful typography

00:35:30.216 --> 00:35:32.436 A:middle
and really, really
crisp beautiful text.

00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:34.626 A:middle
In IOS 6, we introduced all

00:35:34.626 --> 00:35:38.286 A:middle
of the NS attributed string
components that enable you

00:35:38.286 --> 00:35:40.796 A:middle
to do things like mix
and match runs of text

00:35:40.796 --> 00:35:43.286 A:middle
with different styles.

00:35:44.126 --> 00:35:46.356 A:middle
You know, bold, italic,
underline, things like that.

00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:49.236 A:middle
We also piped that all
the way through UIKit.

00:35:49.236 --> 00:35:52.246 A:middle
So, buttons and text fields and
text views and stuff like that.

00:35:52.636 --> 00:35:54.686 A:middle
Really, we're able to do--

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:56.876 A:middle
you're able to do far more
typographic things with it.

00:35:57.696 --> 00:36:00.966 A:middle
We've introduced a new
dynamic types sizing mechanism.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.696 --> 00:36:00.966 A:middle
We've introduced a new
dynamic types sizing mechanism.

00:36:00.966 --> 00:36:05.236 A:middle
So, dynamic type, this is the
text size view controller that's

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:06.746 A:middle
in settings.

00:36:07.126 --> 00:36:11.126 A:middle
The user can go and slide
this slider left and right

00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:14.586 A:middle
to decide how large or small
they want their primary content

00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:16.436 A:middle
to be, right.

00:36:17.026 --> 00:36:18.896 A:middle
And that slider is piped

00:36:18.986 --> 00:36:21.896 A:middle
to the
preferredContentSizeCategory

00:36:21.896 --> 00:36:24.716 A:middle
method-- property,
rather, on UIApplication.

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:27.456 A:middle
This is how you find out
what the user selected.

00:36:28.216 --> 00:36:30.496 A:middle
And that preferred content
size categories can be the--

00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:33.836 A:middle
essentially, the text size
for the primary content text

00:36:33.836 --> 00:36:37.556 A:middle
that you're using and that'll be
based with one of these values,

00:36:37.686 --> 00:36:39.636 A:middle
extra small, small,
medium large, extra,

00:36:39.636 --> 00:36:43.826 A:middle
it's like a t-shirt
but with-- for text.

00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:51.326 A:middle
So, this specifies sort of the
base relative size of the text.

00:36:51.486 --> 00:36:53.656 A:middle
When it changes, you'll
find out when it changes

00:36:53.656 --> 00:36:55.386 A:middle
because you'll get a
ContentSizeCategory

00:36:55.386 --> 00:36:59.376 A:middle
DidChangeNotification and a
ContentSize CategoryNewValueKey,

00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:01.366 A:middle
and this is your opportunity
to be able to go back,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:01.366 A:middle
and this is your opportunity
to be able to go back,

00:37:01.696 --> 00:37:04.526 A:middle
find out what changed,
relay out your text.

00:37:04.626 --> 00:37:07.966 A:middle
So, again, with the dynamic
text bits, you're going to want

00:37:07.966 --> 00:37:11.076 A:middle
to be using auto-layout because
that will help you scale your

00:37:11.076 --> 00:37:13.756 A:middle
layout as the text size changes.

00:37:14.856 --> 00:37:16.856 A:middle
They mentioned this
one method here,

00:37:16.856 --> 00:37:20.196 A:middle
preferredFont ForTextStyle,
right.

00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:23.616 A:middle
Most of our content falls
within certain bins.

00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:24.576 A:middle
There's a body.

00:37:25.016 --> 00:37:28.876 A:middle
There are some headlines or
a subject line or something

00:37:28.876 --> 00:37:32.396 A:middle
like that or a smaller
text that's interstitial

00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:34.586 A:middle
like a caption for a
picture, something like that.

00:37:35.196 --> 00:37:38.066 A:middle
All of these styles,
you can pass

00:37:38.066 --> 00:37:40.096 A:middle
into preferredFontForTextStyle.

00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:42.516 A:middle
We'll go through
and evaluate that,

00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:46.906 A:middle
figure out what the appropriate
size, weight, all of the things

00:37:46.906 --> 00:37:48.986 A:middle
that would apply to that
is in relative terms

00:37:48.986 --> 00:37:51.076 A:middle
and produce a new
UIFont for you to use.

00:37:52.076 --> 00:37:54.316 A:middle
So this method
preferredFontForTextStyle is

00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:55.516 A:middle
very, very important.

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:57.466 A:middle
It's the single chill
point to be able

00:37:57.466 --> 00:38:02.916 A:middle
to get relative text styles
and fonts for your application

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.466 --> 00:38:02.916 A:middle
to get relative text styles
and fonts for your application

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:03.946 A:middle
and they'll scale relative

00:38:03.946 --> 00:38:06.296 A:middle
to the primary content
size that you want.

00:38:09.196 --> 00:38:11.706 A:middle
One of the things
that we've noticed is

00:38:12.246 --> 00:38:17.666 A:middle
that the NS attributed string
system is very powerful.

00:38:17.806 --> 00:38:19.176 A:middle
You can specify attributes.

00:38:19.176 --> 00:38:20.486 A:middle
You can do all of these things.

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:24.456 A:middle
But you're pretty much getting
the rendering that we give you.

00:38:25.326 --> 00:38:29.136 A:middle
So in IOS 7, we talked about
this a couple of times,

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:32.216 A:middle
but in IOS 7, we're
introducing Text Kit.

00:38:33.646 --> 00:38:37.156 A:middle
Text Kit is an Objective-C API.

00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:40.286 A:middle
It's inspired by the Cocoa
text system from OS X.

00:38:40.286 --> 00:38:43.116 A:middle
So if you've been using the
Cocoa text system on OS X,

00:38:43.116 --> 00:38:45.586 A:middle
a lot of the concepts
that we're going to talk

00:38:45.586 --> 00:38:47.206 A:middle
about here will be
very, very familiar,

00:38:47.206 --> 00:38:48.696 A:middle
and this wraps Core Text.

00:38:49.086 --> 00:38:53.136 A:middle
So this is our high level API
for our low level text system.

00:38:53.506 --> 00:38:55.866 A:middle
So let's talk about the
classes that are involved here.

00:38:56.336 --> 00:38:58.266 A:middle
This is just an application.

00:38:58.726 --> 00:39:01.036 A:middle
It's got a UITextView in it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.726 --> 00:39:01.036 A:middle
It's got a UITextView in it.

00:39:01.336 --> 00:39:04.046 A:middle
That UITextView has
an NSTextContainer.

00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:09.036 A:middle
And NSTextContainer is
the largest component

00:39:09.086 --> 00:39:10.506 A:middle
of the text system for layout.

00:39:10.506 --> 00:39:13.846 A:middle
And then we get an
NSLayoutManager.

00:39:13.846 --> 00:39:16.216 A:middle
And the Layout Manager is the
thing that's actually in charge

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:17.866 A:middle
of doing all of the
drawing and the bits.

00:39:17.866 --> 00:39:23.696 A:middle
And an NSTextStorage is the
actual NSString that's backing

00:39:23.696 --> 00:39:25.206 A:middle
all of this, right.

00:39:26.106 --> 00:39:28.026 A:middle
And one of the great things
about Text Kit and one

00:39:28.026 --> 00:39:31.126 A:middle
of the fantastic things about
way this to setup is if you want

00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:34.156 A:middle
to participate at any level
of this, you don't have

00:39:34.156 --> 00:39:35.796 A:middle
to subclass the whole stack.

00:39:37.066 --> 00:39:39.806 A:middle
You just subclass an
NSLayoutManager if you want

00:39:39.806 --> 00:39:43.536 A:middle
to change the way maybe glyphs
render, or a TextContainer

00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:45.836 A:middle
if you'd like to change the
way text flows or wraps.

00:39:46.306 --> 00:39:49.596 A:middle
Or if you need to be able to
manage your own specific kind

00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:52.346 A:middle
of text storage that isn't
just a straight array

00:39:52.346 --> 00:39:55.206 A:middle
of Unicode characters, you can
subclass that as TextStorage

00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:58.286 A:middle
and you can participate at
any level of this hierarchy.

00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:01.716 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about
TextView and TextContainer.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:01.716 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about
TextView and TextContainer.

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:04.306 A:middle
An initWithFrame textContainer
is the new designated

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:06.696 A:middle
initializer on UITextView, OK.

00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:08.836 A:middle
So if you specify a
nil TextContainer,

00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:11.146 A:middle
you'll get the default
that UIKit uses.

00:40:11.536 --> 00:40:14.196 A:middle
You can also find out what
that TextContainer is.

00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:17.436 A:middle
And as a convenience,
the layoutManager

00:40:17.436 --> 00:40:20.286 A:middle
and textStorage methods
are call-throughs

00:40:20.286 --> 00:40:22.976 A:middle
to the TextContainer
from UITextView.

00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:25.786 A:middle
We're just piping those through
to make it a little easier

00:40:25.786 --> 00:40:26.286 A:middle
to get to.

00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:30.976 A:middle
So, all you have to do
here is if you're going

00:40:30.976 --> 00:40:33.206 A:middle
to change your TextContainer,
call that.

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:37.706 A:middle
TextContainers get initialized
with a size, so they get setup

00:40:37.706 --> 00:40:40.486 A:middle
with a specific size
for the frame

00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:41.706 A:middle
that they're being laid out in.

00:40:42.516 --> 00:40:44.426 A:middle
And they also have
a LayoutManager.

00:40:44.426 --> 00:40:45.036 A:middle
So if you're going to--

00:40:45.036 --> 00:40:47.426 A:middle
if you're going to
subclass LayoutManager,

00:40:47.426 --> 00:40:48.826 A:middle
you can provide your
own subclass.

00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:51.276 A:middle
If you don't provide one here,
again, you get our default,

00:40:51.276 --> 00:40:53.096 A:middle
so you get the default behavior
all the way down the stack.

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:56.286 A:middle
You can also change
the lineBreakMode

00:40:56.286 --> 00:40:57.506 A:middle
and lineFragmentPadding.

00:40:58.116 --> 00:41:00.216 A:middle
So things that you've never
really had a lot of control

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.116 --> 00:41:00.216 A:middle
So things that you've never
really had a lot of control

00:41:00.216 --> 00:41:02.956 A:middle
over before, where things
break, how they break

00:41:02.956 --> 00:41:06.046 A:middle
with the default break modes
and the fragment padding

00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:09.146 A:middle
for how things get split out.

00:41:09.426 --> 00:41:12.706 A:middle
lineFragmentRectForProposedRect
atIndex writingDirection

00:41:12.706 --> 00:41:16.026 A:middle
remainingRect, there are a lot
more methods on TextContainer,

00:41:16.026 --> 00:41:18.286 A:middle
and these are just
a few of them.

00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:20.306 A:middle
But this is the kind
of control you get.

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:24.306 A:middle
Given a specific rectangle at
an index and a character index

00:41:24.306 --> 00:41:26.126 A:middle
of your Text Screen
will tell you what the

00:41:26.126 --> 00:41:29.446 A:middle
baseWritingDirection is,
you'll fill in a remainingRect,

00:41:29.446 --> 00:41:32.356 A:middle
in return, a rectangle for that.

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:34.756 A:middle
So if you want to change
where this stuff lays out,

00:41:34.756 --> 00:41:36.126 A:middle
this is one place to do it.

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:36.456 A:middle
So you're going

00:41:36.456 --> 00:41:39.786 A:middle
to get exceptionally fine
during control over where all

00:41:39.786 --> 00:41:41.296 A:middle
of the glyphs wind up.

00:41:42.206 --> 00:41:43.486 A:middle
One of the most-- one

00:41:43.486 --> 00:41:46.896 A:middle
of the coolest things we've
done is exclusionPaths.

00:41:47.436 --> 00:41:52.586 A:middle
So, if you're doing a picture,
for instance, of the flowers

00:41:52.586 --> 00:41:54.156 A:middle
that you saw in the
previous presentation,

00:41:54.156 --> 00:41:55.896 A:middle
it's got an irregular
path around it,

00:41:56.496 --> 00:41:59.506 A:middle
that would've involved a lot of
work to be able to try to figure

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.946 A:middle
out where is the bitmap,
where are the places

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.946 A:middle
out where is the bitmap,
where are the places

00:42:01.946 --> 00:42:02.946 A:middle
that it's overlapping.

00:42:03.416 --> 00:42:04.916 A:middle
With exclusionPaths,
all you have

00:42:04.946 --> 00:42:06.976 A:middle
to do is provide
us a UIBezierPath.

00:42:07.856 --> 00:42:09.696 A:middle
The text will automatically
flow around that path.

00:42:09.696 --> 00:42:12.606 A:middle
And as you change it, we'll
re-layout it automatically.

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:17.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:17.646 --> 00:42:18.656 A:middle
It's a lot simpler.

00:42:19.886 --> 00:42:24.556 A:middle
LayoutManager has a bunch
of different global options,

00:42:24.556 --> 00:42:26.036 A:middle
things like
showsInvisibleCharacters,

00:42:26.036 --> 00:42:27.226 A:middle
showsControlCharacters,

00:42:27.226 --> 00:42:31.066 A:middle
the hyphenationFactor you can
tweak how aggressively words are

00:42:31.066 --> 00:42:34.596 A:middle
hyphenated, usesFontLeading,
whether reusing the leading

00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:36.136 A:middle
from the font system
or something else,

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:39.686 A:middle
and allowsNonContiguousLayout
and hasNonContiguousLayout.

00:42:39.686 --> 00:42:43.606 A:middle
So, if you've invalidated
a section of the text,

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:46.296 A:middle
we don't have to re-layout
the entire [inaudible] one

00:42:46.716 --> 00:42:50.916 A:middle
to be able to redisplay
the text.

00:42:51.296 --> 00:42:53.886 A:middle
So NonContiguousLayout
is a great performance

00:42:53.886 --> 00:42:55.646 A:middle
when especially on
embedded devices.

00:42:55.726 --> 00:42:57.456 A:middle
And this concept
is almost directly

00:42:57.456 --> 00:42:59.386 A:middle
from the OS X text system.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:02.366 A:middle
If you have NonContiguousLayout,
you can find

00:43:02.366 --> 00:43:03.736 A:middle
out from the LayoutManager here.

00:43:05.026 --> 00:43:06.216 A:middle
What does LayoutManager do?

00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:10.556 A:middle
LayoutManager is really the
workhorse of the text system.

00:43:10.556 --> 00:43:13.636 A:middle
So a lot of the features
involve things like invalidation

00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:16.396 A:middle
and there are probably 15
or 20 invalidation methods.

00:43:16.646 --> 00:43:17.336 A:middle
One of them is something

00:43:17.336 --> 00:43:19.406 A:middle
like invalidateLayout
ForCharacterRange

00:43:19.446 --> 00:43:22.846 A:middle
actualCharacterRange, so
you'll be able to take portions

00:43:22.846 --> 00:43:25.806 A:middle
of the layout and invalidate
them yourself or find

00:43:25.806 --> 00:43:27.036 A:middle
out when they're invalidated.

00:43:27.716 --> 00:43:29.636 A:middle
Glyphs and glyph properties.

00:43:29.636 --> 00:43:32.306 A:middle
If you've ever wanted to
get involved with what winds

00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:35.676 A:middle
up on the screen in place of
something in your TextStorage,

00:43:36.986 --> 00:43:38.956 A:middle
this is one part of
LayoutManager's job.

00:43:38.986 --> 00:43:41.266 A:middle
You can find out many glyphs
are in the run, that's just,

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:43.066 A:middle
you know, what characters
are there.

00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:47.686 A:middle
glyphAtIndex and isValidIndex
tell me what glyph is being used

00:43:47.776 --> 00:43:49.576 A:middle
for the character at this index.

00:43:49.576 --> 00:43:51.466 A:middle
And then you can do things
like getGlyphsInRange

00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:53.446 A:middle
and you'll get a CGGlyph
back with properties,

00:43:53.446 --> 00:43:55.056 A:middle
characterIndexes and bidiLevels.

00:43:55.426 --> 00:43:58.536 A:middle
All of these things
help you decide what's

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:01.496 A:middle
in the LayoutManager as
well as what gets drawn.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:01.496 A:middle
in the LayoutManager as
well as what gets drawn.

00:44:02.466 --> 00:44:07.906 A:middle
So speaking of drawing, you'll
be able to actually get involved

00:44:07.906 --> 00:44:09.826 A:middle
with what hits the screen based

00:44:09.826 --> 00:44:11.906 A:middle
on the text runs you
have in your TextStorage.

00:44:12.586 --> 00:44:15.256 A:middle
So you can draw a background
for a glyph range at point,

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:16.636 A:middle
that's how you'll
be able to do things

00:44:16.966 --> 00:44:19.846 A:middle
like put your own
graphics behind things.

00:44:19.846 --> 00:44:21.626 A:middle
rawGlyphsForGlyphRange atPoint,

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:25.216 A:middle
if you want to put your own
CGGlyphs in place of a range

00:44:25.216 --> 00:44:26.906 A:middle
at a point, you'll
be able to do that.

00:44:26.906 --> 00:44:28.546 A:middle
So you've got complete control

00:44:28.906 --> 00:44:30.736 A:middle
over how text gets
rendered on the system.

00:44:31.466 --> 00:44:34.026 A:middle
drawUnderlineForGlyphRange
underlineType baseline--

00:44:35.446 --> 00:44:37.926 A:middle
all of these different styles,
what kinds of underlines,

00:44:37.926 --> 00:44:43.296 A:middle
what kinds of bold gets used,
all of that stuff is controlled

00:44:43.296 --> 00:44:45.296 A:middle
by the LayoutManager,
you have all

00:44:45.296 --> 00:44:46.706 A:middle
of these methods
available to you.

00:44:46.706 --> 00:44:52.276 A:middle
So there is a fantastic
control over text on iOS.

00:44:52.276 --> 00:44:54.676 A:middle
NSTextAttachment is
another class in Text Kit.

00:44:54.676 --> 00:44:56.176 A:middle
You'll be able to put pictures

00:44:56.176 --> 00:44:59.166 A:middle
and images inside the text
runs inside of UITextView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:01.876 --> 00:45:02.726 A:middle
Much easier, yeah.

00:45:04.216 --> 00:45:06.816 A:middle
So, we are very, very
serious about this.

00:45:06.846 --> 00:45:08.326 A:middle
This is an incredible
technology.

00:45:08.326 --> 00:45:11.736 A:middle
It's a fantastic opportunity
for you to really take control

00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:12.866 A:middle
of the typography in your app,

00:45:12.866 --> 00:45:14.726 A:middle
especially if you're
writing advanced text

00:45:14.726 --> 00:45:15.866 A:middle
processing applications.

00:45:16.256 --> 00:45:17.616 A:middle
We have three talks on this.

00:45:17.616 --> 00:45:20.896 A:middle
Introducing Text Kit,
come back after lunch,

00:45:20.896 --> 00:45:23.386 A:middle
after the lunch time
speaker, we'll we've talking

00:45:23.386 --> 00:45:26.216 A:middle
about it right here in
the Presidio tomorrow.

00:45:27.656 --> 00:45:30.606 A:middle
Advance Text Layouts and Effects
with Text Kit, that's going

00:45:30.606 --> 00:45:32.256 A:middle
to get into all of the bits,

00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:34.086 A:middle
things like all the
LayoutManager stuff,

00:45:34.136 --> 00:45:35.106 A:middle
where to overwrite things,

00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:37.676 A:middle
that's in Mission,
Thursday at 2:00.

00:45:37.676 --> 00:45:40.316 A:middle
And Using Fonts with Text Kit
right here in the Presidio,

00:45:40.316 --> 00:45:42.296 A:middle
Friday, bright and
early at 9:00 AM.

00:45:42.716 --> 00:45:44.726 A:middle
You'll find out how to
effectively use fonts

00:45:44.726 --> 00:45:46.316 A:middle
from your application
with Text Kit

00:45:46.316 --> 00:45:48.116 A:middle
and everything else
that that implies.

00:45:49.276 --> 00:45:52.156 A:middle
These are fantastic
technologies.

00:45:52.156 --> 00:45:55.516 A:middle
It's all stuff that we're using
in iOS all over the place.

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.696 A:middle
If you don't take
advantage of this,

00:45:57.886 --> 00:45:59.026 A:middle
I'm not sure what to tell you.

00:45:59.076 --> 00:46:00.826 A:middle
This is fantastic stuff.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.076 --> 00:46:00.826 A:middle
This is fantastic stuff.

00:46:01.456 --> 00:46:04.826 A:middle
We're not the only people
working on this stuff.

00:46:04.966 --> 00:46:08.926 A:middle
There are many, many, many
new features across a number

00:46:08.926 --> 00:46:11.006 A:middle
of different frameworks in iOS.

00:46:11.096 --> 00:46:14.776 A:middle
One of the more exciting
things, Multipeer Connectivity,

00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:20.386 A:middle
the Game Kit guys and the IMG
guys have been working very hard

00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:21.686 A:middle
at producing a new framework

00:46:21.776 --> 00:46:24.516 A:middle
for local network
connectivity involving things

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:26.396 A:middle
like session management,
who's involved,

00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:27.546 A:middle
who's joined a session,

00:46:27.776 --> 00:46:30.066 A:middle
and multiplexing data
across that session.

00:46:30.516 --> 00:46:33.866 A:middle
You'll be able to setup secure
sessions yourself as well

00:46:33.866 --> 00:46:35.446 A:middle
as file transfers
and things like that.

00:46:35.446 --> 00:46:38.456 A:middle
So, if you're writing something
that involves collaboration

00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:39.926 A:middle
or you're writing
a multiplayer game,

00:46:40.306 --> 00:46:41.876 A:middle
this will be a fantastic
talk to go

00:46:41.876 --> 00:46:43.986 A:middle
to in Mission, Wednesday
at 10:15.

00:46:44.876 --> 00:46:47.686 A:middle
If you are at the Platform
State of the Union,

00:46:47.686 --> 00:46:49.416 A:middle
you probably heard
about SpriteKits.

00:46:49.456 --> 00:46:52.136 A:middle
SpriteKit is a cross
platform, high performance,

00:46:52.136 --> 00:46:53.436 A:middle
sprite-based game framework.

00:46:54.336 --> 00:46:56.646 A:middle
So, this makes it
tremendously easy to be able

00:46:56.646 --> 00:46:58.756 A:middle
to write fantastic
iOS-based games,

00:46:59.226 --> 00:47:01.306 A:middle
Mac OS X-- OS X-based games.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.226 --> 00:47:01.306 A:middle
Mac OS X-- OS X-based games.

00:47:01.696 --> 00:47:04.406 A:middle
It has image atlas support
and really tight integration

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.476 A:middle
with UIKit and Appkit.

00:47:05.566 --> 00:47:07.916 A:middle
One of the things that these
guys did was to be able

00:47:07.916 --> 00:47:10.186 A:middle
to pipe UIGestureRecognizers
directly

00:47:10.186 --> 00:47:12.686 A:middle
into this entire
OpenGL-based rendering system.

00:47:12.686 --> 00:47:16.086 A:middle
So, you'll be able to do very
idiomatic UIKit-like things

00:47:16.686 --> 00:47:19.086 A:middle
with SpriteKit on iOS.

00:47:19.376 --> 00:47:22.386 A:middle
The game Controllers
framework, you'll be able

00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:24.106 A:middle
to pair arbitrary
Bluetooth game controllers

00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:25.476 A:middle
with your iOS device.

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:27.106 A:middle
So if you're doing
something with games

00:47:27.106 --> 00:47:28.156 A:middle
and you want those
shoulder buttons

00:47:28.156 --> 00:47:30.226 A:middle
and the analogue joysticks
and everything else to work,

00:47:30.486 --> 00:47:32.576 A:middle
you'll be able to find
out about all of that.

00:47:32.576 --> 00:47:34.486 A:middle
That's at the Integrating
with Game Controllers talk

00:47:34.486 --> 00:47:37.836 A:middle
in Pacific Heights
at Tuesday at 3:15.

00:47:39.246 --> 00:47:41.936 A:middle
MapKit, of course, they
have been very busy.

00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:43.856 A:middle
There's a new Directions
API that you'll be able

00:47:43.856 --> 00:47:46.596 A:middle
to take advantage of, 3D
cameras for your maps,

00:47:46.916 --> 00:47:49.386 A:middle
map tile overlays,
snapshots of your maps.

00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:50.876 A:middle
They're working with Geodesics.

00:47:50.876 --> 00:47:52.786 A:middle
You'll be able do all of
these things in your app

00:47:53.276 --> 00:47:57.466 A:middle
for what's new in MapKit
right here Thursday at 9:00.

00:47:57.736 --> 00:48:00.476 A:middle
CoreLocations adopted the new
Bluetooth LE beacons bits,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.736 --> 00:48:00.476 A:middle
CoreLocations adopted the new
Bluetooth LE beacons bits,

00:48:00.476 --> 00:48:02.526 A:middle
so you'll be able to take your
device and actually turn it

00:48:02.526 --> 00:48:05.186 A:middle
into a location-based
beacon where people can find

00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:07.256 A:middle
out how far away
those beacons are.

00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:09.986 A:middle
There are some new region
types or region monitoring

00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:12.706 A:middle
and more control over the region
monitoring you've had before.

00:48:13.176 --> 00:48:15.236 A:middle
What's new in CoreLocation,
of course,

00:48:15.616 --> 00:48:18.026 A:middle
in Presidio, Thursday at 11:30.

00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:20.746 A:middle
Accessibility is a
huge deal for us.

00:48:20.746 --> 00:48:22.996 A:middle
One of the things that
we are really proud

00:48:22.996 --> 00:48:26.526 A:middle
of is making our apps as
accessible as possible for users

00:48:26.526 --> 00:48:27.386 A:middle
who are differently abled.

00:48:28.076 --> 00:48:30.596 A:middle
There's new UI-- there's new
API to be able to participate

00:48:30.596 --> 00:48:31.866 A:middle
in the Guided Access system.

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.956 A:middle
So, Guided Access was a
feature introduced on iOS VI.

00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:38.636 A:middle
Now, your app can actually tell
the Guided Access system what's

00:48:38.636 --> 00:48:39.446 A:middle
available to it.

00:48:39.846 --> 00:48:43.396 A:middle
Accessibility in iOS in Pacific
Heights, Tuesday at 9:00.

00:48:43.396 --> 00:48:46.026 A:middle
If you're doing anything to
make your app more accessible,

00:48:46.026 --> 00:48:48.476 A:middle
please go this talk.

00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:51.226 A:middle
GamesCenter now also has
a new turn-based API,

00:48:51.786 --> 00:48:54.206 A:middle
so you'll be able to
better manage turns

00:48:54.206 --> 00:48:55.236 A:middle
in your application.

00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:57.136 A:middle
There's turns tabs,
modes for bidding.

00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:00.556 A:middle
New leaderboard improvements and
some system integrity features

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:00.556 A:middle
New leaderboard improvements and
some system integrity features

00:49:00.556 --> 00:49:02.046 A:middle
to make sure that
nobody is packing max

00:49:02.046 --> 00:49:03.866 A:middle
into your high score
fields anymore.

00:49:04.646 --> 00:49:09.406 A:middle
So What's New in Game Center
in Mission, Wednesday at 3:15.

00:49:10.316 --> 00:49:11.636 A:middle
There are many more talks

00:49:11.636 --> 00:49:13.546 A:middle
and many more a labs
than I can list here.

00:49:13.666 --> 00:49:16.506 A:middle
Please consult your
schedule for that.

00:49:16.506 --> 00:49:18.316 A:middle
If you have any questions
about the technologies

00:49:18.316 --> 00:49:20.676 A:middle
that we've talking about,
you know, John Geleynse

00:49:20.676 --> 00:49:22.936 A:middle
and his team here,
Jake Behrens is

00:49:22.936 --> 00:49:24.606 A:middle
of course the UI
Frameworks Evangelist,

00:49:24.606 --> 00:49:27.276 A:middle
still wearing plaid
every day this week.

00:49:28.376 --> 00:49:33.096 A:middle
And we also have, you know,
all of these fine people.

00:49:34.066 --> 00:49:35.966 A:middle
If you're interested in
games and things like that,

00:49:35.966 --> 00:49:37.566 A:middle
some of these people
are better to talk to.

00:49:37.936 --> 00:49:39.126 A:middle
So, thank you very much.

00:49:39.426 --> 00:49:41.826 A:middle
Come see us in the
labs, take advantage

00:49:41.826 --> 00:49:43.286 A:middle
for everything we've
been talking about.

00:49:43.776 --> 00:49:44.166 A:middle
Thank you.

00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:46.000 A:middle
[applause]
