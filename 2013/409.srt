[ Silence ]

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:11.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:16.256 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:20.606 A:middle
Wow. Thank you for coming
to Testing in Xcode 5.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.486 A:middle
I'm Mike and before
we get started,

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.536 A:middle
could I have everyone
raise your hand

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.506 A:middle
if you've ever written
a unit test before.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.646 A:middle
Wow. Actually, could
you keep your hand

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.826 A:middle
up if you've written a
unit test in Objective-C.

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:39.146 A:middle
Awesome. All right.

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:39.776 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:41.726 A:middle
What I'm here today
to show you is all

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.066 A:middle
of the great unit testing
features that we've added

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:48.176 A:middle
in Xcode 5 and show you how
easy it is to test your apps.

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:51.266 A:middle
So easy that I hope
by the end of today,

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.576 A:middle
we'll have absolutely
every hand raised.

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:59.926 A:middle
So, first, why would anyone
actually want to do testing?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:04.236 A:middle
Perhaps you've heard a few
times this week that we want

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:06.026 A:middle
to help you build better apps.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:08.986 A:middle
So first off, wouldn't
it be great

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.656 A:middle
if you could catch crashers
before your app got submitted

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:12.416 A:middle
into the app store?

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.796 A:middle
Did you know that crashers are
actually the number one cause

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:17.756 A:middle
of app rejection?

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:21.196 A:middle
Any crashers that make their way

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.336 A:middle
to your customers are
probably only going

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:24.426 A:middle
to lower your app's rating.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.466 A:middle
And if you can catch
your crasher in testing,

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.156 A:middle
it means you don't have
to re-submit your app.

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:33.536 A:middle
But besides crashers,
you'll also want

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.076 A:middle
to catch logical errors.

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:39.686 A:middle
Suppose, you have a game with
a character who's running along

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:43.376 A:middle
and picks up a health pack,
it'd be pretty embarrassing

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:46.766 A:middle
if picking up that
health pack actually ended

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.366 A:middle
up killing the character because
of some sort of integer overflow

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.846 A:middle
if the health was already
topped off at 100 percent.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:58.096 A:middle
Or, perhaps the pack was
poisoned or maybe the character,

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.256 A:middle
it was just getting greedy, but
either way you're going to want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.256 A:middle
it was just getting greedy, but
either way you're going to want

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.896 A:middle
to write a test to define
what the correct behavior is

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:04.436 A:middle
for your app.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:10.175 A:middle
So once you have a bank of
this test built up over time

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.996 A:middle
from release to release,
you'll find that these sorts

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:15.676 A:middle
of test will start
to catch regressions

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:17.866 A:middle
as the rules of your app change.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.976 A:middle
As your code evolves over time,
these sorts of test will begin

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.486 A:middle
to surface logical errors

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:28.556 A:middle
and sometimes just
find plain old bugs.

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:32.546 A:middle
Also, in some of the other
sessions, you may have been

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:35.606 A:middle
at earlier this week you
may have seen how to set

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:39.336 A:middle
up OS X server to run your
tests on a huge mix of OS

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:40.586 A:middle
and device configurations.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:44.736 A:middle
Many more configurations than
we could reasonably run by hand

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:47.036 A:middle
because we as developers want

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.156 A:middle
to actually spend time writing
features and not spend all

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:51.096 A:middle
of our time running tests.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:56.016 A:middle
And most importantly, for
every test that you commit

00:02:56.016 --> 00:03:00.036 A:middle
to your source repository,
OS X server can run that test

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.016 --> 00:03:00.036 A:middle
to your source repository,
OS X server can run that test

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:01.966 A:middle
when someone else on
your team commits.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.876 A:middle
Because, maybe the new guy
doesn't have the entire model

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:06.876 A:middle
of your app in his head yet,

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:10.176 A:middle
or perhaps he just forgot
some sort of subtle edge case.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.456 A:middle
I mean, who among us
hasn't actually introduced a

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:16.656 A:middle
jaw-dropping regression
that nobody picked up on

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:18.736 A:middle
until it was way too late
in the release cycle.

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:21.916 A:middle
So, all this is great, right?

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:24.696 A:middle
Well, let's see how we're
going to do all that.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:29.226 A:middle
So first, we're going to briefly
touch on what a unit test is.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.506 A:middle
Then I'm going to show you
the new testing framework

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.476 A:middle
that we've added to Xcode 5.

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:37.776 A:middle
And then we're going to cover
how you can create your first

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:40.236 A:middle
test and then for the
bulk of the session,

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.306 A:middle
we're going to show you some

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:43.476 A:middle
of the exciting new UI
enhancements we've added

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:47.826 A:middle
to Xcode 5 that will allow
you to run single tests just

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:51.076 A:middle
with one click or all your
tests in really large batches.

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.186 A:middle
Then we'll show you
how to debug your code

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:55.716 A:middle
when it's running
inside of the test rig.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
And, we'll show you
how testing fits

00:03:58.096 --> 00:04:00.876 A:middle
into the continuous integration
the OS X server provides.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.096 --> 00:04:00.876 A:middle
into the continuous integration
the OS X server provides.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:06.166 A:middle
And finally, we'll look at
some advanced configurations

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:08.516 A:middle
for OS X server and how
you can drive testing

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:09.206 A:middle
on the command line.

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:13.016 A:middle
So first, we should
define what we mean

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:14.546 A:middle
when we talk about unit tests.

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:19.856 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:26.076 A:middle
A unit test is a small test
of one unit of functionality.

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.796 A:middle
It either passes or it fails

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:31.556 A:middle
and the behavior should be
completely deterministic.

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
If you want to run
a lot of them,

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:36.976 A:middle
they should run pretty quick
because when they fail,

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.906 A:middle
you're going to want to
diagnose them really fast.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:43.316 A:middle
Though, unit testing
is not necessarily good

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:43.896 A:middle
for some things.

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:48.596 A:middle
For example, unit tests
are not performance tests,

00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:52.626 A:middle
a pass-fail result isn't going
to tell you how long it takes

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.716 A:middle
to run a benchmark or
the standard deviation

00:04:55.716 --> 00:05:00.036 A:middle
of that benchmark over time, or
the variation of that benchmark

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:55.716 --> 00:05:00.036 A:middle
of that benchmark over time, or
the variation of that benchmark

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
across different hardware.

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.566 A:middle
Also, UI testing is
pretty hard to do

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.896 A:middle
from a unit testing framework.

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:11.076 A:middle
There are a lot of complex
interactions in the UI

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:13.756 A:middle
and it's hard to
isolate down precisely

00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:15.346 A:middle
where a failure originates

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:18.056 A:middle
from when you're running
tests at such a high level.

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.996 A:middle
You're also going to want
screen recordings and a lot

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:23.766 A:middle
of other support you don't get
from a simple pass-fail result.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:29.216 A:middle
And this sort of speaks to a
greater point and that it's hard

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:34.846 A:middle
to understand failures that are
introduced by the integration

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:39.366 A:middle
of a complex system that isn't
already granularly unit-tested.

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:44.856 A:middle
You want to have the confidence
that the individual pieces

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:47.126 A:middle
of your application
are well-tested

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:51.236 A:middle
so that you can trust that your
higher level tests are actually

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:52.676 A:middle
reporting higher level failures.

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:55.046 A:middle
What this means is that
you're going to want

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:58.846 A:middle
to pick the right place
to start testing your app.

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.876 A:middle
So here, we have a high
level block diagram

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.876 A:middle
So here, we have a high
level block diagram

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:03.876 A:middle
of how your app might
be structured.

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:05.976 A:middle
You probably have
some sort of model,

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
view and controller classes
which are some pattern familiar

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:10.906 A:middle
to anyone who's been
working with Cocoa.

00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:15.776 A:middle
And you might have
some sort of connection

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.116 A:middle
to the network behind some sort

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:20.646 A:middle
of database that's behind
some sort of web service,

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:24.276 A:middle
but what we're really
focusing on today is

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:28.026 A:middle
where your model classes
meet your controller.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:33.576 A:middle
This is a good place to start to
build up tests because you want

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:36.936 A:middle
to know with certainty that your
model classes are well-tested

00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.116 A:middle
before you work your
way up to running test

00:06:39.116 --> 00:06:41.036 A:middle
for the controller
classes which start

00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:44.216 A:middle
to touch the other more
complex parts of your app.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.716 A:middle
Alternately, if you're a
framework or a library author,

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:52.256 A:middle
you could write tests around
the external API of your code

00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:54.446 A:middle
and work your way into
the internal classes.

00:06:55.366 --> 00:07:00.846 A:middle
It's really up to you, but
the new testing framework

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:55.366 --> 00:07:00.846 A:middle
It's really up to you, but
the new testing framework

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.926 A:middle
and UI features in
Xcode 5 are designed

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:09.756 A:middle
to make running model tests
really easy and really fast.

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
So, the Xcode unit testing
framework Xc test is brand new

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:19.546 A:middle
to Xcode 5 and iOS 7.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:23.576 A:middle
If you've used testing before
an Xcode, you may recognize

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:28.016 A:middle
that Xc test is actually
directly derived from OC unit.

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.966 A:middle
But it's been significantly
cleaned up and modernized.

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.386 A:middle
We even have a migration tool

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:39.766 A:middle
to migrate your existing
send tests to Xc test.

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:42.836 A:middle
Xcode builds your test
into an Xc test bundle

00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:47.046 A:middle
which is injected directly into
your application and invoked

00:07:47.286 --> 00:07:49.136 A:middle
after application
did finish launching.

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:55.646 A:middle
Or, when testing a library, the
test rig will load your library

00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:57.066 A:middle
and the test bundles together.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
So what does a test look like?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
So what does a test look like?

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:06.536 A:middle
Tests are just ordinary
Objective-C code.

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:13.856 A:middle
A test class is simply a
sub-class of Xc test case.

00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:18.176 A:middle
Tests are simply methods
inside of a test class.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:21.906 A:middle
These methods are
identified by the word test

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:24.506 A:middle
at the beginning of
their method name.

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:29.356 A:middle
And, test methods return
nothing and take no arguments.

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:33.546 A:middle
So how do you know if
a test passes or fails?

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:38.376 A:middle
Well, tests make assertions
in the bodies of their method.

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:43.486 A:middle
What this means is that you can
actually have multiple failures

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:46.496 A:middle
inside of a test because you
can make multiple assertions.

00:08:48.276 --> 00:08:50.136 A:middle
The test classes are discovered

00:08:50.136 --> 00:08:53.066 A:middle
by the test rig interrogating
the Objective-Code runtime

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:57.416 A:middle
and asking for all of the

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:00.686 A:middle
from the Xc test bundle
which has been injected

00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:01.516 A:middle
into your application.

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:04.506 A:middle
So, these are the basics

00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:07.216 A:middle
of how tests are
structured at the code level.

00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:11.366 A:middle
What I'd like to show you now is
the most significant UI feature

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:13.666 A:middle
that we've added to
Xcode 5 for testing.

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:17.676 A:middle
It will help you add, run, and
navigate all of your tests.

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:20.616 A:middle
This is the new test navigator.

00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:25.456 A:middle
As you can see here,
nestled between the issue

00:09:25.456 --> 00:09:27.956 A:middle
and the debug navigators
is where you'll find all

00:09:27.956 --> 00:09:29.156 A:middle
of your tests in your project.

00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:34.296 A:middle
When we started designing
Xcode 5 to make the act

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:37.386 A:middle
of testing your app a
first class experience,

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:41.776 A:middle
we quickly realized that
the workflow of being able

00:09:41.776 --> 00:09:44.636 A:middle
to view your tests
and their statuses was

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:45.656 A:middle
critically important.

00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:50.606 A:middle
At the top level of the
navigator, you'll see all

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:52.576 A:middle
of your test bundles
in your project.

00:09:53.366 --> 00:09:55.976 A:middle
Those test bundles
contain your test classes

00:09:56.576 --> 00:09:59.516 A:middle
which contain your test methods.

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.116 A:middle
We've also made it really
easy to run any test or group

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.116 A:middle
We've also made it really
easy to run any test or group

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
of tests with just one click.

00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:13.866 A:middle
As the tests run, the result
show up live along the side

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:17.326 A:middle
of the navigator, this gives
you a great top level overview

00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:19.916 A:middle
of what's passing and
failing and lets you drill

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:22.566 A:middle
down to any specific test.

00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:26.506 A:middle
Also, if you just want to focus
on only the failing tests,

00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:28.166 A:middle
we have a filter for that.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:33.586 A:middle
In this view, you can see
only the current failures

00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:35.546 A:middle
but still run all of your tests

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:37.586 A:middle
as you work your
way down to zero.

00:10:38.576 --> 00:10:41.966 A:middle
We think that the new navigator
will give you a very nice

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:43.046 A:middle
overview of your tests.

00:10:43.046 --> 00:10:44.806 A:middle
But we didn't stop there.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:50.506 A:middle
Next to each test method
in the source editor,

00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:52.786 A:middle
we added new test indicators.

00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:58.036 A:middle
You can click to run just
that test and see its status.

00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:01.746 A:middle
Running each test
is really easy even

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:01.746 A:middle
Running each test
is really easy even

00:11:01.746 --> 00:11:03.206 A:middle
without the test navigator open.

00:11:04.436 --> 00:11:06.216 A:middle
So let's look at each
of these features

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:08.976 A:middle
and how they work together
over on the demo machine.

00:11:09.516 --> 00:11:16.186 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:19.946 A:middle
So here, we have a project
that's a board game class

00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:26.836 A:middle
that has several classes which
represent the model of our game.

00:11:27.696 --> 00:11:32.486 A:middle
There are classes for how the
parts, the pieces on the board,

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:36.986 A:middle
the scoring and how the board
itself actually interacts.

00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:42.336 A:middle
So, one of the rules in a game
like this is that normally,

00:11:42.526 --> 00:11:45.426 A:middle
two pieces cannot occupy
the same space on the board

00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:48.326 A:middle
at the same time, but we've
actually noticed this has been

00:11:48.326 --> 00:11:49.786 A:middle
happening in our board class.

00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:53.446 A:middle
So let's try and write a test
to tease out this problem.

00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:57.146 A:middle
I can do that by going
to the test navigator.

00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:00.416 A:middle
As you noticed we have
no tests for our project,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:00.416 A:middle
As you noticed we have
no tests for our project,

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:06.076 A:middle
go down to the plus menu
and choose new test target.

00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:16.666 A:middle
What this will do is create a
new bundle inside of our project

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:19.316 A:middle
that is linked against
our application

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:24.526 A:middle
which contains the board
class that we want to test.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:27.706 A:middle
As you can see, the new test
bundle shows up right away

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:29.876 A:middle
and takes just a
moment for the indexer

00:12:29.926 --> 00:12:32.886 A:middle
to find the board class
and the test method.

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:36.066 A:middle
The test class and
the test method.

00:12:37.026 --> 00:12:39.376 A:middle
We can run the test just by
clicking on the indicator

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:41.116 A:middle
in the test navigator.

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:45.136 A:middle
And the test fails.

00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:48.606 A:middle
So we can find out why
by clicking on the test

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:51.796 A:middle
which will navigate us to that
test and the source editor.

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:56.016 A:middle
And as you can see here,
the test is unimplemented

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:59.076 A:middle
so by default it has a
built-in unconditional failure.

00:12:59.766 --> 00:13:07.496 A:middle
So, we created a code
snippet ahead of time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.766 --> 00:13:07.496 A:middle
So, we created a code
snippet ahead of time

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.136 A:middle
that has a pre-cooked test
for this demo which I'm going

00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:11.456 A:middle
to autocomplete into
place, so you don't have

00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:13.216 A:middle
to watch me type
this all at on stage.

00:13:14.436 --> 00:13:19.616 A:middle
This is test unit locations and
it's got a couple of imports

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:21.416 A:middle
that we need to put
here at the top.

00:13:22.496 --> 00:13:24.736 A:middle
There we go.

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:31.026 A:middle
So this test creates four model
objects in our game, the board,

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:35.346 A:middle
two pieces and one location to
try and move them both into.

00:13:36.526 --> 00:13:38.106 A:middle
This test makes four assertions.

00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:42.546 A:middle
First, it asserts that
moving the first piece

00:13:42.646 --> 00:13:44.746 A:middle
into the location on
the board succeeds

00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.826 A:middle
and then it actually
checks to see

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.446 A:middle
if the piece is at
that location.

00:13:49.906 --> 00:13:53.326 A:middle
Then, it tries to move a second
piece into the same location

00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:56.966 A:middle
on the board and asserts that
that move actually fails.

00:13:58.076 --> 00:14:01.446 A:middle
Then, we check to
see if the second--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.076 --> 00:14:01.446 A:middle
Then, we check to
see if the second--

00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:03.956 A:middle
if the first piece is
still on the board.

00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:06.856 A:middle
So let's run this
test by clicking

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:10.346 A:middle
on the test indicator next to
the method here on the editor.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:14.126 A:middle
Well, it looks like
our test is failing.

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:17.296 A:middle
We should probably take a
look at the move piece method

00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:20.736 A:middle
to see why it's not
working as we expect.

00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:22.966 A:middle
I'll do that just
by command-clicking

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:24.396 A:middle
on the move piece method.

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:29.086 A:middle
And it looks like there's--

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:34.916 A:middle
that the location to piece map
is always getting the piece

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:38.266 A:middle
slammed in and there's no point

00:14:38.266 --> 00:14:41.506 A:middle
where this method is actually
trying to reject a move

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.796 A:middle
to a location if there's
a piece already in place.

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:48.046 A:middle
So, we can fix this pretty
easily just by adding a check

00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:50.066 A:middle
to a location to
piece map to see

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:53.326 A:middle
if there is something that's
already in the location

00:14:54.116 --> 00:14:58.546 A:middle
and just return early with
a no to reject that move.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:06.356 A:middle
So, we can go back to the test
and rerun it with our change

00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:08.466 A:middle
in place and our test succeeds.

00:15:09.696 --> 00:15:13.256 A:middle
So, now our board class is
correctly rejecting moving a

00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:15.916 A:middle
piece into the same space
where another piece already is

00:15:16.856 --> 00:15:18.736 A:middle
and we'll go back to the slides.

00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:24.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:25.386 --> 00:15:26.336 A:middle
So, what did we just see?

00:15:27.616 --> 00:15:31.986 A:middle
We made our first Xc test
bundle in our project

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:34.596 A:middle
to test our board class inside

00:15:34.596 --> 00:15:36.596 A:middle
of our app using
the test navigator.

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:39.996 A:middle
Then we wrote our first test

00:15:40.086 --> 00:15:44.106 A:middle
and asserted what the correct
behavior was for the board

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:46.446 A:middle
and the piece classes and how
they were supposed to interact.

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:50.376 A:middle
Then we ran the test
which exposed the bug

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:54.186 A:middle
in our games model and once we
fixed up the implementation,

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:57.826 A:middle
we reran the test without
ever leaving the editor just

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.586 A:middle
by clicking on the
test indicator.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.586 A:middle
by clicking on the
test indicator.

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:04.066 A:middle
So now we have a test
that we can commit

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:07.866 A:middle
into our source repository and
be sure that any future changes

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:11.376 A:middle
to the board or piece classes
won't reintroduce the same bug

00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:12.716 A:middle
as long as that test gets run.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:15.516 A:middle
Pretty easy, start getting to--

00:16:15.566 --> 00:16:17.086 A:middle
easy to get started
with testing, right?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.726 A:middle
So let's take a closer
look at how Xc test works.

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:28.566 A:middle
So the whole point of a
test method is to assert

00:16:28.766 --> 00:16:30.136 A:middle
that certain assumptions
are met.

00:16:31.196 --> 00:16:33.306 A:middle
If you can think of a condition
that you might want to test,

00:16:33.986 --> 00:16:37.646 A:middle
Xc test's got an
assertion for that.

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:40.256 A:middle
We're just going to take a look

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:41.616 A:middle
at a couple of common
assertions.

00:16:42.646 --> 00:16:48.076 A:middle
For example, XCT assert equals
objects, takes two objects

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:49.626 A:middle
and the optional message.

00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:57.666 A:middle
It passes if the two objects is
equals methods actually agree

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:59.596 A:middle
that the two objects
are in fact the same.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:01.466 --> 00:17:04.195 A:middle
XCT assert not nil
is a favorite of mine

00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:07.036 A:middle
because it can catch
situations where you message nil

00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:10.465 A:middle
and it returns nil and
propagates that nil farther

00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:11.386 A:middle
than you might expect.

00:17:13.486 --> 00:17:15.496 A:middle
XCT assert true and false.

00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:17.796 A:middle
Both take a single
Boolean expression

00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:21.776 A:middle
and an optional message and do
basically what you would expect.

00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:30.286 A:middle
And XCT assert throws is really
good for testing your API

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:34.816 A:middle
to ensure that an exception
is thrown in situations

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:37.636 A:middle
where it's actually being
passed in valid parameters.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:43.526 A:middle
So let's take a look at a few
things that are good to assert.

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:46.496 A:middle
Most tests fall into
a few categories.

00:17:46.896 --> 00:17:49.146 A:middle
First, are expected successes.

00:17:50.326 --> 00:17:53.246 A:middle
These are situations where
your code is working basically

00:17:53.246 --> 00:17:55.006 A:middle
as designed.

00:17:55.006 --> 00:17:59.236 A:middle
An addition method takes 2 and
2 and returns 4, a character,

00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:02.576 A:middle
gets a health pack and health
is bumped up by 5 percent.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:02.576 A:middle
gets a health pack and health
is bumped up by 5 percent.

00:18:03.676 --> 00:18:07.346 A:middle
This may include EDGE Cases,
but this is still situations

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.006 A:middle
where your code is
doing the right thing

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:12.686 A:middle
by whatever definition it is
that you've defined it to be.

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:15.336 A:middle
Some people actually
write tests first

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:17.886 A:middle
which help them define
their implementation.

00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:21.816 A:middle
They'll take use cases
and express them as tests

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:25.726 A:middle
and they'll keep writing
their actual implementation

00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:29.466 A:middle
until they get all of
their tests to pass.

00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:34.106 A:middle
The second category are from
bugs that have been reported

00:18:34.106 --> 00:18:36.606 A:middle
by your users or have been
found in other testing

00:18:37.056 --> 00:18:39.576 A:middle
that you've distilled down
into making unit tests.

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:43.876 A:middle
These kinds of tests
grow over time and ensure

00:18:43.876 --> 00:18:46.556 A:middle
that you don't reintroduce
the same kinds of problems

00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:47.896 A:middle
with later code changes.

00:18:49.406 --> 00:18:51.976 A:middle
The third category is a
little less intuitive.

00:18:53.256 --> 00:18:56.656 A:middle
To fully cover your code,
you should consider cases

00:18:56.656 --> 00:18:58.766 A:middle
where your code is
actually expected

00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:03.776 A:middle
to fail however it emits errors,
how it might throw an exemption

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:03.776 A:middle
to fail however it emits errors,
how it might throw an exemption

00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:07.866 A:middle
if your addition method takes
2 billion plus 2 billion,

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:13.696 A:middle
it could result in overflow or
out of nowhere, a wild infinity

00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:16.696 A:middle
or not a number could appear as
a result of some calculation.

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:21.396 A:middle
It makes sense to
write a test to ensure

00:19:21.396 --> 00:19:22.946 A:middle
that an exception gets thrown

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:26.186 A:middle
or some other error is
surfaced for these cases.

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.476 A:middle
Sometimes with higher
level objects,

00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:31.996 A:middle
getting past nil is
totally unexpected

00:19:32.856 --> 00:19:36.486 A:middle
or you could be passing an
array which is shockingly empty.

00:19:37.756 --> 00:19:40.826 A:middle
The untyped collections in
Cocoa can be problematic

00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:43.666 A:middle
if you assume things like keys

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:45.436 A:middle
and dictionaries
and always strings.

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:48.936 A:middle
Or, you could get an NS
null value that could sneak

00:19:48.936 --> 00:19:51.796 A:middle
in as a side effect to
somebody observing through KVO.

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:56.076 A:middle
And finally, if your
code uses NS errors

00:19:56.486 --> 00:19:59.526 A:middle
or venns them throughout
parameters, you want to assert

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.706 A:middle
that those errors are actually
created with useful information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.706 A:middle
that those errors are actually
created with useful information

00:20:02.706 --> 00:20:06.436 A:middle
in them and that they're
handled in a sensible way.

00:20:08.136 --> 00:20:10.876 A:middle
So writing tests for
all of these sorts

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.976 A:middle
of situations will give your
code the most complete coverage.

00:20:15.876 --> 00:20:19.356 A:middle
So now, I'd like to back up and
take a look at what sort of set

00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:20.736 A:middle
up might be needed for each

00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:22.246 A:middle
of your test methods
before they're run.

00:20:22.246 --> 00:20:29.196 A:middle
The set up method is your
opportunity to run common bits

00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:31.526 A:middle
of code before each
of your test methods.

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:34.776 A:middle
If you find that you're
copying and pasting code

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.246 A:middle
from test method to test method,

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:38.506 A:middle
set up might actually
be a pretty good place

00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:39.636 A:middle
to centralize some of that.

00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:43.856 A:middle
You can set up shim objects
that might represent things

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:46.626 A:middle
like a server which would
not be appropriate to contact

00:20:47.056 --> 00:20:48.086 A:middle
in a testing environment.

00:20:48.936 --> 00:20:53.546 A:middle
You can also load
Plist, JSON, and XML data

00:20:53.956 --> 00:20:56.996 A:middle
from your Xc test
bundles resources just

00:20:56.996 --> 00:20:59.726 A:middle
by calling NS bundle,
bundle for class

00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:03.216 A:middle
and giving it a reference
to your test class.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:03.216 A:middle
and giving it a reference
to your test class.

00:21:03.856 --> 00:21:05.216 A:middle
Putting data and documents

00:21:05.686 --> 00:21:07.606 A:middle
into your test bundle
is a great place

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.806 A:middle
to store pathological used cases

00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:13.096 A:middle
that may have been
reported by as bugs.

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:16.286 A:middle
And finally, if you need to
undo anything that you did

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:18.746 A:middle
in your set up method,
tear down is there for you.

00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:23.576 A:middle
So let's see how
this works in action.

00:21:24.256 --> 00:21:29.096 A:middle
First, the test rig finds all
subclasses of Xc test case

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:33.006 A:middle
and starts iterating through
them in no particular order.

00:21:34.216 --> 00:21:38.946 A:middle
Then for this example, it finds
exempt-- the example tests class

00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:41.016 A:middle
and notices that there
are two methods in it.

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:45.986 A:middle
First, the set up method
for the class is run,

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:51.286 A:middle
then a new instance of
the test class is created

00:21:51.286 --> 00:21:52.746 A:middle
and set up as called on that.

00:21:53.756 --> 00:21:57.486 A:middle
Then your actual test
method itself is run

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:01.356 A:middle
which in this case
will pass and then tear

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:01.356 A:middle
which in this case
will pass and then tear

00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:02.776 A:middle
down is called on that instance.

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:06.316 A:middle
After that, another
instance is created

00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:08.676 A:middle
and setup is called on it.

00:22:08.816 --> 00:22:12.486 A:middle
Then the second test method gets
run which in this case will fail

00:22:12.486 --> 00:22:16.146 A:middle
and tear down gets called on
the instance then gets called

00:22:16.146 --> 00:22:19.656 A:middle
on the class and the test rig
moves on to the next class.

00:22:21.116 --> 00:22:23.826 A:middle
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:22:24.806 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
So, I'd like to take a
moment before another demo

00:22:29.886 --> 00:22:31.566 A:middle
to mention OC unit.

00:22:32.596 --> 00:22:36.406 A:middle
OC unit is Xcode's unit
testing framework or has been

00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:41.066 A:middle
since version 2.1 and that's--
you may already have some tests

00:22:41.066 --> 00:22:41.746 A:middle
that are written in it.

00:22:41.746 --> 00:22:44.946 A:middle
A lot of you actually have
tests that are written in it.

00:22:45.376 --> 00:22:48.356 A:middle
That's great and we don't want
to break any of your tests.

00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:54.056 A:middle
So we ensured that OC unit
and Xc unit could coexist side

00:22:54.056 --> 00:22:56.996 A:middle
by side as we make
more disruptive changes

00:22:56.996 --> 00:22:58.576 A:middle
to Xc test in the future.

00:22:59.706 --> 00:23:04.016 A:middle
Xcode 5 actually recognizes
all of the same test classes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.706 --> 00:23:04.016 A:middle
Xcode 5 actually recognizes
all of the same test classes

00:23:04.376 --> 00:23:07.576 A:middle
and will show you your classes
and your test methods inside

00:23:07.576 --> 00:23:10.956 A:middle
of the test navigator
as well as all

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:14.366 A:middle
of the editor indicators
in the side bar.

00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:18.526 A:middle
If you're-- if you want to
run your tests on iOS 6 and 7,

00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:25.246 A:middle
OC unit is actually the
right choice for you.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:29.556 A:middle
So-- but when you're
ready to adopt Xc unit,

00:23:29.856 --> 00:23:34.276 A:middle
Xc test we have an
option available under--

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:36.156 A:middle
to the run the migration tool

00:23:36.156 --> 00:23:39.186 A:middle
under the Edit menu
refactoring option

00:23:40.066 --> 00:23:44.266 A:middle
and then convert
to Xc test case.

00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:47.956 A:middle
So now that we've dove
into Xc test all the way

00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:48.896 A:middle
down to the code level.

00:23:49.506 --> 00:23:51.566 A:middle
I'm sure you're going to want
to see how to debug your tests.

00:23:52.826 --> 00:23:54.836 A:middle
We've added some
great new UI features

00:23:54.836 --> 00:23:57.966 A:middle
to Xcode 5 beyond just
the test navigator

00:23:57.996 --> 00:24:01.496 A:middle
and the editor indicators
to help you quickly run

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.996 --> 00:24:01.496 A:middle
and the editor indicators
to help you quickly run

00:24:01.496 --> 00:24:02.666 A:middle
and debug your tests

00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:05.096 A:middle
with a workflow I think
you're going to love.

00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:08.856 A:middle
So to show this to you in our
next demo, I'd like to turn it

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:11.226 A:middle
over to my friend and
colleague Bino George.

00:24:12.516 --> 00:24:18.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:19.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Mike.

00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:22.516 A:middle
This is the demonstration.

00:24:23.326 --> 00:24:27.626 A:middle
So this is a newer version of
the project that we saw earlier

00:24:27.626 --> 00:24:31.256 A:middle
and it has many more test that
covered the various EDGE Cases

00:24:31.916 --> 00:24:35.556 A:middle
for our board games
model classes.

00:24:35.896 --> 00:24:38.036 A:middle
Before we get started and I need

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:41.456 A:middle
to add a new break point
that's new in Xcode 5

00:24:42.156 --> 00:24:43.756 A:middle
which breaks on test failures.

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.036 A:middle
To do that I'm going
to switch the test--

00:24:47.036 --> 00:24:52.426 A:middle
to the breakpoint navigator
and I'm going to click

00:24:52.426 --> 00:25:01.066 A:middle
on the plus button and select
Add test failure breakpoint.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:52.426 --> 00:25:01.066 A:middle
on the plus button and select
Add test failure breakpoint.

00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:03.846 A:middle
So this special breakpoint stops
when a test assertion fails.

00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:06.326 A:middle
You'll probably want
to understand

00:25:06.326 --> 00:25:08.126 A:middle
when you're debugging your test.

00:25:08.746 --> 00:25:11.756 A:middle
It's helpful because it stops
the debugger right at the point

00:25:11.756 --> 00:25:14.196 A:middle
of the failure, at the
point of the test assertion

00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:19.216 A:middle
where you can inspect the live
objects that caused the failure.

00:25:20.556 --> 00:25:24.626 A:middle
So let's switch back to test
navigator and run all the test.

00:25:25.086 --> 00:25:29.506 A:middle
I can do that by clicking on
the one button for the bundle.

00:25:36.996 --> 00:25:39.886 A:middle
Huh, looks like there's
a failure.

00:25:40.866 --> 00:25:42.526 A:middle
Mike must have checked in
something before he went

00:25:42.526 --> 00:25:45.036 A:middle
on the stage that
broke one of my test.

00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:47.806 A:middle
It looks like they're
failing on and this--

00:25:47.806 --> 00:25:49.406 A:middle
it looks they're
failing on an assertion

00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:50.486 A:middle
for our rule checker class.

00:25:51.056 --> 00:25:54.306 A:middle
In the out of bounds move test,

00:25:55.346 --> 00:25:57.636 A:middle
it's creating an invalid
location and then trying

00:25:57.636 --> 00:25:58.856 A:middle
to move the piece there.

[ Pause ]

00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.686 A:middle
The debugger tool
tip was telling us

00:26:05.996 --> 00:26:08.696 A:middle
that the rule check is
actually allowing this.

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:13.776 A:middle
So now we know why the test is
actually failing but let's find

00:26:13.776 --> 00:26:14.836 A:middle
out why it's actually failing,

00:26:14.836 --> 00:26:16.326 A:middle
why the rule checker
is allowing this.

00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:21.836 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to add a
new manual breakpoint before the

00:26:21.836 --> 00:26:22.586 A:middle
test failure.

00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:28.406 A:middle
And then I can rerun
the test again.

00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:37.476 A:middle
Now, on the second run we hit
the manual breakpoint before the

00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:38.086 A:middle
actual failure.

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
So lets step into the
valid location method.

00:26:47.516 --> 00:26:51.276 A:middle
So the first thing it does is
actually check that the piece

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.536 A:middle
that you're moving is
actually already on the board

00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:55.976 A:middle
and to do it I just
find the old location.

00:26:56.716 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
I'm going to step
over it and it looks

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.716 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
I'm going to step
over it and it looks

00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:02.466 A:middle
like all location is not nil

00:27:02.466 --> 00:27:04.406 A:middle
so that means the piece
is already on the board.

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:09.166 A:middle
So the next thing it does
is it actually checks

00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:13.076 A:middle
that the location you're
moving to is actually

00:27:13.076 --> 00:27:14.136 A:middle
within the bounds of the board.

00:27:14.256 --> 00:27:19.366 A:middle
And that's exactly what our test
is actually doing in this test.

00:27:19.856 --> 00:27:21.886 A:middle
So let's see if that's the case.

00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:30.686 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:27:31.186 --> 00:27:35.066 A:middle
Clearly the rule check is
clearly wrong here and--

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:38.206 A:middle
no the logic is clearly
giving us the wrong result.

00:27:38.206 --> 00:27:44.476 A:middle
So the board's frame
is actually 0088

00:27:44.546 --> 00:27:46.106 A:middle
and the coordinate is actually--

00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:47.966 A:middle
the removing tool is
negative one, negative one

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.086 A:middle
which is clearly outside
of the bounds of the board.

00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:55.276 A:middle
The bug is probably in
this giant nest of code

00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:59.996 A:middle
and since we already
have the board's frame

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.036 A:middle
and the performance of
NSRect and the boards--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.036 A:middle
and the performance of
NSRect and the boards--

00:28:02.766 --> 00:28:05.226 A:middle
the location we were going to--
in the form of an NS point,

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:08.026 A:middle
I think there's a foundation
method that does this for us

00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:10.256 A:middle
and we can remove all those
bunch (inaudible) away.

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:15.746 A:middle
It's again it's called
NSPoint/NSRect.

00:28:17.346 --> 00:28:19.436 A:middle
It takes a point and NSRect.

00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:21.966 A:middle
So the point in this
case is new coordinate

00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:25.286 A:middle
and the rect is board frame.

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:28.966 A:middle
That's a lot simpler.

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:32.166 A:middle
So let's see if this actually--
if the test is passing now.

00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:39.756 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to
use a new test command

00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:41.426 A:middle
in the Product menu.

00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:47.826 A:middle
The test again command
is very powerful.

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:50.126 A:middle
It allows you to rebond the last
set of test that you're in over

00:28:50.126 --> 00:28:54.396 A:middle
and over again and it can help
you debug your test while you're

00:28:54.396 --> 00:28:57.866 A:middle
iterating over the test.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.536 A:middle
So in the Product menu
under Perform Action,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.536 A:middle
So in the Product menu
under Perform Action,

00:29:00.536 --> 00:29:01.826 A:middle
I'm going to select test again.

00:29:01.826 --> 00:29:07.446 A:middle
It looks like I hit
the manual breakpoint

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:08.346 A:middle
that we added earlier.

00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:15.106 A:middle
So I'm going to remove
that and continue.

00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:18.406 A:middle
Great, our test is
passing and the one checked

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:19.196 A:middle
in code is working now.

00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:23.486 A:middle
So now that we fixed this
test, I want to make sure

00:29:23.486 --> 00:29:25.926 A:middle
that we didn't break any
other test in my code.

00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:29.676 A:middle
So I want to find out
which other test are there

00:29:29.736 --> 00:29:30.436 A:middle
for this API.

00:29:31.406 --> 00:29:34.386 A:middle
To do this, I can use the--

00:29:34.386 --> 00:29:36.396 A:middle
a new assessment category
at the other Xcode 5.

00:29:36.396 --> 00:29:43.846 A:middle
So I'm going to switch
the assessment editor

00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:46.226 A:middle
and select Test Colors.

00:29:46.226 --> 00:29:51.656 A:middle
And I'm going to switch
to the primary editor back

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:56.246 A:middle
to the API review testing and
here is our first test method

00:29:56.246 --> 00:29:57.536 A:middle
that we already tested.

00:29:58.026 --> 00:30:00.746 A:middle
Let's see if there
are any other test.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.026 --> 00:30:00.746 A:middle
Let's see if there
are any other test.

00:30:02.106 --> 00:30:04.696 A:middle
There's another test called test
vertical move and let's switch

00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:07.926 A:middle
to that and run that
test as well.

00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:11.796 A:middle
Great, this test
is also passing.

00:30:12.616 --> 00:30:15.706 A:middle
So now let's make sure that
everything else is working

00:30:15.706 --> 00:30:17.626 A:middle
and to do that I'm going to
switch the test navigator.

00:30:17.626 --> 00:30:23.526 A:middle
It looks like we never
completely finished the full run

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:24.606 A:middle
of tests.

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:26.206 A:middle
So I can rerun all the tests

00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:28.826 A:middle
by using the Test
Menu on the product.

00:30:29.516 --> 00:30:36.376 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:38.946 A:middle
Great. Looks like
there are no failures

00:30:38.946 --> 00:30:42.626 A:middle
and we see green all the
way down to test navigator.

00:30:42.656 --> 00:30:44.236 A:middle
Everything looks great
on my local machine

00:30:44.236 --> 00:30:46.136 A:middle
and I should probably
check in this fix,

00:30:46.476 --> 00:30:48.436 A:middle
but for now let's switch
back to the slides.

00:30:49.516 --> 00:31:11.906 A:middle
[ Pause ]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:49.516 --> 00:31:11.906 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:13.806 A:middle
So we just saw a
lot in the demo.

00:31:13.806 --> 00:31:17.816 A:middle
There are three new Xcode 5 UI
features I'd like to call out.

00:31:18.956 --> 00:31:21.206 A:middle
The first is the test
failure breakpoint.

00:31:22.056 --> 00:31:25.576 A:middle
When we add it to our project
it stopped the test execution

00:31:25.576 --> 00:31:28.566 A:middle
in the debugger right
at the test failure.

00:31:29.056 --> 00:31:31.516 A:middle
So this allows us to
inspect the live objects

00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:35.266 A:middle
that cause test failure.

00:31:35.266 --> 00:31:37.636 A:middle
Second we saw that there are
new assistant categories.

00:31:39.056 --> 00:31:41.426 A:middle
We use a test color's
category in the demo

00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:43.416 A:middle
to find the second method

00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:46.536 A:middle
that was calling our test
a valid location API.

00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:50.326 A:middle
It works just like the
general colors category

00:31:50.486 --> 00:31:52.066 A:middle
but it focused just
on the test methods

00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:54.796 A:middle
that are calling the
method that you're editing

00:31:54.796 --> 00:31:55.596 A:middle
in the primary editor.

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:58.056 A:middle
Very tight, very
focused results.

00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:04.406 A:middle
The test pluses category we
didn't see it in the demo

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:04.406 A:middle
The test pluses category we
didn't see it in the demo

00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:07.366 A:middle
but it's a good way-- what it
does is it gives you a wider

00:32:07.396 --> 00:32:12.116 A:middle
range of classes that have test
methods in them that call the--

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:15.116 A:middle
that referenced the classes
you are editing in the primary.

00:32:16.526 --> 00:32:18.666 A:middle
It's a good way to step back
and see where you might want

00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:21.696 A:middle
to add new test especially for
new code that you're developing.

00:32:22.236 --> 00:32:28.396 A:middle
And third, we saw
the-- we use a test--

00:32:28.396 --> 00:32:32.396 A:middle
a new test command in the
product Perform Action menu.

00:32:32.916 --> 00:32:37.486 A:middle
The test again command
is incredibly powerful.

00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:41.336 A:middle
It allows you to rerun the last
set of test that you run over

00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:44.226 A:middle
and over again with
just one key stroke.

00:32:44.226 --> 00:32:49.116 A:middle
You can be in the middle
of editing any file

00:32:49.116 --> 00:32:51.326 A:middle
in your source editor
and would want it

00:32:51.326 --> 00:32:52.916 A:middle
and you can work the
Test Again command

00:32:52.976 --> 00:32:54.626 A:middle
and you get immediate results.

00:32:55.226 --> 00:32:57.396 A:middle
You will now just then
rather, changes you made

00:32:57.396 --> 00:32:59.766 A:middle
in the editor actually fix the
test that you're working on.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:03.246 A:middle
We think it's a really big deal
and it's one of those features

00:33:03.246 --> 00:33:06.126 A:middle
that you love once
you start using it.

00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:09.836 A:middle
So now that we've
shown you how to write

00:33:09.836 --> 00:33:11.796 A:middle
and debug test locally
inside test Xcode,

00:33:12.216 --> 00:33:15.436 A:middle
I'd like to shift gears and show
you how OS X server can save you

00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:17.456 A:middle
time and catch problems
by running all

00:33:17.456 --> 00:33:22.006 A:middle
of your tests all the time.

00:33:22.006 --> 00:33:24.266 A:middle
So earlier this week you
may have seen how to set

00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:27.596 A:middle
up OS X server, so we will
make something how to set

00:33:27.596 --> 00:33:28.796 A:middle
up OS X server in this session

00:33:28.796 --> 00:33:31.596 A:middle
but in the Continuous
Integration with Xcode 5 session

00:33:31.596 --> 00:33:35.346 A:middle
on Tuesday this was covered and
depth so you might want to refer

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:37.966 A:middle
to that for your-- when
you leave the session.

00:33:38.606 --> 00:33:41.916 A:middle
So after you set up the export
service, you can create a bot

00:33:42.046 --> 00:33:44.376 A:middle
to integrate your project.

00:33:44.376 --> 00:33:48.186 A:middle
Integration is the act of
checking out your code, building

00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:50.016 A:middle
and running your tests.

00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:53.816 A:middle
Integration can happen on
every commit, on every hour

00:33:53.816 --> 00:33:55.646 A:middle
or whatever interval
is right for your team.

00:33:56.516 --> 00:34:02.316 A:middle
[ Pause ]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[ Pause ]

00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:06.526 A:middle
So, you could have multiple bots
-- integrate all of the products

00:34:06.526 --> 00:34:09.076 A:middle
in your project, one
for your app NSTest,

00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:13.146 A:middle
one for your framework NSTest,
one for your library NSTest.

00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:14.266 A:middle
But there is a much
simplier way.

00:34:14.306 --> 00:34:19.196 A:middle
You can create a shared scheme

00:34:19.896 --> 00:34:22.096 A:middle
and this shared scheme
everything in your app,

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:25.065 A:middle
your app NSTest, your library
NSTest, they're all going

00:34:25.065 --> 00:34:25.956 A:middle
to this shared scheme.

00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:28.176 A:middle
All the test bundles for all

00:34:28.176 --> 00:34:32.176 A:middle
of the products you create
are going to the scheme

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:34.206 A:middle
which you can then edit
in the scheme sheet

00:34:34.206 --> 00:34:36.985 A:middle
or in the test navigator
directly

00:34:36.985 --> 00:34:40.186 A:middle
in the test navigator itself.

00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:42.116 A:middle
You will then check
in this sheet--

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:45.166 A:middle
this scheme into
source repository

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:50.166 A:middle
and then the bots can integrate
your project, the scheme.

00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:53.636 A:middle
Since the shared scheme,

00:34:53.636 --> 00:34:59.666 A:middle
everybody in your team can
also run the same scheme.

00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:01.546 A:middle
So once you've set up a bot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:01.546 A:middle
So once you've set up a bot

00:35:01.546 --> 00:35:04.656 A:middle
for your project any time
there's a new test failure

00:35:04.656 --> 00:35:07.646 A:middle
or new build issue will
bring that to you right away.

00:35:07.646 --> 00:35:10.606 A:middle
On the score board over
the next code itself right

00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:12.766 A:middle
into the activity
area where you can--

00:35:12.766 --> 00:35:17.366 A:middle
when you open that project.

00:35:17.466 --> 00:35:20.426 A:middle
So besides running all of your
test all the time for you,

00:35:20.736 --> 00:35:22.976 A:middle
there's an, you will now an
exciting reason why you want

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:25.716 A:middle
to have OS X server do your
continuous integration for you.

00:35:25.716 --> 00:35:30.276 A:middle
You can cover-- your test
will run on a wide variety

00:35:30.276 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
of configurations that
simply isn't possible to do

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:35.166 A:middle
on your laptop or
while you are sitting

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.756 A:middle
at your desktop,
sitting at your desk.

00:35:37.976 --> 00:35:43.116 A:middle
You can have many more
devices connected to the server

00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:46.416 A:middle
and the server will basically
run all of your test on any

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:48.766 A:middle
or all of these devices
for you automatically.

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:53.586 A:middle
This allows you to cover
a wide variety of hardware

00:35:53.586 --> 00:35:55.666 A:middle
and software configurations
automatically.

00:35:56.326 --> 00:36:01.526 A:middle
You can also run your test
on the simulator although

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.326 --> 00:36:01.526 A:middle
You can also run your test
on the simulator although

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:04.456 A:middle
in the current OS X server
seed that's not supported,

00:36:05.056 --> 00:36:08.286 A:middle
it's not available.

00:36:08.286 --> 00:36:11.126 A:middle
Between the simulator and the
devices connected to the server,

00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:13.666 A:middle
you can cut-- you can cover
a wide variety of hardware

00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:15.276 A:middle
and software cointegrations
automatically

00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:18.536 A:middle
and you can cover
all the OS versions

00:36:18.536 --> 00:36:19.376 A:middle
that you support as well.

00:36:20.076 --> 00:36:25.866 A:middle
If you're integrating an OS
X project, server will check

00:36:25.866 --> 00:36:29.966 A:middle
out your project, build
your app and NSTests

00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:33.086 A:middle
and run everything locally on
the server itself without having

00:36:33.086 --> 00:36:34.406 A:middle
to have a user logged
in graphically.

00:36:34.406 --> 00:36:38.616 A:middle
So to see this in action,
let's switch to a demo machine.

00:36:38.676 --> 00:36:45.496 A:middle
So this is the same
project that we saw earlier

00:36:45.496 --> 00:36:48.366 A:middle
that I just checked out
from my OS X server here.

00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:56.456 A:middle
This red indicator shows us
that there's a problem with one

00:36:56.456 --> 00:36:58.006 A:middle
of the boards that's
integrating this project.

00:36:58.006 --> 00:37:03.946 A:middle

Here we see all the

that we performed on--
that the board performed

00:37:27.426 --> 00:37:28.346 A:middle
for this project.

00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:33.516 A:middle
I can see all the test
failures as well, a few.

00:37:34.286 --> 00:37:35.946 A:middle
So we've had a run
of clean integrations

00:37:36.156 --> 00:37:38.166 A:middle
and everything was going
up until this point

00:37:38.636 --> 00:37:40.286 A:middle
but somebody broke one
of our tests just now.

00:37:44.856 --> 00:37:46.556 A:middle
So to find out which
test is failing,

00:37:46.556 --> 00:37:48.706 A:middle
let's click on the
integration test results.

So I have-- this is where you
can see all your tests and all

00:38:00.266 --> 00:38:01.996 A:middle
of the devices that are
connected to the server

00:38:02.036 --> 00:38:04.316 A:middle
and the results for all of the
test that ran on the server.

00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:08.016 A:middle
You can see various
configurations

00:38:08.336 --> 00:38:10.246 A:middle
like I have an iPad mini here

00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:12.926 A:middle
and an iPhone running
iOS 6-- iOS 7.

00:38:12.926 --> 00:38:16.296 A:middle
I only have two devices here

00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:21.036 A:middle
but you could have many more
devices connected to the server.

00:38:21.036 --> 00:38:24.316 A:middle
The first device I have is an
iPad mini and its running iOS 6,

00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:27.476 A:middle
the second device I have
is an iPhone running iOS 7.

00:38:27.476 --> 00:38:32.626 A:middle
So we can look at the failing
test, the code of failing test

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:35.196 A:middle
by clicking on the
red test indicator.

00:38:35.826 --> 00:38:42.506 A:middle
So this is a test that
basically parses high score data

00:38:42.506 --> 00:38:43.356 A:middle
from our server.

00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:46.656 A:middle
In this test we fake the
data because we don't--

00:38:46.656 --> 00:38:48.746 A:middle
this is a unit test and we
want it to be really fast.

00:38:49.706 --> 00:38:51.366 A:middle
We also want the test
to work in isolation

00:38:51.366 --> 00:38:53.586 A:middle
so that it's not relying
on any data from the server

00:38:53.586 --> 00:38:54.786 A:middle
that could change
from one to one.

00:38:54.786 --> 00:39:00.196 A:middle
So what could have gone wrong?

So what could have gone wrong?

00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:02.766 A:middle
Perhaps integration
summary could help us out.

00:39:03.086 --> 00:39:05.276 A:middle
So let's go back to
integration summary.

00:39:05.486 --> 00:39:09.676 A:middle
So the integration
details tell us

00:39:09.676 --> 00:39:12.246 A:middle
that we are calling an
unrecognized selector called

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:13.756 A:middle
scan on-sign long, long.

00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:19.956 A:middle
This is really weird because we
didn't have any build failures.

00:39:20.876 --> 00:39:22.006 A:middle
So let's switch back
to the code and see

00:39:22.006 --> 00:39:22.966 A:middle
where we're actually using it.

00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:33.396 A:middle
I don't see it here,
it's quite small.

00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:36.276 A:middle
Maybe we are using again
the high scores class.

00:39:36.766 --> 00:39:39.226 A:middle
So let's command-click on
it and see if we're using it

00:39:39.226 --> 00:39:40.086 A:middle
in the high scores class.

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:48.526 A:middle
It's quite a big file so I'm
going to search for it in here.

00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:50.276 A:middle
There it is.

00:39:50.486 --> 00:39:51.866 A:middle
So how could this fail on an--

00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:54.016 A:middle
on the iPad but not
on the iPhone?

00:39:55.086 --> 00:39:59.406 A:middle
Perhaps there's a
difference in the OS versions?

00:39:59.766 --> 00:40:01.786 A:middle
So let's look at the header
for this method to find

00:39:59.766 --> 00:40:01.786 A:middle
So let's look at the header
for this method to find

00:40:01.786 --> 00:40:02.856 A:middle
out when it was introduced.

00:40:03.576 --> 00:40:09.136 A:middle
I can do that by
command-clicking on the method.

00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:16.866 A:middle
So this method was newly
introduced in iOS 7.

00:40:16.866 --> 00:40:20.296 A:middle
So we're running an iOS 7 API,
we're calling an iOS 7 API

00:40:20.296 --> 00:40:22.146 A:middle
on a device that's
running iOS 6.

00:40:22.146 --> 00:40:23.786 A:middle
This is not going to work.

00:40:23.786 --> 00:40:27.996 A:middle
No wonder it's failing.

00:40:27.996 --> 00:40:30.866 A:middle
So right about that, I
see another method called

00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:32.106 A:middle
which scans the sign numbers.

00:40:32.866 --> 00:40:35.756 A:middle
So we could probably use this

00:40:35.756 --> 00:40:40.676 A:middle
because it's exists iOS
6 and I think it'll do.

00:40:41.536 --> 00:40:44.046 A:middle
It just means that the highest
score can only be 9 quintillion

00:40:44.046 --> 00:40:47.386 A:middle
instead of 18 quintillion,
I guess that will work.

00:40:49.096 --> 00:40:52.906 A:middle
So let's switch back to the
code and fix it-- fix the AP--

00:40:52.986 --> 00:40:55.906 A:middle
fix our code to use the
new AP-- the older API.

During that I am going to
switch to Test Navigator

Xcode sends integration

from the source repository into
a temporary build location.

it calls your test

and it got-- runs your test.

00:43:15.396 --> 00:43:18.846 A:middle
Once the last test is
finished on the last device,

00:43:19.656 --> 00:43:22.756 A:middle
basically server collects
all of the data for all

00:43:22.756 --> 00:43:26.366 A:middle
of the test results from

So, what did Bino just show us?

00:44:23.506 --> 00:44:28.826 A:middle
Well, first to set up the bot,
you need to add your tests

00:44:29.506 --> 00:44:31.736 A:middle
to a shared scheme and commit

00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:33.656 A:middle
that into your source
repository.

00:44:35.276 --> 00:44:40.456 A:middle
In the demo, we showed-- we
saw how OS X server can run all

00:44:40.456 --> 00:44:44.946 A:middle
of your tests on a variety of
devices and configurations.

00:44:46.736 --> 00:44:52.336 A:middle
Then, Bino showed us the bot and
test summary results in Xcode 5

00:44:52.476 --> 00:44:55.106 A:middle
and how you can use
it to find failures

00:44:55.586 --> 00:44:59.296 A:middle
that are not necessarily
reproducing in the IDE.

00:44:59.466 --> 00:45:02.256 A:middle

Now, all of this is great
if you can start fresh

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:05.086 A:middle
with a brand new OS X
server and set that up

00:45:05.086 --> 00:45:06.896 A:middle
as your continuous
integration environment.

00:45:07.436 --> 00:45:10.846 A:middle
But what if you already
have one?

00:45:11.986 --> 00:45:15.106 A:middle
Through all the new features
that we've added to Xcode 5

00:45:15.106 --> 00:45:16.926 A:middle
for testing, we haven't
forgotten

00:45:16.926 --> 00:45:17.766 A:middle
about the command line.

00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:19.946 A:middle
This is your opportunity

00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:24.146 A:middle
for your existing continuous
integration system to hook in.

00:45:24.146 --> 00:45:27.906 A:middle
The Xcode build command
line tool can drive testing

00:45:28.206 --> 00:45:31.006 A:middle
in exactly the same
way as the Xcode IDE

00:45:31.356 --> 00:45:33.946 A:middle
or the Xcode service
inside Xcode server.

00:45:34.756 --> 00:45:37.976 A:middle
The only mandatory argument
is the shared scheme.

00:45:40.006 --> 00:45:42.376 A:middle
You can also specify
different destinations

00:45:42.566 --> 00:45:44.346 A:middle
that you want the
integration performed to.

00:45:44.866 --> 00:45:50.506 A:middle
For example, My Mac 64, or
if you have devices plugged

00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:53.236 A:middle
in to the server, you
can call them now by name

00:45:53.526 --> 00:45:54.726 A:middle
and their device identifier.

00:45:55.326 --> 00:45:59.196 A:middle
You can also use a simulator

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:00.446 --> 00:46:03.546 A:middle
to target all the
different device form factors

00:46:04.076 --> 00:46:07.786 A:middle
and OS combinations that
that simulator supports.

00:46:08.316 --> 00:46:11.616 A:middle
Best of all, you can chain all

00:46:11.616 --> 00:46:13.446 A:middle
of these destination
arguments together

00:46:13.446 --> 00:46:16.736 A:middle
and an integration we
performed across all of them.

00:46:18.126 --> 00:46:21.476 A:middle
If there are any issues that
came up in either the building

00:46:21.476 --> 00:46:23.336 A:middle
or the actual tests themselves,

00:46:23.816 --> 00:46:27.266 A:middle
Xcode build will return a
non-zero exit code and this is

00:46:27.266 --> 00:46:29.086 A:middle
where your automation
can pick up on that

00:46:29.936 --> 00:46:32.916 A:middle
and store off the
transcript of the log for you

00:46:32.916 --> 00:46:34.366 A:middle
to investigate the
failure later.

00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:38.906 A:middle
So, we think this is really
easy for command line tool

00:46:39.746 --> 00:46:44.616 A:middle
and that is the last thing I
have to show that's new today.

00:46:44.816 --> 00:46:52.316 A:middle
So, to recap, today we covered
what a unit test is in general

00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:54.286 A:middle
and how they test
just one thing.

00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:57.836 A:middle
And how to quickly
write those tests

00:46:58.156 --> 00:47:00.156 A:middle
in Objective-C using Xc test.

00:47:01.906 --> 00:47:04.356 A:middle
In the demo, we showed
just how easy it was

00:47:04.356 --> 00:47:07.896 A:middle
to start getting writing-- get
started writing your unit tests

00:47:09.036 --> 00:47:12.346 A:middle
and how to run them quickly
in the test navigator

00:47:12.346 --> 00:47:15.416 A:middle
and using the test indicators
in the source editor.

00:47:16.006 --> 00:47:22.636 A:middle
Then, Bino showed us how to
use the test failure breakpoint

00:47:23.116 --> 00:47:25.256 A:middle
to step through your
code at the moment

00:47:25.556 --> 00:47:27.536 A:middle
that a test assertion failed.

00:47:29.386 --> 00:47:33.606 A:middle
Then, he also showed us how to
use the new assistant categories

00:47:33.606 --> 00:47:36.796 A:middle
to find other tests that might
be calling the implementation

00:47:36.796 --> 00:47:39.056 A:middle
that you're working on
in the primary editor.

00:47:40.696 --> 00:47:44.176 A:middle
Then, he also showed us how the
Test Again command can quickly

00:47:44.176 --> 00:47:47.346 A:middle
help you rerun the same test
over and over and over again

00:47:47.816 --> 00:47:49.716 A:middle
as your iterating on
the implementation

00:47:50.216 --> 00:47:53.966 A:middle
without even having the test
navigator or to test itself up.

00:47:54.156 --> 00:47:58.476 A:middle
In the demo, he showed us
how to run a wide variety

00:47:58.536 --> 00:48:01.596 A:middle
of configurations
on different devices

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:58.536 --> 00:48:01.596 A:middle
of configurations
on different devices

00:48:02.026 --> 00:48:05.286 A:middle
and how you can run all those
configurations all the time

00:48:06.136 --> 00:48:08.956 A:middle
and then finally we
covered just now how

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:13.036 A:middle
to drive the same integrations
at the command line.

00:48:14.656 --> 00:48:18.286 A:middle
So throughout the three demos
today, we showed three bugs

00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:20.486 A:middle
that could've been
potential show stoppers

00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:21.606 A:middle
for any application.

00:48:22.796 --> 00:48:25.946 A:middle
The first, being a pure logic
bug where the two pieces

00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:29.866 A:middle
on our board collided,
the second was a case

00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:31.656 A:middle
of overly complicated
balance check

00:48:31.656 --> 00:48:34.496 A:middle
in that could've been replaced
by a simple library function.

00:48:35.666 --> 00:48:40.476 A:middle
And the third was the case
of using a two new API

00:48:41.136 --> 00:48:43.076 A:middle
when deploying on to
an older OS version.

00:48:44.366 --> 00:48:47.346 A:middle
What I hope that you've seen
today is how testing can catch

00:48:47.346 --> 00:48:50.596 A:middle
these kinds of bugs in your
app and just how easy it is

00:48:50.596 --> 00:48:53.756 A:middle
to start the testing right
now if you haven't already.

00:48:56.856 --> 00:49:00.056 A:middle
So, if you have any
questions or feedback,

00:48:56.856 --> 00:49:00.056 A:middle
So, if you have any
questions or feedback,

00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:02.226 A:middle
please let our evangelist
Dave know.

00:49:02.226 --> 00:49:04.076 A:middle
Here are the links

00:49:04.076 --> 00:49:06.386 A:middle
to the documentation
and developer forums.

00:49:07.566 --> 00:49:10.446 A:middle
To learn more about
OS X's server--

00:49:11.026 --> 00:49:14.826 A:middle
learn more about OS X server and
the Xcode service, please check

00:49:14.826 --> 00:49:16.586 A:middle
out the Continuous Integration

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.656 A:middle
with Xcode 5 session
that was on Tuesday.

00:49:19.326 --> 00:49:21.506 A:middle
The video is available
right now from the wwcf

00:49:21.506 --> 00:49:22.866 A:middle
that you have in your pocket.

00:49:24.706 --> 00:49:26.486 A:middle
And with that, I'd
like to say thank you.

00:49:27.516 --> 00:49:33.800 A:middle
