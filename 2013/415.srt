[ Applause ]

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:17.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.866 A:middle
And welcome to session 415,

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.826 A:middle
Maximizing Apple
Development Resources.

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.946 A:middle
My name is Nahir Khan and
I'm an iOS Software Engineer

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:25.716 A:middle
on Springboard.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:31.056 A:middle
So today, we're going to go
over all the different types,

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:33.226 A:middle
development resources
the Apple provides to.

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.486 A:middle
And we're going to
break them up into

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:37.436 A:middle
about three main categories.

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:40.736 A:middle
First one, is Self Help and
this is where we are going

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.896 A:middle
to cover Documentation
and Dev Forums.

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:45.996 A:middle
The second, once you've gone

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:48.396 A:middle
through those is
working with Apple.

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.796 A:middle
And with that we're
going into Bug Reporting

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
and Developer Technical
Support or DTS for short.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:57.526 A:middle
Finally, once you've got
your app all ready to go,

00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.836 A:middle
we're talking about getting
your app in the App Store

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:01.706 A:middle
and over here we're
going to talk

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:05.236 A:middle
about App Store and
iTunes Connect.

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:07.586 A:middle
So that, let's start.

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.196 A:middle
So the first main
category is Self Help.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:12.926 A:middle
So the really nice thing

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.176 A:middle
about these resources is they
can access them 24 hours a day,

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:17.856 A:middle
seven days a week.

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:22.366 A:middle
And they're going to get let
you work at your own pace

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.126 A:middle
and get all the information
that you need without having

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.826 A:middle
to come here or somewhere
else, it's really nice.

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.166 A:middle
So first one we're going to
go over is documentation.

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:35.106 A:middle
So I'm sure you guys
are very familiar

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:37.956 A:middle
with this site,
developer.apple.com.

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:41.156 A:middle
So this is the first place that
you should go when you start off

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.466 A:middle
and you learn a new
API, the item we came

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:47.026 A:middle
up with say this week or
is it the new API to you

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:48.066 A:middle
that we've had for some time.

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:51.676 A:middle
First thing you should almost
always do and check out our WWDC

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.416 A:middle
and Tech Talk videos 'cause they
give you a nice broad overview

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.936 A:middle
of our APIs and designs
and brand new features.

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:02.416 A:middle
Once you've done that,
the next best thing

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:02.416 A:middle
Once you've done that,
the next best thing

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.466 A:middle
that you can do is go into--

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.526 A:middle
and take a look at all the
documentation we have here.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
We got lot of getting started
guidelines, so if you just want

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:15.366 A:middle
to get in, try to figure out a
broad overview what's going on,

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.496 A:middle
this is exactly where
you can go.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.526 A:middle
We also have our entire
development library here,

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.986 A:middle
so if you want to
figure out how some API

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:27.486 A:middle
or certain classes work, this
is also where you should go.

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:30.486 A:middle
Lastly, you can also download
all of the sample code

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.616 A:middle
and projects that we
provide for any or many

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.996 A:middle
of the APIs that we have.

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:39.166 A:middle
There are many new APIs
that came out this week,

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.106 A:middle
and if you want to
understand how they work,

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:42.646 A:middle
it's a great place to
download and check it

00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:43.506 A:middle
out and run it yourself.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.416 A:middle
So let's get in the
class reference.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.256 A:middle
So, I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this,

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:52.316 A:middle
this is where you can
get the entire reference

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.746 A:middle
for your entire API,
you can get--

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.626 A:middle
take a look to see what
are the arguments I need

00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:59.936 A:middle
in your method names,
all that good stuff,

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.776 A:middle
you can also see example code,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.776 A:middle
you can also see example code,

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.766 A:middle
so you can see exactly
what you need to do

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.036 A:middle
to actually use these
great new features in APIs.

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:10.986 A:middle
And lastly, you can also
checkout some common issues

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:12.536 A:middle
and frequently asked
questions that we have

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.066 A:middle
or that you may have
about the APIs.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.336 A:middle
There's usually, if
you have a question,

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:18.886 A:middle
and you not really
understand what's going on,

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:22.166 A:middle
there's usually a very
good chance that's covered

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.526 A:middle
in the common issues and
frequently asked questions.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.666 A:middle
One thing I should want to call
out our full programming guides.

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.756 A:middle
These are entire books
worth of content here,

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:36.176 A:middle
whether it starting off with
Objective-C and you want

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.876 A:middle
to know how that works, you got
there, or say you want again

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:42.026 A:middle
in to OpenGL, we actually have
the entire documentation on that

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:46.316 A:middle
as well, or in this case we
have brand new text editing APIs

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:50.406 A:middle
and iOS for iOS 7,
really great stuff here.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:55.466 A:middle
But I know what you're thinking,
you don't want to go onto--

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.476 A:middle
have a Safari window open
and have that next to you.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
If you're anything like me,
when you're coding away,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
If you're anything like me,
when you're coding away,

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:03.896 A:middle
you want to be able to access
stuff nice and quickly.

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.686 A:middle
And the cool thing is, you
can access all the stuff right

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:08.776 A:middle
from Xcode and the Help menu.

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.386 A:middle
Go there and you get
the documentation API

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:12.096 A:middle
Reference guide.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:16.026 A:middle
And the nice thing is in Xcode
5, we've actually revamp this

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.426 A:middle
to make it really, really
nice and easy to go through

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.375 A:middle
and check these things out.

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.796 A:middle
And not only that, there are
a lot of other cool things

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.996 A:middle
that you can do in
Xcode as well.

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:31.226 A:middle
For example, the
Option-click on any symbol,

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:34.426 A:middle
you can get a nice quick
description of what's going on

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.796 A:middle
and also access the header
files if you want to go in

00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:38.106 A:middle
and get maybe a bit
more information.

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:42.146 A:middle
The nice thing is you can also
get a one click access directly

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
to the Reference guide there.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.806 A:middle
So you don't actually
have to like go and search

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:49.306 A:middle
for that online, you got
it right through Xcode.

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:51.966 A:middle
We also have a bit more
information in the sidebar

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.096 A:middle
when you click on the symbol.

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:57.066 A:middle
You get the same access to the
headers and the API reference,

00:04:57.426 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
but you also get our links
to any programming guides

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.426 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
but you also get our links
to any programming guides

00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:04.416 A:middle
that might be helpful with
that particular symbol

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.806 A:middle
that you'll looking at.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.586 A:middle
Another nice thing is that
you can get one-click access

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
to some sample code as well,
it's really, really nice.

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:16.386 A:middle
One thing I want to call
out though is at the bottom

00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:21.256 A:middle
of all our documentation
pages is a feedback area.

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
So over here this is where you
can go and report any typos,

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.636 A:middle
missing information
that you see,

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.116 A:middle
maybe if something
it's confusing or even

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.066 A:middle
if something was helpful,
this is really great

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.796 A:middle
where you can tell us how we can
make things better even for you.

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:35.066 A:middle
So, if you go in
and you find, wow,

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:37.826 A:middle
this are really nice document
I was reading and I'd really

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.116 A:middle
like it some more stuff
is like that, let us know.

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
If you think, that was like
90 percent that way there,

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.266 A:middle
but there is something else
that could make this even great,

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:49.666 A:middle
let us know that or something
wasn't helpful at all,

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:50.806 A:middle
that's where you can go.

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:55.416 A:middle
So once you've actually
gone through documentation

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.976 A:middle
that you're working on,
still not sure what to do,

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:01.176 A:middle
the next best place you can
go is the Developer Forums.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:01.176 A:middle
the next best place you can
go is the Developer Forums.

00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
So devforums.apple.com and
we have areas for iOS, OS X.

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:13.306 A:middle
And we also have areas for
our tools and also deployment

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.786 A:middle
and other types of things
that we provide as well.

00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.786 A:middle
So the nice thing about
the developer forums is

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:22.706 A:middle
that you have peer support.

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.806 A:middle
So you're actually there
working with the rest

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.276 A:middle
of the Apple developer
community.

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:29.896 A:middle
So when you have an issue and
you're not sure what's going on,

00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:32.546 A:middle
the nice thing about the dev
forums, it's a really nice place

00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:34.986 A:middle
where you can go
and get some help

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.316 A:middle
and maybe triage your problem.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.226 A:middle
So, see and try to
actually drill

00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:42.016 A:middle
down to see what exactly is
going on, is it may be an issue

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:44.706 A:middle
in a certain API was working, is
it maybe issue in your own code,

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:46.076 A:middle
maybe it's an issue
with some virus stuffs,

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:47.806 A:middle
it's where you can do that.

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:49.996 A:middle
The nice thing is,
you can also search

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:54.986 A:middle
if someone else has a question,
maybe it'll be helpful to you

00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:56.866 A:middle
or if they get that answered.

00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:02.106 A:middle
And also, you also have Apple
employees there as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:02.106 A:middle
And also, you also have Apple
employees there as well.

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:07.666 A:middle
So over here, if you see an
Apple avatar right there Dr.

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:10.126 A:middle
Ernie, he's actually
one of our moderators

00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:12.366 A:middle
that you can see always
around helping people out.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:15.516 A:middle
And there are also
engineers on here as well.

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
So if you have a question,

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.566 A:middle
engineers are visiting
these as well.

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:23.286 A:middle
One thing I want to
call out though is

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:25.606 A:middle
that the forums are
kind of public,

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.336 A:middle
so if you have a question that
might be a bit confidential

00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:29.406 A:middle
for your own application,

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:31.786 A:middle
everyone can see
what you post here.

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:34.216 A:middle
So if you don't want
to go through that

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.166 A:middle
and don't want everyone to
see what your secret stuff is,

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:41.866 A:middle
I suggest you check out DTS,
and we'll go into that in a bit.

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:46.216 A:middle
So let's go over an example
post, don't need to go

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.176 A:middle
into too much, just some
things I want to call out here.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.926 A:middle
So over here we have
someone who's has--

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:54.036 A:middle
is reading some of our example
code and the guy got confused

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.036 A:middle
on something, what's
going on here,

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:56.656 A:middle
it doesn't really
following some guideline.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:04.346 A:middle
And actually, Rincewind is
actually an Apple engineer.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:04.346 A:middle
And actually, Rincewind is
actually an Apple engineer.

00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:06.006 A:middle
So if you ever see an avatar

00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:07.506 A:middle
with the little Apple
logo right next to it,

00:08:08.246 --> 00:08:09.856 A:middle
know that's an engineer
helping you out here.

00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:11.766 A:middle
Also we have little area there

00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:13.736 A:middle
where you can say a post
was actually helpful

00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:14.756 A:middle
or not very helpful to you.

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:17.896 A:middle
And the nice thing is other
developers can see this as well.

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
So someone answers your question
and it really helped you out,

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:26.096 A:middle
let other developers
know so that they'll know

00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
that this is exactly
what they need to--

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.926 A:middle
that's an exactly
answer that they want.

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.226 A:middle
You'd also report a post.

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:34.635 A:middle
So that doesn't necessarily
mean that something is bad here,

00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:36.206 A:middle
it could be as really
great question

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.326 A:middle
but maybe it's in
the wrong area.

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.765 A:middle
So if you click there, a
moderator can go take a look

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:42.366 A:middle
on what's going on,
actually moving around.

00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:47.386 A:middle
Next, once you've gone
through all these things,

00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:50.876 A:middle
let's go in the areas
about helping with Apple.

00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:52.756 A:middle
So you work with
some documentation,

00:08:52.756 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
you got your app ready to go
and you need some help from us.

00:08:57.216 --> 00:09:00.676 A:middle
So, one of the first main areas
about this is bug reporting

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.216 --> 00:09:00.676 A:middle
So, one of the first main areas
about this is bug reporting

00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:04.676 A:middle
and for that I'm going
to hand off to Tanya.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:09.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:10.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Nahir.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:11.826 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:09:11.826 --> 00:09:14.196 A:middle
Thanks for joining us
here, I know it's Friday

00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:15.856 A:middle
and it's almost lunch.

00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:18.496 A:middle
So I'll try to make it
as quick as possible.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:22.526 A:middle
My Name is Tanya and I'm
an iOS Software Engineer

00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:23.436 A:middle
on the MAPS team.

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:26.066 A:middle
And today, we're going
to talk about a topic

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.926 A:middle
that is very near
and dear to me.

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.666 A:middle
In fact, it's near
and dear to a lot

00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:31.546 A:middle
of Apple engineers,
bug reporting.

00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:35.256 A:middle
And we're going to talk about
how you can utilize bug reports

00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:38.306 A:middle
to communicate with Apple
regarding the issues you've been

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:38.916 A:middle
running into.

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:43.646 A:middle
So let's start with the
very fundamental question

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:45.856 A:middle
on why should you
file bug reports?

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:52.216 A:middle
You should file bug reports
because it provides a way for us

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.106 A:middle
as Apple engineers to
help you out directly.

00:09:55.106 --> 00:10:00.316 A:middle
You see we worked really hard
to make an amazing platform,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:55.106 --> 00:10:00.316 A:middle
You see we worked really hard
to make an amazing platform,

00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:04.146 A:middle
make amazing tools that help
you make wonderful applications

00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:05.456 A:middle
that delight our customers.

00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:09.636 A:middle
But sometimes, there might be
issues, there might be problems

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:12.996 A:middle
that we did not anticipate,
and when you run into these,

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:14.396 A:middle
we would like you
to let us know.

00:10:14.396 --> 00:10:16.256 A:middle
We would like you to let us know

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
so that we can take
the appropriate action

00:10:19.006 --> 00:10:20.246 A:middle
to address those quickly.

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:24.396 A:middle
When you file a bug
report it goes directly

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:27.576 A:middle
to an Apple engineer, I
read these bug reports.

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:30.606 A:middle
All the engineers, you might
have met during the labs

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:32.896 A:middle
and sessions, they
read your bug reports,

00:10:32.896 --> 00:10:35.316 A:middle
they're surely not eaten by
the trolls in our dungeons,

00:10:35.576 --> 00:10:37.186 A:middle
this feedback is important,

00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.796 A:middle
these back reports
are important.

00:10:39.356 --> 00:10:42.946 A:middle
So, if you want a direct
communication channel

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
to an Apple engineer to
tell us some of the--

00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:49.116 A:middle
to tell about the issues
that he would be encountering

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:52.796 A:middle
in our software, bug
reports are the way to go.

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:56.846 A:middle
Sometimes, when I tell
people to file bugs,

00:10:57.146 --> 00:10:58.256 A:middle
they have a few questions.

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
Sometimes they say, well,
Tanya, I saw this problem,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
Sometimes they say, well,
Tanya, I saw this problem,

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:05.746 A:middle
but it was an extremely
trivial issue,

00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:09.846 A:middle
you see perhaps it was a typo
or the color was a little off,

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.596 A:middle
should I still file
a bug report?

00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:13.416 A:middle
Yes, absolutely.

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.776 A:middle
File a bug report.

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:18.086 A:middle
You see, a problem
that might seem trivial

00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:20.856 A:middle
to you might have some
really bad consequences.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:25.456 A:middle
Also it might manifest
itself in worse ways.

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:26.946 A:middle
So file a bug report.

00:11:28.256 --> 00:11:32.696 A:middle
Sometimes we say, well, you
know, this problem happened once

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:36.166 A:middle
and it never happened again,
I never ever saw this again.

00:11:36.536 --> 00:11:37.836 A:middle
Should I still file
a bug report?

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:40.576 A:middle
Yes, you should file
a bug report.

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:44.746 A:middle
You see, even though, the
problem only happened once,

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:48.326 A:middle
it might still have been a
really bad user experience.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:52.336 A:middle
Others might hit it too and
other might hit it more number

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.746 A:middle
of times, so file a bug report.

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:59.196 A:middle
Sometimes they say, well,
it's a really obvious problem,

00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:01.936 A:middle
I'm sure you have 12
copies of the bug.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:01.936 A:middle
I'm sure you have 12
copies of the bug.

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:04.796 A:middle
I am sure someone else
has already filed it,

00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:06.776 A:middle
should I still file
a bug report?

00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:10.036 A:middle
Yes. You should still
file a bug report.

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:15.166 A:middle
You see, it's better to
have five copies of the bug

00:12:15.706 --> 00:12:16.756 A:middle
than to have none at all,

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
there's a good reason
I say that.

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:25.296 A:middle
At Apple, if an issue is not
tracked using a bug report,

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.686 A:middle
it essentially does
not exist for us.

00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
Bug reports are like
to-do items,

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
we track everything using bug
reports, bugs [inaudible],

00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:42.836 A:middle
even big features that go
into a particular release.

00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:46.146 A:middle
And some other things
that might not seem

00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:48.096 A:middle
so obvious to start off of it.

00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:54.706 A:middle
When I come into work
every morning, in fact,

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:58.206 A:middle
when all Apple engineers
come into work every morning,

00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:02.546 A:middle
the first thing we do is to
go through our list of bugs

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:02.546 A:middle
the first thing we do is to
go through our list of bugs

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:06.976 A:middle
to figure out what is it
that we need to do that day.

00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:10.476 A:middle
To figure out, if you're on
track for a particular release,

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:16.016 A:middle
I know that's a good
one, it's an actual bug.

00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:18.716 A:middle
To figure out, if
you're on track

00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
for a particular release our
program office, our management,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
they go through a list of bugs
to figure out if you're focusing

00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:27.096 A:middle
on the right things
at the right time.

00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:30.256 A:middle
So we track everything using
these bug reports, bugs,

00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:33.316 A:middle
features, coffee
problems, elevator problems,

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.866 A:middle
all of that, these
are important.

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:41.176 A:middle
So now that we know why these
bug reports are important,

00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:43.966 A:middle
where do you actually
go to file these?

00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:50.396 A:middle
The one stop shop for filing bug
reports is bugreport.apple.com,

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:53.206 A:middle
this is the only official
way of filing bug reports.

00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:56.326 A:middle
When you file a bug report, you
are provided with a problem ID

00:13:56.326 --> 00:14:01.146 A:middle
and you can use this ID to
track the status of your bug.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.326 --> 00:14:01.146 A:middle
and you can use this ID to
track the status of your bug.

00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:05.236 A:middle
Also, even after the bug
is filed, you have a way

00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:06.796 A:middle
to provide additional
information.

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:08.286 A:middle
On the other hand,

00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:11.986 A:middle
if the engineers have any
clarifying questions for you,

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:14.926 A:middle
they have a means to get back
to you with these questions.

00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:18.806 A:middle
And one thing to keep
in mind when you're file

00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:21.916 A:middle
in this bug reports is
to keep things specific.

00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:25.576 A:middle
Follow the golden
rule of bug filing,

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:29.286 A:middle
just to use one report
for one issue.

00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:33.516 A:middle
Things that might seem
related to you, and might seem

00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:35.696 A:middle
like they can be
grouped together

00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:39.816 A:middle
into one bug report might
actually very different things

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:43.086 A:middle
and there might be different
engineers working on it.

00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:48.376 A:middle
So help us track things better
by keeping things specific,

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.246 A:middle
so file one report
for one issue.

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:55.576 A:middle
So what do you file
these bug reports for?

00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:57.316 A:middle
Well, when it comes to software,

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:01.636 A:middle
there are few things you can
use these bug reports for.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:01.636 A:middle
there are few things you can
use these bug reports for.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:06.776 A:middle
Bugs, if you notice something
does not work as expected,

00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:10.106 A:middle
that's a software defect, that's
a bug, so file a bug report.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.986 A:middle
If you notice an application
quits unexpectedly or crashes

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:20.226 A:middle
or if it's hanging and
unresponsive, file a bug report.

00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:25.556 A:middle
If you notice your
application slow or hanging

00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:28.066 A:middle
or perhaps leaking memory
and you think it's a problem

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:30.086 A:middle
in our API, file a bug report.

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:36.246 A:middle
If you have a suggestion for a
new feature or an improvement

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:39.056 A:middle
of an existing feature,
file a bug report.

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:42.616 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
when you're filing
these bug reports is

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:47.076 A:middle
to file them as early
as possible.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.506 A:middle
Do not wait till the last
seed to report an issue

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:53.066 A:middle
that might be blocking
essential functionality

00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.026 A:middle
of your application.

00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:56.996 A:middle
There's a good reason why
I say that and it relates

00:15:56.996 --> 00:15:58.266 A:middle
to how we schedule things.

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
So let's look at the
graphical representation

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
So let's look at the
graphical representation

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:02.926 A:middle
of the problem at hand.

00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
So the horizontal axis
represents the various

00:16:07.586 --> 00:16:09.256 A:middle
milestones in our release.

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:13.156 A:middle
The vertical axis
represents the probability

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:18.546 A:middle
that the bug will get addressed
in that particular release.

00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:20.506 A:middle
If you notice the blue line

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:23.466 A:middle
that relates little
parameters curves downwards.

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:26.026 A:middle
So if the green arrow
had to present

00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:31.056 A:middle
when we receive the bug
report, you can tell easily

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:34.196 A:middle
that the sooner you file,
the higher the chances

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.986 A:middle
that your bug report,
bug will get addressed

00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:38.406 A:middle
in that particular release.

00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:41.996 A:middle
On the other hand, if you
wait till the last minute,

00:16:42.286 --> 00:16:43.346 A:middle
we run out of time.

00:16:43.926 --> 00:16:45.886 A:middle
Also the fix that is needed

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.916 A:middle
to resolve the problem
you had reported,

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:52.326 A:middle
it might be very risky, so we
might not be able to incorporate

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.076 A:middle
that into a particular release.

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:57.606 A:middle
But does that mean,
it just expires,

00:16:57.606 --> 00:16:58.666 A:middle
we don't look at it ever?

00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.506 A:middle
Absolutely no.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:03.306 A:middle
We will address that
in the next release.

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:07.156 A:middle
Now there are few
other things you can do

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:11.006 A:middle
to improve the chances of your
bug getting fixed in time.

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.226 A:middle
But before we talk about that,

00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:17.205 A:middle
let's look at what actually
happens after you file your bug.

00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:19.715 A:middle
So as we had established
earlier,

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.546 A:middle
it goes directly to
an Apple engineer.

00:17:24.506 --> 00:17:27.546 A:middle
The engineer might forward
it to other engineers

00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
if the underlying cause
of the issue is not

00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:31.596 A:middle
in their area of expertise.

00:17:32.526 --> 00:17:35.036 A:middle
But for the sake of
simplicity, let's just assume,

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:36.746 A:middle
it stays with that one engineer.

00:17:37.836 --> 00:17:39.236 A:middle
Now in the perfect scenario,

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.846 A:middle
the engineer will understand the
problem, will investigate it,

00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:46.936 A:middle
come up with the fix, and
integrate that into a build.

00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:51.006 A:middle
Once the fix becomes
available in a release build,

00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:53.126 A:middle
we send the bug back to you.

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:57.506 A:middle
Now we recommend that when
you get back the bug report,

00:17:58.026 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
you verify that the problem
was fixed and we also recommend

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.026 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
you verify that the problem
was fixed and we also recommend

00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:03.296 A:middle
that you do this as
soon as possible.

00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:07.556 A:middle
You see sometimes, the issue
might not have actually been

00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:11.226 A:middle
fixed and you have the option
of sending the bug back to us

00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:13.756 A:middle
and by responding
quickly, you make sure

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:17.626 A:middle
that there still enough time
for us to reinvestigate it

00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:20.266 A:middle
and still fix it in
that particular release.

00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:25.406 A:middle
Sometimes, the bug
may come back to you

00:18:25.406 --> 00:18:27.806 A:middle
as a duplicate, what
does this mean?

00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:31.996 A:middle
This means that there is an
existing bug report that we have

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:35.676 A:middle
that is tracking the same
issue as you had reported.

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:38.836 A:middle
Now does this mean this is
just a waste of your time?

00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:39.546 A:middle
Absolutely not.

00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:41.556 A:middle
Duplicates are important.

00:18:42.516 --> 00:18:45.566 A:middle
You see, your bug report
might have better information,

00:18:45.566 --> 00:18:47.626 A:middle
it might have more
actionable data

00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:50.126 A:middle
than the original
bug that was filed.

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:55.236 A:middle
Also many times, we use a number
of duplicates as an indicator

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.736 A:middle
of how widespread the problem is

00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:00.366 A:middle
so that we can prioritize
it correctly.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:00.366 A:middle
so that we can prioritize
it correctly.

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:06.466 A:middle
Even if your issue was tagged as
a duplicate, you have the option

00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:10.116 A:middle
of requesting status of the
original bug, just put a comment

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:13.106 A:middle
in your bug report and we will
provide the relevant information

00:19:13.106 --> 00:19:14.046 A:middle
to you.

00:19:16.476 --> 00:19:21.756 A:middle
Sometimes, when you file a bug,
we might send it back to you

00:19:21.796 --> 00:19:23.456 A:middle
as insufficient information.

00:19:24.306 --> 00:19:25.166 A:middle
What does this mean?

00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:30.256 A:middle
This means that the bug report
does not have enough information

00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.006 A:middle
for us to diagnose the problem.

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:35.476 A:middle
Now if possible you
want to avoid running

00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:39.246 A:middle
into this scenario, and there
is a good reason why I say that.

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:43.106 A:middle
Let's bring back our older time

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:44.266 A:middle
versus [phonetic]
probability graph

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:45.536 A:middle
and see what it looks like.

00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:49.146 A:middle
If you read-- you did the
right thing by filing early,

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.716 A:middle
so you started out strong.

00:19:51.036 --> 00:19:53.936 A:middle
But unfortunately, the bug
report did not contain enough

00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:56.726 A:middle
information, so we
sent it back to you

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.036 A:middle
with clarifying questions.

00:19:58.786 --> 00:20:00.266 A:middle
You collected the information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.786 --> 00:20:00.266 A:middle
You collected the information

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.266 A:middle
and sent it back to
us which is great.

00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:06.626 A:middle
But unfortunately in all
this valuable time was lost.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.336 A:middle
So even though you had
started out strong,

00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:13.956 A:middle
you end up on the lower
part of the curve.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.686 A:middle
To avoid this back and
forth formal information,

00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:21.936 A:middle
start out with a well
written actionable bug report

00:20:22.026 --> 00:20:24.856 A:middle
in the first place.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:28.506 A:middle
To make your bug report
actionable it should be clear,

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:33.586 A:middle
concise, informative,
constructive and specific.

00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:37.806 A:middle
To ensure that your bug report
has all these qualities,

00:20:37.806 --> 00:20:41.796 A:middle
let's go to the different
components of a bug report

00:20:41.796 --> 00:20:44.856 A:middle
and talk about some of the
things you should keep in mind

00:20:45.486 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
when you're filing a bug report.

00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:51.606 A:middle
So here are the different
components of a bug report,

00:20:52.316 --> 00:20:56.046 A:middle
the problem report title,
the problem detail section,

00:20:56.686 --> 00:20:57.866 A:middle
additional enclosures,

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:01.116 A:middle
configuration information
and reproducibility.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:01.116 A:middle
configuration information
and reproducibility.

00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:05.296 A:middle
Let's start by looking
at the title.

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:11.756 A:middle
Think of the title as an
advertisement for your issue.

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:16.176 A:middle
You want it so that when the
engineer reads the title they

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
want to open it and
investigate it.

00:21:18.186 --> 00:21:21.036 A:middle
A good title is clear
and succinct.

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:24.796 A:middle
Think of it like a tweet, you
see, you have limited space,

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:29.076 A:middle
but yet you want it to convey
as much information as possible.

00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:32.906 A:middle
So make every word
count, avoid filler words.

00:21:33.106 --> 00:21:36.606 A:middle
Drop off any articles of
preposition or pronouns

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.826 A:middle
that are not needed there.

00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
So a good title should
stand on its own.

00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:47.656 A:middle
You see a title is often seen
a list of tens or thousands

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:50.446 A:middle
of bugs and could be
totally out of context,

00:21:51.316 --> 00:21:56.276 A:middle
also above title is often use
as a search for you issue.

00:21:57.136 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
So, when you're coming up
with the bug title think

00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
about how is it that you
would search for the issue

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
about how is it that you
would search for the issue

00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:04.936 A:middle
and hopefully that will
give you some hints

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:06.926 A:middle
on how to structure it.

00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:10.506 A:middle
So let's look at an example.

00:22:10.506 --> 00:22:13.246 A:middle
Here we have one, copy
and paste is broken.

00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:17.486 A:middle
Now, it's surely succinct
its only five words.

00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:20.416 A:middle
It's probably descriptive
though,

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:23.456 A:middle
it doesn't really tell us how
is it if we perform the copy

00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:26.196 A:middle
and paste and surely we don't
know what we mean by broken.

00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:27.676 A:middle
So let's improve this further.

00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:32.276 A:middle
Here we are at information
about how is it's that we--

00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:33.966 A:middle
that perform the copy operation.

00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:35.036 A:middle
This is fine.

00:22:36.076 --> 00:22:38.496 A:middle
But there's still the
word broken in there,

00:22:38.786 --> 00:22:40.726 A:middle
which is not descriptive.

00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:44.586 A:middle
So we add information about
what is it that we saw.

00:22:44.586 --> 00:22:49.116 A:middle
Now this is pretty good,
but we can get bonus points

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:52.326 A:middle
by prefixing it with
the software version

00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:53.366 A:middle
where we saw the problem.

00:22:53.366 --> 00:22:56.496 A:middle
Now this is especially
relevant for seed build,

00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:59.876 A:middle
'cause when we see the title
we can clearly and easily tell

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
that this problem
was encountered

00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:04.236 A:middle
in a seed build versus
a GM Build.

00:23:04.236 --> 00:23:10.006 A:middle
Next up, is the problem
details component.

00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:14.276 A:middle
When we talk about problem
details we mean be descriptive.

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:19.006 A:middle
Remember, the engineer who's
reading your bug report was not

00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:20.986 A:middle
present with you when
the problem had happened.

00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:23.616 A:middle
They had not seen
what you had observed.

00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:28.226 A:middle
So tell them about it, and
this is the place to do that.

00:23:29.536 --> 00:23:33.266 A:middle
The problem details component
has five different subsections.

00:23:33.686 --> 00:23:36.716 A:middle
Let's talk about each
of them one at a time.

00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:41.276 A:middle
Start with summary, the problem
summary section is probably

00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:45.146 A:middle
recapping the title and
include some more descriptive

00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:46.316 A:middle
summary information.

00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:48.266 A:middle
What was going to?

00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:49.406 A:middle
What happened?

00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:51.826 A:middle
And why is it a problem?

00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:56.546 A:middle
If you encountered an error
message, this is a great place

00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:59.686 A:middle
to put the exact text
of the error message.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:04.066 A:middle
And so remember be specific.

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:07.596 A:middle
Saying Safari is slow is
generally not good enough.

00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:11.026 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared
to other browsers?

00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:15.026 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari on other machines?

00:24:15.026 --> 00:24:18.406 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari's earlier versions?

00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:19.656 A:middle
Be specific.

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.956 A:middle
Also use the correct
terminology?

00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:25.696 A:middle
If you're not sure what a
particular control is called,

00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:26.966 A:middle
use a screenshot.

00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:29.706 A:middle
Because that will tell
us exactly what it is.

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:34.146 A:middle
So be precise and
avoid weird language,

00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
saying nothing happens
does not communicate much.

00:24:38.806 --> 00:24:41.426 A:middle
Instead tell us what is
it that you did expect

00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:43.786 A:middle
to happen and did not happen.

00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:48.106 A:middle
So instead of saying nothing
happens when I try to print

00:24:48.106 --> 00:24:50.866 A:middle
from Safari, try
saying this instead,

00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:54.196 A:middle
the printer progress
dialog does not appear

00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:55.626 A:middle
after I select the print button.

00:24:56.326 --> 00:24:56.966 A:middle
That is much better.

00:24:56.966 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
So let's look at
an example summary

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:56.966 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
So let's look at
an example summary

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.146 A:middle
for the copy and paste problem.

00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:06.946 A:middle
We start out by recapping
the title which is great,

00:25:07.336 --> 00:25:10.576 A:middle
and then we add some other
observations that we had made

00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:12.356 A:middle
when the problem had occurred.

00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:14.276 A:middle
This is pretty good.

00:25:14.676 --> 00:25:17.906 A:middle
Next up is steps to reproduce.

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:21.906 A:middle
The problem with steps
to reproduce is to think

00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:24.906 A:middle
of what it would take
to reproduce the issue

00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:27.436 A:middle
on a freshly set of
device of machine.

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:31.536 A:middle
Pretend you're telling your mom
on how to reproduce the issue.

00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:35.896 A:middle
Put yourself in the shoes
of the engineer and think

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:39.516 A:middle
about what is it that
they might need to know

00:25:39.796 --> 00:25:41.566 A:middle
to diagnose the problem
correctly.

00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
So anticipate the sort

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:44.626 A:middle
of questions they
might have for you.

00:25:45.616 --> 00:25:49.206 A:middle
Also remember do not make
assumptions about them knowing

00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:50.586 A:middle
about your application.

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:52.616 A:middle
So be specific.

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:56.536 A:middle
Instead of saying open the
file, tell us how is it

00:25:56.536 --> 00:25:57.456 A:middle
that you open the file.

00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:59.616 A:middle
Did you open the
file using finder?

00:25:59.616 --> 00:26:01.546 A:middle
Did you open the
file using terminal?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.616 --> 00:26:01.546 A:middle
Did you open the
file using terminal?

00:26:01.716 --> 00:26:03.726 A:middle
That might be a relevant
piece of information.

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:05.236 A:middle
Always remember it's better

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:06.936 A:middle
to include more information
than less.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:10.306 A:middle
So with that, let's
look at an example.

00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:13.306 A:middle
The same copy and paste
problem we've been working with.

00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
So we start out fresh, we do not
make any assumptions of the code

00:26:17.736 --> 00:26:19.056 A:middle
that might have happened
before this.

00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:23.096 A:middle
We provide information
about how is it

00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:25.266 A:middle
that we perform the
copy operation.

00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:29.746 A:middle
Next up, we move onto how is it
we perform the paste operation.

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:32.806 A:middle
We launch the Mail app,
select the compose button

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.846 A:middle
and then select the paste button
that appears in the callout.

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
This is pretty good.

00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.696 A:middle
Next up, are the two
results sections,

00:26:45.756 --> 00:26:47.926 A:middle
expected results
and actual results.

00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:50.606 A:middle
Use these sections to specify,

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:53.156 A:middle
what is it that you'd
expected to see?

00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:55.846 A:middle
And how was it different
from what you actually saw?

00:26:55.846 --> 00:26:59.586 A:middle
Now this piece of information
has actually very important,

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:04.026 A:middle
because sometimes what you
expect might not be consistent

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:04.026 A:middle
because sometimes what you
expect might not be consistent

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:05.936 A:middle
with what the engineer expects.

00:27:06.606 --> 00:27:10.226 A:middle
So by specifying this we can
clearly tell why you thought it

00:27:10.226 --> 00:27:12.086 A:middle
was a problem what had happened.

00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:16.116 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:27:16.756 --> 00:27:21.686 A:middle
Start out by specifying, what is
it that we did expect to happen?

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:24.116 A:middle
Which was us being
able to paste image.

00:27:25.386 --> 00:27:28.076 A:middle
Then we specify what is
it that actually happened,

00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:30.366 A:middle
which was us ending
with an image,

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:32.626 A:middle
containing a blue box
containing question mark.

00:27:33.646 --> 00:27:36.426 A:middle
Now it might not be clear
what is it that we mean

00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:39.806 A:middle
by this blue box
containing a question mark.

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:45.356 A:middle
So in all these cases attaching
a screenshot is a great idea,

00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:48.666 A:middle
it will tell us exactly
what you saw.

00:27:49.166 --> 00:27:54.246 A:middle
With that let's talk about
the regression section.

00:27:54.766 --> 00:28:00.536 A:middle
Use a section to specify
when does the problem occur,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:54.766 --> 00:28:00.536 A:middle
Use a section to specify
when does the problem occur,

00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:02.556 A:middle
when does is it not occur?

00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:06.316 A:middle
So did the problem happen
in the first seed of iOS 7,

00:28:06.576 --> 00:28:09.846 A:middle
but did not happen
in iOS 6 and earlier.

00:28:11.006 --> 00:28:14.486 A:middle
Also does the problem go away
if the application is relaunched

00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:16.136 A:middle
or if the machine is rebooted?

00:28:17.016 --> 00:28:20.246 A:middle
All that is relevant information
for the regression section.

00:28:20.526 --> 00:28:22.816 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:25.506 A:middle
We start out by specifying,

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:27.856 A:middle
when is it that we
did see that problem?

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:30.636 A:middle
Which is the iOS 6 seed.

00:28:31.506 --> 00:28:34.556 A:middle
Then move on to specifying
the software configuration

00:28:34.836 --> 00:28:36.566 A:middle
where we did not
see the problem,

00:28:36.566 --> 00:28:38.706 A:middle
which is iOS 5 and earlier.

00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:43.846 A:middle
We also provide some other base
we had not seen the problem

00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:45.896 A:middle
which was using an
alternative way

00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:48.006 A:middle
of performing the
copy operation.

00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:53.536 A:middle
Let's talk about
the next component

00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:55.146 A:middle
which is the additional
enclosures.

00:28:55.146 --> 00:29:00.526 A:middle
Now when you're filing a bug
report there might be extra

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:55.146 --> 00:29:00.526 A:middle
Now when you're filing a bug
report there might be extra

00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:03.986 A:middle
information that you
can attach to your bug

00:29:04.086 --> 00:29:09.046 A:middle
that will greatly help us
understand the problem a

00:29:09.046 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
lot quicker.

00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:15.716 A:middle
Now an example of that
is a sample project.

00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
You see, when I find a
sample project attached

00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:20.936 A:middle
to a bug report it pretty
much feels like finding gold,

00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:22.076 A:middle
because these are awesome.

00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:24.296 A:middle
They are great for two reasons.

00:29:25.266 --> 00:29:29.266 A:middle
First, it helps you isolate
the problem to figure

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:33.166 A:middle
out if it's an issue with
your code or with our API.

00:29:34.276 --> 00:29:38.766 A:middle
Second, it helps us understand
the problem a lot quicker,

00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:42.546 A:middle
because we have a focus
example to work with.

00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.656 A:middle
So sample projects are great.

00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:51.236 A:middle
In addition, there might be some
other logs that you can attach

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.976 A:middle
that will greatly help us
diagnose the problem quicker.

00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:59.436 A:middle
Our online webpage has some
excellent documentation

00:29:59.706 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
on what sorts of
logs you can attach

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.706 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
on what sorts of
logs you can attach

00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:03.326 A:middle
to what sorts of problems.

00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:05.286 A:middle
And it also has detailed steps

00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:07.966 A:middle
on how you can go
about retrieving it.

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:09.836 A:middle
Let's go through of few of them

00:30:10.536 --> 00:30:12.706 A:middle
that are common in
a lot of cases.

00:30:12.826 --> 00:30:15.286 A:middle
First up are crash logs.

00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:19.446 A:middle
So if you run into
a crash you may want

00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:20.986 A:middle
to attach the crash log.

00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
To retrieve the crush log
for an iOS device start

00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:27.616 A:middle
by connecting the device
to your host machine.

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:29.956 A:middle
And then sync it with iTunes.

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.546 A:middle
This will transfer the log file

00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:35.696 A:middle
from your device to
your host machine.

00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:40.366 A:middle
So the next step is
to locate the log file

00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:41.666 A:middle
on your host machine.

00:30:42.296 --> 00:30:45.666 A:middle
Now, if you're using a MAC,
look under this location

00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:49.586 A:middle
which is the User Directory,
Library, Logs, CrashReporter,

00:30:49.586 --> 00:30:53.876 A:middle
MobileDevice, and then a folder
name corresponding to the device

00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:55.146 A:middle
where the issue had occurred.

00:30:55.996 --> 00:30:59.106 A:middle
You'll see files of this
format, there will be prefix

00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:02.486 A:middle
for the name of the application
of the process that had crashed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:02.486 A:middle
for the name of the application
of the process that had crashed.

00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:04.876 A:middle
And will also contain
a timestamp

00:31:05.186 --> 00:31:07.226 A:middle
from when the issue
had occurred.

00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:09.836 A:middle
So hopefully this will provide
you with enough information

00:31:10.416 --> 00:31:13.586 A:middle
on figuring out which is
the file you need to attach.

00:31:14.156 --> 00:31:18.596 A:middle
If you had connected your
device to a Windows machine,

00:31:18.596 --> 00:31:21.306 A:middle
it's the same steps, but
you just need to look

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:22.636 A:middle
under a different location.

00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:30.646 A:middle
If you'd encountered the
crash on in OS X machine,

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:36.116 A:middle
look under this location which
is the User directory, Library,

00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:40.686 A:middle
Logs, DiagnosticReports,
you should see the files

00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:41.866 A:middle
for the same sort of format.

00:31:42.276 --> 00:31:45.586 A:middle
They'll be prefix for the
crashing application process

00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:47.836 A:middle
name and will contain
the timestamp

00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:51.836 A:middle
from when the problem
had occurred.

00:31:52.026 --> 00:31:54.016 A:middle
Next up are console logs.

00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
Now these logs are great
because they capture some really

00:31:57.726 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
important application and
system state information.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.726 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
important application and
system state information.

00:32:01.466 --> 00:32:03.966 A:middle
They might contain
some error information

00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:06.646 A:middle
that will help us understand
the problem quickly.

00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:10.166 A:middle
So to capture these
for iOS devices,

00:32:10.746 --> 00:32:15.186 A:middle
launch your Xcode organizer
window, select the console tab

00:32:15.186 --> 00:32:16.526 A:middle
from the left inside panel.

00:32:16.886 --> 00:32:18.576 A:middle
Reproduce the issue if you can,

00:32:19.316 --> 00:32:23.216 A:middle
and then save it using the Save
log as button at the bottom.

00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:27.596 A:middle
On OS X it's a bit different,

00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:31.346 A:middle
we use a different application
called console, it's located

00:32:31.346 --> 00:32:34.286 A:middle
under the Utilities folder of
your Applications Directory.

00:32:35.116 --> 00:32:39.896 A:middle
So once you launch it, you get
a window that looks like this.

00:32:40.196 --> 00:32:43.146 A:middle
Select the All Messages tab
from the left inside panel,

00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:46.386 A:middle
reproduce the issue if you can.

00:32:46.386 --> 00:32:49.596 A:middle
And then save it
using the Save a Copy

00:32:49.596 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
As option from the File menu.

00:32:54.076 --> 00:32:59.196 A:middle
Screenshots, now a picture
is worth a thousand words.

00:32:59.406 --> 00:33:03.816 A:middle
And this is especially relevant
when it comes to bug reports.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.406 --> 00:33:03.816 A:middle
And this is especially relevant
when it comes to bug reports.

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:07.366 A:middle
You see, you might have
run into a display issue

00:33:07.366 --> 00:33:09.956 A:middle
or a screen rendering
issue that is very hard

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:11.136 A:middle
to describe using words.

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:14.076 A:middle
Or as we had mentioned earlier,
you might have use the control

00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:15.976 A:middle
and you don't know
what it is called.

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:18.386 A:middle
So use a screenshot in
all these scenarios.

00:33:19.256 --> 00:33:21.716 A:middle
To capture a screenshot
on an iOS device,

00:33:22.746 --> 00:33:25.816 A:middle
press and release the Power
and Home button together.

00:33:25.966 --> 00:33:28.356 A:middle
And that should save
the screenshot

00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:29.976 A:middle
as a photo in your photos app.

00:33:30.116 --> 00:33:33.636 A:middle
So you can go about retrieving
it using the usual ways

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:35.906 A:middle
of either emailing it or
syncing it with iTunes.

00:33:35.906 --> 00:33:40.396 A:middle
There's an alternate
way you can use which is

00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:41.976 A:middle
to use the Xcode Organizer.

00:33:42.856 --> 00:33:46.116 A:middle
So select the screenshots tab
from the left inside panel

00:33:46.896 --> 00:33:49.466 A:middle
and then use the new
screenshot button at the bottom.

00:33:50.016 --> 00:33:54.886 A:middle
If you want to capture
a screenshot on OS X,

00:33:54.926 --> 00:33:57.296 A:middle
there are few different
commands depending

00:33:57.296 --> 00:33:58.796 A:middle
on what is it that
you want to do.

00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:02.666 A:middle
To capture the full screen,
use Command+Shift and 3.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:02.666 A:middle
To capture the full screen,
use Command+Shift and 3.

00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:07.106 A:middle
To capture a part of the
screen use Command+Shift and 4,

00:34:07.806 --> 00:34:10.176 A:middle
and just specific window,
this is actually handy,

00:34:10.525 --> 00:34:12.746 A:middle
Command+Shift+4, and
then press the spacebar.

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:16.686 A:middle
All these shortcuts save
an image on your desktop

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.766 A:middle
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.

00:34:20.216 --> 00:34:25.106 A:middle
You know sometimes
screenshots are not good enough.

00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:28.676 A:middle
Perhaps you're trying to
describe a sequence of events

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:31.656 A:middle
or a bad animation or
something being slow.

00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:35.255 A:middle
In all these cases screen
recordings are great.

00:34:35.846 --> 00:34:40.706 A:middle
To capture a screen recording on
OS X, launch QuickTime Player,

00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.596 A:middle
select the New Screen Recording
option from the File menu,

00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:48.226 A:middle
select the start recording
button, reproduce the issue,

00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:52.146 A:middle
stop the recording you should
have a movie file you can very

00:34:52.146 --> 00:34:53.485 A:middle
easily attach to
your bug report.

00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:54.556 A:middle
This will be great.

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.746 A:middle
Next up are snapshots.

00:34:59.686 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
You know, snapshots are
essentially a state snapshot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.686 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
You know, snapshots are
essentially a state snapshot

00:35:03.526 --> 00:35:05.656 A:middle
of all the processes
that we're running

00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:07.906 A:middle
at the time the snapshot
was captured.

00:35:08.866 --> 00:35:12.696 A:middle
So if you run into a performance
issue on an iOS device.

00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:14.626 A:middle
If something is slow

00:35:14.626 --> 00:35:17.236 A:middle
or something is just
stacked doing some task,

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.176 A:middle
capture a snapshot.

00:35:19.176 --> 00:35:22.536 A:middle
In fact capture multiple
snapshots because since each

00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:26.036 A:middle
of these is a snapshot, we
might need multiple to figure

00:35:26.036 --> 00:35:28.456 A:middle
out what is exactly
causing the slowness.

00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:33.816 A:middle
So to capture a snapshot
on an iOS device,

00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:37.626 A:middle
press and release one
of the volume buttons

00:35:37.916 --> 00:35:39.186 A:middle
and the home button together.

00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:42.406 A:middle
This should create a
log file on your device

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
and use the same ways of
retrieval as a crash log.

00:35:47.096 --> 00:35:49.656 A:middle
So connect to your device,
to your host machine,

00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:53.516 A:middle
sync it with iTunes and
look under the same location

00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:55.426 A:middle
as you would for a crash log.

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.836 A:middle
The log file will be
prefixed with the word stacks

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
and will contain the timestamp

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
and will contain the timestamp

00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:03.296 A:middle
from when the problem
had happened.

00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:07.836 A:middle
If you run into performance
issues

00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:11.816 A:middle
on OS X capture sample logs.

00:36:11.966 --> 00:36:13.416 A:middle
So if you notice
something is slow

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:17.116 A:middle
or something is just stack doing
something, capture sample logs.

00:36:17.486 --> 00:36:21.496 A:middle
So launch your terminal window
and run sample with the name

00:36:21.496 --> 00:36:24.756 A:middle
of the application or process
that is behaving poorly.

00:36:25.546 --> 00:36:26.886 A:middle
Now that should all put a file

00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:29.596 A:middle
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.

00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:33.676 A:middle
Another great tool
that is available

00:36:33.676 --> 00:36:35.026 A:middle
on OS X is sysdiagnose.

00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:39.066 A:middle
So, if you run into a
system performance issue

00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:41.766 A:middle
on OS X this will capture a lot

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
of very useful state
information.

00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:46.656 A:middle
So launch your terminal
window, type in sysdiagnose,

00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:48.586 A:middle
take a few minutes to run.

00:36:49.216 --> 00:36:53.086 A:middle
But by the end of it, you'll
have a collection of rich logs

00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:55.216 A:middle
that you can attach
to your bug report.

00:36:55.686 --> 00:37:01.896 A:middle
I have to admit, this is a lot
of work and it's probably going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:55.686 --> 00:37:01.896 A:middle
I have to admit, this is a lot
of work and it's probably going

00:37:01.896 --> 00:37:02.746 A:middle
to take a lot of time.

00:37:03.836 --> 00:37:07.056 A:middle
But even though collecting
this information,

00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:09.376 A:middle
sort of making the
sample project

00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:13.846 A:middle
or attaching these logs they
might be optional in some ways,

00:37:14.726 --> 00:37:17.666 A:middle
you might still want to spend
the time collecting this.

00:37:17.966 --> 00:37:22.406 A:middle
And let me convince you by
bringing back the good old time

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.696 A:middle
versus probability graph.

00:37:24.396 --> 00:37:27.666 A:middle
You see when you attached
this additional information,

00:37:27.816 --> 00:37:29.806 A:middle
[inaudible] sort of moves up.

00:37:31.936 --> 00:37:34.286 A:middle
The chance is that
the bug will get fixed

00:37:34.346 --> 00:37:35.546 A:middle
for that particular release.

00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:38.376 A:middle
It goes up because
it's much easier for us

00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:40.806 A:middle
to understand the
seriousness of the issue.

00:37:41.196 --> 00:37:43.756 A:middle
Understand the issue
itself as well.

00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:47.866 A:middle
So the next time you're filing
a bug report, think about it,

00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:51.776 A:middle
whether to spend that extra
time collecting this information

00:37:52.726 --> 00:37:54.276 A:middle
in order to improve the chances.

00:37:54.766 --> 00:38:00.586 A:middle
With that, let's talk about
the configuration information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:54.766 --> 00:38:00.586 A:middle
With that, let's talk about
the configuration information

00:38:00.616 --> 00:38:02.106 A:middle
component of a bug report.

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:06.186 A:middle
Use this section to
specify the software

00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:09.486 A:middle
and the hardware configuration
of the device or the machine

00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:10.886 A:middle
where you saw this problem.

00:38:12.176 --> 00:38:15.846 A:middle
So in iOS, this would be the
hardware model and version,

00:38:16.686 --> 00:38:18.506 A:middle
the exact software version.

00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:22.096 A:middle
Now, remember, sync iOS 6
is generally not good enough

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.236 A:middle
because we shift
many different builds

00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:26.206 A:middle
of iOS 6 in the last year.

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:29.256 A:middle
So, to find out the
exact version,

00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:33.266 A:middle
launch the settings app,
navigate to General-About

00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:35.286 A:middle
and look under the
version field.

00:38:35.286 --> 00:38:38.846 A:middle
You should find the exact string
corresponding to the build.

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:43.446 A:middle
Also if there was any
other hardware involved

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:46.856 A:middle
in this problem that you
saw specify information

00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:47.636 A:middle
about that as well.

00:38:47.906 --> 00:38:53.876 A:middle
On OS X the best way to capture
configuration information is

00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:55.946 A:middle
to use the system
information report.

00:38:56.256 --> 00:38:59.396 A:middle
And our online documentation
has some excellent steps

00:38:59.396 --> 00:39:01.776 A:middle
on how you can go about
collecting this information.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.396 --> 00:39:01.776 A:middle
on how you can go about
collecting this information.

00:39:02.276 --> 00:39:05.516 A:middle
Last component, we're
going to talk

00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.456 A:middle
about is the reproducibility
section.

00:39:07.456 --> 00:39:11.516 A:middle
Use this section to
specify how often is it

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:12.576 A:middle
that you see the problem.

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:13.916 A:middle
Do you see it always?

00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:16.756 A:middle
Did it only happen once
and you never were able

00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:17.926 A:middle
to reproduce it again?

00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:21.346 A:middle
Even if you did not try
to reproduce the issue,

00:39:21.846 --> 00:39:25.136 A:middle
still tell us about that because
that is still a relevant piece

00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:25.966 A:middle
of information.

00:39:27.026 --> 00:39:28.996 A:middle
With that, we have
reached the end

00:39:28.996 --> 00:39:30.776 A:middle
of the bug reporting section.

00:39:31.156 --> 00:39:32.376 A:middle
But let's recap what we learned.

00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:35.576 A:middle
We talked about why bug
reports are important.

00:39:36.236 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
They are a direct communication
channel between you

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:42.136 A:middle
and an Apple engineer
so that you can tell us

00:39:42.136 --> 00:39:44.516 A:middle
about the issues you've been
running into with our software

00:39:44.926 --> 00:39:47.386 A:middle
and we can address
those appropriately.

00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:49.766 A:middle
These bug reports are read

00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:53.316 A:middle
and very diligently
tracked by Apple engineers.

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:56.986 A:middle
The timing is important in
filing these bug reports.

00:39:57.346 --> 00:39:59.266 A:middle
So file as early as possible.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:04.476 A:middle
Also start off with well
written actionable bug reports

00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:08.226 A:middle
that are clear, concise,
succinct,

00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:10.116 A:middle
informative and constructive.

00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:13.156 A:middle
We also talked about a few
things you should keep in mind

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.986 A:middle
to improve the chances
of your bug getting fixed

00:40:16.176 --> 00:40:17.086 A:middle
in a particular release.

00:40:17.756 --> 00:40:20.696 A:middle
With that, I like to hand it
over to Ted who's going to talk

00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.716 A:middle
to us about Developer
Technical Support.

00:40:22.716 --> 00:40:23.236 A:middle
Thank you.

00:40:24.516 --> 00:40:26.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:28.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Tanya.

00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.486 A:middle
So, I'm Ted Jucevic.

00:40:31.486 --> 00:40:32.766 A:middle
And I'm here to talk to you

00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:38.956 A:middle
about Developer Technical
Support.

00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:46.986 A:middle
So, Developer Technical
Support or DTS is a organization

00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:52.466 A:middle
of engineers that provide one
to one support of public APIs

00:40:53.296 --> 00:40:57.906 A:middle
through email with a guaranteed
response for developers

00:40:57.906 --> 00:41:03.466 A:middle
of our iOS, OS X and
MFi developer programs.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.906 --> 00:41:03.466 A:middle
of our iOS, OS X and
MFi developer programs.

00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:04.926 A:middle
So, if you have question
about how

00:41:04.926 --> 00:41:08.466 A:middle
to integrate an Apple
technology or you have a bug

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:12.526 A:middle
in your app you can't resolve,
or a code level question related

00:41:12.526 --> 00:41:16.256 A:middle
to the development of your iOS
app, Mac app or MFi accessory,

00:41:16.886 --> 00:41:20.376 A:middle
we can help by providing
best practice guidance on how

00:41:20.376 --> 00:41:22.616 A:middle
to use our APIs and
troubleshoot.

00:41:23.546 --> 00:41:26.176 A:middle
So, when should you contact DTS?

00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:28.076 A:middle
Before you contact DTS,

00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:31.506 A:middle
make sure you've read the
relevant documentation.

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.676 A:middle
You've checked on
the forums to see

00:41:33.676 --> 00:41:37.146 A:middle
if your question has already
been answered by somebody else.

00:41:37.546 --> 00:41:39.976 A:middle
Write some test code.

00:41:40.436 --> 00:41:43.496 A:middle
And if appropriate,
do post your question

00:41:43.496 --> 00:41:44.706 A:middle
to the developer forums.

00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:50.276 A:middle
But if you still need help
after you've exhausted all

00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:52.976 A:middle
of the resources, contact DTS.

00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:58.556 A:middle
So, you've decided that
you're going to contact DTS.

00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:01.766 A:middle
To do that, what
you need to do is go

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:01.766 A:middle
To do that, what
you need to do is go

00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:05.576 A:middle
to
developer.apple.com/membercenter

00:42:06.186 --> 00:42:07.766 A:middle
and click on the technical link

00:42:08.456 --> 00:42:10.476 A:middle
in the developer
support section.

00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:13.646 A:middle
This will take you to a page
where you can request help.

00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:17.906 A:middle
Fill out and submit the
technical support web form.

00:42:18.676 --> 00:42:21.616 A:middle
And all follow up
correspondences

00:42:21.616 --> 00:42:23.286 A:middle
with DTS will be through email.

00:42:24.056 --> 00:42:28.066 A:middle
So, we need a lot of the same
information that is required

00:42:28.306 --> 00:42:29.966 A:middle
when filing a bug report.

00:42:31.106 --> 00:42:32.596 A:middle
An Xcode sample project,

00:42:34.126 --> 00:42:37.256 A:middle
Symbolicated Crash
Logs are all important.

00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:43.436 A:middle
Now, Symbolicated Crash Logs are
crash logs that have the symbols

00:42:44.036 --> 00:42:45.656 A:middle
so the memory addresses,

00:42:46.056 --> 00:42:49.276 A:middle
translated into human
readable function names

00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:50.346 A:middle
and my [phonetic] numbers.

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:54.836 A:middle
Many times after somebody had
some Symbolicated Crash Log,

00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:58.016 A:middle
they look at it and they
can actually figure out how

00:42:58.016 --> 00:42:59.286 A:middle
to solve the problem themselves.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.106 --> 00:43:02.836 A:middle
If not, when you
submit the support

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:05.916 A:middle
for request make sure you
include the Symbolicated Crash

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:11.126 A:middle
Log because if you have a
crash, we're going to need one.

00:43:11.286 --> 00:43:15.276 A:middle
So, I've told you about what
DTS does, how to contact DTS

00:43:15.576 --> 00:43:16.526 A:middle
and how to work with us.

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:23.826 A:middle
Let me start off or end this
part by giving you some answers

00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:26.656 A:middle
to some common questions
that we get in DTS.

00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:28.866 A:middle
So, all these answers
are actually

00:43:28.866 --> 00:43:31.236 A:middle
in technical note
documents that we've written.

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:35.976 A:middle
For example, the ones that
are list on this slide are

00:43:35.976 --> 00:43:41.246 A:middle
on the iOS Reference Library
for you to-- you can find 24/7.

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:46.686 A:middle
The first one, iOS Debugging
Magic has a relative information

00:43:46.816 --> 00:43:49.336 A:middle
for both new and
expert developers

00:43:49.336 --> 00:43:51.396 A:middle
who are debugging
iOS applications.

00:43:51.846 --> 00:43:54.266 A:middle
And it's one that I would
highly recommend reading

00:43:54.266 --> 00:43:59.576 A:middle
if you have started debugging
your app, or your about to.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:01.956 A:middle
The second one, understanding

00:44:01.956 --> 00:44:04.476 A:middle
and analyzing iOS
application crash reports.

00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:08.276 A:middle
It's important because
it explains to you how

00:44:08.276 --> 00:44:12.896 A:middle
to symbolicate your crash logs
and also gives information

00:44:12.896 --> 00:44:15.756 A:middle
about common exceptions
or other information

00:44:16.266 --> 00:44:18.786 A:middle
about what may be
causing your crash.

00:44:19.626 --> 00:44:22.016 A:middle
The rest of these are also
important, I'm not going to go

00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:25.536 A:middle
into them for time, but
make sure, you know,

00:44:26.056 --> 00:44:27.396 A:middle
they're worth your
time to read them.

00:44:27.896 --> 00:44:31.216 A:middle
On the OS X side, we have
some similar documents set

00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:33.266 A:middle
that I also recommend
you take a look at,

00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:35.886 A:middle
if you're working on
an app on the Mac.

00:44:37.096 --> 00:44:40.516 A:middle
The Mac OS X Debugging Magic
is like the iOS version

00:44:41.016 --> 00:44:44.236 A:middle
where it has a treasure trove
of information for both novice

00:44:44.236 --> 00:44:47.916 A:middle
and expert developers, and
then of course the second one,

00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:50.536 A:middle
how to reproduce bugs report
against a Mac App Store.

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:53.876 A:middle
Well, the title kind of explains
it completely for itself.

00:44:54.496 --> 00:44:56.876 A:middle
So, thank you very much.

00:44:57.246 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
With that let me hand
you back to Nahir.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.246 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
With that let me hand
you back to Nahir.

00:45:03.906 --> 00:45:07.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So now, you've made your
app, got all the help you need

00:45:07.106 --> 00:45:09.256 A:middle
and you want to get to
it to your customers.

00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:13.666 A:middle
And you put it on the Mac App
Store or the iOS App Store.

00:45:14.326 --> 00:45:17.456 A:middle
So for that let's go on that.

00:45:18.086 --> 00:45:20.426 A:middle
First one is the section
that we're going to talk

00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:21.376 A:middle
about is the App Store.

00:45:21.446 --> 00:45:24.596 A:middle
So, we have a whole page for
developers at developer.com--

00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:27.046 A:middle
developer.apple.com/appstore.

00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:30.046 A:middle
And this is where you can learn
about our approval process

00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:33.626 A:middle
and exactly what we go about
when we're actually trying

00:45:33.626 --> 00:45:35.356 A:middle
to approve your app
to get on the Store.

00:45:36.456 --> 00:45:37.716 A:middle
There's also where
you can and figure

00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:38.936 A:middle
out what the guidelines are

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.766 A:middle
on what's actually
allowed in the Store.

00:45:41.626 --> 00:45:44.086 A:middle
I recommend you check that out.

00:45:44.686 --> 00:45:46.476 A:middle
We all have some other
cool stuff here as well.

00:45:46.476 --> 00:45:48.726 A:middle
So, if you've ever been on a
website and you've seen those

00:45:48.726 --> 00:45:51.376 A:middle
on the iOS or on
the App Store links,

00:45:51.646 --> 00:45:54.416 A:middle
or you've seen this really
nice product images for our--

00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:56.416 A:middle
some of our products, you
can actually download all

00:45:56.416 --> 00:45:57.446 A:middle
that on this website.

00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:00.236 A:middle
You can get full
pictures of our products,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:00.236 A:middle
You can get full
pictures of our products,

00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:01.316 A:middle
you can get to those links.

00:46:01.756 --> 00:46:03.986 A:middle
And we also have some guidelines
on how these things are going

00:46:03.986 --> 00:46:06.606 A:middle
to be used, so check that out.

00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:09.356 A:middle
There's also a really
nice contact form here,

00:46:09.356 --> 00:46:11.016 A:middle
if you have any questions
for the App Store.

00:46:11.486 --> 00:46:12.676 A:middle
So, I [inaudible] with
all these other ways,

00:46:12.676 --> 00:46:14.676 A:middle
there's one single
place you can go

00:46:14.676 --> 00:46:17.836 A:middle
for all your communication
with the App Store.

00:46:18.056 --> 00:46:20.536 A:middle
So, on this page, you can
get the status of your app.

00:46:20.596 --> 00:46:22.086 A:middle
So, if you've put it
in and you're trying

00:46:22.086 --> 00:46:23.826 A:middle
to see what's going
on, what's going

00:46:23.826 --> 00:46:25.406 A:middle
to review process,
this is where you go.

00:46:25.546 --> 00:46:28.516 A:middle
This is also where we
can get some-- get--

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:31.616 A:middle
give us some clarification on
an app if it's got rejected.

00:46:31.686 --> 00:46:32.786 A:middle
Maybe someone miss something.

00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:35.936 A:middle
The app reviewers are people
and sometimes we make mistakes.

00:46:35.936 --> 00:46:37.986 A:middle
So this is where we can
also know what happened.

00:46:38.426 --> 00:46:41.506 A:middle
If your app has been rejected,
there's also where you can go

00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:43.946 A:middle
to start off with the
appeal process, because just

00:46:43.946 --> 00:46:46.986 A:middle
because your app has been
rejected doesn't mean they'll

00:46:46.986 --> 00:46:48.196 A:middle
never be allowed
in the App Store.

00:46:48.656 --> 00:46:51.076 A:middle
We can work together to get
back in there or get in there.

00:46:52.596 --> 00:46:56.096 A:middle
This is also where you go to
get an expedited app review.

00:46:56.766 --> 00:46:59.766 A:middle
So, if you have an app in
the App Store right now

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:00.026 --> 00:47:03.716 A:middle
and you notice there's a very
horrible crash and you needed

00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:06.446 A:middle
to get it out there, that's
where you can go to start that.

00:47:06.586 --> 00:47:10.306 A:middle
Now, just as warning, you can
do that for every single one

00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:13.466 A:middle
of your submissions to the App
Store because we kind of catch

00:47:13.466 --> 00:47:15.066 A:middle
on to that and we're
going to allow that.

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:18.156 A:middle
This is also where you can go to
provide requested information.

00:47:18.506 --> 00:47:22.396 A:middle
So, say we want to host
your app or feature it,

00:47:22.396 --> 00:47:24.626 A:middle
this is where you can add some
information for there as well.

00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:28.156 A:middle
Next we're going
to iTunes Connect.

00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:31.576 A:middle
And I'm sure many of
you are very familiar

00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
with iTunes Connect.

00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:36.066 A:middle
This is where you go
to handle everything

00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:39.376 A:middle
about managing your app and
the business of your app.

00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:41.686 A:middle
This is where you can go
on to see your sales trends

00:47:41.686 --> 00:47:42.736 A:middle
to see what's going on there.

00:47:42.736 --> 00:47:46.046 A:middle
This is also where you can go to
setup all your contracts and all

00:47:46.046 --> 00:47:47.586 A:middle
of your little tax information

00:47:47.586 --> 00:47:48.906 A:middle
and all the other
stuff that you can do.

00:47:48.906 --> 00:47:52.616 A:middle
This is also where can go to
setup iAd and all those stuff

00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:55.736 A:middle
that you need to get
ready to have ads in

00:47:55.976 --> 00:47:57.096 A:middle
and deal with the ad process.

00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:02.316 A:middle
And also you can go in to
get In-App purchases and how

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:02.316 A:middle
And also you can go in to
get In-App purchases and how

00:48:02.316 --> 00:48:03.706 A:middle
to set those things up as well.

00:48:04.206 --> 00:48:07.396 A:middle
Now, iTunes Mac is huge

00:48:07.716 --> 00:48:09.996 A:middle
and there's some questions
that you might have.

00:48:10.656 --> 00:48:12.656 A:middle
So, there is a frequently
asked questions phase there

00:48:12.726 --> 00:48:14.136 A:middle
and I highly recommend
you check it out.

00:48:14.136 --> 00:48:15.906 A:middle
There are a lot of
good information here

00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:17.926 A:middle
and you have a question there's
a very good chance that's

00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:18.716 A:middle
answered right there.

00:48:18.716 --> 00:48:23.976 A:middle
But if you don't want to go
through, you can also check

00:48:23.976 --> 00:48:25.216 A:middle
out the Contact Us Page.

00:48:25.446 --> 00:48:27.806 A:middle
And it's kind of nice because
got to hold drill down menu.

00:48:28.596 --> 00:48:32.406 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm Canadian
actually, so I'm trying

00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:35.306 A:middle
to figure out what's going on
to get my, like Canadian deals

00:48:35.306 --> 00:48:38.336 A:middle
and tax information and all
that, I can actually go in there

00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:40.026 A:middle
and say, oh, I will
have something

00:48:40.026 --> 00:48:43.666 A:middle
with the tax information and
I'm for-- kind the tax forms.

00:48:43.666 --> 00:48:45.726 A:middle
And it tells me exactly
what I am to do

00:48:45.826 --> 00:48:47.236 A:middle
and where I can get
more information.

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.316 A:middle
It also gives me some related
frequently asked questions

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:51.926 A:middle
pages, so you can
check that out as well.

00:48:52.486 --> 00:49:00.006 A:middle
Now, iTunes Connect as I
mentioned is a very large area,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:52.486 --> 00:49:00.006 A:middle
Now, iTunes Connect as I
mentioned is a very large area,

00:49:00.006 --> 00:49:03.736 A:middle
so we actually have gigantic
guidelines here, both for iOS

00:49:03.786 --> 00:49:09.046 A:middle
and Mac developers and I highly
recommend you check these out.

00:49:09.396 --> 00:49:10.896 A:middle
They go step by step on how

00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:15.706 A:middle
to do multiple different
things in iTunes Connect.

00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:22.316 A:middle
So with that, coming to the end
of our presentation, so today,

00:49:22.846 --> 00:49:25.086 A:middle
hopefully we got a
bit of understanding

00:49:25.086 --> 00:49:26.966 A:middle
of all the different developer
resources that are available

00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:30.186 A:middle
to you and when you
should actually use them.

00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:34.976 A:middle
So we went over, saw the ones
that are great for helping--

00:49:34.976 --> 00:49:38.796 A:middle
getting help yourself,
also a bunch of resources

00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:39.916 A:middle
when you're working with Apple

00:49:40.726 --> 00:49:43.446 A:middle
and also all the
resources available to you

00:49:43.506 --> 00:49:47.146 A:middle
for when you are
deploying your app.

00:49:47.406 --> 00:49:51.126 A:middle
We also went in-depth into
the importance of bug reports.

00:49:51.706 --> 00:49:53.256 A:middle
We gave you a little
behind scenes of what goes

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:55.636 A:middle
on with Apple engineers
when we're looking at them

00:49:55.636 --> 00:49:58.336 A:middle
and we gave you some
really good tips on how

00:49:58.336 --> 00:49:59.586 A:middle
to file some really great ones.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:00.196 --> 00:50:04.436 A:middle
We got some links here about
some of the places or some

00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:05.686 A:middle
of the things that we discuss.

00:50:05.886 --> 00:50:07.626 A:middle
So your dev forums, app review,

00:50:08.466 --> 00:50:14.206 A:middle
etc. And here's some
excellent links

00:50:14.256 --> 00:50:20.036 A:middle
to some technical tech notes
that Jed had mentioned, Ted.

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:24.036 A:middle
And here's some for
the OS X as well.

00:50:24.196 --> 00:50:26.706 A:middle
I hope you've had
a wonderful WWDC.

00:50:26.706 --> 00:50:28.906 A:middle
I hope to see you
guys again soon.

00:50:29.516 --> 00:50:32.500 A:middle
