&gt;&gt; James Howard: Whoops.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:16.556 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:19.486 A:middle
Thank you all for
coming at 9:00 a.m. here.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:21.086 A:middle
I know that's a little
early for programmers

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.066 A:middle
or at least it is for me.

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:24.846 A:middle
This is what's new in Map Kit.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:26.176 A:middle
I'm James Howard.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:30.916 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on
the Maps Team and let's begin.

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:34.456 A:middle
So, we have a lot to cover here
and I'm going to go quickly.

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:35.606 A:middle
So, hold on to your hats.

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:39.186 A:middle
Our first topic and the
one that I'm most excited

00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:42.436 A:middle
about is Map Kit on OS X.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:46.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:49.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We've also got some updates
to Map Kit for the new UI.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:53.706 A:middle
So, we're going to
talk about that.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.476 A:middle
New Perspectives: We've got
new ways to look at the Map.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:59.906 A:middle
We've got a 3D mode that
you can use in Map Kit

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:03.646 A:middle
and we've also got the ability
to span around the 180th radian,

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:05.666 A:middle
so these change the way that
you can set the view port

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:05.956 A:middle
on the Map.

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:07.286 A:middle
We're going to discuss that.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
There's new Overlays
Functionality in iOS 7 and also

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.996 A:middle
on Mac OS X and there's
quite a lot of this.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:19.096 A:middle
There's a ability to put
overlays underneath labels.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.466 A:middle
So, if you have a polyline or
a polygon and you want to put

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.986 A:middle
that underneath the
labeling on the Map

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.106 A:middle
to enhance readability
you can do that.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:29.116 A:middle
We've got the ability to do new
tiled overlays so if you have

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:31.856 A:middle
like a raster image pyramid and
you want to place that on top

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:33.406 A:middle
of the Map you can do that.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.706 A:middle
We've got the ability to replace
the built-in Apple Map data

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:38.906 A:middle
with your own data via overlays

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:40.926 A:middle
and we've got a geodesic
polyline.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:42.926 A:middle
So, that's new to Overlays
Functionality and we're going

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:43.866 A:middle
to get into that
in a little bit.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.886 A:middle
We've got a search API, so
this is for doing local search.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:52.916 A:middle
So, finding locations via a
query string we can do that now.

00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:56.216 A:middle
And we've also got
a Directions API.

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:04.996 A:middle
So, with that outlined let's
talk about Map Kit for OS X.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:04.996 A:middle
So, with that outlined let's
talk about Map Kit for OS X.

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:06.996 A:middle
Here it is.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.295 A:middle
We have an NP Map view
and an NS Window running

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:11.216 A:middle
on Mac OS X there.

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:14.106 A:middle
And what are the features?

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:15.546 A:middle
So, it's just like iOS.

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:21.526 A:middle
We managed to get parody between
iOS and Mac OS X for Map Kit.

00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:23.426 A:middle
We've got basically
the same API.

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:28.076 A:middle
So, we have MKMapView on OS X
and the difference between it

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:30.196 A:middle
and iOS is basically just
that' it's an NSView.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:31.556 A:middle
We have all the same things.

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:33.266 A:middle
We have annotations if
you want to put a point

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.066 A:middle
of interest on the Map.

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:37.686 A:middle
The Annotation views are NS
views instead of UI views

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:38.896 A:middle
but they are other
otherwise the same.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:41.326 A:middle
We've got Overlays so you
can put areas of interest

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:43.506 A:middle
on your Map and we've
also got the Local Search

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.416 A:middle
and Directions API,
so it's just like OS X

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:47.736 A:middle
or just like iOS on OS X.

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.196 A:middle
There are some small
differences in terms of the UI

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:56.206 A:middle
so here we have a window showing
a MapView with Annotation on it.

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:57.256 A:middle
One thing you can notice is

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:59.526 A:middle
in the lower right there
there's a plus and minus

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.606 A:middle
and a compass control so you
can use these to interact

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.606 A:middle
and a compass control so you
can use these to interact

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:04.166 A:middle
with the Map via a
mouse and you can show

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.176 A:middle
or hide these with a API.

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.826 A:middle
And we have this Map
data attribution label

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:09.766 A:middle
in the lower left.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:13.276 A:middle
This is basically
what you have on iOS.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.596 A:middle
Don't, don't obscure this thing.

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:17.056 A:middle
We need it there
for legal reasons.

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:20.536 A:middle
And the finally the callouts
that call it that says,

00:03:20.536 --> 00:03:21.446 A:middle
"Hello World" there on the map.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:25.926 A:middle
That is on the side so it can be
on either the right or the left

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:27.086 A:middle
where in iOS it's on the top,

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.556 A:middle
but otherwise it has
the same functionality.

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.616 A:middle
You can set a left
and a right view on it

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:33.566 A:middle
and you can also set
a subtitle on it.

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:37.696 A:middle
The other thing about this
is it's available for apps

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:40.646 A:middle
in the Mac App Store so you have
to code sign it and you have

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:43.176 A:middle
to put this entitlement on
it: com.apple.developer.maps.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:46.936 A:middle
And you can turn this on via the
Capabilities page in Xcode 5.

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:49.616 A:middle
And the thing I'll say about
this is it's not on in seed one,

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:52.796 A:middle
so you can-- we're not
enforcing this at the moment

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:54.636 A:middle
but in the next seed we
are going to enforce this.

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.306 A:middle
So, it's something you
need to be aware of.

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:59.676 A:middle
And with that let's do a
demo and I'm going to invite

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:02.726 A:middle
up Alexander Carlhian up
on stage to do this demo.

a big round of applause

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:05.726 A:middle
because if it wasn't

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:07.666 A:middle
for Alexander we wouldn't
have Map Kit on OS X.

&gt;&gt; Alexander Carlhian:
Good morning everyone.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.646 A:middle
My name is Alexander
Carlhian and today I would

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:21.106 A:middle
like to give you an overview of
the main Map Kit APIs on OS X.

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:23.236 A:middle
How many of you have
used Map Kit in iOS?

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:28.526 A:middle
Good, so for you guys this is
going to sound like a refresher,

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:32.066 A:middle
but for the other guys it's
going to be brand new APIs.

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:35.976 A:middle
So, for today let's just pretend
I am a software developer

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:39.756 A:middle
working for a coffee company
that own a few places in Paris

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.936 A:middle
and I would like to extend
my existing application

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.096 A:middle
to add MapView.

00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:45.496 A:middle
So, how do I do that?

00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:49.136 A:middle
Well, we can start with
something really easy,

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:54.126 A:middle
just within Xcode we added a
new object called MKMapView.

00:04:54.726 --> 00:05:02.496 A:middle
I can just drag it into my
view, resize, simple right?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:54.726 --> 00:05:02.496 A:middle
I can just drag it into my
view, resize, simple right?

00:05:02.796 --> 00:05:07.096 A:middle
Just, let's just
run-- here it is.

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:09.956 A:middle
I have my window
and my map view.

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:13.546 A:middle
Good, so the next thing I
would like to do I would

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:17.896 A:middle
like to add controls for
zooming, for compass and I would

00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:19.706 A:middle
like to set the region to Paris.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:23.406 A:middle
So, let's start by adding the
compass and the zoom controls.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:27.016 A:middle
So, this is pretty easy.

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:30.036 A:middle
You can just set shows compass
and shows zoom controls,

00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:32.206 A:middle
set the property to
yes and that's it.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:38.286 A:middle
If you want to set the region
you need to set a coordinate

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:42.206 A:middle
which is a long lat
and set the radius

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.286 A:middle
to create an MK coordinate
region.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:50.516 A:middle
So, the coordinate is a
long lat and the regions is

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.576 A:middle
in meters here, so
that's 10 kilometers.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:56.086 A:middle
And just set the region using
set region on the map view.

00:05:57.026 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
Let's run again.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:02.566 A:middle
So you can see Paris.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:02.566 A:middle
So you can see Paris.

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:03.716 A:middle
You can see the compass.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.236 A:middle
I can tilt pushing up or down.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:07.176 A:middle
I can rotate.

00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:13.136 A:middle
I can zoom in and
zoom out, good.

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:17.136 A:middle
So, the next thing is to add
pin for each of my coffee place.

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:24.726 A:middle
To do that I create three
instances of MKPoint annotation

00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:29.786 A:middle
by setting coordinate,
setting an optional title.

00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:32.336 A:middle
I do it for each
of my coffee place

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:35.626 A:middle
and I can add the
annotations on my MapView

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:38.426 A:middle
in a single call
using addAnnotations:.

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:39.766 A:middle
Let's run again.

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:44.986 A:middle
I can see now that I have my
three red pins on the map.

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:47.006 A:middle
That's great.

00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:47.786 A:middle
That's great start.

00:06:48.966 --> 00:06:51.886 A:middle
Well, you know what I want
to give a distinct look

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.836 A:middle
to my application so I like
to customize this red pin

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.576 A:middle
to look something else,
something different,

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.586 A:middle
remember that is a coffee place.

00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.956 A:middle
So, I'm going to add
an image to my project.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.956 A:middle
So, I'm going to add
an image to my project.

00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:05.536 A:middle
[ Silence ]

00:07:06.036 --> 00:07:06.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This image.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:13.256 A:middle
And I'm going to add a subclass
of my MKPinAnnotationView.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.586 A:middle
Called MyAnnotationView

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:20.426 A:middle
and designated initializer
I just call super

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:24.566 A:middle
and load the image and just
set the image and that's it.

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:25.876 A:middle
You just need to set the image.

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:30.946 A:middle
Next thing you need to do is
to actually tell the MapView

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:34.516 A:middle
that you want to use instance
of your custom annotation view.

00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
So, first you set the
delegate of your MapView

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:42.306 A:middle
and you implement this
delegate method here.

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:44.206 A:middle
-mapView:viewForAnnotation:.

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:47.376 A:middle
Here you can just
create one more instance

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:49.906 A:middle
of your annotation
view and return it.

00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:51.146 A:middle
Alright, let's run.

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:56.446 A:middle
And you can see that the
red pins have been replaced

00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:57.326 A:middle
by my image, pretty easy.

00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
Alright, so the next step
will be to add a callout.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
Alright, so the next step
will be to add a callout.

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.996 A:middle
A callout is like a popover that
pops next to the pin annotation.

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:11.336 A:middle
So to do that you in
annotation view you can call

00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:14.696 A:middle
-setCanShowCallout: and
set this property to yes.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:17.666 A:middle
Well, I've changed the image

00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:20.116 A:middle
to have a slightly
bigger pin image.

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:23.336 A:middle
So, I need to adjust the
offset of my callouts

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:26.006 A:middle
where the callout would
be anchored on the right

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.376 A:middle
and the left by just
creating a point here

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:30.106 A:middle
and setting the offset.

00:08:31.356 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
So, let's run.

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:37.556 A:middle
If I click on a pin I
can see the callout next

00:08:37.556 --> 00:08:39.306 A:middle
to it with my title.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:43.546 A:middle
That was easy right.

00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:47.046 A:middle
Well, I would like to
customize this callout

00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:50.236 A:middle
to add accessory views,
maybe add a button,

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.096 A:middle
maybe ordering coffee just
by clicking on this button.

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:56.456 A:middle
So, as seen on the
documentation there is a right

00:08:56.566 --> 00:09:01.696 A:middle
and left accessory views
so I'm going to use that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:56.566 --> 00:09:01.696 A:middle
and left accessory views
so I'm going to use that.

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:07.216 A:middle
I'm creating a left button,
which is size 32 x 32 points.

00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:10.176 A:middle
Setting the title,
target an action,

00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:15.676 A:middle
same thing on the right is a
button and I set the target

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:18.686 A:middle
and action to call either
the right click method

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:19.866 A:middle
or left click method.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:23.506 A:middle
I click on run.

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:28.176 A:middle
If I show my callout I can see
now that I have this new button

00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:30.986 A:middle
and if I click on it I can see
the action is correctly fired.

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:35.026 A:middle
Well, it's not exactly what
I want for my application.

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:38.286 A:middle
I would like to customize
this callout to be bigger,

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:39.716 A:middle
to show something
a bit different,

00:09:40.006 --> 00:09:41.056 A:middle
maybe have a bigger button.

00:09:41.886 --> 00:09:43.246 A:middle
So, how do we do that.

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:46.286 A:middle
That's something that you
guys have been asking for iOS

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:48.486 A:middle
and in fact, it has
already been available

00:09:48.846 --> 00:09:50.316 A:middle
since the first mission
of the API.

00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:52.406 A:middle
Just you need to keep in mind

00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:55.566 A:middle
that annotation view is
just a subclass of a view.

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:59.846 A:middle
So, an UIView on iOS
and an NSView on OS X.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:03.656 A:middle
So, something you can do
is just to add a subview

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:06.406 A:middle
when the pin is selected
and remove it

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.526 A:middle
when the pin is unselected.

00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:09.816 A:middle
So, I will show you
how to do that.

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:13.176 A:middle
First, I would like to display
an address inside this callout.

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:16.286 A:middle
So, I'm just adding an
annotation model object here,

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.746 A:middle
which is the subclass
of MKPointAnnotation.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:21.776 A:middle
That just going to hold
the address, no code,

00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:26.726 A:middle
but in the App Delegate I'm
replacing the MKPointAnnotation

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:30.096 A:middle
with my own, MyAnnotation
instance inside the address

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.056 A:middle
for each of my coffee
place here.

00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:36.996 A:middle
So, next thing I'm going to do
is to add a view that's going

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:38.926 A:middle
to be displayed on screen
when I click on the pin.

00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:42.386 A:middle
So, this is just a
subclass of NSView,

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:45.286 A:middle
just basic -drawRect:
to add a background.

00:10:46.786 --> 00:10:48.436 A:middle
The View Controller is
going to load the nib

00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:53.546 A:middle
and inside the nib I'm
just binding my annotation.

00:10:53.746 --> 00:11:02.256 A:middle
I will show you my annotation
title here and address

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:53.746 --> 00:11:02.256 A:middle
I will show you my annotation
title here and address

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:05.456 A:middle
and just add a button.

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:08.196 A:middle
Well I now have a
custom callout so I would

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:10.016 A:middle
like to disable the
default callout.

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:13.266 A:middle
So, remember we enabled
it in the allocation view,

00:11:13.576 --> 00:11:14.876 A:middle
so we're just going
to disable it now

00:11:15.106 --> 00:11:17.126 A:middle
by setting canShowCallout to no.

00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
And the last part is to actually
implement the -setSelected:

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.026 A:middle
method on the annotation view

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:27.816 A:middle
so next time annotation
view is selected is going

00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:29.206 A:middle
to call -setSelected:.

00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:30.476 A:middle
So, I can just call super

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:37.546 A:middle
and when the pin is selected
I'm just going to set the frame

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:40.916 A:middle
of my callout and
just add the subview.

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:41.976 A:middle
Easy right?

00:11:42.496 --> 00:11:46.266 A:middle
And when the pin is unselected,
I want to fade my view

00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:49.606 A:middle
and remove my callout
from the MapView.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:52.796 A:middle
Something you need
to keep in mind is

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.306 A:middle
that we are adding a view
outside of the bounds

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:57.576 A:middle
of the annotation
view of the pin.

00:11:58.076 --> 00:12:00.996 A:middle
So, we need to override the
-hitTest: method to correct that

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.076 --> 00:12:00.996 A:middle
So, we need to override the
-hitTest: method to correct that

00:12:01.496 --> 00:12:05.316 A:middle
and to allow click
to be propagated

00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:06.736 A:middle
to the button inside my callout.

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to run
again one more time.

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:12.886 A:middle
I click on a pin.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:14.306 A:middle
I can see my callout.

00:12:14.336 --> 00:12:19.706 A:middle
I can see the title address and
a button and if I click it fades

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:25.346 A:middle
out and if I click
again on a pin et voila!

00:12:26.006 --> 00:12:29.466 A:middle
So, thank you that
was my MapKit on OSX.

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:33.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:33.806 --> 00:12:35.996 A:middle
I'm really thrilled by this
and I'm looking forward

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:38.506 A:middle
to all your applications
using MapKit in OS X.

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:39.036 A:middle
Thank you.

00:12:39.336 --> 00:12:39.566 A:middle
James.

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:43.376 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:44.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; James Howard:
Thank you Alexander.

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:47.576 A:middle
So, just to recap
what did we see?

00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:52.066 A:middle
We saw how to add Map Kit
to a Mac OS X project.

00:12:52.566 --> 00:12:54.676 A:middle
We saw how to control user
interaction with the map view

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:56.726 A:middle
by adding those zoom
and compass controls.

00:12:57.216 --> 00:12:58.726 A:middle
We saw how to add annotations

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:02.246 A:middle
to the map both the built-in
MKPin annotation view

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:02.246 A:middle
to the map both the built-in
MKPin annotation view

00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:04.586 A:middle
with the red pins and then
the custom annotation views

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.246 A:middle
with the coffee pins.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:08.446 A:middle
And then finally we saw how
to add a custom callout view.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.306 A:middle
So, if you don't like the
built-in one that comes

00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:12.556 A:middle
with Map Kit you need a
little more space or whatever

00:13:12.556 --> 00:13:14.366 A:middle
to show what you need to
show, you can do that.

00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:17.956 A:middle
And that lesson applies
equally well to iOS as Mac OS X.

00:13:19.046 --> 00:13:20.036 A:middle
So, that's Mac OS X.

00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:23.036 A:middle
Let's talk about
what's new in iOS 7.

00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:25.566 A:middle
So, we've got a new UI in iOS 7

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:27.206 A:middle
and there's a new
look for Map Kit.

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:30.496 A:middle
So, the first thing we've
done is we've updated

00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:31.266 A:middle
the cartography.

00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:33.796 A:middle
You can see what we had
on the left there in iOS 6

00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:36.216 A:middle
and what we have on
the right in iOS 7.

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:37.836 A:middle
So, we've improved
the visibility

00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:39.766 A:middle
of the roads especially
the major roads there

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.416 A:middle
and we've improved the
labeling quite a bit as well,

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:44.046 A:middle
so you have quite a lot
more detail on the map.

00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:46.976 A:middle
So, we think this makes
the map a lot more useable.

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:50.436 A:middle
We've also improved
the Hybrid mode

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:52.306 A:middle
so that's the old Hybrid Mode.

00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:53.926 A:middle
This is the new Hybrid Mode.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:56.716 A:middle
I think it's also
a lot more useable.

00:13:57.326 --> 00:14:02.756 A:middle
And we've changed the pins; they
look a little bit different.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.326 --> 00:14:02.756 A:middle
And we've changed the pins; they
look a little bit different.

00:14:02.756 --> 00:14:04.036 A:middle
They're a little-- they've
lost a little weight.

00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:06.356 A:middle
They're a little brighter
than they were before.

00:14:06.356 --> 00:14:08.036 A:middle
But the nice thing about it
is it's the same dimensions

00:14:08.036 --> 00:14:08.446 A:middle
as before.

00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:10.726 A:middle
So, if you were doing any
math based on the geometry

00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:13.406 A:middle
of those pins it's going to
be the same as it was before.

00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:17.636 A:middle
The other thing we've got
is we've got a new callout.

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:19.726 A:middle
So, it's this white
callout now instead

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.466 A:middle
of the black callout
we had in iOS 6.

00:14:22.546 --> 00:14:23.956 A:middle
We've got a new user
location view.

00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:27.306 A:middle
So, this is this white dot
with the colored center.

00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:29.876 A:middle
And if you've noticed
we have a new property

00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:31.626 A:middle
on UIView, which is Tint Color.

00:14:32.006 --> 00:14:35.156 A:middle
If you set that on an
MKMapView it will filter down

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:37.626 A:middle
and effect the user location
view and also the callout.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:43.316 A:middle
So, let's talk about
New Perspectives.

00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:48.466 A:middle
We've got some new ways that you
can look at the map in iOS 7.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.866 A:middle
So, you can now span
the 180th meridian.

00:14:51.546 --> 00:14:53.386 A:middle
So you can do this
either via touch,

00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:56.936 A:middle
you can just start panning West
and pan over the Pacific Ocean

00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:58.916 A:middle
or pan East from
Japan and pan over it.

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:01.246 A:middle
And you can also do this
programmatically via API.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:01.246 A:middle
And you can also do this
programmatically via API.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.096 A:middle
So, just to look at the code
really quickly how could you

00:15:04.096 --> 00:15:04.476 A:middle
do this?

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:06.426 A:middle
One way you could do it is you
could set the centerCoordinate

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:07.026 A:middle
property of the map.

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:10.286 A:middle
So, we'll create a
coordinate at the equator

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:14.696 A:middle
and the 180th meridian
and set that on the map

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:16.246 A:middle
or you can set the
region on the map.

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:18.616 A:middle
Again we'll set the center
of that region to the equator

00:15:18.616 --> 00:15:24.786 A:middle
in the 180th meridian and we'll
use 1000 kilometers both East,

00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:28.396 A:middle
West, North and South
as the delta there

00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:30.576 A:middle
or you can do it by a MapRect.

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:31.666 A:middle
So, those of you
that are familiar

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:33.846 A:middle
with our MapPoint system,

00:15:33.916 --> 00:15:37.326 A:middle
which is a projected coordinate
system, which is proportional

00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:38.966 A:middle
to screen points relative

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.716 A:middle
to the zoom scale you
can do that with MapRect.

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:44.366 A:middle
So, we have MKMapRectWorld
which is the MapRect enclosing

00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:46.556 A:middle
that sort of square
world that we have

00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:47.646 A:middle
in the projected
coordinate system.

00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:51.116 A:middle
But you can actually make
MapRects that intersect that

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.396 A:middle
or go outside the bounds of
that and if you want to do that,

00:15:53.396 --> 00:15:55.206 A:middle
that's fine and set the
visible MapRect this way

00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:56.266 A:middle
and that will work.

00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:59.036 A:middle
So, all of these three things
I showed do the same thing

00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.576 A:middle
and so that's the screenshot
showed on the slide earlier.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.576 A:middle
and so that's the screenshot
showed on the slide earlier.

00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:03.636 A:middle
The other thing you might
want to do is you might want

00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:05.526 A:middle
to enclose pins on the map.

00:16:05.526 --> 00:16:07.556 A:middle
So, suppose we have this
pin here in Sydney and one

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:10.066 A:middle
in Honolulu and we say oh we
want to show both of these.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:13.246 A:middle
So, figure out what would
be the region to span those.

00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:15.076 A:middle
It's kind of a bit
of a weird edge case.

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:16.746 A:middle
So here's the code to do it.

00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:21.056 A:middle
So, suppose we've got two point
annotations, one in Honolulu

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:23.526 A:middle
and one in Sydney and
if you want to look

00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:25.036 A:middle
at the longitude value
for each of those right,

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.796 A:middle
it's nearly 360 degrees apart.

00:16:27.146 --> 00:16:28.526 A:middle
So, if you just naively
said, "Oh,

00:16:28.526 --> 00:16:30.546 A:middle
I'm going to calculate
a longitude delta" right

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:32.306 A:middle
by taking my min longitude
and my max longitude

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:36.616 A:middle
and subtracting the two, you'd
get like you know 354 degrees

00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:38.656 A:middle
or something like
that, 356 degrees.

00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:41.206 A:middle
It would be way more zoomed
out than what you want.

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:44.106 A:middle
So, we have introduced a new
API called showAnnotations

00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:45.486 A:middle
and it makes a list
of annotations

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:47.466 A:middle
and it just does the
work to make sure

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.396 A:middle
that those are enclosed.

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:49.766 A:middle
So, you get that screenshot.

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.266 A:middle
You like that?

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:51.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:51.566 --> 00:16:51.736 A:middle
Good.

00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:54.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:57.316 A:middle
Yea, it's a nice new
convenience that we've got.

00:16:58.506 --> 00:16:59.526 A:middle
We've also got 3D.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:02.096 A:middle
So, you can view maps in 3D.

00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:04.455 A:middle
We've got the Space Needle
here that you can view

00:17:04.455 --> 00:17:06.715 A:middle
so you can view these
buildings that we've got.

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:10.036 A:middle
It's on by default in iOS
7 and also in Mavericks.

00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:12.246 A:middle
So, if you make an MKMap or
you put it in your project

00:17:12.246 --> 00:17:14.396 A:middle
or you recompile your
project you're going to have

00:17:14.396 --> 00:17:16.526 A:middle
to create users to be able
to enter that via a gesture

00:17:16.996 --> 00:17:18.116 A:middle
on those operating systems.

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:21.076 A:middle
And we've got a whole bunch
of APIs for working with 3D,

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:24.126 A:middle
which I'm not going
to cover here.

00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:26.236 A:middle
You should go to the
session this afternoon

00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:29.536 A:middle
in Pacific Heights at 2:00 p.m.
and see everything about 3D.

00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:32.656 A:middle
There's quite a lot to know
and we've got a lot of new APIs

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:35.016 A:middle
around that and it's just too
much to put in this session.

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:36.976 A:middle
So, go to that this
afternoon to learn about 3D.

00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:39.186 A:middle
So, let's talk about
what's new in Overlays.

00:17:39.996 --> 00:17:42.116 A:middle
So, just to run it
down we've got a new

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:43.556 A:middle
class MKOverlayRenderer.

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:45.166 A:middle
This is used to draw overlays.

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.806 A:middle
We're replacing MKOverlayView
with MKOverlayRenderer.

00:17:48.726 --> 00:17:52.216 A:middle
We've got a new facility for
putting overlays beneath labels.

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:55.666 A:middle
So, as I mentioned in the
overview earlier this allows you

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.176 A:middle
to put your polylines or
polygons underneath the labels

00:17:58.176 --> 00:17:59.406 A:middle
and enhance readability
of the map.

00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:01.086 A:middle
We've got a geodesic polyline.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:01.086 A:middle
We've got a geodesic polyline.

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:03.946 A:middle
A geodesic is the shortest path

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:05.856 A:middle
between two points
along a curved surface.

00:18:06.136 --> 00:18:07.446 A:middle
So, as this applies
to the Earth it's--

00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:09.556 A:middle
you know it follows

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:11.596 A:middle
that shortest path along the
curved surface of the Earth.

00:18:12.366 --> 00:18:13.376 A:middle
Why would you want to use this?

00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:15.866 A:middle
Probably to show the flight
path that an airplane takes.

00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:17.396 A:middle
Airplanes usually
take the shortest path

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:20.026 A:middle
between two points, not
always, but usually they do.

00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:22.046 A:middle
We've got MKTileOverlays.

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:23.556 A:middle
So if you've got a
raster image pyramid,

00:18:23.556 --> 00:18:25.476 A:middle
you've got your own
map tiles and you want

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.136 A:middle
to show those either
on top of or in lieu

00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:30.816 A:middle
of Apple's data we can do
that and that works in content

00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:32.536 A:middle
with our Map data
replacement APIs.

00:18:33.226 --> 00:18:35.296 A:middle
And the last point is
better performance.

00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:38.926 A:middle
We rewrote the Overlay system
in iOS 7, so it's going

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.226 A:middle
to be faster and
work better for you.

00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:42.536 A:middle
So, let's get into it.

00:18:42.536 --> 00:18:45.426 A:middle
First topic, MKOverlayRenderer:
What I'd like you

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:48.426 A:middle
to do is replace everywhere
you use MKOverlayView

00:18:48.426 --> 00:18:49.356 A:middle
with MKOverlayRenderer.

00:18:49.356 --> 00:18:51.106 A:middle
So we have a whole
new class hierarchy

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:53.536 A:middle
under MKOverlayRenderer,
MKPolylineRenderer,

00:18:53.536 --> 00:18:55.716 A:middle
MKPolygonRenderer
and MKCircleRenderer

00:18:56.186 --> 00:18:59.616 A:middle
and MKTileOverlayRenderer now.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:02.236 A:middle
And so just switch
from MKOverlayView

00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:04.086 A:middle
to MKOverlayRenderer class.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.156 A:middle
MKOverlayRenderer
is lighter weight

00:19:06.156 --> 00:19:07.256 A:middle
because it's no longer a view.

00:19:07.306 --> 00:19:09.226 A:middle
We didn't really need
the viewness of it

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:13.066 A:middle
and this is the only way to
do overlays on OS X as well.

00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:15.426 A:middle
So, find and replace
and fix your errors

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:16.576 A:middle
and it should be
pretty straightforward.

00:19:16.786 --> 00:19:20.026 A:middle
The API is basically the same.

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:25.116 A:middle
So, on the topic of putting your
overlays underneath the labels

00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:26.856 A:middle
we have two places
you can put them now.

00:19:27.276 --> 00:19:29.196 A:middle
You an put them above roads.

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:31.726 A:middle
So this is going to be
directly above the roads,

00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:35.106 A:middle
but below everything else,
above the labels, above shields

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:39.876 A:middle
that you see on highways, or
this is below shields you see

00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:42.646 A:middle
on highways rather, below point
of interest icons that are

00:19:42.646 --> 00:19:43.436 A:middle
on the map an so forth.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.746 A:middle
And there's
MKOverlayLevelAboveLabels,

00:19:45.746 --> 00:19:46.896 A:middle
which is what we
traditionally had

00:19:46.896 --> 00:19:48.476 A:middle
since I was formerly
introduced to overlays.

00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:49.456 A:middle
So, this is the overlay.

00:19:49.456 --> 00:19:51.676 A:middle
It's above everything except
for your annotation views.

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:54.826 A:middle
So, just to show what
this looks like here,

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:56.646 A:middle
get out of the way of the thing.

00:19:57.246 --> 00:19:59.156 A:middle
So, this is what we had.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.776 A:middle
This is AboveLabels and
then just go ahead and push

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.776 A:middle
This is AboveLabels and
then just go ahead and push

00:20:01.776 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
that underneath and it improves
the readability of the map.

00:20:03.656 --> 00:20:05.816 A:middle
You can see the labels on
the streets and the point

00:20:05.816 --> 00:20:08.696 A:middle
of interest icons there; they
really stand out a lot better.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:15.776 A:middle
And just to go through this in a
little more detail this is how--

00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:18.276 A:middle
this is sort of how the map
is layered from the ground up.

00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:23.336 A:middle
So, initially we had the grid
and then we add in the base map.

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:26.706 A:middle
So, we add in polygons
like parks

00:20:26.706 --> 00:20:28.336 A:middle
and so forth, bodies of water.

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:31.886 A:middle
We add in roads and we add
in 2D building footprints

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:32.586 A:middle
where those are available.

00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:36.026 A:middle
And then
MKOverlayLevelAboveRoads

00:20:36.296 --> 00:20:38.276 A:middle
so we'll go ahead and put this
polyline here on this road.

00:20:40.056 --> 00:20:41.286 A:middle
Then we'll add in labeling

00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:43.266 A:middle
so you can see those
point of interest icons.

00:20:43.296 --> 00:20:45.206 A:middle
The street labels and so
forth come in and they're

00:20:45.206 --> 00:20:45.986 A:middle
on top of the overlay.

00:20:45.986 --> 00:20:49.566 A:middle
And then we can add an
overlay above those labels.

00:20:49.566 --> 00:20:51.746 A:middle
So we'll put the circle in
their above the labels and then

00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:56.226 A:middle
if we were to pitch in the 3D
those 3D buildings they push

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.626 A:middle
through and they
occlude the overlays.

00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:01.296 A:middle
And then finally we'll come back
to 2D and add an annotation view

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:01.296 A:middle
And then finally we'll come back
to 2D and add an annotation view

00:21:01.586 --> 00:21:03.296 A:middle
and an annotation view
sits on top of all of that.

00:21:04.086 --> 00:21:05.886 A:middle
So, that's the layers
of the map.

00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:08.536 A:middle
That's how they fit together.

00:21:08.626 --> 00:21:12.126 A:middle
So, in Code suppose we have
an MKPolygon represented

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:14.346 A:middle
in presidio and we have
this new parameter here

00:21:14.346 --> 00:21:15.506 A:middle
when we add the overlay level.

00:21:15.506 --> 00:21:17.996 A:middle
We can just pass either of
those [inaudible] values there

00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:19.086 A:middle
and get it where we want it.

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:20.756 A:middle
So, pretty straight forward.

00:21:21.226 --> 00:21:23.746 A:middle
So the geodesic polyline,
here's a screenshot

00:21:23.746 --> 00:21:24.496 A:middle
of what this looks like.

00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:25.346 A:middle
We have the blue line.

00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:28.196 A:middle
This is the shortest
path as the pixel flies.

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:28.886 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:33.086 A:middle
And then yea, and then the
red line is the shortest path

00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:35.096 A:middle
as the crow flies in
a very long flight

00:21:35.536 --> 00:21:37.066 A:middle
to Tokyo from San Francisco.

00:21:38.496 --> 00:21:39.756 A:middle
So, in Code how is this done?

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.116 A:middle
So, suppose we have a
method here updateOverlays

00:21:42.816 --> 00:21:44.536 A:middle
and we're going to
create a geodesic polyline

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.156 A:middle
from two points.

00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:49.026 A:middle
MKGeodesicPolyline is a
subclass of MKPolyline

00:21:49.026 --> 00:21:49.856 A:middle
so it works the same way.

00:21:50.136 --> 00:21:52.826 A:middle
We just create it with a list of
coordinates, in this case two.

00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:55.566 A:middle
We add it to the map and the
map's going to come back to us

00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:57.186 A:middle
and say give me a
renderer for this

00:21:57.406 --> 00:21:59.356 A:middle
and we just use a regular
MKPolyline Renderer

00:21:59.356 --> 00:21:59.946 A:middle
to show this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.246 --> 00:22:02.766 A:middle
And it has a line
with a strokeColor.

00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:03.996 A:middle
There's no difference
between the renderer

00:22:03.996 --> 00:22:06.536 A:middle
for regular polylines
and geodesic polylines.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:10.136 A:middle
So, the same thing there.

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.676 A:middle
Next topic, MKTileOverlays

00:22:12.676 --> 00:22:16.366 A:middle
so this is a full replacement
tile set that I built.

00:22:16.756 --> 00:22:19.966 A:middle
I used Core Image and I did
like a CP atone filter and I did

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:22.616 A:middle
like a grid behind it and
so forth and took some tiles

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:24.566 A:middle
and built my own tile set here.

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:28.946 A:middle
So, that's my take
on an old time map.

00:22:29.956 --> 00:22:31.256 A:middle
How did I do this?

00:22:31.606 --> 00:22:33.126 A:middle
Well, it's pretty simple to use.

00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:35.036 A:middle
The first thing you do is
you configure a template.

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:37.236 A:middle
You're also, if you have these
tiles you have an image pyramid,

00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:39.356 A:middle
a whole bunch of tiles located
on the web server somewhere.

00:22:39.696 --> 00:22:40.946 A:middle
You have some addressing
scheme for it.

00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:42.526 A:middle
You fill out this template URL

00:22:42.816 --> 00:22:44.046 A:middle
and you have your
[inaudible] parameters

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:45.906 A:middle
or whatever structure
you use to make this URL.

00:22:46.386 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
There's an X and a Y and a Z
addressing each of those tiles

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:52.016 A:middle
and we'll go ahead
and those are things

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:52.856 A:middle
that are in the braces there.

00:22:52.856 --> 00:22:55.636 A:middle
We'll fill those in and so
when you create a tile overlay

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:57.336 A:middle
with that we're going
to take that template

00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.106 A:middle
and as needed we'll load tiles

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:00.416 A:middle
from your web server
in order to display.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:00.416 A:middle
from your web server
in order to display.

00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:03.456 A:middle
We can set this property
canReplaceMapContent to Yes

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:06.046 A:middle
and in the case where
we do that it's going

00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:08.126 A:middle
to not load Apple
data or show it.

00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:09.846 A:middle
It's going to load
your data and show it

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:13.146 A:middle
so it's a way you can use your
own map content using MKMapView.

00:23:13.736 --> 00:23:14.986 A:middle
And then finally we'll
add it to the map.

00:23:15.206 --> 00:23:17.616 A:middle
We'll add it AboveLabels because
we're replacing everything

00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:19.416 A:middle
and that's how it's done.

00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:20.856 A:middle
And then the map is
going to come back to us

00:23:20.856 --> 00:23:21.846 A:middle
and give us a renderer.

00:23:22.706 --> 00:23:24.236 A:middle
We return an
MKTileOverlayRenderer

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:24.676 A:middle
and return it.

00:23:25.646 --> 00:23:27.086 A:middle
So, just to go into
a little more detail

00:23:27.086 --> 00:23:28.926 A:middle
about this what is the
coordinate system for this?

00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:33.856 A:middle
So, the way that it works
is it's a regular grid.

00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:37.206 A:middle
It's a square and it's
tiled from the upper left

00:23:37.206 --> 00:23:39.146 A:middle
by default though we
also allow you to tile it

00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:40.796 A:middle
from the lower left, so you
can set your origin wherever

00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:41.826 A:middle
you like.

00:23:42.286 --> 00:23:46.296 A:middle
Well, either of those
two places.

00:23:46.296 --> 00:23:49.156 A:middle
And it goes by powers of two
so you have zoom level zero,

00:23:49.476 --> 00:23:50.876 A:middle
zoom level one, zoom level two.

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:52.616 A:middle
Here we're looking at zoom
level three, so there's going

00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:53.926 A:middle
to be eight tiles
in the X direction,

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:56.656 A:middle
eight tile in the Y direction.

00:23:57.716 --> 00:23:59.776 A:middle
And then you zoom in,
zoom level twelve.

00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
We have two to the twelve
tiles in the X direction

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
We have two to the twelve
tiles in the X direction

00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:03.346 A:middle
to the twelve tiles
in the Y direction

00:24:03.656 --> 00:24:04.486 A:middle
and it's quite a lot more.

00:24:04.716 --> 00:24:06.226 A:middle
So, it is quite a lot of data.

00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:07.486 A:middle
It's not the kind of thing
that you're just going

00:24:07.486 --> 00:24:09.186 A:middle
to ship you know
in you app bundle.

00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.826 A:middle
If you want to replace the
entire world you're going

00:24:10.826 --> 00:24:12.576 A:middle
to have to have a web
server loading this

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:14.206 A:middle
up so you load only the
things that you need.

00:24:14.706 --> 00:24:18.526 A:middle
And the other thing to say
about this is the tiles are

00:24:18.526 --> 00:24:20.396 A:middle
in this mercator
projection that we use.

00:24:20.886 --> 00:24:24.186 A:middle
You can use this
code the EPSG:3857

00:24:24.186 --> 00:24:27.046 A:middle
if you're using software to
like warp an image to match.

00:24:27.936 --> 00:24:28.986 A:middle
There's various ways
we can do it.

00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:30.566 A:middle
I've used the command
line tools that came

00:24:30.566 --> 00:24:32.286 A:middle
with the geospatial data
abstraction library.

00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:34.006 A:middle
It's an open source
toolkit for working

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:35.786 A:middle
with raster geographical data.

00:24:36.106 --> 00:24:38.746 A:middle
I've had good success with
this in the past myself

00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:41.006 A:middle
and the other thing I'll say
about it, it's the same system

00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:43.666 A:middle
as a lot of like web mapping
parameters if you've used

00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:46.156 A:middle
like JavaScript frameworks
for showing your own tiles.

00:24:46.796 --> 00:24:49.106 A:middle
It's the same system as
that, so you may be able

00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:51.996 A:middle
to use the same tiles
in Map Kit as well

00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:52.946 A:middle
as what you use on the web.

00:24:53.206 --> 00:24:57.376 A:middle
And on the topic of replacing
Apple data with your data,

00:24:57.376 --> 00:24:59.906 A:middle
so we do this either by
optional method on MKOverlay.

00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:01.146 A:middle
So, you can make--
if you don't want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:01.146 A:middle
So, you can make--
if you don't want

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.456 A:middle
to use MKTileOverlay you
can just use any MKOverlay,

00:25:03.616 --> 00:25:05.016 A:middle
implement this method,
return Yes.

00:25:05.586 --> 00:25:08.546 A:middle
And what we'll do is
within the bounding MapRect

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:09.716 A:middle
of that we'll say okay
we're not going to try

00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:10.736 A:middle
and load any Apple Map data.

00:25:10.736 --> 00:25:12.736 A:middle
We're just going to load
your data, so you'll see grid

00:25:12.736 --> 00:25:14.426 A:middle
until your data comes
in and draws.

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:16.176 A:middle
And then it's also available

00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:17.826 A:middle
as a settable property
on MKTileOverlay.

00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:21.506 A:middle
And as I mentioned neither load
nor draw the Apple Map data

00:25:21.506 --> 00:25:22.106 A:middle
when we do this.

00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:24.986 A:middle
And you typically
use it above labels,

00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:26.376 A:middle
so you're showing this right.

00:25:26.376 --> 00:25:27.066 A:middle
We're not showing labels.

00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:29.396 A:middle
But one new thing is you
actually can put it above roads

00:25:29.606 --> 00:25:32.256 A:middle
and what we'll do in that case
is just load the data necessary

00:25:32.256 --> 00:25:32.966 A:middle
to display the labels.

00:25:32.966 --> 00:25:35.726 A:middle
So, if you had satellite data
or whatever that you needed

00:25:35.726 --> 00:25:38.346 A:middle
to display or something that's
not labeled and you wanted

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:40.866 A:middle
to have like a hybrid mode,
you could use this to do that.

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:44.116 A:middle
So, I'm going to walk over
here to the demo machine

00:25:44.116 --> 00:25:45.086 A:middle
and show you a quick demo.

00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:48.596 A:middle
And what I'm going to do
actually is recycle a demo

00:25:48.866 --> 00:25:55.086 A:middle
that I showed in 2010, but
I'm going to update it.

00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:16.306 A:middle
So, I wrote this three years ago

00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:17.846 A:middle
for Worldwide Development
Conference.

00:26:17.846 --> 00:26:19.626 A:middle
Did you guys ever look
at Code three years ago?

00:26:21.196 --> 00:26:27.526 A:middle
Yea. What I'm going to do is
open my notes here and this--

00:26:28.056 --> 00:26:30.426 A:middle
the thing about this,
let me just build

00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:35.446 A:middle
and run it and see what it does.

00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
I took this map and I'm
going to zoom in on it here.

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.956 A:middle
I got this from the
National Oceanic

00:26:40.956 --> 00:26:43.556 A:middle
and Atmospheric Administration's
website three years ago

00:26:43.956 --> 00:26:48.486 A:middle
and I cut into the tiles using
GDAL and I have those tiles

00:26:48.486 --> 00:26:51.086 A:middle
in my apps resources here.

00:26:51.856 --> 00:26:52.446 A:middle
You can see them.

00:26:52.826 --> 00:26:56.866 A:middle
It's the thing that's
sliced up into tiles.

00:26:57.046 --> 00:26:58.426 A:middle
All of these guys are in there

00:26:58.926 --> 00:27:01.176 A:middle
and what this thing does it
just goes ahead and loads them

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.926 --> 00:27:01.176 A:middle
and what this thing does it
just goes ahead and loads them

00:27:01.176 --> 00:27:03.046 A:middle
and displays them in
semitransparent fashion

00:27:03.676 --> 00:27:04.916 A:middle
on top of satellite tiles.

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
So, this is nice, but the thing
about it was there was kind

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:09.996 A:middle
of a lot of code to do this.

00:27:09.996 --> 00:27:11.416 A:middle
I'm not even going
to bother with it.

00:27:11.476 --> 00:27:12.556 A:middle
Just scroll through
there, it's a lot.

00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:14.426 A:middle
And there was more in there.

00:27:15.436 --> 00:27:17.746 A:middle
And it was kind of
complicated and the thing

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:20.626 A:middle
about this is it only works
for pretty much this sample.

00:27:20.626 --> 00:27:22.526 A:middle
It's like well if you had
a small amount of tiles

00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:23.916 A:middle
in your app you're going
to say okay it works,

00:27:24.386 --> 00:27:26.386 A:middle
but it doesn't work
well if you want

00:27:26.386 --> 00:27:27.366 A:middle
to load them from a web server.

00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:29.166 A:middle
I kind of handwaved
that three years ago.

00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:33.166 A:middle
So, we're going to make that
better and the way to do

00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:34.936 A:middle
that is I'm just going
to delete everything.

going to do is I'm going to drag

in a new viewDidLoad

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.756 A:middle
to do is I still have these
tiles in my out bundle.

00:27:59.756 --> 00:28:01.296 A:middle
It works for me because
I don't have that many.

but you certainly could.

00:28:05.386 --> 00:28:09.056 A:middle
I'm going to set up a template
URL so file URL for this.

00:28:09.746 --> 00:28:10.776 A:middle
I'm going to make a TileOverlay.

00:28:10.926 --> 00:28:12.546 A:middle
I'm going to say
geometry flipped

00:28:12.546 --> 00:28:14.146 A:middle
because the origin
is in the lower left.

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:17.206 A:middle
I'll add that overlay to
the map and I'll release it

00:28:17.206 --> 00:28:22.366 A:middle
because it was three years
ago and we didn't have ARC.

00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:27.686 A:middle
And we'll have renderer for
overlay, new method here.

00:28:27.746 --> 00:28:28.716 A:middle
for overlay.

00:28:29.156 --> 00:28:30.436 A:middle
We'll make a
TileOverlayRenderer,

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:34.446 A:middle
set the alpha on it to point
6, return it, build and run.

same thing and 20 lines

be bundled with the app.

That's fine or more
likely you're going

00:29:03.746 --> 00:29:05.636 A:middle
to have a web server
serving up all of thse tiles

00:29:05.636 --> 00:29:06.996 A:middle
so you can download
them from your server.

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:08.616 A:middle
And the other thing to see

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:11.106 A:middle
as a I mentioned we can
replace Apple's Map Data

00:29:11.506 --> 00:29:14.046 A:middle
or we can show a topic if
we want to blend data on top

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.616 A:middle
or we want to add
Apple's Map Data we can do

00:29:15.616 --> 00:29:16.726 A:middle
that using MKTileOverlay.

00:29:17.236 --> 00:29:17.746 A:middle
So, that's that.

00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:21.736 A:middle
Let's talk about Local
Search, enough of Overlays.

00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:25.436 A:middle
So, in Local Search
we've got the ability

00:29:25.436 --> 00:29:28.446 A:middle
to find a specific
place by name.

00:29:28.716 --> 00:29:30.716 A:middle
So if I search for Mascone
Center West and find that.

00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:35.116 A:middle
We can find a list of places
by type such as pizza places.

00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:39.076 A:middle
So, this is pizza places near
here or you can find an address.

00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:42.326 A:middle
So, if you want to find one
infinite loop Cupertino,

00:29:42.326 --> 00:29:42.796 A:middle
California.

00:29:42.796 --> 00:29:44.956 A:middle
You can find that; that's
Apple's headquarters.

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:49.256 A:middle
We introduced this
in iOS 6.1 actually,

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:51.266 A:middle
so it came out last fall.

00:29:51.266 --> 00:29:53.516 A:middle
We also have it on Mavericks.

00:29:54.066 --> 00:29:57.256 A:middle
And I would just like
to take a moment here

00:29:57.256 --> 00:29:58.616 A:middle
and compare this with Geocoding.

00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:00.706 A:middle
So, we introduced CL
Geocoder a few years ago.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:00.706 A:middle
So, we introduced CL
Geocoder a few years ago.

00:30:01.036 --> 00:30:03.636 A:middle
And Geocoding is useful
and does something similar

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:04.586 A:middle
but not quite the same.

00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:06.576 A:middle
So, I just want to explain
why you would use one

00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:07.136 A:middle
and not the other.

00:30:07.566 --> 00:30:10.666 A:middle
So, with Geocoding we have the
ability to reverse Geocoding.

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:11.486 A:middle
So this takes a coordinate.

00:30:11.486 --> 00:30:12.786 A:middle
You have a latitude
and a longitude pair.

00:30:13.156 --> 00:30:14.646 A:middle
You get an address,
a structured address.

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.836 A:middle
You can add to address book or
you can format it and display it

00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:17.676 A:middle
to the user if you want.

00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:19.556 A:middle
So, that's how this works.

00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:21.706 A:middle
You drop a pin, find
the coordinate for that,

00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:24.306 A:middle
reverse Geocode it, put the
address in the subtitle.

00:30:25.206 --> 00:30:26.776 A:middle
Forward Geocoding
takes an address.

00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:28.876 A:middle
You have an address
book card and you want

00:30:28.876 --> 00:30:29.756 A:middle
to find the coordinate.

00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:31.856 A:middle
So, in this example we'll
use the Maps app here,

00:30:32.426 --> 00:30:36.396 A:middle
open up our contacts list, find
a contact, find the address,

00:30:37.476 --> 00:30:38.816 A:middle
we'll Geocode that,
put a pin on the map.

00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:42.196 A:middle
Local Search takes a
free form query string,

00:30:42.196 --> 00:30:43.566 A:middle
so this is something
the user types in.

00:30:43.566 --> 00:30:45.956 A:middle
I want to find you know
a user UI search bar

00:30:45.956 --> 00:30:48.956 A:middle
and a search field, get back
a list of search results.

00:30:49.516 --> 00:30:53.836 A:middle
So, search for coffee,
drop the pins.

00:30:54.016 --> 00:30:56.086 A:middle
And those search
results are represented

00:30:56.086 --> 00:30:57.446 A:middle
by a class called MKMapItem.

00:30:57.446 --> 00:30:59.496 A:middle
We've had this around
since I was 6.0

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:03.076 A:middle
and its got a coordinate,
it's got a structured address

00:31:03.076 --> 00:31:04.236 A:middle
so you can add it
to address book

00:31:04.776 --> 00:31:07.956 A:middle
and if it's a business
we may have its name,

00:31:07.956 --> 00:31:09.506 A:middle
its phone number and its URL.

00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:11.366 A:middle
So, those may be
available depending

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.086 A:middle
on what the search result is.

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:18.206 A:middle
So in Code how this is done is
you create a request object.

00:31:18.496 --> 00:31:21.936 A:middle
So, MKLocalSearchRequest and
you set two things on it.

00:31:22.156 --> 00:31:23.956 A:middle
First is the query so this
is what the user typed

00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:26.786 A:middle
in in the user's language.

00:31:27.736 --> 00:31:29.176 A:middle
This is a query and
then the region.

00:31:29.576 --> 00:31:30.926 A:middle
So, it's important
to set that region

00:31:30.926 --> 00:31:33.016 A:middle
because if you don't
set it and you query

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:35.206 A:middle
for pizza you're not going
to get relevant results.

00:31:35.256 --> 00:31:37.336 A:middle
So, if you have a map view
that the user can position

00:31:37.936 --> 00:31:39.566 A:middle
or you have some other way

00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:41.776 A:middle
of constraining you know
what the search is going

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:44.096 A:middle
to be you need to set
that region in order

00:31:44.096 --> 00:31:45.046 A:middle
to get relevant results.

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:46.286 A:middle
So, once we've got that set

00:31:46.286 --> 00:31:49.376 A:middle
up we'll create a search
object, MKLocalSearch object.

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:50.486 A:middle
We initialize it with a request.

00:31:50.696 --> 00:31:53.416 A:middle
It's one local search
object per request.

00:31:53.666 --> 00:31:55.766 A:middle
However, you can create multiple
requests, multiple searches

00:31:55.766 --> 00:31:57.166 A:middle
and run them in parallel
if you want.

00:31:58.086 --> 00:31:59.906 A:middle
So, once we have that
we'll start it up

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.436 --> 00:32:02.066 A:middle
and we'll specify a
CompletionHandler,

00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:04.276 A:middle
which is going to get either
a response or an error.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:08.966 A:middle
This is called back on the
main queue, asynchronously

00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:11.606 A:middle
and in this example I'm just
going to go ahead and loop

00:32:11.606 --> 00:32:13.566 A:middle
over those map items,
get their Placemarks

00:32:13.566 --> 00:32:15.516 A:middle
which have their coordinates
in it and I'm going

00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:18.176 A:middle
to remove any old Placemarks on
the map and add these new ones.

00:32:18.176 --> 00:32:20.476 A:middle
So, that's how you can put pins
on the map with Local Search.

00:32:21.176 --> 00:32:21.966 A:middle
So, that's Local Search.

00:32:21.966 --> 00:32:23.676 A:middle
Let's talk about a
closely related topic,

00:32:23.676 --> 00:32:26.856 A:middle
which is directions.

00:32:26.926 --> 00:32:30.166 A:middle
So, directions is a new API in
iOS 7 and it's on Mavericks.

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.566 A:middle
It's a general purpose
route finding API support

00:32:32.566 --> 00:32:34.086 A:middle
in both driving and
walking directions.

00:32:34.506 --> 00:32:37.226 A:middle
We've got support for alternate
routes, so if there's more

00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:39.706 A:middle
than one good way to get there
and the server knows about it,

00:32:39.706 --> 00:32:40.616 A:middle
it can recommend them both.

00:32:40.616 --> 00:32:42.646 A:middle
And it also has support
for time estimates,

00:32:42.646 --> 00:32:45.426 A:middle
so by default this is based on
the current traffic conditions

00:32:45.816 --> 00:32:47.976 A:middle
but you can actually
set a departure date

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:52.336 A:middle
or a desired arrival
time to the future

00:32:52.716 --> 00:32:54.886 A:middle
and we can use historical
traffic patterns

00:32:54.886 --> 00:32:57.566 A:middle
to estimate what the travel time
is going to be at that point.

00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:02.036 A:middle
So, that's the features of
directions and how do we use it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:02.036 A:middle
So, that's the features of
directions and how do we use it.

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:03.746 A:middle
So, suppose we have this
method here and we want

00:33:03.746 --> 00:33:05.306 A:middle
to find directions
between two places.

00:33:05.966 --> 00:33:06.816 A:middle
It works a lot like search.

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:09.696 A:middle
We make a request object, we
initialize it with a source

00:33:09.776 --> 00:33:12.376 A:middle
and destination and
those are MKMapItems.

00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:15.146 A:middle
So, you can do a
local search for them

00:33:15.146 --> 00:33:16.256 A:middle
or make the up yourself.

00:33:16.966 --> 00:33:20.456 A:middle
You do that, create a
directions object and ask it

00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:22.656 A:middle
to calculate directions and
its going to come back to you

00:33:22.656 --> 00:33:25.266 A:middle
on the main thread
with either an error

00:33:25.566 --> 00:33:27.656 A:middle
in which case you probably
want to show like a UI alert

00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:29.946 A:middle
or NS alert or do
something with that.

00:33:30.506 --> 00:33:33.376 A:middle
Otherwise, you're going
to show the response.

00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:36.186 A:middle
And so when I talk about showing
the responsibility there's a lot

00:33:36.186 --> 00:33:36.916 A:middle
of things you can do about it.

00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:38.226 A:middle
There's a lot of data
in this response.

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:40.846 A:middle
And let's just go through really
quickly what is available.

00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:43.776 A:middle
So, we echo back to you
the source and destination.

00:33:44.246 --> 00:33:47.726 A:middle
So an example of this is like
if you get directions to a place

00:33:47.796 --> 00:33:49.856 A:middle
and you know you put
it at this coordinate

00:33:49.856 --> 00:33:52.216 A:middle
but the direction server thinks
oh, you really should arrive

00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:53.826 A:middle
at this point because it's
going to be easier to turn

00:33:53.826 --> 00:33:54.786 A:middle
into the driveway or whatever.

00:33:54.786 --> 00:33:56.646 A:middle
It may move that site, so
you want to look at those.

00:33:57.056 --> 00:33:58.896 A:middle
It's going to come back
with a list of routes

00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:01.486 A:middle
so each route is going
to have a name to it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:01.486 A:middle
so each route is going
to have a name to it.

00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:03.886 A:middle
So, this is sort of the
name of the way that you go

00:34:03.886 --> 00:34:05.876 A:middle
like US 101 South, if
you're getting directions

00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:06.846 A:middle
from here down to Cupertino.

00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:08.416 A:middle
It's going to give
you a distance.

00:34:08.416 --> 00:34:10.525 A:middle
It's going to giving
you any advisory notice

00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:11.856 A:middle
like if it requires tolls

00:34:11.856 --> 00:34:13.126 A:middle
and you can display
that to the user.

00:34:14.016 --> 00:34:16.606 A:middle
There's going to be an expected
travel time and there's going

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:17.946 A:middle
to be the geometry
as a polyline.

00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:20.446 A:middle
And also there's going
to be a list of turn

00:34:20.446 --> 00:34:22.626 A:middle
by turn instructions,
so these are the steps.

00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:24.505 A:middle
And so these are going
to be the instructions,

00:34:24.505 --> 00:34:26.126 A:middle
so for instance take exit 11

00:34:26.126 --> 00:34:28.896 A:middle
on the De Anza Boulevard would
be one your last steps driving

00:34:28.896 --> 00:34:29.926 A:middle
down to Apple Headquarters.

00:34:30.406 --> 00:34:32.636 A:middle
There may be a notice on some
of the steps, so you may want

00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:34.235 A:middle
to present that in
some special UI.

00:34:34.896 --> 00:34:38.146 A:middle
You'll get a distance and you'll
also get a transport type.

00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:39.766 A:middle
So, for instance, if you
got directions from here

00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:42.156 A:middle
to Coit Tower you can't drive
all the way to Coit Tower.

00:34:42.156 --> 00:34:43.636 A:middle
You can drive almost
there and then you got

00:34:43.636 --> 00:34:45.386 A:middle
to walk the rest of the way.

00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:47.686 A:middle
This step may have a
walking step at the end

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:48.735 A:middle
if you got driving directions.

00:34:49.196 --> 00:34:51.136 A:middle
And then the other thing is
you can get the step geometry

00:34:51.136 --> 00:34:51.806 A:middle
as a polyline.

00:34:51.806 --> 00:34:54.246 A:middle
So, this is basically
the subsequence

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:55.326 A:middle
of that overall geometry.

00:34:56.815 --> 00:34:58.906 A:middle
So, suppose we want to display
something like this on the map.

00:34:59.296 --> 00:35:00.686 A:middle
Here's the routes
from San Franciso

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.296 --> 00:35:00.686 A:middle
Here's the routes
from San Franciso

00:35:01.126 --> 00:35:02.646 A:middle
down to Cupertino,
three ways to do it.

00:35:03.496 --> 00:35:04.716 A:middle
And here's some code to do that.

00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
So, we'll just loop over all
the routes and add an overlay

00:35:08.866 --> 00:35:11.416 A:middle
of those polylines for each
of the routes to the map.

00:35:11.986 --> 00:35:13.586 A:middle
The other thing you might
want to do is you might want

00:35:13.586 --> 00:35:14.396 A:middle
to show it in a table view.

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:19.146 A:middle
So, for instance in California
there is always a way,

00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:20.846 A:middle
more than one way to get there.

00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:23.776 A:middle
You can take the 280,
you can take the 101,

00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:25.396 A:middle
you can take the 880.

00:35:25.636 --> 00:35:28.606 A:middle
You've got choices and
if you want to do this,

00:35:28.606 --> 00:35:31.006 A:middle
suppose we're the data
source for a table view.

00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:34.686 A:middle
And what we'll do is we'll have
this route, so we find the route

00:35:34.686 --> 00:35:37.416 A:middle
that we want to show and we'll
set the text of that cell

00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:38.586 A:middle
to the name of the route.

00:35:39.736 --> 00:35:41.636 A:middle
We have a new class in iOs 7,

00:35:41.636 --> 00:35:43.616 A:middle
also in Mavericks that's
a distance formatter.

00:35:44.096 --> 00:35:46.136 A:middle
This is an NS formatter
subclass that allows you

00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:47.336 A:middle
to format distances according

00:35:47.336 --> 00:35:49.776 A:middle
to the user interface
language and locale.

00:35:50.316 --> 00:35:52.696 A:middle
So, in the United
States we'll use miles.

00:35:52.696 --> 00:35:53.636 A:middle
Elsewhere we'll use kilometers.

[ Applause ]

00:35:55.436 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
Cool. I'm glad you guys liked
that and we'll go ahead and use

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:55.436 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
Cool. I'm glad you guys liked
that and we'll go ahead and use

00:36:01.206 --> 00:36:03.746 A:middle
that distance formatter and
we'll use NS data formatter,

00:36:03.746 --> 00:36:06.126 A:middle
which I'm going to handwave
here and then we can show

00:36:06.126 --> 00:36:08.086 A:middle
that expected arrival
time in distance.

00:36:08.086 --> 00:36:09.566 A:middle
So, that's how we do that.

00:36:09.756 --> 00:36:11.066 A:middle
So, I'm going to do
a quick demo here

00:36:11.186 --> 00:36:12.946 A:middle
of adding walking
directions to an app.

00:36:12.946 --> 00:36:14.736 A:middle
I'm going to recycle
another demo.

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:16.576 A:middle
This is one we showed last year

00:36:17.566 --> 00:36:22.136 A:middle
and what it did was it
showed Caltrain directions.

00:36:22.386 --> 00:36:27.176 A:middle
And it was really just kind of
a basic app and we just used it

00:36:27.176 --> 00:36:29.486 A:middle
to show routing apps in maps.

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:35.856 A:middle
And I'm just going to
build and run this.

00:36:35.856 --> 00:36:40.646 A:middle
Get this guy going here.

00:36:40.646 --> 00:36:43.356 A:middle
It's really just you know a very
basic just kind of a sample app

00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:48.766 A:middle
and it gives Caltrain
directions between two points.

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:51.286 A:middle
And the thing about Caltrian
is it doesn't go to Cupertino.

00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:53.226 A:middle
It goes to Sunnyvale.

00:36:53.606 --> 00:36:55.456 A:middle
And what we'd like to do is
sort of fill in the gaps.

00:36:55.456 --> 00:36:58.246 A:middle
Let's improve this app so we can
have walking directions to get

00:36:58.246 --> 00:37:00.046 A:middle
from you know how do we get

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.246 --> 00:37:00.046 A:middle
from you know how do we get

00:37:00.136 --> 00:37:01.706 A:middle
to the train station
we're departing from

00:37:01.706 --> 00:37:03.936 A:middle
and from their arrival
transition how do we get

00:37:03.936 --> 00:37:04.666 A:middle
to our destination?

00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:10.296 A:middle
So, let's quit that and add
some code and some notes here.

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:15.206 A:middle
So, what I'm going to do--

00:37:15.426 --> 00:37:19.516 A:middle
it's a sample application,
but it's kind of big.

00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:21.856 A:middle
And we don't need to
understand the whole thing

00:37:21.856 --> 00:37:22.856 A:middle
in order to modify it.

00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:23.826 A:middle
So, what we have here is the--

00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:25.946 A:middle
these are the properties on
this view controller here

00:37:25.946 --> 00:37:26.626 A:middle
and it has a route.

00:37:26.926 --> 00:37:29.966 A:middle
This route object is an internal
object to this application

00:37:30.226 --> 00:37:31.756 A:middle
and it represents
a Caltrain route.

00:37:31.796 --> 00:37:33.186 A:middle
So, this is what it has.

00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:36.116 A:middle
What I want to add alongside
of this is two MKRoutes

00:37:36.116 --> 00:37:38.306 A:middle
that we're going to get
from the Directions API.

00:37:38.306 --> 00:37:40.166 A:middle
So, we're going to have
the walking leg one.

00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:42.436 A:middle
This is how we get to our
departure train station

00:37:43.056 --> 00:37:44.566 A:middle
and walking leg two, which is--

00:37:44.926 --> 00:37:46.726 A:middle
this is how we get from
our arrival train station

00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:47.916 A:middle
to our final destination.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:51.456 A:middle
So, add properties for
that and what we're going

00:37:51.456 --> 00:37:52.726 A:middle
to do is just scroll down here.

00:37:53.276 --> 00:37:56.456 A:middle
And I see this method
here ClearRoute.

00:37:56.456 --> 00:37:59.046 A:middle
Obviously we just need
to add some stuff here.

00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:02.486 A:middle
So, if we clear that Caltrain
route let's also clear our

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:02.486 A:middle
So, if we clear that Caltrain
route let's also clear our

00:38:02.486 --> 00:38:03.746 A:middle
walking route.

00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:10.826 A:middle
That's good and once we've
gotten the route it goes ahead

00:38:10.826 --> 00:38:13.446 A:middle
and adds annotations for
the start and the stop

00:38:13.446 --> 00:38:17.156 A:middle
and it adds an overlay for
the Caltrain route's polyline.

00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:20.866 A:middle
And I'm going to add
those walking polylines.

00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:25.016 A:middle
I know we don't have them yet,
but hopefully we will get them

00:38:25.016 --> 00:38:27.136 A:middle
and when we do we're going
to want to show them.

00:38:27.136 --> 00:38:29.606 A:middle
Another thing I noted about
this is this is using this old

00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.476 A:middle
overlay, AddOverlay API.

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:33.446 A:middle
It's just going to
add it AboveLabels.

00:38:33.446 --> 00:38:41.656 A:middle
Let's put them BelowLabels
while we're in here.

[ Silence ]

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:48.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go, so a
bit of formatting there.

00:38:49.646 --> 00:38:51.386 A:middle
And let's go ahead and--

00:38:51.606 --> 00:38:54.536 A:middle
I know that we implement
ViewForOverlay in here.

00:38:55.316 --> 00:38:58.126 A:middle
This is old and busted, delete.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.096 --> 00:39:04.156 A:middle
New, RendererForOverlay.

00:39:04.456 --> 00:39:05.596 A:middle
So the only difference
here is we're going

00:39:05.596 --> 00:39:07.926 A:middle
to make polyline renderers
and we'll do a blue one

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:10.876 A:middle
if the polyline that
we're being asked for,

00:39:10.876 --> 00:39:13.036 A:middle
the overlay we're being asked
for is for the Caltrain route.

00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:14.506 A:middle
Otherwise, it's one
of the walking routes.

00:39:14.506 --> 00:39:15.316 A:middle
Let's do a gray line.

00:39:15.636 --> 00:39:16.356 A:middle
So, we'll put that in there.

00:39:16.436 --> 00:39:19.686 A:middle
And then the last thing is the
thing we're all here to see.

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:24.676 A:middle
There's this method
route from place in here.

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.566 A:middle
So, this is an internal
object representing a place.

00:39:27.606 --> 00:39:30.386 A:middle
This is where we're
going to start leaving

00:39:30.386 --> 00:39:32.856 A:middle
from and where it goes to.

00:39:32.856 --> 00:39:35.506 A:middle
And what this application did is
it just said give me the closest

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:38.066 A:middle
stop, the closest stop.

00:39:38.356 --> 00:39:39.266 A:middle
Well, how do we get there?

00:39:39.896 --> 00:39:41.206 A:middle
Don't know; this
app doesn't do that.

00:39:41.206 --> 00:39:43.556 A:middle
And then it just routes from
the start stop to the end stop.

00:39:44.066 --> 00:39:45.266 A:middle
Let's not do that.

00:39:45.546 --> 00:39:50.186 A:middle
Let's delete that and add this
code, just kind of a big block

00:39:50.186 --> 00:39:52.976 A:middle
of code and I'll walk you
through it really quickly.

00:39:53.116 --> 00:39:55.206 A:middle
So, we're going to make
a directions request

00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:56.236 A:middle
for the first leg.

00:39:56.306 --> 00:40:00.026 A:middle
We're going to set the transport
type to walking and we're going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:56.306 --> 00:40:00.026 A:middle
We're going to set the transport
type to walking and we're going

00:40:00.026 --> 00:40:01.196 A:middle
to set the source
and the destination

00:40:01.196 --> 00:40:02.836 A:middle
to be the start place,
so this is

00:40:02.916 --> 00:40:04.856 A:middle
where we're actually
departing from where we are now

00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:08.186 A:middle
and then we're going to
set it to the train station

00:40:08.186 --> 00:40:09.156 A:middle
that we want to leave from.

00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:12.846 A:middle
So, we'll create a
directions object for that.

00:40:12.846 --> 00:40:15.106 A:middle
Ask it to calculate directions
and it's going to come back

00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:17.746 A:middle
to us on the main queue
and either we're going

00:40:17.746 --> 00:40:19.466 A:middle
to be having an error in
which case we're going to have

00:40:19.466 --> 00:40:21.856 A:middle
to display an alert and we're
all going to be very sad

00:40:22.676 --> 00:40:25.076 A:middle
or we'll get back a walking leg.

00:40:25.076 --> 00:40:27.236 A:middle
So, this is-- we didn't
ask for alternate routes,

00:40:27.236 --> 00:40:28.236 A:middle
so there's going to be just one.

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:30.136 A:middle
So, we'll get that first route

00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:31.976 A:middle
and we'll stash in
that property.

00:40:32.586 --> 00:40:38.426 A:middle
So, we'll do the same thing for
leg two and hopefully we succeed

00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:39.926 A:middle
and we end up stashing it there

00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:42.786 A:middle
and then finally we can get
the Caltrain directions now

00:40:42.786 --> 00:40:44.216 A:middle
that we've got the walking
directions that we need.

00:40:44.396 --> 00:40:46.406 A:middle
And the thing I'll say
about this is for simplicity

00:40:46.406 --> 00:40:48.446 A:middle
up here I've done
these serially.

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.256 A:middle
You could run them in
parallel if you want.

00:40:50.256 --> 00:40:52.386 A:middle
There's no reason that
you can't do that.

00:40:52.386 --> 00:40:53.676 A:middle
I just did it this
way to be simple.

00:40:53.676 --> 00:40:55.226 A:middle
So, let's just build and run.

And the other thing I would say

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.776 --> 00:41:01.566 A:middle
And the other thing I would say

00:41:01.566 --> 00:41:04.036 A:middle
about this is I actually
cheated a little bit and I went

00:41:04.036 --> 00:41:05.536 A:middle
and I updated this
sample I had this time

00:41:05.536 --> 00:41:08.716 A:middle
to use LocalSearch instead
of using the Geocoder,

00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:09.466 A:middle
which it originally is.

00:41:09.846 --> 00:41:13.346 A:middle
So, we can actually go from
Mascone West now and let's go

00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:15.346 A:middle
to a place in Palo
Alto that I know

00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:17.246 A:middle
about called Antonio's Nuthouse.

00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:23.326 A:middle
Get directions, and
now if we zoom

00:41:23.326 --> 00:41:26.646 A:middle
in on the map we can see
we've got walking directions

00:41:26.686 --> 00:41:29.636 A:middle
from Mascone West here,
walk down 4th Street;

00:41:29.636 --> 00:41:32.456 A:middle
it's not a long walk, get on
the Caltrain at 4th and King,

00:41:33.456 --> 00:41:39.266 A:middle
zoom out, go down and
we'll get off in Palo Alto

00:41:39.266 --> 00:41:42.416 A:middle
at the [inaudible] Station
and it's just a short block

00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:44.626 A:middle
and a half walk to the
Nuthouse, which is right here.

00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:48.136 A:middle
So, that's how you can
add walking directions

00:41:48.136 --> 00:41:49.586 A:middle
to an existing routing app.

00:41:50.936 --> 00:41:53.196 A:middle

scratching the surface of it.

more you could do with it.

but I hope you get
the idea there.

00:42:06.006 --> 00:42:07.036 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides.

00:42:09.906 --> 00:42:11.386 A:middle
So, we saw how to use
the Directions API

00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:13.236 A:middle
to augment an existing
routing app.

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:15.376 A:middle
So, I hope that if you have a
routing app right now you have

00:42:15.376 --> 00:42:16.886 A:middle
something on there
stored and you say oh,

00:42:16.886 --> 00:42:18.166 A:middle
I wish I had walking directions.

00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:18.876 A:middle
I wish I could add this.

00:42:19.256 --> 00:42:20.286 A:middle
Please go ahead and do that

00:42:20.726 --> 00:42:22.286 A:middle
and then the other
thing we saw is how

00:42:22.286 --> 00:42:24.046 A:middle
to show those MKRoutes
on MKMapView.

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:25.656 A:middle
So, that's that.

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:27.926 A:middle
So, now I want to talk about
the fact that Directions

00:42:27.976 --> 00:42:29.316 A:middle
and Search are server-based.

00:42:29.426 --> 00:42:31.476 A:middle
So, they require a network
connection to operate.

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:33.236 A:middle
And the other thing I'll say

00:42:33.236 --> 00:42:34.896 A:middle
about them is don't cache
the results for too long.

00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:38.336 A:middle
If you get driving directions
and you hold onto them

00:42:38.336 --> 00:42:40.216 A:middle
for a week, you know
you store them on disk,

00:42:40.546 --> 00:42:42.346 A:middle
you pull those back up,
things may have changed.

00:42:42.346 --> 00:42:43.836 A:middle
The traffic conditions
may have changed.

00:42:44.286 --> 00:42:46.126 A:middle
There may be a road closure
or something like that.

00:42:46.126 --> 00:42:47.476 A:middle
So, you want to rerequest
those things

00:42:47.546 --> 00:42:48.336 A:middle
to get more up to date data.

00:42:48.336 --> 00:42:49.756 A:middle
And the same thing goes
for Search as well.

00:42:51.086 --> 00:42:52.056 A:middle
And the other thing
I want to talk

00:42:52.056 --> 00:42:55.626 A:middle
about is the Usage
Limits on this API.

00:42:55.866 --> 00:42:58.676 A:middle
So, I'm happy to announce
that there's no application

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.566 A:middle
or developer identifier
wide usage limits.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.566 A:middle
or developer identifier
wide usage limits.

00:43:00.776 --> 00:43:03.576 A:middle
So, if you have a app that has
a lot of users and you want

00:43:03.576 --> 00:43:05.396 A:middle
to do a lot of requests,
that's fine.

00:43:05.576 --> 00:43:05.946 A:middle
It'll work.

00:43:06.446 --> 00:43:11.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:11.536 --> 00:43:14.796 A:middle
And the throttling that we do
have is really just a first line

00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:15.756 A:middle
of defense against buggy apps.

00:43:15.756 --> 00:43:18.646 A:middle
So, if you put directions
requests

00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:21.316 A:middle
or local search requests in an
infinite loop, you've got a bug,

00:43:21.686 --> 00:43:23.016 A:middle
eventually you're
going to get throttled.

00:43:23.276 --> 00:43:24.926 A:middle
But if you do something
reasonable, you say oh,

00:43:24.926 --> 00:43:27.126 A:middle
I'm going to just do directions
in response to user input

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:28.696 A:middle
and you know you can
do a few of those

00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:30.086 A:middle
because we showed
them that example.

00:43:30.086 --> 00:43:32.086 A:middle
Like we did two directions
request in response

00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:33.096 A:middle
to one user input, that's fine.

00:43:33.556 --> 00:43:37.696 A:middle
But, you know if you're doing
10,000 every time the user taps

00:43:37.696 --> 00:43:39.286 A:middle
on the screen, then you're
going to get throttled.

00:43:39.286 --> 00:43:41.156 A:middle
But, just keep it
reasonable and you'll be fine.

00:43:42.256 --> 00:43:43.076 A:middle
So, that's everything.

00:43:43.296 --> 00:43:44.476 A:middle
Let's go into our conclusion.

00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:46.566 A:middle
So, what did we learn?

00:43:46.836 --> 00:43:47.966 A:middle
There's many new features.

00:43:47.966 --> 00:43:49.456 A:middle
In fact, we couldn't even
have covered them all

00:43:49.456 --> 00:43:49.926 A:middle
in this session.

00:43:49.926 --> 00:43:51.006 A:middle
We have a session coming up.

00:43:51.606 --> 00:43:53.446 A:middle
The first of which
was Map Kit OS X,

00:43:53.886 --> 00:43:55.486 A:middle
which is I think my
favorite feature.

00:43:55.756 --> 00:43:59.156 A:middle
I'm really excited to see what
you guys come up with on OS X.

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:02.256 A:middle
There's the updates to iOS 7 UI.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:02.256 A:middle
There's the updates to iOS 7 UI.

00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:04.046 A:middle
So, there's a new UI in iOS 7

00:44:04.046 --> 00:44:06.216 A:middle
and that changes a few
things in MKMapView.

00:44:07.496 --> 00:44:09.876 A:middle
We've got 3D maps and
spanning the 180th meridian.

00:44:10.956 --> 00:44:12.676 A:middle
We've got new Overlays
Functionality

00:44:12.676 --> 00:44:15.196 A:middle
so we've got polylines,
polygons,

00:44:15.196 --> 00:44:17.016 A:middle
other overlays underneath
your labels.

00:44:17.016 --> 00:44:18.386 A:middle
We've got the geodesic
polylines.

00:44:18.386 --> 00:44:19.696 A:middle
We've got MKTileOverlay.

00:44:20.186 --> 00:44:23.056 A:middle
We've got the ability to replace
Apple's Map Data with your own

00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:25.046 A:middle
and we've got Performance
Improvement for Overlays.

00:44:26.266 --> 00:44:28.846 A:middle
We've got the Search API
and the Directions API.

00:44:30.026 --> 00:44:33.216 A:middle
So, what I'd like to ask you
to do is try these things out.

00:44:33.376 --> 00:44:33.976 A:middle
Try them soon.

00:44:33.976 --> 00:44:34.596 A:middle
Like try them this week.

00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:35.456 A:middle
Try them next week.

00:44:35.766 --> 00:44:39.916 A:middle
I want it to work for you,
but if it doesn't please go

00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:42.426 A:middle
to bugreport.apple.com and file
a bug so that we can fix it.

00:44:43.736 --> 00:44:46.016 A:middle
For more information you can
email our Evangelist who's

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:46.826 A:middle
Paul Marcos.

00:44:46.826 --> 00:44:47.806 A:middle
That's his email up there.

00:44:48.216 --> 00:44:49.616 A:middle
We've got some Documentation.

00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:51.866 A:middle
I know that's a long URL but if
you on our website and search

00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:54.166 A:middle
for MKMapUIDeveloper.apple.com
you'll find it.

00:44:54.506 --> 00:44:56.356 A:middle
There's also the Location
Awareness Programming Guide,

00:44:56.356 --> 00:44:57.936 A:middle
which has info on
both Core Location

00:44:57.976 --> 00:44:59.546 A:middle
and Map Kit, which is good.

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:03.116 A:middle
And there's the Developer Forum
which I try to read occasionally

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:03.116 A:middle
And there's the Developer Forum
which I try to read occasionally

00:45:03.186 --> 00:45:04.596 A:middle
and so I may see you in there.

00:45:05.946 --> 00:45:08.046 A:middle
And the next thing to say is
we've got a session at 2:00.

00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:09.496 A:middle
You should go to the session.

00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.226 A:middle
It's the second half of this.

00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:14.176 A:middle
There's a whole bunch
more content on 3D Maps.

00:45:14.626 --> 00:45:16.556 A:middle
We also got Static Map
Snapshots, which we're going

00:45:16.556 --> 00:45:18.346 A:middle
to cover in there
and you should attend

00:45:18.346 --> 00:45:19.306 A:middle
that session this afternoon.

00:45:19.746 --> 00:45:20.486 A:middle
So, that's everything.

00:45:20.846 --> 00:45:21.616 A:middle
Thank you all very much.
