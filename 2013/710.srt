[ Silence ]

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:10.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hi.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.226 A:middle
How's it going?

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:16.276 A:middle
Welcome to the most
magical session at WWDC.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.696 A:middle
I think of this session as the
centerpiece of the conference

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:20.136 A:middle
and then we announce
some other stuff too.

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.296 A:middle
But, we're going to be talking
about App Sandbox today.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:25.326 A:middle
And, before we really
get into that,

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.476 A:middle
we're going to talk about cars.

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:31.976 A:middle
A lot of us drive, a
lot of us know, sort of,

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:36.616 A:middle
how cars have been evolving
as time has gone on.

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:41.446 A:middle
And I found, I found it pretty
interesting that just a couple

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:44.706 A:middle
of years ago traffic
related fatalities

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
in the United States have
actually reached a 50 year low.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.916 A:middle
The NHDSA has statistics on this

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.806 A:middle
and the numbers have been
getting better and better

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.456 A:middle
and they're, basically, at a
really long low at this point.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.316 A:middle
And if you look at why that is,

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
it's because the car
industry has been investing

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
it's because the car
industry has been investing

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:04.866 A:middle
into safety mechanisms
for a long time.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.016 A:middle
It's because you
can't sell a car

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:09.356 A:middle
without passing Federal
Safety Certification.

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:13.146 A:middle
But, what's more interesting
to me, is how that investment

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.706 A:middle
into safety has actually
worked out in practice.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.276 A:middle
On the one hand, there's been a
tremendous amount of innovation

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.466 A:middle
in trying to prevent
accidents from happening.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.466 A:middle
So, just in the last year or
two, you're seeing a bunch

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.066 A:middle
of new mechanisms in modern
cars where, for instance,

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:31.216 A:middle
there is blind spot detection.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.416 A:middle
The car will actually beep
at you if you're trying

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.786 A:middle
to change lanes and there's
a car in your blind spot.

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:40.566 A:middle
There are really a number of new
electronic mechanisms that are,

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.846 A:middle
for instance, how can
you, if you're trying,

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:44.516 A:middle
if you're drifting
out in the lane,

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:46.346 A:middle
sensors can now notice
and warn you.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.756 A:middle
A lot of things that are trying

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:50.276 A:middle
to help drivers be more
alert even on longer trips

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.126 A:middle
and make sure that you
never get in a position

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:53.096 A:middle
where you're in an accident.

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:55.176 A:middle
And all of those have
been really helpful.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.906 A:middle
Almost orthogonal to all of
those, there's been a number

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.706 A:middle
of mechanisms that try to
make it so that if you wind

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.706 A:middle
of mechanisms that try to
make it so that if you wind

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:05.536 A:middle
up in an accident,
harm is minimized.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:11.236 A:middle
Seatbelts and airbags are
the prime examples of this.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:14.246 A:middle
For many of you, I'm sure,

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.956 A:middle
this is just something
that's always been a part

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:16.876 A:middle
of the car but, actually,

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:19.196 A:middle
seatbelts were not
standard equipment until,

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:20.186 A:middle
I think, the '60s.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:21.706 A:middle
Airbags were not
standard equipment

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.876 A:middle
in most U.S. cars
until the '90s.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.646 A:middle
And those standards are
evolving even today.

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:32.796 A:middle
So, it's interesting to
me because, obviously,

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:35.556 A:middle
the best case scenario is you
never wind up in an accident.

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:40.186 A:middle
But, if you do, the car is
trying to be prepared for it

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:43.066 A:middle
and is trying to keep
you from getting harmed.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:48.906 A:middle
So, if you have that
model in mind and you look

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:52.536 A:middle
at how computer security
used to work on desktops

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:53.706 A:middle
and desktop operating systems,

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:55.596 A:middle
it's really been
very, very different.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.646 A:middle
There has never been a
seatbelt or an airbag

00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:00.116 A:middle
for a desktop computer.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:00.116 A:middle
for a desktop computer.

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:03.406 A:middle
In other words, it was
all about making sure

00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:06.416 A:middle
that an attack never succeeds.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.116 A:middle
But, once it does,
there was really no way

00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:11.256 A:middle
to contain the damage,
to contain the impact

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.146 A:middle
of a malicious piece of software

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.256 A:middle
that has successfully
exploited the vulnerability.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:18.866 A:middle
It has just been defenders
trying to defend 100 percent

00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:21.046 A:middle
of the attack surface
all the time,

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:24.866 A:middle
the attacker's finding 1
hole, 1 time and winning.

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:25.956 A:middle
So, why is that?

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:31.156 A:middle
It turns out that the way
we got here, as an industry,

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.966 A:middle
is because of assumptions
that were made in the era

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
of the original UNIX
being designed

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.276 A:middle
with Ritchie and Thompson.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.346 A:middle
Where they made this
underlying assumption,

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.056 A:middle
that I now call the
unfortunate assumption,

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:47.786 A:middle
which is that every program
runs with the full privileges

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:50.046 A:middle
of the user that
ran that program.

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:53.526 A:middle
In other words, we should
direct security barriers

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:55.516 A:middle
between different users
of the same system,

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:58.016 A:middle
but not between different
apps from the same user.

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:02.836 A:middle
And, again, if you sort
of look back and think

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:02.836 A:middle
And, again, if you sort
of look back and think

00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:05.106 A:middle
about why 40 years ago
this assumption was made,

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:06.646 A:middle
it was because it
made total sense.

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.186 A:middle
There was no such thing as
untrusted code being run

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:12.096 A:middle
because all the code
that would run was code

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:13.616 A:middle
that you manually
put on a punch card,

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.876 A:middle
walked up to a machine,
loaded and ran.

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.826 A:middle
So it was pretty reasonable to
say that that code should run

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
with your full privileges
and that

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.676 A:middle
that wouldn't be an
issue in practice.

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:26.706 A:middle
But, today, most machines
are single user machines.

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:28.626 A:middle
We run untrusted
code all the time.

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:29.776 A:middle
Every time you visit a website,

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:31.046 A:middle
that's what's happening
under the covers.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:34.396 A:middle
And so it's sort of clear

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:37.616 A:middle
that apps should be only
accessing the information they

00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:39.516 A:middle
actually need to
get their work done

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:41.856 A:middle
and not having unrestricted
access to your whole computer.

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:45.576 A:middle
I have an example
that I, that I like.

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:48.636 A:middle
This is a beautiful
new application updated

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:49.266 A:middle
for Mavericks.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:50.596 A:middle
It's called Watch Grass Grow.

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:56.056 A:middle
I spent a lot of time with
this app and it's gorgeous.

00:04:56.056 --> 00:05:00.276 A:middle
It shows grass growing in
real time and, you know,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.056 --> 00:05:00.276 A:middle
It shows grass growing in
real time and, you know,

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.436 A:middle
it connects to the network
every once in a while

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.066 A:middle
to pick up new grass assets.

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:08.136 A:middle
So, for instance, droplets
on shimmering blades of grass

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.056 A:middle
that come over the network.

00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:12.126 A:middle
Beautiful stuff, but this
app should never be able

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:13.396 A:middle
to access any of my data.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:16.396 A:middle
If somehow, in the process of
making these network requests,

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:17.806 A:middle
this app were to
become exploited,

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:20.956 A:middle
it could normally
access all of my data.

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:22.286 A:middle
It could read my E-mail,

00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:23.986 A:middle
it could change my computer
settings, it could look

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:24.956 A:middle
at my browsing history.

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:27.136 A:middle
All stuff that it should
never be able to do.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:33.656 A:middle
And the way that the computing
industry has traditionally dealt

00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:36.406 A:middle
with this is by erecting
user interfaces that try

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:38.756 A:middle
and get users to make
the right decision

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:42.376 A:middle
which is what this normally
looks like to a normal user.

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:46.866 A:middle
In other words, security
interfaces generally don't work.

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:49.426 A:middle
They're expecting way too
much background understanding

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.356 A:middle
of how computers work from
normal users who don't have

00:05:52.356 --> 00:05:53.106 A:middle
that kind of knowledge.

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:57.226 A:middle
And, as a result, over the years
users have actually basically

00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:59.746 A:middle
been conditioned to just
look for the Allow button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:02.526 A:middle
And press it because it
maximizes the chances

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:04.716 A:middle
that they can get done the thing
they were trying to get done.

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:07.436 A:middle
Obviously, rendering
the whole point

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:08.666 A:middle
of the user interface moot.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:13.916 A:middle
There's this great saying
in Washington, D.C.,

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:15.656 A:middle
it's a political
saying which says,

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.476 A:middle
if you're explaining you're
losing, and I think it applies

00:06:18.476 --> 00:06:19.876 A:middle
to security interfaces as well.

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:24.586 A:middle
If you're hoping that a user
understands the details of X.509

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:27.516 A:middle
and SSL certificates and can
make a valid decision about what

00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:29.156 A:middle
to do, you're probably losing.

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:32.246 A:middle
So, that is how things
used to be and, obviously,

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:35.166 A:middle
the landscape has really changed
a lot in the last few years.

00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:38.706 A:middle
Tons of apps and
tons of developers,

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:41.676 A:middle
it's never been this
easy to be a developer

00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:44.016 A:middle
or to write apps
largely facilitated

00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:45.316 A:middle
by the App Store revolution.

00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:49.236 A:middle
And, while that's happened,

00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:50.876 A:middle
computers have also
basically started

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:52.246 A:middle
to be always on networks.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:56.146 A:middle
Ubiquitous Wi-Fi and, for
mobile devices, radios,

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:59.706 A:middle
our computers spend much,
much more time connected

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:03.026 A:middle
than they do disconnected which
didn't use to be the case.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:03.026 A:middle
than they do disconnected which
didn't use to be the case.

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:05.976 A:middle
Finding new software, super
easy; it's never been this easy.

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:08.896 A:middle
And so it really underscores
that today's challenge

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:12.006 A:middle
for security is to isolate data
between different programs,

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:13.196 A:middle
not between different users.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:20.806 A:middle
So, when I normally try and
pitch people on, you know,

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:23.206 A:middle
how some of this
background works,

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:27.196 A:middle
I get a lot of different
responses.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:32.086 A:middle
And one frequent one
is developers saying,

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:35.516 A:middle
well I have a really simple
app, it doesn't do much.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:39.546 A:middle
And I am very careful,
I understand security

00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:41.436 A:middle
and I'm pretty sure that my
code doesn't actually have

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:44.576 A:middle
vulnerabilities so why do I
have to bother with any of this?

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:48.996 A:middle
And the answer is because even
though your app may be simple

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.356 A:middle
and pretty constrained
in what it does,

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:53.736 A:middle
remember that you're linking
against millions and millions

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:56.876 A:middle
and millions of lines of system
libraries and other libraries

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:01.536 A:middle
and frameworks which are doing
incredibly complex things behind

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:01.536 A:middle
and frameworks which are doing
incredibly complex things behind

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:03.626 A:middle
the scenes where you might
not have even thought of them.

00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:06.636 A:middle
So, you know, you might
have a super simple app

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:10.226 A:middle
that just shows a web view
to authenticate the user.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:13.726 A:middle
That web view, in
terms of complexity,

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.126 A:middle
is practically a small
operating system, right?

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:19.466 A:middle
It's millions of lines
of code to render HTML,

00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:21.596 A:middle
to run a just-in-time
JavaScript compiler,

00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:23.676 A:middle
it's a huge amount
of complexity.

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:28.566 A:middle
And a single vulnerability
anywhere in all the code

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:32.135 A:middle
that your app has plus all
the code it links against used

00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:34.336 A:middle
to mean a really bad
day for the user.

00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:37.166 A:middle
Attack finds one
hole, attack wins.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:40.806 A:middle
There's no containment
of damage, that's it.

00:08:42.996 --> 00:08:46.256 A:middle
So it's against this
backdrop that, in Lion,

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:49.506 A:middle
we introduced App Sandbox,
a mechanism that tried

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:53.456 A:middle
to make it much easier to write
secure applications for OS X.

00:08:54.606 --> 00:08:58.666 A:middle
And it tried to do this by
doing something really different

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.596 A:middle
which is, instead of trying
to drive security policy

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.596 A:middle
which is, instead of trying
to drive security policy

00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:04.746 A:middle
by explicit user
choices through prompts,

00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:07.546 A:middle
it tried to drive security
policy through user intent.

00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:10.526 A:middle
And it tried to, in effect,

00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:15.726 A:middle
do this so that it can then
contain damage from exploitation

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:19.616 A:middle
or even a misbehaving app such
as pathological bugs in the code

00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:22.366 A:middle
that would try to delete
or corrupt user data.

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:25.526 A:middle
So, how does this work?

00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:27.186 A:middle
Well, the premise is this.

00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:30.526 A:middle
You write your apps which means
you know what your apps are

00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:33.206 A:middle
meant to be able to do when
they're working properly.

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:36.196 A:middle
We take that app in
the operating system,

00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:38.686 A:middle
we assign it its own
space on the file system

00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:39.646 A:middle
that we call a container,

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:43.696 A:middle
and then the operating system
lets the user control what other

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:45.256 A:middle
data your app can get access to.

00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:48.286 A:middle
And it does this by making all
the special cases like drag

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.496 A:middle
and drop and recent items

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:55.276 A:middle
and so forth just work
magically under the covers.

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:57.056 A:middle
So, let's talk about
the key components here.

00:09:57.476 --> 00:10:00.856 A:middle
I mentioned that you specify
what your app is meant

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.476 --> 00:10:00.856 A:middle
I mentioned that you specify
what your app is meant

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:01.596 A:middle
to be able to do.

00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:04.626 A:middle
And the way it does this is by
using what we call entitlements.

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:06.726 A:middle
Entitlements are
actually very simple,

00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:08.456 A:middle
they're just a very
simple plist.

00:10:08.496 --> 00:10:11.286 A:middle
You can-- Xcode gives you a
beautiful interface for it

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.576 A:middle
and I'll show you that in a bit,

00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:14.886 A:middle
but it is just a
very simple plist.

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.796 A:middle
And the idea behind entitlements
is that they express concepts

00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:22.196 A:middle
of access that should be
easily understandable even

00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:24.116 A:middle
to an end user even
though it's not ever meant

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:25.176 A:middle
to be seen by an end user.

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:27.956 A:middle
So here are some examples of
things that are entitlements.

00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:29.606 A:middle
Entitlements are things
like I want to be able

00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:31.756 A:middle
to access a Downloads folder,
I want to be able to talk

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.086 A:middle
to the network, I
want to be able

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:34.906 A:middle
to access the user's
Address Book.

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:42.096 A:middle
Now I mentioned that we
take your app and we put it

00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
in a container and the way this
works is there's actually no

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:45.406 A:middle
deep magic happening.

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:46.776 A:middle
When we're launching your app,

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.846 A:middle
we set 2 environment
variables called Home

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:52.216 A:middle
and CFFIXED-USER-HOME
and we point them

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:53.666 A:middle
at a file system location

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.486 A:middle
that we assign specifically
for your app.

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:57.886 A:middle
And we basically pretend

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:00.456 A:middle
that that location is the
user's Home Directory.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:00.456 A:middle
that that location is the
user's Home Directory.

00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:03.456 A:middle
So, here's what that looks
like where we have an app,

00:11:03.456 --> 00:11:06.276 A:middle
we just put in a Sandbox
and, if in the app,

00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:08.536 A:middle
we have a direct
open system call

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:11.446 A:middle
with the specific path inside
their real Home Directory

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:15.146 A:middle
of the user, the Sandbox
denies this access.

00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:17.996 A:middle
And says, actually no, that's in
the user's real Home Directory,

00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:21.726 A:middle
this aisle doesn't yet
have access to that.

00:11:21.936 --> 00:11:26.086 A:middle
But if the app, instead, calls
Apple API like NSHomeDirectory,

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:29.086 A:middle
well the answer that it'll
actually get is its own

00:11:29.086 --> 00:11:32.636 A:middle
container location which means
that it's within the Sandbox

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:33.966 A:middle
which means access is allowed.

00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:40.496 A:middle
So then, you might say, well
okay, but an app is not going

00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:44.036 A:middle
to be very useful if all it can
access are files that it read,

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.566 A:middle
then wrote in its
own little space.

00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:46.746 A:middle
How does it actually get access

00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:48.406 A:middle
to the real files
that the user has?

00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:50.846 A:middle
And the answer is the Powerbox.

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:55.106 A:middle
The Powerbox is a trusted
operating system facility

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:58.496 A:middle
in OS X that makes it
so that Cocoa NSOpen

00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
and NSSave panels are
actually drawn out of process

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
and NSSave panels are
actually drawn out of process

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:03.546 A:middle
by a trusted system service.

00:12:03.916 --> 00:12:06.436 A:middle
And, if you think about
open and save panels,

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:09.696 A:middle
they're this really unambiguous
declaration of user intent.

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:11.786 A:middle
If you have an app open
and there's an open panel

00:12:11.786 --> 00:12:13.396 A:middle
and the user select
a file or folder,

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:15.766 A:middle
it's really clear what
the user's trying to do.

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:19.886 A:middle
They're saying I want to open
this file or folder in this app.

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:22.206 A:middle
So by moving the
open and save panels

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:25.746 A:middle
to be a trusted system service,
we can take that declaration

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:28.066 A:middle
of user intent and then
form security policy

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:30.816 A:middle
around it specifically
by making those files

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:33.666 A:middle
and folders then
available to the app.

00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:36.316 A:middle
Let me show you what
this looks like.

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:39.016 A:middle
Here's an app, it links
against AppKit in the top

00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:41.006 A:middle
and we're going to
put it in the Sandbox.

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:44.016 A:middle
And let's say that the
app wants access to a file

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:46.606 A:middle
within tilde documents.

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:51.096 A:middle
Well an NSOpen panel is
presented and normally,

00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:54.166 A:middle
because this app is
Sandboxed, if AppKit were to try

00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:55.916 A:middle
and get access to tilde
Documents directly,

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:56.556 A:middle
this would just fail.

00:12:56.556 --> 00:12:58.006 A:middle
The sandbox would say,
no you're not allowed.

00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
But what happens in
the App Sandbox world,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
But what happens in
the App Sandbox world,

00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:03.496 A:middle
because of the Powerbox, is that
AppKit realizes it's running

00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:05.316 A:middle
in a Sandbox and so, instead

00:13:05.316 --> 00:13:06.836 A:middle
of presenting the
open panel directly,

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.826 A:middle
it calls out the Powerbox
and says, Powerbox,

00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:10.906 A:middle
please present an open
panel on my behalf.

00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.426 A:middle
Powerbox also links against
AppKit, but it's not Sandboxed

00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:15.946 A:middle
so it has access to documents

00:13:16.776 --> 00:13:21.636 A:middle
which means it can draw the
open panel on the app's behalf.

00:13:22.286 --> 00:13:24.506 A:middle
This looks exactly like
it's always looked.

00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:26.566 A:middle
You never know that
you're using the Powerbox,

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:30.116 A:middle
it's just completely
under the covers.

00:13:30.866 --> 00:13:33.816 A:middle
But, once a user selects a file
or folder in this open panel,

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:37.386 A:middle
that file or folder is then
made available directly

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:40.646 A:middle
in the Sandbox of your app.

00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:49.006 A:middle
Finally, XPC Services
are the easiest mechanism

00:13:49.576 --> 00:13:52.006 A:middle
that there's ever existed to
split up parts of your app

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:54.846 A:middle
into separate functional units

00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:57.896 A:middle
that can have different security
policies assigned to them.

00:13:59.166 --> 00:13:59.806 A:middle
Why does this matter?

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.396 A:middle
Well because, as apps get
more and more complex,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.396 A:middle
Well because, as apps get
more and more complex,

00:14:02.396 --> 00:14:03.796 A:middle
they do more and more things.

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:07.876 A:middle
And if, in the end, you have a
single monolithic app that has

00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:10.546 A:middle
to be able to access all
kinds of things from hardware

00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:12.666 A:middle
to private information
to user documents.

00:14:13.146 --> 00:14:16.096 A:middle
Then, even though the app
Sandbox still provides some

00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:18.396 A:middle
mitigation if that app
were to become exploited,

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:21.336 A:middle
it may be that an
attack on that app

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:24.386 A:middle
that succeeds can already get
access to so much information

00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:26.966 A:middle
that maybe that's all
the attacker cares about.

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:31.346 A:middle
So to try and mitigate this,
you can break out pieces

00:14:31.346 --> 00:14:35.126 A:middle
of your code, especially, highly
sensitive pieces of your code,

00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:38.236 A:middle
for instance, the deal with
the network into XPC services

00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:39.476 A:middle
that are made available
to your app.

00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:42.496 A:middle
And then you can, basically,
Sandbox those independently

00:14:42.926 --> 00:14:44.956 A:middle
and restrict their
access to things

00:14:44.956 --> 00:14:46.166 A:middle
like sensitive user information.

00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:51.176 A:middle
And with XPC, the service's
lifetime is fully managed

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:52.846 A:middle
by the operating system
so you don't have to worry

00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:54.876 A:middle
about starting them
up and tearing them

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.576 A:middle
down when you need to.

00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:57.786 A:middle
You don't have to
worry about, you know,

00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:00.176 A:middle
whether they're running
when you want them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:00.176 A:middle
whether they're running
when you want them.

00:15:00.176 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
It's just done for
you by the OS.

00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:06.166 A:middle
So that's a lot of concepts.

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:10.966 A:middle
What does this actually
look like?

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:14.506 A:middle
I'm going to show you this
on TextEdit because it's--

00:15:14.506 --> 00:15:19.496 A:middle
you can look at that source code
and TextEdit has been Sandboxed

00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:22.476 A:middle
since Lion, but we're going to
pretend it's not and we're going

00:15:22.476 --> 00:15:24.796 A:middle
to show you what it
looks like to Sandbox it.

00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:27.776 A:middle
And the process we're going
to follow here is we're going

00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:30.186 A:middle
to look at the Entitlements
list and kind

00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:31.986 A:middle
of pick the ones
we think make sense

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:33.186 A:middle
for a program like TextEdit.

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:36.426 A:middle
We're going to code sign
TextEdit when building it

00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:38.436 A:middle
which will cause the
Entitlements to take effect.

00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:42.136 A:middle
We'll double check that
TextEdit, as it runs,

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:43.676 A:middle
is in fact Sandboxed
like we expect.

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:46.696 A:middle
And then, finally, we'll
look for Sandbox violations

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.716 A:middle
that the OS is reporting
to try and figure

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.986 A:middle
out if we're maybe missing
some Entitlements that we need.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:56.466 A:middle
And I should note that
for the last two WWDCs,

00:15:56.696 --> 00:15:59.466 A:middle
the app I've used as
my demo app is Adium

00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:02.706 A:middle
which is a really popular
instant messaging client.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:02.706 A:middle
which is a really popular
instant messaging client.

00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:05.746 A:middle
And I'm thrilled to be
switching to TextEdit this year

00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:08.446 A:middle
because the actual Adium
app became Sandboxed.

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:10.136 A:middle
The developers took
it, Sandboxed it,

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.106 A:middle
and so if you download Adium
now, it is Sandboxed so I feel

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:17.666 A:middle
like I needed a new example.

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:21.436 A:middle
Okay. So here's the
TextEdit project.

00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:29.386 A:middle
And what we'll do is
just run it, here it is.

00:16:29.686 --> 00:16:33.406 A:middle
And what I've done is I've
grabbed activity monitor here

00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:35.266 A:middle
and I've filtered it by TextEdit

00:16:35.446 --> 00:16:37.006 A:middle
so you can see the
process right there.

00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:39.616 A:middle
And in the View menu in columns,

00:16:39.616 --> 00:16:41.116 A:middle
I've actually enabled
the Sandbox column

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:43.476 A:middle
so that you can see that
right now TextEdit is

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:45.246 A:middle
running unsandboxed.

00:16:45.246 --> 00:16:49.086 A:middle
So let's see if we
can Sandbox it.

00:16:50.196 --> 00:16:52.556 A:middle
We're going to click
on the target and,

00:16:52.556 --> 00:16:54.736 A:middle
in the Capabilities
tab in Xcode 5,

00:16:54.736 --> 00:16:57.176 A:middle
it's really this very
nice graphical editor

00:16:57.176 --> 00:17:00.226 A:middle
of various capabilities, App
Sandbox is just one set of them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.176 --> 00:17:00.226 A:middle
of various capabilities, App
Sandbox is just one set of them.

00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:03.606 A:middle
So, we'll flip on the
App Sandbox switch

00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:06.596 A:middle
and TextEdit obviously needs
to be able to edit files

00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:08.965 A:middle
that a user selects
so that seems

00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:11.175 A:middle
like an obvious Entitlement to
give it if it wants to be able

00:17:11.175 --> 00:17:13.215 A:middle
to both read them and write to
them so we'll say read/write

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:14.506 A:middle
to user selected files.

00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:16.126 A:middle
That seems about right.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:20.906 A:middle
Let's run it now.

00:17:21.126 --> 00:17:25.246 A:middle
There's TextEdit and in Activity
Monitor, you'll notice now

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:26.925 A:middle
that the Sandbox
column indicates yes.

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
So this thing is
running Sandbox.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.326 A:middle
So that's it, is there
anything more to it?

00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:34.636 A:middle
Well, we want to check if there
were any errors encountered

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:38.306 A:middle
while TextEdit actually ran in
the Sandbox so we'll switch here

00:17:38.616 --> 00:17:42.376 A:middle
to Console where I'm filtering
by output of the Sandbox daemon.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.866 A:middle
And, indeed, you'll notice
that there's actually a bunch

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:49.356 A:middle
of messages indicating
that SandboxD is telling us

00:17:49.356 --> 00:17:53.416 A:middle
that TextEdit was denied certain
operations by the Sandbox.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:57.826 A:middle
So it looks like it was denied
the ability to do a mach lookup

00:17:57.826 --> 00:18:02.276 A:middle
on SCNetworkReachability and
some system socket access

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.826 --> 00:18:02.276 A:middle
on SCNetworkReachability and
some system socket access

00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:04.966 A:middle
and then some more mach
lookups to com.apple.networkd.

00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:06.776 A:middle
So why is that?

00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:12.486 A:middle
Well, it's because this
particular TextEdit tries

00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:14.016 A:middle
to make a network
connection when it starts

00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:17.616 A:middle
and I didn't enable
that in my Entitlements.

00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:20.176 A:middle
All I need for TextEdit

00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:22.196 A:middle
to be able access the
network here is allow it

00:18:22.196 --> 00:18:23.886 A:middle
to make outbound
connections to the network

00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:25.366 A:middle
to act as a network client.

00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:28.186 A:middle
So why don't we enable that?

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:30.076 A:middle
And rerun TextEdit.

00:18:30.556 --> 00:18:33.196 A:middle
There it is.

00:18:34.326 --> 00:18:37.766 A:middle
And you'll notice there were no
more violations shown meaning

00:18:38.156 --> 00:18:41.656 A:middle
TextEdit is running Sandboxed,
everything's operating

00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:46.036 A:middle
like we want, no violations
are getting logged, that's it.

00:18:46.036 --> 00:18:46.926 A:middle
TextEdit is Sandboxed.

00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:48.636 A:middle
What did we really
accomplish there?

00:18:48.636 --> 00:18:49.966 A:middle
Why did we do this?

00:18:50.576 --> 00:18:53.726 A:middle
We did it because, even though
that took us all of 3 minutes

00:18:53.726 --> 00:18:57.326 A:middle
to do, the TextEdit before we
Sandboxed it and the TextEdit

00:18:57.326 --> 00:18:59.916 A:middle
after we Sandboxed it
behave very differently

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.436 A:middle
if you can exploit them.

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:04.356 A:middle
Right now, when it's
Sandboxed, if you are able

00:19:04.356 --> 00:19:08.006 A:middle
to somehow attack TextEdit and
exploit it, all you get access

00:19:08.006 --> 00:19:09.786 A:middle
to as an attacker are the files

00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:11.996 A:middle
that the user currently
has open in TextEdit.

00:19:12.656 --> 00:19:15.486 A:middle
Nothing else, no other
access to the user's disk.

00:19:16.206 --> 00:19:18.026 A:middle
No other access to
the user's hardware.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:20.096 A:middle
No access to user's E-mail,

00:19:20.096 --> 00:19:22.826 A:middle
no access to user's browsing
history, you're contained.

00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:24.646 A:middle
You can't install applications,

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:26.486 A:middle
you can't change the
TextEdit application

00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:28.266 A:middle
to put a Trojan in there.

00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:29.776 A:middle
You're pretty tightly contained.

00:19:29.776 --> 00:19:32.866 A:middle
And, in order to really launch
a successful attack here,

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:35.236 A:middle
you need to chain
multiple vulnerabilities,

00:19:35.236 --> 00:19:37.856 A:middle
some of them probably
kernel vulnerabilities

00:19:38.226 --> 00:19:39.906 A:middle
to really pull off
a strong attack.

00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:43.046 A:middle
So that's a tremendous
improvement in the safety

00:19:43.206 --> 00:19:44.166 A:middle
of TextEdit as an app.

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:50.626 A:middle
And if that resolved it
for very many of you,

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.656 A:middle
that is about all the exposure
to App Sandbox that you'll need.

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:57.916 A:middle
You'll be able to go in and look
at the Capabilities interface

00:19:57.916 --> 00:20:00.756 A:middle
in Xcode 5, tick
some boxes, try it,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.916 --> 00:20:00.756 A:middle
in Xcode 5, tick
some boxes, try it,

00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:04.126 A:middle
check for violations,
and you'll be done.

00:20:04.316 --> 00:20:07.176 A:middle
But, as your apps
get more complex,

00:20:07.176 --> 00:20:09.736 A:middle
you may also need some
advanced functionality and I'd

00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:11.766 A:middle
like to show you what
else we have on offer.

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:15.906 A:middle
The first thing I'm
going to talk

00:20:15.906 --> 00:20:18.096 A:middle
about is a mechanism called
Security Scoped Bookmarks.

00:20:18.636 --> 00:20:22.946 A:middle
And, to understand
where this comes from,

00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:28.616 A:middle
I have to tell you a bit about
how files and access given

00:20:28.616 --> 00:20:31.396 A:middle
to files are managed
as your app runs.

00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:34.256 A:middle
So your app starts, it has
access to nothing outside

00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:37.706 A:middle
of its container, the user
then gives it access to a file

00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:39.686 A:middle
or folder through the Powerbox.

00:20:40.266 --> 00:20:41.796 A:middle
And so now, while
the app is running,

00:20:41.796 --> 00:20:43.486 A:middle
it has access to this new file.

00:20:44.246 --> 00:20:46.926 A:middle
But, as soon as your app
quits, it loses that access.

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:49.476 A:middle
The next time it starts, it no
longer has access to the file

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:50.896 A:middle
that the user opened last time.

00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:55.076 A:middle
And this is the only reasonable
default because, otherwise,

00:20:55.356 --> 00:20:57.856 A:middle
the amount of things that apps
can access would just grow

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.236 A:middle
without bound, over time,
as the apps are used.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.236 A:middle
without bound, over time,
as the apps are used.

00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:03.346 A:middle
So defaulting to losing the
access as the app restarts,

00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:04.706 A:middle
is the right thing to do.

00:21:05.286 --> 00:21:08.016 A:middle
But it's not, it can't
be the only option.

00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:10.926 A:middle
There are apps that really
legitimately need to be able

00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:12.906 A:middle
to preserve access
to files and folders

00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:14.686 A:middle
that a user selected
across launch.

00:21:15.436 --> 00:21:17.716 A:middle
And, usually, those use
cases fall into 2 categories.

00:21:18.696 --> 00:21:20.806 A:middle
There are what we call
app-scoped bookmarks

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.886 A:middle
where the preservation of access
to files and folders comes

00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:25.546 A:middle
as part of the app's
configuration.

00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:28.296 A:middle
And then there are
document-scoped bookmarks

00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:30.496 A:middle
which pertain to
document formats

00:21:30.586 --> 00:21:33.436 A:middle
where the document itself can
actually reference files all

00:21:33.436 --> 00:21:35.506 A:middle
over the disk and you
want to be able to have

00:21:35.506 --> 00:21:38.166 A:middle
that continue working as
the document is opened

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:40.926 A:middle
and closed potentially
across different apps.

00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:46.856 A:middle
So, for app-scoped bookmarks,
there is no special Entitlement,

00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:49.806 A:middle
it's actually provided-- the
ability to use this is provided

00:21:49.806 --> 00:21:53.536 A:middle
if you simply have the user
selected files bookmark.

00:21:54.176 --> 00:21:55.666 A:middle
And what I have here
is an example

00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:59.396 A:middle
from the Mail app where--
which is Sandboxed by the way.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.056 --> 00:22:02.486 A:middle
You can see that you
can select the folder

00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:05.216 A:middle
to which attachments will
get downloaded automatically.

00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
And so, if you think about it,

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:10.526 A:middle
if the user chooses a different
folder here and mail loses

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:13.376 A:middle
that access on re-launch,
that wouldn't be very helpful.

00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:15.466 A:middle
So, somehow, it needs
to be able to say,

00:22:15.466 --> 00:22:17.026 A:middle
I'm going to preserve
the user selection

00:22:17.026 --> 00:22:18.706 A:middle
and always have access to it.

00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:23.336 A:middle
So app-scoped bookmarks
allow you to do this

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:26.986 A:middle
and they lock the files or
folders that the user selected

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:30.256 A:middle
to your specific app running
as that specific user.

00:22:30.776 --> 00:22:32.686 A:middle
So here's what that looks like.

00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:35.296 A:middle
The user is going to
pick a file or folder

00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:38.606 A:middle
and make access available to
your app such as your Powerbox.

00:22:38.896 --> 00:22:43.346 A:middle
Your app is going to turn around
and take that file and pass it

00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:45.056 A:middle
on to the
bookmarkDataWithOptions API.

00:22:45.196 --> 00:22:48.586 A:middle
This is the same API that's been
around for years now, actually,

00:22:48.586 --> 00:22:49.846 A:middle
just for normal bookmarks.

00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:56.096 A:middle
And this API is going to produce
just an NSData, an opaque blob

00:22:56.096 --> 00:22:58.686 A:middle
that represents the app-scoped
bookmark which your app is free

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:05.506 A:middle
to store anywhere it pleases
such as in its container

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:05.506 A:middle
to store anywhere it pleases
such as in its container

00:23:05.506 --> 00:23:09.596 A:middle
as a file or in user
defaults or even in Core Data.

00:23:09.716 --> 00:23:10.766 A:middle
It doesn't matter
so long as it's

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.326 A:middle
in a place that's
accessible to the app later.

00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:16.936 A:middle
Then, on next launch, when the
app needs access to this file

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:19.686 A:middle
or folder, it'll simply
fish out that NSData

00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:20.726 A:middle
from wherever it stored it,

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.506 A:middle
pass it into the
URLByResolvingBookmarkData API

00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:26.416 A:middle
which will check that the
blob came from the right app

00:23:27.256 --> 00:23:32.176 A:middle
and the API provides access
to the file or folder.

00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:34.366 A:middle
If some other app were
somehow to get a hold

00:23:34.366 --> 00:23:36.166 A:middle
of that same app-scoped
bookmark,

00:23:36.986 --> 00:23:38.976 A:middle
this simply wouldn't work,
the API would say, no,

00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:41.976 A:middle
you did not create this
bookmark, you cannot resolve it.

00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:42.926 A:middle
The other use case,

00:23:43.076 --> 00:23:46.076 A:middle
the document-scoped
bookmark use case is useful

00:23:46.076 --> 00:23:49.836 A:middle
if you have a document format
that needs to be able to link

00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:52.426 A:middle
to movies or pictures
or other large files

00:23:52.426 --> 00:23:55.206 A:middle
that may be all over the disk.

00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:59.216 A:middle
And the restrictions
differ for document-scoped

00:23:59.216 --> 00:24:00.016 A:middle
and app-scoped bookmarks.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.216 --> 00:24:00.016 A:middle
and app-scoped bookmarks.

00:24:00.016 --> 00:24:03.946 A:middle
For document-scope, they
are openable by other apps,

00:24:04.096 --> 00:24:07.076 A:middle
but the target of the
bookmark cannot be

00:24:07.076 --> 00:24:09.036 A:middle
in a certain restricted
set of locations.

00:24:09.036 --> 00:24:12.096 A:middle
So you can't bookmark Contents
and things like tilde Library.

00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:14.796 A:middle
And currently you
can't document,

00:24:14.796 --> 00:24:18.736 A:middle
you can't bookmark folders,
it must be individual files.

00:24:19.306 --> 00:24:22.706 A:middle
So here's what the
document-scoped case looks like.

00:24:23.126 --> 00:24:25.846 A:middle
The user is going to create
the document in your app

00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:29.106 A:middle
and they're going to link
a movie into that document

00:24:29.146 --> 00:24:32.566 A:middle
so you're going to turn around
and actually pass both of these

00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:35.696 A:middle
into the bookmarkDataWithOptions
API and say, I am planning

00:24:35.696 --> 00:24:37.626 A:middle
to take this movie that
the user gave me access to

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:39.716 A:middle
and I'm planning to insert
it into this document.

00:24:39.716 --> 00:24:44.356 A:middle
And the API produces
another NSData blob

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:46.966 A:middle
that basically must be inserted

00:24:46.966 --> 00:24:48.996 A:middle
in the document you said you
were going to put it into.

00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:51.526 A:middle
So that's what your app does.

00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:55.706 A:middle
Then, when the user
reopens the document

00:24:55.706 --> 00:24:58.216 A:middle
which now has this link that,
currently, from your Sandbox,

00:24:58.216 --> 00:24:59.636 A:middle
you can't follow to the movie.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.576 --> 00:25:03.556 A:middle
You can take that security
scoped bookmark out of

00:25:03.556 --> 00:25:06.526 A:middle
that document and say, I
retrieved it from this document

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:07.396 A:middle
and here's the bookmark.

00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:10.126 A:middle
Pass both of those to the API,

00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:12.696 A:middle
the API will resolve the
bookmark, provide you access

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:15.676 A:middle
to the movie and now you
can recreate this link

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:17.616 A:middle
and follow the reference.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:21.816 A:middle
I should mention that, for
document-scoped bookmarks,

00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:25.046 A:middle
if you think about it, document
formats need to generally run

00:25:25.046 --> 00:25:25.936 A:middle
between different apps.

00:25:26.156 --> 00:25:28.316 A:middle
So if another app can
open the same document,

00:25:28.316 --> 00:25:30.346 A:middle
it can actually resolve
that very same bookmark.

00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.546 A:middle
So, as I mentioned,
there's no new API

00:25:37.546 --> 00:25:38.986 A:middle
to the security scoped
bookmarks,

00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:41.236 A:middle
it's the same bookmark
API that has been

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:42.886 A:middle
around for several years.

00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:46.326 A:middle
In case any of you are not
familiar with bookmark API,

00:25:46.446 --> 00:25:49.526 A:middle
it's actually the modern
replacement to things

00:25:49.526 --> 00:25:52.686 A:middle
like aliases and
FSRefs so, basically,

00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:58.636 A:middle
an API for being able to, as
best as the OS can, track files

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.406 A:middle
and folders as they move around
the file system or get renamed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.406 A:middle
and folders as they move around
the file system or get renamed.

00:26:02.466 --> 00:26:04.266 A:middle
But there's one critical
difference

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:08.846 A:middle
between the normal bookmark
resolution API and using

00:26:08.846 --> 00:26:10.646 A:middle
that same API for
security scoped bookmarks.

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:14.086 A:middle
And that is that when you
resolve a security scope

00:26:14.086 --> 00:26:17.076 A:middle
bookmark, what you get back
is what we call a security

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:18.406 A:middle
scoped NSURL.

00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:21.876 A:middle
It's an NSURL, it tells
you where the file is,

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:23.956 A:middle
but you can't immediately
go and follow it.

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:26.566 A:middle
It has not yet been made
available inside your Sandbox.

00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:29.696 A:middle
Instead, you are responsible
for calling a method

00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:32.066 A:middle
on that URL object
called startAccessing

00:26:32.066 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
SecurityScopedResource.

00:26:34.006 --> 00:26:36.336 A:middle
And it's the act of calling
that method that makes the file

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:38.386 A:middle
or folder available
within your Sandbox.

00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:41.446 A:middle
When you're done with
the file or folder,

00:26:42.596 --> 00:26:44.756 A:middle
you have to match the call

00:26:44.756 --> 00:26:47.156 A:middle
with stopAccessing
SecurityScopedResource

00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:49.906 A:middle
which tells the operating
system to free up resources

00:26:49.906 --> 00:26:51.266 A:middle
that it's using on tracking

00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:53.776 A:middle
which additional files are
available inside your Sandbox.

00:26:54.586 --> 00:26:58.386 A:middle
This is really important because
if you don't call StopAccessing

00:26:58.776 --> 00:27:01.806 A:middle
and you start accumulating many,
many, many Sandbox extensions

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.776 --> 00:27:01.806 A:middle
and you start accumulating many,
many, many Sandbox extensions

00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:04.756 A:middle
that were done in this way,
eventually your app will,

00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:07.636 A:middle
basically, not be able
to take in anymore.

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:10.886 A:middle
And opening files through the
Powerbox will start failing.

00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:14.376 A:middle
It's not a good place
to be, basically,

00:27:14.506 --> 00:27:15.716 A:middle
until your app is restarted.

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:18.786 A:middle
So balancing these
is very important.

00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:25.316 A:middle
One other thing that App Sandbox
focuses on is making sure that,

00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:29.606 A:middle
by default, applications
really can't talk

00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:30.616 A:middle
to each other directly.

00:27:31.226 --> 00:27:34.346 A:middle
Generally, communication between
Sandbox apps has to happen

00:27:34.346 --> 00:27:36.536 A:middle
through some kind of
operating system interface

00:27:36.536 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
and mediation which, again,

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:41.086 A:middle
turns out to be the
right default.

00:27:41.706 --> 00:27:44.446 A:middle
But there are totally
legitimate use cases

00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:46.446 A:middle
where multiple applications
want to be able

00:27:46.446 --> 00:27:48.136 A:middle
to establish direct
communication channels

00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:50.936 A:middle
or just share files
and folders on disk.

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:54.436 A:middle
The most common case for this
is suites of applications

00:27:54.436 --> 00:27:58.336 A:middle
from the same developer where
it makes sense that they want

00:27:58.336 --> 00:28:00.736 A:middle
to have a scratch base on
disk that they all share

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.336 --> 00:28:00.736 A:middle
to have a scratch base on
disk that they all share

00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:04.716 A:middle
or that they want to be
able to do direct IPC.

00:28:04.936 --> 00:28:08.146 A:middle
And another very common use
case is apps that have a helper.

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:09.786 A:middle
For instance, a login item

00:28:09.786 --> 00:28:11.726 A:middle
that runs every time
the user logs in,

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.606 A:middle
even when the main
app is not running,

00:28:13.806 --> 00:28:15.526 A:middle
and then when the main
app starts running,

00:28:15.686 --> 00:28:18.216 A:middle
it wants to be able to somehow
establish direct communication

00:28:18.216 --> 00:28:20.466 A:middle
to the helper that's
been running in the menu.

00:28:21.386 --> 00:28:23.066 A:middle
So, to solve that problem,

00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:24.876 A:middle
we have a mechanism
called application groups.

00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:28.546 A:middle
The idea is it's just another
Entitlement that you can put

00:28:29.186 --> 00:28:33.446 A:middle
on multiple apps or an
app and its helpers.

00:28:34.266 --> 00:28:38.636 A:middle
And it's prefixed by your
Apple Team ID and, after that,

00:28:38.636 --> 00:28:39.746 A:middle
it's whatever name you want.

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:44.196 A:middle
And applications that have the
same application group name get

00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:46.926 A:middle
to directly communicate and
share file system locations.

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:50.326 A:middle
So here's what that looks like.

00:28:50.326 --> 00:28:52.546 A:middle
Normally we have an app,
it gets its own container

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:54.296 A:middle
and it can access that
container just fine.

00:28:54.906 --> 00:28:57.166 A:middle
And here we have a helper,
maybe as a login item.

00:28:57.396 --> 00:29:00.736 A:middle
Well, our main app can't access
the helper's container directly.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.396 --> 00:29:00.736 A:middle
Well, our main app can't access
the helper's container directly.

00:29:00.736 --> 00:29:02.316 A:middle
The Sandbox prohibits this.

00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:05.646 A:middle
But, if we create an
Entitlement, and we say,

00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:06.836 A:middle
here we're actually
going to put this

00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:10.216 A:middle
into myApp application group,
and we place that Entitlement

00:29:10.216 --> 00:29:12.606 A:middle
on both our app and our helper.

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:16.896 A:middle
Now a shared location comes
into being on the file system

00:29:17.126 --> 00:29:18.676 A:middle
that both of these
can access directly.

00:29:22.716 --> 00:29:26.486 A:middle
In addition, as I mentioned,
certain IPC primitives like mach

00:29:26.486 --> 00:29:27.886 A:middle
and posix become available

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.826 A:middle
for establishing direct
communication channels

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:32.216 A:middle
between the app and the helper
or between different apps

00:29:32.216 --> 00:29:34.446 A:middle
in a suite where apps
share an application group.

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:38.806 A:middle
We have an API called
SMLoginItemSetEnabled

00:29:39.206 --> 00:29:41.696 A:middle
that is fully App Sandbox
compatible that will allow you

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:45.076 A:middle
to run your helper as a login
item every time the user

00:29:45.076 --> 00:29:47.766 A:middle
logs in.

00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:51.416 A:middle
Normally the fact that the
Powerbox only provides access

00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:52.576 A:middle
to the file or the folder

00:29:52.576 --> 00:29:55.806 A:middle
that the user selected is
exactly what we want both

00:29:55.806 --> 00:29:58.806 A:middle
for the security properties
of App Sandbox and because

00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:00.226 A:middle
that sort of makes sense.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:00.226 A:middle
that sort of makes sense.

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:02.566 A:middle
But there are some cases

00:30:02.756 --> 00:30:05.566 A:middle
where you want just a
little bit more access.

00:30:06.426 --> 00:30:11.186 A:middle
So one example since we used
TextEdit as our demo app,

00:30:11.636 --> 00:30:12.666 A:middle
TextEdit, as you probably know,

00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:15.046 A:middle
when you create a new document
creates a Rich Text Format

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.236 A:middle
document, an RTF file.

00:30:16.976 --> 00:30:21.376 A:middle
But, if you drag a picture
into that file, TextEdit needs

00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:24.476 A:middle
to basically turn the file into
a directory, change its name

00:30:24.476 --> 00:30:28.886 A:middle
from whatever the name was .rtf
to whatever the name is .rtfd

00:30:29.396 --> 00:30:31.456 A:middle
so that it can basically
store these attachments

00:30:31.526 --> 00:30:32.326 A:middle
in the directory.

00:30:33.346 --> 00:30:36.406 A:middle
And normally, that
wouldn't work because trying

00:30:36.406 --> 00:30:39.706 A:middle
to rename blah.rtf
into blah.rtfd,

00:30:40.486 --> 00:30:42.186 A:middle
the Sandbox would
be prohibiting this.

00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:46.686 A:middle
The user did not give you access
to blah.rtfd so you can't do it.

00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:50.606 A:middle
So to solve this problem in a
specific narrow set of cases,

00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:52.846 A:middle
we have a facility
called Related Items

00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:55.326 A:middle
that lets you express
certain relationships

00:30:55.326 --> 00:30:57.246 A:middle
between file names
and their extensions.

00:30:58.096 --> 00:31:03.226 A:middle
And in this case, you can
specify that RTF is related

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.096 --> 00:31:03.226 A:middle
And in this case, you can
specify that RTF is related

00:31:03.226 --> 00:31:07.176 A:middle
to RTFD so that if the user
gives you access to blah.rtf,

00:31:07.516 --> 00:31:10.246 A:middle
you can also use
NSFilePresenter methods

00:31:10.486 --> 00:31:12.566 A:middle
to obtain access to blah.rtfd.

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:17.236 A:middle
This is how TextEdit does its
rename and there are a number

00:31:17.236 --> 00:31:19.296 A:middle
of similar use cases like
movie players wanting

00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:23.156 A:middle
to access subtitles which
are normally named the same

00:31:23.156 --> 00:31:25.086 A:middle
as a movie file but with a
different file extension.

00:31:26.286 --> 00:31:29.036 A:middle
This also requires a declaration
of which patterns are allowed

00:31:29.036 --> 00:31:30.986 A:middle
in the info plist and we
have some documentation

00:31:30.986 --> 00:31:32.046 A:middle
that shows you how to do this.

00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:37.946 A:middle
OS X for a long time has been
the best platform for automation

00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:40.706 A:middle
and rich automation
that there is.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:44.776 A:middle
And while App Sandbox never
imposed any restrictions

00:31:44.776 --> 00:31:47.906 A:middle
on how Sandboxed apps can
be scripted by the user,

00:31:48.796 --> 00:31:50.806 A:middle
it did impose rigorous
restrictions

00:31:50.806 --> 00:31:52.916 A:middle
on how Sandboxed apps
can script other apps.

00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:56.886 A:middle
And the reason for
this is pretty obvious

00:31:56.886 --> 00:31:57.526 A:middle
if you think about it.

00:31:57.526 --> 00:31:59.836 A:middle
If you have a Sandbox and
it's enforcing all these tight

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:03.566 A:middle
restrictions, but the Sandbox
allows a Sandboxed app to go

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:03.566 A:middle
restrictions, but the Sandbox
allows a Sandboxed app to go

00:32:03.566 --> 00:32:05.156 A:middle
and script Finder or Terminal,

00:32:05.736 --> 00:32:07.946 A:middle
then there's effectively
no Sandbox, right?

00:32:07.946 --> 00:32:08.676 A:middle
You can get those apps

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:10.526 A:middle
to do pretty much anything
you want on the system.

00:32:11.116 --> 00:32:14.326 A:middle
What we did is we created a
mechanism called Apple Event

00:32:14.326 --> 00:32:18.636 A:middle
Access Groups that allows
scriptable applications to mark

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:21.126 A:middle
up their scripting
definition and say

00:32:21.126 --> 00:32:23.776 A:middle
that certain groups
of events are safe.

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:26.426 A:middle
They're safe to be
invoked by Sandboxed apps.

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:28.876 A:middle
And this works for,
if you're familiar

00:32:28.876 --> 00:32:33.026 A:middle
with scripting definitions,
sort of the full richness

00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:37.466 A:middle
of that definition mechanism so
commands, classes, properties,

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
you name it, all of them can
be grouped into access groups.

00:32:40.286 --> 00:32:42.796 A:middle
So this is documented, then you
can take a look at how it works.

00:32:43.526 --> 00:32:46.966 A:middle
But it's also used by a number
of OS X apps already so,

00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:48.726 A:middle
for instance, Mail has
an access group called

00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:51.556 A:middle
com.apple.mail.compose
which means that now,

00:32:51.556 --> 00:32:55.536 A:middle
even if you're Sandboxed, you
can use scripting to ask mail

00:32:55.536 --> 00:32:58.956 A:middle
to pop open a compose window and
put some information in there

00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:00.666 A:middle
and get ready for the
user to send E-mail.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:00.666 A:middle
and get ready for the
user to send E-mail.

00:33:00.956 --> 00:33:02.976 A:middle
iTunes, similarly, has a
number of access groups

00:33:02.976 --> 00:33:04.456 A:middle
that you can use to
control the playback

00:33:04.456 --> 00:33:05.666 A:middle
or access library information.

00:33:06.186 --> 00:33:09.786 A:middle
And so the way this works is
there's a new Entitlement called

00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:13.846 A:middle
Scripting Targets where you
list for every app that you want

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:16.476 A:middle
to be able to script
which has access groups,

00:33:16.656 --> 00:33:18.716 A:middle
you list which access
groups your app wants

00:33:18.716 --> 00:33:22.126 A:middle
to be able to use.

00:33:22.126 --> 00:33:25.216 A:middle
For example, here's
the Entitlement,

00:33:25.366 --> 00:33:27.886 A:middle
if we want to script Mail, we're
going to say in this dictionary

00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:31.006 A:middle
that mail is the only key and
that its value is an array

00:33:31.006 --> 00:33:31.946 A:middle
which contains, in this case,

00:33:31.946 --> 00:33:34.866 A:middle
just one access group called
com.apple.mail.compose.

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:38.596 A:middle
Now it turns out that
there's one other familiar way

00:33:38.596 --> 00:33:42.416 A:middle
of doing scripting that a lot of
OS X apps want to be able to do

00:33:42.806 --> 00:33:46.876 A:middle
which is allowing the user
to select scripts that run

00:33:47.386 --> 00:33:50.416 A:middle
in reaction to certain things
happening inside the app.

00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:51.676 A:middle
Timer app might want to be able

00:33:51.676 --> 00:33:53.406 A:middle
to run a script when
the timer fires.

00:33:53.946 --> 00:33:56.486 A:middle
Mail actually supports
you saying

00:33:56.486 --> 00:34:01.176 A:middle
that when a certain mail rule is
triggered, a script should run.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:56.486 --> 00:34:01.176 A:middle
that when a certain mail rule is
triggered, a script should run.

00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:03.396 A:middle
Aperture allows you to set that
a certain script should run

00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:06.406 A:middle
after all your photos
have been imported.

00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:09.206 A:middle
And, traditionally,
this would mean

00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:11.606 A:middle
that the script is actually
executed by the application

00:34:11.846 --> 00:34:13.255 A:middle
which means, of course,
that it's subject

00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:14.766 A:middle
to the application Sandbox.

00:34:15.216 --> 00:34:16.176 A:middle
This is really problematic.

00:34:16.176 --> 00:34:18.116 A:middle
If the user is writing
scripts and expects to be able

00:34:18.116 --> 00:34:20.496 A:middle
to do whatever they want in
the context of the script

00:34:20.815 --> 00:34:22.786 A:middle
because the Sandbox will
simply prohibit those actions.

00:34:23.485 --> 00:34:27.246 A:middle
So we have a mechanism
called NSUserScriptTask

00:34:27.626 --> 00:34:29.025 A:middle
that now fully supports this.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:30.646 A:middle
And the way this works
is there's a folder

00:34:30.826 --> 00:34:32.815 A:middle
in tilde Library called
Application Scripts.

00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:36.275 A:middle
Under that folder, there's
a subfolder for every app

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:40.396 A:middle
that wants to use this
facility and any scripts

00:34:40.396 --> 00:34:44.346 A:middle
that the user drags into this
folder, the per app folder,

00:34:45.235 --> 00:34:47.786 A:middle
that app is then allowed to
ask the operating system to run

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.286 A:middle
with no Sandbox restrictions.

00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:54.315 A:middle
So the app can use API to
reveal that folder and Finder

00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:56.366 A:middle
and tell the user, if you want
to be able to run any scripts,

00:34:56.366 --> 00:34:57.476 A:middle
just drag them in this window.

00:34:57.926 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
Once that happens, those
scripts can run uninhibited

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.926 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
Once that happens, those
scripts can run uninhibited

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:01.196 A:middle
by the Sandbox.

00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:06.886 A:middle
So this is part of
Foundation, the thing to look

00:35:06.886 --> 00:35:09.056 A:middle
up in documentation
is NSUserScriptTask.

00:35:09.456 --> 00:35:13.416 A:middle
It supports all of the
scripting that you might care

00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:16.286 A:middle
about so anything from just
shell scripts to AppleScript

00:35:16.286 --> 00:35:19.186 A:middle
and even Automator
Workflows and there are ways

00:35:19.186 --> 00:35:21.176 A:middle
to customize exactly how
you want this to work.

00:35:21.526 --> 00:35:23.256 A:middle
There's no Entitlement
required to use this,

00:35:23.646 --> 00:35:25.266 A:middle
you can just simply use it.

00:35:25.856 --> 00:35:27.416 A:middle
Previously it was the case

00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:31.486 A:middle
that iTunes maintained an
XML file that, basically,

00:35:31.486 --> 00:35:34.176 A:middle
described all the information
about songs and other items

00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:35.366 A:middle
in the user's media library.

00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:42.176 A:middle
And this is still the case,
but if a Sandboxed app tried

00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:45.846 A:middle
to parse this XML database,

00:35:46.196 --> 00:35:49.836 A:middle
it would work fine
unless the user had songs

00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:53.156 A:middle
and other media outside of
their normal media directories.

00:35:53.156 --> 00:35:55.256 A:middle
So if they went into
iTunes and said I want

00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:58.036 A:middle
to manage my own library and
have songs on Network Volumes

00:35:58.036 --> 00:36:01.026 A:middle
or different disks and so
forth, then Sandbox apps,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.036 --> 00:36:01.026 A:middle
or different disks and so
forth, then Sandbox apps,

00:36:01.026 --> 00:36:03.206 A:middle
even though they could
find the paths of the songs

00:36:03.206 --> 00:36:05.266 A:middle
and the items they cared about,
they couldn't follow them

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:07.286 A:middle
because the Sandbox
would not allow it.

00:36:08.316 --> 00:36:11.026 A:middle
With iTunes 11, there's a
great new framework called

00:36:11.026 --> 00:36:12.486 A:middle
iTunesLibrary.framework

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:17.796 A:middle
that actually provides a great
Objective C API that you can use

00:36:18.146 --> 00:36:20.286 A:middle
to never have to parse
a line of XML again.

00:36:20.286 --> 00:36:23.046 A:middle
You can simply ask
it for contents

00:36:23.046 --> 00:36:24.176 A:middle
of the user's media library.

00:36:24.656 --> 00:36:28.216 A:middle
You can ask it to gain access
to those actual files on disk

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.656 A:middle
and what comes back
from the API,

00:36:30.196 --> 00:36:32.006 A:middle
just like with security
scoped bookmarks,

00:36:32.746 --> 00:36:35.396 A:middle
are security scoped
URLs so you can say,

00:36:35.396 --> 00:36:39.876 A:middle
I want to play this song, use
the API to request access,

00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:42.016 A:middle
you'll get the URL,
you'll call startAccessing

00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:45.516 A:middle
SecurityScopedResource on it
and the file is made available

00:36:45.516 --> 00:36:47.126 A:middle
within your Sandbox
and you can behave

00:36:47.376 --> 00:36:49.326 A:middle
like you always have
towards that file,

00:36:49.326 --> 00:36:50.926 A:middle
regardless of where it
is on the file system.

00:36:51.266 --> 00:36:56.026 A:middle
To use the iTunes Library
framework from a Sandboxed app,

00:36:56.026 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
you need the normal music
entitlements that have been

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
around since App
Sandbox launched.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
around since App
Sandbox launched.

00:37:00.806 --> 00:37:01.986 A:middle
As I'm sure most of you know,

00:37:02.096 --> 00:37:03.786 A:middle
using App Sandbox
is now a requirement

00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:07.866 A:middle
in the Mac App Store.

00:37:08.486 --> 00:37:12.076 A:middle
And this has been, for the
most part, very smooth.

00:37:12.996 --> 00:37:15.626 A:middle
Most of our developers have had
no trouble adopting their apps

00:37:15.626 --> 00:37:20.396 A:middle
just like I've shown you with
very little time spent in Xcode

00:37:20.396 --> 00:37:22.736 A:middle
and just finding the right
entitlements to enable.

00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:25.826 A:middle
But, as we've been doing
this for some time now,

00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:29.116 A:middle
we've also picked up a bag
of tips and tricks for things

00:37:29.156 --> 00:37:31.076 A:middle
to check when you're
submitting your app especially

00:37:31.076 --> 00:37:32.046 A:middle
if it's for the first time.

00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:35.866 A:middle
And the first of those, and the
most important one I'm going

00:37:35.866 --> 00:37:40.436 A:middle
to point you to, is a document
called "Technical Q&amp;A QA1773."

00:37:41.196 --> 00:37:44.516 A:middle
So if you search for that,
you'll find the whole document

00:37:44.516 --> 00:37:49.336 A:middle
that actually lists a number of
sort of common issues and tips

00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:52.226 A:middle
and tricks for when
you're submitting your apps

00:37:52.616 --> 00:37:55.076 A:middle
to the Mac App Store and
need to enable Sandboxing.

00:37:55.676 --> 00:37:57.546 A:middle
But I'm just going to
point out a few of them

00:37:57.926 --> 00:38:00.596 A:middle
that I think are the most
common kinds of things

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.926 --> 00:38:00.596 A:middle
that I think are the most
common kinds of things

00:38:00.596 --> 00:38:01.506 A:middle
that you might run in to.

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:05.666 A:middle
So the first is this, when
you're submitting your app

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.866 A:middle
and you know it must
be Sanboxed,

00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:09.106 A:middle
that's not just your
main app binary,

00:38:09.106 --> 00:38:11.656 A:middle
it's actually every executable
file that you're submitting.

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.986 A:middle
Now most apps actually just
have their main binary,

00:38:14.986 --> 00:38:18.066 A:middle
their main executable, but if
you're including XPC services

00:38:18.066 --> 00:38:20.166 A:middle
or if you're including
helper tools that you run

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:23.606 A:middle
through things like NS Task, all
of those must also be Sandboxed.

00:38:24.066 --> 00:38:27.426 A:middle
The entitlements you choose must
match your app functionality.

00:38:27.986 --> 00:38:30.506 A:middle
Remember that there's a
human reviewer that's looking

00:38:30.506 --> 00:38:34.786 A:middle
at your app and if it's a
timer app that just, you know,

00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:37.076 A:middle
lets you set some
timers and then they fire

00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:40.606 A:middle
and some music plays and it's
requesting an entitlement

00:38:40.606 --> 00:38:44.296 A:middle
for access to the Address Book,
that reviewer is going to say,

00:38:44.296 --> 00:38:45.256 A:middle
well, what's going on here?

00:38:45.566 --> 00:38:48.116 A:middle
I see no way that this app needs
access to the Address Book,

00:38:48.466 --> 00:38:50.606 A:middle
why is the developer
requesting this entitlement?

00:38:50.836 --> 00:38:53.326 A:middle
So that can add time to the
review process and you'll have

00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:54.926 A:middle
to explain why you're
doing this.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.396 A:middle
In general, don't be tempted
to enable entitlements

00:38:58.396 --> 00:39:00.616 A:middle
that you don't need,
really only enable the ones

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.396 --> 00:39:00.616 A:middle
that you don't need,
really only enable the ones

00:39:00.616 --> 00:39:03.026 A:middle
that your app clearly
has need for.

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:06.406 A:middle
And, hand-in-hand with that,
I showed you the process

00:39:06.406 --> 00:39:07.796 A:middle
of looking for Sandbox
violations.

00:39:08.436 --> 00:39:10.956 A:middle
Now, not all Sandbox
violations are bad.

00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:13.996 A:middle
And what I mean by that is, if
there's no functional impact

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:16.106 A:middle
on your app whatsoever, if
you're seeing a violation,

00:39:17.056 --> 00:39:19.926 A:middle
everything in your app is
working fine, that's fine,

00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:21.116 A:middle
you don't have to do anything.

00:39:21.286 --> 00:39:23.606 A:middle
You don't have to go through the
list of entitlements trying to,

00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:26.806 A:middle
hoping that some random
unrelated entitlement will make

00:39:26.806 --> 00:39:28.156 A:middle
the Sandbox violation go away.

00:39:28.336 --> 00:39:31.006 A:middle
Because it might, but then,
when it comes time to submit

00:39:31.006 --> 00:39:33.646 A:middle
to the Mac App Store, it's
going to be a raising eyebrows,

00:39:33.646 --> 00:39:35.536 A:middle
why do you have this random,
unrelated entitlement?

00:39:36.396 --> 00:39:38.896 A:middle
Just the fact that there are
violations is not a problem.

00:39:39.186 --> 00:39:41.576 A:middle
It's only when the violations
are causing functionality

00:39:41.576 --> 00:39:44.526 A:middle
in your app that doesn't work,
that's where you go and you try

00:39:44.526 --> 00:39:46.816 A:middle
and figure out what entitlements
you might be missing.

00:39:47.226 --> 00:39:48.496 A:middle
And so, on a very similar note,

00:39:48.806 --> 00:39:50.416 A:middle
when you do request
entitlements,

00:39:50.466 --> 00:39:53.006 A:middle
try and make sure you
understand exactly what they do

00:39:53.066 --> 00:39:54.116 A:middle
and why you need them.

00:39:55.316 --> 00:39:58.546 A:middle
There are a few entitlements
that lots of you are requesting

00:39:59.376 --> 00:40:01.936 A:middle
that we can kind
of figure out why,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.376 --> 00:40:01.936 A:middle
that we can kind
of figure out why,

00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:05.656 A:middle
but it doesn't fully match the
model so here's an example.

00:40:06.266 --> 00:40:09.586 A:middle
If your app needs to be
able to open documents

00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:12.276 A:middle
from a USB stick the user
has plugged into the machine,

00:40:12.986 --> 00:40:14.576 A:middle
you don't need any
entitlements for that, right?

00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:16.126 A:middle
The Powerbox will just
let you browse there

00:40:16.126 --> 00:40:18.686 A:middle
like any other file
and that's it.

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.016 A:middle
No entitlements needed.

00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:22.126 A:middle
That would not be reason

00:40:22.126 --> 00:40:24.906 A:middle
to specify the USB
Device Access Entitlement

00:40:26.146 --> 00:40:27.986 A:middle
because that entitlement
actually lets you interface

00:40:27.986 --> 00:40:30.466 A:middle
with custom USB devices that may
be connected to the computer.

00:40:30.466 --> 00:40:32.696 A:middle
It has nothing to do with
file access and USB sticks.

00:40:33.336 --> 00:40:38.316 A:middle
Similarly, if your app does any
networking, it's really tempting

00:40:38.316 --> 00:40:40.806 A:middle
to just check both of the
network entitlement boxes.

00:40:40.806 --> 00:40:42.176 A:middle
The one that says,
Inbound Connections

00:40:42.176 --> 00:40:43.066 A:middle
and Outbound Connections.

00:40:43.516 --> 00:40:46.446 A:middle
But actually, the most, the
vast majority of apps only needs

00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:48.386 A:middle
to be able to make
outbound network requests,

00:40:49.186 --> 00:40:51.396 A:middle
meaning it only needs the
client network entitlement.

00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:54.776 A:middle
Most of apps are not sitting
and being network servers

00:40:54.776 --> 00:40:57.506 A:middle
where they bind the port and
wait for inbound connections.

00:40:57.766 --> 00:41:00.316 A:middle
That's not what most apps do so,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.766 --> 00:41:00.316 A:middle
That's not what most apps do so,

00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:03.506 A:middle
if you're selecting the
server networking entitlement,

00:41:03.506 --> 00:41:07.226 A:middle
make sure you actually need it
rather than just being something

00:41:07.226 --> 00:41:08.666 A:middle
that sort of seems
like you might need it.

00:41:08.836 --> 00:41:12.756 A:middle
Finally, we have this mechanism
we call Temporary Exceptions

00:41:13.506 --> 00:41:15.906 A:middle
which are a way to,
in certain cases,

00:41:16.246 --> 00:41:20.086 A:middle
where the Sandbox is
prohibiting functionality

00:41:20.086 --> 00:41:22.796 A:middle
for which we want the support,

00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:26.976 A:middle
but currently don't have a
good mechanism, there's a list

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:29.046 A:middle
of temporary exceptions that
you may be able to request

00:41:29.046 --> 00:41:31.246 A:middle
that would allow your
app to continue working

00:41:31.246 --> 00:41:32.816 A:middle
until a better mechanism
is available.

00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:36.666 A:middle
And there's a few things
I want to say about this.

00:41:36.666 --> 00:41:39.346 A:middle
The first is there's been some
trepidation about the name,

00:41:39.346 --> 00:41:40.986 A:middle
Temporary Exception,
because it sounds

00:41:40.986 --> 00:41:43.166 A:middle
like maybe it'll just stop
working all of a sudden.

00:41:43.496 --> 00:41:45.546 A:middle
And, if you've distributed
your app and a bunch

00:41:45.546 --> 00:41:49.346 A:middle
of users have bought
it, suddenly one day,

00:41:49.346 --> 00:41:50.896 A:middle
maybe it just won't run anymore

00:41:50.896 --> 00:41:52.666 A:middle
because the temporary
exception has expired.

00:41:53.536 --> 00:41:54.506 A:middle
That's not how it works.

00:41:54.686 --> 00:41:57.516 A:middle
The Temporary Exception,
if you are approved,

00:41:57.516 --> 00:41:59.236 A:middle
the Temporary Exception,
it'll continue working

00:41:59.486 --> 00:42:01.356 A:middle
and it's simply that, at
some point in the future,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.486 --> 00:42:01.356 A:middle
and it's simply that, at
some point in the future,

00:42:01.356 --> 00:42:04.926 A:middle
as a better mechanism becomes
available, you may be asked

00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:07.606 A:middle
to no longer submit
new versions of the app

00:42:07.656 --> 00:42:09.606 A:middle
to the App Store carrying
that temporary exception.

00:42:10.066 --> 00:42:12.126 A:middle
But, you don't have to
fear temporary exceptions.

00:42:12.616 --> 00:42:14.216 A:middle
Once you request them,
once they're approved,

00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:15.156 A:middle
they're going to keep working.

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:16.466 A:middle
There's no issue
about this breaking.

00:42:16.796 --> 00:42:18.566 A:middle
The second thing, and this
is a really important one,

00:42:18.566 --> 00:42:20.196 A:middle
is temporary exceptions
are not a way

00:42:20.196 --> 00:42:21.996 A:middle
to effectively disable
the Sandbox.

00:42:22.866 --> 00:42:24.346 A:middle
So we've seen some
very creative use

00:42:24.346 --> 00:42:28.196 A:middle
of temporary exceptions
including popular ones

00:42:28.196 --> 00:42:30.526 A:middle
like asking, you know,
for a temporary exception

00:42:30.526 --> 00:42:33.216 A:middle
to script Finder and Terminal
or for a temporary exception

00:42:33.216 --> 00:42:37.716 A:middle
that allows access to slash and
everything underneath which,

00:42:37.716 --> 00:42:38.986 A:middle
basically, means the
entire file system.

00:42:39.686 --> 00:42:42.916 A:middle
So remember, again, that when
you do this, it's going to go

00:42:42.916 --> 00:42:46.786 A:middle
in front of a human reviewer
and they're going to be unhappy.

00:42:47.246 --> 00:42:51.876 A:middle
So these are not a mechanism
to work around the Sandbox.

00:42:52.226 --> 00:42:54.196 A:middle
App Sandbox, ever
since we introduced it,

00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:55.966 A:middle
in Lion has been
a strong barrier

00:42:55.966 --> 00:42:57.686 A:middle
against exploitation and, even,

00:42:57.686 --> 00:42:59.036 A:middle
against pathological
coding errors.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.066 --> 00:43:02.746 A:middle
It tries to drive security
policy by user intent,

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:04.676 A:middle
instead of explicit security UI.

00:43:05.956 --> 00:43:07.726 A:middle
It's a technology for those
of you who are looking

00:43:07.726 --> 00:43:10.116 A:middle
at Gatekeeper and Developer
ID that's complementary

00:43:10.626 --> 00:43:14.466 A:middle
to Gatekeeper so you can, even
if you're distributing your apps

00:43:14.466 --> 00:43:18.366 A:middle
through Developer ID, you
can use App Sandbox with it.

00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:22.096 A:middle
We have some really great
documentation covering almost

00:43:22.096 --> 00:43:23.366 A:middle
everything that I
talked about today.

00:43:24.596 --> 00:43:27.186 A:middle
There's sample code where you
can look at things like XPC

00:43:27.186 --> 00:43:28.896 A:middle
and Sandboxing and XPC services.

00:43:29.566 --> 00:43:35.936 A:middle
But the real takeaway for me
is this, probably almost all

00:43:35.936 --> 00:43:40.766 A:middle
of you here are iOS users
and iOS, as we announced,

00:43:40.766 --> 00:43:43.076 A:middle
has asked 50 billion
app downloads.

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:45.736 A:middle
Every single one of those
has run in the Sandbox

00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:48.316 A:middle
and our users have loved

00:43:48.316 --> 00:43:51.206 A:middle
that the carefree experience
they have of trying new apps.

00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:53.776 A:middle
They never worry about what's
going to happen to their phone,

00:43:53.776 --> 00:43:55.866 A:middle
they never worry about, you
know, what if it crashes

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.076 A:middle
and deletes all my things.

00:43:57.526 --> 00:44:00.566 A:middle
Those are simply not in the
vocabulary of our iOS users

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.526 --> 00:44:00.566 A:middle
Those are simply not in the
vocabulary of our iOS users

00:44:00.566 --> 00:44:02.096 A:middle
because the Sandbox,
from day one,

00:44:02.586 --> 00:44:04.826 A:middle
has imposed strong restrictions
on what apps can do.

00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:07.576 A:middle
And we would like to
delight our users on OS X

00:44:07.576 --> 00:44:09.566 A:middle
with the same carefree
app experience.

00:44:10.496 --> 00:44:12.806 A:middle
Thank you.
