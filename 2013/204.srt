[ Silence ]

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.016 A:middle
My name is David Chan.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.476 A:middle
Today, we're going to talk
a bit about multitasking.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.186 A:middle
As you saw yesterday, we
have some great new APIs

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.076 A:middle
for you today, and we're
going to just dive right in.

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:27.426 A:middle
So first, we want to just do a
quick review of the multitasking

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.236 A:middle
that we have in iOS 6.

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.336 A:middle
We have a few changes here that
we want to just to note right

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.946 A:middle
at the top and then
we're going to dive right

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:37.246 A:middle
into the new APIs
that we have for you.

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:40.206 A:middle
We're really excited to see
what you guys think about it

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.996 A:middle
and what you'll do inside
of your applications.

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:46.646 A:middle
And then next, we're
going to talk a little bit

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.576 A:middle
about what it means to
run in the background.

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:51.726 A:middle
For those of you who
haven't adapted any

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:57.286 A:middle
of the more significant
multitasking APIs in the past,

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.216 A:middle
these are a few tips and things
that you should be considering

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.216 A:middle
these are a few tips and things
that you should be considering

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:02.786 A:middle
as you're implementing it.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.606 A:middle
Details are incredibly important
to make a great application

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.886 A:middle
and this is where
you're going to learn

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:12.406 A:middle
about what you need
to do for those.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:18.176 A:middle
So, in iOS 6, we have a
number of great APIs for you

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:21.906 A:middle
to for example playing
audio into the background

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:26.116 A:middle
if you're listening to music,
for your application to be woken

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:30.096 A:middle
up and notified when the user
changes location, if they enter

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.156 A:middle
in a region that
they're interested in.

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.876 A:middle
And of course, in iOS 5,
we introduced Newsstand

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.986 A:middle
which allows newspaper
and magazine applications

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:43.616 A:middle
to keep their content
up to date.

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:46.646 A:middle
So, here are a few changes
that we've made to some

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:48.986 A:middle
of the existing multitasking
APIs.

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:54.686 A:middle
The UI application background
task API is really great.

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:58.296 A:middle
It's certainly very useful
to continue operation

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
after users have left
your application.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
after users have left
your application.

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:03.876 A:middle
And a number of applications
use this for encoding video

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:07.476 A:middle
or transferring files,
uploading or downloading

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.376 A:middle
and completing database
operations

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.206 A:middle
or just generally finishing up
whatever the user was doing.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:19.636 A:middle
And so from a power standpoint,
it kind of looked like this.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:22.296 A:middle
When the application
enters the background,

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:26.526 A:middle
obviously the phone stays awake
to keep that task running,

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:29.876 A:middle
even when the user
locks her phone.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:32.526 A:middle
So, when you lock your phone
and you put it in your pocket,

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.816 A:middle
you kind of expect
it to go to sleep.

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:38.896 A:middle
But in iOS 6, that background
task would keep the phone awake

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:42.466 A:middle
and then it would only go to
sleep after that task has ended.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.506 A:middle
In iOS 7, we've changed
this slightly

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:49.096 A:middle
to improve battery life.

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:53.296 A:middle
So, we have where the
application enters the

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:56.316 A:middle
background, where it locks and
you'll see that the phone goes

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.626 A:middle
to sleep shortly afterwards.

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:02.416 A:middle
And that anytime that the
device is awake to, for example,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:02.416 A:middle
And that anytime that the
device is awake to, for example,

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:07.196 A:middle
check mail, your application
will get a chance to run

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:11.466 A:middle
at that point too, so you get
these opportunistic slices

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:12.926 A:middle
of time to run.

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:15.426 A:middle
And you'll see that you still
get about the same amount

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.026 A:middle
of time to run your task.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:19.556 A:middle
It's just split up
over that period.

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:26.456 A:middle
So, if you're an application
that uses the background tasks

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:30.076 A:middle
to transfer files, in iOS 7,
we're going to encourage you

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:34.246 A:middle
to use the NSURLSession API
and we're going to discuss what

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.726 A:middle
that looks like and how to
use that in a little bit.

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:40.056 A:middle
And of course, if you're
going to support iOS 6 as well

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.496 A:middle
as iOS 7, all we ask is
that you check to see

00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:47.136 A:middle
if that class exists and use
the new enqueuing behavior

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:48.556 A:middle
but of course, continuing

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:51.836 A:middle
to use your old stuff
for iOS 6 as well.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:54.376 A:middle
So, just to summarize,

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.936 A:middle
applications will no
longer keep the device awake

00:03:58.286 --> 00:03:59.516 A:middle
when you're running these tasks.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:03.136 A:middle
You'll still get several minutes
of runtime just as before,

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:05.266 A:middle
it's just not guaranteed
to be contiguous.

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:10.726 A:middle
So, next stop is
the App Switcher.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.446 A:middle
So, I hope you guys
noticed yesterday,

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:15.646 A:middle
we have a great new
App Switcher.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:20.036 A:middle
It prominently features
snapshots, so users can go

00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:23.196 A:middle
through and find what they're
looking for just by recognition.

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:27.056 A:middle
So, the really important
thing to note about this is

00:04:27.106 --> 00:04:29.206 A:middle
that your snapshots
that got taken

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:30.486 A:middle
after your application goes

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:35.316 A:middle
into the background is even
more important, and it's really,

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.236 A:middle
really important now that
you go back to the same place

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.436 A:middle
that the user was
at when they left.

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:45.146 A:middle
And if you haven't seen it
before, I encourage you to go

00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:48.536 A:middle
to the State Restoration talk
that will be on Thursday.

00:04:48.536 --> 00:04:50.886 A:middle
And you'll be able to see how

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:52.636 A:middle
to use State Restoration
to do that.

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:53.816 A:middle
It's a really simple API.

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:55.046 A:middle
It's very powerful.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:57.726 A:middle
You'll be able to use that
to make sure that when

00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:01.056 A:middle
that user taps that snapshot and
it flies in, it goes right back

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:01.056 A:middle
that user taps that snapshot and
it flies in, it goes right back

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:02.506 A:middle
into the same place
that they left it.

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:08.586 A:middle
Also, users will be able to
swipe up to remove applications,

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:13.786 A:middle
and so just as before in iOS 6,
that will stop the application

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:16.836 A:middle
from running but now in
iOS 7, it will also stop

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:18.436 A:middle
that application from
running in the background.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.156 A:middle
And we've made this consistent
across a number of APIs,

00:05:21.156 --> 00:05:24.496 A:middle
but you guys should be
aware that that is what's--

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:31.436 A:middle
that will be what's happening
when the application is removed.

00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:34.106 A:middle
So, we applied these to
location services as well,

00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:36.156 A:middle
so with respect to the
App Switcher state,

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.246 A:middle
so your application
for region monitoring

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:42.196 A:middle
or significant location changes
won't launch in the background

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:43.606 A:middle
if the users remove
that application.

00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:47.236 A:middle
In addition, users will be
able to configure whether

00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:48.796 A:middle
or not they want that
application to run

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:52.856 A:middle
in the background with the new
Background App Refresh Settings

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:53.976 A:middle
under General.

00:05:57.536 --> 00:05:58.136 A:middle
Newsstand.

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:01.246 A:middle
So quick note about
Newsstand, we've only updated it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:01.246 A:middle
So quick note about
Newsstand, we've only updated it

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:03.286 A:middle
to support these two things,

00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:04.736 A:middle
Settings as well as
the App Switcher.

00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:09.236 A:middle
You'll see a lot of really great
APIs here that might be tempting

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.506 A:middle
to use if you're a
Newsstand developer.

00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:16.186 A:middle
Suffice it to say, we
encourage you to stick

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:19.956 A:middle
with the Newsstand API for your
Newsstand behavior and that

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.846 A:middle
for new features,
you'll certainly want

00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:23.066 A:middle
to consider using our new stuff.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:29.786 A:middle
OK, so with that, let's dive in.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:34.006 A:middle
First, multitasking API
is background app fetch.

00:06:35.276 --> 00:06:39.306 A:middle
And what this is, is
it's a periodic way

00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:42.226 A:middle
for your application to get
launched into the background

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:45.316 A:middle
to update its content.

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:49.626 A:middle
It's based on when the user
actually users your application

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:55.566 A:middle
so that your fetch opportunities
can be as fresh as possible.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.626 A:middle
And we'll go into a little bit
about what that means and how

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.026 A:middle
that works so that you guys
can get an understanding of how

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.026 A:middle
that works so that you guys
can get an understanding of how

00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:01.896 A:middle
to build your features.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.846 A:middle
Next stop is notifications.

00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:08.576 A:middle
This is really a great API.

00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:12.256 A:middle
We've had lots of
request for this

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:13.926 A:middle
and I think you guys
are going to love this.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:18.166 A:middle
This basically just gives
your application a chance

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:21.336 A:middle
to launch whenever you send
it a push notification crafted

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:24.786 A:middle
in a certain way,
it can actually wake

00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:26.636 A:middle
up your application
in the background

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:28.196 A:middle
with a silent push notification.

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.896 A:middle
So that if there's
something immediate that needs

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:32.966 A:middle
to happen inside of the
application but doesn't need

00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:35.466 A:middle
to bother the user,
you can do that too.

00:07:35.466 --> 00:07:37.236 A:middle
It's really great.

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:40.496 A:middle
And lastly is a Background
Transfer Service,

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.736 A:middle
so this will allow you
to enqueue large uploads

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:48.056 A:middle
and downloads for iOS to
continue in the background

00:07:48.106 --> 00:07:51.776 A:middle
after the user leaves your
application and can continue

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:54.566 A:middle
across reboots and just
handles all of that for you.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:55.226 A:middle
It's really great.

00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:58.246 A:middle
So with that, let's
start talking

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
about background app refresh.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
about background app refresh.

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:03.606 A:middle
So, let's say you've got
the next great social

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:04.636 A:middle
networking application.

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:09.886 A:middle
Now, this might sound
typical to all of you,

00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:11.096 A:middle
or familiar to all of you.

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:13.076 A:middle
When your app becomes
front most,

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.826 A:middle
you typically refresh
your feed right then,

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:16.776 A:middle
which means that
for a few seconds,

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.446 A:middle
your users are stuck looking

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:21.896 A:middle
at what they saw last
time and not what's new.

00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:24.006 A:middle
And obviously, they've
gone to your application

00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:26.536 A:middle
to see what's going
on with your--

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:29.706 A:middle
you know, with their
friends and family.

00:08:31.426 --> 00:08:37.145 A:middle
So, now in iOS 7, you can update
your content before the user

00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:38.265 A:middle
returns to your application.

00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:41.645 A:middle
So, just like you resume
mail and has new mail there,

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.376 A:middle
then you can get that
same experience in iOS 7.

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:48.496 A:middle
So, that new interesting
content is just waiting there

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:51.986 A:middle
for the users to go and see.

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:55.406 A:middle
So, let's dig into the API.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
It's really simple, but it's a
common pattern that we're going

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.086 A:middle
to use throughout the top.

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:01.956 A:middle
So, I want you to pay
attention to how this works.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:01.956 A:middle
So, I want you to pay
attention to how this works.

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:07.036 A:middle
The first thing you do is
either in the Info.plist

00:09:07.036 --> 00:09:10.616 A:middle
or in the new Xcode feature
capability's PNG, you're going

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:13.906 A:middle
to enable Background
Fetch by adding this key

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:16.096 A:middle
to UI background modes.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:20.336 A:middle
The second thing you do is you
set this Minimum Background

00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:23.366 A:middle
Fetch interval and that
will allow your application

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:25.186 A:middle
to enable these fetches
to start with.

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
And we'll go over what
these values are and what

00:09:29.616 --> 00:09:33.466 A:middle
that actually means in
practice in just a moment.

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:36.266 A:middle
Finally, once your
application does get launched

00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:39.286 A:middle
in the background, it'll go
through this typical pattern

00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:42.426 A:middle
where it did finish launching,
gets called, and then obviously

00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:44.076 A:middle
if your application
was already running

00:09:44.076 --> 00:09:45.776 A:middle
and it was simply
suspended in the background,

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.586 A:middle
your application will be
resumed and perform fetch

00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:51.236 A:middle
with completion handle
will be called.

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:52.896 A:middle
So, this is our new
delegate callback

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:54.086 A:middle
in UI application delegate.

00:09:54.806 --> 00:09:57.396 A:middle
All you do is you implement
that, you get passed

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:00.846 A:middle
in a completion handler
and from that point on,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:00.846 A:middle
in a completion handler
and from that point on,

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.986 A:middle
you're allowed a certain
amount of time in order

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:06.156 A:middle
to kick off any network
request you need to do

00:10:06.476 --> 00:10:10.826 A:middle
to retrieve new content
and update your UI.

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:14.246 A:middle
And then after you've done
all of that and you've gotten

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:16.086 A:middle
that brand new stuff,
you're going

00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:17.746 A:middle
to call the completion
handler that was called--

00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:20.176 A:middle
that was passed in and
that's really important.

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
That's where your snapshot
gets taken and will go right

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:28.716 A:middle
into that app switcher UI, so
that if the user is passing

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
by your application-- the app
switcher, they can see, "Hey,

00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:32.246 A:middle
look, there's brand
new content there.

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.046 A:middle
That's a cool new picture,
I want to see that."

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:38.176 A:middle
In addition, it also saves
the state restoration archive

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.876 A:middle
so that, of course, when you
tap that, the user goes right

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:43.206 A:middle
into your application even

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:48.916 A:middle
if it may have exited
in the background.

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:51.056 A:middle
So, let's talk about the
minimum fetch interval.

00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:54.866 A:middle
So with that same social
networking app, right,

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:57.826 A:middle
it's like any other application,
you have a user account

00:10:57.826 --> 00:10:58.736 A:middle
that you have to log in with.

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:02.886 A:middle
And so when the user first
installs it, it starts signed

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:02.886 A:middle
And so when the user first
installs it, it starts signed

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:05.226 A:middle
out which means that
there's no content available.

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:09.746 A:middle
And so the default value of the
minimum fetch interval is never.

00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:13.246 A:middle
Once the user signs in, however,

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.476 A:middle
the content will
then be available.

00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:20.186 A:middle
So you can set that
fetch interval to minimum

00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:24.206 A:middle
and that means that the system
will use a reasonable default

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:28.466 A:middle
in order to find out when your
application should be launched

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:28.886 A:middle
to update.

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:31.676 A:middle
And of course, the cycle
completes, if the user happens

00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:33.796 A:middle
to log out, you want to
set that back to never.

00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:38.036 A:middle
So never and minimum are two
of the values that you can use,

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:41.056 A:middle
but of course you can set
a custom value expressed

00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:41.946 A:middle
in seconds.

00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:45.996 A:middle
So let's take a look
at what that actually--

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:47.466 A:middle
how that actually works.

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:50.286 A:middle
So let's say that I-- app
icon there represents some app

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:52.646 A:middle
activity like the user
using your application

00:11:53.136 --> 00:11:54.456 A:middle
or a previous fetch.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:58.466 A:middle
For a limited amount
of time afterwards,

00:11:58.566 --> 00:11:59.646 A:middle
fetching will be disabled.

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:02.966 A:middle
So if you set this to let's
say an hour, for the next hour,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:02.966 A:middle
So if you set this to let's
say an hour, for the next hour,

00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:05.356 A:middle
the system will not
wake up your application

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:06.386 A:middle
in order to go and fetch.

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.536 A:middle
But that for any
time after that,

00:12:10.046 --> 00:12:11.566 A:middle
fetching will be
allowed at any time.

00:12:11.956 --> 00:12:14.836 A:middle
So if you zoom out a little
bit, what that looks like is

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:16.416 A:middle
that there's no repeating
interval.

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:18.156 A:middle
It just means that
there's a period of time

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:21.876 A:middle
after your app launches where
the system won't wake it up.

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:24.756 A:middle
Now, you might ask, "Why
would you want to do that?

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:27.766 A:middle
Of course, I want to be
updated all the time."

00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:30.066 A:middle
So I'll give you an example.

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:33.426 A:middle
Let's say you have an
application that reads data

00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:35.236 A:middle
from a number of
personal weather stations

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:37.076 A:middle
and that's really
expensive to do,

00:12:37.076 --> 00:12:39.296 A:middle
so you only do it once an hour.

00:12:39.556 --> 00:12:43.916 A:middle
You know ahead of time that
your content only updates once

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:44.276 A:middle
an hour.

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:46.856 A:middle
So if you were being woken up
let's say every 15 minutes,

00:12:47.206 --> 00:12:49.956 A:middle
that would be a waste of
the user's battery life

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:52.196 A:middle
and it would be a waste
of your server resources.

00:12:52.616 --> 00:12:54.146 A:middle
So you can set this
value to that.

00:12:54.576 --> 00:12:56.256 A:middle
But if you don't have
constraints like that,

00:12:56.356 --> 00:12:58.846 A:middle
we highly encourage you to
use the default minimum.

00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
We think that will give you
a really great experience

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
We think that will give you
a really great experience

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:04.316 A:middle
and give your users
the right thing.

00:13:04.516 --> 00:13:08.336 A:middle
So, with that I'd like to invite
up on stage Brittany Hughes

00:13:08.336 --> 00:13:11.166 A:middle
from the SpringBoard team
and she'll show us how

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:14.726 A:middle
to update your application
with these APIs

00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:16.816 A:middle
and how easy it is
to do an Xcode.

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:22.996 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:25.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Brittany
and I'm going to show you how

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.506 A:middle
to update your app to fetch
new content in the background.

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:32.316 A:middle
OK, I think I have the next
great social networking app.

00:13:32.596 --> 00:13:35.896 A:middle
I've been working on an app that
is a social network for clowns

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:37.456 A:middle
and clown enthusiasts.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.566 A:middle
I call it Clowntown.

00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:41.076 A:middle
So, let's start by giving
you a little tour of my app.

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:46.666 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:48.606 A:middle
OK, here we go.

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:50.946 A:middle
You can see it's
a very simple app.

00:13:50.946 --> 00:13:53.956 A:middle
It just has a lot of posts
from my clown friends.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:56.876 A:middle
I can pull the refresh
to get new posts

00:13:57.926 --> 00:13:59.936 A:middle
and when I just pulled
the refresh,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.606 A:middle
we just got two new posts.

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:04.426 A:middle
They're marked in blue and
if you look really closely

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
down here on the corner of
a post, there's a timestamp.

00:14:07.466 --> 00:14:09.726 A:middle
That means these posts
were downloaded at 2:20.

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:14.306 A:middle
So unfortunately for my
users, the only way for them

00:14:14.306 --> 00:14:16.426 A:middle
to see new posts from
their clown friends is

00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:17.196 A:middle
to pull the refresh.

00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:21.016 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if my
app was already up to date

00:14:21.016 --> 00:14:21.906 A:middle
when the user launched it?

00:14:22.916 --> 00:14:24.766 A:middle
Well now in iOS 7,
we can do that.

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:25.446 A:middle
Let me show you how.

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:29.516 A:middle
The first thing we
need to do is we need

00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:31.026 A:middle
to add the new UI
background mode.

00:14:31.856 --> 00:14:33.616 A:middle
Xcode 5 has made it much easier

00:14:33.616 --> 00:14:35.316 A:middle
to manage your UI
background modes.

00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:38.306 A:middle
All you have to do is
click on your project

00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:39.886 A:middle
over here on the left.

00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:42.076 A:middle
And then on the Capabilities
tab,

00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:44.836 A:middle
down here there's a
background mode section.

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:48.616 A:middle
If I zoom in here, you
can see here is the list

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:53.746 A:middle
of background modes, so I'm just
going to check Background Fetch

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:58.156 A:middle
and now it's added to my apps
Info.plist The next thing I need

00:14:58.156 --> 00:15:01.326 A:middle
to do is I need to set my
apps minimum fetch interval.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.156 --> 00:15:01.326 A:middle
to do is I need to set my
apps minimum fetch interval.

00:15:02.056 --> 00:15:05.426 A:middle
This is super important because
the default interval is never,

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:07.746 A:middle
that means my app will
never be given a chance

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:08.706 A:middle
to run in the background.

00:15:09.336 --> 00:15:14.866 A:middle
I'm going to set my apps
minimum fetch interval

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:18.036 A:middle
to the minimum interval which
means that iOS will decide

00:15:18.036 --> 00:15:19.936 A:middle
when it's best for my app
to run in the background.

00:15:20.356 --> 00:15:24.406 A:middle
The next thing I
need to do is I need

00:15:24.406 --> 00:15:26.836 A:middle
to implement the new UI
application delegate callback.

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:30.756 A:middle
Application performs fetch
with completion handler.

00:15:31.886 --> 00:15:34.596 A:middle
In this method, I need
to go fetch my new posts.

00:15:35.396 --> 00:15:38.556 A:middle
I need to update my apps
UI to show the new posts,

00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:41.536 A:middle
and then I need to call the
completion handler to signal

00:15:41.536 --> 00:15:43.626 A:middle
to iOS that I'm finished
with my refresh.

00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:46.516 A:middle
Let's go check out
my View Controller

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:48.466 A:middle
to see what options I have.

00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:54.176 A:middle
OK, it looks like I have
conveniently refreshed

00:15:54.176 --> 00:15:55.126 A:middle
with completion handler.

00:15:56.076 --> 00:15:56.656 A:middle
Let's use that.

00:15:58.246 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
It looks like this
method takes in a block

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.246 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
It looks like this
method takes in a block

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:01.606 A:middle
than when the refresh
is finished,

00:16:01.886 --> 00:16:03.596 A:middle
will give me back a bool whether

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:07.326 A:middle
or not we downloaded new
post in that refresh.

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:08.596 A:middle
Let's add that over here

00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:11.346 A:middle
in my UI application
delegate callback.

00:16:13.326 --> 00:16:17.576 A:middle
Now inside this block,
what I need to do is I need

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:20.236 A:middle
to call the UI application
delegates completion handler.

00:16:21.006 --> 00:16:23.916 A:middle
The UI application delegates
completion handler can take a

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.116 A:middle
couple of different arguments.

00:16:25.756 --> 00:16:28.926 A:middle
So, if we did receive
new posts, then I'm going

00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:30.246 A:middle
to call the completion handler

00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:32.566 A:middle
with UI Background
Fetch result new data.

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:35.956 A:middle
If there weren't any new
posts, then I'm going

00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:37.116 A:middle
to call the completion handler

00:16:37.116 --> 00:16:39.136 A:middle
with UI Background
Fetch result no data.

00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:43.736 A:middle
OK, let's go check out
and see what refresh

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:45.476 A:middle
with completion handler
actually does.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.186 A:middle
OK, it looks like it takes
that completion handler

00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:54.626 A:middle
and assigns it to a property.

00:16:55.476 --> 00:16:57.476 A:middle
This was probably
a good idea before

00:16:57.476 --> 00:17:00.066 A:middle
when there was only one
code path that was coming

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.476 --> 00:17:00.066 A:middle
when there was only one
code path that was coming

00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:01.406 A:middle
through here, but now
that we just added

00:17:01.406 --> 00:17:03.766 A:middle
that second code path, it's
not a great idea anymore.

00:17:04.486 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
The reason why this isn't a good
idea is because it's possible

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:09.665 A:middle
for us to come through
this method one time

00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:12.596 A:middle
with a completion handler,
stash it away in our property

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:16.046 A:middle
and then before that refresh
is finished, we'll come in here

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:17.435 A:middle
with a different
completion handler,

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:20.675 A:middle
assign it to the property which
will overwrite the first one.

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:23.146 A:middle
That means the first completion
handler will never get called.

00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:25.915 A:middle
One of the most important things

00:17:25.986 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
about the UI application
delegate callback is

00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:29.746 A:middle
that we call the
completion handler.

00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:33.136 A:middle
Like I said a minute ago,
that's the signal to the system

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.346 A:middle
that we're done with everything,
we're ready to be snapshotted.

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:38.886 A:middle
If I don't call the completion
handler, bad things will happen.

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:43.536 A:middle
So, instead of signing it to
a property, let's just get rid

00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:46.696 A:middle
of that and let's pass the
completion handler all the way

00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:47.586 A:middle
through the refresh.

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:49.996 A:middle
So I'm going to delete that
line, I'm going to get rid

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:55.066 A:middle
of my property and then
I'll just change this method

00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:57.796 A:middle
to fetch new posts with
completion handler.

00:17:58.396 --> 00:18:03.346 A:middle
And then that means I need
to update the signature

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.396 --> 00:18:03.346 A:middle
And then that means I need
to update the signature

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:07.036 A:middle
to fetch new posts with
completion handler.

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:09.376 A:middle
And then inside this method,

00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:12.536 A:middle
it's look like we were
referencing the completion

00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.466 A:middle
handler property that
we just get rid of.

00:18:14.926 --> 00:18:18.506 A:middle
So instead, let's just reference
the completion handler argument.

00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:26.856 A:middle
OK, looks like everything's
going good so far.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.896 A:middle
Let me run my app and make
sure I didn't break anything.

00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:35.426 A:middle
OK, here we are,
looks good so far.

00:18:36.046 --> 00:18:38.166 A:middle
If I pull the refresh,
all right,

00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:41.976 A:middle
we've got three new posts,
they're marked in blue

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:47.946 A:middle
and their timestamp is 2:24
p.m. Now, I need to test

00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:50.716 A:middle
that my app can actually fetch
new content in the background.

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:54.066 A:middle
There are two very important
scenarios you need to test here.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.776 A:middle
The first scenario is
having your app launched

00:18:56.966 --> 00:18:58.556 A:middle
in the background to
fetch new content.

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:01.456 A:middle
The second scenario is
having your app resumed

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:01.456 A:middle
The second scenario is
having your app resumed

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:02.956 A:middle
in the background to
fetch new content.

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:05.316 A:middle
Let's test the resume
case first.

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:10.416 A:middle
I recommend testing the resume
case by creating a new scheme.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.676 A:middle
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to come up here

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:15.186 A:middle
to my scheme list and I'm
going to hit Manage Schemes.

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:18.336 A:middle
And I just have one the default,

00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:22.026 A:middle
so I'm just going
to duplicate that.

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:27.006 A:middle
Let's call it Clowntown
Background Fetch with an R.

00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:33.806 A:middle
And if I zoom in here, in
the Run section of the scheme

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.336 A:middle
under the Options tab,
there's a checkbox down here

00:19:36.336 --> 00:19:38.316 A:middle
that is Launch Due to a
Background Fetch Event.

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:39.446 A:middle
So I'm just going to check that,

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:44.836 A:middle
and zoom out and
then hit OK, OK.

00:19:45.396 --> 00:19:48.866 A:middle
Going to sneakily
clear this, OK.

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.066 A:middle
And now I'm going to run my app.

00:19:53.116 --> 00:19:55.526 A:middle
What you'll notice here is
that the simulator launched

00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:57.776 A:middle
and my app is running but
it's not in the foreground.

00:19:58.296 --> 00:19:59.436 A:middle
That's because it was launched

00:19:59.436 --> 00:20:01.556 A:middle
into the background
to fetch new content.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.436 --> 00:20:01.556 A:middle
into the background
to fetch new content.

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:04.636 A:middle
If I look down here in
the Syslog for my app,

00:20:05.136 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
it says that we fetched one new
post and then saved a snapshot.

00:20:09.946 --> 00:20:12.446 A:middle
Let's resume my app and
see what it looks like.

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:16.576 A:middle
OK great, we have our one
new post, it's marked in blue

00:20:16.576 --> 00:20:18.836 A:middle
and the timestamp is 2:26 p.m.

00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:20.746 A:middle
That was just a couple
of seconds ago.

00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:22.356 A:middle
So the launch case worked.

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:26.046 A:middle
Now we need to test
the resume case.

00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:34.726 A:middle
Xcode 5 has added
a new menu item

00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:37.546 A:middle
in the Debug menu called
Simulate Background Fetch

00:20:38.146 --> 00:20:39.296 A:middle
that will test the resume case.

00:20:39.296 --> 00:20:43.326 A:middle
So I'm just going to click that
and if I come back over here

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.216 A:middle
at the simulator, it's
still running my apps not

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:47.916 A:middle
in the foreground because it
was resumed in the background.

00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:50.306 A:middle
And if I check down
here on the Syslog,

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:53.036 A:middle
it looks like we
fetched another new post

00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:54.416 A:middle
and saved another snapshot.

00:20:55.786 --> 00:21:00.016 A:middle
So let me resume my app and
see what it looks like now.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:55.786 --> 00:21:00.016 A:middle
So let me resume my app and
see what it looks like now.

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.346 A:middle
OK great, we have one
new post from Mr. Happy,

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:06.576 A:middle
it's the blue post and
its timestamp is 2:26:52

00:21:06.576 --> 00:21:08.986 A:middle
which is just a couple
of seconds ago.

00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:13.186 A:middle
So we just verified that my app
could be launched and resumed

00:21:13.186 --> 00:21:14.686 A:middle
in the background to
fetch new content.

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:17.356 A:middle
And now it's possible for
my app to be up to date

00:21:17.356 --> 00:21:19.146 A:middle
when the user launches my app.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.576 A:middle
You've seen how easy it
is to update your app

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:23.456 A:middle
to fetch new content
in the background.

00:21:23.646 --> 00:21:24.366 A:middle
It's not that hard.

00:21:25.276 --> 00:21:25.886 A:middle
Back to you Dave.

00:21:27.516 --> 00:21:33.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Brittany.

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.766 A:middle
So what did we learn?

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:39.946 A:middle
It's really, really easy

00:21:40.056 --> 00:21:41.976 A:middle
to update your application
with the new APIs.

00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:45.096 A:middle
We've made it intentionally
very simple.

00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:47.716 A:middle
We think that it should be
really easy for you guys

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:48.846 A:middle
to get started even today.

00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:53.006 A:middle
But two main points that
Brittany made, make sure to pass

00:21:53.006 --> 00:21:56.066 A:middle
that completion handler
all the way through so

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.946 A:middle
that every perform
fetch is bookended

00:21:58.946 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
with calling the
completion handler

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.946 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
with calling the
completion handler

00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:03.656 A:middle
and calling the completion
handler with the proper status

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.236 A:middle
of whether or not there's
new data, there's no data

00:22:06.636 --> 00:22:08.336 A:middle
or failed will give you--

00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:11.676 A:middle
will give us the
system more information

00:22:11.736 --> 00:22:15.436 A:middle
about how your application
is working.

00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:20.046 A:middle
So next, I wanted to pull
the curtain back a little bit

00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:24.996 A:middle
so that you guys can get a sense
of how Background Fetch works

00:22:24.996 --> 00:22:28.836 A:middle
under the-- behind
the curtains so that--

00:22:29.066 --> 00:22:31.686 A:middle
so that you can design your
features in the right way.

00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:34.716 A:middle
So the first thing that
you need to know is

00:22:34.776 --> 00:22:39.096 A:middle
that this system iOS
schedules these fetches.

00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:41.626 A:middle
It's important that
the system do this

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.946 A:middle
so that these opportunities
can be coalesced

00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:45.036 A:middle
across applications.

00:22:45.366 --> 00:22:48.186 A:middle
That means that multiple
applications get an opportunity

00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:52.456 A:middle
fetch at the same time so
that we can optimize power,

00:22:52.906 --> 00:22:53.996 A:middle
that's really important.

00:22:54.346 --> 00:22:57.476 A:middle
You know, these phones
have great batteries

00:22:57.886 --> 00:23:00.796 A:middle
but you do too many of these
things at the same time and--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.886 --> 00:23:00.796 A:middle
but you do too many of these
things at the same time and--

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:03.256 A:middle
or you do too many of these
things over the course

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:06.586 A:middle
of the day and that can
really wear it down.

00:23:07.016 --> 00:23:09.816 A:middle
The second thing to note
is that the system looks

00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:14.486 A:middle
at how users actually use their
device on the device in order

00:23:14.486 --> 00:23:17.566 A:middle
to see when they're
typically using it.

00:23:17.986 --> 00:23:20.556 A:middle
So that means it does a bit of
prediction in order to figure

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:22.776 A:middle
out what the right
time to use that--

00:23:23.216 --> 00:23:24.866 A:middle
what the right time to
update that application.

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:28.776 A:middle
The other thing that it
does is it's sensitive

00:23:28.806 --> 00:23:30.066 A:middle
to energy in daily users.

00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:33.656 A:middle
That means that it can look
at how much data is being used

00:23:33.656 --> 00:23:35.926 A:middle
and how much energy
is being used in order

00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:37.426 A:middle
to manage these fetches
correctly

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:41.446 A:middle
so that we don't have users
with poor battery life

00:23:41.446 --> 00:23:46.816 A:middle
and excessive data plans.

00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:50.496 A:middle
And as we've mentioned before,
this is completely indifferent

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:51.916 A:middle
to your actual app
running state.

00:23:51.916 --> 00:23:54.366 A:middle
If you happen to be
running, you'll get resumed.

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:58.666 A:middle
If your application is no longer
running, you'll get launched.

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:02.376 A:middle
So let me give you a
small example about--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:02.376 A:middle
So let me give you a
small example about--

00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:06.576 A:middle
of what I mean by-- when I
say adapts to user activity.

00:24:09.256 --> 00:24:12.726 A:middle
So let's say the user
uses their device

00:24:12.726 --> 00:24:15.576 A:middle
in this particular pattern
on the first day and uses it

00:24:15.576 --> 00:24:19.026 A:middle
in a slightly different way
on the second day and so on.

00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:24.366 A:middle
The device can observe this
pattern so it can really figure

00:24:24.366 --> 00:24:27.786 A:middle
out that yes, the user uses
this INN app in the morning.

00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:29.876 A:middle
And they use it around
lunch time

00:24:30.476 --> 00:24:31.666 A:middle
and then they use
it in the evening.

00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:33.906 A:middle
And that's a really
simple thing to observe

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:36.816 A:middle
because then it allows us to
actually make this prediction

00:24:36.816 --> 00:24:38.196 A:middle
about when those apps get used.

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:42.906 A:middle
And the best time to update
an application's info is just

00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:44.656 A:middle
before the user launches it.

00:24:45.506 --> 00:24:48.746 A:middle
So that the data is as
fresh and up to date

00:24:48.746 --> 00:24:50.856 A:middle
as possible before
they get into it.

00:24:51.906 --> 00:24:56.656 A:middle
So it allows us to
make this prediction.

00:24:56.706 --> 00:24:58.736 A:middle
So three main points
that you should remember.

00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:02.486 A:middle
It learns these patterns
based on actual device usage.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:02.486 A:middle
It learns these patterns
based on actual device usage.

00:25:03.516 --> 00:25:07.306 A:middle
It coalesces, fetches across the
applications at the same time.

00:25:08.066 --> 00:25:11.366 A:middle
And this system allows us

00:25:11.366 --> 00:25:14.336 A:middle
to avoid frequent fetching
during periods of inactivity.

00:25:14.726 --> 00:25:17.816 A:middle
So of course, it would be
inefficient both for the device,

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:21.926 A:middle
as well as your servers, if
we have the system fetching,

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.616 A:middle
you know, every 15 minutes
or in the middle of the night

00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:28.426 A:middle
when the user is asleep.

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:30.726 A:middle
So that's Background Fetch.

00:25:31.336 --> 00:25:33.916 A:middle
Now, we think this is going
to be incredibly useful

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
for many different
kinds of applications,

00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:39.256 A:middle
we thought about
social networking feeds,

00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:43.616 A:middle
news and entertainment
applications, blog aggregators,

00:25:43.996 --> 00:25:45.596 A:middle
weather apps, finance apps.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:48.556 A:middle
And we think that you can use
this in conjunction with one

00:25:48.556 --> 00:25:50.736 A:middle
of the other APIs that we're
going to be talking about soon,

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:53.006 A:middle
call background transfers
in order

00:25:53.006 --> 00:25:56.466 A:middle
to download even bigger
things like photos or videos

00:25:56.766 --> 00:25:58.816 A:middle
to allow you to get
an experience

00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:00.706 A:middle
where the user can pop
up in your application

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:00.706 A:middle
where the user can pop
up in your application

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
and instantly start
viewing, you know,

00:26:03.196 --> 00:26:05.076 A:middle
large beautiful photos
or videos.

00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:12.486 A:middle
So next, let's talk about
Remote Notifications.

00:26:13.026 --> 00:26:19.396 A:middle
So if any of you have a kind of
messaging functionality inside

00:26:19.396 --> 00:26:22.216 A:middle
of your application, I'm sure
you're familiar with this flow.

00:26:22.286 --> 00:26:28.666 A:middle
If I send a message to somebody
over my new application here,

00:26:30.376 --> 00:26:34.016 A:middle
what happens is my server send
a push to the Apple servers

00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:35.386 A:middle
and that sends a
push to the device

00:26:35.926 --> 00:26:38.536 A:middle
and that causes a
notification banner to show

00:26:38.536 --> 00:26:39.286 A:middle
up on the lock screen.

00:26:41.686 --> 00:26:45.196 A:middle
When the user goes and slides
to view that notification,

00:26:45.586 --> 00:26:48.016 A:middle
only then is your
application launched or resumed

00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:51.276 A:middle
and then that's when you go
and retrieve the full message

00:26:51.806 --> 00:26:54.336 A:middle
so that it's ready to view.

00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:57.726 A:middle
Now, this can leave
users with a bit of lag

00:26:57.836 --> 00:27:02.236 A:middle
where they see either the old
message or an old transcript

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.836 --> 00:27:02.236 A:middle
where they see either the old
message or an old transcript

00:27:02.236 --> 00:27:03.546 A:middle
that they were looking
at before.

00:27:04.426 --> 00:27:07.296 A:middle
And then only after a few
seconds does it actually update

00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:09.566 A:middle
to show them their message.

00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:13.126 A:middle
So we flipped this around.

00:27:13.976 --> 00:27:18.996 A:middle
In iOS 7, you can actually get
woken up before the user sees

00:27:18.996 --> 00:27:20.036 A:middle
that banner notification.

00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:22.946 A:middle
So you can immediately
retrieve that message

00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:26.126 A:middle
and then make it ready
for viewing so that

00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:28.516 A:middle
when the user just swipes
to view on the lock screen,

00:27:29.006 --> 00:27:30.506 A:middle
they can see that
message right away

00:27:30.536 --> 00:27:32.876 A:middle
and we think this
is really powerful.

00:27:33.516 --> 00:27:41.526 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:46.916 A:middle
In addition, you can omit that
alert line and that'll allow you

00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:49.356 A:middle
to actually send a
silent notification.

00:27:50.126 --> 00:27:51.656 A:middle
And this gets delivered
in the background.

00:27:51.656 --> 00:27:53.856 A:middle
Again, if your app wasn't
running, we'd launch it.

00:27:54.196 --> 00:27:55.286 A:middle
If it is running, we resume it.

00:27:56.506 --> 00:27:58.516 A:middle
And you can go and retrieve
whatever content you need

00:27:58.516 --> 00:27:59.176 A:middle
to at this point.

00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
Now, this is incredibly
powerful.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
Now, this is incredibly
powerful.

00:28:02.736 --> 00:28:05.776 A:middle
We think there's a lot of
applications that we'll be able

00:28:05.776 --> 00:28:07.966 A:middle
to take advantage of
this and do really,

00:28:07.966 --> 00:28:10.206 A:middle
really great auto
behavior with it.

00:28:10.976 --> 00:28:13.876 A:middle
There are a couple
things to note.

00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:17.976 A:middle
There's a new protocol that
we're introducing this year

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:21.536 A:middle
that is optional right now.

00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:24.526 A:middle
That also was intended
to support silent pushes.

00:28:25.246 --> 00:28:29.716 A:middle
And you should go to the push
notifications lab on Wednesday

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:32.276 A:middle
to learn more about it.

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:34.606 A:middle
We think many providers
will get a kick

00:28:34.606 --> 00:28:36.556 A:middle
out of what the new
protocol can do.

00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:42.106 A:middle
But for you guys, all you need
to know is that you just need

00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:44.026 A:middle
to provide this content
available flag here

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:47.266 A:middle
and you can set silent
notifications that gets

00:28:47.266 --> 00:28:48.016 A:middle
to your app up to date.

00:28:49.356 --> 00:28:50.286 A:middle
So let's take a look about the--

00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:52.216 A:middle
at the API in a little
bit more detail.

00:28:52.216 --> 00:28:55.096 A:middle
So this should be
a familiar pattern.

00:28:55.426 --> 00:28:57.996 A:middle
You just set this
Remote Notification key

00:28:57.996 --> 00:28:59.006 A:middle
in the UI background modes

00:28:59.056 --> 00:29:01.866 A:middle
or use the X code
feature capabilities menu

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.056 --> 00:29:01.866 A:middle
or use the X code
feature capabilities menu

00:29:01.866 --> 00:29:04.996 A:middle
to enable this.

00:29:05.206 --> 00:29:10.656 A:middle
You set content-available 1
in your APS payload and then

00:29:10.846 --> 00:29:13.126 A:middle
when your app is launched in
the background or resumed,

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:16.036 A:middle
you will get a,
didReceiveRemoteNotification

00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:17.436 A:middle
with a completion handler.

00:29:18.426 --> 00:29:21.086 A:middle
So that will allow you to go
and retrieve that new message

00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:22.296 A:middle
or whatever you need to do.

00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:25.756 A:middle
And then call the completion
handler when you're done.

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:30.456 A:middle
So again, in order to do a
silent push, all you need

00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:38.476 A:middle
to do is omit that alert or
sound entry in the APS payload.

00:29:38.616 --> 00:29:41.896 A:middle
Important thing to realize about
silent notifications though is

00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:43.146 A:middle
that the rate limited.

00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:47.186 A:middle
With normal notifications,
we fully expect users

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:48.186 A:middle
to be able to manage that.

00:29:48.296 --> 00:29:49.566 A:middle
If you're annoying your user,

00:29:49.856 --> 00:29:51.866 A:middle
they will clearly do
something about it.

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.906 A:middle
But with silent notifications,
obviously,

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:56.746 A:middle
if the user doesn't have
any indication of them,

00:29:57.126 --> 00:29:58.406 A:middle
they can't manage
that on their own.

00:29:59.346 --> 00:30:04.956 A:middle
So iOS and our push servers will
manage a rate limit for you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.346 --> 00:30:04.956 A:middle
So iOS and our push servers will
manage a rate limit for you.

00:30:05.926 --> 00:30:08.376 A:middle
And the thing you need
to get out of this is

00:30:08.376 --> 00:30:11.396 A:middle
that we're not asking you

00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:16.726 A:middle
to hold back your silent
push notifications.

00:30:17.236 --> 00:30:19.416 A:middle
We want you to send
them as frequently

00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:20.706 A:middle
as your application dictates.

00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:23.476 A:middle
And the thing you
need to realize is

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:25.536 A:middle
that we've done the work
for you to make sure

00:30:25.536 --> 00:30:29.756 A:middle
that the device can protect
itself and that it can make sure

00:30:29.756 --> 00:30:30.986 A:middle
that it doesn't run out of power

00:30:30.986 --> 00:30:33.116 A:middle
because it's using too
many push notifications.

00:30:34.106 --> 00:30:37.416 A:middle
So, I just want to let you know
how this works so that you can--

00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:39.206 A:middle
as you're going ahead
and testing this

00:30:39.456 --> 00:30:43.196 A:middle
that you're not surprised by the
way the pushes are rate limited.

00:30:44.516 --> 00:30:48.356 A:middle
So when the push rate is
completely acceptable and,

00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:51.706 A:middle
you know, let's say you're
sending only a couple an hour,

00:30:51.706 --> 00:30:53.736 A:middle
something like that, both normal

00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:56.006 A:middle
and silent push notifications
are delivered immediately.

00:30:56.106 --> 00:30:57.946 A:middle
You have that same quality
service that we have today,

00:30:58.266 --> 00:31:00.516 A:middle
it just sends straight
through and of course,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.266 --> 00:31:00.516 A:middle
it just sends straight
through and of course,

00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:01.776 A:middle
they don't wake up the device.

00:31:02.496 --> 00:31:04.326 A:middle
Or rather they don't
wake the screen up.

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.106 A:middle
When that push rate is too high,

00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:09.216 A:middle
silent pushes can
then get stored

00:31:09.216 --> 00:31:11.356 A:middle
for later delivery
on our servers.

00:31:11.696 --> 00:31:13.976 A:middle
And for those of
you who are familiar

00:31:13.976 --> 00:31:15.356 A:middle
with the way pushes work today,

00:31:15.866 --> 00:31:18.546 A:middle
we still have the same
storage guarantee, we store one

00:31:18.546 --> 00:31:21.056 A:middle
on the server, and if there's
another silent notification

00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:22.856 A:middle
that comes in when the push
rate is still too high,

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:26.776 A:middle
that will get stored
in the server.

00:31:26.776 --> 00:31:30.776 A:middle
Then, if there's any
other communication

00:31:30.776 --> 00:31:33.696 A:middle
between the Apple push
service and the device,

00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:39.456 A:middle
we'll actually put that silent
notification on the back of that

00:31:39.456 --> 00:31:42.186 A:middle
and actually piggyback that
along, send along to the device.

00:31:42.606 --> 00:31:44.426 A:middle
So we're not halting
your pushes.

00:31:44.706 --> 00:31:46.816 A:middle
All we're doing is delaying
it by just a little bit

00:31:46.876 --> 00:31:49.696 A:middle
until when it's a good
time for the device

00:31:49.796 --> 00:31:51.566 A:middle
to receive it based on power.

00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:55.636 A:middle
So again, there's
nothing special

00:31:55.636 --> 00:31:56.616 A:middle
that you need to do here.

00:31:56.996 --> 00:32:00.306 A:middle
All you need to do is
realize that the device

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.996 --> 00:32:00.306 A:middle
All you need to do is
realize that the device

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:02.516 A:middle
and the servers will take
care of the rate for you,

00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:03.696 A:middle
that you can just send it

00:32:03.696 --> 00:32:07.306 A:middle
when it's appropriate
for your application.

00:32:07.756 --> 00:32:10.896 A:middle
So here're some really great
examples that we came up with.

00:32:11.256 --> 00:32:13.416 A:middle
Obviously, like we
had in the example,

00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:16.656 A:middle
instant messaging is a
perfect example for this.

00:32:16.656 --> 00:32:19.526 A:middle
We think picture messaging
is especially important here

00:32:19.886 --> 00:32:22.446 A:middle
because oftentimes, when
you get that message,

00:32:22.786 --> 00:32:25.386 A:middle
the application needs to then
download that whole photo.

00:32:25.776 --> 00:32:27.836 A:middle
So now, you can download
it in the background

00:32:28.266 --> 00:32:31.156 A:middle
and that picture is completely
ready to go once users use that.

00:32:31.346 --> 00:32:33.546 A:middle
We think this is
really, really awesome.

00:32:34.046 --> 00:32:35.806 A:middle
This is really great for email.

00:32:36.206 --> 00:32:38.296 A:middle
So if you're already
sending push notifications

00:32:39.106 --> 00:32:41.526 A:middle
as email notifications,
right, you can then go

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:43.296 A:middle
and fetch the entire mailbox.

00:32:45.026 --> 00:32:46.696 A:middle
We think silent notification
is being used

00:32:46.696 --> 00:32:47.996 A:middle
for completely different things.

00:32:48.306 --> 00:32:51.746 A:middle
If you have episodic content,

00:32:51.746 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
you can get those downloaded
using the Background

00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:54.916 A:middle
Transfer Service.

00:32:55.226 --> 00:32:59.616 A:middle
There are applications out
there that implement this kind

00:32:59.616 --> 00:33:02.956 A:middle
of read some stories later
kind of functionality.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.616 --> 00:33:02.956 A:middle
of read some stories later
kind of functionality.

00:33:03.256 --> 00:33:06.366 A:middle
And some applications
have actually gone so far

00:33:06.366 --> 00:33:09.396 A:middle
as to implement a
fetching behavior

00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:11.736 A:middle
on the back of region
monitoring.

00:33:12.066 --> 00:33:15.386 A:middle
So that when you go home or you
leave work, you can actually go

00:33:15.386 --> 00:33:16.496 A:middle
and download content then.

00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.196 A:middle
We think that this is
a much better model.

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:23.016 A:middle
All you do in that case is
when the user add something

00:33:23.016 --> 00:33:25.686 A:middle
to that list, selling the silent
notification to the device

00:33:25.986 --> 00:33:28.766 A:middle
because A, the user
doesn't need to be notified

00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:30.136 A:middle
that they added something
to that list.

00:33:30.486 --> 00:33:31.336 A:middle
So that should be silent.

00:33:31.816 --> 00:33:33.886 A:middle
And then the application
can download that content

00:33:34.336 --> 00:33:35.486 A:middle
that they want to read offline.

00:33:35.946 --> 00:33:37.806 A:middle
So we think this is
actually really awesome

00:33:37.806 --> 00:33:40.376 A:middle
and it will work really well.

00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:45.136 A:middle
For Purchase Syncing, so if
you have a library of magazines

00:33:45.136 --> 00:33:47.866 A:middle
or comic books or something,
and the user buys something

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:50.856 A:middle
on your website, this can be a
great way to send a notification

00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:54.026 A:middle
to the device so that it can
go download that new content

00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:55.236 A:middle
so it's available offline.

00:33:55.236 --> 00:33:58.946 A:middle
Or if you have a File
Syncing application

00:33:58.946 --> 00:34:00.196 A:middle
with documents, same thing.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.946 --> 00:34:00.196 A:middle
with documents, same thing.

00:34:00.726 --> 00:34:04.776 A:middle
Just send that notification
when it's ready, and then go.

00:34:05.016 --> 00:34:06.416 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit

00:34:06.416 --> 00:34:10.416 A:middle
about how silent
notifications can work

00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:14.366 A:middle
with background transfers to
provide a brand new feature,

00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:17.556 A:middle
auto downloading in
a TV application.

00:34:18.255 --> 00:34:22.106 A:middle
So let's say some TV network
has an application out there

00:34:22.106 --> 00:34:24.846 A:middle
that allows you to do
offline content viewing.

00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:28.815 A:middle
And they want to offer
a system where, hey,

00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:31.076 A:middle
every week when that
new episode of the show

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:35.196 A:middle
that the user's favorited is
ready that it can download

00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:37.766 A:middle
onto the device so that
they can view it at anytime.

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:41.295 A:middle
So the user asks
for new episodes

00:34:41.295 --> 00:34:42.536 A:middle
to be downloaded
when it's available.

00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:45.436 A:middle
When that episode is available,

00:34:46.556 --> 00:34:49.525 A:middle
the content provider can
just send a silent push

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:51.076 A:middle
to the devices that have
signed up for the stuff.

00:34:52.366 --> 00:34:54.295 A:middle
And so the app going to
wake up and can check

00:34:54.295 --> 00:34:56.866 A:middle
for any newly available
episodes and queue them

00:34:56.866 --> 00:34:58.366 A:middle
into the Background
Transfer Service

00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
so the application can go
back to sleep at this point

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
so the application can go
back to sleep at this point

00:35:01.556 --> 00:35:04.116 A:middle
and then once it's completed,
the application just wakes up,

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:09.526 A:middle
updates the UI and then post a
local notification letting the

00:35:09.526 --> 00:35:12.616 A:middle
user know that it
has new content.

00:35:17.696 --> 00:35:20.976 A:middle
So the same thing would kind of
go for File Syncing application.

00:35:20.976 --> 00:35:23.286 A:middle
If you, let's say,
favorite a particular file

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:24.846 A:middle
and then you want it
updated all the time,

00:35:25.396 --> 00:35:27.656 A:middle
whether that file changes,
let's say, if they're editing

00:35:27.656 --> 00:35:30.486 A:middle
on their desktop, that service
can send a silent push right

00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:32.576 A:middle
away and because it's rate
limited already, you don't need

00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:35.246 A:middle
to do anything to make sure
that's going at the right speed.

00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:39.396 A:middle
So once that app
wakes up, it can check

00:35:39.396 --> 00:35:43.216 A:middle
for any newly available files
and enqueue those file diffs

00:35:43.306 --> 00:35:45.486 A:middle
into the transfer
service and then the UI--

00:35:45.486 --> 00:35:50.706 A:middle
I'm sorry, the application will
then wake up and update its UI.

00:35:51.276 --> 00:35:53.146 A:middle
So receive push notifications

00:35:53.146 --> 00:35:54.456 A:middle
at the background,
we think this is big.

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:58.286 A:middle
Silent pushers are rate
limited and that's intended

00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:02.706 A:middle
to help save you
effort and time.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:02.706 A:middle
to help save you
effort and time.

00:36:02.906 --> 00:36:05.826 A:middle
So here were the two APIs that
we've talked about so far.

00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:10.246 A:middle
And when you're sitting down
and looking to enhance one

00:36:10.246 --> 00:36:13.926 A:middle
of your features with this,
we want you to kind of keep

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:16.376 A:middle
in consideration why you
would pick one or the other.

00:36:17.656 --> 00:36:18.796 A:middle
You would typically use fetch

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:21.676 A:middle
when the content is
really interesting

00:36:21.676 --> 00:36:22.856 A:middle
but not quite critical.

00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:23.936 A:middle
It's not really important

00:36:23.936 --> 00:36:25.456 A:middle
to let the user know
about it right away.

00:36:26.336 --> 00:36:27.636 A:middle
Whereas Remote Notifications

00:36:27.636 --> 00:36:29.116 A:middle
that would be a lot more
immediate, you know,

00:36:29.116 --> 00:36:31.986 A:middle
it's a message from their
friend or it needs as much time

00:36:31.986 --> 00:36:34.076 A:middle
as possible in order
to download.

00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:40.726 A:middle
If the content was available all
the time very, very frequently,

00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:45.646 A:middle
it can be really burdensome on
power as well as your servers

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:50.806 A:middle
to notify all the applications
about it whenever that happens.

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:52.976 A:middle
So we think that that's
a much better use case

00:36:52.976 --> 00:36:53.826 A:middle
for Background Fetch.

00:36:53.826 --> 00:36:56.436 A:middle
So for example, I
don't know about you

00:36:56.436 --> 00:36:58.376 A:middle
but my social networking
feeds always look

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:01.746 A:middle
like they're updating
every single second.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:01.746 A:middle
like they're updating
every single second.

00:37:02.566 --> 00:37:07.406 A:middle
And for Remote Notifications,
it's fine if it's very frequent

00:37:07.406 --> 00:37:10.536 A:middle
but maybe that's more sporadic
so if I'm working on a document

00:37:10.536 --> 00:37:13.696 A:middle
on my PC and it's supposed
to sync to my phone,

00:37:14.206 --> 00:37:17.186 A:middle
that would be sporadic but maybe
kind of frequent for that period

00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:18.956 A:middle
of time, where Remote
Notifications would be the

00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:22.046 A:middle
appropriate thing to use there.

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:29.016 A:middle
OK, so let's dive into the
Background Transfer Service.

00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:34.496 A:middle
So in iOS 6, using the UI
application background test API,

00:37:35.436 --> 00:37:38.876 A:middle
applications can transfer files
while in the foreground or even

00:37:38.876 --> 00:37:40.616 A:middle
for a few minutes when
the application returns

00:37:40.616 --> 00:37:41.226 A:middle
to the background.

00:37:41.766 --> 00:37:44.186 A:middle
But that's limited sort
of arbitrarily by time.

00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:46.436 A:middle
You only get a few minutes
to download or upload

00:37:46.826 --> 00:37:50.216 A:middle
and that can cause weird user
experience where, you know,

00:37:50.216 --> 00:37:51.696 A:middle
maybe your video
didn't finish uploading.

00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.676 A:middle
So in addition, you
couldn't kind

00:37:54.676 --> 00:37:58.116 A:middle
of effectively download the
content or upload large assets.

00:37:59.116 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
In iOS 7, we've changed this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.116 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
In iOS 7, we've changed this.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:04.496 A:middle
We're providing a service that
allows you to enqueue downloads

00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:07.396 A:middle
and uploads that are managed
by the OS that continue even

00:38:07.396 --> 00:38:10.786 A:middle
after your application
exits or the device reboots.

00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:12.546 A:middle
It's not restricted by time.

00:38:12.746 --> 00:38:16.216 A:middle
We intend this for you
to enqueue large things.

00:38:17.576 --> 00:38:20.216 A:middle
You can enqueue it anytime,
either from the foreground.

00:38:20.376 --> 00:38:23.836 A:middle
Let's say if the user decided
to upload a video or download,

00:38:24.186 --> 00:38:27.846 A:middle
let's say an episodic content,
or from the background.

00:38:27.846 --> 00:38:29.906 A:middle
So if you get woken up
for a Background Fetch

00:38:29.906 --> 00:38:32.416 A:middle
or for Remote Notifications,
that's a great time

00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:36.246 A:middle
to enqueue a transfer into
Background Transfer Service.

00:38:37.616 --> 00:38:39.886 A:middle
And of course, your
application is woken

00:38:39.886 --> 00:38:43.316 A:middle
up to handle authentication
errors or completion.

00:38:43.476 --> 00:38:45.476 A:middle
So once it's done,
you can update your UI

00:38:45.716 --> 00:38:47.806 A:middle
and make sure the user
sees it very prominently,

00:38:47.806 --> 00:38:49.816 A:middle
that they have a new
piece of content.

00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:57.466 A:middle
So let's just take a
quick look at the API.

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:03.256 A:middle
So we are introducing a new
class called NSURLSession today.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:03.256 A:middle
So we are introducing a new
class called NSURLSession today.

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:05.356 A:middle
It's part of the
CFNetwork framework

00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:09.486 A:middle
and I highly encourage you
to go to the What's New

00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:12.336 A:middle
in Foundation Networking
talk as well

00:39:12.336 --> 00:39:14.776 A:middle
as the foundation networking
lab and we'll have links

00:39:14.776 --> 00:39:15.446 A:middle
at the end of the talk.

00:39:16.586 --> 00:39:18.256 A:middle
So you create this NSURLSession,

00:39:18.306 --> 00:39:21.756 A:middle
you configure it using a
background session configuration

00:39:21.756 --> 00:39:25.366 A:middle
and then all you do is you
enqueue these NSURLSessionTasks

00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:28.346 A:middle
that are associated with
an existing NSURLRequest.

00:39:28.636 --> 00:39:30.576 A:middle
So any of the NSURLRequests
that you're doing right now,

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.576 A:middle
all you do is you attach
them to the session task

00:39:32.896 --> 00:39:34.266 A:middle
and enqueue them
into the service.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:37.836 A:middle
And this can be download
tasks or upload tasks

00:39:38.336 --> 00:39:39.536 A:middle
and those just continue.

00:39:40.056 --> 00:39:44.836 A:middle
And then once you're-- once
that transfer is complete,

00:39:45.846 --> 00:39:48.006 A:middle
if you're in the background,
if you're not running

00:39:48.006 --> 00:39:50.626 A:middle
or you have been suspended, your
application will get launched

00:39:50.626 --> 00:39:52.786 A:middle
into background, you'll
get did finish launching

00:39:52.966 --> 00:39:55.756 A:middle
and then you'll get this new
callback called handle events

00:39:55.756 --> 00:39:58.436 A:middle
for background URL session
with a completion handler.

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.076 A:middle
And what this allows
you to do is reconnect

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.076 A:middle
And what this allows
you to do is reconnect

00:40:01.076 --> 00:40:03.886 A:middle
to your NSURLSession by
providing a unique identifier.

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:06.646 A:middle
And that will allow you
to handle that new content

00:40:07.026 --> 00:40:10.426 A:middle
so you can, for example,
you know, update your UI

00:40:10.426 --> 00:40:11.916 A:middle
to prominently show
that there's--

00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:14.996 A:middle
your upload is completed or
that your download is done.

00:40:15.986 --> 00:40:19.316 A:middle
And then, of course, you want
to call the completion handler

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:22.236 A:middle
to make sure that the
system can go back to sleep

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:26.716 A:middle
and your snapshot gets taken.

00:40:28.366 --> 00:40:32.806 A:middle
So within the transfer
service, we have this notion

00:40:32.806 --> 00:40:34.326 A:middle
of a discretionary transfer.

00:40:35.086 --> 00:40:38.896 A:middle
And discretionary transfers
help preserve battery life

00:40:38.896 --> 00:40:39.766 A:middle
and data usage.

00:40:39.996 --> 00:40:42.496 A:middle
And the way they do that is
that they're power managed

00:40:43.106 --> 00:40:44.846 A:middle
and they also only go for Wi-Fi.

00:40:45.716 --> 00:40:48.866 A:middle
So if you enqueue a
transfer from the background,

00:40:49.076 --> 00:40:50.996 A:middle
these transfers will
always be discretionary.

00:40:51.686 --> 00:40:53.446 A:middle
And if you're enqueuing
something let's say

00:40:53.446 --> 00:40:56.346 A:middle
from the foreground, that
transfer can optionally request

00:40:56.346 --> 00:40:57.316 A:middle
for it to be discretionary.

00:40:57.536 --> 00:40:59.956 A:middle
So for example, if it's
something that is not--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:01.016 --> 00:41:02.966 A:middle
let's say, it needs to
happen at some point

00:41:02.966 --> 00:41:04.776 A:middle
but the user didn't
say specifically,

00:41:04.776 --> 00:41:06.746 A:middle
"I want this downloaded,"
that would be something

00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:08.276 A:middle
that you would enqueue
as discretionary.

00:41:08.886 --> 00:41:12.486 A:middle
So here're some examples.

00:41:12.876 --> 00:41:15.326 A:middle
So this would be incredibly
useful for uploading photos

00:41:15.326 --> 00:41:16.636 A:middle
and videos like we said before.

00:41:17.316 --> 00:41:20.776 A:middle
Used in combination with some of
the existing multitasking modes,

00:41:21.056 --> 00:41:23.796 A:middle
so for example, if you have
significant location change,

00:41:24.206 --> 00:41:27.136 A:middle
and your user, for example,
flies to San Francisco,

00:41:27.526 --> 00:41:31.216 A:middle
they can download, let's say,
new Map Packs and new tiles

00:41:31.216 --> 00:41:33.916 A:middle
for the area in order to
automatically make sure

00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:35.796 A:middle
that their navigation
application continues

00:41:35.796 --> 00:41:36.456 A:middle
to work really well.

00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:41.196 A:middle
This will help keep your app
up to date by downloading

00:41:41.196 --> 00:41:43.066 A:middle
in the background number
of different things.

00:41:43.066 --> 00:41:47.156 A:middle
Maybe even, you know,
podcast or game content.

00:41:47.536 --> 00:41:48.886 A:middle
We think this will
be really great

00:41:48.886 --> 00:41:51.846 A:middle
and users will get
a kick out of this.

00:41:52.066 --> 00:41:55.826 A:middle
OK, so these are our three
new multitasking modes.

00:41:56.386 --> 00:41:57.556 A:middle
We think they're
really excellent.

00:41:57.556 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
We think that they add
a lot to the ecosystem

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.556 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
We think that they add
a lot to the ecosystem

00:42:00.596 --> 00:42:06.466 A:middle
and we really can't wait to
see what you guys do with it.

00:42:07.996 --> 00:42:09.286 A:middle
So details.

00:42:09.836 --> 00:42:12.216 A:middle
We have the viewed details that
we want to discuss with you

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:15.896 A:middle
to make sure that as you're
architecting your applications

00:42:15.896 --> 00:42:17.536 A:middle
to take advantages of
these new opportunities

00:42:17.836 --> 00:42:20.336 A:middle
that you do the right
things in order to kind

00:42:20.336 --> 00:42:21.806 A:middle
of function well in the system.

00:42:23.056 --> 00:42:25.506 A:middle
The first thing to realize is
that you get a limited amount

00:42:25.506 --> 00:42:26.596 A:middle
of time to run to
the background.

00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:30.376 A:middle
This wouldn't be very power
efficient if you were able

00:42:30.456 --> 00:42:32.006 A:middle
to run for, let's
say 10 minutes.

00:42:32.426 --> 00:42:34.696 A:middle
You're given about less than
a minute to finish your update

00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:36.936 A:middle
and your fetch is in
parallel with other apps,

00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:38.856 A:middle
which means that you
want to make sure

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:41.896 A:middle
that your CPU profile is
as minimal as possible

00:42:41.896 --> 00:42:42.806 A:middle
and you're doing these updates.

00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:45.776 A:middle
Obviously, since this is
designed for networking,

00:42:46.136 --> 00:42:47.666 A:middle
we expect many of
your applications

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:49.016 A:middle
to use very little CPU time

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:51.306 A:middle
because you're just transferring
data for the most part.

00:42:51.956 --> 00:42:55.326 A:middle
But you want to make sure to
use time profile and instruments

00:42:55.326 --> 00:42:56.966 A:middle
to make sure that you
are using as much as--

00:42:57.126 --> 00:43:01.136 A:middle
as little CPU time as possible
and that there's nothing obvious

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.126 --> 00:43:01.136 A:middle
as little CPU time as possible
and that there's nothing obvious

00:43:01.166 --> 00:43:04.116 A:middle
that you can get rid off.

00:43:04.216 --> 00:43:07.126 A:middle
So, it's really important
that you also complete as soon

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:09.846 A:middle
as possible because if
you've been woken up,

00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:12.846 A:middle
the device is going to
stay awake for as much time

00:43:12.846 --> 00:43:16.116 A:middle
as it gave you until you
tell it to say, "I'm done,

00:43:16.116 --> 00:43:17.366 A:middle
I can let the system
go to sleep."

00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:19.376 A:middle
So it's important to
complete as soon as possible,

00:43:19.726 --> 00:43:22.326 A:middle
call the completion handler,
let the device sleep.

00:43:24.616 --> 00:43:26.786 A:middle
So the background task API.

00:43:27.706 --> 00:43:30.386 A:middle
When it's called from
the Background Fetch AP--

00:43:30.716 --> 00:43:33.156 A:middle
delegate or the Remote
Notification delegate

00:43:34.316 --> 00:43:36.036 A:middle
or the background
transfer completion,

00:43:36.566 --> 00:43:39.776 A:middle
your task will only be
given seconds to run

00:43:39.776 --> 00:43:41.076 A:middle
to the background
rather than minutes.

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.726 A:middle
We realize that many of you
use the background task API

00:43:44.996 --> 00:43:48.996 A:middle
to close database connections
or close file handlers

00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:50.486 A:middle
or other system resources.

00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.456 A:middle
And we want to let you continue
doing that but this is not a way

00:43:53.456 --> 00:43:56.106 A:middle
for your application to run
for minutes and minutes on it.

00:43:58.116 --> 00:43:59.096 A:middle
The next detail.

00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:01.296 A:middle
So like I said before,
your snapshot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:01.296 A:middle
So like I said before,
your snapshot

00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:03.776 A:middle
and your state restoration
is saved

00:44:03.776 --> 00:44:05.136 A:middle
after calling the
completion handler.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:07.506 A:middle
You want to make sure it
configure your view hierarchy

00:44:07.506 --> 00:44:09.126 A:middle
to hide sensitive
information like,

00:44:09.126 --> 00:44:10.326 A:middle
let's say the user's passwords

00:44:10.326 --> 00:44:12.626 A:middle
of your say password
management application.

00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:15.336 A:middle
And like I said before,
you really want

00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:18.096 A:middle
to use save restoration
to transition seamlessly

00:44:18.096 --> 00:44:19.866 A:middle
from that cool snapshot

00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:22.746 A:middle
of the app switcher
back to the application.

00:44:23.246 --> 00:44:28.216 A:middle
Next up is a bit of privacy.

00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:33.046 A:middle
We've always encouraged
you to use data protection

00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:34.546 A:middle
when handling sensitive
user data.

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:36.916 A:middle
This is incredibly
important for privacy.

00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:41.486 A:middle
We think that users come to
iOS and user applications

00:44:41.526 --> 00:44:46.136 A:middle
because it's a secure way
of using their device.

00:44:46.466 --> 00:44:49.396 A:middle
And so a lot of you
should be familiar

00:44:49.396 --> 00:44:51.666 A:middle
with this NSFileProtection API.

00:44:53.106 --> 00:44:54.416 A:middle
Just to explain just
a little bit.

00:44:54.776 --> 00:44:59.476 A:middle
Of course, there is a Data
Protection lab that you can go

00:44:59.476 --> 00:45:01.176 A:middle
to and we'll have a link
at the end of the session,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.476 --> 00:45:01.176 A:middle
to and we'll have a link
at the end of the session,

00:45:02.426 --> 00:45:04.576 A:middle
but let's explain
this for a second.

00:45:04.676 --> 00:45:06.996 A:middle
So we've got
NSFileProtectionComplete.

00:45:07.446 --> 00:45:10.886 A:middle
What that means is that
whenever the device is unlocked

00:45:11.046 --> 00:45:13.966 A:middle
and actively being used,
these files are available.

00:45:13.966 --> 00:45:15.586 A:middle
You can use them as normal.

00:45:15.586 --> 00:45:20.486 A:middle
But when the device is locked,
those files are inaccessible.

00:45:21.506 --> 00:45:25.156 A:middle
And of course, the low
means that these files

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:27.166 A:middle
and keychain items
are available always.

00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:30.496 A:middle
So even after the
first boot, you know,

00:45:30.496 --> 00:45:31.806 A:middle
when the device is
locked, et cetera.

00:45:32.476 --> 00:45:35.146 A:middle
And we highly encourage
you to not use the lowest

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.896 A:middle
but use the highest or one
of the ones in between.

00:45:38.136 --> 00:45:40.806 A:middle
And we'll go over what
this mean in just a second.

00:45:40.886 --> 00:45:44.336 A:middle
But for completeness, here
are the rest of the APIs

00:45:44.336 --> 00:45:47.046 A:middle
that you should be
looking at but of course,

00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:49.336 A:middle
that'll be on the slides
that you'll get afterwards

00:45:49.736 --> 00:45:52.646 A:middle
and you can look at it there.

00:45:52.856 --> 00:45:55.336 A:middle
So, why should you
care about this

00:45:55.336 --> 00:45:56.456 A:middle
if you're doing the right thing?

00:45:57.086 --> 00:45:59.496 A:middle
If you're doing the right
thing, your keychain items

00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:02.916 A:middle
and credential, so let's say,
users-- usernames and passwords

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:02.916 A:middle
and credential, so let's say,
users-- usernames and passwords

00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:06.366 A:middle
and log-in tokens
or cookies should be

00:46:06.366 --> 00:46:09.226 A:middle
in the keychain item
as a sec item.

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:13.526 A:middle
And that should be the
maximum protection.

00:46:13.526 --> 00:46:14.526 A:middle
That's actually the default.

00:46:15.346 --> 00:46:17.276 A:middle
Your database, SQLite database

00:46:17.276 --> 00:46:20.066 A:middle
or coordinated database should
also be using the complete

00:46:20.066 --> 00:46:22.116 A:middle
protection so that
it's not available

00:46:22.116 --> 00:46:23.596 A:middle
when the device is locked.

00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:28.176 A:middle
Now, we've just told you
about all these great ways

00:46:28.176 --> 00:46:31.486 A:middle
that you can wake up and run
in the background and some

00:46:31.486 --> 00:46:33.566 A:middle
of those times, the device
is going to be locked.

00:46:33.566 --> 00:46:34.396 A:middle
It's going to be in their pocket

00:46:34.396 --> 00:46:35.966 A:middle
when they receive
a new text message

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:39.326 A:middle
or if they get an
opportunity to launch.

00:46:39.906 --> 00:46:42.406 A:middle
So that means that you
need to kind of make

00:46:42.406 --> 00:46:43.666 A:middle
that a little bit more partial.

00:46:44.366 --> 00:46:50.046 A:middle
You want to be able to
have access to connect

00:46:50.046 --> 00:46:52.946 A:middle
to your service,
but what we're going

00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:57.426 A:middle
to do here is set these keychain
items to be partially protected

00:46:57.616 --> 00:46:59.496 A:middle
and specifically, we're
going to use the mode

00:46:59.536 --> 00:47:02.636 A:middle
where the data is available
after the very first unlock.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.536 --> 00:47:02.636 A:middle
where the data is available
after the very first unlock.

00:47:04.336 --> 00:47:07.806 A:middle
So what we encourage you to
do is to actually create--

00:47:08.506 --> 00:47:10.946 A:middle
is not to actually
reduce the protection

00:47:11.046 --> 00:47:15.236 A:middle
of that main credential
but to create a kind

00:47:15.236 --> 00:47:18.356 A:middle
of derivative credential
that has limited access.

00:47:18.616 --> 00:47:20.426 A:middle
So you might make it Read-Only

00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:24.706 A:middle
or you might make it expire
within, let's say, a week or so,

00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:29.086 A:middle
so that if that were to get
out, then there wouldn't be,

00:47:29.086 --> 00:47:30.846 A:middle
you know, harmful consequences.

00:47:30.846 --> 00:47:36.686 A:middle
So what do you do with the
data that you then download?

00:47:36.686 --> 00:47:39.136 A:middle
So you have that credential,
you connect your server,

00:47:39.476 --> 00:47:41.226 A:middle
you're able to download
some new information.

00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:44.866 A:middle
What you wanted use is the
background mode that allows you

00:47:44.866 --> 00:47:50.466 A:middle
to have this data accessible
while the file handle is open.

00:47:50.466 --> 00:47:51.616 A:middle
And you can go back
and refer to the--

00:47:51.616 --> 00:47:53.096 A:middle
read the previous
slides afterwards,

00:47:53.446 --> 00:47:57.166 A:middle
but all it does is allows you
to download new data, save it,

00:47:57.376 --> 00:48:01.096 A:middle
and as soon as you close
it, it can be secured.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.376 --> 00:48:01.096 A:middle
and as soon as you close
it, it can be secured.

00:48:02.956 --> 00:48:06.376 A:middle
And then once that main
database is accessible

00:48:06.376 --> 00:48:08.376 A:middle
when the device is unlocked,
you're going to merge

00:48:08.376 --> 00:48:11.466 A:middle
that new data into your database
when that's appropriate.

00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:14.476 A:middle
So there's a fairly
common pattern.

00:48:14.926 --> 00:48:17.726 A:middle
You can definitely go to
the data protection lab

00:48:17.726 --> 00:48:21.186 A:middle
and get more details about how
to do this, but we encourage you

00:48:21.186 --> 00:48:22.586 A:middle
to do this instead
of, let's say,

00:48:22.586 --> 00:48:29.626 A:middle
just downgrading the protection
on your end credentials.

00:48:29.626 --> 00:48:33.626 A:middle
OK, so next is battery life
and cellular data usage.

00:48:34.526 --> 00:48:38.826 A:middle
So, even though the system
protects the device and the user

00:48:38.826 --> 00:48:41.436 A:middle
against excessive cellular data
usage and power efficient--

00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:46.556 A:middle
and power usage, you can do
a lot to be a good citizen

00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:48.686 A:middle
and make sure that on
the user's devices,

00:48:49.016 --> 00:48:51.536 A:middle
they get as many opportunities
as possible in order

00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:52.546 A:middle
to have other applications

00:48:52.546 --> 00:48:54.816 A:middle
and your own application
get launched more often.

00:48:55.906 --> 00:48:58.846 A:middle
Very specifically, the
more efficient you are,

00:48:59.776 --> 00:49:01.796 A:middle
the more opportunities
there will be for your app

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.776 --> 00:49:01.796 A:middle
the more opportunities
there will be for your app

00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:03.536 A:middle
and other apps to get launched.

00:49:05.246 --> 00:49:06.536 A:middle
So what can you do?

00:49:07.496 --> 00:49:09.296 A:middle
Well, just minimize
cellular data usage.

00:49:09.296 --> 00:49:11.416 A:middle
That's absolutely the
best thing you can do.

00:49:12.136 --> 00:49:14.726 A:middle
So we encourage you, before
calling the completion handler

00:49:14.726 --> 00:49:17.956 A:middle
to only really download what's
necessary to update your UI.

00:49:18.026 --> 00:49:20.246 A:middle
So download thumbnails
instead of full images.

00:49:20.576 --> 00:49:22.566 A:middle
But then enqueue
those full images

00:49:22.566 --> 00:49:25.686 A:middle
into a background transfer so
that the system can manage that.

00:49:26.796 --> 00:49:30.906 A:middle
For power efficiency, we
encourage you to enqueue

00:49:30.906 --> 00:49:34.336 A:middle
as many transfers as possible in
parallel that allows the radios

00:49:34.366 --> 00:49:36.196 A:middle
to go back to sleep as
quickly as possible.

00:49:36.896 --> 00:49:41.396 A:middle
So in addition, that also means
that if you have to be using,

00:49:41.396 --> 00:49:46.076 A:middle
let' say, Core Motion or one of
the other hardware-specific APIs

00:49:46.476 --> 00:49:49.926 A:middle
in order to, you know, provide
some kind of user interaction,

00:49:49.926 --> 00:49:51.016 A:middle
let's say you have a game

00:49:51.016 --> 00:49:54.636 A:middle
that involves moving your
phone around, we encourage you

00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:56.636 A:middle
to make sure that that's get
turned off while you're running

00:49:56.636 --> 00:49:59.896 A:middle
in the background so that
you're not impacting power.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:00.446 --> 00:50:01.716 A:middle
And then of course,
like I said before,

00:50:01.716 --> 00:50:03.416 A:middle
call the completion handler
as soon as you're done.

00:50:03.766 --> 00:50:07.316 A:middle
That allows the system
to go back to sleep.

00:50:07.316 --> 00:50:10.066 A:middle
OK, so a quick reminder as well.

00:50:11.066 --> 00:50:13.286 A:middle
If the user removes your
application from app switcher,

00:50:13.286 --> 00:50:14.816 A:middle
your application
will no longer run

00:50:14.816 --> 00:50:16.556 A:middle
until it's then relaunched
by the user.

00:50:17.026 --> 00:50:21.596 A:middle
So if your-- you know, you get
feedback from users of saying,

00:50:21.596 --> 00:50:23.826 A:middle
"Hey, I removed it and then
I was expecting update."

00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:28.476 A:middle
This why. And the same
is true for settings.

00:50:28.476 --> 00:50:31.416 A:middle
If the user turns you off,
obviously, you won't get

00:50:31.536 --> 00:50:33.886 A:middle
up any background opportunities.

00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:38.606 A:middle
We'll be introducing API soon
to inspect new settings--

00:50:38.866 --> 00:50:41.206 A:middle
sorry, new API that will
allow you to inspect settings

00:50:41.646 --> 00:50:44.746 A:middle
so that you can say, "Hey,
am I going to actually run

00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:46.446 A:middle
in the background after
this," so you can make sure

00:50:46.446 --> 00:50:49.086 A:middle
that if you're promising some
functionality to the user,

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:54.536 A:middle
that you can warn them, that
it's not going to be there.

00:50:54.536 --> 00:50:57.546 A:middle
And of course, like
Newsstand and Location,

00:50:58.076 --> 00:50:59.456 A:middle
they'll appear here as well.

00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:02.616 A:middle
So that the user can go
through and, you know,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:02.616 A:middle
So that the user can go
through and, you know,

00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:05.506 A:middle
turn off particular applications

00:51:05.576 --> 00:51:10.276 A:middle
or turn off Background Fetch
overall if they want to.

00:51:10.516 --> 00:51:17.296 A:middle
So this is multitasking in iOS 6
and we've added Background Fetch

00:51:17.346 --> 00:51:20.376 A:middle
which allows you to
periodically get new content.

00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:25.406 A:middle
We added Remote Notifications so
that your application can launch

00:51:25.406 --> 00:51:28.236 A:middle
and be updated, in-response
from push notification.

00:51:29.516 --> 00:51:31.686 A:middle
And finally, we have a
Background Transfer Service

00:51:31.976 --> 00:51:35.196 A:middle
that allows you to enqueue
large uploads and downloads

00:51:35.536 --> 00:51:38.306 A:middle
to be finished later and then
woken up in the background.

00:51:39.666 --> 00:51:42.126 A:middle
For more information,
you're welcome

00:51:42.126 --> 00:51:46.406 A:middle
to contact our evangelist and
look at the programming guide

00:51:46.406 --> 00:51:49.446 A:middle
as well as access
to developer forms.

00:51:50.406 --> 00:51:52.686 A:middle
We have a lot of
related sessions to this.

00:51:53.606 --> 00:51:56.296 A:middle
We highly encourage you
to go the What's New

00:51:56.296 --> 00:51:58.376 A:middle
in Foundation Networking
session.

00:51:58.736 --> 00:52:01.546 A:middle
The keychain session
will let you learn more

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.736 --> 00:52:01.546 A:middle
The keychain session
will let you learn more

00:52:01.546 --> 00:52:03.606 A:middle
about the data protection
pattern that I showed here.

00:52:04.256 --> 00:52:06.996 A:middle
I highly encourage you
to go to the What's New

00:52:06.996 --> 00:52:08.056 A:middle
in Core Location talk.

00:52:08.126 --> 00:52:10.706 A:middle
They have a lot of great
new things and you want

00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:14.376 A:middle
to check it out, as well as
the State Restoration talk.

00:52:14.526 --> 00:52:17.306 A:middle
You'll learn about how
do you state restoration

00:52:17.306 --> 00:52:19.356 A:middle
in your application,
how you can make sure

00:52:19.356 --> 00:52:21.906 A:middle
that your application
is up to date

00:52:21.906 --> 00:52:25.636 A:middle
when the user taps
on that app switcher.

00:52:25.806 --> 00:52:27.756 A:middle
With that, thank you.

00:52:28.516 --> 00:52:34.600 A:middle
