[ Silence ]

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, and welcome.

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:14.136 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:15.696 A:middle
How's everybody doing?

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.356 A:middle
It's been a fun week,
excellent, good.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.776 A:middle
I'm Gordie Freedman.

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:25.746 A:middle
I work on UIKit, and
today we're going to talk

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.516 A:middle
about State restoration on iOS.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.306 A:middle
So has this happened to you?

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:35.536 A:middle
You're using an application,
you go to do something else,

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.536 A:middle
and when you go back, the
application's lost your place.

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:44.056 A:middle
Maybe you were typing something,
maybe you were reading something

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:47.356 A:middle
and scrolled somewhere, but
the application went back

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.046 A:middle
to the beginning.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:51.086 A:middle
In fact, maybe you don't really
remember what you were doing.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:53.696 A:middle
You were hoping the
application would remember.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:57.616 A:middle
And as developers, we
don't want this to happen

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.236 A:middle
to the users of our apps.

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.016 A:middle
It can be very frustrating.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.016 A:middle
It can be very frustrating.

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:05.566 A:middle
But the good news is we've
got some really nice APIs

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:08.886 A:middle
that make it very easy to
provide a seamless experience

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.576 A:middle
when applications start back up.

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:15.036 A:middle
I'm going to talk about
four things today.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:19.916 A:middle
First I'm going to go over a
small recap of the feature.

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.056 A:middle
It's not a full review.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.626 A:middle
We did a session last year in
2012, and if you want to fill

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:29.436 A:middle
in some of the gaps,
you can go watch that.

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:31.566 A:middle
We also have some
documentation online,

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.076 A:middle
and you can check that out.

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.446 A:middle
But I think even if you're not
that familiar, you'll be able

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.036 A:middle
to follow along just fine.

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:43.206 A:middle
I'm going to focus a lot
on what's new in iOS 7.

00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:46.076 A:middle
We'll see what we've
added and how that plays.

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:51.106 A:middle
We're going to talk a
little bit about security

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.246 A:middle
and background operation --
couple of interesting topics

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.506 A:middle
that I think we might want

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.106 A:middle
to spend a little
time thinking about.

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:01.276 A:middle
And then finally, I'm going
to go over some of the tools

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:01.276 A:middle
And then finally, I'm going
to go over some of the tools

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:06.216 A:middle
that we have that can help you
to be able to both validate

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.735 A:middle
that you're doing -- or your
app is doing what you expect,

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:10.966 A:middle
and help diagnose problems.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.426 A:middle
So when we talk about
state restoration,

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:16.996 A:middle
it's a simple idea --

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:21.696 A:middle
one application to just go
back exactly where it was

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.286 A:middle
so the user's experience
is not interrupted,

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.926 A:middle
as if the application
had just been

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.356 A:middle
in the background all the time.

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:33.086 A:middle
And if the application exits and
restarts, the user won't know.

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:37.346 A:middle
And it really is predicated
on how the user views this,

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:39.726 A:middle
and we want to think a lot
about what the user's doing.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.456 A:middle
You want to look at
the different parts

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:46.356 A:middle
of your application and
examine what you need to save

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:47.596 A:middle
and what you need to restore.

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:50.476 A:middle
And that's great, but
start at the top down.

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:54.196 A:middle
Think about it as if you're
using the application and think,

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:57.186 A:middle
"If I was using this and it
went away, where do I want it

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.406 A:middle
to come back," and
then from there,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.756 A:middle
let that inform what
you save and restore.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.756 A:middle
let that inform what
you save and restore.

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:06.706 A:middle
I'm going to give a
short demo just to kind

00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.096 A:middle
of highlight what
I'm talking about.

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:13.456 A:middle
So I've got a very
simple application,

00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:15.676 A:middle
got a collection
view, you can see,

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:17.916 A:middle
do the nice collection
view layout stuff.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:20.496 A:middle
And I'm going to
scroll around and look

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.796 A:middle
for an image that I want to see.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.086 A:middle
So these are all thumbnails
with little titles --

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:27.356 A:middle
pretty standard stuff.

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:29.436 A:middle
I'm going to select one --

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:31.276 A:middle
you can see that I've got
the selection there --

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.376 A:middle
let it roll in.

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.336 A:middle
Let's make it a little
bigger so it's easier to see.

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:41.716 A:middle
Maybe I'll even get rid of these
bars here and make it like that.

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:44.986 A:middle
So as a user you might
find an interesting picture

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.066 A:middle
and then you want to
go show it to somebody,

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:50.556 A:middle
or the phone rings,
or something happens.

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:53.186 A:middle
The application goes
into the background.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:58.316 A:middle
And the application can exit
if left alone for awhile

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:01.216 A:middle
for various reasons, so I'm
going to force that here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:01.216 A:middle
for various reasons, so I'm
going to force that here.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
Now, I just want to
point out one thing.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.906 A:middle
Ordinarily when a user goes into
the switcher and flips an app

00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:11.356 A:middle
up like I just did,
it'll get rid

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.296 A:middle
of all the state
restoration information.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.976 A:middle
We do that on purpose
to kind of save a user

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:18.486 A:middle
if every time they run the app,

00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:21.146 A:middle
it starts up in a bad
state and they're stuck.

00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:23.796 A:middle
First thing a frustrated
user might do is go

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.166 A:middle
in and flick that up.

00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:26.416 A:middle
We'll get rid of the state,

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.296 A:middle
give them a clean
start if that happens.

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:31.036 A:middle
Hopefully it won't,
but it's an out.

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:35.776 A:middle
But for developers, sometimes
you don't want that to happen.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.706 A:middle
If you're trying to chase
a bug, you're trying

00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:40.026 A:middle
to diagnose something
or just simply testing,

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:43.046 A:middle
it's very convenient to go in,
kill the app and restart it.

00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:44.596 A:middle
You don't want to lose the info.

00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:47.416 A:middle
And I'll talk about that a
little more later, but I'm using

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.426 A:middle
that trick here just to make
the demo a little easier.

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.276 A:middle
So the app's not running
now, and if the user walked

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:55.466 A:middle
up to their friend
and said, "Hey,

00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:58.386 A:middle
look at this cool picture,"
well, let's see what happens

00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.776 A:middle
if we start it back up.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.736 A:middle
And it goes right
back to where it was.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:06.856 A:middle
It remembered that we weren't
showing any of the bars,

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:10.176 A:middle
remembered the size of the
image, and even some things

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.306 A:middle
that are behind the scenes.

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:14.106 A:middle
Let's go here, I'm just
going to peel it back

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.946 A:middle
with our cool new
gesture, and you can see

00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:18.726 A:middle
that it remembered
the scrollPosition

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:20.786 A:middle
and the selected cell.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:24.156 A:middle
So that's a pretty
unexciting demo,

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:25.756 A:middle
but it was supposed
to be actually.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:30.656 A:middle
The idea is it's predictable,
the users get what they want,

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:32.606 A:middle
and it's nice and
easy for everybody.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.146 A:middle
So let's look at what we did
in order to accomplish that.

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:41.536 A:middle
So first, what was
actually restored?

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:44.876 A:middle
We saw it from the user's
perspective, but as a developer,

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.776 A:middle
what were the constituent
pieces?

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:50.306 A:middle
We had a navigation controller.

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:54.266 A:middle
It remembered what
was pushed on it.

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:56.876 A:middle
We also remembered
the scrollPosition

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
in our collection view
and the selected cell.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
in our collection view
and the selected cell.

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:05.006 A:middle
And finally, we remembered
what image we were showing,

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:09.726 A:middle
the transformation we
applied to resize it.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:15.456 A:middle
So you'll find that when you
write state restoration code,

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:19.446 A:middle
a lot of what you do is map what
your application has already

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.326 A:middle
done into what you need
to save and restore.

00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:25.376 A:middle
Typically, you'll find
that there's a lot

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:26.746 A:middle
of really strong parallels

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:29.236 A:middle
between code you've
already written, ad in fact,

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:31.566 A:middle
you'll be able to
leverage and reuse most

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:32.486 A:middle
of the code you've written.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:36.786 A:middle
So here, let's see what happens
before we even saved state

00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:39.836 A:middle
when the user selected
that cell and we pushed

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:41.186 A:middle
on that image view controller.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.526 A:middle
If we didn't take any action

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
and we just loaded
the view controller,

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:48.306 A:middle
we wouldn't have an
image or a title.

00:06:49.456 --> 00:06:53.126 A:middle
We want to put something there,
and we also want to remember

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:55.276 A:middle
that we're going to change
that title up top, too.

00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:57.346 A:middle
So what do we do?

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
Well, we have a method called
prepare for segway that you use

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
Well, we have a method called
prepare for segway that you use

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.336 A:middle
when you have storyboards.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.746 A:middle
So that's what I have
in the example here.

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.026 A:middle
And then prepare for segway,

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.706 A:middle
I hand the view controller
that's coming in,

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:13.686 A:middle
our image view controller,
enough information

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:16.296 A:middle
so that it can get the
image and set that title.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.056 A:middle
So now when I did that
segway, we actually have

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:22.886 A:middle
that information right there.

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:26.966 A:middle
So similarly, when I save and
restoreState, I'm going to want

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.366 A:middle
to be able to maintain that.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:31.106 A:middle
So what do we do?

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:33.286 A:middle
Well, let's look at
how we saved state.

00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:36.266 A:middle
When the application
goes in the background,

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:39.686 A:middle
we're going to go all the view
controllers with identifiers,

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:42.276 A:middle
all the view controllers that
need to save their state,

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:43.616 A:middle
and give them a chance.

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:48.546 A:middle
So we're going to call them
method encodeRestorableState

00:07:48.546 --> 00:07:49.116 A:middle
with coder.

00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:51.266 A:middle
We're going to hand
a key to archiver

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:53.246 A:middle
where it can stash any
information it wants

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:54.116 A:middle
to restore later.

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:56.406 A:middle
So what do we need to save here?

00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
Well, we've got the
image, also that title.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
Well, we've got the
image, also that title.

00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:05.566 A:middle
But we don't want to write
out the bits of the image

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:08.336 A:middle
and actually save
an extra image file.

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:12.176 A:middle
And in fact, if you think about
it, you probably have one place

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:15.646 A:middle
that informs you of both the
image itself and that title.

00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
So let's just save an identifier
that we can use later to look

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.726 A:middle
up this information again.

00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:27.026 A:middle
And that as simple as
just encoding something

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:29.686 A:middle
into that archiver that's
passed into the method.

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:33.686 A:middle
And you can see here my image ID
is a string, so I'm just going

00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:35.926 A:middle
to encode an object,
give it a key

00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:37.366 A:middle
so I can look it back up later.

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:39.296 A:middle
Anything else?

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:41.956 A:middle
Well, we also remember whether

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:45.196 A:middle
or not the user was showing the
bars on the top and the bottom.

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.116 A:middle
So how do we save that?

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:48.836 A:middle
Just as simple.

00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.676 A:middle
Just going to encode
a Boolean here,

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.046 A:middle
and that's all we have to do.

00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:57.476 A:middle
So you'll notice, I'm not
showing a lot of code right now,

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.786 A:middle
and there's a couple
reasons for that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:03.966 A:middle
One is, what's important is to
try to get the concepts across,

00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:06.746 A:middle
so you can see what it is that
we're actually trying to do.

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:10.026 A:middle
If I show you the code, it's
easy to kind of get lost

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:12.406 A:middle
in the forest just
looking at it.

00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:15.416 A:middle
Now, we have released the code,
so you'll be able to check

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:17.796 A:middle
out this whole example and
see everything I'm talking

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:22.126 A:middle
about here in more detail, but
you can do it on your own time.

00:09:22.906 --> 00:09:27.276 A:middle
So how did we know to
call encodeRestorableState

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.096 A:middle
for that view controller object?

00:09:29.976 --> 00:09:31.436 A:middle
Well, here's all
the view controllers

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.206 A:middle
in my application so far.

00:09:33.386 --> 00:09:36.206 A:middle
We've got the navigation
controller, that collection view

00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:38.216 A:middle
with all the little
images, the thumbnails.

00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:41.156 A:middle
What we just looked at was
the image view controller,

00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:43.546 A:middle
and of course there's some
views that go along with those.

00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:47.416 A:middle
What you do is you give them
restoration identifiers.

00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:52.156 A:middle
That tells us that you want us
to keep track of those objects

00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:54.826 A:middle
when we save state and
when we restore it.

00:09:55.306 --> 00:09:58.736 A:middle
And we will also call the
encodeRestorableState method

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.876 A:middle
on all of them so that
we save everything.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.876 A:middle
on all of them so that
we save everything.

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:07.256 A:middle
Okay. So how about
when we restoreState?

00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:11.486 A:middle
So at this point, the
application is starting back up.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.806 A:middle
Do you need to do
anything different

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.386 A:middle
when an application starts up
when you're restoring state

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:20.976 A:middle
versus the very first time
the application launches?

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:25.056 A:middle
Well, when an application
launches, we tell the delegate

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:30.386 A:middle
that we're starting up, and here
we just simply call or recall,

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:34.396 A:middle
the method application Will
finishLaunching with options.

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:37.006 A:middle
And you don't have to do
anything different here

00:10:37.376 --> 00:10:40.966 A:middle
in the state restoration
case; just proceed as normal.

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:46.126 A:middle
Set up your base interface, will
either load your base interface

00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:47.756 A:middle
from a storyboard or a nib,

00:10:47.996 --> 00:10:50.056 A:middle
or you can execute
whatever code you have,

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.686 A:middle
get your window visible,
and you're good to go,

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.126 A:middle
and that's our starting point.

00:10:55.686 --> 00:10:58.436 A:middle
Then we're going to
go and we're going

00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:01.626 A:middle
to call the restorationMethods
for the objects

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:01.626 A:middle
to call the restorationMethods
for the objects

00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:02.576 A:middle
that are participating.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.366 A:middle
So in this case, let's look
at the image controller.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:10.116 A:middle
So here, you can see we're
starting off without our image.

00:11:10.246 --> 00:11:11.986 A:middle
How do we get it back?

00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:16.696 A:middle
We have a complimentary method,
decodeRestorableStateWithCoder.

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:19.416 A:middle
It's kind of the analog to
the one I just showed you,

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:22.166 A:middle
where you saved your
state, fairly logical.

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:25.726 A:middle
So what we're going to
do is we're going to pull

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:28.946 A:middle
in that image identifier,
which informs us both

00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:30.596 A:middle
of the image and the title.

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.486 A:middle
You can see that I got that.

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.006 A:middle
Anything else?

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:36.536 A:middle
Well, how did we get it?

00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:40.816 A:middle
Similar to the way we encoded
it, we just simply decode it.

00:11:41.046 --> 00:11:42.886 A:middle
And when you write this
code and you look at it,

00:11:43.116 --> 00:11:45.106 A:middle
the code itself is very simple.

00:11:46.326 --> 00:11:48.256 A:middle
What's interesting
is when you think

00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:51.136 A:middle
about how your application is
structured and see what it is

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.696 A:middle
that you need to
save and restore.

00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:54.546 A:middle
The code is very boilerplate.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:59.816 A:middle
We also kept track of whether or
not we were showing those bars.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:03.976 A:middle
Again, we just simply
decoded Boolean and set it up.

00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:06.646 A:middle
Now, I'm not showing you
the code that actually goes

00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:08.766 A:middle
and draws the image
and sets the title.

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.846 A:middle
In your application,

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.046 A:middle
you've already written
the code that does that.

00:12:13.306 --> 00:12:15.716 A:middle
When you first presented
that image view controller

00:12:15.716 --> 00:12:19.686 A:middle
or used the segway transition,
you obviously have some code

00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:21.406 A:middle
that goes and loads
in the image.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.036 A:middle
And with state restoration,

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:25.276 A:middle
you'll always be
able to reuse that.

00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:28.376 A:middle
So here, all we're trying to do
is get the information we need

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.556 A:middle
and then pass it around.

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:32.546 A:middle
And I'll show you that in
a little more detail later.

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:36.926 A:middle
So do we have to
do anything else?

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:37.686 A:middle
I mean, we had a lot

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:39.136 A:middle
of different things
getting restored,

00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:40.786 A:middle
and I just showed you
a little bit of code.

00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:44.666 A:middle
Remember, the navigation
controller remembered to stack.

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:47.436 A:middle
It remembered that we had
this view controller presented

00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:50.526 A:middle
on top -- I'm sorry -- pushed
on top of that collection view.

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:59.696 A:middle
We also had scroll position
and our selected self.

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:03.376 A:middle
And we also had that image
sized up as it should have been.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:03.376 A:middle
And we also had that image
sized up as it should have been.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.316 A:middle
Did you have to write any
code to do any of that?

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.626 A:middle
Well, it turns out you
didn't have to do anything.

00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:10.566 A:middle
You get all of that for free.

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:12.556 A:middle
And how does that happen?

00:13:13.496 --> 00:13:16.186 A:middle
Well, I mentioned
before that when you set

00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:20.436 A:middle
up all the restoration
identifiers, it both informs us

00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:23.796 A:middle
of what needs to be saved but
also allows us to call methods

00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:25.076 A:middle
to save and restore state.

00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:28.856 A:middle
And we have a whole bunch
of base implementations

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.416 A:middle
that save all the stuff for
you which is very convenient,

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:34.316 A:middle
saving you the tedium of having

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:36.176 A:middle
to write these very
common things.

00:13:36.246 --> 00:13:38.886 A:middle
So we keep track of a
lot of default behaviors,

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:41.566 A:middle
a lot of information
automatically for you.

00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:44.606 A:middle
So you get a lot of leverage,
you get a lot of bang

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:47.466 A:middle
for your buck for
setting this up.

00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:53.766 A:middle
So let's talk about
what's new in iOS 7.

00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:57.106 A:middle
We had some great
successes this year.

00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:59.066 A:middle
We've seen people
implementing this

00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.856 A:middle
and some really nice apps
incorporating state restoration.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.856 A:middle
and some really nice apps
incorporating state restoration.

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:06.816 A:middle
And we felt that we had a nice
starting point for all this,

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:08.866 A:middle
but that there were
some additional things

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:12.096 A:middle
that we could do that would
make it even easier to use,

00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:16.076 A:middle
and also we wanted to continue
to grow as we add new facilities

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:19.776 A:middle
to iOS and as apps continue
to get more sophisticated.

00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:24.696 A:middle
So let's look at what we've got.

00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:29.046 A:middle
We found that with view
controllers and views,

00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:33.116 A:middle
you sometimes wanted to also
have objects participate

00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:35.226 A:middle
in state restoration
like a data source

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.966 A:middle
or some other nonview
controller object

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.336 A:middle
in the same way the
view controllers

00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:41.526 A:middle
and views participate.

00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:46.906 A:middle
So we added the ability for any
object to be able to get added

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:51.626 A:middle
to the state restoration graph
and save and restore its state.

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:56.196 A:middle
Also, we've made it
easier for you to figure

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.026 A:middle
out when you can apply state.

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.266 A:middle
Something that's a
little tricky sometimes is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.266 A:middle
Something that's a
little tricky sometimes is

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:05.096 A:middle
when your application restores
all of its state but isn't sure

00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:08.216 A:middle
of the order that different
things will get resorted in.

00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:11.056 A:middle
So after you've pulled the
view controller state back,

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.926 A:middle
is it safe to go
and draw everything

00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:15.916 A:middle
on the screen, or
apply everything?

00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:18.366 A:middle
Well, it might depend
on other objects

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:20.766 A:middle
that are also participating,
and we don't want you

00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:21.976 A:middle
to have to worry about that.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.926 A:middle
So I'll show how we've
made that easier to handle.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:29.836 A:middle
We've done a lot of work
with Snapshot handling.

00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:33.676 A:middle
Previously when an
application restored state,

00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:35.146 A:middle
we would show the default PNG,

00:15:35.146 --> 00:15:38.266 A:middle
and when the application
started up, we would just jump

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:39.766 A:middle
to wherever its state was.

00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:42.486 A:middle
Now to provide a more
seamless experience,

00:15:42.746 --> 00:15:44.966 A:middle
we'll use a Snapshot
very aggressively,

00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:46.606 A:middle
and I'll go through
how you do that

00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:49.186 A:middle
and how you still have
some control over that.

00:15:50.056 --> 00:15:52.936 A:middle
There's also some small
enhancements I'll discuss.

00:15:53.766 --> 00:15:55.366 A:middle
We just keep adding new things.

00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:58.686 A:middle
Last year in 2012 when
I talked about this,

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:02.126 A:middle
I mentioned you can implement
some state restoration

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:02.126 A:middle
I mentioned you can implement
some state restoration

00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:04.716 A:middle
for your app and then
enhance it or extend it

00:16:04.716 --> 00:16:05.946 A:middle
as you add new features.

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.286 A:middle
And we're taking our own advice
and doing the same thing,

00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:13.376 A:middle
so we started with the most
critical things, the basics,

00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.376 A:middle
and then we started to add
more things for this year.

00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:19.496 A:middle
So that's what's new.

00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:22.436 A:middle
Okay, first is generalized
objects.

00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:26.616 A:middle
So the idea here is to be
able to take objects that are

00:16:26.616 --> 00:16:29.696 A:middle
in view controllers and
views and also use them

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:32.316 A:middle
in the same way in state
restoration as you've been able

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:34.586 A:middle
to with our existing API.

00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:38.436 A:middle
So here's two of our
view controllers.

00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:41.876 A:middle
We have both the collection
view and then we also have

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:42.696 A:middle
that image controller.

00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:46.216 A:middle
And a very common thing
in an application is

00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:48.686 A:middle
to have a data source object.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.846 A:middle
And with that data source,
you'll be referring to it

00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:54.846 A:middle
for multiple objects
in the system.

00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:58.186 A:middle
So here I'm using the
data source to inform you

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.466 A:middle
of what images I have, how
many, what their titles are,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.466 A:middle
of what images I have, how
many, what their titles are,

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.606 A:middle
and to get the image
bits themselves --

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.366 A:middle
kind of wraps over where
all those images are hiding

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:07.856 A:middle
in the file system
so I don't have

00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:09.826 A:middle
to replicate that
code everywhere.

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
So I'm going to want
to be able to save

00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:15.935 A:middle
and restore a reference
to that directly.

00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:18.896 A:middle
I don't want to actually
encode the object completely

00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.316 A:middle
and make copies of it; I
just want to refer to it.

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:24.396 A:middle
And the data source doesn't
actually need to save

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:27.685 A:middle
and restore any state of its
own, but I will want to be able

00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:30.476 A:middle
to refer to it when I'm saving
state for other objects.

00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:34.006 A:middle
And something that's
kind of similar is

00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:36.306 A:middle
when you have a shared
object amongst the many view

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
controllers that
might be dynamic.

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:41.856 A:middle
So I'm going to extend the
demo that I showed you before,

00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.976 A:middle
and we're going add an
Inspector so we can set

00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:46.626 A:middle
up some effects,
some image effects.

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.426 A:middle
And here you can see that
that Inspector and the image

00:17:50.426 --> 00:17:52.026 A:middle
which is now kind of
a different color,

00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:54.016 A:middle
are sharing a filter object.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:57.446 A:middle
And this Filter object does
have some state, so it will want

00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.806 A:middle
to save and restore state,
and I'll also want to be able

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.806 A:middle
to save and restore state,
and I'll also want to be able

00:18:00.806 --> 00:18:02.286 A:middle
to maintain those references.

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:07.856 A:middle
So let's look at how our
example application has changed.

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:13.426 A:middle
So I've got a data source object
here which I just described,

00:18:13.516 --> 00:18:17.896 A:middle
and it's being referred to by
both of the view controllers.

00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:22.016 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
extend the application

00:18:22.016 --> 00:18:24.786 A:middle
and add an Inspector, so I'm
going to present something

00:18:25.266 --> 00:18:27.546 A:middle
and it's going to
use a filter object.

00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:30.706 A:middle
In fact, I might have more
than one filter object,

00:18:31.836 --> 00:18:34.406 A:middle
and they'll be referred
to for multiple places.

00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:39.056 A:middle
So what I want to focus
on here is the data source

00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:39.976 A:middle
and these filters.

00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:41.466 A:middle
These are these objects
I'm referring

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:44.056 A:middle
to as generalized
objects, and we're going

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.516 A:middle
to see how they can play
along with everything else.

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:52.426 A:middle
The first thing you need to do
if you want to use these objects

00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:54.326 A:middle
in state restoration
is register them.

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:57.876 A:middle
We've added a new
method, on UI application.

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
It's called RegisterObject
for state restoration.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
It's called RegisterObject
for state restoration.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.936 A:middle
I'm glad we have code
Complete, because that's long.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.696 A:middle
This is very similar to setting

00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.096 A:middle
up a restoration identifier
on a view controller.

00:19:14.116 --> 00:19:16.416 A:middle
You pass in the object
and you can see

00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:19.106 A:middle
that it actually implements
a new protocol, and we'll get

00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:22.606 A:middle
to that in a minute,
then you also pass us a

00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.196 A:middle
stringRestoration identifier.

00:19:24.916 --> 00:19:28.096 A:middle
Now, for view controllers and
views we made this a property,

00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:31.926 A:middle
but I didn't want to
force developers to have

00:19:32.026 --> 00:19:35.656 A:middle
to subclass a base class
that we would contrive just

00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:37.216 A:middle
so that they could
register an object.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.736 A:middle
We need to hook in,
we need to know

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:41.016 A:middle
when the object's registered.

00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:43.646 A:middle
I didn't want you to have to
subclass something and make sure

00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:46.796 A:middle
to call Super, so we felt
this was a nice clear way

00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:48.996 A:middle
to identify what's
participating.

00:19:49.086 --> 00:19:51.046 A:middle
You just call this
method with your object

00:19:51.046 --> 00:19:53.546 A:middle
and the identifier you
want, you're good to go.

00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:57.856 A:middle
So let's look at that
protocol that I mentioned.

00:19:57.856 --> 00:19:59.756 A:middle
It's called UI state restoring.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:05.226 A:middle
It has the methods to save and
restore state for that object.

00:20:05.866 --> 00:20:07.356 A:middle
These are actually optional.

00:20:07.356 --> 00:20:09.716 A:middle
There's some cases where you
won't actually need to save

00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:12.176 A:middle
and restore anything; you
just want to add the object

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:19.026 A:middle
to the graph of objects
we're keeping track of.

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.976 A:middle
We also have a property
that you can use

00:20:22.246 --> 00:20:24.286 A:middle
to scope the object's
identifier.

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.876 A:middle
Sometimes you might want
to use the same object

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.696 A:middle
or the same class of object
in more than one place,

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:33.896 A:middle
and you'll have creation
code or something that sets

00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:37.846 A:middle
up the identifier, and it would
be contrived to have to give it,

00:20:37.846 --> 00:20:39.946 A:middle
the restoration identifier
some weird name just

00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:40.996 A:middle
because of where you put it.

00:20:41.326 --> 00:20:44.286 A:middle
As an example, let's
say on an iPad,

00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:45.606 A:middle
you have an image editing app

00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:47.616 A:middle
where you can apply
two different effects.

00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:52.116 A:middle
So on the left here, you
can have one set of effects

00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:53.326 A:middle
that you're showing
on the image,

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.676 A:middle
and you might have a
different set on the right side

00:20:55.676 --> 00:20:58.586 A:middle
so the user can kind of
compare and contrast approaches.

00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:01.906 A:middle
And you might be using
the same effect objects,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:01.906 A:middle
And you might be using
the same effect objects,

00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:04.446 A:middle
or the same filter
objects, and you just want

00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:05.606 A:middle
to give them the same name.

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.376 A:middle
You can scope them by
setting their parent.

00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:11.006 A:middle
Often you'll set that
to a view controller.

00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:13.706 A:middle
You might set it to
another restorable object.

00:21:14.836 --> 00:21:16.616 A:middle
This is what we implicitly do

00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:18.336 A:middle
for the view controller
hierarchy.

00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:21.416 A:middle
We actually keep track of
the parent of an object based

00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:24.056 A:middle
on whether it was
presented, or if it's pushed

00:21:24.056 --> 00:21:26.896 A:middle
on a navigation stack or in
another collection controller

00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:30.236 A:middle
like a tab view, and here
we make it very explicit

00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:32.156 A:middle
for you to do.

00:21:32.776 --> 00:21:37.326 A:middle
Also, in some cases, the objects
may or may not exist depending

00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:38.806 A:middle
on what the user has done.

00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:41.146 A:middle
So I showed you this
beginning of the demo

00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:43.646 A:middle
and I didn't create any
filters, so there aren't any

00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:44.936 A:middle
in my examples so far.

00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:48.556 A:middle
Now, if my application
starts back up, I don't want

00:21:48.556 --> 00:21:51.046 A:middle
to create every possible
object I might have

00:21:51.086 --> 00:21:53.026 A:middle
on the off chance I
might be restoring them.

00:21:53.026 --> 00:21:56.656 A:middle
It'd be a lot nicer if somebody
kept track of that for me

00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:00.276 A:middle
and told the application, "hey,
create this because it existed

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:00.276 A:middle
and told the application, "hey,
create this because it existed

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:01.526 A:middle
when you saved state".

00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
So by specifying a restoration
class, you're telling us

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:08.576 A:middle
who we can ask to recreate
this object as needed.

00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:13.296 A:middle
And in the example
I'm showing you,

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:14.976 A:middle
all these different pieces here,

00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:18.786 A:middle
these filters are
actually created on demand,

00:22:18.926 --> 00:22:23.886 A:middle
and we'll see how
we can do that.

00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
This protocol that you use

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.816 A:middle
to create the object
is very simple.

00:22:29.216 --> 00:22:31.686 A:middle
So we've specified
a restoration Class.

00:22:32.026 --> 00:22:34.326 A:middle
When we're restoring state
and we need the object,

00:22:34.756 --> 00:22:36.086 A:middle
we call a class method,

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:39.346 A:middle
objectWithRestorationIdentifier
path,

00:22:39.346 --> 00:22:41.986 A:middle
and it gets passed
in two things.

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:45.646 A:middle
We give it an array of
identifier components.

00:22:45.856 --> 00:22:48.656 A:middle
The last component in that
array is the identifier,

00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:51.396 A:middle
and often that's all
you'll need to look at.

00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:55.286 A:middle
However, that array contains
the identifiers for all

00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:56.966 A:middle
of the restoration parents.

00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:59.906 A:middle
That way if you've scoped it
and you want to be informed

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:02.606 A:middle
about which one of these
objects we're asking for,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:02.606 A:middle
about which one of these
objects we're asking for,

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.276 A:middle
you have that information.

00:23:06.576 --> 00:23:09.556 A:middle
We also pass in the
coder that was used

00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:11.536 A:middle
when you initially
saved the object.

00:23:11.856 --> 00:23:13.566 A:middle
So why do we do that?

00:23:13.566 --> 00:23:15.196 A:middle
Why not just let you
create an object.

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.076 A:middle
Well, you're probably
going to go

00:23:17.076 --> 00:23:18.696 A:middle
through some initialization
code,

00:23:18.936 --> 00:23:22.306 A:middle
you may need some resources, and
it might be convenient to look

00:23:22.306 --> 00:23:24.096 A:middle
at a little bit of
the information

00:23:24.096 --> 00:23:27.656 A:middle
that was saved to
help inform that.

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.926 A:middle
Also, let's say that you
have a dynamic database,

00:23:30.926 --> 00:23:34.466 A:middle
and we're restoring an object
that no longer corresponds

00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:35.836 A:middle
to anything in the database.

00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:38.636 A:middle
You might have synchronized
the database or changed things

00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:40.496 A:middle
so that that object
doesn't exist.

00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:44.156 A:middle
You can look in the coder
to find out if indeed

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:47.206 A:middle
that object is still around
or not, and if it isn't,

00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:49.046 A:middle
you can just return
nill from this method.

00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:52.236 A:middle
We'll be fine; we'll just
stop paying attention to it,

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:55.186 A:middle
we won't try to restore
its state.

00:23:55.666 --> 00:23:58.126 A:middle
You return one of these
state restoring objects,

00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:01.036 A:middle
and you'll all done.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:01.036 A:middle
and you'll all done.

00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:04.656 A:middle
So now let's look at when
we launched the app before.

00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:07.246 A:middle
I mentioned when
you call application

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.626 A:middle
willFinishLaunchingwithOptions,
or rather, when we call it,

00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:13.686 A:middle
you don't have to do anything
different than you already did

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:14.936 A:middle
when the app started up.

00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:18.726 A:middle
But remember, in that method,
you're setting up the basis

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:22.126 A:middle
for your application, and if
we have a data source object

00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:24.756 A:middle
that we want to refer to,
you're probably going to have

00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:28.206 A:middle
to do something to connect that
up when you do your launch code.

00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:31.676 A:middle
And here I'm adding
one line to register it

00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:32.796 A:middle
for state restoration.

00:24:32.936 --> 00:24:36.286 A:middle
Just as I showed you before,
we've given it an identifier,

00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:40.246 A:middle
we've set up our object, and now
we know about it, we can find it

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:43.166 A:middle
if you refer to it while you're
restoring state, and when you go

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:45.876 A:middle
to save state, we'll
keep track of it for you.

00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:50.366 A:middle
So let's go back to
that segway code.

00:24:51.026 --> 00:24:54.036 A:middle
So before we even save state,
remember that we want it

00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:56.066 A:middle
to switch to this
image controller.

00:24:57.336 --> 00:24:59.236 A:middle
We're going to also hand
that image controller

00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:02.476 A:middle
to the data source as well;
that way, it knows who to ask

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:02.476 A:middle
to the data source as well;
that way, it knows who to ask

00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:06.766 A:middle
to get the actual image
file and to get the title.

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:08.176 A:middle
So here we go.

00:25:08.826 --> 00:25:10.996 A:middle
Now, we've got all the
information we need

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:13.796 A:middle
and we've got a nice shared
object that we're using

00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.476 A:middle
to keep track of everything.

00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:19.046 A:middle
So what do we do
when we save state?

00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:23.156 A:middle
Well, again, we want to
keep track of that image

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:25.976 A:middle
and the title, so we're going
to write out an identifier

00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:27.436 A:middle
for those, but we're
going to write

00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:29.866 A:middle
out an additional
thing, and what's that?

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:32.876 A:middle
Well, we want to keep
track of the data source,

00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:37.196 A:middle
so that when we restoreState, we
can get a pointer back to that

00:25:37.196 --> 00:25:39.836 A:middle
without having to do
an EndRun with globals

00:25:39.836 --> 00:25:42.036 A:middle
or doing something
contrived to try to find it.

00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:43.516 A:middle
We can just refer to it.

00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:45.686 A:middle
How do we do it?

00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:48.856 A:middle
Same way we save anything,
we'll just encode the object.

00:25:50.016 --> 00:25:51.936 A:middle
Now, we're not going
to make a copy of this,

00:25:52.086 --> 00:25:54.756 A:middle
because it's been registered for
state restoration and we know

00:25:54.756 --> 00:25:57.456 A:middle
about it and we know that
it's a state restoring object,

00:25:57.906 --> 00:25:59.906 A:middle
so we'll just save a reference.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.096 --> 00:26:02.646 A:middle
That way you don't end up with
a bunch of disjoined copies,

00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:07.616 A:middle
strewn about your application
that aren't the right thing.

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.286 A:middle
How do we restore it?

00:26:09.946 --> 00:26:12.276 A:middle
Well, you can probably guess
what's going to happen here.

00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:14.726 A:middle
We're going to pull that
data source back in.

00:26:14.726 --> 00:26:17.946 A:middle
That's going to inform
us of what image we want.

00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:20.616 A:middle
Remember, we saved and
restored the image identifier.

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:23.756 A:middle
And now we're pointing back
at that data source object

00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:26.676 A:middle
so we can use it and
everything's wired up just

00:26:26.676 --> 00:26:29.156 A:middle
as it was when the
application was last running.

00:26:29.466 --> 00:26:33.316 A:middle
So it makes it really simple
to maintain object graphs.

00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:39.046 A:middle
And again, we just use that
coder, simple little line

00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:41.606 A:middle
of code there, decode it,
and you're good to go.

00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:46.966 A:middle
Okay, I'm going to show another
demo that adds on the first

00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:48.556 A:middle
so let's take a quick look.

00:26:49.716 --> 00:26:53.616 A:middle
Okay, so here we are,
back where we were before.

00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:57.466 A:middle
Let's go back to this image,
make it a little bigger.

00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:01.966 A:middle
So let's say that we want to
put a cool sepia effect on it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:01.966 A:middle
So let's say that we want to
put a cool sepia effect on it.

00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:05.936 A:middle
So here's that Inspector --
you might recognize it from one

00:27:05.936 --> 00:27:07.226 A:middle
of my screenshots earlier --

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.906 A:middle
and I'm going to dial in
a whole bunch of sepia

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:11.986 A:middle
because I don't think you
can ever have too much.

00:27:13.016 --> 00:27:14.016 A:middle
See what it looks like.

00:27:15.566 --> 00:27:17.406 A:middle
I'm a big fan of
sepia, actually.

00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:28.066 A:middle
I think it can use
even a little more.

00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:29.576 A:middle
Yeah, I like that,
nice and gold.

00:27:29.576 --> 00:27:33.226 A:middle
And maybe I can soften
it up with some blur --

00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:34.776 A:middle
that's my other filter.

00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.006 A:middle
Not so much.

00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:43.156 A:middle
I don't really like that, so
I'm just going to turn it off,

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:44.816 A:middle
but I'm going to keep
it in my back pocket.

00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:46.326 A:middle
Maybe I can tweak
it a little more,

00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:47.816 A:middle
make it kind of nice again.

00:27:48.736 --> 00:27:51.386 A:middle
All right so let's put the
application in the background,

00:27:51.696 --> 00:27:55.006 A:middle
want to go off and do something
else, there's something exciting

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.596 A:middle
on the Internet, don't
want to miss that.

00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:02.896 A:middle
And then I usually
spend probably too long

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:02.896 A:middle
And then I usually
spend probably too long

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:05.836 A:middle
on the Internet, so the
application is exited now,

00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:07.886 A:middle
so we're going to
start it back up.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.756 A:middle
And let's hope that
it comes back.

00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:12.966 A:middle
Again, my goal here
is unexcitement.

00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:15.856 A:middle
So there it is.

00:28:16.256 --> 00:28:20.126 A:middle
Now, it remembered that we were
showing this filter inspector.

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:23.816 A:middle
It also remembered that it
was disabled and that I had

00:28:23.816 --> 00:28:27.756 A:middle
that radius set kind of
low, and it even remembered

00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:30.006 A:middle
that we'd already applied
a filter to that image.

00:28:30.486 --> 00:28:33.366 A:middle
Now, in an image editing
app, you'd probably play

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.596 A:middle
around with filters and
eventually you'd commit them

00:28:35.596 --> 00:28:37.886 A:middle
and then it would save that
information in the database,

00:28:38.246 --> 00:28:40.946 A:middle
but here I'm kind of in
an editing or playful mode

00:28:40.946 --> 00:28:42.886 A:middle
where I haven't really
committed anything;

00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:45.246 A:middle
I haven't modified this
image in the database,

00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:48.646 A:middle
so I want state restoration to
keep track of what I was doing.

00:28:48.646 --> 00:28:53.646 A:middle
So it got everything else,
too, just like it did before.

00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:57.776 A:middle
If we go back there we can see
it's got our collection view

00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:01.226 A:middle
and all that good stuff --
okay, so we got everything back,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:01.226 A:middle
and all that good stuff --
okay, so we got everything back,

00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:03.246 A:middle
no gasping, no flashing.

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:06.606 A:middle
Great. All right, what happened?

00:29:06.686 --> 00:29:08.116 A:middle
What did we actually do?

00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:11.146 A:middle
Well, just like before,

00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:13.516 A:middle
we brought back the image
and the image title.

00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:17.026 A:middle
but now we added
this new inspector.

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:20.946 A:middle
And it was presented, it was
a presented view controller,

00:29:21.336 --> 00:29:23.656 A:middle
and that just kind of came
back in the right place.

00:29:23.886 --> 00:29:24.836 A:middle
Everything was good.

00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:29.836 A:middle
And we also had two filters
and these were those new types

00:29:29.836 --> 00:29:33.146 A:middle
of objects that also get to
play with state restoration,

00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.636 A:middle
and they had a little
bit of state,

00:29:35.636 --> 00:29:37.536 A:middle
which they saved and restored.

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:41.916 A:middle
And then finally, we
actually were able to apply

00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:45.016 A:middle
that to the image, and I did
that kind of behind the scenes.

00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:48.636 A:middle
And this is interesting, because
when you do state restoration

00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:50.846 A:middle
you don't want to just have
one of those Hollywood houses

00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:52.286 A:middle
where it looks like a house

00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:54.856 A:middle
but if you ever walked inside
there's nothing behind it.

00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:58.346 A:middle
You actually want to restore
the entire structure of the app

00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:01.356 A:middle
so that it presents
kind of a continuous

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:01.356 A:middle
so that it presents
kind of a continuous

00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:03.806 A:middle
and seamless experience
when the user navigates back

00:30:04.016 --> 00:30:07.136 A:middle
to where they were, that they
don't get anything unexpected.

00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:12.386 A:middle
Now, when we initially
presented that inspector --

00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:17.086 A:middle
again, I'm using storyboards and
I did a segway -- what did I do?

00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
I created that filter object
and then when I present it,

00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:24.716 A:middle
it had that filter to refer to.

00:30:25.446 --> 00:30:27.036 A:middle
That way I could
share the filter

00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:30.736 A:middle
between both this
inspector and my image.

00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:34.126 A:middle
You may have multiple objects
that are all sharing some state.

00:30:34.456 --> 00:30:37.906 A:middle
I don't want to get two separate
filters eventually when I want

00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:41.586 A:middle
to restore state, because as
I change the settings here,

00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:43.016 A:middle
I want it to be operating

00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:45.466 A:middle
on the same filter that's
being used by the image.

00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:48.576 A:middle
By the way, again, this
is what's happening

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:51.076 A:middle
in the application before
I've even saved state.

00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:54.356 A:middle
This is the, how did I
get to where I am piece.

00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:58.366 A:middle
Now we want to save that off
so we can restore ourselves.

00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:00.046 A:middle
So what do we do?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:00.046 A:middle
So what do we do?

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:00.906 A:middle
Again,

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.526 A:middle
we use encodeRestorableState
with Coder.

00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:06.566 A:middle
We're going to want to
save, whether or not

00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:11.486 A:middle
that filter's enabled, and
also what we've got it set to.

00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:13.316 A:middle
But here's the interesting
thing.

00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:15.876 A:middle
Remember that I've got
this filter object.

00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:18.686 A:middle
Why don't we use
that to inform us

00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:21.566 A:middle
when we restore our state
rather than save it separately

00:31:21.566 --> 00:31:24.146 A:middle
in the inspector, so
all the inspector has

00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:27.256 A:middle
to save here is a reference
to this filter object.

00:31:27.956 --> 00:31:30.356 A:middle
And this filter object
itself will implement,

00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:34.776 A:middle
encode and decode, so
it will save its state.

00:31:35.256 --> 00:31:39.636 A:middle
And we had one other object that
also referred to the filter,

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.876 A:middle
and that was the
image view controller.

00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:44.956 A:middle
It'll also save a
reference to the filter,

00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:48.116 A:middle
but they're both pointing
at the same object.

00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:50.026 A:middle
So let's look at restoration.

00:31:51.806 --> 00:31:53.416 A:middle
Yes, the filter object
is shared.

00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:58.896 A:middle
So let's go through it in
a little bit more detail.

00:31:59.566 --> 00:32:01.426 A:middle
So when we wanted to save state,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.566 --> 00:32:01.426 A:middle
So when we wanted to save state,

00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:05.476 A:middle
we needed to register the filter
objects with state restoration.

00:32:05.476 --> 00:32:07.576 A:middle
I've drawn them in a big
bright blue on the side

00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:08.546 A:middle
so you can't miss them.

00:32:09.406 --> 00:32:11.406 A:middle
We need to save references
to them.

00:32:12.476 --> 00:32:15.486 A:middle
We want to save the information
that those filters have,

00:32:16.756 --> 00:32:19.336 A:middle
so what we need to do is
we need to register them.

00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:22.356 A:middle
Very simple, similar to what
we did with the data source.

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:26.936 A:middle
We're going to save a reference
from our image view controller

00:32:26.936 --> 00:32:31.206 A:middle
to those filters and also
from the sepia inspector.

00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:35.976 A:middle
And then the filters themselves
will save their own info.

00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:40.726 A:middle
That's just whether they're
enabled, what the intensity is.

00:32:41.386 --> 00:32:44.446 A:middle
Now, we're going to do
everything kind of in reverse

00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:46.446 A:middle
when we restore, so
it's very symmetrical.

00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:48.566 A:middle
But there's one other
thing we need to do

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.126 A:middle
when we're restoring state.

00:32:51.526 --> 00:32:54.136 A:middle
Remember that these filters
may not have existed;

00:32:54.266 --> 00:32:56.636 A:middle
if I hadn't used them,
they wouldn't be there,

00:32:56.636 --> 00:32:57.586 A:middle
so I wouldn't need them.

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.406 A:middle
So we're going to consult
the restoration class

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.406 A:middle
So we're going to consult
the restoration class

00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:02.386 A:middle
to restore them only
in the cases

00:33:02.386 --> 00:33:05.156 A:middle
where the user was actually
using them, when they existed

00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:06.386 A:middle
at the time we saved state.

00:33:06.716 --> 00:33:08.066 A:middle
So that's what we'll do here.

00:33:08.976 --> 00:33:10.256 A:middle
So we'll recreate them,

00:33:11.196 --> 00:33:14.566 A:middle
we'll then restore
references, here's our filters.

00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:16.956 A:middle
So we've just created
them again.

00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:21.746 A:middle
The state restoration runtime
will ask the restoration class

00:33:21.746 --> 00:33:24.416 A:middle
to create them by calling
objectWithRestoration

00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:25.136 A:middle
identifier path.

00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:27.816 A:middle
Now, you'll notice they
don't have any state yet,

00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:29.306 A:middle
so what's going to happen next?

00:33:29.786 --> 00:33:32.526 A:middle
Well, we're going to restore
our references to them,

00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:34.406 A:middle
but they still don't
have any state.

00:33:34.406 --> 00:33:37.506 A:middle
We're just going to wire them
up to our view controllers,

00:33:37.636 --> 00:33:39.826 A:middle
so we can see there I
haven't actually applied

00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:40.656 A:middle
that filter yet.

00:33:42.016 --> 00:33:45.206 A:middle
So we'll let the filter
object restore its own state

00:33:45.206 --> 00:33:46.146 A:middle
recalling decode.

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.256 A:middle
So now it's restored its state.

00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:50.146 A:middle
I don't want you
to have to worry

00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:52.566 A:middle
about what order this all
happens in, so I'm going to talk

00:33:52.566 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
about how we can leverage this
later and make it real simple

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:58.496 A:middle
to apply it so that
you then eventually get

00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:00.676 A:middle
that nice sepia look
on your picture,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:00.676 A:middle
that nice sepia look
on your picture,

00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:05.316 A:middle
and we're back to where we were.

00:34:05.966 --> 00:34:07.756 A:middle
So let's talk about
how we apply the state.

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:11.056 A:middle
The first thing we do as we're
restoring is get back our image.

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:13.755 A:middle
But we can't go and
apply that filter yet.

00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.886 A:middle
The filter might not
even exist at this point.

00:34:15.886 --> 00:34:19.485 A:middle
We're just in the decode method
for this view controller object.

00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.626 A:middle
And at some point we are
going to go grab that filter.

00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:24.886 A:middle
It'll get created, it
will restore it state.

00:34:25.176 --> 00:34:26.366 A:middle
Now we're good to go.

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.206 A:middle
Now we can apply that filter.

00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:30.456 A:middle
But when? How do we know?

00:34:31.576 --> 00:34:33.505 A:middle
So we've added a new method.

00:34:35.255 --> 00:34:37.966 A:middle
This method's for view
controllers as well as any

00:34:37.966 --> 00:34:39.565 A:middle
of the state restoring objects,

00:34:39.636 --> 00:34:42.946 A:middle
and it decouples decoding
your state from trying

00:34:42.946 --> 00:34:45.466 A:middle
to apply what might be
more of a global state

00:34:45.466 --> 00:34:46.726 A:middle
across the whole application.

00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:49.286 A:middle
It's just a simple
little method,

00:34:49.286 --> 00:34:51.716 A:middle
application finished
restoring state.

00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:53.626 A:middle
It's kind of like awakeFromNib.

00:34:53.916 --> 00:34:56.795 A:middle
It's telling you, everything
is restored at state;

00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:58.936 A:middle
everything is created
that we know about;

00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:00.246 A:middle
it's safe to go in the water.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:00.246 A:middle
it's safe to go in the water.

00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
Go on, apply your filter.

00:35:02.806 --> 00:35:07.936 A:middle
So if we didn't have this, you'd
probably have code like this.

00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:10.046 A:middle
Now, I mentioned I wasn't
going to show you much code;

00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:11.736 A:middle
this is actually the
only code slide --

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.866 A:middle
so mainly because I
like this cool effect.

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:18.716 A:middle
So the idea here is I don't
want to update the image

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.026 A:middle
when I'm decoding my state

00:35:20.026 --> 00:35:23.126 A:middle
because everything else might
not exist yet, so I'm just going

00:35:23.126 --> 00:35:25.196 A:middle
to decode my state
and not do that thing.

00:35:25.746 --> 00:35:29.266 A:middle
And then when application
FinishedResotringState is

00:35:29.266 --> 00:35:31.326 A:middle
called, I'll call updateImage.

00:35:32.246 --> 00:35:34.706 A:middle
And if you're wondering,
what's this updateImage,

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.356 A:middle
imagine I don't have
any stateRestoration.

00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:39.746 A:middle
I have a segway to
a view controller,

00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:41.526 A:middle
I tell it what image
I want it to show,

00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:43.766 A:middle
there might be some
filters that are set up.

00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:46.086 A:middle
So I'm going to write some
code that goes and fetches

00:35:46.086 --> 00:35:48.996 A:middle
that imageAppliestoFilter,
sets the title, do all of that.

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:51.356 A:middle
That's updateImage,
and if you look

00:35:51.356 --> 00:35:54.276 A:middle
at the sample code you'll see
that I'm able to just reuse

00:35:54.276 --> 00:35:58.126 A:middle
that method when the application
restores its state here,

00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:01.376 A:middle
so I don't have to go and write
a whole big bifurcated strategy

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:01.376 A:middle
so I don't have to go and write
a whole big bifurcated strategy

00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:04.776 A:middle
for restoring the image and
setting it up in this case

00:36:04.776 --> 00:36:10.126 A:middle
versus that case; got one
cute little piece of code.

00:36:10.326 --> 00:36:13.656 A:middle
So there is one area where
we got a number of questions

00:36:13.656 --> 00:36:15.276 A:middle
and they were kind
of the same question.

00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:18.886 A:middle
When do I have to
create my objects,

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.476 A:middle
and when will you
automatically find the ones I've

00:36:21.516 --> 00:36:22.476 A:middle
already created?

00:36:22.886 --> 00:36:24.386 A:middle
You have a lot of
view controllers.

00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:26.896 A:middle
You have some of these new
state resorting objects.

00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:30.966 A:middle
And some of them exist when
the application starts up;

00:36:31.336 --> 00:36:33.176 A:middle
others come into
being dynamically.

00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:35.626 A:middle
So let's look at that
in a little more detail.

00:36:36.216 --> 00:36:39.356 A:middle
So if you think of the set of
application objects you have,

00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:42.356 A:middle
I like to refer to
everything that exists

00:36:42.356 --> 00:36:45.546 A:middle
when the application is
already started as base objects.

00:36:45.966 --> 00:36:49.476 A:middle
These are loaded from a
storyboard or from various nibs.

00:36:50.076 --> 00:36:51.366 A:middle
They're created by your code

00:36:51.366 --> 00:36:53.766 A:middle
in application
WillFinishLaunchingwithOptions.

00:36:54.166 --> 00:36:55.926 A:middle
Before we do state restoration,

00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:58.416 A:middle
they're already in
play, they exist.

00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:02.116 A:middle
So if they're going to be using
state restoration and we need

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:02.116 A:middle
So if they're going to be using
state restoration and we need

00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:04.776 A:middle
to find them, you don't
have to do anything.

00:37:05.226 --> 00:37:07.256 A:middle
We'll just be able to
find them and look them

00:37:07.256 --> 00:37:09.326 A:middle
up because we've got some
magical little tables

00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:10.796 A:middle
where we keep track
of everything.

00:37:11.566 --> 00:37:14.396 A:middle
What about all the
dynamic objects?

00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:16.576 A:middle
These are presented controllers,

00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:19.626 A:middle
view controllers you might have
pushed on a navigation stack,

00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:21.706 A:middle
some of these restorable objects

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:26.056 A:middle
like those filters --
how do you get them?

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.066 A:middle
Well, if it's a view controller
and it's in a storyboard,

00:37:29.656 --> 00:37:31.826 A:middle
you actually can get
it completely for free.

00:37:32.086 --> 00:37:33.096 A:middle
We'll just find it.

00:37:33.336 --> 00:37:35.896 A:middle
That's because we know what
storyboard it came from,

00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:38.016 A:middle
we know what its
storyboard identifier was,

00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:39.516 A:middle
so we can keep track of it.

00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:42.326 A:middle
So you'll notice
when I presented some

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.156 A:middle
of those view controllers there,
I didn't show any code to have

00:37:45.226 --> 00:37:48.206 A:middle
to recreate them and represent
them; we were able to go

00:37:48.206 --> 00:37:50.646 A:middle
and hoist them out of
storyboards ourselves.

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.476 A:middle
However, if it's
not in a storyboard,

00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:56.906 A:middle
or if you want a
little bit more control,

00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:58.736 A:middle
you have to write a
little bit of code,

00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:00.946 A:middle
and that's where the
restoration class comes in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:00.946 A:middle
and that's where the
restoration class comes in.

00:38:02.276 --> 00:38:05.166 A:middle
So you can use a restoration
class for view controllers

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:08.686 A:middle
in the same way I showed you for
these new generalized objects.

00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:12.696 A:middle
And also for view
controllers, as a fallback,

00:38:13.086 --> 00:38:14.786 A:middle
we'll ask the application
delegate

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.806 A:middle
for them if all else fails.

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:19.756 A:middle
Now, if you implement
a restoration class,

00:38:20.146 --> 00:38:21.686 A:middle
that trumps everything.

00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:23.766 A:middle
That gives you control.

00:38:24.136 --> 00:38:26.766 A:middle
Let's say -- going back
to my earlier example --

00:38:27.686 --> 00:38:30.316 A:middle
maybe you have a dynamic
database with images.

00:38:30.316 --> 00:38:33.386 A:middle
These can synchronize and
images come, images go.

00:38:33.796 --> 00:38:37.486 A:middle
So if the image that was being
shown when you saved state isn't

00:38:37.486 --> 00:38:40.276 A:middle
in the database when you
restore it, you may not want

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.926 A:middle
to bring back that
view controller

00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:44.476 A:middle
and show us something
ugly like imageNotFound.

00:38:45.536 --> 00:38:47.116 A:middle
You want to just
avoid it altogether.

00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.796 A:middle
And it's always fine to
return nill when we ask

00:38:49.796 --> 00:38:50.726 A:middle
for a view controller.

00:38:50.726 --> 00:38:51.826 A:middle
We'll do the right thing.

00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:54.296 A:middle
If it was presented, we
just won't present it;

00:38:54.296 --> 00:38:56.716 A:middle
if it was pushed on
the navigation stack,

00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.106 A:middle
we'll go one back and
so on until we get

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.106 A:middle
we'll go one back and
so on until we get

00:39:00.106 --> 00:39:02.136 A:middle
to a view controller
that still exists.

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:05.896 A:middle
So we give you that control
to make sure that we don't go

00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:08.376 A:middle
and force you into
some boundary situation

00:39:08.376 --> 00:39:11.636 A:middle
where you don't have all the
assets you need that make sense.

00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:18.056 A:middle
So here's the base objects in
the example app I showed you:

00:39:18.546 --> 00:39:21.666 A:middle
the data source, that
navigation controller,

00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:23.266 A:middle
and the collection view.

00:39:23.546 --> 00:39:25.306 A:middle
They were all in
my main storyboard;

00:39:25.436 --> 00:39:27.106 A:middle
they just got created
by the time I got

00:39:27.106 --> 00:39:29.606 A:middle
into application
WillFinishLaunchingwithOptions.

00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:35.086 A:middle
And I put that Inspector in a
storyboard, so then I was able

00:39:35.086 --> 00:39:36.476 A:middle
to just completely
forget about it.

00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:37.956 A:middle
I didn't have to recreate it;

00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:40.396 A:middle
it just magically came
back, it was presented.

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:43.456 A:middle
Now, if I want a
little more control,

00:39:43.956 --> 00:39:46.796 A:middle
I can take that image
controller, and even if it's

00:39:46.796 --> 00:39:49.576 A:middle
in a storyboard I can still
give it a restoration class,

00:39:49.806 --> 00:39:52.976 A:middle
or if I was creating it out
of whole cloth, myself encode,

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:54.736 A:middle
I'd give it a restoration class.

00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:58.856 A:middle
And the filters, as we saw,
had a restoration class

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.806 A:middle
which recreated them on demand.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.806 A:middle
which recreated them on demand.

00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:03.236 A:middle
So when you think
about your objects

00:40:03.236 --> 00:40:05.596 A:middle
and which ones need
a restoration class,

00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:07.496 A:middle
which ones you'll
have to recreate

00:40:07.496 --> 00:40:08.496 A:middle
when we're restoring state,

00:40:08.836 --> 00:40:11.426 A:middle
break them up in your
mind, what's a base object.

00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:13.636 A:middle
Then you don't have
to do anything,

00:40:14.026 --> 00:40:15.656 A:middle
and of the dynamic objects,

00:40:15.926 --> 00:40:18.086 A:middle
which ones do I actually
need control of

00:40:18.086 --> 00:40:19.666 A:middle
or what am I going
to have to create?

00:40:20.186 --> 00:40:21.156 A:middle
Makes it a lot simpler.

00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:27.216 A:middle
I mentioned we did a lot
with Snapshot handling.

00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:31.136 A:middle
So in iOS 6, we wouldn't
use the Snapshot at all.

00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.946 A:middle
And that was kind of jarring,

00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:35.706 A:middle
because the application would
come up with the default PNG,

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:39.506 A:middle
restore its state and then kind
of slap you when it went back

00:40:39.506 --> 00:40:40.896 A:middle
to where it actually was.

00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:43.636 A:middle
So we're trying to be
much more aggressive now.

00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:47.106 A:middle
And we'll show the
Snapshot wherever we can.

00:40:48.106 --> 00:40:49.666 A:middle
So when we launch
an application,

00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:51.596 A:middle
if the Snapshot's available

00:40:51.596 --> 00:40:54.426 A:middle
and if we can use
it, we'll show that.

00:40:54.426 --> 00:40:56.356 A:middle
It looks much more seamless.

00:40:56.896 --> 00:40:59.806 A:middle
However, there might be cases
where you want to use it,

00:40:59.806 --> 00:41:01.426 A:middle
so we give you some control.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.806 --> 00:41:01.426 A:middle
so we give you some control.

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:02.656 A:middle
We've added a new API.

00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:06.246 A:middle
This is on UI application
and you can tell it

00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:09.166 A:middle
to ignore Snapshot
on the next launch.

00:41:09.736 --> 00:41:12.366 A:middle
You'll do this while
we're saving your state.

00:41:12.836 --> 00:41:15.846 A:middle
So if we're saving state in
one of your view controllers,

00:41:16.086 --> 00:41:19.316 A:middle
notices, this is kind of tricky.

00:41:19.796 --> 00:41:21.166 A:middle
I might not come back exactly

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:24.126 A:middle
to the same place,
ignore the Snapshot.

00:41:24.746 --> 00:41:26.116 A:middle
Then we'll use the default PNG.

00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:29.796 A:middle
That means only one of two
things will ever happen.

00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:33.896 A:middle
We'll show the same Snapshot
that we're going to launch to,

00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:37.146 A:middle
or we'll show the default
PNG, which is predictable

00:41:37.146 --> 00:41:40.206 A:middle
and at least it's somewhat
familiar, second best choice.

00:41:40.826 --> 00:41:43.936 A:middle
So why would you want us to
ignore the Snapshot, though?

00:41:44.566 --> 00:41:45.716 A:middle
Well, here's some examples.

00:41:46.506 --> 00:41:49.206 A:middle
Maybe your application is
showing a network error.

00:41:50.076 --> 00:41:52.186 A:middle
Can't get on network;
please try again later.

00:41:52.186 --> 00:41:55.306 A:middle
Click the application in
the background, it exits,

00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:58.886 A:middle
user goes to maybe a better
coffee shop with free Wi-Fi,

00:41:59.576 --> 00:42:01.136 A:middle
they start the app up again.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.576 --> 00:42:01.136 A:middle
they start the app up again.

00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:04.736 A:middle
And it would be kind of
silly for this network thing

00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:06.376 A:middle
to be showing, seeing

00:42:06.376 --> 00:42:08.916 A:middle
that there's an error
freaking the poor user out,

00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:11.046 A:middle
and then have it
just dismiss itself

00:42:11.046 --> 00:42:12.546 A:middle
or disappear when
the app started.

00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:17.616 A:middle
You also might have things
like a table view of data

00:42:17.616 --> 00:42:18.826 A:middle
that changes frequently.

00:42:19.566 --> 00:42:22.176 A:middle
Maybe you have the top
10 awesome kitten videos

00:42:22.176 --> 00:42:25.556 A:middle
of the day, something
like that, and they tend

00:42:25.556 --> 00:42:28.076 A:middle
to change pretty quickly, I
can tell you from experience.

00:42:28.396 --> 00:42:35.016 A:middle
So the application when it
starts up, you might not want

00:42:35.016 --> 00:42:37.956 A:middle
to show a list of things
that you're actually not --

00:42:37.956 --> 00:42:41.606 A:middle
eventually going to land on,
and the user's stabbing away

00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:44.216 A:middle
at this video and it doesn't
show up, so it might be better

00:42:44.566 --> 00:42:45.776 A:middle
to avoid that altogether.

00:42:47.406 --> 00:42:49.306 A:middle
There's also some implicit cases

00:42:49.306 --> 00:42:53.046 A:middle
where we'll actually detect
Snapshot wouldn't be the best

00:42:53.046 --> 00:42:55.356 A:middle
choice, so there's
a couple there.

00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:58.466 A:middle
One is, if the top most view
controller doesn't have a

00:42:58.466 --> 00:43:01.496 A:middle
restoration identifier,
we're going to assume, okay,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.466 --> 00:43:01.496 A:middle
restoration identifier,
we're going to assume, okay,

00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:02.636 A:middle
you're app's pretty awesome

00:43:02.636 --> 00:43:04.296 A:middle
and it restores state,
which is great.

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.256 A:middle
Thank you, but we can
tell that you're not going

00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:07.206 A:middle
to restore to this one.

00:43:07.616 --> 00:43:09.846 A:middle
There might be some
boundary area of the app

00:43:09.896 --> 00:43:12.556 A:middle
that users rarely go
to, setting something

00:43:12.556 --> 00:43:14.276 A:middle
up that they would
typically only do once.

00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:17.566 A:middle
That might not be a battle worth
fighting for the first release,

00:43:17.606 --> 00:43:20.846 A:middle
so you may not save the state of
that particular view controller

00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:23.426 A:middle
and you may be focusing
on more important things,

00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:25.926 A:middle
such as articles they're
reading and things like that.

00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:29.536 A:middle
So in that case, if we
detect there's no restoration

00:43:29.536 --> 00:43:31.946 A:middle
identifier, we won't show
the Snapshot; we don't want

00:43:31.946 --> 00:43:34.936 A:middle
to give the user false hope
when it's starting back up.

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:39.516 A:middle
Also, there may be some
things that we don't restore,

00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.776 A:middle
and I'll show you
an example of that.

00:43:42.216 --> 00:43:44.136 A:middle
So there's a whole
bunch of areas

00:43:44.136 --> 00:43:47.386 A:middle
where it's either inefficient
to try to restore everything

00:43:47.386 --> 00:43:49.086 A:middle
or it's just complicated enough

00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:50.696 A:middle
that we haven't gotten
to it yet.

00:43:50.696 --> 00:43:52.796 A:middle
Similar to the advice
I gave last year

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.676 A:middle
where you take an
approach where you start

00:43:54.676 --> 00:43:57.226 A:middle
with the most important
things and then add to it,

00:43:57.686 --> 00:43:59.066 A:middle
we're in the same boat.

00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:01.006 A:middle
So we don't want
to show a Snapshot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:01.006 A:middle
So we don't want
to show a Snapshot

00:44:01.006 --> 00:44:01.946 A:middle
if we know we're not going

00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:04.026 A:middle
to come exactly back
to the same place.

00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:08.596 A:middle
So I'm going to do another demo,
but this one's kind of quick,

00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:12.706 A:middle
so I'm actually going
to use a movie.

00:44:13.106 --> 00:44:15.796 A:middle
So here's our application,
we're looking at the image,

00:44:16.146 --> 00:44:18.406 A:middle
and let's say that I go
to the activity sheet.

00:44:19.676 --> 00:44:24.186 A:middle
Okay, so we actually don't share
the activity view controller

00:44:24.186 --> 00:44:27.126 A:middle
state, and there's a couple
of reasons why we don't.

00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:30.916 A:middle
Mostly, it's because the
application is handing us a

00:44:30.916 --> 00:44:31.946 A:middle
whole bunch of data.

00:44:31.946 --> 00:44:34.656 A:middle
It could have handed us a
video to mail to somebody

00:44:34.656 --> 00:44:38.666 A:middle
to really annoy them, it could
have handed us a lot of content,

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.326 A:middle
and it can often be a
[inaudible] content or something

00:44:42.326 --> 00:44:45.376 A:middle
that may not exist when the
application starts back up.

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:48.026 A:middle
So it would be both
be very costly for us

00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:52.906 A:middle
to save all this data
and it might also bite us

00:44:52.906 --> 00:44:55.026 A:middle
when we start the app back
up but we can't find it.

00:44:55.396 --> 00:44:57.366 A:middle
And it could be confusing
for the user

00:44:57.726 --> 00:44:59.626 A:middle
if they start the
application back up

00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:01.666 A:middle
and they just see this
activity view controller

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:01.666 A:middle
and they just see this
activity view controller

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.176 A:middle
and they're not really sure what
it was they were trying to share

00:45:04.176 --> 00:45:05.366 A:middle
or what they were trying to do.

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:06.906 A:middle
And you can see the
image peaking

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:07.906 A:middle
through a little bit here,

00:45:07.906 --> 00:45:09.856 A:middle
but in other cases you
might not see that.

00:45:10.656 --> 00:45:15.086 A:middle
So what do we do if we put the
application in the background

00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:17.346 A:middle
and it exits and we
start it back up?

00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:21.586 A:middle
So let's take a look.

00:45:22.146 --> 00:45:25.326 A:middle
So I did something
kind of subtle here.

00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:27.876 A:middle
It might not have jumped out
at you, so I'm going to replay

00:45:27.876 --> 00:45:29.486 A:middle
that kind of in slow motion.

00:45:29.946 --> 00:45:33.706 A:middle
So let's see the
application start back up,

00:45:34.426 --> 00:45:35.976 A:middle
now watch the transition.

00:45:36.516 --> 00:45:38.086 A:middle
See how it kind of faded in?

00:45:38.646 --> 00:45:42.426 A:middle
It's very subtle, but let's
look at it if it doesn't do it.

00:45:43.416 --> 00:45:45.136 A:middle
Starts up, boom.

00:45:45.796 --> 00:45:48.326 A:middle
Kind of jarring,
kind of disjoint.

00:45:48.566 --> 00:45:49.336 A:middle
See it again.

00:45:49.926 --> 00:45:54.156 A:middle
So that's kind of unpleasant
as a user, and let's look

00:45:54.156 --> 00:45:56.126 A:middle
at what we do regular speed.

00:45:56.766 --> 00:46:00.346 A:middle
Nice. It just kind
of fades right there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:56.766 --> 00:46:00.346 A:middle
Nice. It just kind
of fades right there.

00:46:00.646 --> 00:46:03.656 A:middle
So at least we're not
slapping the user's attention

00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:04.366 A:middle
around with this.

00:46:05.106 --> 00:46:07.726 A:middle
So that shows a few
different things.

00:46:08.176 --> 00:46:10.706 A:middle
Already in the previous
demos that I did,

00:46:10.946 --> 00:46:14.066 A:middle
you saw us using the Snapshot,
so that covers the first part.

00:46:14.116 --> 00:46:16.676 A:middle
Now when the application
starts up in restoreState,

00:46:16.826 --> 00:46:18.596 A:middle
it really does look seamless.

00:46:18.996 --> 00:46:20.416 A:middle
You might have even
thought I'm cheating

00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:23.146 A:middle
and I didn't really kill the
application but I promise I did.

00:46:23.776 --> 00:46:24.936 A:middle
And in this example,

00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:28.086 A:middle
we're showing how you
both have control,

00:46:28.086 --> 00:46:30.796 A:middle
how we'll sometimes
implicitly notice

00:46:30.796 --> 00:46:33.616 A:middle
that we shouldn't use the
Snapshot, and how we'll do kind

00:46:33.616 --> 00:46:36.706 A:middle
of a nice transition
in these cases to sort

00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:38.726 A:middle
of ease the user back in.

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:42.796 A:middle
So we've added a
few enhancements.

00:46:42.796 --> 00:46:45.046 A:middle
I'm just going to go over
them kind of briefly now.

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:49.526 A:middle
We've got some keys that are
available in every coder.

00:46:50.346 --> 00:46:52.466 A:middle
So in the initial
implementation when we came

00:46:52.466 --> 00:46:55.266 A:middle
out with this last year,
an application could look

00:46:55.266 --> 00:46:59.976 A:middle
at the bundled version that
was used when it saved state.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:00.536 --> 00:47:03.216 A:middle
So it could tell,
this old version

00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:06.046 A:middle
of the app saveState
I've changed drastically

00:47:06.046 --> 00:47:08.056 A:middle
so as I restore the
state I might have

00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:11.206 A:middle
to do some transformations,
or maybe I don't actually want

00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:13.666 A:middle
to restore state from this
very, very old version

00:47:13.666 --> 00:47:15.536 A:middle
of the app, it's just too much.

00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:18.326 A:middle
And that information
was available

00:47:18.326 --> 00:47:19.626 A:middle
in every one of the coders.

00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:22.546 A:middle
Most of your app might be
fine with this old state

00:47:22.546 --> 00:47:24.956 A:middle
but there might be one view
controller that's changed more

00:47:24.956 --> 00:47:26.476 A:middle
radically, so it
would look at this

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.036 A:middle
and say, "hey, wait a minute.

00:47:28.226 --> 00:47:31.396 A:middle
Let me see who saved this state,
our old version of the app."

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:36.226 A:middle
We've added a few new keys that
accomplish very similar things.

00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:38.466 A:middle
The first one is to tell
you the system version.

00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:43.086 A:middle
You may have noticed iOS 7
changed a little bit from iOS 6,

00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:45.656 A:middle
so your app might
need to adjust metrics

00:47:45.656 --> 00:47:47.926 A:middle
or do something different
when it's restoring state,

00:47:47.926 --> 00:47:51.146 A:middle
so you can tell what version
it ran on when it saved state.

00:47:51.876 --> 00:47:55.066 A:middle
Also, we put the time stamp
from when we saved state.

00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:58.206 A:middle
This was a very common
request, as it's so useful.

00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:02.846 A:middle
In some cases, after an app's
been inactive for awhile,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:02.846 A:middle
In some cases, after an app's
been inactive for awhile,

00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:03.876 A:middle
you might actually want

00:48:03.876 --> 00:48:05.826 A:middle
to restore something a
little bit different.

00:48:05.826 --> 00:48:07.676 A:middle
You might want to go
back up to the beginning.

00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:11.626 A:middle
Because it might be confusing
to the user if they dig way,

00:48:11.626 --> 00:48:14.146 A:middle
way down in the app
and then a month later,

00:48:14.146 --> 00:48:16.496 A:middle
when they run it again,
it goes to something

00:48:16.496 --> 00:48:18.266 A:middle
that doesn't even make
any sense anymore,

00:48:18.266 --> 00:48:19.756 A:middle
something that's
no longer relevant.

00:48:20.296 --> 00:48:23.066 A:middle
So you'll want to take
maybe a little bit of notice

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.456 A:middle
of what time or the date
that this was saved.

00:48:26.056 --> 00:48:31.266 A:middle
It made it easier to
handle static table views

00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:32.776 A:middle
where their content
doesn't change.

00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.876 A:middle
Now, because a table view
can have dynamic content,

00:48:37.406 --> 00:48:41.436 A:middle
in the first release of
this, when we saved state

00:48:41.436 --> 00:48:45.446 A:middle
and we wanted to keep track of
selected cells and the top cell

00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:46.416 A:middle
that you were scrolled to,

00:48:46.806 --> 00:48:49.666 A:middle
we would actually ask the data
source for the table view,

00:48:50.786 --> 00:48:55.176 A:middle
what is an identifier for this
cell that makes sense to you?

00:48:55.586 --> 00:48:58.696 A:middle
The reason we did that
was because the cell

00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:02.806 A:middle
at index 3 today may not be
the cell at index 3 tomorrow.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:02.806 A:middle
at index 3 today may not be
the cell at index 3 tomorrow.

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:06.286 A:middle
It may not even be the cell at
index 3 in 5 minutes or an hour.

00:49:06.906 --> 00:49:09.546 A:middle
So we don't want to just
select something based

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:12.226 A:middle
on its index path if
that data could change.

00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:15.936 A:middle
So we would ask the data source,
who knows all about the data,

00:49:16.516 --> 00:49:19.116 A:middle
to give us some identifier,
which we would save instead

00:49:19.116 --> 00:49:20.716 A:middle
of just the index path.

00:49:21.486 --> 00:49:25.826 A:middle
And when we restored state,
we would then do the converse

00:49:25.826 --> 00:49:28.866 A:middle
and say, "here's an identifier;
where's the index path now?"

00:49:29.486 --> 00:49:31.976 A:middle
And that works out great,
especially if you have something

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:36.046 A:middle
like music or photos or a set
of articles that could be moving

00:49:36.046 --> 00:49:38.286 A:middle
around and getting
sorted and changed

00:49:38.286 --> 00:49:40.096 A:middle
with things getting
deleted and added.

00:49:40.816 --> 00:49:43.426 A:middle
However, it's also pretty
common to use table view

00:49:43.646 --> 00:49:45.066 A:middle
for a static set of things,

00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:46.836 A:middle
maybe some switches
that you have.

00:49:47.266 --> 00:49:49.216 A:middle
Maybe that inspector
I have there might end

00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:50.546 A:middle
up with a fancy table view

00:49:50.546 --> 00:49:51.966 A:middle
with a whole bunch
of different items.

00:49:52.236 --> 00:49:54.196 A:middle
And it's kind of a
lot of work to have

00:49:54.196 --> 00:49:57.406 A:middle
to convert these index
paths into some identifier

00:49:57.406 --> 00:49:59.436 A:middle
that you contrive
and convert it back

00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:00.576 A:middle
when they're never
going to move.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:00.576 A:middle
when they're never
going to move.

00:50:01.326 --> 00:50:04.916 A:middle
So now, if your data source
doesn't implement the protocol

00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:08.486 A:middle
we detect to ask this
question, we'll just go

00:50:08.486 --> 00:50:10.216 A:middle
and save the index
path directly,

00:50:10.326 --> 00:50:11.536 A:middle
and it can be really useful.

00:50:12.646 --> 00:50:17.686 A:middle
And speaking of selected and
scrolled, we now added support

00:50:17.686 --> 00:50:18.886 A:middle
to UI collection view.

00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:22.196 A:middle
We'll remember all the selected
cells in a collection view

00:50:22.276 --> 00:50:23.926 A:middle
and also of the scroll position.

00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:26.056 A:middle
And you actually saw
that in the demo,

00:50:26.386 --> 00:50:27.816 A:middle
so we do that all for free.

00:50:28.616 --> 00:50:33.286 A:middle
And then finally, one thing that
can be extremely frustrating

00:50:33.286 --> 00:50:36.066 A:middle
to a user is when
they're composing mail.

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.716 A:middle
Let's say that you find
a really awesome image

00:50:38.976 --> 00:50:41.266 A:middle
or an interesting article
and you want to share it,

00:50:41.476 --> 00:50:44.126 A:middle
so you bring up the activity
sheet as I showed before,

00:50:44.446 --> 00:50:46.576 A:middle
and continue all
the way to mail.

00:50:46.806 --> 00:50:47.676 A:middle
So now you're not

00:50:47.676 --> 00:50:49.646 A:middle
in the activity view
controller anymore.

00:50:49.896 --> 00:50:52.146 A:middle
That's gone, you're now actually

00:50:52.146 --> 00:50:54.216 A:middle
in a mail composition
controller.

00:50:54.696 --> 00:50:56.546 A:middle
And you type this
elaborate message,

00:50:57.006 --> 00:50:59.836 A:middle
put the app in the background
for whatever reason, it exits,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:00.366 --> 00:51:02.506 A:middle
start it back up -- oh, no.

00:51:02.906 --> 00:51:05.786 A:middle
Gone. So we thought that
was a really important thing

00:51:05.786 --> 00:51:09.316 A:middle
to keep track of for users as
mail can be fairly lengthy.

00:51:09.446 --> 00:51:12.726 A:middle
So if you have an
activity view controller

00:51:12.726 --> 00:51:16.426 A:middle
and you give it a restoration
identifier, we'll keep track

00:51:16.426 --> 00:51:18.686 A:middle
of mail drafts and
we'll save them

00:51:18.686 --> 00:51:21.226 A:middle
and we'll bring the user
right back and restore them.

00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:25.056 A:middle
And over time we plan to
add more to this as well

00:51:25.056 --> 00:51:27.956 A:middle
so that we'll start saving more
and more specific activities,

00:51:28.116 --> 00:51:30.276 A:middle
but we thought mail was
the best place to start.

00:51:36.376 --> 00:51:40.286 A:middle
So I just want to take a moment
to talk about security and how

00:51:40.286 --> 00:51:41.956 A:middle
that relates to state
restoration.

00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:47.816 A:middle
We actually use data protection
on the archive itself.

00:51:48.676 --> 00:51:52.926 A:middle
So the state restoration archive
that's saved is not accessible

00:51:52.926 --> 00:51:54.136 A:middle
when the device is locked.

00:51:55.376 --> 00:51:58.476 A:middle
It's an encrypted file, and
if the device is locked,

00:51:58.476 --> 00:52:01.026 A:middle
even if somebody stole your
phone, managed to break

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.476 --> 00:52:01.026 A:middle
even if somebody stole your
phone, managed to break

00:52:01.026 --> 00:52:02.996 A:middle
into the file system
and pulled that off,

00:52:03.246 --> 00:52:06.476 A:middle
they wouldn't be
able to look at it.

00:52:06.476 --> 00:52:07.806 A:middle
So why do we do that?

00:52:08.256 --> 00:52:11.176 A:middle
Why is it important
to protect this file?

00:52:11.486 --> 00:52:12.716 A:middle
Well, there's a few reasons.

00:52:13.136 --> 00:52:16.906 A:middle
One is it's really easy to
leak sensitive information

00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:17.526 A:middle
by mistake.

00:52:18.746 --> 00:52:20.846 A:middle
You might keep track
of the scroll position,

00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:23.176 A:middle
which could inform somebody

00:52:23.176 --> 00:52:25.156 A:middle
who really knows what
the app's all about,

00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:28.586 A:middle
how many entries you have
and how you've been using it.

00:52:29.086 --> 00:52:31.536 A:middle
There might be identifiers
that you use for some

00:52:31.536 --> 00:52:33.656 A:middle
of your view controllers
or some of these objects

00:52:33.976 --> 00:52:36.216 A:middle
that actually give away a
little bit of information

00:52:36.216 --> 00:52:38.066 A:middle
about what a user is
doing with the app,

00:52:38.276 --> 00:52:41.136 A:middle
and for some business apps
or sensitive personal apps,

00:52:41.486 --> 00:52:43.516 A:middle
you might not want
anybody to know about this.

00:52:43.846 --> 00:52:45.786 A:middle
You might be adding
a new contact

00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:48.326 A:middle
and it's not saved
completely, but you're adding

00:52:48.326 --> 00:52:50.056 A:middle
in someone's personal
information;

00:52:50.296 --> 00:52:52.046 A:middle
you want that to
be kept private.

00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:57.576 A:middle
Also, your application already
may be keeping things private.

00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:01.746 A:middle
You may already be using data
protection for the application,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:01.746 A:middle
You may already be using data
protection for the application,

00:53:02.156 --> 00:53:04.686 A:middle
and we don't want to be the
weak link in that chain,

00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:08.616 A:middle
so we felt that it was
very important to make sure

00:53:08.616 --> 00:53:11.986 A:middle
that the state restoration
archive was protected

00:53:11.986 --> 00:53:13.796 A:middle
and that you didn't
have to worry about it.

00:53:14.006 --> 00:53:17.186 A:middle
So the action on your part,
you don't have to do anything.

00:53:17.316 --> 00:53:20.146 A:middle
You can put whatever you
want in there and not worry

00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:22.866 A:middle
about anything leaking out
because we're protecting it.

00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:26.466 A:middle
I'm going to come back to
that in a minute and see how

00:53:26.466 --> 00:53:28.136 A:middle
that relates to this topic.

00:53:29.276 --> 00:53:32.036 A:middle
So we added something
really neat on iOS 7

00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:35.096 A:middle
that allows applications
to run in the background,

00:53:36.206 --> 00:53:39.706 A:middle
and they can go and fetch assets
or do calculations or get ready

00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:40.756 A:middle
for when the user's going

00:53:40.756 --> 00:53:43.136 A:middle
to use the application,
which is pretty cool.

00:53:43.606 --> 00:53:46.396 A:middle
So if we're doing some
background operation

00:53:47.786 --> 00:53:50.796 A:middle
and the application
does state restoration,

00:53:51.016 --> 00:53:51.916 A:middle
we want to make sure

00:53:51.916 --> 00:53:53.916 A:middle
that everything comes
back predictably.

00:53:54.296 --> 00:53:55.176 A:middle
So what do we do?

00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:58.056 A:middle
So this is my application,
and let's say

00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.996 A:middle
that your application just gets
started up in the background

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.996 A:middle
that your application just gets
started up in the background

00:54:00.996 --> 00:54:03.686 A:middle
and here's my little magic wand.

00:54:04.316 --> 00:54:07.546 A:middle
So your application just
ran unbeknownst to the user,

00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:10.716 A:middle
did its thing, and since
it participates the state

00:54:10.716 --> 00:54:14.566 A:middle
restoration and since the device
unlocked, when it starts up,

00:54:14.566 --> 00:54:17.366 A:middle
we go through the standard
state restoration flow just

00:54:17.366 --> 00:54:18.356 A:middle
like we normally would.

00:54:18.686 --> 00:54:21.966 A:middle
That's because the user might
take their unlocked device

00:54:21.966 --> 00:54:24.696 A:middle
and switch over to your
application, and we'd want it

00:54:24.696 --> 00:54:27.996 A:middle
to a restored state and be back
where the user expects it to.

00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:32.716 A:middle
But what do we do if
the device is locked?

00:54:33.906 --> 00:54:36.846 A:middle
Well, we can't access that
state restoration archive,

00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:40.546 A:middle
so in this case we
take a simpler path.

00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:44.526 A:middle
We let the application get its
work done, fetch its assets,

00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:48.486 A:middle
do whatever it needs to do in
the background, but we don't try

00:54:48.486 --> 00:54:51.186 A:middle
to restore state, we won't
be able to access the file

00:54:51.186 --> 00:54:53.756 A:middle
and it will fail,
and very importantly,

00:54:54.246 --> 00:54:57.916 A:middle
when the application finishes
running in the background,

00:54:58.106 --> 00:54:59.576 A:middle
we won't clobber the state

00:54:59.616 --> 00:55:02.526 A:middle
by saving whatever
its current state is.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:59.616 --> 00:55:02.526 A:middle
by saving whatever
its current state is.

00:55:02.736 --> 00:55:06.216 A:middle
If the application is running
while the device is unlocked,

00:55:06.216 --> 00:55:07.366 A:middle
if it runs in the background,

00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:10.606 A:middle
when it completes its
background task and notifies us,

00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:12.226 A:middle
we'll save state again.

00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:14.826 A:middle
The application may have
changed its appearance,

00:55:14.826 --> 00:55:17.886 A:middle
it may have changed some of
the behavior when it did this

00:55:17.886 --> 00:55:20.746 A:middle
in the background, but
if the device is locked

00:55:20.746 --> 00:55:23.836 A:middle
and it couldn't restore state in
the first place, we're not going

00:55:23.836 --> 00:55:26.506 A:middle
to have it save state; in fact,
the app's just going to exit

00:55:26.506 --> 00:55:27.926 A:middle
after it's all done
with its work,

00:55:28.226 --> 00:55:31.896 A:middle
so that it's just getting work
done, loading those assets,

00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:34.956 A:middle
but not perturbing the user,
and when they start it back

00:55:34.956 --> 00:55:37.906 A:middle
up it'll go back to where
it was last time the device

00:55:38.216 --> 00:55:41.256 A:middle
was unlocked.

00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:45.656 A:middle
One other thing about this,
now that it's more likely

00:55:45.656 --> 00:55:48.966 A:middle
or that there's more potential
for our application to run

00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:52.936 A:middle
in the background, if you're
restoring state, keep in mind

00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:54.266 A:middle
when you start up,

00:55:54.266 --> 00:55:56.556 A:middle
the application's
data may be different

00:55:57.336 --> 00:55:59.086 A:middle
and that you might want
to take that into account.

00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:02.066 A:middle
And state restoration
is built around the idea

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:02.066 A:middle
And state restoration
is built around the idea

00:56:02.066 --> 00:56:05.426 A:middle
that you should be able to save
state and then restore it even

00:56:05.426 --> 00:56:06.936 A:middle
if all your data has changed.

00:56:06.936 --> 00:56:09.496 A:middle
Many of the things I was
describing before are

00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:10.686 A:middle
about that very thing.

00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:16.536 A:middle
But just be sensitive
and keep it in mind.

00:56:17.546 --> 00:56:20.606 A:middle
So now you've gone and
implemented state restoration,

00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:21.776 A:middle
but you want to be sure

00:56:21.776 --> 00:56:23.586 A:middle
that your application's
doing the right thing.

00:56:24.146 --> 00:56:26.086 A:middle
So do we have any tools
that can help you?

00:56:26.946 --> 00:56:30.536 A:middle
Well, one of the problems
with developing this

00:56:30.536 --> 00:56:34.736 A:middle
that you might run into, the
archive itself is fairly opaque.

00:56:34.736 --> 00:56:36.006 A:middle
It's not a text file.

00:56:36.006 --> 00:56:37.586 A:middle
You can't just go and look at.

00:56:37.906 --> 00:56:39.556 A:middle
So how do you tell
what's in there?

00:56:39.986 --> 00:56:43.506 A:middle
How can you ensure that you've
actually saved what you intended

00:56:43.506 --> 00:56:46.266 A:middle
to save and make sure
that we've kept track

00:56:46.266 --> 00:56:48.036 A:middle
of everything that you expect?

00:56:48.766 --> 00:56:52.016 A:middle
Well, we have a new tool that
we're going to make available

00:56:52.486 --> 00:56:53.996 A:middle
from our developer support.

00:56:54.396 --> 00:56:57.396 A:middle
You can run this tool and
it'll output everything that's

00:56:57.396 --> 00:56:58.106 A:middle
in the archive.

00:56:58.216 --> 00:57:00.456 A:middle
I'm just going to show
you a little bit of that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:58.216 --> 00:57:00.456 A:middle
I'm just going to show
you a little bit of that.

00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:04.466 A:middle
Kind of looks like one of those
1960s movies about computers

00:57:04.526 --> 00:57:07.876 A:middle
so very textual but
very informative.

00:57:08.406 --> 00:57:10.916 A:middle
So you're going to see a whole
bunch of stuff like this,

00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:12.556 A:middle
and this is just kind
of the top of it.

00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:16.986 A:middle
So this first tells you what
objects have restoration

00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:20.196 A:middle
classes, and that's real useful
because a common problem is

00:57:20.196 --> 00:57:23.556 A:middle
when you forget to set a
restoration class or you set one

00:57:23.556 --> 00:57:25.376 A:middle
by mistake on something
that doesn't need it

00:57:25.376 --> 00:57:26.136 A:middle
and you're wondering,

00:57:26.506 --> 00:57:28.376 A:middle
either you're not
getting any objects back

00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:30.316 A:middle
or you're getting two
for the price of one.

00:57:30.736 --> 00:57:34.066 A:middle
So right here you can look and
see everything that we expect

00:57:34.066 --> 00:57:35.626 A:middle
to use a restoration class.

00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:39.886 A:middle
Also, we just have a set
of top level information.

00:57:39.886 --> 00:57:42.456 A:middle
So I mentioned we keep
track of the bundle version.

00:57:43.016 --> 00:57:46.236 A:middle
We also have these new keys,
when did you save your state.

00:57:46.566 --> 00:57:48.826 A:middle
What was the system
version that was used

00:57:48.826 --> 00:57:49.796 A:middle
when we saved the state?

00:57:50.776 --> 00:57:54.256 A:middle
And then for all of the
objects that are participating,

00:57:54.636 --> 00:57:56.576 A:middle
we save a bunch of
information about those.

00:57:56.916 --> 00:57:58.556 A:middle
So here's our image
view controller.

00:57:59.196 --> 00:58:01.926 A:middle
So you can see on the top
there highlighted in yellow,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:59.196 --> 00:58:01.926 A:middle
So you can see on the top
there highlighted in yellow,

00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:05.336 A:middle
we tell you the type of object
it is, so you can kind of scan

00:58:05.336 --> 00:58:07.316 A:middle
down -- very quickly
looking for view controller,

00:58:07.316 --> 00:58:10.136 A:middle
view controller -- and it also
tells you the class of it,

00:58:10.416 --> 00:58:12.006 A:middle
so you can look at
it and go, "hm,

00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:13.526 A:middle
that's not the class I expected.

00:58:13.526 --> 00:58:14.476 A:middle
How did that happen?"

00:58:14.536 --> 00:58:17.056 A:middle
And you can also look
at what it saved.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:20.166 A:middle
And this stuff is very,
very straightforward, right?

00:58:20.596 --> 00:58:22.346 A:middle
We referred to our data source.

00:58:22.656 --> 00:58:25.576 A:middle
Notice it says, "object
identifier proxy."

00:58:25.776 --> 00:58:28.046 A:middle
That means this is a reference

00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:30.126 A:middle
to an object that's
also participating

00:58:30.126 --> 00:58:32.686 A:middle
in state restoration and
not an actual object.

00:58:33.446 --> 00:58:36.856 A:middle
Here, I actually put my
filters into a dictionary,

00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:40.016 A:middle
so this is just a textual
representation of a dictionary.

00:58:40.366 --> 00:58:42.536 A:middle
So the dictionary
itself was encoded

00:58:43.476 --> 00:58:46.106 A:middle
and the keys were encoded,
but you'll notice again,

00:58:46.216 --> 00:58:48.696 A:middle
we're using proxies
for the actual objects,

00:58:48.876 --> 00:58:50.496 A:middle
the filter objects
in the dictionary.

00:58:51.006 --> 00:58:54.816 A:middle
And here's the identifier
for the image as well.

00:58:55.326 --> 00:58:58.316 A:middle
So sometimes when you're
trying to diagnose issues,

00:58:58.546 --> 00:59:00.296 A:middle
you can learn quite a lot simply

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:58:58.546 --> 00:59:00.296 A:middle
you can learn quite a lot simply

00:59:00.296 --> 00:59:02.456 A:middle
by taking a look
at your archive.

00:59:02.786 --> 00:59:06.156 A:middle
And I think it's very useful
as you're building new code

00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:09.096 A:middle
and you're testing things,
to just take the time to go

00:59:09.096 --> 00:59:12.886 A:middle
through here and make sure
everything you expect is in it.

00:59:14.596 --> 00:59:16.716 A:middle
Now, I mentioned that
we can pull things

00:59:16.716 --> 00:59:18.466 A:middle
out of the storyboard
automatically.

00:59:18.886 --> 00:59:21.686 A:middle
So here I'm just showing that
we keep track of the name

00:59:21.686 --> 00:59:25.426 A:middle
of the storyboard and also what
the storyboard identifier was.

00:59:25.816 --> 00:59:27.776 A:middle
And that might be
useful to you as well,

00:59:27.776 --> 00:59:29.866 A:middle
even if you're not
depending on this behavior,

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:32.586 A:middle
just so that it helps
you to triangulate

00:59:32.586 --> 00:59:34.816 A:middle
on what this object actually is.

00:59:34.926 --> 00:59:37.116 A:middle
You're not going to have a
picture of the view controller

00:59:37.116 --> 00:59:39.386 A:middle
on the right as I'm showing
here; you're just going

00:59:39.386 --> 00:59:41.446 A:middle
to be looking at text
and you might think,

00:59:41.446 --> 00:59:42.886 A:middle
what is this thing
I'm looking at?

00:59:43.066 --> 00:59:44.766 A:middle
Oh, came out of the storyboard.

00:59:45.266 --> 00:59:45.726 A:middle
There we go.

00:59:46.496 --> 00:59:49.426 A:middle
Okay. How about these
generalized objects?

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.296 A:middle
Again, we do the same thing.

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:54.426 A:middle
We're showing that it's
just a general object,

00:59:54.426 --> 00:59:56.956 A:middle
it says restorable object
-- that's my terminology.

00:59:57.556 --> 01:00:01.036 A:middle
We show the class of it, and
it saved a couple things,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:57.556 --> 01:00:01.036 A:middle
We show the class of it, and
it saved a couple things,

01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:02.796 A:middle
so we just keep track
of all of that.

01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:06.436 A:middle
So pretty dry, but I think
it's very interesting

01:00:06.596 --> 01:00:07.646 A:middle
when you see all of this.

01:00:08.336 --> 01:00:09.996 A:middle
Okay, I'm kind of
running out of time,

01:00:09.996 --> 01:00:11.496 A:middle
but I have a couple more things.

01:00:11.876 --> 01:00:14.706 A:middle
We've added a profile
you can install

01:00:14.706 --> 01:00:17.036 A:middle
and we'll log a little
bit of extra information.

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.636 A:middle
You can also set a
default for the simulator.

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:23.576 A:middle
So you get kind of a play
by play in Xcode's console

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.916 A:middle
as your app is saving
state and restoring it,

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:28.266 A:middle
and it could be pretty
useful to look at that, too.

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:32.686 A:middle
And we have a profile that
you can install that puts you

01:00:32.686 --> 01:00:34.046 A:middle
in what I call developer mode.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:36.156 A:middle
That's what I was
using in my demo

01:00:36.156 --> 01:00:38.126 A:middle
so that I could kill
the application

01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:40.156 A:middle
without losing state
restoration.

01:00:40.546 --> 01:00:42.716 A:middle
And it's really useful
when you're chasing a bug

01:00:42.716 --> 01:00:45.426 A:middle
or you just want to check things
and you want to be able to go

01:00:45.426 --> 01:00:51.226 A:middle
on the switcher and kill it but
not actually lose the archive.

01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:53.646 A:middle
So we did a recap.

01:00:53.646 --> 01:00:55.976 A:middle
I'm hoping that if you
haven't used state restoration,

01:00:56.256 --> 01:00:59.056 A:middle
this shows you just how easy
it can be to incorporate it

01:00:59.116 --> 01:01:02.536 A:middle
in your app, and you'll go back
and you'll want to take a look

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:00:59.116 --> 01:01:02.536 A:middle
in your app, and you'll go back
and you'll want to take a look

01:01:02.536 --> 01:01:03.906 A:middle
at this and see what you can do.

01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:06.296 A:middle
And for those of you who
have already been using it

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:09.976 A:middle
and new people as well, I hope
that the new features show you

01:01:09.976 --> 01:01:11.816 A:middle
that you can also extend things

01:01:11.816 --> 01:01:13.826 A:middle
and it makes it even
easier to use.

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:16.126 A:middle
Talked a little bit
about security

01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:18.046 A:middle
and background operation.

01:01:19.196 --> 01:01:22.676 A:middle
We covered the tools that
we have, and that's it.

01:01:23.406 --> 01:01:26.056 A:middle
Jake Behrens is our
Frameworks Evangelist.

01:01:26.426 --> 01:01:27.636 A:middle
He'd love to hear from you.

01:01:28.036 --> 01:01:30.246 A:middle
We've got some great
documentation online.

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:33.696 A:middle
Of course, the forms are always
available, so talk to him

01:01:33.696 --> 01:01:35.826 A:middle
if you have a chance,
and that's it.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:36.806 A:middle
Thank you very much.
