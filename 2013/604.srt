[ Silence ]

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:10.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:16.155 A:middle
My name is Madhu Vudali, and I'm
here to introduce iAd Workbench,

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.776 A:middle
a new advertising product
for iOS developers.

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.816 A:middle
We know that many of you at
the conference are either new

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:28.276 A:middle
to advertising or
never even thought

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:29.666 A:middle
of advertising your apps.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:34.446 A:middle
So you'll briefly cover why you
should advertise your iOS apps

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:37.956 A:middle
and why you should consider
iAd for your advertising.

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:43.146 A:middle
We'll go over iAd Workbench and
my colleagues, Vineet Gossain

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:45.986 A:middle
and Mike Amirault, will do
a couple of demos for you.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.016 A:middle
So let's jump in.

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:53.306 A:middle
Say you have this beautiful
app that you had developed,

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:57.566 A:middle
your awesome app, and
it's in the App Store

00:00:58.526 --> 00:00:59.706 A:middle
and users might find it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:04.635 A:middle
If they know your app, they
might actually search for it

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:08.176 A:middle
or if your app is
featured in any

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:11.176 A:middle
of the App Store's features
like, you know, Noteworthy

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:15.336 A:middle
or Editors' Choice, they
might chance upon it.

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.116 A:middle
Perhaps your app is in
many of the app collections

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:20.446 A:middle
that the App Store has.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.536 A:middle
But consider the
fact that there are

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.956 A:middle
over 900,000 apps
in the App Store.

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.686 A:middle
And as Tim Cook pointed out
yesterday, hundred thousand

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
of those got added
just in the last year.

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:40.916 A:middle
So there's a limited opportunity
for your apps to be found

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:44.456 A:middle
in the App Store, but you
want to grow your user base.

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:48.906 A:middle
You obviously built good times
building your app and it's

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:51.386 A:middle
in the App Store you want
users for your App Store.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:52.876 A:middle
What do you do?

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:57.146 A:middle
What should you do?

00:01:57.356 --> 00:01:58.396 A:middle
You should advertise.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:04.466 A:middle
With discovery in the App
Store, users find your app.

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:07.866 A:middle
Pretty straightforward but
you're competing with lots

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.015 A:middle
of apps in the App Store.

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:13.156 A:middle
But in advertising,
you find your users.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:17.226 A:middle
You find the users that are
likely to download your app.

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:20.236 A:middle
With advertising,
you're in control.

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:24.666 A:middle
Obviously discovery in
advertising go hand and hand.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:29.186 A:middle
But again, with advertising,
you are in control

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:32.176 A:middle
in finding the users
for your app.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:36.386 A:middle
Finding the users for
whom you built the app.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.636 A:middle
There are many options for
advertising, obviously.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.796 A:middle
But we're-- you're
an iOS developer

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:49.716 A:middle
and your best option is iAd.

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:57.116 A:middle
We can find users who are likely
to download apps like yours

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.746 A:middle
because we know who
those users are.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.396 A:middle
We run the App Store.

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:04.266 A:middle
We get the data from the
App Store and iTunes.

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:07.676 A:middle
So we can find users for you.

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:13.536 A:middle
Over the last three years, iAd
has been working with hundreds

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.526 A:middle
of developers promoting
thousands of apps

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:20.046 A:middle
and driving hundreds of millions
of visits to the App Store.

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:24.756 A:middle
That's the scale and power of
iAd that we're offering you.

00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:29.866 A:middle
We are offering this new
platform for all iOS developers.

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.556 A:middle
We're calling it iAd Workbench.

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:35.876 A:middle
A do-it-yourself
campaign creation

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:37.726 A:middle
and management application

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:41.936 A:middle
with all the key features
you need for your apps.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:44.486 A:middle
So let me touch on
a couple of them.

00:03:45.386 --> 00:03:46.616 A:middle
Auction Marketplace.

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:52.096 A:middle
With Auction Marketplace
you have CPC and CPA.

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.816 A:middle
So that's cost-per-click
of your ad

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:58.046 A:middle
or cost-per-acquisition
of a user.

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:03.426 A:middle
So you can bid your CPC and
we will not charge you more

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:03.426 A:middle
So you can bid your CPC and
we will not charge you more

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:07.256 A:middle
than that, or if you know
roughly what you would pay

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:10.156 A:middle
for acquiring a user,
you can input that

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:12.936 A:middle
and we will optimize
to achieve that goal.

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:17.656 A:middle
And with audience
targeting, we have two options

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.386 A:middle
for you, Auto and Manual.

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:22.216 A:middle
So we've been operating
for the last three years

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:25.216 A:middle
and we bring you the
power of those learnings

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:29.906 A:middle
with auto targeting where we
find, or iAd Workbench finds

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:31.706 A:middle
that right users for your apps.

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:35.756 A:middle
But we also provide many
rich targeting options

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.336 A:middle
and you can use them,
you can find them

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:40.446 A:middle
through the manual
targeting that we have.

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:43.436 A:middle
Third thing I want
touch on is ad banners.

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:46.346 A:middle
You need creators for your ads.

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:50.276 A:middle
If you're working with
the creative agency

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:51.816 A:middle
or you have in-house expertise

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:54.566 A:middle
to develop Ad Creative,
you can upload them.

00:04:55.076 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
Or you can use many of the
Apple design beautiful templates

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:55.076 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
Or you can use many of the
Apple design beautiful templates

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:02.326 A:middle
for your ads.

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:04.756 A:middle
So, all the key features

00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:07.856 A:middle
for your app promotions
are all here.

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
We launched this app yesterday,
this iAd Workbench at apple.com

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.606 A:middle
and already thousands

00:05:16.606 --> 00:05:18.886 A:middle
of iOS developers have
already started using.

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:22.516 A:middle
Before we go into the
details of iAd Workbench,

00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:26.576 A:middle
I want Vineet Gossain to give
you a quick demo of the app.

00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:28.176 A:middle
Vineet?

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:29.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks Madhu.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:32.476 A:middle
Now, as Madhu mentioned, I know
a lot of you guys are brand new

00:05:32.476 --> 00:05:35.096 A:middle
to advertising, so I want
to show you guys how quickly

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:37.436 A:middle
and easily you can create
a new ad campaign using the

00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:38.126 A:middle
iAd Workbench.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:39.506 A:middle
It only takes a few minutes.

00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:41.996 A:middle
For those of you who are more
experienced in advertising,

00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:43.796 A:middle
I'll be back later to
give the demo of some

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:44.976 A:middle
of the more powerful features

00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:46.406 A:middle
that are offered
by iAd Workbench.

00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:49.646 A:middle
Let's start with a quick
demo of creating a campaign.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:52.096 A:middle
So this is your Dashboard

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:53.876 A:middle
when you first logged
in to iAd Workbench.

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:55.876 A:middle
We'll click on Create Campaign.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.816 A:middle
And the very first thing you
need to do is you need to choose

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:01.356 A:middle
which app you want to promote.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:01.356 A:middle
which app you want to promote.

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:02.916 A:middle
All of your Apps are here.

00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:05.546 A:middle
Let's choose Clara [phonetic]
our productivity app.

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:07.366 A:middle
You give it a campaign name,

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:11.616 A:middle
Clara Summer Promotion,
and hit Next.

00:06:13.016 --> 00:06:13.936 A:middle
Oops, already exists.

00:06:14.456 --> 00:06:16.616 A:middle
OK, Campaign Summer Promotion 2.

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.666 A:middle
That one does also exist.

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:22.456 A:middle
OK, sorry.

00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:23.976 A:middle
Couple of test runs [laughter].

00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:27.086 A:middle
OK, so the next thing you
need to do is you need

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:27.996 A:middle
to find your audience.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.056 A:middle
As Madhu mentioned,
we have two options,

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.276 A:middle
the Auto option, or
the Manual option.

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.996 A:middle
If you choose Manual, you get
several different targeting

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:40.736 A:middle
categories such as device,
gender, age, if you know exactly

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:42.026 A:middle
which user you want to target.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:45.126 A:middle
But for most of you,
your best bet is Auto.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:47.756 A:middle
For Auto, iAd will
automatically figure

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:50.016 A:middle
out who are the best
users to show your ad

00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
to at the right time
to maximize downloads.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:57.056 A:middle
For this campaign, we'll
choose Auto as well.

00:06:57.786 --> 00:06:59.366 A:middle
The next option is
your Flight Dates.

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:01.116 A:middle
Basically, when your want
your campaign to run,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:01.116 A:middle
Basically, when your want
your campaign to run,

00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:04.126 A:middle
you can time your campaign to
run with the specific promotion

00:07:04.126 --> 00:07:06.976 A:middle
or specific holiday, or you
can just have it start today.

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:09.066 A:middle
For this demo, let's
just have it start today.

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
The final piece is entering
your campaign budget.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:15.076 A:middle
For the budget, that's basically
how much you want to spend

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.816 A:middle
on this campaign over
the life of the campaign.

00:07:18.986 --> 00:07:20.926 A:middle
For this demo, we
use 2,500 dollars.

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:24.206 A:middle
But you can go as low as 50.

00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:25.676 A:middle
You can choose the
Daily Spend Goal,

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:28.206 A:middle
if you want to limit how much
you're spending on a daily basis

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:29.386 A:middle
but that field is optional.

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:30.926 A:middle
We'll stick with
the pre-calculation

00:07:31.096 --> 00:07:32.516 A:middle
which evenly spends the budget

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:34.556 A:middle
across the duration
of the campaign.

00:07:35.256 --> 00:07:38.406 A:middle
And then the final option is how
you want to pay for your ads.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.316 A:middle
You have two options
as Madhu mentioned,

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:42.686 A:middle
CPA or cost-per-acquisition,

00:07:42.986 --> 00:07:44.416 A:middle
basically how much
you're willing to pay

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.336 A:middle
for each additional
download of your app.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.616 A:middle
Your other option, CPC,

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:52.386 A:middle
or cost-per-click is basically
you've given us the maximum

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:56.636 A:middle
you're willing to pay for
each click on one of your ads.

00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:59.146 A:middle
Let's stick with CPA and
we'll put in 2 dollars

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
and 50 cents as a CPA goal.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
and 50 cents as a CPA goal.

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:02.626 A:middle
You can hit this
Calculate button

00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:05.836 A:middle
and what we'll do is we'll do
an estimate and give an estimate

00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:08.596 A:middle
of how many expected
impressions or number

00:08:08.596 --> 00:08:10.726 A:middle
of times your ad will
appear in front of users.

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:14.406 A:middle
The expected number of taps, how
many taps you can expect people

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:16.556 A:middle
to actually have clicked
on your ad and roughly

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:18.076 A:middle
about how many downloads
you can expect

00:08:18.416 --> 00:08:19.986 A:middle
to result from this campaign.

00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:23.036 A:middle
You can go in and tweak
these numbers if you--

00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:26.076 A:middle
you can go in and tweak the
budget numbers or the CPA goal

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:28.166 A:middle
if you feel you want
to get more downloads.

00:08:28.226 --> 00:08:29.466 A:middle
But let's just stick
for this for now.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:33.366 A:middle
We hit Next, and then the
next piece is you have

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:36.405 A:middle
to choose the artwork that you
wish to show to the end users

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:37.466 A:middle
as part of your campaign.

00:08:38.736 --> 00:08:39.596 A:middle
We have two options.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.186 A:middle
You can upload your own where
all you need to do is you need

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:45.856 A:middle
to provide the various artwork
for the devices that you wish

00:08:45.856 --> 00:08:48.536 A:middle
to target, or you have
the option of using one

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:49.966 A:middle
of our Apple design templates.

00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:51.576 A:middle
Now, each of our templates,

00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:55.256 A:middle
we have five different templates
each with multiple color schemes

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.566 A:middle
and each of them is animated.

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
For this campaign,
let's use a JetSet.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:05.056 A:middle
For each template, you provide
three things, the title, Clara;

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:12.616 A:middle
the message, getting things done
faster; and a call to action.

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:15.576 A:middle
We'll do download now.

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:18.956 A:middle
You can replay the animation,
so you can see what it will look

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:22.546 A:middle
like to the end users and you
enter in everything just once

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:25.156 A:middle
and we'll automatically
create the templates for each

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:28.256 A:middle
of the devices that
you wish to target.

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:31.726 A:middle
So, in this case we created
both iPhone and iPad banners.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:35.826 A:middle
If we're happy with that
we give it a banner name,

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:40.606 A:middle
Clara JetSet, and hit Next.

00:09:41.216 --> 00:09:46.426 A:middle
And now, the final piece
is the Banner Summary.

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.286 A:middle
On the Banner Summary,
you can choose

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:50.786 A:middle
to create additional banners if
you so desire in case you want

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:52.876 A:middle
to compare how one banner
does against another.

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:55.696 A:middle
But for this demo, we'll stick
with just a single banner.

00:09:56.326 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
Now, the final step is
the Campaign Summary.

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.986 A:middle
Within the Campaign Summary,
this is your final review,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.986 A:middle
Within the Campaign Summary,
this is your final review,

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:01.956 A:middle
make sure everything is OK.

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:06.246 A:middle
Confirm your budget, 2,500
dollars, our CPA goal

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:08.816 A:middle
of 2 dollars and 50
cents, our Clara banner,

00:10:10.336 --> 00:10:12.186 A:middle
we hit Submit and you're done.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:14.856 A:middle
Since it's-- there you go.

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:17.016 A:middle
So, your campaign is
created and quick and easy,

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:17.946 A:middle
and you're ready to go.

00:10:17.946 --> 00:10:18.596 A:middle
Back to you Madhu.

00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:21.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:23.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:27.276 A:middle
Thank you Vineet.

00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:30.736 A:middle
I was certainly timing him
and it was about five minutes

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:32.286 A:middle
and that's the fastest
he's done.

00:10:32.286 --> 00:10:33.666 A:middle
So that's a new record Vineet.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:38.146 A:middle
So, let's go into an
overview of iAd Workbench.

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:41.166 A:middle
So, we want to cover
three topics: one,

00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:44.906 A:middle
how you can get started; two,
how you can create campaigns;

00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:48.386 A:middle
and three, how you can manage
the performance of the campaigns

00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:50.646 A:middle
that you have created.

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:51.366 A:middle
Getting started.

00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:53.496 A:middle
Getting started is very easy.

00:10:53.906 --> 00:10:56.436 A:middle
You log in, you sign up
and setup your payment.

00:10:57.286 --> 00:10:59.486 A:middle
Log-in with your
developer credentials.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:03.036 A:middle
Sign up to the terms and
conditions of iAd Workbench

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:05.136 A:middle
with a new service from Apple

00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:07.516 A:middle
and you just have a different
terms and conditions,

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:09.506 A:middle
and you setup your payment.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:11.266 A:middle
We accept major credit cards

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
or you can also apply
for a line of credit.

00:11:15.156 --> 00:11:17.046 A:middle
You're done with your sign up.

00:11:18.776 --> 00:11:20.646 A:middle
Next, you create Campaigns.

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:25.556 A:middle
Vineet went through a
fairly quick campaign

00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:26.886 A:middle
creations process.

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:29.366 A:middle
Let's go a little deeper
in each of these steps.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.066 A:middle
Selecting an app.

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:35.086 A:middle
So every campaign is
anchored around an app

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:36.526 A:middle
because that's what's
your promoting.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.446 A:middle
So, when you sign
up as a developer,

00:11:39.746 --> 00:11:41.446 A:middle
all your apps are already here.

00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.756 A:middle
So, you pick the app
you want to promote,

00:11:43.756 --> 00:11:47.086 A:middle
and you give your campaign
a name and you hit Next.

00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:49.306 A:middle
So, your campaign is
essentially the first step

00:11:49.306 --> 00:11:52.136 A:middle
of your campaign
creation is done.

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:54.386 A:middle
Next step is selecting
an audience.

00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:59.746 A:middle
In the demo that we saw, we have
two options, Auto and Manual.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:03.836 A:middle
With auto you get the
optimized audience selection

00:12:03.836 --> 00:12:04.916 A:middle
from iAd Workbench.

00:12:05.136 --> 00:12:06.026 A:middle
What do we mean by that?

00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:09.266 A:middle
It means that iAd Workbench
finds the right user

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:13.196 A:middle
at the right time, on the
right device in the right app

00:12:13.506 --> 00:12:15.276 A:middle
to maximize the downloads
for you.

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.656 A:middle
Recall that I mentioned
that we've been operating

00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:20.126 A:middle
for over three years,
you're really benefiting

00:12:20.126 --> 00:12:22.776 A:middle
from those learnings when
you choose this option.

00:12:24.236 --> 00:12:27.566 A:middle
The other option is the
manual targeting option.

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:31.166 A:middle
In this case iAd Workbench
provides you the targeting

00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:33.976 A:middle
options and you picked
what's best for you.

00:12:34.506 --> 00:12:37.956 A:middle
You still get the benefit
of the optimization except

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:39.266 A:middle
that you've given

00:12:39.266 --> 00:12:41.296 A:middle
as the starting point
for the optimization.

00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:45.706 A:middle
Let's drill into what
are the various manual

00:12:45.706 --> 00:12:46.676 A:middle
targeting options.

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:50.996 A:middle
On the left hand side are the
various basic targeting options.

00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:55.756 A:middle
So gender, age, various age
buckets, geotargeting state

00:12:55.756 --> 00:12:58.326 A:middle
in DMA for now, and
day of week targeting.

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.036 A:middle
These are basic options
for advertising.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.036 A:middle
These are basic options
for advertising.

00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:03.586 A:middle
On the right hand
side, you can--

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.096 A:middle
you start with device targeting,

00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:08.376 A:middle
you can target all the iOS
devices that Apple makes.

00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:12.406 A:middle
So iPhone, iPod and
iPad and iPod touch.

00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:16.256 A:middle
Next I want to drill I little
bit into user preferences.

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.976 A:middle
This is one of the most powerful
features that we provide you.

00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:25.206 A:middle
So at user preferences,
you target users based

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:29.206 A:middle
on what they download in
iTunes and the App Store.

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:33.996 A:middle
So at the top here, hope you
can read that, you have apps,

00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:37.086 A:middle
movies, music, books and so on.

00:13:37.726 --> 00:13:41.006 A:middle
So what does this showing
you is what-- if you tar--

00:13:41.056 --> 00:13:44.336 A:middle
choose this option, you're
targeting users based

00:13:44.336 --> 00:13:46.306 A:middle
on what they download
in the App Store.

00:13:46.566 --> 00:13:50.226 A:middle
Actual downloads, not just
likes, actual downloads.

00:13:50.506 --> 00:13:51.186 A:middle
Think about that.

00:13:51.806 --> 00:13:55.646 A:middle
If you're a game
developer and you want

00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:59.096 A:middle
to reach users who've
already downloaded games

00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:02.056 A:middle
and shown preference for
games, you can do that here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:02.056 A:middle
and shown preference for
games, you can do that here.

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:07.216 A:middle
Or let's say your game
appeals to action movie fans,

00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:10.766 A:middle
you can combine that
with a movie preference

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:11.786 A:middle
for action movies.

00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:13.776 A:middle
That's the power you're getting.

00:14:14.096 --> 00:14:18.186 A:middle
We're using the data from
iTunes as well as the App Store

00:14:18.366 --> 00:14:21.546 A:middle
to find the right
user for your apps.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.816 A:middle
For example app Clara,
which is a productivity app,

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:28.276 A:middle
we're just choosing
business, finance,

00:14:29.096 --> 00:14:30.346 A:middle
productivity and utilities.

00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:33.136 A:middle
The next preference,

00:14:33.136 --> 00:14:35.246 A:middle
next targeting option
is app channels.

00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:37.346 A:middle
Here you're asking the question,

00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:39.566 A:middle
where do you want
your ad to run?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.326 A:middle
What you see here is the
taxonomy in the App Store.

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:47.356 A:middle
You're determining, what's
the context for your ad?

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:51.046 A:middle
You can browse the App Store
and see what this context mean.

00:14:51.276 --> 00:14:54.036 A:middle
So when you when you
choose these options,

00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:57.156 A:middle
you're determining, or you're
deciding what's the most

00:14:57.156 --> 00:14:59.376 A:middle
relevant context for your ads?

00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:02.076 A:middle
For Clara, which is
a productivity app

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:02.076 A:middle
For Clara, which is
a productivity app

00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:04.726 A:middle
and fairly broad
based, we've chosen most

00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:06.796 A:middle
of the app channels
that we have here.

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:10.946 A:middle
Your app may not me relevant
in all of these channels,

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:12.896 A:middle
so that's a decision
that you need to make.

00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:14.976 A:middle
The more channels you pick,

00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.686 A:middle
the greater the reach
for your campaign.

00:15:18.116 --> 00:15:21.946 A:middle
The last option we
offered you is upgrading.

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:26.406 A:middle
Some of you might have apps that
are not necessarily appropriate

00:15:26.406 --> 00:15:28.626 A:middle
in context that are 17 plus.

00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:30.106 A:middle
So, you can with the fair--

00:15:30.106 --> 00:15:33.366 A:middle
with the simple filter
you can exclude apps

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.886 A:middle
that are 17 plus
from your campaigns.

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:40.606 A:middle
So these are the targeting
options that we have

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:44.296 A:middle
under manual targeting,
and the burden is on you

00:15:44.296 --> 00:15:45.836 A:middle
to pick what's best for you.

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:50.626 A:middle
You always, obviously, have the
optimization that comes with it.

00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:53.066 A:middle
But you can also
pick the Auto Option

00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:56.176 A:middle
where iAd Workbench does
the heavy lifting for you

00:15:56.416 --> 00:15:59.086 A:middle
to find the right
users for your app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:06.776 A:middle
So two steps down, the third
step is to set a budget.

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:09.546 A:middle
You're answering three
questions, how long do you want

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:11.766 A:middle
to run your campaign,
how much do you want

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:14.096 A:middle
to spend and at what price?

00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:19.756 A:middle
How long? So you're essentially
determining what the start date

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:20.836 A:middle
and end date of a campaign.

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:23.236 A:middle
You need to set the
duration of your campaign.

00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:26.306 A:middle
By default a campaign
starts today.

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:29.776 A:middle
But you can pick any date
range that is relevant to you.

00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:33.366 A:middle
Maybe you're launching an update
for your product or your app.

00:16:33.766 --> 00:16:34.936 A:middle
You can pick a date for that.

00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:38.426 A:middle
Or perhaps you want to
coincide with back to school

00:16:38.426 --> 00:16:39.966 A:middle
or Black Friday, whatever.

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:42.216 A:middle
You can choose these
options from here.

00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:46.156 A:middle
The next question you're
answering is how much?

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:49.636 A:middle
You're setting a budget
and a daily spend goal.

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:51.666 A:middle
A budget is what
you're willing to spend

00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:53.136 A:middle
for the entire campaign.

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.586 A:middle
And the daily spend
goal is a way for you

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:59.756 A:middle
to control the pacing of your
campaign during the entire

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.266 A:middle
campaign-- for the duration
of the campaign, sorry.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.266 A:middle
campaign-- for the duration
of the campaign, sorry.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:07.016 A:middle
And now we're answering
the question what price?

00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:10.445 A:middle
Two options that we mentioned
before, cost-per-click

00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:14.296 A:middle
where you're inputting the
maximum that you're willing

00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:17.286 A:middle
to pay for a click, so
when there's somebody taps

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.915 A:middle
on your ad, that's the
maximum you're willing to pay.

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:23.376 A:middle
We will not charge you more
than that, that's your bid.

00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:27.336 A:middle
Or you can indicate a
cost-per-acquisition goal,

00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:28.236 A:middle
a CPA goal.

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:33.586 A:middle
Here you have a rough idea as to
what you are be willing to pay

00:17:33.876 --> 00:17:37.226 A:middle
to acquire in the user, or for
download from the App Store.

00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:41.776 A:middle
You input that in iAd Workbench
optimizes to that goal.

00:17:42.076 --> 00:17:44.806 A:middle
So you have CPA and CPC
that you can choose.

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.586 A:middle
Now you've answered
all three questions

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:50.986 A:middle
and we've provide you
three answers there.

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:55.026 A:middle
We provide you the impressions,
the taps, and the downloads,

00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:57.426 A:middle
as an estimate for
all your settings.

00:17:57.636 --> 00:18:01.316 A:middle
So the targeting that
you've chosen, the duration

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.636 --> 00:18:01.316 A:middle
So the targeting that
you've chosen, the duration

00:18:01.316 --> 00:18:03.366 A:middle
that you've chosen, the
budget that you've chosen,

00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:05.816 A:middle
and your bid all determine
these three numbers.

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:09.466 A:middle
We also have a nifty
gauge next to the numbers.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.906 A:middle
The numbers, the gauge
essentially indicates the

00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:15.946 A:middle
numbers or your settings
in the context

00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:17.596 A:middle
of what's available overall.

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:21.376 A:middle
In this case, the needle is all
the way to the left telling me

00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:24.096 A:middle
that if I had more budget,
meaning if I had more

00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:25.686 A:middle
than 10,000 dollars to spend,

00:18:26.036 --> 00:18:29.386 A:middle
I could substantially increase
the number of users for my app.

00:18:30.116 --> 00:18:34.016 A:middle
But you-- for now, this
is what you get, OK?

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:37.126 A:middle
So, three steps down, last step

00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:39.116 A:middle
or the first step
is adding banners.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.976 A:middle
As Vineet pointed out,
you can upload banners.

00:18:43.636 --> 00:18:47.866 A:middle
So if you're-- if you
work with creative agency

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:51.006 A:middle
or you have in-house
expertise to create banners,

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.186 A:middle
you can upload them
for all the devices

00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:55.766 A:middle
that you're targeting,
and you're all set.

00:18:56.356 --> 00:19:01.326 A:middle
But many of you might not have
access to creative agencies

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:56.356 --> 00:19:01.326 A:middle
But many of you might not have
access to creative agencies

00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:03.666 A:middle
and may not want to spend
even for all of that.

00:19:04.246 --> 00:19:06.956 A:middle
You get the benefit of
Apple designed beautiful

00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:07.826 A:middle
templates here.

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:10.756 A:middle
The templates have
been designed to ensure

00:19:10.756 --> 00:19:13.436 A:middle
that your app is
highlighted in the banners.

00:19:13.766 --> 00:19:17.696 A:middle
So we have five templates,
each with five colors.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:23.116 A:middle
So you pick a template,
you give it a title,

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:29.026 A:middle
you give it a message, and
you give it a call to action.

00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:31.966 A:middle
So all-- basically three
things that you need to do

00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:34.406 A:middle
for your banner and we
take care of the rest.

00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:38.316 A:middle
As Vineet pointed out you
can see a quick preview

00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:41.776 A:middle
of the various sizes
that you're getting

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.826 A:middle
from the one banner
that you selected.

00:19:44.506 --> 00:19:46.816 A:middle
These are the various sizes
and the various devices

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.026 A:middle
that you're targeting.

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:51.416 A:middle
If you want to see
how the ads look,

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:55.466 A:middle
appear on the actual devices,
you can send an email directly

00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:58.516 A:middle
from the application,
and using iAd Tester,

00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
you can see how your ad
appears on the devices.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
you can see how your ad
appears on the devices.

00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:01.836 A:middle
Pretty powerful.

00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:08.206 A:middle
Last step is submitting
the campaign.

00:20:09.696 --> 00:20:12.966 A:middle
You get on a single page all
the options that you've chosen.

00:20:13.166 --> 00:20:15.866 A:middle
You obviously see the app,
the name of the campaign

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.076 A:middle
that you created, the
various targeting option

00:20:18.076 --> 00:20:20.376 A:middle
that you've chosen, as
well as the banners.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.086 A:middle
When you hit Submit,
your campaign goes

00:20:24.086 --> 00:20:26.176 A:middle
into the creative
approval process at Apple.

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:29.786 A:middle
So that's campaign creation.

00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:34.206 A:middle
Now when you create campaigns,
obviously you're interested

00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:36.956 A:middle
in understanding how
they're performing

00:20:37.026 --> 00:20:39.226 A:middle
in the App Store,
in our marketplace.

00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:43.336 A:middle
You want to understand how
many downloads you're getting.

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:46.226 A:middle
You're spending good money
to acquire those downloads,

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:49.606 A:middle
and you perhaps have chosen
various targeting options

00:20:49.976 --> 00:20:53.766 A:middle
or various banner for your
app, for your campaigns,

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:54.756 A:middle
and you really want

00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:56.556 A:middle
to understand the
performance of that.

00:20:56.816 --> 00:21:00.506 A:middle
So we provide you a
Dashboard and drill downs.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:56.816 --> 00:21:00.506 A:middle
So we provide you a
Dashboard and drill downs.

00:21:01.016 --> 00:21:05.366 A:middle
Dashboard gives you, on the
left hand side, a quick view

00:21:05.616 --> 00:21:09.406 A:middle
of what's going on in your
application for all your apps.

00:21:09.656 --> 00:21:12.886 A:middle
So you can see all the
apps and the campaigns

00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:14.786 A:middle
that you've created
for those apps.

00:21:15.536 --> 00:21:17.476 A:middle
You have, at a quick glance,

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:20.406 A:middle
understand how those
various campaigns are doing.

00:21:20.806 --> 00:21:23.646 A:middle
You can initiate a new
campaign as Vineet did from--

00:21:23.646 --> 00:21:24.876 A:middle
directly from the Dashboard.

00:21:25.706 --> 00:21:27.686 A:middle
On the right hand side,
you have drill downs.

00:21:28.136 --> 00:21:30.446 A:middle
Again, you get granular
reporting

00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:32.386 A:middle
for all the options
that you've chosen.

00:21:33.106 --> 00:21:35.816 A:middle
You have the various targeting
options that you've chosen.

00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:37.276 A:middle
You have also the
various banners

00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:39.206 A:middle
that you've created
for your campaign.

00:21:39.546 --> 00:21:43.776 A:middle
You can do understand how these
two perhaps targeting options

00:21:44.016 --> 00:21:44.766 A:middle
are performing.

00:21:45.296 --> 00:21:47.186 A:middle
Or you could also
trend them overtime.

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:51.976 A:middle
Lots of rich data
comparison tools as well

00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:55.536 A:middle
as insightful visuals for
you on the drill downs.

00:21:56.646 --> 00:21:59.516 A:middle
Rather than me talk about it,
let's have Vineet come back

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:01.906 A:middle
and give us a demo of
managing performance.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:01.906 A:middle
and give us a demo of
managing performance.

00:22:02.306 --> 00:22:02.776 A:middle
Vineet?

00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:04.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks Madhu.

00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.836 A:middle
So yeah, now we've
created our campaign.

00:22:07.266 --> 00:22:09.596 A:middle
But now the question
is, how do you ensure

00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:11.456 A:middle
that your campaign is
doing as well as it could?

00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:13.826 A:middle
How do you ensure you're
maximizing your downloads?

00:22:14.226 --> 00:22:16.386 A:middle
Let's go to the Dashboard.

00:22:16.716 --> 00:22:19.306 A:middle
On the Dashboard, you see
the list of the campaigns

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:20.056 A:middle
that are currently running.

00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:22.186 A:middle
So we have three campaigns
that are currently running.

00:22:22.706 --> 00:22:24.666 A:middle
And within each of
the campaigns,

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:26.466 A:middle
you see four key metrics.

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:29.606 A:middle
The total amount you spent
so far on this campaign

00:22:29.866 --> 00:22:31.146 A:middle
and you can see how
that compares

00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:32.196 A:middle
to the budget that you set.

00:22:33.026 --> 00:22:35.736 A:middle
The average CPA, again, that
was cost-per-acquisition,

00:22:36.026 --> 00:22:37.346 A:middle
how much you're paying
on average

00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:38.566 A:middle
for each additional download?

00:22:38.866 --> 00:22:41.236 A:middle
You can compare that to the
goal that you set as well.

00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:44.726 A:middle
Average CPC, the actual cost,

00:22:44.726 --> 00:22:47.726 A:middle
you're paying per-click
on your ad.

00:22:47.726 --> 00:22:50.666 A:middle
And if you would set a CPC
bid, you would see it here

00:22:50.666 --> 00:22:51.896 A:middle
so you could do a
comparison as well.

00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:54.236 A:middle
And finally, probably the
metric you guys care most

00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:56.706 A:middle
about the total number of
downloads that have resulted

00:22:56.706 --> 00:22:57.736 A:middle
from your ad campaign.

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.616 A:middle
So from the Dashboard,
you can quickly drill in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.616 A:middle
So from the Dashboard,
you can quickly drill in.

00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:04.376 A:middle
Let's take a look at
this campaign and see

00:23:04.576 --> 00:23:06.876 A:middle
and get a refresher of what
exactly this campaign is

00:23:06.876 --> 00:23:07.276 A:middle
all about.

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:10.576 A:middle
So for this campaign,
we have multiple lines.

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.306 A:middle
So we haven't talked
about lines yet.

00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:15.156 A:middle
Basically a line is a
set of targeting options.

00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:19.166 A:middle
Madhu went over that various
targeting options, gender, age,

00:23:19.446 --> 00:23:20.636 A:middle
user preference et cetera.

00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:23.216 A:middle
What you can do is you can
group those options together

00:23:23.216 --> 00:23:24.326 A:middle
into a single line.

00:23:24.776 --> 00:23:28.876 A:middle
You could call it, men 18 to
24 or some other combination.

00:23:29.226 --> 00:23:32.476 A:middle
And for each line, you can
set an independent budget,

00:23:33.426 --> 00:23:36.616 A:middle
independent daily spend goal,
and an independent CPA goal

00:23:36.716 --> 00:23:40.686 A:middle
so you can track how one line
is doing against another to see,

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:42.146 A:middle
what is your target market?

00:23:42.696 --> 00:23:47.206 A:middle
And you can quickly flip
through multiple lines

00:23:47.286 --> 00:23:49.116 A:middle
to see all the different
settings that you have.

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:52.536 A:middle
So we have men 35
to 49, men 50 plus.

00:23:52.536 --> 00:23:54.346 A:middle
So right now, we're
breaking it down based

00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:56.026 A:middle
on gender and age range.

00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:59.736 A:middle
In addition, you can
see all of the banners

00:23:59.736 --> 00:24:01.366 A:middle
that you have associated
with your campaign.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.736 --> 00:24:01.366 A:middle
that you have associated
with your campaign.

00:24:02.036 --> 00:24:03.336 A:middle
We have multiple banners

00:24:03.576 --> 00:24:05.336 A:middle
and using multiple
different templates to see

00:24:05.336 --> 00:24:06.516 A:middle
which one performs the best.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
And you can see there's a number
up at the top, eight lines.

00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:12.526 A:middle
Basically for each of the
banners you can choose

00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:14.406 A:middle
which lines you want
to associate them with.

00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:15.836 A:middle
You may have certain banners

00:24:15.836 --> 00:24:18.016 A:middle
that may appeal a certain
demographics and certain banners

00:24:18.016 --> 00:24:19.426 A:middle
that may appeal to
different demographics,

00:24:19.756 --> 00:24:22.066 A:middle
this way you have the
ability to pick and choose

00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:23.976 A:middle
which banners will
show up to which lines.

00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:29.036 A:middle
OK. So now we've gotten familiar
with how this campaign is going.

00:24:29.446 --> 00:24:31.536 A:middle
Let's go back to the
Dashboard and take a look

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:32.306 A:middle
at how it's performing.

00:24:33.006 --> 00:24:34.956 A:middle
We click on Home button and
go back to the Dashboard.

00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:38.026 A:middle
We are looking at
this Clara campaign.

00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:41.586 A:middle
Let's drill into spend and
see how we're doing on spend.

00:24:42.596 --> 00:24:44.526 A:middle
So when you come to
the analytics page,

00:24:45.136 --> 00:24:47.576 A:middle
one of the first things you
should do is choose what time

00:24:47.576 --> 00:24:48.606 A:middle
range you wish to look at.

00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:51.246 A:middle
By default we start with
today but there's option

00:24:51.246 --> 00:24:53.166 A:middle
for yesterday, the
last seven days,

00:24:53.166 --> 00:24:54.356 A:middle
the last 30 days, et cetera.

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:55.936 A:middle
Let's go with last 30 days.

00:24:57.466 --> 00:25:00.186 A:middle
Up at the top, you actually see
the numbers for your campaign,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.466 --> 00:25:00.186 A:middle
Up at the top, you actually see
the numbers for your campaign,

00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
the full lifetime
of your campaign.

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:03.926 A:middle
So you always have
that at your fingertips

00:25:03.926 --> 00:25:06.186 A:middle
so you can compare not
only how you're doing based

00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:07.466 A:middle
on the time range
that you've chosen

00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:09.646 A:middle
but the overall life
of the campaign.

00:25:10.586 --> 00:25:13.446 A:middle
So now that we've chosen last
30 days, we can see in the graph

00:25:13.446 --> 00:25:14.996 A:middle
and you can see how
much is being spent

00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:16.386 A:middle
across those 30 days.

00:25:17.056 --> 00:25:18.616 A:middle
You can choose to graph
a different metric,

00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:19.946 A:middle
impressions, taps.

00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:21.616 A:middle
Let's stick with
the average CPA.

00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:25.556 A:middle
So you can see overall average
CPA is performing pretty well

00:25:25.696 --> 00:25:27.966 A:middle
and then you can overlay a
second metric on top of it

00:25:27.966 --> 00:25:30.266 A:middle
so you can vary to see
how the spend is doing

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:32.306 A:middle
as compared to your average CPA.

00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:35.936 A:middle
In addition to the overlays,
you can actually click up here,

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:38.646 A:middle
compare with the previous
period to see how your spend--

00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:41.786 A:middle
or your average CPA is doing
over the previous 30 days

00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:43.476 A:middle
or the-- versus the
current 30 days.

00:25:43.996 --> 00:25:49.856 A:middle
And finally, you can also click
on a tabular view and see all

00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:51.736 A:middle
of the detailed information
about each

00:25:51.736 --> 00:25:52.896 A:middle
of the metrics all at once.

00:25:53.356 --> 00:25:55.976 A:middle
And if you would like you
can download a CSV file

00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:58.776 A:middle
so you can import it into
numbers or into Excel and slice

00:25:58.776 --> 00:25:59.726 A:middle
and dice it as you wish.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:08.056 A:middle
OK, so now from here this
was all about the campaign

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:11.036 A:middle
but we can also drill in
to see the individual lines

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:11.666 A:middle
as I discussed.

00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:14.986 A:middle
When you click on Lines Tab, you
see all of the different lines

00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:16.636 A:middle
and how they're comparing
against each other.

00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:19.966 A:middle
You can choose a metric, we can
do it base on average CPA again

00:26:20.506 --> 00:26:25.206 A:middle
and see that men 18 to 24 has
higher CPA than men 25 to 34.

00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:28.656 A:middle
Right now we graph three lines.

00:26:28.706 --> 00:26:30.026 A:middle
You can choose which
lines you want.

00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:34.186 A:middle
You can unselect 25 to 34
and select women 25 to 34

00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:35.156 A:middle
and see how that's doing.

00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:36.186 A:middle
And then quickly the graph--

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:40.146 A:middle
,oh, it looks like
that one has no spent.

00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:43.286 A:middle
OK, women 35 to 49, so you can
see how those three lines are

00:26:43.286 --> 00:26:44.016 A:middle
comparing to each other.

00:26:44.546 --> 00:26:48.476 A:middle
And then we have a similar
view on the banner side

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:50.606 A:middle
so you can compare how banners
are doing against each other.

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:54.506 A:middle
For this campaign, we actually
only have one banner that's

00:26:54.506 --> 00:26:56.656 A:middle
currently active so you
actually only see one banner.

00:26:57.596 --> 00:27:00.066 A:middle
You could-- If you don't
remember what Marigold Promo

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.596 --> 00:27:00.066 A:middle
You could-- If you don't
remember what Marigold Promo

00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:02.476 A:middle
[phonetic] actually relates
to, you can click on I icon

00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
and get a refresher of
exactly what this banner is.

00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:10.346 A:middle
OK, let's go back to lines and
see what optimizations we can do

00:27:10.346 --> 00:27:12.456 A:middle
against lines to improve
our campaigns performance.

00:27:12.956 --> 00:27:17.176 A:middle
OK, let's look at the overall
lifetime of the campaign.

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:22.386 A:middle
So at the bottom of the--
at the bottom of the screen,

00:27:22.536 --> 00:27:24.646 A:middle
you see a table which basically
has all the different--

00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:26.876 A:middle
all the different
metrics that we have.

00:27:27.006 --> 00:27:28.906 A:middle
We want to optimize
based on the average CPA.

00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:32.366 A:middle
We can sort by average CPA which
again is how much you're paying

00:27:32.366 --> 00:27:33.856 A:middle
on average for additional
download.

00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:36.646 A:middle
And we see that these two
lines, the average CPA,

00:27:36.646 --> 00:27:39.326 A:middle
a dollar sixty-eight and a
dollar eighty-four is much less

00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:40.576 A:middle
than the 3 dollars
that we inputted.

00:27:41.016 --> 00:27:42.906 A:middle
So those two lines seem to
be performing pretty well.

00:27:43.256 --> 00:27:44.846 A:middle
And as you can see,
the downloads

00:27:44.846 --> 00:27:47.266 A:middle
for those two lines seem to
be the best out of those two--

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:48.746 A:middle
out of all the lines
that we have.

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:51.586 A:middle
So not only are you getting more
downloads you're actually paying

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:54.156 A:middle
less for each download, this
seems like a good combination.

00:27:54.866 --> 00:27:58.656 A:middle
So it would make sense for to
actually add additional spend

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
to these two lines perhaps
taking it away from the spend

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
to these two lines perhaps
taking it away from the spend

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.546 A:middle
from some of the lines that
are not performing as well.

00:28:04.076 --> 00:28:07.416 A:middle
And so this is the
power that you have

00:28:07.556 --> 00:28:08.746 A:middle
when you're doing
manual targeting.

00:28:09.116 --> 00:28:10.956 A:middle
But the beauty of
Auto is that this--

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:13.636 A:middle
these optimizations are
automatically done by iAd.

00:28:13.886 --> 00:28:17.876 A:middle
We automatically figure out
which demographics are the ones

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:20.516 A:middle
that are performing best for
you giving you maximum downloads

00:28:20.606 --> 00:28:21.416 A:middle
and lowest CPA.

00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:23.196 A:middle
Back to you Madhu.

00:28:23.196 --> 00:28:24.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:28:25.316 --> 00:28:26.006 A:middle
Thank you Vineet.

00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:30.066 A:middle
So we saw how you can
manage your performance.

00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:31.466 A:middle
Once you have setup
your campaigns,

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:33.686 A:middle
you can go into the tool

00:28:33.686 --> 00:28:36.136 A:middle
and manage the performance
of these campaigns.

00:28:38.006 --> 00:28:40.796 A:middle
So iAd Workbench as I
mentioned is available now.

00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:43.736 A:middle
We launched it yesterday
and many

00:28:43.736 --> 00:28:45.416 A:middle
of you already started using it.

00:28:46.026 --> 00:28:47.156 A:middle
But what else could we do?

00:28:47.846 --> 00:28:52.946 A:middle
So coming in the Fall, we
have iAd Workbench for iOS.

00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:56.456 A:middle
So we have it on
the iPhone and iPad.

00:28:57.076 --> 00:29:00.866 A:middle
Many of you perhaps use
iTunes connect mobile

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.076 --> 00:29:00.866 A:middle
Many of you perhaps use
iTunes connect mobile

00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
for managing your apps on
the go in the App Store.

00:29:04.466 --> 00:29:08.886 A:middle
Now the same app with the
additional iAd tab can be used

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:11.846 A:middle
to manage your campaigns
on the go.

00:29:12.696 --> 00:29:14.346 A:middle
So what are the key
features here?

00:29:15.056 --> 00:29:17.206 A:middle
You have access to
actionable information.

00:29:17.746 --> 00:29:20.516 A:middle
So the same dashboard and
drill downs that we saw

00:29:20.816 --> 00:29:24.856 A:middle
on the web application are also
available on the iOS devices.

00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:27.236 A:middle
But they are customized
obviously for touch.

00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:30.236 A:middle
And you will see Mike
giving us a demo of that.

00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:32.906 A:middle
We also have alerts
and notifications

00:29:33.436 --> 00:29:34.396 A:middle
which is really important--

00:29:34.396 --> 00:29:36.616 A:middle
which are really important
in the mobile context.

00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:40.636 A:middle
We will tell you what's
going on with your account

00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:43.766 A:middle
or with your campaign on the
go so you can take action.

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:47.366 A:middle
The action can be our
bidding date, so if you want

00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:49.946 A:middle
to extend your campaign
or extend your budgets,

00:29:50.376 --> 00:29:52.776 A:middle
change your bid based on the
alerts that you might get

00:29:53.386 --> 00:29:56.586 A:middle
or based on the performance
you might want to pause

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:59.566 A:middle
or unpause any of the
campaigns, lines or banners

00:29:59.566 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
that you have running.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:04.776 A:middle
So all of the functionality that
you see on the web for managing

00:30:04.776 --> 00:30:09.616 A:middle
and optimizing your campaigns is
also available for you on iOS.

00:30:11.846 --> 00:30:15.776 A:middle
So its coming this fall but
Mike can do a demo for us now.

00:30:16.456 --> 00:30:16.676 A:middle
Mike?

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:17.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:17.376 --> 00:30:19.966 A:middle
So this is the iTunes
connect mobile application

00:30:19.966 --> 00:30:22.226 A:middle
and I'm sure a lot of
you are familiar with.

00:30:22.226 --> 00:30:25.356 A:middle
Let's fire it up.

00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:27.876 A:middle
And we'll sign in
with our Apple ID.

00:30:28.396 --> 00:30:32.336 A:middle
And the first thing you'll
notice that on the bottom,

00:30:32.336 --> 00:30:35.036 A:middle
there's now iAd tab that
wasn't there before.

00:30:36.096 --> 00:30:38.606 A:middle
And this is the campaign
Dashboard page.

00:30:38.606 --> 00:30:40.476 A:middle
It shows all the
campaigns that we have.

00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:43.806 A:middle
You can see some brief info
about them, their name,

00:30:43.806 --> 00:30:45.976 A:middle
their status, their
flight dates.

00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:50.266 A:middle
You can sort them by running,
not running, or completed.

00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:53.586 A:middle
Let's have a look at the
first campaign here BD iPad1.

00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:55.296 A:middle
We'll tap that.

00:30:55.876 --> 00:30:59.256 A:middle
These are the campaign
detail page.

00:30:59.416 --> 00:31:01.906 A:middle
At the top you will see-- again,
see some basic information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.416 --> 00:31:01.906 A:middle
At the top you will see-- again,
see some basic information

00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:05.996 A:middle
about this campaign, the name,
the flight dates, the status.

00:31:06.766 --> 00:31:09.616 A:middle
Down the bottom you'll see all
your campaign results to date.

00:31:09.956 --> 00:31:12.376 A:middle
So you will your spend in
relation to your budget,

00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:15.856 A:middle
your average CPC,
your average CPA

00:31:15.856 --> 00:31:18.286 A:middle
and your CPA goal and downloads.

00:31:18.286 --> 00:31:22.126 A:middle
And if you wanted to see how
these metrics accrued over time,

00:31:22.726 --> 00:31:24.856 A:middle
you can swipe the
table to the left

00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:26.826 A:middle
and you see a beautiful
graph of the data.

00:31:27.116 --> 00:31:36.036 A:middle
So this is for spend, average
CPC, average CPA and downloads.

00:31:36.836 --> 00:31:39.206 A:middle
By default, it's showing
the last 24 hour period.

00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:45.656 A:middle
You can also change the time
period for seven days, 30 days

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:50.016 A:middle
or for the lifetime
of your campaign.

00:31:50.016 --> 00:31:51.666 A:middle
If you want to see the graph

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:56.506 A:middle
in more detail you can rotate
your device to landscape

00:31:57.046 --> 00:31:59.056 A:middle
and see the graph
in full screen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.206 --> 00:32:02.466 A:middle
All the same graphs
that were available

00:32:02.466 --> 00:32:04.436 A:middle
in portrait are available
in landscape.

00:32:05.656 --> 00:32:08.246 A:middle
If you just want to jump to
a specific graph and not want

00:32:08.246 --> 00:32:10.636 A:middle
to have to swipe through to
find it, you can just tap

00:32:10.636 --> 00:32:12.236 A:middle
that metric in the table view.

00:32:12.696 --> 00:32:16.346 A:middle
So if we want to jump quickly to
spend, we can just tap on that

00:32:16.346 --> 00:32:18.046 A:middle
and look at the spend graph.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.976 A:middle
Let's switch back to portrait.

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:25.746 A:middle
In the middle of the screen
you'll notice two buttons,

00:32:26.146 --> 00:32:28.156 A:middle
one for line items
and one for banners.

00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:30.926 A:middle
Use for the line items
associated worth this campaign

00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:31.746 A:middle
and for the banners.

00:32:31.746 --> 00:32:33.526 A:middle
Let's look at the line items.

00:32:35.056 --> 00:32:36.236 A:middle
This shows the three line items

00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:37.786 A:middle
that I have associated
with this campaign.

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:42.186 A:middle
You'll see the name, the flight
dates, the status and the spent

00:32:42.186 --> 00:32:43.146 A:middle
in relation to the budget.

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:44.906 A:middle
Let's tap into the first one.

00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:50.546 A:middle
This shows the line
detail screen, very similar

00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:51.946 A:middle
to the campaign detail screen.

00:32:51.946 --> 00:32:54.046 A:middle
We will see some basic
information at the top

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:56.816 A:middle
about the status, the flight
dates and you will the results

00:32:56.816 --> 00:32:57.936 A:middle
to date down the bottom.

00:32:57.936 --> 00:33:00.596 A:middle
You will be able to see the
spend in relation to the budget,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.936 --> 00:33:00.596 A:middle
You will be able to see the
spend in relation to the budget,

00:33:01.056 --> 00:33:03.926 A:middle
the average CPC,
CPA and downloads.

00:33:04.266 --> 00:33:06.976 A:middle
And of course you can swipe
them to get the graphs.

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:13.896 A:middle
In the middle section
there's a button for banners.

00:33:14.266 --> 00:33:16.336 A:middle
This will show us all the
banners we have associated

00:33:16.336 --> 00:33:17.616 A:middle
with this particular campaign.

00:33:17.966 --> 00:33:19.346 A:middle
So let's tap that
and have a look.

00:33:20.886 --> 00:33:23.226 A:middle
There're two banners
associated with this campaign

00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:26.596 A:middle
and its showing us the
spend on both of those.

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.576 A:middle
Let's tap and look
at the first one.

00:33:29.906 --> 00:33:31.836 A:middle
This is the banner
detail very similar

00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:33.906 A:middle
to the campaign detail
and line detail.

00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:36.116 A:middle
We're going to have some basic
information about the banner

00:33:36.116 --> 00:33:39.166 A:middle
at the top, its status, and
down the bottom you'll have the

00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:40.556 A:middle
banner results to date.

00:33:41.596 --> 00:33:44.496 A:middle
And again, you can
swipe over and look

00:33:44.496 --> 00:33:45.986 A:middle
at the graphs for
the various data.

00:33:46.766 --> 00:33:51.656 A:middle
Now you notice in the top
right corner there there's a

00:33:51.656 --> 00:33:52.406 A:middle
Pause button.

00:33:52.546 --> 00:33:53.626 A:middle
You'll be able to pause

00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:56.056 A:middle
and restart your banner
directly from your device.

00:33:56.586 --> 00:33:57.626 A:middle
So let's pause this banner.

00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:00.336 A:middle
It'll ask us if we
want to continue.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:00.336 A:middle
It'll ask us if we
want to continue.

00:34:00.536 --> 00:34:02.926 A:middle
Yes. And now the
banner is paused.

00:34:03.386 --> 00:34:06.056 A:middle
If we want to restart the
banner, we can just tap Restart

00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:09.246 A:middle
and continue and the
banner is now restarted.

00:34:10.516 --> 00:34:12.456 A:middle
Let's go back to the
campaign Dashboard page

00:34:12.456 --> 00:34:14.406 A:middle
by tapping the tab
at the bottom.

00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:18.815 A:middle
And you may have notice at the
top it's telling us that one

00:34:18.815 --> 00:34:20.576 A:middle
of our campaigns
may need attention.

00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:22.525 A:middle
And the second campaign,

00:34:22.525 --> 00:34:25.576 A:middle
Prod Pack promo has an
Alert icon next to it,

00:34:25.706 --> 00:34:28.146 A:middle
signifying that that is the
campaign that has a problem.

00:34:28.676 --> 00:34:33.045 A:middle
So let's tap that
and have a look.

00:34:33.426 --> 00:34:34.795 A:middle
You'll notice on
the lines button,

00:34:34.916 --> 00:34:37.396 A:middle
there's another alert
button, another alert icon.

00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:40.246 A:middle
So it's telling us that one of
our line items has a problem.

00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:42.735 A:middle
So, let's tap it
and check it out.

00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:46.786 A:middle
We have eight line items
associated with this campaign

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:50.416 A:middle
and you'll notice that two
of them have the alert icon,

00:34:50.416 --> 00:34:52.396 A:middle
so two of the lines
have a problem.

00:34:53.085 --> 00:34:54.146 A:middle
Let's look at the second one.

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.596 A:middle
And there we go.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:59.836 A:middle
At the top, it's telling us
exactly what the problem is.

00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.996 A:middle
It's saying a bid amount
may not be sufficient

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.996 A:middle
It's saying a bid amount
may not be sufficient

00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:03.486 A:middle
to reach our campaign goal.

00:35:04.256 --> 00:35:06.226 A:middle
So that definitely seems
like something we should fix.

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:08.576 A:middle
So on the top right corner

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:10.526 A:middle
of the screen you'll
notice an Edit button.

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:12.966 A:middle
Let's tap that and
edit this line item.

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:17.216 A:middle
So this is the line item editor.

00:35:17.886 --> 00:35:21.936 A:middle
In here, you can change
the end date, the budget,

00:35:22.126 --> 00:35:24.896 A:middle
your max daily spend
and you CPA goal.

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:27.416 A:middle
And you notice down the bottom,
you can also pause the line

00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:29.906 A:middle
or restart the line much
like you can with banners.

00:35:31.206 --> 00:35:32.896 A:middle
So, you can also see
down at the bottom

00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:35.846 A:middle
on the CPA goal line
there's the alert icon.

00:35:36.096 --> 00:35:38.376 A:middle
That letting us know that
that is a particular line

00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:39.596 A:middle
that we need to change.

00:35:40.326 --> 00:35:42.446 A:middle
So, let's tap on
that to edit it.

00:35:43.286 --> 00:35:45.786 A:middle
This will bring up
a standard keypad

00:35:45.786 --> 00:35:48.176 A:middle
but we've added two custom
buttons in there for you,

00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:50.556 A:middle
a plus 5 percent and
a minus 5 percent

00:35:50.556 --> 00:35:54.046 A:middle
so you can quickly change your
value by 5 percent increments.

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:55.756 A:middle
So let's add 5 percent.

00:35:56.046 --> 00:35:58.626 A:middle
Now, let's bump it
up another 5 percent.

00:35:59.226 --> 00:36:02.236 A:middle
When you're satisfied with
all the values and you want

00:35:59.226 --> 00:36:02.236 A:middle
When you're satisfied with
all the values and you want

00:36:02.346 --> 00:36:05.246 A:middle
to save it, just
touch the Done button

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:07.636 A:middle
and the values are now saved.

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.306 A:middle
So these are just some of the
features that will be available

00:36:11.306 --> 00:36:13.896 A:middle
in new iAd module within iTunes
net mobile coming in the fall.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Mike.

00:36:25.026 --> 00:36:27.056 A:middle

00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:30.746 A:middle
But iAd Workbench is already
available and thousands

00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:34.816 A:middle
So get started with
iAd Workbench.

00:36:35.366 --> 00:36:36.976 A:middle
