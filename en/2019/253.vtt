[ Music ]

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Jared McGann.

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:10.586 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager in

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:11.286 A:middle
watchOS.

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.556 A:middle
In watchOS 5, Apple released the

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.175 A:middle
new Infograph clock faces with

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.466 A:middle
graphic complications.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.526 A:middle
In watchOS 6, we've enhanced

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:22.226 A:middle
graphic complications with a new

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:22.816 A:middle
tinted mode.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.136 A:middle
Any clock face with graphic

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:27.616 A:middle
complications supports tinted

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:28.456 A:middle
complications.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.606 A:middle
Here's some more examples from

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:32.086 A:middle
our new watch faces in watchOS

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:32.516 A:middle
6.

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:34.976 A:middle
These graphic complications are

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:36.546 A:middle
composed of three data types;

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:38.406 A:middle
gauges, text, and images.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.626 A:middle
The system alters the appearance

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.076 A:middle
of each into contexts.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.576 A:middle
Let's walk through each one.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.876 A:middle
In tinted context, gauges are

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:48.266 A:middle
displayed as a solid color

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:49.596 A:middle
rather than a color gradient.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:52.816 A:middle
The color of the gauge is

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.306 A:middle
determined by the system, as

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:55.626 A:middle
informed by the customer's color

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:56.156 A:middle
selection.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.406 A:middle
If your complication relies on

00:00:58.406 --> 00:00:59.796 A:middle
color to communicate information

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
within the gauge, you may need

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
within the gauge, you may need

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.616 A:middle
to reconsider how you display

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.726 A:middle
that information in your

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:04.396 A:middle
complication.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:08.286 A:middle
Text is also displayed with a

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.056 A:middle
single color in tinted contexts.

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:11.816 A:middle
Again, the color is determined

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:12.876 A:middle
by the system, based on the

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:14.016 A:middle
customer's color choice.

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:16.576 A:middle
Multicolor text providers are

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.626 A:middle
reduced to a single color, as

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:19.996 A:middle
seen in the activity rings

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.746 A:middle
complication.

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.116 A:middle
Lastly, images are desaturated

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.866 A:middle
by default in tinted contexts,

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.536 A:middle
but we also have new API to

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:31.086 A:middle
provide alternate images in this

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:31.366 A:middle
mode.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.356 A:middle
Before we dive into the new API,

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:36.966 A:middle
I'd like to take a step back and

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.056 A:middle
talk about data providers

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:38.596 A:middle
generally.

00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:40.886 A:middle
ClockKit includes a number of

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:41.756 A:middle
data providers for

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:42.646 A:middle
complications.

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
These providers manage the data

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:46.066 A:middle
you supply to ClockKit for

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.446 A:middle
display within a complication.

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:51.276 A:middle
Let's take a look at the full

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:52.456 A:middle
color image provider.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.056 A:middle
The image property specifies a

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.666 A:middle
full-color image to be displayed

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.666 A:middle
by a complication.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.486 A:middle
Then there's an accessibility

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.486 A:middle
Then there's an accessibility

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:02.846 A:middle
label property, which is a

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.496 A:middle
succinct label that identifies

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.596 A:middle
the purpose of the image.

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.596 A:middle
So how do you provide an

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:08.866 A:middle
alternate image for tinted

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:09.556 A:middle
contexts?

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:12.436 A:middle
In watchOS 6 there's a new

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:13.146 A:middle
property in

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.646 A:middle
CLKFullColorImageProvider called

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:16.616 A:middle
tintedImageProvider.

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:18.866 A:middle
It's an optional property where

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.316 A:middle
you can provide a separate image

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:21.966 A:middle
for tinted contexts if you don't

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.266 A:middle
want the full color image to be

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:23.986 A:middle
desaturated.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:26.466 A:middle
This property is of the type

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.196 A:middle
CLKImageProvider.

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:30.266 A:middle
We chose this class because it

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.406 A:middle
allows you to provide both

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.926 A:middle
one-piece and two-piece template

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.516 A:middle
images for tinted contexts.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.506 A:middle
Let's take a closer look at

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.426 A:middle
CLKImageProvider, which has been

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.726 A:middle
around since watchOS 2.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.316 A:middle
The first thing to note is that

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:46.436 A:middle
CLKFullColorImageProvider is not

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:48.356 A:middle
derived from CLKImageProvider.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.516 A:middle
These are two distinct classes.

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.596 A:middle
This class, CLKImageProvider,

00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:55.316 A:middle
manages template images for

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:56.536 A:middle
display in a complication.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.326 A:middle
The clock face displaying the

00:02:58.326 --> 00:02:59.686 A:middle
complication determines how to

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.396 A:middle
display the image and what tint

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.396 A:middle
display the image and what tint

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:02.146 A:middle
color to apply.

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.606 A:middle
The first property is one-piece

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.956 A:middle
image, which is a single

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:07.806 A:middle
template image.

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.386 A:middle
This is the only required

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:10.186 A:middle
property.

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:12.906 A:middle
Next up is tint color.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:14.946 A:middle
In some classic complication

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:16.806 A:middle
contexts, this color is applied

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:17.906 A:middle
to the template image within a

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:18.676 A:middle
complication.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:21.396 A:middle
In graphic complications, tint

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:22.906 A:middle
color is ignored because color

00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:24.516 A:middle
is determined by the system as

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:25.766 A:middle
influenced by the customer's

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:26.556 A:middle
color selection.

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:29.266 A:middle
Then, there are two-piece

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.996 A:middle
images, which are composed of

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:32.576 A:middle
the two-piece image background

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.366 A:middle
and two-piece image foreground

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:34.926 A:middle
properties.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.636 A:middle
Classic complications use

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.306 A:middle
two-piece images in multicolor

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:42.836 A:middle
contexts, as seen here.

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:45.026 A:middle
Graphic complications use

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.656 A:middle
two-piece images in some tinted

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.406 A:middle
contexts.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.606 A:middle
When applicable, two-piece

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:51.066 A:middle
images take priority over

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
one-piece images.

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:54.856 A:middle
A two-piece image consists of a

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:56.456 A:middle
foreground image layered on top

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:57.466 A:middle
of a background image.

00:03:58.146 --> 00:03:59.906 A:middle
Both images are template images.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:01.966 A:middle
In classic complications, the

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:02.976 A:middle
color and the tint color

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.416 A:middle
property is applied to the

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:06.026 A:middle
background image and white to

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:06.936 A:middle
the foreground image.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.536 A:middle
In tinted graphic complications,

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:11.306 A:middle
as previously mentioned, tint

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:12.156 A:middle
color is ignored.

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:13.936 A:middle
The system will determine the

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.686 A:middle
foreground and background colors

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:17.236 A:middle
as informed by the customer's

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:17.995 A:middle
color selection.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:21.776 A:middle
Let's walk through a few

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:23.536 A:middle
scenarios for displaying images

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:24.656 A:middle
within a tinted graphic

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:25.316 A:middle
complication.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:27.706 A:middle
The first is for the full color

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:29.276 A:middle
image to appear desaturated in

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:30.236 A:middle
tinted contexts.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.036 A:middle
Here, we see the full color

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
image desaturated, more or less

00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:35.066 A:middle
gray scale on the right.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:39.236 A:middle
To achieve this in code, merely

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:39.906 A:middle
initialize a

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:41.796 A:middle
CLKFullColorImageProvider

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.696 A:middle
without a tintedImageProvider,

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:44.676 A:middle
as seen here.

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:46.816 A:middle
When the tintedImageProvider

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
property is nil, the system

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.316 A:middle
displays a desaturated version

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.426 A:middle
of the full color image.

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:55.406 A:middle
In other scenarios, you may want

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:56.666 A:middle
to display an alternate template

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.126 A:middle
image in tinted contexts.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.086 A:middle
Perhaps your full color image

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.086 A:middle
Perhaps your full color image

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.816 A:middle
doesn't desaturate well, or

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:02.686 A:middle
maybe you're concerned about a

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:03.796 A:middle
logo being displayed in

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:04.816 A:middle
undesirable colors.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.586 A:middle
To do this in code, create a

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:10.406 A:middle
CLKImageProvider with the

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.866 A:middle
desired one-piece template

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:12.266 A:middle
image.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.086 A:middle
Then supply that in the

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.086 A:middle
CLKFullColorImageProvider

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:18.096 A:middle
initializer alongside the full

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:18.796 A:middle
color image.

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.456 A:middle
In full color context, ClockKit

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:22.716 A:middle
will utilize the full color

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:23.106 A:middle
image.

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:24.946 A:middle
In tinted contexts, the

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:25.896 A:middle
one-piece image from the

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:27.356 A:middle
CLKImageProvider will be

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:27.996 A:middle
utilized.

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:32.226 A:middle
It's worth noting that you can

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:33.936 A:middle
also provide the same full color

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:34.646 A:middle
image within the

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:36.596 A:middle
tintedImageProvider, and that

00:05:36.596 --> 00:05:37.926 A:middle
image will be templatized

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:39.076 A:middle
instead of desaturated.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.246 A:middle
We use this technique in many of

00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:42.266 A:middle
the standard watchOS

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:43.126 A:middle
complications.

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.846 A:middle
Lastly, you may want to provide

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.176 A:middle
an alternate two-piece image in

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:50.146 A:middle
tinted contexts.

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:54.776 A:middle
To achieve this, create a

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:56.626 A:middle
CLKImageProvider with both

00:05:56.626 --> 00:05:58.246 A:middle
one-piece and two-piece template

00:05:58.246 --> 00:05:58.776 A:middle
images.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.866 A:middle
Then supply this object in the
