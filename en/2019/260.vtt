[ Music ]

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jacob.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.046 A:middle
I'm here to tell you about the

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.396 A:middle
Semantic Segmentation Mattes.

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:17.486 A:middle
So, first, I'm going to go

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:18.676 A:middle
through what are these new types

00:00:18.676 --> 00:00:19.226 A:middle
of mattes.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:20.436 A:middle
And then, David is going to talk

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:21.956 A:middle
you through how to leverage a

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:23.156 A:middle
core image to work with these

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.316 A:middle
new mattes.

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.846 A:middle
So, remember in iOS 12, we

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:29.016 A:middle
introduced the Portrait Effect

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:29.236 A:middle
Matte?

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:31.376 A:middle
So, this was a matte designed

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:33.466 A:middle
explicitly to provide effects

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:34.516 A:middle
for portraits.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:36.836 A:middle
So, we use it internally to

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.046 A:middle
render beautiful looking

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.806 A:middle
portrait mode photos and

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:40.676 A:middle
portrait lighting photos.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:44.026 A:middle
So, in taking a closer look at

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:45.906 A:middle
the Portrait effect in matte,

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:48.236 A:middle
you can see how that clearly

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.616 A:middle
delineates the foreground

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.356 A:middle
subject from the background.

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:52.946 A:middle
So, this is beautifully

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:54.766 A:middle
represented here as a black and,

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:55.676 A:middle
black and white matte.

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:57.456 A:middle
So, values of 1 indicating

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:59.236 A:middle
foreground and values of zero

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
indicating background.

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
indicating background.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:04.126 A:middle
In iOS 13, we are taking this a

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.186 A:middle
step further with Semantic

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:06.166 A:middle
Segmentation Mattes.

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:09.000 A:middle
So, we're introducing hair,

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:12.660 A:middle
skin,

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:15.666 A:middle
and teeth.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.976 A:middle
So, taking a closer look at the

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.526 A:middle
hair matte, for instance, you

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:22.546 A:middle
can see how this is beautifully

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.006 A:middle
separating the hair region from

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:25.906 A:middle
the non-hair regions.

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:28.126 A:middle
So, we get great hair details

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:29.176 A:middle
against the background.

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:30.636 A:middle
And we get great separation

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:32.036 A:middle
between the non-hair regions

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.566 A:middle
and-- and the hair.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.956 A:middle
Similarly, for the skin regions

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:37.496 A:middle
where now we have alpha values

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.356 A:middle
indicating how much of a pixel

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.676 A:middle
is of type skin.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.736 A:middle
So, so an alpha value of .7, for

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.776 A:middle
instance, would indicate that,

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.056 A:middle
that a pixel is 70% of type

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:47.386 A:middle
skin.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:49.546 A:middle
So, we hope these new three

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.226 A:middle
types, three new types of mattes

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.656 A:middle
will give you the creative

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:55.076 A:middle
freedom to, to render some cool

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.586 A:middle
effects and beautiful looking

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:57.000 A:middle
photos.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
So, a few things to note is that

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
So, a few things to note is that

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.446 A:middle
the mattes are half size of the

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.206 A:middle
original image.

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:05.076 A:middle
That means they are half in each

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:06.406 A:middle
dimension of the original image.

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:07.376 A:middle
And that means quarter

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:07.816 A:middle
resolution.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.536 A:middle
So, another thing to remember is

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:11.986 A:middle
that-- that these segmentation

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:13.196 A:middle
mattes can actually overlap.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.046 A:middle
So, this is particularly true

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:16.106 A:middle
for the Portrait Effects Matte

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:17.026 A:middle
and the Skin Matte that will

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
inherently overlap.

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:23.146 A:middle
So, these mattes do not come for

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:23.526 A:middle
free.

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:24.736 A:middle
So, we heavily leveraged the

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:26.316 A:middle
Apple Neural Engines for machine

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:27.576 A:middle
learning spectral graph theory.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.526 A:middle
And looking a bit under the hood

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.586 A:middle
what we do is we take the

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:32.546 A:middle
original size image.

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:33.526 A:middle
We feed it through the Apple

00:02:33.526 --> 00:02:35.016 A:middle
Neural Engine and together with

00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:36.906 A:middle
the original sized image, we, we

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.256 A:middle
render these high-resolution,

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:40.376 A:middle
high-quality with high

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:42.036 A:middle
consistency segmentation mattes.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:43.296 A:middle
These are then ready to be

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.506 A:middle
embedded into the HEIF or JPG

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:46.236 A:middle
files as you know them, together

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:47.456 A:middle
with the original sized image

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:48.886 A:middle
and the Depth, as you know, from

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:49.496 A:middle
iOS 11.

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:53.546 A:middle
So, there are two distinct ways

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:55.876 A:middle
to generate these two types of

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:56.216 A:middle
mattes.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:57.466 A:middle
So, so one is that they're

00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:58.616 A:middle
embedded in all Portrait Mode

00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.216 A:middle
captures.

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
So, you can grab them from those

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
So, you can grab them from those

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.016 A:middle
files.

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:02.816 A:middle
Or even better, you can write

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.236 A:middle
your won capture app and opt

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:05.566 A:middle
into these mattes on capture.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.506 A:middle
So, if you have files with the

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.466 A:middle
segmentation mattes in them, you

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:10.926 A:middle
can work with them through Core

00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:12.026 A:middle
Image and Image I/O.

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:13.536 A:middle
David's going to talk more about

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:13.916 A:middle
that.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:16.356 A:middle
But first, I'm going to talk you

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:17.736 A:middle
through how to capture with AV

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.216 A:middle
Foundation API.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.516 A:middle
There are four phases we're

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:24.536 A:middle
going to go through here that

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:25.646 A:middle
relates to the extension.

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:27.336 A:middle
So, first, is when we set up the

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.416 A:middle
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:30.306 A:middle
So, again, is when the capture

00:03:30.306 --> 00:03:31.886 A:middle
request is being initiated and

00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:33.146 A:middle
any point in the lifecycle of

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
your app.

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:35.966 A:middle
Then, two of the callbacks.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.376 A:middle
So, one is when the settings are

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:38.716 A:middle
resolved for your capture.

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
And the final one is the when

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:42.186 A:middle
the Photo did finish processing.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.116 A:middle
So, for, for full details on

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:45.726 A:middle
this, please, refer to Brad's

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.000 A:middle
2017 talk on this exact topic.

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:52.356 A:middle
Let's go through how to set up

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:53.926 A:middle
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.116 A:middle
So, this usually happens when

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.436 A:middle
you're, you're setting, you're

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.356 A:middle
configuring your session.

00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:59.726 A:middle
So, you've already at this point

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:00.646 A:middle
on session dot begin

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:00.646 A:middle
on session dot begin

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:01.856 A:middle
configuration, you've set your

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:02.406 A:middle
presets.

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:03.956 A:middle
You've added your device inputs,

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.026 A:middle
you add your

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:06.016 A:middle
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:07.606 A:middle
At this point is when you, when

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:09.856 A:middle
you tell the API what superset

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.016 A:middle
of segmentation mattes are you

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:12.316 A:middle
going to ask for at any point in

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:13.806 A:middle
the lifecycle of your app.

00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:16.156 A:middle
When you actually want to

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.375 A:middle
initiate your capture request,

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.416 A:middle
you need to specify the

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:19.406 A:middle
AVCapturePhoto setting.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:21.836 A:middle
So, this, this is where you tell

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:23.436 A:middle
the API this is what I really

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:24.816 A:middle
want in this particular capture.

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
So, here again, you can specify

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:28.086 A:middle
all the ones that you already

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
enabled.

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.466 A:middle
Or you can specify a subset, say

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:31.116 A:middle
hair or skin.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:33.966 A:middle
Now, you initiate your capture

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:34.316 A:middle
request.

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:35.706 A:middle
So, you give it the

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
AVCapturePhoto settings and you

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:38.106 A:middle
give it the delegate where you

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.236 A:middle
want to have your callbacks.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:43.926 A:middle
So, time passes and soon after

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:45.386 A:middle
you get that, get a

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.166 A:middle
willBeginCaptureFor callback.

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:49.006 A:middle
This is when, this is when the

00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:51.236 A:middle
API tells you, you may have

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.296 A:middle
asked for something but this is

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:53.116 A:middle
what you're actually going to

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:53.206 A:middle
get.

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:54.976 A:middle
So, this is important for the

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.036 A:middle
Portrait Effects Matte and the

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.136 A:middle
Semantic Segmentation Mattes

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:58.436 A:middle
because if there are no people

00:04:58.436 --> 00:04:59.826 A:middle
in the scene, you'll actually

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:00.576 A:middle
not get a matte here.

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:00.576 A:middle
not get a matte here.

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:02.346 A:middle
So, you need to check for the

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:03.856 A:middle
dimension of the-- dimensions of

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:04.826 A:middle
the Semantic Segmentation

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:05.046 A:middle
Mattes.

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:09.346 A:middle
They'll be zero, in such case.

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.586 A:middle
More time passes.

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.316 A:middle
The photo did finish processing.

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.876 A:middle
So, this is when you get your

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:17.376 A:middle
AV-- AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:17.646 A:middle
back.

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:18.706 A:middle
This is the variable matte, in

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:19.196 A:middle
this case.

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:21.796 A:middle
So, this new class have the same

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:23.876 A:middle
type of methods and properties

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:24.916 A:middle
as you know from the Portrait

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
Effects Matte.

00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:26.706 A:middle
That means you can rotate

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:27.656 A:middle
according to Exif data.

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:29.296 A:middle
You can get your CVPixelBuffer

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.016 A:middle
reference or you can get a

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:32.416 A:middle
dictionary representation for

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.596 A:middle
each file I/O.

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:38.446 A:middle
So, for a full walkthrough of

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:40.016 A:middle
the lifecycle of, of how to make

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:41.536 A:middle
these captures, please refer to

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:42.946 A:middle
the AVCam sample app.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:44.526 A:middle
It has been updated with the

00:05:44.526 --> 00:05:45.786 A:middle
Semantic Segmentation Mattes and

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:47.376 A:middle
will take you through all these

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:48.576 A:middle
different steps.

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:51.696 A:middle
I'm going to hand it over to

00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:53.006 A:middle
David who is going to talk about

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:53.776 A:middle
the Core Image.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:59.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:00.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:01.466 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.456 A:middle
Now that we've learned how to

00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:04.256 A:middle
capture images with Semantic

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:05.696 A:middle
Segmentation Mattes, we get to

00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:07.266 A:middle
have some fun and learn how we

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.456 A:middle
can leverage Core Image to apply

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:10.536 A:middle
some fun effects.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.756 A:middle
Now, I'm going to have a demo

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:13.496 A:middle
next.

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:14.686 A:middle
But I should warn you if--

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:16.386 A:middle
there's clowns in this image.

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:18.736 A:middle
So, if you have any coulrophobia

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.716 A:middle
or irrational fear of clowns,

00:06:21.126 --> 00:06:22.896 A:middle
you know, avert your eyes.

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:23.626 A:middle
All right.

00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:24.616 A:middle
So, here we have an image that

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:26.846 A:middle
was captured in Portrait Mode on

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:27.346 A:middle
a device.

00:06:27.836 --> 00:06:29.406 A:middle
And what we can see in this

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.656 A:middle
application is that we can now

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:33.096 A:middle
very easily see all the

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.476 A:middle
different Semantic Segmentation

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:35.696 A:middle
Mattes that are present in this

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:36.076 A:middle
file.

00:06:36.726 --> 00:06:39.086 A:middle
We can use the-- the traditional

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:42.186 A:middle
Portrait Effects Matte or we can

00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:45.416 A:middle
also see the Skin Matte or we

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:47.736 A:middle
can see-- the Hair Matte or the

00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:48.336 A:middle
Teeth Matte.

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:50.466 A:middle
And it's also possible to use

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:51.736 A:middle
Core Image to combine these

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:53.476 A:middle
various mattes into other

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
mattes, such as this one I've

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:57.096 A:middle
synthesized by using logical

00:06:57.096 --> 00:06:59.676 A:middle
operations to create a matte of

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
just eyes and mouth.

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
just eyes and mouth.

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:02.776 A:middle
If we go back to the main image,

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:04.006 A:middle
however, we see this is a

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:06.046 A:middle
picture of me in Apple Park.

00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:07.486 A:middle
And one of the great things you

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.306 A:middle
could do with Semantic-- with

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:11.586 A:middle
Portrait Effects Mattes is you

00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:13.336 A:middle
could add a background very

00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:13.976 A:middle
easily.

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.656 A:middle
As you can see here, we can put

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:17.586 A:middle
me in a circus tent.

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:19.486 A:middle
And while that really does look

00:07:19.486 --> 00:07:21.666 A:middle
like a circus tent, I don't look

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:22.476 A:middle
like I fit in.

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:24.586 A:middle
So, now we can use some fun

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:25.086 A:middle
effects.

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:27.126 A:middle
For example, we can make it look

00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:28.466 A:middle
like I've got some clown makeup

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:28.706 A:middle
on.

00:07:29.406 --> 00:07:30.476 A:middle
Or if we want to go a little

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:33.486 A:middle
further, we can give myself some

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.096 A:middle
green hair.

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:35.716 A:middle
And lastly, we can use some of

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:37.006 A:middle
these other mattes to give

00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:37.896 A:middle
myself some makeup.

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.596 A:middle
So, that's what I'd like to talk

00:07:41.596 --> 00:07:42.746 A:middle
to you about today, is how we

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:43.566 A:middle
can do these kinds of fun

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:44.726 A:middle
effects in your application.

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:50.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:51.396 A:middle
All right.

00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:54.436 A:middle
So, most of the clown references

00:07:54.436 --> 00:07:55.536 A:middle
are gone now so it's safe to

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:56.646 A:middle
look back.

00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:58.016 A:middle
All right.

00:07:58.016 --> 00:07:58.796 A:middle
So, we're going to be talking

00:07:58.796 --> 00:07:59.856 A:middle
about three things today.

00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:01.846 A:middle
One is how you create matte

00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:01.846 A:middle
One is how you create matte

00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:04.146 A:middle
images using Core Image, how you

00:08:04.146 --> 00:08:05.436 A:middle
can apply filters to those

00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:07.426 A:middle
images, and lastly, how you can

00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:08.696 A:middle
save these into files.

00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:10.626 A:middle
So, firstly, let's talk about

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:12.946 A:middle
creating matte images using Core

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
Image.

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
There are two ways.

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:15.886 A:middle
One if you can create matte

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:18.116 A:middle
images by using the

00:08:18.116 --> 00:08:19.616 A:middle
AVCapturePhoto APIs.

00:08:20.096 --> 00:08:21.696 A:middle
And then, from that, you can

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:23.526 A:middle
create a Core Image.

00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:25.086 A:middle
So, the code for this is very

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:25.486 A:middle
simple.

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:26.796 A:middle
What we're going to be doing is

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:28.226 A:middle
using the Semantic Segmentation

00:08:28.226 --> 00:08:30.416 A:middle
Matte API and specifying that we

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.275 A:middle
want either the hair or the skin

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:32.866 A:middle
or the teeth.

00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:34.946 A:middle
And that returns an

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:36.645 A:middle
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:37.176 A:middle
object.

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.356 A:middle
And from that, it's trivial to

00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:41.275 A:middle
create a CIImage or we can just

00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:43.196 A:middle
substantiate a CIImage from that

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
object.

00:08:44.896 --> 00:08:46.036 A:middle
The other common way you're

00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:47.096 A:middle
going to want to create matte

00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:49.136 A:middle
images is by loading them from a

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:50.836 A:middle
HEIF or a JPG file.

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:53.526 A:middle
These files have a main image

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:54.476 A:middle
which you're familiar with, a

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:56.036 A:middle
typical RGB image.

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:57.956 A:middle
But they also have auxiliary

00:08:57.956 --> 00:08:59.516 A:middle
images such as the Portrait

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:01.736 A:middle
Effects Matte as well as the new

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:01.736 A:middle
Effects Matte as well as the new

00:09:01.736 --> 00:09:03.696 A:middle
mattes that we're talking about,

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:06.216 A:middle
the Skin Segmentation Matte and

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:07.216 A:middle
the Hair and the Teeth.

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:09.306 A:middle
The code for this is very

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:09.706 A:middle
simple.

00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
The traditional code to create a

00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:14.036 A:middle
CIImage from a HEIF file is just

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:16.076 A:middle
to say CIImage and specify a

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:16.316 A:middle
URL.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.566 A:middle
To create these auxiliary

00:09:18.566 --> 00:09:20.236 A:middle
images, all you do is make the

00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:22.166 A:middle
same call and provide an options

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:24.136 A:middle
dictionary specifying which

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:26.196 A:middle
matte image you want to return.

00:09:26.636 --> 00:09:27.796 A:middle
So, we can specify the

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:29.866 A:middle
auxiliarySegmentationHairMatte.

00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:32.396 A:middle
Or if we want, we can get the

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:34.526 A:middle
mattes for the other Semantic

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:35.316 A:middle
Segmentations.

00:09:36.546 --> 00:09:37.416 A:middle
So, very simple.

00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:39.426 A:middle
Just couple lines of code.

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.016 A:middle
The next thing we want to do is

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.246 A:middle
talk about how you can apply

00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:44.686 A:middle
effects to these images.

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:46.906 A:middle
So, I showed a bunch of effects.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:48.086 A:middle
I'm going to talk about one in a

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:49.006 A:middle
little bit of detail.

00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:51.186 A:middle
What we're going to do is we're

00:09:51.186 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
going to start with a base RGB

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:53.206 A:middle
image.

00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:54.716 A:middle
And then, we're going to apply

00:09:54.716 --> 00:09:55.716 A:middle
some effect to that.

00:09:55.716 --> 00:09:57.366 A:middle
Let's say we want to do the

00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:00.196 A:middle
washed-out clown white makeup.

00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:00.196 A:middle
washed-out clown white makeup.

00:10:00.376 --> 00:10:01.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to apply some

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:02.836 A:middle
adjustments to that.

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:04.376 A:middle
Those adjustments, however,

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:05.976 A:middle
apply to the entire image so we

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:07.766 A:middle
want those to be limited to just

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:08.406 A:middle
the skin area.

00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:10.526 A:middle
So, we're going to use the Skin

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:11.946 A:middle
Matte and then, we're going to

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:13.466 A:middle
combine these three images to

00:10:13.466 --> 00:10:14.736 A:middle
produce the result we want.

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:17.526 A:middle
Let me walk you through the code

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:18.506 A:middle
for it because it's actually

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:19.006 A:middle
quite simple.

00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:21.536 A:middle
But first, I want to talk about

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:22.756 A:middle
the top feature request we've

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.296 A:middle
had for Core Image which is to

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:25.536 A:middle
make it easier for people to

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:28.106 A:middle
discover and use the 200 plus

00:10:28.156 --> 00:10:29.386 A:middle
built-in filters we have.

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:31.216 A:middle
And that is the new header

00:10:31.676 --> 00:10:32.596 A:middle
called Core mage

00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:33.936 A:middle
CIFilterBuiltins.

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:35.866 A:middle
And these allow you to use all

00:10:35.866 --> 00:10:37.106 A:middle
of the built-in filters without

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:38.836 A:middle
having to remember the names of

00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:40.026 A:middle
the filters for the names of the

00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:40.366 A:middle
input.

00:10:41.686 --> 00:10:41.836 A:middle
So.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:44.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:46.116 A:middle
It's-- it's really great.

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.046 A:middle
So, let me show you some code

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:49.056 A:middle
that will use this new header.

00:10:49.726 --> 00:10:50.576 A:middle
So, the first thing we're going

00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:51.966 A:middle
to do is create the base image.

00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:52.856 A:middle
And we're just going to call it

00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:54.196 A:middle
image with contents of URL.

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:56.006 A:middle
And that will produce the

00:10:56.006 --> 00:10:57.356 A:middle
traditional RGB image.

00:10:58.166 --> 00:10:59.296 A:middle
Now, we're going to start

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.306 A:middle
applying some effects.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.306 A:middle
applying some effects.

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:01.486 A:middle
So, the first thing I want to do

00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:02.436 A:middle
is I'm going to convert it to

00:11:02.436 --> 00:11:04.296 A:middle
grayscale and I'm going to use a

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.026 A:middle
filter called the

00:11:05.026 --> 00:11:06.016 A:middle
maximumComponent.

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:08.116 A:middle
And I'm going to give that

00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:09.576 A:middle
filter an input image of the

00:11:09.576 --> 00:11:10.216 A:middle
base image.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:11.926 A:middle
And then, I'm going to ask for

00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:13.036 A:middle
that filter's output.

00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:15.056 A:middle
And that produces the image that

00:11:15.056 --> 00:11:16.416 A:middle
looks grayscale like this.

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:18.716 A:middle
This doesn't look quite bright

00:11:18.716 --> 00:11:20.066 A:middle
enough to look like clown

00:11:20.066 --> 00:11:20.436 A:middle
makeup.

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:21.636 A:middle
So, we're going to apply an

00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:22.446 A:middle
additional filter.

00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:23.926 A:middle
We're going to say use the gamma

00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:24.766 A:middle
adjustment filter.

00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:26.896 A:middle
And the input to this will be

00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:28.686 A:middle
the previous filter's output.

00:11:28.686 --> 00:11:30.386 A:middle
And then, we're going to specify

00:11:30.666 --> 00:11:32.656 A:middle
the power for the gamma function

00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:35.296 A:middle
and ask for the output image.

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:37.466 A:middle
And you'll notice it's now very

00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:39.716 A:middle
easy to specify the power for

00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:40.506 A:middle
the gamma filter.

00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:42.086 A:middle
It's a Float rather than having

00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:43.556 A:middle
to remember to use NSNumber.

00:11:43.556 --> 00:11:47.106 A:middle
So, that's the first part of our

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:47.386 A:middle
effect.

00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:51.146 A:middle
The next thing we want to do is

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.046 A:middle
start by getting this Skin

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:54.876 A:middle
Segmentation Matte.

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:56.286 A:middle
So, again, as I described

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:57.286 A:middle
earlier, we're going to start

00:11:57.286 --> 00:11:59.036 A:middle
with the URL to specify that we

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:00.746 A:middle
want the Skin Matte.

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:00.746 A:middle
want the Skin Matte.

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:03.366 A:middle
However, when we get this image,

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:05.226 A:middle
notice it's smaller than the

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:05.716 A:middle
other image.

00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:06.716 A:middle
As we mentioned before, these

00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:07.866 A:middle
are half size by default.

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:11.096 A:middle
So, we need to scale it up to

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:12.626 A:middle
match the image, main image

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:12.916 A:middle
size.

00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:14.176 A:middle
So, we're going to create a

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.666 A:middle
CGAffineTransform that scales

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:16.956 A:middle
from the matte's size to the

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:18.146 A:middle
base image size.

00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.216 A:middle
And then, we're going to apply a

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:21.416 A:middle
transform to the image.

00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:22.726 A:middle
And that produces a new image

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:24.906 A:middle
which, as you expect, matches

00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:25.726 A:middle
the correct size.

00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:28.466 A:middle
The next step we're going to do

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:30.586 A:middle
is start combining these two.

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:32.596 A:middle
And we're going to use the

00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:33.946 A:middle
blendWithMask filter.

00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:35.176 A:middle
And this is great and we use

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:36.536 A:middle
this throughout the sample I

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:36.936 A:middle
just showed.

00:12:37.936 --> 00:12:38.966 A:middle
We're going to specify the

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:40.416 A:middle
background image to be the base

00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:42.776 A:middle
RGB image which looks like this.

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:44.836 A:middle
Next, we're going to specify the

00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:46.506 A:middle
input image which will be the

00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:48.126 A:middle
foreground image which is the

00:12:48.126 --> 00:12:49.986 A:middle
image which has the-- the white

00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:50.726 A:middle
makeup applied.

00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:52.426 A:middle
And lastly, we're going to

00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:55.716 A:middle
specify a mask image which is

00:12:55.936 --> 00:12:57.346 A:middle
the image that I showed

00:12:58.046 --> 00:12:58.496 A:middle
previously.

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:00.756 A:middle
Given these three inputs, you

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:00.756 A:middle
Given these three inputs, you

00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:02.246 A:middle
can ask the blend filter for its

00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:04.096 A:middle
output and the result looks like

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:04.446 A:middle
this.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:06.056 A:middle
Now, as you can see, this is

00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:06.926 A:middle
just the starting point.

00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:07.936 A:middle
You can combine all sort of

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:10.036 A:middle
interesting effects to produce

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:10.966 A:middle
great results in your

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:11.466 A:middle
application.

00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:15.396 A:middle
Once you're done applying these

00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:16.426 A:middle
effects, you want to save them.

00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:18.936 A:middle
And, most typically, you want to

00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:21.046 A:middle
save them as a HEIF or a JPG

00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:22.476 A:middle
file which supports saving

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:24.406 A:middle
auxiliary images, as well.

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.196 A:middle
So, in addition to the main

00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.006 A:middle
image, you can also store the

00:13:28.156 --> 00:13:30.006 A:middle
Semantic Segmentation Mattes so

00:13:30.006 --> 00:13:31.716 A:middle
that either your application or

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:33.456 A:middle
other applications can apply

00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:34.366 A:middle
additional effects.

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:37.216 A:middle
The code for this is very

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:37.586 A:middle
simple.

00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:39.776 A:middle
You use the Core Image API

00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.366 A:middle
writeHEIFRepresentation.

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:43.606 A:middle
And typically, you specify the

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.276 A:middle
main image, the URL that you

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:48.136 A:middle
want to save it to, and then the

00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:49.766 A:middle
pixel format that you want it to

00:13:49.766 --> 00:13:51.646 A:middle
be saved as, and the colorSpace

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:52.656 A:middle
you want it to be saved as.

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:54.226 A:middle
And what I want to highlight

00:13:54.226 --> 00:13:56.166 A:middle
today is another set of options

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.506 A:middle
that you can provide when you're

00:13:57.506 --> 00:13:58.326 A:middle
saving the image.

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
So, for example, you can specify

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
So, for example, you can specify

00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
the key

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:02.756 A:middle
semanticSegmentationSkinMatte

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:05.686 A:middle
and specify the skinImage or the

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:07.386 A:middle
hairImage or the teethImage.

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:09.036 A:middle
And all four of these images

00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:10.536 A:middle
will be saved into the resulting

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:12.246 A:middle
HEIF or JPG file.

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:14.686 A:middle
Now, there's an alternate way of

00:14:14.746 --> 00:14:16.726 A:middle
getting this result, which is,

00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:18.086 A:middle
if you want, you can save the

00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:20.626 A:middle
main images and specify the

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:21.936 A:middle
segmentation mattes as

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:23.646 A:middle
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:24.196 A:middle
objects.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.066 A:middle
This again, the API is very

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:26.456 A:middle
simple.

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:29.016 A:middle
You specify the-- the URL, the

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:31.056 A:middle
primary image, the pixel format,

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:32.306 A:middle
and the color space.

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.126 A:middle
In this case, if you want to

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.486 A:middle
specify these objects to be

00:14:35.486 --> 00:14:37.776 A:middle
saved in the file, you just say

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.376 A:middle
AVSemanticSegmentationMattes and

00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:40.986 A:middle
you provide an array of mattes.

00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:45.676 A:middle
So, that's what you can do using

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.776 A:middle
Core Image with these mattes.

00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:48.296 A:middle
What I talked about today is how

00:14:48.296 --> 00:14:50.646 A:middle
to create images for-- for

00:14:50.746 --> 00:14:52.456 A:middle
mattes, how to apply filters,

00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:53.436 A:middle
and how to save them.

00:14:53.756 --> 00:14:54.906 A:middle
I will, however, mention that

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:56.616 A:middle
the sample app I showed you has

00:14:56.616 --> 00:14:58.316 A:middle
been written as a Photos App

00:14:58.316 --> 00:14:58.796 A:middle
plug-in.

00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.236 A:middle
And if you want to learn about

00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.236 A:middle
And if you want to learn about

00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:01.346 A:middle
how you can do that in your

00:15:01.346 --> 00:15:03.176 A:middle
application so that you can save

00:15:03.176 --> 00:15:04.596 A:middle
these images, not just to HEIFs

00:15:04.646 --> 00:15:06.226 A:middle
but, also, into the user's Photo

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:08.596 A:middle
library, I recommend you consult

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.326 A:middle
these earlier presentations.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.846 A:middle
Especially, the "Introduction to

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.836 A:middle
the Photos Frameworks" from WWDC

00:15:13.836 --> 00:15:16.866 A:middle
in 2014.

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:17.276 A:middle
All right.

00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:18.556 A:middle
And thank you all, very much, I

00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:19.606 A:middle
really look forward to seeing

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:20.436 A:middle
what you do with these great

00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:20.636 A:middle
features.

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:20.866 A:middle
Thanks.
