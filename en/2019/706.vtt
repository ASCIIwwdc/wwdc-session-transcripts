00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:20.906 A:middle
My name is Gokul and together

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:22.846 A:middle
with my colleagues Dima and

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:24.916 A:middle
Jonathan, we are really excited

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.616 A:middle
to tell you all about Sign In

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:27.216 A:middle
with Apple.

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:30.196 A:middle
I will start with an overview of

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.416 A:middle
the key features of Sign In with

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.486 A:middle
Apple, then Dima will talk

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:34.966 A:middle
through how you can integrate

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.696 A:middle
this into your native app.

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:39.166 A:middle
Jonathan will demo that live

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:39.916 A:middle
here.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:41.976 A:middle
And finally, we'll discuss

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:44.756 A:middle
cross-platform and close out

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:45.966 A:middle
with some best practices.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.236 A:middle
Sign In with Apple is fast, easy

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.536 A:middle
account setup and sign in for

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:56.366 A:middle
your application.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:01.206 A:middle
It is secure and it's private,

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:01.206 A:middle
It is secure and it's private,

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:04.806 A:middle
both for your users and for your

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:05.316 A:middle
privacy.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:07.526 A:middle
It's not Apple's business to

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:10.056 A:middle
know how you engage with your

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.326 A:middle
users in your app.

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:13.386 A:middle
So you can implement Sign In

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.576 A:middle
with Apple with confidence that

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.976 A:middle
Apple simply won't track any of

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:18.606 A:middle
that.

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:21.576 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at the

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.876 A:middle
experience when your user taps

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:25.096 A:middle
on that button.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.456 A:middle
They see a sheet pre-filled with

00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:30.226 A:middle
information that you request,

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.656 A:middle
like name and email.

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:36.656 A:middle
The user can make a choice on

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:38.206 A:middle
which email they want to share.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:45.556 A:middle
They tap Continue and that's it.

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:47.776 A:middle
They are signed into your

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:48.456 A:middle
application.

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:52.746 A:middle
Your app gets a unique, stable

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:58.296 A:middle
ID, a name and a verified email

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.716 A:middle
address that you can reach for

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.716 A:middle
address that you can reach for

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:01.116 A:middle
the user.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:04.326 A:middle
And best of all, this is a

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:07.276 A:middle
secure two-factor authenticated

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:09.116 A:middle
account for the user in your

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:09.806 A:middle
app.

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:10.485 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:18.946 A:middle
And even better, this all works

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:21.326 A:middle
seamlessly across all of the

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:22.286 A:middle
user's devices.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.266 A:middle
On a new device, a simple tap

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.456 A:middle
gets them going with the same

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:30.456 A:middle
account as before in your app

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:33.186 A:middle
and ready to fully engage again.

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:34.966 A:middle
Very fast, very easy.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.466 A:middle
So Sign In with Apple provides

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.546 A:middle
really streamlined account setup

00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:42.796 A:middle
experience for your app.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.196 A:middle
Notice there are no cumbersome

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.456 A:middle
forms to fill out.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:46.306 A:middle
Just a simple tap.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:50.716 A:middle
Users downloaded your app from

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:52.706 A:middle
the Store using their Apple ID

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:53.526 A:middle
already.

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:55.406 A:middle
And Sign In with Apple helps

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.856 A:middle
them engage fully with just a

00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.726 A:middle
tap in your app.

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:03.636 A:middle
You also get a verified email

00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:05.456 A:middle
address that you can use to

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:06.586 A:middle
communicate with the user.

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:09.316 A:middle
Now this is the email address

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.356 A:middle
that Apple uses for its

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
communication.

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:15.266 A:middle
So no need to do these

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.666 A:middle
cumbersome round trips of

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.176 A:middle
sending email and having users

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:20.036 A:middle
click on links.

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:22.916 A:middle
Apple has already done that work

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:23.266 A:middle
for you.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.686 A:middle
Sign In with Apple provides you

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:28.896 A:middle
instantly with an email that

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.676 A:middle
just works.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.346 A:middle
No additional verification

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:31.876 A:middle
required.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.966 A:middle
Now some users may feel less

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.666 A:middle
comfortable sharing their real

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:38.406 A:middle
email address.

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:40.466 A:middle
And you may end up with some

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.146 A:middle
fake emails that don't work.

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:44.526 A:middle
And Sign In with Apple helps you

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:45.016 A:middle
with that.

00:03:46.016 --> 00:03:48.436 A:middle
Hide My Email option enables

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:50.896 A:middle
these users to share a hidden

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:53.716 A:middle
email address that routes to

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:55.596 A:middle
their verified email inbox.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:58.986 A:middle
This is great.

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.976 A:middle
Now this is enabled through

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.976 A:middle
Now this is enabled through

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
Apple's Private Email Relay

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:06.026 A:middle
system that forwards the email

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
to the verified email for the

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.386 A:middle
user and it can handle replies

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:11.586 A:middle
too.

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:12.866 A:middle
So it works both ways.

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:16.375 A:middle
And you can use this for any

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.016 A:middle
kind of business communication

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:19.856 A:middle
for your app.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.846 A:middle
Apple does not retain any

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:23.796 A:middle
messages once they're delivered

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.206 A:middle
to the user's inbox.

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:28.936 A:middle
In summary, a verified email

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:31.966 A:middle
that works available instantly

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:32.976 A:middle
to your app.

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.836 A:middle
With Sign In with Apple there

00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:42.156 A:middle
are no new passwords to remember

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:42.976 A:middle
or forget.

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:46.396 A:middle
So it's already more secure.

00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:50.866 A:middle
Even better, every account that

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:52.966 A:middle
your app receives is two-factor

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:54.266 A:middle
authentication protected.

00:04:55.186 --> 00:04:56.866 A:middle
This is just the best account

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:57.716 A:middle
for your app.

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:00.346 A:middle
No password, two-factor

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:00.346 A:middle
No password, two-factor

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:02.746 A:middle
authentication, no cost to you

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:04.776 A:middle
and no added friction to the

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:05.236 A:middle
user.

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:08.206 A:middle
Great built-in security with

00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:09.686 A:middle
Sign In with Apple.

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.536 A:middle
Now combatting account fraud in

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:15.196 A:middle
your systems is a difficult

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:17.426 A:middle
problem, and Apple is in a

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:20.746 A:middle
unique position to help.

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:22.976 A:middle
Sign In with Apple includes a

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:25.946 A:middle
new privacy-friendly way for you

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:28.386 A:middle
to gain confidence that the user

00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:30.426 A:middle
on your app is indeed real.

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.776 A:middle
It combines sophisticated

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:35.656 A:middle
on-device intelligence with

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:38.816 A:middle
account information, and

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:40.616 A:middle
abstracts that into a single

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:43.196 A:middle
bit: real user or unknown.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.526 A:middle
Real users, give them the red

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:47.886 A:middle
carpet treatment in your app

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:48.616 A:middle
they deserve.

00:05:49.946 --> 00:05:51.316 A:middle
This is a high confidence

00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:51.906 A:middle
indicator.

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:55.846 A:middle
If you receive unknown, it could

00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:58.306 A:middle
be a user, it could be a bot.

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:01.216 A:middle
Treat this user like you would

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:01.216 A:middle
Treat this user like you would

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:02.786 A:middle
treat any other new account in

00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:04.576 A:middle
your system where you don't have

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:05.986 A:middle
enough information to make a

00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:06.366 A:middle
decision.

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:09.226 A:middle
So this is the real user

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:11.406 A:middle
indicator helping you fight

00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
account fraud.

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
Finally, Sign In with Apple is

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:19.836 A:middle
cross-platform.

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:23.546 A:middle
The API is available on all

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
Apple platforms: iOS, MacOS,

00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:27.636 A:middle
WatchOS, tvOS.

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.876 A:middle
The sign-in experience is

00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:32.536 A:middle
tailored on each platform for

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:33.336 A:middle
ease of use.

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:36.966 A:middle
The JavaScript API enables you

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:38.616 A:middle
to use Sign In with Apple on the

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.726 A:middle
web as well as other platforms

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:42.526 A:middle
like Windows or Android.

00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:44.316 A:middle
We'll talk about this in more

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:44.976 A:middle
detail later.

[ Applause ]

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:53.386 A:middle
Streamlined account setup,

verified email address, built-in

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:58.996 A:middle
security, anti-fraud and

00:06:58.996 --> 00:06:59.906 A:middle
cross-platform.

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:02.256 A:middle
That's a very quick summary of

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:04.166 A:middle
the key features of Sign In with

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:04.516 A:middle
Apple.

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:06.696 A:middle
Next, Dima's going to join me

00:07:06.696 --> 00:07:08.336 A:middle
onstage to talk through how you

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
can integrate this into your

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:10.716 A:middle
native app.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:11.216 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:15.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Gokul.

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:17.026 A:middle
Hi, folks.

00:07:17.826 --> 00:07:19.146 A:middle
So you've seen this great

00:07:19.636 --> 00:07:19.976 A:middle
feature.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.536 A:middle
What does it actually take to

00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:22.656 A:middle
integrate into your app?

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:28.006 A:middle
There are four key things that

00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:29.056 A:middle
your app needs to do to hit the

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:29.616 A:middle
ground running.

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:31.856 A:middle
First, Auto Sign In with

00:07:31.856 --> 00:07:32.816 A:middle
Apple-branded button.

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
Then configure and perform an

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:36.896 A:middle
authorization request.

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:40.156 A:middle
After the user sees the Sign In

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:41.496 A:middle
with Apple UI and after a quick

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.446 A:middle
FaceID check, the results of the

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:44.556 A:middle
authorization will be returned

00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:46.596 A:middle
back to your app.

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:48.816 A:middle
At this point you need to verify

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:50.036 A:middle
the results with the Apple ID

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.606 A:middle
servers and create an account in

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:51.976 A:middle
your system.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.966 A:middle
Last but not least, the

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.546 A:middle
credential state may change

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:58.956 A:middle
after it is returned to your app

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
and your application needs to

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
and your application needs to

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:01.646 A:middle
handle those state changes

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:02.056 A:middle
gracefully.

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:08.176 A:middle
First, let's look into the Sign

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:10.236 A:middle
In with Apple button.

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.416 A:middle
With only a couple lines of

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.656 A:middle
code, you can add an

00:08:13.656 --> 00:08:14.816 A:middle
AuthorizationAppleIDButton to

00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:15.886 A:middle
your app.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.766 A:middle
Once you initialize it, add an

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:21.116 A:middle
action.

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:24.876 A:middle
And that's all you need to do.

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.856 A:middle
The button supports several

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:28.026 A:middle
different customizations to fit

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:28.786 A:middle
your app's design.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:30.946 A:middle
Different visual styles and

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:32.256 A:middle
different labels are available.

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:35.966 A:middle
Apps that currently use valid

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:37.216 A:middle
APIs will find this very

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:37.616 A:middle
familiar.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.566 A:middle
Next, once the user performs the

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:48.026 A:middle
action, you need to configure a

00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:49.386 A:middle
request and perform

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:49.926 A:middle
authorization.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.196 A:middle
Here's how you do it.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.936 A:middle
With only one line of code, you

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
initialize an Apple ID

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.066 A:middle
Authorization request.

00:09:00.426 --> 00:09:01.806 A:middle
This is all your app needs to

00:09:01.806 --> 00:09:02.766 A:middle
create an account in your

00:09:02.766 --> 00:09:03.186 A:middle
system.

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
Optionally, if your app requires

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:07.586 A:middle
this for the best user

00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:08.976 A:middle
experience, you can set

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:10.426 A:middle
requestedScopes for full name

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
and email.

00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:13.556 A:middle
You should only request this

00:09:13.556 --> 00:09:14.746 A:middle
information if it's truly

00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:16.496 A:middle
required for your app and err on

00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:17.536 A:middle
the side of minimum amount of

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:18.076 A:middle
information.

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:21.006 A:middle
Once the request is configured,

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:22.646 A:middle
initialize

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:26.556 A:middle
AuthorizationController, set the

00:09:26.556 --> 00:09:28.576 A:middle
delegates to get the results

00:09:28.576 --> 00:09:30.416 A:middle
back into your app.

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:32.706 A:middle
And last but not least, perform

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:33.146 A:middle
the request.

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:35.366 A:middle
Once you perform the request,

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:36.666 A:middle
this will initiate an

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:37.986 A:middle
authorization UI to be presented

00:09:37.986 --> 00:09:38.456 A:middle
to the user.

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:40.436 A:middle
After a quick FaceID check, an

00:09:41.066 --> 00:09:42.306 A:middle
authorization result will be

00:09:42.306 --> 00:09:43.146 A:middle
returned to your app.

00:09:43.776 --> 00:09:44.736 A:middle
Let's talk about handling these

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:44.976 A:middle
results.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:48.386 A:middle
Through an

00:09:48.386 --> 00:09:49.446 A:middle
AuthorizationController

00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:50.656 A:middle
didCompleteWithAuthorization

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.036 A:middle
method, you will get an

00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:52.996 A:middle
authorization object.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:54.846 A:middle
This object has a credential

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
property of type

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.426 A:middle
AppleIDCredential.

00:09:57.926 --> 00:09:58.826 A:middle
You should check that this is

00:09:58.826 --> 00:09:59.916 A:middle
actually an AppleIDCredential

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:00.806 A:middle
before processing that.

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:00.806 A:middle
before processing that.

00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:02.936 A:middle
This object has all the

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.156 A:middle
information that is required to

00:10:04.156 --> 00:10:05.076 A:middle
create an account in your

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:05.466 A:middle
system.

00:10:06.056 --> 00:10:09.036 A:middle
If the user cancels the request

00:10:09.036 --> 00:10:10.556 A:middle
or any other error occurs, we

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.486 A:middle
will let your app know through

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:13.306 A:middle
the didCompleteWithError

00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:13.756 A:middle
callback.

00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:16.296 A:middle
Both of these delegate callbacks

00:10:16.296 --> 00:10:17.676 A:middle
are guaranteed to be made on

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:18.756 A:middle
your app's main queue.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.806 A:middle
So let's dive deeper into the

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.926 A:middle
results that we will give to

00:10:24.926 --> 00:10:25.966 A:middle
your app.

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:30.796 A:middle
First, the user identifier.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.916 A:middle
This is a unique, stable,

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:34.476 A:middle
team-scoped user identifier.

00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:37.186 A:middle
This is great.

00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:38.676 A:middle
You can use it to retrieve

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:39.946 A:middle
information from your user

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:41.086 A:middle
systems across different

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:43.366 A:middle
platforms, different systems,

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:44.746 A:middle
the web, Android.

00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:46.956 A:middle
It remains stable across all of

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:47.046 A:middle
them.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.506 A:middle
And it is associated with your

00:10:48.506 --> 00:10:49.266 A:middle
developer team.

00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:51.596 A:middle
This is the key to your user.

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:53.856 A:middle
Next, we will return

00:10:53.906 --> 00:10:55.826 A:middle
verification data, an identity

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:57.476 A:middle
token and authorization code.

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.156 A:middle
A short-lived token that you can

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:01.046 A:middle
use with Apple ID servers to

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:01.046 A:middle
use with Apple ID servers to

00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:02.156 A:middle
exchange for a refresh token.

00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.226 A:middle
If you integrate with existing

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:05.906 A:middle
auth systems, adapting Sign In

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.226 A:middle
with Apple will be very

00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:07.726 A:middle
familiar.

00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:11.856 A:middle
Optionally, we will return

00:11:11.986 --> 00:11:13.056 A:middle
account information if you

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:15.456 A:middle
requested it, a name and a

00:11:15.456 --> 00:11:16.256 A:middle
verified email.

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:18.176 A:middle
And since the email is verified

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:19.496 A:middle
by Apple, your apps no longer

00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:20.546 A:middle
need to perform any sort of

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.376 A:middle
verification after we have shown

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:22.936 A:middle
it to you.

00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:26.486 A:middle
Lastly, a real user indicator,

00:11:27.766 --> 00:11:28.786 A:middle
as was mentioned earlier.

00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:30.706 A:middle
Use this to streamline your

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:31.596 A:middle
sign-in experience.

00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:36.166 A:middle
So now you've created an account

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:36.936 A:middle
in your system.

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:39.386 A:middle
As the user uses Apple devices

00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:41.006 A:middle
in your app, the credential

00:11:41.006 --> 00:11:42.136 A:middle
state may change.

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:43.896 A:middle
And you need to handle those

00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:44.696 A:middle
scenarios gracefully.

00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:48.566 A:middle
The user may stop using Apple ID

00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:49.066 A:middle
with an app.

00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:51.126 A:middle
They may sign out of the device.

00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:54.236 A:middle
Events like this should be

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:54.996 A:middle
handled gracefully.

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:56.666 A:middle
To allow this, authentication

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:57.926 A:middle
services framework exposes a

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.596 A:middle
fast API to allow you to query

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.596 A:middle
fast API to allow you to query

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:00.976 A:middle
this state.

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:05.046 A:middle
Using the user identifier that

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:06.246 A:middle
was previously returned through

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:08.916 A:middle
an Apple ID Credential, you can

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.796 A:middle
check GetCredentialState call to

00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:12.366 A:middle
get the state of the current

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:13.056 A:middle
Apple ID Credential.

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:15.126 A:middle
It's a very fast API call.

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:17.246 A:middle
It can return three things.

00:12:18.126 --> 00:12:19.116 A:middle
We may tell you the user is

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.326 A:middle
authorized, and you should let

00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:21.656 A:middle
them continue using your app.

00:12:23.216 --> 00:12:24.546 A:middle
The credential may be revoked.

00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:28.096 A:middle
You should sign the user out of

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:29.836 A:middle
your app on this device and

00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:31.836 A:middle
optionally guide them to sign

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.926 A:middle
back in again.

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:35.996 A:middle
NotFound means that the user has

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:37.006 A:middle
not previously established the

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.406 A:middle
relationship through Sign In

00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:38.806 A:middle
with Apple.

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:41.616 A:middle
This API is very fast.

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:43.256 A:middle
You should call it on your app's

00:12:43.256 --> 00:12:44.716 A:middle
launch to make sure that you

00:12:44.716 --> 00:12:45.846 A:middle
provide a tailored experience

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:46.816 A:middle
for each of these states.

00:12:49.126 --> 00:12:50.576 A:middle
Additionally, we expose a

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:51.386 A:middle
notification through

00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:53.116 A:middle
NotificationCenter to let you

00:12:53.116 --> 00:12:54.596 A:middle
know when this credential state

00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:55.566 A:middle
changed to revoked.

00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:57.826 A:middle
Sign the user out on this device

00:12:58.326 --> 00:12:59.746 A:middle
and optionally guide them to

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:00.566 A:middle
sign back in again.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:00.566 A:middle
sign back in again.

00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:04.236 A:middle
Now the user has established the

00:13:04.236 --> 00:13:05.266 A:middle
relationship with your app,

00:13:05.406 --> 00:13:06.096 A:middle
they're using the app, they

00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:06.836 A:middle
create an account.

00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:08.396 A:middle
Inevitably they'll get another

00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:09.856 A:middle
device and they'll want to use

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:10.496 A:middle
your app again.

00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:12.546 A:middle
Let's talk about that and how

00:13:12.546 --> 00:13:13.566 A:middle
Sign In with Apple helps you

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:13.766 A:middle
there.

00:13:14.776 --> 00:13:15.796 A:middle
When a user comes back to your

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.616 A:middle
app on a new device, they will

00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:19.686 A:middle
get a one tap sign in

00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:20.296 A:middle
experience.

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:22.736 A:middle
After a quick FaceID check,

00:13:23.046 --> 00:13:25.046 A:middle
they're back into your app.

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:29.856 A:middle
In addition to that, we know you

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:30.876 A:middle
have existing accounts in your

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:31.446 A:middle
systems.

00:13:32.216 --> 00:13:33.866 A:middle
So now we support iCloud

00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:35.256 A:middle
Keychain passwords through the

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:36.096 A:middle
same API.

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:37.236 A:middle
You should request

00:13:37.236 --> 00:13:38.376 A:middle
authentication with both Apple

00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:39.776 A:middle
ID and iCloud Keychain requests.

00:13:40.516 --> 00:13:41.476 A:middle
The user will be offered to

00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:42.796 A:middle
continue using their existing

00:13:42.796 --> 00:13:44.426 A:middle
credential, whichever they have.

00:13:45.306 --> 00:13:46.676 A:middle
And if an error is returned,

00:13:47.116 --> 00:13:48.466 A:middle
show your regular sign-in flows.

00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:50.966 A:middle
For best user experience, your

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:52.426 A:middle
app should call into this

00:13:52.426 --> 00:13:54.686 A:middle
startup function if it does not

00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:55.936 A:middle
have an existing local account.

00:13:57.186 --> 00:13:58.286 A:middle
So let's look at how easy it is

00:13:58.286 --> 00:13:58.976 A:middle
to implement this.

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:05.136 A:middle
First, initialize a request

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.816 A:middle
array with an Apple ID

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:10.476 A:middle
authorization request and an

00:14:10.476 --> 00:14:11.626 A:middle
Apple ID password request.

00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:13.396 A:middle
That's it.

00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:14.686 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:17.826 A:middle
Pass the request array and

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:18.976 A:middle
perform the request.

00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:23.516 A:middle
If an existing Sign In with

00:14:23.516 --> 00:14:25.036 A:middle
Apple connection exists, an

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:26.216 A:middle
AppleIDCredential will be

00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:27.726 A:middle
returned to your app.

00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:31.606 A:middle
If the user has a stored iCloud

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:33.346 A:middle
Keychain password, that

00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:34.526 A:middle
credential will be returned to

00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:35.426 A:middle
your app.

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.646 A:middle
You should use the credential

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:38.126 A:middle
that you get from this API to

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:38.936 A:middle
sign the user in.

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:41.696 A:middle
If the user has no existing

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:43.526 A:middle
credentials, the API will return

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:44.666 A:middle
an error immediately and you

00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.006 A:middle
should show your standard login

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:46.326 A:middle
flows.

00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:49.316 A:middle
By performing these requests on

00:14:49.316 --> 00:14:51.766 A:middle
startup, you will prevent

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.006 A:middle
account duplication within your

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:55.436 A:middle
systems and streamline the user

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.676 A:middle
experience of getting back into

00:14:56.676 --> 00:14:57.816 A:middle
your app and start to use it.

00:15:00.276 --> 00:15:01.706 A:middle
Now I'd like to call Jonathan

00:15:01.706 --> 00:15:03.396 A:middle
onstage to demo how easy it is

00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:04.596 A:middle
to build this.

00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:08.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:09.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dima.

00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:10.766 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.116 A:middle
Sign In with Apple simplifies

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:14.636 A:middle
how users create an account or

00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:15.866 A:middle
sign into an app while

00:15:15.866 --> 00:15:17.026 A:middle
maintaining strong account

00:15:17.026 --> 00:15:17.486 A:middle
security.

00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:19.696 A:middle
Password autofill and automatic

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.126 A:middle
strong passwords enables you to

00:15:21.126 --> 00:15:22.126 A:middle
do some of this already.

00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:24.416 A:middle
Sign In with Apple improves upon

00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:25.656 A:middle
them further and you can

00:15:25.656 --> 00:15:27.066 A:middle
integrate with password autofill

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:29.046 A:middle
passwords using the same native

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:30.596 A:middle
API as Sign In with Apple.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.616 A:middle
I'm going to take you through

00:15:32.676 --> 00:15:34.556 A:middle
three topics to get your users

00:15:34.556 --> 00:15:36.416 A:middle
signed into your app using their

00:15:36.416 --> 00:15:36.996 A:middle
Apple ID.

00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:39.606 A:middle
First, I'll add the Sign In with

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.146 A:middle
Apple button to a login form.

00:15:41.906 --> 00:15:43.146 A:middle
Then I'm going to show you how

00:15:43.146 --> 00:15:44.576 A:middle
to implement the Quick Sign In

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.826 A:middle
flow which allows users to sign

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:49.366 A:middle
into existing credentials using

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:49.876 A:middle
just one tap.

00:15:50.696 --> 00:15:52.306 A:middle
Last, I'll show you how to check

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:54.296 A:middle
the credential status of a user

00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:56.446 A:middle
identifier after app launch to

00:15:56.446 --> 00:15:57.836 A:middle
ensure your users are properly

00:15:57.836 --> 00:15:58.936 A:middle
signed in.

00:16:00.536 --> 00:16:02.916 A:middle
To show you all this, I have a

00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:03.336 A:middle
test app.

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.106 A:middle
It's called Juice.

00:16:05.376 --> 00:16:06.746 A:middle
Here you can see a typical login

00:16:06.746 --> 00:16:07.876 A:middle
form with the email and

00:16:07.876 --> 00:16:08.286 A:middle
password.

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:10.246 A:middle
We're going to add another

00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:11.886 A:middle
option below it, Sign In with

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:12.136 A:middle
Apple.

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:14.366 A:middle
So let's get going.

00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:16.496 A:middle
We have one prerequisite to

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:17.836 A:middle
fulfill in our project settings

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:19.236 A:middle
and that's to add the Sign In

00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:20.306 A:middle
with Apple capability.

00:16:23.376 --> 00:16:24.976 A:middle
So in your project settings,

00:16:25.096 --> 00:16:25.796 A:middle
you'll want to select your

00:16:25.796 --> 00:16:27.876 A:middle
application and go to the Sign

00:16:27.876 --> 00:16:29.176 A:middle
In and Capabilities section.

00:16:29.966 --> 00:16:31.336 A:middle
I've already added the Sign In

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:32.686 A:middle
with Apple capability here.

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:35.786 A:middle
To add it in your app, go ahead

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:36.916 A:middle
and click on the Capability

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.246 A:middle
button and then search for Sign

00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:38.776 A:middle
In with Apple.

00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:42.446 A:middle
When you do this, Xcode is going

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:43.766 A:middle
to add the appropriate entry

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:44.866 A:middle
into your app's entitlement

00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:45.176 A:middle
file.

00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.576 A:middle
This will then check that you've

00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:49.006 A:middle
added the Sign In with Apple

00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:51.096 A:middle
capability to your Apple ID in

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:51.906 A:middle
the Developer Portal.

00:16:55.066 --> 00:16:56.296 A:middle
If you haven't done so already,

00:16:56.446 --> 00:16:57.836 A:middle
you'll want to go ahead and sign

00:16:57.836 --> 00:16:59.336 A:middle
into the Developer Portal and

00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:00.336 A:middle
make sure that you've added this

00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:00.336 A:middle
make sure that you've added this

00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:00.906 A:middle
capability.

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:07.536 A:middle
So while here, I'd like to

00:17:07.536 --> 00:17:09.175 A:middle
highlight the Associated Domains

00:17:09.215 --> 00:17:10.626 A:middle
Capability seen over here.

00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:13.396 A:middle
This will make sure that you get

00:17:13.435 --> 00:17:15.576 A:middle
passwords back in your

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.215 A:middle
credential and presented to the

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:18.596 A:middle
user when you make an

00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:20.476 A:middle
ASAuthorizationPassword request.

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.086 A:middle
I'll show you how to add one of

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:23.076 A:middle
those requests later in the

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:23.366 A:middle
demo.

00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:25.836 A:middle
If you want your password

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.695 A:middle
request to provide exactly the

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:29.406 A:middle
right credentials, refer to the

00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:32.176 A:middle
2017 session Password Autofill

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.306 A:middle
for Apps, as well as Thursday's

00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:35.766 A:middle
session What's New in

00:17:35.766 --> 00:17:36.506 A:middle
Authentication.

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:38.646 A:middle
So I'm going to head back to

00:17:38.646 --> 00:17:40.556 A:middle
Xcode and we're going to take a

00:17:40.556 --> 00:17:41.926 A:middle
look at the Juice app.

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:45.976 A:middle
As you can see, this is just a

00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:48.106 A:middle
simple demo app to highlight

00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:49.246 A:middle
some of the key features of this

00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:49.556 A:middle
API.

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:52.816 A:middle
Below this or label I have a

00:17:52.816 --> 00:17:55.176 A:middle
Stack View that is called Login

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.076 A:middle
Provider Stack View.

00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:58.256 A:middle
This is where we're going to add

00:17:58.256 --> 00:17:59.926 A:middle
the Sign In with Apple button.

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.836 A:middle
Adding the Sign In with Apple

00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:05.226 A:middle
button will be accomplished in

00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:06.046 A:middle
three steps.

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:08.356 A:middle
First, I'll add the Sign In with

00:18:08.356 --> 00:18:09.606 A:middle
Apple button to our Provider

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:10.086 A:middle
Stack View.

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:12.236 A:middle
Then I'm going to define a

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:13.456 A:middle
function that will create and

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:15.126 A:middle
perform the request when the

00:18:15.126 --> 00:18:15.776 A:middle
button is tapped.

00:18:15.776 --> 00:18:18.146 A:middle
And then last, we'll adopt the

00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:19.626 A:middle
necessary authentication

00:18:19.626 --> 00:18:21.026 A:middle
services protocols which will

00:18:21.026 --> 00:18:22.166 A:middle
provide us with results.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.216 A:middle
So let's get started by adding

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:26.456 A:middle
the Sign In with Apple button to

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.376 A:middle
our UI and to do that let's take

00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:28.726 A:middle
a look at the

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:30.216 A:middle
LoginViewController Swift file.

00:18:36.046 --> 00:18:37.336 A:middle
So we'll be working with the

00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:38.886 A:middle
AuthenticationServices module,

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:40.076 A:middle
so we'll go ahead and import

00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:41.116 A:middle
that here.

00:18:54.076 --> 00:18:56.406 A:middle
So here I've defined a function

00:18:56.656 --> 00:18:58.296 A:middle
called setupProviderLoginView,

00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
and it's initializing the

00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
and it's initializing the

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:02.616 A:middle
ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton.

00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:04.126 A:middle
It's then adding the

00:19:04.126 --> 00:19:05.606 A:middle
handleAuthorizationAppleID

00:19:05.606 --> 00:19:07.336 A:middle
ButtonPress function that I've

00:19:07.336 --> 00:19:08.856 A:middle
stubbed out over here as its

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:09.276 A:middle
action.

00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:12.146 A:middle
And then I add the button to the

00:19:12.146 --> 00:19:14.056 A:middle
loginProviderStackView which

00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:16.496 A:middle
will then show it in our UI.

00:19:16.496 --> 00:19:18.666 A:middle
Just above, I'm overriding the

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:20.166 A:middle
viewDidLoad function so that

00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:21.966 A:middle
this way we'll go ahead and call

00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:23.536 A:middle
setupProviderLoginView and that

00:19:23.536 --> 00:19:24.036 A:middle
will get added.

00:19:24.616 --> 00:19:25.786 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and run the

00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:26.686 A:middle
app.

00:19:35.136 --> 00:19:36.566 A:middle
And great, the button is now

00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:37.276 A:middle
visible in our UI.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.246 A:middle
But it's not really doing

00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:41.246 A:middle
anything, so let's jump to step

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.886 A:middle
two which is define the action

00:19:42.886 --> 00:19:43.426 A:middle
for our button.

00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:55.026 A:middle
All right, let's talk about what

00:19:55.026 --> 00:19:57.646 A:middle
this function is doing.

00:19:57.866 --> 00:19:59.606 A:middle
So what we're doing is we're

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
initializing an

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
initializing an

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:02.496 A:middle
ASAuthorizationAppleID request

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.606 A:middle
using the AppleIDProvider and

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:07.266 A:middle
then we're setting its

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:10.236 A:middle
requestedScopes property to an

00:20:10.236 --> 00:20:11.666 A:middle
array that contains the full

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:13.826 A:middle
name and email scope.

00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:19.846 A:middle
This part is critical.

00:20:20.316 --> 00:20:21.636 A:middle
The user will be asked to share

00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:23.286 A:middle
information depending on what

00:20:23.286 --> 00:20:24.106 A:middle
scopes you set here.

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.456 A:middle
The information is then returned

00:20:26.456 --> 00:20:27.816 A:middle
to your Apple ID Credential --

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:30.316 A:middle
in your Apple ID Credential.

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.446 A:middle
You should only request what you

00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:33.366 A:middle
actually need.

00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:35.466 A:middle
So let's go back to our button's

00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:35.766 A:middle
action.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:40.336 A:middle
So we initialize a controller

00:20:41.856 --> 00:20:43.636 A:middle
using the request that I've

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.306 A:middle
inserted into an array, and then

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.426 A:middle
we set the delegate and

00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:48.006 A:middle
presentationContextProvider to

00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:48.296 A:middle
self.

00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:50.446 A:middle
We then call performRequest.

00:20:57.066 --> 00:20:57.916 A:middle
So now that we've defined the

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:59.016 A:middle
action, let's go ahead and run

00:20:59.016 --> 00:20:59.326 A:middle
the app.

00:21:03.126 --> 00:21:04.056 A:middle
Tap the Sign In with Apple

00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:04.356 A:middle
button.

00:21:07.256 --> 00:21:08.616 A:middle
And as you can see, the UI is

00:21:08.616 --> 00:21:10.216 A:middle
asking for the requested scopes

00:21:10.576 --> 00:21:12.366 A:middle
which we set in our request.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.156 A:middle
I'm going to cancel for now.

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:21.096 A:middle
So remember this delegate in the

00:21:21.096 --> 00:21:22.626 A:middle
presentationContextProvider?

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:25.156 A:middle
We're going to have to formally

00:21:25.156 --> 00:21:26.666 A:middle
adopt the authenticationServices

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:28.276 A:middle
protocol that's required for

00:21:29.006 --> 00:21:29.126 A:middle
this.

00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:31.276 A:middle
I stubbed it out below.

00:21:34.236 --> 00:21:35.936 A:middle
So the ASAuthorizationController

00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.126 A:middle
delegate has two functions: one

00:21:38.126 --> 00:21:40.076 A:middle
that returns an authorization

00:21:40.156 --> 00:21:41.596 A:middle
and one that returns an error.

00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:47.976 A:middle
Let's go ahead and we'll define

00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:52.416 A:middle
AuthorizationController

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:53.716 A:middle
didCompleteWithAuthorization.

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
So what we're doing here is

00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:58.326 A:middle
we're checking the authorization

00:21:58.326 --> 00:21:58.986 A:middle
that comes back.

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.966 A:middle
We'll check the credential of

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.966 A:middle
We'll check the credential of

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:01.666 A:middle
the authorization.

00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:03.586 A:middle
And then in the case in which

00:22:03.586 --> 00:22:06.096 A:middle
it's an appleIdCredential, we're

00:22:06.096 --> 00:22:07.536 A:middle
going to set a constant user

00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:09.876 A:middle
identifier to the user property

00:22:09.876 --> 00:22:10.526 A:middle
of the credential.

00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:13.726 A:middle
For demo purposes, we then save

00:22:14.306 --> 00:22:15.696 A:middle
the user identifier in the

00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:17.156 A:middle
keychain so we can use it later.

00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:19.496 A:middle
I'll also have the

00:22:19.496 --> 00:22:22.436 A:middle
ResultViewController that will

00:22:22.556 --> 00:22:23.646 A:middle
go ahead and take care of some

00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:25.036 A:middle
of the boilerplate of handling

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:26.706 A:middle
some of the properties of the

00:22:26.706 --> 00:22:27.646 A:middle
appleIdCredential.

00:22:35.046 --> 00:22:38.176 A:middle
So just below this, just below

00:22:38.176 --> 00:22:39.926 A:middle
what we've defined, we have the

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:41.426 A:middle
didCompleteWithError function

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:43.546 A:middle
and this will get called in the

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.286 A:middle
case in which the flow doesn't

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:46.696 A:middle
complete or there is no

00:22:46.696 --> 00:22:47.156 A:middle
credentials.

00:22:50.326 --> 00:22:51.576 A:middle
Lastly, we have one more

00:22:51.576 --> 00:22:52.476 A:middle
protocol and it's

00:22:52.786 --> 00:22:54.436 A:middle
ASAuthorizationController

00:22:54.476 --> 00:22:56.226 A:middle
PresentationContextProviding.

00:22:57.286 --> 00:22:58.326 A:middle
This defines a function

00:22:58.556 --> 00:22:59.636 A:middle
presentationAnchor for

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:00.136 A:middle
controller.

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:00.136 A:middle
controller.

00:23:00.956 --> 00:23:03.096 A:middle
And what this requires us to do

00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:04.646 A:middle
is return the window in which

00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:05.726 A:middle
we'd like Authentication

00:23:05.726 --> 00:23:08.246 A:middle
Services to display the UI.

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:10.976 A:middle
So let's run the app.

00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:21.856 A:middle
Tap the button and share email.

00:23:26.256 --> 00:23:27.506 A:middle
And authenticate with just one

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:27.806 A:middle
tap.

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:33.176 A:middle
So the service in here seems to

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.406 A:middle
be giving me a bit of a problem,

00:23:34.406 --> 00:23:35.686 A:middle
but I've got a backup video that

00:23:35.686 --> 00:23:36.956 A:middle
will show you what is supposed

00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:37.326 A:middle
to happen.

00:23:45.046 --> 00:23:45.616 A:middle
So here we are.

00:23:46.686 --> 00:23:50.006 A:middle
We are sharing the email and

00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:52.136 A:middle
then the ResultViewController

00:23:52.136 --> 00:23:53.706 A:middle
will then display the results

00:23:54.426 --> 00:23:55.116 A:middle
right there.

00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:56.546 A:middle
And as you can see, we have a

00:23:56.546 --> 00:23:58.466 A:middle
user identifier, the full name

00:23:58.466 --> 00:23:59.436 A:middle
and email address.

00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:08.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:11.576 A:middle
Okay, well, actually it looks

00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:11.976 A:middle
like this has worked.

00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
Okay, there we go.

00:24:20.516 --> 00:24:27.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:28.186 --> 00:24:29.806 A:middle
All right, so let's get back on

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:30.186 A:middle
topic.

00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.606 A:middle
So to recap, we've added a Sign

00:24:32.606 --> 00:24:33.766 A:middle
In with Apple button to our UI,

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.266 A:middle
we defined the button's action

00:24:36.606 --> 00:24:38.516 A:middle
and the required functions of

00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:39.716 A:middle
the authentication services

00:24:39.716 --> 00:24:41.576 A:middle
protocol that return results and

00:24:41.576 --> 00:24:43.256 A:middle
specify where UI should be

00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:43.546 A:middle
shown.

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:46.926 A:middle
So now that we've covered

00:24:46.926 --> 00:24:48.706 A:middle
account creation with the Sign

00:24:48.706 --> 00:24:50.246 A:middle
In with Apple button, let's work

00:24:50.246 --> 00:24:51.436 A:middle
on getting our users signed in

00:24:51.466 --> 00:24:51.976 A:middle
quickly.

00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:54.306 A:middle
To do this, we'll define a

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:55.766 A:middle
function that will display UI to

00:24:55.816 --> 00:24:57.566 A:middle
our users in a case in which

00:24:57.566 --> 00:24:58.476 A:middle
they have an existing

00:24:58.476 --> 00:24:58.866 A:middle
credential.

00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
So this can be either an AppleID

00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
So this can be either an AppleID

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:03.456 A:middle
or an iCloud Keychain password

00:25:03.786 --> 00:25:05.356 A:middle
using the app's authorized

00:25:05.356 --> 00:25:05.776 A:middle
domains.

00:25:14.406 --> 00:25:16.296 A:middle
So here I'm defining the

00:25:16.366 --> 00:25:18.086 A:middle
performExistingAccountSetup

00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:19.766 A:middle
Flows function.

00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:22.136 A:middle
So here we have an array that

00:25:22.136 --> 00:25:23.806 A:middle
contains both an Apple ID

00:25:23.806 --> 00:25:25.916 A:middle
request and a password request

00:25:26.056 --> 00:25:27.876 A:middle
using the respective providers.

00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:30.746 A:middle
We then initialize an

00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.776 A:middle
authorization controller using

00:25:32.776 --> 00:25:34.676 A:middle
those requests, set the delegate

00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:35.086 A:middle
and the

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.406 A:middle
presentationContextProvider like

00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:38.776 A:middle
we did before, and then call

00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:39.576 A:middle
performRequest.

00:25:40.696 --> 00:25:42.096 A:middle
So we've added one more type of

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:43.556 A:middle
credential request to our

00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:44.796 A:middle
controller and that is the

00:25:44.846 --> 00:25:45.686 A:middle
password request.

00:25:46.596 --> 00:25:48.096 A:middle
We will want to handle this type

00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:49.786 A:middle
of result in our delegate, so

00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:50.846 A:middle
let's go ahead and do that now.

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:02.966 A:middle
So we're setting a case for the

00:26:02.966 --> 00:26:04.256 A:middle
ASPasswordCredential.

00:26:04.886 --> 00:26:07.326 A:middle
So in this case, the

00:26:07.326 --> 00:26:10.196 A:middle
ASPasswordCredential has a user

00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:11.386 A:middle
and a password property.

00:26:12.216 --> 00:26:13.166 A:middle
In this case, when it gets

00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.576 A:middle
returned to you, you'll want to

00:26:14.576 --> 00:26:15.636 A:middle
go ahead and authenticate

00:26:15.636 --> 00:26:16.906 A:middle
against your servers and you

00:26:16.906 --> 00:26:17.976 A:middle
don't even need to show any UI

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.076 A:middle
to your users.

00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:22.116 A:middle
So there's one last step and

00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:23.446 A:middle
that's to actually call the

00:26:23.446 --> 00:26:24.976 A:middle
performExistingAccountSetup

00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:25.676 A:middle
Flows function.

00:26:28.216 --> 00:26:29.126 A:middle
I'm going to head back up to the

00:26:29.126 --> 00:26:29.466 A:middle
class.

00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:34.436 A:middle
I'm going to override

00:26:34.506 --> 00:26:35.736 A:middle
viewDidAppear to call

00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:37.296 A:middle
performExistingAccountSetup

00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:37.976 A:middle
Flows.

00:26:44.216 --> 00:26:45.746 A:middle
Let's run the app.

00:26:55.116 --> 00:26:56.916 A:middle
And as you can see, the user is

00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:58.336 A:middle
presented with existing

00:26:58.336 --> 00:27:00.396 A:middle
credentials when we show the

00:26:58.336 --> 00:27:00.396 A:middle
credentials when we show the

00:27:00.396 --> 00:27:01.686 A:middle
loginViewController.

00:27:02.896 --> 00:27:04.096 A:middle
That's our QuickSigninFlow.

00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
So we've just implemented the

00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:08.186 A:middle
QuickSigninFlow, so let's move

00:27:08.186 --> 00:27:09.626 A:middle
on to our last topic which is

00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:10.816 A:middle
checking the credential status

00:27:10.816 --> 00:27:12.486 A:middle
of an AppleID user identifier.

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:17.116 A:middle
Earlier in this demo we saved

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:18.176 A:middle
the user identifier to the

00:27:18.176 --> 00:27:19.506 A:middle
keychain during account

00:27:19.506 --> 00:27:19.976 A:middle
creation.

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:22.666 A:middle
Using this identifier, we can

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:23.956 A:middle
check the state of the sign in

00:27:24.236 --> 00:27:25.386 A:middle
to ensure that our user is

00:27:25.386 --> 00:27:26.396 A:middle
properly authenticated.

00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:27.806 A:middle
We'll do this in our

00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:28.396 A:middle
AppDelegate.

00:27:28.936 --> 00:27:30.576 A:middle
And I head over to the

00:27:30.576 --> 00:27:31.386 A:middle
AppDelegate file.

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.946 A:middle
And I'm going to remove this.

00:27:47.136 --> 00:27:49.066 A:middle
So first we're checking to see

00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:50.636 A:middle
if the keychain has the user

00:27:50.636 --> 00:27:51.886 A:middle
identifier in it.

00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:53.106 A:middle
If it does, we're going to

00:27:53.106 --> 00:27:53.946 A:middle
initialize

00:27:53.946 --> 00:27:55.916 A:middle
ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider,

00:27:55.966 --> 00:27:57.056 A:middle
and then using the

00:27:57.056 --> 00:27:58.916 A:middle
AppleIDProvider we'll call

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:00.366 A:middle
credentials a state passing the

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:00.366 A:middle
credentials a state passing the

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:01.246 A:middle
user identifier.

00:28:04.046 --> 00:28:05.406 A:middle
So we're going to get three

00:28:05.406 --> 00:28:06.186 A:middle
different -- we have three

00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:07.206 A:middle
different types of cases.

00:28:07.806 --> 00:28:09.976 A:middle
One is authorized and in this

00:28:09.976 --> 00:28:11.476 A:middle
case you can just assume that

00:28:11.596 --> 00:28:12.756 A:middle
the user is properly

00:28:12.756 --> 00:28:15.216 A:middle
authenticated and you can

00:28:15.216 --> 00:28:16.406 A:middle
continue your normal app

00:28:16.406 --> 00:28:17.106 A:middle
operations.

00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:18.786 A:middle
In the case in which it's

00:28:18.786 --> 00:28:20.286 A:middle
revoked, you want to call your

00:28:20.286 --> 00:28:22.716 A:middle
existing sign out logic and then

00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:24.306 A:middle
you can fall through to notFound

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:25.736 A:middle
case which is to show the

00:28:25.736 --> 00:28:26.796 A:middle
LoginViewController.

00:28:26.886 --> 00:28:29.446 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and run

00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:29.716 A:middle
the app.

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:44.336 A:middle
And as you can see, the user

00:28:44.336 --> 00:28:45.606 A:middle
identifier is presented in the

00:28:45.606 --> 00:28:47.906 A:middle
ResultViewController because in

00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:49.516 A:middle
this case the user is already

00:28:49.516 --> 00:28:50.056 A:middle
authorized.

00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:51.866 A:middle
The ResultViewController is the

00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:53.886 A:middle
initial view controller in the

00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:54.386 A:middle
storyboard.

00:28:54.656 --> 00:28:55.976 A:middle
So that's it.

00:28:58.046 --> 00:28:58.846 A:middle
Pretty easy, right?

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:03.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:03.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:05.276 A:middle
So I've just shown you how to

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.466 A:middle
add the Sign In with Apple

00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:08.146 A:middle
button to your login form, how

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:09.576 A:middle
to implement a QuickSigninFlow

00:29:09.806 --> 00:29:10.896 A:middle
to get users signed in with an

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:12.626 A:middle
existing credential, and then

00:29:12.946 --> 00:29:13.986 A:middle
how to check the credential

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:16.246 A:middle
status using the user identifier

00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.456 A:middle
to make sure users are

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.786 A:middle
authenticated with your app.

00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:20.316 A:middle
With that, I'll hand it back

00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:21.506 A:middle
over to Gokul who'll cover

00:29:21.506 --> 00:29:22.696 A:middle
multiplatform topics.

00:29:22.946 --> 00:29:23.536 A:middle
Gokul?

00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:29.666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jonathan.

00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:33.006 A:middle
We just saw Jonathan start with

00:29:33.006 --> 00:29:36.576 A:middle
a test app, add a button, handle

00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:38.046 A:middle
requests and responses and

00:29:38.106 --> 00:29:39.276 A:middle
finally handle existing

00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:40.036 A:middle
accounts.

00:29:40.716 --> 00:29:43.216 A:middle
All easy to implement and a

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:44.986 A:middle
great experience for users.

00:29:45.146 --> 00:29:46.346 A:middle
So that was a very quick demo.

00:29:47.296 --> 00:29:48.796 A:middle
Let's talk about cross-platform.

00:29:49.386 --> 00:29:51.466 A:middle
Cross-platform's important and

00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:54.606 A:middle
it's enabled through a simple

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.386 A:middle
JavaScript library.

00:29:57.236 --> 00:29:59.216 A:middle
Using this library, you can

00:29:59.216 --> 00:30:01.046 A:middle
enable your users to sign in

00:29:59.216 --> 00:30:01.046 A:middle
enable your users to sign in

00:30:01.446 --> 00:30:03.656 A:middle
with Apple on any platform like

00:30:03.826 --> 00:30:05.256 A:middle
Windows or Android.

00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.776 A:middle
And clicking the familiar Sign

00:30:07.776 --> 00:30:10.036 A:middle
In with Apple button will

00:30:10.036 --> 00:30:12.686 A:middle
redirect to Apple where your

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:15.576 A:middle
user can enter the Apple ID and

00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:16.066 A:middle
sign in.

00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:19.086 A:middle
Once they sign in, it redirects

00:30:19.086 --> 00:30:19.436 A:middle
back.

00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:23.206 A:middle
Both the calls and information

00:30:23.206 --> 00:30:25.006 A:middle
you receive back are very

00:30:25.006 --> 00:30:26.166 A:middle
similar to the native API.

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:29.426 A:middle
You get the ID, the token or

00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:30.816 A:middle
even the name or email if you

00:30:30.816 --> 00:30:31.236 A:middle
request it.

00:30:32.356 --> 00:30:33.746 A:middle
And once you get back the ID and

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:36.526 A:middle
the token, you can convert this

00:30:36.926 --> 00:30:41.086 A:middle
to an app session in your app.

00:30:42.036 --> 00:30:45.236 A:middle
Best of all, support for this is

00:30:45.236 --> 00:30:47.326 A:middle
built right into Safari.

00:30:48.876 --> 00:30:51.736 A:middle
So when your user clicks that

00:30:51.736 --> 00:30:54.966 A:middle
button, Safari will bring up a

00:30:54.966 --> 00:30:56.866 A:middle
native Apple Pay-like sheet.

00:30:57.716 --> 00:31:00.606 A:middle
Your user can simply TouchID and

00:30:57.716 --> 00:31:00.606 A:middle
Your user can simply TouchID and

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:02.306 A:middle
they're instantly signed in and

00:31:02.306 --> 00:31:04.466 A:middle
using your website super-fast,

00:31:04.466 --> 00:31:06.116 A:middle
and what a great experience.

00:31:06.536 --> 00:31:08.066 A:middle
So it's built right into Safari.

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.366 A:middle
Integrating with a JavaScript

00:31:11.596 --> 00:31:13.976 A:middle
library is just four easy steps.

00:31:17.056 --> 00:31:19.186 A:middle
You start with including the

00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:21.916 A:middle
JavaScript library in your HTML

00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:22.476 A:middle
as shown.

00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:26.146 A:middle
A simple div renders the button.

00:31:27.076 --> 00:31:28.506 A:middle
You can style it with many

00:31:28.506 --> 00:31:30.556 A:middle
parameters to customize the fit

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:32.446 A:middle
to your site.

00:31:33.176 --> 00:31:34.946 A:middle
Configure it with parameters

00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:36.526 A:middle
like whether you want name,

00:31:36.526 --> 00:31:39.946 A:middle
email and your redirect URI.

00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:43.546 A:middle
And finally, when the user

00:31:43.546 --> 00:31:45.516 A:middle
completes sign in, the results

00:31:45.626 --> 00:31:47.896 A:middle
are posted back to your redirect

00:31:47.896 --> 00:31:50.346 A:middle
URI with form-encoded values.

00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:53.556 A:middle
You validate the token, the auth

00:31:53.556 --> 00:31:55.396 A:middle
code and convert it to an

00:31:55.396 --> 00:31:56.376 A:middle
application session.

00:31:56.746 --> 00:31:58.806 A:middle
And you decide how long you want

00:31:58.806 --> 00:31:59.466 A:middle
the session to live.

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:02.826 A:middle
So that's a very quick look at

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:02.826 A:middle
So that's a very quick look at

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:04.706 A:middle
cross-platform support with

00:32:04.706 --> 00:32:05.946 A:middle
JavaScript library.

00:32:08.046 --> 00:32:09.346 A:middle
Finally, let's just go through

00:32:09.346 --> 00:32:11.346 A:middle
some best practices to observe

00:32:11.816 --> 00:32:13.506 A:middle
when integrating with Sign In

00:32:13.506 --> 00:32:13.926 A:middle
with Apple.

00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:17.676 A:middle
Here are some general guidelines

00:32:17.676 --> 00:32:18.296 A:middle
to follow.

00:32:18.986 --> 00:32:20.166 A:middle
As stated in the App Store

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:22.286 A:middle
guidelines, unless your app

00:32:22.286 --> 00:32:23.796 A:middle
requires significant

00:32:23.866 --> 00:32:25.846 A:middle
account-based features, let

00:32:25.846 --> 00:32:27.596 A:middle
people use it without a login.

00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:30.186 A:middle
For example, you can guide the

00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:32.326 A:middle
user to sign in with Apple after

00:32:32.326 --> 00:32:33.916 A:middle
they've made a purchase so you

00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:36.396 A:middle
can tie their purchase to an

00:32:36.396 --> 00:32:38.606 A:middle
account that they can easily get

00:32:39.126 --> 00:32:40.536 A:middle
back to later.

00:32:40.536 --> 00:32:41.866 A:middle
If you just need a unique

00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:43.746 A:middle
identifier to identify the user,

00:32:44.316 --> 00:32:45.716 A:middle
don't collect name or email.

00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:47.476 A:middle
You don't need it.

00:32:48.356 --> 00:32:49.606 A:middle
And if you do collect email

00:32:50.816 --> 00:32:52.366 A:middle
through Sign In with Apple, make

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:54.326 A:middle
sure that you respect the user's

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:54.916 A:middle
choice.

00:32:57.156 --> 00:32:58.166 A:middle
And here are some additional

00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:59.836 A:middle
best practices to keep in mind

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:01.366 A:middle
when integrating with the API.

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:01.366 A:middle
when integrating with the API.

00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:04.606 A:middle
When your app first starts up,

00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:07.026 A:middle
use the API to check for

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:08.146 A:middle
existing accounts.

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:10.826 A:middle
This allows the user to quickly

00:33:10.826 --> 00:33:11.926 A:middle
get going with an account they

00:33:11.926 --> 00:33:13.776 A:middle
already have with your app,

00:33:14.306 --> 00:33:15.706 A:middle
whether it's iCloud Keychain

00:33:16.196 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
password or an existing Apple

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:18.456 A:middle
account.

00:33:19.086 --> 00:33:20.406 A:middle
And you don't have any duplicate

00:33:20.406 --> 00:33:21.376 A:middle
accounts in your app.

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:24.896 A:middle
Plan to provide the best

00:33:24.926 --> 00:33:27.966 A:middle
experience for users that return

00:33:28.186 --> 00:33:29.196 A:middle
real user indicator.

00:33:29.406 --> 00:33:32.096 A:middle
If it returns unknown, treat

00:33:32.096 --> 00:33:33.446 A:middle
them like you would any new

00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:34.376 A:middle
account in your system.

00:33:34.966 --> 00:33:38.476 A:middle
Use the Button API to draw the

00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:38.746 A:middle
button.

00:33:40.376 --> 00:33:41.586 A:middle
And when you draw the button

00:33:41.696 --> 00:33:43.866 A:middle
with the API, wire it to the

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:46.026 A:middle
Apple ID Provider in your code.

00:33:47.466 --> 00:33:51.156 A:middle
And finally, once users use Sign

00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:52.916 A:middle
In with Apple, they will expect

00:33:52.916 --> 00:33:55.516 A:middle
to see it on all platforms that

00:33:55.516 --> 00:33:56.186 A:middle
your app is on.

00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.206 A:middle
So implement it across all of

00:33:58.206 --> 00:33:58.916 A:middle
your platforms.

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:02.486 A:middle
So that's a quick look at best

00:34:02.486 --> 00:34:03.226 A:middle
practices.

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:05.586 A:middle
In summary, Sign In with Apple

00:34:05.806 --> 00:34:07.906 A:middle
is fast, easy account setup and

00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:09.896 A:middle
sign in for your app.

00:34:10.286 --> 00:34:12.356 A:middle
Streamlined, one-tap account

00:34:12.356 --> 00:34:14.516 A:middle
setup with no cumbersome forms.

00:34:15.126 --> 00:34:16.735 A:middle
Verified email address that

00:34:16.735 --> 00:34:18.255 A:middle
instantly works and you can use

00:34:18.255 --> 00:34:19.505 A:middle
for any communication.

00:34:20.606 --> 00:34:22.556 A:middle
Built-in security with no new

00:34:22.556 --> 00:34:24.235 A:middle
passwords and two-factor

00:34:24.235 --> 00:34:25.536 A:middle
authentication for every

00:34:25.536 --> 00:34:25.886 A:middle
account.

00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:28.536 A:middle
Real user indicator to help you

00:34:28.536 --> 00:34:29.666 A:middle
combat account fraud.

00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:32.525 A:middle
And cross-platform support so

00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:34.646 A:middle
your users can benefit from Sign

00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:36.606 A:middle
In with Apple on every platform

00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:37.646 A:middle
that your app is on.

00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:41.466 A:middle
Please join us at our lab at

00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:43.085 A:middle

00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:44.106 A:middle
answer any questions you may

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:44.386 A:middle
have.

00:34:45.065 --> 00:34:46.156 A:middle
There's more in the

00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:47.126 A:middle
authentication services

00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:49.136 A:middle
framework to help you help your

00:34:49.136 --> 00:34:51.136 A:middle
users with signing in and

00:34:51.136 --> 00:34:52.286 A:middle
dealing with their passwords.
