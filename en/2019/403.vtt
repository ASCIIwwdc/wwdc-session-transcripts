[ Music ]

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:10.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Applause] All right.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:13.286 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:15.816 A:middle
Thank you for attending this

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:16.326 A:middle
session.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.066 A:middle
My name is Kulpreet.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.386 A:middle
I'm a Software Engineer in

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.206 A:middle
Localization and I'll be joined

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:22.766 A:middle
by my colleagues Vivian and

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.226 A:middle
Arthur.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.576 A:middle
In this session, I'll be going

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:28.016 A:middle
over some exciting new

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.386 A:middle
localization features in our

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:29.946 A:middle
platforms.

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.095 A:middle
Vivian and Arthur will then

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.446 A:middle
touch on some new tooling in

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.496 A:middle
Xcode 11, including some great

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:36.986 A:middle
enhancements to localization

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.606 A:middle
workflows, localizing images,

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:41.756 A:middle
and how you can use testing to

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:43.516 A:middle
generate screenshots of your app

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.176 A:middle
in any language.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:49.676 A:middle
Today, we estimate over 70% of

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:51.476 A:middle
our users are outside the United

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:52.046 A:middle
States.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:55.186 A:middle
Localization is an opportunity

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:57.516 A:middle
for you to expand your reach and

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.026 A:middle
capture new markets with your

00:00:59.026 --> 00:00:59.136 A:middle
app.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:04.126 A:middle
At Apple, we care deeply about

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.946 A:middle
creating a great experience for

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:07.406 A:middle
all of our users around the

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:07.716 A:middle
world.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:10.856 A:middle
This year, we have a host of new

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.746 A:middle
features and improvements for

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:13.896 A:middle
our Multilingual and

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.066 A:middle
International Users.

00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:19.486 A:middle
To name a few, in iOS 13 we have

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:22.166 A:middle
keyboards for 38 new languages.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
I'm sure if your language is up

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:25.116 A:middle
there you're really excited.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:28.096 A:middle
We also have a new setup flow

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:29.766 A:middle
that guides multilingual users

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.886 A:middle
to the right language settings.

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:34.766 A:middle
Now one of these features I'm

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.676 A:middle
particularly excited about, and

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:38.486 A:middle
I want to dive a bit deeper with

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:39.216 A:middle
you.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:42.516 A:middle
In iOS 13 there's a new setting

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.786 A:middle
that appears from Multilingual

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:45.786 A:middle
Users in your app settings page.

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:48.506 A:middle
I'm happy to say that users can

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:49.906 A:middle
now set the language of your app

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:51.876 A:middle
independent of the system

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:52.346 A:middle
language.

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:56.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:58.546 A:middle
If a user has a connected watch,

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:00.146 A:middle
the setting will also sync to

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:00.146 A:middle
the setting will also sync to

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:00.936 A:middle
the accompanying watch

00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:01.646 A:middle
application.

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:04.826 A:middle
And similarly, on macOS, users

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:06.176 A:middle
can set the language of an app

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:07.966 A:middle
via Language and Region

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:08.946 A:middle
preferences.

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:12.366 A:middle
This is important because in

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.256 A:middle
multilingual regions, users may

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:15.346 A:middle
prefer to use different

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:16.696 A:middle
languages in different context.

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:19.046 A:middle
In a region like Hong Kong,

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:21.076 A:middle
someone might read their news in

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:22.166 A:middle
Chinese even though they do

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.496 A:middle
their banking in English.

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:27.136 A:middle
In India, a student will go to

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:29.396 A:middle
school and learn in English even

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:30.466 A:middle
though they come home and speak

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.576 A:middle
Hindi with their family.

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.386 A:middle
Apps are windows into these

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
interactions we have everyday.

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:38.296 A:middle
And this new setting allows

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:39.916 A:middle
users to choose a language that

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:41.076 A:middle
reflects their preference for

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:42.446 A:middle
your app.

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.166 A:middle
Now this works for your app out

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.946 A:middle
of the box and for free if

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:48.276 A:middle
you're using all of our standard

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:49.496 A:middle
foundation APIs for

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:50.236 A:middle
localization.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:51.966 A:middle
But there are couple things to

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:53.336 A:middle
keep in mind to make this work

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:54.446 A:middle
great for your users.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:58.196 A:middle
First, do not attempt to set the

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.816 A:middle
application language manually in

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.166 A:middle
code.

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.166 A:middle
code.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:02.806 A:middle
Our APIs do a lot of work to

00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:04.036 A:middle
ensure users get the right

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:05.526 A:middle
language and font fall backs.

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:07.956 A:middle
If you do need to add the option

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:08.966 A:middle
within your app to switch

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.666 A:middle
languages, we recommend you

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:12.126 A:middle
Launch into Settings where users

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:13.216 A:middle
can go in and switch the

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:14.766 A:middle
language of your app.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.386 A:middle
Next, when the user does change

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:21.366 A:middle
the language of your app, your

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.106 A:middle
app will be relaunched in the

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:23.976 A:middle
target language.

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:25.976 A:middle
Now, to make this language

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.616 A:middle
change a seamless experience for

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.436 A:middle
the user, we recommend you adapt

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:31.946 A:middle
state restoration APIs.

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:34.526 A:middle
In iOS 13, there are some new

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.926 A:middle
state restoration APIs with

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:38.136 A:middle
NSUserActivity.

00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:39.596 A:middle
To learn more about how you can

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:40.906 A:middle
use them, you can check out this

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:41.856 A:middle
talk on Friday.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:45.796 A:middle
And, finally, it's important

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.076 A:middle
that all of your content is

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:48.596 A:middle
shown consistently in one

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:49.736 A:middle
language throughout your app.

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:51.966 A:middle
If you're doing some custom or

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:53.446 A:middle
server-side resource loading,

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.386 A:middle
there are handful of APIs that

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:56.556 A:middle
might be useful for you to

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:57.606 A:middle
determine which language to

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:58.676 A:middle
request that content here.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
Let's go over a few of them.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
Let's go over a few of them.

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:04.286 A:middle
Locale APIs are useful for

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.106 A:middle
fetching the user's Language and

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:07.016 A:middle
Region preferences.

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.536 A:middle
Locale that preferred languages

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.536 A:middle
returns a list of languages in

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:12.776 A:middle
order of user preference.

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:15.546 A:middle
Now, this list might be useful

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.375 A:middle
to you if maybe you're building

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:19.315 A:middle
an app that needs to handle

00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:21.536 A:middle
multilingual content, and you

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:22.716 A:middle
need to fetch resources such as

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:24.476 A:middle
font for all of the user's

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:24.846 A:middle
languages.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:27.876 A:middle
And one thing to know is that

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.396 A:middle
locale, that preferred languages

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:32.206 A:middle
will return the language list,

00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:33.396 A:middle
that user's preferred languages,

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:35.016 A:middle
regardless of the languages your

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.356 A:middle
application bundle supports.

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:37.996 A:middle
So it's not useful for getting

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.196 A:middle
the current running application

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:39.626 A:middle
language.

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:41.746 A:middle
To get the current running

00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:44.066 A:middle
application language, we can use

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.026 A:middle
Bundle APIs.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.466 A:middle
And Bundle APIs are useful for

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:48.606 A:middle
language matching.

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.006 A:middle
Bundle.main.preferred

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:53.306 A:middle
Localizations considers both the

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:55.716 A:middle
user preferred languages and the

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:57.096 A:middle
languages that your application

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.896 A:middle
bundle supports and returns a

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:00.096 A:middle
list of languages your

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:00.096 A:middle
list of languages your

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
application Bundle supports in

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:02.806 A:middle
order of user preference.

00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:05.486 A:middle
Now, if you have an external

00:05:05.486 --> 00:05:06.526 A:middle
list, say if you're loading some

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:08.226 A:middle
remote content from a server and

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:09.166 A:middle
your server has a different

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:10.646 A:middle
setup supported languages, you

00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:11.786 A:middle
can use the class method

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.466 A:middle
Bundle.preferredLocalizations

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:13.806 A:middle
from.

00:05:14.276 --> 00:05:15.706 A:middle
And this will also consider that

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:17.866 A:middle
third language from your server.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:20.956 A:middle
Now, to help walk you through

00:05:20.956 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
this feature and what it means

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.286 A:middle
for your apps, I'd love to jump

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:24.886 A:middle
in to a demo.

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:28.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:37.706 A:middle
OK. So, last year, we demo'd

00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:38.576 A:middle
Vacation Planet.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:40.806 A:middle
The first Interplanetary Travel

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.266 A:middle
Booking app, and we've since

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:43.586 A:middle
expanded the app to be able to

00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:44.736 A:middle
book complete travel

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:45.416 A:middle
experiences.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:47.526 A:middle
We had this new Discover tab

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:48.766 A:middle
with the collection view that

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.266 A:middle
shows some of our great

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.546 A:middle
offerings in these thumbnails

00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:55.256 A:middle
like this romantic space cruise

00:05:55.256 --> 00:05:58.726 A:middle
to Pluto or Moon Yoga.

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:02.236 A:middle
Now, some of these are seasonal

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.876 A:middle
offerings like this WWDC

00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:04.526 A:middle
Afterparty.

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:06.286 A:middle
And because this is seasonal

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:07.266 A:middle
offering this content is

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.726 A:middle
actually pulled from our server.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:10.426 A:middle
So this image and this great

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:11.336 A:middle
description about how this is

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
the first Interstellar Bash and

00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:14.426 A:middle
how we're going to be going on a

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:15.856 A:middle
onboard-- we're going to be

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:17.836 A:middle
going on a ship with an onboard

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.756 A:middle
seafood restaurant, the Codable,

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:22.736 A:middle
is actually being pulled from

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:23.366 A:middle
our server.

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:25.406 A:middle
Now, after reading that

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:26.676 A:middle
description, I think this looks

00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:27.886 A:middle
great and I'm ready to book.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:30.966 A:middle
But as you know, WWDC attendees

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:32.336 A:middle
has come from all around the

00:06:32.336 --> 00:06:34.106 A:middle
world and they might prefer to

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:35.386 A:middle
do their travel booking in a

00:06:35.386 --> 00:06:36.156 A:middle
different language.

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:37.986 A:middle
So, what I'm going to do is I'm

00:06:37.986 --> 00:06:39.006 A:middle
going to go down to the profile

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:40.406 A:middle
tab where we have a table view

00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:41.656 A:middle
cell that shows the current

00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:42.886 A:middle
running application language.

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.036 A:middle
And when I click on that, it's

00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:46.086 A:middle
going to pop me right into

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:47.156 A:middle
Settings where I can click in to

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.846 A:middle
see a list of all the languages

00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:49.946 A:middle
my application supports.

00:06:50.436 --> 00:06:51.426 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and change

00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:52.026 A:middle
this to French.

00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:53.696 A:middle
And when I go back, you can see

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:55.446 A:middle
that the System UI is still in

00:06:55.446 --> 00:06:57.116 A:middle
English but when I go back to

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.846 A:middle
Vacation Planet, the app will

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
relaunch and it'll be in French.

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
relaunch and it'll be in French.

00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:04.996 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.976 A:middle
Now, one thing you'll notice is

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:08.016 A:middle
that it actually brought me

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.066 A:middle
right back to where I left it

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.076 A:middle
and that's because I've adapted

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:11.856 A:middle
those state restoration APIs.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.376 A:middle
And you can see now all of our

00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:15.616 A:middle
strings and all of our date

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:16.896 A:middle
formatters are in French which

00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:17.716 A:middle
is great.

00:07:18.026 --> 00:07:19.616 A:middle
But when I go to that server

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:21.156 A:middle
side loaded content, I can see

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:22.606 A:middle
that that is still in English.

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:24.236 A:middle
Now that seems problematic

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:25.406 A:middle
because we want to be consistent

00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:26.526 A:middle
in our app and we want their app

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:27.596 A:middle
to be in one language.

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:29.706 A:middle
So, let's take a look of what

00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:32.146 A:middle
might be going on there.

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.566 A:middle
So, I'm here in our Collection

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.706 A:middle
View Controller and I have this

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:37.376 A:middle
method Local Discover Items that

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:38.976 A:middle
downloads that content from the

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:39.416 A:middle
server.

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:40.666 A:middle
And when we download that

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:41.646 A:middle
content, we actually need to

00:07:41.746 --> 00:07:42.966 A:middle
pass in a language because the

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:44.386 A:middle
server needs to know what

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:45.496 A:middle
language are we fetching that

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:46.116 A:middle
content in.

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:47.956 A:middle
And here you can see that the

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:48.906 A:middle
language I'm passing in is

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:50.766 A:middle
Locale.preferredLanguages.first.

00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:52.306 A:middle
As I mentioned before,

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:53.706 A:middle
Locale.preferredLanguages going

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:55.926 A:middle
to return the users preferred

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.106 A:middle
languages regardless of the

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:58.246 A:middle
language that my application

00:07:58.296 --> 00:07:58.676 A:middle
supports.

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:00.466 A:middle
And so, this could be something

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:00.466 A:middle
And so, this could be something

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:01.906 A:middle
like Persian that my application

00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:03.116 A:middle
doesn't necessarily support.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.896 A:middle
Now, ideally, I'd like something

00:08:05.896 --> 00:08:07.026 A:middle
that I'll consider the server

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.336 A:middle
support languages, my

00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:09.556 A:middle
application bundle supported

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.076 A:middle
languages, in order of the

00:08:11.076 --> 00:08:12.086 A:middle
user's preferences.

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:14.046 A:middle
So, I'm going to start by

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:16.636 A:middle
fetching the server's supported

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:17.116 A:middle
languages.

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:18.446 A:middle
You can see that here.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:20.126 A:middle
And then I'm going to use that

00:08:20.196 --> 00:08:22.216 A:middle
Bundle API, that class method on

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:23.946 A:middle
Bundle.preferredLocalizations

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:25.806 A:middle
from, and I'll pass in the

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.186 A:middle
availableServerLocalizations.

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:28.986 A:middle
And now the first element of

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.556 A:middle
this will be the best language

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:33.626 A:middle
to request that content and from

00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:35.905 A:middle
the server.

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:38.546 A:middle
So I went ahead and I rebuilt.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.136 A:middle
And wait a couple of seconds for

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:45.926 A:middle
it to relaunch.

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:48.326 A:middle
And you can see now that image

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:49.626 A:middle
and all of that content is in

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:49.826 A:middle
French.

00:08:50.216 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
Isn't that great [applause]?

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:53.016 A:middle
Cool, so, I'm ready to book and

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:53.956 A:middle
I can't wait to see you guys all

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:54.876 A:middle
at this Interstellar Bash.

00:08:55.126 --> 00:08:56.996 A:middle
All right.

00:08:57.956 --> 00:08:59.876 A:middle
So, to summarize, App Language

00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
Setting allows users to choose a

00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
Setting allows users to choose a

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:04.186 A:middle
language for your app.

00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:06.516 A:middle
Launching to Settings is the

00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:08.556 A:middle
best way to allow your users to

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:09.656 A:middle
switch the language of your app.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:12.886 A:middle
Use state restoration to make

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.266 A:middle
that language switch a seamless

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.736 A:middle
experience for the user.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:17.786 A:middle
And, finally, if you're doing

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.046 A:middle
some custom or server-side

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:20.756 A:middle
resource loading, be sure you're

00:09:20.756 --> 00:09:22.426 A:middle
using the right bundle or locale

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:24.666 A:middle
API for your use case.

00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:28.076 A:middle
I'm incredibly excited for all

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.046 A:middle
of the great features and

00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:30.196 A:middle
enhancements we've worked on

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:32.236 A:middle
this year and can't wait to see

00:09:32.236 --> 00:09:33.096 A:middle
how you're going to bring your

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:34.236 A:middle
apps to an international

00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:34.596 A:middle
audience.

00:09:35.506 --> 00:09:37.446 A:middle
Now to tell you how we've made

00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:38.566 A:middle
it easier for you to do just

00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:39.756 A:middle
that, I'd like to call up

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:40.366 A:middle
Vivian.

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:40.856 A:middle
Vivian?

00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:46.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:47.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Kulpreet.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:48.946 A:middle
So, let's talk about some of the

00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:50.746 A:middle
enhancements that localization

00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:53.786 A:middle
tooling in Xcode.

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:55.216 A:middle
And this year, we've done a lot

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:56.546 A:middle
of things you've been asking

00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.316 A:middle
for, so this is going to read a

00:09:58.316 --> 00:09:59.936 A:middle
little like a wish list.

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:03.006 A:middle
First up, performance.

00:10:03.806 --> 00:10:05.566 A:middle
So, I'm very excited to announce

00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:07.636 A:middle
that exporting projects with

00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:09.746 A:middle
lots of Interface Builder files

00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:12.146 A:middle
for localization is now on

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:15.976 A:middle
average, 15 times faster.

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:19.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:21.536 A:middle
So, this means if you had a

00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:22.996 A:middle
project that was taking about a

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:25.406 A:middle
minute, that's going to be down

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:25.976 A:middle
to four seconds.

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:31.246 A:middle
And we did this by redesigning

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.046 A:middle
the string extraction process,

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:34.866 A:middle
so the more Interface Builder

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:37.416 A:middle
files you have, the bigger an

00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:39.236 A:middle
improvement you're going to see.

00:10:39.736 --> 00:10:41.326 A:middle
Also to really speed up and

00:10:41.326 --> 00:10:43.446 A:middle
streamline your workflow, don't

00:10:43.446 --> 00:10:45.476 A:middle
bother with calling genstrings

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:48.716 A:middle
or ibtool directly, instead use

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:51.316 A:middle
xcodebuild, exportlocalizations,

00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:53.356 A:middle
and importlocalizations to take

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:54.306 A:middle
care of creating all of your

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:55.226 A:middle
strings files.

00:10:56.386 --> 00:11:00.096 A:middle
Next up. iPad apps for Mac, so

00:10:56.386 --> 00:11:00.096 A:middle
Next up. iPad apps for Mac, so

00:11:00.096 --> 00:11:02.066 A:middle
you may be really excited about

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.836 A:middle
bringing your iPad apps to Mac,

00:11:04.646 --> 00:11:06.406 A:middle
but maybe you have some strings

00:11:06.486 --> 00:11:08.546 A:middle
that wouldn't make sense, and

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:10.736 A:middle
maybe something it says, tap

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.266 A:middle
here but the user would now be

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.016 A:middle
using a mouse with a cursor,

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.476 A:middle
maybe clicking, or here in news,

00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:18.356 A:middle
you can control Siri's

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:20.516 A:middle
suggestions in Settings, if

00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:22.946 A:middle
you're on the iPad, but that

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:25.226 A:middle
would be the apps preferences on

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:25.586 A:middle
a Mac.

00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:29.616 A:middle
And, of course, you want to have

00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:32.656 A:middle
that one NSLocalizedString

00:11:32.656 --> 00:11:34.526 A:middle
called it's already in code.

00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:37.226 A:middle
So, to help with this, we're

00:11:37.226 --> 00:11:39.466 A:middle
introducing a new stringsdict

00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:41.356 A:middle
rule for device-specific

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:42.076 A:middle
strings.

00:11:43.346 --> 00:11:45.266 A:middle
And this rule can be combined

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:47.106 A:middle
with the plural and variable

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:47.746 A:middle
width rules.

00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:49.466 A:middle
So, you can use this for any of

00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:51.546 A:middle
your existing strings even if

00:11:51.546 --> 00:11:53.466 A:middle
they're already in a stringsdict

00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:53.886 A:middle
file.

00:11:56.146 --> 00:11:57.256 A:middle
So, the new rule is

00:11:57.306 --> 00:11:59.476 A:middle
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
and the supported device keys

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
and the supported device keys

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:06.906 A:middle
are apppletv, applewatch, ipad,

00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:10.476 A:middle
iphone, ipod and mac.

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:13.116 A:middle
So, it's not just for iPad apps

00:12:13.456 --> 00:12:14.746 A:middle
on Mac.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.816 A:middle
And your stringsdict will look

00:12:16.816 --> 00:12:18.706 A:middle
something like this, at the top,

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:22.026 A:middle
your existing string key then

00:12:22.026 --> 00:12:22.756 A:middle
the new rule

00:12:22.986 --> 00:12:25.126 A:middle
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType

00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:27.836 A:middle
and inside a dictionary, with

00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:29.536 A:middle
all of your device specific

00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:32.046 A:middle
strings index by those device

00:12:32.046 --> 00:12:32.326 A:middle
keys.

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.266 A:middle
For more on iPad apps for Mac,

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:36.696 A:middle
please check out the session

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:38.456 A:middle
Taking iPad Apps For Mac to the

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:39.146 A:middle
Next Level.

00:12:40.406 --> 00:12:43.236 A:middle
Next up. Settings bundle.

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:46.386 A:middle
Settings Bundles are now

00:12:46.386 --> 00:12:47.816 A:middle
included in your Xcode

00:12:47.816 --> 00:12:48.976 A:middle
Localization Catalogs.

00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:51.506 A:middle
So these are as easy to localize

00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:52.856 A:middle
as anything else in your

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:53.296 A:middle
project.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.316 A:middle
And one of the more significant

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.036 A:middle
improvements we made to the

00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:00.696 A:middle
localization tooling in Xcode is

00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:00.696 A:middle
localization tooling in Xcode is

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.586 A:middle
in how you localize Assets.

00:13:04.406 --> 00:13:06.196 A:middle
So until now, in order to

00:13:06.196 --> 00:13:08.046 A:middle
localize an image it needed to

00:13:08.046 --> 00:13:10.536 A:middle
be an independent file in your

00:13:10.726 --> 00:13:13.156 A:middle
project and this may have meant

00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:16.266 A:middle
you had some files in your Asset

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.506 A:middle
Catalog and the localized ones

00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:19.766 A:middle
floating around lose.

00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:22.056 A:middle
So I'm very excited to announce

00:13:22.146 --> 00:13:23.626 A:middle
that starting now you can

00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:26.086 A:middle
localize images directly in your

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:26.886 A:middle
Asset Catalog.

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:30.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:33.546 A:middle
So, this means you can now

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:37.486 A:middle
localize your image sets, watch

00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:40.506 A:middle
complications, Apple TV image

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:44.726 A:middle
stacks, Sprite atlases, Game

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:46.056 A:middle
Center dashboards and

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:48.966 A:middle
leaderboards, as well as the new

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:49.776 A:middle
symbol sets.

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.056 A:middle
So, let's take a look how you do

00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:52.276 A:middle
that.

00:13:53.146 --> 00:13:56.156 A:middle
In the Asset Catalog Editor when

00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:57.846 A:middle
you select a supported type in

00:13:57.846 --> 00:14:00.076 A:middle
the Attribute Inspector, you'll

00:13:57.846 --> 00:14:00.076 A:middle
the Attribute Inspector, you'll

00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:02.016 A:middle
now find a localized button.

00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:04.336 A:middle
Click that and we add the

00:14:04.336 --> 00:14:05.736 A:middle
localized of our attribute to

00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:07.566 A:middle
the content so adjacent to that

00:14:07.636 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
asset, you're ready to export an

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:11.526 A:middle
Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:14.146 A:middle
But, say that you're

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.186 A:middle
multilingual and doing some of

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.976 A:middle
the localization work yourself

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:20.566 A:middle
or maybe you're moving already

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:23.046 A:middle
localized images into the Asset

00:14:23.046 --> 00:14:25.306 A:middle
Catalog, well, when you click

00:14:25.306 --> 00:14:26.946 A:middle
that button, it's going to

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:29.516 A:middle
reveal check boxes with all of

00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:31.296 A:middle
the localizations already in

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:31.866 A:middle
your project.

00:14:33.296 --> 00:14:36.156 A:middle
Check any of those, and it will

00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:37.976 A:middle
create the wells in the Asset

00:14:37.976 --> 00:14:39.816 A:middle
Catalog Editor, so you can drag

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.766 A:middle
in the localized images like you

00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:43.506 A:middle
would any other asset.

00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:45.676 A:middle
Now, what about those new

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.246 A:middle
symbols?

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.876 A:middle
Well, SF system symbols are

00:14:49.876 --> 00:14:51.386 A:middle
localized for you, you don't

00:14:51.386 --> 00:14:52.526 A:middle
need to do any extra work.

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:55.516 A:middle
Custom symbols can also be

00:14:55.516 --> 00:14:56.126 A:middle
localized.

00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:57.446 A:middle
You can either set the

00:14:57.446 --> 00:14:59.246 A:middle
directionality, if you just need

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:00.696 A:middle
them to flip for right-to-left

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:00.696 A:middle
them to flip for right-to-left

00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:01.856 A:middle
languages like Arabic and

00:15:01.856 --> 00:15:04.256 A:middle
Hebrew, or you can do a full

00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:06.276 A:middle
localization cycle in the same

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:07.766 A:middle
workflow as images.

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.406 A:middle
You'll find the same localized

00:15:09.406 --> 00:15:10.566 A:middle
button in the Attribute

00:15:10.566 --> 00:15:11.106 A:middle
Inspector.

00:15:11.996 --> 00:15:13.506 A:middle
For more on symbols, please

00:15:13.506 --> 00:15:14.366 A:middle
check out the session

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:16.436 A:middle
Introducing SF Symbols later

00:15:16.436 --> 00:15:16.886 A:middle
today.

00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:20.286 A:middle
And with that I'd like to show

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.646 A:middle
you all this live in the demo.

00:15:22.516 --> 00:15:27.316 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
Now, you may have notice in

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.186 A:middle
Kulpreet's demo that we had not

00:15:31.186 --> 00:15:32.426 A:middle
localized the rest of these

00:15:32.426 --> 00:15:34.276 A:middle
images, so I'm going to do that

00:15:34.276 --> 00:15:34.596 A:middle
now.

00:15:34.996 --> 00:15:37.436 A:middle
If I go into Xcode, I can go to

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.436 A:middle
my asset catalog and let's fix

00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:40.796 A:middle
up this nice yoga image.

00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:43.486 A:middle
It's a very nice yoga retreat on

00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
the moon where you can feel

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:47.026 A:middle
lighter, mentally and

00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:47.606 A:middle
physically.

00:15:47.886 --> 00:15:50.216 A:middle
So, I just go over to the

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.996 A:middle
Attribute Inspector, click

00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:56.346 A:middle
localized, save, and that one is

00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:56.906 A:middle
ready to go.

00:15:57.636 --> 00:15:59.076 A:middle
I've already done this for my

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:02.316 A:middle
other vacation packages but I

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:02.316 A:middle
other vacation packages but I

00:16:02.446 --> 00:16:04.866 A:middle
have one image that's already

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:06.216 A:middle
localized and I want to move

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.406 A:middle
into my Asset Catalog to take

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:09.736 A:middle
advantage of all the great

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.946 A:middle
features of Asset Catalogs like

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.096 A:middle
being able to specify a

00:16:13.136 --> 00:16:14.466 A:middle
different appearance for Dark

00:16:14.466 --> 00:16:14.766 A:middle
mode.

00:16:15.786 --> 00:16:17.716 A:middle
This is super easy, I just grab

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:19.656 A:middle
my old image and drag in to the

00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:20.456 A:middle
Asset Catalog.

00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:23.626 A:middle
Xcode has created a new image

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:26.786 A:middle
set with the same name as my old

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:27.326 A:middle
resource.

00:16:27.956 --> 00:16:29.276 A:middle
So I don't even need to go make

00:16:29.276 --> 00:16:30.966 A:middle
a change in my storyboard, it

00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:31.986 A:middle
will just work.

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:33.806 A:middle
Now, I want to bring my

00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:35.726 A:middle
localizations along too, so I

00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:38.736 A:middle
click localized, check off the

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.756 A:middle
existing language and I'll drag

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:44.296 A:middle
that one into place, and save.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:46.696 A:middle
And I can just delete the old

00:16:46.696 --> 00:16:49.546 A:middle
one, from my project and on

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:49.826 A:middle
disk.

00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:53.436 A:middle
OK, so everything is ready.

00:16:53.436 --> 00:16:55.826 A:middle
I can now export an Xcode

00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:56.906 A:middle
Localization Catalog.

00:16:57.646 --> 00:16:59.226 A:middle
This is the same workflow as

00:16:59.266 --> 00:16:59.876 A:middle
Xcode 10.

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.346 A:middle
I select the project, go to

00:17:02.346 --> 00:17:04.955 A:middle
Editor, export for localization.

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:09.606 A:middle
And let's just do French for

00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:10.986 A:middle
now, I don't need the rest of

00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:11.205 A:middle
these.

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:14.195 A:middle
OK, export.

00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:19.715 A:middle
Let's see what we got.

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:21.886 A:middle
OK, here is my Xcode

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:23.506 A:middle
Localization Catalog and I can

00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:24.675 A:middle
just send this off to my

00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:26.665 A:middle
localizers and I'll find my

00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:27.336 A:middle
localizer.

00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:29.966 A:middle
I'm going to pop this open and I

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.946 A:middle
know I can dive right into

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:33.896 A:middle
Localize Contents and get to

00:17:33.896 --> 00:17:34.306 A:middle
work.

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:36.696 A:middle
So, what do we got here, OK,

00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:38.706 A:middle
here is the xliff, I know what

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:40.006 A:middle
to do with that, I know it has

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:41.446 A:middle
all the strings for the project

00:17:42.076 --> 00:17:43.236 A:middle
but what else is here?

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:46.306 A:middle
OK, we have an Asset Catalog.

00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:49.526 A:middle
And this is a fully formed Asset

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:49.996 A:middle
Catalog.

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:51.456 A:middle
I could go drag this into

00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:53.176 A:middle
another Xcode project and use

00:17:53.176 --> 00:17:53.386 A:middle
it.

00:17:53.916 --> 00:17:55.316 A:middle
But this one has been filtered

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.736 A:middle
down to only what the localizer

00:17:57.836 --> 00:17:58.486 A:middle
cares about.

00:17:58.896 --> 00:18:00.556 A:middle
So, it's only the localizable

00:17:58.896 --> 00:18:00.556 A:middle
So, it's only the localizable

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:02.796 A:middle
content and only for this

00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:03.666 A:middle
locale.

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:06.056 A:middle
Now, in this case, we don't have

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:08.506 A:middle
any French images yet, so

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:10.716 A:middle
[inaudible] on here, it's just

00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:12.046 A:middle
the copy of the English.

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:13.586 A:middle
This is for the convenience with

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:14.306 A:middle
the localizer.

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:16.046 A:middle
They can just jump in, start

00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:16.416 A:middle
editing.

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.126 A:middle
Save time, I've had some

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:20.916 A:middle
localizers do exactly that for

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:21.126 A:middle
me.

00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:22.996 A:middle
So, let's see what they sent

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:23.246 A:middle
back.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.546 A:middle
Just go open the catalog in my

00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:27.126 A:middle
favorite localization tool here.

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:34.346 A:middle
And we can see side-by-side the

00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:36.766 A:middle
English and French versions of

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:39.026 A:middle
all images there is yoga, yup.

00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:42.546 A:middle
OK. Let's import this into the

00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:45.216 A:middle
project, go back to Xcode, again

00:18:45.606 --> 00:18:47.486 A:middle
same workflow as Xcode 10,

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:49.146 A:middle
select the project, go to

00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:51.646 A:middle
Editor, import localizations,

00:18:52.336 --> 00:18:53.866 A:middle
select that finished Xcode

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.316 A:middle
Localization Catalog and click

00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:58.496 A:middle
Import, great.

00:18:58.496 --> 00:18:59.686 A:middle
So, now, I have to go to my

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:04.686 A:middle
asset catalog, I can see, I now

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:04.686 A:middle
asset catalog, I can see, I now

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.486 A:middle
have two versions of my image in

00:19:07.486 --> 00:19:08.956 A:middle
here all in one place.

00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:11.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:14.136 A:middle
But, it's kind of small, so

00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:15.306 A:middle
let's run the app again, so we

00:19:15.306 --> 00:19:16.366 A:middle
can see that a little bigger.

00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:21.896 A:middle
So, this time when we go back to

00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:24.146 A:middle
the app, we should see all of

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:27.166 A:middle
our vacation packages now with

00:19:27.226 --> 00:19:28.076 A:middle
the French titles.

00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:35.496 A:middle
There we go, beautiful.

00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:41.176 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:41.676 --> 00:19:44.976 A:middle
OK. Let's go back to the slides.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.746 A:middle
So, we just saw some of the

00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:51.426 A:middle
enhancements to localization

00:19:51.426 --> 00:19:52.726 A:middle
tooling in Xcode.

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:55.176 A:middle
Export and import of interface

00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:57.026 A:middle
Builder files is now a lot

00:19:57.106 --> 00:19:57.536 A:middle
faster.

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.356 A:middle
There's a new stringsdict rule

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.356 A:middle
There's a new stringsdict rule

00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:03.816 A:middle
for device-specific strings.

00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:05.566 A:middle
Settings Bundle is now easy to

00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:06.146 A:middle
localize.

00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:09.766 A:middle
And symbols and images are

00:20:09.766 --> 00:20:11.806 A:middle
localizable in Asset Catalogs.

00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:13.786 A:middle
Now, of course, once you've

00:20:13.786 --> 00:20:15.656 A:middle
localize your app you're going

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:17.326 A:middle
to want to test all of those

00:20:17.326 --> 00:20:18.326 A:middle
localizations.

00:20:19.006 --> 00:20:20.566 A:middle
And we've made that easier too.

00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:22.666 A:middle
And I'd like to call up Arthur

00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:23.946 A:middle
to tell you all about it.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:27.276 A:middle
[Applause]

00:20:27.776 --> 00:20:29.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Vivian.

00:20:31.046 --> 00:20:32.216 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how

00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:33.926 A:middle
you can take advantage of UI

00:20:33.926 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
testing for localization.

00:20:36.466 --> 00:20:38.246 A:middle
Testing is a significant part of

00:20:38.246 --> 00:20:39.226 A:middle
any development cycle.

00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.976 A:middle
It takes time and resources but

00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:43.066 A:middle
it's very important to help

00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:44.586 A:middle
catch regressions as you add new

00:20:44.586 --> 00:20:46.836 A:middle
features and detect bugs before

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:48.316 A:middle
you release your product to your

00:20:48.316 --> 00:20:48.726 A:middle
customers.

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:52.826 A:middle
If your app support more than

00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:54.496 A:middle
one language you will have to

00:20:54.496 --> 00:20:55.716 A:middle
test full language specific

00:20:55.716 --> 00:20:56.036 A:middle
issues.

00:20:56.866 --> 00:21:00.586 A:middle
Clip strings, truncated content,

00:20:56.866 --> 00:21:00.586 A:middle
Clip strings, truncated content,

00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:04.186 A:middle
overlapping layouts or even

00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:05.586 A:middle
issues specific to right-to-left

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:06.866 A:middle
languages such as Hebrew,

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:07.186 A:middle
Arabic.

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:12.106 A:middle
Now, if you want to test for

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:15.386 A:middle
every device you support, in

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:18.566 A:middle
every language you support, your

00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:19.956 A:middle
test metrics can repeat and

00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:20.256 A:middle
explore.

00:21:21.836 --> 00:21:23.636 A:middle
You can easily end up with

00:21:23.726 --> 00:21:24.616 A:middle
thousands of different

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:24.956 A:middle
scenarios.

00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:27.166 A:middle
And that will make it really

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.586 A:middle
difficult for your testers to

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:29.626 A:middle
cover all these scenarios

00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:29.936 A:middle
manually.

00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:32.136 A:middle
So, it's even more important to

00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:34.016 A:middle
include test in your project to

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.146 A:middle
help produce manual work load

00:21:35.206 --> 00:21:36.496 A:middle
for your QA.

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:40.936 A:middle
In Xcode 11, we made it easier

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:42.686 A:middle
for you to cover all of this

00:21:42.686 --> 00:21:44.196 A:middle
test automatically with test

00:21:44.706 --> 00:21:44.976 A:middle
plans.

00:21:45.516 --> 00:21:49.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:49.706 --> 00:21:51.316 A:middle
Test plan is a very easy way to

00:21:51.316 --> 00:21:53.126 A:middle
run the same tests multiple

00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:54.546 A:middle
times using different

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:55.176 A:middle
configurations.

00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:57.456 A:middle
I'm not going to go too much

00:21:57.456 --> 00:21:58.616 A:middle
into details about test plans

00:21:58.616 --> 00:21:58.866 A:middle
today.

00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
So please check out the Testing

00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
So please check out the Testing

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:01.866 A:middle
in Xcode session on Thursday

00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:04.136 A:middle
morning to learn more about it.

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:06.616 A:middle
What we will be covering is how

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.726 A:middle
you can use test plans in your

00:22:08.726 --> 00:22:10.546 A:middle
localization workflow.

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.526 A:middle
So, first, we will see how you

00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:15.616 A:middle
can make sure that your test

00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:18.916 A:middle
localization friendly, then

00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:20.466 A:middle
we'll talk about how you can use

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:22.466 A:middle
test plans to generate localized

00:22:23.196 --> 00:22:23.476 A:middle
screenshots.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.256 A:middle
And, finally, we will go over

00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:27.806 A:middle
some of the many use cases for

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:29.376 A:middle
those screenshots, because

00:22:29.376 --> 00:22:30.566 A:middle
they're not only good for

00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:31.686 A:middle
testing.

00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:36.316 A:middle
First, let's see how we can make

00:22:36.316 --> 00:22:37.876 A:middle
sure that your test can work in

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:38.916 A:middle
every language you run them in.

00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:43.026 A:middle
To do so, you should rely on

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.236 A:middle
Accessibility Identifiers.

00:22:45.536 --> 00:22:47.056 A:middle
These identifiers are unique,

00:22:47.646 --> 00:22:49.856 A:middle
stable, and we'll guarantee that

00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.236 A:middle
your test can run in any

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:51.626 A:middle
language.

00:22:53.626 --> 00:22:55.696 A:middle
You can easily set them up,

00:22:55.766 --> 00:22:56.776 A:middle
setting the property of the same

00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:59.796 A:middle
name in code or if you're using

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
interface Builder to create your

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
interface Builder to create your

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:03.626 A:middle
UI element, you can define them

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:04.796 A:middle
right there in the Identity

00:23:04.796 --> 00:23:08.966 A:middle
Inspector, and that's all it

00:23:08.966 --> 00:23:09.336 A:middle
takes.

00:23:09.696 --> 00:23:10.626 A:middle
So, now, that your test are

00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:12.656 A:middle
localization friendly, let's see

00:23:12.656 --> 00:23:13.826 A:middle
how we can use them to Generate

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:14.606 A:middle
Localized Screenshots.

00:23:16.716 --> 00:23:18.576 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier in your

00:23:18.576 --> 00:23:20.376 A:middle
test plan you can create

00:23:20.376 --> 00:23:21.486 A:middle
multiple configuration.

00:23:24.596 --> 00:23:26.116 A:middle
In each of this configuration

00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:28.396 A:middle
you can set a different language

00:23:28.486 --> 00:23:29.886 A:middle
and a different region to run

00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:30.346 A:middle
your testing.

00:23:33.436 --> 00:23:35.886 A:middle
Then by simply turning on the

00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:37.396 A:middle
Localization Screenshots option

00:23:37.556 --> 00:23:40.096 A:middle
in the UI testing section, your

00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:41.626 A:middle
screenshots will be persisted

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:43.886 A:middle
and there's so much you can do

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:46.086 A:middle
with them.

00:23:46.306 --> 00:23:47.136 A:middle
Well, some of this option

00:23:47.136 --> 00:23:48.486 A:middle
available in the Scheme Editor

00:23:48.856 --> 00:23:49.996 A:middle
that we already-- you already

00:23:49.996 --> 00:23:51.376 A:middle
know and use in case you haven't

00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:56.566 A:middle
market it to test plans yet.

00:23:56.566 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
And now that your tests are set

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:58.696 A:middle
up to capture Localized

00:23:58.696 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
Screenshots, let's see what we

00:23:58.696 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
Screenshots, let's see what we

00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:00.886 A:middle
can do with them.

00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:02.526 A:middle
They're actually a great

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:03.396 A:middle
marketing resource.

00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.286 A:middle
You can pass them along to your

00:24:05.286 --> 00:24:07.516 A:middle
marketing team or even upload

00:24:07.516 --> 00:24:08.966 A:middle
them to the App Store to

00:24:09.036 --> 00:24:11.396 A:middle
showcase your latest design.

00:24:11.556 --> 00:24:12.626 A:middle
You can use them in your

00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:14.096 A:middle
documentation or in your

00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:14.526 A:middle
tutorials.

00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:19.706 A:middle
But more importantly they can

00:24:19.706 --> 00:24:21.296 A:middle
help your localizers get the

00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:23.106 A:middle
context they need to provide you

00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
with high quality localization.

00:24:25.326 --> 00:24:27.656 A:middle
Let's take a quick example.

00:24:28.446 --> 00:24:31.596 A:middle
A simple word like Start in

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:33.616 A:middle
English could either be a verb

00:24:33.886 --> 00:24:36.426 A:middle
meaning to begin or it could be

00:24:36.426 --> 00:24:37.736 A:middle
a noun and referred to the

00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:38.526 A:middle
beginning of an event.

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:41.066 A:middle
While this difference might seem

00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:42.546 A:middle
really subtle in English, it can

00:24:42.546 --> 00:24:43.676 A:middle
lead to widely different

00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:44.586 A:middle
localizations in other

00:24:44.586 --> 00:24:45.226 A:middle
languages.

00:24:46.716 --> 00:24:48.586 A:middle
Here, we can see it's a noun

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.526 A:middle
because it's labeling the

00:24:49.596 --> 00:24:50.886 A:middle
starting date.

00:24:51.936 --> 00:24:53.776 A:middle
Giving this visual context to

00:24:53.776 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
your localizers we'll alleviate

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.096 A:middle
the ambiguity and make sure that

00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:58.146 A:middle
you get the most accurate

00:24:58.146 --> 00:24:58.756 A:middle
localization.

00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:03.706 A:middle
Last year, we introduced the

00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:04.836 A:middle
Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:08.226 A:middle
It's a very common way to handle

00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:10.446 A:middle
localizing both strings and

00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:12.786 A:middle
non-string based resources all

00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:14.556 A:middle
in one place.

00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:17.696 A:middle
In it we included the Notes

00:25:17.696 --> 00:25:19.546 A:middle
directory, specifically for you

00:25:19.546 --> 00:25:20.636 A:middle
to include contextual

00:25:20.636 --> 00:25:22.346 A:middle
information such as screenshots

00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:25.206 A:middle
for your localizers.

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:28.366 A:middle
This year, I'm very happy to say

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:29.646 A:middle
that we are automatically

00:25:29.646 --> 00:25:30.906 A:middle
including these screenshots for

00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:32.346 A:middle
you in the Xcode Localization

00:25:32.346 --> 00:25:32.976 A:middle
Catalog catalog.

00:25:33.516 --> 00:25:37.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.516 A:middle
And all it takes in one-- is one

00:25:40.516 --> 00:25:42.056 A:middle
single click during the Export

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:43.196 A:middle
Localization Workflow that

00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:44.596 A:middle
you're already using.

00:25:46.036 --> 00:25:48.376 A:middle
If you rely on automation to

00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:49.296 A:middle
generate your Localization

00:25:49.296 --> 00:25:51.186 A:middle
Catalog, you can simply add the

00:25:51.186 --> 00:25:52.656 A:middle
include screenshots argument to

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:53.466 A:middle
your xcodebuild

00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:54.726 A:middle
exportLocalizations command.

00:25:55.396 --> 00:25:58.546 A:middle
You can also customize which

00:25:58.546 --> 00:25:59.446 A:middle
screenshots I exported.

00:26:00.066 --> 00:26:01.276 A:middle
We made it easier for you to

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:03.126 A:middle
specify which test targets,

00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:05.676 A:middle
devices and languages I exported

00:26:05.886 --> 00:26:06.856 A:middle
to Localization Catalog.

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:11.396 A:middle
But that might be a lot of

00:26:11.396 --> 00:26:13.056 A:middle
screenshots for your localizers

00:26:13.056 --> 00:26:14.986 A:middle
to come through to see exactly

00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:16.466 A:middle
what Strings shows on the UI.

00:26:17.696 --> 00:26:20.186 A:middle
So, alongside every Localized

00:26:20.186 --> 00:26:21.976 A:middle
Screenshot that we generate, we

00:26:21.976 --> 00:26:23.466 A:middle
also generate a metadata.plist,

00:26:23.836 --> 00:26:25.626 A:middle
mapping the strings to the exact

00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:26.976 A:middle
location on the screenshots.

00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:31.166 A:middle
This plist include the strings

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:32.996 A:middle
IDs, the ones that you can find

00:26:32.996 --> 00:26:35.196 A:middle
in the Eclipse but also the

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:37.286 A:middle
framing formation, which is the

00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:39.256 A:middle
exact location of the Strings on

00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:39.726 A:middle
the screenshots.

00:26:41.276 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
This makes it really easy for

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:44.276 A:middle
localization tools to map the

00:26:44.276 --> 00:26:46.336 A:middle
Strings to the Eclipse and

00:26:46.336 --> 00:26:48.186 A:middle
highlight them directly on the

00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:49.116 A:middle
screenshots.

00:26:50.196 --> 00:26:51.506 A:middle
And once you export your

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
localization catalog, this new

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:55.256 A:middle
content is neatly organized in

00:26:55.256 --> 00:26:57.036 A:middle
the Notes directory and the

00:26:57.036 --> 00:26:59.006 A:middle
metadata.plist consolidated into

00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:01.026 A:middle
one for test targets and device.

00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:01.026 A:middle
one for test targets and device.

00:27:02.346 --> 00:27:04.536 A:middle
And this is how easy it is to

00:27:04.536 --> 00:27:05.776 A:middle
direct Localized Screenshots

00:27:05.996 --> 00:27:07.896 A:middle
with Xcode 11 and test plans.

00:27:08.516 --> 00:27:11.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:12.066 --> 00:27:13.616 A:middle
And with this, I'd like to call

00:27:13.616 --> 00:27:15.036 A:middle
Vivian back on stage to show you

00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:15.766 A:middle
all of it in action.

00:27:16.516 --> 00:27:20.256 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:20.756 --> 00:27:22.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Arthur.

00:27:22.586 --> 00:27:25.156 A:middle
So, now that we've localized our

00:27:25.156 --> 00:27:26.826 A:middle
app, we want to test those

00:27:26.826 --> 00:27:27.806 A:middle
Localizations.

00:27:33.136 --> 00:27:33.906 A:middle
All right.

00:27:34.706 --> 00:27:36.856 A:middle
So, I've already created some UI

00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:38.606 A:middle
tests for my project here.

00:27:39.136 --> 00:27:41.576 A:middle
I have some here that will

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.576 A:middle
capture all of my screens, which

00:27:44.716 --> 00:27:46.206 A:middle
I think would be really helpful

00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:48.226 A:middle
for giving to my localizers for

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:48.686 A:middle
context.

00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:51.556 A:middle
And I have another test that

00:27:51.556 --> 00:27:53.216 A:middle
just zips in there and gets a

00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:55.286 A:middle
picture of those nice vacation

00:27:55.286 --> 00:27:56.676 A:middle
package images, which I think

00:27:56.676 --> 00:27:57.806 A:middle
would be good for marketing.

00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:00.556 A:middle
But I want to run all of these

00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:00.556 A:middle
But I want to run all of these

00:28:00.556 --> 00:28:03.246 A:middle
test in all the localizations I

00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:03.816 A:middle
support.

00:28:03.816 --> 00:28:05.756 A:middle
And that could take some time

00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:07.496 A:middle
which is where test plans comes

00:28:07.496 --> 00:28:07.976 A:middle
in handy.

00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:09.466 A:middle
So you can add a test plan to

00:28:09.466 --> 00:28:10.816 A:middle
your project like any other

00:28:10.816 --> 00:28:11.196 A:middle
file.

00:28:11.786 --> 00:28:14.306 A:middle
File, New, File, and there's a

00:28:14.306 --> 00:28:15.776 A:middle
template for it, so I can just

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:17.066 A:middle
search for plan.

00:28:17.066 --> 00:28:17.476 A:middle
There it is.

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:19.636 A:middle
You can also, migrate your

00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:21.816 A:middle
existing test to test plans.

00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:23.136 A:middle
Let's save time.

00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:24.446 A:middle
I've already made one.

00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:27.906 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:30.516 A:middle
OK. So I have two test targets

00:28:30.516 --> 00:28:30.806 A:middle
here.

00:28:30.806 --> 00:28:33.396 A:middle
I have one that will run all of

00:28:33.396 --> 00:28:36.786 A:middle
my screens tests and another

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:37.996 A:middle
that's just going to capture

00:28:37.996 --> 00:28:39.766 A:middle
that marketing image.

00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:42.276 A:middle
I also have some configuration

00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:42.706 A:middle
setup.

00:28:43.206 --> 00:28:44.956 A:middle
The important thing here is in

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.226 A:middle
the shared Settings.

00:28:47.616 --> 00:28:49.466 A:middle
Localization Screenshots is

00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:50.386 A:middle
turned on.

00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:53.756 A:middle
So, I've got one configuration

00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:55.586 A:middle
for English, United States and

00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:58.736 A:middle
another for Swedish, Sweden.

00:28:58.816 --> 00:29:00.496 A:middle
So, since I've just got those

00:28:58.816 --> 00:29:00.496 A:middle
So, since I've just got those

00:29:00.496 --> 00:29:02.046 A:middle
images in French, I'm going to

00:29:02.046 --> 00:29:03.336 A:middle
add one for French.

00:29:03.796 --> 00:29:04.806 A:middle
Just click Plus.

00:29:05.616 --> 00:29:07.966 A:middle
Let's call this one French,

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:08.706 A:middle
France.

00:29:09.226 --> 00:29:14.266 A:middle
OK. And we will set the

00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:17.586 A:middle
application language to French

00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:20.806 A:middle
and the application region to

00:29:21.446 --> 00:29:21.756 A:middle
France.

00:29:23.246 --> 00:29:25.506 A:middle
OK. It's now-- I think, I'll

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:27.506 A:middle
rerun just the test to get that

00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:28.336 A:middle
marketing image.

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:29.846 A:middle
So, I can get a picture of those

00:29:29.846 --> 00:29:31.836 A:middle
newly localized French images.

00:29:32.486 --> 00:29:35.556 A:middle
So, I go back to my UI test in

00:29:35.556 --> 00:29:36.146 A:middle
order to run it.

00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:37.816 A:middle
And now, when I click the test

00:29:37.856 --> 00:29:40.346 A:middle
diamond, instead of running my

00:29:40.346 --> 00:29:42.436 A:middle
test once, it's going to run it

00:29:42.806 --> 00:29:44.426 A:middle
with all of my configurations

00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:45.666 A:middle
and we can actually watch as it

00:29:45.666 --> 00:29:46.606 A:middle
goes through all of this.

00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:49.196 A:middle
So, it's going to run three

00:29:49.196 --> 00:29:53.696 A:middle
times, English and then Swedish

00:29:54.196 --> 00:29:55.696 A:middle
except my localizers aren't

00:29:55.696 --> 00:29:55.936 A:middle
done.

00:29:55.936 --> 00:29:56.996 A:middle
So, we'll probably going to see

00:29:57.056 --> 00:29:58.756 A:middle
some English strings again and

00:29:58.756 --> 00:30:00.556 A:middle
then one last time in French.

00:29:58.756 --> 00:30:00.556 A:middle
then one last time in French.

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.436 A:middle
And I know that this will work

00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:05.436 A:middle
because I use accessibility

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:07.056 A:middle
identifiers like Arthur said.

00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:08.896 A:middle
So my test will work with all

00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:10.526 A:middle
three language configurations.

00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:12.686 A:middle
All right.

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:16.626 A:middle
Here we go again.

00:30:16.626 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
French, OK, great.

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:21.586 A:middle
So let's see what we got here.

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:24.516 A:middle
OK. If I look at the test that I

00:30:24.516 --> 00:30:25.106 A:middle
just ran.

00:30:25.106 --> 00:30:28.236 A:middle
OK. I can see it run, it's on my

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:30.026 A:middle
configurations and if I check

00:30:30.026 --> 00:30:32.296 A:middle
out French and look at my

00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:32.956 A:middle
attachment.

00:30:34.216 --> 00:30:34.866 A:middle
Beautiful.

00:30:34.976 --> 00:30:36.206 A:middle
So, I can use this one for

00:30:36.206 --> 00:30:36.766 A:middle
marketing.

00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:39.756 A:middle
But my localizers are waiting

00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:41.266 A:middle
for an update on Swedish that

00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:42.386 A:middle
they can finish that.

00:30:42.856 --> 00:30:45.206 A:middle
So I need to send them a fresh

00:30:45.256 --> 00:30:48.096 A:middle
Xcode Localization Catalog and I

00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:49.556 A:middle
want to make sure that they get

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.636 A:middle
that really tricky start string,

00:30:51.636 --> 00:30:51.956 A:middle
right.

00:30:52.146 --> 00:30:53.706 A:middle
So, let's make sure they get a

00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:54.246 A:middle
screenshot.

00:30:54.776 --> 00:30:57.576 A:middle
I ran my test earlier for it to

00:30:57.576 --> 00:30:58.906 A:middle
capture all of my screens.

00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:01.376 A:middle
So, if I look at the Swedish

00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:05.236 A:middle
one-- let's see if we can find

00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:07.086 A:middle
that tricky start string.

00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:09.366 A:middle
I think it's down here.

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:11.006 A:middle
Yeah. There we go.

00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:12.216 A:middle
OK. So they haven't translated

00:31:12.216 --> 00:31:14.396 A:middle
Start yet or End and they got

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:15.276 A:middle
Travelers.

00:31:16.136 --> 00:31:19.936 A:middle
And also in here I have that

00:31:20.086 --> 00:31:22.836 A:middle
plist with the frame information

00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:24.336 A:middle
which should be useful.

00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:28.366 A:middle
So, I'm now ready to export an

00:31:28.366 --> 00:31:29.626 A:middle
Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:31:30.406 --> 00:31:32.066 A:middle
Select the project, go to

00:31:32.066 --> 00:31:34.566 A:middle
Editor, export localization.

00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:37.596 A:middle
And this time, I'm going to do

00:31:37.756 --> 00:31:41.226 A:middle
Swedish and importantly I'm

00:31:41.226 --> 00:31:42.946 A:middle
going to click Include

00:31:42.986 --> 00:31:43.696 A:middle
screenshots.

00:31:44.496 --> 00:31:45.346 A:middle
All right.

00:31:45.346 --> 00:31:46.996 A:middle
Xcode has found I have 19

00:31:46.996 --> 00:31:47.986 A:middle
screenshots available.

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:49.226 A:middle
Let's see exactly what I have

00:31:49.226 --> 00:31:49.526 A:middle
here.

00:31:49.526 --> 00:31:51.796 A:middle
If I click customize, I can see

00:31:52.476 --> 00:31:54.776 A:middle
I ran my test with iPhone 8

00:31:54.886 --> 00:31:56.966 A:middle
Plus, 10R and 10S.

00:31:56.966 --> 00:31:59.176 A:middle
So, if there's any layout issues

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:01.576 A:middle
that might catch some of those.

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:01.576 A:middle
that might catch some of those.

00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:02.466 A:middle
OK. I'm definitely going to keep

00:32:02.466 --> 00:32:03.196 A:middle
all of those.

00:32:04.776 --> 00:32:08.616 A:middle
And, now, I'm ready to export.

00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:16.276 A:middle
OK. So, now, if I look at my new

00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:20.316 A:middle
Localization Catalog, now in the

00:32:20.316 --> 00:32:22.176 A:middle
Notes directory I have

00:32:22.586 --> 00:32:23.286 A:middle
screenshots.

00:32:24.396 --> 00:32:26.106 A:middle
And here I can see I have all of

00:32:26.106 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
my screenshots organized by test

00:32:28.806 --> 00:32:30.206 A:middle
target and device.

00:32:30.936 --> 00:32:31.916 A:middle
So, actually, I'm going to pull

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:33.866 A:middle
the marketing ones out for later

00:32:34.576 --> 00:32:36.606 A:middle
and just send the rest to my

00:32:36.606 --> 00:32:37.316 A:middle
Localizers.

00:32:38.046 --> 00:32:41.626 A:middle
So we look in here, we can see I

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.506 A:middle
have all of my screenshots.

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:48.976 A:middle
OK. There's that tricky start

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.746 A:middle
string and actually worst than

00:32:50.866 --> 00:32:53.146 A:middle
Start, you can see in this one

00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:54.416 A:middle
screenshot, we have the string

00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:58.346 A:middle
Book, one, two, three times.

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:03.896 A:middle
So that plist with the frame

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:03.896 A:middle
So that plist with the frame

00:33:03.896 --> 00:33:05.036 A:middle
informations can be really

00:33:05.036 --> 00:33:05.526 A:middle
useful.

00:33:05.856 --> 00:33:07.566 A:middle
And this is the consolidated

00:33:07.566 --> 00:33:09.116 A:middle
plist, so it has the frame

00:33:09.116 --> 00:33:10.916 A:middle
information for all of the

00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:13.256 A:middle
strings captured in this entire

00:33:13.256 --> 00:33:15.076 A:middle
set of screenshots.

00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:18.056 A:middle
So, they're really handy because

00:33:18.456 --> 00:33:20.356 A:middle
now when I'm on localizer I can

00:33:20.356 --> 00:33:22.246 A:middle
open the catalog in my favorite

00:33:22.246 --> 00:33:23.326 A:middle
Localization Tool.

00:33:23.326 --> 00:33:29.386 A:middle
And now, I can preview where

00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:30.406 A:middle
string shows up.

00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:38.066 A:middle
And not only can I see one place

00:33:38.276 --> 00:33:40.296 A:middle
where a string shows, it will

00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:42.586 A:middle
show me all of the screenshots

00:33:42.586 --> 00:33:43.846 A:middle
that capture the given string.

00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.006 A:middle
So, my localizers are going to

00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:48.716 A:middle
be thrilled.

00:33:52.036 --> 00:33:53.506 A:middle
All right, let's wrap things up.

00:33:55.736 --> 00:33:59.386 A:middle
So, today, we saw how users can

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:01.146 A:middle
run your app in a different

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:01.146 A:middle
run your app in a different

00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:02.666 A:middle
language to their system

00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:03.236 A:middle
language.

00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:05.856 A:middle
We saw a bunch of improvements

00:34:06.536 --> 00:34:08.186 A:middle
to the localization tooling in

00:34:08.186 --> 00:34:11.596 A:middle
Xcode, including faster export

00:34:11.596 --> 00:34:13.376 A:middle
of interface Builder files, a

00:34:13.376 --> 00:34:15.676 A:middle
new stringsdict rule, how easy

00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:17.206 A:middle
it is to localize your settings

00:34:17.246 --> 00:34:18.716 A:middle
bundle, and of course how you

00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:21.456 A:middle
can now localize images right in

00:34:21.456 --> 00:34:22.466 A:middle
your Asset Catalog.

00:34:23.366 --> 00:34:26.446 A:middle
We also saw how you can generate

00:34:26.446 --> 00:34:28.846 A:middle
Localized screenshots with your

00:34:28.846 --> 00:34:31.746 A:middle
Tests and some of the uses for

00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.456 A:middle
those screenshots.

00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:36.766 A:middle
