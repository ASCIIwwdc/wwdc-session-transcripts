[ Music ]

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:13.776 A:middle
And thank you for joining our

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:14.226 A:middle
session.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:16.396 A:middle
My name is David Lui, and I'm

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:18.476 A:middle
thrilled to be back here at WWDC

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:20.816 A:middle
to share with you all the new

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:22.876 A:middle
and exciting features in AR

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:23.686 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:27.386 A:middle
Last year, with iOS 12, we

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:29.076 A:middle
introduced AR Quick Look, which

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:30.776 A:middle
set the foundation and provided

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
a great single-model AR

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:34.496 A:middle
previewing experience.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.706 A:middle
We made it really easy to

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.796 A:middle
experience 3D content in your

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:41.106 A:middle
world in an immersive and

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.376 A:middle
realistic way using physically

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.176 A:middle
based rendering.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.416 A:middle
AR Quick Look is built in as

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:49.736 A:middle
part of iOS and is available on

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:52.456 A:middle
the web and in many applications

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.446 A:middle
like messages and Apple News.

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.166 A:middle
We gave a session last year

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.236 A:middle
where you could learn more about

00:00:58.236 --> 00:00:59.586 A:middle
how to integrate AR Quick Look

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:01.876 A:middle
into your application and

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:04.436 A:middle
website along with how to create

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.266 A:middle
great-looking content for it.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.096 A:middle
So, in this session, we'll go

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:10.096 A:middle
over our integration with

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.836 A:middle
Reality Composer and how AR

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:13.346 A:middle
Quick Look views the produced

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:16.326 A:middle
content, improvements to the

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.026 A:middle
visual rendering, and experience

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:20.606 A:middle
within AR Quick Look for greater

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.596 A:middle
realism and content immersion.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.206 A:middle
Along with how to support all

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:27.096 A:middle
these new features on the web

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:28.696 A:middle
including customizing the

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:30.626 A:middle
preview and experience for your

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:33.656 A:middle
applications, and lastly, our

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.606 A:middle
enhanced integration with retail

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:37.096 A:middle
with support for call to action

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:40.076 A:middle
and Apple Pay.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:41.716 A:middle
So, earlier in the week, we

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.306 A:middle
talked about Reality Kit and

00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:45.886 A:middle
Reality Composer, our new macOS

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:48.676 A:middle
and iOS tool for simple AR-based

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.766 A:middle
content creation, where we can

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.916 A:middle
quickly create really amazing,

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:55.796 A:middle
rich content with activity for

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:56.356 A:middle
applications.

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:59.756 A:middle
You can take all that same rich

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:00.706 A:middle
content and share them through

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:00.706 A:middle
content and share them through

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:02.626 A:middle
various applications, all of

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:04.666 A:middle
which can be viewed in AR Quick

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:04.936 A:middle
Look.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:06.786 A:middle
It's a really great way to

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:08.346 A:middle
easily realize these new

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.506 A:middle
interactive experiences and view

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:11.686 A:middle
them in a feature-rich

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:13.456 A:middle
environment all by simply

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:15.056 A:middle
sharing the 3D model file.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:18.366 A:middle
And we really mean feature rich.

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:20.716 A:middle
In support of Reality Kit and

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:22.686 A:middle
Reality Composer, we added new

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:24.146 A:middle
rendering effects to AR Quick

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:25.716 A:middle
Look like dynamic ray-traced

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.706 A:middle
shadows and people occlusion to

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:29.646 A:middle
help improve the realism of 3D

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.216 A:middle
content placed in your world.

00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:33.736 A:middle
We've also added a lot more

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.196 A:middle
capabilities, like multimodel

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.846 A:middle
support and a built-in animation

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.616 A:middle
scrubber that not only enhances

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.166 A:middle
the AR experience but gives you

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.066 A:middle
more control over the content.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:44.866 A:middle
Adopting AR Quick Look is the

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.706 A:middle
easiest way to take advantage of

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:48.696 A:middle
all these new features, to bring

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:51.116 A:middle
an amazing AR experience to any

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:53.446 A:middle
application or website and seek

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.426 A:middle
content as if it was actually

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:56.256 A:middle
there with you.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:02:59.836 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.326 A:middle
AR Quick Look is built around

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:03.786 A:middle
USDZ.

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:06.986 A:middle
Today, people create content for

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.146 A:middle
AR Quick Look using their

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:10.256 A:middle
favorite 3D modelling software

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.026 A:middle
and exporting that scene as a

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:13.776 A:middle
USDZ file.

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.376 A:middle
You can then view that content

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:18.036 A:middle
in AR Quick Look where you can

00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:19.846 A:middle
push the object into your world

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:20.266 A:middle
to view it.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.656 A:middle
You can take that same USDZ file

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.436 A:middle
and import it into Reality

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:26.866 A:middle
Composer where you can add new

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:29.436 A:middle
behaviors and interactivity that

00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:31.386 A:middle
all gets packaged up in our new

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.126 A:middle
reality file format.

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:35.906 A:middle
AR Quick Look supports viewing

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.086 A:middle
these new reality files and is a

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:39.446 A:middle
great place to play with these

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.296 A:middle
experiences.

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:43.426 A:middle
For many users, AR Quick Look is

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:45.886 A:middle
the destination to explore and

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
interact with 3D content as

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:50.256 A:middle
people share these models from

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:52.646 A:middle
one device to another across

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:53.726 A:middle
many applications.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.756 A:middle
Scenes are the fundamental

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.086 A:middle
building blocks of reality

00:03:59.086 --> 00:03:59.576 A:middle
files.

00:04:00.176 --> 00:04:01.296 A:middle
A Reality Composer scene

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:02.806 A:middle
contains a specified anchor

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.646 A:middle
type, such as a horizontal or

00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:07.366 A:middle
face placement, and one or more

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:10.056 A:middle
objects placed in the scene.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:11.666 A:middle
These objects can contain any

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:13.086 A:middle
combination of interactive

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:16.156 A:middle
behaviors, captivating audio,

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.995 A:middle
and realistic physics.

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:20.505 A:middle
Together, this produces a really

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.456 A:middle
compelling stand-alone AR

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:24.316 A:middle
experience represented as a

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:25.136 A:middle
Reality file.

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.586 A:middle
So, let's take a closer look at

00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:28.456 A:middle
some of these properties.

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:31.676 A:middle
Every scene has an anchor type,

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.486 A:middle
which describes how the model

00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:34.596 A:middle
should be placed in the world.

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:36.486 A:middle
Last year, AR Quick Look

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:37.966 A:middle
supported horizontal anchors

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.986 A:middle
like tables, floors.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.436 A:middle
And this year, we've added

00:04:42.436 --> 00:04:43.996 A:middle
support for vertical surfaces

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:48.026 A:middle
like walls as well as faces and

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:49.796 A:middle
known 2D images in your

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:50.356 A:middle
environment.

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.826 A:middle
So, let's describe each of these

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:54.416 A:middle
in detail.

00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:57.916 A:middle
Horizontal and vertical anchors

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.936 A:middle
are found in everyday settings

00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:01.496 A:middle
such as tables and floors.

00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:01.496 A:middle
such as tables and floors.

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:04.356 A:middle
Since it is so common, objects

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:05.836 A:middle
are placed on the first detected

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:08.056 A:middle
plane, and we make it really

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:09.566 A:middle
easy to go between different

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:11.396 A:middle
surfaces, just like dragging the

00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:13.416 A:middle
model from one surface to

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:13.756 A:middle
another.

00:05:15.376 --> 00:05:16.916 A:middle
Rotation gestures differ

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.276 A:middle
depending on whether the object

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:20.146 A:middle
is on a horizontal surface or a

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:21.096 A:middle
vertical surface.

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:24.086 A:middle
And this behavior applies for

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:26.266 A:middle
both reality files and USDZ

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:26.666 A:middle
files.

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:29.566 A:middle
So, let me show you how to place

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
this picture frame on the wall

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:32.556 A:middle
starting from a horizontal

00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:33.106 A:middle
surface.

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:34.926 A:middle
I'll push the frame onto this

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:36.716 A:middle
table, and you can then tap and

00:05:36.716 --> 00:05:38.586 A:middle
drag the model over to the couch

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:40.226 A:middle
and position it onto the wall.

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:42.356 A:middle
You can also start looking

00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:43.436 A:middle
directly [applause]-- thank you.

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:45.706 A:middle
You can also start looking

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:47.836 A:middle
directly at the wall and pushing

00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.166 A:middle
the content from your device.

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.956 A:middle
It's a really seamless way to go

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:53.146 A:middle
between planes in order to

00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:54.736 A:middle
anchor your content in the world

00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:56.486 A:middle
as you would like.

00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:59.176 A:middle
You can also anchor virtual

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
content to real-world objects

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
content to real-world objects

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:01.516 A:middle
that can move.

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:03.416 A:middle
Like putting on eyeglasses on

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:04.006 A:middle
your face.

00:06:05.026 --> 00:06:06.606 A:middle
For these type of experiences,

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:07.956 A:middle
AR Quick Look automatically

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:09.686 A:middle
turns on the front camera and

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:11.386 A:middle
anchors the content based off of

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:13.176 A:middle
how it's authored relative to

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:14.096 A:middle
the center of your face.

00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:16.986 A:middle
Face occlusion geometry from

00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
ARKit is used in AR Quick Look

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.516 A:middle
to realistically obscure the

00:06:20.516 --> 00:06:22.416 A:middle
object position on your face so

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.196 A:middle
that they will intersect and

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:26.546 A:middle
break the illusion.

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:28.486 A:middle
Once anchored, scale and rotate

00:06:28.486 --> 00:06:30.556 A:middle
gestures are disabled to ring

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.456 A:middle
true to their authored size and

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.716 A:middle
correctly positioned to your

00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:34.166 A:middle
face.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.886 A:middle
You can also take selfies with

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:38.336 A:middle
your friends when trying on the

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:40.046 A:middle
same pair of glasses in AR Quick

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:42.316 A:middle
Look and with ARKit 3 this year,

00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:45.026 A:middle
there's support for up to three

00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
faces.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.176 A:middle
This experience is only

00:06:48.176 --> 00:06:49.826 A:middle
available on devices with a

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.926 A:middle
front-facing TrueDepth camera.

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:55.136 A:middle
And for other devices, the

00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:56.556 A:middle
anchor is treated as if it was a

00:06:56.556 --> 00:06:58.046 A:middle
horizontal anchor.

00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:01.776 A:middle
So here are some examples of my

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:02.986 A:middle
friends trying on different

00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:04.136 A:middle
accessories, such as a

00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:05.786 A:middle
masquerade mask, propeller

00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:07.236 A:middle
beanie, and this great-looking

00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:08.466 A:middle
mustache in AR Quick Look.

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:10.466 A:middle
This makes the content more

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:11.996 A:middle
animated and really feel like

00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:13.716 A:middle
it's part of you since it's

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.156 A:middle
interacting with using your

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:15.406 A:middle
face.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:17.526 A:middle
It's a really great way to

00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:19.416 A:middle
express yourself and play with

00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:21.326 A:middle
these models in a brand-new way.

00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:25.556 A:middle
AR Quick Look uses the front

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.826 A:middle
camera if there is a single face

00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:28.206 A:middle
anchor.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.136 A:middle
If there are any other scenes,

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:31.626 A:middle
then AR Quick Look will fall

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:32.746 A:middle
back treating this as a

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
horizontal anchor experience.

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.916 A:middle
So, for example, say you have

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.136 A:middle
two face anchor scenes offered

00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:40.466 A:middle
in Reality Composer like I have

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:41.296 A:middle
on the left-hand side.

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:42.966 A:middle
So there are two different

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:43.656 A:middle
styles of glasses.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:45.836 A:middle
When previewed in AR Quick Look

00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:47.146 A:middle
on the right-hand side, these

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.396 A:middle
glasses will be placed into the

00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:50.556 A:middle
world as a horizontal experience

00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:52.176 A:middle
so you can compare them side by

00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:52.536 A:middle
side.

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:56.506 A:middle
Another type of dynamic anchor

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.456 A:middle
is an image anchor, where

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.296 A:middle
virtual content can track and

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.296 A:middle
virtual content can track and

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:02.436 A:middle
follow a real-world image.

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:04.646 A:middle
In AR Quick Look, we want users

00:08:04.646 --> 00:08:06.066 A:middle
to be able to preview the scene

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.426 A:middle
in the world without having

00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
access to the physical image.

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.486 A:middle
So, if no anchor is detected, AR

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.736 A:middle
Quick Look will directly place

00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:15.006 A:middle
it on the first plane that it

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:15.406 A:middle
finds.

00:08:16.426 --> 00:08:18.806 A:middle
And later, when it detects the

00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:20.226 A:middle
specified anchor, it will

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:22.616 A:middle
magically move over and attach

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:23.526 A:middle
to the real-world image.

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:26.876 A:middle
And finally, if the anchor

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.246 A:middle
disappears, then the scene will

00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:31.136 A:middle
reattach to the last plane that

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:33.246 A:middle
it found.

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:35.676 A:middle
One thing to note is that

00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:38.116 A:middle
gestures like scale and rotate

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:39.206 A:middle
are disabled.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:43.265 A:middle
And like fixed anchors, the

00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:44.876 A:middle
content remains true to its

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:45.626 A:middle
authored size.

00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:47.486 A:middle
So, let's take a look at this

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.216 A:middle
toy rocket model I've authored

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:51.146 A:middle
in Reality Composer as an image

00:08:51.146 --> 00:08:52.046 A:middle
anchor experience.

00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:54.556 A:middle
You can see how the content is

00:08:54.646 --> 00:08:55.906 A:middle
anchored to the real-world image

00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:57.296 A:middle
and follows each and every

00:08:57.296 --> 00:09:01.166 A:middle
movement whether translate or

00:08:57.296 --> 00:09:01.166 A:middle
movement whether translate or

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:01.666 A:middle
rotation.

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:04.446 A:middle
We really encourage people to

00:09:04.446 --> 00:09:06.136 A:middle
engage with the virtual content

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.366 A:middle
and really move around since

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:09.086 A:middle
this is an AR experience.

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:11.186 A:middle
This means directly moving the

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:12.916 A:middle
anchor closer to you, to

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:15.036 A:middle
illustrate change in scale, or

00:09:15.036 --> 00:09:16.656 A:middle
rotating the image anchor to

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.066 A:middle
view the scene from different

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:18.666 A:middle
perspectives.

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:22.956 A:middle
Now that you've anchored content

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:24.856 A:middle
into your world, you can add

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.646 A:middle
behaviors to bring interactivity

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:27.406 A:middle
to your scene.

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:30.656 A:middle
Behaviors are comprised of a

00:09:30.656 --> 00:09:33.106 A:middle
trigger and one or more actions,

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:36.146 A:middle
and these are all defined in the

00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:38.556 A:middle
bottom behaviors panel in

00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:40.056 A:middle
Reality Composer, where we can

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:42.276 A:middle
attach any combination of

00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:43.806 A:middle
triggers and action sequences.

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
This is a really great way to

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:49.066 A:middle
provide more interactivity

00:09:49.316 --> 00:09:51.696 A:middle
between the user and the virtual

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:53.586 A:middle
content and create a more

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:55.476 A:middle
immersive and engaging user

00:09:55.476 --> 00:09:56.166 A:middle
experience.

00:09:58.016 --> 00:09:59.826 A:middle
So there's a variety of triggers

00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
and actions defined in Reality

00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
and actions defined in Reality

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:03.006 A:middle
Kit that's exposed in Reality

00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:04.326 A:middle
Composer, and these are all

00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:05.896 A:middle
natively supported in AR Quick

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:06.096 A:middle
Look.

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:09.706 A:middle
You can take a Tap trigger and

00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:10.976 A:middle
attach it to your bike object

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:13.016 A:middle
where on tap the bike will

00:10:13.016 --> 00:10:15.166 A:middle
disassemble, revealing all the

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.866 A:middle
individual parts and components,

00:10:17.426 --> 00:10:19.216 A:middle
and this is all done by the Move

00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:19.596 A:middle
action.

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:22.996 A:middle
You can also attach a Proximity

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:25.106 A:middle
trigger to a boom box where you

00:10:25.106 --> 00:10:26.136 A:middle
can get, when you get close to

00:10:26.136 --> 00:10:27.946 A:middle
it, music starts playing that I

00:10:27.946 --> 00:10:30.096 A:middle
can jam to.

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:32.096 A:middle
One thing to note is that AR

00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:33.046 A:middle
Quick Look does not support

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:36.826 A:middle
custom app actions.

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:38.166 A:middle
There's so many things you can

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:40.396 A:middle
make with this, and to learn

00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:41.906 A:middle
more about behaviors and how to

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.316 A:middle
create interactive AR

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:45.016 A:middle
experiences, check out the

00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:46.796 A:middle
Building AR Experiences with

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:48.556 A:middle
Reality Composer session from

00:10:48.556 --> 00:10:48.926 A:middle
this year.

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:53.666 A:middle
So, all of these new features I

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.456 A:middle
described are all driven from

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:56.686 A:middle
this new Reality File.

00:10:57.586 --> 00:10:59.726 A:middle
Reality File is a self-contained

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.386 A:middle
format that contains multiple

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.386 A:middle
format that contains multiple

00:11:01.386 --> 00:11:03.406 A:middle
scenes with any number of

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:05.666 A:middle
objects, along with anchoring

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.346 A:middle
type information, like whether

00:11:07.346 --> 00:11:08.296 A:middle
the content should be placed on

00:11:08.296 --> 00:11:10.556 A:middle
a vertical wall or on a person's

00:11:10.556 --> 00:11:13.456 A:middle
face and interactivity data with

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:15.416 A:middle
behaviors like tap triggers and

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:18.166 A:middle
audio actions for realistic and

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:19.666 A:middle
interact AR experience.

00:11:21.686 --> 00:11:23.306 A:middle
Reality files work hand in hand

00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:25.406 A:middle
with USDZ, and USDZ is the

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:28.126 A:middle
perfect format for sharing and

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:30.316 A:middle
publishing individual 3D models

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:33.196 A:middle
on the web or in your app for

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:33.886 A:middle
use in AR.

00:11:35.406 --> 00:11:36.406 A:middle
And if you want to use these

00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:38.026 A:middle
USDZ models you've created over

00:11:38.026 --> 00:11:40.226 A:middle
the years, to make interactive

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:41.976 A:middle
AR experiences, you can combine

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:43.666 A:middle
them in Reality Composer and

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:45.026 A:middle
export out a reality file.

00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:48.416 A:middle
Either format can be viewed in

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.256 A:middle
AR Quick Look on iOS 13.

00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:52.566 A:middle
Now, I'd like to invite my

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:53.626 A:middle
colleague, Jerry, to give you a

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:54.876 A:middle
demo with these new experiences.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:55.966 A:middle
Jerry.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:59.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:00.096 --> 00:12:00.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, David.

00:12:01.816 --> 00:12:02.756 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:04.846 A:middle
Today I am very excited to show

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:06.276 A:middle
you previewing Reality Files

00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:10.866 A:middle
inside AR Quick Look.

00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:14.296 A:middle
Now, yesterday at the Building

00:12:14.296 --> 00:12:16.066 A:middle
AR Experiences with Reality

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:17.746 A:middle
Composer, my friend Powell

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:19.096 A:middle
created a quick lesson

00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:20.746 A:middle
illustrating different seasons

00:12:20.746 --> 00:12:23.026 A:middle
on Earth, and he sent me a copy.

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:26.236 A:middle
So let's go ahead and view that

00:12:26.236 --> 00:12:26.916 A:middle
in AR Quick Look.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.396 A:middle
Now, as you may recall, this

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.216 A:middle
entire experience is driven

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.626 A:middle
through scene start triggers.

00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:48.716 A:middle
For example, the moon, it

00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:50.006 A:middle
triggers the moon to rotate

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:51.736 A:middle
around the Earth and the Earth

00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:53.686 A:middle
to rotate around the sun.

00:12:54.276 --> 00:12:56.896 A:middle
As the Earth circles the sun,

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.686 A:middle
the appropriate season appears.

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:04.326 A:middle
And this is created using weight

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:06.556 A:middle
action followed by a show

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:06.846 A:middle
action.

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:09.886 A:middle
And after a slight delay, the

00:13:09.886 --> 00:13:12.096 A:middle
sign disappears using a hide

00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:12.456 A:middle
action.

00:13:16.286 --> 00:13:17.546 A:middle
Now, you may have noticed that

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.776 A:middle
no matter where I look, the sign

00:13:19.856 --> 00:13:21.666 A:middle
is always oriented towards me,

00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:26.706 A:middle
and this is achieved by using a

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:27.466 A:middle
look at action.

00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:35.506 A:middle
So, that's a quick overview of

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:36.766 A:middle
how easy it is to preview

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.456 A:middle
Reality Files, such as this

00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:40.506 A:middle
short lesson inside AR Quick

00:13:40.976 --> 00:13:41.086 A:middle
Look.

00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:44.426 A:middle
And now, I have another demo,

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:46.136 A:middle
and for this, we're going to

00:13:46.136 --> 00:13:47.426 A:middle
take a road trip around the

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:47.996 A:middle
solar system.

00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.826 A:middle
So, in the same session, my

00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:57.196 A:middle
friend Avi created a project

00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:59.046 A:middle
showing three celestial bodies,

00:13:59.686 --> 00:14:01.456 A:middle
the moon, the Earth, and the

00:13:59.686 --> 00:14:01.456 A:middle
the moon, the Earth, and the

00:14:01.456 --> 00:14:01.786 A:middle
sun.

00:14:02.616 --> 00:14:04.826 A:middle
I've expanded upon that to add

00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.696 A:middle
some more features to show you

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:08.656 A:middle
different behaviors in action.

00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:09.966 A:middle
So let's take a look.

00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:21.176 A:middle
So the most obvious starting

00:14:21.256 --> 00:14:22.936 A:middle
point of our journey is of

00:14:22.936 --> 00:14:23.876 A:middle
course the Earth.

00:14:23.876 --> 00:14:26.856 A:middle
But unfortunately we cannot get

00:14:26.856 --> 00:14:28.316 A:middle
to space inside a car.

00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:29.886 A:middle
We need something with a more

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:30.806 A:middle
powerful engine.

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:32.396 A:middle
I think I have an idea.

00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:35.276 A:middle
Notice that I can see what

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:37.456 A:middle
triggers I can interact with by

00:14:37.456 --> 00:14:38.666 A:middle
looking at the above text.

00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:41.196 A:middle
For example, here I can see move

00:14:41.196 --> 00:14:43.676 A:middle
closer to activate.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:45.136 A:middle
So there must be a proximity

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:45.476 A:middle
trigger.

00:14:46.146 --> 00:14:48.426 A:middle
Let's go ahead and take a closer

00:14:49.016 --> 00:14:49.106 A:middle
look.

00:14:50.936 --> 00:14:51.966 A:middle
Oh, hey, it's a rocket.

00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:53.956 A:middle
Perfect for going to space.

00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:57.296 A:middle
Notice that I, there's a tap

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.966 A:middle
trigger here, so I'm going to go

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
ahead and launch the rocket.

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
ahead and launch the rocket.

00:15:01.396 --> 00:15:04.066 A:middle
And we have lift off.

00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:08.226 A:middle
So now let's set a course for

00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:08.726 A:middle
the moon.

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:11.846 A:middle
And let's try to stick to that

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:12.506 A:middle
landing.

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:16.116 A:middle
Nailed it.

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:18.556 A:middle
Oh, look, there's a sign here.

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:20.606 A:middle
Well, good thing we took the

00:15:20.606 --> 00:15:21.776 A:middle
rocket, not the car.

00:15:26.796 --> 00:15:29.086 A:middle
So the thing about space is that

00:15:29.086 --> 00:15:31.816 A:middle
it is hard to view the sizes of

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:33.716 A:middle
celestial bodies because the

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.936 A:middle
sizes are so hard it's hard to

00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:36.836 A:middle
grasp.

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.416 A:middle
However, we can easily

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:40.546 A:middle
illustrate this with the help

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:40.986 A:middle
AR.

00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:44.306 A:middle
So, I'm going to tap here and

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:45.716 A:middle
fly up and out of here.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:49.666 A:middle
And this time, let's go up

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.606 A:middle
higher so that we can take an

00:15:51.606 --> 00:15:54.156 A:middle
overview look of the moon, the

00:15:54.156 --> 00:15:55.506 A:middle
Earth, and the sun.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:16:02.086 A:middle
And I'll tap on the sun to get a

00:15:56.006 --> 00:16:02.086 A:middle
And I'll tap on the sun to get a

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.406 A:middle
better sense.

00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:07.636 A:middle
Whoa. And as you can see, the

00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:09.306 A:middle
sun is absolutely enormous

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:10.606 A:middle
compared to the size of the

00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:10.836 A:middle
Earth.

00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:13.446 A:middle
Too bad the distances are not to

00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:15.076 A:middle
scale, otherwise it might

00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:16.346 A:middle
actually be quite warm in this

00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:16.596 A:middle
room.

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:23.496 A:middle
So that's a quick look at how

00:16:23.496 --> 00:16:25.346 A:middle
easy it is to view authored

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:29.206 A:middle
content inside Reality, to view

00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:30.906 A:middle
rich content authored using

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:32.786 A:middle
Reality Composer and viewed

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:33.756 A:middle
inside AR Quick Look.

00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:37.356 A:middle
And we absolutely cannot wait to

00:16:37.356 --> 00:16:39.206 A:middle
see what kinds of content that

00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:45.036 A:middle
you can create.

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:46.776 A:middle
So, now, let's talk about the

00:16:46.776 --> 00:16:48.706 A:middle
visual improvements of AR Quick

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:49.106 A:middle
Look.

00:16:50.936 --> 00:16:52.026 A:middle
One of the main goals of AR

00:16:52.026 --> 00:16:53.586 A:middle
Quick Look is to create a

00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:56.056 A:middle
believable AR experience, and to

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:58.736 A:middle
achieve that, it is important to

00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.636 A:middle
understand and take into account

00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.636 A:middle
understand and take into account

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.316 A:middle
the surrounding environment of

00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:02.856 A:middle
the user.

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:06.266 A:middle
This year, we added a variety of

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:08.215 A:middle
new rendering effects to make

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.116 A:middle
the content look as if it is

00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:11.306 A:middle
truly part of the world.

00:17:12.576 --> 00:17:14.736 A:middle
let's go into some more details,

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:16.705 A:middle
starting off with real-time

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:17.286 A:middle
shadows.

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:20.566 A:middle
Last year, AR Quick Look

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:22.195 A:middle
rendered shadows to make virtual

00:17:22.195 --> 00:17:24.536 A:middle
content look as if was part of

00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:24.925 A:middle
the world.

00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:27.656 A:middle
This year, we made shadows

00:17:27.656 --> 00:17:29.566 A:middle
dynamic and rendered in real

00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:29.896 A:middle
time.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.276 A:middle
So now shadows can follow your

00:17:32.276 --> 00:17:34.436 A:middle
content as if it was part of the

00:17:34.436 --> 00:17:36.496 A:middle
world, and this helps bring your

00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:37.966 A:middle
animated content to life.

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:42.016 A:middle
By default, projective shadows

00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:43.996 A:middle
are used as it provides a good

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.706 A:middle
approximation for how shadows

00:17:45.706 --> 00:17:47.116 A:middle
look like in the real world.

00:17:47.716 --> 00:17:51.576 A:middle
And on higher-end devices, like

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:53.726 A:middle
iPhone 10S, AR Quick Look will

00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:55.396 A:middle
use a ray-traced technique,

00:17:56.046 --> 00:17:57.506 A:middle
which produces physically

00:17:57.506 --> 00:17:59.926 A:middle
correct shadows and looks even

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
better.

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
better.

00:18:05.356 --> 00:18:06.966 A:middle
One key difference between

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.366 A:middle
ray-traced shadows and

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:10.256 A:middle
projective is that ray-traced

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.946 A:middle
technique produces softer

00:18:11.946 --> 00:18:14.076 A:middle
shadows and is especially great

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:16.136 A:middle
for objects with fine contact

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:17.096 A:middle
points.

00:18:18.166 --> 00:18:19.766 A:middle
Now, we've made great strides in

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.996 A:middle
terms of optimizations to enable

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:23.476 A:middle
AR Quick Look to perform

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:25.956 A:middle
real-time ray-tracing of dynamic

00:18:26.026 --> 00:18:28.776 A:middle
scenes, all on a mobile device.

00:18:30.146 --> 00:18:31.196 A:middle
If you're interested in learning

00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:33.196 A:middle
more about ray-traced shadows, I

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.636 A:middle
recommend checking out the

00:18:34.636 --> 00:18:36.596 A:middle
Ray-tracing with Metal session

00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:38.236 A:middle
later today at 11.

00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:41.726 A:middle
And since dynamic shadows are

00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:44.346 A:middle
rendered in real time on all

00:18:44.346 --> 00:18:46.306 A:middle
ARKit supported devices, you do

00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:47.946 A:middle
not need to bake in shadows as

00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:48.826 A:middle
part of your model.

00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:54.516 A:middle
Another new visual effect is

00:18:54.516 --> 00:18:55.296 A:middle
cameral noise.

00:18:55.976 --> 00:18:57.856 A:middle
In low light situations, you

00:18:57.856 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
might notice noise in your video

00:18:57.856 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
might notice noise in your video

00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:01.746 A:middle
because there just isn't enough

00:19:01.746 --> 00:19:03.886 A:middle
light captured by the camera

00:19:03.886 --> 00:19:04.276 A:middle
sensor.

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:07.116 A:middle
Since virtual objects are

00:19:07.116 --> 00:19:08.586 A:middle
rendered on top of the camera

00:19:08.586 --> 00:19:10.276 A:middle
feed, they will remain free of

00:19:10.276 --> 00:19:13.176 A:middle
artifacts, making your content

00:19:13.316 --> 00:19:14.326 A:middle
look out of place.

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:17.086 A:middle
Well, now, Reality Kit supports

00:19:17.226 --> 00:19:19.006 A:middle
camera grain, so the noise will

00:19:19.006 --> 00:19:20.786 A:middle
be added to the virtual content

00:19:21.206 --> 00:19:22.506 A:middle
based on the amount of noise in

00:19:22.506 --> 00:19:24.396 A:middle
the camera feed to create an

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.856 A:middle
effect that the robot is

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:27.866 A:middle
actually part of the scene.

00:19:30.396 --> 00:19:32.216 A:middle
This is done by taking the noise

00:19:32.216 --> 00:19:34.536 A:middle
texture provided by ARKit and

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:36.236 A:middle
applying that to the virtual

00:19:37.006 --> 00:19:37.246 A:middle
content.

00:19:39.576 --> 00:19:41.526 A:middle
Camera grain is automatically

00:19:41.526 --> 00:19:43.486 A:middle
enabled on all ARKit supported

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.146 A:middle
devices.

00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.096 A:middle
Depending on your model and the

00:19:49.096 --> 00:19:50.896 A:middle
environment, some colors may

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:52.346 A:middle
look too bright or blown out,

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:53.986 A:middle
such as the shiny marble.

00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:57.846 A:middle
AR Quick Look uses HDR with tone

00:19:57.846 --> 00:19:59.296 A:middle
mapping to provide a greater

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.776 A:middle
range of brightness and

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.776 A:middle
range of brightness and

00:20:00.776 --> 00:20:01.536 A:middle
contrast.

00:20:02.016 --> 00:20:05.626 A:middle
As you can see, without it, the

00:20:05.626 --> 00:20:07.446 A:middle
marble looks too bright and out

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:08.016 A:middle
of place.

00:20:08.736 --> 00:20:11.876 A:middle
But with HDR, it blends in with

00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:12.526 A:middle
the environment.

00:20:13.256 --> 00:20:15.866 A:middle
Under the hood, Reality Kit

00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:17.746 A:middle
allocates 16 bits per color

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:19.986 A:middle
channel, and this allows for a

00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:21.936 A:middle
greater range of color values to

00:20:21.936 --> 00:20:23.516 A:middle
be represented and passed

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:24.336 A:middle
through the shaders.

00:20:24.846 --> 00:20:27.836 A:middle
This then gets mapped using a

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:30.326 A:middle
custom tone mapping curve and

00:20:30.496 --> 00:20:31.986 A:middle
rendered to the final texture.

00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:35.696 A:middle
HDR with tone mapping is

00:20:35.696 --> 00:20:38.286 A:middle
available on all A10X devices

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:39.616 A:middle
and later.

00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:42.986 A:middle
Now, if you're like me who has

00:20:42.986 --> 00:20:44.406 A:middle
tried to grab a virtual object

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:46.156 A:middle
or had people walk in front of

00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:47.836 A:middle
them, then you probably noticed

00:20:47.836 --> 00:20:49.266 A:middle
that virtual objects are always

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:51.186 A:middle
rendered in front of people when

00:20:51.186 --> 00:20:53.436 A:middle
it should be behind, breaking

00:20:53.436 --> 00:20:53.936 A:middle
the illusion.

00:20:54.536 --> 00:20:58.366 A:middle
Now, with people occlusion, you

00:20:58.366 --> 00:20:59.456 A:middle
can create the illusion that

00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
someone is actually walking

00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
someone is actually walking

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:02.356 A:middle
through a collection of virtual

00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:04.876 A:middle
tin toys as if it was right

00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:06.046 A:middle
there in your world.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.966 A:middle
This uses the person

00:21:11.966 --> 00:21:13.656 A:middle
segmentation data provided by

00:21:13.656 --> 00:21:15.406 A:middle
ARKit to know what part of the

00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:17.956 A:middle
camera feed should remain drawn

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.266 A:middle
on top of the virtual content.

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:23.726 A:middle
People occlusion takes advantage

00:21:23.756 --> 00:21:25.346 A:middle
of the Apple neural engine and

00:21:25.346 --> 00:21:27.626 A:middle
will be available on all A12

00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:28.856 A:middle
devices and later.

00:21:29.546 --> 00:21:32.216 A:middle
Now, this is a really hard

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:33.696 A:middle
problem to solve, but if you're

00:21:33.696 --> 00:21:35.046 A:middle
curious to learn more, I

00:21:35.046 --> 00:21:36.076 A:middle
recommended checking out the

00:21:36.076 --> 00:21:37.816 A:middle
Introducing ARKit 3 session.

00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:43.406 A:middle
Digital cameras can only focus

00:21:43.406 --> 00:21:45.056 A:middle
on a certain distance at any

00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:45.726 A:middle
given time.

00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:48.276 A:middle
Objects closer or further from

00:21:48.276 --> 00:21:50.346 A:middle
this distance will look out of

00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:50.936 A:middle
focus.

00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:55.186 A:middle
Without this effect all virtual

00:21:55.186 --> 00:21:56.906 A:middle
objects will look in focus,

00:21:57.526 --> 00:21:59.026 A:middle
which stands out from the camera

00:21:59.086 --> 00:21:59.306 A:middle
feed.

00:22:00.626 --> 00:22:02.036 A:middle
Reality Kit takes the object's

00:22:02.096 --> 00:22:04.986 A:middle
distance into account tor ender

00:22:04.986 --> 00:22:06.936 A:middle
it as if it was captured from

00:22:06.936 --> 00:22:07.386 A:middle
your camera.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:09.316 A:middle
And this allows the virtual

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:11.396 A:middle
object to blend in with the rest

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.236 A:middle
of the camera feed to make it

00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:15.666 A:middle
seem as if it was really there.

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:19.206 A:middle
This is available on all A12X

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:21.596 A:middle
devices.

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:23.466 A:middle
Motion blur is the phenomenon

00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:25.146 A:middle
caused by real-world objects

00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:26.616 A:middle
moving faster than what the

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:28.836 A:middle
camera can capture, creating a

00:22:28.836 --> 00:22:30.006 A:middle
steak-like effects.

00:22:30.536 --> 00:22:33.606 A:middle
As you can see in the freeze

00:22:33.606 --> 00:22:35.246 A:middle
frame here, the robot on the

00:22:35.246 --> 00:22:37.366 A:middle
left does not fit with the scene

00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:38.946 A:middle
when motion blur is turned off.

00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:43.396 A:middle
Reality Kit applies motion blur

00:22:43.466 --> 00:22:44.916 A:middle
to the virtual content by

00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:46.656 A:middle
interpolating between textures

00:22:46.836 --> 00:22:49.486 A:middle
of two consecutive frames, which

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:51.906 A:middle
depends on the device motion and

00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:53.746 A:middle
the length of exposure to better

00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:54.996 A:middle
match the camera feed.

00:22:55.586 --> 00:22:58.816 A:middle
You'll be able to experience

00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
this effect in AR Quick Look on

00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
this effect in AR Quick Look on

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:03.226 A:middle
A12X devices.

00:23:05.576 --> 00:23:07.936 A:middle
We strive to bring more realism

00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:09.296 A:middle
to the virtual content with

00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:10.856 A:middle
these new rendering effects, but

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.186 A:middle
we also have to keep in mind

00:23:12.436 --> 00:23:15.056 A:middle
that these are expensive

00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:16.936 A:middle
operations that must be done in

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:17.466 A:middle
real-time.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.026 A:middle
We optimize and finetune the

00:23:20.026 --> 00:23:21.326 A:middle
rendering effects to create the

00:23:21.326 --> 00:23:23.856 A:middle
best experience at both

00:23:24.186 --> 00:23:26.576 A:middle
realistic and performant on all

00:23:26.636 --> 00:23:28.046 A:middle
iOS 13 devices.

00:23:28.606 --> 00:23:31.336 A:middle
That's why AR Quick Look would

00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:32.776 A:middle
automatically apply the best

00:23:32.876 --> 00:23:34.526 A:middle
rendering effect for your device

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:35.976 A:middle
so that you can focus on

00:23:35.976 --> 00:23:38.186 A:middle
creating rich content and

00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:38.936 A:middle
experiences.

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:45.526 A:middle
Now, in addition to making

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:46.766 A:middle
content feel like it is part of

00:23:46.766 --> 00:23:47.916 A:middle
the world, we've also made

00:23:47.916 --> 00:23:49.526 A:middle
enhancements to the entire view

00:23:49.526 --> 00:23:50.106 A:middle
experience.

00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:52.436 A:middle
First off, AR Quick Look now

00:23:52.436 --> 00:23:54.636 A:middle
launches straight into AR so

00:23:54.636 --> 00:23:56.126 A:middle
that you can immediately see and

00:23:56.126 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
interact with virtual content in

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:58.396 A:middle
your world.

00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:00.876 A:middle
For example, you can quickly put

00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:00.876 A:middle
For example, you can quickly put

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.816 A:middle
virtual objects on detective

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:05.616 A:middle
planes or try on sunglasses and

00:24:06.586 --> 00:24:08.476 A:middle
take selfies.

00:24:08.596 --> 00:24:10.026 A:middle
We've also made improvement to

00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:11.756 A:middle
scene understanding for better

00:24:11.806 --> 00:24:13.566 A:middle
and faster plane detection to

00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:15.346 A:middle
push the object directly into

00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:17.706 A:middle
the world as quickly as

00:24:18.816 --> 00:24:19.046 A:middle
possible.

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.226 A:middle
We used machine learning to

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:22.296 A:middle
better detect walls as well as

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:23.976 A:middle
to extend the breadth of already

00:24:23.976 --> 00:24:24.846 A:middle
detected planes.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:29.076 A:middle
And just like last year, AR

00:24:29.076 --> 00:24:30.976 A:middle
Quick Look securely runs in a

00:24:30.976 --> 00:24:32.826 A:middle
sandbox process, separate from

00:24:32.826 --> 00:24:33.326 A:middle
the host.

00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:35.776 A:middle
By launching straight into AR,

00:24:36.106 --> 00:24:38.416 A:middle
websites and apps do not have

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:40.316 A:middle
access to the camera feed or any

00:24:40.316 --> 00:24:41.146 A:middle
user activity.

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:45.626 A:middle
And here's a quick video showing

00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:48.526 A:middle
how fast this can be.

00:24:48.776 --> 00:24:49.886 A:middle
Going to tap on the thumbnail

00:24:50.206 --> 00:24:52.026 A:middle
and place a Newton's cradle directly

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:55.526 A:middle
on the table.

00:24:56.136 --> 00:24:57.256 A:middle
We've also added support for

00:24:57.256 --> 00:24:59.016 A:middle
viewing multiple models through

00:24:59.016 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
a nested USDZ file.

00:24:59.016 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
a nested USDZ file.

00:25:01.026 --> 00:25:03.826 A:middle
This is a special USDZ which

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:06.056 A:middle
contains metadata and a library

00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.226 A:middle
of USDZs.

00:25:08.336 --> 00:25:09.666 A:middle
This can be useful to create

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.376 A:middle
collections of related objects,

00:25:11.486 --> 00:25:13.526 A:middle
such as a furniture set, a

00:25:13.526 --> 00:25:15.756 A:middle
shopping cart, or in this case,

00:25:15.946 --> 00:25:16.676 A:middle
sports equipment.

00:25:17.336 --> 00:25:21.036 A:middle
In AR Quick Look, all containing

00:25:21.036 --> 00:25:23.476 A:middle
USDZ files are loaded and lined

00:25:23.476 --> 00:25:24.806 A:middle
up in ascending height order,

00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:27.056 A:middle
which offers a clear method of

00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:29.066 A:middle
displaying a variety of

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:29.986 A:middle
different models.

00:25:31.356 --> 00:25:32.176 A:middle
And these can then be

00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:33.956 A:middle
manipulated independently once

00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:35.736 A:middle
placed into the world and

00:25:35.736 --> 00:25:37.766 A:middle
arranged to your liking.

00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:42.446 A:middle
There's a saying that a picture

00:25:42.486 --> 00:25:44.526 A:middle
is worth a thousand words, and a

00:25:44.526 --> 00:25:46.296 A:middle
video is perhaps millions.

00:25:46.856 --> 00:25:48.576 A:middle
But what about animated AR

00:25:48.576 --> 00:25:49.086 A:middle
content?

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.346 A:middle
Animations bring a whole new

00:25:52.346 --> 00:25:53.956 A:middle
level to the experience, and now

00:25:53.956 --> 00:25:55.676 A:middle
users can control the playback

00:25:55.956 --> 00:25:57.506 A:middle
of animations such as

00:25:57.566 --> 00:26:01.126 A:middle
play/pause, rewind, skip, and

00:25:57.566 --> 00:26:01.126 A:middle
play/pause, rewind, skip, and

00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
fine scrubbing.

00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:05.586 A:middle
And the great thing about

00:26:05.586 --> 00:26:07.486 A:middle
viewing AR animated content is

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:09.126 A:middle
that users can rewatch it from

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.626 A:middle
different angles, allowing

00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:12.296 A:middle
themselves to be the director.

00:26:16.156 --> 00:26:18.206 A:middle
For USDZ models, the animation

00:26:18.206 --> 00:26:19.826 A:middle
scrubber will be shown if the

00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.506 A:middle
animation duration is at least

00:26:21.686 --> 00:26:22.376 A:middle
10 seconds.

00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:26.646 A:middle
And for content less than that,

00:26:27.116 --> 00:26:28.496 A:middle
the animation scrubber will be

00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:30.736 A:middle
hidden, and the entire animation

00:26:30.796 --> 00:26:33.046 A:middle
sequence will continue to loop.

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:37.516 A:middle
For reality files, the animation

00:26:37.516 --> 00:26:38.626 A:middle
scrubber will be shown if

00:26:38.626 --> 00:26:40.386 A:middle
there's a single on start

00:26:40.386 --> 00:26:42.506 A:middle
trigger with at least one

00:26:42.506 --> 00:26:43.446 A:middle
animation action.

00:26:44.276 --> 00:26:46.256 A:middle
And optionally, you can attach

00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:47.976 A:middle
sound action so that it plays

00:26:47.976 --> 00:26:49.176 A:middle
along with your animated

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:49.626 A:middle
content.

00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:53.516 A:middle
And here's how that would look

00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:55.136 A:middle
like in Reality Composer.

00:26:56.576 --> 00:26:58.446 A:middle
Tapping on the behaviors panel

00:26:58.886 --> 00:26:59.696 A:middle
shows this.

00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:01.886 A:middle
So, here I have a single same

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:04.896 A:middle
start trigger followed by one

00:27:04.896 --> 00:27:07.036 A:middle
USDZ animation as well as a

00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:11.026 A:middle
sound to go along with it.

00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:13.136 A:middle
Now, we have a really cool

00:27:13.136 --> 00:27:13.556 A:middle
gesture.

00:27:13.776 --> 00:27:15.006 A:middle
It's called levitation.

00:27:16.246 --> 00:27:18.206 A:middle
Simply swipe up with two fingers

00:27:18.716 --> 00:27:19.926 A:middle
to levitate objects up.

00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:22.586 A:middle
For example, you can levitate

00:27:22.806 --> 00:27:24.686 A:middle
these balloons to decorate your

00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:25.006 A:middle
party.

00:27:25.676 --> 00:27:29.216 A:middle
AR Quick Look provides a portal

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:30.846 A:middle
for users to enjoy immersive

00:27:30.846 --> 00:27:32.546 A:middle
experiences, but wouldn't it be

00:27:32.546 --> 00:27:34.286 A:middle
cool to share what you see on

00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:36.126 A:middle
the screen with other people?

00:27:37.336 --> 00:27:38.996 A:middle
Now, you can record exactly what

00:27:38.996 --> 00:27:41.206 A:middle
you see such as organizing that

00:27:41.206 --> 00:27:43.916 A:middle
birthday party simply by tapping

00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:45.596 A:middle
and holding on the shutter

00:27:45.596 --> 00:27:47.716 A:middle
button and release when you're

00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:47.936 A:middle
done.

00:27:48.526 --> 00:27:50.216 A:middle
Videos are automatically saved

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:51.426 A:middle
to the photos library.

00:27:53.816 --> 00:27:55.456 A:middle
We made improvements to macOS

00:27:55.456 --> 00:27:56.996 A:middle
Quick Look Viewer as well.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.066 A:middle
In addition to being able to

00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.386 A:middle
preview USDZ files, it also

00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.386 A:middle
preview USDZ files, it also

00:28:01.386 --> 00:28:04.236 A:middle
supports reality files, and

00:28:04.236 --> 00:28:05.526 A:middle
thumbnails will be generated

00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:07.916 A:middle
right away so that you can find

00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:09.006 A:middle
the files faster.

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.116 A:middle
It is built on top of Reality

00:28:12.116 --> 00:28:13.786 A:middle
Kit, which uses the same

00:28:13.786 --> 00:28:15.806 A:middle
physics-based rendering as iOS,

00:28:16.516 --> 00:28:18.376 A:middle
and this provides a consistent

00:28:18.376 --> 00:28:20.736 A:middle
previewing experience on all

00:28:20.786 --> 00:28:21.566 A:middle
your devices.

00:28:24.216 --> 00:28:25.296 A:middle
We think this will make it

00:28:25.296 --> 00:28:27.156 A:middle
easier to preview author content

00:28:27.526 --> 00:28:29.206 A:middle
and take advantage of all the

00:28:29.206 --> 00:28:31.606 A:middle
power and tools available on a

00:28:32.426 --> 00:28:32.526 A:middle
Mac.

00:28:33.256 --> 00:28:34.566 A:middle
That's a quick run through of

00:28:34.566 --> 00:28:36.156 A:middle
all the visual improvements and

00:28:36.156 --> 00:28:37.416 A:middle
previewing experience in AR

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:38.166 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:28:38.236 --> 00:28:39.306 A:middle
And now I'll hand it back to

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:41.026 A:middle
David, who will talk more about

00:28:41.026 --> 00:28:43.676 A:middle
the integrations on the web.

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:48.066 --> 00:28:48.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:28:49.286 --> 00:28:50.116 A:middle
Thanks Jerry.

00:28:50.606 --> 00:28:52.076 A:middle
So we all just saw the new

00:28:52.156 --> 00:28:53.896 A:middle
features and improvements added

00:28:53.896 --> 00:28:54.986 A:middle
to AR Quick Look this year.

00:28:55.806 --> 00:28:57.106 A:middle
So, now, let's talk about how to

00:28:57.106 --> 00:28:58.976 A:middle
view those experiences on the

00:28:59.626 --> 00:28:59.726 A:middle
web.

00:29:00.276 --> 00:29:02.896 A:middle
With iOS 12, you can view USDZ

00:29:02.896 --> 00:29:04.516 A:middle
files on the web through AR

00:29:04.516 --> 00:29:04.996 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:06.916 A:middle
For your website to support

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:09.826 A:middle
this, simply add HTML markup and

00:29:09.826 --> 00:29:11.066 A:middle
specify the MIME type.

00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:13.756 A:middle
This automatically adds the AR

00:29:13.756 --> 00:29:15.056 A:middle
badge in the top right-hand

00:29:15.056 --> 00:29:16.696 A:middle
corner of your thumbnail image

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:17.756 A:middle
to let users know that they can

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.366 A:middle
view this content in AR.

00:29:20.156 --> 00:29:21.816 A:middle
Tapping on the thumbnail will

00:29:21.816 --> 00:29:22.766 A:middle
launch AR Quick Look.

00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:25.786 A:middle
This easily transforms your

00:29:25.786 --> 00:29:28.006 A:middle
website into a seamless AR

00:29:28.006 --> 00:29:29.776 A:middle
viewing experience as there's no

00:29:29.776 --> 00:29:31.146 A:middle
need to download any

00:29:31.146 --> 00:29:31.696 A:middle
application.

00:29:32.306 --> 00:29:35.446 A:middle
Adding support consists of two

00:29:35.446 --> 00:29:35.746 A:middle
things.

00:29:36.486 --> 00:29:38.606 A:middle
The HTML markup and the MIME

00:29:38.606 --> 00:29:38.836 A:middle
type.

00:29:39.606 --> 00:29:40.936 A:middle
The first step is to add the

00:29:40.936 --> 00:29:42.566 A:middle
HTML markup, which involves

00:29:42.706 --> 00:29:45.846 A:middle
adding the rel equals AR

00:29:45.846 --> 00:29:47.666 A:middle
attribute to your A link

00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:50.206 A:middle
element, allowing Safari to

00:29:50.206 --> 00:29:51.546 A:middle
recognize and launch AR Quick

00:29:51.546 --> 00:29:53.076 A:middle
Look from the same webpage.

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.236 A:middle
The link must contain a single

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:58.666 A:middle
child that is either an image or

00:29:58.666 --> 00:30:00.906 A:middle
a picture element, and the image

00:29:58.666 --> 00:30:00.906 A:middle
a picture element, and the image

00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:02.116 A:middle
that you provide inside the

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:03.636 A:middle
anchor will be used as a

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:06.416 A:middle
thumbnail image for your virtual

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:07.186 A:middle
content.

00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:10.676 A:middle
The second step that's needed in

00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:12.696 A:middle
order for Safari to recognize AR

00:30:12.696 --> 00:30:14.136 A:middle
content is to add the

00:30:14.206 --> 00:30:15.676 A:middle
appropriate MIME type when

00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:16.806 A:middle
serving that content.

00:30:17.596 --> 00:30:19.396 A:middle
To add support for previewing

00:30:19.396 --> 00:30:21.636 A:middle
USDZ files on the web, simply

00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:23.256 A:middle
add this MIME type for USDZ

00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:23.646 A:middle
files.

00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:26.306 A:middle
This provides the metadata for

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:28.646 A:middle
Safari to open both regular and

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:30.756 A:middle
nested USDZs directly in AR

00:30:30.756 --> 00:30:31.236 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:33.746 A:middle
And likewise, you would need to

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:35.256 A:middle
configure your web server to

00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:36.666 A:middle
serve the appropriate headers

00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:37.736 A:middle
for reality files.

00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:39.996 A:middle
And adding this MIME type will

00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:41.586 A:middle
open reality files within AR

00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:43.206 A:middle
Quick Look from the web.

00:30:44.536 --> 00:30:46.306 A:middle
In addition to downloading

00:30:46.306 --> 00:30:47.696 A:middle
content from a server, you can

00:30:47.696 --> 00:30:49.286 A:middle
also open up AR Quick Look by

00:30:49.286 --> 00:30:50.496 A:middle
passing in local data.

00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:53.066 A:middle
One supported format is the data

00:30:53.066 --> 00:30:55.126 A:middle
URIs, which allows developers to

00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:56.936 A:middle
load content from a base 64

00:30:56.936 --> 00:30:58.246 A:middle
encoded data string.

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:00.436 A:middle
So, for example, here's how to

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:00.436 A:middle
So, for example, here's how to

00:31:00.436 --> 00:31:05.506 A:middle
load a USDZ file through a data

00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:05.643 A:middle
URL.

00:31:05.926 --> 00:31:07.676 A:middle
Notice that you specify the same

00:31:07.676 --> 00:31:09.156 A:middle
MIME type at the beginning of

00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:11.706 A:middle
the data string, and to load a

00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:13.876 A:middle
reality file, simply switch the

00:31:13.876 --> 00:31:15.006 A:middle
MIME type.

00:31:18.156 --> 00:31:20.156 A:middle
Not only that, you can also load

00:31:20.156 --> 00:31:22.276 A:middle
data through blob URLs, which

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:23.716 A:middle
are more efficient compared to

00:31:23.716 --> 00:31:25.586 A:middle
data URIs since they do not need

00:31:25.586 --> 00:31:27.426 A:middle
to be base 64 encoded.

00:31:28.616 --> 00:31:30.816 A:middle
The blob URL is never manually

00:31:30.816 --> 00:31:32.566 A:middle
created and always generated

00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:34.046 A:middle
through an API like drag and

00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:36.576 A:middle
drop, file upload, or URL

00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:36.996 A:middle
download.

00:31:37.556 --> 00:31:40.846 A:middle
We've heard from developers the

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:42.606 A:middle
desire to customize a viewing

00:31:42.606 --> 00:31:44.076 A:middle
experience within AR Quick Look.

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:46.566 A:middle
So, starting with iOS 13, we're

00:31:46.646 --> 00:31:48.376 A:middle
introducing two customization

00:31:48.376 --> 00:31:50.106 A:middle
options that you can modify to

00:31:50.226 --> 00:31:51.896 A:middle
tailor the viewer to best fit

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:53.326 A:middle
your content and your

00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:53.866 A:middle
application.

00:31:54.686 --> 00:31:56.266 A:middle
Developers can choose to disable

00:31:56.266 --> 00:31:58.336 A:middle
scaling of virtual content for

00:31:58.336 --> 00:31:59.396 A:middle
each model that's being

00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:01.436 A:middle
previewed and also provide a

00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:01.436 A:middle
previewed and also provide a

00:32:01.436 --> 00:32:03.456 A:middle
canonical webpage instead of the

00:32:03.456 --> 00:32:05.276 A:middle
actual 3D model that'll be

00:32:05.276 --> 00:32:06.516 A:middle
shared through the iOS

00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:07.076 A:middle
sharesheet.

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:09.316 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:11.006 A:middle
disable content scaling option.

00:32:12.636 --> 00:32:14.006 A:middle
Typically, allowing scaling for

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.606 A:middle
virtual content is a great way

00:32:15.656 --> 00:32:17.546 A:middle
to preview objects at different

00:32:17.546 --> 00:32:18.826 A:middle
sizes and picking the right

00:32:18.826 --> 00:32:20.406 A:middle
dimensions to best see your

00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.676 A:middle
content in the environment that

00:32:21.676 --> 00:32:22.116 A:middle
you're in.

00:32:23.336 --> 00:32:24.786 A:middle
However, that's not always the

00:32:24.786 --> 00:32:26.546 A:middle
case, especially when previewing

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:29.296 A:middle
objects with known fixed sizes

00:32:29.696 --> 00:32:30.346 A:middle
like furniture.

00:32:31.886 --> 00:32:32.766 A:middle
For these type of products, AR

00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:34.166 A:middle
Quick Look makes it really easy

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:36.276 A:middle
for web and app developers to

00:32:36.276 --> 00:32:37.936 A:middle
disable content scaling so that

00:32:37.936 --> 00:32:39.546 A:middle
users will always view the

00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:41.246 A:middle
object at the correct and

00:32:41.246 --> 00:32:42.266 A:middle
intended size.

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:44.886 A:middle
So, let's see what this behavior

00:32:44.886 --> 00:32:46.346 A:middle
looks like with this nice dining

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:47.256 A:middle
room set that I'm sending to

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:47.866 A:middle
customers.

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:49.706 A:middle
The set comes in a specific

00:32:49.706 --> 00:32:50.726 A:middle
dimension that cannot be

00:32:50.726 --> 00:32:51.296 A:middle
configured.

00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:53.646 A:middle
You can see as I try to scale

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:54.996 A:middle
the dining table set larger or

00:32:54.996 --> 00:32:56.816 A:middle
smaller with our two finger

00:32:56.816 --> 00:32:58.656 A:middle
pinch gesture that you're met

00:32:58.656 --> 00:33:00.306 A:middle
with resistance and that the

00:32:58.656 --> 00:33:00.306 A:middle
with resistance and that the

00:33:00.306 --> 00:33:01.746 A:middle
object scales back down to its

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:03.336 A:middle
true real-world size.

00:33:04.486 --> 00:33:06.216 A:middle
This immediate feedback is super

00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:07.756 A:middle
important to let our customers

00:33:07.756 --> 00:33:09.336 A:middle
know that the object cannot be

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:11.156 A:middle
scaled and that they're intended

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:13.026 A:middle
to be viewed at this specific

00:33:13.026 --> 00:33:13.366 A:middle
size.

00:33:15.296 --> 00:33:17.486 A:middle
For the web, the API is exposed

00:33:17.486 --> 00:33:18.956 A:middle
directly through the URL via the

00:33:18.956 --> 00:33:20.036 A:middle
fragment identifier.

00:33:20.626 --> 00:33:22.116 A:middle
The fragment identifier syntax

00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:24.796 A:middle
starts with a hash mark followed

00:33:24.796 --> 00:33:26.446 A:middle
by the parameter option to

00:33:26.496 --> 00:33:27.696 A:middle
customize the AR Quick Look

00:33:27.696 --> 00:33:29.746 A:middle
experience, and in this case,

00:33:29.976 --> 00:33:31.856 A:middle
this allows content scaling

00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:32.336 A:middle
behavior.

00:33:33.486 --> 00:33:34.786 A:middle
The values to these parameters

00:33:35.156 --> 00:33:36.606 A:middle
are Boolean values where 0

00:33:36.606 --> 00:33:38.326 A:middle
represents false, and 1

00:33:38.326 --> 00:33:39.086 A:middle
represents true.

00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:41.696 A:middle
When launched AR Quick Look

00:33:41.696 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
processes the fragment

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:45.116 A:middle
identifier data and ignores any

00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:48.066 A:middle
invalid data along with

00:33:48.066 --> 00:33:49.186 A:middle
parameter names that are not

00:33:49.186 --> 00:33:50.406 A:middle
defined by the syntax.

00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:52.896 A:middle
If the original URL does not

00:33:52.896 --> 00:33:54.246 A:middle
contain a fragment string, AR

00:33:54.436 --> 00:33:56.206 A:middle
Quick Look will launch and load

00:33:56.206 --> 00:33:58.236 A:middle
the 3D content for previewing

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.536 A:middle
using the default behavior,

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.116 A:middle
which is to allow content

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.116 A:middle
which is to allow content

00:34:01.116 --> 00:34:01.566 A:middle
scaling.

00:34:03.096 --> 00:34:04.316 A:middle
Going through the URL fragment

00:34:04.316 --> 00:34:05.726 A:middle
identifier allows for future

00:34:05.726 --> 00:34:07.026 A:middle
customization options and

00:34:07.026 --> 00:34:08.896 A:middle
enhancements to the 3D content

00:34:08.896 --> 00:34:10.335 A:middle
previewing experience, as more

00:34:10.335 --> 00:34:11.496 A:middle
features get added to AR Quick

00:34:11.496 --> 00:34:11.616 A:middle
Look.

00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:15.966 A:middle
Another customization option

00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:17.505 A:middle
that we added is the ability to

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:18.846 A:middle
enable sharing the canonical

00:34:18.846 --> 00:34:19.646 A:middle
webpage URL.

00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:21.795 A:middle
When challenged and sharing just

00:34:21.795 --> 00:34:23.985 A:middle
3D model file is the lack of

00:34:24.016 --> 00:34:25.335 A:middle
context for where that model

00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:25.786 A:middle
came from.

00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:27.936 A:middle
I know my colleague Jerry is in

00:34:27.936 --> 00:34:28.926 A:middle
the market for a new dining

00:34:28.926 --> 00:34:30.856 A:middle
table, so if I send him an

00:34:30.856 --> 00:34:32.356 A:middle
iMessage to previous 3D model,

00:34:32.356 --> 00:34:33.676 A:middle
he has no idea where to buy it

00:34:34.096 --> 00:34:35.596 A:middle
let alone how much the set even

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:36.085 A:middle
costs.

00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:38.666 A:middle
For retail products, it's better

00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:40.186 A:middle
to share the link to the product

00:34:40.186 --> 00:34:41.045 A:middle
description page.

00:34:42.126 --> 00:34:43.456 A:middle
And by sharing a product link

00:34:43.556 --> 00:34:44.636 A:middle
instead of a 3D model file

00:34:44.636 --> 00:34:45.886 A:middle
itself, people can go to the

00:34:45.886 --> 00:34:47.806 A:middle
source and get not only more

00:34:47.806 --> 00:34:49.076 A:middle
information but the most

00:34:49.076 --> 00:34:50.646 A:middle
up-to-date information about the

00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:51.036 A:middle
product.

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.786 A:middle
And on iOS 13, AR Quick Look

00:34:53.786 --> 00:34:55.226 A:middle
will automatically share the URL

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.496 A:middle
of the originating website for

00:34:57.496 --> 00:34:59.246 A:middle
the 3D content and applications

00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:00.866 A:middle
can choose to continue sharing

00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:00.866 A:middle
can choose to continue sharing

00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:03.356 A:middle
that 3D model or to provide a

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:03.906 A:middle
link instead.

00:35:04.456 --> 00:35:05.386 A:middle
This is great to get more

00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:07.686 A:middle
information and learn more about

00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:09.936 A:middle
the content.

00:35:10.006 --> 00:35:10.596 A:middle
Now let's take a look at this

00:35:10.596 --> 00:35:11.436 A:middle
behavior in Safari.

00:35:12.196 --> 00:35:13.176 A:middle
Here, I'm viewing the guitar

00:35:13.266 --> 00:35:14.356 A:middle
from the AR Quick Look gallery.

00:35:14.356 --> 00:35:16.036 A:middle
As I tap on the share button,

00:35:16.176 --> 00:35:17.216 A:middle
you'll see that were now sharing

00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:18.386 A:middle
a reference back to the gallery

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:18.796 A:middle
website.

00:35:18.796 --> 00:35:21.586 A:middle
And in Apple News, we're

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.346 A:middle
automatically sharing the source

00:35:23.466 --> 00:35:24.946 A:middle
news article as well through the

00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:25.776 A:middle
iOS share sheet.

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:27.716 A:middle
This is great for shareability

00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:30.226 A:middle
as we pass 3D models around and

00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
for viewing in AR with even more

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.586 A:middle
contextual information.

00:35:33.786 --> 00:35:36.576 A:middle
You can also integrate AR Quick

00:35:36.576 --> 00:35:38.236 A:middle
Look into your iOS applications.

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.156 A:middle
It's really easy to integrate

00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:41.296 A:middle
and get started with viewing 3D

00:35:41.296 --> 00:35:42.586 A:middle
content and placing them into

00:35:42.586 --> 00:35:42.986 A:middle
the world.

00:35:44.266 --> 00:35:45.386 A:middle
Since AR Quick Look is built

00:35:45.386 --> 00:35:46.886 A:middle
into the OS adopting it gives

00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:49.286 A:middle
users a familiar, yet consistent

00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:50.356 A:middle
previewing experience.

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.566 A:middle
You have full control over the

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:53.806 A:middle
view controller frame and

00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:55.456 A:middle
presentation of AR Quick Look so

00:35:55.456 --> 00:35:56.396 A:middle
you can put it inline with the

00:35:56.396 --> 00:35:58.286 A:middle
rest of your app content or

00:35:58.286 --> 00:35:59.316 A:middle
present it full screen for the

00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.286 A:middle
best experience.

00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.286 A:middle
best experience.

00:36:01.276 --> 00:36:02.966 A:middle
AR Quick Look is built on top of

00:36:02.966 --> 00:36:04.396 A:middle
the Quick Look framework to

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:05.946 A:middle
preview and present AR content.

00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:07.766 A:middle
So the same customization

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:09.136 A:middle
options that are on the web are

00:36:09.136 --> 00:36:10.506 A:middle
also available for your apps

00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:11.266 A:middle
through our new API.

00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:14.546 A:middle
To do so, use the new AR Quick

00:36:14.546 --> 00:36:15.916 A:middle
Look preview item class defined

00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:17.326 A:middle
in the ARKit framework, which

00:36:17.326 --> 00:36:19.016 A:middle
conforms to the QL previewItem.

00:36:19.816 --> 00:36:20.946 A:middle
Simply conform to the

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:22.546 A:middle
QLPreviewController data source

00:36:22.546 --> 00:36:24.086 A:middle
protocol and return an instance

00:36:24.126 --> 00:36:25.896 A:middle
of an AR QL preview item.

00:36:27.046 --> 00:36:28.656 A:middle
To create one, pass in the file

00:36:28.656 --> 00:36:30.346 A:middle
URL of the 3D content that you

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:30.886 A:middle
wish to view.

00:36:32.376 --> 00:36:33.526 A:middle
And now, you can optionally

00:36:33.526 --> 00:36:34.626 A:middle
customize and provide the

00:36:34.656 --> 00:36:37.206 A:middle
canonical website URL use of

00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:39.046 A:middle
sharing within AR Quick Look and

00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:40.906 A:middle
whether to allow content scaling

00:36:40.906 --> 00:36:42.516 A:middle
of the virtual content, all

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:43.686 A:middle
similar to the web fragment

00:36:43.686 --> 00:36:44.396 A:middle
identifier method.

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:46.666 A:middle
This provides a consistent

00:36:46.936 --> 00:36:48.976 A:middle
developer and API story for both

00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:50.316 A:middle
web and iOS applications.

00:36:51.926 --> 00:36:53.396 A:middle
We have a new documentation and

00:36:53.476 --> 00:36:54.536 A:middle
resources where you can learn

00:36:54.536 --> 00:36:55.786 A:middle
more about the APIs that we've

00:36:55.786 --> 00:36:57.216 A:middle
covered along with details on

00:36:57.266 --> 00:36:58.416 A:middle
how to enable AR Quick Look in

00:36:58.466 --> 00:36:59.656 A:middle
your application and website.

00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:01.216 A:middle
So, check out this link, which

00:37:01.216 --> 00:37:02.316 A:middle
can be found on the developer

00:37:02.316 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
portal.

00:37:04.686 --> 00:37:06.406 A:middle
Augmented reality is a really

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:08.076 A:middle
powerful way to visualize

00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:09.266 A:middle
furniture and see how they fit

00:37:09.266 --> 00:37:10.056 A:middle
within your space.

00:37:10.276 --> 00:37:11.386 A:middle
So, I'll be showing you how to

00:37:11.386 --> 00:37:13.016 A:middle
decorate a kid's bedroom with

00:37:13.076 --> 00:37:14.146 A:middle
these six items.

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:19.226 A:middle
So, as you can see here, there

00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:21.236 A:middle
are two picture frames, a

00:37:21.236 --> 00:37:26.286 A:middle
basket, a nightstand, a bed, and

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:27.046 A:middle
a bookshelf.

00:37:27.416 --> 00:37:29.456 A:middle
And all of these object are

00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:31.656 A:middle
packaged together in a single

00:37:31.656 --> 00:37:34.836 A:middle
nested USDZ file.

00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.776 A:middle
So let's get started moving this

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:36.986 A:middle
bed.

00:37:37.806 --> 00:37:38.786 A:middle
You can see how I'm able to

00:37:38.786 --> 00:37:40.046 A:middle
freely move the bed that's

00:37:40.046 --> 00:37:41.666 A:middle
contained in this multiple model

00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:44.016 A:middle
file independently to my desired

00:37:44.016 --> 00:37:44.846 A:middle
location in the room.

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:47.546 A:middle
Let's go ahead and grab the

00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:48.946 A:middle
picture frames, that's on the

00:37:48.946 --> 00:37:50.796 A:middle
left, and move them closer to

00:37:50.796 --> 00:37:51.126 A:middle
us.

00:37:51.656 --> 00:37:52.776 A:middle
With two fingers, you can see

00:37:52.776 --> 00:37:54.076 A:middle
that we support multimodel

00:37:54.076 --> 00:37:55.736 A:middle
translation, leveraging the

00:37:55.786 --> 00:37:56.676 A:middle
power of multitouch.

00:37:57.246 --> 00:37:58.646 A:middle
This is great for quickly moving

00:37:58.646 --> 00:38:00.026 A:middle
objects around in the world.

00:37:58.646 --> 00:38:00.026 A:middle
objects around in the world.

00:38:00.656 --> 00:38:04.296 A:middle
I will now touch and drag my

00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:05.696 A:middle
favorite picture from the floor

00:38:05.906 --> 00:38:07.406 A:middle
and anchor it so that it sits

00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:08.316 A:middle
right above the bed.

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.006 A:middle
This is all possible now because

00:38:11.006 --> 00:38:12.596 A:middle
by default AR Quick Look detects

00:38:12.596 --> 00:38:14.016 A:middle
and supports placing objects on

00:38:14.016 --> 00:38:15.386 A:middle
both horizontal and vertical

00:38:15.386 --> 00:38:16.036 A:middle
surfaces.

00:38:16.486 --> 00:38:20.116 A:middle
Now let's figure the best place

00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:21.446 A:middle
to put my bookshelf.

00:38:21.856 --> 00:38:23.226 A:middle
I'll grab the bookshelf and

00:38:23.346 --> 00:38:25.196 A:middle
first place it onto the wall.

00:38:26.696 --> 00:38:29.196 A:middle
Now, I really need to compare

00:38:29.196 --> 00:38:30.736 A:middle
where the best spot for it is,

00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.526 A:middle
so let's place it back onto the

00:38:32.526 --> 00:38:32.916 A:middle
floor.

00:38:34.156 --> 00:38:35.626 A:middle
So now I'm thinking, I want as

00:38:35.626 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
much floor space for the kid as

00:38:36.936 --> 00:38:38.616 A:middle
they grow up and as they collect

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:39.146 A:middle
more items.

00:38:39.796 --> 00:38:40.876 A:middle
So let's keep it onto the wall

00:38:40.876 --> 00:38:41.776 A:middle
since it really matches the

00:38:41.776 --> 00:38:43.996 A:middle
setting of the picture frame and

00:38:43.996 --> 00:38:44.816 A:middle
the rest of my layout.

00:38:45.856 --> 00:38:47.386 A:middle
I'm able to quickly make these

00:38:47.586 --> 00:38:49.236 A:middle
decisions and see what objects

00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:50.636 A:middle
look like in my room with the

00:38:50.636 --> 00:38:52.356 A:middle
new support in AR Quick Look for

00:38:52.426 --> 00:38:54.076 A:middle
easily moving between horizontal

00:38:54.076 --> 00:38:55.046 A:middle
and vertical surfaces.

00:38:55.596 --> 00:38:57.796 A:middle
So, let's tidy up the rest of

00:38:57.796 --> 00:39:00.016 A:middle
this scene by moving the

00:38:57.796 --> 00:39:00.016 A:middle
this scene by moving the

00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:01.216 A:middle
remaining objects, which is the

00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:04.686 A:middle
basket, and over to the right

00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:05.726 A:middle
near the bookshelf.

00:39:10.076 --> 00:39:12.026 A:middle
I'll also do the same thing with

00:39:12.026 --> 00:39:13.186 A:middle
the nightstand and a picture

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:14.486 A:middle
frame but move it to the left

00:39:14.486 --> 00:39:14.976 A:middle
side of the bed.

00:39:29.046 --> 00:39:30.306 A:middle
And as Jerry mentioned, there's

00:39:30.306 --> 00:39:32.086 A:middle
a new levity gesture, and this

00:39:32.086 --> 00:39:33.676 A:middle
is extremely powerful for not

00:39:33.676 --> 00:39:35.066 A:middle
only seeing the underside of the

00:39:35.066 --> 00:39:36.356 A:middle
objects but also lifting the

00:39:36.356 --> 00:39:36.976 A:middle
object up.

00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:39.076 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and lift the

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.356 A:middle
picture frame to be slightly

00:39:40.356 --> 00:39:41.866 A:middle
above the nightstand and move it

00:39:41.866 --> 00:39:43.436 A:middle
so that it's positioned just on

00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:44.316 A:middle
top of the stand.

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.026 A:middle
Lastly, I'll rotate the frame so

00:39:47.026 --> 00:39:48.626 A:middle
it's angled towards the bed for

00:39:48.626 --> 00:39:50.466 A:middle
a nice finishing touch.

00:39:51.716 --> 00:39:53.996 A:middle
And now, let's take a look at

00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:55.086 A:middle
the final shot of the kid's

00:39:55.086 --> 00:39:56.456 A:middle
bedroom scene that we've just

00:39:57.076 --> 00:39:57.186 A:middle
made.

00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.216 A:middle
This looks absolutely incredible

00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:03.626 A:middle
as a prime example of a retail

00:40:03.626 --> 00:40:04.776 A:middle
experience that can be enabled

00:40:04.776 --> 00:40:05.496 A:middle
in AR Quick Look.

00:40:06.276 --> 00:40:07.976 A:middle
But you might be thinking, I

00:40:07.976 --> 00:40:09.246 A:middle
really wish there was an easy

00:40:09.246 --> 00:40:10.556 A:middle
way for me to buy this after

00:40:10.556 --> 00:40:11.976 A:middle
seeing this in my own space.

00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:14.066 A:middle
And you weren't alone in

00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:14.656 A:middle
thinking that.

00:40:15.086 --> 00:40:16.336 A:middle
We've learned that over the last

00:40:16.336 --> 00:40:17.456 A:middle
year from retailers that when

00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:19.106 A:middle
customers see their products in

00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:20.266 A:middle
their own space, they have

00:40:20.266 --> 00:40:21.826 A:middle
significantly more confidence in

00:40:21.826 --> 00:40:23.446 A:middle
their purchase, which is great

00:40:23.446 --> 00:40:25.426 A:middle
for customers and great for

00:40:25.426 --> 00:40:25.976 A:middle
businesses.

00:40:26.776 --> 00:40:28.186 A:middle
So, this year, we are adding a

00:40:28.186 --> 00:40:29.576 A:middle
support for a customizable call

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:31.026 A:middle
to action in AR Quick Look

00:40:31.206 --> 00:40:33.146 A:middle
including direct support for

00:40:33.586 --> 00:40:34.816 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:40:36.136 --> 00:40:37.806 A:middle
With Apple Pay support directly

00:40:37.806 --> 00:40:38.766 A:middle
in AR Quick Look, users can

00:40:38.766 --> 00:40:40.706 A:middle
purchase the actual objects that

00:40:40.706 --> 00:40:41.786 A:middle
they just previewed in the world

00:40:41.786 --> 00:40:43.606 A:middle
with just a single tap.

00:40:44.196 --> 00:40:45.776 A:middle
So, what does this actually look

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:45.876 A:middle
like?

00:40:46.256 --> 00:40:47.476 A:middle
There's a brand-new view located

00:40:47.476 --> 00:40:48.486 A:middle
at the bottom of AR Quick Look

00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:50.496 A:middle
with two fields, a title and a

00:40:50.496 --> 00:40:52.516 A:middle
subtitle that you can customize

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.526 A:middle
separately to match your

00:40:53.526 --> 00:40:53.836 A:middle
workflow.

00:40:54.846 --> 00:40:56.036 A:middle
The title can describe what it

00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:57.006 A:middle
is that the user is looking at

00:40:57.006 --> 00:40:58.346 A:middle
to buy and you can use a

00:40:58.346 --> 00:40:59.406 A:middle
subtitle field to include the

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:01.196 A:middle
price and product description.

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:01.196 A:middle
price and product description.

00:41:02.646 --> 00:41:03.956 A:middle
Underneath the text field is a

00:41:03.956 --> 00:41:05.206 A:middle
reference to the canonical web

00:41:05.206 --> 00:41:06.726 A:middle
domain name to show you where

00:41:06.726 --> 00:41:07.756 A:middle
the product can be found.

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:09.606 A:middle
And on the right, you can

00:41:09.606 --> 00:41:10.896 A:middle
provide your own call to action,

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:13.796 A:middle
such as active cart and checkout

00:41:14.796 --> 00:41:16.356 A:middle
along with using any Apple Pay

00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:17.486 A:middle
button with varying different

00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:19.386 A:middle
styles to best fit and match

00:41:19.556 --> 00:41:20.466 A:middle
your shopping workflow.

00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:22.846 A:middle
So this great feature will be

00:41:22.846 --> 00:41:24.346 A:middle
available later this fall, and

00:41:24.986 --> 00:41:26.206 A:middle
we are excited to share that

00:41:26.206 --> 00:41:27.536 A:middle
Warby Parker will be offering

00:41:27.536 --> 00:41:28.896 A:middle
virtual try-on in their website

00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:30.276 A:middle
once Apple Pay support and AR

00:41:30.276 --> 00:41:31.836 A:middle
Quick Look is available later

00:41:31.836 --> 00:41:32.186 A:middle
this year.

00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:34.586 A:middle
Warby Parker was the first to

00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:35.876 A:middle
offer virtual try-on in their

00:41:35.876 --> 00:41:37.356 A:middle
app, and we're excited with the

00:41:37.356 --> 00:41:38.626 A:middle
new updates to AR Quick Look and

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.456 A:middle
iOS 13 they will be extending

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:41.926 A:middle
their virtual try-on to their

00:41:41.926 --> 00:41:42.326 A:middle
website.

00:41:42.956 --> 00:41:44.066 A:middle
We can't wait to see how other

00:41:44.066 --> 00:41:45.416 A:middle
merchants integrate this into

00:41:45.416 --> 00:41:46.586 A:middle
their retail workflow.

00:41:48.236 --> 00:41:49.766 A:middle
Now, a majority of these models

00:41:49.766 --> 00:41:51.856 A:middle
that we've seen from the keynote

00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:53.636 A:middle
and this session can be found on

00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:54.576 A:middle
our updated AR Quick Look

00:41:54.576 --> 00:41:55.216 A:middle
gallery page.

00:41:55.836 --> 00:41:57.046 A:middle
Here, you'll find a range of

00:41:57.046 --> 00:41:58.676 A:middle
static and animated models that

00:41:58.676 --> 00:42:00.036 A:middle
you can play with, and we'll be

00:41:58.676 --> 00:42:00.036 A:middle
you can play with, and we'll be

00:42:00.036 --> 00:42:01.656 A:middle
adding reality files soon.

00:42:02.316 --> 00:42:03.606 A:middle
So, if you have iOS 13 on the

00:42:03.606 --> 00:42:05.206 A:middle
device, visit this gallery page,

00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:06.686 A:middle
tap on a 3D model, and give them

00:42:06.686 --> 00:42:06.996 A:middle
a try.

00:42:06.996 --> 00:42:09.686 A:middle
And also, if you didn't get the

00:42:09.686 --> 00:42:10.796 A:middle
opportunity to check out the Mac

00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.616 A:middle
Pro or the Pro Display XDR in

00:42:12.646 --> 00:42:13.596 A:middle
person from earlier in the

00:42:13.596 --> 00:42:15.456 A:middle
conference, don't fret.

00:42:16.086 --> 00:42:17.226 A:middle
You can view these products in

00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:18.616 A:middle
AR Quick Look and see what they

00:42:18.616 --> 00:42:19.756 A:middle
look like in your workspace.

00:42:20.276 --> 00:42:21.306 A:middle
The models can be found on their

00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:22.946 A:middle
respective product pages.

00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:25.986 A:middle
A Python script to create these

00:42:25.986 --> 00:42:27.646 A:middle
nested USDZ files will be

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:29.166 A:middle
available soon on the AR Quick

00:42:29.166 --> 00:42:30.856 A:middle
Look gallery page under the USDZ

00:42:30.856 --> 00:42:31.706 A:middle
tools section.

00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:35.276 A:middle
So, in summary, we've added a

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:36.796 A:middle
ton of capabilities to AR Quick

00:42:36.796 --> 00:42:37.826 A:middle
Look this year to provide and

00:42:37.826 --> 00:42:39.206 A:middle
even more compelling and

00:42:39.206 --> 00:42:41.846 A:middle
believable experience, to view

00:42:41.846 --> 00:42:42.966 A:middle
AR content in the real world.

00:42:43.696 --> 00:42:44.606 A:middle
This started with supporting

00:42:44.606 --> 00:42:45.866 A:middle
reality files, authored in

00:42:45.866 --> 00:42:47.336 A:middle
Reality Composer, where we're

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:48.646 A:middle
able to reflect the richness

00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:50.356 A:middle
that reality kit provides, like

00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:52.196 A:middle
more anchor types, such as Face

00:42:52.556 --> 00:42:54.486 A:middle
and Real World images and

00:42:54.486 --> 00:42:56.426 A:middle
interactive content behaviors

00:42:56.646 --> 00:42:57.966 A:middle
through the use of triggers and

00:42:57.966 --> 00:42:58.496 A:middle
actions.

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.586 A:middle
We've made the content belong

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.586 A:middle
We've made the content belong

00:43:00.586 --> 00:43:01.646 A:middle
with the world with new

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:02.646 A:middle
rendering effects like depth of

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:05.216 A:middle
field, motion blur, and people

00:43:05.216 --> 00:43:05.536 A:middle
occlusion.

00:43:06.686 --> 00:43:07.786 A:middle
We also enhance the viewing

00:43:07.786 --> 00:43:09.166 A:middle
experience with new levity

00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.796 A:middle
gestures and built-in animation

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:12.026 A:middle
scrubber to allow you to have

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:13.876 A:middle
better control over the content

00:43:13.876 --> 00:43:15.076 A:middle
and its animation sequence.

00:43:16.436 --> 00:43:17.936 A:middle
We've introduced a new API on

00:43:17.936 --> 00:43:19.426 A:middle
both the web and iOS to allow

00:43:19.426 --> 00:43:21.156 A:middle
developers to better customize

00:43:21.156 --> 00:43:22.206 A:middle
their previewing experience for

00:43:22.206 --> 00:43:22.886 A:middle
the workflows.

00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:26.276 A:middle
And lastly, there's better

00:43:26.276 --> 00:43:27.486 A:middle
retail integration with support

00:43:27.486 --> 00:43:28.696 A:middle
for Apple Pay and call to

00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:30.106 A:middle
actions that are coming real

00:43:30.766 --> 00:43:30.856 A:middle
soon.

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:33.596 A:middle
To learn more and get more

00:43:33.596 --> 00:43:34.486 A:middle
information about the topics

00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:35.326 A:middle
covered in this session, check

00:43:35.326 --> 00:43:36.326 A:middle
out the session's website.

00:43:36.816 --> 00:43:38.086 A:middle
We also have a lab later today

00:43:38.086 --> 00:43:38.886 A:middle
at 11 AM.

00:43:39.356 --> 00:43:40.806 A:middle
So please stop buy and bring any

00:43:40.806 --> 00:43:41.786 A:middle
questions you have about AR

00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.276 A:middle
Quick Look, and we'd be happy to

00:43:43.276 --> 00:43:43.966 A:middle
help answer them.

00:43:44.976 --> 00:43:46.136 A:middle
Thank you, and enjoy the rest of

00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:46.696 A:middle
your conference.

00:43:47.516 --> 00:43:50.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
