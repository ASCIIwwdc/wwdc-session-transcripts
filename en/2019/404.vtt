[ Music ]

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:15.436 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Getting Started

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.356 A:middle
with Xcode.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:20.986 A:middle
My name is Prachi and I'm an

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:21.876 A:middle
Xcode engineer.

00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:24.296 A:middle
Along with my colleagues Holly

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:26.386 A:middle
and Honza, I'll be walking you

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:27.766 A:middle
through how you can build a

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.546 A:middle
simple iOS app using Xcode.

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:32.886 A:middle
Xcode is an integrated

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.606 A:middle
development environment used for

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:36.776 A:middle
developing software in Swift,

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:38.906 A:middle
Objective-C, and other

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:39.526 A:middle
languages.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:43.266 A:middle
In the session, we'll be

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.686 A:middle
covering how you can create a

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:47.486 A:middle
new project using Xcode, write

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.076 A:middle
and navigate your source code in

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.426 A:middle
Xcode's Source Editor, run and

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:55.816 A:middle
debug any issues that may exist

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.036 A:middle
within your code base, extend

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:00.506 A:middle
the functionality of your app

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:00.506 A:middle
the functionality of your app

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:02.926 A:middle
using packages and frameworks,

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:04.745 A:middle
and finally how you can test

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:06.736 A:middle
distribute your app to the App

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:06.976 A:middle
Store.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.946 A:middle
Let's get started with creating

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:16.706 A:middle
a new project in Xcode.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.746 A:middle
In front of you, you see the

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.786 A:middle
Xcode window which I'll be

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.496 A:middle
discussing in four different

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:23.086 A:middle
sections.

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:27.496 A:middle
In the center section is the

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.696 A:middle
Source Editor where you can view

00:01:29.696 --> 00:01:31.206 A:middle
and edit all of your files.

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.166 A:middle
In particular, we have the

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.946 A:middle
Source Editor open and you can

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:37.156 A:middle
use it to navigate and edit all

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:38.096 A:middle
of your source code.

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:40.026 A:middle
There are other editors

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:41.176 A:middle
available to use such the

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:42.196 A:middle
Project Editor.

00:01:42.196 --> 00:01:44.336 A:middle
And here, you can customize your

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.766 A:middle
project settings when you need

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:46.126 A:middle
to.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.446 A:middle
Within the project editor, you

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:50.116 A:middle
will find targets for your app.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.986 A:middle
A target contains instructions

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.956 A:middle
to build one product.

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.766 A:middle
Examples of products include

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
libraries, frameworks, test

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
libraries, frameworks, test

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:02.156 A:middle
bundles and the app itself.

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.446 A:middle
To the very left of the Xcode

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:06.966 A:middle
window is the Navigator where

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.886 A:middle
you have quick and easy access

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:10.175 A:middle
to all of the content within

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:10.886 A:middle
your project.

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.336 A:middle
You can use the Navigator

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:15.906 A:middle
selector bar to select a

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:16.696 A:middle
navigator.

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:18.376 A:middle
You have many available to you.

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:21.586 A:middle
And because we have the project

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:23.746 A:middle
navigator selected, you can use

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:26.316 A:middle
it to add, delete group, or

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.006 A:middle
otherwise manage all of the

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.576 A:middle
files that exist within your

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:30.146 A:middle
project.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.056 A:middle
On the very right is the

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:35.986 A:middle
Inspector and it provides with

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:37.736 A:middle
you contextual data about the

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:39.006 A:middle
contents of your editor.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:40.386 A:middle
Because we have the Source

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.896 A:middle
Editor open, you can view

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.556 A:middle
information about the file

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:45.756 A:middle
that's being displayed such as

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:48.266 A:middle
the file name and the file path.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.686 A:middle
The top section is a toolbar.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:55.006 A:middle
And here, you'll find the Run

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:56.986 A:middle
button which will build and run

00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:58.186 A:middle
your product.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.896 A:middle
The Stop button will terminate

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.896 A:middle
The Stop button will terminate

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:03.716 A:middle
the current action in progress.

00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:07.806 A:middle
The next two drop-down menus are

00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:09.066 A:middle
the Scheme and the Run

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:09.846 A:middle
Destination.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:13.146 A:middle
A scheme a sharable file that

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.016 A:middle
contains rules for our how app

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:17.466 A:middle
will be built, run and tested.

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:19.706 A:middle
The Run Destination is where you

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:20.356 A:middle
will run your app.

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:22.646 A:middle
You can choose to run your app

00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:24.526 A:middle
in a simulator for a device such

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.396 A:middle
as the iPhone XR which is what

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.186 A:middle
we're doing up here.

00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:30.926 A:middle
You can run it on your Mac or a

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
connected device such as an

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:35.446 A:middle
iPhone or an iPad.

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.686 A:middle
The last three buttons are the

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.076 A:middle
Show and Hide buttons which will

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:41.706 A:middle
show and hide different sections

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:42.886 A:middle
of the Xcode window.

00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:44.406 A:middle
And these can come handy.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.786 A:middle
For example, if you're

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:47.846 A:middle
developing code and you need

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:49.116 A:middle
more space in the editor, you

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:50.716 A:middle
can use the right mouse button

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:53.556 A:middle
to close the Inspector and

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:54.976 A:middle
provide yourself with that extra

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.736 A:middle
space in the editor.

00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:00.936 A:middle
Now, I'd like to bring your

00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:00.936 A:middle
Now, I'd like to bring your

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:03.016 A:middle
attention to the Xcode Help Menu

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:04.136 A:middle
where you have access to

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.226 A:middle
resources such as Developer

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.636 A:middle
Documentation, Release Notes and

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:09.636 A:middle
Xcode Help.

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:12.856 A:middle
Xcode Help is an amazing

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:14.326 A:middle
resource for learning about

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:14.806 A:middle
Xcode.

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:16.386 A:middle
And we highly recommend that you

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:17.886 A:middle
browse through it on your own.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:21.016 A:middle
So now that we walked through

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:22.626 A:middle
the layout of the Xcode window,

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:24.556 A:middle
let's go ahead and create an

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:26.216 A:middle
actual project from scratch.

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:29.216 A:middle
So in front of you is the

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:31.276 A:middle
Welcome to Xcode Window.

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:34.226 A:middle
And on the left, you have the

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.086 A:middle
option to create a new project

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.046 A:middle
which will store all of your

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:39.916 A:middle
files and resources for your

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:40.006 A:middle
app.

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:43.016 A:middle
You can also clone an existing

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.056 A:middle
project that may be hosted on

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.426 A:middle
the source control account such

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.036 A:middle
as GitHub.

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.006 A:middle
And finally, you can also open

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.456 A:middle
up a Xcode Playground which

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:53.786 A:middle
allows you to experiment with

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.586 A:middle
your Swift code and then see the

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.136 A:middle
result of that code in real

00:04:57.136 --> 00:04:57.626 A:middle
time.

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
On the right are all of the

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
On the right are all of the

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:01.476 A:middle
projects that we've been

00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:03.116 A:middle
recently modifying, and so we

00:05:03.116 --> 00:05:04.426 A:middle
have quick and easy access to

00:05:04.426 --> 00:05:04.696 A:middle
them.

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:07.176 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and create

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:08.566 A:middle
a new project in Xcode.

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:11.506 A:middle
This will open up the template

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:12.126 A:middle
selector.

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:14.356 A:middle
Templates are starting points

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.776 A:middle
for our app.

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.596 A:middle
And there are a variety of

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:19.096 A:middle
templates that are available for

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:19.776 A:middle
us to use.

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:22.326 A:middle
In order to pick the right

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:23.546 A:middle
template, we need to start out

00:05:23.546 --> 00:05:24.966 A:middle
by identifying the platform

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:25.926 A:middle
we're developing for.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.476 A:middle
And I know I'm writing an iOS

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:27.556 A:middle
app.

00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:29.806 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and click on

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:30.666 A:middle
the iOS tab.

00:05:31.116 --> 00:05:32.716 A:middle
Within this tab, you'll notice

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.146 A:middle
that there are two categories of

00:05:34.146 --> 00:05:36.696 A:middle
templates available such as the

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:38.856 A:middle
Application templates and the

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:40.176 A:middle
Framework and the Library

00:05:40.176 --> 00:05:40.706 A:middle
templates.

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:43.636 A:middle
For the purpose of this session

00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:44.906 A:middle
though, I'm going to go ahead

00:05:44.906 --> 00:05:46.856 A:middle
and select an Application

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:48.066 A:middle
template and I'm going to pick

00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:49.306 A:middle
the simplest one which is the

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:51.436 A:middle
Single View App and I'll click

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:51.876 A:middle
Next.

00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:53.876 A:middle
So my teammates and I have

00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:55.066 A:middle
decided we want to build a

00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:56.546 A:middle
meditation application.

00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:58.246 A:middle
And we've decided to call it

00:05:58.246 --> 00:05:58.666 A:middle
Mind.

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
So for the Product Name, I'm

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
So for the Product Name, I'm

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:01.826 A:middle
going to enter in Mind.

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:04.886 A:middle
For the Organization Name,

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.356 A:middle
typically, I would put in the

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:08.606 A:middle
name of my organization, but for

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:09.996 A:middle
the purposes of this session,

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.716 A:middle
I'm going to call ourselves

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:12.596 A:middle
Example Team.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:16.086 A:middle
The Organization Identifier is

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:17.936 A:middle
then the reversed DNS of the

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:19.116 A:middle
organization name.

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:20.706 A:middle
So in this case, it is

00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:22.216 A:middle
com.exampleteam.

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:25.016 A:middle
Finally, the Bundle Identifier

00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:28.296 A:middle
is autofilled and it is a unique

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:30.096 A:middle
ID for your app within Apple's

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:30.946 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.256 A:middle
It is a combination of the

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:34.546 A:middle
Product Name and the

00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:36.026 A:middle
Organization Identifier.

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:38.186 A:middle
For the Language, I will go

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:39.506 A:middle
ahead and leave at Swift because

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:40.916 A:middle
I want to write my app in Swift.

00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:44.376 A:middle
And I will ensure that I have UI

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:46.166 A:middle
Tests included so that it

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:47.426 A:middle
creates a target for them.

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:49.726 A:middle
Because as developers, we want

00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:51.726 A:middle
to be in the habit of constantly

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:52.696 A:middle
testing our code.

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:55.456 A:middle
We'll show you later how to add

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:59.936 A:middle
unit tests.

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:02.016 A:middle
So after you click Finish, it

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:03.576 A:middle
will open to Save sheet.

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.616 A:middle
Here, I can decide where I want

00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:06.226 A:middle
to save my app.

00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:09.026 A:middle
It defaults to the Desktop and

00:07:09.026 --> 00:07:09.716 A:middle
I'm happy with that.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:11.806 A:middle
So I'll leave that as is.

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.466 A:middle
But one thing that I do want to

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.646 A:middle
ensure is that Source Control is

00:07:15.646 --> 00:07:16.826 A:middle
available from the very

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:18.076 A:middle
beginning of this project so

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:20.246 A:middle
that I can manage, track and

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
backup any changes that I make

00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:25.396 A:middle
during the development process.

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:27.476 A:middle
So I will go ahead and check the

00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:29.646 A:middle
Create a Git Repository on my

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:31.826 A:middle
Mac checkbox and I'll click

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:32.316 A:middle
Create.

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:35.886 A:middle
So we have our template setup

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:36.256 A:middle
now.

00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:39.866 A:middle
We can add an app icon to our

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
app.

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:43.516 A:middle
App icons are the images that a

00:07:43.516 --> 00:07:45.456 A:middle
user will select whenever they

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:46.326 A:middle
want to launch our app.

00:07:47.496 --> 00:07:48.956 A:middle
App icons are assets.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.036 A:middle
Examples of assets include

00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:52.436 A:middle
images and colors.

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:56.436 A:middle
Assets are managed and organized

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:58.466 A:middle
by an asset catalog and we can

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
access that asset catalog

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
access that asset catalog

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.396 A:middle
through the Navigator by

00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:02.146 A:middle
clicking on it.

00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:04.306 A:middle
And because we want the catalog

00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:05.716 A:middle
for our app icon, let's go ahead

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.066 A:middle
and click on the app icon and

00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:07.866 A:middle
the editor.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:10.176 A:middle
And you'll notice from the

00:08:10.176 --> 00:08:13.066 A:middle
catalog that you can have assets

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:15.536 A:middle
for Notifications, Settings,

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.666 A:middle
Spotlight as well as the app

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:17.966 A:middle
itself.

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:20.716 A:middle
So I have an app icon sitting on

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:21.376 A:middle
my desktop.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.406 A:middle
It's ready to be used.

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:26.586 A:middle
And I have device that uses 2X

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.636 A:middle
resolution.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:30.996 A:middle
So app icon-- assets are

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:33.535 A:middle
available for 1X, 2X and 3X

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:34.946 A:middle
resolution depending upon the

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:35.826 A:middle
device you use.

00:08:36.145 --> 00:08:37.515 A:middle
So I'm going to ahead and grab

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.496 A:middle
this app icon and drag it into

00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:42.566 A:middle
the 2X catalog box for the

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:43.826 A:middle
iPhone app.

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:47.976 A:middle
Now, I want to test my app icon

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:49.156 A:middle
to make sure that it actually

00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:49.466 A:middle
works.

00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:51.976 A:middle
So to do that, I want to run it

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:53.826 A:middle
in a simulator for the iPhone

00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:54.216 A:middle
XR.

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:55.496 A:middle
So I'll change my Run

00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:57.056 A:middle
Destination to the iPhone XR,

00:08:58.466 --> 00:08:59.556 A:middle
and then I'll click the Run

00:08:59.556 --> 00:08:59.976 A:middle
button.

00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:06.956 A:middle
This will launch the simulator.

00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:09.426 A:middle
And you'll notice that the

00:09:09.426 --> 00:09:11.346 A:middle
simulator goes about launching

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:12.356 A:middle
my app immediately.

00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:13.396 A:middle
I know this because it's

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.956 A:middle
displaying Hello World and

00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:16.116 A:middle
that's what my template is set

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:16.786 A:middle
up to do.

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:19.066 A:middle
So I need to go to the Hardware

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:21.726 A:middle
Menu to actually see my app icon

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:22.626 A:middle
in the home screen.

00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:24.096 A:middle
So I'll go to the Hardware Menu

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:26.376 A:middle
and click on Home.

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:28.956 A:middle
This will bring me to the home

00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
screen and I see my app icon is

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:30.976 A:middle
there.

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:33.546 A:middle
If I click on app icon, my app

00:09:33.546 --> 00:09:35.026 A:middle
comes back into the foreground.

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:36.646 A:middle
So great, I know that my app

00:09:36.646 --> 00:09:37.366 A:middle
icon works.

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.946 A:middle
I can terminate execution of the

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:40.646 A:middle
simulator.

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.286 A:middle
And now, we're at a good point

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:44.716 A:middle
where we can commit and save our

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:46.356 A:middle
changes so that our colleagues

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.286 A:middle
Holly and Honza can continue

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:50.796 A:middle
developing on this app-- on this

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:51.416 A:middle
project.

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:54.316 A:middle
To do that, we first need to add

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:55.906 A:middle
a GitHub account.

00:09:57.016 --> 00:09:58.716 A:middle
We can do that through Xcode

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
Preferences which you can access

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
Preferences which you can access

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:02.086 A:middle
from the Xcode Menu and then

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:03.106 A:middle
going to Preferences.

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:05.766 A:middle
Xcode Preferences lets you

00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:07.876 A:middle
customize Xcode for your needs.

00:10:08.496 --> 00:10:09.986 A:middle
And in order to add an account,

00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:11.256 A:middle
we'll go ahead and ago to the

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:13.196 A:middle
Account Preference Pane and

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.636 A:middle
click on the Plus button.

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:16.566 A:middle
You'll see that there are a

00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:18.686 A:middle
variety of accounts that are

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:19.426 A:middle
available to us.

00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:20.586 A:middle
And since we're interested in

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
the GitHub account, we'll click

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.406 A:middle
on GitHub and click Continue.

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:27.316 A:middle
So now it's asking me for my

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.616 A:middle
account credentials so I am

00:10:28.616 --> 00:10:30.946 A:middle
going to go ahead and type in my

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.686 A:middle
account name and my password.

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.316 A:middle
So it's signed in to my account

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.026 A:middle
which is great, so I'll go ahead

00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:39.756 A:middle
and close Xcode Preferences.

00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:44.336 A:middle
And now, I need to make the

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:45.036 A:middle
actual commit.

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:46.406 A:middle
So to do that I'll go the Source

00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:48.166 A:middle
Control Menu and I'll click on

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:48.416 A:middle
Commit.

00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:53.066 A:middle
This will open up the commit

00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:53.606 A:middle
sheet.

00:10:53.606 --> 00:10:55.626 A:middle
And here you can verify all of

00:10:55.626 --> 00:10:57.356 A:middle
the changes you made and you can

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.956 A:middle
add a commit message to let your

00:10:58.956 --> 00:11:00.026 A:middle
colleagues know what you

00:10:58.956 --> 00:11:00.026 A:middle
colleagues know what you

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:00.476 A:middle
changed.

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.026 A:middle
So for the commit message, I'll

00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:04.096 A:middle
say that this commit will add an

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.336 A:middle
app icon.

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:08.596 A:middle
And I'll click commit which will

00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:09.676 A:middle
close the commit sheet.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:13.876 A:middle
So now to get to this point in

00:11:13.876 --> 00:11:15.676 A:middle
our development, we started out

00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:17.486 A:middle
by creating a project using

00:11:17.486 --> 00:11:18.096 A:middle
Xcode.

00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:21.416 A:middle
We then chose a template that

00:11:21.416 --> 00:11:22.496 A:middle
was appropriate for our

00:11:22.496 --> 00:11:23.136 A:middle
platform.

00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:26.766 A:middle
We added an app icon to our

00:11:26.766 --> 00:11:29.096 A:middle
asset catalogue and then we used

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:30.436 A:middle
Xcode source control

00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:32.326 A:middle
functionality to commit our

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:33.786 A:middle
changes so that our colleagues

00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:35.236 A:middle
could continue developing on our

00:11:35.316 --> 00:11:35.656 A:middle
project.

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.516 A:middle
To learn more about Source

00:11:38.516 --> 00:11:40.166 A:middle
Control we recommend that you

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.726 A:middle
check out the Source Control

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:43.776 A:middle
Workflows in Xcode talk from

00:11:43.776 --> 00:11:45.146 A:middle
2018.

00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:47.406 A:middle
Now we're at a point where we

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.706 A:middle
can start adding actual

00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:50.696 A:middle
meditation functionality to our

00:11:50.696 --> 00:11:50.846 A:middle
app.

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:52.816 A:middle
And to do that, I'm going to

00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:54.476 A:middle
invite up my colleague Holly.

00:11:54.736 --> 00:11:55.256 A:middle
Thank you.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:02.736 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:02.736 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:04.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Prachi.

00:12:04.806 --> 00:12:07.556 A:middle
My name is Holly and I'm an

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:09.106 A:middle
engineer on the Xcode Source

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:09.896 A:middle
Editor team.

00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:13.046 A:middle
And welcome to the Source

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:13.456 A:middle
Editor.

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.836 A:middle
This is where you will write all

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.036 A:middle
of the code for your app.

00:12:18.556 --> 00:12:19.896 A:middle
To the left of the Source Code

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
we have the line numbers, and to

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:23.876 A:middle
the right of the code we have

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.546 A:middle
the mini map which shows you a

00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:27.096 A:middle
miniature view of the file in

00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:28.666 A:middle
the editor for navigation.

00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:31.776 A:middle
Above the source code we have

00:12:31.806 --> 00:12:32.436 A:middle
the Jump Bar.

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.016 A:middle
The Jump bar also helps you

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:36.706 A:middle
navigate the file in the editor

00:12:36.706 --> 00:12:37.996 A:middle
using the function popup.

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:41.536 A:middle
The Jump Bar also lets you

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:43.006 A:middle
customize the layout of your

00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:45.036 A:middle
editor using the Editor Options

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:46.426 A:middle
and Editor Split menus.

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:50.066 A:middle
We are already making great

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.186 A:middle
progress on building our

00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:51.976 A:middle
meditation app.

00:12:52.686 --> 00:12:53.876 A:middle
Let's have a look at where we're

00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:54.106 A:middle
headed.

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:57.136 A:middle
We are building a meditation app

00:12:57.526 --> 00:12:59.126 A:middle
that allows users to select a

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
duration and meditate for that

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
duration and meditate for that

00:13:00.956 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
amount of time.

00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:03.996 A:middle
When the meditation is over, the

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:05.536 A:middle
app will write the user's

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:06.946 A:middle
mindful minutes back to their

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:07.506 A:middle
health data.

00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
We'll need to add quite a bit of

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.326 A:middle
Swift code to get our app

00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:11.776 A:middle
working.

00:13:12.286 --> 00:13:14.026 A:middle
But instead of trying to read

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.706 A:middle
the code that I write, I want

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:17.196 A:middle
you to focus on the tools that

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.676 A:middle
Xcode provides to aid the

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:19.396 A:middle
editing process.

00:13:19.396 --> 00:13:22.056 A:middle
And if you're new to Swift,

00:13:22.396 --> 00:13:22.946 A:middle
welcome.

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:24.656 A:middle
To get started with Swift, I

00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:25.836 A:middle
recommend going through the

00:13:25.836 --> 00:13:27.286 A:middle
Swift guided tour which is

00:13:27.286 --> 00:13:30.036 A:middle
available online or in an Xcode

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:31.556 A:middle
Playground so that you can

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
experiment with the Swift code

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:34.576 A:middle
as you walk through the tour.

00:13:36.146 --> 00:13:38.016 A:middle
This resource is available on

00:13:38.016 --> 00:13:39.296 A:middle
docs.swift.org.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:41.876 A:middle
And with that, let's head over

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:42.586 A:middle
to Xcode.

00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:50.646 A:middle
I added some code to the project

00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:51.986 A:middle
template that Prachi showed us

00:13:52.286 --> 00:13:53.336 A:middle
to implement timing of

00:13:53.336 --> 00:13:55.116 A:middle
meditation and drawing a

00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:56.426 A:middle
peaceful background for the app.

00:13:57.356 --> 00:13:58.906 A:middle
We still have to implement a UI

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:00.986 A:middle
for selecting a meditation

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:00.986 A:middle
for selecting a meditation

00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:02.966 A:middle
duration and for starting the

00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:03.736 A:middle
meditation.

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:06.006 A:middle
We also have to implement the

00:14:06.006 --> 00:14:07.126 A:middle
class that interacts with

00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:07.696 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:09.596 A:middle
To get our app up and running

00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:11.466 A:middle
really quickly, I implemented a

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:13.226 A:middle
mock HealthStore that does not

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:14.586 A:middle
interact with HealthKit and

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:15.546 A:middle
we'll implement the real

00:14:15.546 --> 00:14:16.436 A:middle
HealthStore later.

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.896 A:middle
So here, we're looking at the

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:20.356 A:middle
ContentView.swift from the

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:22.356 A:middle
project template and I added a

00:14:22.356 --> 00:14:24.136 A:middle
title and a background.

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:26.856 A:middle
While building the UI for your

00:14:26.856 --> 00:14:28.456 A:middle
app, Xcode can show you a

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:30.296 A:middle
preview of what your UI will

00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:32.496 A:middle
look like on an interactive

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:32.896 A:middle
Canvas.

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.156 A:middle
To show the Canvas, we can

00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:37.676 A:middle
select the Editor Menu and click

00:14:37.846 --> 00:14:38.986 A:middle
Editor and Canvas.

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:42.676 A:middle
The Canvas will build and run

00:14:42.676 --> 00:14:44.706 A:middle
your code as you edit so that it

00:14:44.706 --> 00:14:45.996 A:middle
can show you the results of your

00:14:45.996 --> 00:14:47.666 A:middle
code in real time.

00:14:48.256 --> 00:14:50.086 A:middle
So now in the preview, we can

00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:51.926 A:middle
see the welcome title and the

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:52.956 A:middle
peaceful background.

00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:55.926 A:middle
Next, I want to add a meditation

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:56.296 A:middle
view.

00:14:56.586 --> 00:15:00.656 A:middle
So I'll create a new file, and

00:14:56.586 --> 00:15:00.656 A:middle
So I'll create a new file, and

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
I'll use the SwiftUI View file

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:03.666 A:middle
template.

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:07.116 A:middle
And I'm going to call this

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.236 A:middle
MeditationView.

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:17.706 A:middle
Right now, the preview is

00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:19.946 A:middle
showing me a full device, but

00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:21.306 A:middle
the view that I'm working on is

00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:23.086 A:middle
only taking up a small portion

00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:23.936 A:middle
of the screen.

00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:25.966 A:middle
I can modify the preview

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.416 A:middle
provider which is what's

00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:28.956 A:middle
supplying the view to show on

00:15:28.956 --> 00:15:30.976 A:middle
the Canvas to only show the view

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:32.466 A:middle
that I'm working on using the

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.986 A:middle
previewLayout modifier.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:36.526 A:middle
When I start to type the

00:15:36.526 --> 00:15:38.496 A:middle
modifier, Xcode will bring up

00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:40.116 A:middle
the Code Completion Window.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.216 A:middle
This shows me a list of

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:44.176 A:middle
suggested symbols based on the

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.066 A:middle
text that I typed as well as the

00:15:46.066 --> 00:15:47.886 A:middle
surrounding context of the code.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.416 A:middle
The modifier that I want is the

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.496 A:middle
first one in the completion list

00:15:52.496 --> 00:15:54.016 A:middle
and I can press Enter to accept

00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:54.856 A:middle
the suggestion.

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.846 A:middle
Now Xcode inserted the symbol

00:15:57.846 --> 00:15:59.276 A:middle
into the editor along with the

00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:00.906 A:middle
placeholder for me to fill out

00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:00.906 A:middle
placeholder for me to fill out

00:16:00.906 --> 00:16:01.766 A:middle
the remaining code.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
And I'll fill that out now with

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:04.326 A:middle
a sizeThatFits.

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:07.656 A:middle
Next, I know that my

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:09.296 A:middle
MeditationView will need to

00:16:09.296 --> 00:16:09.976 A:middle
interact with the

00:16:09.976 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
MeditationController.

00:16:11.806 --> 00:16:13.526 A:middle
So I am going to add a property

00:16:13.526 --> 00:16:15.746 A:middle
wrapper that wraps a

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:18.486 A:middle
MeditationController, and I'll

00:16:18.486 --> 00:16:19.336 A:middle
resume the preview.

00:16:20.676 --> 00:16:22.236 A:middle
If you're unsure of what a

00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:24.186 A:middle
certain API does in the Source

00:16:24.186 --> 00:16:25.366 A:middle
Editor, you can view

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:28.026 A:middle
documentation for that API by

00:16:28.026 --> 00:16:29.786 A:middle
holding down Option and clicking

00:16:29.786 --> 00:16:30.906 A:middle
on the symbol that you want to

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:32.276 A:middle
view documentation for.

00:16:33.556 --> 00:16:34.626 A:middle
This will bring up the Quick

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.586 A:middle
Help popover which shows me the

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:38.716 A:middle
declaration of the symbol along

00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:39.926 A:middle
with its documentation.

00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:43.046 A:middle
Before we move on, I need to

00:16:43.116 --> 00:16:45.706 A:middle
supply a MeditationController

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.306 A:middle
using the environmentObject

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:47.886 A:middle
modifier.

00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:55.756 A:middle
Now, let's start building up

00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:56.436 A:middle
this view.

00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.936 A:middle
Right now, we have text that's

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.836 A:middle
showing us Hello World, and I

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.836 A:middle
showing us Hello World, and I

00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:02.626 A:middle
want to change this to show the

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:03.676 A:middle
remaining time for the

00:17:03.676 --> 00:17:05.566 A:middle
meditation which I can get from

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.846 A:middle
the MeditationController.

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:10.685 A:middle
And as I updated the code in the

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:12.396 A:middle
editor, the preview updated to

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
reflect this change.

00:17:14.256 --> 00:17:15.656 A:middle
Now, the text looks a little

00:17:15.656 --> 00:17:17.266 A:middle
small to me and I can make it

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.976 A:middle
larger using the Inspector.

00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:21.736 A:middle
So, I'll show the Inspector from

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:23.266 A:middle
the button in the Xcode Toolbar.

00:17:23.596 --> 00:17:25.026 A:middle
And I'll click on the Attributes

00:17:25.026 --> 00:17:25.586 A:middle
icon.

00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:27.866 A:middle
Then I'll click on the view that

00:17:27.866 --> 00:17:28.626 A:middle
I want to inspect.

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:31.086 A:middle
And here I can see the values of

00:17:31.126 --> 00:17:32.496 A:middle
all of the modifiers being

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:33.746 A:middle
applied to this view.

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:35.926 A:middle
Right now, the font is

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:37.676 A:middle
inherited, and I can change it

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:38.956 A:middle
by clicking on the Menu, and

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:40.146 A:middle
selecting Large Title.

00:17:41.296 --> 00:17:42.786 A:middle
When I do that, the preview

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:44.716 A:middle
updates and the Source Editor

00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:46.376 A:middle
automatically adds in the code

00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:48.216 A:middle
required to make this change.

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:53.276 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:55.566 A:middle
Above the text, I want to show a

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:57.686 A:middle
button to allow users to pause

00:17:57.756 --> 00:17:59.406 A:middle
and resume their meditation.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.966 A:middle
You can add in ready to use

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:03.626 A:middle
resources into the file that

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:04.836 A:middle
you're working on using the

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.946 A:middle
Library which you can access by

00:18:06.946 --> 00:18:08.436 A:middle
clicking on the plus button in

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:09.076 A:middle
the toolbar.

00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:12.056 A:middle
The Library has different

00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:14.256 A:middle
categories of objects including

00:18:14.256 --> 00:18:16.616 A:middle
views, modifiers, and code

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:17.206 A:middle
snippets.

00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:18.696 A:middle
Let's look at the code snippets

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:19.266 A:middle
category.

00:18:19.986 --> 00:18:22.616 A:middle
Xcode has built in code snippets

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:23.726 A:middle
and you can add your own

00:18:23.726 --> 00:18:25.126 A:middle
snippets too for fragments of

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:26.646 A:middle
code that you write frequently.

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:28.576 A:middle
Here, you can see all of the

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:30.006 A:middle
snippets that I have added to

00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:31.386 A:middle
allow us to add code really

00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:32.656 A:middle
quickly during this demo.

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:34.706 A:middle
But now I'll switch back to the

00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:37.176 A:middle
View Category, and I can type in

00:18:37.256 --> 00:18:38.396 A:middle
the view that I'm looking for.

00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:41.056 A:middle
I can drag in this button into

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:43.346 A:middle
the Source Editor or directly on

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.236 A:middle
to a preview.

00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:46.536 A:middle
And now the Canvas is telling me

00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:47.896 A:middle
that this button will be added

00:18:47.896 --> 00:18:50.126 A:middle
to a new vertical stack along

00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:52.306 A:middle
with the existing text.

00:18:52.356 --> 00:18:54.576 A:middle
When I drop the button, the

00:18:54.576 --> 00:18:56.036 A:middle
Source Editor will add in the

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.206 A:middle
necessary code to embed both the

00:18:58.206 --> 00:19:00.316 A:middle
button, and the text into a

00:18:58.206 --> 00:19:00.316 A:middle
button, and the text into a

00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:02.126 A:middle
vertical stack by adding a

00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:02.576 A:middle
VStack.

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:04.206 A:middle
And now I can fill in the

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:04.786 A:middle
placeholders.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.126 A:middle
When we tap the button, we want

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:08.406 A:middle
to toggle the meditation.

00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:11.646 A:middle
and rather than showing text, I

00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:13.356 A:middle
want to show an icon that's

00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:16.026 A:middle
either showing play or pause.

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:19.216 A:middle
Now finally, I only want to show

00:19:19.216 --> 00:19:21.036 A:middle
the remaining time if the user

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:22.606 A:middle
is actively meditating.

00:19:23.156 --> 00:19:24.896 A:middle
Otherwise, I want to show a

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.876 A:middle
picker with preset meditation

00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:27.546 A:middle
durations.

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:30.216 A:middle
Xcode knows a lot about the

00:19:30.216 --> 00:19:31.346 A:middle
structure of the code that I

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:33.236 A:middle
have written in the editor, and

00:19:33.236 --> 00:19:35.196 A:middle
it can help me transform and

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.916 A:middle
refactor my code using

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:38.016 A:middle
structured editing.

00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:40.866 A:middle
If I hold on Command and click

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:42.396 A:middle
on a code structure such as

00:19:42.396 --> 00:19:44.726 A:middle
Text, Xcode will show me the

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.766 A:middle
Action Menu which has many

00:19:46.766 --> 00:19:47.856 A:middle
different actions that I can

00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:49.916 A:middle
perform to transform this code

00:19:49.916 --> 00:19:50.416 A:middle
structure.

00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:52.536 A:middle
There are also options in the

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:54.276 A:middle
Menu to Jump to Definition and

00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:56.256 A:middle
to view Quick Help for the text

00:19:56.386 --> 00:19:56.826 A:middle
symbol.

00:19:57.616 --> 00:19:59.246 A:middle
Since I only want to show the

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:00.966 A:middle
text under a certain condition,

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:00.966 A:middle
text under a certain condition,

00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:02.916 A:middle
I'll click on Make Conditional.

00:20:04.376 --> 00:20:05.266 A:middle
And now I can fill in the

00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:06.526 A:middle
placeholders again.

00:20:07.016 --> 00:20:08.616 A:middle
The condition is if the

00:20:08.616 --> 00:20:09.786 A:middle
meditation is active.

00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.756 A:middle
And now, I have another

00:20:11.826 --> 00:20:12.956 A:middle
placeholder further down in the

00:20:12.956 --> 00:20:13.436 A:middle
file.

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.486 A:middle
And I can jump to it, using the

00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:16.936 A:middle
Control-forward slash key

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:18.696 A:middle
binding which helps me really

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:19.766 A:middle
quickly fill out the missing

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:21.516 A:middle
code without even having to

00:20:21.516 --> 00:20:22.526 A:middle
touch the mouse.

00:20:23.726 --> 00:20:25.346 A:middle
Now, this is exactly what I want

00:20:25.346 --> 00:20:26.846 A:middle
my meditation view to look like.

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.496 A:middle
So now, I'll switch back to the

00:20:28.496 --> 00:20:29.946 A:middle
ContentView to add it there.

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.046 A:middle
I want to add my MeditationView

00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:34.506 A:middle
to the bottom of this VStack

00:20:34.926 --> 00:20:36.136 A:middle
along with another spacer.

00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:39.686 A:middle
And now, the preview has updated

00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:41.966 A:middle
to show me my welcome title, my

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:44.266 A:middle
Play button and my picker to

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:45.726 A:middle
select the meditation duration.

00:20:46.406 --> 00:20:47.466 A:middle
Now, that I'm done with the UI,

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:49.196 A:middle
I'm going to close the Canvas.

00:20:49.796 --> 00:20:51.356 A:middle
And I'll hide the Inspector to

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:52.126 A:middle
make some more room in the

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:52.586 A:middle
editor.

00:20:54.576 --> 00:20:56.396 A:middle
Before, we try to run our app, I

00:20:56.396 --> 00:20:57.476 A:middle
want to modify the

00:20:57.476 --> 00:20:59.306 A:middle
MeditationController to make

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:00.766 A:middle
debugging a little easier.

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:00.766 A:middle
debugging a little easier.

00:21:01.566 --> 00:21:03.186 A:middle
And here, I'm going to use the

00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:05.076 A:middle
mini map to navigate to the

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.996 A:middle
Meditation Timer State section

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:07.506 A:middle
of code.

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.886 A:middle
The mini map shows me text

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.026 A:middle
labels for all of the marks

00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:13.246 A:middle
throughout this file.

00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.486 A:middle
And I can navigate to a mark by

00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:16.586 A:middle
clicking on the label in the

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
mini map.

00:21:18.626 --> 00:21:20.896 A:middle
A mark is a special comment that

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:22.716 A:middle
Xcode understands to show your

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:24.896 A:middle
sections of code any editor, in

00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:26.446 A:middle
the jump bar and into the mini

00:21:26.446 --> 00:21:26.576 A:middle
map.

00:21:27.366 --> 00:21:29.546 A:middle
Now, in this section of code, I

00:21:29.546 --> 00:21:31.366 A:middle
have several computed properties

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:32.476 A:middle
that indicate state.

00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:34.806 A:middle
To make inspecting the state

00:21:34.806 --> 00:21:36.736 A:middle
easier, I'm going to add a

00:21:36.846 --> 00:21:39.076 A:middle
stored property called State

00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:40.996 A:middle
that has one of the possible

00:21:40.996 --> 00:21:43.066 A:middle
values stopped, paused, or

00:21:43.066 --> 00:21:43.516 A:middle
running.

00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:45.026 A:middle
And I'll default this to

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:45.516 A:middle
stopped.

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:48.086 A:middle
Now, when we update the

00:21:48.086 --> 00:21:50.536 A:middle
MeditationTimer, we want to look

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:52.596 A:middle
at the timer state and update

00:21:52.596 --> 00:21:54.796 A:middle
the controller state using a

00:21:54.886 --> 00:21:55.666 A:middle
switch statement.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.086 A:middle
The possible values of the timer

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.086 A:middle
The possible values of the timer

00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:02.246 A:middle
state are nil, paused and

00:22:02.246 --> 00:22:02.576 A:middle
running.

00:22:02.896 --> 00:22:04.876 A:middle
And in Swift, switch statements

00:22:04.876 --> 00:22:06.186 A:middle
must be exhaustive.

00:22:06.716 --> 00:22:07.976 A:middle
If they're not, I'll get a

00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:09.756 A:middle
compiler error telling me to add

00:22:09.756 --> 00:22:10.746 A:middle
the missing cases.

00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:12.426 A:middle
And notice that I've gotten a

00:22:12.426 --> 00:22:14.016 A:middle
compiler error in my editor

00:22:14.016 --> 00:22:15.426 A:middle
without even building my code.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:17.746 A:middle
These are called live issues and

00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:18.836 A:middle
they appear as you type.

00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:21.506 A:middle
So if I click on the live issue,

00:22:21.626 --> 00:22:23.316 A:middle
I get a Fix-It asking me if I

00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:24.656 A:middle
want to add the missing cases.

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:26.246 A:middle
And I do. So I'll go ahead and

00:22:26.246 --> 00:22:26.656 A:middle
click on that.

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:34.456 A:middle
Now in the case where the timer

00:22:34.456 --> 00:22:36.736 A:middle
is nil, I want the state to be

00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:37.176 A:middle
stopped.

00:22:38.266 --> 00:22:40.106 A:middle
Now, rather than having a catch

00:22:40.106 --> 00:22:42.046 A:middle
all case for all of the possible

00:22:42.046 --> 00:22:43.856 A:middle
values that can be wrapped, I

00:22:43.856 --> 00:22:46.056 A:middle
want explicit cases for each of

00:22:46.056 --> 00:22:46.776 A:middle
those values.

00:22:47.276 --> 00:22:48.676 A:middle
So I'll change this underscore

00:22:48.676 --> 00:22:50.266 A:middle
to the first value which is

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:50.666 A:middle
running.

00:22:51.316 --> 00:22:52.696 A:middle
And now that I've done that,

00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:54.166 A:middle
this switch statement is no

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:55.246 A:middle
longer exhaustive.

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:57.816 A:middle
So, I'll get another live issue

00:22:58.246 --> 00:22:59.636 A:middle
with another Fix-It to add at

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:00.856 A:middle
there with last remaining case.

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:00.856 A:middle
there with last remaining case.

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:04.986 A:middle
And I don't need this associated

00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.386 A:middle
value so I'll go ahead and

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.356 A:middle
remove that.

00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:10.556 A:middle
You may have noticed that these

00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:12.546 A:middle
two names, running and paused,

00:23:12.546 --> 00:23:14.446 A:middle
are the same as the remaining

00:23:14.446 --> 00:23:16.376 A:middle
cases of this State enum.

00:23:16.696 --> 00:23:18.136 A:middle
And I can use multi-cursor

00:23:18.136 --> 00:23:19.746 A:middle
editing to quickly fill out the

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:20.736 A:middle
code placeholders.

00:23:21.696 --> 00:23:23.146 A:middle
Right now, I have one insertion

00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:24.966 A:middle
point, and I can add another one

00:23:25.066 --> 00:23:26.536 A:middle
by holding down Control and

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:28.406 A:middle
Shift and clicking where I want

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.836 A:middle
to place my next insertion

00:23:29.836 --> 00:23:30.106 A:middle
point.

00:23:31.746 --> 00:23:33.086 A:middle
Now that I have multiple

00:23:33.086 --> 00:23:35.116 A:middle
insertion points, I can perform

00:23:35.356 --> 00:23:37.246 A:middle
any command and that command

00:23:37.246 --> 00:23:39.016 A:middle
will act on each my insertion

00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:39.506 A:middle
points.

00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:41.476 A:middle
To see all of the commands that

00:23:41.476 --> 00:23:43.476 A:middle
are available, you can go to the

00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:45.986 A:middle
Xcode Preferences, select the

00:23:45.986 --> 00:23:46.936 A:middle
Key Bindings Tab.

00:23:47.486 --> 00:23:48.786 A:middle
And here you can see all of the

00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:50.586 A:middle
commands and their key bindings,

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.006 A:middle
and you can even change the key

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.306 A:middle
binding to be whatever you like.

00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:55.596 A:middle
So I'll will show you a few now.

00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:57.766 A:middle
I can select the word back,

00:23:58.366 --> 00:24:00.586 A:middle
copy, jump to next placeholder,

00:23:58.366 --> 00:24:00.586 A:middle
copy, jump to next placeholder,

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:03.126 A:middle
type and paste.

00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:05.416 A:middle
And now, we're done.

00:24:06.516 --> 00:24:10.616 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.246 A:middle
And this is all of the code that

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:13.636 A:middle
we need to implement the basic

00:24:13.636 --> 00:24:14.686 A:middle
functionality of our App.

00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:17.026 A:middle
Before we dive into running and

00:24:17.026 --> 00:24:18.686 A:middle
debugging, let's review what we

00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:19.866 A:middle
learned about the Source Editor.

00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:26.606 A:middle
We saw how Xcode's interactive

00:24:26.646 --> 00:24:28.436 A:middle
Canvas can help us preview the

00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:30.746 A:middle
UI of our app and help us edit

00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:32.096 A:middle
the appearance of our views.

00:24:33.236 --> 00:24:34.956 A:middle
We learned how code completion

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:36.046 A:middle
can greatly speed up the

00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:37.086 A:middle
development process.

00:24:38.456 --> 00:24:40.286 A:middle
Then we saw how Xcode can help

00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:41.746 A:middle
us transform and add

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.016 A:middle
functionality to our code

00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:44.626 A:middle
structures automatically from

00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:45.616 A:middle
the Action Menu.

00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:48.766 A:middle
And finally, we saw how live

00:24:48.816 --> 00:24:50.366 A:middle
issues and Fix-Its can help us

00:24:50.416 --> 00:24:52.156 A:middle
fix our compiler errors before

00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:53.366 A:middle
even building our project.

00:24:54.486 --> 00:24:56.346 A:middle
For more information on the new

00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:57.696 A:middle
Swift language features that we

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:59.806 A:middle
saw or the SwiftUI framework

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.446 A:middle
that we built-- that we used to

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.446 A:middle
that we built-- that we used to

00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:03.266 A:middle
build up our views, please watch

00:25:03.316 --> 00:25:04.766 A:middle
the What's New in Swift and the

00:25:04.766 --> 00:25:06.336 A:middle
Introducing SwiftUI Session

00:25:06.336 --> 00:25:07.056 A:middle
recordings.

00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:09.516 A:middle
And now that we're ready to run

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:11.026 A:middle
the app, I'm going to hand it

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:12.416 A:middle
off to Honza to walk us through

00:25:12.416 --> 00:25:13.316 A:middle
running and the bugging.

00:25:14.516 --> 00:25:19.496 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:20.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Holly.

00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:22.996 A:middle
Hi, my name is Honza and I'm and

00:25:22.996 --> 00:25:23.836 A:middle
Xcode engineer.

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.316 A:middle
So now that Prachi created our

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:28.146 A:middle
project and Holly added some

00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:29.896 A:middle
codes to it, we'll talk about

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:32.406 A:middle
how we can build, run and debug

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:34.606 A:middle
our app on the simulator and on

00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:35.406 A:middle
a real device.

00:25:36.016 --> 00:25:37.586 A:middle
And then, we'll add a Swift

00:25:37.586 --> 00:25:39.376 A:middle
Package dependency that allows

00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:40.756 A:middle
us to add new feature to our

00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:40.966 A:middle
app.

00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.306 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:25:50.096 --> 00:25:52.186 A:middle
So Prachi has shown you how to

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:54.226 A:middle
build and run our app using the

00:25:54.226 --> 00:25:55.726 A:middle
Run button in the toolbar.

00:25:56.136 --> 00:25:57.886 A:middle
But we can also do this from the

00:25:57.936 --> 00:25:59.206 A:middle
Product Menu where we have the

00:25:59.206 --> 00:26:02.196 A:middle
options to Run, Test, Archive,

00:25:59.206 --> 00:26:02.196 A:middle
options to Run, Test, Archive,

00:26:02.316 --> 00:26:03.366 A:middle
Build and many more.

00:26:03.906 --> 00:26:06.216 A:middle
So right now, I will run the app

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:07.106 A:middle
on the simulator.

00:26:09.446 --> 00:26:10.836 A:middle
The app is being built,

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:13.066 A:middle
installed, and launched on the

00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:14.436 A:middle
iPhone simulator, and the

00:26:14.556 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
simulator app comes to the

00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:17.146 A:middle
foreground automatically.

00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:19.376 A:middle
So this is what our app looks

00:26:19.376 --> 00:26:20.496 A:middle
like right now.

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:22.826 A:middle
So, because we're moving pretty

00:26:22.826 --> 00:26:24.026 A:middle
fast, let's do a quick

00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:26.556 A:middle
meditation using our new app.

00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:28.846 A:middle
All I have to do is click on the

00:26:28.846 --> 00:26:30.556 A:middle
Play button to start a new 3

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:31.646 A:middle
minute meditation.

00:26:32.816 --> 00:26:35.236 A:middle
So the meditation started

00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:37.476 A:middle
correctly, but the Play icon

00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:39.126 A:middle
didn't change which I think is

00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:39.616 A:middle
wrong.

00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:42.186 A:middle
Just like in music apps, we want

00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:44.356 A:middle
to show the Play icon when the

00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:46.046 A:middle
meditation is paused, and the

00:26:46.116 --> 00:26:48.056 A:middle
Pause icon when the meditation

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:48.636 A:middle
is running.

00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:50.156 A:middle
So we'll use the debugger

00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:51.816 A:middle
integration in Xcode to help us

00:26:51.816 --> 00:26:53.556 A:middle
find and fix this bug.

00:26:55.316 --> 00:26:57.476 A:middle
To run our app with debugger

00:26:57.476 --> 00:26:58.866 A:middle
attached to it, I don't need to

00:26:58.866 --> 00:26:59.836 A:middle
do anything special.

00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:02.206 A:middle
As when I just run my app right

00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:04.716 A:middle
now, Xcode automatically

00:27:05.306 --> 00:27:07.696 A:middle
attached debugger.

00:27:07.816 --> 00:27:09.406 A:middle
So, I'll leave the app running

00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:10.736 A:middle
in the simulator right now and

00:27:10.736 --> 00:27:11.806 A:middle
go back to Xcode.

00:27:12.186 --> 00:27:13.746 A:middle
And we'll start to looking in

00:27:13.746 --> 00:27:14.826 A:middle
the MeditationView.

00:27:15.346 --> 00:27:16.736 A:middle
We'll get to the MeditationView

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:18.296 A:middle
by using the Jump Bar.

00:27:18.886 --> 00:27:21.386 A:middle
And the MeditationView is

00:27:21.386 --> 00:27:23.106 A:middle
responsible for showing the Play

00:27:23.106 --> 00:27:24.936 A:middle
icon and the remaining time

00:27:24.936 --> 00:27:25.416 A:middle
label.

00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:26.966 A:middle
And here, it seems that we're

00:27:26.966 --> 00:27:29.016 A:middle
getting the image from the

00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:30.126 A:middle
MeditationController's

00:27:30.396 --> 00:27:32.006 A:middle
displayedIcon property.

00:27:32.856 --> 00:27:35.136 A:middle
So, to get there, I will Command

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:37.326 A:middle
click on displayedIcon and

00:27:37.326 --> 00:27:38.676 A:middle
select Jump to Definition.

00:27:39.806 --> 00:27:41.056 A:middle
And here we are in the

00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:42.256 A:middle
MeditationController.

00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:45.156 A:middle
So I will add a breakpoint to

00:27:45.156 --> 00:27:46.726 A:middle
the second line of the

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:49.016 A:middle
displayedIcon property getter by

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:50.446 A:middle
clicking on the line number.

00:27:50.996 --> 00:27:54.046 A:middle
And because the app is still

00:27:54.046 --> 00:27:55.386 A:middle
running in the simulator and the

00:27:55.386 --> 00:27:57.196 A:middle
timer is still ticking, the

00:27:57.196 --> 00:27:58.766 A:middle
breakpoint got hit right away

00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:00.376 A:middle
and highlighted the line in

00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:00.376 A:middle
and highlighted the line in

00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:00.826 A:middle
green.

00:28:02.136 --> 00:28:03.946 A:middle
Breakpoints in general allow us

00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:05.836 A:middle
to pause the app's execution

00:28:05.836 --> 00:28:07.526 A:middle
when it hits a specific line of

00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:07.996 A:middle
code.

00:28:08.696 --> 00:28:10.576 A:middle
So at the bottom of the Xcode

00:28:10.576 --> 00:28:12.166 A:middle
window now, let me make this a

00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:14.106 A:middle
bit bigger, we have to debug

00:28:14.106 --> 00:28:15.716 A:middle
area, at top of which is the

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.656 A:middle
Debug Bar with the buttons to

00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
control the debugger, as well as

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:21.216 A:middle
to activate features like the

00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:22.936 A:middle
View Debugger, the Memory Graph

00:28:22.936 --> 00:28:24.066 A:middle
Debugger and more.

00:28:24.926 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
Below it, we have the variables

00:28:26.516 --> 00:28:28.686 A:middle
view on the left and the console

00:28:28.766 --> 00:28:29.316 A:middle
on the right.

00:28:30.426 --> 00:28:31.876 A:middle
And finally, on the left hand

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.616 A:middle
side of the Xcode window, we

00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:35.396 A:middle
have to Debug Navigator within

00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:36.436 A:middle
information about our running

00:28:36.436 --> 00:28:37.786 A:middle
app, like how much work it's

00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:39.026 A:middle
doing, how much memory it's

00:28:39.026 --> 00:28:39.556 A:middle
using.

00:28:40.016 --> 00:28:41.866 A:middle
And below it, we have to calls

00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:42.296 A:middle
stack.

00:28:42.636 --> 00:28:44.186 A:middle
The call stack is the record of

00:28:44.186 --> 00:28:46.006 A:middle
how this code is being called.

00:28:46.936 --> 00:28:48.276 A:middle
And when I select a different

00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:50.766 A:middle
frame in the call stack, Xcode

00:28:50.766 --> 00:28:52.516 A:middle
switches the Source Editor, the

00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:54.226 A:middle
debugger, and even the variables

00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:54.866 A:middle
down here.

00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:58.266 A:middle
So, I'll switch back to the

00:28:58.266 --> 00:29:00.206 A:middle
original frame and we'll get

00:28:58.266 --> 00:29:00.206 A:middle
original frame and we'll get

00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:01.636 A:middle
back to trying to fix the bug

00:29:01.636 --> 00:29:03.016 A:middle
where the icon didn't change

00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:05.266 A:middle
after we started the meditation.

00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:08.486 A:middle
So, let's look at and which icon

00:29:08.486 --> 00:29:09.746 A:middle
is being used to right now.

00:29:09.746 --> 00:29:12.196 A:middle
I can do that by selecting the

00:29:12.196 --> 00:29:14.596 A:middle
variable and clicking on the

00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:16.796 A:middle
Quick Look icon at the bottom.

00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:19.316 A:middle
And here, we get a preview.

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:23.456 A:middle
And because the variable that

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:25.536 A:middle
we're previewing is an image, we

00:29:25.536 --> 00:29:27.126 A:middle
actually got a rendered version

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.986 A:middle
and damage right here in Xcode.

00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:31.756 A:middle
Quick Look preview supports

00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:34.106 A:middle
images, colors, views, any

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:35.596 A:middle
custom objects that implement

00:29:35.596 --> 00:29:37.096 A:middle
the debug Quick Look object

00:29:37.136 --> 00:29:37.526 A:middle
method.

00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:40.806 A:middle
So in the preview, we can see

00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:42.246 A:middle
that we're still showing the

00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:43.826 A:middle
Play icon even though the

00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:45.306 A:middle
meditation is already running.

00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:47.236 A:middle
So I wonder if it's because the

00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:48.976 A:middle
MeditationController is in the

00:29:48.976 --> 00:29:49.576 A:middle
wrong state.

00:29:50.446 --> 00:29:52.786 A:middle
To find that out, I will expand

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:54.226 A:middle
the self variable which refers

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:55.316 A:middle
to the MeditationController

00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:57.246 A:middle
we're debugging here and we

00:29:57.246 --> 00:29:58.296 A:middle
reveal the properties.

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:00.426 A:middle
And one of them is the state

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:00.426 A:middle
And one of them is the state

00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:02.206 A:middle
property that is telling us that

00:30:02.206 --> 00:30:03.926 A:middle
the MeditationController is in

00:30:03.926 --> 00:30:04.836 A:middle
the running state.

00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.486 A:middle
So that's what I expected.

00:30:07.786 --> 00:30:08.626 A:middle
And that means that the

00:30:08.626 --> 00:30:10.946 A:middle
displayedIcon property getter is

00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:12.746 A:middle
not taking the state of the

00:30:12.746 --> 00:30:13.846 A:middle
MeditationController into

00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:15.666 A:middle
account when picking which icon

00:30:15.666 --> 00:30:16.076 A:middle
to show.

00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:19.806 A:middle
So to fix that, we will check if

00:30:19.806 --> 00:30:21.006 A:middle
the MeditationController is

00:30:21.006 --> 00:30:21.496 A:middle
running.

00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:23.986 A:middle
And if so, we will show the

00:30:23.986 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
pause it, we will show the Pause

00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:29.416 A:middle
icon, and otherwise, we'll show

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:30.336 A:middle
the Play icon.

00:30:31.116 --> 00:30:31.996 A:middle
Now, because I don't need the

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.256 A:middle
breakpoint anymore, I will

00:30:33.256 --> 00:30:36.376 A:middle
remove it by dragging out and

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:37.016 A:middle
letting go.

00:30:37.706 --> 00:30:39.146 A:middle
And because we changed the code

00:30:39.146 --> 00:30:41.516 A:middle
just now, I will stop the app

00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:43.916 A:middle
and click the Run button again.

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:45.906 A:middle
This recompiles the project,

00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:47.846 A:middle
reinstalls and relaunches the

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.806 A:middle
app in the simulator.

00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:51.086 A:middle
Now this time, when I start a

00:30:51.086 --> 00:30:53.356 A:middle
new meditation, we can see that

00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:54.516 A:middle
the icon changed from Play to

00:30:54.516 --> 00:30:54.916 A:middle
Pause.

00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:56.086 A:middle
So the bug is fixed.

00:30:56.296 --> 00:30:56.546 A:middle
Great.

00:30:57.516 --> 00:31:02.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:57.516 --> 00:31:02.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:03.306 --> 00:31:04.816 A:middle
So we'll stop the app for now

00:31:05.976 --> 00:31:08.036 A:middle
and we'll hide the debug area.

00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:11.476 A:middle
So, we have been running our app

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:12.496 A:middle
on the simulator which is a

00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:14.276 A:middle
great way to quickly iterate on

00:31:14.276 --> 00:31:14.856 A:middle
our code.

00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:17.386 A:middle
But I would also like to install

00:31:17.386 --> 00:31:19.526 A:middle
my app on a real device so that

00:31:19.526 --> 00:31:20.976 A:middle
I can start meditating on the go

00:31:20.976 --> 00:31:21.486 A:middle
as well.

00:31:22.446 --> 00:31:25.596 A:middle
First, to be able to run-- to

00:31:25.596 --> 00:31:26.946 A:middle
install and run apps on

00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:28.526 A:middle
connected devices, we have to

00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.576 A:middle
sign into Xcode with our Apple

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:30.946 A:middle
ID.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.486 A:middle
We'll do that by going to Xcode

00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:36.716 A:middle
Preferences, select an account,

00:31:36.976 --> 00:31:38.186 A:middle
and adding new account.

00:31:39.146 --> 00:31:41.866 A:middle
We'll select the Apple ID, type

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:42.976 A:middle
in the username and password.

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:54.556 A:middle
And there, we sign in to Xcode

00:31:54.556 --> 00:31:55.376 A:middle
with our Apple ID.

00:31:55.806 --> 00:31:58.216 A:middle
Next, I'll close the window and

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.316 A:middle
I will go to the Project

00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:00.966 A:middle
Navigator and select the

00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:00.966 A:middle
Navigator and select the

00:32:00.966 --> 00:32:01.536 A:middle
project.

00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:04.266 A:middle
Here, we'll select the app

00:32:04.306 --> 00:32:06.176 A:middle
target and go to the Signing

00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:07.546 A:middle
&amp;Capabilities Tab.

00:32:08.516 --> 00:32:09.816 A:middle
This is where we manage code

00:32:09.816 --> 00:32:11.146 A:middle
signing and capabilities.

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:13.836 A:middle
Capabilities allow us to declare

00:32:13.836 --> 00:32:15.606 A:middle
what permissions our app needs.

00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:17.696 A:middle
And in our case, we need to

00:32:17.696 --> 00:32:19.746 A:middle
access to the HealthKit data to

00:32:19.746 --> 00:32:21.296 A:middle
be able to write meditations

00:32:21.296 --> 00:32:23.016 A:middle
that the user performed in our

00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:24.346 A:middle
app, but also to read

00:32:24.346 --> 00:32:25.436 A:middle
meditations that the user

00:32:25.436 --> 00:32:27.006 A:middle
performed in other apps so, that

00:32:27.006 --> 00:32:28.366 A:middle
we can show them statistics for

00:32:28.366 --> 00:32:29.506 A:middle
all of their mindfulness

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:30.006 A:middle
activity.

00:32:31.176 --> 00:32:32.546 A:middle
So we'll add a new capability,

00:32:33.096 --> 00:32:36.376 A:middle
search for health, and select

00:32:36.376 --> 00:32:37.316 A:middle
the HealthKit capability.

00:32:37.796 --> 00:32:41.076 A:middle
Next, I have this iPhone

00:32:41.296 --> 00:32:42.496 A:middle
connected to my Mac here.

00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:45.366 A:middle
So, I will select that as the

00:32:45.366 --> 00:32:48.326 A:middle
run destination, and I will

00:32:48.326 --> 00:32:48.926 A:middle
click Run.

00:32:49.766 --> 00:32:51.436 A:middle
Now, the app is being built for

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:53.176 A:middle
the device, installed, and

00:32:53.176 --> 00:32:53.816 A:middle
launched there.

00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:55.146 A:middle
And so that you can watch what's

00:32:55.146 --> 00:32:56.736 A:middle
going on on the screen, we'll

00:32:56.736 --> 00:32:58.196 A:middle
use QuickTime Player which

00:32:58.196 --> 00:33:00.116 A:middle
allows me to stream the iPhone

00:32:58.196 --> 00:33:00.116 A:middle
allows me to stream the iPhone

00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.646 A:middle
screen back to the Mac.

00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:05.716 A:middle
So there, we have Mind running

00:33:05.716 --> 00:33:07.366 A:middle
on a real iPhone now and I could

00:33:07.366 --> 00:33:09.146 A:middle
just unplug this phone and start

00:33:09.146 --> 00:33:10.266 A:middle
meditating on the go.

00:33:10.996 --> 00:33:14.856 A:middle
Now, let me stop the app and

00:33:14.856 --> 00:33:16.576 A:middle
switch the destination back to

00:33:16.576 --> 00:33:17.076 A:middle
the simulator.

00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:19.536 A:middle
When you want to find out more

00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:21.326 A:middle
about devices, you can go

00:33:21.456 --> 00:33:24.136 A:middle
Window, Devices and Simulators

00:33:24.246 --> 00:33:26.236 A:middle
where we can see the name, the

00:33:26.236 --> 00:33:28.176 A:middle
type, and the OS version of the

00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:30.596 A:middle
device, as well as we can see

00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:31.766 A:middle
the installed apps that we've

00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:32.806 A:middle
put there.

00:33:33.306 --> 00:33:34.546 A:middle
But also, we could actually

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:36.306 A:middle
configure the device to connect

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:38.406 A:middle
to Mac over WiFi.

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:39.976 A:middle
In that way, I wouldn't need to

00:33:40.076 --> 00:33:41.796 A:middle
physically plug in the phone to

00:33:41.796 --> 00:33:43.466 A:middle
the Mac over USB at all and I

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:44.766 A:middle
would still be able to build,

00:33:44.976 --> 00:33:46.346 A:middle
run, and debug on it.

00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:55.666 A:middle
So, now that we successfully run

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.186 A:middle
our app both on the simulator

00:33:57.416 --> 00:33:59.066 A:middle
and on our device and we even

00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.896 A:middle
fixed a bug in it using the

00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.896 A:middle
fixed a bug in it using the

00:34:00.896 --> 00:34:02.296 A:middle
debugger, let's talk about

00:34:02.296 --> 00:34:04.536 A:middle
adding more functionality to our

00:34:05.306 --> 00:34:05.386 A:middle
app.

00:34:05.646 --> 00:34:06.846 A:middle
I'd like our app to show the

00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:08.846 A:middle
users statistics about their

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.676 A:middle
meditations, like how many they

00:34:10.676 --> 00:34:12.166 A:middle
have performed, what the average

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:14.045 A:middle
duration was, and so on.

00:34:14.606 --> 00:34:16.045 A:middle
But calculating statistics is

00:34:16.045 --> 00:34:17.716 A:middle
not a specific problem to just

00:34:17.716 --> 00:34:18.576 A:middle
our meditation app.

00:34:18.996 --> 00:34:20.306 A:middle
So we have created a Swift

00:34:20.366 --> 00:34:22.556 A:middle
Package called QuickStats that

00:34:22.556 --> 00:34:23.956 A:middle
solves that problem for us.

00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:27.396 A:middle
A Swift Package is basically a

00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:29.235 A:middle
folder with the manifest file

00:34:29.456 --> 00:34:31.376 A:middle
and source files that you can

00:34:31.376 --> 00:34:33.886 A:middle
use to build products like our

00:34:33.886 --> 00:34:34.916 A:middle
QuickStats library.

00:34:36.255 --> 00:34:37.275 A:middle
To add the package to our

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.306 A:middle
project, I will go to the

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:41.826 A:middle
project editor and select Swift

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:42.856 A:middle
Packages at the top.

00:34:43.406 --> 00:34:45.096 A:middle
Here, I will add a new package

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:45.815 A:middle
to our project.

00:34:46.556 --> 00:34:48.016 A:middle
And because Prachi signed us

00:34:48.065 --> 00:34:50.016 A:middle
into GitHub with our account, we

00:34:50.016 --> 00:34:51.656 A:middle
can actually see all the

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:53.226 A:middle
repositories that our account

00:34:53.356 --> 00:34:54.036 A:middle
has favorited.

00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:55.926 A:middle
QuickStats is right here at the

00:34:55.926 --> 00:34:57.085 A:middle
top, so I'll select it.

00:34:58.226 --> 00:34:58.816 A:middle
Click Next.

00:34:59.426 --> 00:35:00.716 A:middle
We'll, use version 1.

00:34:59.426 --> 00:35:00.716 A:middle
We'll, use version 1.

00:35:00.716 --> 00:35:01.396 A:middle
That looks good.

00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:06.586 A:middle
And this is where we make sure

00:35:06.586 --> 00:35:08.446 A:middle
that the QuickStats library gets

00:35:08.446 --> 00:35:09.436 A:middle
linked with our app.

00:35:09.436 --> 00:35:13.076 A:middle
I'll click Finish, and now Xcode

00:35:13.076 --> 00:35:14.736 A:middle
manages the fetching of the

00:35:14.736 --> 00:35:15.946 A:middle
package in the background.

00:35:16.776 --> 00:35:18.226 A:middle
And in the Project Navigator,

00:35:18.426 --> 00:35:19.266 A:middle
there's an Swift Package

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:21.166 A:middle
dependency section where I can

00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:23.056 A:middle
actually browse the sources of

00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:24.896 A:middle
the package which is a great way

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:26.226 A:middle
to understand how the package

00:35:26.226 --> 00:35:29.366 A:middle
works under the hood.

00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:30.886 A:middle
Now, before I hand it back over

00:35:30.886 --> 00:35:32.086 A:middle
to Holly to integrate this

00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:34.196 A:middle
package into our project, let's

00:35:34.196 --> 00:35:34.956 A:middle
do a quick recap.

00:35:41.916 --> 00:35:45.026 A:middle
We saw how we can run and debug

00:35:45.026 --> 00:35:46.586 A:middle
our app on the simulator.

00:35:47.206 --> 00:35:49.556 A:middle
And we also ran our app on a

00:35:49.556 --> 00:35:50.266 A:middle
real device.

00:35:51.186 --> 00:35:53.026 A:middle
And then we added the Swift

00:35:53.066 --> 00:35:54.226 A:middle
Package dependency to our

00:35:54.226 --> 00:35:56.086 A:middle
project that allows us to add a

00:35:56.086 --> 00:35:57.826 A:middle
feature to our app.

00:36:00.976 --> 00:36:02.886 A:middle
These are the sessions relevant

00:36:02.886 --> 00:36:04.156 A:middle
to the topics discussed in this

00:36:04.156 --> 00:36:04.596 A:middle
demo.

00:36:04.876 --> 00:36:06.346 A:middle
And next, please welcome Holly

00:36:06.346 --> 00:36:06.626 A:middle
back.

00:36:06.896 --> 00:36:07.216 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:13.936 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:36:14.436 --> 00:36:15.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Honza.

00:36:16.266 --> 00:36:19.736 A:middle
During this demo, we will see

00:36:19.816 --> 00:36:21.016 A:middle
how to use the QuickStats

00:36:21.016 --> 00:36:22.456 A:middle
package in our project.

00:36:22.906 --> 00:36:25.096 A:middle
After that, we will walk through

00:36:25.096 --> 00:36:26.896 A:middle
how to restructure our project

00:36:26.986 --> 00:36:28.846 A:middle
by moving our model code into a

00:36:28.846 --> 00:36:29.316 A:middle
framework.

00:36:29.886 --> 00:36:32.076 A:middle
Let's head back to Xcode to get

00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:32.536 A:middle
started.

00:36:41.546 --> 00:36:43.206 A:middle
Now, that we've added the

00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:45.316 A:middle
QuickStats package, we can

00:36:45.316 --> 00:36:47.146 A:middle
import the package into our code

00:36:47.146 --> 00:36:49.706 A:middle
and start using its public APIs.

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:51.396 A:middle
As Honza mentioned, we want to

00:36:51.396 --> 00:36:53.246 A:middle
show our users some statistics

00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:55.026 A:middle
about their meditation sessions

00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:56.266 A:middle
in the ContentView.

00:36:57.196 --> 00:36:57.966 A:middle
We'll jump back to the

00:36:57.966 --> 00:36:59.876 A:middle
ContentView.swift using Open

00:36:59.876 --> 00:37:01.596 A:middle
Quickly which you can find under

00:36:59.876 --> 00:37:01.596 A:middle
Quickly which you can find under

00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:02.406 A:middle
the File Menu.

00:37:02.956 --> 00:37:06.586 A:middle
In Open Quickly, I can enter any

00:37:06.586 --> 00:37:08.986 A:middle
type name, method name, or file

00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:10.176 A:middle
name to navigate to.

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:12.606 A:middle
So I'll type Contentview and

00:37:12.606 --> 00:37:13.166 A:middle
press Enter.

00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:15.436 A:middle
The first thing that I need to

00:37:15.436 --> 00:37:18.226 A:middle
do is import QuickStats.

00:37:19.836 --> 00:37:21.886 A:middle
Now we're ready to start using

00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:23.436 A:middle
the APIs from this package.

00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:26.276 A:middle
I'm going to add some code below

00:37:26.276 --> 00:37:27.936 A:middle
the contentView from a code

00:37:27.936 --> 00:37:29.956 A:middle
snippet that implements

00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:32.236 A:middle
StatisticsView that takes in an

00:37:32.236 --> 00:37:34.496 A:middle
array of meditation sessions and

00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:36.866 A:middle
displays statistics about those

00:37:36.866 --> 00:37:39.266 A:middle
sessions using QuickStats APIs.

00:37:40.596 --> 00:37:42.386 A:middle
Since I have access to all of

00:37:42.386 --> 00:37:44.236 A:middle
the package source code, I can

00:37:44.236 --> 00:37:45.336 A:middle
jump to the source code

00:37:45.336 --> 00:37:47.606 A:middle
implementation to understand how

00:37:47.606 --> 00:37:48.096 A:middle
it works.

00:37:48.716 --> 00:37:50.766 A:middle
So if I Command click on

00:37:50.766 --> 00:37:52.846 A:middle
QuickStats.averageDuration and

00:37:52.846 --> 00:37:55.186 A:middle
select Jump to Definition, I'm

00:37:55.186 --> 00:37:56.726 A:middle
now looking at the actual

00:37:56.726 --> 00:37:58.446 A:middle
implementation of this method.

00:37:58.856 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
I can see where the file is in

00:37:58.856 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
I can see where the file is in

00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:02.966 A:middle
the Project Navigator by

00:38:02.966 --> 00:38:04.966 A:middle
clicking on Navigate, Reveal in

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:05.986 A:middle
Project Navigator.

00:38:06.586 --> 00:38:07.896 A:middle
And now we can see that we're in

00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:09.076 A:middle
the package source code.

00:38:09.486 --> 00:38:11.106 A:middle
I can navigate back to the

00:38:11.106 --> 00:38:12.896 A:middle
previous file by using the

00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:14.426 A:middle
Editor History button in the

00:38:14.426 --> 00:38:14.916 A:middle
Jump Bar.

00:38:14.916 --> 00:38:17.236 A:middle
Now, let's add the

00:38:17.236 --> 00:38:19.206 A:middle
StatisticsView to the

00:38:19.206 --> 00:38:20.036 A:middle
ContentView.

00:38:20.606 --> 00:38:22.036 A:middle
But before we do that, I want to

00:38:22.036 --> 00:38:22.906 A:middle
show the Canvas.

00:38:28.896 --> 00:38:30.726 A:middle
And I'll zoom out so we can see

00:38:30.726 --> 00:38:31.516 A:middle
the full device.

00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:34.566 A:middle
I'll add the StatisticsView

00:38:34.566 --> 00:38:37.666 A:middle
below the spacer and it takes in

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.076 A:middle
an array of sessions which we

00:38:39.076 --> 00:38:39.796 A:middle
can get from the

00:38:39.796 --> 00:38:40.926 A:middle
MeditationController.

00:38:42.836 --> 00:38:43.746 A:middle
Now, we can see the

00:38:43.746 --> 00:38:45.276 A:middle
StatisticsView at the bottom of

00:38:45.276 --> 00:38:46.116 A:middle
our ContentView.

00:38:46.906 --> 00:38:48.076 A:middle
And now that I'm done with the

00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:51.896 A:middle
UI, I'll close the Canvas again.

00:38:52.486 --> 00:38:54.156 A:middle
Now, we want to start writing

00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:55.706 A:middle
unit tests for our model.

00:38:55.896 --> 00:38:58.006 A:middle
And to make this easier, we are

00:38:58.006 --> 00:38:59.536 A:middle
going to move our model code

00:38:59.536 --> 00:39:01.486 A:middle
into a unit testable framework.

00:38:59.536 --> 00:39:01.486 A:middle
into a unit testable framework.

00:39:02.026 --> 00:39:03.836 A:middle
I could choose to use a Swift

00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:05.536 A:middle
Package, but I only want to

00:39:05.536 --> 00:39:07.036 A:middle
share this code with my team.

00:39:07.306 --> 00:39:08.406 A:middle
So I'm going to choose a

00:39:08.406 --> 00:39:09.456 A:middle
framework instead.

00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:11.866 A:middle
We need to create a new target

00:39:12.446 --> 00:39:15.816 A:middle
and I can use the filter bar to

00:39:15.816 --> 00:39:16.596 A:middle
search for the framework.

00:39:17.296 --> 00:39:19.336 A:middle
And I'm going to call this

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:20.476 A:middle
framework MindKit.

00:39:20.736 --> 00:39:23.916 A:middle
I want to make sure to check the

00:39:23.916 --> 00:39:26.426 A:middle
box to include a unit tests so

00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:28.176 A:middle
that a unit test target is

00:39:28.256 --> 00:39:29.926 A:middle
automatically created when I

00:39:29.926 --> 00:39:30.806 A:middle
create the framework.

00:39:34.656 --> 00:39:36.226 A:middle
Now, before I move the code

00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:38.666 A:middle
over, I want to import MindKit

00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:39.946 A:middle
into all of the files that I

00:39:39.946 --> 00:39:41.236 A:middle
know will need it.

00:39:41.586 --> 00:39:43.026 A:middle
I know I'm going to move over

00:39:43.026 --> 00:39:44.546 A:middle
HealthStore.swift.

00:39:44.546 --> 00:39:46.396 A:middle
And this file has two public

00:39:46.396 --> 00:39:47.756 A:middle
types that are used throughout

00:39:47.756 --> 00:39:48.376 A:middle
the project.

00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:50.566 A:middle
And I'm going to use the Find

00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:52.096 A:middle
Navigator to figure out where

00:39:52.096 --> 00:39:53.206 A:middle
these types are used.

00:39:53.956 --> 00:39:55.536 A:middle
I'll switch to Find Navigator,

00:39:55.536 --> 00:39:58.296 A:middle
and the Find Navigator allows me

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:00.336 A:middle
to search my entire project for

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:00.336 A:middle
to search my entire project for

00:40:00.336 --> 00:40:02.906 A:middle
text, symbol references, regular

00:40:02.906 --> 00:40:03.976 A:middle
expressions and more.

00:40:04.996 --> 00:40:06.126 A:middle
Right now, I want a regular

00:40:06.126 --> 00:40:09.116 A:middle
expression and I want to search

00:40:09.116 --> 00:40:12.326 A:middle
for HealthSession or

00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:13.666 A:middle
HealthStore.

00:40:14.126 --> 00:40:15.246 A:middle
And I'll press Enter to see the

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:15.836 A:middle
results.

00:40:16.086 --> 00:40:18.296 A:middle
I know that I'm going to be

00:40:18.296 --> 00:40:20.386 A:middle
moving HealthStore.swift and

00:40:20.386 --> 00:40:22.546 A:middle
HealthStoreFactory.swift into

00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:23.656 A:middle
the MindKit framework.

00:40:23.946 --> 00:40:25.446 A:middle
And I can these results by

00:40:25.446 --> 00:40:26.626 A:middle
clicking on the disclosure

00:40:26.626 --> 00:40:27.216 A:middle
triangle.

00:40:28.696 --> 00:40:30.206 A:middle
Now, I'll navigate to each of

00:40:30.206 --> 00:40:32.486 A:middle
these files and add the import.

00:40:32.486 --> 00:40:35.766 A:middle
So I'll jump to the top of the

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:38.606 A:middle
file here, and the import, and

00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:40.946 A:middle
then finally, we need it in

00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:42.886 A:middle
ContentView.swift.

00:40:44.366 --> 00:40:46.036 A:middle
Now, we're ready to move the

00:40:46.036 --> 00:40:46.846 A:middle
files over.

00:40:46.846 --> 00:40:47.856 A:middle
So I'll switch back to the

00:40:47.856 --> 00:40:48.886 A:middle
Project Navigator.

00:40:48.886 --> 00:40:51.386 A:middle
As I mentioned, I want to move

00:40:51.386 --> 00:40:53.456 A:middle
over HealthStore.swift, but I

00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:54.656 A:middle
also want to move over

00:40:54.656 --> 00:40:56.376 A:middle
HealthStoreFactory.swift.

00:40:57.086 --> 00:40:59.126 A:middle
I can select multiple files in

00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:00.716 A:middle
the Project Navigator by holding

00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:00.716 A:middle
the Project Navigator by holding

00:41:00.716 --> 00:41:02.566 A:middle
down Command and clicking on the

00:41:02.566 --> 00:41:03.676 A:middle
other files that I want to

00:41:03.676 --> 00:41:04.066 A:middle
select.

00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:07.216 A:middle
Then, I can drag these selected

00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:09.246 A:middle
files into the MindKit group.

00:41:10.626 --> 00:41:12.236 A:middle
When I do this, Xcode

00:41:12.346 --> 00:41:14.096 A:middle
automatically updates the target

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.626 A:middle
membership for these files.

00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:17.646 A:middle
And we can verify this by

00:41:17.646 --> 00:41:20.306 A:middle
showing the Inspector and seeing

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:21.676 A:middle
that the target membership for

00:41:21.676 --> 00:41:23.106 A:middle
the file open in the editor

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.826 A:middle
which is HealthStore.swift is

00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:26.766 A:middle
now the MindKit framework target

00:41:27.106 --> 00:41:30.566 A:middle
rather than the Mind app target.

00:41:30.936 --> 00:41:32.916 A:middle
Now, I haven't forgotten that we

00:41:32.916 --> 00:41:34.316 A:middle
still need to implement the

00:41:34.316 --> 00:41:35.716 A:middle
HealthStore that interacts with

00:41:35.716 --> 00:41:36.256 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:38.186 A:middle
We're going to do that now so

00:41:38.186 --> 00:41:39.476 A:middle
that we can start integrating

00:41:39.476 --> 00:41:40.926 A:middle
real health data into our app.

00:41:42.026 --> 00:41:43.166 A:middle
The first thing that I need to

00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:46.496 A:middle
do is import HealthKit.

00:41:46.806 --> 00:41:48.476 A:middle
Now, I've never used HealthKit

00:41:48.476 --> 00:41:48.926 A:middle
before.

00:41:49.246 --> 00:41:50.696 A:middle
So to get started, I want to

00:41:50.696 --> 00:41:52.016 A:middle
read the documentation.

00:41:52.366 --> 00:41:54.476 A:middle
I can do this right in Xcode by

00:41:54.476 --> 00:41:55.366 A:middle
opening the Developer

00:41:55.366 --> 00:41:57.126 A:middle
Documentation window which you

00:41:57.126 --> 00:41:58.526 A:middle
can find in the Help Menu.

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:02.056 A:middle
Here, you can search for a

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:02.056 A:middle
Here, you can search for a

00:42:02.056 --> 00:42:03.516 A:middle
framework from the SDK, a

00:42:03.696 --> 00:42:06.506 A:middle
specific API, or a programming

00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:08.716 A:middle
topic, such as requesting access

00:42:08.716 --> 00:42:09.376 A:middle
to health data.

00:42:10.176 --> 00:42:11.036 A:middle
So here I'll search for

00:42:11.036 --> 00:42:11.516 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:42:14.386 --> 00:42:15.826 A:middle
And now I have access to all of

00:42:15.826 --> 00:42:17.516 A:middle
the documentation for the entire

00:42:17.516 --> 00:42:17.986 A:middle
framework.

00:42:17.986 --> 00:42:19.436 A:middle
And this is also available

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:20.066 A:middle
offline.

00:42:21.026 --> 00:42:22.426 A:middle
Luckily, I have all of the code

00:42:22.426 --> 00:42:23.766 A:middle
that I need ready in a code

00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:24.036 A:middle
snippet.

00:42:24.036 --> 00:42:26.686 A:middle
And I'll add that at the end of

00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:29.046 A:middle
the file.

00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:31.006 A:middle
Now, before we start writing

00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:33.376 A:middle
unit tests, I want to add my own

00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:35.606 A:middle
documentation for the APIs in

00:42:35.606 --> 00:42:37.376 A:middle
the MindKit framework starting

00:42:37.376 --> 00:42:38.716 A:middle
with the HealthStore protocol.

00:42:39.466 --> 00:42:41.196 A:middle
I can do this using special

00:42:41.196 --> 00:42:43.206 A:middle
comments called doc comments.

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:45.736 A:middle
Xcode knows how to generate a

00:42:45.736 --> 00:42:47.016 A:middle
doc comment template for

00:42:47.016 --> 00:42:47.946 A:middle
declarations.

00:42:48.346 --> 00:42:49.696 A:middle
And this feature is available

00:42:49.696 --> 00:42:51.106 A:middle
through the Action Menu.

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:53.656 A:middle
So, I'll Command click on the

00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:54.956 A:middle
first API that I want to

00:42:54.956 --> 00:42:57.096 A:middle
document which is requestAccess.

00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:59.396 A:middle
And then I'll select Add

00:42:59.396 --> 00:43:00.226 A:middle
Documentation.

00:42:59.396 --> 00:43:00.226 A:middle
Documentation.

00:43:01.726 --> 00:43:04.106 A:middle
Now, Xcode has inserted a doc

00:43:04.106 --> 00:43:05.196 A:middle
comment template with

00:43:05.196 --> 00:43:07.466 A:middle
placeholders for the method

00:43:07.466 --> 00:43:08.786 A:middle
description as well as the

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:10.066 A:middle
description of the parameter

00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:10.996 A:middle
that it takes in.

00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:13.966 A:middle
So this method requests

00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:20.476 A:middle
permission from the user to

00:43:20.476 --> 00:43:22.706 A:middle
access mindful sessions.

00:43:22.706 --> 00:43:26.516 A:middle
And the completion parameter is

00:43:26.516 --> 00:43:27.976 A:middle
a closure to execute when the

00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:31.896 A:middle
request is done.

00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:34.076 A:middle
Now, I know that this method can

00:43:34.076 --> 00:43:35.506 A:middle
execute asynchronously.

00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:37.686 A:middle
And I want to add a special note

00:43:38.276 --> 00:43:40.006 A:middle
that-- to document that.

00:43:40.476 --> 00:43:41.886 A:middle
And I can do that using a

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:44.396 A:middle
special bullet point.

00:43:44.396 --> 00:43:50.626 A:middle
And now I can add that note.

00:43:50.946 --> 00:43:51.716 A:middle
Now that I have written the

00:43:51.716 --> 00:43:53.486 A:middle
documentation, I can view this

00:43:53.486 --> 00:43:54.116 A:middle
in Quick Help.

00:43:55.076 --> 00:43:56.616 A:middle
Again, we can bring up the Quick

00:43:56.616 --> 00:43:58.586 A:middle
Help popover by option clicking

00:43:58.916 --> 00:43:59.866 A:middle
on the symbol that we want to

00:43:59.866 --> 00:44:01.126 A:middle
view documentation for.

00:43:59.866 --> 00:44:01.126 A:middle
view documentation for.

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:02.716 A:middle
And now we can see the

00:44:02.716 --> 00:44:04.086 A:middle
description that we just wrote,

00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:06.836 A:middle
the note that we wrote as well

00:44:06.836 --> 00:44:08.086 A:middle
as the description of the

00:44:08.136 --> 00:44:08.656 A:middle
parameter.

00:44:08.886 --> 00:44:10.346 A:middle
And this is available at any

00:44:10.346 --> 00:44:11.916 A:middle
call site of request access.

00:44:18.296 --> 00:44:20.036 A:middle
For more information on writing

00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:21.766 A:middle
and documenting your own APIs,

00:44:21.966 --> 00:44:23.766 A:middle
please see the Swift API Design

00:44:23.766 --> 00:44:26.476 A:middle
Guidelines which is available on

00:44:26.476 --> 00:44:28.916 A:middle
swift.org.

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.166 A:middle
During this demo, we covered how

00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:32.936 A:middle
to use and navigate code from a

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:34.006 A:middle
Swift Package.

00:44:35.036 --> 00:44:36.866 A:middle
We talked about creating a new

00:44:36.946 --> 00:44:38.916 A:middle
framework target in our project

00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:40.546 A:middle
and moving existing code over

00:44:40.546 --> 00:44:41.516 A:middle
into that framework.

00:44:42.756 --> 00:44:44.476 A:middle
Next, we looked at the Xcode

00:44:44.476 --> 00:44:46.236 A:middle
Developer Documentation Window.

00:44:46.566 --> 00:44:48.486 A:middle
And finally, we learned how to

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:50.046 A:middle
write our own documentation

00:44:50.176 --> 00:44:52.336 A:middle
through doc comments.

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.786 A:middle
Now, I'll hand it back over to

00:44:53.786 --> 00:44:55.436 A:middle
Honza to talk about Testing and

00:44:55.436 --> 00:44:56.236 A:middle
Distribution.

00:44:56.236 --> 00:44:57.616 A:middle
[Applause]

00:44:57.616 --> 00:44:58.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Holly.

00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:01.116 A:middle
Now, in this section, we'll talk

00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:01.116 A:middle
Now, in this section, we'll talk

00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:02.936 A:middle
about how we can test our code

00:45:03.136 --> 00:45:05.106 A:middle
in Xcode, and how to distribute

00:45:05.106 --> 00:45:06.496 A:middle
our app once we're ready to

00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:06.746 A:middle
ship.

00:45:08.886 --> 00:45:10.436 A:middle
Now, since our app is coming

00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:12.126 A:middle
along pretty nicely, we need to

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:13.486 A:middle
make sure that it continues to

00:45:13.486 --> 00:45:14.286 A:middle
work properly.

00:45:14.976 --> 00:45:16.996 A:middle
A great way to increase our

00:45:16.996 --> 00:45:18.996 A:middle
confidence in the app's quality

00:45:19.206 --> 00:45:22.346 A:middle
is by using automated tests.

00:45:24.616 --> 00:45:26.316 A:middle
There are two high level

00:45:26.316 --> 00:45:28.286 A:middle
categories of tests that we will

00:45:28.286 --> 00:45:30.706 A:middle
write for our app -- unit and UI

00:45:30.706 --> 00:45:31.056 A:middle
tests.

00:45:32.836 --> 00:45:34.866 A:middle
Unit test ensure that a single

00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:36.596 A:middle
component such as our

00:45:36.596 --> 00:45:39.096 A:middle
HealthStore works properly by

00:45:39.096 --> 00:45:40.916 A:middle
giving it a specific input and

00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:42.406 A:middle
verifying that the output

00:45:42.646 --> 00:45:44.146 A:middle
matches our expectations.

00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:48.576 A:middle
UI test on the other hand ensure

00:45:48.576 --> 00:45:50.056 A:middle
that all these components are

00:45:50.056 --> 00:45:51.666 A:middle
integrated correctly and that

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.336 A:middle
the app works from the user's

00:45:53.336 --> 00:45:53.906 A:middle
perspective.

00:45:55.246 --> 00:45:57.316 A:middle
So let's dive back into Xcode.

00:46:06.456 --> 00:46:08.916 A:middle
So Holly already created the

00:46:08.996 --> 00:46:10.796 A:middle
unit test target for the MindKit

00:46:10.866 --> 00:46:12.706 A:middle
framework called MindKitTests.

00:46:13.066 --> 00:46:14.286 A:middle
But we'll still need to add it

00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:15.516 A:middle
into our test plan.

00:46:16.226 --> 00:46:18.126 A:middle
A test plan is a file-- a

00:46:18.126 --> 00:46:21.006 A:middle
repository that describes how

00:46:21.006 --> 00:46:22.936 A:middle
our tests are built and run.

00:46:23.616 --> 00:46:25.656 A:middle
A way to see which test plan our

00:46:25.656 --> 00:46:27.946 A:middle
scheme is using is to go-- to

00:46:27.996 --> 00:46:29.536 A:middle
click on the Scheme and select

00:46:29.536 --> 00:46:30.276 A:middle
Edit Scheme.

00:46:31.366 --> 00:46:33.066 A:middle
We'll switch to the Test Action,

00:46:33.506 --> 00:46:35.566 A:middle
and here we can see all the test

00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:36.656 A:middle
plans used by our scheme.

00:46:36.656 --> 00:46:37.716 A:middle
There's only one and that the

00:46:37.716 --> 00:46:38.276 A:middle
default.

00:46:38.586 --> 00:46:40.106 A:middle
So we'll jump to it by clicking

00:46:40.106 --> 00:46:41.226 A:middle
on the jump arrow next to the

00:46:41.226 --> 00:46:42.216 A:middle
test plan's name.

00:46:42.696 --> 00:46:45.636 A:middle
The Test Plan Editor shows us

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:48.316 A:middle
which test targets it's using

00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:50.236 A:middle
and we already have the UI test

00:46:50.236 --> 00:46:51.826 A:middle
target here for which we'll

00:46:51.826 --> 00:46:53.456 A:middle
write code in a minute, but

00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:54.666 A:middle
we'll still need to add the

00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:55.856 A:middle
unit's test target.

00:46:56.806 --> 00:46:58.166 A:middle
We'll do that by clicking on the

00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:01.016 A:middle
Plus button at the bottom and

00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:01.016 A:middle
Plus button at the bottom and

00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:02.396 A:middle
selecting MindKitTests.

00:47:04.316 --> 00:47:06.256 A:middle
Now, let's actually write our

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:07.116 A:middle
unit test code.

00:47:07.646 --> 00:47:11.106 A:middle
I will write some unit tests for

00:47:11.106 --> 00:47:11.986 A:middle
our HealthStore.

00:47:12.536 --> 00:47:14.116 A:middle
So what I'll do now is to

00:47:14.116 --> 00:47:15.506 A:middle
Control click on the

00:47:15.506 --> 00:47:17.876 A:middle
MindKitTests group and select

00:47:18.046 --> 00:47:18.606 A:middle
New File.

00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:21.986 A:middle
I will use the Unit Test file

00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:25.786 A:middle
template and we'll name the file

00:47:26.466 --> 00:47:28.716 A:middle
Test HealthStore.

00:47:30.896 --> 00:47:31.876 A:middle
That looks good.

00:47:33.356 --> 00:47:35.346 A:middle
The first thing we'll do here is

00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:37.106 A:middle
import MindKit because that is

00:47:37.106 --> 00:47:38.186 A:middle
where the code lives now.

00:47:42.656 --> 00:47:45.126 A:middle
And to be able to test not only

00:47:45.276 --> 00:47:46.666 A:middle
public but also internal

00:47:46.666 --> 00:47:48.026 A:middle
interfaces of the MindKit

00:47:48.026 --> 00:47:50.066 A:middle
framework, we'll add the

00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:53.016 A:middle
testable keyword to the import.

00:47:54.016 --> 00:47:59.066 A:middle
Next, I'll add two tests to our

00:47:59.066 --> 00:47:59.866 A:middle
class.

00:48:00.296 --> 00:48:02.536 A:middle
The first one verifies that

00:48:02.536 --> 00:48:04.436 A:middle
after we saved a meditation, we

00:48:04.436 --> 00:48:05.696 A:middle
can retrieve it right back.

00:48:06.776 --> 00:48:08.056 A:middle
And the second one ensures that

00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:09.676 A:middle
we can actually request access

00:48:09.936 --> 00:48:11.946 A:middle
to read and write data.

00:48:12.896 --> 00:48:15.126 A:middle
So I'll run these tests by going

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:16.626 A:middle
to Product, Test.

00:48:17.216 --> 00:48:20.436 A:middle
Now, these tests are being built

00:48:20.706 --> 00:48:22.896 A:middle
for the simulator and run on the

00:48:22.896 --> 00:48:24.336 A:middle
iPhone XR simulator.

00:48:35.196 --> 00:48:36.746 A:middle
Now that the tests are finished,

00:48:36.946 --> 00:48:39.806 A:middle
we can actually see next to the

00:48:39.806 --> 00:48:41.866 A:middle
test name in the Source Editor

00:48:41.866 --> 00:48:43.686 A:middle
diamonds that both of them

00:48:43.866 --> 00:48:44.516 A:middle
succeeded.

00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:48.106 A:middle
Good. Now, we can also see the

00:48:48.106 --> 00:48:50.636 A:middle
test hierarchy in the Test

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:51.406 A:middle
Navigator.

00:48:52.176 --> 00:48:54.566 A:middle
So we added a few unit tests for

00:48:54.566 --> 00:48:55.666 A:middle
our HealthStore but we want to

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.336 A:middle
make sure that the UI of our app

00:48:57.336 --> 00:48:58.366 A:middle
works as well.

00:48:58.806 --> 00:49:00.096 A:middle
So we'll add some code to our UI

00:48:58.806 --> 00:49:00.096 A:middle
So we'll add some code to our UI

00:49:00.096 --> 00:49:00.626 A:middle
test.

00:49:01.726 --> 00:49:03.106 A:middle
I'll jump to the existing

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.356 A:middle
MindUITests class by selecting

00:49:05.356 --> 00:49:06.676 A:middle
it in the Test Navigator.

00:49:07.536 --> 00:49:10.336 A:middle
And here, we will add UI test

00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:13.626 A:middle
code that launches our app,

00:49:14.546 --> 00:49:16.776 A:middle
starts a new meditation, a few

00:49:16.776 --> 00:49:18.786 A:middle
seconds later, it pauses the

00:49:18.786 --> 00:49:21.246 A:middle
meditation, and then finally, it

00:49:21.246 --> 00:49:23.456 A:middle
verifies the remaining time

00:49:23.456 --> 00:49:25.266 A:middle
label, shows what we expect.

00:49:26.856 --> 00:49:28.686 A:middle
So I will run our test again.

00:49:29.226 --> 00:49:31.266 A:middle
And this time, I'll bring the

00:49:31.266 --> 00:49:32.476 A:middle
simulator to the foreground so

00:49:32.476 --> 00:49:34.606 A:middle
that we can watch the UI test

00:49:34.606 --> 00:49:35.016 A:middle
run.

00:49:36.066 --> 00:49:38.236 A:middle
So the app is launched and new

00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:39.286 A:middle
meditation has started.

00:49:39.286 --> 00:49:40.876 A:middle
And a few seconds later, it gets

00:49:40.956 --> 00:49:42.046 A:middle
paused and the app gets

00:49:42.046 --> 00:49:42.656 A:middle
terminated.

00:49:43.186 --> 00:49:44.996 A:middle
Next, we can also see the unit

00:49:45.116 --> 00:49:46.616 A:middle
test launched the app for a

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.066 A:middle
moment.

00:49:48.326 --> 00:49:49.696 A:middle
Now, it seems that some of our

00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:50.436 A:middle
tests failed.

00:49:50.436 --> 00:49:51.616 A:middle
And to figure out what exactly

00:49:51.616 --> 00:49:53.536 A:middle
happened, we'll go to the Report

00:49:53.536 --> 00:49:55.076 A:middle
Navigator by clicking on the

00:49:55.076 --> 00:49:56.746 A:middle
right most Navigator button.

00:49:57.816 --> 00:49:59.816 A:middle
Here, I'll select the top which

00:49:59.816 --> 00:50:01.516 A:middle
is the most recent test action

00:49:59.816 --> 00:50:01.516 A:middle
is the most recent test action

00:50:02.576 --> 00:50:04.716 A:middle
and we get to the test reports.

00:50:05.456 --> 00:50:07.076 A:middle
Here, I can see that the new UI

00:50:07.076 --> 00:50:08.606 A:middle
test I just added is marked in

00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:10.286 A:middle
red which means that it failed.

00:50:10.876 --> 00:50:11.976 A:middle
And to know what exactly

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:13.846 A:middle
happened, I will disclose the

00:50:13.846 --> 00:50:16.286 A:middle
test and drill into the failing

00:50:16.286 --> 00:50:18.406 A:middle
activities to see that the

00:50:18.406 --> 00:50:19.736 A:middle
search in failure says that

00:50:19.826 --> 00:50:22.486 A:middle
02:56 is not equal to 2:56.

00:50:23.376 --> 00:50:24.416 A:middle
Now, this is starting to make

00:50:24.526 --> 00:50:24.986 A:middle
sense.

00:50:25.246 --> 00:50:27.026 A:middle
But to really understand what

00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:28.726 A:middle
was on screen when the failure

00:50:28.726 --> 00:50:30.586 A:middle
occurred, I can disclose the

00:50:30.646 --> 00:50:32.316 A:middle
failure itself to reveal an

00:50:32.316 --> 00:50:34.346 A:middle
automatic screenshot which I can

00:50:34.396 --> 00:50:36.076 A:middle
preview the click icon.

00:50:36.746 --> 00:50:38.356 A:middle
And here, I can clearly see that

00:50:38.356 --> 00:50:41.026 A:middle
the remaining timer label shows

00:50:41.286 --> 00:50:43.776 A:middle
02:56 but our test assertion at

00:50:43.776 --> 00:50:44.606 A:middle
2:56.

00:50:45.916 --> 00:50:47.686 A:middle
So I'll close the preview and

00:50:47.686 --> 00:50:49.066 A:middle
we'll jump back to the test

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:50.426 A:middle
source by clicking on the jump

00:50:50.426 --> 00:50:52.006 A:middle
arrow next to the test name.

00:50:53.346 --> 00:50:54.796 A:middle
And here, we'll fix the

00:50:54.796 --> 00:50:56.526 A:middle
assertion by adding, deleting

00:50:56.526 --> 00:50:56.946 A:middle
zero.

00:50:58.126 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
Now, I'll rerun just this one

00:50:58.126 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
Now, I'll rerun just this one

00:51:00.476 --> 00:51:02.536 A:middle
test by clicking on the test

00:51:02.536 --> 00:51:04.526 A:middle
diamond next to the test name.

00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:08.716 A:middle
And again, we can see the app

00:51:08.976 --> 00:51:10.856 A:middle
being launched and new

00:51:11.006 --> 00:51:13.256 A:middle
meditation starts, few seconds

00:51:13.256 --> 00:51:14.616 A:middle
later it gets pause, the app

00:51:14.736 --> 00:51:16.796 A:middle
gets executed, and this time--

00:51:17.376 --> 00:51:19.206 A:middle
terminated, sorry, and this

00:51:19.206 --> 00:51:20.726 A:middle
time, we can actually see with

00:51:20.726 --> 00:51:22.346 A:middle
the test diamond that the test

00:51:22.596 --> 00:51:23.086 A:middle
succeeded.

00:51:23.356 --> 00:51:23.796 A:middle
That's great.

00:51:24.516 --> 00:51:29.536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:51:30.036 --> 00:51:31.286 A:middle
Finally, now that we have a

00:51:31.396 --> 00:51:33.996 A:middle
functional app, we would like to

00:51:33.996 --> 00:51:35.066 A:middle
make it available to more

00:51:35.066 --> 00:51:35.636 A:middle
people.

00:51:37.736 --> 00:51:40.046 A:middle
To build an app for distribution

00:51:40.326 --> 00:51:42.306 A:middle
on the App Store or TestFlight,

00:51:42.306 --> 00:51:43.666 A:middle
which is Apple's beta testing

00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:45.396 A:middle
service, we need to perform an

00:51:45.476 --> 00:51:46.056 A:middle
archive.

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.716 A:middle
To do that, we first select the

00:51:49.716 --> 00:51:51.536 A:middle
generic iOS device run

00:51:51.536 --> 00:51:53.506 A:middle
destination, and then select

00:51:53.696 --> 00:51:55.096 A:middle
Product Archive.

00:51:55.666 --> 00:51:57.186 A:middle
And this builds the app in the

00:51:57.186 --> 00:51:58.906 A:middle
release configuration and

00:51:58.906 --> 00:52:00.836 A:middle
produces an archive that we can

00:51:58.906 --> 00:52:00.836 A:middle
produces an archive that we can

00:52:00.836 --> 00:52:04.186 A:middle
use to distribute our app.

00:52:04.466 --> 00:52:06.106 A:middle
When it finishes, it opens the

00:52:06.106 --> 00:52:07.946 A:middle
organizer automatically, and

00:52:07.946 --> 00:52:09.026 A:middle
here, when we select the

00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:11.456 A:middle
archive, we can click Distribute

00:52:12.016 --> 00:52:12.216 A:middle
App.

00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:13.366 A:middle
And we would go through this

00:52:13.436 --> 00:52:15.946 A:middle
flow to submit our app directly

00:52:15.946 --> 00:52:18.046 A:middle
to Apple from Xcode.

00:52:21.836 --> 00:52:24.046 A:middle
Please note that to deploy apps

00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:25.656 A:middle
to TestFlight or the App Store,

00:52:25.956 --> 00:52:26.936 A:middle
you'll need to register

00:52:26.936 --> 00:52:28.676 A:middle
developer account associated

00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:29.826 A:middle
with your Apple ID.

00:52:35.756 --> 00:52:38.476 A:middle
Once your app has been uploaded,

00:52:39.466 --> 00:52:41.026 A:middle
you can manage it using the App

00:52:41.026 --> 00:52:42.196 A:middle
Store Connect website.

00:52:42.706 --> 00:52:44.256 A:middle
And this way, you can ask your

00:52:44.386 --> 00:52:46.146 A:middle
friends and family or your

00:52:46.146 --> 00:52:47.936 A:middle
colleagues to download your app

00:52:47.936 --> 00:52:49.346 A:middle
using TestFlight and eventually

00:52:49.346 --> 00:52:50.966 A:middle
getting listed-- get it listed

00:52:51.156 --> 00:52:53.836 A:middle
on the App Store as well.

00:52:54.046 --> 00:52:56.246 A:middle
So in this demo, we started by

00:52:56.246 --> 00:52:58.196 A:middle
creating unit and UI tests for

00:52:58.196 --> 00:52:59.156 A:middle
our app.

00:52:59.156 --> 00:53:01.086 A:middle
And then we learned how to edit

00:52:59.156 --> 00:53:01.086 A:middle
And then we learned how to edit

00:53:01.086 --> 00:53:03.716 A:middle
our test plan and how to use the

00:53:03.716 --> 00:53:06.186 A:middle
Test Report to diagnose a test

00:53:06.186 --> 00:53:06.506 A:middle
failure.

00:53:07.296 --> 00:53:08.686 A:middle
Then we built an archive and

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:09.656 A:middle
discussed how to use the

00:53:09.656 --> 00:53:12.416 A:middle
organizer to upload our app to

00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:15.436 A:middle
TestFlight or the App Store.

00:53:15.656 --> 00:53:16.476 A:middle
To learn more about these

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.836 A:middle
topics, please refer to these

00:53:17.866 --> 00:53:18.346 A:middle
talks.

00:53:19.486 --> 00:53:21.456 A:middle
And now, let's recap what we saw

00:53:21.456 --> 00:53:22.656 A:middle
in the last hour.

00:53:23.596 --> 00:53:24.916 A:middle
Today, we went through the whole

00:53:24.916 --> 00:53:26.616 A:middle
journey of creating an app from

00:53:26.616 --> 00:53:27.136 A:middle
scratch.

00:53:28.396 --> 00:53:30.296 A:middle
Prachi created our project and

00:53:30.296 --> 00:53:31.506 A:middle
introduced the Xcode UI.

00:53:32.706 --> 00:53:34.666 A:middle
Then Holly added codes to our

00:53:34.666 --> 00:53:36.226 A:middle
app using the Source Editor

00:53:36.226 --> 00:53:37.656 A:middle
features to make that process

00:53:37.656 --> 00:53:38.906 A:middle
really smooth and fun.

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.136 A:middle
Then I came up to discuss

00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:42.976 A:middle
running and debugging on the

00:53:42.976 --> 00:53:45.396 A:middle
simulator and device, and we

00:53:45.396 --> 00:53:46.666 A:middle
added a Swift Package to our

00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:47.146 A:middle
project.

00:53:48.186 --> 00:53:49.986 A:middle
Then Holly came up and

00:53:49.986 --> 00:53:51.796 A:middle
integrated the Swift Package and

00:53:51.796 --> 00:53:53.256 A:middle
split some of our code into a

00:53:53.256 --> 00:53:53.816 A:middle
framework.

00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:56.536 A:middle
And finally, we just learned how

00:53:56.536 --> 00:53:57.826 A:middle
to use the testing integration

00:53:57.826 --> 00:53:59.716 A:middle
in Xcode and how to distribute

00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:01.986 A:middle
our app to the App Store or

00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:01.986 A:middle
our app to the App Store or

00:54:01.986 --> 00:54:02.366 A:middle
TestFlight.

00:54:04.536 --> 00:54:06.006 A:middle
For more information about the

00:54:06.006 --> 00:54:07.446 A:middle
session, please refer to this

link.

00:54:08.076 --> 00:54:09.396 A:middle
And if you have any questions,

00:54:09.576 --> 00:54:11.096 A:middle
there's a lab starting right

00:54:11.096 --> 00:54:12.296 A:middle
after this session ends.

00:54:13.926 --> 00:54:14.616 A:middle
And have a great week.

00:54:14.616 --> 00:54:15.436 A:middle
Thank you very much.
