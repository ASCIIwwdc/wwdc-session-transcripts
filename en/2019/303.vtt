employees, as well as other

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:10.476 A:middle
companies.

00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:12.596 A:middle
And this fall, we're bringing

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:16.416 A:middle
custom apps to ASM, as well.

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:17.856 A:middle
Speaking -- yes, thank you.

00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:20.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:22.616 A:middle
And speaking of accounts,

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:24.066 A:middle
earlier this spring, we added

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.576 A:middle
Federated authentication with

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.536 A:middle
Microsoft Azure Active Directory

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.756 A:middle
to ASM, and this fall, we're

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:31.456 A:middle
bringing that feature to ABM.

00:05:32.146 --> 00:05:32.746 A:middle
I am -- okay.

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:34.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:35.546 A:middle
I love you guys.

00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
This is a great audience.

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.356 A:middle
I'm also very pleased to

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:40.896 A:middle
announce that as of this week,

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:43.296 A:middle
both ABM and ASM are now fully

00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:45.156 A:middle
supported on iPad on the

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:45.976 A:middle
shipping iOS.

00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:48.546 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheers ]

00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:50.026 A:middle
We love iPad, too.

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:52.956 A:middle
Again, making sure that you can

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:55.656 A:middle
use these services and apps on

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:56.876 A:middle
all of our platforms.

00:05:57.976 --> 00:05:59.566 A:middle
In fact, ABM and ASM have been

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:01.336 A:middle
so successful that we are ending

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:01.336 A:middle
so successful that we are ending

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:02.696 A:middle
support for their predecessor,

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.026 A:middle
Apple Deployment Programs, at

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
the end of this year.

00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:06.856 A:middle
It's time to get on board with

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:07.496 A:middle
ABM and ASM.

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.126 A:middle
Because, in fact, you're getting

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:12.976 A:middle
even more benefits now with the

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:14.646 A:middle
same Managed Apple ID you use to

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:16.816 A:middle
sign in to ABM and ASM, you get

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.506 A:middle
access to the AppleSeed for IT,

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.366 A:middle
so that you can get all of the

00:06:20.366 --> 00:06:21.986 A:middle
new beta software releases, like

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:23.376 A:middle
everything we seeded this week,

00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:25.446 A:middle
including documentation and test

00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:26.916 A:middle
plans, to help you ensure that

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:28.626 A:middle
those new software releases will

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.496 A:middle
work well in your organization,

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.536 A:middle
and when you find some things

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.396 A:middle
you don't particularly like, use

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:35.676 A:middle
Feedback Assistant built into

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:38.256 A:middle
all of our OSs now to file

00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:39.836 A:middle
suggestions to us, so that we

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:41.436 A:middle
can associate those with your

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:43.076 A:middle
organization and more accurately

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:44.126 A:middle
track them in engineering.

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:47.556 A:middle
That concludes our update on ABM

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:49.246 A:middle
and ASM, and now I'd like to

00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:50.766 A:middle
turn to another great example of

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.336 A:middle
how we provide you with the same

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.706 A:middle
tools on every platform and

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:54.776 A:middle
allow you to choose the best

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:55.626 A:middle
devices for you.

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.026 A:middle
And that's Classroom.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:00.786 A:middle
In March, we released the latest

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:00.786 A:middle
In March, we released the latest

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.106 A:middle
update to Classroom for iPad and

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.446 A:middle
Mac, but now it enables teachers

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:06.876 A:middle
to manage student Macs with the

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:08.206 A:middle
same great feature set that

00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:09.536 A:middle
they've grown to love while

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:10.836 A:middle
managing student iPads.

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.826 A:middle
On the left, you can see that

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.076 A:middle
students can manage their

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.496 A:middle
classes with a new classroom

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:17.336 A:middle
pane in system preferences, just

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.546 A:middle
like they do in settings on

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:19.486 A:middle
iPad.

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.986 A:middle
And we also brought all of the

00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:23.716 A:middle
settings that configure certain

00:07:23.716 --> 00:07:25.306 A:middle
classroom behaviors that you

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:27.346 A:middle
have on iOS back to macOS,

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.986 A:middle
including the ones that control

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:31.566 A:middle
Classroom's Screensview feature.

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:33.476 A:middle
But we didn't stop there.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:34.956 A:middle
We also made all of the other

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.356 A:middle
screen viewing features that you

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.096 A:middle
know and love in macOS from

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:39.916 A:middle
screen sharing, screenshot, and

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.936 A:middle
Apple Note desktop respect those

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.446 A:middle
restrictions, as well.

00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:46.656 A:middle
Earlier this week, we seeded our

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:48.476 A:middle
fall release of Classroom, which

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:49.836 A:middle
of course, support Dark Mode on

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:50.876 A:middle
iOS 13.

00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:53.526 A:middle
And we've and a great new

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:54.886 A:middle
feature that will help teachers

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:56.866 A:middle
regain student attention without

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:58.956 A:middle
needing to lock the device, we

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.556 A:middle
call it Hide Apps, and it works

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.556 A:middle
call it Hide Apps, and it works

00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:00.796 A:middle
like this.

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:03.046 A:middle
When the teacher taps the new

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.776 A:middle
Hide button in the toolbar, the

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:05.886 A:middle
student is returned to home

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.666 A:middle
screen on their iPad.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.326 A:middle
That concludes our Classroom

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:10.826 A:middle
update.

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:12.066 A:middle
Now I'd like to turn to a couple

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:12.956 A:middle
of other announcements that

00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:14.166 A:middle
impact device management.

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:17.166 A:middle
We all saw on Monday the

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:18.456 A:middle
announcement of desktop-class

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:19.536 A:middle
browsing on iPad.

00:08:20.356 --> 00:08:22.206 A:middle
This may impact your MDM product

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:24.146 A:middle
if you are using the UserAgent

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:25.336 A:middle
string to distinguish between

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:28.056 A:middle
iPad and Mac to customize your

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:29.306 A:middle
UI or your enrollment flow.

00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:30.516 A:middle
You're going to need to stop

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:32.535 A:middle
doing that, because iPad now

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:33.366 A:middle
identifies as Mac.

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:36.126 A:middle
For more about this great new

00:08:36.126 --> 00:08:37.686 A:middle
feature for iPad, check out the

00:08:37.686 --> 00:08:40.916 A:middle
session from earlier this week.

00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:42.446 A:middle
We've also brought a number of

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.056 A:middle
great device management features

00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:47.086 A:middle
custom to on iOS and macOS to

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:50.296 A:middle
AppleTV, we now allow

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.676 A:middle
organizations to control when

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:53.586 A:middle
software updates appear in the

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.666 A:middle
tvOS UI and allow you to

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:57.376 A:middle
configure date and time

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:58.086 A:middle
automatically.

00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:00.246 A:middle
Hopefully, you're all using

00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:00.246 A:middle
Hopefully, you're all using

00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:01.256 A:middle
content caching in your

00:09:01.256 --> 00:09:02.996 A:middle
organization, and now tvOS

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.716 A:middle
screensavers are also cashed,

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.256 A:middle
saving you a lot of bandwidth.

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
That concludes our first section

00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:12.776 A:middle
of content, and now I'd like to

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:14.426 A:middle
turn to some features that help

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:15.686 A:middle
us strike that right balance

00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:18.026 A:middle
between security, privacy, and

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:18.756 A:middle
manageability.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:21.636 A:middle
And the first one is a really

00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:23.496 A:middle
big deal that Craig highlighted

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.026 A:middle
in the keynote on Monday, I'd

00:09:25.096 --> 00:09:26.396 A:middle
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:27.876 A:middle
on stage and tell you all about

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:28.626 A:middle
user enrollment.

[ Applause ]

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:36.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Bob Whiteman, Senior

00:09:36.536 --> 00:09:39.186 A:middle
Device Management Engineer at

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:39.856 A:middle
Apple.

00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:41.226 A:middle
Until now, there have been two

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:42.806 A:middle
ways to manage iOS devices.

00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:44.856 A:middle
Device enrollments provide many

00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:45.836 A:middle
device-wide management

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:47.656 A:middle
capabilities, and for

00:09:47.656 --> 00:09:49.046 A:middle
institutionally owned devices

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.756 A:middle
that are supervised, automated

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.706 A:middle
device enrollment provides all

00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:53.526 A:middle
of the device management

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.596 A:middle
capabilities as well as

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:56.686 A:middle
automated set up.

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:59.096 A:middle
When users bring their personal

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:01.066 A:middle
devices to work or school, they

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:01.066 A:middle
devices to work or school, they

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.756 A:middle
don't really want the admin to

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:04.736 A:middle
manage the entire device, and

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.386 A:middle
BYOD admins don't really want to

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:07.836 A:middle
manage the entire device either.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:09.146 A:middle
They just want to provide the

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:11.066 A:middle
apps, data, and configuration

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:12.656 A:middle
that users need in order to be

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:13.216 A:middle
productive.

00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:15.606 A:middle
Today, I'm presenting a new way

00:10:15.606 --> 00:10:17.556 A:middle
to manage BYOD devices called

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:18.656 A:middle
User Enrollments.

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:23.306 A:middle
This is a new MDM enrollment

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:25.346 A:middle
option that provides a better

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:26.476 A:middle
balance for BYOD.

00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:28.236 A:middle
It protects the privacy of

00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:29.786 A:middle
personal data, while still

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:31.056 A:middle
securing corporate data.

00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:33.716 A:middle
When users and admins achieve

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.126 A:middle
this better balance, there is

00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.896 A:middle
greater acceptance of BYOD

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:38.936 A:middle
programs, and more productive

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:39.436 A:middle
users.

00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:40.946 A:middle
Everyone wins.

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.096 A:middle
User enrollments are built on

00:10:43.096 --> 00:10:43.956 A:middle
three pillars.

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:46.036 A:middle
The first is a Managed Apple ID,

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.796 A:middle
alongside the Personal Apple ID.

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:50.076 A:middle
The second is cryptographic

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:52.676 A:middle
separation of personal and work

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.866 A:middle
data, and the third is a limited

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:56.546 A:middle
set of device-wide management

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:57.356 A:middle
capabilities.

00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:01.586 A:middle
A Managed Apple ID is required

00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:01.586 A:middle
A Managed Apple ID is required

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:02.586 A:middle
for user enrollment.

00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.256 A:middle
This is the anchor for the

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.246 A:middle
user's work identity on the

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
device.

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:08.626 A:middle
Now this is not a multiuser

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.056 A:middle
system.

00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:10.736 A:middle
It's a multi- persona system.

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:12.256 A:middle
It's the same user wearing

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.106 A:middle
different hats.

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:15.756 A:middle
The admin creates the Managed

00:11:15.756 --> 00:11:17.746 A:middle
Apple ID in Apple School Manager

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:19.136 A:middle
or Apple Business Manager, and

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:21.096 A:middle
the user must sign into the

00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:22.646 A:middle
Managed Apple ID during the

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:23.886 A:middle
enrollment process.

00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:26.416 A:middle
Federated off means that this

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:27.816 A:middle
works very well for the user,

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:28.886 A:middle
since they are challenged for

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:29.936 A:middle
credentials that they already

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.296 A:middle
know from the organization.

00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:33.436 A:middle
And when the enrollment ends,

00:11:33.686 --> 00:11:35.656 A:middle
the Managed Apple ID is removed

00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:38.376 A:middle
from the device.

00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.386 A:middle
Managed Apps and Accounts use

00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:41.896 A:middle
the Managed Apple ID's iCloud

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.206 A:middle
account and Personal Apps and

00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:45.886 A:middle
Accounts use the personal Apple

00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
ID's iCloud account, if there is

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:48.236 A:middle
one signed in.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:50.866 A:middle
Third-party apps are always

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:52.496 A:middle
entirely either managed or

00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:53.106 A:middle
unmanaged.

00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:54.476 A:middle
They can't change mode, and you

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:56.056 A:middle
can't run them in both modes at

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:56.706 A:middle
the same time.

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.426 A:middle
Some of the built-in apps like

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.576 A:middle
Notes, our account based, which

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.576 A:middle
Notes, our account based, which

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:02.686 A:middle
means they can handle both

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.456 A:middle
managed accounts and unmanaged

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:06.056 A:middle
accounts, and these apps will

00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:07.646 A:middle
use the appropriate Apple ID,

00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:08.846 A:middle
depending on which account they

00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:11.986 A:middle
are operating on at the time.

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:13.416 A:middle
The next pillar is data

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:14.026 A:middle
separation.

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:16.476 A:middle
When the enrollment starts, iOS

00:12:16.656 --> 00:12:18.906 A:middle
creates a managed APFS volume,

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:20.106 A:middle
and it uses separate

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.506 A:middle
cryptographic keys for this.

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.906 A:middle
When enrollment ends, iOS

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:25.476 A:middle
destroys the cryptographic keys

00:12:25.556 --> 00:12:26.366 A:middle
and the volume.

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:27.656 A:middle
So, the data is gone.

00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:29.596 A:middle
Now it's always been the case

00:12:29.596 --> 00:12:31.286 A:middle
that iOS removes managed data

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:32.256 A:middle
when enrollment ends

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:32.986 A:middle
appropriately.

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:34.916 A:middle
So, this is a cryptographic

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.196 A:middle
backstop to make sure that the

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:38.106 A:middle
data is provably gone, just in

00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:39.226 A:middle
case something goes wrong during

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.386 A:middle
the unenrollment process.

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:43.956 A:middle
The managed APFS volume contains

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:45.686 A:middle
the managed versions of all of

00:12:45.686 --> 00:12:46.416 A:middle
these items.

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:48.856 A:middle
App containers are any local

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.776 A:middle
data stored by third-party apps.

00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:53.636 A:middle
The Notes app stores local data

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.436 A:middle
for managed Notes accounts on

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:57.616 A:middle
the managed APFS volume and for

00:12:57.616 --> 00:12:59.336 A:middle
personal notes accounts on the

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.656 A:middle
personal or system APFS volume.

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.656 A:middle
personal or system APFS volume.

00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:05.166 A:middle
When iOS creates this managed

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.476 A:middle
APFS volume, it also creates a

00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:08.476 A:middle
managed keychain.

00:13:09.016 --> 00:13:10.936 A:middle
This stores any secure items

00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:12.536 A:middle
that are saved by third-party

00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:13.806 A:middle
apps like passwords and

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:15.986 A:middle
certificates, and it also stores

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.566 A:middle
the authentication credentials

00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:19.306 A:middle
for managed accounts.

00:13:20.456 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
Mail attachments and full email

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.156 A:middle
bodies are stored on the managed

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:27.326 A:middle
APFS partition, although there

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:28.876 A:middle
is a central database for mail

00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.206 A:middle
that lives on the system

00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:31.606 A:middle
partition that contains some

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:33.616 A:middle
metadata and five-line previews.

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:35.216 A:middle
Rest assured, this data is

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:36.436 A:middle
removed when the enrollment

00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:36.846 A:middle
ends.

00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:42.526 A:middle
Once the data is separated, the

00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:44.606 A:middle
management of this data must be

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:45.606 A:middle
separated, as well.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.396 A:middle
User enrollments have a few

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:49.026 A:middle
limited capabilities for

00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:50.516 A:middle
managing the entire device, but

00:13:50.516 --> 00:13:52.016 A:middle
they have no capabilities for

00:13:52.016 --> 00:13:53.726 A:middle
managing personal apps and data.

00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:56.736 A:middle
User enrollment management is

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.726 A:middle
based upon a modified version of

00:13:58.726 --> 00:13:59.916 A:middle
the MDM protocol.

00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.786 A:middle
And it starts the same way as

00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.786 A:middle
And it starts the same way as

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:03.956 A:middle
device enrollments, with the

00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:05.486 A:middle
enrollment profile.

00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:10.866 A:middle
The Managed Apple ID key is what

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:12.326 A:middle
signifies this as a user

00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:12.856 A:middle
enrollment.

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.396 A:middle
And the value of this is the

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.026 A:middle
user name of the managed Apple

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.796 A:middle
ID that the user must sign into.

00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:20.516 A:middle
There's also a payload

00:14:20.516 --> 00:14:21.606 A:middle
organization key.

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:22.846 A:middle
This is an existing key for

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:24.166 A:middle
device enrollments, but becomes

00:14:24.316 --> 00:14:26.006 A:middle
particularly useful for user

00:14:26.006 --> 00:14:26.896 A:middle
enrollments, because this

00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:28.556 A:middle
identifies the managed accounts

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:29.216 A:middle
on the device.

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:31.576 A:middle
It will appear in Settings and

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:32.656 A:middle
in the Notes app and some other

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:33.196 A:middle
places.

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.286 A:middle
And also note that there's no

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:36.776 A:middle
access rights key here.

00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:38.856 A:middle
Device enrollments use access

00:14:38.856 --> 00:14:39.926 A:middle
rights to gate certain

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:41.846 A:middle
management capabilities for

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.206 A:middle
device enrollments, but these

00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:44.456 A:middle
simply don't apply to the user

00:14:44.456 --> 00:14:44.876 A:middle
enrollments.

00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:45.936 A:middle
So, they're not specified.

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:49.806 A:middle
There's more differences between

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:50.996 A:middle
the device enrollment protocol

00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:52.236 A:middle
and the user enrollment protocol

00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:52.946 A:middle
than I go to can go through

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:54.086 A:middle
here, but I will cover the most

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:54.816 A:middle
important points.

00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:57.426 A:middle
First of all, profile service

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.186 A:middle
profiles and user enrollments do

00:14:59.186 --> 00:14:59.766 A:middle
not mix.

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:01.456 A:middle
You cannot use them to enroll,

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:01.456 A:middle
You cannot use them to enroll,

00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:03.016 A:middle
and you can install one via a

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:03.806 A:middle
user enrollment.

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:07.536 A:middle
Device enrollments use the UDID

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:09.096 A:middle
as the primary identifier of the

00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:10.526 A:middle
device that is communicating.

00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:13.706 A:middle
User enrollments do not provide

00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.476 A:middle
UDID or any other persistent

00:15:15.506 --> 00:15:17.086 A:middle
identifier to the MDM server.

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:18.586 A:middle
This includes serial number,

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:20.536 A:middle
IMEI, MEID.

00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:22.976 A:middle
Instead, when enrollment starts,

00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:25.216 A:middle
iOS creates and enrollment ID,

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:27.136 A:middle
and this is communicated to the

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.916 A:middle
MDM server in all MDM

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:29.736 A:middle
communications.

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.656 A:middle
The MDM server can use this as

00:15:32.656 --> 00:15:34.096 A:middle
its primary identifier for the

00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:34.616 A:middle
enrollment.

00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:37.026 A:middle
And when the enrollment ends,

00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:39.616 A:middle
iOS destroys this enrollment ID.

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:40.886 A:middle
So, if the same device enrolls

00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:42.506 A:middle
again, it will get a different

00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:43.466 A:middle
enrollment ID.

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:45.756 A:middle
There's something similar for

00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:46.466 A:middle
ActiveSync.

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:49.746 A:middle
When a user enrollment installs

00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:51.496 A:middle
an exchange account, that goes

00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:53.016 A:middle
into a user enrollment mode.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:57.676 A:middle
It uses a EAS device identifier

00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:59.136 A:middle
that was generated at the start

00:15:59.136 --> 00:15:59.986 A:middle
of the enrollment, and it

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:01.616 A:middle
communicates it both to the

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:01.616 A:middle
communicates it both to the

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:03.426 A:middle
exchange server and to the MDM

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:04.946 A:middle
server in the device information

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.096 A:middle
query, so, they can use that to

00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:07.416 A:middle
correlate as they usually do.

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:09.266 A:middle
And again, this is destroyed

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:10.316 A:middle
when the enrollment ends.

00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:13.906 A:middle
And the token update command

00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:15.876 A:middle
does not include the unlock

00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:16.326 A:middle
token.

00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:17.916 A:middle
This means that the MDM server

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:19.236 A:middle
cannot clear the device

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:19.826 A:middle
passcode.

00:16:22.726 --> 00:16:24.436 A:middle
One of the top reasons why users

00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:26.826 A:middle
reject BYOD programs is because

00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:27.776 A:middle
they are concerned that the

00:16:27.776 --> 00:16:29.486 A:middle
admin may erase the entire

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:30.616 A:middle
device, and they will lose their

00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:31.836 A:middle
personal data on their own

00:16:31.836 --> 00:16:32.296 A:middle
device.

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:34.016 A:middle
User enrollments do not the

00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:35.706 A:middle
support Erase Device command.

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:40.586 --> 00:16:42.586 A:middle
And there's a similar thing for

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:43.306 A:middle
ActiveSync.

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:45.316 A:middle
If the exchange account is in

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:46.746 A:middle
user enrollment mode, the

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:48.236 A:middle
exchange server cannot send the

00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:49.226 A:middle
RemoteWipe command.

00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:51.796 A:middle
Instead, the MDM server can end

00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:54.046 A:middle
the enrollment, and the exchange

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.636 A:middle
server can send the Account-only

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:57.276 A:middle
RemoteWipe, which only remove

00:16:57.276 --> 00:16:59.186 A:middle
managed data in leave personal

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.176 A:middle
data untouched.

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.176 A:middle
data untouched.

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:03.836 A:middle
Some queries will only return

00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:05.296 A:middle
the managed results.

00:17:05.366 --> 00:17:07.016 A:middle
So, for instance, the MDM server

00:17:07.016 --> 00:17:08.646 A:middle
cannot find out what personal

00:17:08.816 --> 00:17:09.786 A:middle
apps are installed on the

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:10.256 A:middle
device.

00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:12.266 A:middle
This is one place where we've

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:13.665 A:middle
added a new feature for device

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:14.256 A:middle
enrollments.

00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:16.486 A:middle
They have a new managed-only key

00:17:16.816 --> 00:17:18.346 A:middle
that filters the results in the

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.596 A:middle
same way.

00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:24.516 A:middle
When installing applications,

00:17:24.656 --> 00:17:26.165 A:middle
user enrollments cannot take

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.935 A:middle
over or abandon management of an

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:28.026 A:middle
app.

00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:30.496 A:middle
The app is always removed when

00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:31.386 A:middle
the enrollment ends.

00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:33.026 A:middle
User enrollments support

00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:35.706 A:middle
enterprise app distribution, and

00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:36.926 A:middle
user-based VPP with

00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:37.986 A:middle
PurchaseMethod 1.

00:17:38.386 --> 00:17:40.056 A:middle
This ensures that the purchase

00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:41.616 A:middle
goes on the managed Apple ID,

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:43.986 A:middle
not the personal Apple ID.

00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:48.696 A:middle
For VPN, user enrollments

00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:50.206 A:middle
support the Per-app VPN, and

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:51.496 A:middle
we've expanded it with some new

00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:51.986 A:middle
keys.

00:17:52.596 --> 00:17:54.726 A:middle
These keys help guide the

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:56.006 A:middle
traffic for the related

00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:57.416 A:middle
protocols through the Per-app

00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:57.666 A:middle
VPN.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:17:59.506 A:middle
These are also available for

00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:01.976 A:middle
device enrollments, but for user

00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:01.976 A:middle
device enrollments, but for user

00:18:01.976 --> 00:18:02.926 A:middle
enrollments, there's a very

00:18:02.926 --> 00:18:04.406 A:middle
important limitation on these,

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:06.316 A:middle
which is that the second-level

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:08.536 A:middle
domain of the VPN server must

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:10.586 A:middle
match the second-level domain in

00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:11.826 A:middle
the values for these keys.

00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:14.246 A:middle
So, for instance, if the VPN

00:18:14.246 --> 00:18:18.016 A:middle
server is VPN.acme.com, the mail

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:19.276 A:middle
domains can include

00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:21.816 A:middle
mail.acme.com, but they cannot

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:23.886 A:middle
include mail.aol.com.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.566 A:middle
This ensures that only the

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.156 A:middle
managed accounts are guided

00:18:27.156 --> 00:18:28.546 A:middle
through the Per-app VPN.

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.976 A:middle
If a user enrollment installs a

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:34.026 A:middle
passcode policy, iOS will

00:18:34.026 --> 00:18:35.976 A:middle
enforce a six-digit not simple

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:36.586 A:middle
passcode.

00:18:39.396 --> 00:18:41.246 A:middle
And it does not support more

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.796 A:middle
complex passcode requirements.

00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:44.366 A:middle
The main reason for this is

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:47.126 A:middle
because a more complex passcode

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.586 A:middle
requirement increases the risk

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:50.726 A:middle
that the user will forget the

00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:53.056 A:middle
passcode, and the MDM server

00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:54.296 A:middle
can't help out the user in this

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:55.536 A:middle
case by clearing the passcode.

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:56.796 A:middle
So, it would be unfair to

00:18:56.956 --> 00:18:57.756 A:middle
require this.

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:00.296 A:middle
For more information on why this

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:00.296 A:middle
For more information on why this

00:19:00.296 --> 00:19:02.196 A:middle
is the sweet spot for passcode

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:03.656 A:middle
policies, I suggest reading the

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:05.556 A:middle
latest edition of iOS security

00:19:05.556 --> 00:19:06.046 A:middle
document.

00:19:07.086 --> 00:19:09.036 A:middle
If you need proxying for Wi-Fi,

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.016 A:middle
use WPAD configured on the

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:11.736 A:middle
access points.

00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:13.426 A:middle
The Wi-Fi payload does not

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:15.066 A:middle
support any of the proxy keys.

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:17.746 A:middle
And defaults in logging payloads

00:19:17.896 --> 00:19:18.746 A:middle
are not supported.

00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:21.746 A:middle
Now these are very useful for

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.256 A:middle
troubleshooting or for reporting

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:25.176 A:middle
issues to Apple, and they can be

00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:26.776 A:middle
installed, but it must be done

00:19:26.776 --> 00:19:27.536 A:middle
by the user.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:28.996 A:middle
So that they have a chance to

00:19:28.996 --> 00:19:30.536 A:middle
accept the changes that these

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.676 A:middle
will make to their personal

00:19:34.456 --> 00:19:34.616 A:middle
device.

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.036 A:middle
User enrollments do support some

00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:36.726 A:middle
restrictions.

00:19:37.116 --> 00:19:38.516 A:middle
Managed Open In is available,

00:19:38.686 --> 00:19:40.166 A:middle
and the allowLockScreen

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:41.696 A:middle
restrictions are there, so that

00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:43.256 A:middle
managed data does not appear on

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:43.866 A:middle
the lock screen.

00:19:44.546 --> 00:19:47.166 A:middle
But it doesn't support any of

00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:48.116 A:middle
the supervised-only

00:19:48.116 --> 00:19:49.696 A:middle
restrictions, and it doesn't

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:51.336 A:middle
support any of the restrictions

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:52.366 A:middle
that really have nothing to do

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:54.386 A:middle
with managed data like content

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:55.786 A:middle
ratings or ones that turn off

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.216 A:middle
major features like iCloud.

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
These also apply to their

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
These also apply to their

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:01.586 A:middle
ActiveSync equivalents when an

00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:02.966 A:middle
exchange account is in user

00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:03.596 A:middle
enrollment mode.

00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:06.206 A:middle
And I have an important warning

00:20:06.256 --> 00:20:08.006 A:middle
for MDM server developers.

00:20:08.826 --> 00:20:10.166 A:middle
Make sure that your server is

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:12.266 A:middle
resilient to unexpected or

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:14.426 A:middle
absent keys and the results, as

00:20:14.736 --> 00:20:16.666 A:middle
these capabilities are going to

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
change over time.

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:21.256 A:middle
Now I'd like to welcome my

00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:22.726 A:middle
colleague Ren to the stage to

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:24.056 A:middle
demonstrate the user enrollment.

00:20:24.316 --> 00:20:24.586 A:middle
Ren?

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:30.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:30.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Bob.

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, hi everyone.

00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:43.996 A:middle
My name is Ren, and today, I'm

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:45.216 A:middle
going to demo the user

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:45.856 A:middle
enrollment flow.

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:47.796 A:middle
Just like device enrollment,

00:20:48.156 --> 00:20:49.716 A:middle
user enrollment starts with the

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:50.606 A:middle
profile, as well.

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:53.066 A:middle
To get that profile, today I'm

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:54.996 A:middle
going to go to an actual website

00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:56.766 A:middle
of a company called Acme Inc.

00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.176 A:middle
This is the website, and please

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:03.336 A:middle
be aware that this is just a

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:04.096 A:middle
demo website.

00:21:04.516 --> 00:21:05.606 A:middle
In the real world, you might

00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:07.036 A:middle
have to authenticate first to

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.106 A:middle
download anything.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.046 A:middle
But we skipped that step in this

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:10.636 A:middle
demo.

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:14.076 A:middle
And as Bob has said, user

00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:16.006 A:middle
enrollment works very closely

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.556 A:middle
with the Managed Apple ID.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:19.826 A:middle
So, I will have to provide this

00:21:19.826 --> 00:21:21.716 A:middle
ID information to this website

00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:23.436 A:middle
to have it download, or

00:21:23.436 --> 00:21:24.966 A:middle
generate, a profile for me.

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:28.426 A:middle
Let me paste in the username and

00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:29.436 A:middle
type on the enroll button.

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:32.866 A:middle
Read the warning carefully, and

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:34.206 A:middle
now, the profile has been

00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:35.326 A:middle
downloaded to my phone.

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:37.966 A:middle
Let's go to Settings to check it

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:39.266 A:middle
out.

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:41.076 A:middle
After opening Settings, who will

00:21:41.076 --> 00:21:42.896 A:middle
notice that a new cell with

00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:44.966 A:middle
text, "Enroll in Acme Inc.," has

00:21:44.966 --> 00:21:46.366 A:middle
been added to this page.

00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.546 A:middle
And that is the shortcut to

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:50.756 A:middle
start user enrollment, and I'm

00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:54.216 A:middle
going to take it now.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.376 A:middle
This is a new UI we made for

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
user enrollment.

00:21:57.766 --> 00:21:59.056 A:middle
We merged the profile's

00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.636 A:middle
basic information, the

00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.636 A:middle
basic information, the

00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:02.676 A:middle
warning, and consent all into

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:03.306 A:middle
one page.

00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:05.206 A:middle
We hope this will make your

00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:06.666 A:middle
profile installation experience

00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:07.646 A:middle
much smoother.

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.526 A:middle
Also, if you want to dig more

00:22:10.526 --> 00:22:11.746 A:middle
into the details of this

00:22:11.746 --> 00:22:13.566 A:middle
profile, you can do that by

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.266 A:middle
tapping on the Details button at

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:15.866 A:middle
the top right.

00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:19.656 A:middle
Let's take a look at the MDM

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:21.206 A:middle
payload of this profile.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:24.566 A:middle
And you will notice that the

00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:27.046 A:middle
managed Apple ID I provided at

00:22:27.046 --> 00:22:28.946 A:middle
the website has been added to

00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.906 A:middle
this payload, and this is the

00:22:30.906 --> 00:22:32.396 A:middle
key to trigger user enrollment.

00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:35.156 A:middle
Also, we removed the Access

00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:36.226 A:middle
Rights section from this

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:38.056 A:middle
payload, because it's not needed

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:39.056 A:middle
with user enrollment.

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:41.266 A:middle
Something that you might not

00:22:41.266 --> 00:22:43.646 A:middle
have noticed is if you go back

00:22:43.756 --> 00:22:45.076 A:middle
to the top-level page of this

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.476 A:middle
profile, you won't find any

00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:48.956 A:middle
warning talking about the things

00:22:49.006 --> 00:22:50.676 A:middle
the company can do to the

00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:52.176 A:middle
employee's -- this device.

00:22:52.846 --> 00:22:54.396 A:middle
And that is because, as Bob has

00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:55.986 A:middle
mentioned, we carefully

00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:58.826 A:middle
restricted the capability of the

00:22:58.826 --> 00:22:59.356 A:middle
MDM server.

00:22:59.696 --> 00:23:01.556 A:middle
So, it won't be able to disturb

00:22:59.696 --> 00:23:01.556 A:middle
So, it won't be able to disturb

00:23:01.856 --> 00:23:03.416 A:middle
your personal user experience

00:23:03.646 --> 00:23:04.906 A:middle
using your personal device.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:07.896 A:middle
Everything seems fine so far.

00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:08.906 A:middle
Let's continue profile

00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:10.756 A:middle
installation by tapping on the

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:12.446 A:middle
big rounded corner button on the

00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:12.826 A:middle
bottom.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:15.636 A:middle
I will provide my device

00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:19.586 A:middle
password, and now I'm prompted

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:21.276 A:middle
to sign in this Managed Apple

00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:21.526 A:middle
ID.

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:23.556 A:middle
So, depend on whether this

00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:26.046 A:middle
account is Federated or not, the

00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:27.276 A:middle
UI you see here might be

00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.046 A:middle
slightly different.

00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:29.746 A:middle
Here I'm just using a

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:31.476 A:middle
non-Federated regular account.

00:23:31.816 --> 00:23:33.266 A:middle
So, I just have to type in my

00:23:33.366 --> 00:23:36.416 A:middle
password for this account, and

00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:37.956 A:middle
tap on sign in to continue.

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.786 A:middle
Now, a bunch of things are

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:41.736 A:middle
happening on the background.

00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:44.046 A:middle
We have created a separate disk

00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:45.606 A:middle
volume on this device for

00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:46.436 A:middle
enterprise usage.

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.476 A:middle
We are signing in this Managed

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.986 A:middle
Apple ID to this device and

00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:51.886 A:middle
enrolling this device into the

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:52.566 A:middle
MDM server.

00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:54.886 A:middle
All these steps are tied

00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:56.976 A:middle
together, so if either of them

00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:58.486 A:middle
failed, they will revert

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.206 A:middle
everything and pretend like

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.206 A:middle
everything and pretend like

00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:01.146 A:middle
nothing has happened.

00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:03.666 A:middle
Now the user enrollment has

00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:05.096 A:middle
completed successfully.

00:24:05.536 --> 00:24:07.496 A:middle
The MDM server can start sending

00:24:07.556 --> 00:24:09.096 A:middle
MDM commands like install

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:10.556 A:middle
application, curate device

00:24:10.556 --> 00:24:11.926 A:middle
information, etc., to this

00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:12.266 A:middle
device.

00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:14.436 A:middle
The pop-up you see now, it

00:24:14.436 --> 00:24:15.796 A:middle
actually came from the MDM

00:24:15.796 --> 00:24:18.306 A:middle
server asking me to install an

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:19.136 A:middle
app called Slack.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.556 A:middle
Let's approve it, and the

00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:22.766 A:middle
installation shall start

00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:23.276 A:middle
shortly.

00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:26.526 A:middle
Another tip about user

00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:28.266 A:middle
enrollment is, if you want to

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.806 A:middle
check out the account we just

00:24:29.866 --> 00:24:31.576 A:middle
signed in, you can do that by

00:24:31.576 --> 00:24:35.316 A:middle
going to Settings, Account and

00:24:35.426 --> 00:24:36.766 A:middle
Password -- Password and

00:24:36.766 --> 00:24:38.996 A:middle
Accounts, and you will find that

00:24:38.996 --> 00:24:40.266 A:middle
interface account there.

00:24:41.016 --> 00:24:42.536 A:middle
The same account has also been

00:24:42.536 --> 00:24:44.776 A:middle
added to apps like Files and

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.306 A:middle
Notes, and it's ready for you to

00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:46.566 A:middle
use.

00:24:47.286 --> 00:24:48.526 A:middle
Let's take a look at the Files,

00:24:48.526 --> 00:24:49.226 A:middle
for example.

00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:52.426 A:middle
After opening files, you will

00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:54.536 A:middle
notice that a new iCloud drive

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:56.396 A:middle
with tag Enterprise has been

00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:59.266 A:middle
added to Files, and all your

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:00.996 A:middle
enterprise data will be sent

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:00.996 A:middle
enterprise data will be sent

00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:02.416 A:middle
through this iCloud drive.

00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:04.726 A:middle
All right that's it for demo.

00:25:04.976 --> 00:25:06.186 A:middle
Thanks for watching, and back to

00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:06.546 A:middle
you, Bob.

[ Applause ]

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:17.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; User enrollments are also

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.836 A:middle
supported on macOS.

00:25:19.576 --> 00:25:20.866 A:middle
They work with a Managed Apple

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:21.326 A:middle
ID.

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.496 A:middle
It creates a managed APFS

00:25:23.496 --> 00:25:24.166 A:middle
volume.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.336 A:middle
Notes data is fully separated

00:25:26.336 --> 00:25:27.386 A:middle
between the volumes, depending

00:25:27.386 --> 00:25:28.616 A:middle
on the account, and the

00:25:28.616 --> 00:25:29.896 A:middle
management capabilities are

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.546 A:middle
similar to what I described for

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:32.896 A:middle
iOS, although there are some

00:25:32.896 --> 00:25:34.406 A:middle
platform-specific differences.

00:25:35.536 --> 00:25:37.116 A:middle
This allows users to access the

00:25:37.116 --> 00:25:39.376 A:middle
same Managed Apple ID on their

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:42.556 A:middle
personal iOS device and on their

00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:45.326 A:middle
Mac.

00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:46.576 A:middle
user enrollments provide a

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:48.156 A:middle
better balance for BYOD.

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:50.906 A:middle
It's time to set a new agreement

00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:52.656 A:middle
between admins and their users.

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.626 A:middle
Admins should evaluate user

00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:56.536 A:middle
enrollments, and they should

00:25:56.536 --> 00:25:58.066 A:middle
reevaluate their security

00:25:58.066 --> 00:25:59.966 A:middle
policies and shed some of these

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:01.396 A:middle
outdated requirements that don't

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:01.396 A:middle
outdated requirements that don't

00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:03.226 A:middle
make sense on modern devices.

00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:05.906 A:middle
Admins should provide a privacy

00:26:05.966 --> 00:26:08.126 A:middle
policy to protect and reassure

00:26:08.126 --> 00:26:08.816 A:middle
their users.

00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:10.696 A:middle
We think this is the best way to

00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:12.516 A:middle
bring BYOD devices into an

00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:13.096 A:middle
organization.

00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:13.886 A:middle
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Bob and

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:23.626 A:middle
Ren, and now I'd like to take us

00:26:23.656 --> 00:26:25.206 A:middle
through a couple of other topics

00:26:25.206 --> 00:26:27.026 A:middle
related to balancing these

00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:27.636 A:middle
values.

00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:29.146 A:middle
The first, Certificate

00:26:29.146 --> 00:26:30.866 A:middle
Transparency, an important new

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:32.246 A:middle
security enhancement that we

00:26:32.246 --> 00:26:33.686 A:middle
brought to all of our OSs last

00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:34.126 A:middle
December.

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:37.756 A:middle
However, this can sometimes leak

00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:39.046 A:middle
internal host names to public

00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:40.576 A:middle
logs that enterprises might be

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:41.286 A:middle
concerned about.

00:26:41.606 --> 00:26:43.166 A:middle
So, at the same time, we added a

00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
new payload, enabling them to

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.976 A:middle
opt out specifically sensitive

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:48.856 A:middle
certificates or domains, and

00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:49.806 A:middle
they can install as many

00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:51.326 A:middle
payloads as they need to manage

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:53.476 A:middle
all of those sensitive items.

00:26:54.976 --> 00:26:56.966 A:middle
We also added support for WPA3

00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:58.736 A:middle
security type to the Wi-Fi

00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
payload, including both personal

00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
payload, including both personal

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:02.066 A:middle
and enterprise authentication.

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:05.526 A:middle
We also wanted to make it much

00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:07.116 A:middle
easier for MDM servers to use

00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:08.456 A:middle
the newer, more efficient push

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.676 A:middle
API to communicate with all of

00:27:10.676 --> 00:27:11.816 A:middle
their enrolled devices.

00:27:12.156 --> 00:27:13.856 A:middle
So, we now support token-based

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:16.496 A:middle
authentication for APNS.

00:27:16.496 --> 00:27:20.106 A:middle
Now this is not new.

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:21.536 A:middle
We talked about this last year,

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:22.726 A:middle
but this year, we're actually

00:27:22.726 --> 00:27:24.096 A:middle
enforcing that if you're using a

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:26.406 A:middle
device enrollment, those devices

00:27:26.536 --> 00:27:28.136 A:middle
will be supervised and

00:27:28.136 --> 00:27:29.436 A:middle
enrollment will be mandatory.

00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:31.436 A:middle
And this year, we're taking the

00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:32.986 A:middle
opportunity to further deprecate

00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:34.656 A:middle
the allow pairing key, because

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:36.186 A:middle
that sets that value permanently

00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:37.186 A:middle
at enrollment time.

00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:39.386 A:middle
Instead, we recommend using the

00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:41.026 A:middle
existing configuration profile

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.306 A:middle
restriction, which can be

00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:43.366 A:middle
changed at any time.

00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:46.986 A:middle
Now I'd like to turn to a number

00:27:46.986 --> 00:27:49.836 A:middle
of macOS-specific topics related

00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:51.176 A:middle
to, again, mitigating the

00:27:51.176 --> 00:27:52.436 A:middle
impacts of various security

00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:53.856 A:middle
improvements on manageability.

00:27:54.546 --> 00:27:55.736 A:middle
The first, a security

00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:57.426 A:middle
improvement introduced in Mojave

00:27:57.546 --> 00:27:59.346 A:middle
that made it more difficult to

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.846 A:middle
enable remote management when

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.846 A:middle
enable remote management when

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:01.986 A:middle
configuring new Macs.

00:28:02.706 --> 00:28:05.416 A:middle
In macOS X.14.4, we added a pair

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.886 A:middle
of new commands that enable you

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.786 A:middle
to enable remote desktop

00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:11.416 A:middle
management via two MDM commands,

00:28:12.336 --> 00:28:13.676 A:middle
and they also configure the most

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:14.946 A:middle
common options that you'll need

00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:16.366 A:middle
for ongoing management of those

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:17.876 A:middle
Macs, using Remote Desktop.

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:22.666 A:middle
We also wanted to allow you to

00:28:23.046 --> 00:28:24.536 A:middle
use your mobile accounts with

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.836 A:middle
Macs using FileVault.

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.846 A:middle
So, there's a new capability

00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:29.876 A:middle
that MDM servers can manage a

00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.086 A:middle
new bootstrap token.

00:28:31.766 --> 00:28:33.096 A:middle
They asked the client Mac for

00:28:33.096 --> 00:28:34.676 A:middle
that token, and then escrow it

00:28:34.676 --> 00:28:35.676 A:middle
themselves.

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:37.646 A:middle
Then whenever a new user signs

00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.426 A:middle
in on that Mac, it will request

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:40.836 A:middle
the bootstrap token from the MDM

00:28:40.836 --> 00:28:42.556 A:middle
server and use it to generate

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:44.036 A:middle
the SecureToken needed to mount

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:45.336 A:middle
the file systems and boot the

00:28:45.336 --> 00:28:45.466 A:middle
Mac.

[ Applause ]

00:28:49.046 --> 00:28:50.186 A:middle
We think this will great for

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:51.596 A:middle
helping with password changes in

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
your organization.

00:28:53.006 --> 00:28:55.996 A:middle
Now the privacy policy payload

00:28:55.996 --> 00:28:58.226 A:middle
is not new in Catalina, though

00:28:58.226 --> 00:28:59.906 A:middle
it's also a great example of a

00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
way that we help you mitigate

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:11.436 A:middle
using this policy.

00:29:11.986 --> 00:29:13.606 A:middle
For example, enabling keyloggers

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:14.486 A:middle
or screen recording in the

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.806 A:middle
background, or whitelisting your

00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:18.046 A:middle
internal apps that you don't

00:29:18.046 --> 00:29:19.716 A:middle
want to notarize, so that they

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:20.996 A:middle
continue to run, even though

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:22.786 A:middle
macOS Catalina requires that

00:29:22.786 --> 00:29:24.186 A:middle
apps and text be notarized.

00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:29.866 A:middle
Next, there is a new change that

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:32.066 A:middle
is new in macOS, Catalina,

00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:33.496 A:middle
where, again, we're tweaking the

00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:34.686 A:middle
balance between security

00:29:34.686 --> 00:29:35.616 A:middle
manageability.

00:29:36.236 --> 00:29:38.476 A:middle
Enabling FileVault via MDM now

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.906 A:middle
requires user-approved MDM

00:29:39.906 --> 00:29:41.816 A:middle
enrollments, which means you can

00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:43.626 A:middle
no longer pass off credentials

00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:45.286 A:middle
on the command line's fdesetup.

00:29:45.966 --> 00:29:47.006 A:middle
So, you should review your

00:29:47.006 --> 00:29:48.556 A:middle
scripts and MDM agents if you

00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:50.196 A:middle
have one in your MDM product, to

00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:51.456 A:middle
be prepared for this change.

00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:54.676 A:middle
Next, I think I heard there's

00:29:54.676 --> 00:29:55.976 A:middle
been a lot of excitement about

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.426 A:middle
Activation Lock coming to T2

00:29:57.426 --> 00:29:58.906 A:middle
Macs and macOS Catalina.

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:00.096 A:middle
So, of course, we made this

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:00.096 A:middle
So, of course, we made this

00:30:00.096 --> 00:30:02.096 A:middle
manageable via MDM, just like

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:02.336 A:middle
iOS.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:05.146 A:middle
In fact, your MDM servers will

00:30:05.146 --> 00:30:06.966 A:middle
use the same endpoint in API as

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:07.216 A:middle
iOS.

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:09.846 A:middle
Those APIs will be available

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.226 A:middle
soon, and service fully

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.816 A:middle
available later this summer.

00:30:12.816 --> 00:30:13.976 A:middle
So, you can test your

00:30:13.976 --> 00:30:15.406 A:middle
implementation and have it ready

00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:16.516 A:middle
when that kept a Catalina ships

00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:17.186 A:middle
later this fall.

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:24.976 A:middle
It's a big deal.

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:26.576 A:middle
Again, a couple of changes to

00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:27.836 A:middle
tweak that balance.

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:29.646 A:middle
We're deprecating in macOS

00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:31.216 A:middle
Catalina, although all of these

00:30:31.216 --> 00:30:32.316 A:middle
capabilities will continue to

00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:34.746 A:middle
work in Catalina, starting with

00:30:34.746 --> 00:30:36.236 A:middle
silent profile installation from

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:37.016 A:middle
the command line.

00:30:38.316 --> 00:30:39.926 A:middle
With Screen Time coming to macOS

00:30:39.926 --> 00:30:41.736 A:middle
and Catalina, we are deprecating

00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:43.386 A:middle
path-based app black and

00:30:43.386 --> 00:30:44.616 A:middle
whitelists that are currently

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:45.906 A:middle
configured using the parental

00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:47.356 A:middle
controls application access

00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:47.816 A:middle
payload.

00:30:48.936 --> 00:30:50.456 A:middle
And if your MDM server is still

00:30:50.456 --> 00:30:52.286 A:middle
using the outdated user channel

00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:53.836 A:middle
only enrollments, you should

00:30:53.836 --> 00:30:54.626 A:middle
move to the modern

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:56.126 A:middle
macOS-specific enrollments that

00:30:56.126 --> 00:30:57.326 A:middle
are required for user

00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:59.096 A:middle
enrollments and also will be for

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.686 A:middle
any future enhancements to macOS

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.686 A:middle
any future enhancements to macOS

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:01.596 A:middle
device management.

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:05.916 A:middle
Can we get a finely for the

00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:06.366 A:middle
slide?

00:31:07.446 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
I've been showing a version of

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:09.486 A:middle
this for I don't want to say how

00:31:09.486 --> 00:31:10.846 A:middle
many years, but this year, in

00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:13.196 A:middle
iOS 13 we will stop honoring the

00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:14.886 A:middle
list of restrictions created

00:31:14.886 --> 00:31:16.336 A:middle
before supervision existed,

00:31:16.536 --> 00:31:17.306 A:middle
which really should be

00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:20.046 A:middle
supervised only, but there'll be

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.406 A:middle
some grandfathering to make the

00:31:21.406 --> 00:31:22.776 A:middle
transition a bit easier for

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:24.096 A:middle
organizations relying on these

00:31:24.096 --> 00:31:24.816 A:middle
restrictions.

00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:27.486 A:middle
For unsupervised devices with

00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:28.916 A:middle
these restrictions enforced on

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:31.016 A:middle
iOS 12, when they're upgraded to

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:32.756 A:middle
iOS 13, they will remain in

00:31:32.756 --> 00:31:34.656 A:middle
force, but they will not be

00:31:34.656 --> 00:31:36.236 A:middle
honored on those unsupervised

00:31:36.236 --> 00:31:37.926 A:middle
devices if you backup and then

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:39.366 A:middle
restore to that device or

00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:40.816 A:middle
another unsupervised device.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.746 A:middle
This means that MDM servers need

00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:44.616 A:middle
to stop sending these

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:45.796 A:middle
restrictions to unsupervised

00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:46.906 A:middle
devices, because they will no

00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:47.716 A:middle
longer be honored.

00:31:50.596 --> 00:31:52.146 A:middle
Bob explained that user

00:31:52.146 --> 00:31:53.246 A:middle
enrollment does not support the

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:54.966 A:middle
unlock token, and we're also

00:31:54.966 --> 00:31:56.276 A:middle
making some changes device

00:31:56.276 --> 00:31:57.796 A:middle
enrollment related to it.

00:31:58.236 --> 00:31:59.436 A:middle
Specifically, though, this is

00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:00.996 A:middle
not new best practice.

00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:00.996 A:middle
not new best practice.

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:02.406 A:middle
I always advise that you get the

00:32:02.406 --> 00:32:03.696 A:middle
unlock token as soon as you need

00:32:03.696 --> 00:32:04.476 A:middle
it and remember it.

00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:06.756 A:middle
It will now only be available in

00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:07.996 A:middle
the first successful token

00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:09.106 A:middle
update after enrollment.

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.036 A:middle
Similarly, devices which have

00:32:12.036 --> 00:32:13.476 A:middle
been paired and supervised with

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:15.506 A:middle
Apple Configurator, you still

00:32:15.506 --> 00:32:16.876 A:middle
need to get the unlock token

00:32:16.876 --> 00:32:18.436 A:middle
before you set a passcode on

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.136 A:middle
that device.

00:32:19.686 --> 00:32:21.866 A:middle
So, that brings us to the end of

00:32:21.866 --> 00:32:23.596 A:middle
our second section of content,

00:32:24.086 --> 00:32:26.146 A:middle
and I'd like to now turn to some

00:32:26.146 --> 00:32:27.586 A:middle
new device capabilities that

00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:29.016 A:middle
allow you to continue using

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:30.276 A:middle
services you're already using

00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:31.426 A:middle
while adding some great new

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:33.226 A:middle
Apple services to help Apple

00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:34.336 A:middle
devices stand out in your

00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:34.966 A:middle
organization.

00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:36.946 A:middle
The first one is another really

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:38.296 A:middle
big deal that Craig highlighted

00:32:38.296 --> 00:32:40.176 A:middle
in Monday's keynote, and I'd

00:32:40.176 --> 00:32:41.376 A:middle
like to ask Matt Chanda to come

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:42.706 A:middle
on stage and tell you all about

00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:43.526 A:middle
Single Sign-On.

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:43.896 A:middle
Matt?

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:50.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:50.716 --> 00:32:51.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:32:52.156 --> 00:32:53.086 A:middle
Good morning, my name's Matt

00:32:53.086 --> 00:32:54.566 A:middle
Chanda, and I am a consulting

00:32:54.566 --> 00:32:55.686 A:middle
engineer and part of the team

00:32:55.686 --> 00:32:57.036 A:middle
that created Single Sign-On.

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.426 A:middle
As you know, almost all

00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:00.896 A:middle
enterprise apps and websites

00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:00.896 A:middle
enterprise apps and websites

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.096 A:middle
need to authenticate in order to

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:02.486 A:middle
function.

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.806 A:middle
These apps connect the systems

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:06.396 A:middle
of record either in the cloud,

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:09.066 A:middle
on premise, and sometimes both.

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.396 A:middle
Recently though, authentication

00:33:11.396 --> 00:33:12.086 A:middle
has been getting more

00:33:12.086 --> 00:33:12.796 A:middle
complicated.

00:33:13.406 --> 00:33:14.406 A:middle
You have to handle multiple

00:33:14.406 --> 00:33:15.926 A:middle
authentication protocols such as

00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:19.186 A:middle
Kerberos, OpenID Connect, and

00:33:20.376 --> 00:33:20.726 A:middle
SAML.

00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.726 A:middle
You're now federated to the

00:33:21.726 --> 00:33:23.476 A:middle
cloud, and you need to trust

00:33:23.476 --> 00:33:25.186 A:middle
your devices and use more than

00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:26.026 A:middle
just passwords for

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:26.706 A:middle
authentication.

00:33:27.446 --> 00:33:29.426 A:middle
So, how do organizations deal

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:30.356 A:middle
with these challenges?

00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:32.306 A:middle
Well, they use Single Sign-On to

00:33:32.306 --> 00:33:32.546 A:middle
help.

00:33:33.086 --> 00:33:36.366 A:middle
When they use Single Sign-On,

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:37.716 A:middle
they have a suite of apps and

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:40.086 A:middle
websites that they log in once

00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:42.116 A:middle
too, and is reused across all of

00:33:42.116 --> 00:33:42.206 A:middle
them.

00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:44.576 A:middle
Organizations will also use this

00:33:44.576 --> 00:33:46.096 A:middle
to improve the user experience

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:48.186 A:middle
of authentication, avoid the

00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:50.076 A:middle
user friction of signing in over

00:33:50.076 --> 00:33:50.776 A:middle
and over again.

00:33:52.146 --> 00:33:53.606 A:middle
Some organizations just don't

00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:54.436 A:middle
have passwords.

00:33:55.016 --> 00:33:55.966 A:middle
So, they have to use Single

00:33:55.966 --> 00:33:57.886 A:middle
Sign-On to authenticate, and the

00:33:57.886 --> 00:33:59.586 A:middle
challenge is that not every

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:01.646 A:middle
application supports their

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.446 A:middle
authentication stack.

00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:08.226 A:middle
And, with all the risks these

00:34:08.226 --> 00:34:10.126 A:middle
days, you want to supplement

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:11.436 A:middle
your authentication processes

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:12.746 A:middle
with trust score data and other

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:13.985 A:middle
information about the device

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.235 A:middle
that you're running on.

00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:17.536 A:middle
So, today I'd like to tell you

00:34:17.536 --> 00:34:18.716 A:middle
about the powerful new Single

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:20.146 A:middle
Sign-On capabilities we added to

00:34:20.146 --> 00:34:22.676 A:middle
both iOS 13 and macOS Catalina.

00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:25.196 A:middle
It's enabled by the extensible

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:27.666 A:middle
SSO MDM profile, as well as

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:29.406 A:middle
associated domains, and it works

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:30.585 A:middle
great with user enrollment, as

00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:30.815 A:middle
well.

00:34:32.065 --> 00:34:33.496 A:middle
The extension has the option to

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:37.255 A:middle
show UI, load a webpage, or just

00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:38.516 A:middle
handle the request silently.

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.516 A:middle
We think these changes will help

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:44.735 A:middle
you use and create SSO solutions

00:34:45.156 --> 00:34:46.446 A:middle
that are both secure and

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:47.076 A:middle
user-friendly.

00:34:47.676 --> 00:34:49.255 A:middle
So, in our session today, I will

00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:50.255 A:middle
provide a summary of Single

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.536 A:middle
Sign-On and how it works.

00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:53.376 A:middle
For more detail, look for a

00:34:53.376 --> 00:34:54.565 A:middle
recorded session after the

00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:55.985 A:middle
conference with code samples and

00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:56.616 A:middle
more information.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:35:01.026 A:middle
Earlier this week, you heard

00:34:57.096 --> 00:35:01.026 A:middle
Earlier this week, you heard

00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:02.446 A:middle
about an awesome new feature for

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:04.246 A:middle
consumer apps called Sign in

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:04.766 A:middle
with Apple.

00:35:05.216 --> 00:35:06.226 A:middle
This is going to be great for

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:07.306 A:middle
consumer apps, but they don't

00:35:07.306 --> 00:35:08.336 A:middle
support all the complex

00:35:08.336 --> 00:35:09.926 A:middle
scenarios that are needed for

00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:11.396 A:middle
enterprise applications.

00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:14.126 A:middle
So, Single Sign-On is different,

00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:15.656 A:middle
and it's intended for

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:17.296 A:middle
third-party identity providers,

00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:19.396 A:middle
such as Microsoft, Okta, Ping,

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:19.946 A:middle
and others.

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:22.696 A:middle
In addition, you should know

00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:24.036 A:middle
that managed Apple IDs will not

00:35:24.036 --> 00:35:28.276 A:middle
work with Sign In with Apple.

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.236 A:middle
Okay, so, in order to make

00:35:30.236 --> 00:35:31.896 A:middle
Single Sign-On work, you need to

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.546 A:middle
have a set of apps and websites,

00:35:34.136 --> 00:35:35.386 A:middle
and you have to have an identity

00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:36.466 A:middle
provider that they're set up to

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:36.926 A:middle
use.

00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.686 A:middle
And then, what glues it together

00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:40.026 A:middle
will be the new Single Sign-On

00:35:40.026 --> 00:35:40.606 A:middle
extension.

00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:42.626 A:middle
So, we'll focus on the Single

00:35:42.626 --> 00:35:43.926 A:middle
Sign-On extension today.

00:35:43.926 --> 00:35:47.546 A:middle
All right, so how does it work?

00:35:48.436 --> 00:35:49.406 A:middle
There are two types of

00:35:49.406 --> 00:35:50.926 A:middle
extensions, redirect and

00:35:50.926 --> 00:35:51.326 A:middle
credential.

00:35:52.336 --> 00:35:53.396 A:middle
So, let's start with redirect

00:35:53.396 --> 00:35:53.856 A:middle
extensions.

00:35:54.446 --> 00:35:58.086 A:middle
Redirect extensions are intended

00:35:58.086 --> 00:35:59.486 A:middle
for modern authentication

00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:00.286 A:middle
protocols, such as

00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:00.286 A:middle
protocols, such as

00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:02.356 A:middle
OpenIDConnect, OAuth 2, or SAML.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.496 A:middle
They will run on top of web

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:05.886 A:middle
technologies, and they

00:36:05.886 --> 00:36:06.826 A:middle
frequently are paired with

00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:08.346 A:middle
Federation to on-premise or

00:36:08.346 --> 00:36:09.276 A:middle
cloud systems for

00:36:09.276 --> 00:36:10.016 A:middle
authentication.

00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:14.546 A:middle
Let's check out an example of

00:36:15.276 --> 00:36:15.606 A:middle
the flow.

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.816 A:middle
With Safari, we will route a

00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:19.526 A:middle
request to the Single Sign-On

00:36:19.526 --> 00:36:20.976 A:middle
extension instead of loading the

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:21.676 A:middle
webpage.

00:36:23.436 --> 00:36:25.066 A:middle
The extension will receive the

00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:27.306 A:middle
headers, the body, and the URL

00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:27.996 A:middle
of the request.

00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:30.596 A:middle
It's now up to the extension to

00:36:30.596 --> 00:36:31.756 A:middle
complete the authentication

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:32.946 A:middle
process with the identity

00:36:32.946 --> 00:36:33.396 A:middle
provider.

00:36:34.566 --> 00:36:37.236 A:middle
And when ready, it will return a

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:39.396 A:middle
URL response back to Safari.

00:36:40.846 --> 00:36:41.776 A:middle
Please take note that this

00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:43.266 A:middle
response should not be large.

00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:45.666 A:middle
It's intended for a web form

00:36:45.716 --> 00:36:48.146 A:middle
post of SAML response or other

00:36:48.146 --> 00:36:49.406 A:middle
tokens back to the server.

00:36:49.776 --> 00:36:51.126 A:middle
Don't try to load a giant, 1-meg

00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:51.856 A:middle
webpage in it.

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:57.556 A:middle
So, what can these extensions

00:36:57.556 --> 00:36:57.956 A:middle
do?

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.566 A:middle
They can do a lot of things.

00:36:59.756 --> 00:37:01.616 A:middle
I've listed a few of them here.

00:36:59.756 --> 00:37:01.616 A:middle
I've listed a few of them here.

00:37:01.906 --> 00:37:02.896 A:middle
They can choose to present a

00:37:02.896 --> 00:37:04.576 A:middle
native screen for authentication

00:37:04.646 --> 00:37:06.106 A:middle
instead of loading the webpage.

00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:07.776 A:middle
The native screen could ask for

00:37:07.776 --> 00:37:08.906 A:middle
the username and password if

00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:10.576 A:middle
that applies, or it can ask for

00:37:10.576 --> 00:37:12.166 A:middle
additional multi-factors, as

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.986 A:middle
your requirements dictate.

00:37:15.876 --> 00:37:17.426 A:middle
If you've generated keys with

00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:19.386 A:middle
the secure enclave, perhaps they

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:20.796 A:middle
can sign attributes and send it

00:37:20.796 --> 00:37:21.886 A:middle
along with the request to

00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:23.976 A:middle
strongly pair the device with

00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:25.516 A:middle
the user, so that you have that

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:27.636 A:middle
extra confidence in the request.

00:37:28.856 --> 00:37:30.016 A:middle
Other trust score values could

00:37:30.016 --> 00:37:31.326 A:middle
be appended, such as the version

00:37:31.326 --> 00:37:32.386 A:middle
of the operating system running

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:33.706 A:middle
on the device or whatever else

00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:36.086 A:middle
you need to feel good about it.

00:37:37.186 --> 00:37:39.826 A:middle
It could simply load a webpage

00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:40.996 A:middle
and follow the redirects for

00:37:40.996 --> 00:37:42.596 A:middle
Federation, and that's going to

00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:44.546 A:middle
be a very common scenario.

00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:47.686 A:middle
And with the new FIDO2

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:49.826 A:middle
capabilities in macOS this year,

00:37:49.826 --> 00:37:51.656 A:middle
it could use web authentication

00:37:51.656 --> 00:37:52.886 A:middle
to authenticate the device, as

00:37:52.886 --> 00:37:54.276 A:middle
well, if your identity provider

00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:55.486 A:middle
supports it.

00:37:56.296 --> 00:37:57.636 A:middle
For more information on web

00:37:57.636 --> 00:37:59.286 A:middle
authentication, see the What's

00:37:59.286 --> 00:38:00.666 A:middle
New in Authentication session in

00:37:59.286 --> 00:38:00.666 A:middle
New in Authentication session in

00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:01.606 A:middle
this year's conference.

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:05.336 A:middle
Redirect extensions will also

00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:06.376 A:middle
work for native apps.

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:08.626 A:middle
Native apps have an additional

00:38:08.626 --> 00:38:09.466 A:middle
capability though.

00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:11.236 A:middle
They can send operations to the

00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:11.766 A:middle
extension.

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:14.656 A:middle
These operations would be, or

00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.746 A:middle
examples are login, refresh

00:38:16.746 --> 00:38:18.006 A:middle
tokens, or logout.

00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:20.716 A:middle
This way, the app developers can

00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:22.486 A:middle
decide when does authentication

00:38:22.576 --> 00:38:23.736 A:middle
fit within the flow of my

00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:24.426 A:middle
application?

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.576 A:middle
And hopefully, the extension

00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:27.756 A:middle
will accommodate that.

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:30.166 A:middle
And for the enterprise

00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:31.896 A:middle
developers in the audience, this

00:38:31.896 --> 00:38:33.086 A:middle
means you can effectively use

00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.886 A:middle
the extension as your identity

00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:36.316 A:middle
library or authentication

00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:36.736 A:middle
library.

00:38:37.946 --> 00:38:39.376 A:middle
It avoids the need to include a

00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:40.886 A:middle
copy of the library in every app

00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:42.036 A:middle
that you have and then

00:38:42.036 --> 00:38:43.356 A:middle
subsequently maintaining it over

00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:43.716 A:middle
time.

00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:48.031 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:48.526 A:middle
It'll be great.

00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:52.696 A:middle
So, let's check out the flow for

00:38:52.696 --> 00:38:53.706 A:middle
native app.

00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:57.126 A:middle
The native app will send the

00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.646 A:middle
operation to the extension

00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:00.246 A:middle
instead of the URL request.

00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:00.246 A:middle
instead of the URL request.

00:39:00.246 --> 00:39:01.656 A:middle
In this example, it's login.

00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:04.336 A:middle
The extension is still

00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:05.506 A:middle
responsible for completing the

00:39:05.506 --> 00:39:07.026 A:middle
authentication process with the

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:09.416 A:middle
identity provider, and when

00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:10.656 A:middle
ready, it will return the URL

00:39:10.656 --> 00:39:11.986 A:middle
response, but really, most

00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:13.246 A:middle
importantly, the tokens that are

00:39:13.246 --> 00:39:14.636 A:middle
needed by that application that

00:39:14.636 --> 00:39:16.136 A:middle
they requested, in order to

00:39:16.376 --> 00:39:17.676 A:middle
process and work correctly,

00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:19.426 A:middle
think ID tokens and access

00:39:19.456 --> 00:39:20.856 A:middle
tokens for consuming other

00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:21.326 A:middle
services.

00:39:21.806 --> 00:39:24.906 A:middle
Now that we know what it does,

00:39:25.146 --> 00:39:26.426 A:middle
let's talk about what we need to

00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:27.236 A:middle
do to make it work.

00:39:27.916 --> 00:39:31.706 A:middle
It is enabled by the extensible

00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:34.586 A:middle
SSO profile in iOS 13 and macOS

00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:35.106 A:middle
Catalina.

00:39:36.616 --> 00:39:37.606 A:middle
Check out the example here.

00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:39.156 A:middle
The identifier is

00:39:39.156 --> 00:39:41.376 A:middle
com.apple.extensiblesso.

00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:45.456 A:middle
It specifies the specific

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:46.776 A:middle
extension that you want to use

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:48.046 A:middle
in your environment, including

00:39:48.046 --> 00:39:48.996 A:middle
the team identifier.

00:39:50.456 --> 00:39:52.696 A:middle
It lists the type, in this case,

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:56.756 A:middle
redirect, as well as the list of

00:39:56.756 --> 00:39:59.136 A:middle
URLs that will be redirected to

00:39:59.136 --> 00:39:59.576 A:middle
the extension.

00:40:03.156 --> 00:40:04.946 A:middle
And finally, an optional

00:40:04.946 --> 00:40:07.216 A:middle
dictionary of extension-specific

00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:08.156 A:middle
values from the MDM.

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.146 A:middle
In this example, I'm sending a

00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:11.226 A:middle
user name, but you can put

00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:12.186 A:middle
whatever you need in there.

00:40:15.876 --> 00:40:17.496 A:middle
The second requirement is to use

00:40:17.496 --> 00:40:18.656 A:middle
associated domains.

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.856 A:middle
You're required to use

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.086 A:middle
associated domains because you

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.406 A:middle
can't just redirect any

00:40:23.406 --> 00:40:24.726 A:middle
authentication traffic on the

00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:25.836 A:middle
device to your extension.

00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:29.266 A:middle
You can only redirect traffic

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:30.936 A:middle
that is owned by you or your

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:31.786 A:middle
identity provider.

00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:34.846 A:middle
So, in order to set up

00:40:34.846 --> 00:40:36.806 A:middle
associated domains, you need to

00:40:36.806 --> 00:40:38.866 A:middle
use the offserve service type,

00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:40.526 A:middle
followed by a colon, and then,

00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.996 A:middle
each of the host names in the

00:40:41.996 --> 00:40:42.936 A:middle
URL list that we saw in the

00:40:42.936 --> 00:40:43.646 A:middle
previous slides.

00:40:43.646 --> 00:40:47.626 A:middle
If your app has multiple hosts,

00:40:47.816 --> 00:40:49.096 A:middle
then you need to list each one

00:40:49.096 --> 00:40:50.446 A:middle
separately in the file.

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:54.976 A:middle
Associated Domains also requires

00:40:54.976 --> 00:40:57.476 A:middle
that the host app ID is in the

00:40:57.476 --> 00:40:59.356 A:middle
Apple app site association file

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:00.786 A:middle
that on the destination server.

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:00.786 A:middle
that on the destination server.

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:03.676 A:middle
The server must be accessible by

00:41:03.676 --> 00:41:05.596 A:middle
the device and have a valid SSL

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:05.966 A:middle
cert.

00:41:07.046 --> 00:41:08.396 A:middle
User-approved or custom root

00:41:08.396 --> 00:41:09.796 A:middle
certificates are not supported.

00:41:12.076 --> 00:41:14.096 A:middle
However, in some cases, the

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.886 A:middle
associated domains are not known

00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:16.816 A:middle
at the time the app is

00:41:16.816 --> 00:41:17.306 A:middle
developed.

00:41:18.146 --> 00:41:20.076 A:middle
A great example of this is when

00:41:20.076 --> 00:41:21.706 A:middle
an identity provider develops an

00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:25.626 A:middle
extension, but each customer's

00:41:25.626 --> 00:41:26.666 A:middle
hostname is different.

00:41:26.996 --> 00:41:28.046 A:middle
They can't list thousands of

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.256 A:middle
them in an entitlement file.

00:41:29.256 --> 00:41:30.176 A:middle
It just won't happen.

00:41:30.806 --> 00:41:32.166 A:middle
When this occurs, we can use the

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.786 A:middle
new Manage Associated Domains

00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:35.376 A:middle
profile on macOS.

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:39.396 A:middle
In the example here, note that

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.956 A:middle
the payload value is the same as

00:41:41.956 --> 00:41:42.756 A:middle
what would've been in the

00:41:42.756 --> 00:41:45.216 A:middle
entitlement file that was on the

00:41:45.766 --> 00:41:48.156 A:middle
app that was developed.

00:41:48.156 --> 00:41:49.546 A:middle
On iOS, you can use a new

00:41:49.546 --> 00:41:51.276 A:middle
associated domains application

00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:53.906 A:middle
attribute, and again, note that

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:56.696 A:middle
the value of the attribute is

00:41:56.696 --> 00:41:57.596 A:middle
the same as what would've been

00:41:57.596 --> 00:41:58.836 A:middle
in the entitlements file in the

00:41:58.906 --> 00:42:00.616 A:middle
host app that would happen.

00:41:58.906 --> 00:42:00.616 A:middle
host app that would happen.

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:03.896 A:middle
The last step for using managed

00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:06.176 A:middle
associated domains is to include

00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:07.946 A:middle
the managed associated domain's

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:10.556 A:middle
entitlement in the host apps

00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:10.946 A:middle
file.

00:42:11.106 --> 00:42:12.256 A:middle
This lets us know that you want

00:42:12.256 --> 00:42:13.566 A:middle
to use the managed values, in

00:42:13.566 --> 00:42:14.566 A:middle
addition to what you already

00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:15.966 A:middle
have inside the entitlement

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:16.306 A:middle
file.

00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:18.936 A:middle
The associated domain's array

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.466 A:middle
has to be present and not empty,

00:42:22.466 --> 00:42:23.546 A:middle
and you can even have other

00:42:23.546 --> 00:42:24.866 A:middle
values in there already, and we

00:42:24.866 --> 00:42:26.936 A:middle
will pin the ones from the MDM

00:42:26.936 --> 00:42:28.426 A:middle
into the list there for you to

00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:29.506 A:middle
use.

00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:31.866 A:middle
For more details on associated

00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:33.996 A:middle
domains, how to use them, check

00:42:33.996 --> 00:42:35.306 A:middle
out the What's New in Universal

00:42:35.306 --> 00:42:36.406 A:middle
Links session in this year's

00:42:36.406 --> 00:42:36.956 A:middle
conference.

00:42:41.216 --> 00:42:42.146 A:middle
All right, and that completes

00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:43.246 A:middle
redirect extensions.

00:42:44.366 --> 00:42:45.096 A:middle
So, now let's shift to

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:46.276 A:middle
credential extensions.

00:42:48.936 --> 00:42:50.346 A:middle
Credential extensions are

00:42:50.346 --> 00:42:50.876 A:middle
intended for

00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.486 A:middle
challenge-response-type

00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:53.896 A:middle
authentication flows, and a

00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:54.926 A:middle
great example of this is

00:42:54.926 --> 00:42:55.566 A:middle
Kerberos.

00:42:56.876 --> 00:42:58.296 A:middle
These flows are different than

00:42:58.296 --> 00:43:00.176 A:middle
redirects, because the client

00:42:58.296 --> 00:43:00.176 A:middle
redirects, because the client

00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:01.606 A:middle
will request the data and then

00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.566 A:middle
they are challenged for

00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:03.326 A:middle
authentication.

00:43:04.446 --> 00:43:07.286 A:middle
Whereas redirect extensions, the

00:43:07.286 --> 00:43:08.906 A:middle
client will proactively go out

00:43:08.906 --> 00:43:10.496 A:middle
and retrieve tokens before

00:43:10.496 --> 00:43:12.296 A:middle
they're needed and then use

00:43:12.296 --> 00:43:12.466 A:middle
them.

00:43:14.056 --> 00:43:15.136 A:middle
We also support custom

00:43:15.136 --> 00:43:16.626 A:middle
authentication challenges for

00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:17.486 A:middle
this.

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:20.836 A:middle
Credential extensions are

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:21.696 A:middle
different in redirect

00:43:21.696 --> 00:43:23.446 A:middle
extensions, in that they receive

00:43:23.446 --> 00:43:24.756 A:middle
HTTP challenge from the

00:43:24.756 --> 00:43:25.936 A:middle
operating system and not the

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:26.506 A:middle
request.

00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:29.156 A:middle
The challenge will include the

00:43:29.156 --> 00:43:30.586 A:middle
URL and the headers that were

00:43:30.586 --> 00:43:31.116 A:middle
returned.

00:43:31.616 --> 00:43:34.136 A:middle
The MDM profile will contain a

00:43:34.136 --> 00:43:36.896 A:middle
list of hosts or host suffixes

00:43:37.476 --> 00:43:38.936 A:middle
that applies to that extension.

00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.176 A:middle
So, for example, if you have

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:43.246 A:middle
.example.com, it'll be treated

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:44.736 A:middle
as a suffix.

00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:47.606 A:middle
Operations are also supported

00:43:47.606 --> 00:43:49.286 A:middle
for credential-mode extensions,

00:43:50.356 --> 00:43:51.756 A:middle
and there's not an associated

00:43:51.756 --> 00:43:55.576 A:middle
domain requirement for them.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.696 A:middle
Okay, so let's check out the

00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:57.036 A:middle
flow.

00:43:58.436 --> 00:43:59.986 A:middle
In Safari, or your native app,

00:43:59.986 --> 00:44:01.116 A:middle
it'll make a request to a

00:43:59.986 --> 00:44:01.116 A:middle
it'll make a request to a

00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:01.586 A:middle
server.

00:44:02.756 --> 00:44:04.216 A:middle
The server will return an

00:44:04.216 --> 00:44:06.676 A:middle
authentication challenge back to

00:44:06.676 --> 00:44:07.796 A:middle
the operating system, which we

00:44:07.796 --> 00:44:08.946 A:middle
will route to the extension.

00:44:10.006 --> 00:44:11.346 A:middle
Just like the other extensions,

00:44:11.346 --> 00:44:14.126 A:middle
it is required that it completes

00:44:14.126 --> 00:44:15.516 A:middle
the authentication process with

00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:17.166 A:middle
the identity provider or the

00:44:17.166 --> 00:44:18.726 A:middle
authentication servers, whatever

00:44:18.726 --> 00:44:20.726 A:middle
it may be.

00:44:20.966 --> 00:44:22.546 A:middle
And when ready, the extension

00:44:22.546 --> 00:44:25.416 A:middle
will return the headers back to

00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:26.496 A:middle
the operating system, which will

00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:27.936 A:middle
get sent back to the server, and

00:44:28.436 --> 00:44:29.916 A:middle
assuming the server accepts it,

00:44:30.086 --> 00:44:31.236 A:middle
the data will be returned back

00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:33.026 A:middle
to the calling app that's

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:33.336 A:middle
needed.

00:44:33.606 --> 00:44:36.356 A:middle
And that's the flow for

00:44:36.356 --> 00:44:37.466 A:middle
credential extensions.

00:44:37.946 --> 00:44:39.516 A:middle
And now for a demo of credential

00:44:39.516 --> 00:44:40.556 A:middle
mode extensions, I'd like to

00:44:40.556 --> 00:44:42.016 A:middle
call my colleague, Rick Lemmon.

00:44:42.256 --> 00:44:42.486 A:middle
Rick?

00:44:43.516 --> 00:44:47.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:49.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks a lot, Matt.

00:44:49.906 --> 00:44:51.306 A:middle
Hi everybody, my name's Rick

00:44:51.306 --> 00:44:52.616 A:middle
Lemmon, and I'm an engineer on

00:44:52.616 --> 00:44:53.866 A:middle
the Apple Professional Services

00:44:53.866 --> 00:44:54.026 A:middle
Team.

00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:56.386 A:middle
Today, I'd like to demonstrate a

00:44:56.386 --> 00:44:57.726 A:middle
credential mode extension to you

00:44:58.536 --> 00:44:59.136 A:middle
that we've built.

00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:01.246 A:middle
This extension makes it easy for

00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:01.246 A:middle
This extension makes it easy for

00:45:01.246 --> 00:45:02.886 A:middle
users to use Single Sign-On with

00:45:02.886 --> 00:45:04.086 A:middle
your apps and websites.

00:45:04.896 --> 00:45:06.046 A:middle
If you develop a Single Sign-On

00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:08.056 A:middle
extension, you'll probably

00:45:08.056 --> 00:45:09.436 A:middle
deliver it to your users as part

00:45:09.436 --> 00:45:10.506 A:middle
of an app.

00:45:10.506 --> 00:45:12.256 A:middle
So, this app can be used to

00:45:12.256 --> 00:45:13.836 A:middle
deliver functionality that might

00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:14.936 A:middle
not make sense to deliver in

00:45:14.936 --> 00:45:17.456 A:middle
your extension, such as

00:45:17.456 --> 00:45:18.986 A:middle
displaying status information to

00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:20.486 A:middle
the user or allowing them to

00:45:20.486 --> 00:45:21.656 A:middle
change their password.

00:45:22.276 --> 00:45:24.036 A:middle
In our extension, what we've

00:45:24.036 --> 00:45:25.676 A:middle
done is use a menu extra to do

00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:25.846 A:middle
this.

00:45:25.846 --> 00:45:26.876 A:middle
So, that's a little great key

00:45:26.876 --> 00:45:27.676 A:middle
that we see up here.

00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:30.136 A:middle
So, what I'd like to do now is

00:45:30.136 --> 00:45:31.286 A:middle
go ahead and sign into the

00:45:31.286 --> 00:45:31.686 A:middle
extension.

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:33.966 A:middle
Let's go ahead and sign in.

00:45:34.556 --> 00:45:36.186 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and enter

00:45:36.186 --> 00:45:37.216 A:middle
my username and password.

00:45:43.056 --> 00:45:45.206 A:middle
And click sign in.

00:45:45.586 --> 00:45:47.276 A:middle
Great. Now we're signed in.

00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:48.926 A:middle
So, let's go back and look at

00:45:48.926 --> 00:45:49.576 A:middle
the menu extra.

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:52.516 A:middle
You'll notice in the menu extra,

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.786 A:middle
we're now displaying some useful

00:45:53.786 --> 00:45:55.156 A:middle
status information to the user,

00:45:55.906 --> 00:45:57.056 A:middle
like the user that we're signed

00:45:57.056 --> 00:45:58.396 A:middle
in as and when our password

00:45:58.396 --> 00:45:58.956 A:middle
expires.

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:00.706 A:middle
We also exposed some useful

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:00.706 A:middle
We also exposed some useful

00:46:00.706 --> 00:46:01.996 A:middle
functionality, like the ability

00:46:01.996 --> 00:46:03.336 A:middle
to change your password and sign

00:46:03.336 --> 00:46:03.526 A:middle
out.

00:46:04.946 --> 00:46:06.466 A:middle
But now that we're signed into

00:46:06.466 --> 00:46:08.136 A:middle
the Single Sign-On extension, we

00:46:08.136 --> 00:46:09.746 A:middle
can use Single Sign-On to access

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:10.786 A:middle
websites and apps.

00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:12.176 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and try a

00:46:12.176 --> 00:46:13.516 A:middle
sample website that we've built.

00:46:14.456 --> 00:46:16.616 A:middle
Let's go ahead and, well, load

00:46:16.616 --> 00:46:17.416 A:middle
the sample website.

00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:20.246 A:middle
And, excellent.

00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:21.766 A:middle
You've seen that we've just used

00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:23.046 A:middle
Single Sign-On to access this

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:24.116 A:middle
website, and you'll notice, I

00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:25.506 A:middle
wasn't prompted to authenticate.

00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:26.936 A:middle
We can see that I'm

00:46:26.936 --> 00:46:28.456 A:middle
authenticated as the same user

00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:30.896 A:middle
that I used to sign into the

00:46:30.896 --> 00:46:31.656 A:middle
extension earlier.

00:46:32.766 --> 00:46:35.136 A:middle
Let's go ahead and quit Safari,

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.626 A:middle
and let's show you how this

00:46:36.626 --> 00:46:37.936 A:middle
works from an app.

00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:39.626 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and launch

00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:40.956 A:middle
an app called Image Retriever

00:46:40.956 --> 00:46:41.986 A:middle
that we wrote for this demo.

00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:43.756 A:middle
This app is really simple.

00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:46.036 A:middle
All that it does is connect to a

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.376 A:middle
web server that typically

00:46:47.376 --> 00:46:48.566 A:middle
requires authentication,

00:46:48.846 --> 00:46:50.696 A:middle
download an image, and displays

00:46:50.696 --> 00:46:51.096 A:middle
it.

00:46:52.236 --> 00:46:54.466 A:middle
Now normally, you'd have to

00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:55.366 A:middle
implement some sort of

00:46:55.366 --> 00:46:56.656 A:middle
authentication for this app to

00:46:56.656 --> 00:46:57.986 A:middle
work, but since we have Single

00:46:57.986 --> 00:46:59.086 A:middle
Sign-On and in place, we don't

00:46:59.086 --> 00:46:59.236 A:middle
need to.

00:46:59.236 --> 00:46:59.776 A:middle
Let me go ahead and click

00:46:59.776 --> 00:46:59.976 A:middle
display.

00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:03.756 A:middle
Excellent.

00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:05.556 A:middle
As you might guess, based on my

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.876 A:middle
last name, I have something of a

00:47:06.876 --> 00:47:07.846 A:middle
soft spot for lemons.

00:47:07.846 --> 00:47:09.316 A:middle
So, our app has gone out,

00:47:09.386 --> 00:47:10.656 A:middle
connected to a web server,

00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.256 A:middle
authenticated using our Single

00:47:12.256 --> 00:47:13.586 A:middle
Sign-On extension, and

00:47:13.586 --> 00:47:14.706 A:middle
downloaded this super-sweet

00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:15.866 A:middle
image of lemons.

[ Applause ]

00:47:19.046 --> 00:47:19.246 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:47:22.226 --> 00:47:24.366 A:middle
So, let me quit Image Retriever

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.516 A:middle
now, and I'm going to show you

00:47:25.516 --> 00:47:26.826 A:middle
guys some ways that

00:47:26.826 --> 00:47:28.306 A:middle
authentication to the extension

00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:28.966 A:middle
can be triggered.

00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:31.456 A:middle
To do that, I'll need to sign

00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:32.616 A:middle
out of the extension, which I'll

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:33.866 A:middle
do here in the menu extra.

00:47:33.866 --> 00:47:36.506 A:middle
Now just a note, your users, if

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:38.366 A:middle
you make an extension, will need

00:47:38.366 --> 00:47:40.316 A:middle
to sign out of the extension.

00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:41.676 A:middle
We're just doing this purely for

00:47:41.676 --> 00:47:42.776 A:middle
demonstration purposes.

00:47:43.586 --> 00:47:45.836 A:middle
So, now that I signed out, let's

00:47:45.836 --> 00:47:47.136 A:middle
go ahead and launch Safari.

00:47:48.716 --> 00:47:49.826 A:middle
I'll go ahead and click on our

00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:50.336 A:middle
website.

00:47:51.266 --> 00:47:52.626 A:middle
You'll notice I was immediately

00:47:52.626 --> 00:47:54.006 A:middle
prompted to authenticate, which

00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:54.766 A:middle
I'll go ahead and do.

00:47:59.446 --> 00:48:00.746 A:middle
And we'll click sign in.

00:47:59.446 --> 00:48:00.746 A:middle
And we'll click sign in.

00:48:02.126 --> 00:48:02.526 A:middle
Excellent.

00:48:02.926 --> 00:48:03.996 A:middle
You'll notice that as soon as I

00:48:03.996 --> 00:48:05.486 A:middle
signed in, Safari was able to

00:48:05.486 --> 00:48:06.916 A:middle
seamlessly authenticate and load

00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:07.496 A:middle
my website.

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:09.186 A:middle
So, I'll go ahead and quit

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:09.636 A:middle
Safari.

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:12.186 A:middle
I will sign out of the

00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:13.706 A:middle
extension, and we'll try the

00:48:13.706 --> 00:48:14.766 A:middle
image retriever app again.

00:48:16.106 --> 00:48:17.516 A:middle
Let's go ahead and click display

00:48:17.636 --> 00:48:18.526 A:middle
to make the image load.

00:48:19.536 --> 00:48:20.486 A:middle
You'll notice I'm prompted

00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:20.766 A:middle
again.

00:48:26.396 --> 00:48:27.026 A:middle
We'll sign in.

00:48:28.816 --> 00:48:29.746 A:middle
Excellent.

00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:30.926 A:middle
Our image of lemons downloaded

00:48:30.926 --> 00:48:31.166 A:middle
again.

00:48:31.236 --> 00:48:31.976 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:48:38.796 --> 00:48:40.016 A:middle
Great. So, let's talk a little

00:48:40.016 --> 00:48:41.386 A:middle
bit more about this particular

00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:41.836 A:middle
extension.

00:48:42.346 --> 00:48:44.156 A:middle
So, some of you might see this

00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:45.636 A:middle
extension and say, you know

00:48:45.636 --> 00:48:46.116 A:middle
what?

00:48:46.116 --> 00:48:47.426 A:middle
This could be useful in my own

00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:48.116 A:middle
organization.

00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:50.216 A:middle
Well, we agree with you.

00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:51.966 A:middle
One thing that we haven't told

00:48:51.966 --> 00:48:53.436 A:middle
you yet is that this extension,

00:48:53.436 --> 00:48:54.706 A:middle
behind the scenes, is using

00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:56.246 A:middle
Kerberos and Active Directory.

00:48:57.386 --> 00:48:58.956 A:middle
And so, we're thrilled to

00:48:58.956 --> 00:49:02.046 A:middle
announce that this extension

00:48:58.956 --> 00:49:02.046 A:middle
announce that this extension

00:49:02.046 --> 00:49:03.506 A:middle
will be included with macOS

00:49:03.506 --> 00:49:05.866 A:middle
Catalina, iOS13, and iPadOS.

[ Applause ]

00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:13.986 A:middle
Thank you.

00:49:14.156 --> 00:49:15.776 A:middle
This extension is based on

00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:17.376 A:middle
Enterprise Connect, an Active

00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:18.846 A:middle
Directory integration solution

00:49:18.846 --> 00:49:20.066 A:middle
that some of you may already be

00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:20.466 A:middle
using.

00:49:20.766 --> 00:49:22.496 A:middle
It provides an easy way to

00:49:22.496 --> 00:49:23.576 A:middle
integrate your devices with

00:49:23.576 --> 00:49:24.366 A:middle
Active Directory.

00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.716 A:middle
On top of providing Kerberos

00:49:26.716 --> 00:49:28.316 A:middle
support, it helps you manage

00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:30.046 A:middle
your Active Directory password,

00:49:30.276 --> 00:49:32.076 A:middle
and on macOS, helps you keep

00:49:32.076 --> 00:49:33.356 A:middle
your local and active directory

00:49:33.356 --> 00:49:34.326 A:middle
passwords in sync.

00:49:35.086 --> 00:49:37.036 A:middle
Also, on top of authenticating

00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:37.946 A:middle
through the extension with the

00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:39.726 A:middle
username and password, you can

00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:40.836 A:middle
use the certificate-based

00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:42.756 A:middle
identity, or on macOS, you can

00:49:42.756 --> 00:49:43.496 A:middle
use a smart card.

00:49:44.286 --> 00:49:45.356 A:middle
We think this extension will

00:49:45.356 --> 00:49:47.026 A:middle
help many of you more easily use

00:49:47.056 --> 00:49:48.476 A:middle
Kerberos and Active Directory in

00:49:48.476 --> 00:49:49.486 A:middle
your organizations.

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:52.636 A:middle
And that concludes

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:53.766 A:middle
credential-based Single Sign-On

00:49:53.766 --> 00:49:54.386 A:middle
extensions.

00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:57.376 A:middle
So, let's summarize.

00:49:57.946 --> 00:49:59.196 A:middle
We're really looking forward to

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.446 A:middle
seeing what kind of extensions

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.446 A:middle
seeing what kind of extensions

00:50:00.446 --> 00:50:02.236 A:middle
you built, out the Single

00:50:02.236 --> 00:50:03.996 A:middle

00:50:03.996 --> 00:50:05.206 A:middle
detail on making your own

00:50:05.206 --> 00:50:05.786 A:middle

00:50:05.886 --> 00:50:07.926 A:middle
It will be posted to the WWDC

00:50:07.926 --> 00:50:09.396 A:middle
site after the conference, and

00:50:09.396 --> 00:50:10.436 A:middle
now I'll hand it back to Todd.

Rick.

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:20.836 A:middle
Just have a few more words about

00:50:20.836 --> 00:50:22.696 A:middle
associated domains, which, as

00:50:22.696 --> 00:50:24.426 A:middle
Matt explained, can be managed

00:50:24.426 --> 00:50:25.986 A:middle
via MDM, but they're not just

00:50:25.986 --> 00:50:26.956 A:middle
for Single Sign On.

00:50:27.726 --> 00:50:30.006 A:middle
Other service types, such as

00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:31.906 A:middle
universal links and password

00:50:31.906 --> 00:50:33.556 A:middle
autofill, are also supported by

00:50:33.556 --> 00:50:35.796 A:middle
associated domains, and they're

00:50:35.796 --> 00:50:37.436 A:middle
now also supported by custom

00:50:37.566 --> 00:50:39.246 A:middle
apps, not just App Store apps.

00:50:39.976 --> 00:50:41.196 A:middle
So again, if you'd like to learn

00:50:41.196 --> 00:50:42.626 A:middle
more about them, check out the

00:50:42.626 --> 00:50:43.866 A:middle

00:50:43.866 --> 00:50:44.656 A:middle
earlier this week.

00:50:45.266 --> 00:50:47.836 A:middle
Now I mentioned federated

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.086 A:middle
authentication earlier in the

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:50.246 A:middle
session, but I wanted to

00:50:50.246 --> 00:50:51.636 A:middle
highlight it here again, because

00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:53.156 A:middle
it, along with a number of the

00:50:53.156 --> 00:50:54.296 A:middle
other things we've announced

00:50:54.376 --> 00:50:56.516 A:middle
here this morning, come together

00:50:56.516 --> 00:50:57.946 A:middle
is a great example of how we

00:50:57.946 --> 00:50:59.776 A:middle
enable Apple devices to fit in

00:50:59.776 --> 00:51:00.826 A:middle
while standing out in your

Managed Apple IDs coming to ABM

00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:07.726 A:middle
and User Enrollment requiring

00:51:07.726 --> 00:51:10.506 A:middle
Managed Apple ID means that

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:11.736 A:middle
we've made it really easy for

00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:13.016 A:middle
you to take advantage of user

that you're already using.

00:51:17.456 --> 00:51:19.136 A:middle
Now we've spent a lot of time

00:51:19.136 --> 00:51:20.476 A:middle
today talking about the new, hot

00:51:20.656 --> 00:51:21.696 A:middle
user enrollment, and that's

00:51:21.696 --> 00:51:22.986 A:middle
great, but of course, we haven't

00:51:22.986 --> 00:51:24.306 A:middle
stopped improving device

00:51:24.306 --> 00:51:25.156 A:middle
enrollment either.

00:51:26.106 --> 00:51:27.376 A:middle
So, I want to talk about a great

00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:28.406 A:middle

right inside of Setup Assistant

as they're enrolling their

custom web UI that you can use

00:51:42.596 --> 00:51:43.806 A:middle
for a number of important

00:51:43.806 --> 00:51:45.996 A:middle
purposes from choosing the

authentication type you want to

00:51:47.206 --> 00:51:48.216 A:middle
use, something modern,

00:51:48.216 --> 00:51:49.726 A:middle
multifactor, whatever works for

00:51:49.726 --> 00:51:51.576 A:middle
your organization, custom

00:51:53.686 --> 00:51:55.066 A:middle
whatever additional information

00:51:55.066 --> 00:51:57.246 A:middle
you want users to have access to

00:51:57.476 --> 00:51:58.846 A:middle
while they're enrolling, again,

00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:00.166 A:middle
right in Setup Assistant,

00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:00.166 A:middle
right in Setup Assistant,

00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.266 A:middle
whether it's your privacy

00:52:01.266 --> 00:52:03.846 A:middle
policy, additional consent text,

And just to give you an idea,

00:52:07.196 --> 00:52:08.186 A:middle
again, this should look very

00:52:08.186 --> 00:52:10.736 A:middle
familiar, but instead of seeing

00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:13.016 A:middle
our off UI on the next pane in

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:14.706 A:middle
Setup Assistant, you can see

00:52:14.706 --> 00:52:15.496 A:middle
your UI.

00:52:16.556 --> 00:52:18.146 A:middle
Here's an example on the Mac of

00:52:18.146 --> 00:52:19.056 A:middle
authentication.

This is really exciting.

00:52:23.726 --> 00:52:25.676 A:middle
And in the iPhone, an example,

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:26.876 A:middle
Acceptable Use Policy.

00:52:26.946 --> 00:52:28.496 A:middle
Basically, this just gives you a

00:52:28.496 --> 00:52:30.806 A:middle
way to give your users the exact

00:52:30.806 --> 00:52:32.346 A:middle
right experience for them in

00:52:32.346 --> 00:52:33.476 A:middle
your organization.

00:52:35.836 --> 00:52:37.296 A:middle
I mentioned content caching

00:52:37.296 --> 00:52:37.856 A:middle
earlier.

00:52:37.856 --> 00:52:39.356 A:middle
This is a great way to optimize

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.746 A:middle
how your organization uses its

00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:43.766 A:middle
bandwidth, and to date, it's

00:52:43.856 --> 00:52:45.856 A:middle
been a best-effort optimization.

00:52:46.126 --> 00:52:47.446 A:middle
But now it's possible to

00:52:47.446 --> 00:52:48.716 A:middle
configure it, as required

00:52:48.716 --> 00:52:50.256 A:middle
infrastructure for all devices

00:52:50.256 --> 00:52:51.616 A:middle
on your network, if that's what

00:52:51.616 --> 00:52:52.906 A:middle
works for your organization.

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:54.806 A:middle
And you can also configure

00:52:54.806 --> 00:52:56.846 A:middle
devices to prefer specific

00:52:56.846 --> 00:52:57.986 A:middle
client caches.

00:52:59.496 --> 00:53:01.626 A:middle
Now, of course, there's lots of

00:52:59.496 --> 00:53:01.626 A:middle
Now, of course, there's lots of

00:53:01.626 --> 00:53:02.546 A:middle
other things we've added this

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.966 A:middle
year, just like always, enabling

00:53:03.966 --> 00:53:04.886 A:middle
you to configure the Setup

00:53:04.886 --> 00:53:06.206 A:middle
Assistant and lots of other

00:53:06.206 --> 00:53:08.046 A:middle
settings and restrictions, and

00:53:08.396 --> 00:53:09.716 A:middle
that's really great, but I think

00:53:09.716 --> 00:53:10.656 A:middle
we should really read the

00:53:10.656 --> 00:53:12.176 A:middle
documentation together instead

00:53:12.176 --> 00:53:15.136 A:middle
of hearing me talk about it.

00:53:15.136 --> 00:53:17.096 A:middle
Because we are so excited about

00:53:17.186 --> 00:53:18.716 A:middle
the giant leap forward we made

00:53:18.716 --> 00:53:20.186 A:middle
in giving you what you deserve,

00:53:20.186 --> 00:53:21.776 A:middle
comprehensive, up-to-date

00:53:21.776 --> 00:53:24.256 A:middle
documentation, both because

00:53:24.256 --> 00:53:25.276 A:middle
we've improved our internal

00:53:25.276 --> 00:53:27.756 A:middle
processes, allowing us to import

00:53:27.756 --> 00:53:29.566 A:middle
our new keys and values that we

00:53:29.566 --> 00:53:31.506 A:middle
add to the profile payloads and

00:53:31.506 --> 00:53:33.196 A:middle
MDM commands directly from our

00:53:33.196 --> 00:53:35.526 A:middle
code into the documentation, and

00:53:35.526 --> 00:53:36.796 A:middle
then showing that documentation

00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.476 A:middle
to you just like all other Apple

00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:40.666 A:middle
documentation, including a great

00:53:40.666 --> 00:53:42.246 A:middle
way to highlight the changes

00:53:42.246 --> 00:53:43.726 A:middle
introduced in a particular OS

00:53:43.726 --> 00:53:44.736 A:middle
release.

00:53:44.806 --> 00:53:45.856 A:middle
We think this will make it much

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:47.046 A:middle
easier for you to adopt

00:53:47.046 --> 00:53:48.066 A:middle
everything we've talked about

00:53:48.066 --> 00:53:49.686 A:middle
today and in the future more

00:53:49.686 --> 00:53:51.326 A:middle
quickly for all of our joint

00:53:51.326 --> 00:53:52.626 A:middle
customers to take advantage of.

00:53:53.436 --> 00:53:54.396 A:middle
But instead of me talking about

00:53:54.396 --> 00:53:55.756 A:middle
it anymore, I'd like to ask

00:53:55.756 --> 00:53:57.286 A:middle
Graham McLuhan to come on stage

00:53:57.366 --> 00:53:58.156 A:middle
and show it to you.

00:53:58.386 --> 00:53:58.726 A:middle
Graham?

00:54:00.516 --> 00:54:04.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:54:07.056 --> 00:54:07.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Todd.

00:54:07.976 --> 00:54:08.966 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:54:08.966 --> 00:54:10.076 A:middle
today to show you the latest

00:54:10.076 --> 00:54:11.646 A:middle
device management documentation.

00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:13.696 A:middle
Who's had a chance to check out

00:54:13.696 --> 00:54:14.696 A:middle
the new documentation?

00:54:15.946 --> 00:54:17.116 A:middle
Yeah, all right, it's really

00:54:17.116 --> 00:54:17.386 A:middle
great.

00:54:17.906 --> 00:54:19.036 A:middle
So, for those of you who haven't

00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:20.016 A:middle
had a chance to check it out,

00:54:20.016 --> 00:54:21.086 A:middle
let's take a look.

00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:22.896 A:middle
So, the first thing that you'll

00:54:22.896 --> 00:54:23.946 A:middle
notice is that the device

00:54:23.946 --> 00:54:25.586 A:middle
management documentation has a

00:54:25.586 --> 00:54:27.316 A:middle
new home alongside the rest of

00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:28.116 A:middle
the Apple developer

00:54:28.116 --> 00:54:28.936 A:middle
documentation.

00:54:29.916 --> 00:54:31.266 A:middle
Clicking in, you'll see all of

00:54:31.266 --> 00:54:32.076 A:middle
the things that you're used to

00:54:32.076 --> 00:54:33.776 A:middle
seeing, configuration profiles,

00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:36.106 A:middle
MDM protocol, and deployment

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:36.646 A:middle
services.

00:54:37.286 --> 00:54:38.096 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:54:38.096 --> 00:54:39.356 A:middle
configuration profiles.

00:54:41.246 --> 00:54:42.146 A:middle
Here you'll see an

00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:43.896 A:middle
easy-to-search list of all of

00:54:43.896 --> 00:54:45.056 A:middle
the different profiles that are

00:54:45.056 --> 00:54:46.026 A:middle
available on all of our

00:54:46.026 --> 00:54:46.646 A:middle
platforms.

00:54:47.376 --> 00:54:48.306 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:50.036 A:middle
ExchangeActiveSync payload.

00:54:52.016 --> 00:54:52.816 A:middle
The first thing I'd like to

00:54:52.816 --> 00:54:54.666 A:middle
point out here is the Show API

00:54:54.836 --> 00:54:56.936 A:middle
Changes option, where you'll be

00:54:56.936 --> 00:54:58.296 A:middle
able to see the differences

00:54:58.296 --> 00:54:59.806 A:middle
between the current OS release

00:55:00.256 --> 00:55:01.356 A:middle
and the upcoming beta.

00:55:03.206 --> 00:55:03.906 A:middle
Yes, great.

00:55:04.516 --> 00:55:06.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:55:07.046 --> 00:55:08.316 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you can

00:55:08.356 --> 00:55:09.236 A:middle
see there's been one

00:55:09.236 --> 00:55:10.916 A:middle
modification to an existing key

00:55:11.286 --> 00:55:12.796 A:middle
and 12 new keys added.

00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:14.976 A:middle
As a note, to find out which

00:55:14.976 --> 00:55:16.606 A:middle
Xcode versions relate to which

00:55:16.606 --> 00:55:18.136 A:middle
OS releases, you can check the

00:55:18.136 --> 00:55:19.136 A:middle
Xcode release notes.

00:55:20.446 --> 00:55:21.746 A:middle
Below that, in the property

00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:23.466 A:middle
section, you can see all the

00:55:23.466 --> 00:55:25.616 A:middle
keys, their types, and their

00:55:25.616 --> 00:55:26.946 A:middle
default values that make up the

00:55:26.946 --> 00:55:27.506 A:middle
payload.

00:55:28.606 --> 00:55:30.606 A:middle
As we scroll down, you can see

00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:32.416 A:middle
that the keys are highlighted

00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:34.576 A:middle
with purple tildes are modified

00:55:34.576 --> 00:55:36.976 A:middle
keys, and the new keys that

00:55:36.976 --> 00:55:38.316 A:middle
we've added are highlighted with

00:55:38.316 --> 00:55:39.386 A:middle
the green plus sign.

00:55:41.156 --> 00:55:42.876 A:middle
Below that, we have a profile

00:55:42.876 --> 00:55:44.456 A:middle
availability table that shows

00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:45.326 A:middle
you all of the different

00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:46.446 A:middle
platforms the payload is

00:55:46.446 --> 00:55:48.286 A:middle
supported on, and below that, we

00:55:48.286 --> 00:55:49.756 A:middle
have related objects, such as

00:55:49.756 --> 00:55:50.886 A:middle
dictionaries, that make up the

00:55:50.886 --> 00:55:52.976 A:middle
payload, as well as other

00:55:52.976 --> 00:55:54.076 A:middle
related payloads you may be

00:55:54.076 --> 00:55:56.286 A:middle
interested in.

00:55:57.136 --> 00:55:59.736 A:middle
So, let's jump back to the

00:55:59.736 --> 00:56:01.226 A:middle
top-level device management page

00:55:59.736 --> 00:56:01.226 A:middle
top-level device management page

00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:02.716 A:middle
using the breadcrumbs at the top

00:56:02.716 --> 00:56:03.176 A:middle
of the page.

00:56:04.016 --> 00:56:05.476 A:middle
Now, with the Show API Changes

00:56:05.476 --> 00:56:07.046 A:middle
enabled, we can also see that

00:56:07.046 --> 00:56:07.996 A:middle
there have been some changes to

00:56:07.996 --> 00:56:08.956 A:middle
the MDM protocol.

00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:09.986 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:56:11.856 --> 00:56:12.816 A:middle
Here you'll find it

00:56:12.816 --> 00:56:14.296 A:middle
easy-to-search list of all of

00:56:14.296 --> 00:56:16.026 A:middle
the different commands and

00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:17.186 A:middle
queries that are available.

00:56:17.756 --> 00:56:19.056 A:middle
Let's take a look at the install

00:56:19.056 --> 00:56:19.996 A:middle
application command.

00:56:20.856 --> 00:56:24.046 A:middle
On the right-hand side, you'll

00:56:24.046 --> 00:56:25.376 A:middle
notice that we list all of the

00:56:25.376 --> 00:56:27.166 A:middle
platforms and the corresponding

00:56:27.166 --> 00:56:28.466 A:middle
OS releases where this feature

00:56:28.466 --> 00:56:28.966 A:middle
was added.

00:56:30.236 --> 00:56:31.426 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you can

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.826 A:middle
see that we document the command

00:56:32.826 --> 00:56:34.986 A:middle
itself, as well as the response,

00:56:36.216 --> 00:56:37.876 A:middle
and below that, on the command

00:56:37.876 --> 00:56:39.266 A:middle
availability table, that shows

00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:40.426 A:middle
you all the different ways that

00:56:40.426 --> 00:56:41.786 A:middle
this command can be implemented.

00:56:42.656 --> 00:56:43.816 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:56:43.816 --> 00:56:45.246 A:middle
actual MDM command itself.

00:56:50.766 --> 00:56:51.926 A:middle
All right, here, you can see a

00:56:51.926 --> 00:56:53.336 A:middle
list of all of the keys that

00:56:53.336 --> 00:56:54.856 A:middle
make up the install application

00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:55.286 A:middle
command.

00:56:55.786 --> 00:56:58.146 A:middle
So finally, I'd like to talk a

00:56:58.146 --> 00:56:58.986 A:middle
little bit about how we've

00:56:58.986 --> 00:57:00.286 A:middle
documented the changes for user

00:56:58.986 --> 00:57:00.286 A:middle
documented the changes for user

00:57:00.286 --> 00:57:00.776 A:middle
enrollments.

00:57:01.396 --> 00:57:02.856 A:middle
The availability tables are a

00:57:02.856 --> 00:57:04.176 A:middle
great way for you to see if a

00:57:04.476 --> 00:57:05.686 A:middle
feature is supported in User

00:57:05.686 --> 00:57:07.506 A:middle
Enrollment, but in some cases,

00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:08.706 A:middle
we've had to change the way that

00:57:08.706 --> 00:57:10.816 A:middle
specific keys behave, and the

00:57:10.816 --> 00:57:12.216 A:middle
restrictions payload is a great

00:57:12.216 --> 00:57:13.296 A:middle
example of this.

00:57:14.746 --> 00:57:15.896 A:middle
So here, you can see that we've

00:57:15.896 --> 00:57:17.756 A:middle
added help text to each key to

00:57:17.756 --> 00:57:18.976 A:middle
tell you how it can be used.

00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:20.946 A:middle
The Allow Account Modification

00:57:20.946 --> 00:57:22.576 A:middle
restriction, for example, can be

00:57:22.576 --> 00:57:24.646 A:middle
used on a supervised device and

00:57:24.646 --> 00:57:26.586 A:middle
is available on iOS 7 or later.

00:57:27.596 --> 00:57:28.746 A:middle
We know that for BYOD

00:57:28.746 --> 00:57:30.566 A:middle
enrollments, Managed Open In is

00:57:30.566 --> 00:57:31.706 A:middle
one of our most important

00:57:31.706 --> 00:57:32.266 A:middle
restrictions.

00:57:32.776 --> 00:57:33.966 A:middle
So, let's take a look how that's

00:57:33.996 --> 00:57:34.886 A:middle
been implemented.

00:57:35.616 --> 00:57:37.096 A:middle
Here you can see that this is

00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:39.966 A:middle
available for iOS 7 or later and

00:57:40.276 --> 00:57:41.576 A:middle
also available for user

00:57:41.576 --> 00:57:42.036 A:middle
enrollments.

00:57:42.466 --> 00:57:44.086 A:middle
Well, we're really excited for

00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:45.056 A:middle
you take a look at all this new

00:57:45.056 --> 00:57:46.746 A:middle
documentation, and with that, a

00:57:46.746 --> 00:57:47.656 A:middle
hand it back to you, Todd.

00:57:48.516 --> 00:57:51.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:57:51.626 --> 00:57:52.636 A:middle
Thank you very much, Graham.

00:57:53.926 --> 00:57:55.196 A:middle
Again, we're really excited for

00:57:55.196 --> 00:57:56.746 A:middle
this and hope you will go check

00:57:56.746 --> 00:57:57.836 A:middle
it out if you haven't already.

00:57:57.836 --> 00:57:59.046 A:middle
It's been live since Monday.

00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.836 A:middle
All right, will that brings us

00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.836 A:middle
All right, will that brings us

00:58:01.836 --> 00:58:03.236 A:middle
to the end of our content.

00:58:03.296 --> 00:58:04.896 A:middle
So again, we hope that new

00:58:04.896 --> 00:58:06.086 A:middle
documentation makes it much

00:58:06.086 --> 00:58:07.076 A:middle
easier for you to support

00:58:07.076 --> 00:58:08.196 A:middle
everything new, which of course,

00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:10.026 A:middle
we want you to do, and stop

00:58:10.026 --> 00:58:12.186 A:middle
relying on UserAgent string or

00:58:12.186 --> 00:58:13.126 A:middle
installing supervised

00:58:13.126 --> 00:58:14.816 A:middle
restrictions on unsupervised

00:58:14.816 --> 00:58:15.496 A:middle
devices.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:18.706 A:middle
There's a lot of helpful links

00:58:18.706 --> 00:58:20.176 A:middle
to that documentation, as well

00:58:20.176 --> 00:58:21.596 A:middle
as many other resources at the

00:58:21.596 --> 00:58:23.736 A:middle
session URL on-screen.

00:58:23.996 --> 00:58:25.176 A:middle
Come see us in the lab after

00:58:25.176 --> 00:58:26.896 A:middle
lunch, and check out those

00:58:26.896 --> 00:58:27.886 A:middle
sessions that we referred to

00:58:27.886 --> 00:58:29.176 A:middle
during the session on universal

00:58:29.176 --> 00:58:31.186 A:middle
links and desktop browsing on

00:58:31.436 --> 00:58:32.976 A:middle
iPad.

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:33.846 A:middle
I want to thank all of you for

00:58:33.846 --> 00:58:34.846 A:middle
coming out this morning.

00:58:34.846 --> 00:58:35.936 A:middle
I hope you enjoy the rest of

00:58:35.936 --> 00:58:38.626 A:middle
this final day of WW2019.

00:58:38.946 --> 00:58:39.556 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:58:40.516 --> 00:58:43.500 A:middle
