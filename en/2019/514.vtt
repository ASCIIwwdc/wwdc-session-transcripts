00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:08.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Jonathan Davis,

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:10.536 A:middle
web technologies evangelist for

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.006 A:middle
the Safari and WebKit teams.

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.236 A:middle
Welcome to Auditing Web Content

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:15.236 A:middle
with Web Inspector.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.246 A:middle
In the process of building web

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:18.946 A:middle
content, developers have a lot

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:19.956 A:middle
of details to check.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.676 A:middle
Maybe it's following a CSS class

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:24.446 A:middle
name convention or ensuring good

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:25.796 A:middle
accessibility on the page.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:27.886 A:middle
There can be so many details

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:29.126 A:middle
that they're easy to forget and

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.556 A:middle
tedious to find the issues.

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.656 A:middle
A built-in checklist would be

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
ideal.

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.196 A:middle
Some teams set up automated

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:36.546 A:middle
testing in a continuous

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:37.916 A:middle
integration system using

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.736 A:middle
technologies like Safari's

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.886 A:middle
WebDriver, available for macOS

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:43.066 A:middle
and now iOS.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.066 A:middle
WebDriver is a great tool for

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.596 A:middle
catching code changes that break

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:47.966 A:middle
expected functionality for

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.516 A:middle
users.

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:50.736 A:middle
But for web developers who want

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:51.956 A:middle
to check that their in-progress

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.586 A:middle
work meets code expectations,

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.946 A:middle
Web Inspector now includes a new

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:57.676 A:middle
audit system available with

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.136 A:middle
Safari 13 on macOS that provides

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.136 A:middle
Safari 13 on macOS that provides

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:01.736 A:middle
a quick, easy and more

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:03.076 A:middle
convenient way to check web

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:03.506 A:middle
content.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.106 A:middle
In this video, I'll show you how

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.626 A:middle
to use audits in Web Inspector,

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.666 A:middle
how to work with tests and

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.606 A:middle
understand their results, and

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.266 A:middle
finally I'll cover how to create

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.196 A:middle
custom audits for your projects.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.746 A:middle
To get started, you'll need to

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.966 A:middle
enable the Develop menu to

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.046 A:middle
access Web Inspector.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:24.126 A:middle
Just load up Safari Preferences,

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.066 A:middle
click on Advanced and click to

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.066 A:middle
enable the Show Develop Menu in

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.976 A:middle
Menu Bar option.

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.216 A:middle
Now just load up a web page and

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:35.306 A:middle
open Web Inspector from the

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:35.986 A:middle
Develop menu.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.196 A:middle
Or use the keyboard shortcut

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.096 A:middle
Command-Option-I.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.706 A:middle
Let's take a look at WebKit.org

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:43.516 A:middle
as an example.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.416 A:middle
Click over to the audit tab.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.696 A:middle
And in the left sidebar is a

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:50.736 A:middle
list of audits.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:52.966 A:middle
Click the arrow to the left of

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.286 A:middle
an audit to expand it.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.896 A:middle
An audit is a collection of test

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.126 A:middle
groups and tests.

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.216 A:middle
Test groups don't have any

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.216 A:middle
Test groups don't have any

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:01.676 A:middle
functionality except to act as

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.156 A:middle
organizational containers for a

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
collection of individual tests.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.426 A:middle
It's easy to run audits.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:08.876 A:middle
Click the Start button to run

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.265 A:middle
all of the available audits.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:12.426 A:middle
Or you can right click on an

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:14.046 A:middle
audit for a contextual menu with

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:14.876 A:middle
more actions.

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.406 A:middle
To run a single audit, right

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:18.736 A:middle
click on the audit and select

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:19.126 A:middle
Start.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.166 A:middle
Or you can hover over the right

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.856 A:middle
area of the side bar and a play

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:23.586 A:middle
button will appear.

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:25.956 A:middle
Or click to select it and press

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:26.576 A:middle
the space bar.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.706 A:middle
Audits are fast and update in

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:29.766 A:middle
real time as tests are

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:30.316 A:middle
completed.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.436 A:middle
Another way to control which

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.546 A:middle
audits are run is to click the

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:37.306 A:middle
Edit button at the bottom of the

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.436 A:middle
navigation sidebar.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.326 A:middle
Here you can toggle the

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:44.066 A:middle
checkboxes on the row next to

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.196 A:middle
individual tests, test groups or

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:49.876 A:middle
entire audits to selectively

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:54.116 A:middle
enable or disable them.

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:55.216 A:middle
Click the done button at the

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.146 A:middle
bottom when you're finished

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:56.486 A:middle
editing.

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.726 A:middle
A list of any collected results

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.726 A:middle
A list of any collected results

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:02.436 A:middle
will appear below the audits in

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:04.316 A:middle
a results folder with each of

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:05.976 A:middle
the results collected into Run

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:06.596 A:middle
folders.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.346 A:middle
Expand the Run folder to access

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
the results of the audit for

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:12.056 A:middle
that run.

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:14.446 A:middle
The result runs are kept

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:15.896 A:middle
available across reloads of the

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.686 A:middle
page so you can modify the

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:19.786 A:middle
webpage and rerun the audit for

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:20.766 A:middle
updated results.

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:22.576 A:middle
That way you can compare the

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:23.746 A:middle
pass rate for example.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.686 A:middle
Results will be cleared when Web

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:26.806 A:middle
Inspector is closed.

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.256 A:middle
Clicking on the results of the

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:33.616 A:middle
demo audit run displays a report

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:35.386 A:middle
that shows example result levels

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:36.246 A:middle
and result data.

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:39.816 A:middle
The first three result levels

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:40.936 A:middle
should be familiar if you've

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:41.966 A:middle
ever used XCode.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:43.836 A:middle
The passed level shows a test

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.466 A:middle
that's passed, meaning the code

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.546 A:middle
met the expectations of the

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:47.096 A:middle
test.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:48.886 A:middle
Warning is a soft pass.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.486 A:middle
It says even though the code

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.496 A:middle
passed the test, there are

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:52.536 A:middle
things that could be changed.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:54.556 A:middle
Failed tells you the code did

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:55.856 A:middle
not pass the test.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.246 A:middle
The other two result levels are

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:00.656 A:middle
special to audits in Web

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:00.656 A:middle
special to audits in Web

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
Inspector.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.456 A:middle
An error result occurs when the

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:04.686 A:middle
JavaScript being run for the

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:05.776 A:middle
test throws an error.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.286 A:middle
Unsupported is a special case

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:09.496 A:middle
that can be used to indicate

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:11.026 A:middle
when the data being tested isn't

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.356 A:middle
supported by the current page,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:13.576 A:middle
such as when there's some

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:14.206 A:middle
missing API.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.386 A:middle
Test results can also include

00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:18.976 A:middle
data from the test in the form

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.815 A:middle
of DOM nodes or error messages.

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:24.896 A:middle
Web Inspector includes some

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:26.466 A:middle
built-in audits by default which

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.186 A:middle
can be disabled but not deleted.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:30.366 A:middle
One of the default audits

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:31.896 A:middle
provides tests that check a

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.406 A:middle
webpage for mark-up that meets

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.086 A:middle
some common guidelines for good

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:35.946 A:middle
accessibility.

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.956 A:middle
Let's dig into the results of

00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:40.366 A:middle
running the accessibility audit

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:41.546 A:middle
on WebKit.org.

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:44.606 A:middle
The overall score shows that

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:45.886 A:middle
WebKit does fairly well.

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.296 A:middle
But there's room for

00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:47.946 A:middle
improvement.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.006 A:middle
In the failure cases shown in

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:52.676 A:middle
the results, the DOM node where

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:54.386 A:middle
the failure was detected is

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:55.976 A:middle
shown as an interactive DOM

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:56.276 A:middle
tree.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.486 A:middle
Expanding the DOM tree for the

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.306 A:middle
node allows you to access child

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.306 A:middle
node allows you to access child

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:00.796 A:middle
nodes.

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
And hovering over them will

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:03.986 A:middle
highlight the specific elements

00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:05.666 A:middle
on the page, just like using the

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.446 A:middle
elements tab.

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:12.946 A:middle
This makes it trivially easy to

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.536 A:middle
understand what code in your web

00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:15.986 A:middle
content needs improvement.

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:19.486 A:middle
To fix this, I can simply click

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.876 A:middle
this arrow to go right to the

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.166 A:middle
node in the elements tab.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.566 A:middle
The problem is elements with the

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.246 A:middle
role of menu need their child

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:27.996 A:middle
elements to have a role of menu

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:28.426 A:middle
item.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.466 A:middle
So I simply need to add a new

00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:33.326 A:middle
role attribute with a value of

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:35.296 A:middle
menu item to each of the child

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
elements of the menu.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:38.876 A:middle
I'm going to quickly add the

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:40.196 A:middle
missing attribute to each of

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:40.976 A:middle
these elements.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:45.586 A:middle
Just a couple more.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:51.026 A:middle
Okay.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:52.986 A:middle
Now I'll switch back to the

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.666 A:middle
audit tab so I can rerun the

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.456 A:middle
audit and see the new results

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.686 A:middle
with these changes in the DOM.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:02.006 A:middle
Perfect.

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:03.606 A:middle
The page now passes all of the

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:04.126 A:middle
tests.

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.046 A:middle
I simply need to incorporate

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:07.626 A:middle
those changes into the actual

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:08.616 A:middle
code for the site.

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:12.906 A:middle
You can see how easy it is to

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:14.606 A:middle
spot problems and fix them all

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:15.826 A:middle
conveniently within Web

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:16.336 A:middle
Inspector.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.196 A:middle
Audits and audit results can be

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:20.976 A:middle
exported and re-imported.

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.136 A:middle
Click the Export button to save

00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:25.006 A:middle
the results into a JSON file.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.576 A:middle
They can be re-imported into Web

00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:29.326 A:middle
Inspector with complete access

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:30.476 A:middle
to the results, including

00:06:30.476 --> 00:06:32.106 A:middle
interactive DOM nodes, when

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:33.876 A:middle
elements on the page match the

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:35.036 A:middle
nodes in the report.

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:38.366 A:middle
You can also export the built-in

00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:40.006 A:middle
audits to see an example of how

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.316 A:middle
to write your own audits.

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.996 A:middle
As most teams will have their

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.586 A:middle
own unique code objectives,

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.396 A:middle
writing your own custom audits

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
is one of the most powerful

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.236 A:middle
aspects of using the audit

00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:50.636 A:middle
framework in Web Inspector.

00:06:51.956 --> 00:06:53.906 A:middle
They use a JSON format to make

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:54.536 A:middle
them portable.

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:56.376 A:middle
Each test is simply a

00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:58.006 A:middle
stringified JavaScript function

00:06:58.486 --> 00:06:59.876 A:middle
giving you a simple framework

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.496 A:middle
with special access to more data

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.496 A:middle
with special access to more data

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:02.786 A:middle
than you can normally access in

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.376 A:middle
JavaScript.

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:06.206 A:middle
Being simple JSON, it's easy to

00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:07.856 A:middle
share your tests with your team

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:08.996 A:middle
or other developers.

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:12.046 A:middle
There's an example ESLint audit

00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
available on the WebKit blog

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.736 A:middle
post about creating Web

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.616 A:middle
Inspector audits.

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.046 A:middle
The blog post goes into detail

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.156 A:middle
about how to write a custom

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.896 A:middle
audit as well as other powerful

00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
capabilities of using the audit

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:23.036 A:middle
framework.

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:25.886 A:middle
Simply download the ESLint JSON

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:28.706 A:middle
file and you can easily drag and

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:30.526 A:middle
drop the file onto Web Inspector

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:31.926 A:middle
to import it.

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:35.386 A:middle
Audits in Web Inspector are

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:37.276 A:middle
quick and convenient, so I hope

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.646 A:middle
you'll give them a try using the

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.196 A:middle
built-in accessibility audit on

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:41.336 A:middle
your own web pages.

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:44.386 A:middle
Use the portable audit format to

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:45.636 A:middle
create your own audits and

00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:47.636 A:middle
ensure in-progress code meets

00:07:47.636 --> 00:07:48.946 A:middle
your project standards.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.446 A:middle
And we love hearing from you and

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:52.676 A:middle
hope you'll file bug reports for

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:54.216 A:middle
any issues you find or feature

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:56.006 A:middle
requests you might have.

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:57.366 A:middle
