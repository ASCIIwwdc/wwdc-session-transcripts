00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Ashley

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.346 A:middle
Carroll, and I'm a consulting

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:21.796 A:middle
engineer from New York focused

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:22.626 A:middle
on app development.

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:24.926 A:middle
I spend my time working with our

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:26.556 A:middle
largest business, government,

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:28.306 A:middle
and education customers, helping

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.536 A:middle
them build and distribute great

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:31.536 A:middle
apps for their employees.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.336 A:middle
Welcome to App Distribution From

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:35.206 A:middle
Ad Hoc to Eenterprise.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:37.326 A:middle
So who here in the room today

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:38.576 A:middle
has had to distribute an app

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:39.046 A:middle
before?

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.556 A:middle
Just a few hands, right.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:42.736 A:middle
You're in the right place.

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:44.116 A:middle
So, pretty much everyone has had

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:46.056 A:middle
to do this, and whether you're

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:48.106 A:middle
building apps for the App Store

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:50.036 A:middle
or focusing on building

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.116 A:middle
customized private apps for

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.576 A:middle
business or enterprise, you

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:54.466 A:middle
should learn something today.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.686 A:middle
I want to begin by taking a step

00:00:57.736 --> 00:00:59.106 A:middle
back from app distribution and

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.866 A:middle
talk about the life cycle of an

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.866 A:middle
talk about the life cycle of an

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.836 A:middle
app from its earliest

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:02.456 A:middle
beginnings.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.355 A:middle
Most of us probably know this

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.146 A:middle
part of the process inside and

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:06.316 A:middle
out.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.326 A:middle
It all starts with an idea for a

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:09.506 A:middle
problem that you want to solve.

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:11.406 A:middle
You figure out what to build.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:13.236 A:middle
You create a great app, and it

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:14.356 A:middle
makes it into the hands of your

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.106 A:middle
users, most often through the

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:18.496 A:middle
App Store.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.606 A:middle
Today, we'll be focusing on that

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:23.156 A:middle
last bit, how users actually get

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:25.106 A:middle
your app onto their devices.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.296 A:middle
It seems simple, and for lots of

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.826 A:middle
apps on the store, it is.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:31.486 A:middle
But there's actually a number of

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:32.606 A:middle
different ways that you can

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:33.986 A:middle
distribute an app.

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.506 A:middle
And that depends on who your

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:37.866 A:middle
customer is.

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.556 A:middle
This is all about finding the

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.186 A:middle
right way to reach your users.

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:43.886 A:middle
Your users could be the general

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:45.756 A:middle
public or business and education

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:46.286 A:middle
customers.

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:48.036 A:middle
Depending on who your app is

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:49.786 A:middle
for, there are different ways to

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:50.396 A:middle
distribute it.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:52.426 A:middle
There are four distribution

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:53.136 A:middle
methods that we're going to

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:53.526 A:middle
cover today.

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:57.756 A:middle
Ad hoc, App Store, in-house, and

00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:58.356 A:middle
custom apps.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.386 A:middle
How do you determine which path

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.386 A:middle
How do you determine which path

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.626 A:middle
is the most appropriate for you?

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:05.206 A:middle
This depends on a number of

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.186 A:middle
factors, and some questions you

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.136 A:middle
might ask along the way include

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:10.866 A:middle
who's the audience for this app.

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.436 A:middle
Who's going to maintain the

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:13.976 A:middle
source code?

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.156 A:middle
Are you building the app for you

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:17.176 A:middle
or for someone else?

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:19.076 A:middle
Is someone buying this app for

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:20.256 A:middle
their employees or students to

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:20.566 A:middle
use?

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.536 A:middle
All of this comes down to asking

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.626 A:middle
who, and we can focus that on

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:27.446 A:middle
who was using the app and who is

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:27.936 A:middle
buying the app.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:33.876 A:middle
Knowing that the customer and

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:35.496 A:middle
the user are not always the same

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:37.296 A:middle
person or entity is critical to

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:38.756 A:middle
mastering the different ways

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.086 A:middle
that apps can be distributed and

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.456 A:middle
figuring out where your app

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.006 A:middle
fits.

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:43.886 A:middle
If you can identify your

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:45.386 A:middle
audience, it becomes a lot

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:46.636 A:middle
easier to pick the right

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:47.786 A:middle
distribution mechanism.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.176 A:middle
Most often, an individual is the

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.606 A:middle
both the customer and the user.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.256 A:middle
They download your app from the

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.006 A:middle
App Store on their own device

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.066 A:middle
and then use it themselves.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
Ad hoc distribution lets you

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
distribute to a limited number

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
distribute to a limited number

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:02.586 A:middle
of devices that you choose for

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:04.726 A:middle
testing, and the App Store lets

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:05.676 A:middle
you distribute apps to the

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:06.436 A:middle
general public.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.646 A:middle
Now, sometimes when dealing with

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:10.816 A:middle
the business and education

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.186 A:middle
market, the customer is actually

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.876 A:middle
an organization, and they're

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:16.706 A:middle
purchasing apps on behalf of a

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.646 A:middle
group of users who will use

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.346 A:middle
those apps on either devices

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:21.936 A:middle
that that organization provides

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.216 A:middle
to them or on their own devices.

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:28.576 A:middle
So there are two different ways

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:29.916 A:middle
that you can distribute apps in

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.366 A:middle
this scenario, in house and

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:33.256 A:middle
custom apps, and those both let

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:35.926 A:middle
you distribute apps privately to

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:36.626 A:middle
organizations.

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:40.396 A:middle
Your app might have different

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:41.746 A:middle
reasons to use all of these

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:42.756 A:middle
distribution methods at

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.436 A:middle
different times in its lifetime

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:46.156 A:middle
or simply live in one of them,

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.736 A:middle
and different distribution

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:49.466 A:middle
mechanisms are associated with

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:51.316 A:middle
different types of memberships

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.686 A:middle
in the Apple developer programs.

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:55.686 A:middle
We're going to walk through each

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:57.146 A:middle
of these distribution methods

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:57.476 A:middle
today.

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:00.466 A:middle
The expectations around each and

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:00.466 A:middle
The expectations around each and

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:01.886 A:middle
everything that you need to know

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.246 A:middle
to figure out where your app

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:05.936 A:middle
fits.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:07.416 A:middle
We'll do this by following an

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:08.896 A:middle
app on a distribution journey

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.716 A:middle
from its very beginnings as a

00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:12.136 A:middle
prototype, through the App

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:13.906 A:middle
Store, and through being

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.536 A:middle
customized for a business to be

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.305 A:middle
distributed privately in a few

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:17.995 A:middle
different ways.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.305 A:middle
That app is LunchControl.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:23.646 A:middle
LunchControl is an app for

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:24.906 A:middle
collaborative food ordering, and

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.396 A:middle
when we're talking about

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.306 A:middle
LunchControl, I want you to

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:30.076 A:middle
imagine yourself as the

00:04:30.076 --> 00:04:30.926 A:middle
developer for this app.

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:33.076 A:middle
We'll begin with how

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:34.606 A:middle
LunchControl came to be.

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.586 A:middle
This whole journey starts with

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:38.686 A:middle
ordering lunch at the office.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:40.826 A:middle
Everyone loves to get takeout,

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
but the process for ordering and

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.386 A:middle
for a big group of people is

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:46.556 A:middle
daunting and time consuming.

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:47.966 A:middle
You have to figure out what

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.896 A:middle
everyone wants to eat and go

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:50.826 A:middle
through each of the orders to

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:52.386 A:middle
make a consolidated list.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.576 A:middle
So, make sure you remember that

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:55.796 A:middle
Trevor doesn't like tomatoes,

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.016 A:middle
whatever your boss' usual is,

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.816 A:middle
and that the new guy, Rod was

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.816 A:middle
and that the new guy, Rod was

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:02.726 A:middle
it, said he wants a turkey club.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.236 A:middle
Does this sound familiar to

00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:04.636 A:middle
anyone?

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:06.936 A:middle
It takes way too long, so it's

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:09.106 A:middle
almost not worth ordering, and

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:10.166 A:middle
it really sounds like a great

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.886 A:middle
problem to solve with an app.

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:13.146 A:middle
So you give it a try, and you

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.186 A:middle
come up with a prototype.

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:16.796 A:middle
To build your prototype, you've

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:18.546 A:middle
downloaded Xcode, started

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.076 A:middle
exploring the SDK, and you've

00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:22.546 A:middle
logged in using your Apple ID.

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
I'm sure most of you know how to

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.976 A:middle
get started because you've

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:26.496 A:middle
probably already published apps

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:27.986 A:middle
to the store, but we're going to

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.436 A:middle
review this part of the process

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:31.626 A:middle
quickly, just so that everyone's

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:32.896 A:middle
on the same page, and you really

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:34.346 A:middle
get a full picture of app

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:36.126 A:middle
distribution from start to

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:37.386 A:middle
finish, and hopefully you'll

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:39.416 A:middle
learn something new along the

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:40.496 A:middle
way.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:41.556 A:middle
This is your prototype.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:43.456 A:middle
You can select items from the

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:44.826 A:middle
menu and create a group order.

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.246 A:middle
All of the items are nicely

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.686 A:middle
summarized, and it even breaks

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:49.806 A:middle
up the cost per person.

00:05:50.276 --> 00:05:51.486 A:middle
But how would you actually get

00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
this prototype running on your

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:53.496 A:middle
devices?

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:56.126 A:middle
You can sign into Xcode with

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:57.776 A:middle
your Apple ID and leverage the

00:05:57.776 --> 00:05:59.146 A:middle
free account that comes with it,

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.566 A:middle
called the Personal Team.

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.566 A:middle
called the Personal Team.

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:02.936 A:middle
This enables you to explore the

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:04.366 A:middle
SDK and test apps on your

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:04.926 A:middle
device.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:06.986 A:middle
You can only deploy a limited

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:08.556 A:middle
number of apps to a few devices,

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.476 A:middle
and they expire after a few

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.326 A:middle
days, so this isn't a real

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:14.006 A:middle
distribution method.

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:16.946 A:middle
Here's what you see in Xcode

00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:17.856 A:middle
once you're logged in with a

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:18.706 A:middle
personal team.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.656 A:middle
You build and run your app.

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:21.766 A:middle
Xcode installs it on your

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.076 A:middle
device, but in order for it to

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
be able to launch, you'll need

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:25.696 A:middle
to trust your developer

00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:27.136 A:middle
certificate on your device.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:29.526 A:middle
This is what that process looks

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:29.786 A:middle
like.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.406 A:middle
You can trust the developer

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:32.506 A:middle
certificate by going into

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.166 A:middle
settings, general, profiles, and

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.066 A:middle
device management.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:40.686 A:middle
Here are a few best practices to

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.266 A:middle
keep in mind for personal teams.

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:45.056 A:middle
These accounts are really meant

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:45.686 A:middle
for learning.

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:47.806 A:middle
The assumption is that you're

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.626 A:middle
going to be deploying to devices

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:53.206 A:middle
that you own, and this isn't for

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:54.896 A:middle
distribution beyond your own

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:55.546 A:middle
devices.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:58.266 A:middle
Some capabilities like CloudKit,

00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
Siri, or APNS aren't available,

00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
Siri, or APNS aren't available,

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:02.426 A:middle
and there's no way to publish

00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:03.456 A:middle
apps to the store with this

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.416 A:middle
program or debate a testing with

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:06.166 A:middle
other users.

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:09.246 A:middle
The goal for LunchControl is to

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:10.686 A:middle
go beyond this learning stage.

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:12.906 A:middle
So, let's talk about the first

00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:13.996 A:middle
way that you can distribute

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:14.626 A:middle
LunchControl.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.096 A:middle
Ad hoc distribution can be

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.526 A:middle
utilized to distribute apps for

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:19.026 A:middle
testing.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:23.116 A:middle
Up until this point, you've been

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:24.466 A:middle
walking around to different

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:25.726 A:middle
people's desks to take their

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:27.646 A:middle
orders and mostly just testing

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:28.986 A:middle
the app in the simulator and on

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:29.606 A:middle
your own device.

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:31.406 A:middle
You're really ready to have a

00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:33.236 A:middle
few friends try it out and get

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.216 A:middle
feedback and see if you've got

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:36.286 A:middle
something special, and you also

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:37.776 A:middle
think that integrating with Siri

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:39.036 A:middle
and push notifications would

00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.466 A:middle
make the experience even better,

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:43.106 A:middle
which aren't available with

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:43.926 A:middle
personal teams.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.416 A:middle
Membership in the Apple

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:48.076 A:middle
Developer Program is required in

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:49.306 A:middle
order to distribute an app to

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:49.666 A:middle
others.

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:51.926 A:middle
So, this is the point where if

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:53.726 A:middle
you don't already have an

00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:54.836 A:middle
account, most developers would

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.736 A:middle
sign up, either as a company or

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:58.726 A:middle
an individual, and once you're

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
signed up, you're ready to start

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
signed up, you're ready to start

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:04.286 A:middle
distributing to others.

00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:05.556 A:middle
When you leverage ad hoc

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:07.376 A:middle
distribution, a limited number

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:08.736 A:middle
of users can install your app

00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:10.446 A:middle
directly from their devices for

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:10.946 A:middle
testing.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.176 A:middle
The process requires that you

00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:14.676 A:middle
register their device from the

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.326 A:middle
developer website, and there are

00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:17.626 A:middle
a limited number of devices that

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:18.766 A:middle
you can register for both

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:19.966 A:middle
development and testing.

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:23.176 A:middle
That's 100 devices per product

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:24.136 A:middle
family per year.

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
For your average user,

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.396 A:middle
registering a device involves

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:30.626 A:middle
connecting it to a Mac and

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:32.126 A:middle
getting the device identifier,

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:33.946 A:middle
either from the finder's sidebar

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:35.936 A:middle
or retrieving it from Xcode,

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.015 A:middle
which means that you as a

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.236 A:middle
developer would need physical

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:39.436 A:middle
possession of their device.

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:42.806 A:middle
You then take that identifier

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:43.956 A:middle
and add it to the Apple

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.716 A:middle
developer website, and once you

00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:47.016 A:middle
have their device registered,

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:48.946 A:middle
you're ready to create a build

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.176 A:middle
and install it for them.

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.356 A:middle
There are several different

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:53.756 A:middle
alternatives for installing ad

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:54.866 A:middle
hoc builds for testers.

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:56.616 A:middle
You can tether the device to

00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:58.656 A:middle
your Mac and install with Xcode

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.286 A:middle
or Apple configurator, which is

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.286 A:middle
or Apple configurator, which is

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.486 A:middle
available on the Mac App Store,

00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.166 A:middle
or you can host the app

00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:04.546 A:middle
somewhere and enable

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.596 A:middle
over-the-air installation.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.216 A:middle
This is a manual way of

00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:10.026 A:middle
achieving a limited distribution

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.036 A:middle
to a small group.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:15.646 A:middle
This program is designed to let

00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:17.356 A:middle
you deploy to registered devices

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.446 A:middle
for the purpose of testing.

00:09:19.186 --> 00:09:21.216 A:middle
It's not a long-term or scalable

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:23.126 A:middle
distribution solution, and the

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:24.596 A:middle
provisioning profiles used to

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.316 A:middle
sign these apps expire yearly,

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:28.196 A:middle
so eventually the apps will stop

00:09:28.196 --> 00:09:30.066 A:middle
working or need to be re-signed.

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:32.916 A:middle
For larger teams, it's really

00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:33.886 A:middle
important to take note of the

00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:34.586 A:middle
device limits.

00:09:35.146 --> 00:09:36.586 A:middle
It can be hard to develop for

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:38.406 A:middle
new products if you run out of

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.986 A:middle
devices, which is why you have

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:41.096 A:middle
to be careful when using

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:43.176 A:middle
development devices for testers.

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:45.346 A:middle
These device limits are reset

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:47.266 A:middle
once per year, and if you're

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.716 A:middle
curious about when your device

00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:50.076 A:middle
counts are going to be reset for

00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:51.206 A:middle
your account, you can go to the

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:52.296 A:middle
member page on the developer

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.136 A:middle
website and look at the reset

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:54.376 A:middle
date.

00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:58.976 A:middle
Ad hoc distribution gave us the

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.236 A:middle
ability to test with a few

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.236 A:middle
ability to test with a few

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:00.726 A:middle
users.

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.446 A:middle
You quickly realize that ad hoc

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:04.956 A:middle
distribution isn't scalable as

00:10:04.956 --> 00:10:05.986 A:middle
the number of people who want to

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:07.096 A:middle
test the app grows.

00:10:07.616 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
So, let's talk about the App

00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:09.216 A:middle
Store.

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.426 A:middle
The App Store offers a much

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.796 A:middle
better way to do beta testing

00:10:13.836 --> 00:10:15.016 A:middle
for a large group of users.

00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:17.436 A:middle
User interest in LunchControl is

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:18.916 A:middle
growing, and you want to expand

00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.086 A:middle
your audience to include more

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:20.706 A:middle
testers.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.566 A:middle
TestFlight makes it really easy

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:26.146 A:middle
for both developers and users to

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.526 A:middle
try out apps, and installation

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:29.766 A:middle
and updates are simple.

00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:31.586 A:middle
You could scale up to 10,000

00:10:31.586 --> 00:10:32.046 A:middle
testers.

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:33.946 A:middle
The builds last for three

00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:35.786 A:middle
months, and for a user,

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.526 A:middle
installing an app is a familiar

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.516 A:middle
and simple process.

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:40.956 A:middle
TestFlight beta builds for

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:42.596 A:middle
external testers do go through

00:10:42.596 --> 00:10:43.146 A:middle
app review.

00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:44.796 A:middle
So, you need to make sure that

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:45.906 A:middle
you're following the App Store

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:46.936 A:middle
review guidelines before

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.656 A:middle
submitting, and the app needs to

00:10:48.736 --> 00:10:50.066 A:middle
be stable and ready for a

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.046 A:middle
broader audience to test.

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.276 A:middle
However, if you're making a

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:55.016 A:middle
build available to only members

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:56.546 A:middle
of your App Store connect team,

00:10:57.086 --> 00:10:58.406 A:middle
review isn't required.

00:10:58.896 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
And TestFlight is only available

00:10:58.896 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
And TestFlight is only available

00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:01.956 A:middle
to members of the Apple

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:02.876 A:middle
Developer Program.

00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:06.726 A:middle
TestFlight is built right into

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:07.486 A:middle
App Store Connect.

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:09.506 A:middle
For those of you who are only

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:10.766 A:middle
familiar with the Apple

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:12.576 A:middle
Developer Enterprise Program and

00:11:12.576 --> 00:11:13.836 A:middle
have probably never used App

00:11:13.836 --> 00:11:15.396 A:middle
Store Connect before, this is

00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:16.016 A:middle
what it looks like.

00:11:16.716 --> 00:11:18.446 A:middle
App Store Connect enables you to

00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:20.086 A:middle
easily upload, submit, and

00:11:20.086 --> 00:11:21.936 A:middle
manage your apps on the App

00:11:22.026 --> 00:11:22.286 A:middle
Store.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.166 A:middle
All of your TestFlight builds

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.966 A:middle
are available to see here, and

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:27.366 A:middle
you can invite testers to test

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:28.736 A:middle
your app.

00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:29.846 A:middle
Testers can install your app

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.456 A:middle
from the TesFlight app on their

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:32.076 A:middle
devices.

00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:35.606 A:middle
Once you invite a tester in

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:37.086 A:middle
TestFlight, they will receive an

00:11:37.086 --> 00:11:38.596 A:middle
email invitation to beta test

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:39.816 A:middle
your app.

00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:41.266 A:middle
They can review all of the

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:42.786 A:middle
testing details that you provide

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:44.506 A:middle
and install the app to start

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:47.686 A:middle
testing right away.

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.096 A:middle
Once you're satisfied with the

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:50.686 A:middle
stability of your built, the

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:52.516 A:middle
next step is submitting to the

00:11:53.156 --> 00:11:53.936 A:middle
App Store.

00:11:54.076 --> 00:11:55.886 A:middle
For LunchControl, you've made

00:11:55.886 --> 00:11:57.696 A:middle
some updates, added features

00:11:57.696 --> 00:11:59.016 A:middle
based on feedback from your beta

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:00.836 A:middle
testers, and really iterated on

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:00.836 A:middle
testers, and really iterated on

00:12:00.836 --> 00:12:01.376 A:middle
your design.

00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:03.156 A:middle
You're ready to list the app for

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.906 A:middle
sale, and you've even updated

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:08.536 A:middle
your app icon.

00:12:08.726 --> 00:12:10.236 A:middle
You've done the hard work to get

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:11.436 A:middle
your app ready for submission.

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.546 A:middle
Let's consider who the user and

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:15.686 A:middle
who the customer is here.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.946 A:middle
Both are the general public,

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:19.656 A:middle
which makes this app appropriate

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.076 A:middle
for the public app store.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.806 A:middle
Any individual can download and

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.446 A:middle
use your app, and the person who

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.926 A:middle
is buying it is also the person

00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:28.106 A:middle
who's using it.

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.956 A:middle
Here are a few things you should

00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:32.326 A:middle
know about how App Store

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:33.266 A:middle
distribution works.

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:35.876 A:middle
Both individuals and

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:37.396 A:middle
organizations can sign up for

00:12:37.396 --> 00:12:38.886 A:middle
the Apple Developer Program to

00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:40.096 A:middle
distribute to the App Store.

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.526 A:middle
Apps are available to the

00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:44.006 A:middle
general public based on the

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:45.056 A:middle
markets that you choose to

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:47.216 A:middle
support, and the apps are hosted

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.126 A:middle
and reviewed by Apple.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.356 A:middle
This means that developers are

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.276 A:middle
expected to know and follow the

00:12:54.276 --> 00:12:55.846 A:middle
App Store review guidelines.

00:12:56.746 --> 00:12:58.546 A:middle
It's also expected that you keep

00:12:58.546 --> 00:12:58.866 A:middle
current.

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
This means supporting new

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
This means supporting new

00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:02.216 A:middle
hardware and screen sizes,

00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:04.586 A:middle
modern APIs, and new features,

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.766 A:middle
like all of the exciting things

00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:06.716 A:middle
that we've announced this week.

00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:10.056 A:middle
And just to reiterate, the App

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:11.826 A:middle
Store is appropriate for apps

00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:13.496 A:middle
that are for the general public,

00:13:13.906 --> 00:13:14.816 A:middle
which means that if you're

00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:15.616 A:middle
building an app for the

00:13:15.616 --> 00:13:17.846 A:middle
employees of a specific company

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.936 A:middle
to use, the public App Store is

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:21.356 A:middle
probably not the most

00:13:21.356 --> 00:13:22.446 A:middle
appropriate place for it.

00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:25.036 A:middle
Let's talk about a few more

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.636 A:middle
scenarios that developers might

00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:30.836 A:middle
run into in the App Store.

00:13:31.036 --> 00:13:32.676 A:middle
First, let's talk about the

00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:34.116 A:middle
ability for a customer to

00:13:34.116 --> 00:13:35.966 A:middle
purchase your app in bulk for a

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:36.706 A:middle
group of users.

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:38.656 A:middle
There are programs in place that

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.186 A:middle
enable you to do this.

00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:42.916 A:middle
For LunchControl, a bunch of

00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:43.946 A:middle
your friends are teachers at a

00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:45.546 A:middle
local school, and their school

00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:47.056 A:middle
wants to purchase the app in

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.466 A:middle
bulk for all of the faculty to

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:48.856 A:middle
use.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.626 A:middle
As a developer, if you want to

00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.196 A:middle
offer them a discount, you need

00:13:53.196 --> 00:13:54.166 A:middle
to make sure that this is

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.296 A:middle
enabled in App Store Connect.

00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:58.556 A:middle
In this case, your user is still

00:13:58.556 --> 00:13:59.326 A:middle
the general public.

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.716 A:middle
So a group of teachers who would

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.716 A:middle
So a group of teachers who would

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.416 A:middle
be using your App Store app, but

00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:03.586 A:middle
the customer that's doing the

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:04.826 A:middle
purchasing is actually the

00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.106 A:middle
school that they're working for.

00:14:07.436 --> 00:14:09.556 A:middle
Customers use Apple Business

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:11.336 A:middle
Manager or Apple School Manager

00:14:11.336 --> 00:14:12.366 A:middle
to purchase apps like

00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:13.946 A:middle
LunchControl from the App Store

00:14:13.946 --> 00:14:15.696 A:middle
in bulk and distribute them to

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:16.276 A:middle
their users.

00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:20.006 A:middle
To verify that an education

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:22.006 A:middle
customer can purchase your app

00:14:22.006 --> 00:14:23.596 A:middle
at a discount, you would take a

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.526 A:middle
look at the pricing and

00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:25.986 A:middle
availability section in App

00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:26.546 A:middle
Store Connect.

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:29.746 A:middle
The default availability option

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:32.006 A:middle
for an app is available at a

00:14:32.006 --> 00:14:33.866 A:middle
reduced price for educational

00:14:33.866 --> 00:14:34.596 A:middle
institutions.

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:36.866 A:middle
If the educational institution

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:38.766 A:middle
purchases 20 or more licenses,

00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:40.106 A:middle
and you have this enabled for

00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:40.376 A:middle
them.

00:14:40.706 --> 00:14:41.966 A:middle
They'll receive a 50 percent

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:44.056 A:middle
discount, and Apple School

00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:45.716 A:middle
Manager is required for them to

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:46.456 A:middle
make this purchase.

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:53.526 A:middle
Next, I want to discuss proper

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:55.316 A:middle
versioning for an app and how to

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.606 A:middle
handle adding additional

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:57.136 A:middle
features.

00:14:58.556 --> 00:14:59.796 A:middle
As LunchControl grows in

00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.796 A:middle
popularity, more and more

00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.796 A:middle
popularity, more and more

00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:03.616 A:middle
feature requests are coming in,

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.016 A:middle
and more organizations start to

00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:07.066 A:middle
become interested in leverage

00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:07.326 A:middle
the app.

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:10.756 A:middle
Some users or organizations may

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.786 A:middle
ask you to add features that may

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.016 A:middle
not make sense for your entire

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:16.226 A:middle
audience, but you need to be

00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:17.426 A:middle
careful about versioning your

00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:18.866 A:middle
app in the app store

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:19.596 A:middle
appropriately.

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.016 A:middle
As you start to expand your

00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:23.446 A:middle
customer base and consider

00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:24.696 A:middle
offering multiple versions of

00:15:24.696 --> 00:15:26.416 A:middle
your app on the store to various

00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:29.506 A:middle
clients or even variations of

00:15:29.506 --> 00:15:30.766 A:middle
your app for different types of

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:33.546 A:middle
users, like if having an admin

00:15:33.546 --> 00:15:34.836 A:middle
and a regular version made sense

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.586 A:middle
for you, you want to handle

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:37.866 A:middle
versioning and your app store

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:38.906 A:middle
presence appropriately.

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:42.216 A:middle
This is what could happen if

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:43.386 A:middle
LunchControl doesn't manage

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:44.256 A:middle
their App Store presence

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:44.806 A:middle
properly.

00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:46.796 A:middle
This is actually a real example

00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:48.586 A:middle
from the App Store, just using

00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.096 A:middle
the names from Liquid Oxygen

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:51.796 A:middle
Company and LunchControl.

00:15:52.436 --> 00:15:53.356 A:middle
Don't do this.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:55.206 A:middle
When a user searches the App

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.076 A:middle
Store for a given name, this is

00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:58.146 A:middle
what they might see if you

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.256 A:middle
version your app this way.

00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:01.196 A:middle
They have no idea which app to

00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:02.726 A:middle
pick, and if they pick the wrong

00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:04.146 A:middle
one, they might not be able to

00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:06.126 A:middle
log in or use it and might not

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:07.496 A:middle
behave in a way that's expected.

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.156 A:middle
This is a really frustrating

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:11.096 A:middle
experience for a user, and it's

00:16:11.256 --> 00:16:12.976 A:middle
easily overcome by managing your

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.876 A:middle
versions better in software and

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.236 A:middle
moving your customer base

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.596 A:middle
forward as you make changes to

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.426 A:middle
your app and your product.

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:21.316 A:middle
What developers should do

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:23.036 A:middle
instead is consolidate app

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:24.936 A:middle
versions as much as possible.

00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:27.666 A:middle
Ideally, it's one app, just like

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:28.436 A:middle
you see here on the left.

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:30.416 A:middle
This does require more

00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.066 A:middle
development work, but in the end

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:33.196 A:middle
it's a much better customer

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:35.816 A:middle
experience, and if you as a

00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:37.546 A:middle
developer start getting requests

00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:39.146 A:middle
for lots of different customized

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:40.796 A:middle
versions of your app, it might

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:42.436 A:middle
be a good time to talk about how

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.776 A:middle
you could deliver those versions

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.576 A:middle
privately using custom apps,

00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.436 A:middle
which we'll get into in a few

00:16:47.436 --> 00:16:47.806 A:middle
minutes.

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:51.576 A:middle
The final App Store scenario I

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:53.546 A:middle
want to cover is building an App

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:55.246 A:middle
Store app for someone else.

00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:58.186 A:middle
Your company, Liquid Oxygen,

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
LLC, might be approached by a

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
LLC, might be approached by a

00:17:00.396 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
customer to build their own

00:17:01.936 --> 00:17:02.676 A:middle
public facing app.

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:04.996 A:middle
In this case, we're going to

00:17:04.996 --> 00:17:07.096 A:middle
talk about Liquid Oxygen being

00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:08.236 A:middle
approached by a restaurant

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.406 A:middle
chain, Taco Bar, to create their

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.756 A:middle
App Store app for them.

00:17:13.756 --> 00:17:15.346 A:middle
Taco Bar loves what you've done

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:16.896 A:middle
with LunchControl and really

00:17:16.896 --> 00:17:17.876 A:middle
wants you to build them an app

00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:19.195 A:middle
where customers could place

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.925 A:middle
orders, find the Taco Bar

00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:23.366 A:middle
locations near them, and pay for

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:23.786 A:middle
their food.

00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:25.675 A:middle
They currently don't have an App

00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:27.195 A:middle
Store presence, so this would be

00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:29.796 A:middle
their flagship app, and you, as

00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:31.096 A:middle
a developer, don't want to give

00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:32.386 A:middle
Taco Bar your intellectual

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:32.906 A:middle
property.

00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.676 A:middle
In this scenario, the user of

00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:37.176 A:middle
your app is still the general

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:38.866 A:middle
public, and the customer is

00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:39.956 A:middle
actually Taco Bar.

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:41.916 A:middle
You would be building an app for

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:44.996 A:middle
Taco Bar for their customers

00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:46.866 A:middle
while still maintaining control

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.266 A:middle
of your intellectual property

00:17:48.856 --> 00:17:50.836 A:middle
and running Liquid Oxygen, LLC.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.146 A:middle
This is a brand-new app that

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:54.926 A:middle
will have a separate bundle ID

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:56.916 A:middle
and will exist on the App Store

00:17:56.916 --> 00:17:58.226 A:middle
alongside LunchControl.

00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
This is not simply publishing

00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
This is not simply publishing

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:02.356 A:middle
the same app under a different

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:02.996 A:middle
customer name.

00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:04.316 A:middle
It's a new and distinct

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:04.986 A:middle
experience.

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:08.416 A:middle
So, how would Liquid Oxygen work

00:18:08.416 --> 00:18:10.026 A:middle
with Taco Bar as a third-party

00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:11.526 A:middle
developer when building an App

00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:12.416 A:middle
Store app for them?

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:13.836 A:middle
What's the best way for them to

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:14.526 A:middle
work together?

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:18.226 A:middle
Taco Bar is hiring Liquid Oxygen

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.666 A:middle
to build an app and submit it to

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.286 A:middle
the store under their developer

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:21.616 A:middle
account.

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:24.186 A:middle
The developer has to join Taco

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.616 A:middle
Bar's developer program and

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:27.246 A:middle
provide a build of the app for

00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:29.076 A:middle
Taco Bar to submit to the store.

00:18:29.796 --> 00:18:30.866 A:middle
This is what that workflow

00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:31.506 A:middle
should look like.

00:18:32.896 --> 00:18:34.406 A:middle
The two developer roles that

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.956 A:middle
Taco Bar should assign to Liquid

00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:38.866 A:middle
Oxygen are Developer and

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:39.426 A:middle
Marketing.

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:41.616 A:middle
This would allow them to upload

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:43.186 A:middle
bills and provide marketing

00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:44.336 A:middle
metadata like the app's

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:45.886 A:middle
description and screen shots.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:48.586 A:middle
The admin role should remain

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:49.736 A:middle
internal to Taco Bar.

00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:53.156 A:middle
This enables Taco Bar to control

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:54.606 A:middle
TestFlight distribution,

00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:57.556 A:middle
pricing, submission, and go live

00:18:57.556 --> 00:18:58.266 A:middle
on the App Store.

00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.916 A:middle
The app manager role should also

00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.916 A:middle
The app manager role should also

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:01.646 A:middle
remain internal.

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:04.946 A:middle
Here's what it looks like to add

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:06.456 A:middle
and manage users in App Store

00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:06.776 A:middle
Connect.

00:19:07.826 --> 00:19:09.366 A:middle
Users with the admin and app

00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:11.476 A:middle
manager roles can create and

00:19:11.476 --> 00:19:13.546 A:middle
edit users and also restrict a

00:19:13.546 --> 00:19:15.936 A:middle
user's access to specific apps

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:16.556 A:middle
in the account.

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:19.256 A:middle
Make sure to limit third-party

00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:21.346 A:middle
developer access to only those

00:19:21.346 --> 00:19:22.546 A:middle
apps that they're working on.

00:19:23.536 --> 00:19:25.816 A:middle
But note, user access cannot be

00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:27.586 A:middle
restricted to specific apps on

00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:28.546 A:middle
the developer site.

00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.606 A:middle
Users will have access to all of

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:33.396 A:middle
the bundle IDs on the developer

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:33.656 A:middle
site.

00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:36.436 A:middle
You can see here that Tracy is

00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:38.286 A:middle
the developer, and she has

00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:40.456 A:middle
access to the Taco Bar app only.

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:43.376 A:middle
And if LunchControl and Liquid

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:45.996 A:middle
Oxygen, LLC, were no longer to

00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:47.396 A:middle
have a relationship with Taco

00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:48.766 A:middle
Bar, the customer could always

00:19:48.766 --> 00:19:50.036 A:middle
remove them as a third-party

00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:51.156 A:middle
developer later on.

00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:55.076 A:middle
If you're developing an app for

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:57.606 A:middle
a business, that business is the

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.246 A:middle
only one allowed to submit to

00:19:59.246 --> 00:19:59.816 A:middle
the App Store.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.066 A:middle
That means that apps must be

00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:03.586 A:middle
submitted under client accounts,

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:06.156 A:middle
and customers of Taco Bar are

00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:07.526 A:middle
going to expect to be

00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.166 A:middle
downloading an app from Taco

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.976 A:middle
Bar, Ltd., not from Liquid

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.246 A:middle
Oxygen, LLC.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.126 A:middle
For more information on this,

00:20:14.126 --> 00:20:15.356 A:middle
you can review to App Store

00:20:15.356 --> 00:20:17.956 A:middle
review guidelines section 5.2.

00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:20.796 A:middle
Powerful roles like admin and

00:20:20.796 --> 00:20:22.206 A:middle
app manager should be limited

00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:24.396 A:middle
for third-party developers, and

00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:25.856 A:middle
customers should also limit app

00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:28.266 A:middle
access to only the apps that

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:29.986 A:middle
they'll be working on, and you

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:31.176 A:middle
should also follow the best

00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.456 A:middle
practices for app versioning

00:20:32.456 --> 00:20:33.236 A:middle
that we discussed.

00:20:33.786 --> 00:20:36.346 A:middle
That concludes our discussion

00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:37.756 A:middle
about the different scenarios

00:20:37.756 --> 00:20:38.616 A:middle
where you would distribute a

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:40.926 A:middle
public-facing app through the

00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:42.446 A:middle
App Store.

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.506 A:middle
For the remainder of the

00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:45.106 A:middle
session, we're going to talk

00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:46.626 A:middle
about two ways to distribute

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:48.426 A:middle
apps that are customized for a

00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:50.416 A:middle
business, intended to be used

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:52.636 A:middle
privately and internally by that

00:20:52.636 --> 00:20:53.076 A:middle
business.

00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:55.056 A:middle
The first one we'll talk about

00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:56.576 A:middle
is in-house distribution.

00:20:57.646 --> 00:20:58.926 A:middle
Let's check back in on

00:20:58.926 --> 00:20:59.536 A:middle
LunchControl.

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.636 A:middle
Exciting things are happening,

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.636 A:middle
Exciting things are happening,

00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:04.666 A:middle
and Acme Company has approached

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:06.656 A:middle
you to build them a custom

00:21:06.656 --> 00:21:08.096 A:middle
version of LunchControl for

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:09.416 A:middle
their corporate cafeteria and

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:11.246 A:middle
catering services so that their

00:21:11.246 --> 00:21:12.606 A:middle
employees can order food and

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:13.886 A:middle
have the same great experience

00:21:13.886 --> 00:21:14.736 A:middle
that you offer in your app.

00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:17.046 A:middle
This would mean incorporating

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.236 A:middle
their back-end system into the

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.216 A:middle
app and building a totally

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:21.376 A:middle
customized version for them.

00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:24.776 A:middle
In this case, Acme Company is

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:25.816 A:middle
going to be the customer

00:21:26.216 --> 00:21:27.846 A:middle
purchasing a custom app for a

00:21:27.846 --> 00:21:29.576 A:middle
group of users who happen to be

00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:30.366 A:middle
their employees.

00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:32.856 A:middle
We'll call it Acme Co. Café.

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:35.346 A:middle
Knowing that the audience for

00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:37.246 A:middle
this app isn't public, it's the

00:21:37.246 --> 00:21:38.866 A:middle
employees of a company, it's

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:40.766 A:middle
apparent that a public app store

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.026 A:middle
isn't appropriate for this use

00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:42.376 A:middle
case.

00:21:43.326 --> 00:21:44.626 A:middle
When we think about apps for

00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:46.096 A:middle
internal use, there are two

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.426 A:middle
distribution methods that come

00:21:47.426 --> 00:21:50.076 A:middle
to mind, in-house and custom

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:51.126 A:middle
apps.

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:54.166 A:middle
In a previous world, Acme

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:55.726 A:middle
Company would probably have an

00:21:55.726 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
Apple Developer Enterprise

00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:58.686 A:middle
Program account and would

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:00.346 A:middle
utilize in-house distribution to

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:00.346 A:middle
utilize in-house distribution to

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:00.956 A:middle
deploy this app.

00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:04.306 A:middle
For a very long time, this was

00:22:04.306 --> 00:22:05.526 A:middle
the only way to do it.

00:22:06.456 --> 00:22:08.326 A:middle
But recently, we've enabled the

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:09.986 A:middle
ability for these types of apps

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.926 A:middle
to be hosted on the App Store's

00:22:11.926 --> 00:22:13.706 A:middle
infrastructure via custom apps,

00:22:13.706 --> 00:22:15.586 A:middle
and there are a host of benefits

00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:16.176 A:middle
to doing so.

00:22:17.376 --> 00:22:18.476 A:middle
While the Apple Developer

00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.796 A:middle
Enterprise Program still exists,

00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:22.476 A:middle
it's no longer the standard

00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:23.856 A:middle
mechanism for distributing

00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:25.026 A:middle
private internal apps.

00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:27.176 A:middle
There are some exceptions where

00:22:27.176 --> 00:22:28.906 A:middle
it still may be appropriate, but

00:22:28.906 --> 00:22:30.256 A:middle
for the vast majority of those

00:22:30.256 --> 00:22:31.826 A:middle
building private internal apps,

00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:33.776 A:middle
custom apps is going to be the

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:34.416 A:middle
way forward.

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:38.516 A:middle
In-house distribution, we'll

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:40.156 A:middle
just cover it so that you know

00:22:40.156 --> 00:22:41.346 A:middle
how it works if you do run into

00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:41.516 A:middle
it.

00:22:41.876 --> 00:22:43.166 A:middle
So, in-house distribution

00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.836 A:middle
enables you to control the

00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:47.056 A:middle
entire distribution process and

00:22:47.056 --> 00:22:48.026 A:middle
host the app yourself.

00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:50.226 A:middle
It requires membership into the

00:22:50.226 --> 00:22:51.376 A:middle
Apple Developer Enterprise

00:22:51.456 --> 00:22:53.236 A:middle
Program, but there are strict

00:22:53.236 --> 00:22:54.696 A:middle
eligibility requirements to get

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:56.826 A:middle
into that program, and it really

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:58.276 A:middle
is meant for those cases that

00:22:58.276 --> 00:22:59.616 A:middle
really can't be solved by custom

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.576 A:middle
app distribution.

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.576 A:middle
app distribution.

00:23:01.306 --> 00:23:02.696 A:middle
Regions where Apple business

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:04.836 A:middle
manager doesn't work, use cases

00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:05.616 A:middle
for state and federal

00:23:05.616 --> 00:23:07.406 A:middle
government, or use cases where

00:23:07.406 --> 00:23:08.736 A:middle
there are other intellectual

00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:10.586 A:middle
property issues could still

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:11.486 A:middle
qualify for in-house

00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
distribution.

00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:15.386 A:middle
Organizations utilizing in-house

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:17.336 A:middle
distribution should own and

00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:18.746 A:middle
maintain the source code so that

00:23:18.746 --> 00:23:20.016 A:middle
they can do their own build to

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:20.976 A:middle
maintain the project.

00:23:21.656 --> 00:23:22.846 A:middle
Distribution is handled

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:24.316 A:middle
completely outside of the App

00:23:24.316 --> 00:23:27.376 A:middle
Store by the organization and is

00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
usually done by MDM.

00:23:29.816 --> 00:23:32.936 A:middle
If you do find yourself in a

00:23:32.936 --> 00:23:34.116 A:middle
situation where you're leverage

00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:35.766 A:middle
in-house distribution, there are

00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:36.806 A:middle
a few things that you should be

00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:37.306 A:middle
aware of.

00:23:38.206 --> 00:23:40.166 A:middle
First and foremost, the apps

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:42.246 A:middle
that you deploy using in-house

00:23:42.276 --> 00:23:44.706 A:middle
distribution must only go to

00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:46.576 A:middle
your employees and cannot be

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:47.736 A:middle
made available to others.

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:50.226 A:middle
Apps are signed by the

00:23:50.226 --> 00:23:52.036 A:middle
organization with a distribution

00:23:52.036 --> 00:23:53.416 A:middle
certificate, and that

00:23:53.596 --> 00:23:54.706 A:middle
certificate needs to be

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:55.086 A:middle
protected.

00:23:55.146 --> 00:23:57.906 A:middle
If it were to be compromised or

00:23:57.906 --> 00:23:59.806 A:middle
revoked for any reason, all of

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.156 A:middle
the apps that you deployed with

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.156 A:middle
the apps that you deployed with

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:02.436 A:middle
that certificate would stop

00:24:02.436 --> 00:24:04.546 A:middle
working immediately, and they

00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:06.306 A:middle
would need to be re-signed and

00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:07.016 A:middle
redeployed.

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.586 A:middle
As you might imagine, that could

00:24:09.586 --> 00:24:13.066 A:middle
be catastrophic for a business.

00:24:13.186 --> 00:24:14.666 A:middle
Additionally, certificates will

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.036 A:middle
expire every three years, and

00:24:16.476 --> 00:24:19.006 A:middle
the provisioning profiles expire

00:24:19.006 --> 00:24:19.506 A:middle
annually.

00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:20.756 A:middle
So you need to manage that

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:22.506 A:middle
certificate lifecycle and plan

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:23.826 A:middle
for frequent releases of your

00:24:23.826 --> 00:24:25.396 A:middle
app that are aligned with it.

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:28.236 A:middle
Beta testing and hosting of the

00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:29.656 A:middle
apps needs to be handled by the

00:24:29.656 --> 00:24:31.596 A:middle
organization and MDM, and

00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:33.576 A:middle
there's no TestFlight access for

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:34.306 A:middle
enterprise accounts.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:36.956 A:middle
Apps are also going to need

00:24:36.986 --> 00:24:38.376 A:middle
periodic access to the internet,

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:40.846 A:middle
which makes it very difficult to

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:42.706 A:middle
deploy apps in air gap networks.

00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:46.696 A:middle
Based on what we just talked

00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:48.506 A:middle
about, in-house distribution

00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:49.966 A:middle
isn't going to be a good fit for

00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:50.316 A:middle
Acme.

00:24:51.506 --> 00:24:53.466 A:middle
Let's move onto Custom Apps.

00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:54.826 A:middle
This is the new way forward.

00:24:55.346 --> 00:24:58.006 A:middle
This scenario could work one of

00:24:58.076 --> 00:24:58.496 A:middle
two ways.

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.316 A:middle
The developer could simply offer

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.316 A:middle
The developer could simply offer

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:02.536 A:middle
the app for sale to them via

00:25:02.756 --> 00:25:04.616 A:middle
Custom Apps under their own

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.086 A:middle
account, which would protect

00:25:06.086 --> 00:25:07.326 A:middle
their intellectual property.

00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:09.176 A:middle
This could be described as

00:25:09.226 --> 00:25:10.286 A:middle
business to business, and this

00:25:10.286 --> 00:25:11.336 A:middle
is actually the way that Custom

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:12.136 A:middle
Apps used to work.

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.546 A:middle
Alternatively, the developer

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:15.726 A:middle
could negotiate with Acme

00:25:15.726 --> 00:25:16.876 A:middle
Company and provide them source

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:18.436 A:middle
code, and they would handle the

00:25:18.436 --> 00:25:19.516 A:middle
submission of the Custom App

00:25:19.646 --> 00:25:21.606 A:middle
themselves under their own Acme

00:25:21.606 --> 00:25:23.386 A:middle
account, which we could describe

00:25:23.386 --> 00:25:24.406 A:middle
as business to self.

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.996 A:middle
Either way, Custom Apps is the

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:27.756 A:middle
right solution.

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:31.386 A:middle
How does Custom App distribution

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:31.646 A:middle
work?

00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:34.326 A:middle
Custom Apps are part of the

00:25:34.326 --> 00:25:36.046 A:middle
Apple Developer Program and are

00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:38.196 A:middle
hosted by Apple in Apple

00:25:38.196 --> 00:25:39.026 A:middle
Business Manager.

00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:41.896 A:middle
Custom Apps used to be available

00:25:41.896 --> 00:25:43.276 A:middle
only to developers selling an

00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:45.266 A:middle
app to another organization, but

00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.606 A:middle
you can now use it to distribute

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:48.146 A:middle
internally to your own employees

00:25:48.586 --> 00:25:49.876 A:middle
just like you would leverage

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.126 A:middle
in-house distribution.

00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:53.286 A:middle
This make it much easier to

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.076 A:middle
distribute apps to your

00:25:54.076 --> 00:25:56.976 A:middle
employees, and Custom Apps works

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.586 A:middle
for distributing to employees,

00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:01.456 A:middle
partners, clients, franchisees,

00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:01.456 A:middle
partners, clients, franchisees,

00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:02.246 A:middle
or affiliates.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.016 A:middle
Customers can also distribute

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:07.186 A:middle
licenses via MDM or leverage

00:26:07.186 --> 00:26:08.696 A:middle
redemption codes.

00:26:09.566 --> 00:26:11.066 A:middle
For those of you who are used to

00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:12.306 A:middle
the Apple Developer Enterprise

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:14.126 A:middle
Program, Custom Apps offers a

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:14.786 A:middle
lot of benefits.

00:26:15.546 --> 00:26:17.136 A:middle
You'll only need one program to

00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:18.556 A:middle
manage both your App Store and

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:20.086 A:middle
your internal apps.

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:22.046 A:middle
The apps won't expire, so you

00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:22.866 A:middle
don't need to worry about

00:26:22.866 --> 00:26:24.726 A:middle
distribution certs being revoked

00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:25.386 A:middle
or expiring.

00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:28.596 A:middle
While with in-house distribution

00:26:28.596 --> 00:26:29.666 A:middle
you could only distribute to

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.636 A:middle
employees, Custom Apps actually

00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:32.706 A:middle
allows you to reach a broader

00:26:32.706 --> 00:26:34.046 A:middle
audience, including business

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:34.676 A:middle
affiliates.

00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:37.456 A:middle
It's also easier to work with

00:26:37.456 --> 00:26:38.736 A:middle
third-party developers because

00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:40.516 A:middle
you can get and distribute an

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.276 A:middle
app from them without having

00:26:42.276 --> 00:26:43.576 A:middle
access to the source code, and

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:44.936 A:middle
there's no re-signing of

00:26:44.986 --> 00:26:45.896 A:middle
binaries involved.

00:26:47.066 --> 00:26:48.366 A:middle
You can also take advantage of

00:26:48.366 --> 00:26:50.036 A:middle
the App Store's auto update

00:26:50.036 --> 00:26:51.726 A:middle
infrastructure, features like

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.806 A:middle
caching and app thinning as well

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.586 A:middle
as the TestFlight and App Store

00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:57.876 A:middle
Connect tools.

00:26:58.046 --> 00:26:59.316 A:middle
Here's how you would actually go

00:26:59.316 --> 00:27:00.536 A:middle
about submitting a Custom App.

00:26:59.316 --> 00:27:00.536 A:middle
about submitting a Custom App.

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.246 A:middle
First, you would confirm that

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.636 A:middle
your account is properly set up

00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:05.776 A:middle
to support Custom Apps.

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.846 A:middle
Both app agreements need to be

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:09.566 A:middle
active, and you need to provide

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:11.196 A:middle
banking and tax information.

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:13.686 A:middle
You can leverage roles to define

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:15.226 A:middle
proper access for the project

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:17.036 A:middle
team once you have the app set

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:17.906 A:middle
up.

00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:20.786 A:middle
A developer would create a new

00:27:20.786 --> 00:27:22.316 A:middle
app identifier in the member

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:23.716 A:middle
center of the developer website

00:27:23.716 --> 00:27:25.926 A:middle
and also a new app record in App

00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:26.506 A:middle
Store Connect.

00:27:27.786 --> 00:27:29.416 A:middle
Anytime that you want to list a

00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.216 A:middle
custom app for sale, you need to

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.376 A:middle
create a new app ID and a new

00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:34.016 A:middle
app record.

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:36.246 A:middle
The same bundle identifier

00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:38.176 A:middle
cannot be available in both the

00:27:38.236 --> 00:27:40.596 A:middle
public App Store and privately

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:41.296 A:middle
as a custom app.

00:27:41.906 --> 00:27:43.226 A:middle
They're totally separate apps

00:27:43.546 --> 00:27:45.436 A:middle
with separate bundle InDesign.

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:48.386 A:middle
Next, you would upload a build

00:27:48.696 --> 00:27:49.896 A:middle
and attach it to the working

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:53.946 A:middle
version in App Store Connect.

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.156 A:middle
Beta testing would be done with

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:55.676 A:middle
TestFlight.

00:27:56.766 --> 00:27:58.286 A:middle
When Beta Testing is complete,

00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:00.506 A:middle
all of the app metadata and

00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:00.506 A:middle
all of the app metadata and

00:28:00.506 --> 00:28:01.836 A:middle
finalized marketing material

00:28:01.836 --> 00:28:03.656 A:middle
should be verified and added.

00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:08.286 A:middle
You would then list the app for

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.156 A:middle
sale as a custom app in the

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:11.616 A:middle
pricing and availability

00:28:11.616 --> 00:28:12.086 A:middle
section.

00:28:13.396 --> 00:28:15.096 A:middle
Note, once an app is submitted

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:17.036 A:middle
for review as either a custom

00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:19.026 A:middle
app or a public app, you can't

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:20.596 A:middle
go back and change the audience

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:22.666 A:middle
from public to private for vice

00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:23.596 A:middle
versa later on.

00:28:24.276 --> 00:28:25.896 A:middle
To list the app for sale as a

00:28:25.896 --> 00:28:27.076 A:middle
custom app for business, you

00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:29.556 A:middle
need to provide the customer's

00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:31.786 A:middle
DEP ID and organization name.

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:35.636 A:middle
The DEP ID is a unique

00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:36.996 A:middle
identifier given to the

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:38.706 A:middle
organization when they enroll in

00:28:38.706 --> 00:28:39.836 A:middle
Apple Business Manager.

00:28:42.076 --> 00:28:44.206 A:middle
Finally, you would submit the

00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:45.016 A:middle
app for review.

00:28:46.426 --> 00:28:47.536 A:middle
Once it's approved and

00:28:47.536 --> 00:28:49.636 A:middle
available, you customer can

00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:53.646 A:middle
purchase and distribute the app.

00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:55.416 A:middle
Purchasing is done through Apple

00:28:55.416 --> 00:28:56.246 A:middle
Business Manager.

00:28:56.846 --> 00:28:58.336 A:middle
The customer would enroll at

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.436 A:middle
business.apple.com, and with

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.436 A:middle
business.apple.com, and with

00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:02.156 A:middle
this program, they can buy App

00:29:02.156 --> 00:29:03.836 A:middle
Store apps, custom apps and

00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:05.626 A:middle
books in bulk, and deploy to

00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:06.746 A:middle
their devices and users.

00:29:07.486 --> 00:29:08.836 A:middle
They can also do app license

00:29:08.836 --> 00:29:09.406 A:middle
management.

00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:11.566 A:middle
Note that this needs to be set

00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:13.006 A:middle
up in advance of you listing the

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:14.246 A:middle
app for sale as a custom app

00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:16.236 A:middle
because you need that DEP ID and

00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:18.556 A:middle
organization name to distribute

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:20.226 A:middle
the app to them.

00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.536 A:middle
And Custom Apps will also be

00:29:21.536 --> 00:29:22.836 A:middle
available for Apple School

00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:23.936 A:middle
Manager this fall.

00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:27.646 A:middle
This is what Apple Business

00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:28.516 A:middle
Manager looks like.

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:30.766 A:middle
Your customer will see the app

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:32.046 A:middle
that you are listing for sale

00:29:32.046 --> 00:29:35.056 A:middle
for them under the Custom Apps

00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:36.026 A:middle
section.

00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:37.556 A:middle
Let's review what this process

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.326 A:middle
looks like end-to-end for both

00:29:39.326 --> 00:29:40.626 A:middle
the customer and the developer.

00:29:41.556 --> 00:29:43.276 A:middle
The customer first provides you

00:29:43.596 --> 00:29:45.096 A:middle
with their organization name and

00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:46.306 A:middle
DEP ID from Apple Business

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:46.806 A:middle
Manager.

00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:49.806 A:middle
Once you have that, when you set

00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:51.026 A:middle
up the App in App Store Connect,

00:29:51.616 --> 00:29:52.966 A:middle
in the pricing and availability

00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:54.756 A:middle
section, you select to make it

00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:56.876 A:middle
available privately as a Custom

00:29:56.876 --> 00:29:59.196 A:middle
App for business and specify

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:00.846 A:middle
that DEP ID and organization

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:00.846 A:middle
that DEP ID and organization

00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
name.

00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:03.846 A:middle
Once the app is submitted and

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:05.586 A:middle
approved, the customer can then

00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.276 A:middle
go and purchase licenses of it

00:30:07.536 --> 00:30:08.706 A:middle
from Apple Business Manager.

00:30:09.306 --> 00:30:12.586 A:middle
If for some reason you aren't

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.796 A:middle
able to submit a custom app or

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.486 A:middle
your customer isn't able to see

00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:17.936 A:middle
an app that you've assigned to

00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:19.726 A:middle
them, here are a few places that

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:20.726 A:middle
you can troubleshoot.

00:30:21.576 --> 00:30:23.136 A:middle
First, on the developer side,

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
make sure both the free and paid

00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:27.376 A:middle
agreements are complete as well

00:30:27.376 --> 00:30:28.236 A:middle
as all of your banking

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:28.966 A:middle
information.

00:30:29.856 --> 00:30:31.406 A:middle
If the customer isn't able to

00:30:31.406 --> 00:30:33.056 A:middle
see the app, make sure that

00:30:33.056 --> 00:30:34.236 A:middle
Custom Apps are enabled for

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:36.146 A:middle
their account under settings and

00:30:36.146 --> 00:30:37.656 A:middle
enrollment info in Apple

00:30:37.656 --> 00:30:38.556 A:middle
Business Manager.

00:30:39.486 --> 00:30:40.986 A:middle
It also may take a few minutes

00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:43.016 A:middle
for the app to become visible in

00:30:43.056 --> 00:30:44.696 A:middle
Apple Business Manager, so just

00:30:44.696 --> 00:30:45.746 A:middle
give it a little bit of time,

00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.286 A:middle
and you can also consult the App

00:30:48.336 --> 00:30:49.686 A:middle
Store Connect help page for more

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:50.336 A:middle
information.

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:54.806 A:middle
Here are a few things to keep in

00:30:54.806 --> 00:30:56.926 A:middle
mind about Custom Apps.

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.356 A:middle
Customers need to have an Apple

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.466 A:middle
Business Manager account to

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.006 A:middle
purchase your app.

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.006 A:middle
purchase your app.

00:31:01.296 --> 00:31:02.806 A:middle
Apps have to support the

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:03.906 A:middle
countries that they will be

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:04.756 A:middle
distributed in.

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:07.996 A:middle
By default, an app is set up to

00:31:07.996 --> 00:31:09.616 A:middle
support all territories in App

00:31:09.616 --> 00:31:11.556 A:middle
Store Connect, and you shouldn't

00:31:11.556 --> 00:31:12.616 A:middle
change this unless you really

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:13.086 A:middle
need to.

00:31:13.966 --> 00:31:15.326 A:middle
It's expected that if you're

00:31:15.326 --> 00:31:16.796 A:middle
utilizing redemption codes for

00:31:16.796 --> 00:31:18.776 A:middle
distribution that they won't be

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.216 A:middle
made publicly available, and

00:31:20.216 --> 00:31:21.706 A:middle
you'll instead make sure they

00:31:21.706 --> 00:31:23.076 A:middle
make it into the hands of your

00:31:23.076 --> 00:31:24.056 A:middle
specific users.

00:31:24.686 --> 00:31:27.466 A:middle
This is a new app that needs to

00:31:27.466 --> 00:31:29.626 A:middle
go through app review, and the

00:31:29.626 --> 00:31:30.716 A:middle
review team is going to need to

00:31:30.716 --> 00:31:31.766 A:middle
be able to access the full

00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:33.886 A:middle
functionality of the app.

00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:36.206 A:middle
And once submitted, apps can't

00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:37.876 A:middle
be moved between public and

00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:38.976 A:middle
private availability.

00:31:42.096 --> 00:31:43.746 A:middle
That concludes Custom Apps.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.916 A:middle
We've covered the four

00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:47.366 A:middle
distribution methods that you

00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:48.856 A:middle
have to choose from, and the

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:51.156 A:middle
easiest way to decide which is

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:52.626 A:middle
right for you is to think about

00:31:52.626 --> 00:31:54.816 A:middle
the audience for your app is

00:31:54.886 --> 00:31:56.186 A:middle
public or private.

00:31:56.186 --> 00:31:58.706 A:middle
Ad Hoc lets you distribute to a

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:00.966 A:middle
limited private audience for

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:00.966 A:middle
limited private audience for

00:32:00.966 --> 00:32:01.486 A:middle
testing.

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:03.066 A:middle
The App Store lets you

00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:04.226 A:middle
distribute apps to the general

00:32:04.286 --> 00:32:06.796 A:middle
public, and In-House and Custom

00:32:06.796 --> 00:32:08.346 A:middle
App distribution let you

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:09.766 A:middle
distribute apps privately.

00:32:10.446 --> 00:32:14.006 A:middle
Let's review the distribution

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.166 A:middle
scenarios that we talked about

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:15.576 A:middle
today.

00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:19.196 A:middle
What if the app is for the

00:32:19.196 --> 00:32:19.836 A:middle
general public?

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:21.946 A:middle
If the app is for the general

00:32:22.016 --> 00:32:24.846 A:middle
public, it belongs on the App

00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:26.756 A:middle
Store.

00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:27.986 A:middle
What if you don't want to give

00:32:27.986 --> 00:32:29.296 A:middle
up your intellectual property to

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:29.926 A:middle
an enterprise.

00:32:29.926 --> 00:32:31.646 A:middle
If you don't want to give up

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.246 A:middle
intellectual property, you can

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:34.676 A:middle
leverage Custom Apps to deliver

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:37.266 A:middle
them a private, completed app.

00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:39.036 A:middle
And if you're writing an app for

00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:40.326 A:middle
the company where the audience

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.826 A:middle
is the general public, you can

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.266 A:middle
also deliver them a binary to

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:45.036 A:middle
upload to their App Store

00:32:45.036 --> 00:32:46.426 A:middle
Connect account.

00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:49.536 A:middle
What if your customer doesn't

00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:50.806 A:middle
have an MDM solution?

00:32:52.026 --> 00:32:53.426 A:middle
The Custom Apps program along

00:32:53.426 --> 00:32:55.346 A:middle
with MDM can be used to deliver

00:32:55.346 --> 00:32:57.506 A:middle
apps to customers who don't have

00:32:57.586 --> 00:32:58.066 A:middle
MDM.

00:33:01.996 --> 00:33:03.356 A:middle
What if you're being paid as a

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:04.806 A:middle
consultant to build an app for a

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:05.236 A:middle
company?

00:33:05.876 --> 00:33:07.586 A:middle
So you can work in both the App

00:33:07.796 --> 00:33:08.826 A:middle
Store and the Custom Apps

00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:11.476 A:middle
program to, as a third-party

00:33:11.476 --> 00:33:12.656 A:middle
developer, to deliver an app to

00:33:12.656 --> 00:33:13.216 A:middle
someone else.

00:33:14.156 --> 00:33:15.486 A:middle
What if Apple Business Manager

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:17.106 A:middle
isn't available for my customer?

00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:18.886 A:middle
So, if Apple Business Manager

00:33:18.886 --> 00:33:20.506 A:middle
isn't available, your customer

00:33:20.506 --> 00:33:21.786 A:middle
should be able to leverage

00:33:22.026 --> 00:33:23.516 A:middle
in-house distribution providing

00:33:23.516 --> 00:33:24.946 A:middle
that they're building an app for

00:33:24.946 --> 00:33:25.676 A:middle
their employees.

00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:28.396 A:middle
And what if the app is employee

00:33:28.396 --> 00:33:28.876 A:middle
facing?

00:33:30.266 --> 00:33:31.756 A:middle
Employee facing or private apps

00:33:31.816 --> 00:33:33.176 A:middle
can be distributed with both

00:33:33.176 --> 00:33:35.706 A:middle
Custom Apps or In-House, and

00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:38.156 A:middle
what if you want to distribute

00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:39.726 A:middle
an app to your own organization?

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:42.346 A:middle
You can distribute to your own

00:33:42.346 --> 00:33:43.686 A:middle
organization using Custom Apps

00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:45.626 A:middle
or the In-House program.

00:33:46.376 --> 00:33:48.046 A:middle
To conclude this presentation, I

00:33:48.046 --> 00:33:49.366 A:middle
want to leave you with a quote

00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:49.936 A:middle
from a colleague.

00:33:51.376 --> 00:33:52.846 A:middle
"Apps are like cannonballs.

00:33:53.586 --> 00:33:54.486 A:middle
It's better to know where

00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
they're going before they

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:56.206 A:middle
deploy."

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.436 A:middle
Apple wants you to be successful

00:33:59.436 --> 00:34:00.536 A:middle
and scale your app in the

00:33:59.436 --> 00:34:00.536 A:middle
and scale your app in the

00:34:00.536 --> 00:34:02.296 A:middle
smartest possible way, which

00:34:02.296 --> 00:34:04.336 A:middle
means thinking carefully about

00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:05.636 A:middle
the user and the customer,

00:34:06.146 --> 00:34:07.216 A:middle
managing your versions

00:34:07.216 --> 00:34:09.206 A:middle
appropriately, and knowing and

00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:11.396 A:middle
understanding the guidelines or

00:34:11.396 --> 00:34:12.525 A:middle
our developer programs.

00:34:13.356 --> 00:34:14.676 A:middle
If you understand how this works

00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:16.505 A:middle
up front, you can pick the right

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:18.036 A:middle
distribution mechanism for your

00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.916 A:middle
app and deploy it to your users

00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:21.315 A:middle
without any friction.

00:34:22.966 --> 00:34:24.906 A:middle

What's New in Managing Apple

00:34:31.496 --> 00:34:32.755 A:middle
Devices if you want to learn

00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:33.076 A:middle
more.

00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:36.516 A:middle
Thank you, and enjoy the rest of
