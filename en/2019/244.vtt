[ Music ]

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone, my name is

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:18.016 A:middle
Sommer Panage, and I'm

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:19.246 A:middle
Engineering Manager on the

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.216 A:middle
Accessibility Team.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:22.586 A:middle
I'm excited to share with you

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:24.626 A:middle
three ways in which you can make

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:26.146 A:middle
your apps more visually

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:27.000 A:middle
accessible.

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:29.516 A:middle
We will be covering Dynamic Type

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.266 A:middle
as well as some great

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.756 A:middle
improvements to Reduce Motion

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
and an API that we brought over

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.826 A:middle
from Mac to iOS that we call

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.006 A:middle
Differentiate Without Color.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:41.896 A:middle
So let's get started with

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:42.576 A:middle
Dynamic Type.

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:45.676 A:middle
Dynamic Type is a feature that

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:47.926 A:middle
allows users to customize the

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.296 A:middle
size of the text on their

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:49.746 A:middle
screen.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.136 A:middle
Now for some users that might

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:54.906 A:middle
mean smaller text and for others

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:56.026 A:middle
that might be larger text.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:59.366 A:middle
Now for some larger text might

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.746 A:middle
just be a preference, but for

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.746 A:middle
just be a preference, but for

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:03.966 A:middle
others large text can be the

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.606 A:middle
difference between being unable

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.996 A:middle
to use their device and being

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:08.716 A:middle
able to use it.

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
When you're implementing Dynamic

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.376 A:middle
Type for your users, I'd like to

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:16.326 A:middle
remind you of four important

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:16.796 A:middle
principles.

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:21.456 A:middle
First, you make as much of your

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.206 A:middle
text dynamic as possible.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.026 A:middle
If the text can grow, it should grow.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.786 A:middle
Second, use as much of the

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:31.346 A:middle
screen width as possible.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.976 A:middle
Third, don't truncate text as it

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:36.336 A:middle
grows.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.246 A:middle
You'll want to display the same

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:40.266 A:middle
amount of text as your default UI.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.476 A:middle
And, finally, you should scale

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:44.856 A:middle
glyphs that appear next to text

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:47.636 A:middle
so that your UI continues to

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.176 A:middle
look balanced.

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.736 A:middle
In iOS, there are 11 different

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:54.076 A:middle
text styles that you can use

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:55.726 A:middle
with Dynamic Type all the way

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.676 A:middle
from titles down the captions

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:58.256 A:middle
and footnotes.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:02.636 A:middle
To use Dynamic Type for your UI

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.016 A:middle
labels, your UI text fields, and

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:06.866 A:middle
your UI text views, you just

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
need to use a preferred font for

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:10.985 A:middle
one of these text styles and

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:12.816 A:middle
you'll want to set the adjust

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.086 A:middle
font for content size categories

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:17.066 A:middle
flag to true on those views.

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.366 A:middle
This guarantees that your view

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:21.476 A:middle
will update whenever the user

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:23.736 A:middle
changes their font size even if

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:24.806 A:middle
your app is in the foreground.

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.086 A:middle
As of iOS 11, we made it easier

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:30.916 A:middle
for you to use Dynamic Type with

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.146 A:middle
your custom fonts as well.

00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:35.336 A:middle
You'll want to have one font and

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.536 A:middle
size mapped to each of the 11

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:39.356 A:middle
text styles that we saw

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:39.886 A:middle
previously.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.106 A:middle
Here I create my own dictionary

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:44.266 A:middle
of fonts for each style.

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:47.846 A:middle
Then I can look to see if I have

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:49.186 A:middle
a font for the given style.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:51.686 A:middle
If I do, then I scale it as

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.516 A:middle
appropriate using UI font

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:56.386 A:middle
metrics, and if not, then I fall

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.446 A:middle
back to that preferred system

00:02:58.446 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
font.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.466 A:middle
As I'm doing my awesome Dynamic

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:04.496 A:middle
Type work, I want to be able to

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.096 A:middle
see it and I can now easily

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:08.436 A:middle
preview it using the new Xcode

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:09.966 A:middle
environments overwrites pane

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:10.776 A:middle
seen here.

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:12.746 A:middle
I can just slide the Dynamic

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.016 A:middle
Type slider and instantly in the

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:17.000 A:middle
simulator see the results.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:21.116 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk to you

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:22.156 A:middle
about reduced motion.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.606 A:middle
So, motion is often an exciting

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.126 A:middle
and dynamic part of iOS.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.716 A:middle
We use motion in many places to

00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:30.696 A:middle
create a more immersive

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:31.986 A:middle
experience for our customers.

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:35.596 A:middle
However, for some users these

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.076 A:middle
effects might not be desirable.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.556 A:middle
One in three people has some

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:40.836 A:middle
form of motion sensitivity.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.216 A:middle
Now for most people this means

00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:44.876 A:middle
riding a roller coaster or maybe

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:46.616 A:middle
reading a book in the car, but

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
for a small subset of people

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:50.176 A:middle
that sensitivity could be

00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:51.816 A:middle
triggered by even looking at a

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:52.966 A:middle
screen with motion on it.

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:57.236 A:middle
To help iOS adapt to all

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.046 A:middle
customers, we already provide a

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
reduced motion setting in our

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
reduced motion setting in our

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.346 A:middle
accessibility settings to

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
disable things like weather and

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:05.466 A:middle
parallax effects in the system.

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.716 A:middle
And here's the reduce motion API

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.056 A:middle
that you might already be

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:10.606 A:middle
familiar with.

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
When reduced motion is on, your

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.176 A:middle
app should adapt its animations

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:15.516 A:middle
as well.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.456 A:middle
Now another motion effect is

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:20.636 A:middle
autoplaying video.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.176 A:middle
Here we see that as we scroll

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:24.916 A:middle
through the App Store trailers

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:26.716 A:middle
for the featured games begin to

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:26.836 A:middle
play.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.646 A:middle
Now while for some this might

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:30.946 A:middle
make them want to click in and

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.026 A:middle
learn more about a fun looking

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.056 A:middle
game; for others this behavior

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:35.906 A:middle
could be a bit jarring or

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:36.846 A:middle
perhaps it could trigger some

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:37.396 A:middle
anxiety.

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:41.156 A:middle
So that users can decide if they

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.706 A:middle
want to see autoplaying video,

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:44.936 A:middle
we're excited to announce a new

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:46.616 A:middle
motion setting this year for iOS

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:47.056 A:middle
13.

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:49.936 A:middle
Settings, accessibility, motion,

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:51.446 A:middle
auto-play video previews.

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:54.786 A:middle
With this setting disabled our

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:57.146 A:middle
apps such as App Store will no

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:58.406 A:middle
longer auto-play content like

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
trailers but rather they will

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
trailers but rather they will

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:01.756 A:middle
require user interaction to

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:02.606 A:middle
start and stop playback.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.756 A:middle
Auto-play video previews starts

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:08.006 A:middle
as enabled by default, but you

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.516 A:middle
can turn it off at any time.

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:11.856 A:middle
And, additionally, we've made

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:12.806 A:middle
this public API.

00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
If is video auto-play enabled is

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.206 A:middle
false, you should also make sure

00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:19.576 A:middle
that any videos in your apps

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:21.446 A:middle
provide a play or pause

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.686 A:middle
avoidance to your users.

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:24.656 A:middle
And, of course, always listen

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.116 A:middle
for that notification to know

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:26.876 A:middle
when you should change your

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:27.266 A:middle
behavior.

00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:31.246 A:middle
Now if your app already provides

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:32.976 A:middle
an in-app setting, you'll simply

00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:34.876 A:middle
want to mirror that, mirror our

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.336 A:middle
global setting as your default.

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:39.466 A:middle
However, you can still use the

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.566 A:middle
setting in your app to allow

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:41.536 A:middle
users to customize your

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:41.926 A:middle
behavior.

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.746 A:middle
Another form of motion in iOS is

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:48.116 A:middle
a transition from one screen to

00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:48.386 A:middle
another.

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:51.716 A:middle
Here we see the typical sliding

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:53.026 A:middle
transition as we navigate

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:54.886 A:middle
through our settings app.

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:01.206 A:middle
To provide even more

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:03.326 A:middle
fine-grained control over the

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:04.896 A:middle
types of motion that a customer

00:06:04.936 --> 00:06:06.696 A:middle
experiences on iOS, we've

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:08.436 A:middle
introduced an additional setting

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:10.146 A:middle
when reduced motion is enabled

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:12.356 A:middle
and this is called prefer

00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:13.516 A:middle
Cross-fade Transitions.

00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:16.536 A:middle
As you can see, by enabling that

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:19.076 A:middle
setting, my lateral slides have

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.976 A:middle
become dissolved transitions in

00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:21.106 A:middle
the app.

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.636 A:middle
Now UIKit implements these

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.076 A:middle
dissolved transitions for you

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.346 A:middle
when the setting is enabled.

00:06:26.816 --> 00:06:28.846 A:middle
So as long as you're using UIKit

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.586 A:middle
standard navigation or modal

00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:31.886 A:middle
presentation, you'll get this

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:33.000 A:middle
behavior for free.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.046 A:middle
Finally, I'd like to talk to you

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.266 A:middle
about Differentiate Without

00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:38.546 A:middle
Color.

00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:42.346 A:middle
So colorblindness might cause

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:44.006 A:middle
numerous colors that appear

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.906 A:middle
different to some to appear very

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:47.926 A:middle
similar to others.

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:50.296 A:middle
For those with deuteranopia, for

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:52.656 A:middle
example, some reds and greens

00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:54.616 A:middle
and yellows might all look very

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:55.226 A:middle
much the same.

00:06:56.306 --> 00:06:57.646 A:middle
To see how this might impact

00:06:57.716 --> 00:06:59.306 A:middle
users and how we're solving for

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:00.806 A:middle
it, I'd like to show you this

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:00.806 A:middle
it, I'd like to show you this

00:07:00.806 --> 00:07:02.146 A:middle
little app that my colleagues

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:02.766 A:middle
and I worked on.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.716 A:middle
So we all really like peanut

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:07.486 A:middle
butter, and I just added a new

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:09.266 A:middle
feature so that I can track my

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:10.596 A:middle
personal peanut butter status.

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:12.516 A:middle
I've added green circles to the

00:07:12.556 --> 00:07:13.836 A:middle
peanut butters that I currently

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:16.576 A:middle
have, I've added yellow circles

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:17.606 A:middle
to the ones where I've eaten

00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:18.616 A:middle
them before but I don't have

00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:20.216 A:middle
them right now, and I've added

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:21.076 A:middle
red circles for the ones I

00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:21.806 A:middle
haven't tried yet.

00:07:23.446 --> 00:07:24.806 A:middle
Now if my friend wants to use

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:26.456 A:middle
this app but they happen to be

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:28.186 A:middle
colorblind, this might be how it

00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:28.536 A:middle
looks.

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.146 A:middle
As you can see, all of the

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:31.486 A:middle
circles kind of blend together.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:36.576 A:middle
Now, as of iOS 13, this user can

00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:37.446 A:middle
go over to settings,

00:07:37.746 --> 00:07:39.426 A:middle
accessibility, display in text

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:41.546 A:middle
size and turn this on --

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
Differentiate Without Color.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:48.496 A:middle
As a developer, I can just check

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.256 A:middle
should Differentiate, Without

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:51.936 A:middle
Color and observe the

00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:53.316 A:middle
Differentiate Without Color to

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:54.266 A:middle
change notification.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.926 A:middle
If the setting is true, any

00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:58.476 A:middle
place in my app where I use

00:07:58.476 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
color as the only way of

00:07:58.476 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
color as the only way of

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:02.016 A:middle
conveying information, I should

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:03.106 A:middle
now add some additional

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:03.646 A:middle
indicator.

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:05.366 A:middle
For example, a shape.

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:09.816 A:middle
So back to my peanut butter app,

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:10.836 A:middle
when I see that the user has

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:12.226 A:middle
turned on Differentiate Without

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.376 A:middle
Color I now replace my circles

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:17.526 A:middle
with a green check, a yellow

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:22.176 A:middle
question mark and a red X.

00:08:22.966 --> 00:08:24.356 A:middle
So now even if the app appears

00:08:24.356 --> 00:08:26.566 A:middle
like this, we can still discern

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:27.706 A:middle
the status of my different

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:28.236 A:middle
peanut butters.

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:31.016 A:middle
Now you might be thinking, hey,

00:08:31.016 --> 00:08:31.766 A:middle
Sommer, wait a minute.

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:33.606 A:middle
The app actually just looks

00:08:33.606 --> 00:08:34.385 A:middle
better this way.

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:36.176 A:middle
Why even bother with the plain

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:36.885 A:middle
circle version?

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:38.806 A:middle
And you'd be totally right.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:42.436 A:middle
In fact, when possible, you

00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:43.966 A:middle
should not rely on color alone

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:44.896 A:middle
to signal meaning.

00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:46.826 A:middle
Now in the case of my peanut

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.116 A:middle
butter app, that's easy.

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:49.116 A:middle
I can just get rid of the

00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
circles, but it's not always

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:51.726 A:middle
that easy.

00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:55.266 A:middle
Here we see the game Causality.

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:57.876 A:middle
The game play is actually

00:08:57.876 --> 00:08:59.396 A:middle
indicated by the color on the

00:08:59.486 --> 00:08:59.856 A:middle
screen.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:02.336 A:middle
Now this might not be enough

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:04.956 A:middle
information for all users and so

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.466 A:middle
the game creators provide a

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:07.636 A:middle
colorblind mode that you see

00:09:07.636 --> 00:09:08.156 A:middle
here.

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.756 A:middle
When that's enabled, the players

00:09:11.756 --> 00:09:12.836 A:middle
and the targets now have

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:14.926 A:middle
symbolic flags above their heads

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:15.986 A:middle
and associated.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.586 A:middle
The game designers might not

00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:20.366 A:middle
have wanted this extra symbol

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:22.116 A:middle
noise in the original design,

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:25.296 A:middle
but for some users this actually

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:26.956 A:middle
is what makes the game playable.

00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:29.656 A:middle
And that's it.

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:32.866 A:middle
With that we've seen three ways

00:09:33.116 --> 00:09:34.706 A:middle
that we can make our apps more

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:36.456 A:middle
visually accessible to all of

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:37.056 A:middle
our customers.

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:39.716 A:middle
We can support all text sizes

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:42.266 A:middle
with Dynamic Type, we can adapt

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.386 A:middle
via new motion settings for our

00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:45.766 A:middle
customers that might have motion

00:09:45.766 --> 00:09:49.196 A:middle
sensitivities, and we can convey

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:50.596 A:middle
information in different ways

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.016 A:middle
when we check Differentiate

00:09:52.016 --> 00:09:52.526 A:middle
Without Color.

00:09:54.216 --> 00:09:55.426 A:middle
Thank you all so much for your

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:55.656 A:middle
time.

00:09:56.516 --> 00:10:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
