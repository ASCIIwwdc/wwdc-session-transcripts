00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:19.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Boris and I'm

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:20.536 A:middle
a member of the Xcode team.

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:22.246 A:middle
Welcome to the session Creating

00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:22.946 A:middle
Swift Packages.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.096 A:middle
Likely you have already heard

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.036 A:middle
about the Xcode support for

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:29.506 A:middle
packages, but today you'll learn

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:31.096 A:middle
how to create your own.

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:37.576 A:middle
We'll talk about five main

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:38.206 A:middle
things today.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.386 A:middle
We learn about how to create

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:41.516 A:middle
your own local package.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.626 A:middle
We'll learn about how to publish

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:44.826 A:middle
it.

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:47.476 A:middle
We'll tell you a little bit more

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:49.356 A:middle
about the package manifest API.

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.056 A:middle
And how to edit packages.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:54.966 A:middle
And finally, I'll tell you about

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.766 A:middle
the Swift package manager open

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.496 A:middle
source project.

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.446 A:middle
We had another session about

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.446 A:middle
We had another session about

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:02.286 A:middle
packages already.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.196 A:middle
It was called adopting Swift

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:05.796 A:middle
packages.

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:08.896 A:middle
You should watch that as well

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:11.186 A:middle
and because there's other relevant

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.206 A:middle
information there such as how to

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:15.036 A:middle
resolve package resolution

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:18.686 A:middle
conflicts and also it goes into

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.686 A:middle
some details about the basics of

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:21.956 A:middle
packages if you haven't heard

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.746 A:middle
anything about them yet.

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:29.036 A:middle
Packages are a great way to

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:31.576 A:middle
share code, both within your

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.876 A:middle
workspace with your team, or

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:35.206 A:middle
with a wider open source

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:35.746 A:middle
community.

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.316 A:middle
Let's first take a look at how

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:42.446 A:middle
to create our own local

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:42.976 A:middle
packages.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.896 A:middle
You can think of local packages

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.466 A:middle
as being similar to subprojects

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.366 A:middle
in a workspace.

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:53.236 A:middle
They are platform-independent in

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.496 A:middle
nature so that you can use your

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:57.056 A:middle
code across all of Apple's

00:01:57.056 --> 00:01:58.726 A:middle
platforms in a straightforward

00:01:58.946 --> 00:01:59.000 A:middle
way.

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:01.756 A:middle
They're great for refractoring

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:03.606 A:middle
out reusable code.

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.636 A:middle
They're not versioned but once

00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:09.006 A:middle
you're ready, you can publish

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:10.406 A:middle
them in just a few steps.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:14.086 A:middle
Let's take a look at how to

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:16.186 A:middle
create our own local packages in

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:16.926 A:middle
our first demo.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.436 A:middle
For this demo, we're going to

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:19.776 A:middle
use an app that shows the lunch

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.586 A:middle
menu of a couple of cafes near

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:22.186 A:middle
where I work.

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:24.616 A:middle
We have both an iOS and a

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:26.166 A:middle
watchOS version of the app.

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:28.596 A:middle
And right now we have this data

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:30.016 A:middle
model here that is shared

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.016 A:middle
between the two, just using

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:32.856 A:middle
target membership.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.266 A:middle
As we evolve our app, that

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.196 A:middle
actually gets a little bit

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:38.746 A:middle
cumbersome.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.666 A:middle
So I want to refractor it into a

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:41.516 A:middle
local package.

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:44.696 A:middle
To get started with this, we go

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:47.136 A:middle
to File, New, Swift Package.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:51.506 A:middle
We'll call the package food and

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:52.206 A:middle
stuff.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:55.416 A:middle
We'll add it to our existing

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.966 A:middle
project and to its root group

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
and just click Create.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
and just click Create.

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:03.256 A:middle
Now, Xcode creates the basic

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:04.776 A:middle
structure of the package for us

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.666 A:middle
including Readme, the Package

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.916 A:middle
that's with Manifest File,

00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:10.366 A:middle
Sources, and Tests.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:15.646 A:middle
We take our data model code from

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.476 A:middle
our app and just drag it into

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.386 A:middle
the package.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:21.016 A:middle
Now, next we want to link this

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:21.786 A:middle
code with our app.

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.986 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at the

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:25.886 A:middle
manifest file which describes

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:27.646 A:middle
how the package is being built,

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:29.076 A:middle
and there's a section called

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.606 A:middle
Products where we define a

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:31.116 A:middle
library.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:33.336 A:middle
This library we can link with

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:33.736 A:middle
our app.

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:36.186 A:middle
We'll go into more details about

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:37.346 A:middle
the manifest and the Products

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:38.466 A:middle
section later in the talk.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.566 A:middle
But for now, we can go over to

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:43.056 A:middle
the project editor, open the

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.996 A:middle
target for our iOS app, and we

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.376 A:middle
go to the Frameworks, Libraries,

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:48.626 A:middle
and Embedded Content section.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
We click Plus here and then we

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:52.106 A:middle
select the food and stuff

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.756 A:middle
library product from the list.

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:56.376 A:middle
We want to perform these same

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:57.976 A:middle
steps for the watch app.

00:03:58.566 --> 00:03:59.736 A:middle
So we go to that target.

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:01.476 A:middle
Go to the same section.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:03.766 A:middle
Click plus again, and also link

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.736 A:middle
this with our package product.

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:10.016 A:middle
So, packages also bring one or

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:11.216 A:middle
more modules.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:12.526 A:middle
So, we have to import those

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:15.186 A:middle
modules into our app.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.406 A:middle
In this case, we have just one.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:19.666 A:middle
We go to the code of iOS app.

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.186 A:middle
Import the module here.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.706 A:middle
And we'll do the same for our

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:26.066 A:middle
watch app.

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:32.076 A:middle
Now, since we have made some

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:33.496 A:middle
larger changes to our workspace,

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:34.586 A:middle
the preview was paused.

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:36.316 A:middle
So let's press command + option

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:37.686 A:middle
+ P to resume it.

00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:41.706 A:middle
And there we have our app

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:43.496 A:middle
working as it did before.

00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:45.726 A:middle
So in just a few steps, we

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:48.086 A:middle
refractored our reusable code

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:49.476 A:middle
into our own local package.

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:51.676 A:middle
And you might've also noticed

00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:52.696 A:middle
that we did not have to

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:54.116 A:middle
configure anything explicitly

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.036 A:middle
about platforms.

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:57.096 A:middle
This is because packages are

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.566 A:middle
platform-independent in nature.

00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:00.556 A:middle
So, they build for whatever the

00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:00.556 A:middle
So, they build for whatever the

00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:01.386 A:middle
client needs.

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.526 A:middle
In this case, our scheme does

00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:05.276 A:middle
both an iOS and a watch app.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:07.096 A:middle
So, the package product gets

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:09.316 A:middle
built twice, once for iOS and

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:10.166 A:middle
once for watchOS.

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:11.976 A:middle
And this is all automatically

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:12.826 A:middle
handled by Xcode.

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:14.986 A:middle
And finally, this gives a good

00:05:14.986 --> 00:05:17.146 A:middle
first step for publishing a

00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:17.666 A:middle
package.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:18.936 A:middle
But before we do that, let's

00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:20.426 A:middle
head back to the slides to learn

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:22.000 A:middle
a bit more about this.

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:29.686 A:middle
You just learned about local

00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:30.186 A:middle
packages.

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:31.986 A:middle
Now let's take a look at how you

00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:33.796 A:middle
would publish a package in order

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.886 A:middle
to share it with a broad

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:35.446 A:middle
audience.

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:37.406 A:middle
Before we look at the concrete

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:38.766 A:middle
steps for publishing a package,

00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:39.946 A:middle
we have to learn about

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:40.456 A:middle
versioning.

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.126 A:middle
More specifically, about

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:44.486 A:middle
semantic versioning with Swift

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:45.456 A:middle
packages utilized.

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:48.996 A:middle
To make sure you can benefit

00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:50.696 A:middle
from bug fixes of your

00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.256 A:middle
dependencies without

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:53.686 A:middle
constant churn, Swift packages

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:55.286 A:middle
adhere to semantic versioning.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.546 A:middle
This is a wide-view standard

00:05:57.616 --> 00:05:58.976 A:middle
which assigns specific semantic

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:00.306 A:middle
meaning to each of the

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:00.306 A:middle
meaning to each of the

00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:01.756 A:middle
components of a version number.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.006 A:middle
The major version signifies

00:06:05.046 --> 00:06:06.456 A:middle
breaking changes to the API

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.986 A:middle
which require updating existing

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:09.526 A:middle
clients.

00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:11.716 A:middle
For example, this would be

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:13.146 A:middle
renaming an existing type,

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
removing a method, or changing a

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:16.436 A:middle
method's signature.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.406 A:middle
But this also may include any

00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:20.196 A:middle
backwards incompatible bug fixes

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.796 A:middle
or major behavior changes to

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:23.316 A:middle
existing API.

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:26.096 A:middle
Update the minor version, the

00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:27.406 A:middle
functional ID is added in a

00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:28.706 A:middle
backwards compatible manner.

00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:30.716 A:middle
For example, adding a new method

00:06:30.816 --> 00:06:33.186 A:middle
or type.

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:35.076 A:middle
Increase the patch version when

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:36.036 A:middle
you're making backwards

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:37.146 A:middle
compatible bug fixes.

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:39.296 A:middle
This allows clients to benefit

00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:40.836 A:middle
from bug fixes to your packages

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:42.256 A:middle
without incurring any

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:45.256 A:middle
maintenance burden.

00:06:45.396 --> 00:06:47.196 A:middle
Major version zero is a special

00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:48.696 A:middle
case which you can use during

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:49.596 A:middle
initial development.

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:51.936 A:middle
Changes to minor and patch

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.636 A:middle
versions can also break API.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.596 A:middle
This simplifies work during

00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:56.926 A:middle
bringup, but you should be

00:06:56.926 --> 00:06:59.146 A:middle
shipping a 1.0 release as people

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.416 A:middle
start adopting your package.

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.416 A:middle
start adopting your package.

00:07:00.896 --> 00:07:03.826 A:middle
Once you've been publishing your

00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:06.006 A:middle
package for awhile, your clients

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:07.076 A:middle
will expect stable APIs.

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.766 A:middle
You can use prerelease versions

00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:11.696 A:middle
to ask your clients to test APIs

00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:13.896 A:middle
before you make the final

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:14.936 A:middle
release for a version.

00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:20.296 A:middle
You can opt in to prerelease

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:21.846 A:middle
versions by adding a prerelease

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:23.236 A:middle
identifier to your version

00:07:23.236 --> 00:07:23.686 A:middle
rules.

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.436 A:middle
In this example, I used beta 1

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:28.326 A:middle
in the lower bound.

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:33.046 A:middle
Note that this opts you in to

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:34.516 A:middle
resolving prerelease versions

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:35.476 A:middle
but you're still getting

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
updates.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.906 A:middle
For example, here I've got beta

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:38.366 A:middle
6.

00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.676 A:middle
Once the stable version 5 is

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.166 A:middle
released, package resolution

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.356 A:middle
will automatically pick that,

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:44.736 A:middle
but you should remove the

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:46.236 A:middle
prerelease identifier once

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:47.096 A:middle
you're done with testing.

00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:50.606 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:07:50.656 --> 00:07:51.956 A:middle
concrete steps for publishing a

00:07:51.956 --> 00:07:53.000 A:middle
package in the next demo.

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.146 A:middle
We go back right where we left

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.146 A:middle
We go back right where we left

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:02.416 A:middle
off from the first demo.

00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:06.556 A:middle
And to get started, I will drag

00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:10.856 A:middle
the package out of the project.

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.776 A:middle
Now, you want to hold option

00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:14.146 A:middle
while dropping, so you make a

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:14.556 A:middle
copy.

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:17.866 A:middle
You close the project, open up

00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:19.546 A:middle
this in Finder and double-click

00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:20.606 A:middle
the package that's with File.

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.076 A:middle
This opens up the package

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:25.086 A:middle
standalone, similar to how a

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:25.706 A:middle
project would.

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:27.936 A:middle
And if we take a look at the Run

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:30.016 A:middle
destinations, we see that we

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:32.086 A:middle
also get Mac and tvOS, even

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.155 A:middle
though we were developing our

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:34.846 A:middle
package for iOS and watch

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:35.436 A:middle
before.

00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:37.586 A:middle
This again underlines the

00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:38.746 A:middle
packages are platform

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:39.686 A:middle
independent in nature.

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:41.296 A:middle
No special configuration is

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:43.006 A:middle
needed in order to build them

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:44.696 A:middle
for all of Apple's platforms in

00:08:44.696 --> 00:08:45.106 A:middle
Xcode.

00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:47.436 A:middle
Now, since you're publishing the

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:48.696 A:middle
package, let's flesh out the

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:49.426 A:middle
Readme a little bit.

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:54.226 A:middle
Let's say this package provides

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:59.726 A:middle
data models for representing a

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:08.316 A:middle
food menu and loading it from

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:08.316 A:middle
food menu and loading it from

00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:08.856 A:middle
JSON.

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:11.786 A:middle
Now, for a real package you want

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:13.466 A:middle
to include more information in

00:09:13.526 --> 00:09:15.526 A:middle
the Readme, such as how to use

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:17.676 A:middle
it, any platform restrictions,

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:19.266 A:middle
if you use platform-specific API

00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:22.166 A:middle
such as UIKit, and also

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:23.446 A:middle
information about licensing.

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.046 A:middle
But since this is just a demo,

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:26.236 A:middle
this will suffice for now.

00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:29.346 A:middle
Another thing you want to do is

00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:31.136 A:middle
add tests.

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.546 A:middle
Xcode created an example test

00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:35.526 A:middle
case for us earlier but we want

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:36.746 A:middle
to actually test our data model

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:36.956 A:middle
here.

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:44.086 A:middle
Let's create a food item and we

00:09:44.326 --> 00:09:48.096 A:middle
call it chicken with the price

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:49.006 A:middle
of $42.

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:52.896 A:middle
And let's make an assertion on

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:55.246 A:middle
the item's price to be exactly

00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:55.816 A:middle
that value.

00:09:56.476 --> 00:09:57.736 A:middle
Now, if we press Command + U,

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
our package builds and the tests

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
our package builds and the tests

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:02.436 A:middle
run, just as they would in a

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:02.986 A:middle
project.

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:05.396 A:middle
The tests are passing, so we can

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:05.706 A:middle
move on.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:08.266 A:middle
Let's first create a repository

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:09.016 A:middle
for our package.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:10.636 A:middle
To do that, we can open up the

00:10:10.636 --> 00:10:12.396 A:middle
source control menu and select

00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:14.776 A:middle
the Create Repositories option.

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.456 A:middle
Xcode preselected a package for

00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:19.346 A:middle
us, so we can just click Create.

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:21.806 A:middle
This creates a repository

00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:23.976 A:middle
locally and commits our current

00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:24.286 A:middle
state.

00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:27.086 A:middle
But we also need a repository in

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:27.446 A:middle
GitHub.

00:10:27.716 --> 00:10:29.136 A:middle
We can create that right from

00:10:29.136 --> 00:10:30.406 A:middle
within Xcode as well.

00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:32.646 A:middle
Let's go to the SEM navigator.

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:34.646 A:middle
Open up the context menu in the

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
repository, and select the

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
Create Remote option.

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:40.866 A:middle
Since I already configured my

00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:42.026 A:middle
GitHub account in Xcode

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:44.096 A:middle
preferences, it is automatically

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:44.936 A:middle
preselected here.

00:10:45.116 --> 00:10:46.786 A:middle
We could change the repository

00:10:46.786 --> 00:10:48.116 A:middle
name but we'll leave it as is

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:49.446 A:middle
and we'll also leave out the

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:50.556 A:middle
optional description for now.

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:52.286 A:middle
We'll set the visibility to

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:53.876 A:middle
private though because I want to

00:10:53.876 --> 00:10:55.056 A:middle
just share this package with my

00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:56.716 A:middle
team for now, not with a broad

00:10:56.716 --> 00:10:57.086 A:middle
audience.

00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:59.626 A:middle
Let's click Create.

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:03.076 A:middle
Xcode creates the package,

00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:06.076 A:middle
creates the repository on GitHub

00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:07.486 A:middle
and pushes our current state

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:10.106 A:middle
there, just in one step.

00:11:10.326 --> 00:11:11.446 A:middle
Now we have published our

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:13.046 A:middle
package but we also want to

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:14.516 A:middle
publish our first version.

00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:16.436 A:middle
For this, we go back to the

00:11:16.436 --> 00:11:18.326 A:middle
context menu here and select the

00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:19.406 A:middle
Tag Master option.

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:23.326 A:middle
We want to release version 1.0.0

00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:25.566 A:middle
and we leave the message blank

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:25.936 A:middle
for now.

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:29.466 A:middle
This creates a tag locally, so

00:11:29.466 --> 00:11:30.476 A:middle
we still have to push it to

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:30.886 A:middle
GitHub.

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:32.566 A:middle
To do that, we go back to the

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.276 A:middle
source control menu, select the

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.016 A:middle
Push option.

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:38.636 A:middle
To check the checkbox to include

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:39.976 A:middle
tags so they're actually pushing

00:11:39.976 --> 00:11:41.946 A:middle
tags, and click push.

00:11:47.636 --> 00:11:49.026 A:middle
Now that we have published our

00:11:49.026 --> 00:11:50.626 A:middle
package on GitHub, let's take a

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.516 A:middle
look at it.

00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:53.926 A:middle
Select the View in GitHub option

00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:55.906 A:middle
here from the context menu, and

00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:59.356 A:middle
this opens it up right there.

00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:02.046 A:middle
So, we could end the demo here,

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:04.016 A:middle
but as a final step, I want to

00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:05.216 A:middle
reintegrate the remote version

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:06.646 A:middle
of the package into our lunch

00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:07.366 A:middle
app from earlier.

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:08.656 A:middle
So, I click the clone

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.776 A:middle
or download button and copy the

00:12:10.776 --> 00:12:11.416 A:middle
URL from here.

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:15.376 A:middle
We close Safari, Xcode, as well

00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:15.916 A:middle
as Finder.

00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
And we go back to Xcode's

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:20.556 A:middle
welcome window and open up the

00:12:20.556 --> 00:12:22.136 A:middle
lunch project again.

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:26.726 A:middle
Here we open the file menu and

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.096 A:middle
this new Swift package's

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:28.756 A:middle
submenu.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.896 A:middle
This menu contains a couple of

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:34.186 A:middle
options for working with

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.296 A:middle
packages but I want to add a

00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:38.266 A:middle
package dependency.

00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:42.396 A:middle
Let's copy the URL here.

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.946 A:middle
The default version rules that

00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:51.836 A:middle
Xcode recommends for us includes

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:53.496 A:middle
the 1.0.0 version that we just

00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:53.996 A:middle
published.

00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:55.236 A:middle
So, we can click Next here.

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:59.506 A:middle
The package was resolved, and

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:02.256 A:middle
now we see the selection of

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:02.256 A:middle
now we see the selection of

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:02.776 A:middle
products.

00:13:02.776 --> 00:13:03.766 A:middle
We want to link the library

00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:05.596 A:middle
product against our iOS app.

00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.656 A:middle
So, we click Finish here.

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:11.666 A:middle
Now I actually forgot to do one

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.426 A:middle
thing just now, which is

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:15.626 A:middle
deleting the local package that

00:13:15.626 --> 00:13:16.406 A:middle
we had from earlier.

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:18.346 A:middle
So, I will do that now and move

00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:19.176 A:middle
it to the trash.

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.696 A:middle
And now we're actually fetching

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:22.466 A:middle
the remote version.

00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:26.416 A:middle
Let's take a look at the this

00:13:26.596 --> 00:13:28.696 A:middle
Swift package dependency section

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:29.746 A:middle
in the Project Navigator.

00:13:30.256 --> 00:13:31.576 A:middle
This shows all your package

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:32.276 A:middle
dependencies.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.676 A:middle
So, because we linked the

00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:42.506 A:middle
product as part of the assistant

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:44.226 A:middle
workflow, it's already linked

00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:45.366 A:middle
against our iOS app.

00:13:45.846 --> 00:13:48.516 A:middle
But we also have to add it to

00:13:49.086 --> 00:13:50.076 A:middle
the watch app.

00:13:50.516 --> 00:13:51.746 A:middle
To do that, we go back to the

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:52.866 A:middle
frameworks, libraries, and

00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:53.736 A:middle
embedded content phase.

00:13:54.756 --> 00:13:57.236 A:middle
Hit plus here, and select the

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.016 A:middle
package product.

00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:02.136 A:middle
Now we can go back to our

00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:02.136 A:middle
Now we can go back to our

00:14:02.136 --> 00:14:02.726 A:middle
preview.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:04.656 A:middle
Resume it.

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:09.126 A:middle
And we can see that works as it

00:14:09.126 --> 00:14:09.646 A:middle
did before.

00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:12.036 A:middle
So, with just a few steps, we

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:13.956 A:middle
were able to publish a package.

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:15.756 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides.

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:23.846 A:middle
Next, I'd like to invite my

00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:25.066 A:middle
colleague, Ankit, onto the

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:26.686 A:middle
stage, to tell you a little bit

00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:28.506 A:middle
more about the package manifest

00:14:28.906 --> 00:14:29.000 A:middle
API.

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:33.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Boris.

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:35.346 A:middle
Boris has showed you how you can

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:36.916 A:middle
use a local package in your

00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:38.656 A:middle
Xcode project and how you can

00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:40.306 A:middle
publish it to share it with an

00:14:40.306 --> 00:14:41.376 A:middle
even wider audience.

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:43.476 A:middle
In this section, we will learn

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:44.866 A:middle
more about the package manifest

00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:46.856 A:middle
APIs that are used to configure

00:14:46.856 --> 00:14:47.406 A:middle
packages.

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:51.516 A:middle
A Swift package is a directory

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.766 A:middle
that contains

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:53.796 A:middle
package.swift manifest file.

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:56.296 A:middle
The first line of the manifest

00:14:56.566 --> 00:14:57.966 A:middle
is always the Swift tools

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:58.356 A:middle
version.

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.436 A:middle
This is a minimum version of

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.436 A:middle
This is a minimum version of

00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:02.366 A:middle
Swift Compiler that is required

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:03.346 A:middle
to build your package.

00:15:04.066 --> 00:15:05.556 A:middle
We will learn more about this

00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.586 A:middle
later in the talk.

00:15:07.796 --> 00:15:08.616 A:middle
Then we have the package

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.256 A:middle
description import statement.

00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:12.326 A:middle
This is a library provided by

00:15:12.326 --> 00:15:14.526 A:middle
Xcode that contains the APIs

00:15:14.526 --> 00:15:16.296 A:middle
using the manifest file.

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.766 A:middle
Finally, we have the package

00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:20.926 A:middle
initializer statement.

00:15:21.566 --> 00:15:23.216 A:middle
The entire package is configured

00:15:23.216 --> 00:15:24.356 A:middle
using the single package

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.396 A:middle
initializer statement.

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:27.546 A:middle
In this case, I just have the

00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:29.296 A:middle
name of the package so that it's

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:29.806 A:middle
at a target.

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:33.306 A:middle
Swift packages have a standard

00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:34.136 A:middle
layout for targets.

00:15:35.146 --> 00:15:36.766 A:middle
Library targets are under a

00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:38.666 A:middle
directory called Sources and

00:15:38.766 --> 00:15:40.586 A:middle
each target should have its own

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:41.256 A:middle
subdirectory.

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:43.966 A:middle
They are then declared in the

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:45.316 A:middle
Target section of the package

00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:45.986 A:middle
initializer.

00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:48.306 A:middle
The standard layout is really

00:15:48.306 --> 00:15:49.926 A:middle
powerful because you don't need

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
to individually list your source

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.696 A:middle
files in the manifest.

00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:54.446 A:middle
You just drop them in the right

00:15:54.446 --> 00:15:56.036 A:middle
directory and Xcode will

00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:57.126 A:middle
automatically pick them up.

00:15:58.566 --> 00:15:59.636 A:middle
If I wanted to add another

00:15:59.636 --> 00:16:01.466 A:middle
target, I would create a new

00:15:59.636 --> 00:16:01.466 A:middle
target, I would create a new

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:03.476 A:middle
subdirectory and then declare

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.876 A:middle
the target in the manifest file.

00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
Test targets are under a

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:10.806 A:middle
directory called Tests, and they

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:11.766 A:middle
also have their own

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:12.366 A:middle
subdirectory.

00:16:12.926 --> 00:16:15.496 A:middle
They are declared using the test

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:18.116 A:middle
target API and since test

00:16:18.116 --> 00:16:19.516 A:middle
targets are usually testing

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:20.916 A:middle
another target, you need to

00:16:20.916 --> 00:16:22.316 A:middle
declare our dependency on the

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.686 A:middle
target it is testing.

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:25.756 A:middle
This is done using the

00:16:25.756 --> 00:16:27.616 A:middle
dependencies parameter of the

00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:28.456 A:middle
test target API.

00:16:29.176 --> 00:16:32.936 A:middle
As a final step, we need to

00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:34.506 A:middle
declare our product for our

00:16:34.506 --> 00:16:34.926 A:middle
package.

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:36.696 A:middle
Products are used to export

00:16:36.786 --> 00:16:38.616 A:middle
target from a package so other

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:39.656 A:middle
packages can use them.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:42.066 A:middle
In this case, I have a library

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:43.716 A:middle
product that is exporting my

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:44.786 A:middle
single library target.

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:49.386 A:middle
We just saw how a basic Swift

00:16:49.386 --> 00:16:50.366 A:middle
package is configured.

00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:52.236 A:middle
Now let's see how we can add

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.586 A:middle
support for our Swift packages

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.326 A:middle
in the existing Xcode project.

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:59.416 A:middle
I have a project called Menu

00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:01.016 A:middle
Downloader that I've been using

00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:01.016 A:middle
Downloader that I've been using

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.516 A:middle
with other package managers like

00:17:02.546 --> 00:17:04.016 A:middle
CocoParts and Carthage.

00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:08.705 A:middle
It has a Swift target, some

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:11.786 A:middle
legacy C code, Xcode project

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:13.856 A:middle
file, and a PartSpec file that

00:17:13.856 --> 00:17:15.685 A:middle
is used by the CoCoParts package

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:16.386 A:middle
manager.

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:19.616 A:middle
To begin, all you need to do is

00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:21.286 A:middle
add the package.swift manifest

00:17:21.286 --> 00:17:23.536 A:middle
file, and now you are ready to

00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:25.996 A:middle
configure its targets.

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:27.586 A:middle
Starting with the legacy C code,

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:30.656 A:middle
we first give it a name and then

00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:31.336 A:middle
a custom path.

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:33.906 A:middle
We have to do this because this

00:17:33.946 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
target is not under the standard

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:36.456 A:middle
sources directory.

00:17:37.796 --> 00:17:39.636 A:middle
I also found out that there's a

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:41.276 A:middle
macro in the C code that

00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:43.366 A:middle
downloads a secret lunch menu if

00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:43.906 A:middle
defined.

00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:46.856 A:middle
So, I define that using the C

00:17:47.426 --> 00:17:49.726 A:middle
settings API.

00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:51.836 A:middle
Similarly, we can configure our

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.326 A:middle
Swift target by giving it a

00:17:53.326 --> 00:17:55.636 A:middle
custom path and then declaring a

00:17:55.636 --> 00:17:58.606 A:middle
dependency on the legacy C

00:18:00.596 --> 00:18:00.796 A:middle
target.

00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:02.236 A:middle
This package has two products.

00:18:03.026 --> 00:18:04.986 A:middle
The first product exports Swift

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:06.926 A:middle
target, and the second product

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:07.946 A:middle
exports our C target.

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:10.266 A:middle
We are exporting our C target

00:18:10.266 --> 00:18:12.446 A:middle
separately because some of our

00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:14.856 A:middle
users might be using the C

00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:16.736 A:middle
target directly and they don't

00:18:16.736 --> 00:18:18.726 A:middle
need the Swift bridge in that

00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:19.000 A:middle
case.

00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:23.146 A:middle
It is also marked because I know

00:18:23.146 --> 00:18:25.036 A:middle
some of our users load this

00:18:25.066 --> 00:18:28.986 A:middle
library at some time.

00:18:29.196 --> 00:18:30.266 A:middle
Now, let's see how package

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
dependencies are configured in a

00:18:32.856 --> 00:18:33.000 A:middle
package.

00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:36.576 A:middle
Package dependencies are in a

00:18:36.576 --> 00:18:39.176 A:middle
section called Dependencies and

00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:42.386 A:middle
they have two components - a

00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:43.866 A:middle
source URL and a version

00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:44.446 A:middle
requirement.

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:47.466 A:middle
In this case, I'm using uptoNextMajor

00:18:47.466 --> 00:18:48.576 A:middle
version requirement.

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.126 A:middle
This means my package needs a

00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:52.886 A:middle
version of yams starting from

00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:54.946 A:middle
major version 2 and going up to

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:56.376 A:middle
the next major version which

00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:57.996 A:middle
will be 3, according to semantic

00:18:57.996 --> 00:18:58.456 A:middle
versioning.

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:00.816 A:middle
uptoNextMajor is the

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:00.816 A:middle
uptoNextMajor is the

00:19:00.816 --> 00:19:02.096 A:middle
recommended way to declare

00:19:02.226 --> 00:19:03.216 A:middle
version requirements.

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:06.226 A:middle
This is because it allows you to

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:08.366 A:middle
specify a minimum version as

00:19:08.366 --> 00:19:09.736 A:middle
explicit often for the next

00:19:09.736 --> 00:19:10.346 A:middle
major version.

00:19:10.896 --> 00:19:12.236 A:middle
And it is flexible enough to

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.226 A:middle
avoid potential conflicts in

00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:15.466 A:middle
your package craft.

00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:18.286 A:middle
This also has a shorthand, which

00:19:18.286 --> 00:19:19.926 A:middle
is just called from.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:22.516 A:middle
There are some other types of

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:24.106 A:middle
version-based requirements.

00:19:24.856 --> 00:19:26.946 A:middle
We just saw from and uptoNextMajor

00:19:26.946 --> 00:19:27.516 A:middle
from.

00:19:28.786 --> 00:19:30.446 A:middle
There's uptoNextMinor, which

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:32.366 A:middle
allows you to declare version

00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:33.876 A:middle
requirement on the next minor

00:19:33.876 --> 00:19:35.016 A:middle
component of a version.

00:19:36.006 --> 00:19:37.656 A:middle
This is useful if you want to be

00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:39.026 A:middle
conservative about the changes

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:40.126 A:middle
you take.

00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:42.966 A:middle
Then we have exact version

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:43.466 A:middle
requirement.

00:19:43.986 --> 00:19:45.276 A:middle
This allows us to pin our

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:46.766 A:middle
dependency to a specific

00:19:46.826 --> 00:19:47.246 A:middle
version.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.606 A:middle
We do not recommend using this

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:50.846 A:middle
unless you really need it

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:55.016 A:middle
because it can lead to more

00:19:55.016 --> 00:19:55.083 A:middle
conflicts in your package craft.

00:19:56.636 --> 00:19:57.756 A:middle
There are also some

00:19:57.756 --> 00:19:59.236 A:middle
nonversion-based requirements.

00:19:59.776 --> 00:20:02.276 A:middle
There's branch-based dependency

00:19:59.776 --> 00:20:02.276 A:middle
There's branch-based dependency

00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:03.756 A:middle
which is useful if you want to

00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:05.546 A:middle
develop multiple packages and

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:08.326 A:middle
you want to keep them in sync.

00:20:08.506 --> 00:20:09.596 A:middle
And there's revision-based

00:20:09.596 --> 00:20:11.306 A:middle
requirement, which is useful to

00:20:11.406 --> 00:20:12.546 A:middle
pin our dependency to our

00:20:12.656 --> 00:20:13.816 A:middle
specific revision.

00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:16.436 A:middle
Note that both branch and

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:18.176 A:middle
revision-based requirements are

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.276 A:middle
not allowed in published

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:19.746 A:middle
packages.

00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:22.126 A:middle
You must remove all branch and

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.306 A:middle
revision-based requirements

00:20:23.726 --> 00:20:25.136 A:middle
before you publish a package.

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:28.376 A:middle
Now, after selecting our package

00:20:28.376 --> 00:20:30.776 A:middle
dependency, we need to declare

00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:32.996 A:middle
dependency on one or more of its

00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:33.536 A:middle
products.

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.026 A:middle
In this case, I'm declaring

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:39.616 A:middle
dependency on yams product in

00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:42.566 A:middle
our Swift target.

00:20:42.696 --> 00:20:43.776 A:middle
Now let's come back to Swift

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:44.406 A:middle
Tools version.

00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:46.976 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, the

00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:48.556 A:middle
Swift Tools version is always

00:20:48.556 --> 00:20:50.046 A:middle
the first line of the manifest.

00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:52.936 A:middle
And like every other API, the

00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:54.866 A:middle
package description API also

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:56.566 A:middle
evolves over time and the

00:20:56.566 --> 00:20:58.216 A:middle
version of the library you get

00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:00.136 A:middle
comes from the Tools version.

00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:00.136 A:middle
comes from the Tools version.

00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:03.176 A:middle
It also participates in the

00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:04.576 A:middle
dependency resolution process.

00:21:05.336 --> 00:21:07.416 A:middle
And Xcode ensures that the Tools

00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:09.306 A:middle
version of all of your package

00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:10.796 A:middle
dependencies are always

00:21:10.796 --> 00:21:13.216 A:middle
compatible with Tools version of

00:21:13.866 --> 00:21:15.556 A:middle
your package.

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:17.776 A:middle
Finally, it declares the minimum

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:19.656 A:middle
version of Swift compiler that

00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:20.896 A:middle
is required to build your

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:21.166 A:middle
package.

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:23.936 A:middle
This is useful for producing

00:21:23.936 --> 00:21:25.896 A:middle
good diagnostics in case

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:27.126 A:middle
somebody tries to use your

00:21:27.126 --> 00:21:28.676 A:middle
package with an older

00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:30.246 A:middle
incompatible version of Xcode.

00:21:30.766 --> 00:21:34.706 A:middle
As Boris mentioned earlier,

00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:37.016 A:middle
Swift packages are always

00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:38.086 A:middle
platform independent.

00:21:39.126 --> 00:21:40.196 A:middle
If your package supports

00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
multiple platforms and you have

00:21:42.016 --> 00:21:43.976 A:middle
some platform-specific code, we

00:21:43.976 --> 00:21:45.206 A:middle
can use Swift's conditional

00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:46.106 A:middle
compilation features.

00:21:46.726 --> 00:21:48.696 A:middle
And for platform's start

00:21:48.696 --> 00:21:50.936 A:middle
support availability, Xcode

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:52.366 A:middle
assigns our default deployment

00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:53.526 A:middle
target for each of them.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.336 A:middle
You can customize the deployment

00:21:56.336 --> 00:21:58.726 A:middle
target in the platform section

00:21:58.726 --> 00:21:59.956 A:middle
of the package initializer.

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:02.946 A:middle
Note that this does not restrict

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.276 A:middle
the platforms on which this

00:22:04.276 --> 00:22:05.116 A:middle
package can build.

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.286 A:middle
It only customizes it for

00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:08.026 A:middle
the listed platforms.

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:11.876 A:middle
In this case, I'm customizing

00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:15.256 A:middle
Mapworks to 10.15 and iOS to 13.

00:22:16.306 --> 00:22:17.566 A:middle
If your current Tools version

00:22:17.846 --> 00:22:19.336 A:middle
does not have the deployment

00:22:19.336 --> 00:22:21.626 A:middle
target API you want, you can use

00:22:21.626 --> 00:22:22.606 A:middle
the string-based API.

00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:26.366 A:middle
We just went through a lot of

00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:26.926 A:middle
APIs.

00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:29.786 A:middle
All package manifest APIs are

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.976 A:middle
documented and you can view the

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.576 A:middle
documentation in the generated

00:22:33.576 --> 00:22:34.446 A:middle
module interface.

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:36.796 A:middle
You can get to the generated

00:22:36.796 --> 00:22:38.686 A:middle
module interface by command

00:22:38.686 --> 00:22:40.056 A:middle
clicking package description

00:22:40.056 --> 00:22:42.146 A:middle
import statement in any manifest

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:42.376 A:middle
file.

00:22:43.706 --> 00:22:45.896 A:middle
With that, back to Boris for

00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:47.316 A:middle
talking about how to edit Swift

00:22:47.316 --> 00:22:47.756 A:middle
packages.

00:22:48.236 --> 00:22:48.536 A:middle
Thank you.

00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:55.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:55.766 --> 00:22:56.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ankit.

00:22:56.796 --> 00:23:00.036 A:middle
Once you have been publishing

00:22:56.796 --> 00:23:00.036 A:middle
Once you have been publishing

00:23:00.036 --> 00:23:02.656 A:middle
your package for awhile, to

00:23:02.656 --> 00:23:03.856 A:middle
share it with your team or the

00:23:03.856 --> 00:23:06.146 A:middle
open source community, you will

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:07.486 A:middle
likely need to work on it in the

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.046 A:middle
context of your app.

00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:10.196 A:middle
So, let's talk about editing

00:23:10.196 --> 00:23:10.706 A:middle
packages.

00:23:11.636 --> 00:23:13.576 A:middle
In the earlier demos, I edited

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:14.536 A:middle
packages in place.

00:23:15.036 --> 00:23:16.806 A:middle
One of them was a local package

00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:18.806 A:middle
that was built as part of a

00:23:18.806 --> 00:23:19.526 A:middle
workspace.

00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:21.176 A:middle
The other one was open

00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:22.516 A:middle
standalone by double clicking

00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:23.476 A:middle
package.swift.

00:23:23.816 --> 00:23:25.146 A:middle
Both are always editable.

00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:27.286 A:middle
Package dependencies, however,

00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:29.466 A:middle
are locked for editing, because

00:23:29.466 --> 00:23:30.916 A:middle
they're automatically managed by

00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:31.446 A:middle
Xcode.

00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:34.626 A:middle
If you look at the app from

00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:36.946 A:middle
earlier, our dependency on the

00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:38.116 A:middle
food and stuff package from

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:38.476 A:middle
GitHub.

00:23:38.886 --> 00:23:41.066 A:middle
If we now check out the package

00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:43.646 A:middle
standalone and add it to our

00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:45.566 A:middle
project as a local package, it

00:23:45.566 --> 00:23:46.926 A:middle
will override existing

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.246 A:middle
dependency without removing it.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:52.236 A:middle
The override is based on the

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:53.486 A:middle
last path component.

00:23:53.846 --> 00:23:55.116 A:middle
So since both of these have the

00:23:55.116 --> 00:23:57.086 A:middle
same, the local one will

00:23:57.086 --> 00:23:58.506 A:middle
override the remote dependency.

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:02.056 A:middle
Since local packages are always

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:02.056 A:middle
Since local packages are always

00:24:02.056 --> 00:24:04.916 A:middle
editable, you can edit the app

00:24:04.916 --> 00:24:06.466 A:middle
and the package together in this

00:24:06.466 --> 00:24:06.666 A:middle
way.

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:09.576 A:middle
Let's take a look at editing

00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:13.816 A:middle
packages in a demo.

00:24:14.236 --> 00:24:15.886 A:middle
Again, we go back right where we

00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:17.266 A:middle
left off in our earlier demo.

00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:22.196 A:middle
And if you remember, there's the

00:24:22.196 --> 00:24:23.406 A:middle
Swift Package Dependency

00:24:23.406 --> 00:24:25.656 A:middle
section, which shows the package

00:24:25.686 --> 00:24:26.886 A:middle
dependency that we added.

00:24:27.836 --> 00:24:28.976 A:middle
Now, since we already have a

00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:30.796 A:middle
checkout of the package

00:24:30.796 --> 00:24:32.306 A:middle
separately from earlier, we can

00:24:32.306 --> 00:24:33.766 A:middle
just drag it into our project.

00:24:34.096 --> 00:24:37.356 A:middle
And now the Swift Package

00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:38.806 A:middle
Dependency section disappears

00:24:39.286 --> 00:24:40.566 A:middle
because we are no longer using

00:24:40.566 --> 00:24:41.586 A:middle
the remote dependency.

00:24:41.586 --> 00:24:43.316 A:middle
We're using the local one.

00:24:47.876 --> 00:24:50.356 A:middle
So, our users have asked us for

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:51.666 A:middle
a new feature for the lunch app.

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.866 A:middle
They want to see which dishes

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:54.456 A:middle
they can eat.

00:24:54.636 --> 00:24:56.346 A:middle
So, we want to mark explicitly

00:24:56.696 --> 00:24:58.536 A:middle
which dish is vegetarian or not.

00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.756 A:middle
Thankfully, our data model

00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.756 A:middle
Thankfully, our data model

00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:01.636 A:middle
already includes that

00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:02.296 A:middle
information.

00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:06.646 A:middle
Not our data model, our

00:25:06.786 --> 00:25:07.636 A:middle
underlying data.

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:09.256 A:middle
We have to change the data model

00:25:09.256 --> 00:25:10.426 A:middle
to actually expose that.

00:25:11.066 --> 00:25:12.576 A:middle
Let's go to the package.

00:25:13.976 --> 00:25:15.476 A:middle
Open up the food item type.

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.056 A:middle
I'll add a new property here

00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:25.786 A:middle
called vegetarian of type

00:25:25.786 --> 00:25:27.336 A:middle
Bool.

00:25:27.336 --> 00:25:28.436 A:middle
Copy this part.

00:25:28.436 --> 00:25:30.826 A:middle
Add it as an argument to the

00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:31.606 A:middle
initializer.

00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:34.666 A:middle
And then finally we'll set the

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:38.946 A:middle
property to the initializer

00:25:38.946 --> 00:25:39.526 A:middle
argument.

00:25:40.136 --> 00:25:41.376 A:middle
So now we have the information

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:42.626 A:middle
on whether this is vegetarian or

00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:43.666 A:middle
not in the data model.

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:46.576 A:middle
Let's add something to our UI to

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:48.116 A:middle
indicate this to our users.

00:25:49.286 --> 00:25:51.216 A:middle
Go to the code for our iOS app.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:54.046 A:middle
Let's hide the project navigator

00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:55.166 A:middle
so that we have a little more

00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:57.886 A:middle
space, and resume the preview so

00:25:57.886 --> 00:25:58.946 A:middle
that we see what we're dealing

00:25:58.946 --> 00:25:59.076 A:middle
with.

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:02.086 A:middle
We can use the jump bar to go to

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:02.086 A:middle
We can use the jump bar to go to

00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:03.566 A:middle
the food item row view type.

00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:09.586 A:middle
And if we go to our UI code in

00:26:09.586 --> 00:26:11.386 A:middle
editor, we see highlighted that

00:26:11.386 --> 00:26:13.816 A:middle
this is representing each of the

00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:14.676 A:middle
table view cells.

00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:20.736 A:middle
So, I've prepared a snippet to

00:26:20.866 --> 00:26:23.716 A:middle
compute a label that uses the

00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:26.146 A:middle
food item's name but adds emoji

00:26:26.146 --> 00:26:27.486 A:middle
that represents whether a dish

00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:28.536 A:middle
is vegetarian or not.

00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:31.626 A:middle
And we can go to the text field

00:26:31.836 --> 00:26:33.036 A:middle
and use that label here.

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:37.996 A:middle
And let's resume the preview.

00:26:38.486 --> 00:26:42.066 A:middle
And then we can see that now for

00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:44.176 A:middle
each dish it's clearly marked if

00:26:44.176 --> 00:26:45.276 A:middle
it's vegetarian or not.

00:26:45.956 --> 00:26:47.526 A:middle
So, with these steps you can

00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:49.246 A:middle
edit your app and your package

00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:49.636 A:middle
together.

00:26:50.146 --> 00:26:52.416 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides.

00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:00.466 A:middle
This overriding behavior can

00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:00.466 A:middle
This overriding behavior can

00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:01.836 A:middle
also be used to edit the

00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:03.986 A:middle
packages you don't own, if you

00:27:03.986 --> 00:27:05.646 A:middle
need to fix bugs or make a small

00:27:05.646 --> 00:27:06.736 A:middle
change of the bug in your

00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:07.146 A:middle
problem.

00:27:08.976 --> 00:27:10.696 A:middle
To wrap things up, let's look

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:12.106 A:middle
into the Swift package manager's

00:27:12.156 --> 00:27:13.766 A:middle
open source project, which we'll

00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:15.136 A:middle
abbreviate as Swift PM.

00:27:15.796 --> 00:27:17.266 A:middle
Swift PM has been out for a

00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:18.896 A:middle
couple of years and Xcode

00:27:18.896 --> 00:27:20.576 A:middle
support of Swift packages is

00:27:20.576 --> 00:27:23.006 A:middle
built on top of it.

00:27:23.276 --> 00:27:24.676 A:middle
Swift is a cross-platform

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.496 A:middle
language and Swift PM is a

00:27:26.496 --> 00:27:28.186 A:middle
cross-platform built system for

00:27:28.186 --> 00:27:28.956 A:middle
Swift packages.

00:27:29.526 --> 00:27:31.476 A:middle
Using it, you can share code

00:27:31.626 --> 00:27:33.396 A:middle
between your client and server

00:27:34.346 --> 00:27:35.436 A:middle
side apps.

00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:37.226 A:middle
Swift PM consists of four

00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:38.736 A:middle
command line tools under the top

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:39.606 A:middle
level Swift command.

00:27:39.886 --> 00:27:41.596 A:middle
There's Swift build, to build a

00:27:41.596 --> 00:27:42.116 A:middle
package.

00:27:42.556 --> 00:27:44.256 A:middle
Swift run, to run the executable

00:27:44.256 --> 00:27:44.776 A:middle
products.

00:27:45.036 --> 00:27:46.496 A:middle
Swift test, to run tests.

00:27:47.146 --> 00:27:48.846 A:middle
And finally, Swift package, to

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:50.196 A:middle
perform various nonbuild

00:27:50.196 --> 00:27:51.686 A:middle
operations on the package.

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:54.166 A:middle
These command line tools can be

00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:55.816 A:middle
used to build packages for both

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:57.326 A:middle
macOS and Linux.

00:27:58.836 --> 00:28:01.146 A:middle
To learn more about the Swift PM

00:27:58.836 --> 00:28:01.146 A:middle
To learn more about the Swift PM

00:28:01.426 --> 00:28:03.156 A:middle
command line tool and future

00:28:03.156 --> 00:28:05.446 A:middle
ideas for its evolution, you can

00:28:05.446 --> 00:28:06.646 A:middle
check out the session, "Getting

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:07.966 A:middle
to Know Swift Package Manager"

00:28:07.966 --> 00:28:09.896 A:middle
from WWDC 2018.

00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:13.096 A:middle
Of course, you can also use

00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:14.726 A:middle
Xcode Build to build packages on

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.196 A:middle
the command line or on CI.

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:18.476 A:middle
This is also a way to build

00:28:18.476 --> 00:28:20.706 A:middle
packages for iOS, watchOS and

00:28:20.706 --> 00:28:21.956 A:middle
tvOS on the command line.

00:28:22.426 --> 00:28:25.216 A:middle
Swift package support in Xcode

00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:26.436 A:middle
is built on top of the

00:28:26.436 --> 00:28:28.376 A:middle
libSwiftPM library, which is

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:29.996 A:middle
part of the open source project.

00:28:30.946 --> 00:28:32.416 A:middle
libSwiftPM can be used to

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:33.856 A:middle
support Swift packages and other

00:28:33.856 --> 00:28:35.366 A:middle
developer tools for IDs.

00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:37.406 A:middle
We're excited to work with the

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:39.116 A:middle
community towards a stable API.

00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:42.946 A:middle
An example for this is

00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:44.856 A:middle
SourceKit-LSP, which is the

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.266 A:middle
implementation of the language

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:48.336 A:middle
server protocol - or LSP for

00:28:48.336 --> 00:28:50.176 A:middle
short - for Swift and C-based

00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:50.616 A:middle
languages.

00:28:51.466 --> 00:28:53.886 A:middle
The LSP defines the protocol

00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:55.926 A:middle
used between the editor or IDE

00:28:56.316 --> 00:28:57.686 A:middle
and a language server that

00:28:57.686 --> 00:28:59.286 A:middle
provides language features like

00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:01.026 A:middle
autocomplete, jump to

00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:01.026 A:middle
autocomplete, jump to

00:29:01.026 --> 00:29:02.206 A:middle
definition, or find our

00:29:02.206 --> 00:29:02.846 A:middle
references.

00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:05.666 A:middle
Using SourceKit-LSP, IDEs are

00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:06.996 A:middle
editors which support the

00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:08.616 A:middle
language server protocol, get

00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:09.726 A:middle
these features for Swift

00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:10.186 A:middle
packages.

00:29:10.396 --> 00:29:11.776 A:middle
And this was built on top of the

00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:13.206 A:middle
open source libSwiftPM.

00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:16.986 A:middle
Swift package manager is part of

00:29:16.986 --> 00:29:18.476 A:middle
the larger Swift open source

00:29:18.476 --> 00:29:18.966 A:middle
project.

00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:20.946 A:middle
The Swift.org website is a great

00:29:20.946 --> 00:29:22.306 A:middle
place where you can learn about

00:29:22.306 --> 00:29:23.696 A:middle
the community and process.

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:26.416 A:middle
Package manager follows the

00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:28.486 A:middle
Swift evolution process, just as

00:29:28.486 --> 00:29:30.146 A:middle
the rest of the Swift project.

00:29:30.436 --> 00:29:31.706 A:middle
Anyone can develop and

00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:33.646 A:middle
ultimately submit features or

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:34.446 A:middle
major changes.

00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:37.356 A:middle
Before you spend your time

00:29:37.356 --> 00:29:39.086 A:middle
drafting a proposal, drop by the

00:29:39.086 --> 00:29:40.466 A:middle
package manager section of the

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:42.226 A:middle
forums, start a conversation,

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:43.956 A:middle
and find others that have useful

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:44.836 A:middle
thoughts or feedback.

00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:49.046 A:middle
Swift packages currently only

00:29:49.046 --> 00:29:50.296 A:middle
supports source code and

00:29:50.296 --> 00:29:50.566 A:middle
unit tests.

00:29:51.596 --> 00:29:52.826 A:middle
We're looking forward to work

00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:53.986 A:middle
with the community to add

00:29:53.986 --> 00:29:55.686 A:middle
support for resources such as

00:29:55.686 --> 00:29:57.856 A:middle
images, text files, or other

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:00.216 A:middle
data files.

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:00.216 A:middle
data files.

00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:01.736 A:middle
We already have a draft proposal

00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:02.836 A:middle
for package resources.

00:30:02.976 --> 00:30:04.336 A:middle
You can follow along the process

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.626 A:middle
and influence how this feature

00:30:05.626 --> 00:30:06.766 A:middle
will look like.

00:30:09.936 --> 00:30:11.526 A:middle
Also on Swift.org, we have

00:30:11.526 --> 00:30:13.636 A:middle
regularly updated tool change so

00:30:13.636 --> 00:30:14.986 A:middle
you can try out the latest

00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:15.836 A:middle
changes yourself.

00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:18.016 A:middle
Changes to the open source

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.886 A:middle
project will also be part of

00:30:19.886 --> 00:30:21.326 A:middle
future versions of Xcode.

00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:25.886 A:middle
As a final takeaway, packages

00:30:25.936 --> 00:30:28.076 A:middle
are supported on Apple platforms

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:28.736 A:middle
and Xcode now.

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.196 A:middle
Look for reusable code in your

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:33.536 A:middle
project and refractor it into a

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:34.346 A:middle
Swift package.

00:30:35.216 --> 00:30:36.426 A:middle
We're excited about the

00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:37.856 A:middle
expanding Swift package

00:30:37.856 --> 00:30:38.436 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:30:39.016 --> 00:30:41.536 A:middle
If you have any further

00:30:41.536 --> 00:30:43.736 A:middle
questions about adopting or

00:30:43.736 --> 00:30:45.436 A:middle
creating packages, we have two

00:30:45.436 --> 00:30:46.326 A:middle
labs upcoming.

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:48.436 A:middle
One is today at 12 and the other

00:30:48.436 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
one is tomorrow at the same

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:50.346 A:middle
time.

00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:53.256 A:middle
Thank you very much for coming

00:30:53.306 --> 00:30:54.416 A:middle
and enjoy the rest of your week.

00:30:55.516 --> 00:30:59.506 A:middle
