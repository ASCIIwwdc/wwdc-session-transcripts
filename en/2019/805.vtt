00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:14.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Ian and I

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:15.816 A:middle
am an engineer on the Shortcuts

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.046 A:middle
Team.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:18.056 A:middle
Today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.696 A:middle
about how users can build their

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:21.546 A:middle
own shortcuts and how you can

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:22.896 A:middle
ensure that they have the best

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:23.996 A:middle
possible experience.

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:27.006 A:middle
I'm going to cover three topics

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:27.266 A:middle
today.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.136 A:middle
First, intents from your app can

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:31.866 A:middle
now be editable by the user as

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.336 A:middle
actions.

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.216 A:middle
I'm going to walk you through

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.616 A:middle
the parts of an action and show

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.046 A:middle
how users can configure them

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.266 A:middle
inside of their Shortcuts.

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.286 A:middle
You've built great Shortcuts and

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
we want to make sure that you

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:43.216 A:middle
can get them in front of your

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:44.076 A:middle
users, as well.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.896 A:middle
I'm going to talk about some

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:47.286 A:middle
ways that you can showcase the

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.836 A:middle
Shortcuts from your app using

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:50.736 A:middle
Add to Siri and other APIs.

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:53.266 A:middle
And later on, we're going to

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.026 A:middle
build a multistep shortcut and

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:56.596 A:middle
make actions that work great

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.326 A:middle
with others by using input and

00:00:58.326 --> 00:00:58.746 A:middle
output.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.176 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.176 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.766 A:middle
I have an app called Soup Chef.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.546 A:middle
And as you know, it's a super

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.296 A:middle
way to order clam chowder or

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.006 A:middle
tomato soup for delivery and

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:09.576 A:middle
pickup.

00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:11.876 A:middle
And Soup Chef has made an intent

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.446 A:middle
for ordering soup.

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:15.926 A:middle
So, here's that inside of the

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.596 A:middle
Shortcuts Editor, where actions

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:18.246 A:middle
are configured.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.276 A:middle
Every action can have parameters

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:22.806 A:middle
that can be edited by the user.

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:24.426 A:middle
And these parameters were

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.756 A:middle
defined inside of the Intent

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:26.616 A:middle
definition file.

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:29.676 A:middle
Until the user enters a value,

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:31.476 A:middle
parameters show the display

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:31.716 A:middle
name.

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:33.626 A:middle
And because this display name

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.436 A:middle
can sometimes be shown as a

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:37.916 A:middle
title in configuration UI, make

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.386 A:middle
sure that the display name is

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:40.506 A:middle
always capitalized.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:43.306 A:middle
The parameter summary is a

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:44.426 A:middle
sentence that's shown to the

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.046 A:middle
user that describes what the

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.506 A:middle
shortcut will do when it's run.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:49.626 A:middle
Summaries should read like a

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:51.306 A:middle
sentence and start with a verb.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.276 A:middle
There's no need to write the

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:54.816 A:middle
name of your app in the summary

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:56.476 A:middle
because it will be displayed at

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.056 A:middle
the top of the action alongside

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:58.956 A:middle
your app's icon.

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:01.836 A:middle
Try to keep the summary short

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.506 A:middle
and only include the parameters

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:04.746 A:middle
that must be filled out for the

00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:06.166 A:middle
action to be functional.

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:08.386 A:middle
And whichever parameters you

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:09.826 A:middle
don't include the summary will

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:11.076 A:middle
be displayed underneath Show

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:13.236 A:middle
More which the user can expand

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.616 A:middle
while editing to modify the

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:15.806 A:middle
values in the remaining

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:16.516 A:middle
parameters.

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:19.226 A:middle
Parameter summaries are defined

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:20.526 A:middle
in the Shortcuts app section in

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:22.086 A:middle
the Intent editor Xcode.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:24.836 A:middle
Soup Chef has multiple different

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:25.446 A:middle
summaries.

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.156 A:middle
One for ordering pickup and the

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:28.366 A:middle
other for ordering delivery.

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.326 A:middle
So, as the user changes between

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:32.716 A:middle
pickup and delivery inside of

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.216 A:middle
the action, the parameter

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.326 A:middle
summary will update based on the

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:37.966 A:middle
different values that the user

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.026 A:middle
has entered.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:43.456 A:middle
So, your app knows best about

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:45.026 A:middle
what the user does and when.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.016 A:middle
So, we think the most relevant

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:48.816 A:middle
place to create shortcuts is

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:49.826 A:middle
right inside of your app.

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:52.516 A:middle
Here we are inside of Soup Chef

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.766 A:middle
and someone just ordered some

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:54.986 A:middle
tomato soup with cheese.

00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:57.136 A:middle
And this is a great time to

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:58.516 A:middle
present an Add to Siri button

00:02:58.516 --> 00:02:59.976 A:middle
because the user just performed

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.136 A:middle
an action that they're very

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.136 A:middle
an action that they're very

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.036 A:middle
likely to repeat.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.836 A:middle
So, to do that, Soup Chef placed

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.196 A:middle
the order information into an

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:08.086 A:middle
intent and then, placed the Add

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.436 A:middle
to Siri button into the UI.

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:12.176 A:middle
When the user taps on that

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:13.546 A:middle
button, the app lets them create

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:15.046 A:middle
a shortcut by showing the Add to

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.116 A:middle
Siri View Controller.

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.656 A:middle
The API to do this has not

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.816 A:middle
changed since iOS 12 but this

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:22.166 A:middle
year, we've expanded what users

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.286 A:middle
can do inside of the View

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:23.776 A:middle
Controller.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.656 A:middle
So, let's look at what's new.

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:28.756 A:middle
First, and instead of having to

00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:30.176 A:middle
say the phrase to save the

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.916 A:middle
shortcut, users can now just

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:33.366 A:middle
type it or use dictation.

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:36.506 A:middle
Your app should be prefilling

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:37.616 A:middle
this value by setting the

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.266 A:middle
suggestedInvocationPhrase

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.566 A:middle
property of your intent.

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:42.906 A:middle
Try to keep this phrase short

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:44.336 A:middle
and descriptive about the kind

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.456 A:middle
of action that the user just

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:46.026 A:middle
did.

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:47.726 A:middle
And because the user will be

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
able to say this to Siri, it

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.406 A:middle
should also be easy to speak and

00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:51.896 A:middle
remember.

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:55.376 A:middle
Underneath that is the Do

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:56.556 A:middle
section, which will show the

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.026 A:middle
user a preview of what this

00:03:58.026 --> 00:03:59.386 A:middle
shortcut will do when it's run.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:01.596 A:middle
Make sure to put as much

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.286 A:middle
information as possible into the

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:04.676 A:middle
intent about what the user just

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:05.046 A:middle
did.

00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:06.646 A:middle
This will ensure that your app

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:08.746 A:middle
can order the soup again without

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:10.266 A:middle
having to ask too many follow-up

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:10.686 A:middle
questions.

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:14.196 A:middle
And if you've made your intent

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.026 A:middle
configurable, the user can tap

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:17.565 A:middle
on this, customize the shortcut,

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:18.896 A:middle
and change the values that were

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:20.505 A:middle
prefilled by, by you.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:23.286 A:middle
And once the user is done, they

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:24.836 A:middle
will tap the Add to Siri button

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:27.156 A:middle
and return back to your app.

00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:28.376 A:middle
And later on, they can go into

00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:29.836 A:middle
the Shortcuts app where they can

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.516 A:middle
view, edit, and run the shortcut

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:32.526 A:middle
that they've made.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.496 A:middle
So, now let's take a look at

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:35.896 A:middle
some places in the Shortcuts app

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:37.076 A:middle
where you can make your

00:04:37.456 --> 00:04:39.006 A:middle
shortcuts discoverable, as well.

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:41.986 A:middle
Many first-time users will start

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:43.576 A:middle
off in the right-most tab which

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:44.266 A:middle
is the Gallery.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:45.896 A:middle
Here is where we suggest

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:47.056 A:middle
prebuilt shortcuts.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.136 A:middle
In iOS 13, we added a new

00:04:50.136 --> 00:04:51.806 A:middle
section to the Gallery and it

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.536 A:middle
has suggested shortcuts from the

00:04:53.536 --> 00:04:54.906 A:middle
apps that are frequently used on

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:55.566 A:middle
your device.

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:57.796 A:middle
Now, your app's suggested

00:04:57.796 --> 00:04:59.246 A:middle
shortcuts have the possibility

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
of being prominently featured in

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
of being prominently featured in

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:02.066 A:middle
the Gallery depending on how

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:03.596 A:middle
frequently the user interacts

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
with your app.

00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:06.896 A:middle
Your app can influence the

00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:08.246 A:middle
suggestions that are displayed

00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:09.726 A:middle
in the Gallery in two different

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:09.966 A:middle
ways.

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:12.866 A:middle
First, you can explicitly set a

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:15.326 A:middle
list of suggested shortcuts and

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:16.056 A:middle
you can use the

00:05:16.056 --> 00:05:17.566 A:middle
INVoiceShortcutCenter to do

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:17.786 A:middle
this.

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:20.356 A:middle
You can update this as often as

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:21.726 A:middle
you'd like as you learn more

00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:23.076 A:middle
about your user's habits and

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:23.616 A:middle
preferences.

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.666 A:middle
And we also populate this list

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:28.526 A:middle
with recent or frequently used

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.036 A:middle
actions that the user has done

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.696 A:middle
inside of your app.

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:32.926 A:middle
Now, how does the Shortcuts app

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.336 A:middle
know what the user does inside

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:35.136 A:middle
of your app?

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:36.476 A:middle
In previous years, we've

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:37.876 A:middle
introduced the concept of

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:38.516 A:middle
Donation.

00:05:39.646 --> 00:05:41.116 A:middle
Now, Donation allows you to tell

00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:42.396 A:middle
the system about things that the

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:44.386 A:middle
user does so that the system can

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.966 A:middle
later suggest them at a relevant

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:46.316 A:middle
time.

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:49.226 A:middle
You can create a, you can donate

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:51.886 A:middle
by creating an INInteraction and

00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
putting a filled out intent

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:54.576 A:middle
about what the user just did

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:55.076 A:middle
into there.

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:57.526 A:middle
And then, later call the Donate

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:57.936 A:middle
method.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
Not only does Donate allow your

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
Not only does Donate allow your

00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:02.096 A:middle
shortcuts to appear in the

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.836 A:middle
Gallery, but it also enables

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.636 A:middle
private on-device Siri

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:07.176 A:middle
suggestions in places like the

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:09.106 A:middle
Lock Screen or Spotlight Search.

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:11.406 A:middle
If you'd like to know more

00:06:11.406 --> 00:06:12.366 A:middle
information about how

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:14.136 A:middle
suggestions from Donations work

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:16.206 A:middle
across the system, I encourage

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:17.746 A:middle
that you watch our talks from

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:19.866 A:middle
WWDC 2018.

00:06:21.126 --> 00:06:22.606 A:middle
Now, another time that users

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.026 A:middle
might be creating and

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.586 A:middle
discovering your shortcuts is

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.696 A:middle
when building a new shortcut

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:27.646 A:middle
inside of the app.

00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:30.536 A:middle
You'll see all of the possible

00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:32.176 A:middle
actions that can be added into

00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:33.326 A:middle
the shortcut in the Shortcuts

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:33.676 A:middle
editor.

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:35.976 A:middle
There's categories across the

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:37.866 A:middle
top which contain hundreds of

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.386 A:middle
built-in actions for things like

00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:41.306 A:middle
playing media, adding reminders,

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:42.976 A:middle
and also scripting actions like

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:44.226 A:middle
Loops and If statements.

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:48.086 A:middle
Next, is a list of suggested

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:48.656 A:middle
actions.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:50.216 A:middle
And these suggestions are based

00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:52.386 A:middle
also on device usage which

00:06:52.386 --> 00:06:53.416 A:middle
includes actions from

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.336 A:middle
third-party apps.

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:56.846 A:middle
Since I order soup a lot, Soup

00:06:56.846 --> 00:06:58.116 A:middle
Chef's action is right here at

00:06:58.116 --> 00:06:58.866 A:middle
the top.

00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:01.536 A:middle
So, how did Soup Chef get all of

00:07:01.536 --> 00:07:03.426 A:middle
these soup options to show up?

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.216 A:middle
Well, there were two easy steps

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:06.046 A:middle
to get this to work.

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:08.726 A:middle
The first thing is to select

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:10.166 A:middle
which of the parameters is the

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.056 A:middle
key parameter.

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:13.616 A:middle
Your key parameter should be the

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:15.306 A:middle
one that's most identifiable to

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:15.756 A:middle
the user.

00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:17.776 A:middle
And Soup Chef picked the soup

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:19.256 A:middle
type as the parameter because

00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:20.936 A:middle
that's the most useful to the

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
user, more than quantity or

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:23.196 A:middle
toppings.

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:26.516 A:middle
And the second step is to Donate

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:27.976 A:middle
every time the user performs

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:29.286 A:middle
that action inside of your app,

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:32.656 A:middle
if you're already donating via

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:34.726 A:middle
the INVoiceShortcutCenter or via

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.206 A:middle
INInteraction, then there's no

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.566 A:middle
additional work required by your

00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:37.896 A:middle
app.

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:39.936 A:middle
As long as your donation has a

00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:41.296 A:middle
value set for that key

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.176 A:middle
parameter, we can show it inside

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:43.916 A:middle
of suggestions.

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:47.166 A:middle
Also, don't forget to include an

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:48.486 A:middle
image for your key parameter

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:49.316 A:middle
when donating.

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.016 A:middle
If you don't provide an image,

00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:52.436 A:middle
then your app's icon will be

00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:53.836 A:middle
displayed in the list, instead.

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:56.416 A:middle
And additionally, if you're

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:57.726 A:middle
looking for a list of all of the

00:07:57.726 --> 00:07:59.106 A:middle
actions from your app that's

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
donated or not, you can tap on

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
donated or not, you can tap on

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:03.096 A:middle
the app's section to see them

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:03.266 A:middle
all.

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:06.346 A:middle
Now, let's switch gears and

00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:07.756 A:middle
build a shortcut with a set of

00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:09.326 A:middle
actions that work great together

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:11.276 A:middle
by using input and output.

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:13.846 A:middle
I have another app called

00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:14.566 A:middle
StickyNote.

00:08:14.696 --> 00:08:16.116 A:middle
And StickyNote's a notetaking

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:17.796 A:middle
app where I write down things

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:18.646 A:middle
that I need to do.

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:21.256 A:middle
StickyNote has a whole bunch of

00:08:21.256 --> 00:08:21.766 A:middle
actions.

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:23.326 A:middle
And most importantly, it has an

00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:24.816 A:middle
action where I can search for

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:25.676 A:middle
notes by name.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.466 A:middle
And then, once a note is found,

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.886 A:middle
there are other actions that can

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:32.275 A:middle
manipulate that note such as

00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:33.956 A:middle
inserting text into the note or

00:08:33.956 --> 00:08:35.106 A:middle
deleting it.

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.616 A:middle
In iOS 13, we now allow actions

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:40.216 A:middle
from your apps to output

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:41.905 A:middle
information for others to use.

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:43.966 A:middle
So, the Find StickyNote action

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:46.206 A:middle
can output a StickyNote with an

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:48.616 A:middle
identifier, name, content, and

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:49.606 A:middle
the last date that it was

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:50.116 A:middle
modified.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:53.216 A:middle
I want to be able to chain two

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:55.796 A:middle
shortcuts together and find a

00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:57.286 A:middle
note and then, add information

00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:58.126 A:middle
into that note.

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:00.206 A:middle
So, the note would be the output

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:00.206 A:middle
So, the note would be the output

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.986 A:middle
of the first action and I'm

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:03.346 A:middle
passing it as input to the

00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:03.706 A:middle
second.

00:09:05.016 --> 00:09:06.166 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how to

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.706 A:middle
set up your action to produce

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:07.956 A:middle
output.

00:09:11.016 --> 00:09:12.616 A:middle
First, we'll click on the plus

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:14.376 A:middle
button at the bottom left to add

00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:15.776 A:middle
a new type representing what a

00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:16.736 A:middle
StickyNote is.

00:09:18.096 --> 00:09:19.896 A:middle
Types already have an identifier

00:09:19.896 --> 00:09:20.836 A:middle
and the Display Name.

00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:23.406 A:middle
But the note has content and a

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:24.716 A:middle
date that it was last modified.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:25.696 A:middle
So, we'll add those as

00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:27.546 A:middle
properties so the user can

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:29.006 A:middle
access all of that information.

00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:32.286 A:middle
Next, we'll select the response.

00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:34.076 A:middle
And the response is the object

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:35.626 A:middle
representing the result of the

00:09:35.626 --> 00:09:35.916 A:middle
intent.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:38.916 A:middle
We will add a note property,

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:40.546 A:middle
selecting the new type that we

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.066 A:middle
just made.

00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:43.696 A:middle
And finally, we'll select that

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:45.386 A:middle
property from the Output

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:45.906 A:middle
dropdown.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:47.476 A:middle
So, if your response has

00:09:47.476 --> 00:09:49.886 A:middle
multiple properties, you need to

00:09:49.886 --> 00:09:51.086 A:middle
pick a single one from that

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:52.186 A:middle
Output dropdown.

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:53.596 A:middle
And this lets you control what

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:55.256 A:middle
information other actions can

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:55.626 A:middle
see.

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:58.576 A:middle
So, now that our action has

00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:01.296 A:middle
output, I can add one action and

00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:01.296 A:middle
output, I can add one action and

00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:02.846 A:middle
after the other and select the

00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:04.486 A:middle
found note as the note that I

00:10:04.486 --> 00:10:07.196 A:middle
want to add text to.

00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:08.986 A:middle
But for actions to work really

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:10.356 A:middle
great together, it would be nice

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:11.936 A:middle
if the note could automatically

00:10:11.936 --> 00:10:13.206 A:middle
be filled in to the second

00:10:13.206 --> 00:10:14.586 A:middle
action, so I don't have to

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:16.126 A:middle
select it from the first every

00:10:16.126 --> 00:10:16.796 A:middle
single time.

00:10:17.946 --> 00:10:19.766 A:middle
So, if you need your actions to

00:10:20.156 --> 00:10:21.756 A:middle
work great together and fill

00:10:21.756 --> 00:10:23.526 A:middle
output from one into the input

00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:25.006 A:middle
of another, you need to select

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:26.436 A:middle
one of your parameters as the

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:27.176 A:middle
input parameter.

00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:29.406 A:middle
Here we are looking at that Add

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:30.536 A:middle
Text to Note action.

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:33.046 A:middle
And we'll select the note as the

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:33.966 A:middle
input parameter.

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.236 A:middle
So, now when I add the second

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.616 A:middle
action, the Add Text to Note

00:10:38.616 --> 00:10:40.326 A:middle
action, that note is already

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:41.986 A:middle
filled in to the note parameter

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.296 A:middle
from the first action.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.566 A:middle
So, adding inputs and outputs

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:47.416 A:middle
allows users to create multiple

00:10:47.416 --> 00:10:48.946 A:middle
step shortcuts using your

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:50.086 A:middle
actions that work great

00:10:50.156 --> 00:10:50.456 A:middle
together.

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:53.206 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:54.276 A:middle
things that we covered today.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.486 A:middle
First, we walked through the

00:10:56.486 --> 00:10:58.196 A:middle
components of a Shortcuts action

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.066 A:middle
and how users can configure one.

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.066 A:middle
and how users can configure one.

00:11:01.446 --> 00:11:02.776 A:middle
Next, we looked at the various

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:05.046 A:middle
ways that users can discover

00:11:05.046 --> 00:11:05.756 A:middle
your actions.

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.276 A:middle
And we started inside of your

00:11:07.276 --> 00:11:08.736 A:middle
app using the Add to Siri

00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:09.816 A:middle
experience.

00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:12.016 A:middle
And next, we walked through the

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:13.636 A:middle
Gallery and the Editor inside of

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:14.916 A:middle
the Shortcuts app and talked

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:16.196 A:middle
about how to make your actions

discoverable there, as well.

00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:20.076 A:middle
And finally, we explored how to

00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:21.336 A:middle
make your actions work great

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:23.056 A:middle
together taking input and

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:23.996 A:middle
produce output.

00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:26.336 A:middle
The Soup Chef app is available

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:27.056 A:middle
as sample code.

00:11:27.146 --> 00:11:28.646 A:middle
So, be sure to check that out if

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.596 A:middle
you want to see more about how

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:30.866 A:middle
all of this works.

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:33.226 A:middle
We also had a session earlier

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:34.756 A:middle
this week where we covered more

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:36.566 A:middle
about how these can be used to

00:11:36.616 --> 00:11:38.086 A:middle
power follow-up questions in

00:11:38.086 --> 00:11:38.506 A:middle
Siri.
