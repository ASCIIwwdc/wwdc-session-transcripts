[ Applause ]

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:13.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, everyone.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:14.886 A:middle
My name is Lauren.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm Doug.

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:16.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And we're on the Design

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.076 A:middle
Evangelism Team.

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.566 A:middle
On Monday night, we hosted the

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.506 A:middle
Apple Design Awards and we

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:23.856 A:middle
honored some of the best apps

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.656 A:middle
and games that we saw this year.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Each year we're really

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.946 A:middle
inspired by the work the

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.396 A:middle
developer community does on our

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.176 A:middle
platforms.

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:33.466 A:middle
And we're excited to show you

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.676 A:middle
the apps and games tonight.

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:38.686 A:middle
So we almost called this

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.856 A:middle
session, How to Win an Apple

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:42.606 A:middle
Design Award, because we get

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.676 A:middle
asked about it a lot.

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:45.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we totally

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:46.796 A:middle
understand why people would ask

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.836 A:middle
this question, right?

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Totally makes sense to wonder

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.936 A:middle
what goes into the selection of

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.556 A:middle
just a few apps and games.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So are there any criteria

00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.316 A:middle
behind the apps and games that

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.236 A:middle
we selected?

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.236 A:middle
we selected?

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:02.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sure. Are we going to talk

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:04.096 A:middle
about those criteria today?

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, we're actually going to

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:07.936 A:middle
talk about something that is

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:09.826 A:middle
much more compelling and useful

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:10.216 A:middle
to you.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we're going to talk about

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:15.436 A:middle
the values that are behind these

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.236 A:middle
apps and games.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Each app and game really

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:20.936 A:middle
delivers elements of all of

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:21.366 A:middle
these.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.316 A:middle
But we're going to take you on a

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.716 A:middle
journey behind the scenes of the

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.186 A:middle
award-winning apps and games.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And we're going to tell you

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:31.886 A:middle
short stories about the design

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:34.036 A:middle
processes and methods that went

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:34.896 A:middle
into each one.

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.486 A:middle
In each story we're going to

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.406 A:middle
tease out some lessons.

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So let's dive right in.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:44.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Innovation.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:44.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Innovation.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's sort of an obvious place

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.566 A:middle
to start maybe, but there were

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.286 A:middle
some really innovative apps and

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:52.366 A:middle
games this year.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.636 A:middle
So each of these apps that we're

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:55.926 A:middle
going to talk about brings out a

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:56.956 A:middle
different dimension of

00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:57.596 A:middle
innovation.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:01:59.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, so let's start

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:01.516 A:middle
with Asphalt 9.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.536 A:middle
Asphalt 9 is a racing game with

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.496 A:middle
an innovative new control scheme

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.705 A:middle
and to best explain it, I just

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:09.765 A:middle
think we should check it out.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.976 A:middle
Three, two, one.

00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:21.696 A:middle
In Asphalt 9, you focus on item

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:23.366 A:middle
and path selection with swipes,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.286 A:middle
just like this.

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:28.156 A:middle
And you tap and hold that gives

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:29.836 A:middle
you nitro and boost action.

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.096 A:middle
Now drifts and nitro are the

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.186 A:middle
main actions of acceleration and

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:35.006 A:middle
braking in this game.

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:37.146 A:middle
Now this is not a

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
driving-assisted.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.046 A:middle
It's an entirely new way to

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:40.366 A:middle
play.

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:43.296 A:middle
And this new control scheme is

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.666 A:middle
called TouchDrive.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.426 A:middle
But what makes TouchDrive so

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:48.976 A:middle
innovative?

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:51.856 A:middle
Because it subverts our

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:53.566 A:middle
expectations of racing game

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:54.066 A:middle
controls.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.436 A:middle
To do this, the developer

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.556 A:middle
questioned basic assumptions

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
that we all have taken for

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
that we all have taken for

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:00.926 A:middle
granted.

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:03.276 A:middle
They questioned the assumption

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.016 A:middle
that driving controls required

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.476 A:middle
acceleration, braking and

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:07.786 A:middle
turning.

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:10.126 A:middle
So they started completely from

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:10.626 A:middle
scratch.

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.896 A:middle
This led to an exciting idea.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:16.526 A:middle
After being challenged to figure

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.026 A:middle
out a simplified and more

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:19.546 A:middle
accessible control scheme for

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:21.706 A:middle
iOS, the developer tried this

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:23.856 A:middle
crazy idea that moves the main

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.886 A:middle
controls away from acceleration

00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:28.376 A:middle
and braking to nitro and drift

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:28.856 A:middle
actions.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.326 A:middle
They quickly realized there was

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:32.716 A:middle
something special there because

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.376 A:middle
it helped players get into the

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.446 A:middle
fun so much faster.

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:38.566 A:middle
But they were not done shaking

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:39.116 A:middle
things up yet.

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:42.206 A:middle
Asphalt 9 knew that traditional

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:44.486 A:middle
turning as a player control was

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:47.236 A:middle
very prone to player error.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.086 A:middle
So after rounds of testing and

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.076 A:middle
feedback, they replaced

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:53.966 A:middle
traditional path -- excuse me,

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.146 A:middle
they replaced turning with path

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:58.226 A:middle
and item selection through swipe

00:03:58.226 --> 00:03:58.716 A:middle
gestures.

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:01.246 A:middle
And this made people less

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:01.246 A:middle
And this made people less

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.306 A:middle
frustrated, because it helped

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:04.556 A:middle
people focus on learning the

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.536 A:middle
very elaborate tracks and play

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:07.476 A:middle
more strategically.

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:10.756 A:middle
So TouchDrive has now become the

00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:12.386 A:middle
default control scheme for

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.646 A:middle
strategic racing, fine-tuning

00:04:14.816 --> 00:04:15.826 A:middle
and level recon.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:18.106 A:middle
Now full manual controls are a

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.596 A:middle
matter of surgical precision and

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:20.776 A:middle
are still available.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.506 A:middle
But what I love is that this

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:25.526 A:middle
developer took an informed risk.

00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
After iterating, testing and

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.496 A:middle
getting feedback, the design

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.336 A:middle
decision to diverge from

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:34.716 A:middle
traditional driving controls has

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.506 A:middle
allowed for an entirely new

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:37.966 A:middle
experience to emerge.

00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:40.596 A:middle
And the innovation of TouchDrive

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.856 A:middle
has revealed an entirely new way

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:43.846 A:middle
to play the game.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.786 A:middle
So during your app design or

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:51.886 A:middle
game design process, question

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:53.226 A:middle
assumptions from the start.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.166 A:middle
Ask questions.

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
Ask, "Why are we doing it this

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:57.676 A:middle
way?"

00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
Is it because we've just always

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.456 A:middle
done it this way?

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.456 A:middle
done it this way?

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:03.456 A:middle
And convert problems into ideas,

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
just like the problem of

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.886 A:middle
error-prone turning led to new

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:09.606 A:middle
path selection in Asphalt 9.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.206 A:middle
Because when you do, you can

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:14.566 A:middle
create something that has never

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:15.756 A:middle
been done before.

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:18.576 A:middle
This game is so much fun.

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
And that is truly innovative.

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:27.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let's stay on the theme

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.816 A:middle
of crazy car stunts.

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:30.546 A:middle
No, actually, let's stay on the

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.866 A:middle
theme of simplification, making

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:33.636 A:middle
things easier.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What could be simpler than

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:36.176 A:middle
jumping over the Golden Gate

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:37.166 A:middle
Bridge with a single swipe?

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:39.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh my God, wait till I show

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:40.026 A:middle
you this.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:42.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I want to talk about

00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:43.246 A:middle
HomeCourt.

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.156 A:middle
HomeCourt is an app that uses

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.946 A:middle
your iPhone camera and ML models

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.276 A:middle
to help you become a better

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.256 A:middle
basketball player.

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:53.306 A:middle
The app works so naturally and

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:55.186 A:middle
so effortlessly because the

00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:56.986 A:middle
HomeCourt team focused on

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.646 A:middle
removing obstacles to getting

00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.556 A:middle
started with each of your drills

00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.556 A:middle
started with each of your drills

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:01.296 A:middle
and workouts.

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:02.366 A:middle
And I want to show you how they

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:02.696 A:middle
did it.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.126 A:middle
So here's the HomeCourt app.

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:07.656 A:middle
Like I said, it uses the camera

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:10.426 A:middle
and machine learning to chart my

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:11.896 A:middle
shots on a basketball court.

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:14.086 A:middle
Before this app came along,

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:15.766 A:middle
people just didn't have access

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:16.906 A:middle
to this information.

00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:18.856 A:middle
You really needed someone to

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:22.006 A:middle
manually chart it, each make and

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:22.486 A:middle
miss.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:25.646 A:middle
You could also install an entire

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:28.116 A:middle
system in your gym to do it, but

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:29.536 A:middle
you couldn't really do it as

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:31.786 A:middle
easily as HomeCourt makes it.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.256 A:middle
So how do you get this

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.446 A:middle
information just by using your

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:36.906 A:middle
iPhone?

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.216 A:middle
When I tried it, it feels like

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:40.676 A:middle
magic.

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:42.426 A:middle
And I wanted to know how they

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.016 A:middle
got there.

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:45.256 A:middle
So I asked them to tell me where

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:47.386 A:middle
they started and where this all

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:48.086 A:middle
came from.

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:50.336 A:middle
And the founder actually started

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:51.986 A:middle
out by saying, "When we first

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:53.606 A:middle
launched, the experience was

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:55.546 A:middle
actually not magical."

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:59.486 A:middle
So to get information from

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
HomeCourt you had to go through

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
HomeCourt you had to go through

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:02.406 A:middle
a series of steps.

00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:04.776 A:middle
The first one was to put your

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:06.066 A:middle
phone in a tripod.

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:08.176 A:middle
I don't know how many basketball

00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:10.056 A:middle
players are here, but if you

00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
play basketball, I'm guessing

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.236 A:middle
you don't go to play basketball

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:17.476 A:middle
with a tripod in your gym bag.

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:19.626 A:middle
So you know, it's clear that

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:21.036 A:middle
bringing the tripod is an

00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:22.076 A:middle
obstacle, right?

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:22.746 A:middle
It's something you had to

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.876 A:middle
remember to bring and set up.

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:26.436 A:middle
And that wasn't the only

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:27.096 A:middle
obstacle.

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:28.816 A:middle
You needed equipment and you

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.156 A:middle
needed to do manual work to set

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:32.986 A:middle
up the app.

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.156 A:middle
Two of the requirements early on

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:36.566 A:middle
related to lighting.

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.856 A:middle
The app worked best when the sun

00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:43.626 A:middle
was directly overhead on a super

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:44.266 A:middle
sunny day.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.266 A:middle
You know, but other than that.

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:49.426 A:middle
So the HomeCourt team went to

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:51.046 A:middle
work and they tried to automate

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:52.946 A:middle
as much as possible using the

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:54.876 A:middle
camera and machine learning

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:55.356 A:middle
models.

00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:57.686 A:middle
The first thing they did was

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.876 A:middle
find a way to detect the hoop.

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:02.726 A:middle
And then they were able to

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:04.176 A:middle
detect the three-point line.

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:05.886 A:middle
So this line is in different

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.086 A:middle
places in different kinds of

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:09.446 A:middle
courts, so this allowed them to

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:11.546 A:middle
better detect courts in

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:12.506 A:middle
different countries.

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:14.806 A:middle
So more and more people were

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.266 A:middle
able to use it at this point.

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.196 A:middle
And this also allowed them to

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:19.816 A:middle
begin to locate the shot a

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.106 A:middle
little more precisely.

00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
So they've removed some of the

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:24.586 A:middle
manual work.

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:26.356 A:middle
You didn't have to tap on the

00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:27.866 A:middle
screen to identify the hoop

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:29.056 A:middle
anymore and you didn't have to

00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:31.846 A:middle
draw a rectangle around the

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:32.285 A:middle
lane.

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:35.895 A:middle
Next, they found a way to detect

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:36.576 A:middle
legs.

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:38.556 A:middle
This allowed people to use the

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:40.376 A:middle
app in almost any lighting

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:41.066 A:middle
conditions.

00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
So you could use HomeCourt on a

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:45.646 A:middle
cloudy day.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.676 A:middle
Soon after that, they kind of

00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:49.546 A:middle
upgraded to full pose

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:50.426 A:middle
estimation.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.946 A:middle
So this is detecting all the key

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:53.766 A:middle
body joints, and this helped

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:56.096 A:middle
them even more accurately map

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:57.676 A:middle
where the shot originated.

00:08:58.756 --> 00:08:59.976 A:middle
So they're making progress,

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:00.266 A:middle
right?

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:00.266 A:middle
right?

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:01.446 A:middle
They're simplifying it, but you

00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:02.906 A:middle
still had to bring the tripod.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:06.486 A:middle
Until they created a mode that

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:08.606 A:middle
allowed you to set the phone on

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:08.956 A:middle
the ground.

00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:12.926 A:middle
So this removed the final

00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:13.996 A:middle
obstacles, and I want to show

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:16.326 A:middle
you how that last part happens.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:18.606 A:middle
So now you can start tracking

00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:21.036 A:middle
your shots just by propping your

00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:23.306 A:middle
phone up against a water bottle,

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:25.706 A:middle
walking to the free throw line.

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:30.296 A:middle
And shooting a free throw.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:30.903 A:middle
Aw.

00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:32.743 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Aw.

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:34.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Never could get one.

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:36.376 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:37.206 A:middle
So it might not have been

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:38.846 A:middle
magical at first, but when you

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:40.986 A:middle
do it now, it feels like magic.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:43.236 A:middle
And there's tons of machine

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:45.906 A:middle
learning at work, but you don't

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:46.546 A:middle
see it.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.266 A:middle
You're not -- it's not right in

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:48.996 A:middle
your face.

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:50.726 A:middle
It doesn't feel that way.

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:52.596 A:middle
And with HomeCourt you get

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:54.046 A:middle
access to information you've

00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:55.006 A:middle
never had before.

00:09:56.086 --> 00:09:57.326 A:middle
And the app feels like an

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:59.116 A:middle
extension of what you already

00:09:59.116 --> 00:09:59.486 A:middle
do.

00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:01.246 A:middle
But it's been taken to another

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
level.

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:04.466 A:middle
So it fits in the flow of your

00:10:04.466 --> 00:10:05.866 A:middle
shooting practice, but gives you

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:06.266 A:middle
more.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.586 A:middle
So the innovation here is

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:10.806 A:middle
probably obvious.

00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:12.336 A:middle
It's a matter of simplifying

00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:15.066 A:middle
down to what people want to do,

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:16.596 A:middle
fitting into the natural flow of

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.496 A:middle
their real life.

00:10:18.496 --> 00:10:19.816 A:middle
And providing value without

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:20.726 A:middle
getting in the way.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's so awesome, Doug.

00:10:23.316 --> 00:10:25.076 A:middle
I actually want to go play some

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:25.886 A:middle
basketball later.

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:29.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's go do some shooting.

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:33.256 A:middle
So these apps and games really

00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:34.336 A:middle
pushed the boundaries.

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:35.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And the best kind of

00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:36.956 A:middle
innovation is the kind that you

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:37.976 A:middle
don't even notice, right?

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:40.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Exactly, when they just make

00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:41.896 A:middle
the experience simple and

00:10:41.896 --> 00:10:42.226 A:middle
better.

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:44.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And truly, anything that

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.826 A:middle
helps a person feel more

00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:49.446 A:middle
confident in using it is great.

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:51.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Speaking of confidence, let's

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.096 A:middle
go on to the next one, Trust.

00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:55.176 A:middle
And I want to talk about how an

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.896 A:middle
app or a game can establish

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.296 A:middle
trust with the people who use

00:10:58.296 --> 00:10:58.476 A:middle
it.

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.216 A:middle
And I'm going to use Pixelmator

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.216 A:middle
And I'm going to use Pixelmator

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.936 A:middle
Photo as an example of this.

00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:03.536 A:middle
So this is a photo editor

00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:05.386 A:middle
designed specifically for iPad

00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:07.196 A:middle
and it also uses machine

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:09.976 A:middle
learning, but it's doing it

00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:12.086 A:middle
trained on millions, literally

00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:14.166 A:middle
millions of professional photos

00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.336 A:middle
to make photo editing awesome

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.036 A:middle
and easy.

00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:18.076 A:middle
And I want to show you how they

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:18.446 A:middle
do it.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:21.966 A:middle
So I want to start by saying

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.386 A:middle
machine learning is popping up

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:27.066 A:middle
everywhere, but user experiences

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:28.556 A:middle
that are informed by machine

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:30.626 A:middle
learning can sometimes feel a

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.306 A:middle
bit like black boxes.

00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:34.976 A:middle
You might often wonder, you

00:11:35.436 --> 00:11:36.716 A:middle
might sometimes wonder, maybe

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:38.286 A:middle
often, "Why am I seeing this

00:11:38.326 --> 00:11:38.916 A:middle
content?

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:40.986 A:middle
What forces are at work?

00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:43.316 A:middle
Why is the app showing me this?"

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:46.706 A:middle
And there are also controls that

00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:49.706 A:middle
claim to do magic things, but

00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:51.776 A:middle
these can feel unpredictable and

00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:52.346 A:middle
random.

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:54.516 A:middle
And so when things are hard to

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:56.626 A:middle
understand or hard to predict,

00:11:57.136 --> 00:11:58.956 A:middle
it can be hard to trust them.

00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:01.846 A:middle
So I want to show you Pixelmator

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.976 A:middle
Photo and how they handle it.

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:07.716 A:middle
I'm going to take a walk on the

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:08.346 A:middle
beach here.

00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:12.916 A:middle
So on the surface, the UI is

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:13.886 A:middle
pretty conventional.

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.306 A:middle
There are tools in the

00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:17.646 A:middle
navigation bar and there are

00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:19.326 A:middle
base photo adjustments in the

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:21.366 A:middle
inspector and presets along the

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:21.826 A:middle
bottom.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.836 A:middle
The core of any kind of power

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:27.126 A:middle
tool is the inspector, and in

00:12:27.126 --> 00:12:28.766 A:middle
Pixelmator Photo this is where

00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:30.066 A:middle
the base adjustments live.

00:12:30.796 --> 00:12:32.796 A:middle
So these will be familiar to

00:12:32.796 --> 00:12:35.156 A:middle
photo geeks and experts, but

00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:37.186 A:middle
most people don't really know

00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:38.746 A:middle
what any of those do, and they

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:39.816 A:middle
can frankly be a little

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:40.616 A:middle
intimidating.

00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:43.906 A:middle
But the magic of Pixelmator

00:12:43.906 --> 00:12:46.306 A:middle
Photo is a single button, and it

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:47.656 A:middle
allows you to apply the

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:49.246 A:middle
expertise of thousands of

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.706 A:middle
professional photographers to

00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:52.226 A:middle
your photo with one button.

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:53.976 A:middle
There, I did it.

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:56.526 A:middle
You'll see it again.

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.496 A:middle
So when you tap that button,

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.116 A:middle
Pixelmator Photo is actually

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.116 A:middle
Pixelmator Photo is actually

00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:01.316 A:middle
adjusting your photo with a

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:03.846 A:middle
model that's been trained on 20

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:05.816 A:middle
million professional photos.

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:10.106 A:middle
So the work behind the button is

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:11.906 A:middle
astounding and the results are

00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:12.816 A:middle
pretty incredible.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
In the UI, they're using a

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:17.226 A:middle
familiar control you might have

00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:19.416 A:middle
seen before, the Magic Wand.

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:22.306 A:middle
And Magic Wands in UIs typically

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.316 A:middle
mean don't worry about it, we

00:13:25.316 --> 00:13:26.226 A:middle
know what we're doing.

00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:27.866 A:middle
It's going to be awesome.

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.126 A:middle
But from a user point of view,

00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.486 A:middle
you're not exactly sure what's

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:32.866 A:middle
happening when you tap that

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:33.306 A:middle
button.

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.276 A:middle
So when I ask the developers

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:37.756 A:middle
about this, about their choice

00:13:37.756 --> 00:13:40.236 A:middle
of icon here, they kind of

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.906 A:middle
agreed that Magic Wands were

00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:44.116 A:middle
often underwhelming, right?

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:46.586 A:middle
The results felt simplistic or

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:47.396 A:middle
cookie-cutter.

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:50.686 A:middle
So in order for this control to

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:52.756 A:middle
work and to be trusted by

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:55.216 A:middle
people, they wanted to make sure

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:56.266 A:middle
that the adjustments in the

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:58.396 A:middle
photo were clearly reflected in

00:13:58.396 --> 00:13:58.906 A:middle
the UI.

00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:03.046 A:middle
So what's happening kind of

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:04.466 A:middle
behind the scenes is that their

00:14:04.466 --> 00:14:06.486 A:middle
models are identifying segments

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:08.136 A:middle
of content inside the frame.

00:14:08.356 --> 00:14:10.886 A:middle
Water, sand and sky are detected

00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:12.836 A:middle
and treated independently, and

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.446 A:middle
skin tone is as well.

00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:17.466 A:middle
But what makes this experience

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:19.946 A:middle
so much different in my opinion

00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.236 A:middle
is how clearly the parameters

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.246 A:middle
animate when the control is

00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.856 A:middle
activated, and the ease with

00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:27.756 A:middle
which I can go in and

00:14:27.756 --> 00:14:29.136 A:middle
independently adjust any of

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:29.446 A:middle
them.

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.096 A:middle
So check out how it's increased

00:14:32.096 --> 00:14:33.896 A:middle
the exposure of the landscape

00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:35.916 A:middle
while leaving the skin tone

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:36.446 A:middle
alone.

00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:39.646 A:middle
And I can flip the switch to

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:42.696 A:middle
deactivate them and then when I

00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:44.326 A:middle
reactivate it, my adjustments

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:45.076 A:middle
are still there.

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:48.476 A:middle
So it seems simple but it's

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:50.396 A:middle
pretty remarkable when you use

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.376 A:middle
it and you feel the sense of

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:55.696 A:middle
confidence as you begin to

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:58.996 A:middle
adjust and edit the photo.

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
So being able to see this as I

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
So being able to see this as I

00:15:01.486 --> 00:15:03.246 A:middle
do it provides a sense of

00:15:03.246 --> 00:15:03.736 A:middle
comfort.

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.836 A:middle
I can see what's happening when

00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:08.136 A:middle
I tap the Magic Wand and I can

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.216 A:middle
go in and make my own

00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:10.036 A:middle
adjustments.

00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:12.606 A:middle
So there's a fancy word kind of

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:15.206 A:middle
for this in user experience

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.876 A:middle
terms and it's attribution.

00:15:17.026 --> 00:15:18.856 A:middle
I can see cause and effect.

00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:20.896 A:middle
I can visually connect the

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:23.166 A:middle
effect of tapping the Magic Wand

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:25.066 A:middle
to the series of independent

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:27.656 A:middle
adjustments that's happening as

00:15:27.656 --> 00:15:28.426 A:middle
a result of it.

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:31.566 A:middle
And this is empowering, right?

00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:33.666 A:middle
Pixelmator Photo is revealing

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.936 A:middle
its intelligence to me and also

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.616 A:middle
offering levers to adjust it

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:37.966 A:middle
myself.

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:42.086 A:middle
So you can trust an app when the

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:43.706 A:middle
way that it works feels

00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:45.126 A:middle
transparent and when you can

00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:47.606 A:middle
establish a simple understanding

00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:48.666 A:middle
of what's happening.

00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.906 A:middle
So if I can understand or even

00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.626 A:middle
better visualize what's

00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:56.576 A:middle
happening, I'm much more likely

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.746 A:middle
to trust it and to take

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.506 A:middle
ownership over those results.

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.506 A:middle
ownership over those results.

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:02.146 A:middle
So you want to reveal what's

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.096 A:middle
behind a recommendation and

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.976 A:middle
offer ways to adjust it.

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:12.146 A:middle
So that pretty much wraps up

00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:12.556 A:middle
trust.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good.

00:16:15.276 --> 00:16:16.576 A:middle
On to refinement.

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:19.716 A:middle
Now refinement is more than just

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:20.726 A:middle
working out problems.

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:23.406 A:middle
Refining something means that

00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:24.596 A:middle
you're going to fine-tune it,

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:26.986 A:middle
hone it and make it more

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:27.486 A:middle
precise.

00:16:28.626 --> 00:16:30.336 A:middle
Refining something means you're

00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:31.236 A:middle
going to make it better.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:34.596 A:middle
The Gardens Between is a game

00:16:34.726 --> 00:16:36.886 A:middle
with dream-like levels, soothing

00:16:36.886 --> 00:16:38.686 A:middle
art style and a heartwarming

00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:39.146 A:middle
story.

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:41.636 A:middle
You have the power to go

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:44.036 A:middle
forwards and backwards in time,

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:46.056 A:middle
and you relive these experiences

00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:47.426 A:middle
of these two main characters

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:48.546 A:middle
while solving puzzles.

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.346 A:middle
I am blown away by the artistry

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.536 A:middle
and cleverness in this game.

00:16:54.496 --> 00:16:56.456 A:middle
And I've always just been really

00:16:56.456 --> 00:16:57.956 A:middle
curious in how the developers

00:16:57.956 --> 00:16:59.686 A:middle
arrived at this truly unique

00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
concept.

00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
concept.

00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:05.246 A:middle
So I asked the developers and I

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:06.455 A:middle
hoped that they would be willing

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:08.415 A:middle
to share a few design artifacts

00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:10.266 A:middle
that they created along the way

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:11.096 A:middle
while making The Gardens

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:11.616 A:middle
Between.

00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:13.526 A:middle
And I expected to see a few

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:14.976 A:middle
familiar things that reminded me

00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:15.445 A:middle
of the game.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:17.976 A:middle
But I didn't.

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:20.646 A:middle
I was shocked to see that the

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:22.445 A:middle
design artifacts didn't look

00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:23.675 A:middle
like the game at all.

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:25.836 A:middle
These images reveal that The

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.336 A:middle
Gardens Between started in a

00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:29.886 A:middle
very different place, in a place

00:17:29.886 --> 00:17:32.596 A:middle
of fairy tales with moments

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:34.716 A:middle
showing Snow White about to eat

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:35.566 A:middle
the poisoned apple.

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.056 A:middle
Or Sleeping Beauty right as

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.426 A:middle
she's about to fall into a curse

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.686 A:middle
of deep sleep.

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.316 A:middle
Other design artifacts showed

00:17:43.356 --> 00:17:46.306 A:middle
lost characters and some very

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:47.706 A:middle
different appearances of the two

00:17:47.706 --> 00:17:49.466 A:middle
main characters named Arina and

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:49.836 A:middle
Frendt.

00:17:50.796 --> 00:17:52.646 A:middle
And various iterations on

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:55.376 A:middle
concepts for blocked paths and

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:56.556 A:middle
experiments with onscreen

00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:57.026 A:middle
controls.

00:17:57.756 --> 00:18:00.016 A:middle
As I flipped through all of

00:17:57.756 --> 00:18:00.016 A:middle
As I flipped through all of

00:18:00.016 --> 00:18:01.896 A:middle
these design artifacts, it

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:04.056 A:middle
became really clear to me the

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:06.076 A:middle
creative exploration that these

00:18:06.076 --> 00:18:07.946 A:middle
developers put into making the

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:09.456 A:middle
game that we love today.

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:11.816 A:middle
There are tons of different

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:14.596 A:middle
styles and tones and directions

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:15.896 A:middle
and perspectives that were all

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:16.446 A:middle
considered.

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:18.856 A:middle
Now I know this is a game

00:18:18.856 --> 00:18:21.106 A:middle
example but exploring ideas in

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:22.746 A:middle
your designs applies to apps

00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:22.956 A:middle
too.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.156 A:middle
All of these amazing design

00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:27.406 A:middle
artifacts really show the power

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.136 A:middle
of refinement, what can happen

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.286 A:middle
when you take the time to truly

00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:33.326 A:middle
explore your ideas.

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:36.136 A:middle
To stretch them, to think them

00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:38.126 A:middle
through over time and to distill

00:18:38.126 --> 00:18:40.036 A:middle
them down to their very essence.

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:43.586 A:middle
Now I love this quote by Carlton

00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:43.946 A:middle
Cuse.

00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:45.406 A:middle
I'm going to paraphrase it a

00:18:45.406 --> 00:18:47.976 A:middle
bit, but it's basically saying

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:49.946 A:middle
that the creative process is not

00:18:49.946 --> 00:18:50.736 A:middle
like getting struck by

00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:51.196 A:middle
lightning.

00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:53.666 A:middle
Along the way you must allow

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.896 A:middle
yourself room for ideas to

00:18:55.896 --> 00:19:00.376 A:middle
blossom, take root and grow.

00:18:55.896 --> 00:19:00.376 A:middle
blossom, take root and grow.

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:02.986 A:middle
So when you take the time to

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
fully think through your ideas,

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:07.246 A:middle
you may discover new ones and

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.906 A:middle
then you can validate designs by

00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:11.146 A:middle
refining them and in turn this

00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:12.756 A:middle
gives people a sense of depth.

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:14.856 A:middle
And that really shines through

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.406 A:middle
the final experience in your app

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:16.976 A:middle
or game.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:21.046 A:middle
Refined designs feel considered

00:19:21.046 --> 00:19:22.986 A:middle
and they also feel thoughtful.

00:19:23.886 --> 00:19:25.586 A:middle
But this all takes time.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:26.896 A:middle
You can't rush this.

00:19:28.246 --> 00:19:31.676 A:middle
And iteration is really helpful

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:33.616 A:middle
and also it's helpful for you to

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:35.736 A:middle
explore really wild directions

00:19:36.596 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
in order to discover your

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:39.286 A:middle
conclusion.

00:19:40.636 --> 00:19:42.526 A:middle
Now I really love that these

00:19:42.526 --> 00:19:44.036 A:middle
developers were so open to

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:45.196 A:middle
sharing this incredible

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.916 A:middle
transformation of this beautiful

00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:48.486 A:middle
game between two friends.

00:19:49.206 --> 00:19:51.056 A:middle
And you can feel all of the time

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.536 A:middle
and effort that they put into

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:53.816 A:middle
honing this experience.

00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:56.206 A:middle
And this experience is what we

00:19:56.206 --> 00:19:57.966 A:middle
feel in the end result.

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:00.876 A:middle
Award-winning apps and games

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:00.876 A:middle
Award-winning apps and games

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:02.826 A:middle
rarely start with the same

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:03.966 A:middle
designs they finish with.

00:20:04.796 --> 00:20:06.736 A:middle
And that's because great designs

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:08.056 A:middle
are refined over time.

00:20:08.886 --> 00:20:10.416 A:middle
And through this process the

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:13.956 A:middle
very best ideas are surfaced.

00:20:14.086 --> 00:20:17.706 A:middle
So take your time; explore and

00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:20.186 A:middle
sit with your ideas because you

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.526 A:middle
may discover new ones through

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.726 A:middle
the process of doing your own

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:23.026 A:middle
work.

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:25.536 A:middle
And by refining your designs,

00:20:25.686 --> 00:20:26.506 A:middle
you're going to be able to

00:20:26.506 --> 00:20:28.646 A:middle
justify every design decision in

00:20:28.646 --> 00:20:30.766 A:middle
your app or game, and as soon as

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:32.576 A:middle
you can justify those decisions,

00:20:33.046 --> 00:20:34.616 A:middle
you know that you're much closer

00:20:34.616 --> 00:20:36.286 A:middle
to the final result that you've

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:37.646 A:middle
been working towards the entire

00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:37.956 A:middle
time.

00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:41.906 A:middle
So all great apps and games go

00:20:41.906 --> 00:20:43.226 A:middle
through the process of

00:20:43.226 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
refinement.

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You know, Lauren, we actually

00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:47.856 A:middle
have another great example of

00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:48.506 A:middle
refinement.

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:51.726 A:middle
I want to talk about Butterfly

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:52.216 A:middle
iQ.

00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:54.596 A:middle
Butterfly iQ is actually more

00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:55.126 A:middle
than an app.

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:57.656 A:middle
It's portable ultrasound system,

00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:59.976 A:middle
and the system itself is super

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
innovative.

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
innovative.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:03.436 A:middle
A handheld ultrasound device and

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.436 A:middle
an app that runs on iPhone,

00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:06.896 A:middle
that's what makes it up.

00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:08.836 A:middle
So traditional ultrasound

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.486 A:middle
devices are gigantic.

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:12.686 A:middle
Really big.

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:13.716 A:middle
They're big.

00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:15.366 A:middle
They have to be wheeled around

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:16.966 A:middle
on a cart and plugged in.

00:21:17.116 --> 00:21:19.706 A:middle
They have dozens of knobs and

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:22.106 A:middle
dials and buttons on them.

00:21:22.986 --> 00:21:24.746 A:middle
So you can really see in

00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:27.306 A:middle
Butterfly iQ how the portability

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:29.946 A:middle
of their system can create a

00:21:30.036 --> 00:21:32.236 A:middle
whole new way for doctors to use

00:21:32.236 --> 00:21:32.566 A:middle
them.

00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.606 A:middle
And I want to show you how the

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:36.616 A:middle
Butterfly iQ team refined their

00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.506 A:middle
ideas to get to something that

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.096 A:middle
really works for doctors.

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:42.906 A:middle
So when a doctor is using the

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:44.276 A:middle
system, their attention is

00:21:44.276 --> 00:21:45.206 A:middle
actually split.

00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:48.386 A:middle
In one hand they have the device

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:49.996 A:middle
that they're orienting on the

00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:51.926 A:middle
patient, and at the same time

00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:53.436 A:middle
they're referring to the phone

00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:53.946 A:middle
screen.

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:55.406 A:middle
So they need to be able to

00:21:55.406 --> 00:21:57.296 A:middle
operate both one-handed.

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.896 A:middle
The app serves as kind of a

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.896 A:middle
The app serves as kind of a

00:22:00.896 --> 00:22:02.276 A:middle
visual stethoscope.

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:04.586 A:middle
And the doctor needs to be able

00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:06.786 A:middle
to quickly refer to and adjust

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:08.676 A:middle
the imagery and then to also

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:11.616 A:middle
access contextual tools to make

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:12.976 A:middle
measurements and notes.

00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:16.446 A:middle
In their early demos, they

00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:18.676 A:middle
created controls that mirrored

00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:20.276 A:middle
the controls from the ultrasound

00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:22.196 A:middle
cart with the idea that this

00:22:22.196 --> 00:22:24.206 A:middle
would feel familiar to doctors.

00:22:25.206 --> 00:22:28.836 A:middle
So the two values on the right

00:22:29.666 --> 00:22:30.656 A:middle
tell you how deep you're

00:22:30.656 --> 00:22:31.206 A:middle
looking.

00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:32.756 A:middle
That's the depth.

00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:34.526 A:middle
And the amount of contrast

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.256 A:middle
you're applying, that's the

00:22:36.256 --> 00:22:36.786 A:middle
gain.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.086 A:middle
And they borrowed the behavior

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:40.676 A:middle
of these buttons from the knobs

00:22:40.896 --> 00:22:42.336 A:middle
on the cart when doctors would

00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:43.196 A:middle
interact with them.

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:45.556 A:middle
So in the early version, the

00:22:45.556 --> 00:22:48.246 A:middle
doctor would spin these controls

00:22:48.246 --> 00:22:50.656 A:middle
like the dial in a cart and the

00:22:50.656 --> 00:22:53.866 A:middle
dials in the phone in doing this

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:55.556 A:middle
kind of matched the behavior

00:22:55.556 --> 00:22:56.996 A:middle
that the Butterfly iQ team

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.726 A:middle
thought would be very familiar

00:22:58.726 --> 00:22:59.666 A:middle
and very comfortable.

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.626 A:middle
So in UI terms, they're kind of

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.106 A:middle
implementing a metaphorical

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:05.606 A:middle
dial.

00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:07.316 A:middle
And metaphors like this can be

00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:09.566 A:middle
super useful when you want to

00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:11.776 A:middle
help the person using the device

00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:14.066 A:middle
create a connection with a

00:23:14.066 --> 00:23:15.106 A:middle
real-world object.

00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:17.036 A:middle
And metaphors are all over the

00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:19.106 A:middle
place in UI's, right?

00:23:19.176 --> 00:23:21.096 A:middle
This is a metaphorical

00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.786 A:middle
calculator with metaphorical

00:23:23.016 --> 00:23:23.776 A:middle
buttons.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:28.016 A:middle
And our expectations of using

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:29.766 A:middle
that calculator come from the

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:32.576 A:middle
behavior that we've built up in

00:23:32.576 --> 00:23:34.596 A:middle
the real world using real-world

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:35.806 A:middle
buttons like these.

00:23:36.466 --> 00:23:39.536 A:middle
But as the Butterfly iQ team

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:42.486 A:middle
tested that demo, that 2016

00:23:42.486 --> 00:23:44.436 A:middle
demo, they found that a direct

00:23:44.436 --> 00:23:46.426 A:middle
translation of the dial didn't

00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:48.186 A:middle
feel right at all to doctors

00:23:48.546 --> 00:23:50.426 A:middle
because those values were taking

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.726 A:middle
up valuable real estate.

00:23:53.436 --> 00:23:55.696 A:middle
So they refined it on this

00:23:55.696 --> 00:23:56.096 A:middle
theme.

00:23:56.256 --> 00:23:58.656 A:middle
They started by looking at other

00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.656 A:middle
apps and solved the problem --

00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.656 A:middle
apps and solved the problem --

00:24:00.896 --> 00:24:02.296 A:middle
how other apps had solved the

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:04.446 A:middle
problem of viewing and editing

00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:04.996 A:middle
imagery.

00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.116 A:middle
And they drew inspiration from

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:08.776 A:middle
the iOS Camera app.

00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:11.926 A:middle
So they considered the ways that

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:13.676 A:middle
people expect to interact with

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.076 A:middle
objects in the camera view and

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:17.396 A:middle
the ways that controls can be

00:24:17.396 --> 00:24:19.026 A:middle
accessed via gestures.

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.646 A:middle
The way that those controls

00:24:20.646 --> 00:24:22.466 A:middle
animate in and then the way that

00:24:22.466 --> 00:24:24.056 A:middle
they recede when they're not in

00:24:24.056 --> 00:24:24.476 A:middle
use.

00:24:25.696 --> 00:24:28.126 A:middle
So now in the Butterfly iQ app,

00:24:28.566 --> 00:24:30.286 A:middle
panning left and right changes

00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:33.646 A:middle
the contrast and swiping up and

00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:35.336 A:middle
down changes the depth.

00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:37.976 A:middle
So they moved the information

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:40.226 A:middle
out of the UI and allowed it to

00:24:40.226 --> 00:24:41.806 A:middle
be accessed via gestures.

00:24:42.706 --> 00:24:43.886 A:middle
And you can notice the ruler

00:24:43.886 --> 00:24:45.286 A:middle
down the right-hand side.

00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:47.396 A:middle
So as the doctor swipes down,

00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:49.056 A:middle
that ruler extends and allows

00:24:49.056 --> 00:24:50.396 A:middle
them to have a little bit more

00:24:50.396 --> 00:24:52.756 A:middle
out-of-the-way persistent look

00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:54.686 A:middle
at the depth.

00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:56.316 A:middle
So transferring the persistent

00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.596 A:middle
dials from the ultrasound cart

00:24:58.596 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
to the app seemed like it would

00:24:58.596 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
to the app seemed like it would

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:02.866 A:middle
establish trust and comfort.

00:25:03.326 --> 00:25:04.666 A:middle
But instead it turned out that

00:25:04.776 --> 00:25:06.616 A:middle
that information and those dials

00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:08.196 A:middle
were occupying valuable real

00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:09.686 A:middle
estate and doctors didn't need

00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:11.196 A:middle
that persistence in order to

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:12.636 A:middle
feel confident.

00:25:14.136 --> 00:25:17.126 A:middle
So creating those metaphorical

00:25:17.126 --> 00:25:18.486 A:middle
connections can be helpful, but

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:21.036 A:middle
there's no copy and paste when

00:25:21.036 --> 00:25:22.136 A:middle
nailing a behavior.

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:23.306 A:middle
You have to be willing to throw

00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:26.466 A:middle
out ideas that might have seemed

00:25:26.636 --> 00:25:28.146 A:middle
like a slam dunk -- that's a

00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:29.526 A:middle
HomeCourt reference, by the way.

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:31.796 A:middle
And you need to keep refining.

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:35.826 A:middle
So the process of refinement

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:36.746 A:middle
never ends.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.926 A:middle
You want to draw inspiration

00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:40.246 A:middle
from the real world, but make

00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:41.796 A:middle
sure it doesn't conflict with

00:25:41.796 --> 00:25:43.506 A:middle
the expectations that people

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.826 A:middle
have in a digital UI.

00:25:45.486 --> 00:25:47.356 A:middle
And don't be afraid to throw

00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:47.946 A:middle

00:25:58.166 --> 00:25:59.786 A:middle
difficult it can be to, you

Moving the information off the

Beauty in aesthetics reflects an

attitude, a perspective and

practicality, immersion and

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.536 A:middle

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
something to learn from each

I want you to pay special

attention to the overall

00:27:12.746 --> 00:27:14.566 A:middle
simplicity of the game UI.

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:16.986 A:middle

arcade games.

and keep your attention, to draw

00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:38.026 A:middle
you right in and draw you in and

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:39.316 A:middle
not pay attention to the other

subtle arrow swipes up in the

ELOH uses unique visual style in

ways.

it combines some familiar game

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.836 A:middle
complete, so I want to show you

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:10.566 A:middle
where they started and how they

00:31:10.566 --> 00:31:11.156 A:middle
got here.

00:31:12.776 --> 00:31:14.576 A:middle

ELOH.

00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.466 A:middle

elements are there.

00:31:18.936 --> 00:31:21.416 A:middle
The essential mechanic is there,

00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:23.076 A:middle
the sounds, and it's even got

00:31:23.516 --> 00:31:25.336 A:middle
kind of a notion of the style

00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:28.606 A:middle
with the anthropomorphic face on

the obstacle.

higher level in that alpha.

kind of the mechanic nailed in

00:31:44.016 --> 00:31:45.596 A:middle
these early versions.

00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:46.846 A:middle
So I want to walk you through

00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:48.086 A:middle
the journey that they took from

00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:51.746 A:middle
here to arrive at the game

00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:53.166 A:middle
that's on the App Store.

00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:55.136 A:middle
So the first step that the game

00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:56.846 A:middle
designer took was to hire an

00:31:56.846 --> 00:31:57.576 A:middle
illustrator.

00:31:57.856 --> 00:32:01.036 A:middle
And the illustrator explored a

00:31:57.856 --> 00:32:01.036 A:middle
And the illustrator explored a

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:03.426 A:middle
color system and a graphic style

00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:05.206 A:middle
and just in looking at those

00:32:05.246 --> 00:32:07.186 A:middle
three examples, you could see

00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:10.086 A:middle
how different the game could

00:32:10.086 --> 00:32:11.996 A:middle
have been given the different

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:13.466 A:middle
tones and styles that he

00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:13.826 A:middle
explored.

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:18.886 A:middle
So an app or game can be

00:32:18.976 --> 00:32:20.966 A:middle
functional without being

00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:23.256 A:middle
beautiful, but the beauty that

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:24.576 A:middle
ELOH's designer brought into the

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:26.506 A:middle
game does more than make it look

00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:26.846 A:middle
good.

00:32:27.826 --> 00:32:29.706 A:middle
It enhances the gameplay and

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:31.716 A:middle
brings visibility and life to

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:32.966 A:middle
the interactive elements.

00:32:33.506 --> 00:32:35.126 A:middle
There aren't many interactive

00:32:35.126 --> 00:32:36.226 A:middle
elements in the game, so they

00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:37.886 A:middle
took care with each one, like

00:32:37.886 --> 00:32:39.376 A:middle
this button that appears when

00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:40.766 A:middle
you solve a puzzle.

00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:43.746 A:middle
And the visual detail allowed

00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:45.106 A:middle
the characters to really come

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:45.636 A:middle
alive.

00:32:46.126 --> 00:32:48.286 A:middle
These little guys have so much

00:32:48.286 --> 00:32:49.196 A:middle
personality.

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:51.186 A:middle
When you drag an obstacle from

00:32:51.186 --> 00:32:53.606 A:middle
place to place or when a ball

00:32:53.606 --> 00:32:54.956 A:middle
hits it, it responds.

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:57.396 A:middle
And those small moments were

00:32:57.396 --> 00:32:58.976 A:middle
really carefully considered.

00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:00.366 A:middle
You could just tell that the

00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:00.366 A:middle
You could just tell that the

00:33:00.366 --> 00:33:02.236 A:middle
animators were thinking about

00:33:02.236 --> 00:33:03.966 A:middle
what the face should look like

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:06.346 A:middle
when the ball hits it or when a

00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:08.726 A:middle
finger pushes down on it.

00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:09.976 A:middle
Pretty amazing.

00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:13.426 A:middle
And the team brought in a sound

00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:13.986 A:middle
designer.

00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:16.076 A:middle
The sounds feel natural.

00:33:16.556 --> 00:33:18.686 A:middle
When you succeed, the sounds are

00:33:18.686 --> 00:33:20.686 A:middle
rhythmic, and the sound adapts

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:23.446 A:middle
to build drama and suspense

00:33:23.676 --> 00:33:25.106 A:middle
within each level and between

00:33:25.106 --> 00:33:25.526 A:middle
levels.

00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:28.726 A:middle
So ELOH's aesthetics also deepen

00:33:28.726 --> 00:33:29.546 A:middle
the experience.

00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:31.466 A:middle
They connect emotionally with

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:33.656 A:middle
people while also reinforcing

00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:34.946 A:middle
the intent of the game.

00:33:36.356 --> 00:33:37.786 A:middle
So I want to make one more

00:33:37.786 --> 00:33:38.926 A:middle
subtle point on this.

00:33:39.136 --> 00:33:40.906 A:middle
The people that came together to

00:33:40.906 --> 00:33:43.556 A:middle
create ELOH put so much work

00:33:43.556 --> 00:33:44.796 A:middle
into the game, and I want to

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.936 A:middle
talk about a subtle thing that

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:48.346 A:middle
they did to give people a chance

00:33:48.486 --> 00:33:50.356 A:middle
to enjoy the gameplay and the

00:33:50.356 --> 00:33:50.976 A:middle
game's beauty.

00:33:53.326 --> 00:33:54.186 A:middle
So they mentioned something

00:33:54.186 --> 00:33:55.326 A:middle
interesting when I asked where

00:33:55.326 --> 00:33:56.426 A:middle
the game came from.

00:33:56.946 --> 00:33:58.136 A:middle
They said that modern puzzle

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.486 A:middle
games often fail to create

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.486 A:middle
games often fail to create

00:34:00.486 --> 00:34:02.906 A:middle
long-lasting excitement because

00:34:02.906 --> 00:34:04.346 A:middle
the only thing that happens is

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.546 A:middle
that the puzzles just get harder

00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:06.086 A:middle
and harder.

00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:09.346 A:middle
What's fun about that?

00:34:10.136 --> 00:34:11.696 A:middle
Every puzzle game gets

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:13.156 A:middle
annoyingly difficult at some

00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:15.235 A:middle
point and it's easy to just want

00:34:15.235 --> 00:34:15.565 A:middle
to quit.

00:34:15.926 --> 00:34:17.746 A:middle
But in ELOH, every once in a

00:34:17.746 --> 00:34:18.946 A:middle
while when you finish an

00:34:18.946 --> 00:34:21.005 A:middle
especially hard level, you find

00:34:21.005 --> 00:34:23.085 A:middle
out that the next one is much

00:34:23.085 --> 00:34:23.726 A:middle
simpler.

00:34:24.386 --> 00:34:26.956 A:middle
And the aesthetics rise to the

00:34:26.956 --> 00:34:29.676 A:middle
surface again and you can notice

00:34:29.775 --> 00:34:31.596 A:middle
the craft of the characters and

00:34:31.596 --> 00:34:32.876 A:middle
appreciate the rhythm of the

00:34:32.876 --> 00:34:33.525 A:middle
soundtrack.

00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.346 A:middle
Or turning the page.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:36.536 A:middle
Ah.

00:34:36.976 --> 00:34:37.335 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So nice.

00:34:37.726 --> 00:34:38.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Simpler.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.696 A:middle
So that's what I mean by the

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:42.956 A:middle
aesthetics having a practical

00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:43.485 A:middle
benefit.

00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.275 A:middle
The design matches the intent of

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:47.565 A:middle
the game, and the casual fun

00:34:47.616 --> 00:34:49.505 A:middle
resurfaces every so often as you

00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.795 A:middle
progress through 99 levels.

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:56.076 A:middle
So we expect aesthetics to be

00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:58.426 A:middle
embodied in every element of the

00:34:58.426 --> 00:34:59.776 A:middle
app, and I want to show you one

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.936 A:middle
more quick thing that I think is

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.936 A:middle
more quick thing that I think is

00:35:01.936 --> 00:35:02.556 A:middle
awesome.

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.606 A:middle
The HomeCourt team really

00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:07.216 A:middle
sweated the details with their

00:35:07.216 --> 00:35:08.116 A:middle
app icon.

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.156 A:middle
The shapes in the icon clearly

00:35:11.156 --> 00:35:12.436 A:middle
draw inspiration from the

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:15.006 A:middle
elements of a basketball court.

00:35:15.596 --> 00:35:17.306 A:middle
So a great app icon allows

00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:18.836 A:middle
people to quickly scan their

00:35:18.836 --> 00:35:21.016 A:middle
home screen and map what they

00:35:21.016 --> 00:35:22.856 A:middle
want to do to the intent of the

00:35:22.856 --> 00:35:23.136 A:middle
app.

00:35:24.246 --> 00:35:26.376 A:middle
The H and the C of HomeCourt

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.936 A:middle
emerge from the boundary lines

00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:28.976 A:middle
of the basketball court.

00:35:28.976 --> 00:35:31.546 A:middle
And the background is a clear

00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.976 A:middle
call-out to the orange of a

00:35:32.976 --> 00:35:33.616 A:middle
basketball.

00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:34.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, Doug.

00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:35.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:35:36.216 --> 00:35:37.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I don't remember

00:35:37.946 --> 00:35:39.336 A:middle
HomeCourt being in our agenda to

00:35:39.336 --> 00:35:40.516 A:middle
be talking about aesthetics.

00:35:40.936 --> 00:35:41.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:42.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We were supposed to be

00:35:42.426 --> 00:35:45.286 A:middle
talking about Thumper, ELOH and

00:35:45.286 --> 00:35:45.616 A:middle
Ordia.

00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:48.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What more is there to say?

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:48.686 A:middle
[Laughs]

00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:50.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, I just want to make

00:35:50.796 --> 00:35:52.026 A:middle
sure we have time to talk about

00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:53.986 A:middle
how aesthetics can create

00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:55.196 A:middle
something that feels really

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:55.676 A:middle
cohesive.

00:35:55.676 --> 00:35:57.846 A:middle
And that aesthetics can give an

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
app a perception of quality

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
app a perception of quality

00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.816 A:middle
through a really clear and

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:03.136 A:middle
consistent design language.

00:36:03.866 --> 00:36:05.906 A:middle
Now Ordia is a game that tells a

00:36:05.906 --> 00:36:07.256 A:middle
story about the struggles of

00:36:07.376 --> 00:36:08.756 A:middle
early primordial life.

00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:11.296 A:middle
And I just love the organic

00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:13.136 A:middle
blobbiness of everything in

00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:15.386 A:middle
Ordia, from the menus to the

00:36:15.386 --> 00:36:18.376 A:middle
transitions, levels, characters.

00:36:18.686 --> 00:36:19.946 A:middle
I mean, this blobby theme is

00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:21.486 A:middle
carried through everything in

00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:22.846 A:middle
the entire game experience.

00:36:23.576 --> 00:36:25.036 A:middle
There's also clever sound design

00:36:25.036 --> 00:36:26.406 A:middle
and haptics to create a really

00:36:26.406 --> 00:36:28.526 A:middle
rich atmosphere to enhance this

00:36:28.526 --> 00:36:30.056 A:middle
incredibly sticky world.

00:36:30.926 --> 00:36:32.936 A:middle
And every screen sticks

00:36:32.966 --> 00:36:33.406 A:middle
together.

00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:35.396 A:middle
They family really well.

00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:37.776 A:middle
Ordia's design language is

00:36:37.776 --> 00:36:38.596 A:middle
meaningful.

00:36:38.876 --> 00:36:40.306 A:middle
It helps communicate to people

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.866 A:middle
what's interactive, what isn't,

00:36:43.096 --> 00:36:44.836 A:middle
and also the colors help people

00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:46.136 A:middle
know what's friendly when it's

00:36:46.136 --> 00:36:46.816 A:middle
in the game.

00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:50.366 A:middle
So to quote the developer, they

00:36:50.366 --> 00:36:52.066 A:middle
wanted to have the player always

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.346 A:middle
feel like they were in the same

00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:53.976 A:middle
environment.

00:36:55.086 --> 00:36:56.706 A:middle
The same environment.

00:36:56.706 --> 00:36:58.236 A:middle
I think that's a great goal for

00:36:58.236 --> 00:36:59.336 A:middle
your app or game.

00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:01.716 A:middle
To create cohesion and

00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:01.716 A:middle
To create cohesion and

00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:03.776 A:middle
consistency between every aspect

00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:04.536 A:middle
of your design.

00:37:05.816 --> 00:37:07.726 A:middle
So your app or game also needs

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.076 A:middle
to feel connected to the

00:37:09.076 --> 00:37:10.726 A:middle
platform to be truly cohesive.

00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:12.936 A:middle
So you can tell that Ordia was

00:37:12.966 --> 00:37:14.916 A:middle
designed for iOS just by taking

00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:16.386 A:middle
a look at the Share icon.

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:18.886 A:middle
This seemingly simple design

00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:20.726 A:middle
decision makes a really big

00:37:20.726 --> 00:37:22.306 A:middle
difference in helping people

00:37:22.646 --> 00:37:24.446 A:middle
understand your app and also

00:37:24.446 --> 00:37:26.046 A:middle
making it feel at home in the

00:37:26.046 --> 00:37:27.206 A:middle
platform it runs on.

00:37:28.426 --> 00:37:30.006 A:middle
Now I know it's really hard work

00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:32.766 A:middle
to create designs that stick

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:34.726 A:middle
together, especially when it

00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:36.496 A:middle
feels like creating an app or

00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:39.406 A:middle
game can be an endless upwards

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:39.886 A:middle
climb.

00:37:41.236 --> 00:37:43.036 A:middle
But by creating a cohesive

00:37:43.036 --> 00:37:45.106 A:middle
design, it raises the overall

00:37:45.106 --> 00:37:46.436 A:middle
quality of your experience.

00:37:47.186 --> 00:37:49.096 A:middle
So to make your app or game

00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:51.416 A:middle
cohesive, create a consistent

00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:52.296 A:middle
design language.

00:37:53.316 --> 00:37:55.386 A:middle
Lay out every single screen

00:37:55.386 --> 00:37:57.486 A:middle
side-by-side and ask yourself,

00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:59.986 A:middle
does anything feel out of place?

00:38:00.726 --> 00:38:02.076 A:middle
And if it does, replace it with

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:03.346 A:middle
something that families better.

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:05.886 A:middle
And finally, cohesiveness

00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:08.046 A:middle
applies to how your app or game

00:38:08.046 --> 00:38:09.136 A:middle
runs on the platform.

00:38:09.906 --> 00:38:11.396 A:middle
And just to tie this all back to

00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:13.986 A:middle
aesthetics, in Thumper aesthetic

00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:15.986 A:middle
beauty helped create immersion.

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:18.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ELOH shows how these

00:38:18.226 --> 00:38:19.856 A:middle
aesthetics support the intended

00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:21.516 A:middle
behavior or experience.

00:38:22.296 --> 00:38:23.826 A:middle
And aesthetics are embodied in

00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.456 A:middle
every element of the app, down

00:38:25.456 --> 00:38:26.286 A:middle
to its icon.

00:38:26.876 --> 00:38:27.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:30.786 A:middle
And creating consistent

00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:32.806 A:middle
experience is really important

00:38:32.976 --> 00:38:34.926 A:middle
with a cohesive design language.

00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:35.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:36.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And that's aesthetics.

00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:39.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's go on to the

00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:41.096 A:middle
next subtle theme running

00:38:41.096 --> 00:38:43.096 A:middle
through all great apps, and

00:38:43.096 --> 00:38:44.546 A:middle
that's that they're inclusive.

00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:47.156 A:middle
So when we talk about inclusion

00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:48.406 A:middle
in design, we mean that

00:38:48.406 --> 00:38:50.246 A:middle
interfaces are usable by

00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:50.896 A:middle
everyone.

00:38:51.816 --> 00:38:52.996 A:middle
So let's go back to Pixelmator

00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:54.776 A:middle
Photo for just a moment and look

00:38:54.776 --> 00:38:56.266 A:middle
at one of the benefits of using

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:58.146 A:middle
native components to ensure as

00:38:58.146 --> 00:38:59.906 A:middle
many people as possible can use

00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:00.346 A:middle
your app.

00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:00.346 A:middle
your app.

00:39:01.456 --> 00:39:03.006 A:middle
I want to focus on one element:

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.706 A:middle
the native UI switch.

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:06.816 A:middle
Here it works nicely as a way of

00:39:06.816 --> 00:39:08.576 A:middle
activating or deactivating

00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:09.396 A:middle
parameters.

00:39:10.356 --> 00:39:11.866 A:middle
It clearly communicates the

00:39:11.866 --> 00:39:13.516 A:middle
state of each parameter and

00:39:13.516 --> 00:39:15.736 A:middle
provides a way to remove it and

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:17.306 A:middle
add it again without losing

00:39:17.306 --> 00:39:17.546 A:middle
work.

00:39:18.786 --> 00:39:20.796 A:middle
When I asked the Pixelmator team

00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:22.766 A:middle
about this, they said originally

00:39:23.016 --> 00:39:23.976 A:middle
they were going to bring over

00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:28.116 A:middle
the controls from their Mac app.

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:29.666 A:middle
And while the appearance is

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.416 A:middle
similar, the checkboxes don't

00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:34.386 A:middle
pop or communicate as clearly as

00:39:34.746 --> 00:39:35.366 A:middle
the switch.

00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:39.276 A:middle
And not only is the switch a

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:42.716 A:middle
familiar iOS element, it's also

00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:43.496 A:middle
accessible.

00:39:43.886 --> 00:39:45.506 A:middle
In the Accessibility section of

00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.016 A:middle
the Settings app, people can

00:39:47.016 --> 00:39:48.656 A:middle
turn on labels that allow these

00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:50.176 A:middle
switches to be even more

00:39:50.366 --> 00:39:50.856 A:middle
legible.

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:54.646 A:middle
So using standard components

00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.186 A:middle
creates consistency,

00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:58.086 A:middle
predictability and legibility

00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:00.716 A:middle
across apps and devices.

00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:00.716 A:middle
across apps and devices.

00:40:02.186 --> 00:40:03.246 A:middle
So Lauren, I know you have an

00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:04.796 A:middle
awesome example of inclusion as

00:40:04.796 --> 00:40:05.086 A:middle
well.

00:40:05.456 --> 00:40:06.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.

00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:08.226 A:middle
I want to go back to Ordia.

00:40:09.446 --> 00:40:11.626 A:middle
Now in Ordia, every creature has

00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:13.186 A:middle
a color that communicates to the

00:40:13.246 --> 00:40:15.646 A:middle
player whether it's good, bad or

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.306 A:middle
meant to aid in navigation.

00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:19.056 A:middle
The developer didn't want to

00:40:19.056 --> 00:40:20.706 A:middle
exclude anyone from being able

00:40:20.706 --> 00:40:22.326 A:middle
to understand the game, so they

00:40:22.326 --> 00:40:23.936 A:middle
support a colorblind mode for

00:40:23.936 --> 00:40:24.806 A:middle
people with partial

00:40:24.806 --> 00:40:25.576 A:middle
colorblindness.

00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:27.866 A:middle
To create this, the developers

00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:29.146 A:middle
took screenshots of the game,

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:31.256 A:middle
applied filters to stimulate

00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:31.956 A:middle
different types of

00:40:31.956 --> 00:40:33.806 A:middle
colorblindness and then worked

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.616 A:middle
on rebalancing those colors to

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:36.546 A:middle
make them more distinct.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:39.916 A:middle
And they made every single

00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:41.666 A:middle
design element distinctive to

00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:43.156 A:middle
include people with full

00:40:43.156 --> 00:40:44.056 A:middle
colorblindness.

00:40:44.406 --> 00:40:46.266 A:middle
So they also tested the game in

00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:47.326 A:middle
pure monochrome.

00:40:48.356 --> 00:40:50.366 A:middle
With over 300 million people

00:40:50.366 --> 00:40:52.316 A:middle
worldwide with some form of

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.216 A:middle
colorblindness, Ordia is

00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:55.486 A:middle
wonderfully inclusive.

00:40:56.416 --> 00:40:59.186 A:middle
So to get started, design for

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.416 A:middle
everyone and investigate if your

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.416 A:middle
everyone and investigate if your

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:03.276 A:middle
app or game is inclusive and

00:41:03.276 --> 00:41:03.796 A:middle
accessible.

00:41:04.476 --> 00:41:05.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; More and more Apple

00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:06.716 A:middle
frameworks and elements are made

00:41:06.716 --> 00:41:08.856 A:middle
accessible with each release, so

00:41:08.936 --> 00:41:10.316 A:middle
the more you use native

00:41:10.316 --> 00:41:11.946 A:middle
frameworks, the more people will

00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:13.416 A:middle
be able to use your app.

00:41:14.196 --> 00:41:15.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, we're in the home

00:41:15.186 --> 00:41:15.636 A:middle
stretch.

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:16.336 A:middle
Hang tight.

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:17.986 A:middle
We're going to move on to

00:41:17.986 --> 00:41:19.346 A:middle
attention to detail.

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:21.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Attention to detail is a core

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.366 A:middle
value at Apple.

00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:23.866 A:middle
It's something we strive to do

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.276 A:middle
in everything that we do.

00:41:25.806 --> 00:41:27.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Meticulous and deliberately

00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:29.356 A:middle
designed apps and games are the

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:31.676 A:middle
outcome of hard work, the desire

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:34.176 A:middle
for perfection, and it's also a

00:41:34.346 --> 00:41:36.306 A:middle
telltale sign that the people

00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:37.836 A:middle
that created the app or game

00:41:38.136 --> 00:41:39.886 A:middle
cared about every single aspect

00:41:39.886 --> 00:41:42.046 A:middle
of the experience down to the

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.536 A:middle
last pixel.

00:41:43.656 --> 00:41:45.966 A:middle
So let's talk about Flow by

00:41:45.966 --> 00:41:46.586 A:middle
Moleskine.

00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:49.016 A:middle
This is a drawing app that has a

00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:51.206 A:middle
continual horizontal canvas with

00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:52.806 A:middle
a fully customizable set of

00:41:52.886 --> 00:41:53.206 A:middle
tools.

00:41:54.016 --> 00:41:56.316 A:middle
This app has one goal and it's

00:41:56.316 --> 00:41:58.316 A:middle
to help you stay in a state of

00:41:58.316 --> 00:41:59.316 A:middle
creative flow.

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:01.096 A:middle
Now we're just going to focus in

00:42:01.096 --> 00:42:02.676 A:middle
on one element of this app that

00:42:02.676 --> 00:42:04.676 A:middle
showcases a tremendous amount of

00:42:04.676 --> 00:42:05.696 A:middle
attention to detail.

00:42:06.896 --> 00:42:08.786 A:middle
Flow's tool and color selector

00:42:08.786 --> 00:42:10.366 A:middle
is one of the most comprehensive

00:42:10.366 --> 00:42:11.876 A:middle
and easy to use that we have

00:42:12.076 --> 00:42:12.726 A:middle
ever seen.

00:42:13.506 --> 00:42:14.736 A:middle
Now you can tell how much the

00:42:14.736 --> 00:42:16.186 A:middle
developer cared about every

00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:17.416 A:middle
aspect of this experience,

00:42:18.316 --> 00:42:20.076 A:middle
because the number of colors

00:42:20.226 --> 00:42:21.036 A:middle
feel endless.

00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:22.786 A:middle
And the interaction from

00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:24.516 A:middle
changing the hue, brightness and

00:42:24.516 --> 00:42:26.286 A:middle
saturation provides immediate

00:42:26.286 --> 00:42:26.596 A:middle
feedback.

00:42:27.766 --> 00:42:29.216 A:middle
To create this experience, the

00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:30.986 A:middle
developer spent countless hours

00:42:31.056 --> 00:42:31.886 A:middle
prototyping.

00:42:32.406 --> 00:42:33.446 A:middle
Now here's an example of a

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:35.286 A:middle
prototype that was designed to

00:42:35.316 --> 00:42:36.336 A:middle
check the interaction

00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:37.506 A:middle
fundamentals first.

00:42:38.486 --> 00:42:40.076 A:middle
They used pure text buttons so

00:42:40.076 --> 00:42:41.106 A:middle
they wouldn't get distracted by

00:42:41.106 --> 00:42:42.336 A:middle
high-fidelity designs.

00:42:42.866 --> 00:42:44.876 A:middle
That way they could focus on the

00:42:44.876 --> 00:42:46.646 A:middle
detail of perfecting each

00:42:46.646 --> 00:42:48.436 A:middle
interaction of the tool editor.

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:51.676 A:middle
Only after the interactions felt

00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:53.496 A:middle
good did the developers at Flow

00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:55.036 A:middle
move on to visual design.

00:42:55.586 --> 00:42:58.446 A:middle
Then they iterated to perfect

00:42:58.536 --> 00:43:00.036 A:middle
the details of each individual

00:42:58.536 --> 00:43:00.036 A:middle
the details of each individual

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:01.386 A:middle
tool over time.

00:43:02.176 --> 00:43:04.006 A:middle
And they simplified how unique

00:43:04.076 --> 00:43:05.286 A:middle
properties of the tool were

00:43:05.286 --> 00:43:07.396 A:middle
displayed from the nibs, colors

00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:08.076 A:middle
and labels.

00:43:09.146 --> 00:43:10.526 A:middle
And finally, I just want to call

00:43:10.526 --> 00:43:12.146 A:middle
out how animation brings this

00:43:12.146 --> 00:43:13.756 A:middle
entire experience together.

00:43:14.576 --> 00:43:16.276 A:middle
In the real world, things

00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:17.866 A:middle
transition smoothly from one

00:43:17.946 --> 00:43:18.946 A:middle
state to another.

00:43:19.506 --> 00:43:21.326 A:middle
And it's reflected beautifully

00:43:21.326 --> 00:43:22.466 A:middle
in the Tool Editor here.

00:43:23.466 --> 00:43:25.506 A:middle
Animation is so much more than a

00:43:25.506 --> 00:43:26.986 A:middle
series of screens connected by

00:43:26.986 --> 00:43:27.696 A:middle
transitions.

00:43:28.436 --> 00:43:30.396 A:middle
Really good animation reminds

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:32.376 A:middle
people how to use your UI.

00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:34.396 A:middle
And it provides feedback and

00:43:34.396 --> 00:43:35.606 A:middle
also draws your attention

00:43:35.606 --> 00:43:36.296 A:middle
onscreen.

00:43:37.776 --> 00:43:38.906 A:middle
But that's not all.

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:42.856 A:middle
There are over 1,400 unique

00:43:42.856 --> 00:43:43.906 A:middle
color names in this app.

00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:45.786 A:middle
And when I asked the developer

00:43:45.786 --> 00:43:49.676 A:middle
how long it took, they said, "A

00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:49.976 A:middle
while."

00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:53.786 A:middle
In addition to collecting and

00:43:53.786 --> 00:43:55.496 A:middle
sourcing these color names, the

00:43:55.496 --> 00:43:57.306 A:middle
developer sweated the details to

00:43:57.306 --> 00:44:00.546 A:middle
determine what the rules were

00:43:57.306 --> 00:44:00.546 A:middle
determine what the rules were

00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:02.496 A:middle
for each color and how it mapped

00:44:02.826 --> 00:44:04.156 A:middle
to each color value.

00:44:05.486 --> 00:44:06.856 A:middle
The tool palette with an

00:44:06.856 --> 00:44:08.446 A:middle
expansive color selection

00:44:08.526 --> 00:44:10.456 A:middle
enables creative expression.

00:44:10.456 --> 00:44:12.386 A:middle
And that stays true to the app's

00:44:12.666 --> 00:44:14.866 A:middle
goal of helping you stay in a

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:15.866 A:middle
creative mindset.

00:44:17.146 --> 00:44:19.156 A:middle
The developer absolutely nailed

00:44:19.236 --> 00:44:21.876 A:middle
the purpose, expanse and joy of

00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.756 A:middle
this experience all through the

00:44:23.756 --> 00:44:25.566 A:middle
details that come together.

00:44:27.136 --> 00:44:28.696 A:middle
Now attention to detail helps

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.986 A:middle
your app or game stand out.

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.016 A:middle
It's all about taking the time

00:44:34.256 --> 00:44:35.666 A:middle
and being comfortable staying in

00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:37.136 A:middle
the process of designing.

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.176 A:middle
And you don't want to settle for

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.786 A:middle
your first idea or your first

00:44:40.786 --> 00:44:41.276 A:middle
design.

00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:43.836 A:middle
It's about being methodical.

00:44:44.386 --> 00:44:45.716 A:middle
Solve the really big problems

00:44:45.786 --> 00:44:47.396 A:middle
first, just like Flow did with

00:44:47.396 --> 00:44:48.996 A:middle
interaction in that prototype we

00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:50.866 A:middle
saw, before you move on to

00:44:50.866 --> 00:44:52.166 A:middle
adding further detail like

00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.856 A:middle
visual design animation.

00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:56.976 A:middle
And I love this statement from a

00:44:56.976 --> 00:44:58.096 A:middle
really good friend of mine.

00:44:58.556 --> 00:45:00.696 A:middle
At the end of the day, when

00:44:58.556 --> 00:45:00.696 A:middle
At the end of the day, when

00:45:00.696 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
someone experiences your app or

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.196 A:middle
game, they should be able to see

00:45:04.196 --> 00:45:04.976 A:middle
the developer's sweat.

00:45:08.116 --> 00:45:09.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That is kind of gross.

00:45:09.786 --> 00:45:10.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh come on, it's not that

00:45:10.806 --> 00:45:10.976 A:middle
gross.

00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:11.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But I think I know what you

00:45:11.816 --> 00:45:12.226 A:middle
mean.

00:45:13.046 --> 00:45:14.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think what they mean

00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:16.316 A:middle
is it shows that the developer

00:45:16.316 --> 00:45:19.136 A:middle
totally cared about every aspect

00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:21.166 A:middle
of the experience down to the

00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:23.816 A:middle
very last pixel.

00:45:24.186 --> 00:45:25.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we talked about immersion,

00:45:26.136 --> 00:45:28.516 A:middle
trust -- sorry -- innovation,

00:45:28.516 --> 00:45:30.556 A:middle
trust, refinement, aesthetics,

00:45:30.696 --> 00:45:32.176 A:middle
inclusion and attention to

00:45:32.176 --> 00:45:34.626 A:middle
detail with a single example

00:45:35.216 --> 00:45:36.946 A:middle
with each award-winning app and

00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:37.596 A:middle
game.

00:45:38.516 --> 00:45:40.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But all of these apps and

00:45:40.236 --> 00:45:42.506 A:middle
games embody these qualities of

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.286 A:middle
great design.

00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:45.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; These developers sweated the

00:45:45.996 --> 00:45:48.466 A:middle
details and created memorable

00:45:48.466 --> 00:45:49.356 A:middle
experiences.

00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:51.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Those experiences are totally

00:45:51.606 --> 00:45:52.876 A:middle
immersive and fun.

00:45:53.716 --> 00:45:56.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And everyone, by taking risks

00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:57.866 A:middle
and staying true to a vision,

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:00.266 A:middle
they provided access to things

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:00.266 A:middle
they provided access to things

00:46:00.266 --> 00:46:02.146 A:middle
that people didn't have before.

00:46:02.866 --> 00:46:04.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And all of these apps and

00:46:04.096 --> 00:46:05.896 A:middle
games are original.

00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:07.956 A:middle
There's no copy and paste in the

00:46:07.956 --> 00:46:10.536 A:middle
world of great design.

00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:11.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; These innovations extended

00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:13.296 A:middle
the reach of care to millions of

00:46:13.296 --> 00:46:14.506 A:middle
people around the world.

00:46:15.226 --> 00:46:16.726 A:middle
So we want to thank the

00:46:16.726 --> 00:46:17.926 A:middle
developers who shared their

00:46:17.926 --> 00:46:18.956 A:middle
stories with us.

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:20.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It was an honor to get a peek

00:46:20.636 --> 00:46:21.896 A:middle
behind the curtain at how you

00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:23.126 A:middle
designed your award-winning apps

00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:23.856 A:middle
and games.

00:46:25.006 --> 00:46:25.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Together] Thank you so much

00:46:25.956 --> 00:46:27.536 A:middle
and have a great WWDC.

00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:30.241 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:30.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.
