[ Applause ]

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:13.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good day.

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:18.066 A:middle
Welcome. Over the past year, my

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.246 A:middle
team and I have been reimagining

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.826 A:middle
the Apple TV experience.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:25.986 A:middle
We've been testing ideas and

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:28.456 A:middle
exploring ways to bring the fun

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.336 A:middle
back into browsing.

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:33.916 A:middle
Today, we're going to share with

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:36.496 A:middle
you our approach to mastering

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.606 A:middle
the living room and connecting

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:41.666 A:middle
people more thoughtfully to the

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.686 A:middle
content they love.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:47.336 A:middle
My name is Tommy Payne.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.866 A:middle
My friends call me T.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.996 A:middle
Payne, and I'm a designer here

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:51.436 A:middle
at Apple.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.196 A:middle
Growing up in Australia, the

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:57.496 A:middle
rest of the world felt very far

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.496 A:middle
away, and I was searching for

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:00.446 A:middle
ways to connect.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:00.446 A:middle
ways to connect.

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:02.426 A:middle
I was interested and curious

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:03.686 A:middle
about other cultures, other

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:05.346 A:middle
people, different areas and

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.136 A:middle
environments.

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:12.456 A:middle
So I looked to TV and movies to

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.006 A:middle
bridge that connection.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.406 A:middle
And I would come home from

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.736 A:middle
school, plunk down on the couch,

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:19.906 A:middle
and turn on the tele.

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.056 A:middle
And I would start to channel

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:25.936 A:middle
surf, flicking up and down until

00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:27.496 A:middle
something caught my attention.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.306 A:middle
And when it did, I was

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.186 A:middle
captivated.

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:31.866 A:middle
I was engrossed.

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.066 A:middle
I was drawn into that story.

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:40.866 A:middle
Picture in your mind a film or

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.896 A:middle
TV show that you connected with.

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:46.336 A:middle
Think about how it made you feel

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:50.496 A:middle
and how time and space melted

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.566 A:middle
away when it's just you living

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:55.656 A:middle
that drama.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.676 A:middle
Now, hold on to that feeling as

00:01:58.676 --> 00:01:59.346 A:middle
we continue.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:01.186 A:middle
I'm not going to be talking

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:01.186 A:middle
I'm not going to be talking

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:02.616 A:middle
about code, but my friends will

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:03.066 A:middle
get to that.

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.176 A:middle
I'm going to talk about the joy

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:07.896 A:middle
of discovery.

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.926 A:middle
How do we get people into what

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.446 A:middle
they want to watch quicker and

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.546 A:middle
remove barriers to entry?

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:20.566 A:middle
The current state of TV, well,

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:22.316 A:middle
it's kind of tedious.

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:24.436 A:middle
You're presented with rows and

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:26.286 A:middle
rows and rows of content to

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:27.366 A:middle
scroll through.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:31.186 A:middle
Who here has spent five minutes,

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.556 A:middle
10 minutes, 20 minutes just

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
searching for something to

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:36.936 A:middle
watch?

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:40.076 A:middle
It's a common and frustrating

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:40.566 A:middle
experience.

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:45.276 A:middle
And in that, we've become

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.786 A:middle
paralyzed by choice and robbed

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:48.716 A:middle
by indecision.

00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:53.626 A:middle
So, that's the problem.

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:55.966 A:middle
Now, let's talk about the

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:56.486 A:middle
solution.

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:01.816 A:middle
Apple TV has purposefully

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:01.816 A:middle
Apple TV has purposefully

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.896 A:middle
migrated its designs towards a

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.666 A:middle
content first experience.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:10.006 A:middle
And all that really means is

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:11.266 A:middle
something's on, something's

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:11.956 A:middle
playing.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.266 A:middle
When you launch into the

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.546 A:middle
application, it's alive.

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:20.156 A:middle
So, I'm going to break down for

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:22.576 A:middle
you how to achieve a content

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:24.646 A:middle
first experience with some best

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:26.426 A:middle
practices, and I'm going to use

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:28.346 A:middle
examples from the redesign of

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.616 A:middle
Top Shelf and a couple from our

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:31.906 A:middle
own TV app.

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.986 A:middle
First of all, we want to remove

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.426 A:middle
barriers to entry, get rid of

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.746 A:middle
any hurdles between the content

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:43.456 A:middle
and the viewer.

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:47.066 A:middle
This principle is why Top Shelf

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:49.376 A:middle
has become interactive and

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:50.826 A:middle
immersive.

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:52.876 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.506 A:middle
So we launch into Apple TV and

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.255 A:middle
we hold on a poster image for

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:18.656 A:middle
five seconds.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
After which, a trailer comes in.

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:25.796 A:middle
And it's important to note here

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:27.666 A:middle
that that trailer, we don't

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:29.396 A:middle
force sound on the viewer in

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.366 A:middle
this instance.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:32.816 A:middle
Too much sound and video when

00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:34.186 A:middle
you first launch into something,

00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.656 A:middle
it can be destructive.

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.156 A:middle
However, we do allow people to

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:40.756 A:middle
invoke the audio later on in the

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:41.306 A:middle
experience.

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:45.836 A:middle
So, the content is taking up all

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:46.396 A:middle
the pixels.

00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:48.406 A:middle
It's filling the screen.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:53.996 A:middle
Next, we want to ensure that

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:55.686 A:middle
because people are now watching

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.266 A:middle
something that they can easily

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:57.886 A:middle
interact.

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.296 A:middle
Every swipe or click on the

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.296 A:middle
Every swipe or click on the

00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:03.156 A:middle
remote, it adds to somebody's

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:04.026 A:middle
cognitive load.

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:06.436 A:middle
So we want to reduce the number

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.176 A:middle
of steps it takes for them to

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:09.906 A:middle
achieve their task.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:15.506 A:middle
In Top Shelf, we use a visual

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:17.846 A:middle
hint in the upper part of the

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:20.456 A:middle
screen, and this tells people

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:22.406 A:middle
swipe up to enter into full

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:22.996 A:middle
screen mode.

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:24.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at that in

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:25.376 A:middle
action.

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:27.976 A:middle
The user will place their thumb

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.326 A:middle
on the remote and swipe up, at

00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:33.876 A:middle
which point the dock flies away

00:05:34.236 --> 00:05:36.146 A:middle
and you're left with just the

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:38.616 A:middle
trailer playing in all its glory

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.916 A:middle
filling the screen.

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:43.226 A:middle
So you're still actually in a

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:45.766 A:middle
browse mode but it feels like

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:47.076 A:middle
playback, it feels like you're

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:48.716 A:middle
inside the movie which is really

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:49.036 A:middle
cool.

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
Anywhere that we can streamline

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:55.506 A:middle
interactions, that's a good

00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:56.686 A:middle
thing for our viewers.

00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:58.406 A:middle
So we've borrowed this

00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
interaction from inside of TV

00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
interaction from inside of TV

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:02.536 A:middle
app where we use it to invoke

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:04.446 A:middle
and hide menus in the playback

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.086 A:middle
experience.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.636 A:middle
So by leveraging that knowledge

00:06:07.776 --> 00:06:09.036 A:middle
that already exists in the

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.176 A:middle
viewer's mind, we're making it

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:12.296 A:middle
easier because they don't have

00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:13.906 A:middle
to learn something from scratch

00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:15.726 A:middle
in this new context.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.276 A:middle
So now that people are

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:21.746 A:middle
interacting, you want the app

00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:24.626 A:middle
and the experience to feel

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:25.246 A:middle
responsive.

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.686 A:middle
Speed and pacing are essential

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:29.836 A:middle
ingredients for minimizing

00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:31.226 A:middle
cognitive load.

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.636 A:middle
Try and remove latency and lag

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:35.056 A:middle
anywhere you can in your app.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.636 A:middle
That way, it will feel dynamic,

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:38.996 A:middle
it will feel fluid.

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:43.736 A:middle
We also want to avoid

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.576 A:middle
overstimulating people.

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:49.356 A:middle
Closet, chaotic, and distracting

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:51.186 A:middle
interfaces, well, they derail

00:06:51.186 --> 00:06:53.616 A:middle
somebody from their task.

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:55.546 A:middle
Imagine if you will you're

00:06:55.546 --> 00:06:59.416 A:middle
standing in a room and 11 people

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:01.296 A:middle
are talking to you loudly all at

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:01.296 A:middle
are talking to you loudly all at

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:01.596 A:middle
once.

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:04.516 A:middle
You can't hear what any one

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:05.486 A:middle
person is saying.

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:15.106 A:middle
If TV app interfaces do this as

00:07:15.106 --> 00:07:17.886 A:middle
well, people can't focus.

00:07:18.836 --> 00:07:20.956 A:middle
By using too many animations,

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:22.806 A:middle
icons, images and text styles,

00:07:24.006 --> 00:07:25.526 A:middle
it competes for somebody's

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:26.046 A:middle
attention.

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:28.736 A:middle
And we don't want somebody be--

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:30.286 A:middle
to be in that competitive

00:07:30.286 --> 00:07:30.886 A:middle
mindset.

00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:33.466 A:middle
We want them to be focused and

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:34.666 A:middle
relaxed.

00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:39.916 A:middle
Now, that we've made them in

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.826 A:middle
this kind of relaxed state, we

00:07:41.826 --> 00:07:44.036 A:middle
can think about diversifying the

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:46.466 A:middle
types of content in our UI.

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:48.586 A:middle
And just means playing with

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:50.196 A:middle
shapes and aspect ratios,

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:51.716 A:middle
breaking the grid from time to

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:52.066 A:middle
time.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:55.436 A:middle
In our own TV app, we've done

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.766 A:middle
this by interspersing a

00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:00.126 A:middle
different kind of module in

00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:00.126 A:middle
different kind of module in

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:02.446 A:middle
amongst the standard 16 by 9

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:03.676 A:middle
rows.

00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:04.706 A:middle
Now, this allows us to do a

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:05.386 A:middle
couple of things.

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:08.356 A:middle
First, it gives us, the

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:10.846 A:middle
provider, a place to highlight

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:12.336 A:middle
something that's of great

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:14.466 A:middle
importance, something that is

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:16.506 A:middle
really meaningful that we want

00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:17.226 A:middle
you to notice.

00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:20.806 A:middle
And for the viewer, it allows

00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:23.556 A:middle
their eye a moment of pause.

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:25.776 A:middle
As they're scanning through

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.046 A:middle
these dense grids, creating

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:30.206 A:middle
something like this gives them a

00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:31.586 A:middle
time to breathe.

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:37.806 A:middle
We want to reduce the canvas to

00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:40.166 A:middle
simple noncompeting elements.

00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:42.576 A:middle
And this means we create a

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:43.256 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.626 A:middle
In the Top Shelf design, the

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.866 A:middle
content is of highest priority,

00:08:50.136 --> 00:08:51.766 A:middle
so it fills the screen.

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.556 A:middle
Then we have the app dock and a

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:56.116 A:middle
picking row below that in the

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.666 A:middle
lower third, and they're of

00:08:57.726 --> 00:08:59.246 A:middle
slightly less importance.

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:01.376 A:middle
And by prioritizing elements,

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:01.376 A:middle
And by prioritizing elements,

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:04.616 A:middle
you help people to navigate.

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:08.686 A:middle
You help people by leading them

00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:10.286 A:middle
through the experience.

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:16.916 A:middle
Now, meta-data, it's useful but

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.836 A:middle
secondary in the content first

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.706 A:middle
experience of Top Shelf.

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.886 A:middle
Because initially we want to get

00:09:23.886 --> 00:09:25.576 A:middle
people excited about what

00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:27.526 A:middle
they're watching, and then we

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:30.626 A:middle
signal that there's more info

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:31.406 A:middle
available.

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:33.706 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
So the person was inside the

00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
full screen experience of Top

00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
full screen experience of Top

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:02.516 A:middle
Shelf, and they've rested their

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:04.226 A:middle
thumb on the remote or clicked

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:07.686 A:middle
and that invoked the meta-data.

00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:09.766 A:middle
By giving control to the viewer

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:12.336 A:middle
over the how and when to access

00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:14.266 A:middle
this extra information, the path

00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:16.236 A:middle
to pressing play and watching

00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:17.766 A:middle
the whole film becomes

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:18.616 A:middle
simplified.

00:10:19.156 --> 00:10:22.026 A:middle
And what's more, meta-data can

00:10:22.026 --> 00:10:23.906 A:middle
help someone change their mind

00:10:23.906 --> 00:10:26.236 A:middle
from being in a browse mode to

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:28.286 A:middle
perhaps purchase, or from

00:10:28.286 --> 00:10:29.906 A:middle
browsing to subscribe.

00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:34.906 A:middle
Now pagination dots, they

00:10:34.906 --> 00:10:36.806 A:middle
communicate that you're viewing

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:38.896 A:middle
one item in a set.

00:10:39.816 --> 00:10:43.356 A:middle
They also indicate the duration

00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:44.926 A:middle
of the browsing experience.

00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:48.566 A:middle
In our design, they're kept

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:50.206 A:middle
small at the lower part of the

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:51.786 A:middle
screen and they kind of look

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:52.626 A:middle
like bread crumbs.

00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:55.246 A:middle
And we've used Apple TV system

00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:57.546 A:middle
materials to ensure that they

00:10:57.546 --> 00:10:59.506 A:middle
contrast from any imagery that

00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:00.606 A:middle
they sit on top of.

00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:00.606 A:middle
they sit on top of.

00:11:01.156 --> 00:11:02.346 A:middle
We think they make great

00:11:02.346 --> 00:11:04.606 A:middle
additions to your applications

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:07.416 A:middle
as well.

00:11:08.076 --> 00:11:09.956 A:middle
Chevrons indicate swipe

00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:12.176 A:middle
directions, up, down, left,

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:14.916 A:middle
right, but they do something

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:16.176 A:middle
else.

00:11:16.246 --> 00:11:19.346 A:middle
They hint at content just off

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:20.106 A:middle
screen.

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:23.696 A:middle
Together with pagination dots,

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:25.806 A:middle
they help give somebody a sense

00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:28.576 A:middle
of place and ground them in the

00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:28.986 A:middle
UI.

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.676 A:middle
And these little pieces of UI,

00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:34.256 A:middle
they're important tools, because

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:36.286 A:middle
they help people avoid having to

00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:37.906 A:middle
trip and stumble asking

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.586 A:middle
questions, like is this

00:11:39.586 --> 00:11:41.686 A:middle
clickable, how do I navigate out

00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:43.726 A:middle
of here, and, can I get back to

00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:45.356 A:middle
this later?

00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:47.446 A:middle
All these kinds of questions

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:49.976 A:middle
risk ruining somebody's

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:50.696 A:middle
experience.

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:56.026 A:middle
So with the redesigned Top

00:11:56.026 --> 00:11:58.446 A:middle
Shelf, we've enhanced the best

00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:00.706 A:middle
parts of browsing.

00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:00.706 A:middle
parts of browsing.

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:04.276 A:middle
We used edge-to-edge content,

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:05.776 A:middle
taking up the full real estate

00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:07.506 A:middle
available to us.

00:12:07.506 --> 00:12:09.766 A:middle
We have familiar navigational

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:12.456 A:middle
queues, helpful meta-data and

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.006 A:middle
simple gestures.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:19.596 A:middle
But the best part about it is

00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:22.236 A:middle
that it feels familiar.

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:24.836 A:middle
It feels like when I was a kid

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:25.846 A:middle
channel surfing.

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:29.406 A:middle
I'm able to go back and forth

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:31.776 A:middle
until something captivates me.

00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:40.276 A:middle
So if you can use a few of these

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:41.916 A:middle
techniques and principles in

00:12:41.916 --> 00:12:44.536 A:middle
your own designs, it will make

00:12:44.536 --> 00:12:46.276 A:middle
for wonderfully thoughtful

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:47.206 A:middle
applications.

00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:53.036 A:middle
At Apple, we believe in the

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:56.326 A:middle
power of content first.

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.246 A:middle
It's what's best for the viewer.

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.246 A:middle
It's what's best for the viewer.

00:13:00.376 --> 00:13:03.996 A:middle
And collectively as we design

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:06.086 A:middle
this vehicle that delivers great

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.616 A:middle
content, that can have huge

00:13:13.276 --> 00:13:13.646 A:middle
impact.

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:17.966 A:middle
After all, TV, it has unique

00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:18.816 A:middle
abilities.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.246 A:middle
It has the ability to alter our

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:23.746 A:middle
perspective.

00:13:23.746 --> 00:13:27.936 A:middle
It has the ability to transport

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.916 A:middle
us to a different world.

00:13:30.966 --> 00:13:34.506 A:middle
And it has the ability to open

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:36.946 A:middle
our eyes to big ideas.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:42.556 A:middle
And that's the goal, isn't it?

00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.426 A:middle
To connect people to stories

00:13:45.426 --> 00:13:47.296 A:middle
that change them.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.576 A:middle
So our job as developers or

00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:52.196 A:middle
designers, it's not to make

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:53.986 A:middle
people wait in frustration, no,

00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:56.476 A:middle
it's to throw open the doors,

00:13:56.706 --> 00:13:58.956 A:middle
let them in, and let the content

00:13:59.256 --> 00:13:59.986 A:middle
shine.

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:05.176 A:middle
Because if we can do that, then

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.886 A:middle
people are more likely to stay

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:11.856 A:middle
and browse, watch something else

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.206 A:middle
and enjoy it.

00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:20.116 A:middle
And that, that will lead to a

00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:23.396 A:middle
lasting emotional connection to

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:24.606 A:middle
your product.

00:14:26.356 --> 00:14:28.956 A:middle
Next up, Caleb will talk to you

00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:30.936 A:middle
about how to take advantage of

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.726 A:middle
the content first experience in

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:34.126 A:middle
your own applications.

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:35.236 A:middle
Caleb.

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:42.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:43.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tommy.

00:14:43.326 --> 00:14:45.556 A:middle
My name is Caleb.

00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:47.096 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on the

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:48.026 A:middle
Apple TV team.

00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:50.666 A:middle
Today, I'm really excited to

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:51.826 A:middle
share with you some great

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.856 A:middle
enhancements we've made to Top

00:14:53.856 --> 00:14:56.026 A:middle
Shelf in tvOS 13.

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:02.066 A:middle
Top Shelf is the first thing a

00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:03.486 A:middle
person sees when they wake up an

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.086 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:06.866 A:middle
It gives them an easy way to

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.706 A:middle
browse content from your apps

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:11.896 A:middle
and offers a simple interaction

00:15:11.896 --> 00:15:13.176 A:middle
where they can jump directly

00:15:13.536 --> 00:15:14.196 A:middle
into playback.

00:15:17.936 --> 00:15:19.806 A:middle
This year, we wanted to update

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:21.806 A:middle
Top Shelf to take full advantage

00:15:22.116 --> 00:15:24.796 A:middle
of the biggest screen in your

00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:27.316 A:middle
house, and provide that

00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:28.826 A:middle
captivating browse experience

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.336 A:middle
that Tommy mentioned earlier.

00:15:31.676 --> 00:15:33.096 A:middle
I'm happy to share with you that

00:15:33.096 --> 00:15:34.696 A:middle
this year in tvOS 13, we're

00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:37.256 A:middle
doing that with the Carousel.

00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:42.436 A:middle
The Carousel had two important

00:15:42.436 --> 00:15:43.946 A:middle
features to Top Shelf.

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:46.336 A:middle
First, it's immersive.

00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:48.926 A:middle
Full screen image and video

00:15:48.926 --> 00:15:51.116 A:middle
content from your apps plays

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:52.276 A:middle
right on the home screen of

00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:52.856 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:56.796 A:middle
When you swipe up to enter full

00:15:56.796 --> 00:15:58.666 A:middle
screen mode, our UI gets out of

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.756 A:middle
the way, so you can lean back

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.756 A:middle
the way, so you can lean back

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.716 A:middle
and see what's on.

00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:07.116 A:middle
The Carousel is also

00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:07.786 A:middle
interactive.

00:16:08.456 --> 00:16:10.546 A:middle
Swiping between apps and between

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:12.656 A:middle
items feels like channel

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.166 A:middle
surfing.

00:16:15.076 --> 00:16:17.316 A:middle
When you select an item, you can

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.676 A:middle
see this rich meta-data you see

00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:19.266 A:middle
here at the bottom of the

00:16:19.266 --> 00:16:19.686 A:middle
screen.

00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:22.156 A:middle
We think this is the great way

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:23.426 A:middle
for you to showcase the awesome

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:24.806 A:middle
content you have inside your

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:27.436 A:middle
apps right on the home screen of

00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:28.036 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:32.736 A:middle
Now, I know that not all content

00:16:32.736 --> 00:16:35.486 A:middle
is the same and one UI style may

00:16:35.486 --> 00:16:36.876 A:middle
not work equally well for

00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:37.366 A:middle
everyone.

00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:40.946 A:middle
So we have two styles available

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:42.606 A:middle
for you in our API.

00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:47.056 A:middle
First is the Actions Carousel.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.266 A:middle
The Actions Carousel focuses

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:54.746 A:middle
primarily on that full screen

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:56.106 A:middle
image of video content provided

00:16:56.106 --> 00:16:58.136 A:middle
by your apps, and offers only a

00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:00.316 A:middle
small number of UI elements for

00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:00.316 A:middle
small number of UI elements for

00:17:00.316 --> 00:17:01.156 A:middle
you to customize.

00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:04.356 A:middle
Starting in the top-left corner,

00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:07.156 A:middle
we have the title and context

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:07.455 A:middle
title.

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.435 A:middle
These tell someone viewing your

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:11.976 A:middle
Top Shelf content what they're

00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:13.906 A:middle
looking and why you're showing

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:14.356 A:middle
it to them.

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:17.465 A:middle
You can think of the context

00:17:17.465 --> 00:17:18.636 A:middle
title like you would a section

00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:18.996 A:middle
header.

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:21.066 A:middle
It adds a logical grouping

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.165 A:middle
between items in your Top Shelf.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:28.156 A:middle
And next we have the Play and

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:29.236 A:middle
More Info buttons.

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:31.476 A:middle
These buttons gives someone

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.066 A:middle
viewing your content an explicit

00:17:33.066 --> 00:17:35.066 A:middle
way to jump directly to this

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:38.086 A:middle
item inside your application and

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:40.346 A:middle
either start playback right away

00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:42.966 A:middle
or learn more about it.

00:17:45.056 --> 00:17:46.626 A:middle
The second style we have for you

00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:48.846 A:middle
is called the Details Carousel.

00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:53.616 A:middle
And it looks like this.

00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:54.796 A:middle
You'll see some familiar UI

00:17:54.796 --> 00:17:57.286 A:middle
elements, top-left corner, our

00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:59.376 A:middle
title and context title, in the

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.606 A:middle
bottom-left are the Play and

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.606 A:middle
bottom-left are the Play and

00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:01.546 A:middle
More Info buttons.

00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:03.856 A:middle
But our API also allows you to

00:18:03.856 --> 00:18:05.486 A:middle
provide this rich meta-data you

00:18:05.486 --> 00:18:06.396 A:middle
see highlighted here.

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:10.426 A:middle
Fields like summary, genre,

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:14.626 A:middle
duration, or even a rich set of

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.206 A:middle
media options to tell someone

00:18:16.426 --> 00:18:17.716 A:middle
what the content will look like

00:18:17.716 --> 00:18:18.946 A:middle
when they play it back on their

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:19.556 A:middle
TV.

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:23.626 A:middle
It does support 4K HDR or maybe

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:24.766 A:middle
more importantly for someone

00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:25.796 A:middle
who's hearing impaired, this

00:18:25.796 --> 00:18:27.376 A:middle
does support close captions or

00:18:27.376 --> 00:18:28.396 A:middle
audio descriptions.

00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:32.856 A:middle
And on the far right, we have a

00:18:32.856 --> 00:18:34.346 A:middle
list of named attributes.

00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:36.726 A:middle
This is key value data that your

00:18:36.726 --> 00:18:38.226 A:middle
application has full control

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:38.626 A:middle
over.

00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:41.396 A:middle
In this example, we have a list

00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:42.936 A:middle
of featured actors in the

00:18:42.936 --> 00:18:44.506 A:middle
Starring section and the

00:18:44.506 --> 00:18:46.296 A:middle
director of the movie in the

00:18:46.296 --> 00:18:47.266 A:middle
Director section.

00:18:48.146 --> 00:18:49.146 A:middle
And it's really important to

00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:50.606 A:middle
remember that when you populate

00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:53.246 A:middle
these fields, you localize and

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:54.806 A:middle
pluralize them for the amount of

00:18:54.806 --> 00:18:56.146 A:middle
content you intend to display.

00:18:56.786 --> 00:19:00.076 A:middle
So that's the new Carousel.

00:18:56.786 --> 00:19:00.076 A:middle
So that's the new Carousel.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:03.616 A:middle
And when you adopt it, we have

00:19:03.616 --> 00:19:05.206 A:middle
some best practices we like you

00:19:05.206 --> 00:19:06.626 A:middle
to keep in mind.

00:19:08.956 --> 00:19:10.726 A:middle
The Carousel is best used for

00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:11.816 A:middle
content discovery.

00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:13.826 A:middle
Some good examples of that might

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:16.586 A:middle
be a featured movie, a new

00:19:16.586 --> 00:19:18.706 A:middle
season of a TV show, or

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:20.646 A:middle
personalized recommendations for

00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:21.596 A:middle
the signed in user.

00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:26.606 A:middle
It should also be updated

00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:27.276 A:middle
regularly.

00:19:27.636 --> 00:19:28.956 A:middle
This is an opportunity for you

00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:30.736 A:middle
to showcase content in the Top

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:33.216 A:middle
Shelf to draw someone into your

00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:33.976 A:middle
application.

00:19:34.236 --> 00:19:36.896 A:middle
So it needs to be fresh and feel

00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:37.906 A:middle
alive.

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:42.456 A:middle
And like Tommy said, we don't

00:19:42.456 --> 00:19:43.526 A:middle
want to overwhelm the user with

00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:44.276 A:middle
too much choice.

00:19:45.126 --> 00:19:46.706 A:middle
Too many items in the Top Shelf

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:48.166 A:middle
just adds noise and clutter.

00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:49.716 A:middle
So we think a good number to

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:50.756 A:middle
keep in mind is somewhere

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:55.376 A:middle
between 5 and 10.

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:56.936 A:middle
Next, images.

00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.796 A:middle
Like I said, content in the Top

00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:01.616 A:middle
Shelf Carousel is full screen.

00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:01.616 A:middle
Shelf Carousel is full screen.

00:20:02.306 --> 00:20:04.336 A:middle
So your images should be 1920 by

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.126 A:middle
1080 points and they should draw

00:20:06.126 --> 00:20:09.666 A:middle
in the entire frame of that

00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:11.386 A:middle
content.

00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:13.066 A:middle
And our API allows you to

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:15.156 A:middle
specify images in both 1x

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:17.856 A:middle
resolution for 1080p devices and

00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:20.146 A:middle
2x resolution for 4K devices.

00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:22.906 A:middle
This is a great way for you to

00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:24.726 A:middle
help us optimize your content

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.096 A:middle
for the best user experience in

00:20:27.096 --> 00:20:27.736 A:middle
Top Shelf.

00:20:28.256 --> 00:20:31.996 A:middle
And now, safe areas.

00:20:33.276 --> 00:20:34.446 A:middle
The standard application safe

00:20:34.446 --> 00:20:36.406 A:middle
area on tvOS looks like this.

00:20:36.476 --> 00:20:39.196 A:middle
You have 90 points of padding on

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.176 A:middle
the leading and trailing edges

00:20:40.176 --> 00:20:42.176 A:middle
of your screen and 60 points of

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.146 A:middle
padding on the top and bottom

00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:44.586 A:middle
edges.

00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:46.586 A:middle
And remember, it's OK for your

00:20:46.586 --> 00:20:48.086 A:middle
content to go outside that Safe

00:20:48.086 --> 00:20:50.456 A:middle
Area, but based on the device or

00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:52.506 A:middle
TV settings, the user may not be

00:20:52.506 --> 00:20:53.986 A:middle
able to see it or interact with

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:54.166 A:middle
it.

00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:57.396 A:middle
We have a similar safe area for

00:20:57.396 --> 00:20:58.076 A:middle
the Carousel.

00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
When you put your images in the

00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
When you put your images in the

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
Carousel, remember that they

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.836 A:middle
might show under system UI like

00:21:03.956 --> 00:21:06.426 A:middle
the chevrons, the details UI in

00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:08.606 A:middle
the bottom or even the app grid.

00:21:09.356 --> 00:21:10.556 A:middle
So, if you have things like

00:21:10.556 --> 00:21:12.586 A:middle
title art in your images, make

00:21:12.586 --> 00:21:13.536 A:middle
sure they don't conflict with

00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:14.856 A:middle
that system UI and make it hard

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:15.826 A:middle
to see or use.

00:21:16.396 --> 00:21:20.826 A:middle
And last, videos.

00:21:21.856 --> 00:21:23.656 A:middle
Like Tommy showed, you can play

00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:25.286 A:middle
videos, trailers for your

00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:27.346 A:middle
content in Top Shelf Carousel.

00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:30.156 A:middle
Those video should be 1080p high

00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:30.816 A:middle
definition.

00:21:31.856 --> 00:21:34.466 A:middle
And if possible, you should

00:21:34.466 --> 00:21:36.776 A:middle
deliver them to us using HTTP

00:21:36.776 --> 00:21:38.666 A:middle
Live Streaming or HLS.

00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:41.296 A:middle
This is another way for you to

00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:43.166 A:middle
help us optimize your content

00:21:43.296 --> 00:21:44.756 A:middle
for the best user experience in

00:21:44.756 --> 00:21:45.276 A:middle
Top Shelf.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.166 A:middle
Those videos should be fast to

00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:48.866 A:middle
load and we should be able to

00:21:48.866 --> 00:21:50.286 A:middle
optimize them for the users'

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:51.246 A:middle
available bandwidth.

00:21:54.576 --> 00:21:56.266 A:middle
And like I mentioned earlier,

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:57.456 A:middle
the Carousel is a great place

00:21:57.456 --> 00:21:59.206 A:middle
for you to preview your content.

00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:01.056 A:middle
We don't want you offering a

00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:01.056 A:middle
We don't want you offering a

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.816 A:middle
full-length viewing experience

00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
in the Carousel.

00:22:05.656 --> 00:22:07.156 A:middle
So we think an appropriate

00:22:07.156 --> 00:22:08.666 A:middle
amount of time for your videos

00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:10.236 A:middle
is around 2 to 5 minutes.

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:14.296 A:middle
And we encourage you to include

00:22:14.296 --> 00:22:15.966 A:middle
audio in your videos.

00:22:16.076 --> 00:22:17.536 A:middle
We will make sure the audio only

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:19.376 A:middle
plays at the appropriate time.

00:22:19.956 --> 00:22:21.966 A:middle
That means on explicit user

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:22.426 A:middle
action.

00:22:26.036 --> 00:22:27.926 A:middle
So now, we have four UI styles

00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:30.166 A:middle
available for you in Top Shelf,

00:22:30.296 --> 00:22:32.986 A:middle
starting with Carousel Actions,

00:22:34.696 --> 00:22:38.166 A:middle
the Details Carousel, and

00:22:38.646 --> 00:22:41.886 A:middle
Sectioned, and Inset Content.

00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:45.466 A:middle
And remember if your content

00:22:45.536 --> 00:22:47.356 A:middle
doesn't work in the Carousel, if

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:49.096 A:middle
you don't have full screen art

00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:50.946 A:middle
or video, that's OK.

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:53.016 A:middle
We still encourage you to use

00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:54.306 A:middle
the Sectioned and Inset Content

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:55.576 A:middle
styles to provide that

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:57.486 A:middle
lightweight, easy to browse

00:22:57.766 --> 00:22:59.716 A:middle
content experience in a Top

00:23:00.406 --> 00:23:00.546 A:middle
Shelf.

00:23:02.656 --> 00:23:04.006 A:middle
So that's an overview of the UI

00:23:04.006 --> 00:23:05.746 A:middle
and a little bit about how it

00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:06.086 A:middle
works.

00:23:07.046 --> 00:23:08.396 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how you

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:09.026 A:middle
build one of these.

00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:11.586 A:middle
You'll do that with a Top Shelf

00:23:11.586 --> 00:23:12.246 A:middle
Extension.

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:14.566 A:middle
This year, we have an all new

00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:16.246 A:middle
extension and API that makes

00:23:16.246 --> 00:23:18.716 A:middle
adopting Top Shelf easier than

00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:19.566 A:middle
ever.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:22.416 A:middle
You'll start by adding a new Top

00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:24.186 A:middle
Shelf Extension target to your

00:23:24.186 --> 00:23:25.986 A:middle
application in Xcode.

00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:28.756 A:middle
And that will grant you access

00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:31.056 A:middle
to the Carousel as well as our

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:31.626 A:middle
new API.

00:23:33.046 --> 00:23:34.376 A:middle
So now I'm going go over in

00:23:34.376 --> 00:23:36.136 A:middle
three major parts briefly,

00:23:37.456 --> 00:23:38.866 A:middle
starting at the top with

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:40.616 A:middle
TVTopShelfContentProvider.

00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:43.156 A:middle
This is the root object of your

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:45.096 A:middle
extension and responsible for

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:46.486 A:middle
responding to system requests

00:23:46.486 --> 00:23:47.396 A:middle
for Top Shelf data.

00:23:47.996 --> 00:23:50.776 A:middle
Our new API makes fetching your

00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:51.786 A:middle
content and responding

00:23:51.786 --> 00:23:54.296 A:middle
asynchronously really easy.

00:23:55.696 --> 00:23:58.396 A:middle
Next is TVTopShelfContent.

00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:00.796 A:middle
This is a protocol you won't

00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:00.796 A:middle
This is a protocol you won't

00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:01.766 A:middle
really interact with much

00:24:01.766 --> 00:24:02.316 A:middle
directly.

00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:03.986 A:middle
We provide three concrete

00:24:03.986 --> 00:24:05.796 A:middle
classes for you, one for each of

00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:07.256 A:middle
the three major UI styles,

00:24:08.096 --> 00:24:10.936 A:middle
Carousel, Sectioned, and Inset.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:13.516 A:middle
And each of these classes has

00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:15.506 A:middle
properties that are distinct for

00:24:15.506 --> 00:24:16.506 A:middle
each UI style.

00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:19.536 A:middle
And last, we have

00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:20.686 A:middle
TVTopShelfItem.

00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:23.406 A:middle
Similar to the content classes,

00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:24.826 A:middle
we have different classes for

00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:26.246 A:middle
each content style that have

00:24:26.386 --> 00:24:28.326 A:middle
varying properties for each UI

00:24:28.326 --> 00:24:28.706 A:middle
style.

00:24:29.976 --> 00:24:32.186 A:middle
Carousel, Item Collection, and

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:33.196 A:middle
Sectioned Item for showing

00:24:33.196 --> 00:24:35.546 A:middle
Sectioned Content, and Content

00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:36.846 A:middle
Item has enough properties to

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:38.106 A:middle
show Inset Content.

00:24:38.606 --> 00:24:41.056 A:middle
So now instead of going into any

00:24:41.056 --> 00:24:42.726 A:middle
more code, I think it's more fun

00:24:42.726 --> 00:24:44.116 A:middle
if we do a demo and see how this

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:44.566 A:middle
all works.

00:24:44.736 --> 00:24:45.586 A:middle
So I invite my colleague,

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.846 A:middle
Felipe, to the stage and help me

00:24:48.646 --> 00:24:48.726 A:middle
out.

00:24:48.996 --> 00:24:49.316 A:middle
Felipe?

00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:54.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.116 A:middle
So like I said the first step

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.116 A:middle
So like I said the first step

00:25:01.216 --> 00:25:02.466 A:middle
would be to add a new Top Shelf

00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:03.976 A:middle
Extension target to our project

00:25:03.976 --> 00:25:04.636 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:06.646 A:middle
So we'll start by adding a new

00:25:06.646 --> 00:25:07.036 A:middle
target.

00:25:08.036 --> 00:25:09.576 A:middle
And on the tvOS tab, we'll

00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:11.846 A:middle
select TV Top Shelf Extension.

00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:16.266 A:middle
We'll give it a name and make

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
sure the Embed in Application

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:18.896 A:middle
pop-up is set to the correct

00:25:18.896 --> 00:25:19.236 A:middle
value.

00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:22.296 A:middle
In this case we already have an

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:23.296 A:middle
extension in our project with

00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:24.566 A:middle
some supporting files, so we'll

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:26.496 A:middle
skip this for now and go right

00:25:26.496 --> 00:25:27.426 A:middle
to our ContentProvider.

00:25:27.486 --> 00:25:30.726 A:middle
This is what it will look like

00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:31.746 A:middle
when you add a new Top Shelf

00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:32.846 A:middle
Extension to your project.

00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.466 A:middle
In the ContentProvider class,

00:25:35.556 --> 00:25:36.346 A:middle
the subclasses,

00:25:36.686 --> 00:25:38.696 A:middle
TVTopShelfContentProvider and

00:25:38.696 --> 00:25:40.516 A:middle
implements loadTopShelfContent,

00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:42.036 A:middle
it takes the completionHandler.

00:25:42.606 --> 00:25:44.566 A:middle
Right now we're calling that

00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:45.886 A:middle
with nil, which just means we

00:25:45.886 --> 00:25:46.906 A:middle
don't have anything to display

00:25:46.906 --> 00:25:47.476 A:middle
at the moment.

00:25:47.476 --> 00:25:48.836 A:middle
So, let's replace that with some

00:25:48.836 --> 00:25:49.406 A:middle
real content.

00:25:54.556 --> 00:25:56.326 A:middle
Here, we're fetching a list of

00:25:56.326 --> 00:25:57.606 A:middle
featured movies from

00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:59.506 A:middle
MoviesClient, and it responds

00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:01.426 A:middle
asynchronously with a result of

00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:01.426 A:middle
asynchronously with a result of

00:26:01.586 --> 00:26:03.846 A:middle
either a movies response or an

00:26:03.846 --> 00:26:04.126 A:middle
error.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:05.766 A:middle
So let's fill out each of those

00:26:05.766 --> 00:26:07.206 A:middle
cases with some real content

00:26:07.286 --> 00:26:08.356 A:middle
starting with success.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:10.676 A:middle
Here, we'll call

00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:11.766 A:middle
completionHandler with a real

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:12.436 A:middle
model object.

00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:15.136 A:middle
And in the case of an error, we

00:26:15.136 --> 00:26:15.766 A:middle
still want to call the

00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:17.106 A:middle
completionHandler with nil to

00:26:17.106 --> 00:26:18.236 A:middle
tell the system we don't have

00:26:18.236 --> 00:26:19.896 A:middle
any more work to do right now.

00:26:21.036 --> 00:26:23.216 A:middle
Great. Let's go add some

00:26:23.216 --> 00:26:24.486 A:middle
extensions to our models that

00:26:24.486 --> 00:26:26.086 A:middle
let us fill out that rich Top

00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:26.706 A:middle
Shelf content.

00:26:27.206 --> 00:26:31.146 A:middle
Here we have two extensions,

00:26:31.146 --> 00:26:32.996 A:middle
one, on our Movie object that

00:26:32.996 --> 00:26:34.836 A:middle
knows how to return a Top Shelf

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:35.886 A:middle
sectioned item.

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:38.256 A:middle
And one on our MoviesResponse

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.606 A:middle
that knows how to take all those

00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:41.226 A:middle
items and bundle them into a

00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:42.356 A:middle
sectioned content object.

00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:43.966 A:middle
Here, it has a title called

00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:45.486 A:middle
Featured Movies and a list of

00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:45.996 A:middle
items.

00:26:46.516 --> 00:26:48.966 A:middle
And our item class is kind of

00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:49.376 A:middle
boring.

00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:50.746 A:middle
We only have a title right now.

00:26:50.986 --> 00:26:52.176 A:middle
So let's add some more

00:26:52.176 --> 00:26:55.016 A:middle
properties starting with images.

00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:58.356 A:middle
Our API, like I said, allows you

00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
to specify images for both 1x

00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
to specify images for both 1x

00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:02.426 A:middle
and 2x screen scales.

00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:03.766 A:middle
So here we're doing that and

00:27:03.766 --> 00:27:04.946 A:middle
we're also setting the image

00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:06.886 A:middle
shape to HDTV, which means we

00:27:06.886 --> 00:27:08.656 A:middle
want 16 by 9 tiles in our

00:27:08.656 --> 00:27:09.606 A:middle
Sectioned Top Shelf.

00:27:10.106 --> 00:27:12.736 A:middle
Now we need to handle user

00:27:12.736 --> 00:27:13.416 A:middle
actions.

00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:14.276 A:middle
What happened from the user

00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:15.356 A:middle
interacts with our item in Top

00:27:15.356 --> 00:27:15.736 A:middle
Shelf?

00:27:16.496 --> 00:27:17.786 A:middle
Starting with displayAction.

00:27:18.356 --> 00:27:19.146 A:middle
This is what happens when the

00:27:19.146 --> 00:27:20.706 A:middle
user selects your item when it's

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:21.856 A:middle
focused in Top Shelf.

00:27:22.376 --> 00:27:24.166 A:middle
And playAction is what happens

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:25.356 A:middle
when the user presses the play

00:27:25.356 --> 00:27:27.196 A:middle
button on the Siri Remote again

00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:28.166 A:middle
while the item is focused.

00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.966 A:middle
This will be delivered to your

00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:32.296 A:middle
application through its open URL

00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:34.006 A:middle
handler and it's important that

00:27:34.006 --> 00:27:35.526 A:middle
you take them directly to this

00:27:35.526 --> 00:27:36.896 A:middle
content as soon as possible.

00:27:38.386 --> 00:27:38.936 A:middle
That's it.

00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:40.426 A:middle
Let's run this and see how it

00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:40.726 A:middle
looks.

00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:50.086 A:middle
Fantastic.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:52.526 A:middle
If you have an extension today

00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:54.356 A:middle
that uses Top Shelf, this is

00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:55.276 A:middle
probably what it looks like.

00:27:55.916 --> 00:27:56.826 A:middle
We have Sectioned title.

00:27:56.826 --> 00:27:58.686 A:middle
When we focus around, we can see

00:27:58.686 --> 00:27:59.906 A:middle
the title of each item shows

00:27:59.906 --> 00:28:01.046 A:middle
underneath.

00:27:59.906 --> 00:28:01.046 A:middle
underneath.

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:03.006 A:middle
But we really want to use that

00:28:03.006 --> 00:28:05.416 A:middle
new immersive browse experience

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.156 A:middle
in Top Shelf.

00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:08.136 A:middle
So let's go back to Xcode and

00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:08.886 A:middle
see what changes we have to

00:28:08.886 --> 00:28:09.116 A:middle
make.

00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:12.756 A:middle
The first thing we'll need is to

00:28:12.756 --> 00:28:14.136 A:middle
change our makeTopShelfItem

00:28:14.136 --> 00:28:16.096 A:middle
function to return a TV Top

00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.976 A:middle
Shelf Carousel item instead.

00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:26.986 A:middle
And right away the compiler will

00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:28.646 A:middle
help us and tell us the image

00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:29.646 A:middle
shape isn't really valid

00:28:29.646 --> 00:28:30.026 A:middle
anymore.

00:28:30.106 --> 00:28:31.216 A:middle
So let's get rid of that line.

00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:33.636 A:middle
Now we need only to add two more

00:28:33.636 --> 00:28:35.066 A:middle
properties to fill out the rest

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:36.646 A:middle
of our Carousel content.

00:28:37.836 --> 00:28:39.886 A:middle
First is the Context Title,

00:28:40.096 --> 00:28:41.276 A:middle
again, that Section Header that

00:28:41.276 --> 00:28:42.086 A:middle
tells the user what we're

00:28:42.086 --> 00:28:42.576 A:middle
looking at.

00:28:43.776 --> 00:28:46.166 A:middle
And the previewVideoURL, that's

00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:47.646 A:middle
what plays after we transition

00:28:47.646 --> 00:28:49.026 A:middle
away from your image content.

00:28:49.536 --> 00:28:53.706 A:middle
And last, we need to update our

00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:55.256 A:middle
makeTopShelfContent function to

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:55.726 A:middle
return a

00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:57.846 A:middle
TVTopShelfCarouselContent to

00:28:57.846 --> 00:28:58.906 A:middle
match our Carousel item.

00:28:59.536 --> 00:29:02.126 A:middle
Here, we're requesting the

00:28:59.536 --> 00:29:02.126 A:middle
Here, we're requesting the

00:29:02.186 --> 00:29:03.616 A:middle
Action Style Carousel.

00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:07.976 A:middle
Great. Let's run this again.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:21.956 A:middle
Awesome. Look how great that

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:22.396 A:middle
looks!

00:29:22.796 --> 00:29:24.676 A:middle
We went from little Inset boxes

00:29:24.756 --> 00:29:27.366 A:middle
of static content to this big

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:28.546 A:middle
full screen playing preview

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:29.586 A:middle
video of our content.

00:29:30.486 --> 00:29:31.726 A:middle
When Felipe swipes up to enter

00:29:31.726 --> 00:29:33.206 A:middle
full screen mode, our UI gets

00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:34.906 A:middle
out of the way and he can swipe

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.566 A:middle
between items to see what else

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:37.826 A:middle
there is in our Top Shelf.

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:40.146 A:middle
When he presses menu, we'll go

00:29:40.146 --> 00:29:42.196 A:middle
back to the up grid right where

00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:42.896 A:middle
we left off.

00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:44.876 A:middle
Now, let's go back to our

00:29:44.876 --> 00:29:45.926 A:middle
project and make one more

00:29:45.926 --> 00:29:46.566 A:middle
change.

00:29:47.526 --> 00:29:48.456 A:middle
We want to take advantage of

00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:50.236 A:middle
that full rich meta-data that

00:29:50.236 --> 00:29:51.596 A:middle
Top Shelf API offers.

00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:53.026 A:middle
So we'll add a few more

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:54.566 A:middle
properties to our item class.

00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:57.466 A:middle
Like I mentioned, these are

00:29:57.466 --> 00:29:59.506 A:middle
fields like summary, genre,

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:01.906 A:middle
media options.

00:30:02.046 --> 00:30:03.446 A:middle
This just describes more

00:30:03.446 --> 00:30:04.836 A:middle
contexts about the item we're

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.006 A:middle
looking at to our viewers.

00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:09.016 A:middle
And last, let's update our

00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.636 A:middle
content object to return a

00:30:10.636 --> 00:30:12.376 A:middle
detail style Carousel.

00:30:12.926 --> 00:30:15.756 A:middle
Let's run this one more time.

00:30:20.636 --> 00:30:21.866 A:middle
So you'll notice that we only

00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:23.836 A:middle
changed a few classes and added

00:30:23.836 --> 00:30:25.296 A:middle
a few properties to go all the

00:30:25.296 --> 00:30:26.706 A:middle
way from Sectioned Content to

00:30:26.706 --> 00:30:28.646 A:middle
this dynamic, immersive browse

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:29.306 A:middle
experience.

00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:31.266 A:middle
When Felipe swiped up to enter

00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.176 A:middle
full screen, you'll and notice

00:30:32.176 --> 00:30:33.036 A:middle
that we don't show that

00:30:33.036 --> 00:30:34.336 A:middle
meta-data UI right away.

00:30:34.386 --> 00:30:35.206 A:middle
We don't want to overwhelm the

00:30:35.206 --> 00:30:36.546 A:middle
user with too much information

00:30:36.546 --> 00:30:37.266 A:middle
all at once.

00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:39.346 A:middle
So it's available on demand when

00:30:39.346 --> 00:30:41.096 A:middle
he taps or clicks the Siri

00:30:41.096 --> 00:30:41.406 A:middle
Remote.

00:30:42.756 --> 00:30:43.566 A:middle
In here, you see all the

00:30:43.566 --> 00:30:45.046 A:middle
information we filled out just a

00:30:45.046 --> 00:30:45.566 A:middle
moment ago.

00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:46.936 A:middle
That's it.

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:49.296 A:middle
That's all it takes to adopt Top

00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:50.846 A:middle
Shelf in your apps.

00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:51.516 A:middle
Thanks, Felipe.

00:30:52.516 --> 00:30:57.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:58.196 --> 00:31:00.206 A:middle
So you saw how easy that was to

00:30:58.196 --> 00:31:00.206 A:middle
So you saw how easy that was to

00:31:01.516 --> 00:31:03.376 A:middle
provide a great browse

00:31:03.376 --> 00:31:05.586 A:middle
experience in Top Shelf on Apple

00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:06.316 A:middle
TV.

00:31:07.436 --> 00:31:10.266 A:middle
And you saw the Carousel and how

00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:11.876 A:middle
it lets you go from a static

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:15.046 A:middle
inset Top Shelf content to this

00:31:15.046 --> 00:31:17.516 A:middle
big exciting captivating browse

00:31:17.516 --> 00:31:18.196 A:middle
experience.

00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:20.966 A:middle
And, you saw the new extension

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:22.556 A:middle
and API, which makes adopting

00:31:22.556 --> 00:31:24.146 A:middle
all of this easier than ever.

00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:26.406 A:middle
We can't wait to see what all of

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.376 A:middle
you do with Top Shelf in tvOS

00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:29.016 A:middle
13.

00:31:30.116 --> 00:31:31.076 A:middle
Now, I'd like to hand it over to

00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:32.636 A:middle
Dale to talk about bringing that

00:31:32.636 --> 00:31:34.546 A:middle
content first design principles

00:31:34.866 --> 00:31:36.426 A:middle
inside your application.

00:31:37.376 --> 00:31:37.576 A:middle
Dale.

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:40.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:42.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Caleb.

00:31:46.596 --> 00:31:48.016 A:middle
My name is Dale Taylor and I'm

00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:49.336 A:middle
an engineer on the tvOS team.

00:31:49.506 --> 00:31:50.946 A:middle
I'm going to start off today by

00:31:50.946 --> 00:31:51.996 A:middle
talking to you about User

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:53.756 A:middle
Profiles and how you can use

00:31:53.756 --> 00:31:55.016 A:middle
them to show people the content

00:31:55.016 --> 00:31:57.446 A:middle
that they really want to see.

00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
In tvOS 13, we're bringing

00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
In tvOS 13, we're bringing

00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:03.086 A:middle
Control Center to the TV.

00:32:03.306 --> 00:32:04.806 A:middle
It gives people quick access to

00:32:04.806 --> 00:32:06.666 A:middle
common used actions, such as

00:32:06.666 --> 00:32:08.656 A:middle
Sleep, Search, and Now Playing.

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.266 A:middle
Additionally, we've added user

00:32:10.266 --> 00:32:11.446 A:middle
switching right up at the top.

00:32:12.366 --> 00:32:14.026 A:middle
This gives people a lightweight

00:32:14.026 --> 00:32:15.456 A:middle
way to quickly switch to their

00:32:15.456 --> 00:32:16.496 A:middle
personalized content and

00:32:16.496 --> 00:32:18.326 A:middle
recommendations all without

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:19.186 A:middle
losing context.

00:32:19.976 --> 00:32:20.756 A:middle
We're opening up this

00:32:20.756 --> 00:32:22.536 A:middle
functionality to developers so

00:32:22.536 --> 00:32:23.756 A:middle
you too can take advantage of

00:32:23.756 --> 00:32:24.926 A:middle
multiuser in your apps.

00:32:25.296 --> 00:32:26.526 A:middle
Let me show you what this looks

00:32:26.526 --> 00:32:26.766 A:middle
like.

00:32:27.036 --> 00:32:27.966 A:middle
I'll start with an example.

00:32:29.636 --> 00:32:31.916 A:middle
How many of you had sat down to

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:33.966 A:middle
watch TV only to be presented

00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:34.786 A:middle
with something that looks like

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.246 A:middle
this?

00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:37.106 A:middle
Well, we want to make that a

00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:37.856 A:middle
thing of the past.

00:32:38.586 --> 00:32:39.906 A:middle
While we're glad that your apps

00:32:39.906 --> 00:32:41.226 A:middle
are providing great personalized

00:32:41.226 --> 00:32:43.496 A:middle
recommendations, ultimately, a

00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:45.586 A:middle
screen like this isn't a content

00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:46.596 A:middle
first experience.

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:48.516 A:middle
It can be especially frustrating

00:32:48.516 --> 00:32:50.896 A:middle
because in tvOS 13, the Apple TV

00:32:50.896 --> 00:32:51.856 A:middle
already knows who you are.

00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:53.956 A:middle
So why is it asking again?

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:55.906 A:middle
Let's take a look at what we're

00:32:55.906 --> 00:32:56.606 A:middle
doing to help you.

00:32:57.196 --> 00:33:00.346 A:middle
We have new API and TV services

00:32:57.196 --> 00:33:00.346 A:middle
We have new API and TV services

00:33:00.346 --> 00:33:03.376 A:middle
in tvOS 13, TVUserManager to

00:33:03.376 --> 00:33:04.746 A:middle
help your profile-based apps

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:05.896 A:middle
integrate with multiuser.

00:33:06.666 --> 00:33:07.776 A:middle
We do a few things for you.

00:33:08.566 --> 00:33:10.456 A:middle
We supply you an identifier that

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:11.866 A:middle
represents the current user on

00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:13.626 A:middle
the TV, and we'll let you know

00:33:13.626 --> 00:33:14.806 A:middle
when that identifier changes.

00:33:15.536 --> 00:33:16.806 A:middle
This is important because with

00:33:16.806 --> 00:33:18.476 A:middle
Control Center, that can happen

00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:19.416 A:middle
even when your apps in the

00:33:19.496 --> 00:33:19.996 A:middle
foreground.

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:22.596 A:middle
We even supply you some system

00:33:22.596 --> 00:33:24.376 A:middle
UI to help people using your app

00:33:24.446 --> 00:33:26.266 A:middle
map between our user identifiers

00:33:26.616 --> 00:33:27.916 A:middle
and your app's profiles.

00:33:29.546 --> 00:33:30.586 A:middle
So what do you have to do to

00:33:30.586 --> 00:33:31.916 A:middle
integrate with TVUserManager?

00:33:33.326 --> 00:33:35.306 A:middle
Most importantly, you're

00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:36.776 A:middle
responsible for mapping between

00:33:36.776 --> 00:33:38.516 A:middle
a user identifier and a profile

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.666 A:middle
in your app.

00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:40.956 A:middle
Generally, you would want to

00:33:40.956 --> 00:33:41.776 A:middle
store this in your user

00:33:41.776 --> 00:33:43.416 A:middle
defaults, mapping each user

00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:45.016 A:middle
identifier to a profile.

00:33:45.626 --> 00:33:46.886 A:middle
It's perfectly acceptable to

00:33:46.886 --> 00:33:48.406 A:middle
have multiple user identifiers

00:33:48.406 --> 00:33:49.686 A:middle
map to a single profile.

00:33:50.296 --> 00:33:52.306 A:middle
What this means is that you can

00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:54.036 A:middle
have multiple users on a TV and

00:33:54.036 --> 00:33:55.256 A:middle
they can share the same profile

00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:56.996 A:middle
in an app.

00:33:56.996 --> 00:33:58.426 A:middle
And these user identifiers will

00:33:58.426 --> 00:33:59.766 A:middle
be unique for every developer

00:33:59.766 --> 00:34:00.066 A:middle
team.

00:33:59.766 --> 00:34:00.066 A:middle
team.

00:34:00.436 --> 00:34:02.216 A:middle
So if you have multiple apps or

00:34:02.216 --> 00:34:03.786 A:middle
extensions in your suite, you

00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:04.516 A:middle
can all share the same

00:34:04.516 --> 00:34:05.166 A:middle
preferences.

00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:07.566 A:middle
You're also responsible for

00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:08.795 A:middle
listening for changes in the

00:34:08.795 --> 00:34:09.926 A:middle
current user identifier.

00:34:09.926 --> 00:34:11.735 A:middle
I'll get into some best

00:34:11.735 --> 00:34:14.085 A:middle
practices on how to handle that

00:34:14.696 --> 00:34:14.835 A:middle
later.

00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:16.346 A:middle
It's also up to your apps to

00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:17.636 A:middle
call the methods you have to

00:34:17.636 --> 00:34:19.146 A:middle
present system UI in a way that

00:34:19.146 --> 00:34:20.166 A:middle
makes sense for your app's

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:20.676 A:middle
workflow.

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:22.606 A:middle
But everyone's app is a little

00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:22.956 A:middle
different.

00:34:23.025 --> 00:34:24.186 A:middle
So let's take a look at an

00:34:24.186 --> 00:34:24.626 A:middle
example.

00:34:25.656 --> 00:34:27.295 A:middle
Imagine your app puts up a

00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:28.706 A:middle
profile picker just like the one

00:34:28.706 --> 00:34:29.616 A:middle
I showed you before when it

00:34:29.616 --> 00:34:29.956 A:middle
launches.

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:33.826 A:middle
Well, here's what you do, before

00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:35.235 A:middle
you even put up your profile

00:34:35.235 --> 00:34:36.606 A:middle
picker, you check to see if your

00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:38.166 A:middle
app has a profile associated

00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:38.835 A:middle
with the current user

00:34:38.835 --> 00:34:39.426 A:middle
identifier.

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:41.496 A:middle
If it does, you can provide

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:42.735 A:middle
people with the absolute best

00:34:42.735 --> 00:34:43.406 A:middle
experience.

00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:45.936 A:middle
You can just let them watch TV.

00:34:46.516 --> 00:34:47.426 A:middle
You don't have to ask them any

00:34:47.426 --> 00:34:48.036 A:middle
questions.

00:34:48.176 --> 00:34:48.985 A:middle
You don't have to show them any

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:49.746 A:middle
selection screens.

00:34:49.746 --> 00:34:51.166 A:middle
You can just bring them right to

00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:51.716 A:middle
their content.

00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:54.646 A:middle
If you don't have a profile

00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:55.585 A:middle
saved for the current user

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:57.296 A:middle
identifier, now is when you put

00:34:57.296 --> 00:34:58.446 A:middle
up your app's profile picker.

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:00.326 A:middle
But when someone makes a

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:00.326 A:middle
But when someone makes a

00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:02.006 A:middle
selection, you can ask them if

00:35:02.046 --> 00:35:03.276 A:middle
this is the right profile for

00:35:03.276 --> 00:35:04.666 A:middle
the current user with this

00:35:04.666 --> 00:35:05.176 A:middle
dialogue.

00:35:06.236 --> 00:35:07.866 A:middle
This is the UI that will put up

00:35:07.986 --> 00:35:09.566 A:middle
asking the person using your app

00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:10.566 A:middle
if they want to associate the

00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:12.146 A:middle
current user identifier with the

00:35:12.146 --> 00:35:13.416 A:middle
profile that was just selected.

00:35:14.146 --> 00:35:15.626 A:middle
If they say yes and you save the

00:35:15.626 --> 00:35:16.966 A:middle
result, they won't have to be

00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.046 A:middle
asked the next time.

00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:19.176 A:middle
So they can have the best

00:35:19.526 --> 00:35:20.636 A:middle
experience when they launch the

00:35:20.636 --> 00:35:21.426 A:middle
app the next time.

00:35:22.276 --> 00:35:23.516 A:middle
So how do you put this UI on

00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:23.936 A:middle
screen?

00:35:24.736 --> 00:35:25.106 A:middle
It's easy.

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:26.556 A:middle
You can do that with

00:35:26.556 --> 00:35:27.386 A:middle
shouldStorePreference

00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:28.106 A:middle
ForCurrentUser.

00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:31.096 A:middle
And you can also let people

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:32.516 A:middle
modify these mappings after the

00:35:32.556 --> 00:35:33.676 A:middle
fact with the Preference Panel.

00:35:34.316 --> 00:35:35.236 A:middle
You can present that with

00:35:35.336 --> 00:35:36.706 A:middle
presentProfilePreferencePanel.

00:35:37.006 --> 00:35:38.446 A:middle
That UI looks like this.

00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:40.586 A:middle
In this dialogue, you provide

00:35:40.586 --> 00:35:42.176 A:middle
the current mapping between user

00:35:42.176 --> 00:35:44.346 A:middle
identifiers and profiles, and

00:35:44.346 --> 00:35:45.716 A:middle
we'll give you back the changes.

00:35:46.296 --> 00:35:47.806 A:middle
For both this UI and the

00:35:47.806 --> 00:35:49.426 A:middle
confirmation dialogue, you

00:35:49.426 --> 00:35:51.676 A:middle
provide usernames and user

00:35:51.676 --> 00:35:53.206 A:middle
identifiers and we'll supply the

00:35:53.206 --> 00:35:56.126 A:middle
real user names in the UI.

00:35:56.406 --> 00:35:57.816 A:middle
So, like I mentioned before,

00:35:57.816 --> 00:35:58.556 A:middle
your app should be able to

00:35:58.556 --> 00:35:59.756 A:middle
handle updates in the current

00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:00.536 A:middle
user identifier.

00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:00.536 A:middle
user identifier.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.606 A:middle
You listen for changes in the

00:36:02.606 --> 00:36:03.886 A:middle
current user identifier with the

00:36:03.886 --> 00:36:04.976 A:middle
currentUserIdentifier

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:06.146 A:middle
DidChangeNotification.

00:36:06.936 --> 00:36:08.486 A:middle
And when this happens, you're

00:36:08.486 --> 00:36:09.586 A:middle
responsible for letting us know

00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:11.486 A:middle
the new mapping by setting user

00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:13.126 A:middle
identifiers for current profile.

00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:15.886 A:middle
Since there can be multiple user

00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:17.256 A:middle
identifiers pointing to the same

00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:18.816 A:middle
profile, you may set multiple

00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:19.406 A:middle
values here.

00:36:19.896 --> 00:36:21.216 A:middle
So that's one thing you should

00:36:21.216 --> 00:36:22.246 A:middle
do when the user identifier

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:22.716 A:middle
changes.

00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:24.706 A:middle
What else?

00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:25.736 A:middle
Well, we have some best

00:36:25.736 --> 00:36:27.416 A:middle
practices that we recommend for

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:28.496 A:middle
dealing with profiles in your

00:36:29.476 --> 00:36:29.576 A:middle
apps.

00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:31.686 A:middle
If you have to change the

00:36:31.686 --> 00:36:33.346 A:middle
profile and the previous profile

00:36:33.346 --> 00:36:35.506 A:middle
had ongoing activity, save it

00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:36.666 A:middle
because no one wants to lose

00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:37.166 A:middle
what they're doing.

00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:39.786 A:middle
And you should also make sure

00:36:39.786 --> 00:36:41.426 A:middle
that the change is meaningful.

00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:43.046 A:middle
So if-- You should be showing

00:36:43.046 --> 00:36:43.926 A:middle
things like personalized

00:36:43.926 --> 00:36:45.856 A:middle
recommendations, and make the

00:36:45.856 --> 00:36:46.536 A:middle
change clear.

00:36:46.906 --> 00:36:48.296 A:middle
So have it have a smooth

00:36:48.296 --> 00:36:50.146 A:middle
transition and that will make it

00:36:50.146 --> 00:36:51.756 A:middle
clear to people that the change

00:36:51.756 --> 00:36:52.346 A:middle
was successful.

00:36:55.276 --> 00:36:57.216 A:middle
So what do we learn about user

00:36:57.216 --> 00:36:58.426 A:middle
profiles today on tvOS?

00:36:58.946 --> 00:36:59.916 A:middle
We learned that if you have a

00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:01.616 A:middle
profile-based app, you can take

00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:01.616 A:middle
profile-based app, you can take

00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:03.026 A:middle
advantage of multiuser to get

00:37:03.026 --> 00:37:04.666 A:middle
people better personalization.

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:07.886 A:middle
And you can use TVUserManager to

00:37:07.886 --> 00:37:08.886 A:middle
launch your app to a content

00:37:08.956 --> 00:37:10.516 A:middle
first experience, where people

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:12.116 A:middle
can skip unnecessary dialogues

00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:13.716 A:middle
and go straight to watching TV.

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:16.146 A:middle
So now that I've talked about

00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:17.516 A:middle
your first launch experience,

00:37:18.006 --> 00:37:19.366 A:middle
let's talk about what you'll see

00:37:19.366 --> 00:37:20.756 A:middle
next in your app, the Tab Bar.

00:37:28.936 --> 00:37:30.366 A:middle
With the new TV app, we

00:37:30.366 --> 00:37:31.456 A:middle
introduce a new Tab Bar.

00:37:31.776 --> 00:37:33.346 A:middle
It makes navigation easy.

00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:34.956 A:middle
And it really lets the content

00:37:34.956 --> 00:37:35.916 A:middle
behind it shine.

00:37:37.816 --> 00:37:39.386 A:middle
Because it moves along

00:37:39.386 --> 00:37:40.446 A:middle
vertically with the content

00:37:40.546 --> 00:37:41.986 A:middle
rather than disappearing when it

00:37:41.986 --> 00:37:44.066 A:middle
loses focus, it's a great way to

00:37:44.066 --> 00:37:45.326 A:middle
reinforce hierarchy for people

00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:45.876 A:middle
using an app.

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:48.286 A:middle
I'm pleased to announce in tvOS

00:37:48.286 --> 00:37:50.126 A:middle
13, everyone gets this new Tab

00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:50.936 A:middle
Bar style.

00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:55.796 A:middle
So what do you have to do to

00:37:55.796 --> 00:37:56.796 A:middle
adopt the new Tab Bar?

00:37:57.226 --> 00:37:59.026 A:middle
In most cases nothing, but

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.066 A:middle
sometimes you'll want to modify

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.066 A:middle
sometimes you'll want to modify

00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:01.296 A:middle
the behavior and here's how.

00:38:02.036 --> 00:38:03.286 A:middle
If you want the Tab Bar to

00:38:03.286 --> 00:38:04.666 A:middle
scroll along with the content on

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:05.996 A:middle
your screen, you can set the

00:38:05.996 --> 00:38:07.076 A:middle
tabBarObservedScrollView

00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:08.686 A:middle
property on your view controller

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:09.796 A:middle
embedded within your Tab Bar

00:38:09.796 --> 00:38:10.266 A:middle
controller.

00:38:10.986 --> 00:38:11.926 A:middle
We generally recommend this

00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:13.136 A:middle
style for collection views full

00:38:13.136 --> 00:38:14.066 A:middle
of browsable content.

00:38:14.306 --> 00:38:15.566 A:middle
In fact, UI Collection View

00:38:15.566 --> 00:38:16.596 A:middle
Controller does this for you

00:38:16.596 --> 00:38:17.266 A:middle
automatically.

00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:19.526 A:middle
If you'd like the Tab Bar to

00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:20.546 A:middle
stay fixed at the top of the

00:38:20.546 --> 00:38:21.746 A:middle
screen, you can just leave this

00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:22.636 A:middle
property nil.

00:38:23.716 --> 00:38:25.586 A:middle
In either of these cases, you

00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:26.646 A:middle
should be mindful of the safe

00:38:26.646 --> 00:38:26.936 A:middle
area.

00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:28.596 A:middle
For scroll views, you'll get the

00:38:28.596 --> 00:38:30.186 A:middle
right behavior for free if you

00:38:30.186 --> 00:38:30.596 A:middle
just set the

00:38:30.596 --> 00:38:32.026 A:middle
contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior

00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:33.116 A:middle
to automatic.

00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:34.446 A:middle
If you're doing your own layout,

00:38:34.446 --> 00:38:35.106 A:middle
you can use your view

00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:38.186 A:middle
safeAreaLayoutGuide to help you.

00:38:38.296 --> 00:38:40.096 A:middle
We're also adding some new API

00:38:40.096 --> 00:38:41.756 A:middle
UITabBar so you can reflect your

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:42.726 A:middle
branding in your apps.

00:38:43.286 --> 00:38:44.846 A:middle
We've added a new area to either

00:38:44.846 --> 00:38:46.536 A:middle
side of the Tab Bar where you

00:38:46.536 --> 00:38:47.316 A:middle
can place a logo.

00:38:47.316 --> 00:38:48.806 A:middle
This will move along with the

00:38:48.806 --> 00:38:51.296 A:middle
Tab Bar when it scrolls on and

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:52.416 A:middle
off screen.

00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.856 A:middle
You can access these two new

00:38:53.856 --> 00:38:55.346 A:middle
views within your properties in

00:38:55.346 --> 00:38:57.466 A:middle
UITabBar, leadingAccessoryView

00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:58.626 A:middle
and trailingAccessoryView.

00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:00.396 A:middle
You shouldn't put buttons where

00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:00.396 A:middle
You shouldn't put buttons where

00:39:00.396 --> 00:39:01.386 A:middle
there are focusable items in

00:39:01.386 --> 00:39:02.276 A:middle
these accessory views.

00:39:02.576 --> 00:39:03.376 A:middle
They're really just designed for

00:39:03.376 --> 00:39:04.796 A:middle
static content.

00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:06.436 A:middle
Additionally, if you need to do

00:39:06.436 --> 00:39:07.486 A:middle
further customization on your

00:39:07.486 --> 00:39:08.666 A:middle
Tab Bar to match your branding,

00:39:09.186 --> 00:39:09.996 A:middle
you can do that with the new

00:39:09.996 --> 00:39:11.306 A:middle
standardAppearance property.

00:39:11.576 --> 00:39:12.566 A:middle
To hear more about

00:39:12.566 --> 00:39:13.676 A:middle
standardAppearance, see

00:39:13.676 --> 00:39:15.756 A:middle
Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13.

00:39:15.946 --> 00:39:19.706 A:middle
So what do we learn about Tab

00:39:19.706 --> 00:39:20.796 A:middle
Bars today on tvOS?

00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:22.876 A:middle
Well, you get a new one in tvOS

00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:24.756 A:middle
13, and it's really easy to

00:39:24.756 --> 00:39:26.446 A:middle
integrate into your app.

00:39:26.686 --> 00:39:27.876 A:middle
We've also made the Tab Bar more

00:39:27.876 --> 00:39:28.476 A:middle
flexible.

00:39:28.846 --> 00:39:29.936 A:middle
So you can have all the

00:39:29.936 --> 00:39:31.276 A:middle
convenience of using a standard

00:39:31.276 --> 00:39:32.846 A:middle
control, but you don't have to

00:39:32.956 --> 00:39:34.136 A:middle
sacrifice on your ability to

00:39:34.136 --> 00:39:34.956 A:middle
show off your branding.

00:39:35.826 --> 00:39:37.446 A:middle
So now that we've seen how

00:39:37.446 --> 00:39:39.086 A:middle
UITabBar makes for great top

00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:40.146 A:middle
level navigation in your app,

00:39:40.386 --> 00:39:42.206 A:middle
let's talk about browsing.

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:44.566 A:middle
We have some new tools that you

00:39:44.566 --> 00:39:46.206 A:middle
can use to build a full screen

00:39:46.206 --> 00:39:47.146 A:middle
browsing experience.

00:39:47.736 --> 00:39:50.236 A:middle
Tommy mentioned earlier about

00:39:50.236 --> 00:39:51.296 A:middle
the importance of creating a

00:39:51.296 --> 00:39:52.796 A:middle
browse experience that feels

00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:54.946 A:middle
lightweight and effortless, an

00:39:54.946 --> 00:39:57.256 A:middle
experience that gets you

00:39:57.256 --> 00:39:58.946 A:middle
immersed in a captivating story

00:39:59.016 --> 00:40:00.206 A:middle
more quickly than ever before,

00:39:59.016 --> 00:40:00.206 A:middle
more quickly than ever before,

00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:02.316 A:middle
all without the frustration of

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:03.976 A:middle
diving in and out of menus.

00:40:04.676 --> 00:40:05.866 A:middle
We built an experience that

00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:07.256 A:middle
makes the most of the television

00:40:07.316 --> 00:40:09.226 A:middle
in its gigantic screen, an

00:40:09.226 --> 00:40:10.596 A:middle
experience that's perfect for

00:40:10.596 --> 00:40:11.206 A:middle
your living room.

00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:13.536 A:middle
And using it is as simple as a

00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:14.666 A:middle
horizontal swipe.

00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:17.156 A:middle
In tvOs 13, we're introducing

00:40:17.156 --> 00:40:18.756 A:middle
new API to help you build an

00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:19.856 A:middle
experience just like the one you

00:40:19.856 --> 00:40:20.456 A:middle
see here.

00:40:21.436 --> 00:40:22.616 A:middle
We're doing that with the new

00:40:22.616 --> 00:40:23.386 A:middle
TVCollectionView

00:40:23.386 --> 00:40:25.016 A:middle
FullScreenLayout in TV UIKit.

00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:27.696 A:middle
It's designed to help you build

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:28.986 A:middle
a collection view that fills the

00:40:28.986 --> 00:40:30.656 A:middle
screen edge to edge, taking

00:40:30.656 --> 00:40:31.806 A:middle
advantage of the largest display

00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:32.406 A:middle
in your house.

00:40:33.376 --> 00:40:34.356 A:middle
By default, it will look

00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:35.796 A:middle
familiar to people that used

00:40:35.796 --> 00:40:37.506 A:middle
tvOS already but it's highly

00:40:37.506 --> 00:40:38.266 A:middle
customizable.

00:40:38.346 --> 00:40:39.966 A:middle
So you can easily adjust it to

00:40:39.966 --> 00:40:40.746 A:middle
meet the goals of your

00:40:40.746 --> 00:40:42.126 A:middle
engineering and design teams.

00:40:42.476 --> 00:40:44.076 A:middle
In fact, it's so customizable

00:40:44.076 --> 00:40:45.596 A:middle
that the Top Shelf that Caleb

00:40:45.596 --> 00:40:47.136 A:middle
showed you earlier even uses

00:40:47.136 --> 00:40:48.346 A:middle
this exact the same layout.

00:40:49.466 --> 00:40:50.636 A:middle
To go along with this layout,

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:51.466 A:middle
we're giving you when you a new

00:40:51.466 --> 00:40:53.456 A:middle
cell subclass, TVCollectionView

00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:54.146 A:middle
FullScreenCell.

00:40:55.616 --> 00:40:57.156 A:middle
It has two views that you need

00:40:57.156 --> 00:40:58.476 A:middle
to be aware of, the Masked

00:40:58.476 --> 00:40:59.836 A:middle
Background View and the Masked

00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:00.366 A:middle
Content View.

00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:00.366 A:middle
Content View.

00:41:00.836 --> 00:41:02.536 A:middle
When you create a custom cell,

00:41:02.876 --> 00:41:03.856 A:middle
these views are where you'll add

00:41:03.856 --> 00:41:04.786 A:middle
your content.

00:41:04.786 --> 00:41:06.216 A:middle
Generally, you'll add an opaque

00:41:06.216 --> 00:41:07.606 A:middle
image to the Masked Background

00:41:07.606 --> 00:41:09.676 A:middle
View and UI elements to the

00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:10.376 A:middle
Masked Content View.

00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:12.976 A:middle
Since this new Collection View

00:41:12.976 --> 00:41:13.916 A:middle
layout is designed to take

00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:15.276 A:middle
advantage of the entire screen,

00:41:16.236 --> 00:41:18.156 A:middle
the cell and its sub-use also

00:41:18.156 --> 00:41:19.506 A:middle
occupy the bounds of the display

00:41:19.506 --> 00:41:22.326 A:middle
in 1920 by 1080 points.

00:41:22.326 --> 00:41:23.546 A:middle
Before I tell you more about how

00:41:23.546 --> 00:41:24.576 A:middle
to customize a full screen

00:41:24.576 --> 00:41:26.356 A:middle
layout, I'll invite Felipe back

00:41:26.356 --> 00:41:28.056 A:middle
up on stage to show you how easy

00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:29.026 A:middle
it is to build a full screen

00:41:29.026 --> 00:41:30.176 A:middle
browse experience using

00:41:30.176 --> 00:41:30.936 A:middle
TVCollectionView

00:41:30.936 --> 00:41:31.656 A:middle
FullScreenLayout.

00:41:36.508 --> 00:41:38.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:44.066 A:middle
So we've started with an

00:41:44.066 --> 00:41:45.236 A:middle
existing app that has some

00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:46.796 A:middle
photos in a simple flow layout.

00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:48.986 A:middle
This is a good start but this

00:41:48.986 --> 00:41:50.606 A:middle
isn't really optimized for the

00:41:50.606 --> 00:41:51.256 A:middle
TV.

00:41:51.616 --> 00:41:52.646 A:middle
So now that we've seen all this

00:41:52.646 --> 00:41:53.546 A:middle
of that TVCollectionView

00:41:53.546 --> 00:41:55.296 A:middle
FullScreenLayout, let's go back

00:41:55.296 --> 00:41:58.616 A:middle
to Xcode and try adopting it.

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
We'll start by creating a new

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
We'll start by creating a new

00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:01.286 A:middle
fullScreenLayout.

00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:04.396 A:middle
And we can set that layout in

00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:05.516 A:middle
our Collection View replacing

00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:05.976 A:middle
the old one.

00:42:10.856 --> 00:42:12.296 A:middle
To go along with our layout,

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:12.886 A:middle
we'll need a cell.

00:42:12.886 --> 00:42:14.406 A:middle
Luckily, we've already created

00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:15.896 A:middle
one and we can register it with

00:42:15.896 --> 00:42:17.216 A:middle
our Collection View.

00:42:17.956 --> 00:42:21.036 A:middle
Then we'll return an instance of

00:42:21.036 --> 00:42:23.016 A:middle
this cell in our cell for item

00:42:23.016 --> 00:42:23.586 A:middle
indexPath.

00:42:24.226 --> 00:42:26.536 A:middle
Now we've setup our View

00:42:26.536 --> 00:42:28.106 A:middle
Controller, we can go to our

00:42:28.106 --> 00:42:29.486 A:middle
cell and add some content to it.

00:42:29.796 --> 00:42:31.876 A:middle
We already have an imageView and

00:42:31.876 --> 00:42:32.506 A:middle
a titleLabel.

00:42:32.506 --> 00:42:34.356 A:middle
We can start off by adding the

00:42:34.356 --> 00:42:35.276 A:middle
imageView to the Masked

00:42:35.276 --> 00:42:35.836 A:middle
Background View.

00:42:36.396 --> 00:42:40.256 A:middle
And we can add our titleLabel to

00:42:40.256 --> 00:42:41.126 A:middle
our Masked Content View.

00:42:42.266 --> 00:42:43.606 A:middle
Let's give it a really big font

00:42:43.606 --> 00:42:44.486 A:middle
so it's easy to see on the

00:42:44.486 --> 00:42:44.836 A:middle
screen.

00:42:44.836 --> 00:42:47.006 A:middle
Now that we've got this all

00:42:47.046 --> 00:42:48.666 A:middle
setup, we can go give it a try.

00:42:56.966 --> 00:42:57.906 A:middle
That's a lot better.

00:42:57.906 --> 00:42:59.076 A:middle
This really fills the screen and

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.196 A:middle
when you browse around, you can

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.196 A:middle
when you browse around, you can

00:43:00.196 --> 00:43:01.276 A:middle
see the images in much better

00:43:01.276 --> 00:43:01.646 A:middle
detail.

00:43:02.126 --> 00:43:04.166 A:middle
But what would be great is if

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:05.036 A:middle
when you click on the Siri

00:43:05.036 --> 00:43:06.576 A:middle
Remote, it filled the screen.

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:08.566 A:middle
Luckily, that's easy to do.

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:09.666 A:middle
We can go back to our View

00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:13.516 A:middle
Controller now and do that.

00:43:14.076 --> 00:43:15.576 A:middle
If we add didSelectItem in

00:43:15.576 --> 00:43:17.716 A:middle
indexPath, we can handle the

00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:18.496 A:middle
select action.

00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:20.136 A:middle
When that happens, we can set

00:43:20.136 --> 00:43:21.316 A:middle
the Masked Amount to zero and

00:43:21.646 --> 00:43:22.786 A:middle
will animate this to make it

00:43:22.786 --> 00:43:23.236 A:middle
look smooth.

00:43:24.796 --> 00:43:25.826 A:middle
Now, we can go ahead and try it

00:43:25.826 --> 00:43:26.886 A:middle
another time and see if that

00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:27.946 A:middle
does it.

00:43:33.596 --> 00:43:35.616 A:middle
You can see that when Felipe

00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:36.986 A:middle
clicks, it fills the screen edge

00:43:36.986 --> 00:43:37.936 A:middle
to edge which is really what

00:43:37.936 --> 00:43:38.696 A:middle
we're looking to do.

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:40.326 A:middle
But it looks like we forgot to

00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:41.066 A:middle
hide the text.

00:43:42.146 --> 00:43:43.536 A:middle
No problem, that's an easy fix.

00:43:43.536 --> 00:43:44.576 A:middle
We can go back to our cell and

00:43:44.576 --> 00:43:45.096 A:middle
fix that now.

00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:49.076 A:middle
If we override apply, we can get

00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:50.226 A:middle
the layout attributes as they

00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:50.776 A:middle
change.

00:43:51.716 --> 00:43:53.136 A:middle
In this case, we want the

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:55.276 A:middle
titleLabel to have an alpha of

00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:57.506 A:middle
zero when the Masked Amount is

00:43:57.506 --> 00:43:57.856 A:middle
zero.

00:43:57.856 --> 00:43:59.646 A:middle
So we can just set the opacity

00:43:59.996 --> 00:44:01.136 A:middle
to the same as the Masked

00:43:59.996 --> 00:44:01.136 A:middle
to the same as the Masked

00:44:01.136 --> 00:44:01.406 A:middle
Amount.

00:44:01.906 --> 00:44:04.896 A:middle
Let's give it one more try and

00:44:04.896 --> 00:44:05.436 A:middle
see how it looks.

00:44:12.456 --> 00:44:13.556 A:middle
That's much better.

00:44:13.996 --> 00:44:14.766 A:middle
Now, this is the type of

00:44:14.766 --> 00:44:15.846 A:middle
experience we're trying to build

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:16.466 A:middle
on the TV.

00:44:16.736 --> 00:44:17.956 A:middle
It's really easy to interact

00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:20.226 A:middle
with and you can easily get lost

00:44:20.226 --> 00:44:21.246 A:middle
in the content when it fills the

00:44:21.246 --> 00:44:21.996 A:middle
screen like this.

00:44:22.536 --> 00:44:23.606 A:middle
Thanks, Felipe.

00:44:24.516 --> 00:44:26.656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:30.156 A:middle
Now we can go back to the

00:44:30.156 --> 00:44:30.696 A:middle
details.

00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:31.686 A:middle
You remember

00:44:31.686 --> 00:44:33.086 A:middle
TVCollectionViewFullScreenCell

00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:34.226 A:middle
from before, and its two

00:44:34.226 --> 00:44:35.986 A:middle
sub-use, Masked Background and

00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:36.806 A:middle
Masked Content View.

00:44:37.646 --> 00:44:38.986 A:middle
In order to understand how these

00:44:38.986 --> 00:44:40.596 A:middle
two views work together, you'll

00:44:40.596 --> 00:44:41.446 A:middle
need to understand two

00:44:41.446 --> 00:44:42.586 A:middle
principles of the layout,

00:44:42.966 --> 00:44:44.636 A:middle
masking and parallax.

00:44:44.806 --> 00:44:45.916 A:middle
Let's start with masking.

00:44:47.136 --> 00:44:48.946 A:middle
The views and the cell are

00:44:48.946 --> 00:44:50.176 A:middle
layered on top of one another

00:44:50.176 --> 00:44:52.046 A:middle
and fill the whole screen.

00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:53.166 A:middle
You can see the Masked

00:44:53.166 --> 00:44:55.296 A:middle
Background View here and the

00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:56.256 A:middle
Content View on top.

00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:58.166 A:middle
When running edge to edge like

00:44:58.166 --> 00:44:59.576 A:middle
this, the Masked Amount

00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:01.316 A:middle
specified by the layout in cell

00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:01.316 A:middle
specified by the layout in cell

00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:02.016 A:middle
would be zero.

00:45:03.146 --> 00:45:04.546 A:middle
But when we're browsing around

00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:05.996 A:middle
in inset from the sides like

00:45:05.996 --> 00:45:07.806 A:middle
this, the Masked Amount is one.

00:45:08.416 --> 00:45:11.316 A:middle
You can control the amount of

00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:12.556 A:middle
the masked inset with the Masked

00:45:12.556 --> 00:45:13.826 A:middle
Inset Property in the layout.

00:45:15.116 --> 00:45:16.306 A:middle
The same information is

00:45:16.306 --> 00:45:17.486 A:middle
reflected in the cell with the

00:45:17.486 --> 00:45:18.836 A:middle
Content Bleed Property that it

00:45:18.836 --> 00:45:20.186 A:middle
gets from the layout attributes.

00:45:20.826 --> 00:45:23.186 A:middle
So that's masking.

00:45:23.186 --> 00:45:24.396 A:middle
Let's talk about parallax.

00:45:25.156 --> 00:45:26.456 A:middle
Parallax is just a way to create

00:45:26.456 --> 00:45:27.746 A:middle
depth by moving layers at

00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:28.476 A:middle
different rates.

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.346 A:middle
We do this all over tvOS

00:45:30.346 --> 00:45:30.736 A:middle
already.

00:45:30.736 --> 00:45:32.366 A:middle
Let me explain how that applies

00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:33.686 A:middle
to our layout.

00:45:34.776 --> 00:45:36.556 A:middle
The layout has a Parallax Factor

00:45:36.556 --> 00:45:37.046 A:middle
property.

00:45:37.246 --> 00:45:39.006 A:middle
It specifies how much slower the

00:45:39.006 --> 00:45:40.396 A:middle
Masked Background View most

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:41.706 A:middle
relative to the Masked Content

00:45:42.246 --> 00:45:42.366 A:middle
View.

00:45:43.376 --> 00:45:45.426 A:middle
The same information is passed

00:45:45.426 --> 00:45:46.506 A:middle
down to the cell through the

00:45:46.506 --> 00:45:47.546 A:middle
layout attributes and the

00:45:47.546 --> 00:45:48.866 A:middle
parallax offset property.

00:45:49.506 --> 00:45:50.746 A:middle
This specifies the distance

00:45:50.746 --> 00:45:51.926 A:middle
between the center of the Masked

00:45:51.926 --> 00:45:53.296 A:middle
Background and Masked Content

00:45:53.296 --> 00:45:54.356 A:middle
View at any point in time.

00:45:55.246 --> 00:45:56.576 A:middle
With different rates of motion

00:45:56.576 --> 00:45:57.826 A:middle
and a partially transparent

00:45:57.826 --> 00:45:59.816 A:middle
Masked Content View, you can see

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:00.916 A:middle
how we'd be able to simulate a

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:00.916 A:middle
how we'd be able to simulate a

00:46:00.916 --> 00:46:02.346 A:middle
sense of depth.

00:46:05.156 --> 00:46:06.706 A:middle
Finally, when combined together

00:46:06.706 --> 00:46:08.466 A:middle
with the mask, we get the wipe

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:09.746 A:middle
effect that you saw on Felipe's

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:10.026 A:middle
demo.

00:46:10.736 --> 00:46:14.316 A:middle
As a reminder, we do the heavy

00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:15.156 A:middle
lifting for you in

00:46:15.156 --> 00:46:15.876 A:middle
TVCollectionView

00:46:15.876 --> 00:46:17.476 A:middle
FullScreenLayout, but this

00:46:17.506 --> 00:46:18.686 A:middle
overview should have helped you

00:46:18.686 --> 00:46:19.656 A:middle
understand some of the

00:46:19.656 --> 00:46:20.806 A:middle
parameters that you can use to

00:46:21.066 --> 00:46:22.266 A:middle
get exactly the effect you're

00:46:22.266 --> 00:46:22.706 A:middle
looking for.

00:46:23.256 --> 00:46:26.056 A:middle
Since there are a lot of pixels

00:46:26.056 --> 00:46:27.136 A:middle
moving around in a full screen

00:46:27.136 --> 00:46:28.656 A:middle
layout like this, we have some

00:46:28.656 --> 00:46:30.126 A:middle
best practices that we recommend

00:46:30.126 --> 00:46:31.106 A:middle
for getting the most out of

00:46:31.106 --> 00:46:31.766 A:middle
TVCollectionView

00:46:31.766 --> 00:46:32.436 A:middle
FullScreenLayout.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.766 A:middle
You should avoid starting any

00:46:35.766 --> 00:46:37.096 A:middle
animations or video until the

00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:38.116 A:middle
cell reaches the center.

00:46:38.836 --> 00:46:40.056 A:middle
Playing multiple videos at once

00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:41.186 A:middle
will not only be distracting to

00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:42.336 A:middle
people using your app, but it

00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:43.596 A:middle
will probably cause you drop

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:44.106 A:middle
frames.

00:46:44.686 --> 00:46:46.786 A:middle
You should watch how many

00:46:46.786 --> 00:46:48.106 A:middle
offscreen passes you're using.

00:46:48.376 --> 00:46:49.656 A:middle
This means avoiding excessive

00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:51.566 A:middle
use of visual effects or group

00:46:51.566 --> 00:46:52.736 A:middle
opacity animations.

00:46:53.126 --> 00:46:54.356 A:middle
Really, most of the things that

00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:56.276 A:middle
you'd use to help with scrolling

00:46:56.276 --> 00:46:57.396 A:middle
in the rest of your app, you

00:46:57.396 --> 00:46:58.526 A:middle
could apply here when swiping

00:46:58.526 --> 00:47:00.876 A:middle
side to side.

00:46:58.526 --> 00:47:00.876 A:middle
side to side.

00:47:01.106 --> 00:47:02.086 A:middle
You should also be mindful of

00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:02.996 A:middle
your memory usage.

00:47:03.306 --> 00:47:04.506 A:middle
You'll probably be working with

00:47:04.506 --> 00:47:05.876 A:middle
a lot of large images in a

00:47:05.876 --> 00:47:06.686 A:middle
layout like this.

00:47:06.976 --> 00:47:08.536 A:middle
So, you should make sure that

00:47:08.536 --> 00:47:09.886 A:middle
their sized appropriately for

00:47:09.886 --> 00:47:11.646 A:middle
the display and that you release

00:47:11.646 --> 00:47:12.766 A:middle
them from memory when you're not

00:47:12.766 --> 00:47:13.476 A:middle
using them anymore.

00:47:17.136 --> 00:47:19.016 A:middle
If you're a TVMLKit developer,

00:47:19.016 --> 00:47:20.136 A:middle
don't think we forgot about you.

00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:21.836 A:middle
You can access all of these for

00:47:21.836 --> 00:47:23.066 A:middle
TVBrowserViewController.

00:47:23.736 --> 00:47:25.086 A:middle
We'll even link to a sample app

00:47:25.086 --> 00:47:26.536 A:middle
that shows you how easy it is to

00:47:26.536 --> 00:47:27.866 A:middle
build a smooth transition from a

00:47:27.866 --> 00:47:29.576 A:middle
shelf to a full screen browse

00:47:29.576 --> 00:47:30.726 A:middle
and back.

00:47:32.476 --> 00:47:33.906 A:middle
Today, we've taken you on a

00:47:33.906 --> 00:47:35.676 A:middle
journey, starting with people's

00:47:35.676 --> 00:47:37.126 A:middle
first exposure to your app, the

00:47:37.126 --> 00:47:38.546 A:middle
home screen and the Top Shelf.

00:47:39.476 --> 00:47:40.466 A:middle
It's a great way to grab

00:47:40.466 --> 00:47:41.736 A:middle
people's attention and draw them

00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:42.126 A:middle
into your app.

00:47:43.256 --> 00:47:44.856 A:middle
Then we moved on to the first

00:47:44.856 --> 00:47:46.696 A:middle
launch experience where you

00:47:47.256 --> 00:47:48.796 A:middle
learned how you can integrate

00:47:48.796 --> 00:47:50.416 A:middle
with multiuser to bring people

00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:51.646 A:middle
to their personalized content

00:47:51.646 --> 00:47:53.196 A:middle
right away without the need for

00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:53.946 A:middle
additional dialogues.

00:47:55.296 --> 00:47:57.686 A:middle
And, finally, we learned how you

00:47:57.686 --> 00:47:59.096 A:middle
can make browsing simple and

00:47:59.096 --> 00:48:00.906 A:middle
effortless with our new Tab Bar

00:47:59.096 --> 00:48:00.906 A:middle
effortless with our new Tab Bar

00:48:00.906 --> 00:48:01.736 A:middle
and full screen layout.

00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:04.236 A:middle
Together, all these made for

00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:05.496 A:middle
great usability in the living

00:48:05.496 --> 00:48:05.756 A:middle
room.

00:48:06.126 --> 00:48:07.636 A:middle
We hope you take the tools and

00:48:07.636 --> 00:48:09.036 A:middle
principles that we've shown you

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:10.706 A:middle
here today and apply them in

00:48:10.706 --> 00:48:12.376 A:middle
your own apps so that everyone

00:48:12.376 --> 00:48:14.106 A:middle
using tvOS can have an enjoyable

00:48:14.106 --> 00:48:14.746 A:middle
experience.

00:48:16.196 --> 00:48:17.556 A:middle
You can see more information

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:19.216 A:middle
about our talk here and come see

00:48:19.216 --> 00:48:20.336 A:middle
us on our labs in Wednesday and

00:48:20.336 --> 00:48:20.856 A:middle
Friday.

00:48:23.006 --> 00:48:23.726 A:middle
Thanks everybody.

00:48:24.516 --> 00:48:29.500 A:middle
