00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:08.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Ben Harry from the

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:09.466 A:middle
Game Center Engineering team.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:12.166 A:middle
In this presentation, I'm going

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.546 A:middle
to talk about Game Center player

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.346 A:middle
identifiers.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.716 A:middle
To get started, I'm going to

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.156 A:middle
give you a brief overview of

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:20.426 A:middle
what Game Center offers to the

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:21.486 A:middle
players of your games.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:24.856 A:middle
Game Center is a social gaming

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.306 A:middle
network that allows players to

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.496 A:middle
track their best scores on

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:28.946 A:middle
leaderboards, view their

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.396 A:middle
achievements earned playing your

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.625 A:middle
games, challenge their friends

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.226 A:middle
to complete an achievement or to

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:36.876 A:middle
beat a leaderboard score, and

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.156 A:middle
play either real-time or

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:39.616 A:middle
turn-based multiplayer games

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:40.416 A:middle
with their friends.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.116 A:middle
At the heart of Game Center

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:45.466 A:middle
games are the players.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.316 A:middle
Players are represented by

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.606 A:middle
objects that contain unique

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.296 A:middle
information that differentiate

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:52.586 A:middle
one player from another.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.326 A:middle
The object used to represent

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.606 A:middle
Game Center players is the

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:57.466 A:middle
GKPlayer.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.296 A:middle
Every GKPlayer has a unique

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.296 A:middle
Every GKPlayer has a unique

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.976 A:middle
nickname accessed by the alias

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:03.476 A:middle
property.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.346 A:middle
A player may also choose an

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:07.876 A:middle
avatar image that will be used

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.326 A:middle
within Game Center UIs.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:12.546 A:middle
In addition, each Game Center

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:13.986 A:middle
user has a unique static

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.996 A:middle
identifier that remains the same

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:17.496 A:middle
across all games that the player

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:17.986 A:middle
plays.

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.896 A:middle
You may use this identifier to

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.516 A:middle
store per-player information.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:27.896 A:middle
Let me now talk about how a

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.316 A:middle
player static identifier

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:30.666 A:middle
currently works in Game Center.

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.346 A:middle
You may already be familiar with

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.246 A:middle
this, but let us consider this

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.696 A:middle
example in case you need to

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.596 A:middle
refresh your memory.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.896 A:middle
Here we have two teams, Team A

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:41.846 A:middle
and Team B.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.836 A:middle
In this presentation, I will be

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:46.746 A:middle
using the term team to represent

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:48.716 A:middle
a development team that releases

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.276 A:middle
a game to the App Store using

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.276 A:middle
App Store Connect.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.486 A:middle
So, I have been playing two

00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.376 A:middle
games from Team A and I also

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:57.836 A:middle
really enjoy the game from Team

00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:58.136 A:middle
B.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
As we see, my static Game Center

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
As we see, my static Game Center

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:03.086 A:middle
identifier is P123.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.466 A:middle
Each of these games we'll see

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.836 A:middle
the same value from my

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.636 A:middle
identifier P123.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.476 A:middle
No matter which game I play, I

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.496 A:middle
had the same static identifier.

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:16.546 A:middle
Going forward, we now want to

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:18.246 A:middle
increase privacy by introducing

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:20.386 A:middle
new player identifiers that are

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:22.116 A:middle
scoped to the either the team or

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:23.146 A:middle
the game itself.

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:26.656 A:middle
So let's begin with the first of

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:28.486 A:middle
these new identifiers, the team

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.256 A:middle
player ID.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.306 A:middle
Remember that team refers to the

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.026 A:middle
development team that releases a

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.186 A:middle
game to the App Store.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.816 A:middle
Again, consider Team A and Team

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.776 A:middle
B along with the same games from

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:41.276 A:middle
before.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.486 A:middle
Notice that now I have two

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:45.616 A:middle
different identifiers.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.546 A:middle
When I play either game from

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:49.566 A:middle
Team A, the value of my team

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.976 A:middle
player ID will be T11.

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.446 A:middle
When I play the game from Team

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.486 A:middle
B, the value of my team player

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:57.216 A:middle
ID will be T22.

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.196 A:middle
This means that the value of my

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.196 A:middle
This means that the value of my

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.236 A:middle
team player ID scoped to the

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:03.836 A:middle
team that releases the game I

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:04.226 A:middle
play.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.536 A:middle
This is an improvement to player

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.236 A:middle
privacy as Team A will only know

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.966 A:middle
my team player ID as T11, and

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.686 A:middle
Team B will only know my team

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.316 A:middle
player ID as T22.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.926 A:middle
So this is the team player ID.

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.416 A:middle
I now want to tell you about our

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.066 A:middle
other new player identifier, the

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.106 A:middle
game player ID.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.636 A:middle
The game player ID is unique per

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.526 A:middle
game per player.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.416 A:middle
This means that my game player

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.396 A:middle
ID is unique to each game that I

00:03:35.396 --> 00:03:35.816 A:middle
play.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.276 A:middle
Its value is also independent

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:40.566 A:middle
from the team that releases the

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:40.926 A:middle
game.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.446 A:middle
Let us go back to our familiar

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:46.556 A:middle
teams, Team A and Team B.

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.406 A:middle
As you can see here, my game

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:51.206 A:middle
player ID is different for each

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:53.846 A:middle
game that I play, regardless of

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:54.856 A:middle
which team has released the

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
game.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:58.496 A:middle
To further show how a game

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.146 A:middle
player ID is independent from

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.146 A:middle
player ID is independent from

00:04:00.146 --> 00:04:01.976 A:middle
the team, let's consider the

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.446 A:middle
case when a game is transferred

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:04.666 A:middle
from one team to another.

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:07.786 A:middle
I am now going to show you what

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:09.556 A:middle
happens to my scoped identifiers

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.396 A:middle
when Game 2 is transferred from

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:12.706 A:middle
Team A to Team B.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.716 A:middle
Let's say Team A transfers

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:18.866 A:middle
ownership of Game 2 to Team B.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.326 A:middle
Now, when I play Game 2, my game

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.016 A:middle
player ID for Game 2 remains

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:24.716 A:middle
unchanged.

00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:28.136 A:middle
My game player ID for Game 2

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.876 A:middle
persisted with the game and is

00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:31.196 A:middle
independent of the team.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.266 A:middle
Now, you may have also noticed

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:36.546 A:middle
something about my team player

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.606 A:middle
ID for Game 2.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.786 A:middle
My team player ID for Game 2

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.526 A:middle
took on the value for Team B

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:44.226 A:middle
since it is now released to the

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:45.416 A:middle
App Store by Team B.

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:49.176 A:middle
So we have come to the scoping

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:50.086 A:middle
of the new Game Center

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:51.456 A:middle
identifiers and also what

00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:52.886 A:middle
happens to these identifiers

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:53.966 A:middle
when game ownership is

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:54.596 A:middle
transferred.

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:57.866 A:middle
I am now going to talk about how

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.016 A:middle
you may use the scope

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.456 A:middle
identifiers in the games that

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.456 A:middle
identifiers in the games that

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:01.096 A:middle
you develop.

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:05.636 A:middle
As you have seen, we have added

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.296 A:middle
two new scope identifiers to the

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:09.596 A:middle
GKPlayer, the team player ID and

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.766 A:middle
the game player ID.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:14.446 A:middle
The team player ID and game

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.066 A:middle
player ID have been introduced

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.156 A:middle
with the goal of increasing

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:19.586 A:middle
player privacy, which aligned to

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:20.666 A:middle
the Apple's commitment to

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:22.256 A:middle
protecting the privacy of our

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
users.

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:26.436 A:middle
This new identifiers replaced

00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:28.186 A:middle
the existing static identifier

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:30.356 A:middle
or player ID on a GKPlayer.

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:34.506 A:middle
The playerID property is now

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:35.276 A:middle
deprecated.

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:36.926 A:middle
So I encourage you to start

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:37.836 A:middle
using these new scope

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:38.886 A:middle
identifiers today.

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.736 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, the team

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:45.256 A:middle
player ID and game player ID

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.866 A:middle
have been introduced to replace

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.036 A:middle
the static player ID.

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:50.786 A:middle
If you don't query the player ID

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:52.286 A:middle
in your games, then you will not

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.716 A:middle
need to make any changes.

00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:56.716 A:middle
If you do query the player ID,

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:58.386 A:middle
you'll need to switch to the new

00:05:58.386 --> 00:05:59.566 A:middle
scoped identifiers.

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.416 A:middle
You'll be using the team player

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.616 A:middle
ID in most cases.

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:06.846 A:middle
Likewise, if you currently use

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:08.236 A:middle
the static player ID to save

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.146 A:middle
game data, you should move to

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:11.286 A:middle
the team scoped ID.

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:13.576 A:middle
Doing so will handle the

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:15.086 A:middle
situation in the device you

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:16.536 A:middle
shared by multiple Game Center

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.116 A:middle
players.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.026 A:middle
For those of you who may be

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:21.496 A:middle
persisting the static player ID

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.116 A:middle
in your own back end system, you

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.526 A:middle
should also update to the new

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:26.736 A:middle
scoped identifiers.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.686 A:middle
You can do this any time after a

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:31.046 A:middle
successful authentication.

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:35.086 A:middle
Next, let me show you how scoped

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:36.716 A:middle
identifiers look for their local

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:38.536 A:middle
player as compared to non-local

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:39.126 A:middle
players.

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:42.066 A:middle
As you probably know, the

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:44.136 A:middle
GKLocalPlayer is the object that

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.456 A:middle
represents the authenticated

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:47.246 A:middle
Game Center player on a device.

00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:50.056 A:middle
At any given time, only one

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:51.616 A:middle
player may be authenticated.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.536 A:middle
And the GKLocalPlayer has a

00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:56.096 A:middle
persistent team player ID and

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:56.926 A:middle
game player ID.

00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.766 A:middle
But what about the GKPlayer?

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.206 A:middle
A GKPlayer object provides

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:03.956 A:middle
information about other players.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:06.686 A:middle
These are non-local players and

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.186 A:middle
may be found in leaderboards

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:09.706 A:middle
recently played lists

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.026 A:middle
multiplayer matches and so

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:11.386 A:middle
forth.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:14.306 A:middle
The scoped identifiers for

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:16.266 A:middle
GKPlayers will be instance based

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:17.876 A:middle
on the context in which they are

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:18.346 A:middle
used.

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:21.426 A:middle
For example, their scope to each

00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:22.796 A:middle
instance of a leaderboard or

00:07:22.796 --> 00:07:24.396 A:middle
each instance of a multiplayer

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:26.656 A:middle
match, which means that you

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
cannot count on them to persist

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:29.506 A:middle
in subsequent matches.

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:33.756 A:middle
Let's say you have your own

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:35.066 A:middle
player accounting system.

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:36.496 A:middle
In which case, you'll be loading

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:37.866 A:middle
the corresponding GKPlayer

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:38.456 A:middle
objects.

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:40.716 A:middle
To do this, use the

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.326 A:middle
loadPlayersForIdentifiers:

00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:43.676 A:middle
withCompletionHandler method

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:44.906 A:middle
found on GKPlayer.

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:47.846 A:middle
You may use either the team

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.646 A:middle
player ID or the game player ID

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:51.006 A:middle
for the identifiers.

00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:54.496 A:middle
When you use the new

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:56.246 A:middle
identifiers, there is a very

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:58.036 A:middle
rare case where the scoped

00:07:58.036 --> 00:07:59.126 A:middle
identifiers will not be

00:07:59.126 --> 00:07:59.606 A:middle
available.

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:02.196 A:middle
So what should you do if the

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:03.506 A:middle
scoped identifiers are not

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:03.956 A:middle
available?

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:06.986 A:middle
Usually, when a player launches

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.516 A:middle
one of your games, the scoped

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.246 A:middle
identifiers for the local player

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.346 A:middle
will be available after

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.636 A:middle
successful authentication.

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:16.296 A:middle
However, there is a slim chance

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.806 A:middle
that the scoped identifiers may

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:18.876 A:middle
not be available.

00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:21.696 A:middle
For this case, we've added a new

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.046 A:middle
API to GKPlayer.

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.256 A:middle
Scoped IDs are persistent.

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.266 A:middle
This property will be false if

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:29.206 A:middle
they are not available.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.416 A:middle
This means that you'll need to

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:34.066 A:middle
check this property before using

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.506 A:middle
the team player ID or game

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:36.976 A:middle
player ID for the local player.

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:40.206 A:middle
So let's tie all this

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:41.416 A:middle
information together by

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:43.025 A:middle
considering an example of using

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:44.546 A:middle
the scoped identifiers after

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:45.846 A:middle
successful authentication.

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:49.396 A:middle
As you know, when the

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:50.886 A:middle
authenticate handler returns,

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.486 A:middle
you need to check if Game Center

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:53.536 A:middle
has returned you a view

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:54.086 A:middle
controller.

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:56.666 A:middle
If so, then you present the view

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:57.826 A:middle
controller when convenient.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.276 A:middle
If there is no view controller

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.206 A:middle
and the local player has

00:09:03.206 --> 00:09:04.696 A:middle
successfully authenticated, then

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.376 A:middle
you will be able to use the

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:07.996 A:middle
scoped identifiers after first

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.636 A:middle
checking the scoped IDs are a

00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:10.576 A:middle
persistent value.

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:15.286 A:middle
If you are persisting the player

00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:17.166 A:middle
ID in your own back end system,

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:19.116 A:middle
now is when you should convert

00:09:19.116 --> 00:09:20.596 A:middle
from the old static identifier

00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:22.296 A:middle
to the new scope identifiers.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:25.846 A:middle
I will now wrap up by

00:09:25.846 --> 00:09:26.736 A:middle
summarizing what I have

00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:27.496 A:middle
presented today.

00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.036 A:middle
Game Center is introducing new

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.696 A:middle
scoped identifiers with the goal

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.106 A:middle
of increasing player privacy.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:36.166 A:middle
A player's team player ID is

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:37.586 A:middle
scoped to your development team.

00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:40.446 A:middle
A player's game player ID is

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.716 A:middle
scoped to a game and will

00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:43.256 A:middle
persist with that game if it is

00:09:43.256 --> 00:09:44.496 A:middle
transferred from one developer

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.066 A:middle
to another.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.436 A:middle
Use these new scoped identifiers

00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:50.096 A:middle
in Game Center APIs as you will

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:51.186 A:middle
use the player ID.

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:54.136 A:middle
Both of these identifiers are

00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:55.536 A:middle
available now so start using

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:56.056 A:middle
them today.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.786 A:middle
For more information on this

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.786 A:middle
