[ Applause ]

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Hoyt, from the

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.816 A:middle
Turi team at Apple, and I'm here

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.376 A:middle
to tell you about the Create ML

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:19.236 A:middle
Recommender.

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:21.486 A:middle
Create ML Recommenders are a

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:23.366 A:middle
fantastic way to add

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.556 A:middle
personalization and intelligence

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.416 A:middle
into the user experience of your

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:27.666 A:middle
app.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.546 A:middle
Suppose I have a hiking journal

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.656 A:middle
where I can log different hikes

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.506 A:middle
I've taken and how much I like

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.886 A:middle
or dislike each of them.

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:38.656 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if this

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:41.186 A:middle
also recommended new trails for

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.756 A:middle
me to try based on the

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.876 A:middle
preferences I already expressed?

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:48.756 A:middle
Or suppose I have a math quiz

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:51.946 A:middle
app, where the user has to solve

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.446 A:middle
a number of math problems in a

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:54.366 A:middle
timed session.

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:56.706 A:middle
It would make sense here to

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:58.396 A:middle
choose the next problem to ask

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
based on which of the previously

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
based on which of the previously

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:02.016 A:middle
problems the user got correct or

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:02.426 A:middle
incorrect.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.495 A:middle
Or let's take a look at a

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.216 A:middle
shopping list where I can list

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:08.316 A:middle
out the ingredients I need to

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:09.656 A:middle
buy the next time I go to the

00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:10.386 A:middle
grocery store.

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.586 A:middle
Now, this is really simple here.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.546 A:middle
But if it suggested ingredients

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:18.156 A:middle
that I may have forgotten, it

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:19.906 A:middle
makes the experience more

00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:21.296 A:middle
engaging and interesting.

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.286 A:middle
My goal today is to enable you

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:26.916 A:middle
to create these kind of user

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:28.966 A:middle
experiences in your app through

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.536 A:middle
the Create ML recommender.

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:33.276 A:middle
Let's dive into how we're going

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:35.466 A:middle
to do this and let's start with

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:35.926 A:middle
the data.

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.906 A:middle
Recommenders work by looking for

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.236 A:middle
patterns in groups of items.

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:45.206 A:middle
Back to the shopping list.

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:46.996 A:middle
When I'm going to the grocery

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:49.556 A:middle
store, it's likely I have a few

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:50.576 A:middle
recipes in mind.

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.016 A:middle
I want to buy the ingredients

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:53.006 A:middle
for them and make something

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:53.616 A:middle
delicious.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:56.406 A:middle
And, well what are recipes?

00:01:56.776 --> 00:01:58.756 A:middle
They are groups of ingredients.

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:00.776 A:middle
And it turns out this is a

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:00.776 A:middle
And it turns out this is a

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:03.346 A:middle
perfect example of the kind of

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
data you can use for

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:05.646 A:middle
Recommender.

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:08.645 A:middle
In fact, all you need to do here

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.036 A:middle
is to take these recipes and

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.636 A:middle
turn them into a table with a

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:16.826 A:middle
group column and an item column.

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.456 A:middle
Each row here says that a

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:21.006 A:middle
particular item belongs to a

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:21.976 A:middle
particular group.

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:25.616 A:middle
Now, here the groups are recipes

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.146 A:middle
and the items are ingredients.

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:28.566 A:middle
But this can be much more

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:29.006 A:middle
general.

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.316 A:middle
Let's go to the math quiz app.

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.406 A:middle
Here, the group can be the

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.026 A:middle
particular session that a

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:36.736 A:middle
problem was asked in.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:38.026 A:middle
The item is the problem.

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.926 A:middle
And, well, I need to introduce

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:41.966 A:middle
one more concept here.

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:43.896 A:middle
We need to be able to give the

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:44.966 A:middle
model feedback.

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:46.706 A:middle
We need to tell it which

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:48.856 A:middle
problems the user got correct or

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:49.516 A:middle
incorrect.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.986 A:middle
And so the Recommender also

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:53.646 A:middle
works with a rating column.

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.136 A:middle
A rating is a measure of how

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:57.666 A:middle
good or how desirable a

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:59.126 A:middle
particular interaction is.

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.976 A:middle
Here, we could assign a 1 if the

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.976 A:middle
Here, we could assign a 1 if the

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.946 A:middle
user got the problem correct, or

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:05.166 A:middle
a 0 if they got it wrong.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:09.356 A:middle
Now, with the hiking app, the

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.396 A:middle
data there has the user, has the

00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:15.826 A:middle
group being the user, the trail

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.846 A:middle
being the item, and a rating

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.926 A:middle
being an explicit feedback from

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.166 A:middle
the user about how much they

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.976 A:middle
liked or disliked that

00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:24.496 A:middle
particular trail.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.746 A:middle
Now, in your app, you would

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.276 A:middle
query it with the same kind of

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:31.706 A:middle
data.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:33.616 A:middle
You would locally track these

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:35.486 A:middle
interactions and you would feed

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:38.946 A:middle
in a set of items or item rating

00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:40.366 A:middle
pairs to your model.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.786 A:middle
Your model would then recommend

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.856 A:middle
new items based on the

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:46.696 A:middle
preferences and patterns

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:49.046 A:middle
expressed in your input data.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.536 A:middle
Let's see this particular one in

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:51.976 A:middle
action.

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
So, I have here a simple hiking

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:55.526 A:middle
journal.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:57.886 A:middle
I don't have any hikes logged

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.696 A:middle
yet and so it's actually

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:01.526 A:middle
recommending popular items,

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:01.526 A:middle
recommending popular items,

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:02.996 A:middle
things that get consistently

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:03.646 A:middle
high ratings.

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:05.246 A:middle
Let's go see if there's any

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:06.266 A:middle
interesting ones in here.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:09.366 A:middle
Well, I'm adventurous, let's try

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:09.786 A:middle
this one.

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:10.866 A:middle
Well, okay.

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:13.166 A:middle
Actually too hot, too dry.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.446 A:middle
Didn't really like it.

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:17.055 A:middle
So, I'm going to say it's not

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:17.446 A:middle
for me.

00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:21.046 A:middle
Now, what we see here is that

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.326 A:middle
this hiking journal has now

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.996 A:middle
updated the hikes based on the

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.536 A:middle
preferences I've expressed

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:28.666 A:middle
already.

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:31.576 A:middle
It's recommending different

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:32.176 A:middle
landscapes.

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:33.786 A:middle
Ah. This one looks really nice.

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:35.206 A:middle
I grew up in Colorado.

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
I love aspens, I love tall

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:37.306 A:middle
mountains.

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:37.926 A:middle
Let's try it.

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:39.796 A:middle
Okay. It was fantastic.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:43.916 A:middle
Loved it. And here the model is

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.966 A:middle
learning more about my

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:45.926 A:middle
preferences now.

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:47.466 A:middle
It knows I like mountains,

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.806 A:middle
rocks, and colorful foliage.

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:52.406 A:middle
So, let's try another one.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:53.906 A:middle
All right.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:55.116 A:middle
There we go.

00:04:57.356 --> 00:04:59.506 A:middle
Now I'm exhausted.

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:00.886 A:middle
Three hikes in one day.

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:00.886 A:middle
Three hikes in one day.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:01.856 A:middle
That's quite a bit [laughter].

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:05.446 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:05.676 A:middle
here.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:11.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:13.786 A:middle
Now, I already showed you an

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:15.716 A:middle
example of the type of data used

00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:17.676 A:middle
to train this particular model.

00:05:18.896 --> 00:05:21.216 A:middle
Now I would like to dive into

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:23.536 A:middle
how the Create ML Recommender

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:25.666 A:middle
extracts the patterns from this

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:28.526 A:middle
data and builds a model that you

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.326 A:middle
can use in your app.

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.496 A:middle
The Create ML Recommender works

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:34.086 A:middle
by learning relationships

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:35.926 A:middle
between the items.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.356 A:middle
What items tend to go with what

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:39.056 A:middle
other items?

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.236 A:middle
Let's suppose we have three

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:41.806 A:middle
hikes here.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:44.186 A:middle
Two of these are up tall, steep,

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:46.066 A:middle
mountain peaks, possibly the

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:46.856 A:middle
kind I would like.

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:49.526 A:middle
And one of these is a nice

00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:51.346 A:middle
stroll by a sandy beach.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.676 A:middle
Now, that information is not

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:56.216 A:middle
actually present in the model.

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:58.786 A:middle
All we have are hikers, trails,

00:05:58.786 --> 00:05:59.666 A:middle
and ratings.

00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:02.576 A:middle
However, if you like climbing

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:04.576 A:middle
these tall mountain peaks, it's

00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:05.676 A:middle
likely you would give both of

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:06.926 A:middle
these similar ratings.

00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:08.216 A:middle
And so what we would see in the

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:10.106 A:middle
data is that the same hiker

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:11.576 A:middle
would give each of these hikes

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:12.756 A:middle
similar ratings.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.016 A:middle
Likewise, because you go out and

00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:17.376 A:middle
enjoy a nice stroll by the

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.716 A:middle
beach, it doesn't necessarily

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:20.116 A:middle
mean you want to climb a tall,

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.236 A:middle
cold, windy mountain.

00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:23.226 A:middle
And, or vice versa.

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:25.746 A:middle
And so you may give these two

00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.346 A:middle
trails different ratings.

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:30.756 A:middle
The Create ML Recommender would

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.476 A:middle
find these patterns in the data

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:34.946 A:middle
and learn that these first two

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:36.406 A:middle
hikes are similar to each other.

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:37.646 A:middle
They tend to go together.

00:06:38.076 --> 00:06:39.706 A:middle
And the third one is different.

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:42.316 A:middle
Now, when you throw all the

00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:43.966 A:middle
items into the mix, the

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.766 A:middle
Recommender builds a graph of

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:47.296 A:middle
which items tend to go with

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.236 A:middle
which other items.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.676 A:middle
How they're all related.

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.416 A:middle
And it's this graph that gets

00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:53.026 A:middle
packaged into your model.

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:55.386 A:middle
All of the user data and the

00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:56.536 A:middle
group data present in your

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:58.916 A:middle
training data is not explicitly

00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:02.296 A:middle
present in the final model.

00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:02.296 A:middle
present in the final model.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:06.786 A:middle
Now, to do this in your app, the

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:08.416 A:middle
easiest way to build this model

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:09.546 A:middle
is through the Recommender

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:11.596 A:middle
template in the Create ML app.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:14.436 A:middle
That, like all of the other

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:15.796 A:middle
templates, guides you through

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:18.486 A:middle
the process of loading your

00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.386 A:middle
data, building your model,

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:22.536 A:middle
evaluating your model's

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:24.436 A:middle
performance, and exporting your

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:27.036 A:middle
model to Core ML.

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:29.486 A:middle
Now, if you want to do it

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:31.546 A:middle
programmatically, this is also

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.456 A:middle
possible through the Create ML

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
framework.

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
And here the process is the

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:36.306 A:middle
same.

00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:39.276 A:middle
First we load our training data

00:07:39.276 --> 00:07:41.406 A:middle
from a CSV file or a JSON file.

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:45.126 A:middle
We then specify what the group

00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:47.216 A:middle
or user column, what's the item

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.196 A:middle
column, and optionally, which is

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:50.126 A:middle
the rating column.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.476 A:middle
If we have data that's not

00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:55.436 A:middle
present in the training data, we

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.926 A:middle
can evaluate how well our model,

00:07:57.926 --> 00:07:59.646 A:middle
how accurately our model can

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.886 A:middle
anticipate those new data by

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.886 A:middle
anticipate those new data by

00:08:02.026 --> 00:08:03.996 A:middle
using the model evaluate method.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:06.016 A:middle
And finally, we can write this

00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:07.216 A:middle
model out to Core ML.

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:10.016 A:middle
Now, in your app, you would

00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:11.936 A:middle
locally track the interactions.

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:14.786 A:middle
If your model uses ratings, you

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.186 A:middle
would track a dictionary of

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:17.376 A:middle
items to ratings.

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:19.936 A:middle
Otherwise, you would simply use

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:20.926 A:middle
a list of items.

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:23.226 A:middle
Then, you would construct the

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:24.596 A:middle
input to your model by also

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:26.756 A:middle
specifying how many items you

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.766 A:middle
wanted to recommend.

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.206 A:middle
And finally, your model will

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:31.966 A:middle
return a ranked list of

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:33.946 A:middle
suggested items based on the

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.606 A:middle
input preferences it believes

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:39.966 A:middle
most go with your input set.

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:42.635 A:middle
Let me wrap this up with a few

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.035 A:middle
final considerations here.

00:08:45.876 --> 00:08:49.526 A:middle
First, these models are very

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:50.186 A:middle
flexible.

00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:52.126 A:middle
They can be used in many

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:53.746 A:middle
scenarios that don't fall into

00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:55.726 A:middle
the traditional user, item,

00:08:56.066 --> 00:08:58.366 A:middle
rating system of recommenders.

00:08:58.836 --> 00:09:00.496 A:middle
We, I gave you several examples

00:08:58.836 --> 00:09:00.496 A:middle
We, I gave you several examples

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:02.576 A:middle
here but I'm excited to see how

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.606 A:middle
you as creative app developers

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:06.026 A:middle
can incorporate this into the

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:07.726 A:middle
user experiences of your app.

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.306 A:middle
Second, these models shift with

00:09:12.306 --> 00:09:12.766 A:middle
your app.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.426 A:middle
That means they're on the device

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:15.676 A:middle
and they work offline and

00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:16.416 A:middle
they're fast.

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:18.656 A:middle
It's perfect for just adding

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:20.396 A:middle
that touch of personalization

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:22.356 A:middle
into your user experience.

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:25.736 A:middle
Finally, because they are with

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.296 A:middle
your app and work offline, that

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.616 A:middle
means they're also privacy

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
preserving.

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:31.586 A:middle
That way you can guarantee to

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:33.626 A:middle
your users that their data is

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:35.916 A:middle
secure, even though the app

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.506 A:middle
adapts and responds to their

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:38.246 A:middle
preferences.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:41.186 A:middle
Finally, to wrap up this entire

00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:43.266 A:middle
session, you heard about some

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:44.976 A:middle
amazing new advances in text

00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:46.726 A:middle
classification that allow us to

00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:48.316 A:middle
take advantage of the semantic

00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:50.786 A:middle
meaning of the text, even with

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:52.076 A:middle
the limited amount of input

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:52.416 A:middle
data.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.996 A:middle
You also heard about the new

00:09:54.996 --> 00:09:57.066 A:middle
activity classification, which

00:09:57.066 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
allows you to understand and

00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:00.146 A:middle
assign meaning to the motion and

00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:00.146 A:middle
assign meaning to the motion and

00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:01.336 A:middle
activities of your user.

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:04.116 A:middle
And finally, I just introduced

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:06.256 A:middle
the recommender which allows you

00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:08.426 A:middle
to personalize the user

00:10:08.426 --> 00:10:09.656 A:middle
experience of your app into the

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:11.126 A:middle
many, many different ways.

00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:14.366 A:middle
For more information on any of

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:15.726 A:middle
these things, please visit the

00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:17.016 A:middle
website associated to this

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:19.246 A:middle
session, or come talk to us in

00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:20.106 A:middle
the lab tomorrow.

00:10:20.496 --> 00:10:20.876 A:middle
Thank you.

00:10:21.516 --> 00:10:26.506 A:middle
