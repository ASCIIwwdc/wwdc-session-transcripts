[ Applause ]

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:11.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jay.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.456 A:middle
I'm a designer on the Siri and

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:14.186 A:middle
Shortcuts team.

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:15.746 A:middle
And today, we'll be talking

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.036 A:middle
about how to design great

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.786 A:middle
shortcuts for your apps.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.426 A:middle
We're going to cover three main

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.836 A:middle
topics today.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.126 A:middle
First, I'll talk about looking

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:26.306 A:middle
at all the use cases of your

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.936 A:middle
app, and deciding which ones

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.206 A:middle
might make sense as shortcuts.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.345 A:middle
Then, I'll talk about how to

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.056 A:middle
make these shortcuts

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.336 A:middle
discoverable in your apps.

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:37.956 A:middle
And, finally, I'll walk through

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.426 A:middle
how to design a great Siri

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:40.406 A:middle
experience for the new

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.686 A:middle
interactive capabilities of

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.296 A:middle
shortcuts in iOS 13.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:46.526 A:middle
Now, stepping back for a moment,

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.276 A:middle
shortcuts in general are a great

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:49.086 A:middle
way to bring your app's

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:50.356 A:middle
functionality in front of more

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.316 A:middle
users in more places in the OS.

00:00:52.876 --> 00:00:53.836 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:54.696 A:middle
places where your apps'

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.316 A:middle
shortcuts can appear to get a

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:57.536 A:middle
feel for what might be useful.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.516 A:middle
If you tell the system when the

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:02.786 A:middle
user does something in your app,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.156 A:middle
the system can automatically

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:05.416 A:middle
suggest a shortcut when it

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.726 A:middle
predicts the user will next want

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:07.456 A:middle
to do that action.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.386 A:middle
And, these shortcuts can appear

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:10.846 A:middle
in lock screen and search.

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:13.046 A:middle
Here, this shortcut lets you

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.466 A:middle
quickly start a guided workout,

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:15.826 A:middle
you usually do at this time of

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
day.

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
If a user adds a shortcut to

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.926 A:middle
Siri, by assigning it a custom

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:23.566 A:middle
phrase, they can invoke it at

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.966 A:middle
any time with their voice.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.086 A:middle
Here, the shortcut lets them

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.116 A:middle
order their usual dinner.

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:30.306 A:middle
In one quick confirmation step,

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:31.496 A:middle
the user can get some great

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:32.886 A:middle
Mediterranean food.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.646 A:middle
Another great use for shortcuts

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.116 A:middle
with Siri is getting information

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:39.246 A:middle
hands- and eyes-free.

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:42.106 A:middle
So, to your HomePod, if you have

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:43.526 A:middle
a transit app shortcut, you can

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.626 A:middle
say, Hey Siri, bus schedule.

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.516 A:middle
And, Siri will speak out the bus

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:48.686 A:middle
schedule information from your

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:49.000 A:middle
app.

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:53.996 A:middle
And, you can also incorporate

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:55.516 A:middle
your app's functionality as part

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:56.696 A:middle
of a multi-step shortcut.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.596 A:middle
Here, the shortcut handles your

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.366 A:middle
evening routine, ordering soup

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.366 A:middle
evening routine, ordering soup

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:01.626 A:middle
in time for your arrival home,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.326 A:middle
playing your favorite music for

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:04.756 A:middle
your car ride, and showing the

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.486 A:middle
fastest directions.

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:09.836 A:middle
So, looking at these examples,

00:02:10.186 --> 00:02:11.266 A:middle
we can see that shortcuts are

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.486 A:middle
great for accelerating

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.316 A:middle
frequently used, useful actions

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:15.046 A:middle
your app can do.

00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:17.446 A:middle
Presenting information at a

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:20.296 A:middle
glance, or with your voice, or

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.746 A:middle
as building blocks for powerful

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:23.526 A:middle
multi-step shortcuts, where your

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:24.986 A:middle
app can work alongside others.

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.656 A:middle
We introduced Siri shortcut

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.556 A:middle
suggestions in iOS 12, so look

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.366 A:middle
back at past sessions for more

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.746 A:middle
information on how to develop

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:34.726 A:middle
great shortcuts to be

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:36.336 A:middle
automatically suggested on lock

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:37.226 A:middle
screen and search.

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.526 A:middle
Today, I'm going to focus on how

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.626 A:middle
to make shortcuts to take

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:41.826 A:middle
advantage of the new Siri

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.496 A:middle
capabilities in iOS 13.

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:45.416 A:middle
We're going to walk through how

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.756 A:middle
to prioritize the features in

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:47.966 A:middle
your app that might make for

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.026 A:middle
good Siri shortcuts.

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.816 A:middle
To do that, let's take a look at

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.846 A:middle
one of our favorite apps,

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.526 A:middle
SoupChef, which lets you order a

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:56.256 A:middle
wide variety of soups for pickup

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:56.846 A:middle
or delivery.

00:02:57.686 --> 00:02:58.846 A:middle
Let's walk through the design

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
process for making a SoupChef

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
process for making a SoupChef

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:01.286 A:middle
shortcut.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.206 A:middle
List out all the things that

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:05.886 A:middle
your app can do.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.086 A:middle
When doing so, start thinking

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.276 A:middle
about things that a user might

00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:10.426 A:middle
want to repeat with their voice.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.146 A:middle
So, with SoupChef, you can do

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:14.526 A:middle
things like browse the menu of

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:14.846 A:middle
soups.

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:16.256 A:middle
Order a soup.

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:17.816 A:middle
Check your order status, or view

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:18.466 A:middle
past orders.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:20.426 A:middle
Let's take a look at some of

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:20.976 A:middle
these features one by one.

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:26.876 A:middle
Browsing a menu is a very visual

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.046 A:middle
activity that requires a lot of

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.366 A:middle
structured information that

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:30.576 A:middle
won't translate well to voice.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:32.846 A:middle
It requires scrolling, tapping,

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:33.726 A:middle
and navigating.

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.756 A:middle
And, it provides information

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:37.146 A:middle
that isn't likely to change from

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:38.566 A:middle
invocation to invocation.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.626 A:middle
And, it's more of a means to an

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:43.136 A:middle
end, and not a valuable action

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:44.026 A:middle
in and of itself.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.836 A:middle
So, this might not be a good

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:48.466 A:middle
candidate for a shortcut.

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.236 A:middle
Checking an order status could

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:53.366 A:middle
be something a user might want

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.446 A:middle
to do with their voice, getting

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:55.736 A:middle
a quick summary of information

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:56.556 A:middle
from Siri.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:58.846 A:middle
But, it's also only applicable

00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
for a narrow window of time,

00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
for a narrow window of time,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:01.426 A:middle
right after a user's ordered

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:01.826 A:middle
something.

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:04.316 A:middle
So, this is something that you

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:05.726 A:middle
could consider allowing users to

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:07.546 A:middle
turn into a shortcut, but maybe

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:08.956 A:middle
only if your delivery periods

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.076 A:middle
are long, or have multiple

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:10.496 A:middle
phases.

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:15.196 A:middle
And viewing past orders is nice

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:16.245 A:middle
to have, but I don't know about

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:17.586 A:middle
you, I'm not regularly checking

00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:17.805 A:middle
that.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:18.956 A:middle
So, not a great shortcut.

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:24.606 A:middle
Ordering a soup is a very

00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:25.486 A:middle
valuable activity.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.226 A:middle
In fact, the most important

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:28.056 A:middle
activity of your app.

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:29.356 A:middle
And, you can imagine it being

00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:30.856 A:middle
repeatable if a user has a

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:31.966 A:middle
favorite soup.

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:33.876 A:middle
So, let's call this a pretty

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:35.016 A:middle
good candidate for a shortcut.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:39.776 A:middle
So, in summary, a great use for

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:40.926 A:middle
shortcuts will be something that

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.406 A:middle
is valuable, or interesting to

00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:42.736 A:middle
repeat.

00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:45.346 A:middle
Doable with your voice by not

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:46.886 A:middle
relying on visuals or tapping.

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:49.436 A:middle
And, invokable in many contexts.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:50.766 A:middle
So, the shortcut isn't just

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:52.096 A:middle
applicable during a small window

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.146 A:middle
of time.

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:55.526 A:middle
So, now that we know that we

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.036 A:middle
want users to be able to reorder

00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:59.016 A:middle
soup with shortcuts, let's take

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
a look at how we might make that

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
a look at how we might make that

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.206 A:middle
discoverable in your app.

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:03.176 A:middle
We provide a standard Add to

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.606 A:middle
Siri button, that makes it easy

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.096 A:middle
for users to see what features

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:07.566 A:middle
in your app can be turned into a

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:08.226 A:middle
Siri shortcut.

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:09.966 A:middle
But use it thoughtfully.

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:13.156 A:middle
Don't do this, where you put an

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:14.826 A:middle
Add to Siri button on every item

00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:15.556 A:middle
on your main menu.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:17.506 A:middle
As beautiful as the button is on

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:19.146 A:middle
its own, repeating it like this

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.386 A:middle
looks ugly, and it's not really

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:20.976 A:middle
relevant here.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.806 A:middle
The user's probably just trying

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:23.756 A:middle
to make an order in the first

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.066 A:middle
place.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:25.366 A:middle
And, these buttons are getting

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:25.766 A:middle
in the way.

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.196 A:middle
And, these could be items that

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.336 A:middle
the user has never ordered

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:29.786 A:middle
before.

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:31.146 A:middle
So, it doesn't make sense to

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:32.516 A:middle
suggest reordering them just

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:33.226 A:middle
yet.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.976 A:middle
Instead, look at opportunities

00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:36.906 A:middle
where you can present it in a

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.316 A:middle
focused UI, where you have a

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
clear signal that a user might

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.526 A:middle
want to repeat something.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.686 A:middle
For example, it might be better

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:44.936 A:middle
to show an Add to Siri button

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.346 A:middle
right after a user has ordered

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
something.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.716 A:middle
The logic being, if a user's

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:49.796 A:middle
found it good enough to order

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:51.516 A:middle
before, the user's more likely

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:52.466 A:middle
to want to order it again.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.226 A:middle
And, you're not interrupting

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:55.696 A:middle
anything a user's trying to do.

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:56.806 A:middle
They just finished their order,

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.056 A:middle
so this is a good opportunity.

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.676 A:middle
To make the Add to Siri button

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.676 A:middle
To make the Add to Siri button

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:02.846 A:middle
fit in to your app's visual

00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:05.176 A:middle
appearance even better, you can

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:06.896 A:middle
now customize the corner radius

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:07.426 A:middle
of the button.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:11.026 A:middle
And, you can have its appearance

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:12.246 A:middle
automatically change based on

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:13.366 A:middle
the user's light or dark mode

00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:13.716 A:middle
preference.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:16.936 A:middle
Now, if you've tried really

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:18.696 A:middle
hard, like really hard, and the

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:20.226 A:middle
button's visual style doesn't

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:22.006 A:middle
fit into your app, you can make

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:22.696 A:middle
your own button.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:23.886 A:middle
But, you should replicate all of

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:25.236 A:middle
Add to Siri's functionality.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:29.276 A:middle
The standard Add to Siri button

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.926 A:middle
shows the user's shortcut phrase

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:31.606 A:middle
once configured.

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:32.966 A:middle
And, this is a good way to

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:34.326 A:middle
remind the user what they can

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:36.046 A:middle
say to run the shortcut.

00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:38.666 A:middle
Tapping on it will reveal a

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.926 A:middle
standard sheet which allows the

00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:40.726 A:middle
user to edit or delete the

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:40.976 A:middle
shortcut.

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:46.796 A:middle
If you want a centralized place

00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:47.926 A:middle
in your app where you list all

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:49.376 A:middle
your shortcuts, it might be too

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:50.516 A:middle
much to have the Add to Siri

00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:52.336 A:middle
button on every row, like we saw

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:52.716 A:middle
earlier.

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.506 A:middle
So, instead, you're free to use

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:56.746 A:middle
standard UIKit elements.

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.536 A:middle
Just make sure that when a user

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
sets up a shortcut, just like

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
sets up a shortcut, just like

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:03.556 A:middle
the Add to Siri button, you show

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.756 A:middle
the phrase the user has set up

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:05.426 A:middle
the shortcut with.

00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:07.676 A:middle
Tapping on it should also reveal

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:08.816 A:middle
the sheet, where you can edit or

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:09.606 A:middle
delete the shortcut.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.966 A:middle
So, let's get back to users

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.006 A:middle
setting up the shortcut for the

00:07:14.006 --> 00:07:15.156 A:middle
first time.

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:19.166 A:middle
Once the user taps on the Add to

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.496 A:middle
Siri button, they'll see the Add

00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:21.886 A:middle
to Siri sheet, where the user

00:07:21.886 --> 00:07:23.386 A:middle
can choose what phrase to use to

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.436 A:middle
invoke the shortcut.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.696 A:middle
In iOS 13, your app can pre-fill

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:29.356 A:middle
a shortcut of your own choosing.

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.146 A:middle
And, most users will probably

00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.596 A:middle
just assign this phrase if you

00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:34.176 A:middle
provide it, so make sure you

00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:36.906 A:middle
provide a good default.

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
Order Soup is a good, short,

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
memorable phrase in this case,

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.666 A:middle
that the user might want to

00:07:41.746 --> 00:07:42.916 A:middle
genuinely want to use for the

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:43.286 A:middle
shortcut.

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:45.276 A:middle
Let's take a look at another

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:46.316 A:middle
example, and take a break from

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:49.496 A:middle
soup for a while.

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:50.626 A:middle
Checking the bus schedule.

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:52.456 A:middle
While this might look like a

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:53.796 A:middle
sensible phrase, given how

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:55.396 A:middle
relatively short it is, there

00:07:55.396 --> 00:07:56.616 A:middle
are plenty of opportunities for

00:07:56.616 --> 00:07:58.116 A:middle
the user to forget words, or

00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:59.016 A:middle
switch words around.

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:00.946 A:middle
They might try to say, Look up

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:00.946 A:middle
They might try to say, Look up

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
the bus schedule.

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:03.546 A:middle
Or, the bus schedule for the 35.

00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:04.696 A:middle
Or, just drop the "the"

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:05.416 A:middle
altogether.

00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:08.286 A:middle
While Siri will do its best to

00:08:08.286 --> 00:08:10.026 A:middle
match these to the phrase, users

00:08:10.026 --> 00:08:11.216 A:middle
can still get pretty creative

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:12.306 A:middle
when trying to recall longer

00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:12.716 A:middle
phrases.

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.056 A:middle
So, this might not be the best

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:15.776 A:middle
suggested phrase.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:19.666 A:middle
Instead, keep it short, at

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.016 A:middle
around three or fewer words.

00:08:21.526 --> 00:08:22.916 A:middle
Try limiting it to a proper

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.546 A:middle
noun, or just a verb and an

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:24.986 A:middle
object.

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:26.766 A:middle
This reduces the chance that

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.246 A:middle
users will mix up word order, or

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:28.976 A:middle
use different prepositions.

00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:33.486 A:middle
OK.

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:34.506 A:middle
A user wants to set up a

00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:35.635 A:middle
shortcut for ordering tomato

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:35.936 A:middle
soup.

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.056 A:middle
But, what if the user wants the

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:39.056 A:middle
shortcut to do something

00:08:39.056 --> 00:08:40.275 A:middle
slightly different every time,

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:41.736 A:middle
like order a different soup.

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:44.936 A:middle
In iOS 13, users can tap on the

00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:46.716 A:middle
cell under the Do area, and

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:49.176 A:middle
customize how much information

00:08:49.176 --> 00:08:50.506 A:middle
is pre-baked into the shortcut

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.276 A:middle
by simply tapping on one of the

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:53.626 A:middle
fields.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.586 A:middle
The user can choose to leave

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:57.186 A:middle
certain fields blank, like the

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:58.226 A:middle
type of soup itself.

00:08:58.556 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
And, when they do that, Siri can

00:08:58.556 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
And, when they do that, Siri can

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:02.336 A:middle
ask for this missing information

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:03.416 A:middle
on your app's behalf.

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:06.046 A:middle
Now, ideally a shortcut has very

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:06.986 A:middle
minimal interaction.

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:08.746 A:middle
After all, it should accelerate

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:09.856 A:middle
people to something that they do

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:10.386 A:middle
frequently.

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.296 A:middle
So, when you present the ad to

00:09:13.296 --> 00:09:14.846 A:middle
Siri sheet, the action should

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.686 A:middle
include as much information as

00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:18.156 A:middle
possible, to run the shortcut

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.326 A:middle
with just one or two steps.

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:21.616 A:middle
In this case, this shortcut goes

00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:22.646 A:middle
straight to the confirmation

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:23.806 A:middle
screen, because everything is

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:24.666 A:middle
already specified.

00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:27.406 A:middle
But, what happens when a user

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:28.506 A:middle
chooses to leave everything

00:09:28.506 --> 00:09:30.346 A:middle
blank, and wants to specify all

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:31.686 A:middle
of the details of their order in

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:32.786 A:middle
an interaction with Siri?

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:36.746 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:38.266 A:middle
might design a complete ordering

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:38.976 A:middle
soup interaction with Siri.

00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:44.906 A:middle
Think about what information you

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:45.936 A:middle
need to know in order to carry

00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.096 A:middle
out a soup request.

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.696 A:middle
Like, the kind of soup it is.

00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:50.296 A:middle
Whether you're ordering for

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:51.126 A:middle
delivery or pick up?

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:52.256 A:middle
And, if you're ordering for

00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:53.606 A:middle
delivery, what location are you

00:09:53.606 --> 00:09:54.646 A:middle
delivering to, and if you're

00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:55.886 A:middle
ordering for pickup, what you're

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:56.556 A:middle
picking up from.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
To start thinking about the

00:09:58.376 --> 00:09:59.536 A:middle
order and manner in which you

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:00.806 A:middle
might collect this information,

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:00.806 A:middle
might collect this information,

00:10:01.046 --> 00:10:02.016 A:middle
you should think of your app's

00:10:02.016 --> 00:10:03.556 A:middle
interaction as a conversation

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.596 A:middle
between your user and Siri.

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:08.526 A:middle
And, one way to visualize this

00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:10.396 A:middle
conversation is with a script,

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.756 A:middle
which is useful for quickly

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.386 A:middle
jotting down one conversational

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:14.326 A:middle
path.

00:10:15.676 --> 00:10:17.246 A:middle
Of course, there isn't just one

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.216 A:middle
path you can go down.

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:19.666 A:middle
You should write down all of the

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:20.756 A:middle
possible paths in which the

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:21.706 A:middle
conversation might go.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:24.246 A:middle
For example, a user could say an

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:25.546 A:middle
option that's not supported by

00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:25.886 A:middle
your app.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.866 A:middle
In that case, Siri should

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:29.276 A:middle
probably indicate that to the

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:29.956 A:middle
user.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.586 A:middle
Now, handing over a book of

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:34.086 A:middle
scripts might get unwieldy as a

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:36.406 A:middle
design specification, so, at the

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:37.346 A:middle
end of the process, you'll

00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.506 A:middle
probably end up with something

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:40.556 A:middle
more like this; a flow diagram

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:41.776 A:middle
that covers all the possible

00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:43.116 A:middle
states and transitions within a

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:43.766 A:middle
conversation.

00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:46.736 A:middle
Now, there are specific ways

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.326 A:middle
that Siri can present choices,

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:50.226 A:middle
and handle user input, so let's

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:51.036 A:middle
dive straight into the

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:52.816 A:middle
conversational patterns you have

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:53.616 A:middle
at your disposal.

00:10:54.156 --> 00:10:57.286 A:middle
The first pattern that you have

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:58.046 A:middle
is the prompt.

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:00.226 A:middle
This is the most open-ended way

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:00.226 A:middle
This is the most open-ended way

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.686 A:middle
you can collect a value from the

00:11:01.686 --> 00:11:01.986 A:middle
user.

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:04.196 A:middle
You should write your prompt as

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
a question, and phrase it in a

00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:07.326 A:middle
way that sets the user up for a

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:10.726 A:middle
well-formed response.

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
When a user says something that

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:14.086 A:middle
might mean multiple things to

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:15.716 A:middle
your app, you can present an

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:16.926 A:middle
option list which allows the

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.476 A:middle
user to specify which one they

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:18.716 A:middle
meant.

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
This is called a disambiguation

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:21.176 A:middle
prompt.

00:11:22.696 --> 00:11:24.086 A:middle
You can minimize disambiguation

00:11:24.086 --> 00:11:25.536 A:middle
prompts, which add another step

00:11:25.536 --> 00:11:27.516 A:middle
to your conversation, by

00:11:27.516 --> 00:11:28.826 A:middle
presenting an option list up

00:11:28.826 --> 00:11:29.136 A:middle
front.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.336 A:middle
Notice that the user has said

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:32.846 A:middle
their shortcut phrase, Order

00:11:32.846 --> 00:11:34.366 A:middle
Soup, and went straight to the

00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:34.716 A:middle
list.

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:36.996 A:middle
You should use this instead of a

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.506 A:middle
free-form prompt if there's a

00:11:38.506 --> 00:11:39.846 A:middle
constrained list of options to

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:40.306 A:middle
choose from.

00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:42.686 A:middle
Make sure your prompt dialog

00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:44.146 A:middle
encourages choosing from a list.

00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:45.546 A:middle
Questions that start with the

00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:46.886 A:middle
word "which" work really well

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:46.976 A:middle
here.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.476 A:middle
When using s shortcut without a

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:54.156 A:middle
display, Siri will read out

00:11:54.156 --> 00:11:54.706 A:middle
options.

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.026 A:middle
Like on AirPods, on HomePod, or

00:11:57.026 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
when the user says Hey Siri.

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.226 A:middle
And, Siri will read these out as

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:05.076 A:middle
you would provide them in your

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:05.566 A:middle
visual UI.

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:07.786 A:middle
But, you can imagine that this

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:09.246 A:middle
could get verbose, especially if

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:10.136 A:middle
a lot of the options are

00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:10.536 A:middle
similar.

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:13.136 A:middle
To improve this experience, you

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:15.136 A:middle
can separately specify how Siri

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.806 A:middle
reads your options out loud, by

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.276 A:middle
providing pronunciation hits

00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:19.746 A:middle
that you can add to each option.

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:22.136 A:middle
Let's take a look at a slightly

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:22.826 A:middle
different example.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.786 A:middle
The user has asked for Noodle

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:25.316 A:middle
Soup.

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.146 A:middle
And, there are two kinds.

00:12:26.936 --> 00:12:28.026 A:middle
Instead of saying Beef Noodle

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:29.716 A:middle
Soup, or Veggie Noodle Soup, you

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.196 A:middle
might want to just say Beef or

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:31.556 A:middle
Veggie?

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.776 A:middle
So, consider only reading out

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:35.276 A:middle
the details that differentiate

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.806 A:middle
between each item.

00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:39.936 A:middle
Now, conversations are a two-way

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.266 A:middle
street, so you also have to

00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:42.736 A:middle
account for what the user might

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:43.056 A:middle
say.

00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:44.986 A:middle
And, the user may not use the

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:46.216 A:middle
exact words that you've labeled

00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:47.516 A:middle
the option with.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.746 A:middle
To handle natural variations in

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.876 A:middle
responses, for each option, you

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:53.836 A:middle
should provide Siri with

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.226 A:middle
synonyms that mean the same

00:12:55.226 --> 00:12:56.186 A:middle
thing as that option.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.126 A:middle
So, when the user just says

00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.696 A:middle
Beef, it'll match to Beef Noodle

00:12:59.696 --> 00:12:59.966 A:middle
Soup.

00:13:00.456 --> 00:13:02.536 A:middle
When coming up with these

00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:04.026 A:middle
synonyms, you should also keep

00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:05.436 A:middle
in mind that the phrasing of

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:06.386 A:middle
your question impacts the way

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:06.976 A:middle
the user may respond.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:12.956 A:middle
So, if you have a more casual

00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:14.406 A:middle
way of describing the options,

00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:15.766 A:middle
like the one with meat, or the

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:17.586 A:middle
vegetarian one, you should make

00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:19.496 A:middle
sure that you recognize the user

00:13:19.496 --> 00:13:20.646 A:middle
repeating that kind of phrasing

00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:20.976 A:middle
back to Siri.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.476 A:middle
If a user provides a response

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:28.536 A:middle
that you want to be extra sure

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
about, like a value of

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:31.066 A:middle
particularly high consequence,

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:32.816 A:middle
you can provide a parameter

00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:33.806 A:middle
confirmation prompt.

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:35.876 A:middle
But, use this judiciously, and

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:37.276 A:middle
only for truly exceptional

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:38.866 A:middle
cases, as this slows the user

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:39.500 A:middle
down.

00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:43.866 A:middle
One alternative way of using a

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.786 A:middle
parameter confirmation prompt is

00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.276 A:middle
if your app has its own logic

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:48.486 A:middle
for predicting what a user might

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:48.756 A:middle
want.

00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:50.836 A:middle
You can present your best guess

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.126 A:middle
to the user, and they can either

00:13:52.126 --> 00:13:53.906 A:middle
confirm it, in which case, yay,

00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:54.656 A:middle
they don't have to provide

00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:55.496 A:middle
additional details.

00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.756 A:middle
Or, they can deny it, in which

00:13:57.756 --> 00:13:59.256 A:middle
case you can fall back to a more

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:00.036 A:middle
open-ended prompt.

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:00.036 A:middle
open-ended prompt.

00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:02.206 A:middle
If you can guess what the user

00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:03.696 A:middle
wants, it's a great way of

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
making your shortcut interaction

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:04.976 A:middle
even faster.

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:11.476 A:middle
At the end of the flow, consider

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.106 A:middle
using a confirmation prompt that

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:14.406 A:middle
applies to the action as a

00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:16.056 A:middle
whole, particularly if the

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.226 A:middle
action itself is of high

00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:17.756 A:middle
consequence.

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:20.386 A:middle
In this step, you can confirm

00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:21.946 A:middle
all of the details of the action

00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:23.276 A:middle
about to be performed that's

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:24.616 A:middle
relevant to the decision, like

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.316 A:middle
price and delivery time in a

00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:27.826 A:middle
visual user interface that you

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:28.776 A:middle
can fully customize.

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:30.686 A:middle
Note that for actions in the

00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:32.056 A:middle
ordering category, the system

00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:33.556 A:middle
requires the user to confirm.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.036 A:middle
So, make sure, if you fall under

00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:36.556 A:middle
that category, you provide a

00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:37.686 A:middle
great confirmation experience.

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:41.846 A:middle
But, remember that your shortcut

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.506 A:middle
can be run by a user not looking

00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:44.786 A:middle
at a screen, so you should

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:46.286 A:middle
provide dialog for voice-only

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:46.886 A:middle
experiences.

00:14:47.546 --> 00:14:48.926 A:middle
In this case, we provide

00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.526 A:middle
additional dialog to help the

00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:51.316 A:middle
user make a choice.

00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:54.806 A:middle
The purpose of this additional

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:56.666 A:middle
dialog is to provide information

00:14:56.716 --> 00:14:57.706 A:middle
that can't otherwise be

00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:59.026 A:middle
displayed in a visual user

00:14:59.026 --> 00:14:59.406 A:middle
interface.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.696 A:middle
So, think of this extra dialog

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:03.536 A:middle
as a spoken equivalent of the

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:05.116 A:middle
most important information you

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:05.796 A:middle
would otherwise draw in a

00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:05.976 A:middle
display.

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:11.606 A:middle
Finally, your response.

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:13.896 A:middle
Siri will indicate the status of

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:14.366 A:middle
the action.

00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:16.436 A:middle
You can provide a visual UI

00:15:16.436 --> 00:15:17.606 A:middle
summary here to describe

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.196 A:middle
additional details, like who's

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:19.916 A:middle
going to be delivering your

00:15:19.916 --> 00:15:21.586 A:middle
soup, and the latest estimated

00:15:21.586 --> 00:15:22.296 A:middle
delivery time.

00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:24.816 A:middle
Notice that we just say, "OK.

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:25.966 A:middle
Ordered" here, because we're

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.206 A:middle
using a display to show the

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.146 A:middle
additional information.

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:30.656 A:middle
For voice-only experiences, you

00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:31.716 A:middle
should specify a more

00:15:31.716 --> 00:15:32.626 A:middle
descriptive dialog.

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:36.426 A:middle
And, again, think of this extra

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
dialog as a spoken equivalent of

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:39.826 A:middle
the most important information

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:41.166 A:middle
of the response UI you would

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:41.886 A:middle
draw on a display.

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:46.676 A:middle
When you're thinking about your

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:47.936 A:middle
confirmation and response

00:15:47.936 --> 00:15:49.526 A:middle
dialog, you should keep in mind

00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:50.466 A:middle
that you'll need to select a

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:51.806 A:middle
category for your shortcut.

00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:53.726 A:middle
When you define your shortcut in

00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:55.546 A:middle
Xcode, select the category that

00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:56.606 A:middle
is the closet match to your

00:15:56.606 --> 00:15:57.656 A:middle
shortcut's functionality.

00:15:58.386 --> 00:15:59.406 A:middle
In our SoupChef case, it's

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
pretty clear that the order

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
pretty clear that the order

00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:00.976 A:middle
category fits the bill.

00:16:05.576 --> 00:16:07.246 A:middle
In confirmation prompts, Siri

00:16:07.246 --> 00:16:08.186 A:middle
will provide the question

00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:09.566 A:middle
itself, based on the category

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:10.056 A:middle
you select.

00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:12.346 A:middle
So, don't include a question as

00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:13.696 A:middle
part of the confirmation dialog

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:14.676 A:middle
you customize, highlighted in

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:14.966 A:middle
white here.

00:16:19.326 --> 00:16:21.036 A:middle
In response dialog, Siri will

00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:22.146 A:middle
provide a status that is

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.296 A:middle
appropriate to the category.

00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:25.486 A:middle
Your custom dialog gets appended

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:26.826 A:middle
to the end of the dialog Siri

00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:27.246 A:middle
provides.

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:32.106 A:middle
Voice interactions should also

00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:33.716 A:middle
be as robust as possible, to

00:16:33.716 --> 00:16:36.126 A:middle
avoid forcing the user to open

00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:37.616 A:middle
the app to continue manually.

00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:40.156 A:middle
For example, you should provide

00:16:40.206 --> 00:16:41.566 A:middle
clear error messages if a

00:16:41.566 --> 00:16:42.986 A:middle
parameter value is invalid.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:44.916 A:middle
Siri will then automatically

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:46.066 A:middle
re-prompt for that value.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.626 A:middle
You should also avoid getting

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:49.826 A:middle
yourself into this scenario in

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:50.386 A:middle
the first place.

00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:51.936 A:middle
If you're presenting option

00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:53.216 A:middle
lists, make sure you don't

00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:54.326 A:middle
present any options that you

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:56.436 A:middle
know to be invalid at runtime.

00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.156 A:middle
You should also consider

00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.156 A:middle
You should also consider

00:17:00.156 --> 00:17:01.656 A:middle
opportunities to dig users out

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:02.086 A:middle
of holes.

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.306 A:middle
Users may include values like

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:05.326 A:middle
delivery location in their

00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:06.856 A:middle
shortcut, since it's usually

00:17:06.856 --> 00:17:08.286 A:middle
just their home, and so they get

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:09.126 A:middle
used to not saying their

00:17:09.126 --> 00:17:10.715 A:middle
delivery location to Siri.

00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:12.096 A:middle
One day they might use the

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:13.146 A:middle
shortcut when they're far from

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:13.455 A:middle
home.

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:15.066 A:middle
You should check for that case,

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:16.046 A:middle
and prompt for a different

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:16.455 A:middle
location.

00:17:17.695 --> 00:17:19.215 A:middle
And, for whatever reason, users

00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:20.286 A:middle
might want to continue running

00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.576 A:middle
the shortcut in your app.

00:17:22.406 --> 00:17:23.876 A:middle
They can tap anywhere in your UI

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.675 A:middle
to do that.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.806 A:middle
So, when you present UI, keep in

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:28.606 A:middle
mind that the whole area is one

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:30.346 A:middle
big button that opens your app.

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:31.806 A:middle
So, don't draw elements that

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:33.276 A:middle
look individually interactable.

00:17:33.526 --> 00:17:34.046 A:middle
They can't be.

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:37.126 A:middle
Make sure that when a user does

00:17:37.126 --> 00:17:39.076 A:middle
tap this area, your app opens up

00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:40.676 A:middle
to the right place, with all of

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:41.966 A:middle
the information the user has

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:43.346 A:middle
already provided up until that

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:46.726 A:middle
point, filled out in the app.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.946 A:middle
And, finally, we encourage you

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.206 A:middle
to take time when writing

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:50.696 A:middle
dialog.

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:52.316 A:middle
It's not something that you can

00:17:52.316 --> 00:17:53.866 A:middle
just do a quick pass at, to have

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.076 A:middle
something to demo, and then

00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:55.926 A:middle
leave in your final shipping

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:56.296 A:middle
product.

00:17:57.066 --> 00:17:58.856 A:middle
Remember, that in a voice

00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.476 A:middle
interaction, language is the

00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.476 A:middle
interaction, language is the

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:01.216 A:middle
user interface.

00:18:01.856 --> 00:18:03.126 A:middle
So, you should treat the words

00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:04.856 A:middle
in your Siri interaction with as

00:18:04.856 --> 00:18:06.856 A:middle
much respect and care as you do

00:18:06.856 --> 00:18:09.396 A:middle
the pixels in your app.

00:18:09.586 --> 00:18:10.596 A:middle
With that said, let's walk

00:18:10.596 --> 00:18:11.186 A:middle
through a small set of

00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:11.656 A:middle
guidelines.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.066 A:middle
Don't be overly polite or inject

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:16.926 A:middle
too much personality.

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:18.666 A:middle
Users who want to customize

00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:19.866 A:middle
their soup will hear this

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.386 A:middle
non-essential dialog every time

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
they run this shortcut, which

00:18:23.566 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
will get irritating.

00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:27.936 A:middle
When in doubt, test it.

00:18:28.326 --> 00:18:29.766 A:middle
Listen to Siri speak your

00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:30.246 A:middle
dialog.

00:18:30.706 --> 00:18:32.146 A:middle
How does your dialog feel to you

00:18:32.146 --> 00:18:33.396 A:middle
after the third time hearing it?

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:34.666 A:middle
What about the 10th?

00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.186 A:middle
If parts of it feel annoying, it

00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:38.596 A:middle
might be a good signal that you

00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:40.346 A:middle
should reduce the verbosity of

00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:42.976 A:middle
your dialog.

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:44.566 A:middle
Dialog should be concise,

00:18:44.956 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
neutral, and communicate the

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:47.556 A:middle
type of response that you're

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.016 A:middle
expecting.

00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:52.646 A:middle
Don't include your app name in

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:53.276 A:middle
your dialog.

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.006 A:middle
Your app will already be

00:18:56.006 --> 00:18:57.506 A:middle
attributed, visually, via your

00:18:57.506 --> 00:18:58.946 A:middle
confirmation and response UI,

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
and occasionally via Siri's own

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
and occasionally via Siri's own

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:01.556 A:middle
additions.

00:19:01.556 --> 00:19:03.906 A:middle
So, just take your name out.

00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:04.956 A:middle
Don't worry, your brand is safe.

00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:11.116 A:middle
Similarly, you shouldn't include

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
your user's name in your dialog.

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:15.396 A:middle
Siri may at times speak the

00:19:15.396 --> 00:19:17.146 A:middle
user's name on HomePod to verify

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:17.736 A:middle
their identity.

00:19:18.196 --> 00:19:19.706 A:middle
If your app does so as well, it

00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:20.856 A:middle
might sound repetitive and

00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:21.256 A:middle
annoying.

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:25.426 A:middle
So, just take your name out.

00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:28.946 A:middle
Avoid using first-person

00:19:28.946 --> 00:19:30.576 A:middle
pronouns, since Siri isn't

00:19:30.576 --> 00:19:32.086 A:middle
performing the action, your app

00:19:32.086 --> 00:19:32.306 A:middle
is.

00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:34.346 A:middle
It's a subtle distinction, but

00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:35.226 A:middle
it's an important one.

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.736 A:middle
By saying "I" or "we" in Siri's

00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:39.676 A:middle
voice, users might think Siri

00:19:39.676 --> 00:19:41.166 A:middle
has a better understanding of

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:42.316 A:middle
your app's capabilities than it

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.766 A:middle
does, and might try to take

00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:45.476 A:middle
follow-up actions that your app

00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:46.826 A:middle
and Siri can't understand.

00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:51.526 A:middle
Instead, present options

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:53.276 A:middle
neutrally, using words like

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:53.756 A:middle
"here" or "there are a few

00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:53.976 A:middle
options."

00:19:58.346 --> 00:20:01.296 A:middle
So, what have we learned today?

00:19:58.346 --> 00:20:01.296 A:middle
So, what have we learned today?

00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.386 A:middle
Shortcuts are meant to elevate

00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:05.466 A:middle
your app's most repeatable

00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:05.836 A:middle
features.

00:20:06.576 --> 00:20:09.106 A:middle
You should use the Add to Siri

00:20:09.106 --> 00:20:10.956 A:middle
button to make sure users know

00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:12.026 A:middle
what they can turn into a

00:20:12.026 --> 00:20:14.046 A:middle
shortcut from inside your app.

00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:16.636 A:middle
You should make your Siri

00:20:16.636 --> 00:20:18.546 A:middle
interactions logical, concise,

00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:19.286 A:middle
and robust.

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:22.576 A:middle
And, you should take extra care

00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:23.566 A:middle
when writing dialog.

00:20:24.646 --> 00:20:24.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:29.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
