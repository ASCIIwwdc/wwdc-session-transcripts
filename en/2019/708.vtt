[ Applause ]

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:11.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.121 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.436 A:middle
As you just saw, privacy is

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.736 A:middle
something people expect, value,

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.316 A:middle
and make space for every day.

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:23.336 A:middle
I'm Mark from Privacy

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.736 A:middle
Engineering Team at Apple, and

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:26.196 A:middle
with my colleague, Julien, we're

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.926 A:middle
thrilled to tell you today about

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.646 A:middle
designing for privacy on our

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.366 A:middle
platforms and in your

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.156 A:middle
applications.

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:36.126 A:middle
Privacy isn't just about closing

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:36.606 A:middle
doors.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.516 A:middle
It's also about opening doors to

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.086 A:middle
the trust you build with your

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:41.736 A:middle
customers.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.296 A:middle
Customers have let our devices

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:48.586 A:middle
into their homes, captured the

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:50.596 A:middle
memories in their photos,

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:54.486 A:middle
monitor their health, and

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.196 A:middle
transmit their thoughts and

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.356 A:middle
emotions, knowing that they are

00:00:58.356 --> 00:00:59.726 A:middle
in control of their data.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.976 A:middle
As Tim said last year, we at

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.526 A:middle
Apple can and do provide the

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:09.876 A:middle
very best to our users while

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.076 A:middle
treating their most precious

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.776 A:middle
data like the precious cargo

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:13.606 A:middle
that it is.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.066 A:middle
And if we can do it, then every

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.206 A:middle
one of you can, and in today's

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
talk, we'll help you design for

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:21.976 A:middle
privacy.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.406 A:middle
At Apple, privacy starts with

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:29.526 A:middle
data minimization.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.756 A:middle
Examine carefully what data do

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:34.066 A:middle
you need for the functionality

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.806 A:middle
of your app, and what data can

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:36.396 A:middle
you edit out?

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:40.996 A:middle
Some of the most interesting and

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
challenging features use

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:45.356 A:middle
sensitive, personal data, and at

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:47.516 A:middle
Apple, we build these features

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.126 A:middle
with on device intelligence, so

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.396 A:middle
your device personalizes itself

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.756 A:middle
to you, while Apple doesn't

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:55.566 A:middle
collect this data.

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.096 A:middle
When data is shared with Apple,

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.096 A:middle
When data is shared with Apple,

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:01.326 A:middle
we ask the customer.

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.626 A:middle
The customer is always in

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:05.766 A:middle
control, and they always know

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:06.906 A:middle
what's being shared.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:11.706 A:middle
And security is foundational.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:13.946 A:middle
It not only protects people's

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:16.166 A:middle
data on their devices and on our

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.886 A:middle
servers but also enforces both

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:21.356 A:middle
the privacy protections we've

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:23.236 A:middle
built and the choices that

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.836 A:middle
people have made.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:27.856 A:middle
Some companies think that

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.766 A:middle
privacy is just security, that

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.316 A:middle
you can use or collect data so

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.026 A:middle
long as you protect it.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.956 A:middle
But that's short sighted, as

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:37.866 A:middle
security alone isn't adequate in

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.366 A:middle
the long run.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.556 A:middle
You do have a responsibility to

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.416 A:middle
protect the data that you

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.496 A:middle
collect, but it's less risky to

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.866 A:middle
just not collect it in the first

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:46.196 A:middle
place.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:50.236 A:middle
Some other companies define

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.276 A:middle
privacy as just transparency and

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:52.676 A:middle
control.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.026 A:middle
Let users know what you're doing

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.616 A:middle
with their data, and let them

00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:58.216 A:middle
opt out if they don't like it.

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.516 A:middle
But this is privacy after the

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.516 A:middle
But this is privacy after the

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.646 A:middle
fact, and it forces people to

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:06.676 A:middle
choose between privacy and

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:07.286 A:middle
features.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.926 A:middle
And the burden shouldn't be on

00:03:09.926 --> 00:03:12.266 A:middle
individuals to exercise control

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:13.556 A:middle
to get privacy.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:17.176 A:middle
Because privacy is a fundamental

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:17.756 A:middle
human right.

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.036 A:middle
It's essential to the

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:21.666 A:middle
functioning of good societies,

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:24.536 A:middle
and it's too important to not

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.486 A:middle
just work in the technologies

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:27.206 A:middle
that we use.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:30.626 A:middle
That's why at Apple, privacy is

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.376 A:middle
designed into our futures.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.526 A:middle
It's [inaudible] how they work,

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:36.666 A:middle
not something added on at the

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:36.956 A:middle
end.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:40.306 A:middle
At Apple, we challenge ourselves

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.026 A:middle
every day to build great

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.226 A:middle
features with privacy, and we're

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:47.436 A:middle
confident you can too.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.296 A:middle
In the rest of our talk, we'll

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.876 A:middle
explore privacy and the user

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:52.526 A:middle
experience.

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.416 A:middle
Dive into what's new and updated

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:57.566 A:middle
in frameworks, and then we'll

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.426 A:middle
take a step back and show how

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.806 A:middle
you can overcome privacy

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.806 A:middle
you can overcome privacy

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.396 A:middle
challenges through innovation.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.046 A:middle
I'm going to talk about four

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.176 A:middle
user experiences today.

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:12.136 A:middle
First, Sign In with Apple, which

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:12.956 A:middle
allows you to connect your

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
user's experience across

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:16.426 A:middle
platforms without having to

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:17.606 A:middle
store or manage user

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:20.745 A:middle
credentials, and it's a great

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:22.366 A:middle
example of data minimization.

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.206 A:middle
Apple doesn't track how people

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.266 A:middle
use your application because

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.506 A:middle
it's none of our business, and

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.146 A:middle
we've pared down the data that

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.246 A:middle
people share through Sign In

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:34.036 A:middle
with Apple to just what's needed

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.316 A:middle
to sign into your application.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.786 A:middle
So, ask yourself if you really

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.106 A:middle
need the customer's name or

00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:39.876 A:middle
email address.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:42.886 A:middle
If you need a name for billing

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.236 A:middle
or shipping purposes, you can

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:45.506 A:middle
get it later, for example,

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:46.346 A:middle
through Apple Pay.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
And if you don't ask for any

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.996 A:middle
additional data, the user has

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:53.046 A:middle
just one button to tap, and

00:04:53.046 --> 00:04:53.706 A:middle
they're signed into your

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:54.206 A:middle
application.

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.766 A:middle
If you do need to contact the

00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:59.316 A:middle
user, for example, to provide

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:00.536 A:middle
receipts or for account

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:00.536 A:middle
receipts or for account

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:02.916 A:middle
recovery, we provide an easy way

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:03.586 A:middle
for you to do so.

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:07.196 A:middle
People can be hesitant to share

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.336 A:middle
their real email address.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:09.936 A:middle
We've all seen email lists

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:13.686 A:middle
stolen or resold and then abused

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:14.416 A:middle
by spammers.

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:16.526 A:middle
So people may give you a fake

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:18.286 A:middle
email address or one for an

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.396 A:middle
account they never check.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:21.996 A:middle
You could make the user verify

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.616 A:middle
their email at sign-in, but this

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:24.536 A:middle
takes them out of your

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.556 A:middle
application, potentially to

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:27.306 A:middle
[inaudible] their spam folder,

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:28.756 A:middle
and that's not a great

00:05:28.756 --> 00:05:29.386 A:middle
experience.

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:31.796 A:middle
With sign-in with Apple, you

00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:33.526 A:middle
will get a verified email

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:35.526 A:middle
address associated with the

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
user's AppleID.

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:40.036 A:middle
Customers can choose to hide

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.676 A:middle
their email address, in which

00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.056 A:middle
case you'll get an address

00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:45.106 A:middle
managed by Apple through which

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:46.756 A:middle
we relay your emails to the

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.176 A:middle
customer and vice versa.

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.526 A:middle
And Apple won't retain emails

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:52.436 A:middle
after we've delivered them.

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.636 A:middle
For each customer, this managed

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:56.036 A:middle
address is different for each

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.316 A:middle
developer, so customers are in

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.116 A:middle
control of which developers they

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.116 A:middle
control of which developers they

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:02.286 A:middle
want to receive email from, and

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:03.866 A:middle
you're in control of who can

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:05.096 A:middle
send emails to the managed

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.906 A:middle
address we provide you, since

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:08.266 A:middle
you can whitelist domains or

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:09.836 A:middle
addresses that we'll accept

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:10.716 A:middle
incoming mail from.

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:12.946 A:middle
And because both parties are in

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:14.596 A:middle
control, we think this is your

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:16.536 A:middle
best shot at getting your emails

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.726 A:middle
in front of your customer.

00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.306 A:middle
We understand you face

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.966 A:middle
challenges in preventing abuse

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.386 A:middle
and fraud from account farming.

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.966 A:middle
And you may want to ask users to

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:29.336 A:middle
fill out a CAPTCHA such as this.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.466 A:middle
But these are cumbersome, and

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.676 A:middle
they're difficult to localize

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:35.796 A:middle
and make accessible.

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
Other alternatives are invasive

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:39.316 A:middle
to user's privacy, such as

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.716 A:middle
trying to reidentify them with

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:41.716 A:middle
personally identifiable

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:43.496 A:middle
information or fingerprinting.

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:46.436 A:middle
With Sign In with Apple, we can

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:48.956 A:middle
leverage on-device intelligence

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.466 A:middle
to provide you with one bit that

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:53.126 A:middle
indicates a user is likely real.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:56.016 A:middle
And this flag is supported on

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.626 A:middle
iOS, and we provide it at

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.426 A:middle
account creation.

00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:03.296 A:middle
The real user status property of

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.336 A:middle
ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential

00:07:05.656 --> 00:07:06.776 A:middle
is how you check for this bit.

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:09.546 A:middle
And keep in mind that a new user

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:11.596 A:middle
on a new phone will likely show

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:13.326 A:middle
up as status unknown, so you

00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:14.676 A:middle
shouldn't just deny service if

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:16.386 A:middle
you see this state and provide

00:07:16.386 --> 00:07:17.796 A:middle
the user and ultimate flow or a

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:19.236 A:middle
way to appeal this

00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:19.756 A:middle
determination.

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:23.516 A:middle
So that was Sign In with Apple,

00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:25.576 A:middle
a great privacy friendly single

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:26.346 A:middle
sign on solution.

00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:29.356 A:middle
Now, let's talk about location.

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.046 A:middle
People are protective of where

00:07:32.046 --> 00:07:33.606 A:middle
they are and where they've been.

00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:38.126 A:middle
It reveals where we live, places

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:40.116 A:middle
we frequent, our patterns of

00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:41.466 A:middle
life, and when those patterns

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:42.056 A:middle
change.

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.186 A:middle
Like if you start attending a

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:45.436 A:middle
different set of afterparties

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:46.756 A:middle
this year with a different crowd

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:47.076 A:middle
of people.

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:49.836 A:middle
And in iOS 13, we're making

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.836 A:middle
changes to help users exercise

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.986 A:middle
smarter control over when

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:55.056 A:middle
they're sharing their location.

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.796 A:middle
Previously in iOS, there was a

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:00.576 A:middle
one-time prompt for location

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:00.576 A:middle
one-time prompt for location

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:03.646 A:middle
permissions, and at this point,

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:04.876 A:middle
the user hasn't experienced

00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:07.386 A:middle
location in your app before.

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.936 A:middle
So they may select don't allow

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.696 A:middle
and miss out on the value that

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:11.996 A:middle
location can provide in your

00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:12.546 A:middle
application.

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:14.976 A:middle
And while many of you have built

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.706 A:middle
experiences to explain your use

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.276 A:middle
of location before asking,

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:20.206 A:middle
nothing explains better than

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:20.916 A:middle
using your app.

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:23.956 A:middle
So, in iOS 13 were introducing a

00:08:23.956 --> 00:08:27.686 A:middle
new option, Allow Once, giving

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
users the ability to try out

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.336 A:middle
location in your application

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.176 A:middle
before committing to a decision.

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:36.446 A:middle
If the user selects Allow Once,

00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:38.056 A:middle
your app will have access to

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
location, just as if the user

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:42.126 A:middle
had selected While in Use up

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:43.515 A:middle
until the system no longer

00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:45.116 A:middle
considers your app in use.

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:46.766 A:middle
The next time the user launches

00:08:46.766 --> 00:08:47.786 A:middle
your app, they'll be asked

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:49.816 A:middle
again, and if they want to give

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.026 A:middle
you app access without being

00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:52.476 A:middle
asked, they can grant While in

00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:53.736 A:middle
Use when they're comfortable

00:08:53.736 --> 00:08:54.196 A:middle
doing so.

00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:56.666 A:middle
What about Always?

00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:58.756 A:middle
The ability to access a user's

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:00.296 A:middle
location always is a very

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:00.296 A:middle
location always is a very

00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:02.246 A:middle
powerful capability, and you

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:03.776 A:middle
just may be surprised if your

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.396 A:middle
app asks for it right away

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:06.836 A:middle
before you've had a chance to

00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:08.086 A:middle
demonstrate your app's value,

00:09:09.046 --> 00:09:10.106 A:middle
the value of location in your

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.816 A:middle
app's value, or why you need it

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:12.956 A:middle
in the background when they're

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:15.736 A:middle
currently using your app.

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:18.326 A:middle
Location prompts in app will now

00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:21.086 A:middle
always be for just once or While

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:21.526 A:middle
in Use.

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:25.536 A:middle
If you do request Always, we'll

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:27.296 A:middle
show the same prompt and defer

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.506 A:middle
asking for Always.

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.686 A:middle
And if a user selects While in

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:33.786 A:middle
Use, your delegate object will

00:09:33.786 --> 00:09:35.556 A:middle
be told you're authorized for

00:09:35.556 --> 00:09:36.006 A:middle
always.

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:38.566 A:middle
And iOS will continue to

00:09:38.566 --> 00:09:40.336 A:middle
generate Always location events

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:41.226 A:middle
for your app, just as it did

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:41.646 A:middle
before.

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:45.046 A:middle
Before we deliver the first

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:46.386 A:middle
Always location event to your

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.666 A:middle
application, we'll then prompt

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.276 A:middle
the user to upgrade from While

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:52.896 A:middle
in Use to Always, and you'll

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:54.226 A:middle
only get the location event if

00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:55.666 A:middle
the user grants us permission.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.836 A:middle
We'll only ask users while

00:09:58.836 --> 00:09:59.986 A:middle
they're on the home screen, not

00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:00.706 A:middle
while they're in another

00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:00.706 A:middle
while they're in another

00:10:00.706 --> 00:10:02.416 A:middle
application, so this may not

00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
happen immediately.

00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:06.886 A:middle
To provide increased

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:08.916 A:middle
transparency, we'll periodically

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:10.526 A:middle
remind the user that your app is

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:11.706 A:middle
accessing location in the

00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:12.196 A:middle
background.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.176 A:middle
And shortly after upgrade to iOS

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.196 A:middle
13, we'll remind the user for

00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
all existing apps with Always

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:18.976 A:middle
access.

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:23.586 A:middle
The good news is, there are no

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:25.716 A:middle
capability breaking API changes,

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:27.546 A:middle
but you should test for the new

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:29.476 A:middle
Allow Once and Always behaviors

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.106 A:middle
to ensure that your app handles

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:32.036 A:middle
these state transitions

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:32.456 A:middle
gracefully.

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:35.516 A:middle
And if you do use Always data,

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.046 A:middle
now is a good time to ensure

00:10:37.046 --> 00:10:38.686 A:middle
that your use of Always provides

00:10:38.686 --> 00:10:39.696 A:middle
clear user value.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:42.076 A:middle
We think these contextual

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.736 A:middle
prompts will help users make

00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:45.736 A:middle
informed, smarter choices about

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:46.646 A:middle
when they're sharing their

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.106 A:middle
location.

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:49.736 A:middle
Come talk to us at our lab if

00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:51.286 A:middle
you have any questions, check

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.566 A:middle
out the video from What's New in

00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:54.296 A:middle
Core Location session in the

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:56.026 A:middle
WWDC app or the Core Location

00:10:56.026 --> 00:11:00.696 A:middle
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third

00:10:56.026 --> 00:11:00.696 A:middle
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third

00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:01.886 A:middle
user experience I'm going to

00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:03.306 A:middle
talk about is Bluetooth.

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:05.836 A:middle
You used to only need user

00:11:05.836 --> 00:11:07.336 A:middle
consent if you wanted to share

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:08.626 A:middle
information using

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.986 A:middle
CoreBluetooth's peripheral

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:13.716 A:middle
manager APIs in the background.

00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.256 A:middle
IOS 13 will now require user

00:11:15.256 --> 00:11:17.046 A:middle
consent if your application uses

00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:20.136 A:middle
any CoreBluetooth APIs, and this

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:21.556 A:middle
applies to apps linked against

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.966 A:middle
older SDKs as well.

00:11:24.686 --> 00:11:26.276 A:middle
You should provide an

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:27.736 A:middle
NSBluetoothAlwaysUsage

00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:29.006 A:middle
Description purpose string in

00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:31.356 A:middle
your Info.plist to help users

00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:33.336 A:middle
understand what your app needs

00:11:33.396 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
Bluetooth for and so they can

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.976 A:middle
make an informed choice, and

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:38.946 A:middle
this will be required for all

00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:41.156 A:middle
apps linked on or after IOS 13,

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.356 A:middle
or your app will crash.

00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:44.926 A:middle
Please refer to our talk last

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:46.216 A:middle
year for tips on how to write a

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:49.326 A:middle
great purpose string.

00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:50.316 A:middle
Adoption is easy.

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.886 A:middle
If the user hasn't previously

00:11:52.886 --> 00:11:54.546 A:middle
granted permission, then when

00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:56.236 A:middle
your app instantiates a CB

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:58.006 A:middle
peripheral or central manager

00:11:58.006 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
object, iOS will ask the user if

00:11:58.006 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
object, iOS will ask the user if

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.206 A:middle
they want to allow your app to

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:03.656 A:middle
access Bluetooth APIs.

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.106 A:middle
And you can check the new

00:12:06.106 --> 00:12:07.746 A:middle
authorization property on the

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.076 A:middle
central and peripheral manager

00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:10.646 A:middle
objects for your current

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.556 A:middle
authorization state.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.426 A:middle
For more information, please

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:15.766 A:middle
check out what's new in

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:20.436 A:middle
CoreBluetooth Friday at 3:20.

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.016 A:middle
The last user [inaudible] change

00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:23.606 A:middle
is on macOS Catalina, where

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:26.226 A:middle
we're adding user consent for

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.736 A:middle
more types of functionality and

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:27.986 A:middle
data.

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:31.206 A:middle
Last year in macOS Mohave, we

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:32.956 A:middle
protected these resources on the

00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:34.796 A:middle
file system and required user

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.016 A:middle
consent to access them.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.006 A:middle
This year we're adding

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.766 A:middle
protection to the Desktop,

00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:41.026 A:middle
Documents, and Downloads

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.796 A:middle
folders, iCloud Drive and

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.416 A:middle
Third-Party Cloud Storage as

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:46.686 A:middle
well as Network and Removable

00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:47.186 A:middle
Volumes.

00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:50.746 A:middle
In addition, the camera and

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.106 A:middle
microphone controls introduce

00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:54.446 A:middle
macOS Mohave or infusing screen

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:56.206 A:middle
recording and keyboard input

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:58.466 A:middle
monitoring in macOS Catalina as

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:00.536 A:middle
well as user control over

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:00.536 A:middle
well as user control over

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.936 A:middle
synthetic input events and

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:02.676 A:middle
AppleEvents.

00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:05.416 A:middle
For more information, check out

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:07.006 A:middle
advances in macOS security

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:09.346 A:middle
session in the WWDC app or their

00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:13.936 A:middle
lab tomorrow at 2 p.m. Next, I

00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:16.636 A:middle
have three new frameworks with

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:17.506 A:middle
new behaviors.

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:21.606 A:middle
First, I have some exciting news

00:13:21.606 --> 00:13:22.586 A:middle
for web developers.

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.476 A:middle
We introduced Intelligent

00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
Tracking Prevention, ITP, two

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.626 A:middle
years ago, to protect against

00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:31.056 A:middle
cross-site user tracking.

00:13:31.966 --> 00:13:33.886 A:middle
On by default in Safari, it's

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:35.816 A:middle
had a big impact, and we're

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.206 A:middle
thrilled to see other browsers

00:13:37.206 --> 00:13:38.966 A:middle
adopt similar techniques and

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:40.326 A:middle
build consensus against

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:41.156 A:middle
cross-site tracking.

00:13:42.966 --> 00:13:44.556 A:middle
We don't, however, believe that

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.426 A:middle
a web without free of tracking

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:48.406 A:middle
is necessarily a web without

00:13:48.406 --> 00:13:49.266 A:middle
advertisements.

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.856 A:middle
And last year we took a first

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:53.036 A:middle
step in building privacy

00:13:53.036 --> 00:13:54.676 A:middle
friendly ad infrastructure with

00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:56.716 A:middle
installed validation, which

00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:57.966 A:middle
allows developers to measure

00:13:57.966 --> 00:13:59.896 A:middle
conversions from advertisements

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.016 A:middle
to app installs.

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.016 A:middle
to app installs.

00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:03.606 A:middle
This year, we're tackling the

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:04.486 A:middle
web.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.266 A:middle
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.636 A:middle
Attribution is a new way for

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:11.016 A:middle
advertisers and merchants on the

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.806 A:middle
web to measure the success of

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:14.576 A:middle
their ad campaigns without

00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:15.966 A:middle
tracking individual users.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.956 A:middle
Let's say they sell running

00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:20.136 A:middle
shoes on SneakerNet.

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.866 A:middle
I buy ads on search.example, and

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:26.036 A:middle
I want to know how effective

00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:27.546 A:middle
those ads are at driving visits

00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:28.606 A:middle
and purchases to my site.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.606 A:middle
This used to be done through

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:33.356 A:middle
cross-site tracking, which ITP

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:34.196 A:middle
now blocks.

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:38.226 A:middle
In Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:14:38.226 --> 00:14:40.436 A:middle
Attribution, Safari connects

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:43.946 A:middle
clicks on ads with conversions

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:47.666 A:middle
on the merchant and reports

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:48.936 A:middle
these attributions to the ad

00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:49.536 A:middle
provider.

00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:52.266 A:middle
Let's walk through how this

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:54.036 A:middle
happens.

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.256 A:middle
Now when a user clicks on an ad

00:14:56.256 --> 00:14:57.256 A:middle
on search.example for

00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.936 A:middle
SneakerNet, Safari will remember

00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
this for seven days.

00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
this for seven days.

00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:04.736 A:middle
And in that seven-day window, if

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:06.026 A:middle
the user makes a purchase on

00:15:06.026 --> 00:15:08.046 A:middle
SneakerNet, the merchant or

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.936 A:middle
advertiser can identify this as

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.986 A:middle
a potential conversion, and

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:13.736 A:middle
Safari will connect this

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:15.326 A:middle
potential conversion with a

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:17.136 A:middle
previously stored ad clicks and

00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:19.796 A:middle
record that conversion did occur

00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:22.456 A:middle
from search.example to

00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:24.456 A:middle
SneakerNet.

00:15:24.636 --> 00:15:25.836 A:middle
Safari will then report this

00:15:25.836 --> 00:15:27.316 A:middle
conversion as a delayed

00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:28.256 A:middle
ephemeral post the

00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:29.836 A:middle
search.example.

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:32.526 A:middle
Adoption is easy.

00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:34.636 A:middle
The ad provider just needs to

00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:36.236 A:middle
decorate their outgoing link

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:37.806 A:middle
anchor tags with two new

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:40.406 A:middle
attributes, adDestination, the

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.456 A:middle
site where you expect

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.536 A:middle
conversions to occur.

00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:46.846 A:middle
Here, SneakerNet.example and the

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:47.826 A:middle
adCampaignID.

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:50.346 A:middle
Search.example might be running

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:51.846 A:middle
many concurrent ad campaigns for

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:54.096 A:middle
SneakerNet, and the CampaignID

00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:55.056 A:middle
allows you to measure them

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:55.496 A:middle
separately.

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:59.206 A:middle
We can detect conversions

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:00.656 A:middle
without any change on the

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:00.656 A:middle
without any change on the

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:02.186 A:middle
merchant site by leverage

00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:06.016 A:middle
existing tracking pixels, which

00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:07.306 A:middle
a search provider can then

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.716 A:middle
redirect the server side to a

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:11.286 A:middle
well-known URL that identifies

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:12.846 A:middle
the ConversionID as a past

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:13.266 A:middle
component.

00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:16.306 A:middle
Conversions can be anything from

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:17.506 A:middle
putting an item in a shopping

00:16:17.506 --> 00:16:19.696 A:middle
cart, to creating an account, to

00:16:19.696 --> 00:16:21.426 A:middle
making a purchase, and the

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:23.036 A:middle
ConversionID allows the merchant

00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:24.466 A:middle
to distinguish between these

00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:26.416 A:middle
different Conversion events.

00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:29.786 A:middle
To preserve the user's privacy,

00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:31.956 A:middle
Safari limits the Campaign and

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:33.976 A:middle
ConversionIDs each to 64

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:34.866 A:middle
possible values.

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:36.966 A:middle
So, each conversion between an

00:16:36.966 --> 00:16:39.016 A:middle
advertiser and merchant can only

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:40.786 A:middle
be linked to 1 of 4000 possible

00:16:40.786 --> 00:16:40.976 A:middle
values.

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.276 A:middle
Safari will wait 24 to 48 hours

00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:46.356 A:middle
before reporting this

00:16:46.356 --> 00:16:48.506 A:middle
attribution, both to aggregate

00:16:48.506 --> 00:16:49.996 A:middle
multiple Clicks and Conversions

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:52.076 A:middle
and to prevent correlation with

00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.826 A:middle
user activity on either site.

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:57.036 A:middle
The Conversion attribution will

00:16:57.036 --> 00:16:58.236 A:middle
be reported in an ephemeral

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
session without any cookies.

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
session without any cookies.

00:17:01.076 --> 00:17:02.896 A:middle
And Clicks and Conversions are

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.286 A:middle
not recorded in private

00:17:04.346 --> 00:17:04.685 A:middle
browsing.

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:09.016 A:middle
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:11.526 A:middle
Attribution is available to try

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:13.526 A:middle
out in Safari Technology Preview

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:13.786 A:middle
83.

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.156 A:middle
It will be on by default in iOS

00:17:16.156 --> 00:17:18.896 A:middle
13 and macOS Catalina, and we've

00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:20.646 A:middle
submitted to W3C for

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:21.996 A:middle
consideration as a web standard.

00:17:21.996 --> 00:17:24.136 A:middle
And you can see more details at

00:17:24.136 --> 00:17:25.705 A:middle
webkit.org/blog.

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:29.866 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk about

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.276 A:middle
the Speech Recognizer framework,

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.796 A:middle
which allows you to transcribe

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:34.216 A:middle
audio.

00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:36.876 A:middle
We've heard many requests for a

00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
way to perform transcription

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.866 A:middle
locally, and this is especially

00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:41.156 A:middle
helpful in regulated

00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:42.306 A:middle
environments such as healthcare.

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:46.116 A:middle
In iOS 13, we're introducing

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.976 A:middle
offline transcription, so you

00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:49.736 A:middle
can transcribe audio without

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.216 A:middle
internet connectivity and

00:17:51.216 --> 00:17:52.376 A:middle
without sending potentially

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:53.946 A:middle
sensitive audio off device.

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:57.086 A:middle
To adopt, you can check

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.726 A:middle
isAvailableForLocal Recognition

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:01.686 A:middle
on Speech Recognizer and specify

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:01.686 A:middle
on Speech Recognizer and specify

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:03.846 A:middle
requiresLocalRecognition when

00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:05.336 A:middle
creating a speech recognition

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:05.866 A:middle
request.

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:10.876 A:middle
Third, we have new ways for test

00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:12.166 A:middle
users to provide feedback in

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:12.616 A:middle
TextFlight.

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:15.026 A:middle
We understand as app developers

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:16.416 A:middle
it's really important to

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:18.356 A:middle
understand exactly where users

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.646 A:middle
are running into issues in your

00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:21.286 A:middle
app, and we want to help you

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:22.936 A:middle
learn from your test users while

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:23.926 A:middle
preserving their privacy.

00:18:25.596 --> 00:18:26.996 A:middle
So in iOS 13, we're introducing

00:18:26.996 --> 00:18:28.576 A:middle
the ability for TextFlight users

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:30.626 A:middle
to submit screen shots directly

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:31.976 A:middle
from the Screenshot UI through

00:18:32.126 --> 00:18:32.756 A:middle
TextFlight.

00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:35.416 A:middle
They can also now send feedback

00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:37.686 A:middle
along with crash reports so you

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:39.396 A:middle
can understand exactly what they

00:18:39.396 --> 00:18:40.546 A:middle
were doing at the time of the

00:18:40.546 --> 00:18:42.636 A:middle
particular crash.

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:44.406 A:middle
Testers are in control of

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
sharing data from their device,

00:18:47.016 --> 00:18:48.126 A:middle
and this is available in

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:51.226 A:middle
TextFlight 2.3 on iOS 13 and you

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:52.496 A:middle
can give feedback in App Store

00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:52.756 A:middle
Connect.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.026 A:middle
For more information, please

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:56.396 A:middle
check out What's New in App

00:18:56.396 --> 00:19:00.386 A:middle
Store Connect in the WWDC app.

00:18:56.396 --> 00:19:00.386 A:middle
Store Connect in the WWDC app.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:01.446 A:middle
Now, I'm going to turn it over

00:19:01.446 --> 00:19:02.816 A:middle
to my colleague, Julien, to talk

00:19:02.816 --> 00:19:04.226 A:middle
about privacy updates.

00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:08.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:09.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mark.

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:13.756 A:middle
In this next section, let's talk

00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:15.596 A:middle
about privacy updates to

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:16.626 A:middle
existing APIs.

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:19.956 A:middle
We go through a series of five

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.086 A:middle
updates in rapid fashion.

00:19:22.686 --> 00:19:25.916 A:middle
First, CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo.

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:29.126 A:middle
The CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API

00:19:29.676 --> 00:19:31.936 A:middle
returns the name and Mac address

00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:34.026 A:middle
of the Wi-Fi access point a

00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:35.996 A:middle
device is currently connected

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:36.206 A:middle
to.

00:19:37.166 --> 00:19:40.176 A:middle
This affects privacy as a Wi-Fi

00:19:40.176 --> 00:19:42.616 A:middle
access point reveals a user's

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:43.006 A:middle
location.

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:48.056 A:middle
Starting in iOS 13, CNCopy will

00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:50.856 A:middle
only work for certain categories

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.726 A:middle
of apps, apps that declared the

00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:57.196 A:middle
CNCopy entitlement and apps that

00:19:57.646 --> 00:20:00.006 A:middle
configured a virtual private

00:19:57.646 --> 00:20:00.006 A:middle
configured a virtual private

00:20:00.056 --> 00:20:00.436 A:middle
network.

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:03.536 A:middle
Or apps that configured a Wi-Fi

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.516 A:middle
network using the

00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:07.886 A:middle
NEHotspotConfiguration API or

00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:09.916 A:middle
apps that obtain location

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:11.466 A:middle
permission from the user.

00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:14.016 A:middle
What this means for you is that

00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:15.876 A:middle
you may not be able to access

00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:17.266 A:middle
CNCopy anymore.

00:20:18.506 --> 00:20:20.036 A:middle
You can find out more details

00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:21.526 A:middle
about this in the networking

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.726 A:middle
sessions listed below.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.626 A:middle
Second, contacts access.

00:20:27.306 --> 00:20:30.376 A:middle
Starting in iOS 13, apps that

00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:32.216 A:middle
have been authorized by a user

00:20:32.406 --> 00:20:34.546 A:middle
to access contacts will no

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:36.706 A:middle
longer have access to the notes

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.916 A:middle
field of a contact.

00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:40.966 A:middle
The notes field of a contact

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.316 A:middle
potentially includes sensitive

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:45.476 A:middle
details such as sneaky comments

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:46.376 A:middle
about your boss.

00:20:47.316 --> 00:20:49.046 A:middle
Most apps do not need access to

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:49.466 A:middle
this data.

00:20:50.156 --> 00:20:52.096 A:middle
If you believe you need access

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.816 A:middle
to it, please file an

00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:55.216 A:middle
entitlement request at the

00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:56.306 A:middle
following URL.

00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
Third, Custom URL Schemes.

00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
Third, Custom URL Schemes.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.156 A:middle
Previously, if your app was

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:05.556 A:middle
launched by a Custom URL Scheme,

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:08.356 A:middle
you could identify the app that

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:10.586 A:middle
launched you via an option of

00:21:10.626 --> 00:21:11.586 A:middle
open URL.

00:21:12.716 --> 00:21:14.556 A:middle
This revealed applications

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:16.256 A:middle
installed on a user's device.

00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:20.016 A:middle
Starting in iOS 13, the source

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:22.466 A:middle
application is only revealed to

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:24.276 A:middle
apps from the same developer.

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:27.446 A:middle
Fourth, Game Center.

00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:30.336 A:middle
In order to improve player

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:33.696 A:middle
privacy, Game Center introduces

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.656 A:middle
two new APIs.

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:38.606 A:middle
The teamPlayerID for a

00:21:38.706 --> 00:21:40.626 A:middle
team-scoped player identifier

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:42.336 A:middle
and the gamePlayerID for a

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:44.266 A:middle
game-scoped player identifier.

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.146 A:middle
The existing playerID identifier

00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:48.606 A:middle
is being deprecated.

00:21:49.656 --> 00:21:51.836 A:middle
This changes which identifier

00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:53.516 A:middle
you may use in your gaming app.

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:56.096 A:middle
For more information, please

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.746 A:middle
check out the Game Center video

00:21:57.946 --> 00:21:59.726 A:middle
in the WWDC app.

00:22:00.096 --> 00:22:01.986 A:middle
And five, contextual

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:02.956 A:middle
information.

00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:06.586 A:middle
IOS doesn't know when your app

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.616 A:middle
is most helpful to users.

00:22:09.656 --> 00:22:11.646 A:middle
You can provide contextual

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:13.986 A:middle
information, entry point into

00:22:13.986 --> 00:22:17.546 A:middle
your app via two main APIs,

00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:19.966 A:middle
NSUserActivity, to promote your

00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:23.156 A:middle
app in Search results, and

00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:25.236 A:middle
SiriKit INInteraction to promote

00:22:25.236 --> 00:22:26.686 A:middle
your app on on-device

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.456 A:middle
intelligent scenarios such as

00:22:28.726 --> 00:22:31.516 A:middle
Maps Shortcuts and new this year

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.206 A:middle
in the Share Sheet.

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:35.356 A:middle
If you do promote your app, be a

00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:35.916 A:middle
good sport.

00:22:36.676 --> 00:22:38.336 A:middle
Delete content that was removed

00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:38.826 A:middle
from your app.

00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:41.606 A:middle
You don't want Siri Shortcuts to

00:22:41.606 --> 00:22:43.336 A:middle
make a suggestion to content

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:44.676 A:middle
that does not exist anymore.

00:22:45.386 --> 00:22:47.246 A:middle
Simply call the corresponding

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:49.516 A:middle
deletion APIs.

00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:50.616 A:middle
We just went through a series a

00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:53.146 A:middle
five privacy updates to existing

00:22:53.146 --> 00:22:53.426 A:middle
APIs.

00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:56.436 A:middle
In our next section, we take a

00:22:56.436 --> 00:22:57.836 A:middle
step back.

00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.746 A:middle
We discuss how a privacy

00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.746 A:middle
We discuss how a privacy

00:23:00.786 --> 00:23:03.476 A:middle
challenge can be a chance to

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:04.066 A:middle
innovate.

00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:07.226 A:middle
Privacy is fundamental to the

00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:08.766 A:middle
design of every product.

00:23:09.186 --> 00:23:11.126 A:middle
At Apple, in the Privacy Team,

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.866 A:middle
we work with engineers all

00:23:12.866 --> 00:23:15.266 A:middle
across Apple to build privacy

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:16.336 A:middle
into our products.

00:23:17.926 --> 00:23:20.666 A:middle
Once in a while, we hit a very

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.546 A:middle
hard problem, a feature that we

00:23:23.546 --> 00:23:25.406 A:middle
really want to ship, but it's

00:23:25.406 --> 00:23:27.276 A:middle
not obvious how to protect

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:28.076 A:middle
privacy.

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.676 A:middle
So when that happens, we decide

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:32.836 A:middle
to challenge ourselves.

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.006 A:middle
We aim to build a great feature

00:23:35.226 --> 00:23:36.756 A:middle
without giving away user

00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:38.926 A:middle
information, so we lean on our

00:23:38.926 --> 00:23:41.646 A:middle
privacy principles to find

00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:43.406 A:middle
solutions and innovate.

00:23:44.686 --> 00:23:46.786 A:middle
Today, we want to inspire you to

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:47.306 A:middle
do the same.

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:49.686 A:middle
Let's look at three critical

00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:51.346 A:middle
areas of the user experience,

00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:54.676 A:middle
Machine Learning, Find My, and

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:54.896 A:middle
Home.

00:23:56.026 --> 00:23:57.366 A:middle
Let's start with Machine

00:23:57.366 --> 00:23:57.616 A:middle
Learning.

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.196 A:middle
There are many ways to build

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.196 A:middle
There are many ways to build

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
Machine Learning applications.

00:24:02.446 --> 00:24:04.656 A:middle
Usually we need to train a model

00:24:05.096 --> 00:24:06.326 A:middle
and then evaluate it.

00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:09.006 A:middle
So the first privacy challenge

00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:11.436 A:middle
with Machine Learning is how to

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:13.536 A:middle
train a machine learning model

00:24:14.216 --> 00:24:16.086 A:middle
but without collecting sensitive

00:24:16.216 --> 00:24:18.886 A:middle
user data while personalizing

00:24:18.886 --> 00:24:21.396 A:middle
the model to every user and

00:24:22.076 --> 00:24:24.066 A:middle
significantly improving the user

00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:24.516 A:middle
experience.

00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:27.106 A:middle
And again, it usually starts

00:24:27.176 --> 00:24:29.606 A:middle
with data, and it's usually a

00:24:29.606 --> 00:24:30.616 A:middle
lot of data.

00:24:31.946 --> 00:24:33.326 A:middle
And it can be challenging to

00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:33.866 A:middle
find data.

00:24:33.866 --> 00:24:35.686 A:middle
There are multiple options.

00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:38.556 A:middle
The first option is to collect

00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:39.426 A:middle
data from users.

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:42.686 A:middle
So to protect user privacy, it's

00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:44.796 A:middle
important to apply best privacy

00:24:44.906 --> 00:24:46.956 A:middle
practices such as randomizing

00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.826 A:middle
identifiers, rounding or

00:24:48.826 --> 00:24:49.456 A:middle
sampling.

00:24:50.416 --> 00:24:53.466 A:middle
But sometimes data is inherently

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.866 A:middle
sensitive, like the picture of

00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:56.626 A:middle
user's face.

00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:59.286 A:middle
A second option is to run a user

00:24:59.286 --> 00:24:59.656 A:middle
study.

00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:03.826 A:middle
We invite select users to test

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:05.606 A:middle
or feature in private and

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:06.546 A:middle
collect their data.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:09.456 A:middle
We did this ourselves to train

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:10.226 A:middle
Face ID.

00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:13.286 A:middle
Finally, their external

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:13.956 A:middle
datasets.

00:25:14.786 --> 00:25:16.286 A:middle
Some are publicly available for

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:17.246 A:middle
research purposes.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.416 A:middle
Others require careful

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:21.186 A:middle
collaboration with other

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.766 A:middle
companies and raise their own

00:25:23.976 --> 00:25:24.896 A:middle
privacy challenges.

00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:28.696 A:middle
Once you have data, you can

00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:29.306 A:middle
train a model.

00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:32.186 A:middle
You can, for example, use Create

00:25:32.186 --> 00:25:32.306 A:middle
ML.

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:35.416 A:middle
A train model is great for most

00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.926 A:middle
users, but users are different,

00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:39.976 A:middle
each with their own needs.

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.166 A:middle
What if you needed to tailor, to

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:45.546 A:middle
personalize a model to specific

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:46.336 A:middle
users?

00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:49.086 A:middle
This year, we introduce

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.316 A:middle
updatable Core ML models.

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:53.876 A:middle
Send your updatable model to the

00:25:53.876 --> 00:25:54.236 A:middle
device.

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.316 A:middle
An updatable model takes in

00:25:57.316 --> 00:25:59.126 A:middle
training data from the user and

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
produces a new personalized

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
produces a new personalized

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:01.936 A:middle
model.

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.376 A:middle
We do this ourselves with Face

00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:04.786 A:middle
ID.

00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:07.436 A:middle
Face ID automatically adjusts to

00:26:07.436 --> 00:26:08.006 A:middle
your appearance.

00:26:08.806 --> 00:26:10.906 A:middle
If you grow a beard or grow

00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:13.146 A:middle
longer hair, Face ID still

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:13.876 A:middle
recognizes you.

00:26:14.026 --> 00:26:15.876 A:middle
And this all happens on the

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:16.146 A:middle
device.

00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:19.976 A:middle
Training uses resources though,

00:26:20.526 --> 00:26:22.656 A:middle
and it may affect a user

00:26:23.326 --> 00:26:24.056 A:middle
experience.

00:26:24.206 --> 00:26:25.366 A:middle
While there's a new Background

00:26:25.366 --> 00:26:27.606 A:middle
Task API that allows you to

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:29.536 A:middle
schedule machine learning tasks

00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:32.406 A:middle
in the background, we recommend

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:34.746 A:middle
scheduling a task within a week

00:26:34.746 --> 00:26:35.096 A:middle
or less.

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:38.526 A:middle
If you choose a date too far

00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:40.876 A:middle
into the future, iOS may not

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.266 A:middle
schedule it.

00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:43.706 A:middle
You can learn more about the

00:26:43.706 --> 00:26:45.276 A:middle
Background Task API in our

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:45.906 A:middle
session below.

00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:50.126 A:middle
But sometimes, we need more than

00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:51.016 A:middle
one user's data.

00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:54.026 A:middle
We need data from many different

00:26:54.026 --> 00:26:54.586 A:middle
users.

00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:57.676 A:middle
Today, I want to share with you

00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:00.296 A:middle
a new technique that we are

00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:00.296 A:middle
a new technique that we are

00:27:00.296 --> 00:27:00.876 A:middle
developing.

00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
This is an example of how we

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:06.386 A:middle
innovate in privacy for machine

00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:06.626 A:middle
learning.

00:27:07.656 --> 00:27:09.906 A:middle
Federated Learning is a new

00:27:09.906 --> 00:27:11.236 A:middle
approach that is picking up

00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:12.596 A:middle
steam in the machine learning

00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:13.096 A:middle
community.

00:27:13.736 --> 00:27:15.806 A:middle
Today, we're introducing Private

00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:18.136 A:middle
Federated Learning by combining

00:27:18.316 --> 00:27:19.816 A:middle
Federated Learning with

00:27:19.816 --> 00:27:21.016 A:middle
differential privacy.

00:27:21.736 --> 00:27:25.406 A:middle
The idea is simple, instead of

00:27:25.446 --> 00:27:27.826 A:middle
collecting user data with

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:30.066 A:middle
Private Federated Learning, we

00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:31.986 A:middle
collect model updates.

00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:35.636 A:middle
In other words, devices tell the

00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:38.006 A:middle
server how a machine learning

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:40.166 A:middle
model should be updated.

00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:42.786 A:middle
Let's walk through an example.

00:27:43.726 --> 00:27:46.336 A:middle
It all starts with the server

00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:48.136 A:middle
giving devices an original

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:48.556 A:middle
model.

00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:50.506 A:middle
We show it in white here.

00:27:51.326 --> 00:27:53.376 A:middle
Each device trains the model

00:27:53.446 --> 00:27:55.846 A:middle
under local data and obtains a

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:56.326 A:middle
new model.

00:27:57.436 --> 00:27:58.976 A:middle
We show it here by changing the

00:27:58.976 --> 00:27:59.266 A:middle
color.

00:27:59.696 --> 00:28:00.986 A:middle
They compute the difference

00:27:59.696 --> 00:28:00.986 A:middle
They compute the difference

00:28:01.136 --> 00:28:02.996 A:middle
between this new model and the

00:28:02.996 --> 00:28:04.836 A:middle
original one and send these

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:06.846 A:middle
model updates back to Apple

00:28:06.846 --> 00:28:07.396 A:middle
servers.

00:28:09.466 --> 00:28:11.076 A:middle
The server aggregates these

00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:13.046 A:middle
model updates into a new

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:15.216 A:middle
enhanced machine learning model

00:28:15.626 --> 00:28:16.506 A:middle
that we show here with a

00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:17.336 A:middle
gradient color.

00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:20.826 A:middle
Note that in this process no

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:23.276 A:middle
user data is sent in plain, and

00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:24.856 A:middle
we have no needs for any user or

00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:26.056 A:middle
device identifiers.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:28.976 A:middle
The server then updates the

00:28:28.976 --> 00:28:30.686 A:middle
devices back with a new model,

00:28:31.266 --> 00:28:33.386 A:middle
and this cycle can go back and

00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:35.256 A:middle
forth between the devices and

00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:35.656 A:middle
the server.

00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:38.646 A:middle
From a privacy perspective, we

00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:40.206 A:middle
need to analyze whether those

00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:42.686 A:middle
model updates include sensitive

00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:43.176 A:middle
data.

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:46.056 A:middle
It's often considered that model

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:46.986 A:middle
updates are fine.

00:28:47.216 --> 00:28:48.566 A:middle
They're not plain user data.

00:28:49.576 --> 00:28:52.016 A:middle
But unfortunately, in some

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:54.846 A:middle
corner cases, a curious server

00:28:55.446 --> 00:28:57.866 A:middle
could attempt to reconstruct the

00:28:57.866 --> 00:28:59.806 A:middle
user data from model updates.

00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:02.686 A:middle
For example, here, if a user

00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:04.766 A:middle
sent model updates relative to

00:29:04.766 --> 00:29:07.446 A:middle
this castle, a curious server

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:09.926 A:middle
may be able to reconstruct the

00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:11.776 A:middle
castle image from the model

00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:12.046 A:middle
update.

00:29:12.736 --> 00:29:15.136 A:middle
So, to prevent this, we protect

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:18.236 A:middle
model updates using on device

00:29:18.366 --> 00:29:20.356 A:middle
and on the server Separated

00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.026 A:middle
Differential Privacy and Central

00:29:23.506 --> 00:29:24.766 A:middle
Differential Privacy.

00:29:25.886 --> 00:29:28.246 A:middle
Differential Privacy adds noise

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:29.546 A:middle
to the model updates.

00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:32.186 A:middle
This ensures that a curious

00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:35.086 A:middle
server cannot reconstruct the

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:35.676 A:middle
image anymore.

00:29:36.496 --> 00:29:38.946 A:middle
You can find more details about

00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:40.586 A:middle
how we use Separated

00:29:40.586 --> 00:29:42.016 A:middle
Differential Privacy in the

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:44.796 A:middle
paper below that we wrote.

00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:47.146 A:middle
Private Federated Learning can

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.156 A:middle
be used to improve on-device

00:29:49.296 --> 00:29:49.966 A:middle
intelligence.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.246 A:middle
This is not a research

00:29:52.246 --> 00:29:52.796 A:middle
experiment.

00:29:53.536 --> 00:29:54.666 A:middle
We are starting to use this

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:56.596 A:middle
technology in iOS 13 in a

00:29:56.596 --> 00:29:58.706 A:middle
variety of use cases including

00:29:58.706 --> 00:30:00.646 A:middle
QuickType keyboard, personalized

00:29:58.706 --> 00:30:00.646 A:middle
QuickType keyboard, personalized

00:30:00.646 --> 00:30:02.126 A:middle
Hey Siri, and more in the

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:02.496 A:middle
future.

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:07.266 A:middle
Once you train a model, you want

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:07.666 A:middle
to use it.

00:30:08.346 --> 00:30:10.606 A:middle
This raises the second privacy

00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:11.986 A:middle
challenge with machine learning.

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:15.616 A:middle
How to evaluate a model without

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:18.156 A:middle
collecting user data in a fast

00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:20.166 A:middle
way and without suffering from

00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:21.406 A:middle
Internet connection delays.

00:30:21.406 --> 00:30:24.546 A:middle
The first way that comes to mind

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.576 A:middle
is to simply send user data to

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:28.166 A:middle
the server, evaluate the model

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.376 A:middle
there, and get back the

00:30:29.376 --> 00:30:30.046 A:middle
inference.

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.616 A:middle
But this means sending more user

00:30:32.616 --> 00:30:33.536 A:middle
data to the server.

00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:36.236 A:middle
Instead, we prefer on-device

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:36.896 A:middle
intelligence.

00:30:37.406 --> 00:30:38.706 A:middle
We send a model down to the

00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:39.216 A:middle
device.

00:30:39.666 --> 00:30:41.286 A:middle
The device evaluates it locally.

00:30:42.166 --> 00:30:43.586 A:middle
This has a lot of advantages.

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:45.376 A:middle
It's less data sent to the

00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:46.016 A:middle
servers.

00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:47.966 A:middle
It works even if you don't have

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:49.696 A:middle
Internet, and it's fast if you

00:30:49.776 --> 00:30:51.186 A:middle
use Core ML.

00:30:51.496 --> 00:30:54.546 A:middle
Core ML is optimized to run fast

00:30:54.826 --> 00:30:56.986 A:middle
on iOS devices and others.

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:59.246 A:middle
It's easy to convert your

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.286 A:middle
existing model to a Core ML

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.286 A:middle
existing model to a Core ML

00:31:01.466 --> 00:31:04.396 A:middle
model, and this year, we expand

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:05.316 A:middle
the number of model

00:31:05.316 --> 00:31:07.046 A:middle
architectures that are

00:31:07.046 --> 00:31:07.686 A:middle
supported.

00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:09.886 A:middle
You can learn more in the Core

00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:13.016 A:middle
ML session listed below.

00:31:13.366 --> 00:31:15.496 A:middle
On-device intelligence provides

00:31:15.756 --> 00:31:19.506 A:middle
strong privacy advantages, and

00:31:19.506 --> 00:31:21.386 A:middle
we like to communicate those

00:31:21.386 --> 00:31:23.256 A:middle
advantages to our users in the

00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:25.986 A:middle
form of privacy assurances.

00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:29.376 A:middle
A privacy assurance is a simple

00:31:29.446 --> 00:31:31.696 A:middle
privacy sentence that we share

00:31:31.936 --> 00:31:32.696 A:middle
with our users.

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.896 A:middle
This is not a privacy policy

00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:35.556 A:middle
with legalese.

00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:38.596 A:middle
For example, with Face ID, we

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:41.726 A:middle
say, Face ID data never leaves

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:42.296 A:middle
the device.

00:31:43.476 --> 00:31:44.816 A:middle
This is a clear and strong

00:31:44.816 --> 00:31:47.066 A:middle
statement about our approach to

00:31:47.066 --> 00:31:48.526 A:middle
privacy with Face ID.

00:31:48.926 --> 00:31:51.696 A:middle
It's easy for all users to

00:31:52.376 --> 00:31:53.036 A:middle
understand.

00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:54.916 A:middle
All right, this was machine

00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:55.246 A:middle
learning.

00:31:56.396 --> 00:31:59.206 A:middle
Let's talk about Find My next.

00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:01.396 A:middle
This year we announced a new

00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:01.396 A:middle
This year we announced a new

00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:03.426 A:middle
Find My application that merges

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:05.806 A:middle
the Find My Friends and the Find

00:32:05.916 --> 00:32:07.706 A:middle
My iPhone apps.

00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:09.666 A:middle
One feature that we were very

00:32:09.666 --> 00:32:11.876 A:middle
excited about is the offline

00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:12.696 A:middle
finding feature.

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:14.936 A:middle
Here's a challenge that was

00:32:14.936 --> 00:32:16.096 A:middle
brought to our attention.

00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:19.636 A:middle
A user forgot their MacBook at

00:32:19.636 --> 00:32:20.476 A:middle
the public library.

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:24.176 A:middle
The user realizes that, launches

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.036 A:middle
the new Find My app and attempts

00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:28.756 A:middle
to find the MacBook, but it may

00:32:28.756 --> 00:32:30.726 A:middle
not work because the MacBook is

00:32:30.726 --> 00:32:33.736 A:middle
not connected to the Internet.

00:32:33.736 --> 00:32:35.186 A:middle
So the privacy challenge is

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:38.356 A:middle
support finding devices between

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:41.266 A:middle
Mac and iPhone or a Watch that

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:43.316 A:middle
is, even when it's not connected

00:32:43.526 --> 00:32:44.656 A:middle
to the Internet when it's

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:47.266 A:middle
offline while protecting the

00:32:47.296 --> 00:32:50.256 A:middle
privacy of the lost devices but

00:32:50.256 --> 00:32:52.266 A:middle
also of anyone that would help

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:54.166 A:middle
you find those lost devices and

00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.106 A:middle
making sure that Apple doesn't

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:58.166 A:middle
learn anything in the process.

00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
And, of course, with limited

00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
And, of course, with limited

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.066 A:middle
impact on the battery life.

00:33:02.986 --> 00:33:04.056 A:middle
This was a long list of

00:33:04.056 --> 00:33:05.936 A:middle
challenges, and so the idea for

00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:07.336 A:middle
us was to rely on crowd

00:33:07.336 --> 00:33:07.846 A:middle
sourcing.

00:33:08.756 --> 00:33:10.846 A:middle
We wanted to make it easy to

00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:12.826 A:middle
detect a lost MacBook via

00:33:12.826 --> 00:33:14.746 A:middle
Bluetooth and report its

00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:16.096 A:middle
location to Apple servers.

00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:18.706 A:middle
But we couldn't rely on a static

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:20.126 A:middle
identifier broadcast over

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:20.536 A:middle
Bluetooth.

00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:23.276 A:middle
A static identifier could allow

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.856 A:middle
anyone to track any device at

00:33:25.856 --> 00:33:27.856 A:middle
any time, and we couldn't do

00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:29.106 A:middle
that.

00:33:29.336 --> 00:33:32.426 A:middle
Instead, the MacBook broadcasts

00:33:32.756 --> 00:33:35.146 A:middle
and ephemeral public encryption

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:35.316 A:middle
key.

00:33:36.526 --> 00:33:39.106 A:middle
This key changes over time.

00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:43.036 A:middle
Any nearby phone can receive

00:33:43.036 --> 00:33:44.646 A:middle
over Bluetooth this encryption

00:33:44.646 --> 00:33:46.796 A:middle
key, compute their own location,

00:33:47.056 --> 00:33:48.446 A:middle
and encrypt it with the

00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:49.126 A:middle
encryption key.

00:33:50.326 --> 00:33:52.116 A:middle
Then, this encrypted data can be

00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:53.626 A:middle
submitted to Apple servers.

00:33:54.476 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
Note here that since location is

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:59.356 A:middle
encrypted, Apple cannot see it.

00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:01.266 A:middle
Also, note that no information

00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:01.266 A:middle
Also, note that no information

00:34:01.266 --> 00:34:02.506 A:middle
is provided about the nearby

00:34:02.506 --> 00:34:04.036 A:middle
phone that helped find the lost

00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:04.506 A:middle
device.

00:34:05.186 --> 00:34:07.916 A:middle
Finally, the owner can ask Apple

00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:09.716 A:middle
later on for the corresponding

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:11.996 A:middle
encrypted data, decrypt it to

00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:14.085 A:middle
obtain the location to its lost

00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:14.716 A:middle
device.

00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:17.666 A:middle
With this proposal, we can share

00:34:17.926 --> 00:34:19.806 A:middle
the following privacy assurance

00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:20.766 A:middle
with our users.

00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:24.565 A:middle
Apple does not know the location

00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:26.775 A:middle
of any offline devices or

00:34:26.775 --> 00:34:27.576 A:middle
finders.

00:34:28.426 --> 00:34:29.706 A:middle
This is a big result.

00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:31.706 A:middle
We found a way to design a

00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:34.186 A:middle
fantastic feature with industry

00:34:34.295 --> 00:34:35.446 A:middle
leading privacy.

00:34:36.045 --> 00:34:41.156 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the Home.

00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:44.616 A:middle
The Home is a safe place, and

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:45.976 A:middle
important place for all of us.

00:34:46.656 --> 00:34:48.416 A:middle
It's a safe place we go to after

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:50.085 A:middle
work or after a long day at

00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:52.856 A:middle
WWDC, and as the popularity of

00:34:52.926 --> 00:34:55.746 A:middle
Smart homes increases, so does

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:57.836 A:middle
new privacy threats emerge.

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.846 A:middle
Many customers have concerns

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.846 A:middle
Many customers have concerns

00:35:00.996 --> 00:35:02.526 A:middle
about Smart home accessories,

00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:04.996 A:middle
and nothing is more sensitive

00:35:05.406 --> 00:35:07.456 A:middle
than security cameras in the

00:35:07.456 --> 00:35:07.656 A:middle
home.

00:35:08.786 --> 00:35:10.446 A:middle
So the privacy challenge here is

00:35:10.706 --> 00:35:12.856 A:middle
allowing users to view their

00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:15.356 A:middle
security cameras from anywhere

00:35:16.146 --> 00:35:18.216 A:middle
while allowing no one else to

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.696 A:middle
access the video feed, not even

00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:23.416 A:middle
Apple, and still enabling Smart

00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.006 A:middle
camera experiences.

00:35:26.086 --> 00:35:27.266 A:middle
So we worked with camera

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:29.206 A:middle
providers on two main things.

00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:32.466 A:middle
First, we rely on on-device

00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:34.366 A:middle
intelligence to do computer

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:36.636 A:middle
vision in the home on the home

00:35:36.856 --> 00:35:38.206 A:middle
resident device.

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:41.596 A:middle
Be it a HomePod, an Apple TV, or

00:35:41.596 --> 00:35:44.576 A:middle
an iPad, we detect people and

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.736 A:middle
objects directly in the home,

00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:48.296 A:middle
not in the Cloud.

00:35:49.456 --> 00:35:51.596 A:middle
Second, we store camera

00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:53.256 A:middle
recordings in an end-to-end

00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:54.046 A:middle
encrypted manner.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:57.776 A:middle
This means only you can see the

00:35:57.816 --> 00:36:00.276 A:middle
content from your camera, and we

00:35:57.816 --> 00:36:00.276 A:middle
content from your camera, and we

00:36:00.276 --> 00:36:01.626 A:middle
can make the following privacy

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:02.176 A:middle
assurance.

00:36:03.076 --> 00:36:05.536 A:middle
Only you can see the video from

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:06.236 A:middle
your camera.

00:36:07.056 --> 00:36:08.306 A:middle
Short and sweet.

00:36:09.206 --> 00:36:11.016 A:middle
It's time to wrap up the privacy

00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:11.426 A:middle
session.

00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.766 A:middle
We talked about three privacy

00:36:13.766 --> 00:36:15.626 A:middle
challenges and showed you how we

00:36:15.626 --> 00:36:16.176 A:middle
solved them.

00:36:16.866 --> 00:36:18.886 A:middle
Throughout this presentation, we

00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:21.166 A:middle
also talked about API updates

00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:22.456 A:middle
and new features that we

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:25.416 A:middle
designed with privacy.

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:28.146 A:middle
Every year, every release, with

00:36:28.146 --> 00:36:30.776 A:middle
every product we challenge

00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:32.786 A:middle
ourselves to build great

00:36:32.886 --> 00:36:35.216 A:middle
features without giving away

00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:36.216 A:middle
user information.

00:36:37.266 --> 00:36:39.326 A:middle
Because privacy is fundamental

00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:40.996 A:middle
to the design of every product,

00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
we share privacy assurances with

00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:44.846 A:middle
our users.

00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:48.376 A:middle
Simple sentences about our

00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:50.626 A:middle
commitment to protect user

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:51.106 A:middle
privacy.

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.186 A:middle
There are three things we want

00:36:54.186 --> 00:36:55.626 A:middle
you to remember today.

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.316 A:middle
First, among the first questions

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:01.056 A:middle
you should ask yourselves when

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:01.056 A:middle
you should ask yourselves when

00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:02.996 A:middle
working on a new project is how

00:37:02.996 --> 00:37:05.086 A:middle
you will protect user data.

00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:08.546 A:middle
Ask what you should do, not what

00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:11.026 A:middle
you can do with your app.

00:37:11.386 --> 00:37:13.996 A:middle
Earn the trust of your users by

00:37:13.996 --> 00:37:16.266 A:middle
making it easy for them to know

00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:18.126 A:middle
that their privacy is protected

00:37:18.176 --> 00:37:20.006 A:middle
in your app.

00:37:20.456 --> 00:37:22.846 A:middle
Second, if you face a tough

00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.106 A:middle
privacy problem, challenge

00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:26.776 A:middle
yourself to find a solution.

00:37:28.106 --> 00:37:30.766 A:middle
Privacy is a chance to innovate.

00:37:31.566 --> 00:37:33.316 A:middle
Find a way to deliver your

00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:36.106 A:middle
feature without giving away more

00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:36.666 A:middle
user data.

00:37:38.176 --> 00:37:40.496 A:middle
And third, privacy is an

00:37:40.496 --> 00:37:42.896 A:middle
opportunity to engage with your

00:37:42.896 --> 00:37:43.436 A:middle
users.

00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:47.206 A:middle
Privacy is about people.

00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:51.156 A:middle
Don't let a privacy policy take

00:37:51.156 --> 00:37:51.946 A:middle
that away from you.

00:37:52.656 --> 00:37:54.416 A:middle
Share your privacy assurances

00:37:54.776 --> 00:37:55.706 A:middle
with your users.

00:37:56.716 --> 00:37:58.246 A:middle
If you have any more questions,

00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:00.106 A:middle
please join us in the privacy

00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:00.106 A:middle
please join us in the privacy

00:38:00.106 --> 00:38:01.676 A:middle
lab right after this talk.

00:38:02.286 --> 00:38:03.866 A:middle
On behalf of the entire privacy

00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:05.546 A:middle
team, thank you very much for

00:38:05.546 --> 00:38:06.226 A:middle
joining us today.

00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:11.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
