00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:09.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good evening, developers, and

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.376 A:middle
welcome to the 2019 Apple Design

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:13.666 A:middle
Awards.

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:16.065 A:middle
Now, here's your host, Senior

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.286 A:middle
Director of Evangelism, John

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:18.906 A:middle
Geleynse.

[ Music ]

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Well, hello, and

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:30.806 A:middle
welcome to another Apple Design

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:31.176 A:middle
Awards.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:32.936 A:middle
Thanks for joining us this

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:34.606 A:middle
afternoon, especially after a

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:36.756 A:middle
long, but exciting day.

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:39.116 A:middle
And I just want to particularly

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.716 A:middle
thank all of you who have joined

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.016 A:middle
us from around the world online

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:44.296 A:middle
on the live stream for the

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:45.246 A:middle
ceremony right now.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.266 A:middle
We've got a huge group.

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:52.046 A:middle
You know, it's great for us to

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:53.626 A:middle
join as a community, and gather

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.856 A:middle
like this to take a few moments

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.686 A:middle
to celebrate and acknowledge

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.356 A:middle
excellence in innovation and

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.356 A:middle
excellence in innovation and

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:00.756 A:middle
design.

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.386 A:middle
Because at Apple, we've been

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.306 A:middle
awarding excellent design for

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.666 A:middle
more than two decades now.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:09.886 A:middle
What started originally as the

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.556 A:middle
Apple Human Interface Design

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:13.196 A:middle
Excellence Awards, or HIDE

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:15.396 A:middle
Awards for short, was renamed a

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.606 A:middle
few years later to what is now

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.456 A:middle
known as the Apple Design

00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:20.000 A:middle
Awards.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.676 A:middle
You know, the world around us is

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.856 A:middle
stunningly beautiful, and as

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:29.616 A:middle
humans, we're attracted to

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.436 A:middle
beautiful things, and to

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:33.476 A:middle
incredible designs.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:36.806 A:middle
We're drawn to these things, and

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.496 A:middle
we respond to them deeply.

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.056 A:middle
And at Apple, we believe the

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:43.466 A:middle
true -- the beauty -- that

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.916 A:middle
beautiful design is both

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.936 A:middle
appearance and function, and

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.796 A:middle
something that works well with

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:51.416 A:middle
each component deeply

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.046 A:middle
considered, and each aspect

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.326 A:middle
carefully crafted -- that that

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:56.986 A:middle
can be profoundly beautiful.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.936 A:middle
And so, simply judging something

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.146 A:middle
by how it looks isn't enough.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.146 A:middle
by how it looks isn't enough.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.356 A:middle
It's how it works.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.746 A:middle
It has to work as beautifully as

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:10.425 A:middle
it looks, and great design

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.126 A:middle
reflects the broader definition

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:12.946 A:middle
of beauty.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.486 A:middle
And it runs deeper than the

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:16.066 A:middle
interface.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.136 A:middle
It's coherent, and it's

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.116 A:middle
cohesive.

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:21.446 A:middle
And it helps us to engage with

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:23.276 A:middle
each other in new, and

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.176 A:middle
innovative, and life-enhancing

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:27.556 A:middle
ways, and like compelling

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:29.966 A:middle
beauty, great design draws us

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:30.736 A:middle
in.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.836 A:middle
And the Apple Design Awards have

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:35.306 A:middle
always been about this --

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.026 A:middle
recognizing great design, and

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.526 A:middle
then celebrating the developers

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.486 A:middle
who positively impact everyone

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:44.226 A:middle
else, and real people with the

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.196 A:middle
things that they create, the

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:47.546 A:middle
things that you create.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.116 A:middle
Now, we select our winners each

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:53.476 A:middle
year by evaluating them in

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:56.000 A:middle
basically three key areas.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:58.616 A:middle
The first area is design.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:01.836 A:middle
We're looking for apps that are

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.586 A:middle
-- that have strong visual

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
design, that are efficient and

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.366 A:middle
easy to use, that have great

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:12.336 A:middle
game play, that have attention

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:15.136 A:middle
to detail and polish, that are

00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:16.636 A:middle
internally coherent.

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:19.876 A:middle
On the technology front, we're

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.486 A:middle
evaluating technology usage, and

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:23.636 A:middle
so we're looking for apps that

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.096 A:middle
are fast and responsive.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.216 A:middle
We're looking for apps that take

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:28.946 A:middle
full advantage of all of the

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:30.186 A:middle
capabilities of our latest

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:32.506 A:middle
devices, and we're looking for

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:34.926 A:middle
apps that use the latest Apple

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.686 A:middle
technologies to do really great

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:38.466 A:middle
new things.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.836 A:middle
And on the innovation front,

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.216 A:middle
we're looking for brilliance.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:47.306 A:middle
We're looking for new ideas.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.296 A:middle
We're looking for uniqueness,

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:54.476 A:middle
platform differentiation, and

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
things that just weren't

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:56.666 A:middle
possible before.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:59.996 A:middle
And the developers of our

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:02.116 A:middle
winning apps this evening have

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:02.116 A:middle
winning apps this evening have

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.276 A:middle
done an outstanding job, and

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.086 A:middle
outstanding work in these three

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:09.106 A:middle
areas, and more, and we want to

00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:10.096 A:middle
honor that work.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:12.266 A:middle
We want to acknowledge the

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.766 A:middle
distinct joy and the challenges

00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:16.466 A:middle
of the app creation process that

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.706 A:middle
we're all so familiar with.

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.426 A:middle
We want to honor the endless

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
hours, the late nights, and the

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.886 A:middle
dedication that goes into the

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:26.006 A:middle
pursuit of excellence.

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.706 A:middle
We want to recognize the

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:32.196 A:middle
dead-ends, and the frustration,

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
and the exhaustion sometimes

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:37.626 A:middle
that often goes unseen, and

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:38.786 A:middle
we're all familiar with that.

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.066 A:middle
And we want to honor the

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.086 A:middle
unconventional thinking, the

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
creativity, and the new ideas

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:48.176 A:middle
that lead to breakthroughs and

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.496 A:middle
innovative solutions.

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:51.216 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:53.936 A:middle
Winners tonight are going to win

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:55.956 A:middle
some pretty great -- some pretty

00:04:55.956 --> 00:04:58.846 A:middle
amazing prizes, and each prize

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.206 A:middle
package includes a 512 gigabyte

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.206 A:middle
package includes a 512 gigabyte

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.446 A:middle
iPhone XS with a set of AirPods,

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:09.456 A:middle
a 512 gigabyte 12.9-inch iPad

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
Pro with Apple Pencil 2,

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:18.646 A:middle
a 64 gigabyte 4K Apple TV, an

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.346 A:middle
Apple Watch Series 4,

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:27.066 A:middle
a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro,

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:30.786 A:middle
and a fully-loaded iMac Pro.

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.306 A:middle
In addition --

00:05:36.346 --> 00:05:37.606 A:middle
in addition -- and this is what

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:41.136 A:middle
all of you want -- each winner

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.786 A:middle
will -- each winning develop --

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:43.946 A:middle
each winning app will be

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.246 A:middle
highlighted on the App Store,

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.066 A:middle
similar to what we did last year

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:48.406 A:middle
on the Today tab for the Apple

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:49.776 A:middle
Design Award winners, and what

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:51.016 A:middle
we did throughout the year

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.506 A:middle
following the ceremony.

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:53.906 A:middle
So this year's winners will be

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:55.456 A:middle
highlighted in prominent ways on

00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:56.246 A:middle
the App Stores.

00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:58.546 A:middle
And lastly, each winner will

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.076 A:middle
take home one of the coveted

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.076 A:middle
take home one of the coveted

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:01.636 A:middle
Apple Design Award trophies,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:06.776 A:middle
except that we thought it was

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.016 A:middle
time for a refresh.

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:11.476 A:middle
And so, we have a completely new

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.466 A:middle
trophy this year, redesigned

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.036 A:middle
from the Apple Design Team.

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:17.146 A:middle
It retains the integrity and

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:18.596 A:middle
recognizable qualities of the

00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:21.166 A:middle
original award, but reinterprets

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:22.786 A:middle
these with the qualities of our

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:23.706 A:middle
latest products.

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:26.596 A:middle
It's made out of 100% recycled

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:27.686 A:middle
aluminum, and featured a

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:29.986 A:middle
mirror-finished stainless steel

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.766 A:middle
Apple logo inlay.

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:33.966 A:middle
It's pretty sweet, if you ask

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:34.330 A:middle
me.

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:37.326 A:middle
All right.

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:41.326 A:middle
So we have nine -- we have nine

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.546 A:middle
winners today, and each winner

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:45.336 A:middle
will be announced and demoed by

00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:46.706 A:middle
a colleague -- by colleagues of

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.576 A:middle
mine from the Apple -- from the

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.446 A:middle
-- from Apple's World Wide

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:50.896 A:middle
Developer Relations Team.

00:06:51.196 --> 00:06:52.706 A:middle
Now, a little bit differently

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:54.316 A:middle
than other years -- if we

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:55.846 A:middle
announce your app, if we

00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:57.566 A:middle
announce you as a winner, please

00:06:57.606 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
stay in your seat because we're

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
going to first talk about your

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
going to first talk about your

00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:02.456 A:middle
app, and explain it to the

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.296 A:middle
community.

00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:04.816 A:middle
And we're going to demo it, and

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.436 A:middle
when we've completed the demo,

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:07.616 A:middle
we're going to call you forward

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:09.236 A:middle
on stage, and ask that you'd

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:10.576 A:middle
come up on stage using these

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:13.506 A:middle
stairs here at this location.

What we love about this game is

00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.296 A:middle
that it's intuitive enough so

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:48.376 A:middle
you simply start playing, and it

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:50.076 A:middle
introduces rules and challenges

gradually as you go through the

00:08:53.176 --> 00:08:54.986 A:middle
It uses colors to communicate

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:55.936 A:middle
the roles of each element.

They are immersive, consistent,

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.786 A:middle
yet also distinct from each

and satisfaction is very well

00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:23.386 A:middle

off.

But the heart of this interface

00:14:26.086 --> 00:14:27.256 A:middle
is changing the color.

00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:29.636 A:middle
You adjust the value on the side

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.896 A:middle
here on the right, swipe side to

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.506 A:middle
side to adjust saturation, and

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.646 A:middle
color by just spinning the color

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:39.926 A:middle
And check out how all of these

00:14:40.266 --> 00:14:41.646 A:middle
-- all of these colors have

00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:42.706 A:middle
unique names.

00:14:43.256 --> 00:14:45.166 A:middle
There's 1400 names in all.

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:46.876 A:middle
It's just like a real marker

set.

00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:50.166 A:middle
Now, I'm feeling inspired to

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:52.356 A:middle
actually draw something, so to

00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:54.236 A:middle
extend the canvas and stay in a

00:14:54.236 --> 00:14:56.276 A:middle

00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:56.946 A:middle
to the side.

00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:59.256 A:middle
I'll draw something in the theme

00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:01.236 A:middle

couple thousand people, so

00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:03.596 A:middle
hopefully I do this all right.

00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:05.596 A:middle
I'm going to draw a little

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:08.116 A:middle
So I'm just going to trace in

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.886 A:middle
the outline with a felt-tip

It's a little bit flat, so I

00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:20.886 A:middle
think I'm going to add in some

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:21.676 A:middle
shading.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:25.386 A:middle

realistic.

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:21.756 A:middle
in this whole island.

00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:25.886 A:middle
Now, beyond the stunning imagery

00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:28.256 A:middle
that you see, what really

00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:29.756 A:middle
impressed us about this game is

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.226 A:middle
that this kind of attention to

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:33.696 A:middle
detail actually extends to its

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.286 A:middle
bespoke soundtrack, its

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.236 A:middle

00:18:37.236 --> 00:18:38.746 A:middle
more than that, the

storytelling.

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.246 A:middle
Notice how Frendt is taken aback

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.716 A:middle
when Arina's able to walk over

00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:45.896 A:middle
the clouds, and then he catches

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.716 A:middle
up, still a little unsure.

00:18:47.716 --> 00:18:50.396 A:middle
And here, I just stopped time,

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.636 A:middle
and I do that by just not

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:54.456 A:middle
tapping anything.

00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:55.616 A:middle
This means that I'm never

00:18:55.616 --> 00:18:57.696 A:middle
feeling rushed or under any kind

00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:58.316 A:middle

We think this game play mechanic

00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:05.126 A:middle
is really simple, yet effective.

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:06.196 A:middle
Now, because you move both

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:07.936 A:middle
characters at once, and only

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:09.986 A:middle
control the flow of time, an

00:19:09.986 --> 00:19:11.426 A:middle
interesting interplay happens

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:13.876 A:middle
between the two characters.

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:16.396 A:middle
Here, you will notice that Arina

00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:18.056 A:middle
is no longer able to move any

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.126 A:middle
more forward in time, and that's

00:19:20.206 --> 00:19:21.506 A:middle
because Frendt has fallen

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:34.436 A:middle
through the plank.

00:19:34.436 --> 00:19:36.506 A:middle

Let's get started.

00:26:25.096 --> 00:26:26.956 A:middle
I've got this great image of

00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:28.546 A:middle
this boy playing soccer on a

00:26:28.596 --> 00:26:30.366 A:middle
beach in India, but I think with

00:26:30.366 --> 00:26:32.236 A:middle
a few simple adjustments, we can

00:26:32.236 --> 00:26:33.856 A:middle
really make this photo pop.

00:26:34.166 --> 00:26:35.096 A:middle
I'm first going to hit the

00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:36.856 A:middle
Auto-Enhance button, which is

00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:39.246 A:middle
already making this look quite a

00:26:39.246 --> 00:26:40.076 A:middle
bit better.

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.506 A:middle
But I want it to have a more

00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:43.626 A:middle
vintage look to it, and for

00:26:43.626 --> 00:26:44.816 A:middle
that, I'm going to have a look

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.906 A:middle
at some of the many built-in

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:47.856 A:middle

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:50.156 A:middle
I love all these different film

00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:53.656 A:middle
I specifically like these

00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:54.846 A:middle

00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:56.526 A:middle
So I'm going to choose number 2.

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.226 A:middle
I think that looks really good,

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.766 A:middle
and there's one more thing I

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.766 A:middle
and there's one more thing I

00:27:00.766 --> 00:27:02.666 A:middle
want to do to this image, which

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.666 A:middle
is to crop it before I share it

And what's really unique about

00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:10.796 A:middle
the cropping in Pixelmator Photo

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:13.596 A:middle
is, the team trained a custom

00:27:13.596 --> 00:27:15.436 A:middle
Core ML model on thousands and

00:27:15.436 --> 00:27:16.696 A:middle

enable this Smart Cropping

00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:14.046 A:middle
The Pixelmator team spent months

00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:16.866 A:middle
training a custom Core ML model

00:28:16.866 --> 00:28:19.656 A:middle
on over 20 million image pairs,

00:28:19.946 --> 00:28:21.906 A:middle
and from that, they learned how

00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:24.156 A:middle
to automatically control over 32

00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:25.876 A:middle
different adjustments, from

00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:27.136 A:middle

saturation, lightness, color

balance.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:31.996 A:middle
Understanding all these

00:28:31.996 --> 00:28:33.716 A:middle
individual adjustments on your

00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:36.346 A:middle
own can be very daunting, but

00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:37.816 A:middle
with the ML Enhance feature,

00:28:38.026 --> 00:28:39.496 A:middle
it's a perfect place to start.

00:28:39.626 --> 00:28:41.366 A:middle
I can do something like simply

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:43.006 A:middle
bump the black point just a

00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:45.186 A:middle
little bit more, and I think

00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:46.026 A:middle
that looks great.

00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:48.406 A:middle
I can deep-press on this photo

00:28:48.406 --> 00:28:50.136 A:middle
to compare it, and I think

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:51.486 A:middle
you'll agree that's a much

&gt;&gt; You know, we love how

00:30:36.596 --> 00:30:38.546 A:middle
Pixelmator Photo uses Apple

technologies to do new things,

00:30:40.946 --> 00:30:42.176 A:middle
and this isn't the first time

00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:43.056 A:middle
that this team has been on

And that's not without good

00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:46.636 A:middle

The Pixelmator Team is

00:30:48.706 --> 00:30:51.366 A:middle
consistently in lockstep with

[ Music ]

00:31:11.396 --> 00:31:13.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, we love the game ELOH

00:31:13.596 --> 00:31:15.476 A:middle
for its beautiful animation,

00:31:15.476 --> 00:31:16.946 A:middle

00:31:18.736 --> 00:31:19.386 A:middle
block.

00:31:19.896 --> 00:31:21.626 A:middle
While you play, you learn basic

00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:24.126 A:middle
physics and geometry with rhythm

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:24.636 A:middle
and music.

00:31:25.546 --> 00:31:27.216 A:middle
Now, music and sound effects are

00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:28.906 A:middle
key elements to helping you

00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:30.446 A:middle
solve this chilled-out puzzle

00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:30.696 A:middle

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:33.236 A:middle
You can play, relax, and

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:35.176 A:middle
decompress all while finding

your groove.

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:37.696 A:middle
Now, I absolutely love playing

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:39.026 A:middle
this game, and I know you do,

00:31:39.026 --> 00:31:39.706 A:middle
too, Paolo.

00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:40.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.

00:31:40.126 --> 00:31:42.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Will you help us take a look?

00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:43.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I do, actually, Lauren.

00:31:43.176 --> 00:31:45.056 A:middle
I actually love playing this

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:47.296 A:middle
game with my son, Luca.

00:31:47.296 --> 00:31:48.236 A:middle
It's his favorite game right

00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:50.226 A:middle
now, and the reason for that is

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:51.396 A:middle
that the first time you launch

00:31:51.396 --> 00:31:53.026 A:middle
ELOH, you realize that there is

00:31:53.026 --> 00:31:53.706 A:middle
no onboarding.

00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:55.266 A:middle
There are no instructions.

00:31:55.846 --> 00:31:58.026 A:middle
Just like many great iOS games,

00:31:58.026 --> 00:31:59.766 A:middle
you just learn by playing.

00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:01.766 A:middle
Now, the goal of the game is to

00:32:01.766 --> 00:32:03.656 A:middle
get the little ball that emits

00:32:03.656 --> 00:32:05.496 A:middle
from this speaker down to the

00:32:05.496 --> 00:32:07.686 A:middle
target, and you do that by --

00:32:07.686 --> 00:32:09.886 A:middle
you achieve that by tapping on

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:12.566 A:middle
these tribal masks, and moving

00:32:12.566 --> 00:32:14.436 A:middle
them around the screen.

00:32:14.536 --> 00:32:14.866 A:middle
Great.

00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:16.716 A:middle
I think my reputation is saved.

00:32:16.716 --> 00:32:18.496 A:middle
Level four is done.

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:20.746 A:middle
Now, the game has 99 levels, and

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:23.256 A:middle
as you would expect, things can

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:25.486 A:middle
get more complicated.

00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
Yet, the game still offers a

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.866 A:middle
very relaxing experience, and I

00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:32.956 A:middle
think the key component here is

00:32:32.956 --> 00:32:34.396 A:middle
the sound effects, and the

00:32:34.396 --> 00:32:36.646 A:middle
soundtrack, which complements

00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:39.916 A:middle
the beautiful graphics and

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:41.076 A:middle
delightful animations.

00:32:41.076 --> 00:32:43.006 A:middle
And the other fun aspect is

00:32:43.006 --> 00:32:44.446 A:middle
that, while you're playing,

00:32:44.636 --> 00:32:46.056 A:middle
you're actually composing your

00:32:46.056 --> 00:32:47.646 A:middle
very own soundtrack.

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:48.216 A:middle
Cool.

00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:52.736 A:middle
Let's get through level 12.

00:32:52.926 --> 00:32:53.306 A:middle
Great.

00:32:53.466 --> 00:32:54.906 A:middle
Now, level 12 is special,

00:32:55.046 --> 00:32:57.116 A:middle
because we get rewarded with a

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:58.616 A:middle
little totem animation.

What is also fun about this game

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.826 A:middle
What is also fun about this game

00:33:00.826 --> 00:33:02.346 A:middle
is that there is no score.

00:33:02.346 --> 00:33:04.576 A:middle
There is no -- there are no time

00:33:04.576 --> 00:33:05.196 A:middle
constraints.

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:08.436 A:middle
Therefore, a little six-year-old

00:33:08.436 --> 00:33:10.506 A:middle

00:33:10.506 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
pressure, or fear of making

00:33:12.896 --> 00:33:13.696 A:middle

And today, you see kids, and

00:45:45.356 --> 00:45:47.636 A:middle
even adults, using HomeCourt to

00:45:47.636 --> 00:45:48.456 A:middle
improve their skills.

00:45:49.136 --> 00:45:50.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So when you finish a drill,

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:51.476 A:middle
you can actually share your

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:52.846 A:middle
results with your friends, your

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.646 A:middle
teammates, your coaches, or with

00:45:54.646 --> 00:45:55.626 A:middle
people around the world.

00:45:56.476 --> 00:45:57.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But you know, Doug,

00:45:57.886 --> 00:46:00.246 A:middle
basketball is way more fun when

00:45:57.886 --> 00:46:00.246 A:middle
basketball is way more fun when

00:46:00.246 --> 00:46:01.326 A:middle
you play against someone else.

00:46:01.656 --> 00:46:03.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And HomeCourt has competitive

00:46:03.396 --> 00:46:04.256 A:middle
drills, too.

00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:05.306 A:middle
Do you want to show them?

00:46:05.306 --> 00:46:06.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, totally.

00:46:06.446 --> 00:46:06.976 A:middle

00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:19.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So the objective in this

00:46:19.456 --> 00:46:21.586 A:middle
drill is to not hit the red

00:46:21.756 --> 00:46:21.976 A:middle

HomeCourt's use of amazing Core

ML technology really makes it so

00:47:08.186 --> 00:47:09.946 A:middle
that everyone can become a
