[ Applause ]

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:14.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.306 A:middle
I'm so excited that you're able

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:19.136 A:middle
to join us today.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.226 A:middle
I'm Kayur and I'm here with some

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.756 A:middle
amazing designers, Rubii and

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.166 A:middle
Cas.

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:25.996 A:middle
And we're so excited to talk to

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:27.716 A:middle
you today about design and

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:28.366 A:middle
machine learning.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.686 A:middle
You see, at Apple, we've been

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.326 A:middle
thinking about design and

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.826 A:middle
machine learning for some time

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:35.036 A:middle
now.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.886 A:middle
And when we think about and we

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.896 A:middle
talk about machine learning, we

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.226 A:middle
talk about all the amazing

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.056 A:middle
technological advances in speech

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:43.756 A:middle
recognition and computer vision.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.896 A:middle
We talk about deep neural nets.

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.306 A:middle
We talk about custom processing

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.016 A:middle
for on-device machine learning.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.386 A:middle
We talk about all these things

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:54.566 A:middle
because we care about products

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.566 A:middle
and we know that many of the

00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:00.066 A:middle
products that we build today and

00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:00.066 A:middle
products that we build today and

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.946 A:middle
many of the products and

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.306 A:middle
experiences that we want to

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
build in the future would not be

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.076 A:middle
possible without machine

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:07.386 A:middle
learning.

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.816 A:middle
Let's take a look at some of the

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:11.366 A:middle
products.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.226 A:middle
AirPods.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.946 A:middle
AirPods allow you to summon Siri

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.736 A:middle
to control your device with your

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:17.056 A:middle
voice.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.256 A:middle
You can easily change your music

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.106 A:middle
or answer a call all when your

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.796 A:middle
hands are busy and when you

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.206 A:middle
can't really look at the screen.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.466 A:middle
This AirPods experience would

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.986 A:middle
not be possible without machine

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:29.466 A:middle
learning and it would not be

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.396 A:middle
possible without Siri.

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:33.106 A:middle
Machine learning allows us to

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.096 A:middle
create Face ID which provides

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:36.966 A:middle
fast secure authentication for

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.026 A:middle
your iOS devices.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.256 A:middle
And we use machine learning in

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.226 A:middle
ways that you may not expect,

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.376 A:middle
subtle ways that improve your

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
experience with your devices.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:50.946 A:middle
We use machine learning to

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.836 A:middle
invisibly improve your typing

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:53.386 A:middle
experience.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.056 A:middle
We increase or decrease the

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.626 A:middle
target tap area for keyboard

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.256 A:middle
buttons based on the word you're

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
most likely to type.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
most likely to type.

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:02.586 A:middle
Machine learning applications

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:03.376 A:middle
are diverse.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.576 A:middle
They're not just about voice

00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:07.416 A:middle
assistance or recommending

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
content or self-driving cars,

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:11.626 A:middle
machine learning applications

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.536 A:middle
are as diverse as any

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:14.576 A:middle
application of software

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:15.206 A:middle
engineering.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.016 A:middle
They can make existing products

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.316 A:middle
better or enable new products

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:21.046 A:middle
that enrich the human

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:21.596 A:middle
experience.

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.786 A:middle
And inside Apple, we've been

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.566 A:middle
talking about and thinking about

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.776 A:middle
what makes a great machine

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.026 A:middle
learning product for some time

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:30.226 A:middle
now.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.176 A:middle
And to go into this in more

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:34.376 A:middle
detail, let's dive into a single

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.626 A:middle
experience, Photos.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
Photos uses machine learning in

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.026 A:middle
a variety of ways.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
Machine learning helps people

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.086 A:middle
create albums, edit photos and

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.396 A:middle
search for specific memories.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.796 A:middle
Speaking of memories, recently I

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:49.796 A:middle
was looking for this memory.

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:51.256 A:middle
This is Angie.

00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:53.216 A:middle
She's a friend of the family and

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:54.226 A:middle
this picture was taken from a

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.316 A:middle
hike a few years ago.

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.116 A:middle
I felt nostalgic and wanted to

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.126 A:middle
share the picture with some

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:00.386 A:middle
friends who were already there.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:00.386 A:middle
friends who were already there.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.136 A:middle
Until very recently, finding a

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:04.566 A:middle
specific picture was painful.

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:06.526 A:middle
I'd have to sift through

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:08.506 A:middle
thousands of pictures, try and

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:10.056 A:middle
remember where I was or when I

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:10.706 A:middle
took the picture.

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:12.036 A:middle
I would've given up.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.036 A:middle
Finding a picture used to be a

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:16.336 A:middle
barrier to me engaging with my

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:17.696 A:middle
memories and sharing them with

00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:18.326 A:middle
my family.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.046 A:middle
In iOS X, Apple introduced a new

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.186 A:middle
search experience that could

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:25.006 A:middle
like inside a picture and

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.356 A:middle
detect, among other things,

00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:26.706 A:middle
dogs.

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:28.686 A:middle
And over the years, we've been

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:29.946 A:middle
making this experience better.

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.456 A:middle
Here's what the experience looks

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:32.766 A:middle
like now.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:35.776 A:middle
I tap on the Search box.

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.366 A:middle
I type in dog.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.086 A:middle
And I get a list of pictures

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:39.496 A:middle
with dogs.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:41.006 A:middle
I can then select the picture I

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:42.296 A:middle
was looking for and share it.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.236 A:middle
Easy peasy.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.976 A:middle
Searching for pictures based on

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.016 A:middle
what's in a picture changes how

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:49.176 A:middle
we engage with our memories.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:50.746 A:middle
It's something we take for

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:51.166 A:middle
granted.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:52.966 A:middle
In fact, it's such a great

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.556 A:middle
experience it's hard to remember

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.976 A:middle
a time before we had this

00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:56.606 A:middle
capability.

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
It's well designed.

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
And there's a lot of interface

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
And there's a lot of interface

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.656 A:middle
work that goes into making this

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:03.236 A:middle
experience.

00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:05.446 A:middle
Photos suggest categories you

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:06.776 A:middle
can search for, it

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.546 A:middle
auto-completes searches and it

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:09.706 A:middle
connects search results to

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:12.276 A:middle
Moments but designing this

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:13.916 A:middle
experience is more than just

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.836 A:middle
designing a grid view in the

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:16.456 A:middle
Search field.

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:18.106 A:middle
If we just looked at the

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.916 A:middle
interface, we'd miss the most

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:21.016 A:middle
important parts of the search

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.166 A:middle
experience, the results being

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.146 A:middle
outputted into categories that

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:26.006 A:middle
people can search for.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.316 A:middle
These aspects of the experience

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:30.276 A:middle
should be designed.

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:32.216 A:middle
We get to decide which

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.076 A:middle
categories are included and we

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.756 A:middle
decide the level of quality we

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:38.576 A:middle
want for each category.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.256 A:middle
We've realized that to build a

00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:41.116 A:middle
good machine learning

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.886 A:middle
experience, we have to design

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.176 A:middle
more than just the interface.

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:45.276 A:middle
What do we mean?

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:47.996 A:middle
Well, when most people think

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.576 A:middle
about design, they think about

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
the interface, how the product

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:53.236 A:middle
looks and feels, the flow of the

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:53.846 A:middle
experience.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
With machine learning, we have

00:04:57.516 --> 00:04:59.576 A:middle
to design how the product works.

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:01.796 A:middle
Now we know that many of you in

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:02.916 A:middle
the design and developer

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.626 A:middle
community have some machine

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:05.456 A:middle
learning experience.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:06.826 A:middle
You could create a search

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.696 A:middle
experience from scratch but to

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:10.066 A:middle
get everyone on the same page,

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:11.646 A:middle
let's look at how machine

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:12.946 A:middle
learning for photo search works.

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.536 A:middle
Deep within the logic of Photos

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.436 A:middle
is a function that takes a

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.346 A:middle
picture and detects if that

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
picture contains any of the

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:22.976 A:middle
categories it can recognize.

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:25.206 A:middle
In our case, it recognizes that

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.626 A:middle
this picture of Angie has a dog

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:27.506 A:middle
in it.

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:30.006 A:middle
In traditional programming, we

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:30.986 A:middle
would have to create the

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.596 A:middle
function by writing code to tell

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:34.906 A:middle
the computer what to do.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
Our code would have to work for

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:39.286 A:middle
a variety of different breeds,

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.566 A:middle
different scenarios, different

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
photo resolutions because their

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:46.256 A:middle
customers are diverse and so are

00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:46.836 A:middle
their dogs.

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:48.956 A:middle
And we wouldn't want a search

00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:50.196 A:middle
for dogs to be littered with

00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:51.336 A:middle
pictures of other animals.

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:52.796 A:middle
Our code would have to

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:54.696 A:middle
differentiate between dogs and

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.576 A:middle
similar animals, like this hyena

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:58.416 A:middle
which looks like a dog but you

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
should not have as a pet.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
should not have as a pet.

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:03.656 A:middle
Writing code that generalizes

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:05.196 A:middle
the countless variations of dogs

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:06.776 A:middle
in photos would be impossible.

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:08.516 A:middle
And dogs are just one of

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:09.776 A:middle
thousands of categories that

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:10.766 A:middle
Photos can recognize.

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:13.476 A:middle
There're experiences we want to

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:15.096 A:middle
create where we can't just tell

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:16.076 A:middle
the computer what to do.

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:18.306 A:middle
And for many of these

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:20.256 A:middle
experiences, we can use machine

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:22.076 A:middle
learning to teach a computer

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:22.606 A:middle
what to do.

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:25.416 A:middle
We teach by providing examples.

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.526 A:middle
If we wanted to distinguish

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:28.086 A:middle
pictures of dogs from pictures

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.936 A:middle
that do not contain dogs, we

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.296 A:middle
have to provide pictures with

00:06:31.296 --> 00:06:32.706 A:middle
dogs and pictures without dogs.

00:06:33.566 --> 00:06:35.786 A:middle
Machine learning learns a

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.856 A:middle
function that we can later use

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.186 A:middle
in our app.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.366 A:middle
This function can take this

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.966 A:middle
picture of Angie and understand

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:43.916 A:middle
that it's a picture of a dog.

00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:46.776 A:middle
We call this function a model

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.296 A:middle
and a model is what makes the

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:53.026 A:middle
Photos Search experience work.

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:56.436 A:middle
This model can generalize two

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:57.576 A:middle
pictures that it's never seen

00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:57.886 A:middle
before.

00:06:58.326 --> 00:06:59.686 A:middle
It can recognize different dog

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.766 A:middle
species and differentiate dogs

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.766 A:middle
species and differentiate dogs

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.406 A:middle
from other animals and objects.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.226 A:middle
Models are central to the

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.246 A:middle
machine learning experience.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
Every product or experience that

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.026 A:middle
depends on machine learning

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:11.896 A:middle
depends on a model.

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.736 A:middle
Siri has a model that converts

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.436 A:middle
your voice to text.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.986 A:middle
And the keyboard has a model

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:19.686 A:middle
that infers the key you meant to

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:20.726 A:middle
type based on the letters you've

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:21.776 A:middle
already typed and your typing

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:21.976 A:middle
history.

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:29.506 A:middle
To design a great machine

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:31.776 A:middle
learning experience, we have to

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:35.226 A:middle
design both how it works and how

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:35.966 A:middle
it looks and feels.

00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.606 A:middle
We have to design both the model

00:07:38.606 --> 00:07:39.486 A:middle
and the interface.

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:41.696 A:middle
In this talk, we'll cover both.

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:44.006 A:middle
Creating a model can be

00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:44.746 A:middle
complicated.

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:46.456 A:middle
You have to make a lot of

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:48.256 A:middle
decisions about algorithms and

00:07:48.256 --> 00:07:49.406 A:middle
parameters and frameworks.

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:51.536 A:middle
And all of these decisions

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.736 A:middle
affect what the model does and,

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:54.696 A:middle
therefore, the experience.

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:57.506 A:middle
Machine learning decisions are

00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.646 A:middle
all design decisions but not all

00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.646 A:middle
all design decisions but not all

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.336 A:middle
of them are effective places for

00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:03.026 A:middle
design input.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.836 A:middle
We choose a few places where we

00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:07.236 A:middle
think design can have the most

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:08.046 A:middle
impact.

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:11.236 A:middle
We talk about the need to design

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:12.616 A:middle
what we use to teach the

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:13.076 A:middle
computer.

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.056 A:middle
This is the data.

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:17.176 A:middle
And we also talk about how we

00:08:17.176 --> 00:08:18.936 A:middle
design what we evaluate and

00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:22.736 A:middle
these are the metrics.

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:24.756 A:middle
Along with the model, we do need

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:25.776 A:middle
to design the interface.

00:08:26.726 --> 00:08:27.886 A:middle
We have to design what the model

00:08:27.886 --> 00:08:29.566 A:middle
outputs and how those model's

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.066 A:middle
outputs are presented to people.

00:08:31.916 --> 00:08:33.336 A:middle
We also have to design how

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.616 A:middle
people interact with the model

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:36.905 A:middle
and, if appropriate, provide

00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.385 A:middle
input to improve the model.

00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:40.466 A:middle
Rubii and Cas will talk about

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:41.000 A:middle
that later.

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:44.476 A:middle
So let's start.

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:47.926 A:middle
Let's talk about the data.

00:08:50.476 --> 00:08:52.366 A:middle
To recognize dogs in pictures,

00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:54.896 A:middle
we used machine learning to

00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:56.606 A:middle
create a model using examples.

00:08:57.926 --> 00:08:59.576 A:middle
Those examples are called data.

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:02.596 A:middle
And to build a good search

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:04.146 A:middle
experience, you need a lot of

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:04.686 A:middle
diverse data.

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.886 A:middle
You need photos of the

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:08.386 A:middle
categories that you want people

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:09.436 A:middle
to be able to search for.

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
You need to provide plenty of

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:13.736 A:middle
pictures of dogs and of other

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:15.636 A:middle
animals to ensure the search

00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:17.676 A:middle
experience doesn't show random

00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:18.626 A:middle
animals when you're searching

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.086 A:middle
for dogs.

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:21.396 A:middle
And a good search experience

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.036 A:middle
needs to support thousands of

00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:24.556 A:middle
categories that cover the

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.976 A:middle
objects and events people want

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:26.486 A:middle
to search for.

00:09:27.246 --> 00:09:28.186 A:middle
And for each of those

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:29.526 A:middle
categories, you'll need data.

00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:31.226 A:middle
If you want to support a new

00:09:31.226 --> 00:09:32.566 A:middle
category, you'll need data.

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.166 A:middle
If you want to improve an

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:35.916 A:middle
existing category, you will need

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:36.336 A:middle
data.

00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:39.036 A:middle
Choosing data is key to

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.186 A:middle
designing the experience.

00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:43.696 A:middle
Data determines the behavior of

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:44.286 A:middle
a model.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:46.246 A:middle
It's easily the most important

00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:47.246 A:middle
decision you'll make when

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:48.056 A:middle
creating your model.

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:50.086 A:middle
And if you don't have data that

00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:52.206 A:middle
captures an important scenario,

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.546 A:middle
it's unlikely that your model's

00:09:54.546 --> 00:09:55.386 A:middle
going to work well in that

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:55.956 A:middle
scenario.

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:59.336 A:middle
And since data determines the

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:01.396 A:middle
behavior of the model, and since

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:01.396 A:middle
behavior of the model, and since

00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:02.716 A:middle
the behavior of the model

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.066 A:middle
determines the experience, data

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:07.546 A:middle
needs to be designed to reflect

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:09.276 A:middle
good values in the best interest

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.106 A:middle
of your customers.

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:12.846 A:middle
To understand this better, let's

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:13.656 A:middle
look at an example.

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:15.786 A:middle
Let's look at Portrait mode.

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.276 A:middle
Portrait mode uses machine

00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:21.636 A:middle
learning to detect faces and

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:22.896 A:middle
segment your body from the

00:10:22.896 --> 00:10:23.406 A:middle
background.

00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:26.846 A:middle
Historically, face recognition

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:28.516 A:middle
hasn't worked well for people of

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:28.886 A:middle
color.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.486 A:middle
At Apple, we want to make sure

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.406 A:middle
our experiences are inclusive.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.556 A:middle
So our design and engineering

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:37.666 A:middle
teams gather data from across

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:39.406 A:middle
different races, different

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.656 A:middle
cultures, and different

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:41.196 A:middle
scenarios.

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:43.666 A:middle
We built a dataset that matched

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:45.776 A:middle
the experience we wanted to

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:46.646 A:middle
create.

00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:49.366 A:middle
We collected data intentionally.

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.106 A:middle
When collecting data, it's

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.266 A:middle
important to ask questions.

00:10:52.836 --> 00:10:54.306 A:middle
Who is collecting the data?

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:56.056 A:middle
What data are they collecting?

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:57.336 A:middle
And how are they doing it?

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.886 A:middle
Data bias can seep into your

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
dataset in a variety of ways.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
dataset in a variety of ways.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.976 A:middle
And data bias extends beyond

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:04.336 A:middle
fairness.

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.056 A:middle
You should strive to be fair and

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:07.516 A:middle
inclusive.

00:11:07.836 --> 00:11:08.966 A:middle
Those are good values.

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:11.576 A:middle
But you should also see how data

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:13.276 A:middle
collection might skew away from

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:14.266 A:middle
other design intents.

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.596 A:middle
If you're creating a fun or

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:18.396 A:middle
enriching experience, you should

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:20.406 A:middle
sample data for fun, enriching

00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:21.076 A:middle
experiences.

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:23.036 A:middle
If your product is going to be

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:25.166 A:middle
used outdoors, you should sample

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.006 A:middle
from scenarios that are

00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:26.656 A:middle
outdoors.

00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:29.446 A:middle
It's tempting to disconnect from

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:31.146 A:middle
this decision and make decisions

00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.566 A:middle
about data collection that just

00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
sample the data from your

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:37.126 A:middle
existing customers and get a

00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:38.816 A:middle
uniform sample of the world from

00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:41.776 A:middle
other mechanisms but you can't

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:43.256 A:middle
just reflect the world.

00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:45.116 A:middle
Reflecting the world can

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:46.456 A:middle
reinforce systemic biases.

00:11:47.336 --> 00:11:48.506 A:middle
You shouldn't optimize for the

00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:50.076 A:middle
customers you have.

00:11:50.526 --> 00:11:51.526 A:middle
You should optimize for the

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:52.736 A:middle
customers you want.

00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:55.176 A:middle
You shouldn't reflect the world

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:55.646 A:middle
as it is.

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:57.756 A:middle
You should reflect a better

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.336 A:middle
world, that world that you want

00:11:59.336 --> 00:11:59.636 A:middle
it to be.

00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:02.806 A:middle
Collecting data is a way to

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.526 A:middle
design experiences and great

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:07.306 A:middle
experiences often change the

00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:07.706 A:middle
world.

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:09.536 A:middle
They don't just reflect what

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:10.426 A:middle
already exists.

00:12:11.886 --> 00:12:13.166 A:middle
So how do we put this into

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.000 A:middle
practice?

00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:17.796 A:middle
We'll start by collecting data

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:18.506 A:middle
intentionally.

00:12:19.226 --> 00:12:20.876 A:middle
Understand the experience you're

00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:22.526 A:middle
trying to create and think about

00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:23.646 A:middle
what you'll need to make that

00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:24.496 A:middle
experience work.

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:26.426 A:middle
If specific scenarios are

00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:28.096 A:middle
important, spend more time and

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:29.296 A:middle
ensure you collect data for

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.046 A:middle
those scenarios.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.896 A:middle
Spending time up front

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:35.976 A:middle
collecting the right data can

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:37.836 A:middle
save time and effort and money

00:12:37.836 --> 00:12:38.166 A:middle
later.

00:12:38.726 --> 00:12:41.566 A:middle
Make sure you test for biases.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:43.516 A:middle
Analyze your dataset.

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:45.656 A:middle
Catalogue your assumptions about

00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:47.106 A:middle
who will use your product and

00:12:47.106 --> 00:12:48.086 A:middle
how it will be used.

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:50.126 A:middle
Think of ways your data might be

00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:51.806 A:middle
biased towards or against

00:12:51.806 --> 00:12:53.266 A:middle
certain populations or certain

00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:54.016 A:middle
experiences.

00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:58.446 A:middle
Update data as products change.

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:01.476 A:middle
Product specifications change

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:01.476 A:middle
Product specifications change

00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:02.446 A:middle
the more you learn about your

00:13:02.446 --> 00:13:04.566 A:middle
customers or the market or what

00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:05.896 A:middle
you want to actually create.

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:08.106 A:middle
You need to change your data to

00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:08.616 A:middle
match.

00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:10.326 A:middle
You may not need to collect more

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:10.596 A:middle
data.

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:12.926 A:middle
You may get rid of concepts that

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.066 A:middle
are not important but you must

00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:17.476 A:middle
routinely align your data with

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.506 A:middle
your product goals.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:22.926 A:middle
And beware of standard datasets.

00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:25.006 A:middle
Academic or industry benchmark

00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:27.386 A:middle
datasets might be a great way to

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.266 A:middle
start to get some knowledge

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:30.266 A:middle
about how machine learning

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:30.596 A:middle
works.

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:32.196 A:middle
It might be a great way to ramp

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:33.516 A:middle
up your product development

00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:34.066 A:middle
process.

00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:35.986 A:middle
But they're not designed to

00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:37.736 A:middle
represent real experiences,

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.666 A:middle
especially your experience.

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:41.596 A:middle
Before you start using an

00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:43.326 A:middle
off-the-shelf dataset, think

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:44.506 A:middle
about what the data covers and

00:13:44.506 --> 00:13:45.116 A:middle
doesn't cover.

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:47.276 A:middle
Spend time augmenting the data

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:48.666 A:middle
to match your needs.

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:52.926 A:middle
Spending time thinking about

00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.916 A:middle
cataloguing and critically

00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:58.376 A:middle
collecting data can help you

00:13:58.376 --> 00:13:59.976 A:middle
align what you want your product

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:02.156 A:middle
to be and what machine learning

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:02.156 A:middle
to be and what machine learning

00:14:02.156 --> 00:14:02.726 A:middle
can provide.

00:14:03.226 --> 00:14:06.906 A:middle
So, we just talked about data,

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:08.376 A:middle
which is what you use to teach a

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:08.756 A:middle
model.

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.576 A:middle
Next, let's talk about how you

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:12.396 A:middle
evaluate your model.

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:14.906 A:middle
This is done through metrics.

00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:18.376 A:middle
You evaluate your model by

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:18.946 A:middle
testing it.

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.566 A:middle
In the Photo Search example,

00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:22.226 A:middle
you'd give it pictures of

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:24.206 A:middle
animals and your model would

00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:25.476 A:middle
predict what's in the pictures.

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:27.076 A:middle
And once it's done, you can

00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:28.536 A:middle
compare how many times it was

00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:31.006 A:middle
correct and how many times it

00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:31.786 A:middle
was incorrect.

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:34.676 A:middle
Here, we see that the model gave

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:36.656 A:middle
the correct prediction 75% of

00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:37.016 A:middle
the time.

00:14:37.686 --> 00:14:39.526 A:middle
This is a metric and a metric

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:41.846 A:middle
like this will define how

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.686 A:middle
successful your model is and,

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:45.216 A:middle
therefore, whether it's ready to

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:46.706 A:middle
use or whether you have to go

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:47.786 A:middle
back to the drawing board and

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:48.676 A:middle
improve it.

00:14:49.146 --> 00:14:51.366 A:middle
Models can be evaluated in many

00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:51.776 A:middle
ways.

00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.346 A:middle
You could look at how fast the

00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:54.846 A:middle
model works or how many

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:55.936 A:middle
categories it can support.

00:14:56.316 --> 00:14:57.576 A:middle
You can balance all of these

00:14:57.576 --> 00:14:59.286 A:middle
together and find the right set

00:14:59.286 --> 00:15:00.846 A:middle
of metrics for your problem.

00:14:59.286 --> 00:15:00.846 A:middle
of metrics for your problem.

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:04.096 A:middle
Designing metrics define how the

00:15:04.096 --> 00:15:05.526 A:middle
model will work and, therefore,

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:06.956 A:middle
how the experience will work but

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:10.966 A:middle
ultimately you get to decide.

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.886 A:middle
Metrics encode what you think a

00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:13.836 A:middle
good experience is.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:15.776 A:middle
They define what you care about

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:16.816 A:middle
and what you can ignore.

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:19.476 A:middle
If part of the experience is not

00:15:19.476 --> 00:15:21.246 A:middle
measured, it may be sacrificed

00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:22.436 A:middle
for something that is.

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.326 A:middle
And as a consequence, your

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:28.416 A:middle
metrics reflect your values.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.436 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:32.826 A:middle
Let's look at Face ID.

00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:36.296 A:middle
Face ID uses machine learning to

00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:38.376 A:middle
detect your face to unlock your

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:38.726 A:middle
device.

00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:42.136 A:middle
And behind Face ID are a number

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:43.126 A:middle
of design intents.

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.026 A:middle
The most important is Face ID

00:15:45.026 --> 00:15:46.426 A:middle
needs to be secure.

00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:48.546 A:middle
Our customers trust us with some

00:15:48.546 --> 00:15:49.676 A:middle
of their most private data.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.856 A:middle
There are many metrics that we

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:53.946 A:middle
use to track different aspects

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:54.576 A:middle
of security.

00:15:55.256 --> 00:15:56.776 A:middle
One key metric was the chance

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:58.666 A:middle
that a random person could find

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.206 A:middle
your phone, pick it up and

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.206 A:middle
your phone, pick it up and

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:00.746 A:middle
unlock it.

00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:02.816 A:middle
We tracked this metric and

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:05.146 A:middle
worked hard to reduce this

00:16:05.826 --> 00:16:05.976 A:middle
chance.

00:16:06.136 --> 00:16:07.856 A:middle
At launch, we knew that there

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:09.316 A:middle
was a one-in-a-million chance

00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:10.916 A:middle
that a random person could

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.526 A:middle
unlock your phone using Face ID.

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.976 A:middle
And since Face ID was a new

00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:16.526 A:middle
experience, we needed to

00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:17.886 A:middle
communicate this to our

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:18.356 A:middle
customers.

00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:20.586 A:middle
That way they understood that we

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:21.646 A:middle
cared about their data and they

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:23.106 A:middle
could actually trust Face ID.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.786 A:middle
But one in a million doesn't

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:26.746 A:middle
tell the whole story.

00:16:27.766 --> 00:16:30.066 A:middle
Each failure is a person, a

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:32.106 A:middle
scenario, an experience that we

00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:35.286 A:middle
have to think about and address.

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.256 A:middle
Say you're me.

00:16:36.606 --> 00:16:38.786 A:middle
I'm your average run-of-the-mill

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:43.296 A:middle
Apple employee and recently I

00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:46.216 A:middle
had a run-in with the new

00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:47.056 A:middle
MacBook Pro.

00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:48.916 A:middle
Due to a small mishap, I

00:16:49.066 --> 00:16:50.746 A:middle
accidentally opened up a portal

00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:51.736 A:middle
to another timeline.

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:55.776 A:middle
Now I have to routinely fight

00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:57.276 A:middle
off my mirror universe nemesis.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.566 A:middle
I obviously don't want him

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.716 A:middle
accessing secret Apple data, so

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.716 A:middle
accessing secret Apple data, so

00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:03.766 A:middle
I have to rely on a pass code.

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:06.955 A:middle
And people like me with similar

00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:08.546 A:middle
looking family members or evil

00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:10.306 A:middle
twins need to take the same

00:17:10.306 --> 00:17:10.846 A:middle
precautions.

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:14.646 A:middle
As Apple, we also talked about

00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:15.675 A:middle
this limitation.

00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:18.596 A:middle
We dedicated time in a keynote

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.026 A:middle
because it's important that our

00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:23.046 A:middle
customers understand and take

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:24.556 A:middle
steps to secure their data.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.656 A:middle
It's important for you to

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:27.886 A:middle
understand and communicate

00:17:27.886 --> 00:17:30.386 A:middle
limitations to unpack aggregate

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:31.076 A:middle
statistics.

00:17:31.566 --> 00:17:34.256 A:middle
Not all mistakes are equal.

00:17:35.126 --> 00:17:37.266 A:middle
Mistakes in machine learning are

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:37.866 A:middle
inevitable.

00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:40.126 A:middle
Few models work 100% of the

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:40.536 A:middle
time.

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.396 A:middle
When you start, you may not

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
understand all the limitations.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.756 A:middle
That's OK.

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.286 A:middle
It's an iterative process.

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:50.136 A:middle
But over time, you need to build

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:51.876 A:middle
a better understanding of what

00:17:51.926 --> 00:17:53.426 A:middle
is and is not possible.

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:56.306 A:middle
Mistakes don't mean you can't

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
create an experience that people

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:57.966 A:middle
love.

00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.066 A:middle
If you understand mistakes, you

00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.066 A:middle
If you understand mistakes, you

00:18:00.066 --> 00:18:02.406 A:middle
can account for them either by

00:18:02.526 --> 00:18:04.436 A:middle
creating new models, improving

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:06.286 A:middle
the product or clearly

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.386 A:middle
communicating technical

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:07.976 A:middle
limitations.

00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:12.196 A:middle
And remember that metrics are

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.696 A:middle
proxies for what we actually

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:15.196 A:middle
care about.

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:17.656 A:middle
Metrics provide numbers, a sense

00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:20.156 A:middle
of scientific accuracy, and it's

00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:22.386 A:middle
easy to get caught up in numbers

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:24.326 A:middle
and improving them but we

00:18:24.326 --> 00:18:26.096 A:middle
ultimately care about abstract

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:26.606 A:middle
concepts.

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:28.646 A:middle
These things are hard to measure

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:30.926 A:middle
like good experiences, happy

00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:32.396 A:middle
customers and strong brands.

00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:34.836 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:37.386 A:middle
To understand metrics as

00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:39.486 A:middle
proxies, let's talk about the

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.876 A:middle
App Store.

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:42.556 A:middle
The App Store uses machine

00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.346 A:middle
learning to recommend new apps

00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:46.176 A:middle
based on what you've downloaded.

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.476 A:middle
And at first approximation, the

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:50.186 A:middle
amount of time a person spends

00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:51.526 A:middle
in the app might be a good

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:51.896 A:middle
measure.

00:18:52.226 --> 00:18:52.426 A:middle
Right?

00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:54.426 A:middle
Afterall, the more time you

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.526 A:middle
spend doing something, the more

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:56.036 A:middle
you like it.

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:59.246 A:middle
And if the App Store is purely

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.756 A:middle
driven by metrics and models,

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.756 A:middle
driven by metrics and models,

00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:02.566 A:middle
people would see apps that are

00:19:02.566 --> 00:19:04.016 A:middle
very similar to the apps they

00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:04.686 A:middle
currently use.

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.426 A:middle
I like playing games.

00:19:06.886 --> 00:19:08.786 A:middle
So my top recommended apps are

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:09.386 A:middle
all games.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.176 A:middle
And for a while, I might like

00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:14.006 A:middle
those recommendations but over

00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:15.686 A:middle
time, I'd feel boxed in because

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:16.946 A:middle
I care about more than just

00:19:16.946 --> 00:19:17.306 A:middle
games.

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:20.886 A:middle
People have diverse interests

00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:21.406 A:middle
and tastes.

00:19:22.146 --> 00:19:23.576 A:middle
The amount of time I spend in an

00:19:23.576 --> 00:19:25.236 A:middle
app may not indicate how much I

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:26.366 A:middle
value it.

00:19:27.076 --> 00:19:29.156 A:middle
The App Store makes an editorial

00:19:29.156 --> 00:19:30.516 A:middle
content with recommendations.

00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:32.416 A:middle
This allows people to explore a

00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:34.016 A:middle
diverse set of applications and

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:35.836 A:middle
experiences that they may not

00:19:35.836 --> 00:19:37.886 A:middle
normally see if they just got

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.116 A:middle
their top recommendations.

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:42.346 A:middle
Editorial content is a way to

00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:43.866 A:middle
address limitations of metrics

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:44.916 A:middle
and recommendations.

00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:47.386 A:middle
But as you deploy your products

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.696 A:middle
and learn more about customer

00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:50.626 A:middle
needs, what you care about

00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:51.246 A:middle
evolves.

00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:54.666 A:middle
You can evolve your metrics to

00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:55.156 A:middle
match.

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:57.376 A:middle
For example, you can bake

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.186 A:middle
diversity into your metrics.

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:01.246 A:middle
You can measure when people

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:03.406 A:middle
engage with diverse content and

00:20:03.406 --> 00:20:05.286 A:middle
actively create models that

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:06.886 A:middle
balance the quality and

00:20:06.886 --> 00:20:08.336 A:middle
diversity of apps that people

00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:08.866 A:middle
engage in.

00:20:10.056 --> 00:20:11.156 A:middle
You should ensure that your

00:20:11.156 --> 00:20:12.506 A:middle
metrics still track what you

00:20:12.506 --> 00:20:15.106 A:middle
care about: a good experience,

00:20:15.636 --> 00:20:16.896 A:middle
happy and fulfilled customers

00:20:16.896 --> 00:20:17.736 A:middle
and strong brands.

00:20:18.606 --> 00:20:19.906 A:middle
But to do that, you need to

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.346 A:middle
question metrics to ensure

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:21.856 A:middle
they're relevant.

00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:25.836 A:middle
In your day to day, you can put

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:26.546 A:middle
this into practice.

00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:29.756 A:middle
You can try to understand

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:31.716 A:middle
mistakes because not all

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:32.616 A:middle
mistakes are equal.

00:20:33.256 --> 00:20:34.436 A:middle
Group failure cases into

00:20:34.436 --> 00:20:35.746 A:middle
categories and scenarios.

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:37.566 A:middle
This will help you understand

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:39.116 A:middle
how important each scenario is.

00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:41.586 A:middle
Decide if it's best handled by a

00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:43.636 A:middle
non-ML approach like improving

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.866 A:middle
the design or if you actually

00:20:45.866 --> 00:20:46.796 A:middle
need to build a better model.

00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:49.826 A:middle
And design for failure

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:50.396 A:middle
scenarios.

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:52.706 A:middle
When storyboarding or sketching

00:20:52.706 --> 00:20:54.416 A:middle
out an experience, don't just

00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:55.656 A:middle
sketch out what happens if

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:56.446 A:middle
things go well.

00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:58.356 A:middle
Sketch out what happens if

00:20:58.356 --> 00:20:59.286 A:middle
something goes wrong.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.396 A:middle
This will help you emphasize

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.396 A:middle
This will help you emphasize

00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:02.306 A:middle
what your customers might

00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:02.886 A:middle
experience.

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
Spend time evaluating the

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:07.556 A:middle
experience.

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.466 A:middle
The metric will give you an

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:11.056 A:middle
objective value for how well

00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:11.926 A:middle
your model is working.

00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:14.166 A:middle
Remember, the model is not the

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:14.816 A:middle
experience.

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:17.206 A:middle
The actual experience is the

00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:18.236 A:middle
experience.

00:21:18.596 --> 00:21:19.946 A:middle
So try to measure that

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:20.556 A:middle
experience.

00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:22.096 A:middle
Run user studies.

00:21:22.436 --> 00:21:23.256 A:middle
Build demos.

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:25.096 A:middle
Talk to your customers.

00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:26.096 A:middle
Read forums.

00:21:27.026 --> 00:21:28.796 A:middle
If the experience is bad and the

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:29.906 A:middle
metric says it's good, your

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.046 A:middle
metric is probably wrong.

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:34.526 A:middle
If the experience seems the same

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:35.546 A:middle
the metric says it's getting

00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:37.726 A:middle
better, your metric is likely

00:21:37.726 --> 00:21:38.216 A:middle
wrong.

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:42.336 A:middle
And over time, evolve your

00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:42.806 A:middle
metrics.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:44.636 A:middle
Question and assess the

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.786 A:middle
effectiveness of your metrics

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:46.606 A:middle
constantly.

00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:48.546 A:middle
The more you rely on something,

00:21:48.606 --> 00:21:51.946 A:middle
the more you should question it.

00:21:53.456 --> 00:21:55.836 A:middle
Ultimately, your metrics reflect

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:56.496 A:middle
your values.

00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:59.716 A:middle
And if you want to align your

00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:00.656 A:middle
metrics with your values, you

00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:00.656 A:middle
metrics with your values, you

00:22:00.656 --> 00:22:01.516 A:middle
have to think carefully,

00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:03.356 A:middle
critically and continuously

00:22:03.646 --> 00:22:04.686 A:middle
about what is and is not

00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:05.026 A:middle
measured.

00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:08.366 A:middle
We just talked about metrics

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:10.066 A:middle
which is how you understand if

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:11.646 A:middle
the model is good, how you

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:14.446 A:middle
evaluate a model.

00:22:14.606 --> 00:22:16.616 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the

00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:17.226 A:middle
interface.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.106 A:middle
Designing metrics in data is key

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.006 A:middle
to designing how your model

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:21.356 A:middle
behaves.

00:22:22.226 --> 00:22:23.766 A:middle
But we also have to figure out

00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:25.696 A:middle
how do we surface the model in

00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:26.236 A:middle
the interface.

00:22:26.436 --> 00:22:27.876 A:middle
And to do that, I'll hand it

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:30.096 A:middle
over to Rubii and Cas to talk

00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:31.696 A:middle
more about outputs/inputs.

00:22:31.946 --> 00:22:32.696 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:37.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:47.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As Kayur has shown, there's a

00:22:47.836 --> 00:22:49.856 A:middle
lot that goes into creating the

00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.286 A:middle
underlying machine learning

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.506 A:middle
system that powers an

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:53.136 A:middle
experience.

00:22:54.036 --> 00:22:55.356 A:middle
But we also need to design

00:22:55.356 --> 00:22:57.336 A:middle
interfaces that allow people to

00:22:57.336 --> 00:22:58.636 A:middle
interact with the experience in

00:22:58.636 --> 00:22:59.756 A:middle
an intuitive way.

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:02.926 A:middle
The interface can translate

00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:04.586 A:middle
results from a model to outputs

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:05.676 A:middle
that people can actually

00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:06.286 A:middle
interact with.

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.436 A:middle
The feedback we collect from

00:23:08.436 --> 00:23:10.466 A:middle
these interactions are inputs we

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:11.916 A:middle
can use to future improve the

00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:12.506 A:middle
experience.

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:16.996 A:middle
We've created a set of patterns

00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:18.126 A:middle
in the human interface

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.786 A:middle
guidelines to help you design

00:23:19.786 --> 00:23:21.086 A:middle
output and inputs.

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:23.336 A:middle
Cas and I will go in-depth

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:24.506 A:middle
through some of them to help you

00:23:24.506 --> 00:23:26.316 A:middle
understand how they apply to the

00:23:26.316 --> 00:23:27.236 A:middle
experience you're building.

00:23:27.236 --> 00:23:31.416 A:middle
First let's talk about outputs.

00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:34.326 A:middle
Outputs can be more than just

00:23:34.326 --> 00:23:34.856 A:middle
predictions.

00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:36.706 A:middle
They're a design medium that can

00:23:36.786 --> 00:23:38.306 A:middle
augment an experience into

00:23:38.306 --> 00:23:39.506 A:middle
something that feels more

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.326 A:middle
contextual and seamlessly

00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
helpful.

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.406 A:middle
There are four types of outputs

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:47.436 A:middle
we'll discuss.

00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:48.986 A:middle
Multiple options allow you to

00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:51.196 A:middle
present a diverse set of outputs

00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:53.686 A:middle
to people.

00:23:53.806 --> 00:23:55.626 A:middle
Attributions are explanations

00:23:55.816 --> 00:23:57.356 A:middle
that help people understand more

00:23:57.356 --> 00:23:58.596 A:middle
about how your app makes

00:23:58.656 --> 00:23:59.146 A:middle
decisions.

00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:02.876 A:middle
Confidence is a measurement of

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:06.556 A:middle
certainty for an output.

00:24:06.726 --> 00:24:08.426 A:middle
And limitations occurs when

00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:09.536 A:middle
there's a mismatch between

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:10.736 A:middle
people's mental model of a

00:24:10.736 --> 00:24:12.606 A:middle
feature and what the feature can

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:13.426 A:middle
actually do.

00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:16.836 A:middle
Let's start with multiple

00:24:16.836 --> 00:24:17.256 A:middle
options.

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:22.586 A:middle
As I had mentioned, multiple

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.126 A:middle
options allow people to choose

00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:25.646 A:middle
from among the results a feature

00:24:25.646 --> 00:24:26.106 A:middle
generates.

00:24:27.186 --> 00:24:28.296 A:middle
What does this actually mean?

00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:31.686 A:middle
Well it's often tempting to only

00:24:31.686 --> 00:24:33.306 A:middle
reveal the best option that was

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:34.546 A:middle
created by your model.

00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:35.936 A:middle
That's often not the best

00:24:35.936 --> 00:24:36.546 A:middle
experience.

00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:38.586 A:middle
Let me show you an example from

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:39.126 A:middle
the real world.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.786 A:middle
Last weekend I wanted to take a

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:43.516 A:middle
short trip and I asked my

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.306 A:middle
colleagues what's the best way

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:47.056 A:middle
to get between San Francisco and

00:24:47.056 --> 00:24:47.426 A:middle
Napa.

00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:50.516 A:middle
Depending on the person and the

00:24:50.516 --> 00:24:52.186 A:middle
time of day that I asked, the

00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:53.286 A:middle
answers varied.

00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:55.136 A:middle
Sometimes they would say take

00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:55.896 A:middle
the I-80.

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.516 A:middle
Sometimes they would say take

00:24:57.516 --> 00:24:57.976 A:middle
the 101.

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
This is because route prediction

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
This is because route prediction

00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:03.186 A:middle
is a complex task with a lot of

00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:04.366 A:middle
different variables that might

00:25:04.366 --> 00:25:05.556 A:middle
constantly be changing.

00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:07.636 A:middle
There might be traffic or

00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:09.056 A:middle
construction or even car

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:10.196 A:middle
accidents.

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:13.716 A:middle
Given all of that information,

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.696 A:middle
in Maps we try to predict the

00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:17.276 A:middle
best route possible but

00:25:17.276 --> 00:25:19.236 A:middle
sometimes a single option is not

00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:19.586 A:middle
enough.

00:25:21.096 --> 00:25:22.716 A:middle
We can't know everything that a

00:25:22.716 --> 00:25:24.176 A:middle
particular person may care

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:24.456 A:middle
about.

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.996 A:middle
They may prefer scenic routes or

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:28.856 A:middle
routes without tolls or routes

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:30.566 A:middle
not along highways.

00:25:32.856 --> 00:25:34.676 A:middle
Providing a set of meaningfully

00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:36.246 A:middle
different routes can help people

00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:37.566 A:middle
navigate the gap between their

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.766 A:middle
preferences and what a model can

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.726 A:middle
realistically predict.

00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:43.176 A:middle
Here, Maps gives us three

00:25:43.176 --> 00:25:45.116 A:middle
distinctly different routes: One

00:25:45.116 --> 00:25:46.486 A:middle
that goes to the North Bay and

00:25:46.486 --> 00:25:47.916 A:middle
two that go to the East Bay.

00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:50.056 A:middle
This can give people a sense of

00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:51.766 A:middle
control over how to get to their

00:25:51.766 --> 00:25:52.976 A:middle
final destination.

00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:57.696 A:middle
Whenever possible, you should

00:25:57.696 --> 00:25:59.556 A:middle
prefer diverse options that

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
encapsulate a meaningful

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
encapsulate a meaningful

00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:04.256 A:middle
selection of choices.

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:08.246 A:middle
People might also be using Maps

00:26:08.246 --> 00:26:09.736 A:middle
while on the go and some of the

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.056 A:middle
options might appear very

00:26:11.056 --> 00:26:12.746 A:middle
similar which makes it difficult

00:26:12.746 --> 00:26:14.086 A:middle
for people to quickly choose the

00:26:14.086 --> 00:26:14.226 A:middle
route.

00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:17.276 A:middle
We can also use attributions to

00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:18.336 A:middle
help people differentiate

00:26:18.336 --> 00:26:19.916 A:middle
between the options and make a

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:20.786 A:middle
choice faster.

00:26:22.816 --> 00:26:24.756 A:middle
Here, we show you whether a

00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:27.606 A:middle
route requires a toll, which

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.286 A:middle
highway it goes through and we

00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:31.936 A:middle
even highlight each path on the

00:26:31.936 --> 00:26:34.196 A:middle
map making it easier to find

00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:36.376 A:middle
that perfect scenic waterfront

00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:37.346 A:middle
drive.

00:26:39.336 --> 00:26:41.136 A:middle
These small summaries are a

00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:42.666 A:middle
great tool to help people

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:44.236 A:middle
differentiate between a broad

00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:45.776 A:middle
selection of options at a quick

00:26:45.776 --> 00:26:47.306 A:middle
glance and easily make a

00:26:47.306 --> 00:26:50.766 A:middle
selection while on the go.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:53.076 A:middle
Now I know Maps is an obvious

00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:54.716 A:middle
example for presenting options

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:56.656 A:middle
because it's reacting to very

00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:57.426 A:middle
explicit input.

00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.576 A:middle
I know where I am, where I want

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.316 A:middle
to go and I'm expecting a list

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.316 A:middle
to go and I'm expecting a list

00:27:01.316 --> 00:27:02.596 A:middle
of options that can get me

00:27:03.066 --> 00:27:03.166 A:middle
there.

00:27:03.736 --> 00:27:05.796 A:middle
But multiple options can also be

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:07.106 A:middle
useful for features that are

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:08.456 A:middle
proactively surfacing

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.336 A:middle
suggestions or it might be more

00:27:10.336 --> 00:27:12.246 A:middle
ambiguous what my current intent

00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:13.886 A:middle
and context is.

00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:17.376 A:middle
Let's talk about the watch.

00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:19.476 A:middle
When I start the day every

00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:21.686 A:middle
morning, I might want to check

00:27:22.076 --> 00:27:23.756 A:middle
the weather, see my first

00:27:23.756 --> 00:27:27.686 A:middle
appointment and see reminders of

00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:29.426 A:middle
what I need to do that day.

00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:31.536 A:middle
Siri watch face allows me to

00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:33.736 A:middle
customize up to 19 different

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.366 A:middle
data sources that I might want

00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:36.326 A:middle
to get information from

00:27:36.866 --> 00:27:38.736 A:middle
including weather, calendar, and

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:39.186 A:middle
reminders.

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:40.936 A:middle
You can even choose to see

00:27:40.936 --> 00:27:42.086 A:middle
information from third-party

00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:42.346 A:middle
apps.

00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:45.046 A:middle
Now information from 19

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:46.746 A:middle
different apps is a lot to look

00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:48.066 A:middle
at on such a small screen.

00:27:49.096 --> 00:27:50.446 A:middle
That's why Siri chooses to

00:27:50.516 --> 00:27:52.056 A:middle
surface a smaller selection of

00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:55.036 A:middle
options based on time, location,

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.356 A:middle
and what I've previously

00:27:56.356 --> 00:27:57.036 A:middle
interacted with.

00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:01.456 A:middle
Since my watch knows it's

00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:01.456 A:middle
Since my watch knows it's

00:28:01.456 --> 00:28:03.626 A:middle
morning time, I'm at home, and

00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:05.586 A:middle
in the past I've always selected

00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:06.986 A:middle
the option to turn on the lights

00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:07.976 A:middle
at the certain time.

00:28:08.466 --> 00:28:09.836 A:middle
It'll surface this as a top

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:11.256 A:middle
suggestion every morning.

00:28:11.776 --> 00:28:14.406 A:middle
Siri can understand my usage

00:28:14.406 --> 00:28:16.056 A:middle
history to help me automate this

00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:18.526 A:middle
mundane task without having to

00:28:18.526 --> 00:28:20.046 A:middle
scroll through this long list of

00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:22.146 A:middle
options when I first wake up.

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:24.086 A:middle
This makes getting up in the

00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:25.626 A:middle
morning so much more effortless

00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:26.706 A:middle
for someone who's not a morning

00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:28.286 A:middle
person, like me.

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:33.176 A:middle
This is important because every

00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:35.196 A:middle
time someone selects an option,

00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:36.466 A:middle
they're actually giving you

00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:38.396 A:middle
valuable implicit feedback that

00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:39.796 A:middle
you can use to make sure the

00:28:39.796 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
most relevant option is always

00:28:41.706 --> 00:28:44.416 A:middle
ranked at the top.

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:45.166 A:middle
If you learn from their

00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:46.666 A:middle
selection, you'll be able to

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.576 A:middle
surface better suggestions over

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:48.876 A:middle
time.

00:28:54.786 --> 00:28:55.926 A:middle
Now remember when we talked

00:28:55.926 --> 00:28:59.266 A:middle
about Maps and how attributions

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:00.676 A:middle
can be used to differentiate

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:00.676 A:middle
can be used to differentiate

00:29:01.566 --> 00:29:01.686 A:middle
routes?

00:29:03.276 --> 00:29:04.746 A:middle
Attributions can actually be

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:09.376 A:middle
used for so much more than that.

00:29:09.656 --> 00:29:11.406 A:middle
Attributions are explanations

00:29:11.576 --> 00:29:13.126 A:middle
that help people understand more

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.316 A:middle
about how your app makes

00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:14.816 A:middle
decisions.

00:29:15.346 --> 00:29:19.036 A:middle
Within the App Store, we use

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.546 A:middle
attributions to explain how

00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:22.086 A:middle
recommendations are created.

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:24.646 A:middle
This helps people understand why

00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:25.606 A:middle
they might be seeing certain

00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:27.596 A:middle
suggestions and how their data

00:29:27.596 --> 00:29:29.046 A:middle
is being used.

00:29:30.716 --> 00:29:32.366 A:middle
But let's say the App Store is

00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
showing me some recommendations

00:29:33.776 --> 00:29:35.006 A:middle
because I downloaded a cooking

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:36.046 A:middle
app.

00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:37.486 A:middle
Now I might have downloaded an

00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:39.316 A:middle
app to cook but that doesn't

00:29:39.316 --> 00:29:40.856 A:middle
necessarily mean I'm into

00:29:40.856 --> 00:29:41.186 A:middle
cooking.

00:29:41.676 --> 00:29:44.756 A:middle
Neither does it mean that I love

00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:46.366 A:middle
that particular app.

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:49.526 A:middle
Therefore, when using

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:50.726 A:middle
attributions to explain

00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:52.296 A:middle
suggestions, you should relate

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:53.866 A:middle
to objective facts rather than

00:29:53.866 --> 00:29:54.776 A:middle
subjective taste.

00:29:55.646 --> 00:29:57.316 A:middle
Here, we simply state that these

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:58.546 A:middle
suggestions are because you've

00:29:58.546 --> 00:29:59.626 A:middle
downloaded the "New York Times"

00:29:59.626 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
Cooking app.

00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:06.076 A:middle
We can never have a complete

00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.836 A:middle
picture of someone's taste and

00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:09.526 A:middle
preferences because they might

00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:11.056 A:middle
evolve on a daily basis.

00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:13.116 A:middle
People might also share an

00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:14.416 A:middle
account with their friends and

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:16.766 A:middle
family; therefore, profiling

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:18.646 A:middle
them makes them feel confused

00:30:18.896 --> 00:30:20.596 A:middle
and boxed in.

00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:22.076 A:middle
You should avoid profiling

00:30:22.076 --> 00:30:23.966 A:middle
people by not using language

00:30:23.966 --> 00:30:26.026 A:middle
that implies understanding or

00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:27.636 A:middle
judgment of their emotions and

00:30:27.636 --> 00:30:28.226 A:middle
preferences.

00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:34.226 A:middle
We can also use attributions to

00:30:34.226 --> 00:30:35.516 A:middle
help people understand the

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:37.206 A:middle
trustworthiness of a result.

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:40.026 A:middle
I'm an astronomy enthusiast and

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.436 A:middle
I wanted to see which planet was

00:30:41.436 --> 00:30:42.666 A:middle
visible in the sky tonight.

00:30:43.296 --> 00:30:45.426 A:middle
So I asked Siri, "When can you

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:46.036 A:middle
see Jupiter?"

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.216 A:middle
Siri tells me when the event

00:30:50.216 --> 00:30:52.926 A:middle
will happen but also gives me

00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:54.846 A:middle
more information from Wolfram

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:55.506 A:middle
Alpha.

00:30:56.156 --> 00:30:57.626 A:middle
This helps me understand that

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.146 A:middle
it's a reliable prediction

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.696 A:middle
because Wolfram Alpha is a

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.696 A:middle
because Wolfram Alpha is a

00:31:00.696 --> 00:31:02.206 A:middle
well-known knowledge engine.

00:31:03.026 --> 00:31:04.876 A:middle
This is really important when it

00:31:04.876 --> 00:31:06.366 A:middle
comes to displaying predictions

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:08.036 A:middle
where the trustworthiness of the

00:31:08.036 --> 00:31:10.266 A:middle
source really matters like

00:31:10.396 --> 00:31:12.106 A:middle
scientific information or

00:31:12.106 --> 00:31:12.826 A:middle
election results.

00:31:13.326 --> 00:31:18.426 A:middle
Cite data sources so people can

00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:20.316 A:middle
determine how reliable a certain

00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:20.976 A:middle
prediction might be.

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:28.866 A:middle
Now attributions can be used for

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.096 A:middle
more than just explaining

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:31.916 A:middle
personalization or predictions.

00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:33.316 A:middle
We can also use it to

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.516 A:middle
communicate confidence.

00:31:34.516 --> 00:31:38.986 A:middle
Let's look at the App Store

00:31:38.986 --> 00:31:40.946 A:middle
again and see how we really try

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:42.676 A:middle
to avoid technical jargon here.

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:46.296 A:middle
For example, we could've said

00:31:46.866 --> 00:31:48.906 A:middle
these apps are an 85% match for

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:51.086 A:middle
you but it's really difficult to

00:31:51.086 --> 00:31:53.006 A:middle
understand what 85% mean.

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:54.936 A:middle
That number might also mean

00:31:54.936 --> 00:31:56.016 A:middle
different things to different

00:31:56.016 --> 00:31:56.366 A:middle
people.

00:31:56.896 --> 00:32:00.686 A:middle
That's why we try to use a more

00:31:56.896 --> 00:32:00.686 A:middle
That's why we try to use a more

00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:02.826 A:middle
understandable explanation such

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:04.966 A:middle
as recommendations based on apps

00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:06.106 A:middle
you've downloaded.

00:32:06.626 --> 00:32:11.056 A:middle
That 85% I mentioned is a

00:32:11.056 --> 00:32:12.816 A:middle
measurement of confidence or how

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:14.556 A:middle
certain the model is that you'll

00:32:14.556 --> 00:32:15.706 A:middle
like the recommendations.

00:32:16.826 --> 00:32:18.566 A:middle
Confidence is what you get from

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:20.336 A:middle
a machine learning model but

00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:21.866 A:middle
it's important to translate it

00:32:21.946 --> 00:32:22.886 A:middle
into something more

00:32:22.886 --> 00:32:27.606 A:middle
understandable for people.

00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:29.626 A:middle
Sometimes it's OK to directly

00:32:29.626 --> 00:32:30.576 A:middle
display confidence.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:32.596 A:middle
The Weather app gives you

00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:33.756 A:middle
information that it's going to

00:32:33.756 --> 00:32:35.686 A:middle
rain but it also gives you a

00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:37.466 A:middle
percentage for how likely it's

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:39.166 A:middle
going to rain.

00:32:39.386 --> 00:32:41.516 A:middle
Now you might think what kind of

00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:42.926 A:middle
a decision should I make based

00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:44.186 A:middle
on this 30% chance.

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:46.156 A:middle
Is it worth bringing my

00:32:46.156 --> 00:32:46.596 A:middle
umbrella?

00:32:47.726 --> 00:32:48.836 A:middle
It's unclear.

00:32:49.136 --> 00:32:50.136 A:middle
But we've been conditioned to

00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:51.686 A:middle
understand this percentage over

00:32:52.646 --> 00:32:52.756 A:middle
time.

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:56.386 A:middle
And while numbers are

00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:57.996 A:middle
appropriate for statistical

00:32:57.996 --> 00:32:59.426 A:middle
predictions such as weather,

00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.646 A:middle
sports results or election

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.616 A:middle
predictions, it might not work

00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:04.596 A:middle
in other situations.

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:08.276 A:middle
This is Hopper.

00:33:09.056 --> 00:33:10.666 A:middle
It's an app that helps you book

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:11.346 A:middle
cheaper flights.

00:33:12.716 --> 00:33:14.246 A:middle
It uses confidence to tell

00:33:14.246 --> 00:33:15.466 A:middle
people whether the fare will go

00:33:15.466 --> 00:33:16.636 A:middle
up or down.

00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:19.416 A:middle
And we don't expect people to

00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:20.866 A:middle
grapple with percentages here

00:33:20.996 --> 00:33:22.236 A:middle
because in this context,

00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:23.876 A:middle
percentages are difficult to

00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:24.366 A:middle
interpret.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.146 A:middle
Seeing a 65% chance the price

00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:29.586 A:middle
will go down is not really

00:33:29.586 --> 00:33:30.216 A:middle
actionable.

00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:34.626 A:middle
How is 65% different than 70%?

00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:37.166 A:middle
The way Hopper presents

00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:38.676 A:middle
confidence is by giving you

00:33:38.676 --> 00:33:40.746 A:middle
actual suggestions for actions

00:33:40.746 --> 00:33:42.276 A:middle
you should take, whether you

00:33:42.276 --> 00:33:44.676 A:middle
should wait or buy now.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:48.666 A:middle
It also provides additional

00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:50.576 A:middle
context such as how much money

00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:51.906 A:middle
you're going to save and the

00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:53.386 A:middle
optimal time range to book a

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:53.706 A:middle
flight.

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:56.716 A:middle
These additional explanations

00:33:56.716 --> 00:33:58.456 A:middle
help people make a more informed

00:33:58.546 --> 00:33:59.736 A:middle
decision.

00:34:02.706 --> 00:34:03.866 A:middle
When confidence is used

00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:05.416 A:middle
appropriately, it can make an

00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.906 A:middle
experience feel so much more

00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:08.346 A:middle
human.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:11.406 A:middle
Most of the time you should

00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:13.126 A:middle
prefer to translate confidence

00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:15.295 A:middle
into easy-to-understand terms to

00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:16.446 A:middle
help people make a decision.

00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:22.376 A:middle
So by this point, you probably

00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:23.956 A:middle
understand that confidence can

00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:26.096 A:middle
be a great tool to help people

00:34:26.096 --> 00:34:27.696 A:middle
estimate how risky a certain

00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:30.516 A:middle
decision might be but there are

00:34:30.516 --> 00:34:31.766 A:middle
cases where this doesn't work.

00:34:33.106 --> 00:34:36.065 A:middle
For example, if I ask you how

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:37.406 A:middle
long it would take for me to get

00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:39.056 A:middle
between here and San Francisco

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:42.966 A:middle
and you replied, "I'm 72%

00:34:42.966 --> 00:34:44.585 A:middle
confident you'll get there at

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:45.096 A:middle
1:30."

00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:47.426 A:middle
That would be pretty confusing.

00:34:47.426 --> 00:34:49.476 A:middle
How can I be sure what time I'll

00:34:49.476 --> 00:34:53.876 A:middle
actually get home?

00:34:54.085 --> 00:34:55.446 A:middle
A better way is to provide a

00:34:55.446 --> 00:34:56.676 A:middle
range in the prediction.

00:34:57.546 --> 00:34:59.216 A:middle
With ride sharing, it's often

00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:00.716 A:middle
difficult to pinpoint an exact

00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:00.716 A:middle
difficult to pinpoint an exact

00:35:00.716 --> 00:35:02.746 A:middle
arrival time since there might

00:35:02.746 --> 00:35:04.246 A:middle
be traffic or the driver might

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:05.196 A:middle
pick up more riders.

00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:08.796 A:middle
Lyft help people estimate when

00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:09.706 A:middle
they will arrive at their

00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:11.436 A:middle
destination before they book a

00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:13.716 A:middle
ride by providing a range about

00:35:13.716 --> 00:35:15.086 A:middle
the time the driver will pick

00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:18.066 A:middle
you up and the time you will

00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:19.086 A:middle
arrive at the airport.

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:21.686 A:middle
These ranges help me have a

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.106 A:middle
realistic expectation of when

00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:23.946 A:middle
I'll actually get home.

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:30.126 A:middle
Range can be a great tool to

00:35:30.326 --> 00:35:32.026 A:middle
help people estimate how risky a

00:35:32.026 --> 00:35:33.796 A:middle
certain decision might be.

00:35:36.936 --> 00:35:38.866 A:middle
Now these are all good examples

00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:40.986 A:middle
of how to display confidence but

00:35:40.986 --> 00:35:42.366 A:middle
what do you do when there is low

00:35:42.366 --> 00:35:44.166 A:middle
confidence and the model doesn't

00:35:44.206 --> 00:35:45.476 A:middle
have enough information to

00:35:45.596 --> 00:35:46.926 A:middle
actually take an action?

00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:49.946 A:middle
In a lot of cases, we can

00:35:49.946 --> 00:35:51.826 A:middle
actually ask people for help.

00:35:53.616 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
For example, the Photos app can

00:35:56.366 --> 00:35:58.036 A:middle
automatically recognize people

00:35:58.566 --> 00:35:59.716 A:middle
in order to make searching for

00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.736 A:middle
their pictures easier.

00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.736 A:middle
their pictures easier.

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:03.696 A:middle
When Photos has low confidence

00:36:03.696 --> 00:36:05.666 A:middle
who is in a picture, it will ask

00:36:05.756 --> 00:36:07.296 A:middle
people to confirm additional

00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:09.466 A:middle
photos of that person before

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.806 A:middle
automatically labeling them.

00:36:12.196 --> 00:36:13.736 A:middle
Asking for confirmation is

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:14.986 A:middle
important because it'd be

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:16.526 A:middle
annoying if I saw pictures that

00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:18.306 A:middle
were marked as me that weren't

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:19.416 A:middle
photos of me at all.

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:23.616 A:middle
With every photo I mark as me,

00:36:24.426 --> 00:36:25.586 A:middle
Photos become better at

00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:27.506 A:middle
recognizing who I am.

00:36:28.736 --> 00:36:30.176 A:middle
This is an example of a

00:36:30.176 --> 00:36:31.956 A:middle
limitation that the facial

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.366 A:middle
recognition in Photos has,

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:39.326 A:middle
which also brings me to our last

00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:39.966 A:middle
output pattern.

00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:43.936 A:middle
So what actually is a

00:36:43.936 --> 00:36:44.526 A:middle
limitation?

00:36:45.556 --> 00:36:46.896 A:middle
A limitation is that when

00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:48.076 A:middle
there's a mismatch between

00:36:48.076 --> 00:36:49.516 A:middle
people's mental model of a

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:51.306 A:middle
feature and what the feature can

00:36:51.306 --> 00:36:52.346 A:middle
actually do.

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:55.636 A:middle
I might expect Photos to always

00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:57.456 A:middle
know who I am even though it

00:36:57.456 --> 00:36:59.206 A:middle
can't do that yet because a

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:00.976 A:middle
photo might be blurry or taken

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:00.976 A:middle
photo might be blurry or taken

00:37:00.976 --> 00:37:04.896 A:middle
in low light or not in focus.

00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:06.606 A:middle
Every feature has limitations

00:37:07.126 --> 00:37:09.056 A:middle
whether by design, capability,

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:09.976 A:middle
or circumstance.

00:37:10.556 --> 00:37:12.766 A:middle
You have to strengthen people's

00:37:12.766 --> 00:37:13.856 A:middle
trust in your app by

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:15.546 A:middle
acknowledging its limitations

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.676 A:middle
and teaching people how to work

00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:21.166 A:middle
with them.

00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:23.566 A:middle
Now Memoji is one of my favorite

00:37:23.566 --> 00:37:25.736 A:middle
features but people might not

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:27.526 A:middle
understand that it won't work in

00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:30.436 A:middle
certain scenarios, whether your

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:34.916 A:middle
face is not in view, something

00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:39.026 A:middle
is covering the camera, or

00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:40.636 A:middle
you're in a dark room.

00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:42.886 A:middle
Every time this limitation

00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:45.036 A:middle
occurs, we instantly show these

00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:46.956 A:middle
inline coaching tips to help

00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:48.736 A:middle
people move past the limitation

00:37:48.996 --> 00:37:50.236 A:middle
and successfully use the

00:37:50.286 --> 00:37:50.666 A:middle
feature.

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:54.216 A:middle
Explaining the limitations when

00:37:54.216 --> 00:37:55.826 A:middle
they happen help people learn to

00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:57.446 A:middle
avoid these situations in the

00:37:57.446 --> 00:37:57.896 A:middle
future.

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:03.066 A:middle
People might lose trust in your

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:03.066 A:middle
People might lose trust in your

00:38:03.066 --> 00:38:04.966 A:middle
feature if limitations are not

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:06.026 A:middle
appropriately addressed.

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:08.726 A:middle
You should take care to manage

00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:10.376 A:middle
people's expectations of what a

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:13.146 A:middle
feature can actually do and

00:38:13.146 --> 00:38:14.766 A:middle
guide people to move past

00:38:14.986 --> 00:38:15.666 A:middle
limitations.

00:38:19.726 --> 00:38:21.036 A:middle
Another way to help people move

00:38:21.096 --> 00:38:22.866 A:middle
past limitations is to suggest

00:38:22.966 --> 00:38:25.146 A:middle
alternative ways to accomplish

00:38:25.786 --> 00:38:26.666 A:middle
their goals.

00:38:26.856 --> 00:38:28.146 A:middle
In order to do this right, you

00:38:28.286 --> 00:38:29.936 A:middle
need to understand the goal well

00:38:29.936 --> 00:38:31.996 A:middle
enough to suggest alternatives

00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:32.946 A:middle
that actually make sense.

00:38:34.596 --> 00:38:36.636 A:middle
For example, if people ask Siri

00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:38.656 A:middle
to set a timer on a Mac, it

00:38:38.656 --> 00:38:40.426 A:middle
can't perform the action because

00:38:40.456 --> 00:38:43.286 A:middle
timers aren't available at

00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:45.346 A:middle
MacOS.

00:38:45.486 --> 00:38:47.156 A:middle
Instead of simply replying, "I

00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:48.736 A:middle
can't do it," which is kind of

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:50.746 A:middle
frustrating, Siri suggests

00:38:50.746 --> 00:38:52.076 A:middle
setting a reminder instead.

00:38:53.336 --> 00:38:54.506 A:middle
This suggestion actually makes

00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.456 A:middle
sense because Siri understands

00:38:56.726 --> 00:38:58.136 A:middle
that the goal is to receive an

00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:00.436 A:middle
alert at a certain time and

00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:00.436 A:middle
alert at a certain time and

00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:02.376 A:middle
setting a reminder accomplishes

00:39:02.456 --> 00:39:04.136 A:middle
the same goal as setting a

00:39:04.816 --> 00:39:04.956 A:middle
timer.

00:39:07.256 --> 00:39:08.996 A:middle
When possible, suggest

00:39:08.996 --> 00:39:10.266 A:middle
alternatives that can help

00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:11.586 A:middle
people accomplish their goals.

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:16.736 A:middle
I hope these patterns have given

00:39:16.736 --> 00:39:18.256 A:middle
you some ideas on different

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:19.966 A:middle
outputs that you can get from a

00:39:19.966 --> 00:39:20.946 A:middle
machine learning model.

00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:24.066 A:middle
But you have to remember that

00:39:24.066 --> 00:39:25.466 A:middle
outputs are a design medium.

00:39:26.566 --> 00:39:27.926 A:middle
By understanding the types of

00:39:27.926 --> 00:39:29.676 A:middle
outputs that are available, you

00:39:29.676 --> 00:39:31.676 A:middle
can choose outputs that align

00:39:31.676 --> 00:39:32.846 A:middle
with the experience you want to

00:39:32.846 --> 00:39:34.706 A:middle
build and not just rely on

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.266 A:middle
standard outputs from the model.

00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:39.306 A:middle
We should respect people's

00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:41.476 A:middle
agency and time by choosing

00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:42.906 A:middle
outputs that are easy to

00:39:42.906 --> 00:39:44.866 A:middle
understand and effortlessly

00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:45.286 A:middle
helpful.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.406 A:middle
As you've seen, there are many

00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:51.756 A:middle
different ways to translate

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.206 A:middle
outputs from the model to the

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:53.676 A:middle
interface.

00:39:54.366 --> 00:39:57.326 A:middle
But of course, outputs aren't

00:39:57.326 --> 00:39:57.756 A:middle
static.

00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:00.386 A:middle
They're dynamic and constantly

00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:00.386 A:middle
They're dynamic and constantly

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:01.646 A:middle
update based on inputs.

00:40:02.936 --> 00:40:04.136 A:middle
People interact with the

00:40:04.136 --> 00:40:05.956 A:middle
experience through inputs and

00:40:05.956 --> 00:40:07.446 A:middle
now Cas will tell you all about

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.656 A:middle
how to design for inputs.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:08.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:15.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:19.546 --> 00:40:21.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So Rubii showed a range of

00:40:21.006 --> 00:40:22.556 A:middle
outputs that people can interact

00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:24.726 A:middle
with on the interface and these

00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:26.476 A:middle
interactions serve as inputs

00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:27.796 A:middle
that we can use to collect

00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:29.576 A:middle
feedback for information from

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:31.446 A:middle
people so we can improve our

00:40:31.446 --> 00:40:32.056 A:middle
experience.

00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:34.346 A:middle
These are the four inputs we

00:40:34.346 --> 00:40:34.946 A:middle
will discuss.

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:38.136 A:middle
Calibration helps you get

00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:39.576 A:middle
essential information for

00:40:39.576 --> 00:40:40.786 A:middle
someone to engage in your

00:40:40.786 --> 00:40:41.426 A:middle
experience.

00:40:42.566 --> 00:40:43.706 A:middle
Calibration allows you to

00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:45.886 A:middle
collect important information

00:40:46.116 --> 00:40:47.466 A:middle
from interactions someone has

00:40:47.466 --> 00:40:48.506 A:middle
with your experience.

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:51.066 A:middle
Explicit feedback also allows

00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:52.586 A:middle
you to collect information but

00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:53.976 A:middle
this time by asking specific

00:40:53.976 --> 00:40:55.336 A:middle
questions about the results

00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:55.816 A:middle
you're showing.

00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:58.246 A:middle
And corrections allow people to

00:40:58.326 --> 00:40:59.996 A:middle
fix a mistake a model has made

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:02.006 A:middle
by using familiar interfaces.

00:41:02.826 --> 00:41:04.306 A:middle
So let's start with calibration.

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.256 A:middle
As I just said, calibrations

00:41:07.256 --> 00:41:08.436 A:middle
allow people to provide

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:09.906 A:middle
essential information for them

00:41:09.906 --> 00:41:11.396 A:middle
to engage in your experience.

00:41:12.126 --> 00:41:13.326 A:middle
We can use calibration for

00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:14.836 A:middle
example to collect biometric

00:41:14.836 --> 00:41:16.586 A:middle
data or data about your

00:41:16.586 --> 00:41:17.146 A:middle
surroundings.

00:41:17.966 --> 00:41:18.866 A:middle
Let me give an example.

00:41:19.836 --> 00:41:20.936 A:middle
Let's look at HomeCourt.

00:41:21.556 --> 00:41:22.896 A:middle
HomeCourt is an app that helps

00:41:22.896 --> 00:41:24.236 A:middle
you become a better basketball

00:41:24.296 --> 00:41:24.576 A:middle
player.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.536 A:middle
It uses machine learning to

00:41:26.536 --> 00:41:28.016 A:middle
analyze images from the camera

00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:29.696 A:middle
and detect for example how

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.526 A:middle
accurately you take shots at the

00:41:31.526 --> 00:41:31.816 A:middle
hoop.

00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:34.246 A:middle
In order to do so, the camera

00:41:34.246 --> 00:41:35.706 A:middle
needs to be calibrated so it can

00:41:35.706 --> 00:41:37.636 A:middle
detect you, the hoop and the

00:41:37.636 --> 00:41:37.876 A:middle
court.

00:41:38.436 --> 00:41:40.446 A:middle
And HomeCourt has done an

00:41:40.446 --> 00:41:42.046 A:middle
amazing job at doing this fast

00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:42.736 A:middle
and intuitively.

00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:44.286 A:middle
You simply point the

00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:45.936 A:middle
front-facing camera to the hoop

00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:47.656 A:middle
and it immediately detects it by

00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:49.006 A:middle
putting a wide square around it.

00:41:49.696 --> 00:41:50.916 A:middle
It then asks you to make one

00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:52.136 A:middle
shot and from then on, you're

00:41:52.136 --> 00:41:53.996 A:middle
good to go and it will start

00:41:53.996 --> 00:41:55.006 A:middle
counting your shots.

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.206 A:middle
What's remarkable here is what

00:41:58.206 --> 00:41:59.516 A:middle
HomeCourt is not asking you to

00:41:59.516 --> 00:41:59.706 A:middle
do.

00:42:00.396 --> 00:42:01.296 A:middle
For example, you don't have to

00:42:01.296 --> 00:42:02.646 A:middle
draw lines around the hoop or

00:42:02.646 --> 00:42:03.046 A:middle
the court.

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:05.536 A:middle
It doesn't ask for confirmation

00:42:05.536 --> 00:42:06.706 A:middle
on whether it got the hoop right

00:42:06.706 --> 00:42:07.086 A:middle
or wrong.

00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:08.926 A:middle
And you don't need to take shots

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.506 A:middle
from multiple angles.

00:42:12.076 --> 00:42:13.816 A:middle
Calibration also happens in some

00:42:13.816 --> 00:42:15.256 A:middle
of Apple's products, for example

00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:16.566 A:middle
when you set up Face ID.

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:19.406 A:middle
Face ID uses calibration to only

00:42:19.406 --> 00:42:21.036 A:middle
collect essential information.

00:42:21.986 --> 00:42:23.406 A:middle
It asks you to scan your face

00:42:23.406 --> 00:42:24.806 A:middle
twice and from then on, it is

00:42:24.806 --> 00:42:26.246 A:middle
set up and it will always keep

00:42:26.246 --> 00:42:27.646 A:middle
working regardless of whether

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:28.866 A:middle
you might start to wear glasses

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.316 A:middle
or change your hairstyle.

00:42:30.906 --> 00:42:33.196 A:middle
So when you're using

00:42:33.196 --> 00:42:35.106 A:middle
calibration, try to be quick and

00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:36.746 A:middle
effortless and only ask for

00:42:36.746 --> 00:42:39.036 A:middle
essential information and, when

00:42:39.036 --> 00:42:40.916 A:middle
possible, try to avoid the need

00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.556 A:middle
for multiple calibrations.

00:42:43.136 --> 00:42:46.456 A:middle
Once you're setting up Face ID,

00:42:46.596 --> 00:42:47.796 A:middle
we help you along the way.

00:42:48.226 --> 00:42:49.446 A:middle
We start with an introduction

00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:50.916 A:middle
that clearly states why your

00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:52.466 A:middle
phone needs to scan your face.

00:42:53.106 --> 00:42:54.256 A:middle
And we do this by explaining

00:42:54.256 --> 00:42:55.856 A:middle
both how it works and what it

00:42:55.856 --> 00:42:56.966 A:middle
will allow you to do.

00:42:57.456 --> 00:42:59.746 A:middle
Throughout the process, we

00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:00.736 A:middle
always give you a sense of

00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:00.736 A:middle
always give you a sense of

00:43:00.816 --> 00:43:01.296 A:middle
progress.

00:43:01.736 --> 00:43:03.036 A:middle
Here, we fill out the lines

00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:03.766 A:middle
around your face.

00:43:04.286 --> 00:43:07.906 A:middle
And if this progress might

00:43:07.906 --> 00:43:09.456 A:middle
stall, we make sure you never

00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:10.696 A:middle
get stuck and we provide

00:43:10.696 --> 00:43:11.826 A:middle
guidance to help you move

00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:12.466 A:middle
forward.

00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:14.626 A:middle
Here, we point arrows that point

00:43:14.626 --> 00:43:15.466 A:middle
in which way to look.

00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:19.126 A:middle
And at the end, we give the

00:43:19.126 --> 00:43:20.006 A:middle
notion of success.

00:43:20.396 --> 00:43:21.706 A:middle
We tell you the work is done and

00:43:21.706 --> 00:43:23.636 A:middle
the feature can be used now.

00:43:24.336 --> 00:43:26.096 A:middle
So always provide help by

00:43:26.096 --> 00:43:27.496 A:middle
introducing, guiding and

00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:29.136 A:middle
confirming the calibration.

00:43:29.696 --> 00:43:32.696 A:middle
Of course, Face ID collects a

00:43:32.696 --> 00:43:34.136 A:middle
lot of sensitive information.

00:43:34.376 --> 00:43:35.796 A:middle
And so to respect your privacy,

00:43:36.076 --> 00:43:37.546 A:middle
we give you a way to edit or

00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:39.046 A:middle
remove this information in

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:39.456 A:middle
Settings.

00:43:41.066 --> 00:43:42.776 A:middle
So when possible, allow people

00:43:42.776 --> 00:43:44.106 A:middle
to update their information.

00:43:44.686 --> 00:43:48.636 A:middle
Now as I said before, Face ID

00:43:48.636 --> 00:43:50.406 A:middle
asks for just one calibration

00:43:50.636 --> 00:43:51.896 A:middle
and from then on, it will keep

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:53.226 A:middle
working regardless of whether

00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:54.556 A:middle
you might start to wear glasses,

00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:56.376 A:middle
change your hairstyle, maybe

00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:58.156 A:middle
wear a hat or a scarf sometimes

00:43:58.566 --> 00:44:00.046 A:middle
or even as your face changes as

00:43:58.566 --> 00:44:00.046 A:middle
or even as your face changes as

00:44:00.046 --> 00:44:00.736 A:middle
you become older.

00:44:01.656 --> 00:44:02.886 A:middle
This was a big challenge when we

00:44:02.886 --> 00:44:03.736 A:middle
designed Face ID.

00:44:04.296 --> 00:44:05.756 A:middle
It would've been a lot easier to

00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:07.446 A:middle
occasionally ask to recalibrate

00:44:07.446 --> 00:44:09.396 A:middle
your face so your iPhone or iPad

00:44:09.486 --> 00:44:10.506 A:middle
could keep recognizing you.

00:44:11.336 --> 00:44:12.326 A:middle
But who would like to rescan

00:44:12.326 --> 00:44:13.656 A:middle
their face each time they change

00:44:13.656 --> 00:44:14.236 A:middle
their hairstyle?

00:44:15.356 --> 00:44:16.456 A:middle
So instead of asking for

00:44:16.456 --> 00:44:18.436 A:middle
multiple calibrations, Face ID

00:44:18.436 --> 00:44:20.196 A:middle
collects implicit feedback to

00:44:20.196 --> 00:44:21.566 A:middle
update the information about

00:44:21.566 --> 00:44:23.906 A:middle
your face each time you use Face

00:44:23.906 --> 00:44:24.046 A:middle
ID.

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:26.046 A:middle
And that brings us to our next

00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:28.536 A:middle
pattern which is implicit

00:44:29.536 --> 00:44:29.746 A:middle
feedback.

00:44:30.636 --> 00:44:32.566 A:middle
Implicit feedback is information

00:44:32.566 --> 00:44:33.346 A:middle
that arises from the

00:44:33.346 --> 00:44:34.886 A:middle
interactions people have with

00:44:34.886 --> 00:44:36.906 A:middle
your app and that information

00:44:36.906 --> 00:44:38.326 A:middle
can be used to improve the model

00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:39.346 A:middle
and your feature.

00:44:40.446 --> 00:44:42.006 A:middle
A very common example of using

00:44:42.006 --> 00:44:43.196 A:middle
implicit feedback is

00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:44.126 A:middle
personalization.

00:44:44.886 --> 00:44:46.616 A:middle
For example, Siri personalizes

00:44:46.736 --> 00:44:48.796 A:middle
the search experiences on iOS

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:50.336 A:middle
based on how you use your

00:44:50.336 --> 00:44:50.836 A:middle
device.

00:44:51.366 --> 00:44:53.716 A:middle
When you trigger the Search bar

00:44:53.716 --> 00:44:55.046 A:middle
on your Home screen, Siri

00:44:55.046 --> 00:44:56.536 A:middle
presents a range of apps you

00:44:56.536 --> 00:44:57.436 A:middle
might want to use.

00:44:58.366 --> 00:45:00.206 A:middle
Which apps appear here depends

00:44:58.366 --> 00:45:00.206 A:middle
Which apps appear here depends

00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:01.756 A:middle
on the implicit feedback you

00:45:01.756 --> 00:45:02.476 A:middle
give to Siri.

00:45:03.186 --> 00:45:04.096 A:middle
These might be apps you

00:45:04.096 --> 00:45:05.686 A:middle
frequently used, maybe ones

00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:07.466 A:middle
you've just used or ones you use

00:45:07.466 --> 00:45:08.846 A:middle
typically at this time of day.

00:45:09.826 --> 00:45:11.196 A:middle
For example in the car, I might

00:45:11.196 --> 00:45:13.086 A:middle
get Maps so I can get directions

00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:14.896 A:middle
or music and podcasts so I have

00:45:14.896 --> 00:45:15.816 A:middle
something to listen to.

00:45:16.786 --> 00:45:18.306 A:middle
At work, I might get apps that

00:45:18.306 --> 00:45:19.706 A:middle
help me at a meeting like Notes

00:45:19.706 --> 00:45:21.756 A:middle
or Reminders and at home, I

00:45:21.756 --> 00:45:22.926 A:middle
might get Messages to text

00:45:22.926 --> 00:45:25.116 A:middle
friends or family or suggestions

00:45:25.116 --> 00:45:26.956 A:middle
to check my activity or news.

00:45:27.446 --> 00:45:30.206 A:middle
Based on how I use these apps,

00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:32.306 A:middle
Siri tries to identify my intent

00:45:32.826 --> 00:45:34.286 A:middle
so it can surface apps to help

00:45:34.286 --> 00:45:35.686 A:middle
me achieve that intent.

00:45:36.626 --> 00:45:37.626 A:middle
So when you're using implicit

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:39.396 A:middle
feedback, strive to identify

00:45:39.396 --> 00:45:41.116 A:middle
people's intent by looking at

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:42.466 A:middle
how they interact with your

00:45:42.466 --> 00:45:42.856 A:middle
feature.

00:45:43.386 --> 00:45:47.466 A:middle
Over time, Siri will get better

00:45:47.466 --> 00:45:49.296 A:middle
at understanding my intent and,

00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:50.666 A:middle
apart from just showing apps as

00:45:50.666 --> 00:45:52.106 A:middle
a suggestion, it might also

00:45:52.106 --> 00:45:53.846 A:middle
start suggesting shortcuts of

00:45:53.896 --> 00:45:55.356 A:middle
actions I frequently perform.

00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:57.976 A:middle
For example in the car, I might

00:45:57.976 --> 00:45:59.176 A:middle
get directions to places I

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.236 A:middle
frequently visit or the location

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.236 A:middle
frequently visit or the location

00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:02.086 A:middle
of my next meeting.

00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:04.856 A:middle
At work, I might get shortcuts

00:46:04.886 --> 00:46:06.536 A:middle
to my meeting notes or my work

00:46:06.536 --> 00:46:07.146 A:middle
reminders.

00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:09.236 A:middle
And at home, I might get

00:46:09.236 --> 00:46:10.456 A:middle
shortcuts to turn on the lights

00:46:10.796 --> 00:46:12.256 A:middle
or message or FaceTime my

00:46:12.256 --> 00:46:13.616 A:middle
closest friends and family.

00:46:15.076 --> 00:46:16.776 A:middle
These shortcuts appear after a

00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:17.686 A:middle
few days or weeks.

00:46:18.206 --> 00:46:19.666 A:middle
The more specific they are, the

00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:21.256 A:middle
more certain Siri needs to be

00:46:21.346 --> 00:46:22.176 A:middle
about my intent.

00:46:23.196 --> 00:46:24.506 A:middle
As I said, these shortcuts are

00:46:24.506 --> 00:46:26.696 A:middle
based on implicit feedback, so

00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:27.976 A:middle
it might take a while for Siri

00:46:27.976 --> 00:46:29.366 A:middle
to be certain enough about a

00:46:29.366 --> 00:46:31.136 A:middle
suggestion and that's OK.

00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:33.496 A:middle
It's better to be patient and

00:46:33.496 --> 00:46:34.896 A:middle
become certain of a suggestion

00:46:35.406 --> 00:46:36.636 A:middle
than to be quick and show an

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:37.616 A:middle
unhelpful suggestion.

00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:40.566 A:middle
So bear in mind that implicit

00:46:40.606 --> 00:46:42.946 A:middle
feedback can be slow but it also

00:46:42.946 --> 00:46:44.666 A:middle
can be more accurate over time.

00:46:45.266 --> 00:46:48.966 A:middle
Now these suggestions can appear

00:46:48.966 --> 00:46:50.596 A:middle
on the Lock screen and it might

00:46:50.646 --> 00:46:51.676 A:middle
be that they contain some

00:46:51.676 --> 00:46:52.726 A:middle
sensitive information.

00:46:53.246 --> 00:46:54.956 A:middle
For example, it might show an

00:46:54.956 --> 00:46:55.996 A:middle
event you want to keep as a

00:46:55.996 --> 00:46:58.356 A:middle
surprise or notes you might want

00:46:58.496 --> 00:46:59.426 A:middle
to keep secret.

00:47:00.096 --> 00:47:02.196 A:middle
To respect people's privacy, we

00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:03.316 A:middle
added settings for you to

00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:05.286 A:middle
control which app and which app

00:47:05.286 --> 00:47:07.306 A:middle
shortcuts can appear in Search.

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.326 A:middle
So respect people's privacy and

00:47:11.326 --> 00:47:12.706 A:middle
give them full control over

00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:13.406 A:middle
their information.

00:47:13.866 --> 00:47:15.756 A:middle
Treat it privately and securely.

00:47:16.346 --> 00:47:19.246 A:middle
So implicit feedback is a great

00:47:19.246 --> 00:47:21.116 A:middle
tool for personalization but you

00:47:21.116 --> 00:47:22.486 A:middle
can also use it for some maybe

00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:24.476 A:middle
less obvious purposes, for

00:47:24.476 --> 00:47:25.586 A:middle
example simply making a

00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:27.586 A:middle
direction faster or more

00:47:27.586 --> 00:47:27.976 A:middle
accurate.

00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:30.386 A:middle
One good example has been with

00:47:30.386 --> 00:47:31.986 A:middle
us since the beginning of iOS

00:47:31.986 --> 00:47:32.716 A:middle
and that's the keyboard.

00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:36.456 A:middle
Each key on the keyboard has a

00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:38.466 A:middle
touch area and the keyboard uses

00:47:38.466 --> 00:47:39.996 A:middle
machine learning to optimize

00:47:39.996 --> 00:47:41.576 A:middle
these touch areas based on what

00:47:41.576 --> 00:47:41.936 A:middle
you type.

00:47:43.526 --> 00:47:44.936 A:middle
Each touch area might become

00:47:44.936 --> 00:47:46.516 A:middle
bigger or smaller depending on

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:47.996 A:middle
the word you're typing or the

00:47:47.996 --> 00:47:49.616 A:middle
way your fingers are positioned

00:47:49.616 --> 00:47:51.976 A:middle
on the keyboard.

00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:52.986 A:middle
Now notice that we're not

00:47:53.076 --> 00:47:54.586 A:middle
visibly making these buttons any

00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:55.466 A:middle
bigger or smaller.

00:47:55.536 --> 00:47:57.356 A:middle
The keyboard always appears in

00:47:57.356 --> 00:47:57.966 A:middle
the same way.

00:47:58.636 --> 00:48:00.046 A:middle
But over time, the keyboard

00:47:58.636 --> 00:48:00.046 A:middle
But over time, the keyboard

00:48:00.046 --> 00:48:01.106 A:middle
might start to feel more

00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:02.806 A:middle
accurate and more personalized

00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:03.956 A:middle
to you.

00:48:04.996 --> 00:48:06.926 A:middle
So use implicit feedback to make

00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:08.376 A:middle
your interactions more accurate

00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:09.306 A:middle
and delightful.

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:15.196 A:middle
One last example are the Siri

00:48:15.196 --> 00:48:16.556 A:middle
suggestions in Safari.

00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:18.916 A:middle
Safari uses machine learning to

00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:20.196 A:middle
collect links from messages,

00:48:20.416 --> 00:48:22.176 A:middle
mail, your reading lists, your

00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.446 A:middle
iCloud tabs, and other places.

00:48:24.216 --> 00:48:25.376 A:middle
And hopefully these suggestions

00:48:25.376 --> 00:48:26.716 A:middle
are good and they help you

00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:28.106 A:middle
discover interesting content

00:48:28.106 --> 00:48:29.866 A:middle
from your friends and family or

00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:31.156 A:middle
ones you've saved yourself.

00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:33.196 A:middle
Occasionally, though, you might

00:48:33.196 --> 00:48:34.496 A:middle
get suggestions you'd rather not

00:48:34.496 --> 00:48:36.536 A:middle
see, maybe an article you're not

00:48:36.536 --> 00:48:38.016 A:middle
interested in or a source you

00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:38.846 A:middle
don't really trust.

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.216 A:middle
If all of these suggestions turn

00:48:41.216 --> 00:48:42.786 A:middle
out to be unhelpful, you might

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.646 A:middle
start losing trust in the

00:48:44.646 --> 00:48:46.906 A:middle
suggestions or even worse, start

00:48:46.906 --> 00:48:48.406 A:middle
to lose trust in Safari.

00:48:48.906 --> 00:48:50.206 A:middle
And that is obviously something

00:48:50.206 --> 00:48:51.146 A:middle
we would like to avoid.

00:48:52.306 --> 00:48:53.766 A:middle
Rubii talked about attribution

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.936 A:middle
that can really help here in

00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:56.226 A:middle
explaining why we're showing

00:48:56.226 --> 00:48:58.206 A:middle
these suggestions but we also

00:48:58.206 --> 00:48:59.176 A:middle
want to make sure you can

00:48:59.176 --> 00:49:01.086 A:middle
control these suggestions so you

00:48:59.176 --> 00:49:01.086 A:middle
control these suggestions so you

00:49:01.086 --> 00:49:02.016 A:middle
can get rid of the ones you

00:49:02.016 --> 00:49:03.426 A:middle
don't want to see and make sure

00:49:03.426 --> 00:49:04.696 A:middle
they don't appear again.

00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:06.796 A:middle
And that brings us to our next

00:49:06.796 --> 00:49:08.716 A:middle
pattern which is explicit

00:49:09.276 --> 00:49:09.466 A:middle
feedback.

00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:12.976 A:middle
Explicit feedback allows your

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:14.646 A:middle
app to collect information by

00:49:14.646 --> 00:49:16.596 A:middle
asking specific questions about

00:49:16.596 --> 00:49:17.206 A:middle
your results.

00:49:17.756 --> 00:49:20.096 A:middle
In the previous example, it

00:49:20.096 --> 00:49:21.236 A:middle
would be great if I could get

00:49:21.236 --> 00:49:22.486 A:middle
feedback on these suggestions

00:49:22.536 --> 00:49:24.276 A:middle
that I don't want to see and

00:49:24.276 --> 00:49:26.036 A:middle
that way the model can learn and

00:49:26.036 --> 00:49:27.166 A:middle
can avoid showing similar

00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:28.696 A:middle
suggestions in the future.

00:49:30.056 --> 00:49:31.166 A:middle
So how do I design these

00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:31.976 A:middle
feedback actions?

00:49:32.556 --> 00:49:35.276 A:middle
Here are two actions that

00:49:35.356 --> 00:49:36.726 A:middle
frequently appear when we're

00:49:36.726 --> 00:49:38.186 A:middle
using explicit feedback: the

00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:39.216 A:middle
heart and the heart with a

00:49:39.216 --> 00:49:39.736 A:middle
strikethrough.

00:49:40.486 --> 00:49:41.746 A:middle
Now seeing these as buttons

00:49:41.746 --> 00:49:42.656 A:middle
leaves a lot of room for

00:49:42.656 --> 00:49:43.426 A:middle
interpretation.

00:49:44.126 --> 00:49:45.536 A:middle
It's unclear what will happen

00:49:45.536 --> 00:49:47.386 A:middle
when I press one of these even

00:49:47.386 --> 00:49:48.856 A:middle
if I add labels like Love or

00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:49.336 A:middle
Dislike.

00:49:50.566 --> 00:49:52.946 A:middle
Let's say I want to get feedback

00:49:52.946 --> 00:49:54.046 A:middle
on the third article here.

00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:55.866 A:middle
I can bring up the Action menu

00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:57.256 A:middle
and I can see the action Love.

00:49:58.866 --> 00:49:59.806 A:middle
That leaves a lot of room for

00:49:59.806 --> 00:50:00.516 A:middle
interpretation.

00:49:59.806 --> 00:50:00.516 A:middle
interpretation.

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:02.136 A:middle
Does this mean I have to love

00:50:02.186 --> 00:50:03.306 A:middle
every article that I like?

00:50:04.706 --> 00:50:06.056 A:middle
Positive explicit feedback

00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:07.526 A:middle
implies additional work.

00:50:08.236 --> 00:50:09.416 A:middle
People might think they have to

00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:10.996 A:middle
give positive explicit feedback

00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:13.196 A:middle
to every article they like just

00:50:13.196 --> 00:50:14.736 A:middle
to get more good suggestions.

00:50:15.626 --> 00:50:17.166 A:middle
So we actually recommend to

00:50:17.166 --> 00:50:18.536 A:middle
prioritize negative feedback

00:50:18.806 --> 00:50:19.546 A:middle
over positive.

00:50:20.346 --> 00:50:21.946 A:middle
Positive feedback can better be

00:50:21.946 --> 00:50:23.136 A:middle
inferred through implicit

00:50:23.136 --> 00:50:25.526 A:middle
signals, for example me reading

00:50:25.526 --> 00:50:27.426 A:middle
the article, bookmarking it or

00:50:27.426 --> 00:50:28.506 A:middle
sharing it.

00:50:29.716 --> 00:50:31.606 A:middle
So instead of showing both Love

00:50:31.606 --> 00:50:33.036 A:middle
and Dislike, we can actually

00:50:33.036 --> 00:50:34.606 A:middle
only show Dislike.

00:50:35.516 --> 00:50:36.746 A:middle
But still, that leaves a lot of

00:50:36.746 --> 00:50:37.666 A:middle
room for interpretation.

00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:39.816 A:middle
If I dislike an article, am I

00:50:39.816 --> 00:50:41.286 A:middle
disliking the article, the

00:50:41.286 --> 00:50:43.396 A:middle
author, the source, the person

00:50:43.396 --> 00:50:45.016 A:middle
who sent it to me, or maybe even

00:50:45.016 --> 00:50:46.216 A:middle
the app in which I received it?

00:50:46.986 --> 00:50:47.826 A:middle
It's still difficult to

00:50:47.826 --> 00:50:50.426 A:middle
understand what will happen when

00:50:50.426 --> 00:50:52.366 A:middle
I tap Dislike.

00:50:52.496 --> 00:50:53.906 A:middle
Words like "suggest less" or

00:50:53.906 --> 00:50:55.476 A:middle
"hide the suggestion" make it

00:50:55.506 --> 00:50:57.036 A:middle
much easier to understand what

00:50:57.036 --> 00:50:58.216 A:middle
will happen when I tap such a

00:50:58.216 --> 00:50:59.196 A:middle
button.

00:51:00.196 --> 00:51:01.216 A:middle
To give people even more

00:51:01.216 --> 00:51:02.676 A:middle
control, we can allow them to

00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:04.396 A:middle
select exactly what they like to

00:51:04.396 --> 00:51:06.356 A:middle
see less, for example less of

00:51:06.356 --> 00:51:08.086 A:middle
the source, the person who sent

00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:09.726 A:middle
it to me or the app in which I

00:51:09.726 --> 00:51:10.846 A:middle
received it.

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.126 A:middle
So when using explicit feedback,

00:51:14.526 --> 00:51:16.146 A:middle
clearly describe the option and

00:51:16.146 --> 00:51:17.006 A:middle
its consequences.

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.246 A:middle
Use words that describe what

00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:19.716 A:middle
will happen.

00:51:19.936 --> 00:51:21.456 A:middle
And when possible, provide

00:51:21.576 --> 00:51:22.716 A:middle
different options to better

00:51:22.716 --> 00:51:23.926 A:middle
understand the user's

00:51:23.926 --> 00:51:24.426 A:middle
preference.

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:28.446 A:middle
And of course, when I select one

00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:29.956 A:middle
of these options, the interface

00:51:29.956 --> 00:51:31.126 A:middle
should immediately reflect my

00:51:31.126 --> 00:51:33.066 A:middle
choice and hide the suggestions

00:51:33.236 --> 00:51:34.536 A:middle
that match my preference.

00:51:37.076 --> 00:51:38.796 A:middle
So always act immediately and

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:40.496 A:middle
persistently when the user gives

00:51:40.746 --> 00:51:42.066 A:middle
explicit feedback.

00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:45.226 A:middle
So you've seen that explicit

00:51:45.226 --> 00:51:46.636 A:middle
feedback allows us to correct

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.196 A:middle
suggestions that might be wrong,

00:51:48.196 --> 00:51:49.646 A:middle
unwanted or inappropriate.

00:51:50.616 --> 00:51:51.546 A:middle
But for some machine learning

00:51:51.546 --> 00:51:53.106 A:middle
features, using explicit

00:51:53.106 --> 00:51:55.216 A:middle
feedback might not be the right

00:51:55.216 --> 00:51:56.766 A:middle
choice or might not even be

00:51:56.766 --> 00:51:57.296 A:middle
possible.

00:51:58.386 --> 00:52:00.346 A:middle
Here's Angie again, the dog from

00:51:58.386 --> 00:52:00.346 A:middle
Here's Angie again, the dog from

00:52:00.346 --> 00:52:00.726 A:middle
our friends.

00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:02.366 A:middle
She's often the main topic in

00:52:02.366 --> 00:52:03.276 A:middle
our group conversation.

00:52:04.716 --> 00:52:05.996 A:middle
Now the keyboard uses machine

00:52:05.996 --> 00:52:07.876 A:middle
learning to suggest corrections

00:52:07.876 --> 00:52:08.746 A:middle
of what I'm typing.

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:10.816 A:middle
And when I initially type the

00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:12.366 A:middle
word "Angie," it wanted to

00:52:12.366 --> 00:52:14.036 A:middle
correct it to the word "angle."

00:52:14.856 --> 00:52:16.266 A:middle
Now that's obviously wrong but

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.796 A:middle
using explicit feedback here

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:19.196 A:middle
seems a little bit off.

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:20.696 A:middle
Let's say I can bring up a

00:52:20.696 --> 00:52:21.696 A:middle
contextual menu here.

00:52:22.936 --> 00:52:24.346 A:middle
This doesn't feel very intuitive

00:52:24.686 --> 00:52:25.896 A:middle
and it doesn't really allow me

00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:27.386 A:middle
to say what I actually meant.

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.716 A:middle
Instead, I can simply select the

00:52:30.716 --> 00:52:33.436 A:middle
words and correct the suggestion

00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:34.516 A:middle
the keyboard has made by

00:52:34.516 --> 00:52:36.626 A:middle
retyping it and this time the

00:52:36.626 --> 00:52:38.066 A:middle
keyboard will not autocorrect

00:52:38.066 --> 00:52:38.166 A:middle
it.

00:52:38.826 --> 00:52:39.976 A:middle
The keyboard learned from my

00:52:39.976 --> 00:52:41.706 A:middle
correction and the next time I

00:52:41.706 --> 00:52:43.636 A:middle
type in Angie, it knows I'm

00:52:43.636 --> 00:52:45.386 A:middle
referring to a name and not the

00:52:45.386 --> 00:52:46.176 A:middle
word "angle."

00:52:47.186 --> 00:52:48.696 A:middle
This is the most obvious example

00:52:48.906 --> 00:52:50.436 A:middle
of our last pattern which is

00:52:50.556 --> 00:52:51.106 A:middle
corrections.

00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:55.596 A:middle
Corrections allow people to fix

00:52:55.596 --> 00:52:57.316 A:middle
a mistake a model has made by

00:52:57.316 --> 00:52:58.336 A:middle
using known tasks.

00:52:58.796 --> 00:52:59.986 A:middle
And with known tasks, I'll

00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:00.766 A:middle
explain what that means.

00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:00.766 A:middle
explain what that means.

00:53:01.806 --> 00:53:03.106 A:middle
In the previous example, you've

00:53:03.106 --> 00:53:04.346 A:middle
seen that we corrected this

00:53:04.676 --> 00:53:08.966 A:middle
using standard text controls.

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.816 A:middle
There was no new interface that

00:53:10.816 --> 00:53:11.476 A:middle
we showed here.

00:53:11.946 --> 00:53:13.436 A:middle
Everybody knows how to do this

00:53:13.506 --> 00:53:14.686 A:middle
since this is how the keyboard's

00:53:14.906 --> 00:53:15.536 A:middle
always worked.

00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:17.986 A:middle
Corrections are, therefore, an

00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:19.536 A:middle
amazing pattern to optimize your

00:53:19.536 --> 00:53:21.436 A:middle
results without feeling like

00:53:21.436 --> 00:53:22.076 A:middle
extra work.

00:53:22.626 --> 00:53:24.916 A:middle
Let me give another example.

00:53:25.976 --> 00:53:27.526 A:middle
Photos uses machine learning to

00:53:27.526 --> 00:53:28.556 A:middle
optimize your pictures.

00:53:29.216 --> 00:53:30.496 A:middle
It can help find to the right

00:53:30.496 --> 00:53:32.096 A:middle
rotation or cropping your

00:53:32.096 --> 00:53:32.976 A:middle
pictures could take.

00:53:34.276 --> 00:53:35.536 A:middle
The way Photos suggest these

00:53:35.536 --> 00:53:38.406 A:middle
croppings or rotations is quite

00:53:38.406 --> 00:53:38.746 A:middle
subtle.

00:53:39.576 --> 00:53:40.806 A:middle
When you go into Edit mode and

00:53:40.806 --> 00:53:42.056 A:middle
select Rotation or Cropping

00:53:42.056 --> 00:53:44.456 A:middle
tool, photos will crop or rotate

00:53:44.456 --> 00:53:45.336 A:middle
the picture for you.

00:53:46.096 --> 00:53:47.386 A:middle
Now it doesn't apply the

00:53:47.476 --> 00:53:49.346 A:middle
rotation or cropping, it simply

00:53:49.346 --> 00:53:50.866 A:middle
suggests it as a starting point.

00:53:51.936 --> 00:53:53.036 A:middle
If you like what Photos has

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.596 A:middle
done, you can simply tap Done

00:53:54.976 --> 00:53:56.966 A:middle
and the rotation or cropping is

00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:57.346 A:middle
applied.

00:53:57.346 --> 00:53:59.276 A:middle
But if you'd like to change what

00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:01.066 A:middle
Photos has suggested, you can

00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:01.066 A:middle
Photos has suggested, you can

00:54:01.066 --> 00:54:02.566 A:middle
simply use the slider at the

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:04.256 A:middle
bottom to rotate or drag the

00:54:04.256 --> 00:54:05.346 A:middle
corners to crop.

00:54:05.346 --> 00:54:07.386 A:middle
So these are great examples of

00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:07.886 A:middle
corrections.

00:54:08.426 --> 00:54:10.046 A:middle
We show you familiar controls

00:54:10.516 --> 00:54:11.196 A:middle
and we learn from the

00:54:11.196 --> 00:54:12.356 A:middle
corrections you make.

00:54:13.046 --> 00:54:15.936 A:middle
So that concludes the last

00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:16.236 A:middle
pattern.

00:54:17.276 --> 00:54:18.236 A:middle
Allow corrections through

00:54:18.236 --> 00:54:18.906 A:middle
familiar ways.

00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:20.866 A:middle
This makes it easy and fast for

00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:21.696 A:middle
somebody to correct.

00:54:22.666 --> 00:54:24.136 A:middle
Provide immediate value when

00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:25.256 A:middle
somebody makes a correction.

00:54:25.466 --> 00:54:26.406 A:middle
As we saw with the text

00:54:26.406 --> 00:54:28.396 A:middle
correction, the keyboard won't

00:54:28.396 --> 00:54:29.616 A:middle
autocorrect things that we

00:54:29.616 --> 00:54:29.926 A:middle
typed.

00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:32.436 A:middle
And use corrections as implicit

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:32.886 A:middle
feedback.

00:54:33.276 --> 00:54:34.446 A:middle
Corrections work great as

00:54:34.446 --> 00:54:36.076 A:middle
implicit feedback to improve

00:54:36.396 --> 00:54:37.766 A:middle
your machine learning results.

00:54:38.346 --> 00:54:41.566 A:middle
So those are all the interface

00:54:41.566 --> 00:54:42.676 A:middle
patterns we wanted to show you

00:54:42.676 --> 00:54:42.996 A:middle
today.

00:54:43.766 --> 00:54:45.026 A:middle
As you can see, many of these

00:54:45.026 --> 00:54:46.536 A:middle
patterns leverage existing

00:54:46.536 --> 00:54:48.216 A:middle
interface elements we've had for

00:54:48.216 --> 00:54:48.816 A:middle
a long time.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.436 A:middle
Machine learning, therefore, is

00:54:51.436 --> 00:54:52.916 A:middle
an elevation of what we've been

00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:53.756 A:middle
doing all along.

00:54:54.436 --> 00:54:55.236 A:middle
These patterns are not

00:54:55.236 --> 00:54:56.886 A:middle
necessarily new but they are

00:54:56.966 --> 00:54:57.976 A:middle
applied in a new context.

00:54:58.096 --> 00:55:00.536 A:middle
And whenever we choose our

00:54:58.096 --> 00:55:00.536 A:middle
And whenever we choose our

00:55:00.536 --> 00:55:02.046 A:middle
patterns, we have to make sure

00:55:02.046 --> 00:55:03.446 A:middle
we respect people's work.

00:55:04.456 --> 00:55:06.266 A:middle
Adding additional attribution or

00:55:06.266 --> 00:55:08.246 A:middle
additional feedback actions asks

00:55:08.246 --> 00:55:09.496 A:middle
even more information for

00:55:09.496 --> 00:55:11.246 A:middle
someone to parse and that

00:55:11.246 --> 00:55:12.406 A:middle
invades their attention and

00:55:12.406 --> 00:55:13.996 A:middle
might distract them from their

00:55:13.996 --> 00:55:14.786 A:middle
task at hand.

00:55:15.536 --> 00:55:16.816 A:middle
So choose your patterns with

00:55:16.866 --> 00:55:18.466 A:middle
people in mind first.

00:55:18.946 --> 00:55:22.416 A:middle
So designing a machine learning

00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:23.786 A:middle
experience is not just

00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:24.946 A:middle
outputting your results in an

00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:25.446 A:middle
interface.

00:55:26.376 --> 00:55:27.626 A:middle
The way we select our data,

00:55:27.806 --> 00:55:29.526 A:middle
metrics, inputs and outputs

00:55:29.836 --> 00:55:31.546 A:middle
plays a very important role in

00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:32.746 A:middle
making these experiences

00:55:32.816 --> 00:55:34.856 A:middle
understandable, intuitive and

00:55:34.856 --> 00:55:35.256 A:middle
delightful.

00:55:35.906 --> 00:55:39.716 A:middle
Now to end our talk, I want to

00:55:39.716 --> 00:55:40.916 A:middle
go back to something that Kayur

00:55:40.916 --> 00:55:41.786 A:middle
said in the beginning.

00:55:42.796 --> 00:55:44.156 A:middle
Apple uses machine learning to

00:55:44.156 --> 00:55:45.906 A:middle
create products and experiences

00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:47.416 A:middle
we could never create before,

00:55:47.876 --> 00:55:49.136 A:middle
products and experiences we

00:55:49.186 --> 00:55:49.956 A:middle
really care about.

00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:52.236 A:middle
You've seen examples of how

00:55:52.236 --> 00:55:53.826 A:middle
machine learning helps us manage

00:55:53.826 --> 00:55:55.986 A:middle
our attention, on how it allows

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:56.676 A:middle
us to give you better

00:55:56.676 --> 00:55:58.656 A:middle
recommendations, on how it can

00:55:58.656 --> 00:56:00.276 A:middle
present contextual information

00:55:58.656 --> 00:56:00.276 A:middle
present contextual information

00:56:00.276 --> 00:56:01.896 A:middle
at the right time, and how we

00:56:01.896 --> 00:56:03.946 A:middle
can automate mundane tasks so

00:56:04.156 --> 00:56:05.646 A:middle
you can focus on what matters.

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:07.716 A:middle
But machine learning can help us

00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:09.086 A:middle
achieve much more than that.

00:56:10.356 --> 00:56:11.846 A:middle
Apple has always used technology

00:56:11.846 --> 00:56:13.886 A:middle
to empower everyone and machine

00:56:13.886 --> 00:56:15.486 A:middle
learning only elevates that

00:56:15.486 --> 00:56:16.116 A:middle
capability.

00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:19.416 A:middle
It can empower us to be healthy

00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:22.186 A:middle
by measuring our activity and

00:56:23.016 --> 00:56:25.746 A:middle
our steps.

00:56:25.936 --> 00:56:27.336 A:middle
Machine learning allows us to be

00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:29.206 A:middle
more inclusive by leveraging our

00:56:29.476 --> 00:56:31.426 A:middle
communication, for example by

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.776 A:middle
adding voice control to the

00:56:32.776 --> 00:56:34.456 A:middle
camera so a blind person can see

00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:35.886 A:middle
what they're holding or it can

00:56:35.886 --> 00:56:37.336 A:middle
know when their loved ones are

00:56:38.116 --> 00:56:40.216 A:middle
in frame.

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:41.566 A:middle
Machine learning helps us to be

00:56:41.566 --> 00:56:43.416 A:middle
safe by detecting problems with

00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:46.016 A:middle
our heart by measuring our heart

00:56:46.016 --> 00:56:48.126 A:middle
beats or an ECG.

00:56:48.346 --> 00:56:49.976 A:middle
And lastly, it can allow us to

00:56:49.976 --> 00:56:51.656 A:middle
be creative by seeing the world

00:56:51.656 --> 00:56:53.606 A:middle
in a whole new way, for example

00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:54.856 A:middle
by letting a known tool like a

00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:56.946 A:middle
pencil do magic things on

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.286 A:middle
screen.

00:56:58.896 --> 00:57:00.926 A:middle
So you can see when we align the

00:56:58.896 --> 00:57:00.926 A:middle
So you can see when we align the

00:57:00.926 --> 00:57:02.836 A:middle
we create with the values we

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.246 A:middle
uphold, we can create

00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:05.786 A:middle
experiences that really elevate

00:57:05.846 --> 00:57:06.766 A:middle
the best of humanity.

00:57:07.316 --> 00:57:09.186 A:middle
That's everything we had in

00:57:09.186 --> 00:57:10.516 A:middle
store for you and we hope we've

00:57:10.566 --> 00:57:11.986 A:middle
given you plenty of inspiration,

00:57:11.986 --> 00:57:13.576 A:middle
insight into designing great

00:57:13.576 --> 00:57:14.716 A:middle
machine learning experiences.

00:57:15.806 --> 00:57:17.086 A:middle
All the patterns we talked about

00:57:17.086 --> 00:57:18.646 A:middle
and more are available on the

00:57:18.646 --> 00:57:20.456 A:middle
Human Interface Guidelines as a

00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:21.196 A:middle
beta.

00:57:21.876 --> 00:57:23.416 A:middle
There are still a few more talks

00:57:23.416 --> 00:57:24.556 A:middle
this afternoon about machine

00:57:24.556 --> 00:57:26.026 A:middle
learning and all of us will be

00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:28.196 A:middle
available in the coming hour at

00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:29.546 A:middle
the User Interface Design Lab to

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.706 A:middle
answer any questions you might

00:57:30.706 --> 00:57:30.946 A:middle
have.

00:57:31.226 --> 00:57:32.916 A:middle
So make sure to come by and say

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:33.146 A:middle
hi.

00:57:33.866 --> 00:57:34.936 A:middle
Thank you all for attending and

00:57:34.936 --> 00:57:35.966 A:middle
enjoy the last day of WWDC.

00:57:36.016 --> 00:57:38.000 A:middle
