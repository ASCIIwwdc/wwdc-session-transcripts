00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:09.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.386 A:middle
Well, Xcode 11 has a ton of new

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.106 A:middle
features and improvements.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:20.896 A:middle
Everything the tools do is in

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:22.016 A:middle
support of getting you from an

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:23.936 A:middle
idea, through development to

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:26.156 A:middle
delivering a great product.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.476 A:middle
We want the tools to make you

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.796 A:middle
more productive, so you can

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.576 A:middle
spend more time dreaming up and

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:32.766 A:middle
implementing the next great

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:32.986 A:middle
thing.

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.066 A:middle
So, this year we focused on

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.636 A:middle
making it more efficient and

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:41.016 A:middle
faster for you to use the tools

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.536 A:middle
we rethought some of the basic

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:43.526 A:middle
workflows.

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:44.846 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:48.236 A:middle
We'll start with a quick recap

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:49.816 A:middle
of Xcode 10.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.126 A:middle
Now in Xcode 10, there's three

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:54.366 A:middle
main Editor modes, Standard,

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.496 A:middle
Assistant and Version, and they

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:57.686 A:middle
live up here in the toolbar,

00:00:57.896 --> 00:00:59.146 A:middle
because they apply to the entire

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
windows content.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
windows content.

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:03.216 A:middle
Now, the Version Editor, it's

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.446 A:middle
got three modes of its own,

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.876 A:middle
Comparison, Authors, and Log.

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:08.656 A:middle
So, you've got a lot of

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.396 A:middle
functionality available to you.

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:12.236 A:middle
You just have to pick the one

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:12.976 A:middle
thing that you're most

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:13.526 A:middle
interested in.

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:15.586 A:middle
Well, we heard your feedback

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:16.696 A:middle
that you wanted more

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:17.526 A:middle
flexibility.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.956 A:middle
And so, we, we made some

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:20.636 A:middle
improvements.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:24.046 A:middle
At first, we took the Source

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:25.966 A:middle
Control Log information, and we

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.346 A:middle
moved it over to the Inspector,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:29.476 A:middle
where it's now available all the

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:30.776 A:middle
time for any file.

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:32.526 A:middle
So, you can bring it in when you

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.396 A:middle
need it, without ever disrupting

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.046 A:middle
what's in the main editor area.

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:39.306 A:middle
And next, we wanted to let you

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.346 A:middle
change each Editor Panes mode

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.416 A:middle
independently, because we know

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.406 A:middle
that different file types like

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:47.006 A:middle
Source Code and Storyboards,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:48.246 A:middle
they have very different

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:48.836 A:middle
workflows.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.586 A:middle
So we move the Assistant and the

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:53.886 A:middle
Authors out of the main toolbar

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:56.286 A:middle
down into each editor pane.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.706 A:middle
So, now you can choose the right

00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:59.226 A:middle
mode for each editor.

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.816 A:middle
Now a lot of people use the

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.816 A:middle
Now a lot of people use the

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.566 A:middle
Assistant today to split up

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.206 A:middle
their Xcode window with multiple

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:05.836 A:middle
editors.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:08.656 A:middle
Well in Xcode 11, you can create

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:11.196 A:middle
splits anytime, anywhere.

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:13.616 A:middle
And you can split both

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.816 A:middle
horizontally, as well as

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.556 A:middle
vertically, all within the same

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:17.916 A:middle
window.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:21.016 A:middle
So, there's a lot of added

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.406 A:middle
flexibility this year which

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:23.916 A:middle
really does make it easier than

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.576 A:middle
ever to work the way that you

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:25.946 A:middle
want.

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:29.046 A:middle
Now there is no better way to

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:30.846 A:middle
see this than in a demo.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:32.266 A:middle
So, here to show it to you now

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:33.146 A:middle
is Brendan.

[ Applause ]

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:39.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ken.

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:44.166 A:middle
So, we've given Xcode a bit of a

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.796 A:middle
renovation this year to give you

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.246 A:middle
more control of your workspace.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.076 A:middle
One of the most visible changes,

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:53.006 A:middle
is to the Editor Splitting and

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:54.036 A:middle
the Assistant.

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:55.616 A:middle
So, let me start with the

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.276 A:middle
Assistant, and its new companion

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.876 A:middle
mode, the SwiftUI Canvas.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.876 A:middle
mode, the SwiftUI Canvas.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:02.676 A:middle
Each editor has an options menu

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:03.296 A:middle
in the top right.

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:05.546 A:middle
This is where you control the

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:07.636 A:middle
behavior of the editor.

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:09.366 A:middle
I have this one set to Editor in

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.556 A:middle
Canvas, which means that if

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:13.686 A:middle
there is a SwiftUI preview to

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:16.016 A:middle
show, Xcode will show it.

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:16.976 A:middle
In this case, there is no

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:17.366 A:middle
preview.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:18.876 A:middle
So there's nothing to see.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:21.386 A:middle
But if I switch over to a file

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
that has a preview the Canvas

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:24.496 A:middle
appears and Xcode renders a

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:25.616 A:middle
preview of my UI.

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.376 A:middle
Now, the Assistant works the

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:28.816 A:middle
same way.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:31.016 A:middle
If I switch over to the

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:32.186 A:middle
Assistant using the options

00:03:32.216 --> 00:03:34.496 A:middle
menu, Xcode will show me the

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.746 A:middle
generated interface for this

00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:38.406 A:middle
file.

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:39.996 A:middle
But if I switch to a file that

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:42.216 A:middle
doesn't have an Assistant, like

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:44.156 A:middle
the project, it gets out of the

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:44.356 A:middle
way.

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:46.376 A:middle
There's no space wasted and

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.626 A:middle
there's no need for me to spend

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.286 A:middle
time manually switching modes as

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.256 A:middle
I switch between files.

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.936 A:middle
All right.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.176 A:middle
When I switch back to a source

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.966 A:middle
file, of course, it remembers

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:57.776 A:middle
the state I was in, the

00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:58.666 A:middle
Assistant comes back.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.786 A:middle
So, that's the Assistant, and

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.786 A:middle
So, that's the Assistant, and

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:04.086 A:middle
the SwiftUI Canvas, let's talk

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.056 A:middle
about Editor Splitting.

00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:07.326 A:middle
The first thing is, it no longer

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:08.386 A:middle
requires the Assistant.

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.246 A:middle
So, let me get that out of the

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:10.986 A:middle
way.

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:12.106 A:middle
So, there's a few different ways

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.146 A:middle
I can split this window up.

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:14.856 A:middle
I'm going to start with the Add

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.505 A:middle
Editor button, which is up here

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:17.826 A:middle
in the corner, next to the

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:18.565 A:middle
options menu.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:20.826 A:middle
When I click that, I get two

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:21.745 A:middle
independent editors.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.656 A:middle
These editors have their own

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:24.266 A:middle
state.

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:26.046 A:middle
So if I want to, I can turn on

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:27.306 A:middle
modes like Code Coverage or

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:28.856 A:middle
Authors for each editor

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:29.486 A:middle
individually.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:32.176 A:middle
The new editor is active.

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.446 A:middle
So to load another file into it,

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.566 A:middle
all I have to do is click on the

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:36.826 A:middle
file.

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:37.566 A:middle
All right.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:41.346 A:middle
So, I've got two editors, I've

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:42.826 A:middle
got two files, let's add a

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:43.116 A:middle
third.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.626 A:middle
I'm going to split the editor on

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:47.196 A:middle
the left, so I'm going to use

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.386 A:middle
the Add Editor button in the

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:49.036 A:middle
left editor.

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.516 A:middle
And I'm going to hold the option

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.966 A:middle
key down, so that I can split it

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:53.886 A:middle
in the opposite direction.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.636 A:middle
The icon rotates to show me

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:56.326 A:middle
what's going to happen.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:58.506 A:middle
So, I got an editor on the

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.966 A:middle
bottom, and it's active.

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:04.596 A:middle
So, another click and I've

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.356 A:middle
loaded that file.

00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:07.876 A:middle
Sometimes I want to do that the

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:08.726 A:middle
other way around, though,

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:10.076 A:middle
sometimes I want to click on a

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.596 A:middle
file and tell Xcode where to put

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:11.716 A:middle
it.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:13.896 A:middle
For that, I use the Destination

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:14.226 A:middle
Chooser.

00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.006 A:middle
I'll just hold option and shift.

00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:18.016 A:middle
Click on the file that I want,

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.276 A:middle
and the Destination Chooser

00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:19.666 A:middle
appears.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.476 A:middle
Now I can just hit return to

00:05:22.476 --> 00:05:23.606 A:middle
open it in the active editor.

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
Or I can use the arrow keys or

00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:29.366 A:middle
the mouse to insert a new editor

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.506 A:middle
here, to open it in this editor,

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:33.476 A:middle
put an editor there, over here,

00:05:33.476 --> 00:05:34.066 A:middle
whatever I want.

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:35.896 A:middle
I can also use standard keyboard

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:37.156 A:middle
shortcuts to do things like

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:39.576 A:middle
switch tabs, put it somewhere

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.476 A:middle
over here, or switch windows,

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:43.216 A:middle
put it somewhere over here.

00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:45.236 A:middle
There's a lot of flexibility

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:46.186 A:middle
here, a lot of power.

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:47.776 A:middle
So, I'm going to put this one

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:49.666 A:middle
down here under the Globe Scene.

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:50.946 A:middle
Just press return.

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:53.706 A:middle
And I've got a set of files that

00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:55.186 A:middle
I want to work with, a layout

00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:57.056 A:middle
that I like, everything's set,

00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
but what if I want to just focus

00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
but what if I want to just focus

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.436 A:middle
on one of these files for a

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:03.086 A:middle
minute.

00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:05.226 A:middle
That's what the new Focus mode

00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:08.096 A:middle
is for, each editor has a button

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:09.936 A:middle
in the corner next to the close

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.446 A:middle
button and if I click that, I

00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:14.396 A:middle
can zoom in this editor to take

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:15.126 A:middle
over the whole window.

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:17.036 A:middle
So, let me use that to zoom in

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:18.236 A:middle
and talk about what's new in the

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:18.846 A:middle
Source Editor.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.616 A:middle
So, one of my favorite new

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.006 A:middle
features in the Source Editor is

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.786 A:middle
the Minimap that's in the

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:27.716 A:middle
options menu, of course.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.336 A:middle
So, I'll turn on Minimap, and

00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:31.766 A:middle
then let me make it a little bit

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.736 A:middle
bigger, so you can see it.

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:36.356 A:middle
So, the Minimap, of course, is a

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:37.846 A:middle
bird's eye view of your code, it

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:39.186 A:middle
shows you the contours of your

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:40.396 A:middle
code it shows you the syntax

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:40.876 A:middle
coloring.

00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:44.036 A:middle
And it's meant for navigation.

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:45.156 A:middle
So, it tells you where you're

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:46.496 A:middle
going before you get there, as

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:47.376 A:middle
you hover over different

00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:49.356 A:middle
elements, it shows you exactly

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:50.596 A:middle
what it is, so you know where

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:50.966 A:middle
you're going.

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:52.996 A:middle
It also shows you important

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.666 A:middle
landmarks, like, where you have

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:56.106 A:middle
changes in your file or where

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:58.616 A:middle
you have breakpoints, the text

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:00.566 A:middle
you see down here are marks that

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:00.566 A:middle
you see down here are marks that

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
I've inserted into my code to

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:02.676 A:middle
organize it.

00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:04.436 A:middle
And if I click on one of those,

00:07:04.436 --> 00:07:05.516 A:middle
you can see that we render the

00:07:05.516 --> 00:07:06.746 A:middle
marks in the Minimap, and the

00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:07.996 A:middle
Source Editor the same,

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:09.636 A:middle
including the divider lines to

00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:11.456 A:middle
help anchor you as you scroll

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:12.166 A:middle
around.

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:15.046 A:middle
The Minimap also shows transient

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:15.646 A:middle
information.

00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:17.986 A:middle
So, if I do find, for instance,

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.606 A:middle
Minimap shows me all of the

00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:25.096 A:middle
matches in my file and it fades

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:26.326 A:middle
some of the other information,

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:27.606 A:middle
so that that stands out, so you

00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:28.986 A:middle
can see exactly where you are,

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:31.276 A:middle
and the context of your current

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:31.696 A:middle
match.

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:35.486 A:middle
All right.

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:36.376 A:middle
So, that's the Minimap.

00:07:37.076 --> 00:07:38.426 A:middle
Over on the source code side,

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
we've made some improvements,

00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:42.236 A:middle
like new syntax coloring options

00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:45.026 A:middle
like these declarations you see

00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:45.326 A:middle
here.

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:47.776 A:middle
And we've added new themes,

00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:49.566 A:middle
including high contrast themes

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:50.796 A:middle
in light and dark.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:57.366 A:middle
And we've given documentation, a

00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:58.566 A:middle
big boost in readability.

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:00.936 A:middle
We've restyled it, so that it

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:00.936 A:middle
We've restyled it, so that it

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:02.396 A:middle
reads more like documentation

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:04.616 A:middle
and Xcode now understands a lot

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:06.846 A:middle
more of the structure of your

00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.106 A:middle
documentation to help make it

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:08.966 A:middle
easier to maintain.

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:10.516 A:middle
So let me give you an example.

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:12.796 A:middle
I have here a function which is

00:08:12.796 --> 00:08:13.656 A:middle
fully documented.

00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:18.446 A:middle
But, if I add a new parameter to

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:20.106 A:middle
this and I'll make it a double.

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:23.626 A:middle
I'll give it a value and then

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:25.286 A:middle
let me use my parameter down

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:26.856 A:middle
here, so I don't get any issues.

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:30.366 A:middle
Now, I can use the action pop

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:31.976 A:middle
over and Add Documentation to

00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
fill in the gaps in my code.

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:38.126 A:middle
Best of all, it also works with

00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:39.785 A:middle
multiple cursors, so if you have

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:40.966 A:middle
a bunch of gaps to fill it's

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:41.496 A:middle
really easy.

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:42.186 A:middle
All right.

00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:46.606 A:middle
So, I got my documentation.

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:48.656 A:middle
Now, let's say hypothetically,

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:49.986 A:middle
you're on stage in front of a

00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:51.866 A:middle
very large audience, and you've

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.986 A:middle
just made a typo in your code,

00:08:54.086 --> 00:08:55.746 A:middle
and then you've used Code

00:08:55.746 --> 00:08:58.496 A:middle
Completion and Add Documentation

00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.826 A:middle
to spread that typo around.

00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:03.476 A:middle
Well, Edit All In Scope can now

00:09:03.986 --> 00:09:06.136 A:middle
clean up your mistakes very

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:08.046 A:middle
quickly, your signature, your

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:09.596 A:middle
code, and now, even the

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:12.086 A:middle
documentation, can be fixed in

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:12.466 A:middle
one go.

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:17.376 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
All right.

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:19.786 A:middle
One last thing I want to show

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:20.946 A:middle
you in the Source Editor that

00:09:20.946 --> 00:09:23.026 A:middle
I'm really excited about is an

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:24.236 A:middle
enhancement to change bars.

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:26.036 A:middle
So down here at the bottom of my

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:27.386 A:middle
file I have a change that I made

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:27.786 A:middle
earlier.

00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:29.646 A:middle
Change bars have always shown

00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:32.146 A:middle
you that a reminder of the

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:33.536 A:middle
changes you made earlier which

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:35.256 A:middle
lines in your file have changed.

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:36.746 A:middle
If you hover over the change

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:37.966 A:middle
bar, it shows you where on the

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:38.896 A:middle
line those changes are.

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:42.626 A:middle
But now you can click on the

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:43.826 A:middle
change bar and there's a new

00:09:44.106 --> 00:09:45.756 A:middle
Show Change command, which shows

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:46.956 A:middle
an Inline Diff right there in

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
your file.

00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:49.216 A:middle
If you hover over the bar again

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:50.246 A:middle
you can see exactly what it

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.996 A:middle
changed from what it changed to,

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:53.836 A:middle
and it's live, so any updates

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:55.236 A:middle
that you make will be reflected

00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:57.656 A:middle
immediately in the diff.

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:58.806 A:middle
So that's everything I want to

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
show in this first editor, let

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
show in this first editor, let

00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:01.276 A:middle
me pop back out to the big

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:02.706 A:middle
picture again to do that I just

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:03.996 A:middle
click the Focus button again.

00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:06.196 A:middle
And my layout comes back just

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:06.776 A:middle
where I left it.

00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:09.206 A:middle
One last thing before I go, I

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:11.836 A:middle
want to do a quick code review

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:13.486 A:middle
of my changes here.

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:14.716 A:middle
So, I'm going to click the Code

00:10:14.716 --> 00:10:16.066 A:middle
Review button, and that's going

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:17.466 A:middle
to take the active editor and

00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:18.696 A:middle
blow it up to the full window,

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:19.996 A:middle
so that I can concentrate on the

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:21.736 A:middle
task at hand, just like Focus

00:10:21.736 --> 00:10:22.006 A:middle
mode.

00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:24.736 A:middle
When I'm done, I click again, my

00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:25.516 A:middle
layout comes back.

00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:28.966 A:middle
That is a quick whirlwind tour

00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
of some of the many workflow

00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:31.546 A:middle
changes in Xcode 11.

00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:32.826 A:middle
Back to you Ken.

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:38.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:39.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Brendan.

00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:42.136 A:middle
I love that new Minimap, by the

00:10:42.136 --> 00:10:42.286 A:middle
way.

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:44.666 A:middle
And there's so many other great

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.196 A:middle
Source Editor features this year

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:48.686 A:middle
from Spell Checking to Nested

00:10:48.686 --> 00:10:50.356 A:middle
Code Folding to Inline Diff,

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:51.196 A:middle
just to name a few.

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:53.206 A:middle
But one area in particular that

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:54.646 A:middle
we focused on over the last year

00:10:55.136 --> 00:10:56.676 A:middle
is Code Completion and giving

00:10:56.676 --> 00:10:58.046 A:middle
you better results in more

00:10:58.046 --> 00:10:58.666 A:middle
places.

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:01.776 A:middle
There's now Code Completions for

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:04.936 A:middle
Compiler Control statements and

00:11:05.256 --> 00:11:07.336 A:middle
that never Completions work more

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:09.456 A:middle
reliably, and in more places

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.026 A:middle
like here, when you're pending

00:11:11.096 --> 00:11:13.636 A:middle
an enum to an array [applause].

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:14.936 A:middle
All right [applause].

00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:19.576 A:middle
And there's now Code Completions

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:20.996 A:middle
for function overload.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:23.056 A:middle
So these are just a few of the

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.266 A:middle
many Completions we've improved

00:11:25.446 --> 00:11:26.156 A:middle
in Xcode 11.

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:29.126 A:middle
Now, let's look at the Source

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.546 A:middle
Code Editor, and workflow.

00:11:31.126 --> 00:11:35.966 A:middle
Now, this is a huge year for

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:37.266 A:middle
Swift Package Manager.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:39.316 A:middle
It's been thriving since we

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:41.366 A:middle
introduced it with tons of

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:44.046 A:middle
packages available today, all of

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:45.546 A:middle
which let you build on the great

00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:47.536 A:middle
work happening in the community.

00:11:48.536 --> 00:11:49.636 A:middle
The packages are a great way to

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:51.496 A:middle
factor your own code, breaking

00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:52.676 A:middle
it up into smaller, more

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:53.656 A:middle
testable pieces.

00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:56.286 A:middle
Well, this year, we have fully

00:11:56.286 --> 00:11:57.936 A:middle
integrated Swift Package Manager

00:11:58.126 --> 00:11:58.866 A:middle
with Xcode.

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.976 A:middle
You can use packages to build

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.976 A:middle
You can use packages to build

from Source Control integration,

everything that you do with

packages, it works just like

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:24.786 A:middle
you're used to, with projects.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:26.936 A:middle
And Xcode makes it easy to

00:12:26.936 --> 00:12:29.076 A:middle
discover and use packages, and

00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:31.056 A:middle

I will be working on our travel

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:07.636 A:middle

have any weather information

which is a pretty important part

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:12.046 A:middle
about any trip.

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:14.216 A:middle
I don't want to have to reinvent

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:14.916 A:middle
the wheel to get this

00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:16.606 A:middle
information in my app.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.706 A:middle
Lucky for me, my coworker Rhonda

00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:19.736 A:middle
told me about a package that I

00:13:19.736 --> 00:13:20.926 A:middle
could use to do just this.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.546 A:middle
So, let's add it to our project.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.276 A:middle
I'll start by navigating to the

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:26.916 A:middle
Project Editor.

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:28.966 A:middle
And I'll navigate to the project

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:31.006 A:middle
where I'll see a new Swift

00:13:31.006 --> 00:13:31.666 A:middle
Packages tab.

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:34.176 A:middle
This tab will show me any

00:13:34.176 --> 00:13:35.276 A:middle
packages that my project

00:13:35.276 --> 00:13:36.006 A:middle
currently depends on.

00:13:37.226 --> 00:13:38.856 A:middle
To add the first, I'll click the

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:39.396 A:middle
plus button.

00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:40.986 A:middle
And because I've already logged

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.486 A:middle
in with my GitHub account, I can

00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:43.836 A:middle
see all of my personal packages,

00:13:43.986 --> 00:13:45.456 A:middle
organizational packages, as well

00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:46.606 A:middle
as my starred repos right at the

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:49.376 A:middle
top Here's that forecast package

00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:50.006 A:middle
I was talking about.

00:13:51.116 --> 00:13:52.936 A:middle
So, if I click next, Xcode will

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:54.436 A:middle
prompt me for my version

00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:56.196 A:middle
information here, and Xcode will

00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:57.616 A:middle
automatically fill in the most

00:13:57.616 --> 00:13:59.616 A:middle
recent up-to-date version for me

00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:00.106 A:middle
to start using.

00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:00.106 A:middle
to start using.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.416 A:middle
And that's what I want because I

00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:02.386 A:middle
want the most up-to-date code,

00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:02.816 A:middle
right away.

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:06.036 A:middle
When I click next, Xcode will

00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:07.246 A:middle
resolve any dependencies that my

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:08.826 A:middle
package may have, but because

00:14:08.826 --> 00:14:10.066 A:middle
it's this pretty simple package,

00:14:10.096 --> 00:14:10.806 A:middle
it doesn't have any

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:11.796 A:middle
dependencies, it will resolve

00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:12.146 A:middle
right away.

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:16.236 A:middle
Finally, I need to choose which

00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:17.586 A:middle
target to link my package

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:18.776 A:middle
product against, and I'll choose

00:14:18.776 --> 00:14:20.396 A:middle
my app target here, and I'll

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:21.526 A:middle
finish up.

00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:23.186 A:middle
So, that was it.

00:14:23.336 --> 00:14:24.356 A:middle
All I had to do to set up my

00:14:24.356 --> 00:14:26.126 A:middle
package in my project was to add

00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:27.376 A:middle
it to this dependency section.

[ Applause ]

00:14:34.286 --> 00:14:35.066 A:middle
And over in the project

00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:36.276 A:middle
navigator, I now have a Swift

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:37.426 A:middle
Package dependency section,

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:38.776 A:middle
where I can browse all of the

00:14:38.776 --> 00:14:40.206 A:middle
source of this package, just

00:14:40.206 --> 00:14:41.256 A:middle
like it were part of my project,

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:41.926 A:middle
because it is.

00:14:43.886 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
Great. So, I have a pretty good

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:45.836 A:middle
idea of where I need to

00:14:45.836 --> 00:14:46.966 A:middle
implement this functionality.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:48.066 A:middle
I'm going to put it right in my

00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:49.526 A:middle
Weather Fetcher Swift file here,

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:50.346 A:middle
which currently doesn't do a

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:50.766 A:middle
whole lot.

00:14:51.836 --> 00:14:53.826 A:middle
Now that I've configured it, I

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.776 A:middle
can quickly import the forecast

00:14:55.816 --> 00:14:56.316 A:middle
module.

00:14:56.886 --> 00:15:00.186 A:middle
And I'll start by creating a

00:14:56.886 --> 00:15:00.186 A:middle
And I'll start by creating a

00:15:00.186 --> 00:15:04.916 A:middle
Forecast Object using the region

00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:06.456 A:middle
that was passed in.

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:08.896 A:middle
But I just grabbed this package

00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:09.916 A:middle
on GitHub and I'm not very

00:15:09.916 --> 00:15:10.706 A:middle
familiar with the API.

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:12.486 A:middle
I could go look at it on the

00:15:12.486 --> 00:15:13.956 A:middle
web, but because of the

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:15.246 A:middle
first-class citizen right here

00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:17.176 A:middle
in Xcode, I can quickly jump to

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.506 A:middle
its definition and start

00:15:18.506 --> 00:15:19.876 A:middle
browsing its source right away.

00:15:21.426 --> 00:15:22.466 A:middle
So, I'll scroll down a little

00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:22.726 A:middle
bit.

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.616 A:middle
And this observations method

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:25.596 A:middle
looks like what I want to use.

00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:27.346 A:middle
But I'm not familiar with this

00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:29.136 A:middle
observations structure this

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
type.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.306 A:middle
So I want to I want to jump in

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.506 A:middle
and find out more about it as

00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:32.736 A:middle
well.

00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:35.046 A:middle
And to show off some of our new

00:15:35.146 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
search functionality in Xcode

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:38.486 A:middle
11, I'll use the find navigator

00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:40.306 A:middle
by using command shift F.

00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:42.956 A:middle
And I'll navigate down to the

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.166 A:middle
Forecast Package here to narrow

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:45.536 A:middle
my search just into that

00:15:45.536 --> 00:15:46.396 A:middle
Forecast Package.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.356 A:middle
I'll search for observation, and

00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:50.976 A:middle
I'll only get results for that

00:15:50.976 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
package.

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:53.196 A:middle
And it looks like it's defined

00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:53.736 A:middle
right here.

00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:57.316 A:middle
OK. So this enum looks like it

00:15:57.316 --> 00:15:58.616 A:middle
has different options for me,

00:15:58.616 --> 00:15:59.486 A:middle
like the metrics that will come

00:15:59.486 --> 00:16:01.426 A:middle
back from this API, like the

00:15:59.486 --> 00:16:01.426 A:middle
back from this API, like the

00:16:01.426 --> 00:16:02.496 A:middle
high temp, the low temp, the

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:03.466 A:middle
precipitation, and so on.

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:05.016 A:middle
I only want the high and low

00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:06.566 A:middle
temp for my method, so I'll go

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:07.156 A:middle
and use those.

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:09.216 A:middle
And I'll use command shift J, to

00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:10.096 A:middle
jump back to the project

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:11.876 A:middle
navigator, and navigate back to

00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:13.156 A:middle
the Weather Fetcher here, and

00:16:13.156 --> 00:16:13.876 A:middle
I'll start implementing this

00:16:13.876 --> 00:16:14.136 A:middle
method.

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:17.106 A:middle
So, I'll use my Forecast Object.

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:19.066 A:middle
I'll pass in the date that was

00:16:19.096 --> 00:16:19.976 A:middle
passing to this method.

00:16:20.926 --> 00:16:22.276 A:middle
And like I said before I want

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:25.586 A:middle
the high temp and the low temp.

00:16:26.656 --> 00:16:27.856 A:middle
And I'll fill in my Completion

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:29.966 A:middle
Handler really quick, grabbing

00:16:29.966 --> 00:16:31.396 A:middle
the high and low temp out of the

00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:33.416 A:middle
results, and then calling the

00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:35.556 A:middle
completion with high and low.

00:16:35.556 --> 00:16:38.116 A:middle
I'll fill in the condition

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:39.286 A:middle
method in a very similar way,

00:16:39.506 --> 00:16:41.206 A:middle
only grabbing the condition back

00:16:41.206 --> 00:16:43.286 A:middle
from the results.

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:44.996 A:middle
Awesome. So, now when I build,

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:46.846 A:middle
and run, and review the results

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:47.746 A:middle
in the simulator, I should be

00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:49.436 A:middle
able to navigate the Plan tab

00:16:50.306 --> 00:16:51.466 A:middle
and see some weather information

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:53.356 A:middle
in my San Francisco trip.

00:16:53.626 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
And it looks like I got the high

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.176 A:middle
and the low and the expected

00:16:56.176 --> 00:16:56.796 A:middle
conditions.

00:16:57.336 --> 00:16:58.106 A:middle
And it looks like it's going to

00:16:58.106 --> 00:16:58.926 A:middle
rain right towards the end of my

00:16:58.926 --> 00:17:00.116 A:middle
trip, so I should probably bring

00:16:58.926 --> 00:17:00.116 A:middle
trip, so I should probably bring

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
a jacket.

00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:04.066 A:middle

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.006 A:middle
current set of working changes.

00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:46.996 A:middle
When you want to review those

00:17:46.996 --> 00:17:48.386 A:middle
changes and pop the stash you

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:49.436 A:middle
can do that from the Source

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:50.676 A:middle
Control navigator.

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:53.206 A:middle
We're also integrating

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.316 A:middle
Cherry-Pick from the Source

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.326 A:middle
Control history view here, or

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.256 A:middle
just bring up the context menu

00:17:58.256 --> 00:17:59.476 A:middle
on a comment and choose

00:17:59.476 --> 00:17:59.816 A:middle
Cherry-Pick.

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:01.186 A:middle
So, it makes it really easy to

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:01.186 A:middle
So, it makes it really easy to

00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:03.176 A:middle
move changes between branches.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.236 A:middle
And like I mentioned earlier,

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:07.096 A:middle
you can now get the Source

00:18:07.096 --> 00:18:09.116 A:middle
Control history for any file,

00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:11.626 A:middle
anytime, with the new History

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.656 A:middle
Inspector, which by the way

00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:15.226 A:middle
works great for non-tech files

00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:15.426 A:middle
too.

00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:23.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.666 A:middle
Yesterday you saw the

00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.336 A:middle
introduction of a number of new

00:18:27.726 --> 00:18:29.496 A:middle
OS features, and you can begin

00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:30.636 A:middle
adopting those today.

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.046 A:middle
Once you bring your iPad app to

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:34.416 A:middle
the Mac.

00:18:35.276 --> 00:18:36.406 A:middle
You can start customizing it

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:38.526 A:middle
using the new Mac device here in

00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:40.196 A:middle
the Storyboards Devices bar,

00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:43.196 A:middle
makes it quick and easy to make

00:18:43.196 --> 00:18:44.596 A:middle
your app feel right at home on

00:18:44.596 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
the Mac, and for the new iOS

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:49.176 A:middle
dark appearance.

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:50.746 A:middle
This system does a lot of the

00:18:50.746 --> 00:18:51.696 A:middle
work for you.

00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:53.886 A:middle
Again, using the devices bar you

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:55.526 A:middle
can quickly switch between light

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:57.626 A:middle
and dark and make sure that your

00:18:57.626 --> 00:18:58.916 A:middle
app looks great.

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:02.166 A:middle
Now, all of the new SF symbols

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:02.166 A:middle
Now, all of the new SF symbols

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:03.636 A:middle
are fully integrated.

00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:05.436 A:middle
The options you need are right

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.886 A:middle
here in the inspector, things

00:19:06.886 --> 00:19:08.456 A:middle
like having the symbol size,

00:19:08.686 --> 00:19:10.126 A:middle
track the system font size.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.336 A:middle
And then when you want to browse

00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:14.156 A:middle
all the symbols, you can do that

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:16.376 A:middle
in the redesigned library, and

00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:17.416 A:middle
then drag them right out into

00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:18.006 A:middle
your Storyboard.

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:21.536 A:middle
Now, for your own resources,

00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:24.056 A:middle
things like colors, and images,

00:19:24.536 --> 00:19:26.176 A:middle
Asset Catalogs, they play a

00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:27.626 A:middle
really important role.

00:19:28.086 --> 00:19:29.786 A:middle
They let you vary for things

00:19:29.786 --> 00:19:31.586 A:middle
like device type and for light

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:32.216 A:middle
and dark.

00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:35.256 A:middle
The best part is, you don't have

00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:38.356 A:middle
to write any code to do that.

00:19:38.686 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
In Xcode 11, in iOS 13, you can

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:43.576 A:middle
create your own custom symbols.

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.946 A:middle
They get all the great

00:19:44.946 --> 00:19:46.706 A:middle
characteristics of the new SF

00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:47.456 A:middle
Symbols.

00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:49.796 A:middle
So, symbols, they let you

00:19:49.796 --> 00:19:51.416 A:middle
specify various sizes and

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.666 A:middle
weights of artwork.

00:19:53.296 --> 00:19:55.226 A:middle
And then at runtime, the system,

00:19:55.396 --> 00:19:57.016 A:middle
it'll choose the right variant,

00:19:57.256 --> 00:19:58.676 A:middle
based on things like the users'

00:19:58.676 --> 00:20:00.556 A:middle
font size, accessibility

00:19:58.676 --> 00:20:00.556 A:middle
font size, accessibility

00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:02.756 A:middle
settings, even where the art is

00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:04.356 A:middle
used within the user interface.

00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:06.386 A:middle
So this is a really powerful new

00:20:06.386 --> 00:20:08.236 A:middle
way to create dynamic artwork.

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:11.856 A:middle
And in Xcode 11, you can

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:13.866 A:middle
localize assets now too.

00:20:14.606 --> 00:20:16.256 A:middle
You just select an asset, click

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:17.356 A:middle
the Localized button and the

00:20:17.356 --> 00:20:19.256 A:middle
Attributes Inspector, and choose

00:20:19.256 --> 00:20:20.706 A:middle
the localizations that you want

00:20:20.706 --> 00:20:21.396 A:middle
to customize.

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:25.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:26.616 A:middle
Very important stuff.

00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:30.136 A:middle
And here to show you the updated

00:20:30.136 --> 00:20:32.346 A:middle
Design tools is Lisa.

00:20:33.416 --> 00:20:33.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ken.

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:36.696 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:39.086 A:middle
Today, I'm excited to show you

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:41.366 A:middle
how to adopt the new iOS 13

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.656 A:middle
features, Dark mode, and SF

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:44.256 A:middle
Symbols.

00:20:45.126 --> 00:20:47.086 A:middle
Let's work on the login view of

00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:48.746 A:middle
our travel app.

00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:53.796 A:middle
The two images here, email and

00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:55.966 A:middle
password are now using custom

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:56.426 A:middle
images.

00:20:56.906 --> 00:20:58.676 A:middle
I would like to change to use

00:20:58.676 --> 00:21:00.566 A:middle
the SF Symbols, so that they

00:20:58.676 --> 00:21:00.566 A:middle
the SF Symbols, so that they

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:02.406 A:middle
look great and they can work

00:21:02.406 --> 00:21:04.366 A:middle
with dynamic type.

00:21:05.176 --> 00:21:06.996 A:middle
When I browse the library

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.556 A:middle
earlier, there are two images

00:21:08.596 --> 00:21:09.616 A:middle
that look nice to me.

00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:11.686 A:middle
One is called envelope the other

00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:12.286 A:middle
is lock.

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:15.006 A:middle
So let's change to use them.

00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:17.516 A:middle
First, I'm going to click the

00:21:17.516 --> 00:21:19.956 A:middle
email icon, and open the

00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:20.696 A:middle
inspector.

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:24.966 A:middle
In Xcode 11, in the email, in

00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:27.666 A:middle
the -- our image icons here that

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:30.606 A:middle
I cannot only view, the image

00:21:30.606 --> 00:21:33.796 A:middle
names, but also I can see their

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:35.496 A:middle
appearances before I choose to

00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:37.476 A:middle
use them.

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:38.486 A:middle
So I'm [applause].

00:21:39.276 --> 00:21:40.116 A:middle
Yeah, like that too.

00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:42.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to type envelope.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.246 A:middle
Now it will show me a list of

00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:46.446 A:middle
envelope with different

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:47.116 A:middle
appearances.

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:49.216 A:middle
I'm going to select

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:51.716 A:middle
envelope.fill, which looks good.

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:54.476 A:middle
And for the symbol

00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:56.406 A:middle
configurations, I would like to

00:21:56.526 --> 00:21:58.536 A:middle
set as font, so that they can

00:21:58.536 --> 00:21:59.816 A:middle
work with dynamic type.

00:22:00.456 --> 00:22:03.096 A:middle
I can also change the font size.

00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:05.176 A:middle
Let's change to a bigger one.

00:22:05.446 --> 00:22:06.046 A:middle
Title One.

00:22:06.636 --> 00:22:10.376 A:middle
Next, I would like to do the

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:11.986 A:middle
same for the password icon.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:15.656 A:middle
I'm going to type in lock and

00:22:15.656 --> 00:22:17.586 A:middle
choose lock.fill which matches

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:18.426 A:middle
the style here.

00:22:19.576 --> 00:22:21.046 A:middle
Again, I'll set the

00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:22.566 A:middle
configuration as font.

00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:26.086 A:middle
Next, I would like to take a

00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:27.766 A:middle
look how my view looks in the

00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:28.416 A:middle
Dark mode.

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:31.836 A:middle
From the devices bar there's a

00:22:31.836 --> 00:22:33.986 A:middle
switch I can change from light

00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:35.946 A:middle
to dark, let's do it.

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:38.926 A:middle
Now you can see the view has

00:22:38.966 --> 00:22:39.666 A:middle
been updated.

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.856 A:middle
However, this image doesn't look

00:22:42.856 --> 00:22:43.076 A:middle
right.

00:22:43.856 --> 00:22:45.396 A:middle
The handle of my suitcase

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:46.086 A:middle
disappears.

00:22:46.776 --> 00:22:48.056 A:middle
Let's figure out what happened.

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:51.146 A:middle
I'm switching back.

00:22:51.146 --> 00:22:52.336 A:middle
Oh, I see.

00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:53.736 A:middle
The handle is black.

00:22:54.266 --> 00:22:55.696 A:middle
So, it doesn't show very well

00:22:55.696 --> 00:22:57.026 A:middle
against the dark background.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:22:59.986 A:middle
To fix that, I would like to

00:23:00.016 --> 00:23:01.776 A:middle
provide a new variant for this

00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:03.406 A:middle
image for the Dark mode.

00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:05.926 A:middle
Luckily, I have a great designer

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:06.376 A:middle
named At.

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.986 A:middle
He has already created one image

00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:10.736 A:middle
for me to use in dark.

00:23:11.286 --> 00:23:12.406 A:middle
Let's change to use it.

00:23:12.406 --> 00:23:15.166 A:middle
I'm going to select the image.

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:18.036 A:middle
And I can click this arrow.

00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:20.886 A:middle
It will open this image into

00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:21.696 A:middle
dark appearance.

00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:24.426 A:middle
First, let's enable the dark

00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:25.016 A:middle
appearance.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.806 A:middle
And then I can drag in the

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:32.486 A:middle
image, created by At.

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:34.356 A:middle
Let's change by, up to the

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:35.006 A:middle
Storyboard.

00:23:36.346 --> 00:23:38.496 A:middle
Now, you can see in Light mode,

00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:39.946 A:middle
it is still using the original

00:23:40.016 --> 00:23:42.306 A:middle
image as expected, but when I

00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:43.186 A:middle
changed to Dark.

00:23:43.826 --> 00:23:45.516 A:middle
Now the new image has been

00:23:45.516 --> 00:23:46.816 A:middle
using, it's look good.

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:52.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.996 A:middle
But At is a perfectionist, he

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:56.276 A:middle
thought these two blue buttons,

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:57.716 A:middle
although they look good in Light

00:23:57.716 --> 00:23:59.626 A:middle
that he feel it doesn't pop as

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:01.536 A:middle
much as he wants in Dark.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:01.536 A:middle
much as he wants in Dark.

00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:04.026 A:middle
So, instead, he wanted me to

00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.446 A:middle
change to use a different color

00:24:05.476 --> 00:24:06.026 A:middle
orange.

00:24:06.906 --> 00:24:08.166 A:middle
Let's figure out how to do that.

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:10.566 A:middle
I'm going to select the button.

00:24:11.476 --> 00:24:13.816 A:middle
And now, I can see the tint

00:24:13.816 --> 00:24:15.396 A:middle
color is set to use a custom

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:16.726 A:middle
color called Button color.

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.026 A:middle
So to use a light in the Light

00:24:20.026 --> 00:24:21.896 A:middle
mode, I would like continue to

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:24.106 A:middle
using the blue button, but

00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:25.826 A:middle
actually in the Dark mode, I

00:24:25.826 --> 00:24:27.626 A:middle
would like to change to use the

00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:30.306 A:middle
orange color, just as easy as

00:24:30.306 --> 00:24:32.456 A:middle
what I done for the image.

00:24:32.456 --> 00:24:34.436 A:middle
I'm going to open in the

00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:36.526 A:middle
inspector and enable the dark

00:24:36.526 --> 00:24:37.036 A:middle
appearance.

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:39.366 A:middle
And for the dark appearance, I'm

00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:41.556 A:middle
going to use orange color.

00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:44.186 A:middle
Let's switch back.

00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:47.866 A:middle
Cool. I do find these two-orange

00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:49.836 A:middle
button pop more and look better

00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:50.116 A:middle
now.

00:24:50.636 --> 00:24:52.996 A:middle
Next, I would like to take a

00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:54.706 A:middle
look how my view looks at

00:24:54.706 --> 00:24:55.016 A:middle
runtime.

00:24:55.016 --> 00:24:57.536 A:middle
So, I'm going to build and run

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:58.566 A:middle
in a simulator.

00:25:04.416 --> 00:25:07.046 A:middle
In Xcode 11, there's a new

00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.926 A:middle
feature called Environment

00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:09.646 A:middle
Overrides.

00:25:10.686 --> 00:25:12.976 A:middle
It is located in the Debug bar.

00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:16.286 A:middle
When I click it, it will show me

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.286 A:middle
a pop over that I can change

00:25:18.366 --> 00:25:19.846 A:middle
different settings, such as

00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:21.316 A:middle
system settings and

00:25:21.316 --> 00:25:22.486 A:middle
accessibility settings.

00:25:23.476 --> 00:25:26.256 A:middle
So, I can change the interface

00:25:26.256 --> 00:25:29.526 A:middle
style from light to dark to see

00:25:29.776 --> 00:25:31.376 A:middle
how my view got updated.

00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:33.706 A:middle
I can set different

00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:36.766 A:middle
accessibility settings, for

00:25:36.766 --> 00:25:39.846 A:middle
example, the bold text.

00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:43.776 A:middle
From this overrides, it allows

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:46.386 A:middle
me to test out my app at runtime

00:25:46.506 --> 00:25:47.736 A:middle
with these different settings,

00:25:48.086 --> 00:25:49.706 A:middle
without actually changing the

00:25:49.706 --> 00:25:51.506 A:middle
settings on my simulator or

00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:52.066 A:middle
devices.

00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:53.546 A:middle
I can --

00:25:54.516 --> 00:25:57.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:58.376 --> 00:26:01.526 A:middle
I can also change the dynamic

00:25:58.376 --> 00:26:01.526 A:middle
I can also change the dynamic

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:03.646 A:middle
type size by dragging the slider

00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:05.886 A:middle
here and you can see how the

00:26:05.886 --> 00:26:06.976 A:middle
view has been updated.

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:11.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:12.476 --> 00:26:14.696 A:middle
Remember earlier when I said the

00:26:14.696 --> 00:26:16.436 A:middle
SF Symbols for these two images

00:26:16.936 --> 00:26:18.436 A:middle
that I used font for their

00:26:18.436 --> 00:26:19.296 A:middle
configuration.

00:26:19.876 --> 00:26:22.186 A:middle
So, now, when I'm dragging to

00:26:22.236 --> 00:26:24.436 A:middle
set different dynamic type, they

00:26:24.436 --> 00:26:28.386 A:middle
react to it, just like text.

00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:30.836 A:middle
With very simple edits, I think

00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:33.546 A:middle
my view looks great in iOS 13.

00:26:33.546 --> 00:26:35.396 A:middle
I hope this can make your app

00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:36.406 A:middle
look great as well.

00:26:36.876 --> 00:26:37.186 A:middle
Thank you.

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:38.576 A:middle
Give it back to Ken [applause].

00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:40.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Lisa.

00:26:41.856 --> 00:26:43.666 A:middle
These new dark iOS apps look

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:44.396 A:middle
fantastic.

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.136 A:middle
And some of the scenarios that

00:26:46.136 --> 00:26:47.486 A:middle
your users run into on their

00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:50.406 A:middle
devices, things like networking

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:51.666 A:middle
or thermal conditions.

00:26:52.336 --> 00:26:53.616 A:middle
Those are really hard to

00:26:53.616 --> 00:26:54.396 A:middle
reproduce.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.606 A:middle
And that makes them really hard

00:26:56.646 --> 00:26:59.226 A:middle
to debug, well, in Xcode 11 you

00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:00.826 A:middle
can change the way your device

00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:00.826 A:middle
can change the way your device

00:27:00.926 --> 00:27:02.996 A:middle
behaves, varying things like the

00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:05.676 A:middle
network throughput, or changing

00:27:05.676 --> 00:27:07.156 A:middle
the device's thermal state.

00:27:07.276 --> 00:27:10.226 A:middle
In the devices window there's a

00:27:10.226 --> 00:27:12.006 A:middle
new Device Condition section

00:27:12.516 --> 00:27:13.466 A:middle
where you can turn on the

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.576 A:middle
Network Link Conditioner and

00:27:15.576 --> 00:27:17.166 A:middle
simulate real world networking

00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:19.736 A:middle
scenarios, or you can turn on

00:27:19.736 --> 00:27:20.806 A:middle
the Thermal State Conditioner.

00:27:21.616 --> 00:27:22.696 A:middle
Change your device's thermal

00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:24.246 A:middle
state, so that it behaves like

00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:26.076 A:middle
it's warmer than it actually is.

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:28.096 A:middle
And once you turn on one of

00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:29.776 A:middle
these conditions, you'll see an

00:27:29.776 --> 00:27:32.036 A:middle
indicator on your device, and

00:27:32.036 --> 00:27:33.736 A:middle
you can tap that indicator to

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.196 A:middle
see exactly which condition is

00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:35.556 A:middle
running.

00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:38.236 A:middle
And you can stop it here, or

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:40.036 A:middle
when you disconnect from Xcode,

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:41.596 A:middle
it'll automatically be stopped

00:27:42.016 --> 00:27:42.376 A:middle
for you.

00:27:43.126 --> 00:27:44.426 A:middle
This is a great way to make sure

00:27:44.426 --> 00:27:46.186 A:middle
that your apps perform really

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.936 A:middle
well in all conditions.

00:27:51.066 --> 00:27:53.186 A:middle
Xcode 11 continues to improve

00:27:53.226 --> 00:27:55.096 A:middle
testing this year with the

00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:56.696 A:middle
introduction of test plans.

00:27:57.736 --> 00:27:59.766 A:middle
Now test plans let you define a

00:27:59.766 --> 00:28:01.466 A:middle
set of tests that you can share

00:27:59.766 --> 00:28:01.466 A:middle
set of tests that you can share

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:02.226 A:middle
across schemes.

00:28:03.006 --> 00:28:04.396 A:middle
A test plan can have any number

00:28:04.396 --> 00:28:06.336 A:middle
of configurations that let you

00:28:06.336 --> 00:28:08.156 A:middle
say what arguments do you want

00:28:08.156 --> 00:28:10.236 A:middle
to pass or what environment

00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:11.456 A:middle
variables do you want to say,

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.196 A:middle
even what sanitizers do you want

00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:13.616 A:middle
to turn on?

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:16.486 A:middle
When you run that test plan, it

00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:18.236 A:middle
runs all the tests in all the

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:19.496 A:middle
different configurations.

00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:21.836 A:middle
So, for example, you can have a

00:28:21.836 --> 00:28:22.546 A:middle
test plan that has

00:28:22.546 --> 00:28:24.516 A:middle
configurations for each language

00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:25.736 A:middle
your app supports.

00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:28.106 A:middle
When you run that test plan, it

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:29.866 A:middle
runs all the tests in all the

00:28:29.866 --> 00:28:31.696 A:middle
different languages, all with

00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:33.486 A:middle
just a single action.

00:28:34.036 --> 00:28:35.926 A:middle
And, of course, test plans, they

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.186 A:middle
work great with the Xcode's

00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:38.766 A:middle
server where you can run your

00:28:38.766 --> 00:28:40.806 A:middle
tests on multiple devices and

00:28:40.856 --> 00:28:43.486 A:middle
simulators, all in parallel, and

00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:45.516 A:middle
now in more configurations than

00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:45.776 A:middle
ever.

00:28:46.356 --> 00:28:48.466 A:middle
And it goes without saying,

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:50.696 A:middle
testing, it works great for iPad

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:52.676 A:middle
apps on the Mac, as well as

00:28:52.736 --> 00:28:54.446 A:middle
those built with SwiftUI.

00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:59.046 A:middle
And that's testing.

00:29:00.036 --> 00:29:01.896 A:middle
There are some awesome

00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:03.956 A:middle
improvements to the simulator

00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:04.666 A:middle
this year.

00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:07.266 A:middle
There were the new standalone

00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:09.446 A:middle
watch apps you can deploy

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.716 A:middle
directly to the watch simulator.

00:29:12.306 --> 00:29:13.976 A:middle
No iPhone simulator needed.

[ Applause ]

00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:21.466 A:middle
But the big news this year is

00:29:21.466 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
that the simulator is built on

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:24.856 A:middle
top of Metal

00:29:27.146 --> 00:29:27.276 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:29:30.306 --> 00:29:31.636 A:middle
So that means that apps built

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:33.696 A:middle
using Metal can now run in the

00:29:33.696 --> 00:29:35.916 A:middle
simulator, and they get amazing

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:37.806 A:middle
graphics performance, and

00:29:37.806 --> 00:29:39.276 A:middle
everything that's built on top

00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:41.556 A:middle
of Metal, like UIKit, well, that

00:29:41.556 --> 00:29:42.746 A:middle
gets a whole lot faster too.

00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:46.996 A:middle
You'll see a beautiful 60 frames

00:29:47.066 --> 00:29:47.656 A:middle
per second.

00:29:47.716 --> 00:29:50.796 A:middle
And CPU use, it is reduced by up

00:29:50.886 --> 00:29:53.366 A:middle
to 90% which is really great for

00:29:53.366 --> 00:29:55.486 A:middle
battery life [applause].

00:29:55.486 --> 00:29:55.646 A:middle

Simulator Warm Boots are now up

00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:06.816 A:middle
to twice as fast too.

[ Applause ]

00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:12.276 A:middle
So, big improvements to the

00:30:12.276 --> 00:30:12.776 A:middle
simulator.

00:30:15.286 --> 00:30:16.866 A:middle
Last year we introduced, OS

00:30:16.866 --> 00:30:18.296 A:middle
Signposts and Custom

00:30:18.296 --> 00:30:19.936 A:middle
Instruments, so that you can

00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:21.816 A:middle
surface your own data up through

00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:22.526 A:middle
the tools.

00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.206 A:middle
Well, this year, we're bringing

00:30:25.206 --> 00:30:27.276 A:middle
hierarchy to the tracks, to make

00:30:27.276 --> 00:30:29.166 A:middle
it easier for you to explore and

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.396 A:middle
correlate data.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:33.076 A:middle
But when you use OS Signposts

00:30:33.486 --> 00:30:35.756 A:middle
each category that you log, will

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:37.426 A:middle
now get its own track, like

00:30:37.456 --> 00:30:37.556 A:middle
this.

00:30:39.136 --> 00:30:41.466 A:middle
Then you can pin that track and

00:30:41.566 --> 00:30:43.026 A:middle
easily correlate it to another

00:30:43.026 --> 00:30:44.716 A:middle
track, like CPU use.

00:30:46.236 --> 00:30:47.406 A:middle
We're also introducing a new

00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:49.956 A:middle
template for SwiftUI to give you

00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:51.386 A:middle
insight into how much time

00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:52.656 A:middle
you're spending building your

00:30:52.656 --> 00:30:54.736 A:middle
user interfaces in the new body

00:30:54.736 --> 00:30:55.306 A:middle
methods.

00:30:56.556 --> 00:30:58.506 A:middle
And we've completely rewritten

00:30:58.506 --> 00:30:59.996 A:middle
the Metal System Trace Template

00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:01.356 A:middle
from the ground up.

00:31:02.666 --> 00:31:03.666 A:middle
It takes advantage of the new

00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:05.406 A:middle
hierarchical tracks and it's

00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:08.656 A:middle
significantly faster, up to 10

00:31:08.926 --> 00:31:09.996 A:middle
times faster.

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:16.216 A:middle
Now, we can't finish up here

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
today without talking about

00:31:18.226 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
SwiftUI, which really is an

00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:23.116 A:middle
amazing new way to build user

00:31:23.116 --> 00:31:23.946 A:middle
interfaces.

00:31:25.296 --> 00:31:27.376 A:middle
SwiftUI makes it seamless to

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:30.616 A:middle
move from editing to running to

00:31:30.616 --> 00:31:31.296 A:middle
debugging.

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:34.806 A:middle
The new previews which show you

00:31:34.806 --> 00:31:36.496 A:middle
your real UI, they make these

00:31:36.556 --> 00:31:39.466 A:middle
three things, just a single

00:31:39.466 --> 00:31:40.126 A:middle
activity.

00:31:41.396 --> 00:31:44.356 A:middle
Editing, when we see this is the

00:31:44.356 --> 00:31:45.646 A:middle
future of UI development.

00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:49.936 A:middle
So, from the new Preview mode to

00:31:49.936 --> 00:31:51.406 A:middle
the inline editors, we've

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:53.956 A:middle
rethought how to build UI code.

00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:55.886 A:middle
And we've done that with an eye

00:31:55.886 --> 00:31:57.586 A:middle
towards efficiency and direct

00:31:57.586 --> 00:31:59.716 A:middle
manipulation, so that you can

00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:01.866 A:middle
write more code without ever

00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:01.866 A:middle
write more code without ever

00:32:01.866 --> 00:32:02.926 A:middle
typing a character.

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:05.486 A:middle
And there's a brand-new

00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:07.306 A:middle
documentation experience to go

00:32:07.306 --> 00:32:07.686 A:middle
with it.

00:32:07.896 --> 00:32:09.156 A:middle
And that's going to get you up

00:32:09.156 --> 00:32:11.026 A:middle
and writing code quickly.

00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:13.366 A:middle
There are great new tutorials,

00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:16.346 A:middle
all which guide and teach you,

00:32:16.346 --> 00:32:18.386 A:middle
while helping you write code.

00:32:19.046 --> 00:32:21.926 A:middle
Now, you don't need to create a

00:32:21.926 --> 00:32:23.306 A:middle
new project to get started with

00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:24.996 A:middle
previews, you can use them right

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:27.636 A:middle
in your existing apps, just

00:32:27.636 --> 00:32:28.196 A:middle
implement the new

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:31.026 A:middle
UIViewRepresentable protocol and

00:32:31.026 --> 00:32:32.396 A:middle
hand back one of your own views.

00:32:32.396 --> 00:32:33.836 A:middle
It's really that easy.

00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:36.576 A:middle
So, whether you have an iOS,

00:32:36.576 --> 00:32:40.016 A:middle
macOS, watchOS, or tvOS app, you

00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:41.896 A:middle
can get started today.

00:32:41.896 --> 00:32:45.406 A:middle
Well, that is a look at Xcode

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:45.906 A:middle
11.

00:32:46.366 --> 00:32:47.306 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:48.786 A:middle
Have a great conference.

00:32:49.516 --> 00:32:56.500 A:middle
