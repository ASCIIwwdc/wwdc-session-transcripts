[ Music ]

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:16.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My name is Jordyn Castor and

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.056 A:middle
I work here at Apple on the

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:23.146 A:middle
Accessibility Design and Quality

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:23.636 A:middle
Team.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:29.456 A:middle
I'm so excited to be here today.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:32.735 A:middle
Accessibility is built into our

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:34.496 A:middle
hardware and software design

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:35.446 A:middle
here at Apple.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.356 A:middle
We believe accessibility is a

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.606 A:middle
human right and it's one of our

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:42.476 A:middle
core values.

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.206 A:middle
When I download an app, there's

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.566 A:middle
an expectation that it just

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:49.356 A:middle
works.

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.866 A:middle
And I'm able to access all of

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.266 A:middle
the buttons, controls, and

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.206 A:middle
information using VoiceOver.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.386 A:middle
To be honest, I give an app a

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.166 A:middle
first 30 second glance and if I

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.166 A:middle
first 30 second glance and if I

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.776 A:middle
can't access any of the

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.236 A:middle
functionality, I delete it.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:08.896 A:middle
Now, I really, really want to

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:09.956 A:middle
use your applications.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.766 A:middle
I do. But, one of the most

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.916 A:middle
crucial aspects to our built-in

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:17.346 A:middle
features like VoiceOver, Speak

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:20.496 A:middle
Screen, and Voice Control being

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:22.156 A:middle
able to access the functionality

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:24.406 A:middle
of your app is by the labeling

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:26.186 A:middle
of your buttons, and text

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.496 A:middle
fields, controls, and other

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:29.026 A:middle
elements.

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:33.866 A:middle
So today, I'm going to talk to

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.956 A:middle
you about what an accessibility

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:38.616 A:middle
label is, understanding the

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.646 A:middle
context for writing great

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:43.496 A:middle
labels, and best practices.

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:48.446 A:middle
So, let's -- so what is an

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:49.556 A:middle
accessibility label?

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:55.056 A:middle
Well, the definition is pretty

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:55.456 A:middle
short.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:57.916 A:middle
It's a localized string that

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.736 A:middle
succinctly identifies the

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.836 A:middle
But let's unpack that a bit.

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.706 A:middle
Identifies the accessibility

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:07.106 A:middle
element.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:09.466 A:middle
What does that mean exactly?

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.906 A:middle
It's a human readable, human

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.146 A:middle
understandable label that gives

00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:17.336 A:middle
context and meaning for the

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.326 A:middle
elements in your app.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.756 A:middle
And writing the code is pretty

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:23.466 A:middle
simple too.

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.026 A:middle
It's just getting or setting a

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:26.446 A:middle
string.

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:28.826 A:middle
But I get it.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:30.496 A:middle
It's actually pretty difficult

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.766 A:middle
to accurately label the elements

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:34.306 A:middle
in your app.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.866 A:middle
And as it turns out, that's all

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.286 A:middle
about the context.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.666 A:middle
So that's what I'm going to help

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.066 A:middle
you understand in the next few

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.026 A:middle
minutes, is the importance of

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:48.486 A:middle
understanding context.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.776 A:middle
So, let's dive right in.

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.256 A:middle
What should the label of this

00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:56.886 A:middle
button be in your app?

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
Well, by default it might be

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
Well, by default it might be

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:01.116 A:middle
called plus.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:03.186 A:middle
And I might be able to figure

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:03.896 A:middle
out what you meant.

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:07.606 A:middle
But, let's look at that with a

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.386 A:middle
bit more context.

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:15.016 A:middle
What about in a nav bar across

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.216 A:middle
from a back button?

00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:18.816 A:middle
This is pretty common in iOS

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:19.016 A:middle
apps.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:21.296 A:middle
What should the label of this

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:22.466 A:middle
button be here?

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:27.296 A:middle
Add? Well, that might be just

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:27.776 A:middle
dandy.

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:30.556 A:middle
If I'm in a notes app and I hear

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:33.096 A:middle
the word add, I'm going to know

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:34.276 A:middle
that that's going to add a new

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:34.716 A:middle
note.

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.366 A:middle
But remember, these labels are

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:38.736 A:middle
supposed to be succinct.

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:43.066 A:middle
In a shopping context I might

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.756 A:middle
need to clarify that a bit

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:47.066 A:middle
further to distinguish this app

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.146 A:middle
button from other actions like

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.546 A:middle
Add to Favorites.

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.826 A:middle
So, we might need to call that

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:54.466 A:middle
Add to Cart.

00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:58.716 A:middle
And, what if there were dozens

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.246 A:middle
of Add to Cart buttons?

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.246 A:middle
of Add to Cart buttons?

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.806 A:middle
In this context I might expect

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.036 A:middle
VoiceOver to say, add peanut

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:05.946 A:middle
butter to cart.

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.496 A:middle
And hopefully it's not crunchy

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:09.636 A:middle
peanut butter.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.116 A:middle
To bring it back to the original

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:15.056 A:middle
example, what should the label

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.826 A:middle
of this button be in your app?

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:24.326 A:middle
Well, that all depends on the

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
context.

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.116 A:middle
So, now let's talk about some

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.106 A:middle
best practices when considering

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:32.986 A:middle
what a label should be.

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:36.046 A:middle
First and foremost, always,

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:38.066 A:middle
always remember to add labels to

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.136 A:middle
your apps.

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:40.016 A:middle
This is crucial.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:42.656 A:middle
If a label's not added,

00:04:42.786 --> 00:04:44.246 A:middle
VoiceOver might speak something

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:44.646 A:middle
like.

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:47.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Button, button, button.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And for all I know guys, that

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:51.666 A:middle
could be the Delete hard drive

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.966 A:middle
Partition button and I wouldn't

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:54.596 A:middle
want to press that.

00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:58.696 A:middle
If there is no label added and

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.396 A:middle
if there's an image in the

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.396 A:middle
if there's an image in the

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:01.926 A:middle
button or if there's an image

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.096 A:middle
within the button, VoiceOver

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.286 A:middle
might speak something like --

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Plus underscore icon

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.256 A:middle
underscore outline underscore

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:10.156 A:middle
hash nine, nine, nine, nine,

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
nine, nine, dot.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What? What does that even

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:14.546 A:middle
mean?

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:20.006 A:middle
So please, please guys, add

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:21.696 A:middle
labels.

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.776 A:middle
VoiceOver knows what the element

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.646 A:middle
in your apps is based on the

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:26.396 A:middle
element type.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.216 A:middle
So, it's redundant to add text

00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:32.126 A:middle
to your string like button or

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:32.566 A:middle
tab.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.486 A:middle
And if you do, VoiceOver would

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:36.616 A:middle
read out the label like --

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Add button button.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:41.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hearing this though --

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Add button.

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:43.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Makes much more sense.

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:48.896 A:middle
Remember to update the label

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:50.196 A:middle
when the UI changes.

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:52.986 A:middle
So, if you have an add button --

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:54.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Add button.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That changes to a delete

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:56.756 A:middle
button --

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Delete button.

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:01.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Remember to update your UI so

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:01.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Remember to update your UI so

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:02.296 A:middle
that the label, so that

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.536 A:middle
VoiceOver will speak the correct

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:07.306 A:middle
state of the button.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.746 A:middle
When there's multiple buttons

00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:12.076 A:middle
with the same action like adding

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.166 A:middle
an item to the cart, remember to

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.426 A:middle
provide the context.

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:18.716 A:middle
Here it's not clear what I'm

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:19.076 A:middle
adding.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:20.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Add button.

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:22.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Am I adding the peanut

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:26.526 A:middle
butter, the bananas, or the

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:27.146 A:middle
cookies?

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:29.086 A:middle
Oh, I love cookies.

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:32.506 A:middle
The context is much more clear

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:33.216 A:middle
here.

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Add peanut butter button.

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:37.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, we're adding the peanut

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:37.926 A:middle
butter.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:39.696 A:middle
Hopefully it's not crunchy.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.226 A:middle
Avoid redundant labels.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:47.836 A:middle
So, if I'm in a music player the

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:49.836 A:middle
context is clear that we're

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:51.476 A:middle
dealing with songs.

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:54.156 A:middle
So, having VoiceOver speak --

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:56.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Play song button.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Or next song, is unnecessary.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Or next song, is unnecessary.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.786 A:middle
I'd much rather hear VoiceOver

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.316 A:middle
speak --

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:05.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Play button.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:08.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Just the word play.

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:11.566 A:middle
It's also great to add labels to

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.956 A:middle
your animations, such as your

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
spinners.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:15.306 A:middle
So that VoiceOver will let me

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:17.146 A:middle
know that the content in your

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.156 A:middle
app is --

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:19.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Loading.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:20.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Loading.

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:21.106 A:middle
That's really important.

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:25.046 A:middle
So, this --

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:27.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Delete items from the current

00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:28.726 A:middle
folder and add it to the trash

00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:29.096 A:middle
button.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That is too verbose.

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:33.626 A:middle
Remember, we want these labels

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:36.356 A:middle
to be as succinct as possible.

00:07:37.526 --> 00:07:39.516 A:middle
And, the context really makes

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:41.226 A:middle
things in your app clear.

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.406 A:middle
So, this --

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Delete button.

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:46.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Would be just fine.

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:51.626 A:middle
But verbosity isn't always a bad

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:52.156 A:middle
thing though.

00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:55.516 A:middle
Oftentimes verbose descriptions

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
when in appropriate situations

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.136 A:middle
is really what makes your app

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.746 A:middle
fun and memorable.

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.746 A:middle
fun and memorable.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:02.886 A:middle
The developers of the Cookie

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:05.046 A:middle
Monster sticker packs have added

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:07.876 A:middle
verbose but really fun labels to

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:08.526 A:middle
their stickers.

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:11.076 A:middle
So now, VoiceOver speaks --

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Me happy face eat small

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:15.456 A:middle
cookie, om nom nom button.

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:16.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I love that.

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:18.166 A:middle
That is so awesome.

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
These Cookie Monster stickers

00:08:20.246 --> 00:08:22.776 A:middle
are intended to be fun and just

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.306 A:middle
make a person smile.

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.556 A:middle
Whether you can see the sticker

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.116 A:middle
or you hear the label.

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.856 A:middle
So, let's review.

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.846 A:middle
Remember to add labels so that

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:37.846 A:middle
VoiceOver doesn't speak "button,

00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:39.586 A:middle
button, button."

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:43.796 A:middle
Don't include the element type

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.646 A:middle
in your label because VoiceOver

00:08:45.646 --> 00:08:47.516 A:middle
gathers that info already.

00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:50.616 A:middle
So, hearing add button button is

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:51.576 A:middle
unnecessary.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.016 A:middle
Update the labels when your UI

00:08:55.226 --> 00:08:55.646 A:middle
changes.

00:08:56.276 --> 00:08:57.526 A:middle
So, when you have that add

00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:59.016 A:middle
button that changes to a delete

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.906 A:middle
button, remember to update your

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.906 A:middle
button, remember to update your

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:02.396 A:middle
label so VoiceOver reads the

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:03.836 A:middle
correct state of the button.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.236 A:middle
Avoid redundancy like play song,

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.146 A:middle
next song, previous song.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.846 A:middle
In a music player, remember to

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.516 A:middle
provide enough context so I know

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:17.876 A:middle
whether I'm adding peanut

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:19.586 A:middle
butter, bananas, or those

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:20.976 A:middle
awesome cookies to my cart.

00:09:24.536 --> 00:09:26.066 A:middle
Add labels to your meaningful

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.486 A:middle
animations like spinners, so

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:30.876 A:middle
that VoiceOver will read that

00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.446 A:middle
the content in your app is

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:35.986 A:middle
loading or in progress.

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.416 A:middle
Avoid verbose labels like delete

00:09:39.416 --> 00:09:41.016 A:middle
current item from the trash and

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:42.366 A:middle
move it.

00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:44.176 A:middle
Unless you have a great reason

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:45.216 A:middle
like those awesome Cookie

00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:46.846 A:middle
Monster stickers.

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:51.626 A:middle
I really hope you've enjoyed

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:53.396 A:middle
learning about best practices

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.586 A:middle
for labeling your apps.

00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:57.526 A:middle
But if you're ever curious what

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:58.676 A:middle
your app would sound like to a

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:01.026 A:middle
VoiceOver user, I really

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:01.026 A:middle
VoiceOver user, I really

00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:03.266 A:middle
encourage you to turn it on and

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:04.166 A:middle
swipe around.

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:07.066 A:middle
It's really a great opportunity

00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
to improve your app for

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:09.386 A:middle
everyone.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:10.866 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:16.500 A:middle
