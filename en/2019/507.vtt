[ Music ]

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:08.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Eryk Vershen.

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:09.826 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the HLS

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:10.676 A:middle
Streaming Team.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.906 A:middle
Let's get started talking about

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:14.656 A:middle
HLS Authoring for AirPlay 2

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:15.186 A:middle
Video.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:19.016 A:middle
Ever since we introduced AirPlay

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:21.136 A:middle
on iOS users have enjoyed

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.996 A:middle
AirPlaying video to their Apple

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:26.216 A:middle
TVs and starting this year we're

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.546 A:middle
expanding that support

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:29.926 A:middle
dramatically with AirPlay built

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.456 A:middle
directly into TVs.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.906 A:middle
Apple TV and AirPlay capable TVs

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:37.736 A:middle
both provide the highest quality

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.196 A:middle
video playback experience.

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:41.496 A:middle
You may remember that we have

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:43.406 A:middle
some specific requirements for

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:45.476 A:middle
content delivered to tvOS and

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.246 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.956 A:middle
These AirPlay capable TVs are a

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.676 A:middle
new class of devices so they

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.096 A:middle
have their own requirements.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.076 A:middle
We have a simple agenda.

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.886 A:middle
I'll cover the new requirements

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.596 A:middle
and then I'll talk about changes

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.296 A:middle
we made to the validation tools

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.296 A:middle
we made to the validation tools

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:01.816 A:middle
to help you check for issues.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.606 A:middle
We released a new version of the

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:08.206 A:middle
HLS authoring specification

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:09.676 A:middle
recently that talks about the

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:11.376 A:middle
additional requirements for

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:12.076 A:middle
AirPlay 2.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:15.996 A:middle
Here is a condensed list.

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:18.136 A:middle
Don't worry about absorbing this

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:18.856 A:middle
list right now.

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:20.366 A:middle
I'll devote a whole slide to

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.266 A:middle
each line item.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.346 A:middle
Let's look at the details.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.536 A:middle
You need to synchronize the

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:27.576 A:middle
different variants.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.346 A:middle
This makes switching easier.

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:31.626 A:middle
If these color bars represent

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:32.576 A:middle
different variants on a

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:35.806 A:middle
timeline, what we want to do is

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.756 A:middle
make them all line up nicely.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:39.856 A:middle
We are recommending that you use

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:41.526 A:middle
at least millisecond precision

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:44.186 A:middle
and as always your video

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.206 A:middle
segments should start with IDR

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:46.856 A:middle
frames.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:49.756 A:middle
You also want to avoid most

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.246 A:middle
changes of discontinuities.

00:01:51.426 --> 00:01:53.396 A:middle
For example, do not switch

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:56.296 A:middle
between HEVC and H.264 or

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.196 A:middle
between AAC and Dolby Digital.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.146 A:middle
These TVs aren't able to switch

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.146 A:middle
These TVs aren't able to switch

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.076 A:middle
as seamlessly as iOS or Apple

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:03.576 A:middle
TV.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:06.116 A:middle
You can change your frame rate

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
but not arbitrarily.

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.306 A:middle
No switching between 25 frame

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:10.515 A:middle
per second and 30.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:15.146 A:middle
You also want each codec to

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:16.596 A:middle
provide a good set of variance

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:17.416 A:middle
on its own.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.646 A:middle
These TVs will stick with the

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.696 A:middle
codec they start with.

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:23.116 A:middle
So, in particular, don't try to

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.166 A:middle
use H.264 just for low

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.276 A:middle
resolution video and HEVC for

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:28.486 A:middle
high-resolution video.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.766 A:middle
That works on other devices but

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:31.406 A:middle
not here.

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.766 A:middle
You should, of course, be using

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:34.946 A:middle
I-frame variance.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.716 A:middle
They make fast-forward, rewind

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:38.066 A:middle
and seeking more effective.

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.186 A:middle
Because these devices don't want

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.706 A:middle
to switch codecs you need to

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.416 A:middle
have a set of I-frame variance

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.946 A:middle
matching the codec of the normal

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:45.436 A:middle
video.

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:49.676 A:middle
The encryption requirements

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.226 A:middle
listed here aren't really

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:53.216 A:middle
specific to AirPlay 2, but we

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:54.266 A:middle
wanted to call them out.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.066 A:middle
The common encryption standard

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.906 A:middle
recommends 10% partial

00:02:58.906 --> 00:02:59.446 A:middle
encryption.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
With FairPlay we are requiring

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
With FairPlay we are requiring

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:03.456 A:middle
it; other patterns will not

00:03:03.456 --> 00:03:03.866 A:middle
work.

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.446 A:middle
For sample encryption there are

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.506 A:middle
two ways to market.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.836 A:middle
The CMAF way with an senc box

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:12.586 A:middle
and the ISO base media file

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:14.926 A:middle
format way with a pair of saio

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:16.726 A:middle
and saiz boxes.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:18.706 A:middle
We prefer the second form, but

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:19.746 A:middle
you can provide both.

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.156 A:middle
Lastly, some miscellaneous

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:23.866 A:middle
requirements.

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
If you want to provide HDR

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:27.456 A:middle
content, your best bet is to

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:29.206 A:middle
provide multiple formats.

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:30.956 A:middle
For example, Dolby Vision and

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:33.536 A:middle
HDR 10 as TVs may support only

00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:37.256 A:middle
one of the formats, use WebVTT

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:40.096 A:middle
for subtitles and we are now

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.916 A:middle
recommending MIME types for all

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:42.606 A:middle
your content.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:44.426 A:middle
Let's go into little more detail

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:45.006 A:middle
about that.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.196 A:middle
We've had a MIME type for HLS

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.556 A:middle
playlist for a long time.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:51.656 A:middle
The MIME types we are suggesting

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.296 A:middle
for video and audio are what you

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.076 A:middle
might expect.

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:56.756 A:middle
Notice we are using text/plain

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.626 A:middle
for WebVTT even though the

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.576 A:middle
WebVTT spec says text/VTT.

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.576 A:middle
WebVTT spec says text/VTT.

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:04.846 A:middle
However, the text VTT type was

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.796 A:middle
not registered with the IANA and

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.796 A:middle
will be rejected by some

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:09.366 A:middle
clients.

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.886 A:middle
So use text/plain instead.

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:15.386 A:middle
Here's a list of some of the

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.896 A:middle
less common MIME types.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.875 A:middle
Now the last 2 on this list are

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.446 A:middle
not applicable to AirPlay 2

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.116 A:middle
content.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:22.476 A:middle
I've listed them because we are

00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:24.026 A:middle
recommending MIME types for all

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:25.866 A:middle
content not just AirPlay 2.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:30.146 A:middle
Let's turn to how you can check

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:30.906 A:middle
your streams.

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:34.776 A:middle
Remember that there are two

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.936 A:middle
tools for HLS validation.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.036 A:middle
These tools are complementary.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.796 A:middle
Mediastreamvalidator is checking

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:44.296 A:middle
against the HLS specification.

00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:45.786 A:middle
HLSreport on the other hand is

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.136 A:middle
checking against the authoring

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:47.986 A:middle
specification.

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:50.296 A:middle
You should always be using both

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:50.856 A:middle
tools.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
I suggest you make a script that

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:53.656 A:middle
runs them as a pair.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.916 A:middle
We've made an important change

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:58.016 A:middle
to HLSreport.

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:00.086 A:middle
Formerly you had to run it

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:00.086 A:middle
Formerly you had to run it

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:02.206 A:middle
multiple times with the dash os

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:03.556 A:middle
option if you wanted to check

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.836 A:middle
the rules for iOS and TVOS.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.676 A:middle
Now it checks all rule sets by

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:10.456 A:middle
default including the rules for

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.216 A:middle
AirPlay 2.

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:14.346 A:middle
The rule set option is there to

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.726 A:middle
modify the sets you check but

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:17.206 A:middle
most of you won't need to use

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:17.366 A:middle
it.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.586 A:middle
And while the OS option does

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.156 A:middle
still work, you should stop

00:05:21.156 --> 00:05:21.706 A:middle
using it.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.376 A:middle
Let's look at how the output

00:05:25.376 --> 00:05:27.116 A:middle
from HLSreport has changed.

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:30.326 A:middle
Notice that the title line now

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:32.056 A:middle
shows all the rule sets that

00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:32.656 A:middle
were checked.

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.126 A:middle
The rules portion is now grouped

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:38.886 A:middle
into sections for each rule set.

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:40.736 A:middle
Here we have the general

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:41.456 A:middle
requirements.

00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:43.696 A:middle
There can be Must Fix and Should

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.766 A:middle
Fix subsections for each rule

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:46.116 A:middle
set.

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:49.576 A:middle
Now farther down in the output

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:51.366 A:middle
we have the iOS requirements.

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:54.096 A:middle
I want you to notice that rule

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:56.136 A:middle
10 above here the last general

00:05:56.136 --> 00:05:58.166 A:middle
rule is marked as Should Fix.

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:01.666 A:middle
Whereas here in the AirPlay 2

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:01.666 A:middle
Whereas here in the AirPlay 2

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
section the same rule is a Must

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:03.926 A:middle
Fix.

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:07.966 A:middle
If there are no rule violations

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.516 A:middle
for a section or subsection,

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:10.956 A:middle
then that section or subsection

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:11.586 A:middle
is dropped.

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:13.876 A:middle
For example, this stream has no

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.566 A:middle
Should F ixes for AirPlay 2.

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:19.656 A:middle
The main points to take away are

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.496 A:middle
we added new requirements for

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:22.726 A:middle
AirPlay 2 devices.

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:25.456 A:middle
Remember to use HLSreport so you

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.616 A:middle
check against the authoring

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
specification.
