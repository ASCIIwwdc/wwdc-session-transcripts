00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.176 A:middle
My name is Ricky Mondello, and I

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.016 A:middle
am so excited to be here to

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.126 A:middle
today to tell you about What's

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:25.926 A:middle
New in Authentication on Apple

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.626 A:middle
platforms, including some very

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.856 A:middle
exciting and new APIs in the

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.156 A:middle
Authentication Services

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:32.606 A:middle
framework.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.136 A:middle
My goal is to help you get your

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.526 A:middle
users signed into your apps as

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.706 A:middle
quickly and securely as

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:41.196 A:middle
possible.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.086 A:middle
We're going to talk about five

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:50.426 A:middle
topics today starting with Sign

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:52.000 A:middle
In with Apple.

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:56.736 A:middle
Sign In with Apple is an easy

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:59.146 A:middle
and secure way for users to sign

00:00:59.146 --> 00:00:59.936 A:middle
into your apps.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.926 A:middle
Signing in is as quick as a few

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:10.616 A:middle
taps and a face ID check.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.736 A:middle
Sign In with Apple is a private

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.626 A:middle
alternative to other single

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.466 A:middle
sign-on providers that you might

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:16.986 A:middle
be aware of.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.746 A:middle
And you probably already get the

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.266 A:middle
gist of what this capability is

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:21.776 A:middle
about.

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:23.716 A:middle
But what I want to do is

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.616 A:middle
emphasize a few key points

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.656 A:middle
related to how Authentication

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.136 A:middle
works already in your apps.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.396 A:middle
And the first is that for your

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:35.196 A:middle
users, Sign In with Apple is

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:36.776 A:middle
easier to use than passwords.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:40.356 A:middle
People generally don't love

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:41.626 A:middle
managing passwords.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:44.166 A:middle
And when users don't have a

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.386 A:middle
password, that password can't be

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.286 A:middle
a bad password, and it can't get

00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:50.136 A:middle
phished, which is good for your

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:52.136 A:middle
users, but it's also good for

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:52.446 A:middle
you.

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:56.306 A:middle
And for you specifically, these

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.526 A:middle
accounts are great accounts.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:00.776 A:middle
Every single one of the accounts

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:00.776 A:middle
Every single one of the accounts

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
that can be used with Sign In

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:04.616 A:middle
with Apple has strong two-factor

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.466 A:middle
authentication that's already

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.126 A:middle
used to protect their Apple ID.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:10.696 A:middle
This two-factor authentication

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:12.286 A:middle
involves the user's circle of

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.186 A:middle
trusted devices and strong

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:14.946 A:middle
biometrics.

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:17.796 A:middle
Having a user start off with

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:19.706 A:middle
this much security is a lot

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.266 A:middle
easier than trying to bolt it on

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.496 A:middle
after the fact to a

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:23.516 A:middle
password-based account.

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:26.336 A:middle
And to help you with fraud,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.126 A:middle
there's information included in

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:31.596 A:middle
the API about how Apple is

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:32.836 A:middle
confident about the account

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:34.416 A:middle
being from a real user, which

00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:34.986 A:middle
you're going to really

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:36.106 A:middle
appreciate.

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:38.286 A:middle
And the third point that I want

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:39.696 A:middle
to emphasize about Sign In with

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:42.636 A:middle
Apple is that it is across

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
platform experience, across all

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.126 A:middle
of the user's devices.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:48.456 A:middle
If they're signed into their

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:50.966 A:middle
Apple ID, signing into your app

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:53.466 A:middle
is as easy as a quick face ID or

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.266 A:middle
touch ID check.

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:56.996 A:middle
And thanks to the web and web

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.036 A:middle
technologies, Sign In with Apple

00:02:59.036 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
is available elsewhere.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.016 A:middle
And don't worry.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:05.246 A:middle
We're going to help your users

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.776 A:middle
not create a second account for

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.646 A:middle
your app if the user already has

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:10.516 A:middle
one that works for them.

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.636 A:middle
On app launch, your app can

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:15.316 A:middle
check for an existing

00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:17.036 A:middle
password-based account saved to

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.396 A:middle
the iCloud Keychain even before

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:20.656 A:middle
you show your standard login

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:22.636 A:middle
interface so that users do the

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.000 A:middle
right thing.

00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:28.136 A:middle
If you have a service with user

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.576 A:middle
accounts, you and your users can

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.086 A:middle
benefit from Sign In with Apple.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.196 A:middle
To learn more about it,

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:36.276 A:middle
including how to adopt it on the

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:39.216 A:middle
web, watchOS, tvOS, the Mac,

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:43.826 A:middle
iPadOS, and iOS, check out

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.266 A:middle
Introducing Sign In with Apple

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:47.846 A:middle
in the WWDC app.

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:55.006 A:middle
And that's Sign In with Apple, a

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.646 A:middle
convenient and private

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:58.876 A:middle
alternative to password-based

00:03:58.876 --> 00:03:59.556 A:middle
authentication.

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:01.576 A:middle
And password-based

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.516 A:middle
authentication is actually my

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:06.116 A:middle
next topic because even in a

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:08.386 A:middle
world with a great, private

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.816 A:middle
single sign-on option, passwords

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:11.856 A:middle
are still going to be a part of

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:12.196 A:middle
our lives.

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.256 A:middle
And that's why iPhone has

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.926 A:middle
Password AutoFill, which makes

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.946 A:middle
it quick and easy for users to

00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:22.406 A:middle
sign in to your apps on the

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:23.916 A:middle
existing login screens that you

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:24.486 A:middle
already have.

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:28.166 A:middle
Today, I am very excited to tell

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.976 A:middle
you that Password AutoFill is

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.106 A:middle
available for iPad apps for Mac

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:33.926 A:middle
with an interface that is

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:36.076 A:middle
specifically tailored to the

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:37.476 A:middle
Mac.

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:39.346 A:middle
Thanks. For users to get this

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.706 A:middle
deluxe experience that you see

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.496 A:middle
right here, where the exact

00:04:42.496 --> 00:04:43.886 A:middle
right credential that the user

00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:45.116 A:middle
wants to sign in with is in the

00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:47.146 A:middle
list, there's just one thing

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.956 A:middle
that you have to do.

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:50.286 A:middle
Once you've brought your app to

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:52.166 A:middle
the Mac, it'll have a new app

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.606 A:middle
ID, and that app ID has to be

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:56.416 A:middle
listed on your server in order

00:04:56.416 --> 00:04:58.236 A:middle
to tie your app and your website

00:04:58.236 --> 00:04:59.216 A:middle
together.

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:02.736 A:middle
If you're using webcredentials

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:04.716 A:middle
to do this, your Apple app site

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:06.556 A:middle
association file might look

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.346 A:middle
something like this.

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:10.016 A:middle
And all you're going to do is

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.826 A:middle
add the app ID to this app's

00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:12.036 A:middle
array.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:13.576 A:middle
Super easy.

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:18.346 A:middle
But if you're using universal

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:21.066 A:middle
links, you'll add the new app ID

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:24.526 A:middle
here as part of the new app ID's

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:26.126 A:middle
key that can take a list.

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:30.066 A:middle
This key is new to iOS 13 and

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:31.116 A:middle
macOS Catalina.

00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:35.086 A:middle
To maintain compatibility with

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.926 A:middle
iOS versions before 13, you'll

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:40.086 A:middle
want to keep this apps key with

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:42.896 A:middle
the value of an array and the

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:44.636 A:middle
app ID key that lists your

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.886 A:middle
existing iOS app.

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:48.326 A:middle
You really want to do this in

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:50.066 A:middle
order to ensure that universal

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.356 A:middle
links keep working for your

00:05:51.356 --> 00:05:53.276 A:middle
users who are running iOS 12.

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:56.306 A:middle
There are a bunch of new

00:05:56.306 --> 00:05:57.756 A:middle
features and universal links

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.796 A:middle
this year, including more

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
powerful URL matching.

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
powerful URL matching.

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:03.776 A:middle
And to learn more about those, I

00:06:03.776 --> 00:06:05.036 A:middle
encourage you to check out the

00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:06.856 A:middle
What's New in Universal Links

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:09.946 A:middle
video in the WWDC app.

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:18.416 A:middle
Whether on the Mac, iPad, Apple

00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:21.476 A:middle
TV, or iPhone, Password AutoFill

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.296 A:middle
makes it easy for users to get

00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:24.946 A:middle
signed in to apps on your

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.116 A:middle
existing login screens.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:30.176 A:middle
But let's take a closer look at

00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:31.346 A:middle
this screen right here.

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:33.516 A:middle
The user's current task of

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:34.656 A:middle
getting signed into your app?

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:36.896 A:middle
The answer to the problem is

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.096 A:middle
here.

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:38.576 A:middle
It's a small part of the

00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:39.026 A:middle
keyboard.

00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:42.076 A:middle
And this is great, because

00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:43.896 A:middle
AutoFill is accommodating the

00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:45.996 A:middle
username and password field

00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:47.876 A:middle
combination pattern that we've

00:06:47.876 --> 00:06:50.036 A:middle
seen for even before when iPhone

00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:50.736 A:middle
existed.

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:53.796 A:middle
But your app can have an even

00:06:53.796 --> 00:06:55.786 A:middle
more streamlined and intentional

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:58.526 A:middle
experience, and with iOS 13,

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:00.646 A:middle
it's easier to do this than ever

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:00.646 A:middle
it's easier to do this than ever

00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:01.106 A:middle
before.

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:03.956 A:middle
The same sign-in experience I

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.476 A:middle
showed you earlier in the

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:06.976 A:middle
context of Sign In with Apple,

00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:09.226 A:middle
is available to all apps that

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:10.186 A:middle
use passwords.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.886 A:middle
And it's available through the

00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:13.086 A:middle
authentication services

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:13.526 A:middle
framework.

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.916 A:middle
The same API and functionality

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.526 A:middle
is also available on macOS

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:20.016 A:middle
Catalina.

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:29.176 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:31.306 A:middle
Let's talk about how to add this

00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:33.286 A:middle
functionality to your apps.

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:36.376 A:middle
The first step is to write some

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:37.586 A:middle
code using the

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:38.756 A:middle
AuthenticationServices

00:07:38.756 --> 00:07:39.156 A:middle
framework.

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:41.786 A:middle
You'll create an

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:44.296 A:middle
AuthorizationController using a

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:45.406 A:middle
password request.

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:48.006 A:middle
The AuthorizationController is

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:49.486 A:middle
the same object that you'll use

00:07:49.486 --> 00:07:50.526 A:middle
for Sign In with Apple.

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:52.466 A:middle
But here we're just using a

00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
different kind of request.

00:07:55.456 --> 00:07:58.286 A:middle
Then you'll set up a delegate as

00:07:58.286 --> 00:07:59.886 A:middle
well as an object that will help

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:01.366 A:middle
coordinate presentation of the

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:01.366 A:middle
coordinate presentation of the

00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:01.976 A:middle
interface.

00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:04.796 A:middle
And then it'll tell the

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:05.896 A:middle
controller to perform the

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:06.826 A:middle
request.

00:08:08.296 --> 00:08:10.166 A:middle
When the user has selected the

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.516 A:middle
account that they want to use,

00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:15.026 A:middle
the API will call the delegate,

00:08:15.476 --> 00:08:16.986 A:middle
and you can take it from there

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:18.536 A:middle
to complete the sign-in.

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:21.716 A:middle
If didCompleteWithError is

00:08:21.716 --> 00:08:23.626 A:middle
immediately called for you, it

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:24.846 A:middle
might mean that your user

00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:26.406 A:middle
doesn't have any passwords saved

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:28.016 A:middle
in their iCloud Keychain for

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:28.926 A:middle
your app and website.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:31.256 A:middle
And then you should just

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:32.446 A:middle
fallback to showing your normal

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:33.166 A:middle
sign-in screen.

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:34.395 A:middle
The user can take it from there.

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:37.106 A:middle
But if you're sure that you have

00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:38.976 A:middle
credentials on a test device and

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.366 A:middle
you're seeing the error handler

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:42.196 A:middle
get called, you're going to want

00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:43.275 A:middle
to back to checking your

00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:44.326 A:middle
associated domains.

00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:46.746 A:middle
If you've never tied your app

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:48.056 A:middle
and website together before

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
through associated domains,

00:08:50.056 --> 00:08:51.816 A:middle
Introducing Password AutoFill

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:53.996 A:middle
for Apps has a step-by-step

00:08:53.996 --> 00:08:55.016 A:middle
tutorial that'll take you

00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:55.336 A:middle
through it.

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.316 A:middle
It's pretty easy.

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.386 A:middle
And for universal links, once

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
again, you're going to want to

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
again, you're going to want to

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:02.466 A:middle
check out the Universal Links

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:05.326 A:middle
video that's in the WWDC app.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.276 A:middle
Something about this API that is

00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.586 A:middle
really awesome is that you can

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.076 A:middle
request multiple types of

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:16.036 A:middle
accounts at the same time using

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:17.256 A:middle
the AuthorizationController.

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:20.206 A:middle
And this is super handy if you

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:22.036 A:middle
want to check for both a

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:24.176 A:middle
password-based account and Sign

00:09:24.176 --> 00:09:26.076 A:middle
In with Apple right around app

00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:26.396 A:middle
launch.

00:09:27.636 --> 00:09:29.336 A:middle
If you do this, you're going to

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:30.196 A:middle
want to make sure that you

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:32.166 A:middle
handle both types of credentials

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:34.356 A:middle
in the CompleteWithAuthorization

00:09:34.356 --> 00:09:35.646 A:middle
delegate method.

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:39.636 A:middle
And that's how easy it is to use

00:09:39.636 --> 00:09:41.586 A:middle
the new Authentication services

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.286 A:middle
APIs to make the process of

00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:45.666 A:middle
getting signed into your apps

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:47.516 A:middle
even more streamlined than

00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:48.846 A:middle
password AutoFill was able to.

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:56.686 A:middle
As long as we have passwords,

00:09:57.956 --> 00:09:59.156 A:middle
there needs to be a healthy way

00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:01.806 A:middle
to use them, a safe way to use

00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:01.806 A:middle
to use them, a safe way to use

00:10:01.806 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
them.

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:04.726 A:middle
And that's why iPhone has

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:06.746 A:middle
Automatic Strong Passwords,

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.466 A:middle
which encourages users to use a

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:11.806 A:middle
strong, unique password for

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:12.816 A:middle
every single one of their

00:10:12.816 --> 00:10:15.056 A:middle
accounts, which greatly improves

00:10:15.056 --> 00:10:17.436 A:middle
their security while also being

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:18.746 A:middle
easier to do than making the

00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:20.316 A:middle
mistake of trying to create a

00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:21.206 A:middle
password by hand.

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:23.746 A:middle
But what if one of your users

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.206 A:middle
already has a password that's

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:25.716 A:middle
kind of weak?

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:30.096 A:middle
Now, in Safari 13 and iOS 13,

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.796 A:middle
when a user signs into a website

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:34.536 A:middle
and Safari notices that the

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.966 A:middle
password they just used was

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:38.536 A:middle
weak, Safari will prompt the

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:40.706 A:middle
user to go and visit the website

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
to change the password.

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:43.726 A:middle
And this is at the moment of

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.246 A:middle
sign-in where the user might be

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:46.696 A:middle
thinking about what the account

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:47.266 A:middle
means to them.

00:10:47.836 --> 00:10:50.346 A:middle
If the user accepts Safari's

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:51.826 A:middle
offer, they'll be taken over to

00:10:51.826 --> 00:10:54.266 A:middle
Settings where they can change

00:10:54.266 --> 00:10:54.886 A:middle
their password.

00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:56.546 A:middle
And with Automatic Strong

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.806 A:middle
Passwords, it's just a few taps

00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:01.846 A:middle
to get upgraded.

00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:01.846 A:middle

on the Mac as well with Safari

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:11.000 A:middle
13.

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:18.066 A:middle
This flow is at its best when

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:20.136 A:middle
your user is taken directly to

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:22.166 A:middle
your website's Change Password

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:24.186 A:middle
page rather than to the homepage

00:11:24.186 --> 00:11:24.596 A:middle
of the site.

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:27.296 A:middle
And what's really cool is that

00:11:27.296 --> 00:11:28.566 A:middle
this is completely in your

00:11:28.566 --> 00:11:30.216 A:middle
control and super easy to

00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:30.656 A:middle
implement.

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:33.826 A:middle
Websites like Twitter, GitHub,

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.556 A:middle
and WordPress.com have already

00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:37.396 A:middle
adopted it.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.186 A:middle
All you have to do is put a

00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:41.056 A:middle
redirect at this path on your

00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:43.056 A:middle
server that takes the user to

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.486 A:middle
your Change Password webpage,

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:45.886 A:middle
and that's it.

00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:48.116 A:middle
The redirect can be implemented

00:11:48.246 --> 00:11:49.636 A:middle
either as a client-side redirect

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:51.436 A:middle
or a server-side redirect.

00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:54.646 A:middle
You can learn more about the

00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:56.206 A:middle
well-known URL for changing

00:11:56.206 --> 00:11:58.586 A:middle
passwords, which is a proposed

00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:00.426 A:middle
standard at this URL.

00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:00.426 A:middle
standard at this URL.

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:02.726 A:middle
You'll also find it pretty

00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:04.086 A:middle
easily if you search the web for

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:04.746 A:middle
it.

00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:13.176 A:middle
And that is how iOS 13, iPadOS,

00:12:13.596 --> 00:12:16.536 A:middle
and Safari 13 help users upgrade

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:17.426 A:middle
their weak passwords.

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:22.236 A:middle
Some of your apps authenticate

00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:24.096 A:middle
using a third-party web service,

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.936 A:middle
and if you're doing this, you're

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:27.456 A:middle
probably using a standard like

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:27.976 A:middle
OAuth.

00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:31.226 A:middle
The Authentication's Services

00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:31.866 A:middle
frameworks

00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:34.526 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession is

00:12:34.526 --> 00:12:36.006 A:middle
the best way to do this kind of

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:36.706 A:middle
authentication.

00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:39.976 A:middle
Once a user confirms that

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:42.086 A:middle
they're OK with signing in, the

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:43.916 A:middle
AuthenticationSession will use

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.896 A:middle
existing signed-in accounts

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:47.586 A:middle
through Safari's cookies and

00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:49.716 A:middle
data in order to let the user

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:51.186 A:middle
sign-in even faster.

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:54.836 A:middle
Sometimes the user will already

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:56.356 A:middle
be signed in to the identity

00:12:56.356 --> 00:12:58.506 A:middle
provider, and all they have to

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:00.566 A:middle
do is agree to signing into your

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:00.566 A:middle
do is agree to signing into your

00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:01.006 A:middle
app.

00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:03.186 A:middle
And once they do that, they're

00:13:03.186 --> 00:13:03.666 A:middle
in.

00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:06.276 A:middle
Nice and easy.

00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:08.556 A:middle
I am so happy to be able to tell

00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:11.036 A:middle
you today that this API is now

00:13:11.036 --> 00:13:15.576 A:middle
available on macOS Catalina.

[ Applause ]

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:23.616 A:middle
On macOS Catalina, this API uses

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:25.446 A:middle
the user's preferred web browser

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:27.386 A:middle
for signing in if that web

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:28.326 A:middle
browser supports it.

00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:30.186 A:middle
And this is really great,

00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:31.936 A:middle
because it means that all of

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.806 A:middle
your users will have their

00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:35.696 A:middle
browser's password manager or

00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:37.036 A:middle
password manager extension

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:38.476 A:middle
available to them in order to

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.266 A:middle
help get them signed in.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
If you're using the

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:46.156 A:middle
AuthenticationSession API, it

00:13:46.156 --> 00:13:47.456 A:middle
has a few new features for you

00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:48.216 A:middle
to use this year.

00:13:48.326 --> 00:13:51.546 A:middle
And the first is a more private

00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:53.136 A:middle
kind of sign-in.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:55.296 A:middle
Because the

00:13:55.296 --> 00:13:57.216 A:middle
AuthenticationSession shares

00:13:57.216 --> 00:13:58.726 A:middle
website data with Safari,

ASWebAuthenticationSession

00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:03.686 A:middle
enables a single sign-on

00:14:03.686 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
experience.

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:08.116 A:middle
New to iOS 13, your app can

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:10.436 A:middle
choose to deliver a more private

00:14:10.436 --> 00:14:12.716 A:middle
experience, an experience that

00:14:12.716 --> 00:14:14.896 A:middle
won't leave users logged into

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.446 A:middle
the identity provider in their

00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:18.306 A:middle
web browser after they've signed

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:19.466 A:middle
into your app.

00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:22.036 A:middle
If your app asks for this

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.546 A:middle
experience, users won't see this

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:25.026 A:middle
dialog.

00:14:25.886 --> 00:14:27.726 A:middle
Instead, they'll be taken

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:28.966 A:middle
directly to the identity

00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:30.826 A:middle
provider in order to get signed

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:31.496 A:middle
in.

00:14:33.576 --> 00:14:35.266 A:middle
To do this, set the

00:14:35.266 --> 00:14:36.616 A:middle
prefersEphemeral

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:38.836 A:middle
WebBrowserSession property on

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.626 A:middle
the session to true before

00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:41.426 A:middle
starting the session.

00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:44.376 A:middle
By doing this, you give your

00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:47.396 A:middle
users more privacy and avoid

00:14:47.396 --> 00:14:49.486 A:middle
that confirmation dialog, which

00:14:49.486 --> 00:14:50.796 A:middle
overall might be a better

00:14:50.796 --> 00:14:52.426 A:middle
experience for your app.

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.806 A:middle
Next, supporting multiple

00:14:56.806 --> 00:14:57.266 A:middle
windows.

00:14:58.706 --> 00:15:00.126 A:middle
In iOS 12, the

00:14:58.706 --> 00:15:00.126 A:middle
In iOS 12, the

00:15:00.126 --> 00:15:02.586 A:middle
AuthenticationSession API didn't

00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:05.146 A:middle
need any information about view

00:15:05.146 --> 00:15:07.186 A:middle
or windows from you in order to

00:15:07.186 --> 00:15:08.236 A:middle
display its interface.

00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:11.326 A:middle
This is because the API was iOS

00:15:11.326 --> 00:15:14.186 A:middle
only, and almost all apps drew

00:15:14.186 --> 00:15:15.236 A:middle
into a single window.

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:19.136 A:middle
But now with iPadOS and macOS

00:15:19.136 --> 00:15:20.686 A:middle
support, you're going to have to

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.076 A:middle
help us out a little bit to

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:23.106 A:middle
figure out where to draw the

00:15:23.106 --> 00:15:23.686 A:middle
interface.

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:28.726 A:middle
First, you'll give the session a

00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:30.746 A:middle
presentationContextProvider, and

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:33.466 A:middle
that presentationContextProvider

00:15:33.796 --> 00:15:35.606 A:middle
will provide a window via the

00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:36.896 A:middle
PresentationAnchor method.

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:39.316 A:middle
This is a really easy change and

00:15:39.316 --> 00:15:40.946 A:middle
one that you're definitely going

00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:43.926 A:middle
to want to make.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:45.026 A:middle
One more thing about OAuth.

00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:48.576 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession has a

00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:50.936 A:middle
deprecated predecessor called

00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:52.226 A:middle
SFAuthenticationSession.

00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:54.116 A:middle
It's from the Safari Services

00:15:54.116 --> 00:15:54.526 A:middle
framework.

00:15:55.536 --> 00:15:57.046 A:middle
If you haven't already, you're

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:58.076 A:middle
going to want to take a moment

00:15:58.076 --> 00:15:58.916 A:middle
to switch over.

00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:02.216 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession has

00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.256 A:middle
the new features that we just

00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:05.556 A:middle
talked about, and it's available

00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:06.856 A:middle
on the Mac.

00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:07.786 A:middle
It's, basically, the

00:16:07.786 --> 00:16:09.636 A:middle
non-deprecated drop-in

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.026 A:middle
replacement for the old API.

00:16:11.756 --> 00:16:15.936 A:middle
And that's it for OAuth.

00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:23.776 A:middle
This year, macOS supports USB

00:16:23.936 --> 00:16:26.906 A:middle
security keys in Safari through

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.336 A:middle
the WebAuthentication standard.

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.246 A:middle
I am really happy about this

00:16:31.246 --> 00:16:33.056 A:middle
support, especially because I

00:16:33.056 --> 00:16:34.096 A:middle
know that a number of you have

00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:35.586 A:middle
been asking for it.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
Depending on who or what you're

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.126 A:middle
protecting and the threat models

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.986 A:middle
that you're concerned about, you

00:16:42.986 --> 00:16:45.066 A:middle
might consider tying user

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:47.126 A:middle
authentication to the physical

00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:48.046 A:middle
presence of some kind of

00:16:48.046 --> 00:16:49.566 A:middle
hardware device.

00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:54.346 A:middle
Safari 13 supports USB-based

00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:57.246 A:middle
FIDO2-compliant devices with the

00:16:57.246 --> 00:16:58.436 A:middle
WebAuthentication standard.

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.656 A:middle
It's available as an

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.656 A:middle
It's available as an

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:05.185 A:middle
experimental feature in Seed 1

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.626 A:middle
of macOS Catalina, and it'll be

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.236 A:middle
on by default in Seed 2.

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:11.786 A:middle
You can also try it out right

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
now if you download Safari

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.356 A:middle
Technology Preview.

00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:17.816 A:middle
If you're interested in

00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:19.976 A:middle
supporting USB security keys,

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.445 A:middle
it's really important to offer a

00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:24.236 A:middle
great account recovery story,

00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:26.935 A:middle
just in case your user's key

00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:29.816 A:middle
gets lost, stolen, or broken.

00:17:31.276 --> 00:17:33.196 A:middle
And designing account recovery

00:17:33.336 --> 00:17:35.316 A:middle
systems when a hardware token is

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:37.996 A:middle
involved is really important,

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:38.706 A:middle
but it's not always

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:39.336 A:middle
straightforward.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:42.286 A:middle
So unless you are already in

00:17:42.286 --> 00:17:44.246 A:middle
this business or were seriously

00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:46.106 A:middle
considering getting into it,

00:17:46.856 --> 00:17:48.546 A:middle
it's more likely that one or

00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:50.076 A:middle
more of the other areas that I

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:51.816 A:middle
cover today will be more

00:17:51.816 --> 00:17:53.956 A:middle
relevant for your users, your

00:17:53.956 --> 00:17:54.976 A:middle
apps, and your websites.

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:01.866 A:middle
If you develop an app with user

00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:04.386 A:middle
accounts, I have three takeaways

00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:05.286 A:middle
from what we've talked about

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:05.506 A:middle
today.

00:18:06.936 --> 00:18:09.326 A:middle
First, strongly consider

00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:11.036 A:middle
adopting Sign In with Apple.

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:13.946 A:middle
For your users, the best

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:15.736 A:middle
password is no password,

00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:17.896 A:middle
especially when it's backed by

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.666 A:middle
two-factor authentication and

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.000 A:middle
great biometrics.

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:25.126 A:middle
Two, make signing into your app

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.086 A:middle
a one-tap experience using the

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:29.676 A:middle
Authentication Services

00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:30.286 A:middle
framework.

00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:32.406 A:middle
Users don't even need to see a

00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:34.266 A:middle
keyboard anymore to get signed

00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:34.796 A:middle
in.

00:18:35.476 --> 00:18:37.446 A:middle
And finally, implement the

00:18:37.446 --> 00:18:39.036 A:middle
well-known URL for changing

00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:39.686 A:middle
passwords.

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:42.076 A:middle
It's really easy to do, takes

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:44.056 A:middle
just a moment, and it makes a

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.146 A:middle
huge difference when Safari is

00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:47.586 A:middle
going to try to help your users

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:48.906 A:middle
upgrade their passwords.

00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.686 A:middle
You'll find more information

00:18:52.686 --> 00:18:54.106 A:middle
about what I covered today and

00:18:54.196 --> 00:18:57.136 A:middle
more in the WWDC app or on the

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:57.356 A:middle
web.

00:18:58.406 --> 00:18:59.796 A:middle
And that is it for me.

00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:01.066 A:middle
Thank you all so much.

00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:01.066 A:middle
Thank you all so much.

00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:02.556 A:middle
I really hope you've been having

00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:04.186 A:middle
a wonderful WWDC.

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:07.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
