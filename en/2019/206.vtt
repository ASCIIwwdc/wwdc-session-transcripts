[ Applause and Cheers ]

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:14.806 A:middle
Let's do this.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.636 A:middle
Hi, I'm Paolo, and later on,

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.256 A:middle
I'll be joined by my colleague,

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:21.346 A:middle
Tom here on stage.

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:23.636 A:middle
And we are here today to

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:27.476 A:middle
introduce you to SF symbols.

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:28.886 A:middle
Symbols play a very important

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:30.296 A:middle
role in interfaces.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:31.966 A:middle
They are effective at

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.136 A:middle
communicating meaning.

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:35.866 A:middle
They can indicate which items

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.556 A:middle
you have selected.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.216 A:middle
They can be used to visually

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:40.476 A:middle
differentiate one type of

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:42.266 A:middle
content from another, and

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:44.496 A:middle
symbols appears in -- appear in

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:45.576 A:middle
various contexts throughout the

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:45.826 A:middle
system.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:52.396 A:middle
This creates a sense of

00:00:52.396 --> 00:00:55.046 A:middle
familiarity throughout the user

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:55.576 A:middle
interface.

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:57.866 A:middle
Symbols are used in a variety of

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.966 A:middle
ways, and designing symbols

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.916 A:middle
comes with an inherent

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.916 A:middle
comes with an inherent

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.936 A:middle
challenge, which is pairing them

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:06.696 A:middle
nicely with the other essential

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:08.686 A:middle
element of any UI, which is

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:09.726 A:middle
text.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.286 A:middle
Text is used in a variety of

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:13.326 A:middle
point sizes in the UI, and so

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:14.976 A:middle
are symbols.

00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:21.876 A:middle
We use symbols a lot, and so do

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:22.206 A:middle
you.

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:24.976 A:middle
We want to make your job easier.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:30.116 A:middle
Now in iOS 13, we redesigned all

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:30.736 A:middle
our symbols.

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.186 A:middle
You'll notice how the symbols

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.906 A:middle
have a rounder look, and how

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:36.676 A:middle
generally they are a bit heavier

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:38.436 A:middle
in weight, making them more

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:38.716 A:middle
visible.

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:40.996 A:middle
They're also designed to

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.296 A:middle
perfectly match and align with

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:43.966 A:middle
text.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.206 A:middle
And while we took great care in

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:51.136 A:middle
redesigning all the symbols in

00:01:51.136 --> 00:01:52.566 A:middle
the system that you may already

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.796 A:middle
be familiar with, we are

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:56.586 A:middle
thrilled to announce that we've

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.606 A:middle
extended this list, and designed

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:03.166 A:middle
many more, which we call SF

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:03.166 A:middle
many more, which we call SF

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:03.806 A:middle
symbols.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:07.206 A:middle
They are a platform-consistent,

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.816 A:middle
high-quality set designed by

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:11.766 A:middle
Apple for you to use in your

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:12.836 A:middle
apps.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.456 A:middle
They come in vector form, which

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:19.506 A:middle
means they are scalable, and

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.236 A:middle
will render great at small and

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:22.956 A:middle
large point sizes.

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:27.926 A:middle
They come in weights that match

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:29.776 A:middle
our family of system fonts, San

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:33.266 A:middle
Francisco -- all the weights.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:42.396 A:middle
And there's over 1,000 to choose

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:42.706 A:middle
from.

00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:46.066 A:middle
If these are still not enough,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.706 A:middle
you can even customize them and

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:49.596 A:middle
create your own.

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:52.426 A:middle
Let's look at them in more

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:52.806 A:middle
detail.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:55.136 A:middle
They're designed to work with

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:55.596 A:middle
text.

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.776 A:middle
They're specified in typographic

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.106 A:middle
points, like text.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.106 A:middle
points, like text.

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:03.806 A:middle
When symbols appear next to

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:05.636 A:middle
text, they all sit nicely on the

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:06.586 A:middle
same baseline.

00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:10.416 A:middle
When symbols and text are

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:12.366 A:middle
positioned vertically, there are

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.726 A:middle
two most common cases -- whether

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:17.216 A:middle
the text supports the symbol, or

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
the symbol supports the text.

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:23.136 A:middle
Horizontal alignment ensures

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.086 A:middle
that everything looks great, and

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:28.686 A:middle
this is possible thanks to their

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:29.316 A:middle
margins,

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:32.676 A:middle
which are not necessarily the

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.586 A:middle
same, as you can see in the

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:37.326 A:middle
bottom-right blue rectangle.

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:40.906 A:middle
Margins are invisible, but

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:42.266 A:middle
they're always considered when

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
laying out elements on the

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:44.026 A:middle
screen.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:47.266 A:middle
Let's look at weights.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.336 A:middle
SF symbols have been carefully

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:52.886 A:middle
drawn to look great at different

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:54.686 A:middle
weights, from ultra-light to

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.336 A:middle
black, just like our system

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:56.656 A:middle
fonts.

00:03:57.846 --> 00:03:59.346 A:middle
Every weight has been drawn

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
manually, and special

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
manually, and special

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:02.256 A:middle
consideration went into each

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:02.696 A:middle
design.

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:04.456 A:middle
Thinner weights have a

00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:06.206 A:middle
distinctive, beautiful elegance,

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.876 A:middle
while the heavier ones strive to

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:11.716 A:middle
maintain detail and visibility.

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:16.836 A:middle
There is a need for using

00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:19.356 A:middle
symbols at different sizes when

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:21.456 A:middle
they are next to text, even if

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.976 A:middle
the text size doesn't change.

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
This is something that many of

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:29.386 A:middle
us already do, depending on the

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:31.406 A:middle
amount of emphasis that the

00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:33.856 A:middle
symbol may need, and how much

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:34.886 A:middle
space is available.

00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:38.386 A:middle
So with iOS 13, we turned this

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.286 A:middle
into a system.

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:44.156 A:middle
We call these scales -- small,

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.186 A:middle
medium, and large.

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:49.806 A:middle
It's important to notice here

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.216 A:middle
that the point size of the

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:52.446 A:middle
symbol is still the same.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.026 A:middle
It's just the scale that

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:54.436 A:middle
changes.

00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:56.966 A:middle
Each scale remains

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.336 A:middle
weight-matched with the text,

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.476 A:middle
and, mind you, it's not just

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.476 A:middle
and, mind you, it's not just

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:02.906 A:middle
linearly-scaled, the stroke

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
thickness is adjusted to the

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:07.066 A:middle
weight of the text, and the

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.896 A:middle
other great benefit is that

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:10.746 A:middle
using scales means that

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:13.346 A:middle
automatically they're optically

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.056 A:middle
vertically-centered to the cap

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:15.436 A:middle
height.

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.736 A:middle
This way, vertical layout

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.386 A:middle
between symbols and text is

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:25.106 A:middle
automatic for all three scales.

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:28.986 A:middle
So where are these scales used,

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:30.346 A:middle
and when should you use a

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:31.176 A:middle
particular scale?

00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:33.716 A:middle
Well, here are 3 UI examples.

00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:37.896 A:middle
They all use 17-point text, but

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:40.326 A:middle
the container for each of these

00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:43.466 A:middle
symbols have different heights.

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.606 A:middle
So the text is the same size in

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:49.206 A:middle
all 3, and the symbols are as

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:51.276 A:middle
well, but the symbols use a

00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:53.376 A:middle
different scale in order to best

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:54.206 A:middle
fit their space.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:58.136 A:middle
And in some places, like

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
toolbars, your kit will do the

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
toolbars, your kit will do the

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:01.716 A:middle
right thing, and will pick the

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.146 A:middle
correct scale for the control

00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:03.976 A:middle
automatically.

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:09.376 A:middle
So when we put all this together

00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:11.746 A:middle
-- resizing, scaling, and weight

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.506 A:middle
-- it means you can use them

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.586 A:middle
with dynamic type, and

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.056 A:middle
everything just works.

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:20.346 A:middle
And of course, symbols can be

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.126 A:middle
localized, too.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.006 A:middle
Here's an example of the Voice

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:25.206 A:middle
Memos app, running in English,

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:28.166 A:middle
and running in Arabic.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.136 A:middle
Notice how the time control

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:31.846 A:middle
reflect the numeral system of

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:32.676 A:middle
the locale.

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:36.296 A:middle
If you're wondering how to make

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
sense of all these symbols,

00:06:37.986 --> 00:06:39.496 A:middle
well, each symbol has a unique

00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:39.836 A:middle
name,

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:44.806 A:middle
and most symbols come in

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:47.546 A:middle
variants that can be outlined or

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:47.846 A:middle
filled.

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:52.126 A:middle
They can be enclosed in a circle

00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:55.556 A:middle
or a square, and may come with a

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:56.976 A:middle
standardized system of badges.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.626 A:middle
And we made it convenient for

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:02.726 A:middle
you to use these symbols.

00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:06.006 A:middle
First, they are included in the

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:07.366 A:middle
San Francisco fonts available

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:08.766 A:middle
for download, so you can use

00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
them in your design prompts.

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:12.446 A:middle
The scales are accessible by

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:13.626 A:middle
open Type Features.

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:16.246 A:middle
The default scale is medium, and

00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:17.796 A:middle
small and large can be selected

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:20.156 A:middle
through the Typography panel, or

00:07:20.686 --> 00:07:22.386 A:middle
application-specific UI.

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:25.436 A:middle
And as a reminder, these fonts

00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:27.006 A:middle
are for design only, not for

00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:27.556 A:middle
deployment.

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:31.296 A:middle
So how do you use these symbols?

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.196 A:middle
How do you access them and get

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:34.076 A:middle
them into your designs?

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:37.356 A:middle
Well, to help you with that, we

00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:39.536 A:middle
created a new app, which is

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:42.116 A:middle
called SF Symbols, and this is

00:07:42.116 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
what it looks like.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:45.396 A:middle
It will let you browse symbols,

00:07:45.396 --> 00:07:48.906 A:middle
either in a collection view or

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:49.946 A:middle
in a table view.

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:52.696 A:middle
It will let you search them by

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:56.476 A:middle
name, and preview them in

00:07:56.916 --> 00:07:59.346 A:middle
different weights that the fonts

00:07:59.346 --> 00:07:59.686 A:middle
come in.

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:05.706 A:middle
You can download the SF Symbols

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:07.136 A:middle
app with the new fonts from

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:10.126 A:middle
developer.apple.com/design, and

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:12.826 A:middle
speaking of design, design

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.446 A:middle
resources -- the new design

00:08:14.446 --> 00:08:17.416 A:middle
resources on developer.apple.com

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.516 A:middle
also use symbols.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.366 A:middle
They reference them by name, and

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:27.406 A:middle
some of the system icons are now

00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.186 A:middle
symbols, too.

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.616 A:middle
So if you were using some of

00:08:29.616 --> 00:08:31.476 A:middle
these, they will automatically

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:32.716 A:middle
use the new designs.

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:37.035 A:middle
Now that we've seen how to

00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:38.246 A:middle
discover the symbols available

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.676 A:middle
to you, let's look at a real

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:40.236 A:middle
example.

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:43.926 A:middle
Here's a spec that you might

00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:45.016 A:middle
have put together for your app.

00:08:46.476 --> 00:08:47.966 A:middle
You can see how before maybe you

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
had to do something like this --

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:52.166 A:middle
specify your images, the

00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:54.756 A:middle
rectangular bounds, and explicit

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:57.986 A:middle
pad and insets, and now, symbols

00:08:58.076 --> 00:08:59.536 A:middle
greatly simplify the paradigm.

00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:01.696 A:middle
You just have to specify a name,

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:03.136 A:middle
its point size, and alignment,

00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:06.416 A:middle
maybe its weight and scale if

00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:06.956 A:middle
appropriate.

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:11.006 A:middle
So I'm working on this app with

00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:13.076 A:middle
Tom, and here the symbol in the

00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:14.536 A:middle
second row is a bit too generic.

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:16.606 A:middle
It's a list of beverages, so I

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:17.706 A:middle
want to replace it with

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:18.686 A:middle
something more appropriate,

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:20.106 A:middle
something that conveys that

00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:21.516 A:middle
these are tasty, hot beverages.

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:23.966 A:middle
So I think I'm going to change

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:25.586 A:middle
it, and I want to go for a

00:09:26.286 --> 00:09:27.306 A:middle
teacup.

00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:30.206 A:middle
That teacup looks great.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.776 A:middle
I'm sure Tom will love it, but

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:34.866 A:middle
it's not included in the set of

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.836 A:middle
symbols that we provide.

00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:39.986 A:middle
Well, the SF Symbols app lets

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:41.686 A:middle
you customize and create your

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:42.286 A:middle
own symbols.

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:45.596 A:middle
In order for you to do that, you

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:47.096 A:middle
need to start by exporting the

00:09:47.096 --> 00:09:50.236 A:middle
symbol from the app, and symbols

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:52.106 A:middle
can be exported through their

00:09:52.106 --> 00:09:52.586 A:middle
template.

00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:56.136 A:middle
This is what a template looks

00:09:56.136 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
like.

00:09:57.516 --> 00:09:59.056 A:middle
It has all the weights, and all

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
the scales for the symbol.

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
the scales for the symbol.

00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:04.766 A:middle
The template is in SVG format,

00:10:05.636 --> 00:10:07.416 A:middle
which means it can be edited by

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.506 A:middle
most design tools.

00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:12.776 A:middle
It's specially constructed to be

00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:14.366 A:middle
navigable and usable through any

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:17.476 A:middle
of the design stage, and the

00:10:17.696 --> 00:10:19.856 A:middle
very same template is also

00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:21.886 A:middle
directly used by Xcode as a

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:22.936 A:middle
source artifact.

00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:25.316 A:middle
No more tens of hundreds of

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:26.496 A:middle
files floating around.

00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:29.156 A:middle
So let's look at how we did our

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:29.586 A:middle
teacup.

00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:32.926 A:middle
First, we went to the SF Symbols

00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:34.806 A:middle
app, and we looked for a good

00:10:34.806 --> 00:10:35.606 A:middle
starting point.

00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:37.806 A:middle
Our teacup is enclosed in a

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.336 A:middle
circle, so I think the circle is

00:10:39.336 --> 00:10:40.346 A:middle
a great starting point.

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:42.826 A:middle
And so, I searched for circle,

00:10:43.306 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
and it's there.

00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:46.706 A:middle
So I can select it and export

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.176 A:middle
its template from the File menu.

00:10:48.786 --> 00:10:52.506 A:middle
I can save it, and now it's

00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:53.496 A:middle
ready to be customized.

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:56.726 A:middle
I can open it in my editor and

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:59.716 A:middle
notice here how the layers have

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:00.536 A:middle
unique names.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:00.536 A:middle
unique names.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:02.576 A:middle
These names are important.

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.516 A:middle
They help identify each

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:05.736 A:middle
individual configuration of the

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:06.946 A:middle
symbol, the weight, and their

00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:09.026 A:middle
scale, so you've got to be

00:11:09.026 --> 00:11:10.386 A:middle
careful when you're drawing to

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:12.366 A:middle
make sure that your outlines are

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:14.016 A:middle
actually inside the appropriate

00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:14.416 A:middle
layer.

00:11:14.416 --> 00:11:17.256 A:middle
So I start my customization

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:19.676 A:middle
work, and I put my teacup inside

00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:21.426 A:middle
the regular at the medium scale.

00:11:22.246 --> 00:11:24.156 A:middle
I make sure that it's centered,

00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:27.756 A:middle
and optically balanced, and then

00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:30.526 A:middle
I scale it down, just for stroke

00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:33.676 A:middle
thicknesses, and I put it in the

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:34.966 A:middle
small regular scale.

00:11:35.016 --> 00:11:37.166 A:middle
And then I repeat the process,

00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:39.076 A:middle
and I scale it up just for

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:40.826 A:middle
thickness, center it, make sure

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:43.006 A:middle
it's looking good for a large

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:45.046 A:middle
regular scale, and so forth

00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:47.216 A:middle
until the template is complete.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.466 A:middle
At this point, I'm ready to

00:11:50.466 --> 00:11:53.246 A:middle
export the SVG from the design

00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:54.366 A:middle
tool.

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:56.166 A:middle
I can hand it off to Tom, and

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:57.836 A:middle
I'm sure he'll take great care

00:11:58.346 --> 00:11:59.356 A:middle
of it.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.186 A:middle
In fact, he doesn't have to do

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.186 A:middle
In fact, he doesn't have to do

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
much.

00:12:01.836 --> 00:12:03.546 A:middle
It's ready to be dropped in

00:12:03.546 --> 00:12:04.456 A:middle
Xcode as-is.

00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:12.056 A:middle
So if you want -- don't want to

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:14.086 A:middle
provide all the weights for your

00:12:14.086 --> 00:12:16.536 A:middle
symbol, you have to provide

00:12:16.656 --> 00:12:18.716 A:middle
regular at medium scale at

00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:22.026 A:middle
least, then the scales for

00:12:22.026 --> 00:12:22.526 A:middle
regular.

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:26.046 A:middle
Then same bold for the bold text

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:28.986 A:middle
feature, and if you want to

00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:30.586 A:middle
support all dynamic-type styles,

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:33.346 A:middle
then include medium and bold as

00:12:34.716 --> 00:12:34.836 A:middle
well.

00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:36.846 A:middle
Of course, you should take into

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:38.376 A:middle
consideration the typographic

00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:39.166 A:middle
palette of your app.

00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:41.856 A:middle
You may need thinner or heavier

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:42.156 A:middle
weights.

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
So to recap, we got to know a

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:49.116 A:middle
new library of symbols that

00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:50.016 A:middle
match San Francisco.

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.806 A:middle
They are vector-based and come

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.316 A:middle
in different weights and scales.

00:12:56.506 --> 00:12:58.366 A:middle
You can browse them through the

00:12:58.366 --> 00:12:59.106 A:middle
SF Symbols app.

00:13:00.626 --> 00:13:01.966 A:middle
We saw how to use them in your

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:03.806 A:middle
specs, referenced them by name,

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:05.056 A:middle
and how to specify their

00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:07.796 A:middle
positioning, and finally, you

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:09.606 A:middle
can customize symbols using the

00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:11.546 A:middle
SVG template exported from the

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:12.076 A:middle
SF Symbols app.

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:15.376 A:middle
Now, I'd like to invite Tom to

00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:16.826 A:middle
the stage, so he can tell you

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.206 A:middle
all about how to use these

00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:18.886 A:middle
symbols in code.

00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:21.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:22.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paolo.

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:26.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:28.856 A:middle
Well, I'm really excited, and

00:13:28.986 --> 00:13:30.396 A:middle
the first thing I would want to

00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:32.736 A:middle
do is see if I can use one of

00:13:32.736 --> 00:13:34.226 A:middle
these symbols in my own apps.

00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:36.386 A:middle
And I have this simple slideshow

00:13:36.386 --> 00:13:38.596 A:middle
app, and it has some UI that

00:13:38.706 --> 00:13:39.956 A:middle
allows you to change the speed.

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:42.236 A:middle
But I'm really not very happy

00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:43.296 A:middle
with these images.

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.276 A:middle
They're very basic, so let's see

00:13:45.436 --> 00:13:46.526 A:middle
-- they're a good candidate for

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:48.136 A:middle
changing, and let's see what it

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:50.616 A:middle
does if we have a symbol in the

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:51.136 A:middle
Symbols app.

00:13:51.136 --> 00:13:53.856 A:middle
So let's fire up SF Symbols, and

00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:55.506 A:middle
search for tortoise, because

00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:58.056 A:middle
maybe we can use the classic

00:13:58.056 --> 00:13:59.006 A:middle
[inaudible] style tortoise and

00:13:59.006 --> 00:13:59.226 A:middle
hare.

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:01.686 A:middle
Turns out, there is one, so I

00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:02.266 A:middle
can use this.

00:14:02.266 --> 00:14:02.746 A:middle
That's great.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:05.056 A:middle
And the hare is there, too.

00:14:05.316 --> 00:14:07.576 A:middle
Perfect. Now, how do I use them?

00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:08.686 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:10.316 A:middle
We're introducing new API called

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.266 A:middle
UIImage(systemName that works

00:14:12.316 --> 00:14:14.406 A:middle
very similar to the existing

00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:15.376 A:middle
APIs.

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:18.016 A:middle
You just pass in the name you

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:19.376 A:middle
copy from the SF Symbols app,

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:20.546 A:middle
and that's it.

00:14:20.546 --> 00:14:22.706 A:middle
If we build and run -- wow, bam,

00:14:23.516 --> 00:14:25.526 A:middle
that looks amazing, and it was

00:14:25.886 --> 00:14:26.896 A:middle
just two lines of code.

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:30.426 A:middle
Perfect. Now, Paolo sent me a

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.496 A:middle
spec, because we're working

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.106 A:middle
together on this app, and he

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
really has to stop putting hot

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:35.616 A:middle
Belgian chocolate there, because

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:36.726 A:middle
now I really feel like hot

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:37.436 A:middle
Belgian chocolate.

00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:40.316 A:middle
But he gave me this spec, and it

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.326 A:middle
looks very different than the

00:14:41.326 --> 00:14:43.846 A:middle
one that I got before.

00:14:43.846 --> 00:14:44.656 A:middle
It's -- there's less

00:14:44.656 --> 00:14:45.206 A:middle
information.

00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:45.706 A:middle
I like that.

00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:47.356 A:middle
That's less work for me, but

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:49.816 A:middle
let's focus on this image,

00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:50.926 A:middle
because there's a new teacup

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:51.896 A:middle
there.

00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
He also gave me a file,

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:55.946 A:middle
teacup.svg file that I need to

00:14:55.946 --> 00:14:57.446 A:middle
import into my asset catalog.

00:14:57.446 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
Well, it's definitely a teacup.

00:14:57.446 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
Well, it's definitely a teacup.

00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:01.426 A:middle
There's a lot of them.

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:02.686 A:middle
He really put some effort into

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:04.226 A:middle
it, and that's what I like about

00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:04.676 A:middle
Paolo.

00:15:04.746 --> 00:15:06.336 A:middle
He has, like, great attention to

00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:06.816 A:middle
detail.

00:15:09.056 --> 00:15:10.516 A:middle
So now, my image is there, and I

00:15:10.516 --> 00:15:12.366 A:middle
can just use UIImage(named to

00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:13.226 A:middle
get to my teacup.

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
If we run this, I get this.

00:15:15.606 --> 00:15:17.256 A:middle
This is a real nice and sharp

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:18.916 A:middle
teacup, exactly what I wanted,

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:21.146 A:middle
but I'm not sure if you have

00:15:21.146 --> 00:15:22.386 A:middle
noticed, when I imported the

00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:26.106 A:middle
file, there are now two teacups

00:15:26.106 --> 00:15:27.146 A:middle
in my asset catalog.

00:15:27.476 --> 00:15:29.516 A:middle
It turns out you can now have

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:31.256 A:middle
two images with the same name,

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.946 A:middle
but they are -- have a different

00:15:33.156 --> 00:15:33.386 A:middle
type.

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:35.686 A:middle
So let's step back for a moment

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:36.976 A:middle
and explain what's happening.

00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:37.986 A:middle
We're going to use envelope,

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:39.336 A:middle
because the teacup is not a good

00:15:39.336 --> 00:15:39.776 A:middle
example.

00:15:41.276 --> 00:15:43.106 A:middle
Up until now, UIImage(named was

00:15:43.396 --> 00:15:44.246 A:middle
pretty straightforward.

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
You have an image in your asset

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.216 A:middle
catalog, and you can get it out

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:47.876 A:middle
using the API.

00:15:48.996 --> 00:15:50.266 A:middle
Now, with symbols, it becomes

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:51.106 A:middle
more complicated.

00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.676 A:middle
You can actually have an image

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:54.856 A:middle
with the same name, and there

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.196 A:middle
might be three versions of it.

00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:57.916 A:middle
You might have a system symbol

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:58.566 A:middle
with this name.

00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.126 A:middle
You might have a custom symbol

00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.126 A:middle
You might have a custom symbol

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.386 A:middle
with the name, and your old

00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
non-symbol image might still be

00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
there.

00:16:05.326 --> 00:16:07.556 A:middle
For system images, there's no

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:07.936 A:middle
problem.

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.136 A:middle
They're in a separate name

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:10.926 A:middle
space, because there's a

00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:12.076 A:middle
separate API for them.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:13.236 A:middle
And so they are -- there's no

00:16:13.236 --> 00:16:13.876 A:middle
conflict there.

00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:15.966 A:middle
It also means you can never get

00:16:15.966 --> 00:16:17.546 A:middle
a custom symbol using this API,

00:16:17.546 --> 00:16:19.446 A:middle
and you can never get a system

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:21.566 A:middle
symbol using the UIImage(named

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:21.796 A:middle
API.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.096 A:middle
They are totally separate.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.996 A:middle
For custom symbols, it's a

00:16:25.996 --> 00:16:28.676 A:middle
little bit different.

00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:30.526 A:middle
We prioritize things now, so

00:16:30.526 --> 00:16:32.376 A:middle
we'll first look for a symbol

00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:32.796 A:middle
image.

00:16:32.896 --> 00:16:34.126 A:middle
And if we can find one, we will

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.806 A:middle
return that, and otherwise,

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:37.006 A:middle
we'll look for a non-symbol

00:16:37.006 --> 00:16:38.286 A:middle
image, and then you get that

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:38.486 A:middle
back.

00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:39.906 A:middle
Now, you might say, "Well,

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.126 A:middle
that's really annoying, because

00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:42.616 A:middle
what if I want both?"

00:16:43.056 --> 00:16:44.066 A:middle
But there's a good story for

00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:44.366 A:middle
this.

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:48.006 A:middle
With the same line of code, I

00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:50.256 A:middle
can run my app on iOS 12 or

00:16:50.256 --> 00:16:51.546 A:middle
earlier, and I get the old

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:53.916 A:middle
image, the bitmap image in this

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
case.

00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:57.656 A:middle
And if I run my app on iOS 13 or

00:16:57.656 --> 00:16:59.046 A:middle
later, I get the symbol image.

00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
So I don't have to write any

00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
So I don't have to write any

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:01.986 A:middle
version-checking code to get a

00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:02.986 A:middle
different image for the

00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:03.696 A:middle
different OSs.

00:17:04.366 --> 00:17:06.816 A:middle
Just provide 2 images with the

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.496 A:middle
same name, and it works out of

00:17:08.496 --> 00:17:08.915 A:middle
the box.

00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:11.945 A:middle
If you do want to use the old

00:17:11.945 --> 00:17:13.665 A:middle
image on iOS 13 or later, you

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.665 A:middle
have to duplicate or rename it.

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.925 A:middle
So let's -- going back to our

00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:23.236 A:middle
slides, and one other thing that

00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.695 A:middle
we have is the configuration on

00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:26.356 A:middle
this teacup.

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:27.816 A:middle
It should be large.

00:17:28.836 --> 00:17:29.536 A:middle
How do we do this?

00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:31.646 A:middle
We create a new type that we

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:33.286 A:middle
introduced, SymbolConfiguration,

00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:35.376 A:middle
and we create one with a large

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:35.726 A:middle
scale.

00:17:36.376 --> 00:17:38.536 A:middle
The other configuration

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:39.496 A:middle
properties that are on the

00:17:39.496 --> 00:17:41.326 A:middle
object are unspecified.

00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:42.836 A:middle
We only have a large scale here,

00:17:42.836 --> 00:17:44.356 A:middle
and then we can use the

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.136 A:middle
imageView to display our image.

00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:47.336 A:middle
There's a new property on

00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:48.286 A:middle
UIImageView called

00:17:48.416 --> 00:17:49.866 A:middle
preferredSymbolConfiguration

00:17:50.426 --> 00:17:51.556 A:middle
that will tell the imageView to

00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:53.246 A:middle
use this configuration to render

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:54.446 A:middle
a symbol image.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:56.256 A:middle
It will have no effect on

00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.296 A:middle
non-symbol images.

00:17:57.836 --> 00:18:01.266 A:middle
If we run this, what a

00:17:57.836 --> 00:18:01.266 A:middle
If we run this, what a

00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:02.946 A:middle
difference a scale makes.

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:07.736 A:middle
Now, you can also use this

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:11.436 A:middle
configuration to change the size

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:12.056 A:middle
of a symbol.

00:18:12.516 --> 00:18:14.206 A:middle
You specify a point size, and

00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:15.776 A:middle
optionally, a weight or a scale.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:19.356 A:middle
Now, an important point here is

00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:22.056 A:middle
that symbol point sizes are not

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
screen point sizes.

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.686 A:middle
Symbol point sizes are expressed

00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:27.916 A:middle
as font point sizes.

00:18:27.916 --> 00:18:29.336 A:middle
They're typographical in nature.

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:31.446 A:middle
The screen point sizes describe

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:32.736 A:middle
the dimension of the image, the

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:35.966 A:middle
width and the height.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.636 A:middle
Now, a picture says 1,000 words,

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:39.626 A:middle
so let's see that and visualize

00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:39.916 A:middle
this.

00:18:39.916 --> 00:18:41.396 A:middle
Like, we have this -- our circle

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.646 A:middle
symbol next to the "Favorite"

00:18:42.646 --> 00:18:44.156 A:middle
text, and they are both

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:45.996 A:middle
specified using the system font

00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:47.196 A:middle
at 28 points.

00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:49.396 A:middle
Now, you might expect this image

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:51.256 A:middle
to be 28 x 28 points.

00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:53.226 A:middle
Well, it turns out, it isn't,

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:54.806 A:middle
and these values are the actual

00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:56.366 A:middle
correct values for this symbol

00:18:56.366 --> 00:18:57.376 A:middle
at this configuration.

00:18:57.646 --> 00:18:59.156 A:middle
And the image is not even

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:03.186 A:middle
square, and it's a circle.

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:03.186 A:middle
square, and it's a circle.

00:19:03.336 --> 00:19:04.806 A:middle
So for symbols, you have to let

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:07.376 A:middle
go of describing the image using

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:07.936 A:middle
a dimension.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:10.016 A:middle
You have to use the symbol

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.396 A:middle
points, and you can think of it

00:19:11.396 --> 00:19:12.356 A:middle
as a piece of text.

00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:13.326 A:middle
Because if you have a piece of

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.026 A:middle
text, you describe it using the

00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:16.966 A:middle
font point size, and not using

00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:17.646 A:middle
its dimensions.

00:19:18.276 --> 00:19:22.216 A:middle
It's the same.

00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:23.616 A:middle
Another way to configure a

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:25.296 A:middle
symbol is using a text style,

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:27.536 A:middle
and that means that the symbol

00:19:27.536 --> 00:19:28.836 A:middle
will behave according to the

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:30.096 A:middle
dynamic text style rules.

00:19:30.096 --> 00:19:31.486 A:middle
It will behave the same as a

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:32.936 A:middle
piece of text with the text

00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:33.206 A:middle
style.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.816 A:middle
So it matches great with text

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:36.676 A:middle
styles.

00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:39.596 A:middle
And imageView will automatically

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.646 A:middle
change the size of the image,

00:19:41.646 --> 00:19:43.646 A:middle
and look up the right size at

00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:45.026 A:middle
run time, depending on the

00:19:45.066 --> 00:19:46.366 A:middle
preferred content size category

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:46.946 A:middle
of the app.

00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:50.506 A:middle
You can see this in practice.

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:52.236 A:middle
Like, the text is nice and

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:53.746 A:middle
large, and the symbols scaled

00:19:53.806 --> 00:19:54.326 A:middle
accordingly.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:55.846 A:middle
And they have the nice -- the

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:56.306 A:middle
same weight.

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
So images can change size

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
So images can change size

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:01.756 A:middle
dynamically, and we have to talk

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:02.896 A:middle
about this, because you usually

00:20:02.896 --> 00:20:04.706 A:middle
want to constrain an image by

00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:05.256 A:middle
width and height.

00:20:06.186 --> 00:20:08.826 A:middle
And since a symbol renders

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:11.106 A:middle
always -- it's a vector.

00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:13.706 A:middle
You could be inclined to always

00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:14.816 A:middle
specify this width and height,

00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.046 A:middle
but it's actually not a good

00:20:16.046 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
idea.

00:20:17.056 --> 00:20:18.586 A:middle
First of all, it's not really

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:18.876 A:middle
correct.

00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:21.126 A:middle
You can see on the screenshot

00:20:21.126 --> 00:20:23.046 A:middle
that the symbol is described as

00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:24.776 A:middle
a 17-point symbol, which is

00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:27.456 A:middle
really small, but it still

00:20:27.456 --> 00:20:28.996 A:middle
renders as a very large image,

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:30.806 A:middle
because the width and height are

00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:31.046 A:middle
there.

00:20:31.806 --> 00:20:32.836 A:middle
But you can also see that it's

00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:34.496 A:middle
not entirely correctly centered.

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:35.486 A:middle
Like, it's a little bit off to

00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:36.546 A:middle
the left, and a little bit off

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.436 A:middle
to the top.

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:40.856 A:middle
And secondly, it's not

00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:41.916 A:middle
performance -- this is not the

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.776 A:middle
most performance way to display

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:44.626 A:middle
a symbol image.

00:20:45.636 --> 00:20:49.676 A:middle
So what you want to do is not

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:50.936 A:middle
constrain the symbol image at

00:20:50.936 --> 00:20:52.336 A:middle
all, and have it be its natural

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:52.696 A:middle
size.

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:57.526 A:middle
In this case, we changed the

00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:59.736 A:middle
size of the symbol to 500 points

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.756 A:middle
to match the size that we had

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.756 A:middle
to match the size that we had

00:21:00.756 --> 00:21:02.496 A:middle
before, and it looks a lot

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:04.006 A:middle
better, because it -- the

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:06.596 A:middle
centering is better than before,

00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:08.846 A:middle
and the size is more correct.

00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:11.626 A:middle
This will also be more

00:21:11.626 --> 00:21:12.296 A:middle
performance.

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:17.806 A:middle
So if you do need a fixed size,

00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:19.256 A:middle
set the point size, but

00:21:19.256 --> 00:21:21.616 A:middle
otherwise have the symbol react

00:21:21.776 --> 00:21:23.606 A:middle
to the symbol configuration,

00:21:23.606 --> 00:21:25.336 A:middle
because even a large symbol

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:26.616 A:middle
configuration or a small-scale

00:21:26.616 --> 00:21:27.756 A:middle
configuration may make a big

00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:29.446 A:middle
difference for the size of the

00:21:29.446 --> 00:21:30.096 A:middle
same symbol.

00:21:30.726 --> 00:21:35.456 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of

00:21:35.516 --> 00:21:38.426 A:middle
configurations here, and we've

00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:39.916 A:middle
established that symbols are --

00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:41.106 A:middle
Paolo mentioned before that

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.646 A:middle
symbols are really made to work

00:21:42.646 --> 00:21:44.406 A:middle
with San Francisco, our system

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.966 A:middle
font, but they work with any

00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:46.286 A:middle
font.

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.646 A:middle
So you can use this API,

00:21:49.826 --> 00:21:51.406 A:middle
SymbolConfiguration(font, to

00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:52.526 A:middle
create a configuration that

00:21:52.586 --> 00:21:53.806 A:middle
matches the font you give it,

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.056 A:middle
and it works with system fonts.

00:21:56.526 --> 00:21:58.396 A:middle
It works with dynamic type

00:21:58.396 --> 00:21:59.626 A:middle
fonts, but it also works with

00:21:59.626 --> 00:22:00.346 A:middle
custom fonts.

00:21:59.626 --> 00:22:00.346 A:middle
custom fonts.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.616 A:middle
And especially for custom fonts,

00:22:02.996 --> 00:22:04.046 A:middle
it will create a more

00:22:04.046 --> 00:22:06.716 A:middle
high-fidelity configuration than

00:22:06.716 --> 00:22:07.896 A:middle
the one you can create manually

00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:09.346 A:middle
by copying the values from the

00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:10.716 A:middle
font into your configuration.

00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:12.756 A:middle
So it's better to use this for

00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:13.926 A:middle
custom fonts.

00:22:14.326 --> 00:22:16.416 A:middle
And when you already have a

00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:17.796 A:middle
piece of text or a label that

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.266 A:middle
has a font configured, this is

00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:20.246 A:middle
an easy way to create a

00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:21.736 A:middle
configuration that matches that

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:22.726 A:middle
font.

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:27.656 A:middle
And the last thing about

00:22:27.696 --> 00:22:29.386 A:middle
configurations is that they are

00:22:29.386 --> 00:22:29.896 A:middle
immutable.

00:22:29.896 --> 00:22:30.826 A:middle
You can't change them.

00:22:30.876 --> 00:22:32.266 A:middle
So what if you do want to change

00:22:32.266 --> 00:22:32.406 A:middle
them?

00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:33.826 A:middle
Well, you have to combine them.

00:22:34.576 --> 00:22:35.346 A:middle
There's a method called

00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:37.396 A:middle
applying, and it applies the

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.866 A:middle
specified configuration to the

00:22:38.866 --> 00:22:40.656 A:middle
one that you're calling it on.

00:22:40.656 --> 00:22:42.746 A:middle
So we'll take the configuration

00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:44.416 A:middle
you're calling it on, and then

00:22:44.416 --> 00:22:46.896 A:middle
take all the specified values in

00:22:46.896 --> 00:22:47.986 A:middle
the other configuration, and

00:22:47.986 --> 00:22:50.506 A:middle
override, or set them on the

00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:51.236 A:middle
base configuration.

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.396 A:middle
And you get a new configuration

00:22:52.396 --> 00:22:54.066 A:middle
that you can use somewhere else.

00:22:54.486 --> 00:22:56.166 A:middle
But they are immutable, and the

00:22:56.196 --> 00:22:57.546 A:middle
configuration themselves won't

00:22:57.546 --> 00:22:57.976 A:middle
change.

00:23:00.096 --> 00:23:01.526 A:middle
Now, let's talk about layout.

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.756 A:middle
We have this simple comments

00:23:04.756 --> 00:23:06.676 A:middle
section in our app, and we want

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:08.476 A:middle
to expand a little bit for our

00:23:08.696 --> 00:23:11.406 A:middle
next version, and also start

00:23:11.406 --> 00:23:12.236 A:middle
using symbols here.

00:23:12.426 --> 00:23:13.446 A:middle
And we have this avatar

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:14.266 A:middle
placeholder.

00:23:14.266 --> 00:23:15.676 A:middle
I'm going to focus on just one

00:23:15.676 --> 00:23:18.086 A:middle
row, and Paolo suggested

00:23:18.206 --> 00:23:19.606 A:middle
switching to a new symbol.

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.386 A:middle
So let's try that.

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:25.696 A:middle
That looks a lot better.

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:27.396 A:middle
So normally, if you would align

00:23:27.396 --> 00:23:28.746 A:middle
images with a piece of text, you

00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:30.166 A:middle
would use center alignment --

00:23:30.856 --> 00:23:32.716 A:middle
vertical center alignment, and

00:23:32.796 --> 00:23:34.036 A:middle
in most cases, that would look

00:23:34.036 --> 00:23:35.696 A:middle
like you would expect, and it

00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:36.566 A:middle
would be the easiest.

00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:37.696 A:middle
Now, for symbols, there's

00:23:37.696 --> 00:23:39.176 A:middle
actually no difference.

00:23:39.446 --> 00:23:40.826 A:middle
You can still use vertical

00:23:40.896 --> 00:23:42.026 A:middle
center alignments, and it's

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:42.816 A:middle
actually preferred.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.466 A:middle
UIKit will actually take the

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:48.376 A:middle
typographic information in the

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:50.546 A:middle
symbol and use it to properly

00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:52.606 A:middle
visually align the symbol versus

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:53.746 A:middle
the piece of text, and that

00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:55.706 A:middle
might actually happen that the

00:23:55.706 --> 00:23:59.136 A:middle
frames of the two elements are

00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:00.096 A:middle
not matching up together.

00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:00.096 A:middle
not matching up together.

00:24:00.096 --> 00:24:01.786 A:middle
So the center is optically and

00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:05.066 A:middle
not absolute, but you don't have

00:24:05.066 --> 00:24:05.656 A:middle
to do anything.

00:24:05.816 --> 00:24:07.476 A:middle
The system does it for you.

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:11.156 A:middle
There's, of course, also cases

00:24:11.156 --> 00:24:13.436 A:middle
where labels have more than one

00:24:13.436 --> 00:24:15.516 A:middle
line, and vertical centering

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:16.496 A:middle
works great here, too.

00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:18.416 A:middle
Same for symbols, we'll still

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:19.326 A:middle
use the typographical

00:24:19.326 --> 00:24:20.836 A:middle
information to properly align

00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.746 A:middle
for the center of the label.

00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:24.996 A:middle
This is great for disclosure

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.206 A:middle
indicators, for example.

00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:29.236 A:middle
And looking back at our view,

00:24:29.936 --> 00:24:31.256 A:middle
the disclosure indicator sits at

00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:32.366 A:middle
the right place where I want it,

00:24:32.366 --> 00:24:35.196 A:middle
but I actually want that avatar

00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:36.646 A:middle
placeholder to be next to my

00:24:36.646 --> 00:24:37.226 A:middle
first line.

00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:39.806 A:middle
So let's move it.

00:24:39.806 --> 00:24:42.076 A:middle
In this case, you can use

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:44.106 A:middle
baseline alignment, and up until

00:24:44.106 --> 00:24:45.686 A:middle
now, it would be a bit hard to

00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:46.386 A:middle
make this happen.

00:24:46.756 --> 00:24:48.046 A:middle
You could do edge alignment,

00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:48.956 A:middle
because you know the text and

00:24:48.956 --> 00:24:50.686 A:middle
the label would be there, or you

00:24:50.686 --> 00:24:52.146 A:middle
could do baseline alignment, but

00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:53.716 A:middle
have to calculate offsets, so it

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:54.336 A:middle
would be weird.

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:55.746 A:middle
And in this case, for symbols,

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:58.016 A:middle
we can just baseline align, and

00:24:58.016 --> 00:24:58.976 A:middle
that's it.

00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:02.426 A:middle
Thank you.

00:25:03.516 --> 00:25:07.956 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:09.576 A:middle
And you can actually inspect

00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
this baseline because we

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:14.716 A:middle
introduced a new property on UI

00:25:14.716 --> 00:25:15.396 A:middle
Image called

00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:17.566 A:middle
baselineOffsetFromBottom, and it

00:25:17.566 --> 00:25:19.686 A:middle
expresses, like it says, the

00:25:19.686 --> 00:25:21.526 A:middle
offset to the baseline from the

00:25:21.526 --> 00:25:22.706 A:middle
bottom of the image.

00:25:23.416 --> 00:25:25.186 A:middle
And it's an optional CG float.

00:25:25.706 --> 00:25:27.236 A:middle
Why? Because not all images have

00:25:27.296 --> 00:25:27.906 A:middle
baselines.

00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:29.116 A:middle
Symbols come with one by

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.966 A:middle
default, but other images don't

00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:32.326 A:middle
have one.

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:34.356 A:middle
So you have to check if the

00:25:34.386 --> 00:25:36.356 A:middle
image has a baseline in order to

00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:37.406 A:middle
see if you can use it.

00:25:38.666 --> 00:25:39.486 A:middle
In Objective-C, there's a

00:25:39.486 --> 00:25:40.336 A:middle
separate [inaudible] for it,

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:41.456 A:middle
because they don't have

00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:42.206 A:middle
optionals.

00:25:44.826 --> 00:25:46.456 A:middle
Now, these baselines might be --

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:47.846 A:middle
have unexpected values.

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.576 A:middle
In this case, we have two symbol

00:25:49.576 --> 00:25:49.966 A:middle
images.

00:25:50.536 --> 00:25:51.356 A:middle
They're right next to a piece of

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:51.646 A:middle
text.

00:25:51.886 --> 00:25:53.056 A:middle
They have the same size, and

00:25:53.056 --> 00:25:54.286 A:middle
they share the same baseline.

00:25:54.426 --> 00:25:56.136 A:middle
But if we visualize their

00:25:56.136 --> 00:25:57.476 A:middle
bounds, you can see that the

00:25:57.476 --> 00:25:58.836 A:middle
chevron is sitting high above

00:25:58.836 --> 00:26:01.556 A:middle
the baseline, and the cloud sits

00:25:58.836 --> 00:26:01.556 A:middle
the baseline, and the cloud sits

00:26:01.556 --> 00:26:02.426 A:middle
over the baseline.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.276 A:middle
And looking at their values, you

00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:07.226 A:middle
can see that expressing the

00:26:07.226 --> 00:26:08.456 A:middle
offset from the bottom means

00:26:08.456 --> 00:26:10.046 A:middle
that going up is a positive

00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:11.726 A:middle
offset and going down is a

00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:13.266 A:middle
negative offset.

00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:16.726 A:middle
It also means that it's valid

00:26:16.726 --> 00:26:18.046 A:middle
for an image to have a baseline

00:26:18.046 --> 00:26:19.516 A:middle
that is outside of its bounds,

00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:21.036 A:middle
in this case, the chevron.

00:26:21.886 --> 00:26:23.516 A:middle
And if you have a baseline value

00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:24.636 A:middle
of zero, it doesn't mean that

00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:25.766 A:middle
you don't have a baseline.

00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:27.066 A:middle
It means that the baseline is

00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:28.266 A:middle
the same as the bottom of the

00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:28.686 A:middle
image.

00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:30.566 A:middle
It's a bit surprising, but it

00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:30.976 A:middle
works.

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:35.646 A:middle
Now, the good thing is, we also

00:26:35.646 --> 00:26:38.366 A:middle
added API to add baselines to

00:26:38.366 --> 00:26:38.876 A:middle
images.

00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:41.076 A:middle
You would use

00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:42.716 A:middle
withBaselineOffsetFromBottom,

00:26:42.716 --> 00:26:43.936 A:middle
and you would get a new image

00:26:44.006 --> 00:26:45.446 A:middle
that has a baseline configured

00:26:45.446 --> 00:26:46.886 A:middle
like you asked for.

00:26:47.146 --> 00:26:48.516 A:middle
Again, this is an offset in

00:26:48.516 --> 00:26:50.626 A:middle
screen points from the bottom of

00:26:50.626 --> 00:26:51.116 A:middle
the image.

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:53.196 A:middle
Now, the nice thing is, the

00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:54.596 A:middle
image will start behaving like a

00:26:54.666 --> 00:26:54.966 A:middle
symbol.

00:26:54.966 --> 00:26:56.036 A:middle
It's not a symbol, but will

00:26:56.036 --> 00:26:58.096 A:middle
behave like a symbol, because it

00:26:58.096 --> 00:26:59.496 A:middle
has some typographical

00:26:59.496 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
information.

00:26:59.496 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
information.

00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:02.156 A:middle
And so, you can use the same

00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:04.216 A:middle
layout for symbol images as for

00:27:04.216 --> 00:27:05.146 A:middle
regular images.

00:27:05.506 --> 00:27:06.796 A:middle
You don't have to check does

00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:07.876 A:middle
this image have a baseline?

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:09.926 A:middle
Then I use this layout, or the

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:11.456 A:middle
other way around, and this makes

00:27:11.456 --> 00:27:12.496 A:middle
that a lot easier.

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:15.216 A:middle
And looking at our example, we

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.486 A:middle
now have actual avatars, and

00:27:17.806 --> 00:27:20.176 A:middle
some rows without avatars, and

00:27:20.236 --> 00:27:21.046 A:middle
it looks much better.

00:27:21.046 --> 00:27:22.836 A:middle
And I only had to do baseline

00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:24.486 A:middle
alignment for this first line.

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.026 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:27:27.816 --> 00:27:29.516 A:middle
I also want to touch briefly on

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:30.566 A:middle
horizontal alignments.

00:27:30.696 --> 00:27:32.096 A:middle
You can see that the images are

00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:34.116 A:middle
horizontally aligned on the same

00:27:34.116 --> 00:27:36.696 A:middle
column, and you do this by

00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:38.246 A:middle
specifying an offset that you

00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:40.146 A:middle
want to align to, and then

00:27:40.196 --> 00:27:41.386 A:middle
center the images on that

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:41.696 A:middle
offset.

00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:42.786 A:middle
It's pretty easy.

00:27:43.106 --> 00:27:44.736 A:middle
And then you can go from that

00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:46.766 A:middle
offset to the text, or from the

00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:47.496 A:middle
edge to the text.

00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:49.896 A:middle
So you should actually center

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:51.796 A:middle
align, even horizontally, the

00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:53.986 A:middle
images instead of applying a

00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:55.856 A:middle
leading or a trailing constraint

00:27:55.856 --> 00:27:56.026 A:middle
there.

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
Now, let's go back to our spec.

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
Now, let's go back to our spec.

00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:04.356 A:middle
What I wanted to say is that,

00:28:04.356 --> 00:28:06.076 A:middle
like, by default, it's probably

00:28:06.076 --> 00:28:07.366 A:middle
a good idea to start with center

00:28:07.366 --> 00:28:09.126 A:middle
alignment, both horizontally and

00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:09.576 A:middle
vertically.

00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:11.356 A:middle
In most cases, that's what you

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.726 A:middle
want, and the system will handle

00:28:12.726 --> 00:28:13.506 A:middle
everything for you.

00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:14.676 A:middle
It will use typographical

00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:16.486 A:middle
information if it's available,

00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:18.166 A:middle
and otherwise, it will use the

00:28:18.166 --> 00:28:19.526 A:middle
old-style just centering.

00:28:19.726 --> 00:28:22.816 A:middle
And in this case, Paolo

00:28:22.816 --> 00:28:24.966 A:middle
specified baseline alignment,

00:28:24.966 --> 00:28:26.256 A:middle
because the second line -- the

00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:27.526 A:middle
second item has two lines.

00:28:27.576 --> 00:28:28.396 A:middle
So we'd need to use the

00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:28.966 A:middle
baseline.

00:28:29.516 --> 00:28:30.736 A:middle
Then we can fall back to

00:28:30.736 --> 00:28:32.116 A:middle
baseline alignment, but that's

00:28:32.116 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
also very easy.

00:28:33.556 --> 00:28:35.876 A:middle
And this spec also properly

00:28:35.876 --> 00:28:38.726 A:middle
specifies horizontal alignment

00:28:38.766 --> 00:28:39.506 A:middle
of the images.

00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:42.176 A:middle
It makes the spec a lot easier

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:43.206 A:middle
to read.

00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:46.826 A:middle
Now, let's go back to buttons.

00:28:47.836 --> 00:28:48.686 A:middle
Buttons -- there's a lot of

00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:49.436 A:middle
buttons in UIKit.

00:28:50.566 --> 00:28:51.776 A:middle
We have two types of buttons,

00:28:52.156 --> 00:28:53.786 A:middle
system buttons and regular

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:54.066 A:middle
buttons.

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.066 A:middle
Let's start with the system

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:55.526 A:middle
buttons.

00:28:58.186 --> 00:28:59.466 A:middle
First of all, all buttons in

00:28:59.466 --> 00:29:01.736 A:middle
UIKit come with a preset symbol

00:28:59.466 --> 00:29:01.736 A:middle
UIKit come with a preset symbol

00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:04.006 A:middle
configuration, and for system

00:29:04.006 --> 00:29:05.736 A:middle
buttons, it's body large.

00:29:06.066 --> 00:29:07.836 A:middle
That means that it reacts to

00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:09.326 A:middle
dynamic type changes, has a body

00:29:09.326 --> 00:29:11.136 A:middle
text style, and a large scale.

00:29:11.136 --> 00:29:13.886 A:middle
Now, wouldn't it be great if you

00:29:13.886 --> 00:29:15.376 A:middle
could create system buttons,

00:29:16.106 --> 00:29:17.556 A:middle
like the info button in the

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:19.086 A:middle
available Wi-Fi networks list,

00:29:19.766 --> 00:29:21.086 A:middle
but to create your own system

00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:22.366 A:middle
buttons that looked exactly the

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.426 A:middle
same, with your own symbol

00:29:23.426 --> 00:29:23.706 A:middle
image?

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.056 A:middle
Well, we thought it was a good

00:29:25.056 --> 00:29:26.736 A:middle
idea, and we added some, an

00:29:26.736 --> 00:29:28.706 A:middle
initializer on UIButton that

00:29:28.706 --> 00:29:29.856 A:middle
allows you to create a system

00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:31.586 A:middle
button with any symbol image.

00:29:31.826 --> 00:29:35.606 A:middle
And it will behave like an --

00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:36.676 A:middle
like a regular symbol image.

00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:41.466 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:41.966 --> 00:29:43.676 A:middle
Now, let's go to regular

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:44.106 A:middle
buttons.

00:29:44.256 --> 00:29:45.956 A:middle
In this case, I have a pop-over,

00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:49.796 A:middle
and they're used as actions in

00:29:49.796 --> 00:29:50.596 A:middle
this view.

00:29:50.906 --> 00:29:53.216 A:middle
And symbols really shine here.

00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:54.616 A:middle
They're really in their place.

00:29:55.886 --> 00:29:57.296 A:middle
A regular button comes with a

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:59.476 A:middle
medium-scale preset.

00:30:00.796 --> 00:30:02.586 A:middle
Now, having said -- talking

00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:03.996 A:middle
about these preset scales, what

00:30:03.996 --> 00:30:05.026 A:middle
if you want to change them?

00:30:05.026 --> 00:30:06.636 A:middle
Well, there's similar API on

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:08.716 A:middle
UIButton, as on UIImageView,

00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:08.926 A:middle
called

00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.986 A:middle
PreferredSymbolConfiguration

00:30:11.036 --> 00:30:11.546 A:middle
forState.

00:30:12.176 --> 00:30:13.596 A:middle
That works exactly like the

00:30:13.596 --> 00:30:14.986 A:middle
other content accessors on

00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:15.516 A:middle
UIButton.

00:30:15.516 --> 00:30:17.176 A:middle
You can set a configuration for

00:30:17.176 --> 00:30:18.016 A:middle
certain states.

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:19.586 A:middle
And it gives you maximum

00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:21.536 A:middle
flexibility because you can set

00:30:21.536 --> 00:30:22.366 A:middle
an image, you can set a

00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:23.526 A:middle
configuration, or you can set

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:24.866 A:middle
both, and it will work

00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:25.376 A:middle
perfectly.

00:30:26.466 --> 00:30:27.916 A:middle
Another button example is this

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:28.146 A:middle
one.

00:30:28.676 --> 00:30:30.636 A:middle
It kind of shows what we mean

00:30:30.636 --> 00:30:32.696 A:middle
with symbols and text really

00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:34.266 A:middle
shine together, but it doesn't

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:35.476 A:middle
mean that they're always close

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:35.876 A:middle
together.

00:30:36.046 --> 00:30:37.546 A:middle
These two buttons really belong

00:30:37.546 --> 00:30:39.406 A:middle
together, and they're configured

00:30:39.406 --> 00:30:41.756 A:middle
in the same way, both the left

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:42.896 A:middle
button and the right button.

00:30:43.406 --> 00:30:44.206 A:middle
The preferred symbol

00:30:44.206 --> 00:30:45.816 A:middle
configuration is matched with

00:30:45.816 --> 00:30:47.296 A:middle
the font of that right button,

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:48.416 A:middle
and the only difference between

00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:50.416 A:middle
the two is that the left one has

00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:52.196 A:middle
a symbol, and the right one has

00:30:52.196 --> 00:30:52.816 A:middle
a piece of text.

00:30:53.776 --> 00:30:54.866 A:middle
And you can see that they share

00:30:54.866 --> 00:30:57.496 A:middle
the same baseline, and because

00:30:57.496 --> 00:30:58.686 A:middle
their configuration is exactly

00:30:58.686 --> 00:31:00.246 A:middle
the same, they also share the

00:30:58.686 --> 00:31:00.246 A:middle
the same, they also share the

00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:01.486 A:middle
same metrics, and it makes

00:31:01.546 --> 00:31:02.556 A:middle
layout a lot easier.

00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:07.396 A:middle
And to round off our button

00:31:07.396 --> 00:31:08.716 A:middle
story -- I mentioned there's a

00:31:08.716 --> 00:31:09.696 A:middle
lot of buttons in UIKit.

00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:11.576 A:middle
We'll go to bar buttons.

00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:14.616 A:middle
We have updated all the artwork

00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:16.046 A:middle
in UIKit to use symbols.

00:31:16.046 --> 00:31:17.486 A:middle
It not only applies to bar

00:31:17.486 --> 00:31:20.136 A:middle
buttons, but everywhere, and bar

00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:22.176 A:middle
buttons feel right in place with

00:31:22.176 --> 00:31:22.866 A:middle
the new artwork.

00:31:23.226 --> 00:31:25.906 A:middle
Now, if you do back-deploy to

00:31:26.506 --> 00:31:27.886 A:middle
older systems, you have to keep

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:28.866 A:middle
in mind that if you create

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.756 A:middle
custom artwork, on older

00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:32.186 A:middle
systems, you still get the

00:31:32.186 --> 00:31:34.626 A:middle
previous, thinner artwork than

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:36.226 A:middle
the new, updated artwork.

00:31:36.226 --> 00:31:37.586 A:middle
So keep that in mind if you

00:31:37.586 --> 00:31:40.176 A:middle
create assets for your

00:31:40.296 --> 00:31:40.986 A:middle
back-deployment.

00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:45.806 A:middle
You can use symbols in bar

00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
buttons with images.

00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:48.866 A:middle
We have existing API for this,

00:31:49.306 --> 00:31:51.046 A:middle
and you just put a symbol in

00:31:51.046 --> 00:31:51.256 A:middle
there.

00:31:51.256 --> 00:31:52.556 A:middle
And it will feel right in place

00:31:52.596 --> 00:31:53.926 A:middle
with the system buttons.

00:31:54.046 --> 00:31:54.936 A:middle
You don't have to do anything

00:31:54.936 --> 00:31:55.176 A:middle
here.

00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:59.776 A:middle
That's all you have to do.

00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:01.156 A:middle
And again, like regular buttons,

00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:01.156 A:middle
And again, like regular buttons,

00:32:01.156 --> 00:32:03.036 A:middle
bar buttons come with the preset

00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:03.806 A:middle
configuration.

00:32:04.446 --> 00:32:05.996 A:middle
And in any non-compact size

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:07.786 A:middle
class, like in portrait mode on

00:32:07.786 --> 00:32:10.276 A:middle
your phone, the configuration

00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:11.026 A:middle
will be large.

00:32:11.736 --> 00:32:15.096 A:middle
If you then rotate your phone,

00:32:15.096 --> 00:32:16.576 A:middle
and end up in a compact size

00:32:16.636 --> 00:32:17.656 A:middle
class, we will change that

00:32:17.656 --> 00:32:19.126 A:middle
configuration on the button to

00:32:19.126 --> 00:32:19.766 A:middle
be medium.

00:32:20.236 --> 00:32:21.456 A:middle
And this will call the symbol to

00:32:21.816 --> 00:32:23.836 A:middle
slightly be smaller, and to fit

00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:25.256 A:middle
perfectly in the more compact

00:32:25.296 --> 00:32:25.696 A:middle
bars.

00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:27.696 A:middle
It also means that you don't

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:29.016 A:middle
have to provide a secondary

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:30.856 A:middle
image anymore, because the

00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:31.736 A:middle
system does all the work.

00:32:31.736 --> 00:32:34.076 A:middle
It will scale using the built-in

00:32:34.116 --> 00:32:34.736 A:middle
symbol scales.

[ Applause ]

00:32:40.096 --> 00:32:41.906 A:middle
And on the iPad, we're -- we

00:32:41.906 --> 00:32:43.766 A:middle
always have a large, because of

00:32:43.766 --> 00:32:45.046 A:middle
the things I mentioned before.

00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:49.376 A:middle
Now, another thing about symbols

00:32:49.546 --> 00:32:51.086 A:middle
is rendering modes.

00:32:51.816 --> 00:32:53.156 A:middle
Any regular image has, like,

00:32:54.186 --> 00:32:56.356 A:middle
color data built into it, but

00:32:56.356 --> 00:32:57.586 A:middle
for a symbol, it's different.

00:32:57.586 --> 00:32:58.766 A:middle
It has an intrinsic mode.

00:32:59.236 --> 00:33:00.066 A:middle
It doesn't have an intrinsic

00:32:59.236 --> 00:33:00.066 A:middle
It doesn't have an intrinsic

00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:00.326 A:middle
color.

00:33:00.326 --> 00:33:02.096 A:middle
So we use the tint color to

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:06.146 A:middle
render the symbol, and if we

00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:07.206 A:middle
don't have a tint color, we'll

00:33:07.206 --> 00:33:07.716 A:middle
use black.

00:33:08.026 --> 00:33:09.056 A:middle
But don't rely on that black,

00:33:09.056 --> 00:33:10.416 A:middle
because it don't want -- work

00:33:10.496 --> 00:33:12.646 A:middle
nice with dark mode, and it

00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:14.136 A:middle
might be subject to change.

00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:16.896 A:middle
How does this work?

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:20.186 A:middle
The rendering mode on any image

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:22.656 A:middle
is automatic, and up until now,

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:23.866 A:middle
for any image, that would

00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:25.486 A:middle
usually resolve to always

00:33:25.486 --> 00:33:25.946 A:middle
original.

00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:30.826 A:middle
Now, in -- with symbols, that

00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:31.216 A:middle
changes.

00:33:31.726 --> 00:33:33.346 A:middle
Non-symbol images still usually

00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:35.176 A:middle
resolve to always original, but

00:33:35.176 --> 00:33:36.986 A:middle
symbol images will resolve to

00:33:36.986 --> 00:33:37.746 A:middle
always template.

00:33:37.906 --> 00:33:39.166 A:middle
And that means that we'll use

00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:40.976 A:middle
the tint color to give them a

00:33:41.016 --> 00:33:43.106 A:middle
color, and that's all there is

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:43.356 A:middle
to it.

00:33:43.936 --> 00:33:44.856 A:middle
You can change the rendering

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.816 A:middle
mode on an image with the

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:47.686 A:middle
existing API.

00:33:48.756 --> 00:33:50.206 A:middle
Now, I've covered the basic

00:33:50.206 --> 00:33:52.086 A:middle
UIKit controls, but sometimes,

00:33:52.086 --> 00:33:53.716 A:middle
you do want to draw an image in

00:33:53.716 --> 00:33:54.596 A:middle
a graphic context.

00:33:55.136 --> 00:33:56.476 A:middle
And you would probably use

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:57.316 A:middle
draw(in Rect.

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.446 A:middle
Now, for symbols, like I

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.446 A:middle
Now, for symbols, like I

00:34:00.446 --> 00:34:01.696 A:middle
mentioned before, that's

00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:02.706 A:middle
probably not a good idea,

00:34:02.706 --> 00:34:03.666 A:middle
because they want to be their

00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:04.406 A:middle
natural size.

00:34:04.486 --> 00:34:05.866 A:middle
So it's better to use draw(at

00:34:06.356 --> 00:34:08.045 A:middle
and have the image decide how

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.005 A:middle
large it wants to be.

00:34:10.186 --> 00:34:11.016 A:middle
But we have a problem.

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:12.335 A:middle
We have this image, but it's too

00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:12.726 A:middle
small.

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:15.516 A:middle
By default, images come with an

00:34:15.556 --> 00:34:16.946 A:middle
unspecified configuration.

00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:18.896 A:middle
Nothing is specified, and if

00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:20.166 A:middle
we're just -- if you have to

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:21.696 A:middle
render it, and we don't find a

00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:23.496 A:middle
specific value, we'll fall back

00:34:23.496 --> 00:34:24.636 A:middle
to the system defaults.

00:34:24.766 --> 00:34:26.356 A:middle
And in this case, that ends up

00:34:26.436 --> 00:34:27.726 A:middle
with a pretty small image.

00:34:28.306 --> 00:34:31.646 A:middle
Now, I can create a

00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:32.956 A:middle
configuration to make it larger

00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:36.266 A:middle
-- 34 points, and a bold weight,

00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:37.786 A:middle
and then use new API

00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:40.326 A:middle
withConfiguration to apply that

00:34:40.386 --> 00:34:41.755 A:middle
configuration to the image, and

00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:43.746 A:middle
get a new image with that

00:34:43.746 --> 00:34:44.916 A:middle
configuration built in.

00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:46.996 A:middle
Which results in this larger,

00:34:47.156 --> 00:34:48.906 A:middle
slightly more bold teacup, which

00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:49.976 A:middle
is exactly what I wanted.

00:34:54.476 --> 00:34:56.436 A:middle
Going back to our pop-over,

00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:59.856 A:middle
Paolo also asked me to change

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:01.676 A:middle
the text here, because symbols

00:35:02.036 --> 00:35:02.896 A:middle
feel at home in text.

00:35:03.586 --> 00:35:05.636 A:middle
Can we replace some words with

00:35:05.756 --> 00:35:06.216 A:middle
symbols?

00:35:07.056 --> 00:35:10.036 A:middle
Well, we can, but symbols are

00:35:10.036 --> 00:35:11.926 A:middle
typographic in nature, but they

00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:12.756 A:middle
are still images.

00:35:12.806 --> 00:35:14.236 A:middle
So we have to use an attributed

00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:16.756 A:middle
string with an NSTextAttachment.

00:35:18.196 --> 00:35:19.206 A:middle
Now, this code will look

00:35:19.206 --> 00:35:20.856 A:middle
familiar, but we have a new

00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:22.506 A:middle
piece of API,

00:35:22.506 --> 00:35:24.426 A:middle
NSTextAttachment(image that will

00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:25.956 A:middle
create a text attachment with

00:35:25.956 --> 00:35:27.136 A:middle
the image attached.

00:35:28.306 --> 00:35:31.036 A:middle
Now, this text attachment is a

00:35:31.036 --> 00:35:32.206 A:middle
bit smarter than the regular

00:35:32.206 --> 00:35:32.416 A:middle
one.

00:35:32.996 --> 00:35:35.656 A:middle
It knows about symbols, and it

00:35:35.656 --> 00:35:37.316 A:middle
will actually inspect the string

00:35:37.316 --> 00:35:40.116 A:middle
around the symbol to complete

00:35:40.116 --> 00:35:41.686 A:middle
the configuration of that symbol

00:35:42.396 --> 00:35:43.286 A:middle
as much as it can.

00:35:43.286 --> 00:35:44.566 A:middle
It will look at the font size.

00:35:44.566 --> 00:35:45.696 A:middle
It will look at the font weight,

00:35:45.696 --> 00:35:46.626 A:middle
but it will also look at the

00:35:46.656 --> 00:35:48.546 A:middle
color, and then the completed

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:49.446 A:middle
image will be drawn.

[ Applause ]

00:35:57.676 --> 00:36:00.036 A:middle
The old API, or the existing API

00:35:57.676 --> 00:36:00.036 A:middle
The old API, or the existing API

00:36:00.426 --> 00:36:01.646 A:middle
creating a text attachment and

00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:02.606 A:middle
then assigning the image still

00:36:02.606 --> 00:36:03.576 A:middle
works, but it won't get the

00:36:03.576 --> 00:36:04.326 A:middle
matching behavior.

00:36:04.886 --> 00:36:06.326 A:middle
And of course, you can also use

00:36:06.326 --> 00:36:07.636 A:middle
this new API with any regular

00:36:07.636 --> 00:36:08.016 A:middle
image.

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:11.296 A:middle
Paolo also wanted some color

00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:11.526 A:middle
here.

00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:13.816 A:middle
Looks better.

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:18.926 A:middle
Yeah. And we created some new

00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:19.526 A:middle
API to do this.

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:22.216 A:middle
You can tint an image now.

00:36:22.836 --> 00:36:25.246 A:middle
So withTintColor applies a color

00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:26.906 A:middle
to the image, and it does so

00:36:26.906 --> 00:36:27.846 A:middle
very efficiently.

00:36:28.116 --> 00:36:30.066 A:middle
It will only render the color

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:31.526 A:middle
when it needs to, and then it

00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:32.696 A:middle
will look at the most efficient

00:36:32.696 --> 00:36:33.526 A:middle
way to do this.

00:36:34.386 --> 00:36:35.386 A:middle
And before, you would probably

00:36:35.386 --> 00:36:37.066 A:middle
have to rasterize an image, and

00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:38.446 A:middle
render into a graphics context,

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:39.436 A:middle
and then apply a color.

00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:40.436 A:middle
You don't have to do that

00:36:40.436 --> 00:36:40.796 A:middle
anymore.

00:36:41.296 --> 00:36:43.276 A:middle
This takes care of this.

[ Applause ]

00:36:49.046 --> 00:36:50.376 A:middle
And it's especially important

00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:51.496 A:middle
for symbols, because they don't

00:36:51.496 --> 00:36:52.766 A:middle
have an intrinsic color, and

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:53.706 A:middle
this will give them a color.

00:36:54.196 --> 00:36:55.496 A:middle
Now, symbols also have a

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:56.376 A:middle
different rendering mode.

00:36:56.376 --> 00:36:57.666 A:middle
So if you really want that color

00:36:57.726 --> 00:36:59.726 A:middle
to pop out, you have to change

00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:00.656 A:middle
the rendering mode, and you can

00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:00.656 A:middle
the rendering mode, and you can

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:01.926 A:middle
do it in one go with this

00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:02.946 A:middle
optional parameter.

00:37:07.556 --> 00:37:09.096 A:middle
the first beta, but they will

00:37:09.096 --> 00:37:09.506 A:middle
come soon.

So we've seen a lot of API, and

00:37:16.786 --> 00:37:18.356 A:middle
we think we provided you with a

00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:20.216 A:middle
great tool set to make your apps

00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:22.206 A:middle
really shine in iOS 13.

00:37:22.726 --> 00:37:25.076 A:middle
But there's a few tips.

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:28.416 A:middle
Prefer horizontal and vertical

00:37:28.466 --> 00:37:30.106 A:middle
centering over edge alignment.

00:37:30.786 --> 00:37:31.926 A:middle
It's a bit of a mental shift,

00:37:32.176 --> 00:37:33.906 A:middle
but once you figure it out, it

00:37:33.906 --> 00:37:34.606 A:middle
really works out.

00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:37.476 A:middle
And try to build your layouts

00:37:37.476 --> 00:37:40.316 A:middle
from the smallest element up to

00:37:40.316 --> 00:37:41.126 A:middle
the largest element.

00:37:41.126 --> 00:37:42.256 A:middle
It's pretty easy to start with

00:37:42.256 --> 00:37:43.866 A:middle
something small and then use it

00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:44.786 A:middle
as a building block to make

00:37:44.826 --> 00:37:45.476 A:middle
something larger.

00:37:45.556 --> 00:37:47.946 A:middle
And be flexible.

00:37:48.026 --> 00:37:49.576 A:middle
Image sizes can change.

00:37:50.396 --> 00:37:52.516 A:middle
Allow your image views to be the

00:37:52.516 --> 00:37:54.646 A:middle
size of their image but be aware

00:37:54.646 --> 00:37:55.486 A:middle
of the fact that they can

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:55.946 A:middle
change.

00:37:56.526 --> 00:37:58.686 A:middle
It can be at run time, or it can

00:37:58.686 --> 00:38:01.606 A:middle
be over app launches, or even

00:37:58.686 --> 00:38:01.606 A:middle
be over app launches, or even

00:38:01.606 --> 00:38:02.966 A:middle
over system updates.

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.946 A:middle
Caching images usually doesn't

00:38:06.946 --> 00:38:07.156 A:middle
help.

00:38:08.436 --> 00:38:09.816 A:middle
It's a great source of bugs, and

00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:11.306 A:middle
the system already does its best

00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:13.006 A:middle
to provide the best performance

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:13.936 A:middle
that it can.

00:38:14.016 --> 00:38:16.186 A:middle
And caching really gives you an

00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:17.736 A:middle
override, so there's no need to

00:38:17.736 --> 00:38:18.086 A:middle
do that.

00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:22.026 A:middle
And finally, rasterizing is, in

00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:25.886 A:middle
most cases, the worst solution,

00:38:25.886 --> 00:38:27.586 A:middle
or the least-optimal solution to

00:38:27.586 --> 00:38:28.366 A:middle
fix the problem.

00:38:28.426 --> 00:38:32.386 A:middle
So save your CPU cycles for

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:34.616 A:middle
something useful, and let the

00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:36.496 A:middle
system rasterize an image.

00:38:36.816 --> 00:38:38.316 A:middle
So try to avoid rasterizing

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:40.486 A:middle
images, especially symbol

00:38:40.486 --> 00:38:40.946 A:middle
images.

00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:45.096 A:middle
The accessibility and

00:38:45.096 --> 00:38:46.206 A:middle
localization sessions this

00:38:46.206 --> 00:38:47.896 A:middle
morning were -- are very

00:38:48.066 --> 00:38:49.146 A:middle
interesting to check out,

00:38:49.146 --> 00:38:51.046 A:middle
because symbols make adaptation

00:38:51.046 --> 00:38:52.636 A:middle
in those areas a lot simpler.

00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:55.026 A:middle
And there's the Implementing

00:38:55.026 --> 00:38:56.376 A:middle
Dark Mode tomorrow, where

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:57.576 A:middle
symbols also really shine

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:00.576 A:middle
because of dark tint color.

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:00.576 A:middle
because of dark tint color.

00:39:01.676 --> 00:39:04.886 A:middle
There are two labs you might be

00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:05.486 A:middle
interested in.

00:39:05.486 --> 00:39:07.766 A:middle
There's a text and SF symbols

00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.796 A:middle
lab, and fonts lab on Thursday,

00:39:10.136 --> 00:39:11.446 A:middle
and there's a design lab on

00:39:11.446 --> 00:39:12.306 A:middle
Friday afternoon.

00:39:12.826 --> 00:39:15.256 A:middle
And of course, you're welcome at

00:39:15.256 --> 00:39:16.306 A:middle
any of the UIKit labs.

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:18.266 A:middle
Thank you so much for listening

00:39:18.266 --> 00:39:19.576 A:middle
and enjoy the rest of your WWDC.

00:39:20.516 --> 00:39:26.500 A:middle
