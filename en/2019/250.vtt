00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:12.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:14.326 A:middle
My name is Dan.

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:15.636 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.316 A:middle
Accessibility Team, and I'm

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:18.506 A:middle
super excited to be talking to

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.086 A:middle
you about Accessibility Custom

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.696 A:middle
Actions and how they can improve

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.336 A:middle
the experience for people using

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.976 A:middle
assistive technologies with your

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:25.346 A:middle
apps.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:26.646 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.656 A:middle
Custom actions are really great

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:30.386 A:middle
for two things.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.826 A:middle
The first is reducing clutter in

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:33.206 A:middle
your app.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:35.436 A:middle
This is important for everyone

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.026 A:middle
that uses your app, but it's

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:38.256 A:middle
especially important for people

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:39.796 A:middle
that use assistive technologies,

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:40.916 A:middle
and I'll explain why.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.346 A:middle
The second is all about

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:44.736 A:middle
improving the convenience and

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:46.066 A:middle
speed of more complex

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.906 A:middle
interactions in your app.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.216 A:middle
Let's start by talking about

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.426 A:middle
reducing clutter and to do this

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:53.196 A:middle
I'd like to talk about

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:53.786 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:55.986 A:middle
VoiceOver is the built-in screen

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.076 A:middle
reader we ship across many of

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:58.246 A:middle
our products for people who are

00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:59.406 A:middle
blind and low vision.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:01.746 A:middle
People that use VoiceOver can

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:02.886 A:middle
navigate through their apps in a

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:04.936 A:middle
variety of ways but one way

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.616 A:middle
that's particularly popular when

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:07.986 A:middle
navigating through a new app or

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:10.066 A:middle
interface is by swiping left and

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.606 A:middle
right to move between the next

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
and previous item.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.756 A:middle
I have an app I've been working

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:16.866 A:middle
on to help me track my favorite

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.586 A:middle
types of peanut butter.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.486 A:middle
If you were going to use this

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:22.066 A:middle
app without using VoiceOver and

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.326 A:middle
we wanted to increase the rating

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.466 A:middle
of the second jar of peanut

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.886 A:middle
butter in this list, how do we

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:27.476 A:middle
go about doing that?

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:30.766 A:middle
Well, you'd probably visually

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.396 A:middle
scan the list until you found

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:33.336 A:middle
the jar you were looking for.

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:35.746 A:middle
You then might focus on that

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.276 A:middle
cell and look for the button

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:38.416 A:middle
that affords the action you want

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.486 A:middle
to perform and then tap on it.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:43.396 A:middle
Now that may seem pretty

00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:46.026 A:middle
intuitive but that's because the

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.426 A:middle
UI affords that intuition by

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
logically grouping the buttons

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.036 A:middle
with the cells, which makes the

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:52.806 A:middle
content easy for us to process

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:56.016 A:middle
and digest, but what if instead

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.136 A:middle
the app was laid out a bit

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:57.666 A:middle
differently?

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.036 A:middle
Perhaps something like this.

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.036 A:middle
Perhaps something like this.

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:03.996 A:middle
Notice the buttons are now

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.566 A:middle
underneath the cells, which

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:06.736 A:middle
means we have a lot more content

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.396 A:middle
to scroll through.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.735 A:middle
Additionally, it's much more

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.296 A:middle
ambiguous as to which buttons

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.486 A:middle
correspond to which cells.

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.276 A:middle
This could very well be the

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:16.736 A:middle
experience for someone using

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.026 A:middle
VoiceOver with your app.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:19.806 A:middle
Let me show you what I mean.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:21.776 A:middle
Let's take a look at what it's

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.206 A:middle
like to use VoiceOver to

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.046 A:middle
navigate through one of the

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:25.806 A:middle
cells of this app.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:30.926 A:middle
1 out of 5.

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:33.116 A:middle
Add to favorites button.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.296 A:middle
Decrease rating button.

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:37.596 A:middle
Increase rating button.

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; After we swipe past the cell

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.696 A:middle
we focused on three buttons, add

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.546 A:middle
to favorites, decrease rating

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.776 A:middle
and increase rating and those

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.166 A:middle
three buttons exist in every

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.386 A:middle
single cell in this list.

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.096 A:middle
So if we were trying to find the

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.106 A:middle
10th jar, we would have listened

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.726 A:middle
to those buttons 30 times, which

00:02:57.726 --> 00:02:59.146 A:middle
can very quickly get repetitive.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:01.426 A:middle
Additionally, we have to keep in

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:02.846 A:middle
our head what the last jar of

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:03.926 A:middle
peanut butter we heard was,

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.156 A:middle
otherwise we don't know what

00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:07.366 A:middle
content is going to be affected

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.546 A:middle
when we activate one of those

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:09.000 A:middle
controls.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.206 A:middle
So let's take a look at the app

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.356 A:middle
only this time designed a bit

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:13.836 A:middle
differently.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.556 A:middle
I've changed the buttons so that

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:16.676 A:middle
they're no longer accessible to

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:17.246 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.246 A:middle
I've added custom actions to the

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:21.006 A:middle
cells so that when VoiceOver

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.536 A:middle
lands on a cell we can swipe up

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.956 A:middle
or down with one finger to

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:25.496 A:middle
choose an action and then double

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.486 A:middle
tap to perform it.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:27.626 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:33.626 A:middle
1 out of 5.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.126 A:middle
Anna's, chunky, sugar-free,

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.096 A:middle
rated 4 out of 5.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:40.416 A:middle
Actions available toggle

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:43.226 A:middle
favorite, increase rating.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:46.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This time when we swipe past

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:48.576 A:middle
the cell we just got to the next

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:50.586 A:middle
one which made it much easier

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.526 A:middle
for us to go through this

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:52.876 A:middle
content and find what we are

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:53.446 A:middle
looking for.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:55.996 A:middle
Once we found it, we could then

00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:57.536 A:middle
drill in and pick an interaction

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.086 A:middle
from there, which much more

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
closely matches the experience

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
closely matches the experience

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:01.786 A:middle
we talked about earlier of

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:03.626 A:middle
visually scanning a list.

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.446 A:middle
So custom actions can really

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.656 A:middle
help us reduce clutter, we

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:10.146 A:middle
remove the repetitive controls,

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:11.676 A:middle
and we also reduced the

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
cognitive load on ourselves

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.346 A:middle
while we were using the app.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.685 A:middle
Because we're explicitly picking

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.305 A:middle
an interaction after finding the

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:19.906 A:middle
content we want to interact with

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:22.166 A:middle
it's no longer ambiguous what

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.096 A:middle
those controls do.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.296 A:middle
All of this simplified the

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:25.866 A:middle
experience.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:30.436 A:middle
Next let's talk about how custom

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.646 A:middle
actions can improve the

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.126 A:middle
convenience and speed of more

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:34.496 A:middle
complex interactions in your app

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:36.566 A:middle
and to do this I'd like to talk

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.386 A:middle
about Switch Control.

00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:39.686 A:middle
This is another feature we ship

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:41.096 A:middle
for people with limited mobility

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:42.706 A:middle
and these people can interact

00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:43.996 A:middle
with their devices using as few

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:45.316 A:middle
as one or two inputs.

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:48.096 A:middle
I've added some additional

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:49.186 A:middle
functionality into the peanut

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.836 A:middle
butter app so that when we long

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
press on a cell an action sheet

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.016 A:middle
comes up with additional options

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:55.896 A:middle
including the option to send

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.126 A:middle
information about one of the

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.186 A:middle
jars of peanut butter to a

00:04:58.186 --> 00:04:58.576 A:middle
friend.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.586 A:middle
I have two switches paired with

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.586 A:middle
I have two switches paired with

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:00.986 A:middle
the device.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:03.336 A:middle
The orange switch will move

00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:04.566 A:middle
Switch Control's focus to the

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:06.646 A:middle
next item and the white switch

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:07.636 A:middle
will select that item.

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:09.996 A:middle
Keep in mind switches can be

00:05:09.996 --> 00:05:11.016 A:middle
designed for a variety of

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:11.516 A:middle
different needs.

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:13.566 A:middle
So, for example, someone might

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:14.696 A:middle
have switches mounted to a

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:15.566 A:middle
wheelchair that they can

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.346 A:middle
activate with their head.

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:18.656 A:middle
Let's take a look at what it's

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.866 A:middle
like to Switch Control to send

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.076 A:middle
information about that second

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:23.066 A:middle
jar of peanut butter to our

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:23.500 A:middle
friend.

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.196 A:middle
So we can use our orange switch

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.516 A:middle
to navigate down to the second

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.066 A:middle
cell and then use the white

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.116 A:middle
switch to select it.

00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:32.836 A:middle
This brings up the Switch

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:34.336 A:middle
Control Menu which provides

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:35.656 A:middle
additional options of ways we

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:36.726 A:middle
can interact with the cell.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:39.056 A:middle
We can navigate down to the page

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.896 A:middle
control and select it to view

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:41.666 A:middle
more options.

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:44.446 A:middle
From here, we can press select

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.106 A:middle
to drill in and then navigate

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:46.906 A:middle
over to gestures.

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:49.246 A:middle
Selecting this will give us a

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.836 A:middle
list of all of the gestures we

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:52.276 A:middle
might have wanted to perform by

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
touching the display.

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.926 A:middle
From here we can navigate down

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.246 A:middle
to the second row and press

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.046 A:middle
select to drill in and then

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
navigate over to tap and hold.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
navigate over to tap and hold.

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:03.006 A:middle
Selecting this will perform our

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:04.496 A:middle
long press gesture and bring up

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.126 A:middle
our action sheet, which we can

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:08.126 A:middle
then navigate through to select

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:08.996 A:middle
send to a friend.

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:12.556 A:middle
We'll perform the tap and we're

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:13.000 A:middle
done.

00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:17.356 A:middle
Now if you think about it, we

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
did all of that and we never

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:20.726 A:middle
touched the display.

00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:23.316 A:middle
That's pretty cool, right?

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.156 A:middle
But you also probably noticed

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:27.386 A:middle
that that interaction normally

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.946 A:middle
takes us two taps, one long

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.646 A:middle
press and one tap on the action

00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:33.806 A:middle
sheet and with Switch Control

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:38.186 A:middle
that took us 18 taps, but custom

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:39.756 A:middle
actions can significantly reduce

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:40.256 A:middle
that number.

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:43.596 A:middle
So let's take a look again only

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:44.706 A:middle
this time I've added custom

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
actions back into the app.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.006 A:middle
We'll still use the orange

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:49.156 A:middle
switch to navigate down to the

00:06:49.206 --> 00:06:51.436 A:middle
second cell only this time when

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
we select it right away on the

00:06:53.386 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
first page of the Switch Control

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.066 A:middle
Menu are all of the actions of

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:56.716 A:middle
we've implemented.

00:06:57.426 --> 00:06:59.306 A:middle
We can drill in, navigate over

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:01.056 A:middle
to send to a friend, press

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:01.056 A:middle
to send to a friend, press

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.736 A:middle
select and we're done.

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:06.326 A:middle
We didn't even need to navigate

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:07.396 A:middle
through the action sheet that

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:08.386 A:middle
came up the first time.

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:10.866 A:middle
We're right where we need to be.

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
That was a significantly faster

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.066 A:middle
interaction.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.626 A:middle
We were able to take those 18

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.896 A:middle
taps and we get all the way down

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.836 A:middle
to 6 taps, which is 67% fewer

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:22.806 A:middle
taps than before.

00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:26.366 A:middle
So custom actions can provide

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:27.926 A:middle
huge wins for convenience and

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:28.336 A:middle
speed.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:30.566 A:middle
We removed the cumbersome

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:32.036 A:middle
gestures which significantly

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:33.036 A:middle
sped up the interaction.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.286 A:middle
Additionally, we improved the

00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:36.856 A:middle
prominence and the convenience

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.466 A:middle
of those interaction options by

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:39.666 A:middle
placing them on the first page

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:40.656 A:middle
of the Switch Control Menu.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:42.566 A:middle
We didn't need to navigate

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:44.166 A:middle
through several submenus and try

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.526 A:middle
out different gestures to figure

00:07:45.526 --> 00:07:46.516 A:middle
what might be possible.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:48.526 A:middle
Instead, everything was much

00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:50.606 A:middle
more straightforward and direct.

00:07:51.436 --> 00:07:52.746 A:middle
Now I bet after hearing all

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:54.266 A:middle
these awesome advantages of

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:55.946 A:middle
custom actions you just can't

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.116 A:middle
wait to use them in your apps

00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:58.896 A:middle
and luckily it's pretty easy.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:00.926 A:middle
You simply override the

00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:02.286 A:middle
Accessibility Custom Actions

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.406 A:middle
property on your view and return

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:06.026 A:middle
an array of UI accessibility,

00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.236 A:middle
custom action objects.

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:09.886 A:middle
Each one takes in a name, a

00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:11.036 A:middle
target, and a selector.

00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:13.676 A:middle
Your function simply needs to

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.936 A:middle
return a Boolean as to whether

00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:16.226 A:middle
or not the action was successful

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.466 A:middle
and take in an UI accessibility

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:19.696 A:middle
custom action object as a

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:20.136 A:middle
parameter.

00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:23.316 A:middle
New this year we have a version

00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:24.626 A:middle
of the API that takes in an

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:25.936 A:middle
action handler instead of a

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:26.756 A:middle
target and selector.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:28.576 A:middle
So if using a block of code

00:08:28.636 --> 00:08:29.606 A:middle
better fits with the design of

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:30.996 A:middle
your app, we encourage you to

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:31.656 A:middle
give this a try.

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.015 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:36.866 A:middle
Yes.

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:39.226 A:middle
Additionally, if you're going to

00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:40.716 A:middle
use a custom action to replace

00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:41.895 A:middle
something like an accessory

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:43.756 A:middle
control inside of a cell, you'll

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.776 A:middle
often want to set is

00:08:44.776 --> 00:08:46.236 A:middle
accessibility element to false

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:47.786 A:middle
on those controls so they're no

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:48.706 A:middle
longer navigable by the

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:49.646 A:middle
assistive technology.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.786 A:middle
And what we talked about our

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:54.256 A:middle
VoiceOver and Switch Control in

00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:56.486 A:middle
our demos today, custom actions

00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:57.786 A:middle
can be leveraged across many of

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.036 A:middle
the assistive technologies we

00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:00.956 A:middle
ship including full keyboard

00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:00.956 A:middle
ship including full keyboard

00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
access and voice control which

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:03.116 A:middle
are new this year.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:04.976 A:middle
I really encourage you to turn

00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:06.526 A:middle
some of these features on and

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.866 A:middle
play around with your apps to

00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.356 A:middle
look for ways custom actions can

00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:10.346 A:middle
improve the experience.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:11.826 A:middle
Thank you very much.
