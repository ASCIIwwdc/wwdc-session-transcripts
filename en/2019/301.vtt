00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to our

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.526 A:middle
session on What's New in App

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:19.146 A:middle
Store Connect.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:21.556 A:middle
My name is Tommy McGlynn and I'm

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:22.826 A:middle
an App Store Connect Engineer.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.356 A:middle
Today our focus is the App

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:26.946 A:middle
Lifecycle.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:28.906 A:middle
This is everything from the

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.536 A:middle
moment you first began creating

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:32.555 A:middle
an app to the moment you make it

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.006 A:middle
available in the App Store.

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:37.316 A:middle
As we look at the lifecycle

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:38.496 A:middle
today, we'll highlight some

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:39.696 A:middle
things that are important to

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.016 A:middle
know and we'll look at recent

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.746 A:middle
improvements to specific phases

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:44.466 A:middle
of the lifecycle.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.166 A:middle
And finally we'll look at some

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.356 A:middle
brand new features that you

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.486 A:middle
haven't seen yet.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.086 A:middle
So let's begin where it all

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.436 A:middle
starts for every developer and

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:55.576 A:middle
that's where we design and

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.416 A:middle
develop apps in Xcode.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.546 A:middle
Xcode is where you create apps,

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.546 A:middle
Xcode is where you create apps,

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:01.926 A:middle
and we've just announced that

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.496 A:middle
you can now deliver amazing

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.075 A:middle
watch apps without needing to

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.366 A:middle
build an iOS companion app.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.796 A:middle
And these apps will be fully

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
supported in App Store Connect

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
from TestFlight through to

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.246 A:middle
through to the App Store and

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:19.896 A:middle
customers can discover your app

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.526 A:middle
right on their watch, in the new

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:23.266 A:middle
App Store built specifically for

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:23.976 A:middle
Apple Watch.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.156 A:middle
Now you've built an app in Xcode

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:30.256 A:middle
and you're ready to share it

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:30.866 A:middle
with the world.

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:34.246 A:middle
The next step is to upload your

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:34.973 A:middle
app.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.666 A:middle
A common way to deliver apps

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.756 A:middle
today is within Xcode or with

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:43.506 A:middle
Application Loader which is an

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:46.906 A:middle
app that's installed with Xcode.

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:48.596 A:middle
Beginning with the beta of Xcode

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.926 A:middle
11, Application Loader will no

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:51.826 A:middle
longer be included.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.616 A:middle
Instead, we've created a new

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.106 A:middle
dedicated experience for

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.956 A:middle
delivering apps that does not

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.546 A:middle
require you to install Xcode.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.146 A:middle
It's called Transporter.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.166 A:middle
This is a dedicated Mac App

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:06.976 A:middle
that's super easy to use and

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.166 A:middle
it's a great way to deliver your

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:08.586 A:middle
apps.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.346 A:middle
Transporter is also a localized

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:12.576 A:middle
app.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:14.436 A:middle
So it's a great experience for

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:16.306 A:middle
anyone on your team across many

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:16.906 A:middle
languages.

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.166 A:middle
So let's take a closer look at

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.156 A:middle
how to use Transporter.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.476 A:middle
First you sign in with your

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.106 A:middle
Apple ID.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.016 A:middle
Then if you belong to multiple

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.636 A:middle
teams, you'll choose one from

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:30.436 A:middle
the drop-down list.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.246 A:middle
Now it's time to select the

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:35.536 A:middle
files that you want to deliver.

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
Transporter uses a simple

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.366 A:middle
drag-and-drop interface.

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:42.306 A:middle
You just take your IPA that

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:44.186 A:middle
you've exported from Xcode, drag

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:45.806 A:middle
it over Transporter and drop.

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:48.656 A:middle
From there it's a simple click

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.846 A:middle
to begin verifying the package.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.116 A:middle
Transporter will display

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.856 A:middle
warnings and errors that occur

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.786 A:middle
during validation so you can

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:01.556 A:middle
find and fix them early.

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:01.556 A:middle
find and fix them early.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.766 A:middle
Once errors have been addressed

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:04.256 A:middle
you can click to deliver the

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:04.686 A:middle
package.

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:07.976 A:middle
Transporter will display

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:10.156 A:middle
delivery progress and you have

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.076 A:middle
the option to cancel or restart

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.236 A:middle
deliveries that have not yet

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:13.716 A:middle
completed.

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:17.546 A:middle
You also have the option to

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:19.516 A:middle
verify many packages at the same

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:19.846 A:middle
time.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.366 A:middle
Simply drag all of them into

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.146 A:middle
Transporter and click to begin

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:24.756 A:middle
validation.

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:27.196 A:middle
That's transporter for Mac.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:28.796 A:middle
It's really easy, and I know it

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:30.066 A:middle
could be a great tool for your

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:30.746 A:middle
team.

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:34.746 A:middle
So once your app is uploaded, we

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.886 A:middle
do some further validations and

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.036 A:middle
some issues can only be

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:40.656 A:middle
diagnosed after we've received

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:41.016 A:middle
your app.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:43.926 A:middle
If we do find any issues, you'll

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:45.276 A:middle
receive an email to let you

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:48.926 A:middle
know, and we've recently made

00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:50.036 A:middle
some enhancements to these

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:50.926 A:middle
emails.

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.346 A:middle
First we added the version

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.526 A:middle
number prominently in the

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.256 A:middle
subject line.

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.616 A:middle
We also added additional context

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.016 A:middle
to help you quickly understand

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.016 A:middle
to help you quickly understand

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:01.446 A:middle
the problem.

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.126 A:middle
And finally we added numeric

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:06.386 A:middle
codes for each error.

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:08.406 A:middle
These will help you find more

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.546 A:middle
details on each error type.

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:14.066 A:middle
We've also introduced a new way

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.386 A:middle
to view your builds after

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:17.576 A:middle
they've been uploaded with the

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:19.426 A:middle
new Build Activity View in App

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.546 A:middle
Store Connect for iOS, where you

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:24.016 A:middle
can see all of the recent builds

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:26.126 A:middle
that you've uploaded along with

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:27.716 A:middle
detailed information about each

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:31.176 A:middle
build as well as the download

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.766 A:middle
and install sizes for each

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:33.356 A:middle
device model.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.476 A:middle
In addition to Build Activity,

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.896 A:middle
there's a new notification type

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:41.376 A:middle
that you can enable called Build

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.296 A:middle
Processing Changes.

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:45.056 A:middle
This is a great way to be

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.566 A:middle
notified immediately as your

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:47.736 A:middle
builds finish processing.

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:52.786 A:middle
Now you've delivered your app

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.156 A:middle
and you're moving from

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.776 A:middle
development into the testing

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:56.116 A:middle
phase.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:58.466 A:middle
The next step in the App

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.956 A:middle
Lifecycle is TestFlight.

00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:02.116 A:middle
We've built some exciting new

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.836 A:middle
features for TestFlight and to

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.046 A:middle
tell you all about it I'd like

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:05.976 A:middle
to invite Pyam on stage.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:12.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:13.136 --> 00:05:14.276 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:16.136 A:middle
My name Pyam Yousofi [assumed

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:16.916 A:middle
spelling], and I'm an engineer

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.676 A:middle
on App Store Connect.

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:19.706 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.136 A:middle
today to tell you all about

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:23.156 A:middle
what's new with TestFlight, but

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.296 A:middle
first let's reflect a little

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:25.906 A:middle
bit.

00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:29.236 A:middle
Last year we introduced Public

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:29.636 A:middle
Links.

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:32.206 A:middle
This made it so much easier for

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.026 A:middle
you to invite lots of new people

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:34.966 A:middle
to test their apps.

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:37.226 A:middle
All you needed to do is create a

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.606 A:middle
unique URL, you can share it

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.906 A:middle
with anyone, anywhere all

00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:42.746 A:middle
without an email address.

00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:45.996 A:middle
One of the first adopters of

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:48.486 A:middle
Public Links was Snapchat and

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
they had some great things to

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:50.286 A:middle
say.

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:52.516 A:middle
I'd like to read it to you now.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.366 A:middle
TestFlight Public Links reduce

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.646 A:middle
friction for our testers.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.716 A:middle
It increased our tester pool in

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:00.586 A:middle
a way that's lightweight and

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:00.586 A:middle
a way that's lightweight and

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:02.766 A:middle
easier to maintain while

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:03.896 A:middle
providing us with more than

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.076 A:middle
twice the amount of useful

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.056 A:middle
pre-release feedback.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.036 A:middle
It's that awesome?

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:10.566 A:middle
And we've been working harder to

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:12.336 A:middle
reduce friction for testers even

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:12.756 A:middle
more.

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:16.306 A:middle
This year we improved the

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:18.386 A:middle
TestFlight app by localizing it

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.786 A:middle
in dozens of additional

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:20.166 A:middle
language.

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.636 A:middle
That means that it's even more

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.596 A:middle
effortless for testers worldwide

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:27.516 A:middle
to start testing their apps.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:28.966 A:middle
And now that you have lots of

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:30.536 A:middle
new testers, you're probably

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:33.086 A:middle
eager to hear from them.

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.296 A:middle
We know how important it is for

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:36.636 A:middle
you to learn about new bugs and

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.576 A:middle
crashes as soon as they happen

00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:41.076 A:middle
during the testing phase, and we

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:42.126 A:middle
know that sometimes you don't

00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:43.276 A:middle
always get all the detail you

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:44.746 A:middle
need from your testers when they

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:45.636 A:middle
send you issues.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.266 A:middle
So today I'm really excited to

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:49.776 A:middle
announce something completely

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:50.846 A:middle
new for TestFlight.

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:52.826 A:middle
We've printed features that will

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:53.906 A:middle
improve the beta testing

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:56.146 A:middle
experience, and we call it

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:57.976 A:middle
TestFlight Feedback.

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:02.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:02.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.206 A:middle
Yeah, these are some great

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.856 A:middle
enhancements that help increase

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:07.456 A:middle
the quality and quantity of

00:07:07.456 --> 00:07:08.916 A:middle
feedback you receive from your

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:09.796 A:middle
beta testers.

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.976 A:middle
So now when testers first start

00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:14.656 A:middle
testing your app, they're see a

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:16.486 A:middle
new onboarding experience that

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:17.986 A:middle
helps them get up to speed on

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:19.396 A:middle
what to test and how to start

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:20.486 A:middle
sending you feedback.

00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:23.476 A:middle
Now there's two new ways to

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.416 A:middle
start sending feedback.

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:27.276 A:middle
First, testers can send

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:29.476 A:middle
screenshots to you without ever

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.126 A:middle
leaving your app.

00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:34.386 A:middle
And second, testers are prompted

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:36.556 A:middle
any time a crash occurs so they

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.796 A:middle
can quickly send you feedback

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.126 A:middle
about that crash.

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:42.356 A:middle
And we'll also go over new

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:43.476 A:middle
sections in App Store Connect

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.826 A:middle
that let you manage all the

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:46.186 A:middle
feedback you collect through

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:48.836 A:middle
Test Flight, but first let's

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.576 A:middle
take a closer look at how

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:52.306 A:middle
testers can send you feedback in

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:53.976 A:middle
a demo on my iPhone.

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.736 A:middle
So, my team invited me to test a

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:03.996 A:middle
beta version of their app called

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:05.086 A:middle
Forest Explorer.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.126 A:middle
It's still early in development

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:08.726 A:middle
and so there's lots for me to

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:09.706 A:middle
give feedback on.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:13.876 A:middle
Let's start testing it together.

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:15.406 A:middle
Now when you launch that first

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:17.186 A:middle
version of an app, you see this

00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:18.626 A:middle
new onboarding screen.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:20.536 A:middle
It tells you everything you need

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:22.266 A:middle
to know to get started and all

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:23.666 A:middle
you have to do is enter test

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:25.306 A:middle
notes on the builds in App Store

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.086 A:middle
Connect and it will display

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:27.446 A:middle
here.

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
So here I can see that my team

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.226 A:middle
wants me to be on the lookout

00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:32.736 A:middle
for issues in layout and

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:33.436 A:middle
usability.

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.666 A:middle
Sounds good to me so I'll tap

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:36.645 A:middle
next.

00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:39.186 A:middle
Here we see steps on how to

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.966 A:middle
start giving feedback just by

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.066 A:middle
taking a screenshot.

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:44.006 A:middle
I'm excited to give it a try.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:47.496 A:middle
So let's start testing.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:49.096 A:middle
Here's Forest Explorer.

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.246 A:middle
So you see my photo feed and

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:54.136 A:middle
some trails on the feed, and

00:08:54.136 --> 00:08:55.686 A:middle
right off the bat I can see that

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:57.786 A:middle
the Half Dome Trail, it's kind

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.296 A:middle
of darker in text in comparison

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:00.186 A:middle
to the other trails.

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:00.186 A:middle
to the other trails.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:01.946 A:middle
So this is a good opportunity

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:03.056 A:middle
for me to send some feedback.

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:06.686 A:middle
I'll take a screenshot, tap on

00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:08.936 A:middle
the preview, and here when you

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:11.226 A:middle
tap done, there's a new Share

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.716 A:middle
Beta Feedback Option.

00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:14.576 A:middle
This is available to all beta

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:16.106 A:middle
apps that's feedback enabled.

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:19.586 A:middle
Tap on that it opens up a

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:21.066 A:middle
dialogue for me to enter more

00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:21.906 A:middle
information.

00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:24.506 A:middle
Because I'm a Public Link tester

00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:25.756 A:middle
I have the option to include an

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:27.446 A:middle
email address with this piece of

00:09:27.446 --> 00:09:29.696 A:middle
feedback, but for now I'll just

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:30.476 A:middle
add some comments.

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.926 A:middle
The text should be more

00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:37.166 A:middle
consistent with the other trails

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:40.916 A:middle
and I'll tap submit and that's

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:40.983 A:middle
it.

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:42.636 A:middle
I just sent some feedback.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:48.376 A:middle
Thank you.

00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:49.416 A:middle
Let's keep looking around.

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.186 A:middle
On a trail, I see some trails

00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:53.696 A:middle
that I've saved on this app, and

00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:56.626 A:middle
I can see that the icons on the

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:57.886 A:middle
lower left are kind of clipped

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:58.706 A:middle
off-screen.

00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
So this might be a good place

00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
So this might be a good place

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:01.756 A:middle
for me to send some more

00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:02.206 A:middle
feedback.

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:05.116 A:middle
I'll take a screenshot and while

00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:06.586 A:middle
I'm at it I'll take a second

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.066 A:middle
screenshot too and that way I

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.556 A:middle
can crop the first one, but

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:12.996 A:middle
leave the second one intact for

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:13.386 A:middle
context.

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:17.346 A:middle
I'll even mark it up just to

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.486 A:middle
point out where the issue is

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:21.056 A:middle
happening, and I'll tap done and

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:22.066 A:middle
share beta feedback.

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.966 A:middle
Again, I can include comments

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:27.416 A:middle
about what the issue is, the

00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:29.436 A:middle
icons are clipped off-screen,

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:32.196 A:middle
and I'll tap submit.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.896 A:middle
And that's it.

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:36.536 A:middle
I've sent multiple screenshots.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
Isn't that awesome?

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:41.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:42.756 A:middle
Let's keep testing around.

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:44.246 A:middle
I'll tap on nearby and see what

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:46.716 A:middle
trails are around and let's find

00:10:46.716 --> 00:10:49.456 A:middle
a Half Dome Trail on the map.

00:10:49.456 --> 00:10:50.786 A:middle
Okay, Forest Explorer just

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:52.676 A:middle
crashed and this is a new

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:53.626 A:middle
feature that's a part of

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:54.166 A:middle
feedback.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.396 A:middle
Now when your beta apps crash,

00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:58.076 A:middle
testers are prompted to share

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.786 A:middle
feedback about the crash.

00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:01.816 A:middle
So I know my team will want to

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:03.266 A:middle
know about this so I'll tap

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.946 A:middle
share and here I can include

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:07.546 A:middle
steps on what caused the crash.

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:09.996 A:middle
Tapped on the Half Dome Trail

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:13.926 A:middle
and the app crashed.

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:18.096 A:middle
And that's it.

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:19.026 A:middle
I've just sent some crash

00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.556 A:middle
feedback to my team and they'll

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
know where to start debugging

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.356 A:middle
thanks to the feedback I sent.

00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:25.926 A:middle
So I think I'm done testing

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:28.616 A:middle
Forest Explorer for now, but as

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:31.116 A:middle
you can see, I've been able to

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.306 A:middle
send a bunch of valuable

00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:33.886 A:middle
feedback in just a few minutes

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:34.946 A:middle
of testing.

00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:35.866 A:middle
Isn't that exciting?

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:40.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:41.956 A:middle
These are some really great

00:11:41.956 --> 00:11:43.006 A:middle
features and sending feedback

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:44.476 A:middle
through TestFlight has never

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.676 A:middle
been easier and as a developer,

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:47.886 A:middle
you don't have to do any extra

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:50.046 A:middle
work to get quality feedback

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:50.866 A:middle
from your testers.

00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:53.756 A:middle
So finally, let's talk about

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.956 A:middle
managing the feedback in App

00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:55.426 A:middle
Store Connect.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.126 A:middle
You'll be able to view feedback

00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.496 A:middle
submissions shortly after you

00:11:59.496 --> 00:12:01.426 A:middle
receive them and you'll have

00:11:59.496 --> 00:12:01.426 A:middle
receive them and you'll have

00:12:01.426 --> 00:12:03.596 A:middle
helpful filters where you can

00:12:03.596 --> 00:12:05.346 A:middle
find feedback that's important

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:06.976 A:middle
to you.

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:08.316 A:middle
Each feedback submission will

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.076 A:middle
include details about the tester

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:12.626 A:middle
and their device and each

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:13.606 A:middle
feedback will be available to

00:12:13.606 --> 00:12:15.176 A:middle
download in a zip file.

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.836 A:middle
And in cases where you want to

00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:19.656 A:middle
stop receiving feedback, you can

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:20.496 A:middle
disable it too.

00:12:21.036 --> 00:12:21.976 A:middle
So let's take a look at these in

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:22.616 A:middle
more detail.

00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:25.426 A:middle
To manage your crash feedback

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
just select the Crashes tab in

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.486 A:middle
TestFlight and from here you'll

00:12:29.486 --> 00:12:31.766 A:middle
view detailed information about

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.116 A:middle
all the crashes you've received

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:33.916 A:middle
from your testers.

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:36.636 A:middle
You can filter crashes by things

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.486 A:middle
like App Version, Build Version

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:40.306 A:middle
or Device Model to help find

00:12:40.346 --> 00:12:41.606 A:middle
specific crashes you're looking

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:44.596 A:middle
for, and each piece of feedback

00:12:44.966 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
contains useful details about

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.456 A:middle
the tester and their device at

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:49.726 A:middle
the time of the crash.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.056 A:middle
So you'll find things like

00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:53.686 A:middle
connection type and free disk

00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:55.236 A:middle
space available or even the

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
battery life of the device when

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:58.336 A:middle
the app crashed.

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:00.096 A:middle
And if you need to share

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:00.096 A:middle
And if you need to share

00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.796 A:middle
feedback with members of your

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:03.076 A:middle
team outside of App Store

00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:05.466 A:middle
Connect, you can download a zip

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:07.766 A:middle
file too and it'll include

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:09.416 A:middle
everything you see plus the

00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:10.896 A:middle
crash log when the crash

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:11.456 A:middle
happened.

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:13.686 A:middle
Now it's even easier for you to

00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:14.926 A:middle
track down what caused your app

00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:15.586 A:middle
to crash.

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:18.576 A:middle
So what about the screenshots

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.166 A:middle
that your testers send you?

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:22.436 A:middle
Those live in the Screenshots

00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:23.476 A:middle
Tab in TestFlight.

00:13:24.006 --> 00:13:26.346 A:middle
You'll be able to find a gallery

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:28.926 A:middle
of screenshots feedback that

00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:30.086 A:middle
your testers have submitted.

00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:32.746 A:middle
Just like in crashes you can

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:34.466 A:middle
filter screenshots by some

00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:35.466 A:middle
helpful filters.

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:37.526 A:middle
For example, you may want to

00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:38.826 A:middle
look for some feedback from

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:40.436 A:middle
testers using different devices

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:41.576 A:middle
than the ones you normally build

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:41.886 A:middle
with.

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:45.166 A:middle
So you can select the device

00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:47.226 A:middle
like the iPhone SD, for example.

00:13:48.576 --> 00:13:50.066 A:middle
And now filtered you can

00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:52.096 A:middle
discover any issues on smaller

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:52.596 A:middle
screens.

00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:54.166 A:middle
So here we see a couple of

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.406 A:middle
screenshots testers have sent

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:56.746 A:middle
about Forest Explorer.

00:13:57.846 --> 00:13:58.966 A:middle
Let's take a look at one more

00:13:58.966 --> 00:13:59.556 A:middle
detail.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.466 A:middle
This tester is reporting a major

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.156 A:middle
layout issue similar to the one

00:14:04.156 --> 00:14:05.086 A:middle
we saw earlier.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:09.156 A:middle
Screenshot feedbacks contain the

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:10.776 A:middle
same helpful details that you'll

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:11.926 A:middle
find in crash feedback.

00:14:13.056 --> 00:14:13.896 A:middle
So you'll find things like

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:15.946 A:middle
screen resolution, device model

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:18.026 A:middle
or iOS version of the device.

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:20.046 A:middle
So paired with screenshots

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.486 A:middle
you'll be able to better

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.056 A:middle
troubleshoot the testers

00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:23.506 A:middle
feedback.

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:26.816 A:middle
You can also download a zip file

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.586 A:middle
too and it'll include all the

00:14:28.586 --> 00:14:29.516 A:middle
screenshots you see in

00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:32.196 A:middle
TestFlight plus the details that

00:14:32.196 --> 00:14:33.156 A:middle
are in App Store Connect.

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
If at any point you want to stop

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.636 A:middle
collecting feedback, you can

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.306 A:middle
disable it at the tester group

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:41.756 A:middle
level.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:43.976 A:middle
This means that your testers

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.396 A:middle
will no longer see the

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:47.406 A:middle
onboarding screen or be able to

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.026 A:middle
send you feedback from directly

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:50.606 A:middle
within your app, but you can

00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:52.146 A:middle
re-enable this at any time.

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:55.266 A:middle
So these are some of the ways

00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:57.026 A:middle
you can manage feedback that you

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:58.696 A:middle
receive through TestFlight and

00:14:58.696 --> 00:14:59.296 A:middle
App Store Connect.

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:01.526 A:middle
With all these improvements,

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.546 A:middle
you'll be able to receive more

00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:05.446 A:middle
effective feedback at any point

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.506 A:middle
during the testing phase and

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.666 A:middle
testers can start sending you

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.356 A:middle
feedback today.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.106 A:middle
Anyone running iOS 13 will be

00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:14.416 A:middle
able to use all of these new

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:15.546 A:middle
features in TestFlight.

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.686 A:middle
We're really excited about

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:21.206 A:middle
TestFlight feedback, and we want

00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:22.976 A:middle
to start receiving feedback from

00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:23.516 A:middle
you too.

00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:26.766 A:middle
So today we're announcing the

00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:28.476 A:middle
TestFlight Beta Program.

00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:30.486 A:middle
This means that you can get

00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:32.106 A:middle
early versions of TestFlight for

00:15:32.106 --> 00:15:34.256 A:middle
iOS, test the latest features

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:35.666 A:middle
and give us feedback.

00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:38.036 A:middle
You can sign up for the beta on

00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:39.876 A:middle
a Developer Downloads Page.

00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:41.776 A:middle
We're excited to receive

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.306 A:middle
feedback and help improve

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:44.656 A:middle
TestFlight even more.

00:15:45.116 --> 00:15:46.626 A:middle
Thank you so much, and I'll give

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:47.676 A:middle
the stage back to Tommy.

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:54.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:55.886 A:middle
Thanks, Pyam.

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.456 A:middle
Those are great new ways to

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.116 A:middle
receive feedback about your beta

00:15:59.116 --> 00:15:59.496 A:middle
apps.

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:01.756 A:middle
After you've received feedback

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:01.756 A:middle
After you've received feedback

00:16:01.826 --> 00:16:03.306 A:middle
and you've iterated on your app,

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:05.456 A:middle
it's time to transition to the

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:08.056 A:middle
App Store, but first something

00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:09.956 A:middle
you'll likely think about is how

00:16:09.956 --> 00:16:10.686 A:middle
to price your app.

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:13.646 A:middle
The App Store enables you to

00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:16.156 A:middle
generate sales globally to

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:18.556 A:middle
millions of customers in 155

00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:19.266 A:middle
territories.

00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:22.076 A:middle
We ensure that you can do

00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:23.736 A:middle
business with as many customers

00:16:23.736 --> 00:16:25.876 A:middle
as possible by consistently

00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:27.256 A:middle
adding support for new payment

00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:29.716 A:middle
methods so customers can pay for

00:16:29.716 --> 00:16:31.156 A:middle
your app in whichever method

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:31.686 A:middle
they prefer.

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.796 A:middle
And with new support for the

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:36.696 A:middle
Korean won, you can now generate

00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.706 A:middle
sales across 45 unique

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.316 A:middle
currencies.

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:42.446 A:middle
Although you can generate sales

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:44.246 A:middle
across all currencies, your

00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:45.326 A:middle
business doesn't need to handle

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:48.326 A:middle
payment for all them because we

00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:50.106 A:middle
consolidate all of your proceeds

00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:51.736 A:middle
into a single payment to your

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:52.306 A:middle
bank account.

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:55.106 A:middle
For those of you who offer

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:57.746 A:middle
subscriptions you have 200

00:16:57.746 --> 00:16:58.936 A:middle
different price tiers to choose

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.016 A:middle
from, and we recently released a

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.016 A:middle
from, and we recently released a

00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:03.436 A:middle
feature called Subscription

00:17:03.436 --> 00:17:03.986 A:middle
Offers.

00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:06.915 A:middle
These allow you to offer a

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:08.746 A:middle
discount or free period of

00:17:08.746 --> 00:17:11.996 A:middle
service for subscriptions and

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.636 A:middle
you decide which subscribers

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.846 A:middle
qualify for the offer.

00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:18.336 A:middle
This is a great way to retain

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.406 A:middle
existing subscribers or to win

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:22.935 A:middle
back previous subscribers.

00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:30.026 A:middle
There's a lot of great ways to

00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:31.576 A:middle
utilize subscriptions, but I

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:32.726 A:middle
won't go into detail here

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.106 A:middle
because we have two sessions on

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:35.396 A:middle
this tomorrow, and I encourage

00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:39.206 A:middle
you to check these out.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:40.546 A:middle
Now you've nailed down the

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:42.216 A:middle
pricing strategy and next

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:43.236 A:middle
there's something equally

00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:45.456 A:middle
important to think about and

00:17:45.456 --> 00:17:46.286 A:middle
that's how your app is

00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:47.696 A:middle
represented in the App Store

00:17:47.696 --> 00:17:49.106 A:middle
Product Page.

00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.946 A:middle
This involves app naming,

00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:54.786 A:middle
description and keywords which

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.396 A:middle
make it easier for customers to

00:17:56.396 --> 00:17:59.246 A:middle
discover your app and when it

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.856 A:middle
comes to reaching as many people

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.856 A:middle
comes to reaching as many people

00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:03.036 A:middle
as possible, a key aspect is

00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:03.886 A:middle
localization.

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:07.306 A:middle
If we take English as an

00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:09.456 A:middle
example, only about 5% of the

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.486 A:middle
world speaks English as a first

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:11.886 A:middle
language.

00:18:12.576 --> 00:18:13.866 A:middle
So when you localize your

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:15.246 A:middle
product page there's a huge

00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:16.776 A:middle
opportunity to reach more

00:18:16.776 --> 00:18:17.106 A:middle
people.

00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:20.746 A:middle
We focus on supporting a lot of

00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:22.336 A:middle
languages, and we recently added

00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:23.106 A:middle
support for more.

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:24.626 A:middle
To tell you more about these

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.186 A:middle
languages and how you localize

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.596 A:middle
your product page, I'd like to

00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:28.486 A:middle
invite Ethar [phonetic] on

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:28.906 A:middle
stage.

[ Applause ]

00:18:37.106 --> 00:18:37.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Tommy.

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:38.796 A:middle
Salam everyone.

00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:40.646 A:middle
My name is Ethar Elsaka [assumed

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:42.476 A:middle
spelling], and I'm an engineer

00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:43.546 A:middle
on App Store Connect.

00:18:44.316 --> 00:18:46.436 A:middle
Today we will talk about a very

00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:48.066 A:middle
exciting feature related to your

00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:48.896 A:middle
apps metadata.

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:51.686 A:middle
We believe that localization is

00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:54.586 A:middle
the key aspect for making your

00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:56.396 A:middle
apps more accessible to the

00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:57.266 A:middle
global audience.

00:18:57.876 --> 00:18:59.866 A:middle
We are always working hard to

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.696 A:middle
introduce new language support

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.696 A:middle
introduce new language support

00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:04.976 A:middle
and just this past year we

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.876 A:middle
introduced nine new languages

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:09.826 A:middle
bringing the total number of

00:19:09.826 --> 00:19:12.276 A:middle
languages supported by the App

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.976 A:middle
Store to 37 languages.

[ Applause ]

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.286 A:middle
Actually let me pause here and

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.106 A:middle
give you a pop quiz.

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:27.086 A:middle
Who knows what does aikhtibar

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:27.396 A:middle
[phonetic] mean?

And what about tatbiq?

00:19:35.636 --> 00:19:37.606 A:middle
So here is your first Arabic

lesson.

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:41.206 A:middle
Aikhtibar means test and tatbiq

00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:42.826 A:middle
means app.

00:19:42.826 --> 00:19:44.436 A:middle
If you wonder why I give you

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:46.446 A:middle
this Arabic quiz, this is

00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:48.016 A:middle
because Arabic is one of the

00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:50.666 A:middle
right to left languages and

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:53.076 A:middle
today I'm very excited to share

00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:55.346 A:middle
that for the first time in the

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:58.706 A:middle
App Store with iOS 13 we are

00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.966 A:middle

preferred language.

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:24.496 A:middle
As you can imagine, this is not

00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:27.036 A:middle
a small effort and it requires

00:20:27.136 --> 00:20:29.316 A:middle
a rethink of almost every

00:20:29.316 --> 00:20:30.956 A:middle
aspect of display and

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:33.126 A:middle

and editorial artwork.

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:42.766 A:middle
We believe that the presence of

00:20:42.766 --> 00:20:45.416 A:middle
localized app and editorial

00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:48.106 A:middle
content will lead to a deeper

00:20:48.106 --> 00:20:50.186 A:middle
and more integrated experience

can do that.

a great way to improve

Now you've built and iterated on

your app, you've set a pricing

00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:42.066 A:middle

please test your app on a device

there are any issues.

login, well, that's something

00:25:13.896 --> 00:25:15.056 A:middle

When requesting access to user

00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:00.976 A:middle
data, you need to provide

purpose strings that clearly

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.646 A:middle
describe how your app will use

Now that your app has been

reviewed you're ready for the

00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:21.136 A:middle
App Store and after your app has

00:26:21.136 --> 00:26:22.326 A:middle
spent some time on the store,

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.166 A:middle
you'll start to receive customer

A great way to see and respond

00:26:37.976 --> 00:26:39.046 A:middle
immediately when your app

receives a new review.

It's also important to mention

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.346 A:middle
that App Store Connect for iOS

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.786 A:middle
is now a localized app with

support for 14 languages so you

00:26:51.936 --> 00:26:53.646 A:middle
can see that localization is an

00:26:53.646 --> 00:26:55.336 A:middle
important area of focus for all

In addition to customer reviews,

00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:04.026 A:middle
you have another important tool

00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:05.636 A:middle
that can help you decide where

to place your development

00:27:09.846 --> 00:27:12.396 A:middle
With App Analytics you get a

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.386 A:middle
for Mac will include

00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.346 A:middle
Impressions, which is the number

00:27:35.346 --> 00:27:36.876 A:middle
of times your app icon has been

00:27:36.876 --> 00:27:37.576 A:middle
viewed in the store.

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:41.116 A:middle
Product Page Views is the number

00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:42.266 A:middle
of times your product page has

00:27:42.266 --> 00:27:43.306 A:middle
been viewed.

00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:46.076 A:middle
App Units shows how many times

00:27:46.076 --> 00:27:47.256 A:middle
your app was downloaded from the

00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:47.566 A:middle
store.

00:27:49.676 --> 00:27:52.246 A:middle
And Sales will capture the total

00:27:52.246 --> 00:27:54.426 A:middle
amount billed through purchases

00:27:54.426 --> 00:27:55.596 A:middle
and in-app purchases.

00:27:57.836 --> 00:27:59.546 A:middle
We're also introducing a

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
completely new metric for iOS

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
completely new metric for iOS

00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:04.086 A:middle
Apps called App Deletions.

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:06.866 A:middle
this will allow you to see the

00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:08.356 A:middle
number of times your app is

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:09.916 A:middle
uninstalled from customer's

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:10.426 A:middle
devices.

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:14.286 A:middle
You might use this to correlate

00:28:14.286 --> 00:28:16.636 A:middle
deletions with an issue in a

00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:19.586 A:middle
recent version of your app.

00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:21.706 A:middle
Or another interesting view is

00:28:21.706 --> 00:28:23.886 A:middle
Deletions by Source Type which

00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:25.526 A:middle
shows if a given source is

00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.136 A:middle
better able to retain customers

00:28:27.896 --> 00:28:29.856 A:middle
or what source is resulting in

00:28:29.856 --> 00:28:30.746 A:middle
the most deletions.

00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:35.036 A:middle
There's one more exciting

00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:37.206 A:middle
announcement about Sales Data.

00:28:37.856 --> 00:28:39.776 A:middle
This is an entirely new time

00:28:39.776 --> 00:28:41.716 A:middle
range and level of granularity

00:28:41.746 --> 00:28:45.176 A:middle
for your sales data, the 24-Hour

00:28:45.176 --> 00:28:45.746 A:middle
Dashboard.

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:49.416 A:middle
This gives you an hour by hour

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:51.576 A:middle
view into the last 24 hours of

00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:52.526 A:middle
sales performance.

00:28:55.336 --> 00:28:55.736 A:middle

00:28:58.256 --> 00:28:59.766 A:middle
You no longer have to wait until

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:01.346 A:middle
the next business day to view

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:01.346 A:middle
the next business day to view

00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:02.026 A:middle
your sales data.

00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:04.096 A:middle
Let's take a look at the new

00:29:04.096 --> 00:29:04.596 A:middle
dashboard.

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:08.046 A:middle
Here we're looking at a sales

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.366 A:middle
overview within Sales and

00:29:09.366 --> 00:29:11.296 A:middle
Trends, and we see sales data

00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:13.126 A:middle
for the last 7 days.

00:29:13.736 --> 00:29:15.516 A:middle
If you filter this view, you can

00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:17.156 A:middle
narrow it down to a handful of

00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:18.756 A:middle
specific in-app purchases.

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:20.876 A:middle
At the bottom of the list we see

00:29:20.876 --> 00:29:22.526 A:middle
a new in-app purchase that is

00:29:22.526 --> 00:29:23.276 A:middle
just released today.

00:29:23.276 --> 00:29:26.336 A:middle
You see that it doesn't have any

00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:27.156 A:middle
sales data yet.

00:29:28.726 --> 00:29:29.856 A:middle
This is one case where you'll

00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:31.226 A:middle
want to use the 24-Hour

00:29:31.226 --> 00:29:31.746 A:middle
Dashboard.

00:29:32.286 --> 00:29:34.936 A:middle
So if you click on the calendar

00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:36.946 A:middle
picker, you see a new option for

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:38.036 A:middle
Last 24 Hours.

00:29:39.086 --> 00:29:39.876 A:middle
That will take you to the

00:29:39.876 --> 00:29:43.026 A:middle
24-Hour Graph.

00:29:43.226 --> 00:29:45.006 A:middle
Now you can see sales data on an

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:46.916 A:middle
hourly basis and you can track

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:48.406 A:middle
the success of your brand new

00:29:48.406 --> 00:29:50.186 A:middle
in-app purchase as it rolls out

00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:50.916 A:middle
to customers.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:53.486 A:middle
You can see how this is a

00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:55.066 A:middle
powerful new way to view your

00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:55.726 A:middle
sales data.

00:29:58.516 --> 00:30:00.056 A:middle

Within the App Lifecycle that

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:02.836 A:middle
brings us back to Xcode where we

00:30:02.836 --> 00:30:03.896 A:middle
can take everything we've

00:30:03.896 --> 00:30:05.296 A:middle
learned so far and continue

00:30:05.296 --> 00:30:07.296 A:middle
creating great apps.

00:30:08.776 --> 00:30:10.766 A:middle
We have some labs tomorrow at 9

00:30:10.766 --> 00:30:12.876 A:middle
and 3, where you can come ask us

00:30:12.906 --> 00:30:14.216 A:middle
questions about anything we've

00:30:14.216 --> 00:30:15.386 A:middle
talked about.

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:18.296 A:middle
As always, I can't wait to see

00:30:18.296 --> 00:30:19.386 A:middle
what you do with these new

00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:20.176 A:middle
capabilities.

00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:21.846 A:middle
I hope all of you enjoy the rest

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:23.646 A:middle
of your time here at WWDC.

00:30:23.896 --> 00:30:24.786 A:middle
Thank you.
