[ Applause ]

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; With iOS 13, the way that we

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:14.976 A:middle
design and build apps is going

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:16.726 A:middle
to change in some subtle but

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:17.736 A:middle
significant ways.

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.796 A:middle
Dark Mode brings a new approach

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.506 A:middle
to how we work with colors,

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.296 A:middle
images, and text.

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.436 A:middle
The new card-style sheets not

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:29.536 A:middle
only present modal presentations

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:31.186 A:middle
in a different way, but they

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:32.756 A:middle
change how we interact with them

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:33.326 A:middle
as well.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.286 A:middle
And the new contextual menu

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.676 A:middle
control makes it easy to quickly

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:41.336 A:middle
access contextually relevant

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.106 A:middle
functionality with ease.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.346 A:middle
Now, between these three topics,

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:46.426 A:middle
we've got a lot of ground to

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.696 A:middle
cover, so let's dive in with

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.286 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:52.726 A:middle
Now, last year we introduced

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.606 A:middle
Dark Mode on macOS, and it was

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:56.506 A:middle
pretty popular.

00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:58.976 A:middle
For many years, photo and video

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.086 A:middle
apps have used dark interfaces

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.086 A:middle
apps have used dark interfaces

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:02.896 A:middle
because they allow people to see

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.325 A:middle
photos and videos with clarity.

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:08.066 A:middle
Dark UIs are great for dark

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.986 A:middle
lighting conditions; it's much

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.966 A:middle
easier for our eyes to adjust

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:13.896 A:middle
between a dark screen and the

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.196 A:middle
world around us.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:17.736 A:middle
And, functional reasons aside,

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:19.896 A:middle
some people just prefer dark

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
interfaces as a matter of

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.916 A:middle
personal preference.

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.776 A:middle
Dark Mode on iOS uses a fully

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:28.566 A:middle
black background to provide

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.986 A:middle
maximal contrast with text and

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:32.456 A:middle
other foreground elements.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.076 A:middle
Black backgrounds blend in

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.316 A:middle
seamlessly with the hardware

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.736 A:middle
bezel to make your UI feel more

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.476 A:middle
expansive and integrated with

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:41.426 A:middle
the hardware itself.

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:45.086 A:middle
In general, all of your apps

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:46.646 A:middle
should support Dark Mode.

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:48.566 A:middle
When the people using your app

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.046 A:middle
have set their device to be in

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:51.876 A:middle
Dark Mode, they'll expect your

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:53.416 A:middle
app to change as well.

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:55.726 A:middle
Now, supporting Dark Mode

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.966 A:middle
involves moving towards the

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.856 A:middle
updated iOS design system which

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.856 A:middle
updated iOS design system which

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:02.596 A:middle
has been fully overhauled for

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:03.576 A:middle
iOS 13.

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:05.276 A:middle
Now, just so we're all on the

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:07.246 A:middle
same page, "design system"

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:08.636 A:middle
basically just means a set of

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:11.776 A:middle
parts like colors, fonts, and

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:13.766 A:middle
glyphs that work together in a

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.526 A:middle
logical and consistent manor.

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:19.216 A:middle
A rational -- excuse me -- and

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:20.926 A:middle
consistent design system helps

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.996 A:middle
people to learn and use apps

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:23.996 A:middle
with ease.

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:26.546 A:middle
By integrating with the iOS

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:28.576 A:middle
design system, your app will

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:31.146 A:middle
feel more familiar to people and

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:32.326 A:middle
be more understandable.

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:34.746 A:middle
Now, before we get into all of

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:36.726 A:middle
the details, I'd like to share

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:38.316 A:middle
some of the key design goals

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.306 A:middle
that guided the design team's

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
efforts.

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:44.046 A:middle
First and foremost, they wanted

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.296 A:middle
iOS to remain familiar and

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:46.926 A:middle
intuitive.

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:49.486 A:middle
The iOS design system has

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.986 A:middle
received a complete makeover but

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:53.406 A:middle
the end result is still

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:54.846 A:middle
recognizably iOS.

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:58.296 A:middle
They sought to provide more

00:02:58.296 --> 00:02:59.626 A:middle
internal consistency.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.226 A:middle
All of the built-in apps were

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.016 A:middle
redesigned to bring them into

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.106 A:middle
alignment with each other, using

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:07.396 A:middle
all of the components that we'll

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.816 A:middle
be talking about with you today.

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
They also wanted the new design

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.366 A:middle
system to include a range of

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.056 A:middle
color options to help

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.776 A:middle
successfully articulate

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:19.026 A:middle
information hierarchy, to allow

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:20.746 A:middle
the most important elements to

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:23.066 A:middle
be the strongest and the less

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.566 A:middle
important elements to recede.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:27.896 A:middle
They also put accessibility on

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:29.586 A:middle
equal footing with these other

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:30.086 A:middle
goals.

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:32.846 A:middle
The new system fully supports

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.696 A:middle
bold text and increased contrast

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:37.046 A:middle
accessibility modes.

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:40.846 A:middle
And, lastly, they wanted the new

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.636 A:middle
design system to be simple,

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.706 A:middle
straightforward, and easy to

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:45.196 A:middle
implement.

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:47.896 A:middle
All right, now let's get into

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:48.636 A:middle
the specifics.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:51.606 A:middle
Color seems like the right place

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:52.036 A:middle
to start.

00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:55.746 A:middle
Every app has a background, and

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:58.256 A:middle
most apps have text and glyphs.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.676 A:middle
And some apps have separator

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.676 A:middle
And some apps have separator

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:04.096 A:middle
lines and grouping boxes to help

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:05.986 A:middle
organize all of that content.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.126 A:middle
Now, when describing these

00:04:08.126 --> 00:04:10.496 A:middle
colors, we can naturally talk

00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:12.236 A:middle
about them by their values.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.176 A:middle
The text is black, the

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.916 A:middle
background is white, etc., etc.

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:19.016 A:middle
Now, as your interface gets a

00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:20.805 A:middle
little bit more complicated, the

00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:22.125 A:middle
length of that color palette

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:23.136 A:middle
extends.

00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:25.506 A:middle
But that's not really an issue.

00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:28.356 A:middle
However, when you add support

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:31.116 A:middle
for separate appearance, you now

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:33.366 A:middle
have two parallel sets of colors

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:35.386 A:middle
to keep in sync with each other

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:35.916 A:middle
and manage.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:38.316 A:middle
At this point, it becomes

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:40.356 A:middle
helpful to think about color in

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:41.996 A:middle
a more abstract way.

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:44.636 A:middle
This is where semantic colors

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:45.176 A:middle
comes in.

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:48.346 A:middle
A semantic color describes the

00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:50.936 A:middle
purpose of a color rather than

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:52.246 A:middle
what its value is.

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:54.996 A:middle
Because semantic colors are

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:56.776 A:middle
extracted away from their exact

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
appearance, they can work both

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.766 A:middle
-- they're dynamic.

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.766 A:middle
-- they're dynamic.

00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.446 A:middle
So, a background color can be

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.726 A:middle
black in Dark Mode and white in

00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:06.946 A:middle
Light Mode.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.196 A:middle
So instead of maintaining two

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:10.656 A:middle
separate lists of colors for

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
Light and Dark Modes, you can

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:14.716 A:middle
apply semantic colors from the

00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.626 A:middle
system palette to UI elements

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:17.976 A:middle
and their appearance will

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.696 A:middle
automatically adapt between

00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:21.896 A:middle
Light and Dark Modes, which is

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
pretty convenient.

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:26.106 A:middle
iOS 13 includes a palette of

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:27.846 A:middle
semantic colors for you to use.

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:30.106 A:middle
Many of these colors have

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.476 A:middle
primary, secondary, tertiary,

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:34.136 A:middle
and quaternary values.

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:36.566 A:middle
These variants are used to

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.496 A:middle
express information hierarchy.

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:40.666 A:middle
Label color has the most

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.546 A:middle
contrast with the background, so

00:05:42.546 --> 00:05:43.586 A:middle
it's going to advance into the

00:05:43.656 --> 00:05:44.786 A:middle
foreground and grab your

00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:46.486 A:middle
attention and should be used for

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:48.236 A:middle
primary elements like titles,

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:51.016 A:middle
secondary for subtitles,

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.556 A:middle
tertiary for placeholder text,

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:55.056 A:middle
quaternary for disabled text.

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:57.916 A:middle
The same basic principle applies

00:05:57.916 --> 00:05:59.046 A:middle
to background colors.

00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:01.546 A:middle
System background is a primary

00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:01.546 A:middle
System background is a primary

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:02.926 A:middle
background color, and it's pure

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:04.286 A:middle
white in Light Mode and Pure

00:06:04.286 --> 00:06:05.326 A:middle
Black in Dark Mode.

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:08.426 A:middle
Secondary and tertiary system

00:06:08.426 --> 00:06:10.456 A:middle
background colors allow you to

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:11.876 A:middle
structure information

00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:12.856 A:middle
hierarchically.

00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:15.776 A:middle
There's also a parallel set of

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.216 A:middle
background colors for grouped

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:18.096 A:middle
table views.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.696 A:middle
Now, if you observe closely,

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:22.416 A:middle
you'll note that the colors

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.266 A:middle
aren't simply inverted between

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:25.286 A:middle
Light and Dark Modes.

00:06:25.956 --> 00:06:27.366 A:middle
The table row backgrounds are

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:28.326 A:middle
lighter in both.

00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:30.616 A:middle
There was a concerted effort to

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:32.676 A:middle
select a palette of colors that

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.836 A:middle
assured contrast while at the

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:37.036 A:middle
same time keeping apps looking

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:38.826 A:middle
similar between Light and Dark

00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:39.136 A:middle
Modes.

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:42.126 A:middle
When you're designing for Dark

00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:43.776 A:middle
Mode, it's often helpful to

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:45.126 A:middle
think about the lights as having

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:46.736 A:middle
been dimmed rather than

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.386 A:middle
everything being flipped inside

00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:49.366 A:middle
out.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:52.216 A:middle
The new system palette includes

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:53.906 A:middle
fill colors and separator

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:54.336 A:middle
colors.

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:56.656 A:middle
All of the fill colors and one

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:57.876 A:middle
of the separator colors are

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.116 A:middle
semi-transparent, which helps

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.116 A:middle
semi-transparent, which helps

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:02.056 A:middle
them to contrast well against

00:07:02.196 --> 00:07:04.066 A:middle
variable background colors.

00:07:05.346 --> 00:07:07.026 A:middle
The new palette includes six,

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:09.166 A:middle
fully opaque gray values.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.276 A:middle
These colors are best used when

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:12.426 A:middle
transparency would lead to

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:14.046 A:middle
undesirable results.

00:07:14.716 --> 00:07:16.216 A:middle
So, for example, when drawing

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:17.576 A:middle
intersecting grid lines,

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.006 A:middle
overlapping semi-transparent

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.856 A:middle
colors can create distracting

00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:23.256 A:middle
optical illusions.

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:26.896 A:middle
And, if elements overlap, solid

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:28.666 A:middle
colors are really helpful and

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:29.876 A:middle
prevent things from looking

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:31.346 A:middle
disabled or broken.

00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:34.536 A:middle
These colors are used throughout

00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:35.906 A:middle
the system for basically

00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:38.136 A:middle
everything, and we encourage you

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:39.636 A:middle
to use them in your apps.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.126 A:middle
To get you started, you can

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:44.036 A:middle
check out the full color palette

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:45.676 A:middle
in the Apple Design Resources

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:46.916 A:middle
and the Human Interface

00:07:46.956 --> 00:07:47.546 A:middle
Guidelines.

00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:49.536 A:middle
I'll have more information about

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:50.386 A:middle
those at the end of the

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.096 A:middle
presentation.

00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:53.836 A:middle
As before, we will continue to

00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:55.776 A:middle
provide tint colors for you to

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:57.456 A:middle
use as your app's tint color.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.566 A:middle
These tint colors are dynamic,

00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:01.636 A:middle
meaning that they have variants

00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:03.366 A:middle
for Light and Dark Modes.

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:05.776 A:middle
Each tint color has

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.256 A:middle
high-contrast variants.

00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:09.046 A:middle
When they increase contrast,

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:10.836 A:middle
accessibility setting is

00:08:10.836 --> 00:08:11.326 A:middle
enabled.

00:08:12.796 --> 00:08:14.516 A:middle
Tint colors get lighter in Dark

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.386 A:middle
Mode and darker in Light Mode.

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:20.566 A:middle
Now, if you opt to pick your own

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:22.766 A:middle
tint color, try to select colors

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:24.336 A:middle
that work well in both modes.

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:27.266 A:middle
A color that works well in Light

00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:28.676 A:middle
Mode, though, might have

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:30.986 A:middle
insufficient contrast in Dark

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:32.956 A:middle
Mode, and vice versa.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.626 A:middle
Even when colors seem to you

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:36.696 A:middle
like they're going to work well

00:08:36.696 --> 00:08:38.856 A:middle
in both modes, it's always best

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:40.145 A:middle
to check your colors with an

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.635 A:middle
online color contrast

00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:42.376 A:middle
calculator.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.756 A:middle
Now, because tint colors can be

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:47.066 A:middle
dynamic, you can have two

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:48.746 A:middle
slightly different colors for

00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:51.016 A:middle
Light and Dark Modes, and when

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:52.816 A:middle
you're picking those colors, aim

00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:55.736 A:middle
for a contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:56.726 A:middle
or higher.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.636 A:middle
Strong color contrast improves

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.636 A:middle
Strong color contrast improves

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:02.666 A:middle
the accessibility and usability

00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:04.416 A:middle
of your apps.

00:09:04.936 --> 00:09:06.406 A:middle
The system palette should

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:08.036 A:middle
basically have you covered for

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:08.956 A:middle
most of your needs.

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:11.336 A:middle
But, of course, you're going to

00:09:11.336 --> 00:09:12.766 A:middle
have to define your own colors

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:13.316 A:middle
as well.

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:16.046 A:middle
Perhaps you have user-selectable

00:09:16.046 --> 00:09:17.696 A:middle
label colors or status

00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:18.316 A:middle
indicators.

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:20.906 A:middle
As with tint colors, any color

00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:21.686 A:middle
can be dynamic.

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:24.226 A:middle
Given that the perception of

00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:25.806 A:middle
color is influenced by the

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:26.896 A:middle
background that it's shown

00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:28.886 A:middle
against, you'll want to make

00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:30.836 A:middle
some adjustments to help keep

00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.356 A:middle
those color values looking

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:35.026 A:middle
similar between modes or to make

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:36.006 A:middle
sure that there's enough

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:37.816 A:middle
contrast in both modes.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.696 A:middle
Now, all this time I've been

00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:42.256 A:middle
talking about Light and Dark

00:09:42.306 --> 00:09:44.296 A:middle
Modes, and as you may know,

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.236 A:middle
that's a little bit of an

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:46.426 A:middle
oversimplification.

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:48.566 A:middle
There's actually two sets of

00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:49.906 A:middle
background colors that are

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:52.176 A:middle
called "base" and "elevated."

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.256 A:middle
As the names imply, these

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.916 A:middle
background colors are about

00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.396 A:middle
layering interfaces.

00:09:59.596 --> 00:10:01.606 A:middle
When two light interfaces are

00:09:59.596 --> 00:10:01.606 A:middle
When two light interfaces are

00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:04.026 A:middle
layered, a simple, diffuse drop

00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:06.166 A:middle
shadow is all you need to create

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.746 A:middle
visual separation between the

00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:08.106 A:middle
two.

00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:10.816 A:middle
With dark interfaces, drop

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:12.446 A:middle
shadows are slightly less

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.046 A:middle
effective.

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:17.036 A:middle
System background colors will

00:10:17.036 --> 00:10:19.416 A:middle
use the darker or base values

00:10:19.416 --> 00:10:20.726 A:middle
for background apps or

00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:22.716 A:middle
interfaces and the lighter,

00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:24.446 A:middle
elevated values for apps or

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.226 A:middle
interfaces that are in the

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:26.756 A:middle
foreground.

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:29.076 A:middle
So take, for example, the

00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:29.866 A:middle
Contacts app.

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:31.936 A:middle
It's using the base set of color

00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:33.496 A:middle
values when drawn on its own,

00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.416 A:middle
but when the same interface is

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:36.496 A:middle
brought up in a modal

00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:38.156 A:middle
presentation in the phone app,

00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:40.456 A:middle
it uses the elevated background

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:40.846 A:middle
colors.

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:43.106 A:middle
Okay, let's look at a slightly

00:10:43.106 --> 00:10:44.396 A:middle
more complicated example.

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:47.146 A:middle
Here's Mail running on an iPad.

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.036 A:middle
On its own, Mail is drawn using

00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:51.436 A:middle
the base set of background

00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:51.826 A:middle
colors.

00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:54.446 A:middle
When we bring in Contacts in a

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.186 A:middle
slide-over, we see that it's

00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:57.706 A:middle
being drawn with the elevated

00:10:57.706 --> 00:10:59.066 A:middle
set of background colors.

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:02.336 A:middle
Now, the lighter appearance of

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:02.336 A:middle
Now, the lighter appearance of

00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:04.526 A:middle
contacts helps it stand out from

00:11:04.526 --> 00:11:06.516 A:middle
Mail and advances it into the

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:07.136 A:middle
foreground.

00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:11.046 A:middle
When Contacts is displayed side

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
by side in multitasking with

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:14.946 A:middle
Mail, they are both drawn with

00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:16.416 A:middle
the elevated set of background

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:16.886 A:middle
colors.

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:19.186 A:middle
This helps provide contrast with

00:11:19.186 --> 00:11:20.836 A:middle
that splitter down the middle

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:22.826 A:middle
and keeps the two apps from

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:24.176 A:middle
blending together.

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:27.556 A:middle
When we compose an email in

00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:29.036 A:middle
Mail, it comes up in a sheet.

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:31.136 A:middle
This too is drawn with the

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:33.636 A:middle
elevated background colors, but

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:35.366 A:middle
the main app UI Mail looks a

00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:37.286 A:middle
little bit darker because modal

00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:39.486 A:middle
presentations draw an overlay

00:11:39.486 --> 00:11:41.036 A:middle
layer to dim their background

00:11:41.036 --> 00:11:43.796 A:middle
content and they cast a little

00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:45.736 A:middle
bit of a drop shadow.

00:11:45.926 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
Now, because background colors

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:48.606 A:middle
change when your app is

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.756 A:middle
elevated, you have to be mindful

00:11:50.756 --> 00:11:52.316 A:middle
that some of the darker colors

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:53.626 A:middle
that you might use, even from

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.216 A:middle
the system palette, may not

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:56.156 A:middle
contrast well.

00:11:56.586 --> 00:11:58.176 A:middle
You always have to check your

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
designs when they're in elevated

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
designs when they're in elevated

00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:01.166 A:middle
state.

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:04.906 A:middle
Again, semi-opaque fill and

00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:06.336 A:middle
separator colors are going to be

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:07.336 A:middle
your best friends here.

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.486 A:middle
They adapt gracefully between

00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:11.556 A:middle
base and elevated backgrounds.

00:12:12.656 --> 00:12:15.566 A:middle
Okay, moving on to materials.

00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:18.386 A:middle
Materials have been overhauled

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:20.336 A:middle
and refined with iOS 13.

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:22.566 A:middle
There are now four materials for

00:12:22.566 --> 00:12:24.496 A:middle
you to choose from with a range

00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:27.106 A:middle
of translucency levels: thick,

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.816 A:middle
regular, thin, and ultra-thin.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.446 A:middle
These materials have been

00:12:33.446 --> 00:12:34.926 A:middle
designed to work well against a

00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:36.856 A:middle
variety of background contexts.

00:12:37.816 --> 00:12:39.136 A:middle
Their appearance will change

00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:41.416 A:middle
dynamically based on whether

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.746 A:middle
someone is using your app in

00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:43.816 A:middle
Light or Dark Mode.

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:45.986 A:middle
You can select which material

00:12:45.986 --> 00:12:47.196 A:middle
you want based on how much

00:12:47.296 --> 00:12:48.956 A:middle
separation you want from the

00:12:48.956 --> 00:12:50.936 A:middle
background, how much is most

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.566 A:middle
appropriate.

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.446 A:middle
The default material is regular,

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:55.966 A:middle
and it's going to work well in

00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:57.246 A:middle
most circumstances.

00:12:57.906 --> 00:12:59.526 A:middle
But if you're presenting content

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
against this material that needs

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
against this material that needs

00:13:01.826 --> 00:13:03.136 A:middle
a little bit more contrast, you

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:04.696 A:middle
can use the thicker material.

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.326 A:middle
For lighter-weight interactions,

00:13:07.326 --> 00:13:10.206 A:middle
maybe with simpler content, thin

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.476 A:middle
and ultra-thin might be the

00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:12.226 A:middle
right way to go.

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:14.226 A:middle
Which material is right for your

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.916 A:middle
app just really depends on the

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.376 A:middle
content that's being displayed

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.386 A:middle
inside of it.

00:13:19.476 --> 00:13:21.536 A:middle
Speaking of which, light and

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:22.536 A:middle
dark materials have an

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:24.166 A:middle
accompanying set of vibrancy

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:26.466 A:middle
values for labels, fills, and

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:27.516 A:middle
separator colors.

00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.796 A:middle
Vibrancy is a visual affect

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:31.816 A:middle
that's used throughout iOS and

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:33.136 A:middle
other Apple platforms.

00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:35.576 A:middle
With system materials, it's

00:13:35.676 --> 00:13:37.726 A:middle
typically best to use vibrancy

00:13:38.086 --> 00:13:39.546 A:middle
rather than solid colors.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.146 A:middle
Because depending on the

00:13:41.146 --> 00:13:43.716 A:middle
background context, solid colors

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.496 A:middle
can get really muddy and can

00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:47.886 A:middle
lead to some serious legibility

00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:48.356 A:middle
issues.

00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:51.166 A:middle
Vibrancy helps to maintain that

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.186 A:middle
contrast regardless of what's in

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:53.756 A:middle
the background.

00:13:54.906 --> 00:13:56.666 A:middle
The updated visual design system

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:59.076 A:middle
for iOS also includes changes to

00:13:59.076 --> 00:14:01.236 A:middle
controls and bars.

00:13:59.076 --> 00:14:01.236 A:middle
controls and bars.

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:05.036 A:middle
Visual attributes like shape and

00:14:05.036 --> 00:14:07.006 A:middle
color have been brought into

00:14:07.406 --> 00:14:08.816 A:middle
greater alignment for more

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:10.846 A:middle
internal consistency.

00:14:11.606 --> 00:14:13.096 A:middle
Controls are now drawn with

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.156 A:middle
semantic colors so that they

00:14:15.156 --> 00:14:17.066 A:middle
gracefully adapt between Light

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:18.346 A:middle
and Dark Modes.

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:22.216 A:middle
If you use UIKit controls, you

00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:23.786 A:middle
get the benefits of all of this

00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:24.286 A:middle
for free.

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:27.276 A:middle
If you spent time recreating

00:14:27.276 --> 00:14:28.976 A:middle
what UIKit gives you for free,

00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:31.456 A:middle
with custom controls, you may

00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:33.736 A:middle
want to, I don't know how to say

00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:34.836 A:middle
this, but stop doing that.

00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:37.516 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:41.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.216 A:middle
Recreating what UIKit gives you

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:47.396 A:middle
for free takes a lot of effort

00:14:47.396 --> 00:14:48.966 A:middle
and time, it's hard to do right,

00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:50.636 A:middle
and there's very little upside

00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:51.026 A:middle
for you.

00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:54.566 A:middle
But of course, custom controls

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.776 A:middle
are often necessary.

00:14:56.116 --> 00:14:57.506 A:middle
UIKit does not provide

00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:58.816 A:middle
everything that you need.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.646 A:middle
For example, UIKit doesn't

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.646 A:middle
For example, UIKit doesn't

00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:02.046 A:middle
provide a rating indicator.

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:03.766 A:middle
So, when you're making custom

00:15:03.766 --> 00:15:05.956 A:middle
controls, you should use the

00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:08.076 A:middle
system palette so that you don't

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:09.386 A:middle
have to do two different color

00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:10.776 A:middle
treatments for Light and Dark

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:11.216 A:middle
Mode.

00:15:12.686 --> 00:15:14.776 A:middle
Navigation bars have also been

00:15:14.776 --> 00:15:15.426 A:middle
updated.

00:15:16.006 --> 00:15:17.546 A:middle
By default, they're now drawn

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.406 A:middle
for large titles without the

00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:21.186 A:middle
background and shadow.

00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:24.596 A:middle
This allows the title to connect

00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:26.636 A:middle
seamlessly with the content that

00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:27.426 A:middle
it's labeling.

00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:30.586 A:middle
When content scrolls underneath

00:15:30.636 --> 00:15:32.026 A:middle
the navigation bar, the

00:15:32.026 --> 00:15:33.596 A:middle
background and shadow will fade

00:15:33.596 --> 00:15:34.126 A:middle
back in.

00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:36.616 A:middle
Now, large title bars,

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:38.866 A:middle
navigation bars work especially

00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:40.226 A:middle
well with this visual treatment,

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:42.256 A:middle
but it can be used for default

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:43.616 A:middle
navigation bars as well.

00:15:44.346 --> 00:15:45.406 A:middle
So, in the Settings app, for

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:47.366 A:middle
example, the master view's

00:15:47.366 --> 00:15:49.006 A:middle
navigation bar uses a large

00:15:49.006 --> 00:15:51.006 A:middle
title and it has no background

00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:51.606 A:middle
or shadow.

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.646 A:middle
The standard navigation bar is

00:15:54.646 --> 00:15:56.226 A:middle
stylized to match.

00:15:57.346 --> 00:15:59.006 A:middle
Now, while a seamless navigation

00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:01.196 A:middle
bar looks great, it's not always

00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:01.196 A:middle
bar looks great, it's not always

00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:02.376 A:middle
going to be appropriate.

00:16:03.076 --> 00:16:04.706 A:middle
That background is completely

00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:06.056 A:middle
transparent, so if you've tucked

00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:07.056 A:middle
anything underneath the

00:16:07.056 --> 00:16:08.526 A:middle
navigation bar, it's going to

00:16:08.526 --> 00:16:10.366 A:middle
show right through, and it's

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:11.586 A:middle
probably not going to look very

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:13.836 A:middle
good so don't use a treatment

00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:14.156 A:middle
then.

00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:16.336 A:middle
And if you have a really dense

00:16:16.336 --> 00:16:17.736 A:middle
interface with a lot of controls

00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:19.126 A:middle
and navigation bar next to the

00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:21.666 A:middle
content area, the clear visual

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.286 A:middle
delineation that's provided by

00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:24.746 A:middle
that shadow can be really

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:24.976 A:middle
helpful.

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:28.286 A:middle
Okay. So, before we move on,

00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:30.016 A:middle
there's one more big feature

00:16:30.016 --> 00:16:31.166 A:middle
that I'd like to discuss with

00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:34.426 A:middle
you related to Dark Mode.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.006 A:middle
iOS has always provided a

00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:37.926 A:middle
handful of symbols for things

00:16:37.926 --> 00:16:39.666 A:middle
like table rows and toolbars.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.696 A:middle
When shown against a dark

00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.686 A:middle
background, the previous set of

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:45.516 A:middle
symbols did not hold up very

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:47.836 A:middle
well; they often looked a little

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:48.576 A:middle
too thin.

00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
So, the design team redesigned

00:16:52.186 --> 00:16:53.856 A:middle
all of the symbols in this

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:54.756 A:middle
design system.

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:57.486 A:middle
And what's really cool, as many

00:16:57.486 --> 00:16:59.196 A:middle
of you may know already, we're

00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.606 A:middle
making all of those glyphs

00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.606 A:middle
making all of those glyphs

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:02.586 A:middle
available for you to use with SF

00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:03.316 A:middle
Symbols.

00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:07.256 A:middle
SF Symbols includes over 1500

00:17:07.256 --> 00:17:07.695 A:middle
symbols.

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:10.455 A:middle
And this isn't just a new set of

00:17:10.536 --> 00:17:12.646 A:middle
glyphs; this represents a

00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:14.746 A:middle
completely new way to think

00:17:14.746 --> 00:17:16.665 A:middle
about and design glyphs.

00:17:17.656 --> 00:17:19.856 A:middle
As the name suggests, SF Symbols

00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:21.965 A:middle
are designed to match the visual

00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:23.996 A:middle
design characteristics of San

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:26.566 A:middle
Francisco, the system font for

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:28.816 A:middle
iOS and other Apple platforms.

00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:31.796 A:middle
They can literally be typed out

00:17:32.046 --> 00:17:33.416 A:middle
so that they can be displayed

00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:34.936 A:middle
inline with text.

00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:37.236 A:middle
They have imbedded baseline

00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:39.446 A:middle
values to assure proper vertical

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:41.036 A:middle
alignment relative to text.

00:17:41.876 --> 00:17:43.416 A:middle
And every SF symbol offers

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:46.226 A:middle
small, medium and large-scale

00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:48.046 A:middle
variants relative to the current

00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:50.096 A:middle
size for different contexts.

00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:52.956 A:middle
And every symbol comes in nine

00:17:52.956 --> 00:17:54.876 A:middle
weights just like the SF font.

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.976 A:middle
Because they're vector based, SF

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
Symbols can scale with text when

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
Symbols can scale with text when

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:03.736 A:middle
used with dynamic type.

00:18:03.936 --> 00:18:05.956 A:middle
And by offering multiple

00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:07.766 A:middle
weights, SF Symbols will become

00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:09.886 A:middle
bolder when the bold text

00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:11.396 A:middle
accessibility setting is

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:11.846 A:middle
enabled.

00:18:13.156 --> 00:18:14.926 A:middle
Now, when designing comps of

00:18:14.926 --> 00:18:17.326 A:middle
your app, you can use the new SF

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:19.216 A:middle
Symbols app to browse or search

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:21.256 A:middle
for symbols, copy the ones that

00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:23.266 A:middle
you want to use, go over to your

00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:25.146 A:middle
design comp, and just paste them

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.676 A:middle
in to a text layer.

00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:29.796 A:middle
The updated iOS Apple Design

00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:32.106 A:middle
Resources for Sketch is already

00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:33.686 A:middle
set up to work with symbols.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.026 A:middle
To swap out the symbols for this

00:18:36.066 --> 00:18:38.316 A:middle
tab bar, for example, you just

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:40.696 A:middle
select the tab bar, go to the

00:18:40.696 --> 00:18:43.256 A:middle
inspector, and paste it in to an

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:44.706 A:middle
override for the buttons.

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:46.886 A:middle
I've been playing with this

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:48.706 A:middle
feature for a few months now,

00:18:49.126 --> 00:18:50.656 A:middle
and I have to tell you, it's

00:18:50.656 --> 00:18:51.916 A:middle
totally game-changing.

00:18:52.946 --> 00:18:54.296 A:middle
Now, if the set of symbols that

00:18:54.356 --> 00:18:56.216 A:middle
we provide, 1500, isn't enough,

00:18:56.646 --> 00:18:57.836 A:middle
you can actually generate a

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:59.686 A:middle
template in SVG, go into

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:01.536 A:middle
Illustrator or Sketch and make

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:01.536 A:middle
Illustrator or Sketch and make

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:03.236 A:middle
modifications to design your own

00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:04.926 A:middle
and get all the same benefits

00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:06.096 A:middle
that I just described.

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:07.546 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:11.486 A:middle
Okay. Now moving on to modal

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:12.246 A:middle
presentations.

00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:15.136 A:middle
Modal presentations are often

00:19:15.136 --> 00:19:17.056 A:middle
called sheets because of the way

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:18.896 A:middle
they slide up over the screen.

00:19:19.646 --> 00:19:21.406 A:middle
This animation informs people

00:19:21.636 --> 00:19:23.046 A:middle
that they've shifted from one

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:25.816 A:middle
mode to another or into a new

00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:27.246 A:middle
modality of your app.

00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:31.346 A:middle
With iOS 13, sheets have a new

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:33.686 A:middle
card-like appearance that's used

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:34.606 A:middle
throughout the system.

00:19:35.406 --> 00:19:37.106 A:middle
This style is now the default.

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:39.986 A:middle
And the benefit of this style is

00:19:39.986 --> 00:19:41.446 A:middle
that it gives this little peek

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:42.656 A:middle
of what's in the background,

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.036 A:middle
which is a helpful reminder that

00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:46.826 A:middle
there's a different UI that

00:19:46.826 --> 00:19:48.556 A:middle
accommodates a different task or

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:49.966 A:middle
mode of the app that's still in

00:19:49.966 --> 00:19:50.586 A:middle
the background.

00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:52.796 A:middle
With the full-screen modal

00:19:52.896 --> 00:19:55.066 A:middle
sheet, you can sometimes forget

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:56.236 A:middle
what you were doing before.

00:19:56.756 --> 00:19:59.706 A:middle
Card-style modal sheets can be

00:19:59.706 --> 00:20:01.296 A:middle
dismissed by swiping down

00:19:59.706 --> 00:20:01.296 A:middle
dismissed by swiping down

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:02.676 A:middle
anywhere on the screen.

00:20:02.676 --> 00:20:04.386 A:middle
And that dismiss gesture is

00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:05.586 A:middle
often going to be easier than

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:07.066 A:middle
tapping a button in the

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:07.896 A:middle
navigation bar.

00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:10.616 A:middle
As with swiping to go back,

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:12.346 A:middle
pulling down to dismiss

00:20:12.636 --> 00:20:14.106 A:middle
facilitates one-handed

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
operation, which is particularly

00:20:16.396 --> 00:20:17.696 A:middle
convenient on devices with

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:18.546 A:middle
larger displays.

00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:21.346 A:middle
Now, you may wonder, "How does

00:20:21.406 --> 00:20:22.616 A:middle
this work with scrolling?"

00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:24.966 A:middle
When the content area has been

00:20:24.966 --> 00:20:27.156 A:middle
scrolled, swiping down will

00:20:27.156 --> 00:20:28.446 A:middle
scroll it back to the top.

00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:30.166 A:middle
When scrolled all the way back

00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:32.086 A:middle
to the top, continuing to swipe

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:33.846 A:middle
will dismiss the modal

00:20:33.846 --> 00:20:34.546 A:middle
presentation.

00:20:35.876 --> 00:20:37.756 A:middle
But at any time, you can pull

00:20:37.756 --> 00:20:38.946 A:middle
down from the top edge of the

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.176 A:middle
card to dismiss.

00:20:41.416 --> 00:20:43.046 A:middle
Now, if this gesture is

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.136 A:middle
problematic for any reason, like

00:20:45.136 --> 00:20:46.166 A:middle
you have a control in the

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.076 A:middle
content area that works with

00:20:48.076 --> 00:20:50.046 A:middle
vertical swiping, it can be

00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:50.766 A:middle
prevented.

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.676 A:middle
It can also be prevented when

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:55.196 A:middle
there's a mandatory decision

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:57.146 A:middle
that's required in the modal

00:20:57.146 --> 00:20:58.426 A:middle
presentation itself.

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:00.706 A:middle
So, for example, here we either

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:00.706 A:middle
So, for example, here we either

00:21:00.706 --> 00:21:02.486 A:middle
need to cancel or add.

00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:04.906 A:middle
And if we pull down, it will

00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:07.946 A:middle
just bounce right back.

00:21:07.946 --> 00:21:09.556 A:middle
In cases where people must make

00:21:09.556 --> 00:21:11.036 A:middle
a decision before leaving a

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.296 A:middle
modal context, you can prevent

00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:15.706 A:middle
that dismiss gesture and display

00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:17.366 A:middle
an action sheet asking people

00:21:17.366 --> 00:21:19.596 A:middle
how they wish to proceed, which

00:21:19.596 --> 00:21:21.086 A:middle
is actually pretty convenient.

00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.616 A:middle
Now, in case you're wondering,

00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:25.146 A:middle
all of what I just described

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:26.746 A:middle
here doesn't mean that you don't

00:21:26.746 --> 00:21:28.796 A:middle
need to have buttons for modal

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:29.976 A:middle
cards anymore.

00:21:30.816 --> 00:21:32.306 A:middle
Buttons are critical for letting

00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:33.906 A:middle
people know that they can close

00:21:33.906 --> 00:21:34.496 A:middle
the modal.

00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:36.376 A:middle
Buttons are also necessary for

00:21:36.376 --> 00:21:37.676 A:middle
accessibility reasons.

00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:39.716 A:middle
And people might not be familiar

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.416 A:middle
with using the gesture yet or

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
don't want to.

00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:43.756 A:middle
And when the content area's been

00:21:43.756 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
scrolled down, tapping a button

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:46.296 A:middle
might actually be more

00:21:46.296 --> 00:21:46.866 A:middle
convenient.

00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:50.176 A:middle
Similarly, seeing negative and

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:51.776 A:middle
affirmative action pairs at the

00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:53.716 A:middle
top of the screen lets people

00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:55.536 A:middle
know what choices they have to

00:21:55.536 --> 00:21:57.236 A:middle
act within this modal

00:21:57.286 --> 00:21:59.426 A:middle
presentation, what actions they

00:21:59.426 --> 00:21:59.746 A:middle
can take.

00:22:00.696 --> 00:22:02.066 A:middle
Now, we think the new card style

00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:03.296 A:middle
is pretty great, which is why

00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.136 A:middle
it's now the default for iOS.

00:22:06.106 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
But they're not always

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:07.806 A:middle
appropriate.

00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:11.116 A:middle
For some tasks, like editing a

00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:12.586 A:middle
picture or marking up a

00:22:12.586 --> 00:22:14.406 A:middle
screenshot, you really want to

00:22:14.406 --> 00:22:16.376 A:middle
maximize screen space and

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:18.066 A:middle
minimize visual distraction.

00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:20.366 A:middle
For workflows like this, you

00:22:20.366 --> 00:22:21.476 A:middle
should use the optional

00:22:21.566 --> 00:22:22.826 A:middle
full-screen presentation.

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:25.866 A:middle
And one final comment about

00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:29.266 A:middle
modal presentations: modals are

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:30.466 A:middle
for switching modes.

00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:32.926 A:middle
Don't use them just because you

00:22:32.926 --> 00:22:34.536 A:middle
like the animation or the visual

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:35.416 A:middle
style of them.

00:22:36.486 --> 00:22:37.776 A:middle
So, a good example of modal

00:22:37.776 --> 00:22:39.276 A:middle
sheet use is from Calendar.

00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.666 A:middle
Calendar has two primary modes:

00:22:42.226 --> 00:22:44.716 A:middle
viewing events in a grid or list

00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:47.266 A:middle
and then creating or editing

00:22:47.556 --> 00:22:48.046 A:middle
events.

00:22:49.316 --> 00:22:50.826 A:middle
Viewing your calendar involves

00:22:51.176 --> 00:22:52.766 A:middle
scanning all the events that are

00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.716 A:middle
in your calendar and then

00:22:54.716 --> 00:22:56.466 A:middle
selecting them to see detail.

00:22:57.186 --> 00:22:58.286 A:middle
Since we're still in the viewing

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.666 A:middle
mode, a child view is used for

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.666 A:middle
mode, a child view is used for

00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:02.276 A:middle
displaying those details.

00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:05.366 A:middle
As the name suggests, a child is

00:23:05.366 --> 00:23:07.156 A:middle
an extension of the parent view.

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.086 A:middle
A child view should be a

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:11.686 A:middle
continuation of the task or

00:23:11.686 --> 00:23:13.556 A:middle
workflow that was started in

00:23:13.556 --> 00:23:14.406 A:middle
that parent view.

00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.516 A:middle
When creating or editing an

00:23:16.516 --> 00:23:18.646 A:middle
event, a modal sheet signals to

00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:19.686 A:middle
the people who are using

00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:21.266 A:middle
Calendar that they've switched

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.956 A:middle
into a distinct and new

00:23:22.956 --> 00:23:23.556 A:middle
workflow.

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:26.756 A:middle
Okay. Now for our final iOS

00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:28.596 A:middle
design topic, and that's

00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:29.986 A:middle
contextual menus.

00:23:30.646 --> 00:23:33.526 A:middle
With the introduction of 3D

00:23:33.526 --> 00:23:35.826 A:middle
Touch a few years ago came a new

00:23:35.826 --> 00:23:37.616 A:middle
interaction called Peek and Pop.

00:23:38.476 --> 00:23:40.296 A:middle
Peek and Pop was primarily about

00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:41.756 A:middle
getting a larger preview of

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:42.366 A:middle
content.

00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:45.826 A:middle
If available, actions could be

00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:47.946 A:middle
accessed by swiping that preview

00:23:47.946 --> 00:23:48.406 A:middle
upwards.

00:23:49.726 --> 00:23:51.366 A:middle
Contextual menu shifts things

00:23:51.556 --> 00:23:53.966 A:middle
around a bit and puts the focus

00:23:54.086 --> 00:23:54.996 A:middle
on actions.

00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:57.556 A:middle
Actions are presented

00:23:57.596 --> 00:23:58.386 A:middle
immediately.

00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:01.296 A:middle
Contextual menus also work on

00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:01.296 A:middle
Contextual menus also work on

00:24:01.296 --> 00:24:02.186 A:middle
all devices.

00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:05.326 A:middle
Peek and Pop only worked with 3D

00:24:05.326 --> 00:24:07.056 A:middle
Touch, so it wasn't available on

00:24:07.056 --> 00:24:09.036 A:middle
any iPads and some iPhones.

00:24:09.846 --> 00:24:11.456 A:middle
While 3D Touch makes contextual

00:24:11.456 --> 00:24:13.326 A:middle
menus appear more quickly, the

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.916 A:middle
gesture to get a contextual menu

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.386 A:middle
is just tap and hold, and you

00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:18.016 A:middle
can do that on any touch device.

00:24:18.986 --> 00:24:20.546 A:middle
Contextual menus are comprised

00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:23.146 A:middle
of two parts: there's a menu of

00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:24.916 A:middle
commands that can be performed

00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:27.896 A:middle
on an item or selection, and an

00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:29.936 A:middle
optional preview of the selected

00:24:29.936 --> 00:24:31.246 A:middle
item that'll be affected.

00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:33.646 A:middle
That preview can be a helpful

00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:35.546 A:middle
reminder of what item will be

00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:37.066 A:middle
affected by those menu of

00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:37.566 A:middle
commands.

00:24:38.806 --> 00:24:39.936 A:middle
The exact appearance of

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.006 A:middle
contextual menus will change

00:24:42.006 --> 00:24:43.246 A:middle
based on device size and

00:24:43.246 --> 00:24:44.046 A:middle
orientation.

00:24:44.696 --> 00:24:46.996 A:middle
On iPhone, the preview and phone

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:50.586 A:middle
are stacked, in portrait, and

00:24:50.586 --> 00:24:51.656 A:middle
the same thing on iPad when

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.316 A:middle
there's three commands or fewer.

00:24:53.636 --> 00:24:54.826 A:middle
Otherwise, the menu and preview

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.006 A:middle
are displayed side by side.

00:24:56.776 --> 00:24:58.106 A:middle
Contextual menus will appear

00:24:58.106 --> 00:24:59.796 A:middle
directly above the object they

00:24:59.796 --> 00:25:01.946 A:middle
affect or as close to it as

00:24:59.796 --> 00:25:01.946 A:middle
affect or as close to it as

00:25:01.976 --> 00:25:02.466 A:middle
possible.

00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:06.096 A:middle
As with macOS contextual menus,

00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:07.956 A:middle
you can choose the order of menu

00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:08.476 A:middle
commands.

00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:10.416 A:middle
It's best to put the most

00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:11.936 A:middle
frequently used or accessed

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
commands at the top so that

00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:14.736 A:middle
they're easier to access.

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:16.666 A:middle
Otherwise, you should group

00:25:16.836 --> 00:25:18.606 A:middle
commands because they're heavily

00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:19.666 A:middle
related with each other.

00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:21.666 A:middle
So, it totally makes sense that

00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:23.676 A:middle
cut, copy, and paste are near

00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:24.136 A:middle
each other.

00:25:25.266 --> 00:25:27.116 A:middle
You can also use separators to

00:25:27.116 --> 00:25:29.466 A:middle
create visually distinct groups.

00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:32.506 A:middle
And iOS contextual menus can be

00:25:32.586 --> 00:25:34.846 A:middle
hierarchical, meaning that some

00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:36.176 A:middle
of these options can lead to a

00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.166 A:middle
secondary submenu.

00:25:39.406 --> 00:25:41.576 A:middle
Contextual menus on iOS also

00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:43.536 A:middle
include glyphs to help people

00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:44.506 A:middle
find what they're looking for

00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:46.836 A:middle
more quickly, and they allow you

00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:48.426 A:middle
to warn people about destructive

00:25:48.426 --> 00:25:50.436 A:middle
actions by labeling them in red.

00:25:50.546 --> 00:25:53.596 A:middle
You should try to add contextual

00:25:53.596 --> 00:25:55.496 A:middle
menus to every object in your

00:25:55.866 --> 00:25:55.976 A:middle
app.

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:58.566 A:middle
Think about macOS.

00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:01.956 A:middle
You expect every object in every

00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:01.956 A:middle
You expect every object in every

00:26:01.956 --> 00:26:04.106 A:middle
app to have a contextual menu.

00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:06.676 A:middle
They're great way to learn what

00:26:06.676 --> 00:26:08.496 A:middle
actions can be performed on an

00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:08.976 A:middle
object.

00:26:09.886 --> 00:26:12.276 A:middle
And the more iOS apps add

00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:14.346 A:middle
contextual menus, the more

00:26:14.346 --> 00:26:16.756 A:middle
people will expect every app to

00:26:16.756 --> 00:26:18.216 A:middle
support contextual menus,

00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:19.606 A:middle
including yours.

00:26:21.056 --> 00:26:23.386 A:middle
Okay, one final comment about

00:26:23.386 --> 00:26:24.346 A:middle
contextual menus.

00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:26.826 A:middle
The actions they contain should

00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:28.276 A:middle
still be available somewhere

00:26:28.276 --> 00:26:29.956 A:middle
else in your main interface.

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:32.566 A:middle
Contextual menus are powerful

00:26:32.566 --> 00:26:35.666 A:middle
and convenient, but people might

00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.766 A:middle
not always think to access them.

00:26:38.976 --> 00:26:41.116 A:middle
Now, I can't wait to see what

00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:43.536 A:middle
you do with Dark Mode, updated

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:46.126 A:middle
modal presentations and the new

00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:47.076 A:middle
contextual menu.

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.166 A:middle

00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:50.426 A:middle

There you can find the updated

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:57.856 A:middle
SF font, the SF Symbols app, and

00:26:57.946 --> 00:27:00.286 A:middle
the updated iOS Design Resources

00:26:57.946 --> 00:27:00.286 A:middle
the updated iOS Design Resources

00:27:00.286 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
for Sketch.

00:27:01.646 --> 00:27:03.476 A:middle
The Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD

00:27:03.596 --> 00:27:05.756 A:middle
resources will be coming later

00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:06.306 A:middle
this summer.

00:27:07.006 --> 00:27:10.276 A:middle

00:27:11.816 --> 00:27:14.036 A:middle
details about everything that I

00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:14.986 A:middle
covered today.

00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:17.666 A:middle
Okay. Thank you for your time.
