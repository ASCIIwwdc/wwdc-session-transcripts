[ Music ]

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:08.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome to Creating a

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.206 A:middle
Great Accessible Reading

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:10.836 A:middle
Experience.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.016 A:middle
My name is Darren Minifie, and

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.246 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager on

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.256 A:middle
the Accessibility Team.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.456 A:middle
The hallmark for a great

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.036 A:middle
application is an outstanding

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:20.886 A:middle
user interface.

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:22.906 A:middle
This extends to the layout and

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.046 A:middle
styling of text especially for

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.706 A:middle
apps whose primary focus is the

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.196 A:middle
presentation of long form

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:29.106 A:middle
readable content.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:31.766 A:middle
To implement a custom text

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.476 A:middle
layout you often need to turn to

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:34.836 A:middle
lower level technologies such as

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.156 A:middle
Core Text and TextKit.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.606 A:middle
In this session, you will learn

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.396 A:middle
the APIs and techniques you need

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:41.726 A:middle
to create an equally great

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:43.106 A:middle
accessible reading experience

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:43.866 A:middle
for VoiceOver.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.326 A:middle
We'll begin by talking about the

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:49.606 A:middle
reading content protocol.

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:51.586 A:middle
You use this protocol to make

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:53.076 A:middle
your text content accessible.

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.436 A:middle
Next, we'll talk about automatic

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.276 A:middle
page turning, which VoiceOver

00:00:57.276 --> 00:00:58.796 A:middle
uses to turn the pages in your

00:00:58.846 --> 00:00:59.476 A:middle
application.

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
Finally, we'll discuss the APIs

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.226 A:middle
you can use to customize the way

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
VoiceOver speaks your content.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.966 A:middle
In the session, we'll use the

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.076 A:middle
following sample app to

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.386 A:middle
demonstrate these techniques.

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.556 A:middle
The app is a simple page-based

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:16.996 A:middle
application where each page

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:19.256 A:middle
consists of an image, a title, a

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.276 A:middle
subtitle and some detail text.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.846 A:middle
To make your app accessible, you

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.946 A:middle
should first audit it with

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:26.586 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.556 A:middle
A convenient way to do this is

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.576 A:middle
to add VoiceOver to your

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:31.746 A:middle
accessibility shortcut.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.386 A:middle
You can do this by launching

00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:36.306 A:middle
settings, tapping accessibility,

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.366 A:middle
scrolling down to accessibility

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.856 A:middle
shortcut and tapping VoiceOver.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:43.746 A:middle
Now depending on your hardware,

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.216 A:middle
you can press the home button or

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:46.976 A:middle
side button 3 times to quickly

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.456 A:middle
enable and disable VoiceOver.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.906 A:middle
Let's see how VoiceOver

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:53.336 A:middle
interacts with the sample app.

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:54.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.636 A:middle
[ Beeping ]

00:01:58.136 --> 00:01:59.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As I drag my finger across

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.956 A:middle
the screen, VoiceOver plays a

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.956 A:middle
the screen, VoiceOver plays a

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:02.596 A:middle
sound effect indicating there is

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:03.766 A:middle
no content to be found.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.506 A:middle
Therefore, the first thing we

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:06.866 A:middle
need to do is make our text

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:07.946 A:middle
content accessible.

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:11.306 A:middle
To make your content accessible,

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:12.236 A:middle
you should use the

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.106 A:middle
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:15.236 A:middle
Protocol.

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
This protocol consists of 4 core

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:17.696 A:middle
methods.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.686 A:middle
AccessibilityLineNumber(for

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.396 A:middle
point asks you to return the

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:23.816 A:middle
line number for a given touch

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:24.326 A:middle
location.

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.606 A:middle
AccessibilityContent

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:27.516 A:middle
(forLineNumber and

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:28.516 A:middle
accessibilityFrame

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.526 A:middle
(forLineNumber asks for the text

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.166 A:middle
content and rect for a given

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.126 A:middle
line respectively.

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:34.986 A:middle
Finally,

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.266 A:middle
accessibilityPageContent asks

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.756 A:middle
you to return the entire pages

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:39.586 A:middle
worth of content.

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:42.826 A:middle
Let's see how we would implement

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:42.893 A:middle
the

00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:44.526 A:middle
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.886 A:middle
Protocol in our sample app.

00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:48.576 A:middle
Each page in the sample app is

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:50.006 A:middle
represented by an instance of

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.016 A:middle
SessionItemView.

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:54.926 A:middle
This view has 4 sub views; an

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:57.676 A:middle
image view, a title label, an

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.476 A:middle
identifier label and a session

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
details view.

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.226 A:middle
details view.

00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
We additionally declare a layout

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:04.336 A:middle
enum.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:05.816 A:middle
This will help us in our method

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.126 A:middle
implementations that follow.

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:11.426 A:middle
The first thing we need to do is

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
make our page view an

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:13.676 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:15.356 A:middle
We do this by setting

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.066 A:middle
isAccessibilityElement to true

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.906 A:middle
in the page views initializer.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:23.536 A:middle
Next, we begin to implement the

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.796 A:middle
reading content protocol.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.456 A:middle
Our first method is

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.836 A:middle
accessibilityLineNumber(for

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:28.176 A:middle
point.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.676 A:middle
First, we hitTest the page view

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.306 A:middle
using the past in line number.

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:36.106 A:middle
If the resulting view is one of

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:38.546 A:middle
our known sub views, we map that

00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:41.086 A:middle
to the value of our layout enum.

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:43.536 A:middle
Finally, we return the rawValue

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:44.846 A:middle
as this is the representation

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:45.976 A:middle
VoiceOver understands.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.966 A:middle
Next to implement

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.196 A:middle
AccessibilityContent

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.346 A:middle
(forLineNumber, we begin by

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.936 A:middle
instantiating an instance of the

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:55.576 A:middle
layout enum.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:57.606 A:middle
We switch over the possible

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
cases and map that to one of our

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
known sub views.

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
known sub views.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.786 A:middle
Finally, we return accessibility

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:04.406 A:middle
label, which returns the text

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:05.186 A:middle
for that sub view.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:09.406 A:middle
The implementation of

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:10.476 A:middle
accessibilityFrame

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:12.006 A:middle
(forLineNumber is very similar.

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:14.716 A:middle
We begin by creating a new

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:16.466 A:middle
instance of the layout enum with

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.685 A:middle
our given raw value.

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:19.875 A:middle
We switch over the possible

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.646 A:middle
cases and map that to one of our

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:22.716 A:middle
known sub views.

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:25.366 A:middle
Finally, we return accessibility

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.926 A:middle
frame, which represents the rect

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:27.886 A:middle
for a given line.

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:31.936 A:middle
Finally, to implement

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
accessibilityPageContent we

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.726 A:middle
gather together the text from

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.176 A:middle
our known sub views and return

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.346 A:middle
them as a single string.

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.306 A:middle
Let's see how the app interacts

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:44.556 A:middle
with VoiceOver with the reading

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.306 A:middle
content protocol implemented.

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Accessible drag-and-drop.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.986 A:middle
Session 241.

00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:53.356 A:middle
Drag-and-drop is a powerful API

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:54.556 A:middle
that allows apps to share and

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:55.376 A:middle
communicate data.

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This time as I drag my finger

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:59.366 A:middle
across the screen VoiceOver

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.636 A:middle
speaks and highlights the

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.636 A:middle
speaks and highlights the

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
corresponding text.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.516 A:middle
Next let's talk about automatic

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
page turning.

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:09.356 A:middle
When VoiceOver's read all

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:10.906 A:middle
command is invoked, it's

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:12.386 A:middle
expected that VoiceOver will be

00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:13.836 A:middle
able to read all of your content

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:14.956 A:middle
from beginning to end.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.916 A:middle
This may require VoiceOver to

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.306 A:middle
turn pages in your app.

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:20.826 A:middle
To implement automatic page

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.576 A:middle
turning you need to adopt 2

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:23.936 A:middle
accessibility APIs.

00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.076 A:middle
First, you should include the

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.756 A:middle
causesPageTurn accessibility

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:28.986 A:middle
trait on your page view.

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:31.396 A:middle
Second, you should implement

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:32.696 A:middle
AccessibilityScroll in

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:33.226 A:middle
direction.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.286 A:middle
This gives VoiceOver the ability

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:36.706 A:middle
to turn pages in your app.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.316 A:middle
Let's see how we would implement

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:40.626 A:middle
automatic page turning in our

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:42.036 A:middle
sample app.

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:44.736 A:middle
First, we need to include the

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:46.386 A:middle
causesPageTurn accessibility

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:46.766 A:middle
trait.

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.476 A:middle
We do this by setting

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.036 A:middle
accessibility trait in the page

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:50.986 A:middle
views initializer.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.496 A:middle
Next, we implement

00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:55.736 A:middle
accessibilityScroll and

00:05:55.736 --> 00:05:56.276 A:middle
direction.

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.476 A:middle
We do this by switching over the

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
possible cases of the direction

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
possible cases of the direction

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
parameter.

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:03.396 A:middle
If the direction is previous or

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.136 A:middle
left, we ask our delegate to

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
turn to the previous page.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.906 A:middle
If that's successful, we notify

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.616 A:middle
VoiceOver with a pageScrolled

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:11.396 A:middle
notification.

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:16.196 A:middle
Similarly, if the value is right

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.036 A:middle
or next, we ask the delegate to

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:19.896 A:middle
turn to the next page and if

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:21.336 A:middle
that's successful, we notify

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:22.746 A:middle
VoiceOver with a pageScrolled

00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:23.536 A:middle
notification.

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:28.846 A:middle
Let's see how the app interacts

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.246 A:middle
with automatic page turning

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:31.086 A:middle
implemented.

00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:33.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Accessible drag-and-drop

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.056 A:middle
Session 241.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.656 A:middle
Drag-and-drop is a powerful API

00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:37.846 A:middle
that allows apps to share and

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:38.676 A:middle
communicate data.

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.176 A:middle
No matter how you decide to

00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:41.676 A:middle
implant drag-and-drop there's a

00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:42.886 A:middle
way to make it work for people

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:43.986 A:middle
with accessibility needs.

00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:45.566 A:middle
Learn the details as we dive

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:46.796 A:middle
into accessible drag-and-drop

00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:46.976 A:middle
for iOS.

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:50.666 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:51.856 A:middle
Making iOS talk.

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.376 A:middle
Session 236.

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:56.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Our final topic is

00:06:56.026 --> 00:06:57.166 A:middle
customizing speech.

00:06:57.796 --> 00:06:59.146 A:middle
You may want to control the way

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
VoiceOver speaks your app's

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
VoiceOver speaks your app's

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.046 A:middle
content.

00:07:01.706 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
To do this you can use 2

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:04.616 A:middle
alternate methods in the reading

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.656 A:middle
content protocol.

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:08.076 A:middle
These method versions return

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:09.666 A:middle
NSAttributedStrings instead of

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:10.436 A:middle
simple strings.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.486 A:middle
By supplying the appropriate

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
accessibility attributes, you

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.876 A:middle
can control various aspects

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:17.376 A:middle
about how VoiceOver speaks your

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:17.876 A:middle
content.

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.576 A:middle
For example, you may have a

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:23.006 A:middle
passage you would like spoken in

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:24.166 A:middle
a particular language.

00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:26.176 A:middle
To do this you can include the

00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:27.886 A:middle
accessibilitySpeechLanguage

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:29.096 A:middle
attribute along with the

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:30.746 A:middle
appropriate language identifier.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.146 A:middle
This causes VoiceOver to use the

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.696 A:middle
most appropriate voice to speak

00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:35.366 A:middle
your content.

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:38.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Arc de Triomphe.

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:41.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Furthermore, you may want

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:42.966 A:middle
fine-grained control over the

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:44.276 A:middle
way VoiceOver speaks your

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:44.826 A:middle
content.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.616 A:middle
To do this you can supply the

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:48.996 A:middle
IPA representation for your

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.646 A:middle
passage along with the

00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:53.156 A:middle
accessibilitySpeechIPANotation

00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:53.706 A:middle
attribute.

00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:56.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yosemite National Park.

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So to create a great reading

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So to create a great reading

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:02.976 A:middle
experience for VoiceOver, you

00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:04.246 A:middle
first need to make your text

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:05.296 A:middle
content accessible.

00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:07.106 A:middle
You do this by implementing the

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:09.176 A:middle
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:09.726 A:middle
protocol.

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.116 A:middle
Next, you should implement

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.466 A:middle
automatic page turning so

00:08:13.466 --> 00:08:14.736 A:middle
VoiceOver can read all of the

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:15.986 A:middle
content in your app from

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.066 A:middle
beginning to end.

00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:20.216 A:middle
Finally, to control the way

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:21.836 A:middle
VoiceOver speaks your content,

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:23.606 A:middle
you should consider using the NS

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:25.136 A:middle
attributed strings versions of

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.136 A:middle
the methods in the reading

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:27.966 A:middle
content protocol and supply the

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.196 A:middle
appropriate accessibility

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:29.866 A:middle
attributes.

00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:32.916 A:middle
