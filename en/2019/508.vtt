[ Music ]

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to our

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:11.006 A:middle
session about Modernizing Your

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:11.496 A:middle
Audio App.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.246 A:middle
My name is Peter Vasil, and I'm

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.886 A:middle
a software engineer in the Core

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:16.486 A:middle
Audio Team.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:19.296 A:middle
Let's start with audio units.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:22.276 A:middle
Support for

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.856 A:middle
Carbon-Component-Based Audio

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.736 A:middle
Units will be removed in a

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.166 A:middle
future macOS release.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.926 A:middle
We encourage hosts to use the

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.826 A:middle
AudioComponent API for audio

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:32.866 A:middle
unit discovery.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:36.936 A:middle
With the next OS release,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.676 A:middle
AudioHardwarePlugIn-based

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.326 A:middle
plugins are disabled by default.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.556 A:middle
We recommend using the

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:45.766 A:middle
AudioServerPlugin API instead.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.676 A:middle
For now, disabled plugins can be

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:50.346 A:middle
re-enabled in the Audio MIDI

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:53.406 A:middle
Setup utility, but support will

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:54.766 A:middle
be removed completely in a

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.226 A:middle
future macOS release.

00:00:56.716 --> 00:01:00.236 A:middle
With the next OS release, we

00:00:56.716 --> 00:01:00.236 A:middle
With the next OS release, we

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
will introduce some

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.136 A:middle
deprecations.

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:05.126 A:middle
AUGraph, Inter-App Audio, and

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:07.076 A:middle
OpenAL will be deprecated.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.326 A:middle
We encourage developers to

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:11.746 A:middle
switch over to AVAudioEngine, as

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:13.586 A:middle
replacement for AUGraph and

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:14.376 A:middle
OpenAL.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.566 A:middle
For Inter-App Audio, please use

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.646 A:middle
Audio Unit Extensions instead.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.996 A:middle
The 3D Mixer parameters have

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.426 A:middle
been unified across all

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.206 A:middle
platforms.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:27.946 A:middle
For details, please refer to the

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.166 A:middle
AudioUnitParameters header file

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.216 A:middle
for a list of new and deprecated

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:33.006 A:middle
parameters.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.786 A:middle
For more information, please

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:37.426 A:middle
visit the developer website.

00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:40.696 A:middle
Thank you for your attention.
