WEBVTT

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:15.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.636 A:middle
My name is Gary and I am an

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.216 A:middle
engineer on the Accessibility

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:20.416 A:middle
Team.

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.426 A:middle
Today, I'm excited to talk about

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:25.876 A:middle
a tool called Accessibility

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.416 A:middle
Inspector.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.156 A:middle
The Accessibility Inspector

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.306 A:middle
provides an easy way to find,

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:38.296 A:middle
diagnose, and fix accessibility

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.746 A:middle
issues within your app.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:42.786 A:middle
In this presentation, we will be

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:44.256 A:middle
doing exactly that, using a

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:44.816 A:middle
sample app.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:46.286 A:middle
Let's jump right into it.

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
So here this is my Peanut Butter

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:54.586 A:middle
Tracking App.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.446 A:middle
It helps my fellow peanut butter

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:56.896 A:middle
lovers.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:59.186 A:middle
Tracks their favor brand, rate,

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:00.946 A:middle
them and record details about

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:00.946 A:middle
them and record details about

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:01.126 A:middle
them.

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:03.216 A:middle
Tapping on the particular cell

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:04.885 A:middle
will bring me to the Detail View

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:05.986 A:middle
for that particular brand.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:08.996 A:middle
And in here, I can take photos

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.426 A:middle
of my favorite peanut butter.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:13.966 A:middle
I could favorite it or I could

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.146 A:middle
buy it again and share with my

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:15.436 A:middle
friends.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.856 A:middle
Now I want to test for

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.366 A:middle
accessibility issues from my

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.366 A:middle
Detailed View but I'm not quite

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.336 A:middle
sure where to start.

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:24.956 A:middle
The Accessibility Inspector

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.556 A:middle
makes this daunting task easy.

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:28.466 A:middle
Let's start by opening the

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.236 A:middle
Accessibility Inspector.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.026 A:middle
So first, I'll go over to XCode

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:36.156 A:middle
and under the XCode Menu you'll

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:38.016 A:middle
see Open Developer Tools.

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:41.696 A:middle
And in here, you can find the

00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:42.556 A:middle
Accessibility Inspector.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.296 A:middle
You might notice what seems to

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:45.856 A:middle
be a large [Inaudible].

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:48.426 A:middle
This is actually a new feature

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:49.916 A:middle
that we added for low vision

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:50.856 A:middle
user on the Mac.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:53.516 A:middle
It is called Hover Text and it

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:55.006 A:middle
makes anything under the mouse

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:56.866 A:middle
cursor larger and sharper to

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.106 A:middle
see.

00:01:58.006 --> 00:01:58.986 A:middle
And we'll be using it throughout

00:01:58.986 --> 00:01:59.566 A:middle
our demo today.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:07.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:09.936 A:middle
So now with Inspector open, I'm

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.015 A:middle
going to use the Target

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:13.086 A:middle
Selection Drop Down to select my

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:13.596 A:middle
iOS device.

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:18.526 A:middle
The Inspector has three main

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:18.756 A:middle
parts.

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:22.336 A:middle
First, the Inspector tab.

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:24.906 A:middle
Then the Audit tab.

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:26.996 A:middle
And the Settings tab.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.236 A:middle
Let's focus on the Audit tab for

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:28.426 A:middle
now.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.156 A:middle
This is one of the easiest ways

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:33.686 A:middle
to help me find accessibility

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.256 A:middle
issues in my app.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
By pressing on the Run Audit

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.906 A:middle
button, you'll get a list of

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:40.636 A:middle
potential accessibility issues.

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:45.856 A:middle
So let's try that for our view.

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:47.586 A:middle
Immediately, you see that it

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:48.686 A:middle
found a bunch of issues.

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:51.366 A:middle
And clicking on the issue will

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:52.416 A:middle
highlight the problematic

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:53.296 A:middle
element in yellow.

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:57.276 A:middle
Let's start in the middle with

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:00.496 A:middle
Image name used in description.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:00.496 A:middle
Image name used in description.

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
This issue seems to affect all

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:03.016 A:middle
three of our custom buttons.

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
Assistive technologies like

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.156 A:middle
VoiceOver uses accessibility

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:10.086 A:middle
information such as a Label to

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
help users interact and navigate

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.656 A:middle
with the UI in your view.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:17.366 A:middle
But how exactly do we provide

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.686 A:middle
such information to the

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:19.396 A:middle
assisting technologies?

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.456 A:middle
You can click on the Help button

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:24.236 A:middle
on the right to get a suggestion

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:27.596 A:middle
for what to do.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
So here it states that consider

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:30.736 A:middle
setting a human readable,

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.466 A:middle
localized accessibilityLabel.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.026 A:middle
Now let's head back to our

00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:39.516 A:middle
Inspector tab.

00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:41.176 A:middle
Now I want to inspect for my

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:41.846 A:middle
custom buttons.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.066 A:middle
And to do that, you'll press the

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.266 A:middle
Point Inspection button on the

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:48.966 A:middle
top.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:51.656 A:middle
Now with my fingers down on the

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:54.876 A:middle
screen, I can move around and

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:56.796 A:middle
focus on any accessible element.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:58.706 A:middle
Let's start with the Custom

00:03:59.316 --> 00:03:59.466 A:middle
button.

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.456 A:middle
Here under the Basic section,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.606 A:middle
you'll see the Label property is

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:06.696 A:middle
set to the Image File Name.

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:09.746 A:middle
This creates a poor experience

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:10.456 A:middle
for our users.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.316 A:middle
And to help you get an idea of

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.266 A:middle
this experience, we added a new

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.846 A:middle
feature that will simulate a

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:18.636 A:middle
VoiceOver [Inaudible] by

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:19.796 A:middle
pressing on the speaker button.

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:23.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Camera.on.rectangle button.

00:04:24.126 --> 00:04:25.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I can use the Next button

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:27.186 A:middle
to jump to the next element.

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:28.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sue.heart button.

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:31.966 A:middle
Cart.badge.plus button.

00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:34.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So as we navigated over the

00:04:34.286 --> 00:04:36.246 A:middle
buttons, we heard unhelpful

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:36.716 A:middle
descriptions.

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.566 A:middle
These descriptions didn't really

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:41.206 A:middle
tell us what the buttons do.

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:43.986 A:middle
So let's jump into Code and add

00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:45.326 A:middle
some meaningful Labels for

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:45.866 A:middle
Custom buttons.

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:53.806 A:middle
To add a Label, we'll simply set

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:55.666 A:middle
the accessibility Label

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.806 A:middle
attribute under View.

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.156 A:middle
So for my Favorite button, I'll

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.156 A:middle
So for my Favorite button, I'll

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:01.736 A:middle
set it equal to the state of

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:02.196 A:middle
favorite.

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:06.116 A:middle
And for my Camera button, I'll

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:08.076 A:middle
simply set it to take a photo.

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:12.486 A:middle
And for my Buy button, I'll set

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:13.036 A:middle
it as Buy.

00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:15.366 A:middle
And remember to properly

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:16.186 A:middle
localize your string.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:18.846 A:middle
So now let's head back to the

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:21.236 A:middle
Inspector to see our remaining

00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
issues.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.276 A:middle
Here it looks like there's a

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:29.686 A:middle
potentially inaccessible text.

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:33.556 A:middle
If you're using sender UIKit or

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.066 A:middle
app key controls, then

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.346 A:middle
accessibility comes for free.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:39.136 A:middle
However, in this case, we're

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:41.066 A:middle
drawing the brand name using

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.396 A:middle
CATextLayer, which means we're

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:45.536 A:middle
responsible for handling our own

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:46.166 A:middle
accessibility.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.386 A:middle
Let's jump into Code to see how

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:50.726 A:middle
we can make this Custom text

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:51.376 A:middle
accessible.

00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:56.766 A:middle
So the first thing that I'll

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:58.236 A:middle
have to do is to let the

00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:00.036 A:middle
assistive technologies know that

00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:00.036 A:middle
assistive technologies know that

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:01.506 A:middle
this is an accessibility element

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:05.136 A:middle
and to do that, I'll simply set

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:06.996 A:middle
the isAccessibilityElement to

00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:07.766 A:middle
true.

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
Next, I'll have to give it a

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:12.026 A:middle
meaningful Label.

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.246 A:middle
And in our case, we'll set it

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:17.426 A:middle
equal to the brandName and

00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:19.566 A:middle
that's it.

00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:20.586 A:middle
So let's jump back to the

00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:22.026 A:middle
Inspector to see our final

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:22.316 A:middle
issue.

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:27.136 A:middle
Here it looks like there's a

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:28.496 A:middle
contrast problem for our

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:28.896 A:middle
brandName.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:31.106 A:middle
We can click on the Disclosure

00:06:31.106 --> 00:06:32.826 A:middle
triangle to get a more detailed

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:33.586 A:middle
explanation.

00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:38.636 A:middle
Here it shows a contrast ratio

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.246 A:middle
and the color we used to

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:40.846 A:middle
calculate it.

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:43.916 A:middle
Displaying information in a

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:45.766 A:middle
clear and legible manner is

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:46.136 A:middle
crucial.

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:49.716 A:middle
But it looks like the contrast

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:51.146 A:middle
for our brand name is too poor

00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:54.716 A:middle
for the users to pick out text.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:59.136 A:middle
Let's click on the Help button.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
Here it says that the

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
Here it says that the

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.156 A:middle
recommended contrast ratio

00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:03.736 A:middle
should be above 3.0.

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:05.896 A:middle
But how do we achieve this

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:06.206 A:middle
ratio?

00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:09.486 A:middle
The Accessibility Inspector has

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:11.256 A:middle
a helpful tool called the Color

00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:12.226 A:middle
Contrast Calculator.

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:15.736 A:middle
This tool insures that the text

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.216 A:middle
and it's background meets the

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:18.496 A:middle
recommended contrast ratio.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:20.846 A:middle
And we can find that tool by

00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:24.236 A:middle
going to Menus, Windows, Show

00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:27.936 A:middle
Color Contrast Calculator.

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:33.276 A:middle
And now I'll click on the Color

00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.026 A:middle
Picker to select the light gray

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.946 A:middle
color that I used for the brand

00:07:39.616 --> 00:07:39.706 A:middle
name.

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.766 A:middle
Here you see that the contrast

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:46.746 A:middle
ratio is 2.3 which is below the

00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:48.116 A:middle
recommended 3.0 ratio.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:50.926 A:middle
So now I'm going to use a slider

00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:53.656 A:middle
to pick a color to satisfy the

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:55.796 A:middle
contrast ratio without

00:07:55.796 --> 00:07:57.416 A:middle
compromising my original design.

00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.456 A:middle
And this dark gray color looks

00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.456 A:middle
And this dark gray color looks

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:01.066 A:middle
just about right.

00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:02.866 A:middle
Let's use that in our color.

00:08:09.536 --> 00:08:10.736 A:middle
So the first thing now I have to

00:08:10.736 --> 00:08:13.586 A:middle
do is to add the darkGrayColor,

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:15.666 A:middle
then I'll set the

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:18.706 A:middle
foregroundColor for my textLayer

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:21.076 A:middle
to be the color that we just

00:08:21.076 --> 00:08:21.326 A:middle
added.

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.326 A:middle
Now for the moment of truth,

00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:27.716 A:middle
let's run the app again to see

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:33.046 A:middle
how it works.

00:08:33.216 --> 00:08:34.706 A:middle
While the app is running, I'm

00:08:34.706 --> 00:08:36.515 A:middle
going to open the Inspector.

00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:43.376 A:middle
To verify that all of our

00:08:43.376 --> 00:08:45.356 A:middle
changes works, I'm going to run

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:46.496 A:middle
the Audit test once more.

00:08:49.956 --> 00:08:52.106 A:middle
Great. It looks like all of the

00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:52.936 A:middle
warnings are gone.

00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:00.086 A:middle
Let's head over to the Inspector

00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:00.086 A:middle
Let's head over to the Inspector

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:01.906 A:middle

work on this view by pressing on

00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:05.276 A:middle

Creamy bullet no-stir.

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:18.786 A:middle
This tastes great.

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:22.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And that's a much better

00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:22.576 A:middle
experience.

00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.256 A:middle
These are just some of the ways

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:35.536 A:middle
of how the Accessibility

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:37.396 A:middle
Inspector can help you create a

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:38.806 A:middle
fantastic app experience.

00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.396 A:middle
It is a powerful tool to help

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:44.006 A:middle
you find and fix accessibility

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:46.926 A:middle
issues and an easy way to get

00:09:46.926 --> 00:09:48.266 A:middle
started with accessibility.

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:51.126 A:middle
I encourage you to spend a few

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:53.356 A:middle
minutes to audit for your own

00:09:53.356 --> 00:09:56.016 A:middle
apps and to make sure that your

00:09:56.016 --> 00:09:58.756 A:middle
app is accessible for everyone.
