00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:08.133
This is really cool.

152
00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.799
(Applause)

153
00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:16.966
This is the best music
experience on television.

154
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.700
Now, Apple Arcade is also
going to look amazing on

155
00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:23.333
the AppleTV 4K this fall.

156
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.966
Playing great games like
Ocean Horn 2, of course,

156
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.966
Playing great games like
Ocean Horn 2, of course,

157
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:30.100
is even better with great
game controllers so we are

158
00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:33.933
extending support to two
of the best and most

159
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.333
popular game
controllers available.

160
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.399
Xbox 1S.

160
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.399
Xbox 1S.

161
00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:38.600
(Applause)

162
00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.866
Yes.

163
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.766
And PlayStation
DualShock 4.

164
00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.633
(Applause)

165
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah.

166
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:54.866
I think there is a few
PlayStation fans out there.

167
00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:59.166
Finally, let's talk about
our beautiful screensavers.

168
00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:01.566
We have already captured
some of the most stunning

169
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:05.266
locations around the globe
and even some from outer

169
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:05.266
locations around the globe
and even some from outer

170
00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:06.833
space through our
collaboration with the

171
00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.799
International
Space Station.

172
00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:13.933
This year, we are
going under the sea.

173
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.966
Oh, it's awesome.

174
00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:16.633
(Applause)

174
00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:16.633
(Applause)

175
00:11:17.766 --> 00:11:20.399
We've partnered with BBC
Natural History unit to

176
00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:24.399
shoot beautiful 4K HDR
footage, taking you to

177
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:27.633
places that few people
have ever experienced before.

178
00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:31.433
So, that's the new tvOS.

179
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.933
More personal and more
entertaining than ever.

180
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.166
(Applause)

181
00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:44.633
Now, let's talk
about Apple Watch.

182
00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:46.666
(Applause)

183
00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:51.433
Yeah.

184
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.200
Apple Watch is the number
one watch in the world.

185
00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:56.633
It keeps you connected to
the people and information

185
00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:56.633
It keeps you connected to
the people and information

186
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.333
you care about just by
raising your wrist.

187
00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.100
It tracks your workouts
and motivates you to stay

188
00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:04.233
active throughout the day.

189
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:06.033
And with new breakthrough
features like fall

190
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.833
detection, heart
notifications and ACG, the

190
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.833
detection, heart
notifications and ACG, the

191
00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.700
Apple Watch has truly
become an intelligent

192
00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:13.433
guardian for your health.

193
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.366
For so many of us, the
Apple Watch has become an

194
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.799
essential part of
our daily life.

194
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.799
essential part of
our daily life.

195
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:25.566
Today, we are going to
take another leap forward

196
00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:28.233
with the watchOS to bring
new experiences to Apple

197
00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:32.333
Watch while enhancing the
ones that you already love.

198
00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.366
To tell you all about it,
I would like to invite

198
00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.366
To tell you all about it,
I would like to invite

199
00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:35.966
Kevin Lynch to the stage.

200
00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:36.633
Kevin.

201
00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.600
(Applause)

202
00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:40.333
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Tim.

203
00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:45.100
Good morning.

204
00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.966
So excited to be here.

205
00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.100
We're thrilled at how
Watch is making such a

206
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.233
difference in so
many people's lives.

207
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:53.633
This is driving us to make
Watch even more powerful

208
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.366
and more personal for you.

209
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.600
Let's start with
Watch faces.

210
00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:00.533
Now, these are something
you interact with most

210
00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:00.533
Now, these are something
you interact with most

211
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.433
every day and we have more
Watch faces this year

212
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.533
since the very
first Apple Watch.

213
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:07.766
(Applause)

214
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.299
From simply beautiful to
richly detailed, let's

214
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.299
From simply beautiful to
richly detailed, let's

215
00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:16.200
take a look at
a few of these.

216
00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.466
First, we have the
gradient face which is

217
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.766
smoothly animating
with the time.

218
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.566
Then we have this large
Numerals face showing the

219
00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:27.500
current hour in multiple
languages and the very

219
00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:27.500
current hour in multiple
languages and the very

220
00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:30.200
modern digital face
showing you a great look

221
00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:33.466
in multiple colors and
then the California dial,

222
00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.266
classic design
for a Watch face.

223
00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:37.766
Now, many of these
faces you can add more

224
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.233
information to, such as
adding rich complications

224
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.233
information to, such as
adding rich complications

225
00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:42.033
here right on the
California dial.

226
00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:45.433
Then we have
the solar face.

227
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.066
This visualizes the sun's
24-hour path around the

228
00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:51.000
dial and you can see it
changing during the day or

229
00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:53.433
as you rotate
the Digital Crown.

229
00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:53.433
as you rotate
the Digital Crown.

230
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.766
These are just beautiful.

231
00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:57.133
(Applause)

232
00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:02.799
Now, across all of the
Watch faces, we are

233
00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:05.333
introducing taptic chimes.

233
00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:05.333
introducing taptic chimes.

234
00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.633
And when enabled, on the
hour, you will feel a

235
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.133
silent taptic on your
wrist and if sound is on,

236
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.666
you will hear an audible
chime like this.

237
00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:19.200
Yes, that's a bird song.

237
00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:19.200
Yes, that's a bird song.

238
00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.333
It's actually a robin
captured at Apple Park.

239
00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.600
I mean, it was
recorded in Apple Park.

240
00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:25.100
(Laughter)

241
00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.100
The robins are okay.

242
00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:30.200
(Applause)

243
00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:35.166
Now, let's talk
about apps.

244
00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:38.033
Now, these are designed
for quick interactions on Watch.

245
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.266
First, we are bringing
more Apple apps to Watch.

246
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.633
The new Audiobooks app to let you listen to Apple Books and

246
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.633
The new Audiobooks app to let you listen to Apple Books and

247
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.233
Voice Memos so you can
easily record your thoughts.

248
00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:49.466
(Applause)

249
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.666
And calculator.

250
00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:56.633
(Applause)

251
00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.033
And check this out; it
also includes the ability

252
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100
to do tip calculations,
including the ability to

253
00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.766
split the bill
with friends.

254
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.466
(Applause)

255
00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:16.033
Now, we are also giving
developers great new tools

256
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.933
and APIs to build great
apps for Apple Watch.

257
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.100
And we are now making it
possible to create apps

258
00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.466
that run independently
on the Watch, no longer

258
00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.466
that run independently
on the Watch, no longer

259
00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.399
requiring a
companion iPhone app.

260
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.100
(Applause)

261
00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.799
And now you can get
extended time to access

262
00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.266
sensor data and complete
sessions like physical

262
00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.266
sensor data and complete
sessions like physical

263
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:40.133
therapy with Kya or
brushing your teeth with

264
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.866
Colgate or
meditating with Calm.

265
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.666
And watchOS 6 now enables
the streaming audio API so

266
00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:51.366
you can go with just
your Watch and you can

266
00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:51.366
you can go with just
your Watch and you can

267
00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:53.966
stream great content
like Podcasts, music,

268
00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:55.433
live sports games.

269
00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:58.566
So, with new developer
tools and a new native UI

270
00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:00.600
framework coming this
year, we are enabling a

271
00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:03.933
whole new generation
of apps for Watch.

271
00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:03.933
whole new generation
of apps for Watch.

272
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.366
Now, to make it easier
for you to discover these apps,

273
00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:10.133
we are excited to bring
the App Store to Apple Watch.

274
00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:13.233
(Applause)

275
00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:19.100
You can browse apps
curated by our editorial

276
00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:22.166
team or find favorite apps
like Head Space or Carrot

277
00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:24.866
Weather or Streaks,
the Nike Run Club.

278
00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:28.266
You can search the full
App Store using dictation

278
00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:28.266
You can search the full
App Store using dictation

279
00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.133
or scribble or
just asking Siri.

280
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.433
And you can view product
pages to see information

281
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.000
like the app description,
reviews, screenshots.

282
00:16:37.066 --> 00:16:39.366
And finally, you can
purchase and install an

283
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.100
app directly
on your Watch.

283
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.100
app directly
on your Watch.

284
00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:45.000
(Applause)

285
00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.366
So, discovering and using
apps at Apple Watch is

286
00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.566
going to be better than
ever with the App Store

287
00:16:51.633 --> 00:16:53.299
and these really
great developer tools.

288
00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.666
Now, we are also adding
new health and fitness

288
00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.666
Now, we are also adding
new health and fitness

289
00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.266
capabilities and to tell
you about some of these, I

290
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.733
would like to invite to
the stage Dr. Sumbul Desai,

291
00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:02.733
our VP of Health, to the stage.

292
00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:03.500
Sumbul?

293
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.500
(Applause)

294
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.598
>> SUMBUL DESAI:
Thanks, Kevin.

295
00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:15.233
Apple Watch is an amazing
health and fitness

296
00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.532
partner, and in watchOS 6
we are adding even more

297
00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:20.433
features to empower you to
better manage your health

297
00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:20.433
features to empower you to
better manage your health

298
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.433
starting with activity.

299
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.299
Being physically active is
one of the most important

300
00:17:25.366 --> 00:17:26.933
things you can do
for your health.

301
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.599
If it were a prescription,
it would actually be one

302
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.833
of the most prescribed
medicines in the world.

303
00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:35.033
The Activity app on Apple
Watch already motivates

303
00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:35.033
The Activity app on Apple
Watch already motivates

304
00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:36.466
you to stay active.

305
00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:38.599
It also lets you know
how active you are every

306
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:41.633
single day, but knowing
how active you are over

307
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.400
the long-term is
just as important.

308
00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:46.666
It gives you a sense of
your overall fitness.

308
00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:46.666
It gives you a sense of
your overall fitness.

309
00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:51.200
So, in watchOS 6 we are
introducing Activity Trends.

310
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.666
(Applause)

311
00:17:56.433 --> 00:17:58.599
For nine key metrics it
will compare your progress

312
00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:02.433
over the last 90 days
with the last 365.

312
00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:02.433
over the last 90 days
with the last 365.

313
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.066
If the trends show that
you are maintaining or

314
00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:07.366
improving, you will see
an arrow pointing up, and

315
00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:09.799
that's great; keep doing
what you are doing.

316
00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:12.066
But if you are trending
downward, we will give you

316
00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:12.066
But if you are trending
downward, we will give you

317
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.299
simple coaching to
get you back on track.

318
00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:16.433
You will see trends for
familiar metrics like

319
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.633
move, exercise, and stand,
but you will also see

320
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.066
trends for some new
metrics like your workout

321
00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.099
walking pace, flights of
stairs climbed or even

321
00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.099
walking pace, flights of
stairs climbed or even

322
00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.666
your cardio fitness level.

323
00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:29.966
Activity Trends will
provide you with a more

324
00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:33.033
complete picture of what
you can do to stay active

325
00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:35.700
and even more importantly,
give you the motivation

326
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:38.433
you need for
long-term success.

326
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:38.433
you need for
long-term success.

327
00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.333
(Applause)

328
00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:46.799
Now, let's talk about
your hearing health.

329
00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.933
Your hearing is
a precious asset.

330
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.666
Think about the sounds
that surround you every

331
00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.333
day, hearing a friend's
laughter, listening to

331
00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.333
day, hearing a friend's
laughter, listening to

332
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.799
your favorite song.

333
00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.666
Protecting your hearing is
critical to living your

334
00:18:57.733 --> 00:19:00.099
everyday life and
maintaining your

335
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.666
independence as you age.

336
00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.933
Since hearing loss is
often so gradual, it's

336
00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.933
Since hearing loss is
often so gradual, it's

337
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.900
important to know when the
sounds around you are loud

338
00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:08.966
enough to impact
your hearing.

339
00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:11.000
Like when you are in the
middle of a construction

340
00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:13.799
zone, at a sporting event
or playing your music

341
00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:15.966
really loud to drown
out your singing voice.

342
00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:17.633
I do that all of the time.

342
00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:17.633
I do that all of the time.

343
00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.866
The new Noise app uses
the microphone to detect

344
00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:23.566
decibel levels and can
notify you if it's reached

345
00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:26.033
a level that could impact
your hearing over time.

346
00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:28.400
Because the Watch is always
on your wrist, it's in a

347
00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:31.099
great position to monitor
your environmental noise.

347
00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:31.099
great position to monitor
your environmental noise.

348
00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:34.200
If you tap the Noise app,
you will get more detail

349
00:19:34.266 --> 00:19:36.666
and you can use the
complication to check with

350
00:19:36.733 --> 00:19:38.200
just the raise of a wrist.

351
00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:41.533
It's an easy way to
protect your hearing health.

352
00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:44.400
And, of course, this
feature was designed with

352
00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:44.400
And, of course, this
feature was designed with

353
00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:46.433
privacy in mind.

354
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.633
It only periodically
samples and does not

355
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.900
record or save any audio.

356
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.833
(Applause)

357
00:19:58.233 --> 00:20:01.000
We think the Noise app
is really going to make

358
00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.700
a big impact.

359
00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.433
Now, there is one more
new feature in health and

360
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.733
fitness and all of the
women out there, pay close

361
00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:09.466
attention because
this one is for you.

361
00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:09.466
attention because
this one is for you.

362
00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:10.599
Cycle Tracking.

363
00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.166
(Applause)

364
00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:18.266
Knowing more about your
menstrual cycle gives you

365
00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:20.566
a window into your health,
from simply ensuring that

366
00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.333
you are prepared, to
understanding your

366
00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.333
you are prepared, to
understanding your

367
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.133
personal patterns
and regularities.

368
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.933
As a physician, I know
that understanding what's

369
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.666
normal for you is critical
in making informed

370
00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:32.266
clinical decisions
and can really enrich

371
00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:34.066
conversations
with your doctor.

372
00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:38.233
So, in watchOS 6, the
Cycle Tracking app gives

373
00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:40.766
you a simple, discreet
ways to visualize your

374
00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:45.400
cycle right on your wrist
and it's really easy to use.

375
00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:48.166
You can log key aspects of
your period and fertility,

375
00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:48.166
You can log key aspects of
your period and fertility,

376
00:20:48.233 --> 00:20:51.166
including symptoms, and
you can be notified when

377
00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:52.666
it's about to begin.

378
00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.066
You can also choose to
receive a fertile window

379
00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:57.633
prediction so you
are better informed.

380
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.066
This feature is available
on Apple Watch and because

381
00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.533
we wanted to make this
available to hundreds of

381
00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.533
we wanted to make this
available to hundreds of

382
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:05.333
millions of women around
the world, Cycle Tracking

383
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.333
is also available without a Watch in the Health app and iOS.

384
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.966
(Applause)

385
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.066
Yes, for everybody to use.

385
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.066
Yes, for everybody to use.

386
00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:16.000
(Applause)

387
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.066
You can use it on your
iPhone to do all of those

388
00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.500
same functions that
can be done on Watch.

389
00:21:22.566 --> 00:21:25.233
We are so excited to
bring more focus to this

390
00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.066
incredibly important
aspect of women's health.

390
00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.066
incredibly important
aspect of women's health.

391
00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:29.466
Now, back to Kevin.

392
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:31.666
(Applause)

393
00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:33.666
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Sumbul.

394
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.633
So, the Health app is the
best way to see all of

394
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.633
So, the Health app is the
best way to see all of

395
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.966
your health data in
one place, and we have

396
00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:44.866
redesigned it to be
even more personal and

397
00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:46.066
meaningful to you.

398
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.500
In the new summary view,
you can see health

399
00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:50.433
related notifications.

400
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.333
You'll see your favorites,
the information you care

401
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.133
about most, as well as
automatically generated

401
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.133
about most, as well as
automatically generated

402
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.566
highlights so you can see
your health data over time.

403
00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:00.233
For example, if you are
more active than you

404
00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.099
usually are, how
consistently you may have

405
00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:04.500
been mindful this week,
or how your heart rate

406
00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:06.366
recovered after
a recent workout.

406
00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:06.366
recovered after
a recent workout.

407
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.500
Health is using machine
learning on your iPhone to

408
00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:11.066
determine which
highlights might be most

409
00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:12.799
interesting to you.

410
00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:14.533
So, the new Health app is
going to bring you even

411
00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.766
more powerful
perspective on your health.

412
00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:19.900
Now, all of this health
data is securely stored in

412
00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:19.900
Now, all of this health
data is securely stored in

413
00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:23.066
your iPhone or encrypted
in iCloud, and since there

414
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.599
is nothing more private
than your health

415
00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:26.966
information, you
control your data.

416
00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:28.866
You can decide if you want
to share particular health

417
00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:30.700
data with selected apps,
if you would like to share

418
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.000
anything at all.

419
00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:34.766
Those are some of the
great new features coming

420
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.000
to watchOS 6.

421
00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:38.166
To give you a look at some
of this running live,

422
00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.200
please welcome to the
stage, watchOS program

423
00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:41.866
lead, Haley Allen.

424
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.700
(Applause)

425
00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:51.366
>> HALEY ALLEN:
Thanks so much, Kevin.

426
00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:53.766
I have been loving watchOS
6 and I'm super excited to

427
00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:55.866
have the opportunity to
show it to you today.

428
00:22:55.933 --> 00:22:57.900
Let's start with a few
of my favorite faces.

429
00:22:58.366 --> 00:23:00.966
This is the new modular
compact face and now I can

430
00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.133
have a large info graph
complication alongside

431
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.700
a beautiful dial.

432
00:23:04.766 --> 00:23:06.366
And there is even room in
the corner for a couple of

433
00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.666
my favorite rich
complications like these

434
00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:10.633
two new ones,
wind and rain.

435
00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:13.500
Let's tap customize and
check out some of the options.

436
00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:18.666
This is the new Noise
complication which tells

437
00:23:18.733 --> 00:23:20.400
me how loud it is in here.

438
00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:21.733
It's pretty quiet.

439
00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:23.333
Let's make some noise
and see how this works.

440
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.266
(Applause)

440
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.266
(Applause)

441
00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:29.299
Amazing.

442
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.000
Thank you.

443
00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:30.666
That's great.

444
00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:33.000
The next face I want to
show you is one of our

445
00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:35.099
most popular faces and
this year we have made it

446
00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:38.333
even cooler because you
can customize it to our

446
00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:38.333
even cooler because you
can customize it to our

447
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.666
all new monochrome style.

448
00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:42.766
I love the simplicity
of this two-tone look.

449
00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:46.400
In the middle here is the
Audiobooks complication and

450
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:48.799
I can just tap on it and
resume right where I left off.

451
00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:51.633
And the Now Playing controls
on watchOS 6 are great,

451
00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:51.633
And the Now Playing controls
on watchOS 6 are great,

452
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.500
showing me exactly
what I need to see for that app.

453
00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.666
In Audiobooks, I can tap
here at the bottom and

454
00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:58.866
find that chapter I want
to listen to again.

455
00:23:58.933 --> 00:24:02.366
It's never been easier to
listen to great books on the go.

456
00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:06.000
The last face I want to
show you is the gradient face.

457
00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:08.233
Kevin showed you how
beautiful it looks full

458
00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.066
screen and I can also
customize it to add all of

459
00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:13.799
my favorite rich
complications.

460
00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:16.033
I'm constantly
multitasking.

460
00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:16.033
I'm constantly
multitasking.

461
00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:18.533
With a busy job and a son
at home sometimes I only

462
00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:20.866
have a moment to
capture a quick thought.

463
00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:23.033
Let me tap on the Voice
Memos complication in the

464
00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:24.933
bottom right corner
and do that now.

465
00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.400
Remind Marcus that just
because you are almost seven

465
00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.400
Remind Marcus that just
because you are almost seven

466
00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:33.500
does not mean you get to, quote, "Veto your bedtime."

467
00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:36.900
Okay.

468
00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:39.033
Now, I'm super excited to
give you the first look at

469
00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.599
the all new App Store.

470
00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:45.799
With curated collections
and apps, it's super easy

471
00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:49.066
to discover and download
great apps for the Watch.

472
00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:50.866
Let's check out Chineasy.

473
00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:55.099
I can just tap here to see
ratings and screenshots.

473
00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:55.099
I can just tap here to see
ratings and screenshots.

474
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:58.666
And I can download it
directly from my Watch.

475
00:24:58.733 --> 00:25:00.200
It's super convenient.

476
00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.766
Let me show you an app I
have already downloaded,

477
00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.366
the MLB app.

478
00:25:04.433 --> 00:25:07.000
With the new audio
streaming APIs in watchOS 6,

479
00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:10.133
I can listen in to any
live game no matter where I am.

479
00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:10.133
I can listen in to any
live game no matter where I am.

480
00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:12.566
Now, they aren't actually
playing right now, but let

482
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.400
>> MALE SPEAKER: Two,
one, pitch coming.

483
00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:20.200
A swing and high
drive to right field.

484
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:22.266
Going back to the
track, it's got a shot.

484
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:22.266
Going back to the
track, it's got a shot.

485
00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:23.133
Right at the wall.

486
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.133
It is gone.

487
00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:26.133
>> HALEY ALLEN: Yes,
isn't that cool?

488
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.099
Come on.

489
00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:28.366
(Applause)

490
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.266
All right.

491
00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:32.966
Thanks so much.

492
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.466
Those are just a few
highlights in watchOS 6.

492
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.466
Those are just a few
highlights in watchOS 6.

493
00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:36.533
I think you are
going to love it.

494
00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.599
Back to you, Kevin.

495
00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:39.700
(Applause)

496
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.733
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Haley.

497
00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:46.166
That was really cool.

498
00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:48.500
Now, there is so much
more to watchOS 6, like

498
00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:48.500
Now, there is so much
more to watchOS 6, like

499
00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:51.299
recognizing songs with
Shazam built right in and

500
00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:53.666
automatic software updates
right on your Watch.

501
00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:57.200
Now, lastly, we know how
personalized you like to

502
00:25:57.266 --> 00:25:59.299
make Watch from the Watch
faces to the physical

503
00:25:59.366 --> 00:26:01.933
bands, and we are
introducing today some new

503
00:25:59.366 --> 00:26:01.933
bands, and we are
introducing today some new

504
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.566
summer colors and an all-new Pride edition Watch band.

505
00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:08.333
(Applause)

506
00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:14.466
It matches perfectly with
the new pride Watch face

506
00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:14.466
It matches perfectly with
the new pride Watch face

507
00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:15.900
on your Watch.

508
00:26:16.233 --> 00:26:18.433
So, watchOS 6 is another
large step forward for

509
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.966
Watch and it is really an
honor for the team to be

510
00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:23.099
crafting something so
personal to all of you.

511
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:24.299
Thank you and back to Tim.

512
00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:26.266
(Applause)

512
00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:26.266
(Applause)

513
00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:32.466
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Kevin.

514
00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:34.900
All of these great new
features will make the Apple

515
00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:39.866
Watch an even more indispensable part of your daily life.

515
00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:39.866
Watch an even more indispensable part of your daily life.

516
00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:43.366
Now, let's talk about iOS,
the world's most powerful

517
00:26:43.433 --> 00:26:44.599
mobile Operating System.

518
00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:46.266
(Applause)

519
00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:51.933
Last year, we delivered
iOS 12 which is full of

520
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.666
amazing features from
dynamic new AR experiences

521
00:26:55.733 --> 00:27:00.633
and Memoji to screen time
and faster performance,

522
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.366
and once again, iOS has
the highest customer

523
00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:07.066
satisfaction in the
industry with an

523
00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:07.066
satisfaction in the
industry with an

524
00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:09.666
incredible 97%.

525
00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:11.366
This is unbelievable.

526
00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:12.900
(Applause)

527
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:17.666
And as always, our
adoption rate is industry

528
00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:19.500
leading as well.

528
00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:19.500
leading as well.

529
00:27:19.566 --> 00:27:24.366
85% of iOS customers are
on the latest release.

530
00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:27.833
And in fact, iOS 12 has
been installed on more

531
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.500
systems than any
version of iOS ever.

531
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.500
systems than any
version of iOS ever.

532
00:27:32.566 --> 00:27:35.433
Now, that's in stark
contrast to the latest

533
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.000
offering from those other
guys which was released

534
00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:45.833
before iOS 12; they
only have 10% adoption.

534
00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:45.833
before iOS 12; they
only have 10% adoption.

535
00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:49.533
(Applause)

536
00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:58.000
Now, this high adoption
rate is a huge benefit for

536
00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:58.000
Now, this high adoption
rate is a huge benefit for

537
00:27:58.066 --> 00:28:01.599
both users and developers.

538
00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:04.966
Now, to tell you about the
next major release of iOS,

539
00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:07.566
I'd like to hand
it over to Craig.

540
00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:08.533
Craig.

541
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.566
(Applause)

541
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.566
(Applause)

542
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.333
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Hello.

543
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.866
Thank you.

544
00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:19.633
Thank you.

545
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.200
Okay.

545
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.200
Okay.

546
00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:26.799
I'd like to talk -
all right, we've got a lot

547
00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:27.966
to talk about
this morning.

548
00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:33.766
I'd like to talk about our
next big release of iOS.

549
00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:36.366
Now, when it came to
naming this release, our

549
00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:36.366
Now, when it came to
naming this release, our

550
00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.833
crack marketing team
really surprised us this

551
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.166
year by demonstrating
their ability to count

552
00:28:42.233 --> 00:28:44.833
well into the
double digits.

553
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.766
Yes, it's iOS 13.

554
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.766
(Applause)

555
00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:55.566
Now, iOS 13 is a huge
release packed with lots

556
00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.166
of capabilities, but we
know that nothing is more

557
00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:02.866
important to our iPhone
users than performance.

557
00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:02.866
important to our iPhone
users than performance.

558
00:29:02.933 --> 00:29:05.400
So, this year, we worked
top to bottom in the

559
00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:08.599
system, making everything
faster that you do the most.

560
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:15.166
Things like unlocking with
Face ID, now 30% faster.

560
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:15.166
Things like unlocking with
Face ID, now 30% faster.

561
00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:17.433
(Applause)

562
00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:19.533
Now, this one is cool.

563
00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:21.700
We have changed the way
that we are packaging apps

564
00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:24.400
on the App Store, and when
this rolls out in the fall

565
00:29:24.466 --> 00:29:27.566
with iOS 13, you will see
that your downloads are

566
00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.700
now 50% smaller.

566
00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.700
now 50% smaller.

567
00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:33.866
And updates, 60% smaller.

568
00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:35.700
But what's - yes.

569
00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:37.466
(Applause)

570
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.266
But what's really
incredible is the effect

571
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.833
it has on app
launch speed.

572
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.866
It's up to twice
as fast in iOS 13.

573
00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.333
(Applause)

574
00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:58.333
Now, we were able to do
this in a release packed

575
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.566
with new features and
there is one that I think

576
00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:02.733
is going to really
resonate with some of you

577
00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.133
here and I would like to
introduce it to you now.

578
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.233
Let's take a look.

579
00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:13.933
(Music playing)

580
00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:55.599
(Applause)

581
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:56.866
That's right.

582
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:04.166
We are bringing
Dark Mode to iOS.

583
00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.533
(Applause)

584
00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:08.966
I'd love to show
it to you live now.

585
00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:10.366
(Cheer)

586
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:11.233
All right.

587
00:31:11.566 --> 00:31:12.533
(Laughter)

587
00:31:11.566 --> 00:31:12.533
(Laughter)

588
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:15.466
Okay.

589
00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:19.033
Let's take our first
live look at iOS.

590
00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:21.266
Now, here it is in
its traditional light

591
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:24.533
appearance with this
gorgeous new wallpaper,

592
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.833
but now let's begin our
descent into darkness.

592
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.833
but now let's begin our
descent into darkness.

593
00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:28.733
(Laughter)

594
00:31:29.366 --> 00:31:30.099
Look at that.

595
00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:32.066
The gorgeous dark
wallpaper and

596
00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:34.066
notifications look great.

597
00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:36.233
Let's take a look
at our Widgets.

598
00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:37.566
They look just awesome.

599
00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:40.500
Let's take a look
at some apps.

600
00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:42.200
We will start with News.

601
00:31:42.266 --> 00:31:45.633
Check it out with a
gorgeous dark appearance,

602
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.633
so nice.

603
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.299
And your calendar, your
daily events have never

604
00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:54.000
looked so awesome with
this really beautiful palette.

604
00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:54.000
looked so awesome with
this really beautiful palette.

605
00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.166
And Notes.

606
00:31:56.233 --> 00:32:01.366
Look at this refined
texture, it's really fantastic.

607
00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:04.000
Let's take a trip
into Messages.

608
00:32:04.066 --> 00:32:08.166
You see how your images,
your emoji, they all look

609
00:32:08.233 --> 00:32:10.466
just fantastic.

610
00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:12.366
And, of course, the
keyboard, with an extra

611
00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:15.766
refined new dark
appearance and some new

612
00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:20.033
tricks because now when
you type, you can swipe.

612
00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:20.033
tricks because now when
you type, you can swipe.

613
00:32:20.233 --> 00:32:22.433
(Applause)

614
00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:26.566
Just like that.

615
00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:27.900
It's really great.

616
00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:32.366
Let's take a
look at Photos.

617
00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:35.266
Of course, it looks
fantastic in Dark Mode.

618
00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:38.400
Now, this is our Dark
Mode Project Team at the

619
00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:39.633
project kickoff.

620
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.299
You see it was happy times.

620
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.299
You see it was happy times.

621
00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:47.766
They did slowly begin
their descent into darkness.

622
00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:51.666
We take the details
very seriously.

623
00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:54.099
Let's take a look at
our new share sheet.

624
00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.599
It looks awesome in Dark
Mode, but you notice in

624
00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.599
It looks awesome in Dark
Mode, but you notice in

625
00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:59.733
the middle sharing
suggestions intelligently

626
00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.833
based on who you share
with and who appears

627
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.833
in the photos.

628
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.966
You can share
with just a tap.

629
00:33:06.033 --> 00:33:07.566
It's so fast and easy.

630
00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:10.666
And finally, music.

630
00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:10.666
And finally, music.

631
00:33:10.733 --> 00:33:13.366
Your music looks
great in Dark Mode.

632
00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:16.900
It can go through some
of my recent play back.

633
00:33:16.966 --> 00:33:18.966
Of course, start playing
some music here.

634
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.333
And now for the first time
ever, time synced lyrics.

634
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.333
And now for the first time
ever, time synced lyrics.

635
00:33:25.933 --> 00:33:30.233
(Applause)

636
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:40.866
And that is a quick look
at what's new with Dark

637
00:33:40.933 --> 00:33:43.633
Mode in iOS 13.

638
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:45.633
(Applause)

639
00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:51.766
So, great performance,
intelligent sharing, the

640
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:55.333
new quick path keyboard
and Dark Mode.

641
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.400
But, of course, there
is much more to iOS 13,

642
00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:00.866
starting with apps.

643
00:34:01.366 --> 00:34:03.799
Let's start with Safari,
Mail, and Notes.

644
00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:06.666
Now, Safari has new
options to quickly change

645
00:34:06.733 --> 00:34:10.065
text sizing and has per
website preferences.

646
00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:14.000
Mail gets desktop class
text formatting controls,

647
00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:16.433
including support
for rich fonts.

648
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.500
And Notes gets this
beautiful new gallery

649
00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:22.833
view, support for shared
folders, and much more.

650
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.599
But where we really went
deep is with Reminders.

651
00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:28.933
We have completely
reinvented the app,

651
00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:28.933
We have completely
reinvented the app,

652
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.300
rewriting it from the
ground up to make it more

653
00:34:31.366 --> 00:34:34.433
intelligent, intuitive and
powerful and easier than

654
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.000
ever to create Reminders.

655
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.433
So, for instance, just
type what you want and

656
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.866
Reminders will understand
when and where to notify you.

656
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.866
Reminders will understand
when and where to notify you.

657
00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:45.533
Or you can use the new
quick type bar; just tap

658
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.300
and enter things like
location or even

659
00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:50.800
attachments like photos.

660
00:34:50.866 --> 00:34:54.132
With tasks, you can now
associate to-dos with a

660
00:34:50.866 --> 00:34:54.132
With tasks, you can now
associate to-dos with a

661
00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.933
top-level reminder.

662
00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:59.066
Now, smart lists, they
help you keep track of

663
00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:02.233
your most important items
and, if you tag a person

664
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.766
in a reminder, well, next
time you are in a Messages

665
00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.733
conversation, you will
automatically get a

665
00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.733
conversation, you will
automatically get a

666
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.300
notification letting them
know that now is time to talk.

667
00:35:10.366 --> 00:35:11.800
It's really handy.

668
00:35:11.966 --> 00:35:14.166
Next, Maps.

669
00:35:14.233 --> 00:35:16.900
Maps is with you
everywhere you are from

670
00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:21.300
work, home, or even on
the go with CarPlay.

670
00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:21.300
work, home, or even on
the go with CarPlay.

671
00:35:21.366 --> 00:35:24.033
And our team continues its
obsession with building

672
00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:26.433
the best possible map.

673
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.766
Now, we have outfitted
literally hundreds of

674
00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:32.533
planes and cars with
custom sensors and lidar

674
00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:32.533
planes and cars with
custom sensors and lidar

675
00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:35.966
and driven over four
million miles to rebuild

676
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:39.433
our map from the ground
up, and the results

677
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500
are really impressive.

678
00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:46.099
Here is our old map and
here is the new map.

678
00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:46.099
Here is our old map and
here is the new map.

679
00:35:46.633 --> 00:35:48.500
(Applause)

680
00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:54.966
It's just great.

681
00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:58.133
Now, we expect to roll out
this map across the entire

681
00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:58.133
Now, we expect to roll out
this map across the entire

682
00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.866
US by the end of this year
and select other

683
00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:02.433
countries next year.

684
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.400
But we didn't stop there.

685
00:36:03.466 --> 00:36:05.900
There is much more to
Maps, and to give you a

686
00:36:05.966 --> 00:36:08.099
quick look at what's new,
I would like to invite

687
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.466
Meg Frost, our Director of
Product Design to the

687
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.466
Meg Frost, our Director of
Product Design to the

688
00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:12.599
stage for a quick demo.

689
00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:13.133
Meg.

690
00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:16.533
>> MEG FROST: All right.

691
00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:19.099
All right.

692
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.166
Thank you.

693
00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:26.233
I'm so happy to show you
what's new in Apple Maps.

693
00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:26.233
I'm so happy to show you
what's new in Apple Maps.

694
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.133
All right.

695
00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:29.566
First, let's take a
look at that new map.

696
00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:33.033
As Craig said, we have
been driving and flying

697
00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:37.366
all across the United States, collecting land and aerial

697
00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:37.366
all across the United States, collecting land and aerial

698
00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:41.966
data to add significant
new detail to the map.

699
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.833
So, now roads and beaches,
parks and buildings look great.

700
00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.500
We have also added a
couple of very useful new

700
00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.500
We have also added a
couple of very useful new

701
00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:55.099
features to our recently
designed launch screen

702
00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:58.199
like favorites, where I
can add the places I go

703
00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:01.533
every day for quick
and easy access.

704
00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.199
Now, I can just
tap and go.

704
00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.199
Now, I can just
tap and go.

705
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.699
And with collections, this
is where I can organize

706
00:37:09.766 --> 00:37:12.966
all of my favorites
or I can make lists of

707
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:16.433
favorites to share with
friends, or I can finally

707
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:16.433
favorites to share with
friends, or I can finally

708
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.033
organize that
next big trip.

709
00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:23.266
Let's check out my
SF spots collection.

710
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:26.233
Now, I have been
checking out Chinatown.

711
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.300
You will notice in the
upper right-hand corner,

711
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.300
You will notice in the
upper right-hand corner,

712
00:37:29.366 --> 00:37:31.599
there is a new
binoculars button.

713
00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:37.033
When I tap that, I get
a brand-new look around window.

714
00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:39.900
Yes, this is the right
place to drop in, so I'm

715
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.366
going to go full screen.

715
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.366
going to go full screen.

716
00:37:42.433 --> 00:37:46.800
With look around,
I get a gorgeous, high

717
00:37:46.866 --> 00:37:49.666
definition 3D view.

718
00:37:49.733 --> 00:37:52.400
It's an awesome
way to explore.

719
00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:54.033
(Applause)

720
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.199
But this is my
favorite part.

721
00:38:01.266 --> 00:38:04.199
Turn your phone
and hold on tight.

722
00:38:06.366 --> 00:38:08.300
Smoothly move
down the street.

722
00:38:06.366 --> 00:38:08.300
Smoothly move
down the street.

723
00:38:08.366 --> 00:38:09.400
(Applause)

724
00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:12.000
Yep, I bet you haven't
seen it look like that before.

725
00:38:15.966 --> 00:38:19.199
I can tap on labels to
learn more about new places.

726
00:38:19.766 --> 00:38:23.033
Yes, I think I will check
this one out later.

726
00:38:19.766 --> 00:38:23.033
Yes, I think I will check
this one out later.

727
00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:26.766
And those are just a few
of the new features that

728
00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:29.199
we will be bringing
to Apple Maps.

729
00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:31.099
Thanks, and back
to you, Craig.

730
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.066
(Applause)

731
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.266
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Meg.

732
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:40.633
Now, we think Maps users
are really going to love

733
00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:43.599
favorites, collections and
look around, but there is

734
00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:47.199
much more to Maps, like
junction view for China,

734
00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:47.199
much more to Maps, like
junction view for China,

735
00:38:47.266 --> 00:38:49.433
or the ability when you
are en route to share an

736
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.466
up to date ETA with
friends and family with

737
00:38:52.533 --> 00:38:53.599
just a tap.

738
00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:56.666
But what's most important
is that Maps has been

739
00:38:56.733 --> 00:38:59.800
designed to be
private and secure.

740
00:38:59.866 --> 00:39:02.966
We always protect your
identity and activity, and

740
00:38:59.866 --> 00:39:02.966
We always protect your
identity and activity, and

741
00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:05.666
there is no need to flip
a switch to ask Maps to

742
00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:09.099
start respecting your
privacy because at Apple,

743
00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.366
we believe privacy is a
fundamental human right

744
00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:15.866
and we engineer it
into everything we do.

744
00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:15.866
and we engineer it
into everything we do.

745
00:39:16.666 --> 00:39:18.766
This year, we are
doing even more.

746
00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:22.900
I want to focus on three big areas starting with location.

747
00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:25.900
Sharing your location with
a third-party app can

748
00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:28.433
really enable some useful
experiences, but we don't

748
00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:28.433
really enable some useful
experiences, but we don't

749
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.133
expect to have that
privilege used to track us,

750
00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:36.000
and so this year we are building in even more protections.

751
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.566
Now, for the first time,
you can share your

752
00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:42.066
location to an app just
once, and then require it

752
00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:42.066
location to an app just
once, and then require it

753
00:39:42.133 --> 00:39:43.633
to ask you again next
time it wants it.

754
00:39:43.833 --> 00:39:44.599
(Applause)

755
00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:53.500
And if you do choose to
grant an app the ability

755
00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:53.500
And if you do choose to
grant an app the ability

756
00:39:53.566 --> 00:39:55.366
to continually monitor
your location in the

757
00:39:55.433 --> 00:39:58.166
background, we will give
you reports so you will

758
00:39:58.233 --> 00:40:00.466
know what they are up to.

759
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.766
Now, some apps try to work
around these protections

760
00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:06.533
by scanning for Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi signals to infer

760
00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:06.533
by scanning for Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi signals to infer

761
00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:08.133
your location.

762
00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:11.133
Well, we are shutting the
door on that abuse as well.

763
00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:12.933
(Applause)

764
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:21.133
Next, I want to
turn to log in.

764
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:21.133
Next, I want to
turn to log in.

765
00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:23.666
We have all seen buttons
like this, asking us to

766
00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:26.500
use a social account
log in to get a more

767
00:40:26.566 --> 00:40:29.166
personalized experience
with an app.

768
00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:32.400
Now, this can be
convenient, but it also

768
00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:32.400
Now, this can be
convenient, but it also

769
00:40:32.466 --> 00:40:35.266
can come at the cost
of your privacy.

770
00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.300
Your personal information
sometimes gets shared

771
00:40:37.366 --> 00:40:40.099
behind the scenes and
these log ins can be used

772
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:42.033
to track you.

773
00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:46.000
We wanted to solve this
and many developers do too.

773
00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:46.000
We wanted to solve this
and many developers do too.

774
00:40:46.066 --> 00:40:48.066
So, now we have
the solution.

775
00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:49.866
It's called sign
in with Apple.

776
00:40:50.066 --> 00:40:52.000
(Applause)

777
00:41:00.366 --> 00:41:03.266
Sign in with Apple is the
fast, easy way to sign in

778
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:05.666
without all of
the tracking.

779
00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:08.966
Its simple API allows the
developer to put a sign in

780
00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.033
with Apple button
in their app.

780
00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.033
with Apple button
in their app.

781
00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:13.666
You just tap it and you
are authenticated with

782
00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:17.400
Face ID on your device,
logged in with a new

783
00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:21.199
account without revealing
any new personal information.

784
00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:24.166
(Applause)

784
00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:24.166
(Applause)

785
00:41:27.866 --> 00:41:31.133
Now, some apps may want
your name, and maybe even

786
00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:33.266
an email to send you
information when you are

787
00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:34.766
outside the app.

788
00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:38.199
Now, we do allow them to
request this information,

788
00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:38.199
Now, we do allow them to
request this information,

789
00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:42.666
but check this out; you
can choose to share your

790
00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:46.933
actual email address or
you can choose to hide it,

791
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.233
and when you do, we will
create a unique random

791
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.233
and when you do, we will
create a unique random

792
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.000
address that forwards
to your real address.

793
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.333
(Applause)

794
00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:10.433
Yeah.

795
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500
A lot of love for
random addresses here.

796
00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:15.166
And that's good news
because we give each app a

796
00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:15.166
And that's good news
because we give each app a

797
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:16.833
unique random address.

798
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.666
This means you can disable
any one of them at any

799
00:42:19.733 --> 00:42:22.366
time when you are tired
of hearing from that app.

800
00:42:22.433 --> 00:42:24.033
It's really great.

801
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400
(Applause)

802
00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.333
So, of course, this entire
experience is meant to

803
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.733
help you have control
over your data.

804
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.833
Now, this is available
across all of our

805
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.433
platforms, and
also on the Web.

805
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.433
platforms, and
also on the Web.

806
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.166
Now, next I want
to turn to HomeKit.

807
00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:49.366
You know, our homes are
such personal places,

808
00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:52.766
places where we deserve
to feel safe and secure.

809
00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:55.433
So, HomeKit has been
designed from the outset

809
00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:55.433
So, HomeKit has been
designed from the outset

810
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.800
to protect the privacy and
security in your use of

811
00:42:58.866 --> 00:43:00.099
home accessories.

812
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:03.199
And no accessory is more
personal than security

813
00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:07.766
cameras that film in
and around your home.

813
00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:07.766
cameras that film in
and around your home.

814
00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:11.833
Now, unfortunately, most
home cameras today send

815
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.766
people's video up to
the Cloud, so it can be

816
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:16.800
analyzed to tell the
difference between maybe a

817
00:43:16.866 --> 00:43:19.900
leaf blowing in the wind
and someone at your door,

818
00:43:19.966 --> 00:43:23.333
but unfortunately, this
risks your privacy.

818
00:43:19.966 --> 00:43:23.333
but unfortunately, this
risks your privacy.

819
00:43:23.766 --> 00:43:28.766
We have a new way; it's
called HomeKit Secure Video.

820
00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:30.433
Now, yes.

821
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.233
HomeKit Secure Video, in
that case the video is

821
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.233
HomeKit Secure Video, in
that case the video is

822
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.733
analyzed in your home
on your resident iPad,

823
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.033
HomePod or Apple TV and
then it is encrypted and

824
00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:45.366
securely sent to iCloud
where no one, not even

825
00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:47.033
Apple, can see it.

825
00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:47.033
Apple, can see it.

826
00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:49.133
(Applause)

827
00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:54.966
Now, of course, you will
be alerted if there is any

828
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.900
activity, and you will be
able to review the recordings.

829
00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:01.333
Now, storage for ten days
of clips will be included

829
00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:01.333
Now, storage for ten days
of clips will be included

830
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.833
in your existing iCloud
accounts and it won't

831
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.300
count against
your storage.

832
00:44:06.866 --> 00:44:07.766
Yeah.

833
00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:11.000
Netatmo, Logitech and Eufy
will be among the first to

834
00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.266
provide these cameras
with more to come.

834
00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.266
provide these cameras
with more to come.

835
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:18.433
Now, in addition to
cameras, HomeKit supports

836
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.900
a wide variety of
other accessories.

837
00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:22.833
But many accessories don't just connect via HomeKit; they also

838
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.666
connect via the Internet
and through your router.

838
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.666
connect via the Internet
and through your router.

839
00:44:27.033 --> 00:44:31.400
Unfortunately, this can
leave them open to attack

840
00:44:31.466 --> 00:44:34.199
and we want to make sure
that this can't happen.

841
00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:38.099
And so, we are bringing
HomeKit to routers.

841
00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:38.099
And so, we are bringing
HomeKit to routers.

842
00:44:38.633 --> 00:44:40.333
Now, with HomeKit at
the router, we will

843
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.733
automatically firewall off
each of your accessories

844
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.099
so even if one were to be
compromised, it wouldn't

845
00:44:46.166 --> 00:44:48.199
be able to access
your other devices or

846
00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:51.366
compromise your
personal information.

846
00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:51.366
compromise your
personal information.

847
00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:53.300
The first HomeKit enabled
routers will be coming

848
00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:57.300
from Linksys, Eero and
Internet service providers

849
00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:59.566
like Charter Spectrum.

850
00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:01.666
(Applause)

851
00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.866
Next up, Messages.

852
00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:10.966
Now, we have all received
messages like this, like

853
00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:12.733
who is this guy?

854
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.699
Well, wouldn't it be
better if you could see

855
00:45:14.766 --> 00:45:19.333
something like this,
or maybe even this?

855
00:45:14.766 --> 00:45:19.333
something like this,
or maybe even this?

856
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.966
Well, now you can because
with iOS 13, you and the

857
00:45:24.033 --> 00:45:26.099
people you message with
will be able to share your

858
00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:30.000
name and your photo, and
even use Memoji or Animoji

859
00:45:30.066 --> 00:45:32.133
to create a photo
of yourself.

860
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.033
Now, this information
is only shared when you

861
00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:37.433
message with someone, so
you are completely in

862
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.233
control of who sees
your name and picture.

863
00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:42.866
Now, since we are all
going to be creating a lot

864
00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:45.400
more Memoji, we wanted to
make them even better at

864
00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:45.400
more Memoji, we wanted to
make them even better at

865
00:45:45.466 --> 00:45:48.199
reflecting our own
personal style, so we've

866
00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:51.233
added a huge amount of
new options for makeup,

867
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.400
accessories and
so much more.

868
00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:56.166
I would like to have some
experts give you a quick look.

868
00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:56.166
I would like to have some
experts give you a quick look.

00:46:41.366 --> 00:46:43.166
>> DESI PERKINS: You can
customize your teeth and hair?

897
00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:46.166
Oh, braces, gap
tooth, missing tooth.

898
00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:47.233
>> PATRICK STARR:
A mini grill.

>> DESI PERKINS: Earrings,
do you think this will be cool?

900
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.366
I'm allergic to
fake jewelry.

901
00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:54.400
>> PATRICK STARR:
Okay, moving on, hair.

902
00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:55.733
How about this?

903
00:46:56.199 --> 00:46:57.500
>> DESI PERKINS: We have
to screenshot these.

904
00:46:59.866 --> 00:47:00.933
What else?

905
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.566
Hats.

906
00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:02.400
>> PATRICK STARR: Hats.

907
00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:06.766

909
00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:10.433
What do we have here?

Don't forget to like and subscribe. Thanks.

918
00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:23.733
>> DESI PERKINS: And Craig,
I have a few tips for you.

919
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.000
Let's connect
after the show.

920
00:47:27.133 --> 00:47:29.099
(Applause)

921
00:47:34.533 --> 00:47:36.333
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, I
think that's given us all

922
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.533
a great deal
to think about.

923
00:47:37.733 --> 00:47:38.599
(Laughter)

924
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.466
Now, we are all going
to have a lot of fun

924
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.466
Now, we are all going
to have a lot of fun

925
00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:43.933
personalizing our own
Memoji and so we wanted to

926
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.733
give you even more
ways to use them.

927
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.933
So, we are introducing
something new.

928
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.233
It's called
Memoji stickers.

929
00:47:51.466 --> 00:47:53.333
(Applause)

929
00:47:51.466 --> 00:47:53.333
(Applause)

930
00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:57.533
Now, instead of expressing
yourself like this with

931
00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:00.166
emoji in your
conversations, you can now

932
00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:03.533
do it like this.

933
00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:05.733
We automatically create a
sticker pack for you for

934
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.599
each of your Memoji.

934
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.599
each of your Memoji.

935
00:48:07.666 --> 00:48:09.400
Now, of course, you can
use them in Messages but

936
00:48:09.466 --> 00:48:12.199
we have also incorporated
them right alongside emoji

937
00:48:12.266 --> 00:48:14.933
in the system keyboard so
you can use them in apps

938
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.300
like Mail or your favorite
other apps like WeChat.

938
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.300
like Mail or your favorite
other apps like WeChat.

939
00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:22.033
And we have made these
usable not just in more

940
00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:26.433
apps but also on more
devices because while

941
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.966
actually animating a
Memoji puppet with your

942
00:48:29.033 --> 00:48:31.300
face requires a device
with a True Depth Camera

943
00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:34.366
System, Memoji stickers
and support for the Memoji

943
00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:34.366
System, Memoji stickers
and support for the Memoji

944
00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:38.000
editor is now supported
for all devices with an A9

945
00:48:38.066 --> 00:48:40.000
chip or later.

946
00:48:40.066 --> 00:48:41.266
Next.

947
00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:43.166
(Applause)

948
00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:48.733
Next, I want to turn to
Camera and Photos where we

949
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.833
have given you great new
ways to capture, edit, and

950
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.033
experience your photos.

951
00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:57.033
Now, I'm going to start
with Portrait Lighting

952
00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:00.699
where we put the power of
the studio right in your pocket.

952
00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:00.699
where we put the power of
the studio right in your pocket.

953
00:49:00.766 --> 00:49:04.033
In iOS 13, we are
taking Portrait Lighting to

954
00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:05.433
a new level.

955
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.400
And it starts with a
brand-new effect we call

956
00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:08.833
high key mono.

957
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.533
It looks just amazing.

958
00:49:11.033 --> 00:49:13.333
Now, we are also extending
Portrait Lighting so you

959
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.866
can adjust the intensity
of the Lighting Effect

960
00:49:15.933 --> 00:49:18.066
just like you could in a
lighting studio by moving

961
00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:21.266
the lights closer or
farther away from your subject.

962
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:23.866
So, when you increase the
intensity of the light,

963
00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:26.533
it's like virtually
moving the light closer.

963
00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:26.533
it's like virtually
moving the light closer.

964
00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:29.199
This has the effect
of smoothing skin,

965
00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.699
brightening eyes and
facial features.

966
00:49:31.766 --> 00:49:36.066
Or you can pull it back
for a subtle, more refined look.

967
00:49:36.133 --> 00:49:39.666
And we adapt this effect
uniquely to each style of

967
00:49:36.133 --> 00:49:39.666
And we adapt this effect
uniquely to each style of

968
00:49:39.733 --> 00:49:40.933
Portrait Lighting.

969
00:49:41.699 --> 00:49:44.133
Next, I want to
turn to photo editing.

970
00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:45.966
We have a brand-new
experience so that you

971
00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:48.066
control every
element of your photo.

972
00:49:48.133 --> 00:49:51.533
You can see at a glance
all of your settings, and

972
00:49:48.133 --> 00:49:51.533
You can see at a glance
all of your settings, and

973
00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:55.433
with just a tap and a drag,
you can make adjustments.

974
00:49:56.133 --> 00:49:59.766
It applies across all of
our existing effects and

975
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:03.233
many more that
are new to iOS 13.

975
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:03.233
many more that
are new to iOS 13.

976
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.433
But we are - yes.

977
00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:06.633
(Applause)

978
00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:11.333
But what's really cool is
we are bringing all of

979
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.533
this to video for
the first time.

980
00:50:14.766 --> 00:50:17.266
(Applause)

980
00:50:14.766 --> 00:50:17.266
(Applause)

981
00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:25.366
Now - so now, for the first time, you can rotate a video.

982
00:50:26.133 --> 00:50:26.666
How about it?

983
00:50:26.933 --> 00:50:28.699
(Applause)

984
00:50:31.099 --> 00:50:32.300
But, of course, much more.

985
00:50:32.366 --> 00:50:35.866
You can apply filters and
all of these effects.

986
00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:37.400
It's just awesome.

987
00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:39.900
But, you know, our biggest
change this year is in the

988
00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:43.133
way you can browse and
experience your photos.

988
00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:43.133
way you can browse and
experience your photos.

989
00:50:43.199 --> 00:50:45.566
You know, we all have
so many photos in our

990
00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:48.000
library, so much great
stuff in there, but it's

991
00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:51.866
all often weighed down by
pictures of receipts and

992
00:50:51.933 --> 00:50:54.599
white boards and
screenshots.

993
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:57.300
So, now we are using
advanced machine learning

993
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:57.300
So, now we are using
advanced machine learning

994
00:50:57.366 --> 00:51:00.033
to remove duplicates and
clutter and let you focus

995
00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:01.300
on your best shots.

996
00:51:02.199 --> 00:51:04.066
And we are taking these
photos and we are

997
00:51:04.133 --> 00:51:06.933
intelligently organizing
them to create a sort of

998
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.133
diary of your life.

998
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.133
diary of your life.

999
00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.633
Using this, you will be
amazed at how you discover

1000
00:51:11.699 --> 00:51:14.733
the moments in your life
that matter to you the most.

1001
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.533
Now, we do all of this
inside a brand-new Photos tab.

1002
00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:20.900
And so, to show it to you,
I would like to bring up

1003
00:51:20.966 --> 00:51:24.366
the leader of our photos
app team, Justin Titi, to

1003
00:51:20.966 --> 00:51:24.366
the leader of our photos
app team, Justin Titi, to

1004
00:51:24.433 --> 00:51:25.566
give you a live demo.

1005
00:51:25.633 --> 00:51:26.133
Justin?

1006
00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:31.866
>> JUSTIN TITI:
Thanks, Craig.

1007
00:51:31.933 --> 00:51:33.766
I'm so excited to show you
guys the new Photos app.

1008
00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:35.300
Let's get started.

1008
00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:35.300
Let's get started.

1009
00:51:35.733 --> 00:51:37.300
So, here we are
in all photos.

1010
00:51:37.366 --> 00:51:40.199
It's got a new home right
here in the Photos tab.

1011
00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:42.000
We have also given you
more control over how you

1012
00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:43.900
can view all
of your photos.

1013
00:51:43.966 --> 00:51:46.333
You can simply pinch to
zoom out and see a bunch

1014
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.366
of photos or you can zoom
in and see more detail.

1014
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.366
of photos or you can zoom
in and see more detail.

1015
00:51:49.433 --> 00:51:50.933
It is really
fast and fluid.

1016
00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:53.900
Now, as you can see, I
take a ton of photos of my

1017
00:51:53.966 --> 00:51:56.566
kids trying to capture
that perfect moment.

1018
00:51:56.633 --> 00:52:00.233
Oftentimes my best shots
get lost in the sea of images.

1018
00:51:56.633 --> 00:52:00.233
Oftentimes my best shots
get lost in the sea of images.

1019
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.166
That's what days is for.

1020
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.300
I just tap down
here at the bottom.

1021
00:52:05.366 --> 00:52:07.666
You can see days is
absolutely beautiful.

1022
00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:09.900
The clutter of the
similar photos is gone.

1023
00:52:09.966 --> 00:52:11.766
I can just scroll
and enjoy now.

1024
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.866
So, Photos uses
intelligence to create

1025
00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:18.000
these stunning
layouts of my photos.

1026
00:52:18.066 --> 00:52:20.466
Every day looks great.

1027
00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:25.266
And you can see videos
like this time lapse play

1028
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.199
automatically for me,
really bringing my library

1028
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.199
automatically for me,
really bringing my library

1029
00:52:27.266 --> 00:52:30.199
back to life.

1030
00:52:30.266 --> 00:52:33.199
As do live photos help me
relive those really fun moments.

1031
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.566
And a simple trip to the
farmer's market makes me

1032
00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:40.699
feel like a
professional photographer.

1032
00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:40.699
feel like a
professional photographer.

1033
00:52:42.666 --> 00:52:46.066
So, days is simply the
best way to browse your photos.

1034
00:52:46.133 --> 00:52:47.733
So, let's check
out months.

1035
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.800
I just tap and even moving between views is beautiful.

1036
00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:54.766
So, months organizes the
most meaningful events in

1036
00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:54.766
So, months organizes the
most meaningful events in

1037
00:52:54.833 --> 00:52:56.066
my library by month.

1038
00:52:56.133 --> 00:52:59.566
So here is a trip I took
to Tahoe, my kids' last

1039
00:52:59.633 --> 00:53:04.166
day of school, and
my wife's birthday.

1040
00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.699
Now, this is a video we
all take but we usually

1040
00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.699
Now, this is a video we
all take but we usually

1041
00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:08.266
forget to enjoy and now
it's playing for me right here.

1042
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:15.733
Really fun concert, and,
of course, WWDC from last year;

1043
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.366
these labs were a blast.

1044
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.800
So, that's months.

1044
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.800
So, that's months.

1045
00:53:18.866 --> 00:53:21.133
It makes it really easy to
browse the greatest hits

1046
00:53:21.199 --> 00:53:23.233
of your library
in one view.

1047
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.766
So, let's head
over to years.

1048
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.800
So, years gives me a high-level overview of my library.

1049
00:53:28.966 --> 00:53:31.166
What makes years really
special is that it's

1049
00:53:28.966 --> 00:53:31.166
What makes years really
special is that it's

1050
00:53:31.233 --> 00:53:33.666
dynamic based
on my context.

1051
00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:36.866
So today is WWDC and
photos knows I go to WWDC

1052
00:53:36.933 --> 00:53:39.866
every year, so now it's
showing me all of my WWDCs

1053
00:53:39.933 --> 00:53:42.900
from the past.

1054
00:53:42.966 --> 00:53:43.733
Go try it out.

1055
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.733
It's awesome.

1055
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.733
It's awesome.

1056
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.133
(Applause)

1057
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.199
I can go all the way back
- I can go all of the way

1058
00:53:51.266 --> 00:53:53.733
back to my first
WWDC in 2011.

1059
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.500
I was so excited to
be at that keynote.

1060
00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.233
Now, years can
do so much more.

1060
00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.233
Now, years can
do so much more.

1061
00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.300
What if today was my
daughter's birthday?

1062
00:54:00.366 --> 00:54:01.633
Let me show you what
that would look like.

1063
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.566
So, years is totally
transformed now and it's

1064
00:54:06.633 --> 00:54:08.300
all about my daughter.

1065
00:54:08.366 --> 00:54:11.900
As a proud dad, this
brings me so much joy.

1065
00:54:08.366 --> 00:54:11.900
As a proud dad, this
brings me so much joy.

1066
00:54:11.966 --> 00:54:14.900
She's grown up so fast.

1067
00:54:14.966 --> 00:54:20.599
Her first bike, these fun
times when every meal was

1068
00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:26.500
a mess, and this
is her first smile.

1068
00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:26.500
a mess, and this
is her first smile.

1069
00:54:26.566 --> 00:54:28.366
And this video just brings
that moment right back to

1070
00:54:28.433 --> 00:54:29.966
life for me.

1071
00:54:30.933 --> 00:54:34.500
I can just tap and I can
relive that whole great day.

1072
00:54:35.633 --> 00:54:36.933
So that's the
new Photos app.

1072
00:54:35.633 --> 00:54:36.933
So that's the
new Photos app.

1073
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.233
We think you are really
going to love it.

1074
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.533
Back to you, Craig.

1075
00:54:39.733 --> 00:54:41.266
(Applause)

1076
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.766
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Justin.

1077
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:49.033
We are so excited to
have you try this out.

1077
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:49.033
We are so excited to
have you try this out.

1078
00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:51.966
When you experience it
with your own photos, it's

1079
00:54:52.033 --> 00:54:54.133
a very meaningful experience.

1080
00:54:54.199 --> 00:54:56.233
So, that's Camera and
Photos, and as you can

1081
00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.733
see, there is so much to
experience in iOS 13.

1082
00:55:00.933 --> 00:55:04.066
And now, while much of our
interaction with iPhone is

1082
00:55:00.933 --> 00:55:04.066
And now, while much of our
interaction with iPhone is

1083
00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:06.666
through touch, we
also experience iOS in so

1084
00:55:06.733 --> 00:55:08.800
many other ways.

1085
00:55:08.866 --> 00:55:12.300
We use iOS when we are on
the go with our AirPods,

1086
00:55:12.366 --> 00:55:14.533
when we gather around to
listen to our favorite

1087
00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:18.000
music on HomePod.

1087
00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:18.000
music on HomePod.

1088
00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:20.033
And when we are on the
road with CarPlay.

1089
00:55:20.599 --> 00:55:22.766
And, of course, tying
together all of these

1090
00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:25.733
experiences is Siri.

1091
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.533
So, to take you through
what's new with AirPods,

1091
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.533
So, to take you through
what's new with AirPods,

1092
00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:31.533
HomePod, CarPlay, and
Siri, I would like to

1093
00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.633
invite to the stage Stacey
Lysik, our Senior Director

1094
00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:37.599
of OS Program Management
to the program and to the stage.

1095
00:55:37.666 --> 00:55:38.800
Stacey.

1096
00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:41.233
(Applause)

1096
00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:41.233
(Applause)

1097
00:55:46.366 --> 00:55:47.666
>> STACEY LYSIK:
Thanks, Craig.

1098
00:55:47.733 --> 00:55:49.966
Let's get started with
AirPods where we have a

1099
00:55:50.033 --> 00:55:53.300
couple of great new
features coming to iOS 13.

1100
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.533
First, when you are
wearing AirPods, Siri will

1101
00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:58.833
now be able to read your
incoming messages to you

1102
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.666
as soon as they arrive and
you can instantly respond.

1103
00:56:02.733 --> 00:56:05.366
Let's take a quick peek
and see how it works.

1104
00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.066
>> SIRI: Amy said, "Can
you meet for coffee at 9:00 am?"

1105
00:56:13.133 --> 00:56:14.133
>> MALE SPEAKER: Tell
her I'll be there.

1106
00:56:15.366 --> 00:56:16.266
>> SIRI: It's sent.

1107
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.566
(Applause)

1108
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.133
>> STACEY LYSIK: Just like
that, Siri helps you stay

1109
00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:27.199
in the moment, whether
the incoming notification

1110
00:56:27.266 --> 00:56:29.933
comes from the Messages
app or any third-party

1111
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.466
messaging app
using SiriKit.

1112
00:56:32.766 --> 00:56:35.533
(Applause)

1112
00:56:32.766 --> 00:56:35.533
(Applause)

1113
00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:42.133
Another great new feature
is audio sharing.

1114
00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:45.433
We have all had a time
where we wanted to share a

1115
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.800
movie or a song
with a friend.

1115
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.800
movie or a song
with a friend.

1116
00:56:47.866 --> 00:56:50.099
Now, you can,
with just a tap.

1117
00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:53.033
(Applause)

1118
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.800
Like everything AirPods,
the experience is magical.

1118
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.800
Like everything AirPods,
the experience is magical.

1119
00:57:02.866 --> 00:57:05.466
And when you get home,
there is no better way to

1120
00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.233
keep the music going than
with HomePod and its

1121
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.033
incredible sound quality.

1122
00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:13.633
To make that transition
seamless, we are bringing

1122
00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:13.633
To make that transition
seamless, we are bringing

1123
00:57:13.699 --> 00:57:15.800
Handoff to HomePod.

1124
00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.666
(Applause)

1125
00:57:21.433 --> 00:57:23.133
Now, when you walk through
the door, just bring your

1126
00:57:23.199 --> 00:57:25.533
iPhone close to your
HomePod to instantly hand

1126
00:57:23.199 --> 00:57:25.533
iPhone close to your
HomePod to instantly hand

1127
00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:29.099
off your music, a Podcast
or even a phone call.

1128
00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:31.066
And you can just take it
with you when you leave

1129
00:57:31.133 --> 00:57:32.633
the exact same way.

1130
00:57:33.666 --> 00:57:36.400
(Applause)

1131
00:57:39.033 --> 00:57:41.433
Today, we are
introducing Live Radio.

1132
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.066
So, you can ask Siri
to play stations from

1133
00:57:44.133 --> 00:57:47.800
iHeartRadio, Tune
In, and Radio.com.

1134
00:57:47.866 --> 00:57:52.566
In fact, we have over
100,000 radio stations

1134
00:57:47.866 --> 00:57:52.566
In fact, we have over
100,000 radio stations

1135
00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:54.800
from all around the world.

1136
00:57:55.033 --> 00:57:56.400
(Applause)

1137
00:58:01.766 --> 00:58:05.900
Now, HomePod can learn
to recognize who in your

1137
00:58:01.766 --> 00:58:05.900
Now, HomePod can learn
to recognize who in your

1138
00:58:05.966 --> 00:58:09.500
family is talking and
personalize the response.

1139
00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:12.900
(Applause)

1140
00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:17.266
Of course, this is great
with Apple Music so now

1140
00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:17.266
Of course, this is great
with Apple Music so now

1141
00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:19.099
when you ask Siri to play
you some music, it is

1142
00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:21.433
based on your taste and
your play history and not

1143
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.866
anyone else's, and the
personalization extends

1144
00:58:24.933 --> 00:58:28.300
way beyond music to
Messages, Reminders, Notes

1145
00:58:28.366 --> 00:58:29.966
and more.

1146
00:58:30.033 --> 00:58:32.033
So that's HomePod.

1147
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.466
Next, let's shift
gears to CarPlay.

1148
00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:38.599
CarPlay leads the
industry in adoption with

1149
00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:42.199
availability more than 90%
of cars sold here in the

1150
00:58:42.266 --> 00:58:45.833
US and 75% of cars
sold globally.

1150
00:58:42.266 --> 00:58:45.833
US and 75% of cars
sold globally.

1151
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.433
This year, we have our
biggest update to CarPlay

1152
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.033
since the beginning.

1153
00:58:51.099 --> 00:58:54.333
It all starts with the
CarPlay dashboard where

1154
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.933
you can now have your
music next to your maps

1154
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.933
you can now have your
music next to your maps

1155
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.666
and you still have
room for Siri smart

1156
00:58:58.733 --> 00:59:01.933
suggestions, like a garage
door opener when you get

1157
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.466
close to home or a view of
your next calendar event.

1158
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.433
You can see your whole day
in the new Calendar app.

1158
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.433
You can see your whole day
in the new Calendar app.

1159
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.366
Music has been redesigned
so your album art is front

1160
00:59:12.433 --> 00:59:14.566
and center and beautiful.

1161
00:59:14.633 --> 00:59:17.266
Siri stays out of the way
so you don't lose sight of

1162
00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.033
what's on the display.

1163
00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:22.000
Siri has always been great
for getting directions or

1164
00:59:22.066 --> 00:59:24.833
asking for some music and
it now works with third

1165
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:28.433
party apps like
Pandora and Waze.

1166
00:59:28.699 --> 00:59:33.066
(Applause)

1167
00:59:35.233 --> 00:59:39.099
As you saw, Siri is with
you across so much of what

1168
00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:42.333
we do on iOS, and last
year Siri became even more

1169
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.300
powerful with the
introduction of Siri Shortcuts.

1170
00:59:46.633 --> 00:59:49.566
Shortcuts enable you to
use your apps through Siri

1170
00:59:46.633 --> 00:59:49.566
Shortcuts enable you to
use your apps through Siri

1171
00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:52.833
and in the Shortcuts app,
you can create your own

1172
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.699
personalized
multi-step Shortcut.

1173
00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:59.400
Now, on iOS 13, the app is
built right in and it is

1174
00:59:59.466 --> 01:00:01.500
more powerful than ever.

1174
00:59:59.466 --> 01:00:01.500
more powerful than ever.

1175
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:04.033
It is now the one place
you access all of your

1176
01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:06.933
Shortcuts, including ones
you have added to Siri,

1177
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.866
and we make it easier to
get started with your

1178
01:00:08.933 --> 01:00:12.266
first multistep shortcut
using a new feature called

1179
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.333
suggested automations
which take your habits and

1179
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.333
suggested automations
which take your habits and

1180
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.466
personalize it to a
template like heading home

1181
01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.233
or going to the gym.

1182
01:00:22.566 --> 01:00:27.533
Integral across all of these experiences is how Siri sounds.

1182
01:00:22.566 --> 01:00:27.533
Integral across all of these experiences is how Siri sounds.

1183
01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:30.366
When we first started with
Siri's voice, we used

1184
01:00:30.433 --> 01:00:33.733
short clips of audio from
actor recordings, but

1185
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.866
sometimes when we put them
together, it didn't always

1186
01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.433
sound as natural as
we wanted it to be.

1187
01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.533
So, this year we have
taken a huge step forward

1188
01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:46.066
using cutting edge Machine
Learning called Neural

1189
01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:49.533
Text to Speech where for
the first time ever, the

1190
01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:53.133
voice you hear is entirely
generated by software.

1190
01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:53.133
voice you hear is entirely
generated by software.

1191
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.666
As a result, it's more
- it has more natural

1192
01:00:56.733 --> 01:00:58.900
cadence and
better emphasis.

1193
01:00:58.966 --> 01:01:01.133
It's most noticeable when
Siri is speaking longer or

1194
01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.933
more complex sentences.

1195
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.900
Let's have a listen
together starting with iOS 12.

1195
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.900
Let's have a listen
together starting with iOS 12.

1196
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.666
>> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the

1197
01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.400
thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which

1198
01:01:13.466 --> 01:01:15.599
the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas

1199
01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:18.366
reach their minimum
value taken as zero.

1200
01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:20.166
>> STACEY LYSIK: All right.

1201
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:21.766
So, that's okay.

1202
01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:26.366
But now let's try iOS
13 with Neural Text to Speech.

1203
01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:30.766
>> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the

1204
01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:33.166
thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which

1204
01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:33.166
thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which

1205
01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:35.666
the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas

1206
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:38.633
reach their minimum
value taken as zero.

1207
01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:40.766
>> STACEY LYSIK:
Way better.

1208
01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:42.633
Way better.

1209
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.233
(Applause)

1210
01:01:47.966 --> 01:01:51.333
So, that's Siri along with AirPods, HomePod and CarPlay.

1211
01:01:51.633 --> 01:01:52.133
Thank you.

1212
01:01:52.199 --> 01:01:53.166
Back to you, Craig.

1213
01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:00.866
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Stacey.

1213
01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:00.866
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Stacey.

1214
01:02:00.933 --> 01:02:05.833
So, that's our next big
release of iOS, iOS 13,

1215
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.266
and there is so much we
didn't have time to talk

1216
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:12.066
about, like the ability
to deal with call spam by

1216
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:12.066
about, like the ability
to deal with call spam by

1217
01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:15.033
sending unknown callers
directly to voice mail.

1218
01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.000
Yes.

1219
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.199
(Applause)

1220
01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:20.000
Or low data mode or for
our enterprise customers,

1221
01:02:20.066 --> 01:02:22.666
the ability to single sign
on to enterprise accounts

1222
01:02:22.733 --> 01:02:25.366
and have separate iCloud
accounts for your personal

1222
01:02:22.733 --> 01:02:25.366
and have separate iCloud
accounts for your personal

1223
01:02:25.433 --> 01:02:26.933
and work lives.

1224
01:02:27.133 --> 01:02:28.666
(Applause)

1225
01:02:32.733 --> 01:02:34.500
So, you may notice there
has been one thing missing

1226
01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:38.400
from the iOS 13 story
and that's iPad.

1226
01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:38.400
from the iOS 13 story
and that's iPad.

1227
01:02:38.466 --> 01:02:39.666
Yes.

1228
01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:41.433
(Applause)

1229
01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:44.366
Now, from the beginning,
iPad has been built on the

1230
01:02:44.433 --> 01:02:47.566
technical foundations of
iOS, so, of course, it

1231
01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:50.366
gets all of these great
new features that we are

1231
01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:50.366
gets all of these great
new features that we are

1232
01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.800
bringing to iPhone.

1233
01:02:51.966 --> 01:02:54.900
But over the years, iPad
has also evolved into

1234
01:02:54.966 --> 01:02:56.833
something unique.

1235
01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.266
You know, with its giant
canvas and powerful

1236
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:02.633
features like slide over
and split view, drag and

1237
01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:06.033
drop and Apple Pencil,
iPad delivers an

1237
01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:06.033
drop and Apple Pencil,
iPad delivers an

1238
01:03:06.099 --> 01:03:08.099
experience that
is truly distinct.

1239
01:03:08.966 --> 01:03:12.199
We have some big changes
coming to iPad this year

1240
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:15.966
and the time has come to
recognize the platform in

1241
01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:17.599
a special way.

1242
01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.133
Let's take a look.

1243
01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:27.099
(Music)

1244
01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:50.800
(Applause)

1245
01:03:52.133 --> 01:03:55.566
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
That's right.

1245
01:03:52.133 --> 01:03:55.566
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
That's right.

1246
01:03:55.633 --> 01:03:58.599
We are calling it iPad OS
and I would like to give

1247
01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.266
you a first look.

1248
01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:08.833
So, let's take a
look at iPad OS.

1248
01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:08.833
So, let's take a
look at iPad OS.

1249
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.366
Swipe home and the first
thing you notice is this

1250
01:04:11.433 --> 01:04:13.466
tighter grid of icons,
letting you have more

1251
01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:16.633
tools at your disposal
right on your Home screen.

1252
01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:19.766
But what I think is super
cool is watch what happens

1253
01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.699
when I swipe over.

1253
01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.699
when I swipe over.

1254
01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:25.533
I can now pin my Widgets
right on my Home screen.

1255
01:04:25.966 --> 01:04:27.366
(Applause)

1256
01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:30.199
It's gorgeous.

1257
01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.933
You get a lot of
information at a glance.

1258
01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.566
Let's turn to
multitasking.

1259
01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.766
Let's start
with slide over.

1259
01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.766
Let's start
with slide over.

1260
01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:38.400
Launch into Safari and
let's just slide over from

1261
01:04:38.466 --> 01:04:40.266
the right-hand
side of the screen.

1262
01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.133
You can see I have
messages there right now.

1263
01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:44.500
Now, I can, of course,
change the app I have

1264
01:04:44.566 --> 01:04:45.566
in slide over.

1265
01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:49.233
I can just pick up
Reminders and drag it on over.

1265
01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:49.233
I can just pick up
Reminders and drag it on over.

1266
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.166
Now, I have Reminders in
slide over so next time I

1267
01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:54.933
slide out, of course,
there is Reminders.

1268
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.099
But what if I want to get
back to the last app?

1269
01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:59.066
Could we make
that super easy?

1270
01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.300
The answer is yes.

1270
01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.300
The answer is yes.

1271
01:05:00.466 --> 01:05:02.699
I can just drag from the
bottom and they fan out

1272
01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:04.000
just like that.

1273
01:05:04.366 --> 01:05:05.333
(Applause)

1274
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.566
With just a tap,
I can switch apps.

1275
01:05:08.633 --> 01:05:11.233
I can even just slide
along the bottom to move

1276
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.166
quickly between my
apps in slide over.

1276
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.166
quickly between my
apps in slide over.

1277
01:05:14.233 --> 01:05:15.366
It's really great.

1278
01:05:17.266 --> 01:05:20.400
Now, next, I would like
to talk about Split View

1279
01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:23.300
because now we are
bringing multiwindow

1280
01:05:23.366 --> 01:05:26.366
capabilities to
apps on iPad.

1280
01:05:23.366 --> 01:05:26.366
capabilities to
apps on iPad.

1281
01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:29.133
For instance, I have a
single note right here in

1282
01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:31.033
Notes, but what with I
want to have two notes

1283
01:05:31.099 --> 01:05:32.800
side by side?

1284
01:05:32.866 --> 01:05:34.300
Well, now I can.

1285
01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:39.833
I can tap, drag, and now
I have a split with two notes.

1285
01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:39.833
I can tap, drag, and now
I have a split with two notes.

1286
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.300
(Applause)

1287
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.500
Now, I can use this across
spaces as well, so here I

1288
01:05:48.566 --> 01:05:50.266
have two notes, but here
I have a Pages document.

1289
01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:51.800
What if I have some notes
I want to use while

1290
01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.533
working on my
Pages document?

1290
01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.533
working on my
Pages document?

1291
01:05:53.599 --> 01:05:56.266
Well, I am just going to
slide on over, pick up

1292
01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:59.566
another note, and I can
just move back to my Pages

1293
01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:02.933
space and drop
it over there.

1294
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.800
Now, I have Pages
right next to Notes.

1294
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.800
Now, I have Pages
right next to Notes.

1295
01:06:06.033 --> 01:06:08.766
Now that I have notes in
all of these different spaces,

1296
01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.800
well, you can guess
how I can find them, right?

1297
01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.966
I just bring up the dock,
tap on Notes, and we have

1298
01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:17.066
app exposé now on iPad.

1299
01:06:17.133 --> 01:06:22.099
Here are all of my Notes
spaces in one place.

1299
01:06:17.133 --> 01:06:22.099
Here are all of my Notes
spaces in one place.

1300
01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.266
Now, this just doesn't
work for system apps.

1301
01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:27.866
It also works for third
party apps as well.

1302
01:06:27.933 --> 01:06:31.000
So, in addition to Notes
here and Pages, I can have

1303
01:06:31.066 --> 01:06:34.533
two Microsoft Word
documents side by side.

1304
01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.433
I mean, that's
enterprising right there.

1305
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.866
(Laughter)

1306
01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.733
And it works great for
some of the work flows in

1307
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.066
apps like Mail.

1308
01:06:42.133 --> 01:06:44.066
So, for instance, let's
say I want to reply to

1308
01:06:42.133 --> 01:06:44.066
So, for instance, let's
say I want to reply to

1309
01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:47.533
this message from Phil.

1310
01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:50.099
Well, I can just of course
start typing to Phil and

1311
01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:52.900
then I realize, you know,
I would actually like to draw

1312
01:06:52.966 --> 01:06:55.900
on some of my other contents
of my inbox for this reply.

1313
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.800
I can drag that compose
window off to the side

1313
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.800
I can drag that compose
window off to the side

1314
01:06:58.866 --> 01:07:03.233
into Split View, even
create a split so I can

1315
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.033
see all of my messages.

1316
01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:07.333
I can tap through
these other messages.

1317
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.633
If I find an image I want
to put to my message to

1318
01:07:09.699 --> 01:07:13.566
Phil, just tap, drag it
out just like that, and

1318
01:07:09.699 --> 01:07:13.566
Phil, just tap, drag it
out just like that, and

1319
01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:15.300
check this out; if there
is a link I want to

1320
01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:17.099
preview, just
tap and hold.

1321
01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.533
I get a preview
of that web page.

1322
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.300
That looks
perfect for Phil.

1323
01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:23.033
Just drop it right in
here just like that.

1323
01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:23.033
Just drop it right in
here just like that.

1324
01:07:23.099 --> 01:07:26.500
Better composing through
multitasking on iPad.

1325
01:07:26.566 --> 01:07:29.566
And that's a quick look at
the new Home screen and

1326
01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:32.166
new Multitasking in iPad OS.

1327
01:07:32.766 --> 01:07:34.000
(Applause)

1328
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.900
But there is a lot more.

1329
01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:42.199
Let's start with Files.

1330
01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.099
Now, browsing in Files,
of course, you have

1331
01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:48.000
icon view, list view.

1332
01:07:48.066 --> 01:07:50.966
Well, how about
column view?

1332
01:07:48.066 --> 01:07:50.966
Well, how about
column view?

1333
01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.733
Great for digging through
deep file hierarchies.

1334
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.900
You get a great file
preview right here and

1335
01:07:57.966 --> 01:08:01.300
quick actions for things
like rotating documents -

1336
01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:05.599
images, making PDFs, and
great rich metadata right

1336
01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:05.599
images, making PDFs, and
great rich metadata right

1337
01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.633
at the bottom.

1338
01:08:06.933 --> 01:08:09.566
Now, we are also improving the way that you can share files.

1339
01:08:09.633 --> 01:08:13.533
For instance, in iCloud Drive, we now support folder sharing.

1340
01:08:14.199 --> 01:08:16.066
(Applause)

1340
01:08:14.199 --> 01:08:16.066
(Applause)

1341
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.033
And get this; we also have
built in support for SMB

1342
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.233
file sharing so you can
share from your work PC,

1343
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.666
home PC, right
in the files.

1343
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.666
home PC, right
in the files.

1344
01:08:31.198 --> 01:08:34.233
Now, there is one more.

1345
01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.698
That's right, you can now
plug in a thumb drive.

1346
01:08:36.966 --> 01:08:38.500
(Applause)

1347
01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:46.198
So, thumb drives, external
disk drives and SD cards,

1348
01:08:46.265 --> 01:08:49.399
all show up right in the
Files app, but now this

1349
01:08:49.466 --> 01:08:50.832
one is really great too.

1350
01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:52.966
Sometimes when you are
working with a camera, you

1351
01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.933
would like to import
directly into an app like

1351
01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.933
would like to import
directly into an app like

1352
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.433
Light Room and
now you can.

1353
01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:58.600
(Applause)

1354
01:09:01.966 --> 01:09:03.899
Of course, there
is much, much more.

1355
01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.166
It's a huge year for Files
this year, and it's also a

1355
01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.166
It's a huge year for Files
this year, and it's also a

1356
01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:09.765
huge year for Safari.

1357
01:09:10.366 --> 01:09:13.133
You know, Safari is just
the perfect device for

1358
01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:14.666
browsing the Internet.

1359
01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.666
It's like holding the web
in your hands and this

1360
01:09:16.733 --> 01:09:19.332
year we are making Safari
more capable than ever.

1361
01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:22.198
When you look at the Web
today, it's often split

1362
01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:24.166
into kind of two
big categories.

1363
01:09:24.233 --> 01:09:27.433
On the one hand, you have
the mobile Web designed

1364
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.265
for the small screen
and mobile devices, and

1365
01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.332
desktop sites that are
designed for large screens

1365
01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.332
desktop sites that are
designed for large screens

1366
01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.765
like on your Mac.

1367
01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:37.300
And often, websites will
serve up the wrong thing

1368
01:09:37.366 --> 01:09:39.066
for the iPad.

1369
01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:42.265
Well, no more because we
are bringing desktop class

1370
01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:45.698
browsing to
Safari on iPad.

1371
01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:47.698
(Applause)

1371
01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:47.698
(Applause)

1372
01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:53.033
Now, with this, Safari
does all of the heavy

1373
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.933
lifting, so instead of the
mobile site, you will see

1374
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.766
the desktop site but it
will be sized perfectly

1375
01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:59.466
for the iPad display
and have automatically

1375
01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:59.466
for the iPad display
and have automatically

1376
01:09:59.533 --> 01:10:02.000
optimized for touch input.

1377
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:07.166
Now, this also works great
for apps like Google Docs,

1378
01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:09.100
Square Space
and Word Press.

1379
01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:11.933
They all work great in
Safari now and the desktop

1380
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.633
class experience
doesn't stop there.

1381
01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:17.166
We are also bringing
a download manager to Safari.

1382
01:10:17.766 --> 01:10:19.266
(Applause)

1383
01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:25.633
Thirty new keyboard
shortcuts and much, much more.

1383
01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:25.633
Thirty new keyboard
shortcuts and much, much more.

1384
01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:29.166
Next, I want to
talk about fonts.

1385
01:10:29.233 --> 01:10:31.033
Now, we all know that
fonts bring out the

1386
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.100
personality of a project,
and this year we are

1387
01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:38.699
giving you a new way to
use custom fonts inside of

1387
01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:38.699
giving you a new way to
use custom fonts inside of

1388
01:10:38.766 --> 01:10:41.466
your favorite apps.

1389
01:10:42.366 --> 01:10:43.733
You will be able to
download them right from

1390
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.033
the App Store.

1391
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.500
We are working with all
of the major providers of fonts.

1392
01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.600
Next, we are taking a
big leap forward in text

1392
01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.600
Next, we are taking a
big leap forward in text

1393
01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:57.466
editing, making it even faster with the power of Multi Touch.

1394
01:10:57.533 --> 01:10:59.866
So, navigating long
documents, you can now

1395
01:10:59.933 --> 01:11:02.966
grab the scroll indicator
and jump anywhere in the

1396
01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:04.566
document instantly.

1396
01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:04.566
document instantly.

1397
01:11:04.733 --> 01:11:06.899
(Applause)

1398
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.300
Now, moving the cursor
is easier than ever.

1399
01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:14.866
Just pick it up, and drag
it where you want it to go.

1400
01:11:15.466 --> 01:11:18.699
And selecting text, just
put your finger down and

1400
01:11:15.466 --> 01:11:18.699
And selecting text, just
put your finger down and

1401
01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:21.633
drag out a selection.

1402
01:11:21.699 --> 01:11:24.000
There is no need to double
tap and no magnifying

1403
01:11:24.066 --> 01:11:26.300
glass getting in your way.

1404
01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:27.566
And yeah.

1405
01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:30.500
And when you have a
selection, check this out,

1405
01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:30.500
And when you have a
selection, check this out,

1406
01:11:30.566 --> 01:11:34.066
you want to copy or cut,
just a three-finger pinch

1407
01:11:34.133 --> 01:11:37.833
to copy, and a
three-finger spread to

1408
01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:39.800
plop it right down.

1409
01:11:39.866 --> 01:11:42.000
This works across
all sorts of apps.

1410
01:11:42.433 --> 01:11:43.600
(Applause)

1410
01:11:42.433 --> 01:11:43.600
(Applause)

1411
01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.933
And if you make a mistake,
don't worry, just a

1412
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.233
three-finger
swipe to undo.

1413
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.866
No more shaking that iPad.

1414
01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:54.733
(Applause)

1415
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.133
Finally, I would like to
talk about Apple Pencil.

1416
01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:02.933
Apple Pencil has quickly
become an indispensable

1417
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.066
tool for so
many iPad users.

1418
01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:07.699
It's just perfect for
marking up documents,

1419
01:12:07.766 --> 01:12:10.366
taking notes or
doing illustration.

1419
01:12:07.766 --> 01:12:10.366
taking notes or
doing illustration.

1420
01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:12.899
A critical part of
that experience is the

1421
01:12:12.966 --> 01:12:15.666
incredible low latency
of Apple Pencil.

1422
01:12:15.733 --> 01:12:17.533
You know, our goal
was to have it just be

1423
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.633
indistinguishable for
making marks on a physical

1424
01:12:19.699 --> 01:12:21.199
piece of paper.

1425
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.266
Now, Apple Pencil already
leads the industry with a

1425
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.266
Now, Apple Pencil already
leads the industry with a

1426
01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:27.699
record low twenty
millisecond latency, but

1427
01:12:27.766 --> 01:12:30.266
we have been optimizing
and advancing our

1428
01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.066
prediction algorithms and
today we are bringing that

1429
01:12:33.133 --> 01:12:37.199
latency down to
9 milliseconds.

1429
01:12:33.133 --> 01:12:37.199
latency down to
9 milliseconds.

1430
01:12:37.266 --> 01:12:38.233
It's incredible.

1431
01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.266
(Applause)

1432
01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.133
Now, of course, an
important part of your

1433
01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.966
experience using your
Pencil is a great tool

1434
01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:52.199
palette and a great set of
tools, and so now in iPad OS,

1435
01:12:52.266 --> 01:12:54.966
we have redesigned it
and we are providing a

1436
01:12:55.033 --> 01:12:58.766
PencilKit developer API so
third-party apps can have

1437
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.033
the same great experience.

1437
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.033
the same great experience.

1438
01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:05.033
We have also made it a lot
easier to markup anything

1439
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.333
on any app.

1440
01:13:06.399 --> 01:13:08.300
You can just drag your
pencil up from the corner

1441
01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:10.766
of the screen and just
like that you are you

1442
01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.000
are in markup.

1443
01:13:12.066 --> 01:13:14.500
You can markup a
screenshot or even an

1443
01:13:12.066 --> 01:13:14.500
You can markup a
screenshot or even an

1444
01:13:14.566 --> 01:13:16.433
entire document.

1445
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.266
This works just great
throughout the system.

1446
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:22.699
Now, to show you Pencil in
action, I would like to

1447
01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:25.433
invite up Toby Paterson,
our Senior Director in

1448
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.933
charge of the iPad system
experience, to give you a demo.

1448
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.933
charge of the iPad system
experience, to give you a demo.

1449
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.666
Toby.

1450
01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:33.133
(Applause)

1451
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.566
>> TOBY PATERSON:
Thanks, Craig.

1452
01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:37.500
Okay.

1453
01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:39.033
Well, let's jump into
Notes here and take a look

1454
01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.166
at the new text
editing gestures.

1454
01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.166
at the new text
editing gestures.

1455
01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:44.333
It begins with a tap to
place the cursor up there

1456
01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:46.866
at the top of the screen,
and then to move the

1457
01:13:46.933 --> 01:13:50.966
cursor, we will just grab
it with your finger, oops

1458
01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:53.133
- grab it with your
finger, put it exactly

1458
01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:53.133
- grab it with your
finger, put it exactly

1459
01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:54.500
where you want it.

1460
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.800
Now, for typing, there is
the standard keyboard, of

1461
01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:59.233
course, but watch what
happens when I pinch on it

1462
01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.033
with two fingers.

1463
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.399
It shrinks down to a new
compact layout and this is

1464
01:14:04.466 --> 01:14:06.866
really great for typing
with one finger or your

1464
01:14:04.466 --> 01:14:06.866
really great for typing
with one finger or your

1465
01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:09.100
thumb while you're
holding your iPad.

1466
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.000
(Applause)

1467
01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:10.800
I know.

1468
01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:11.566
I do this a lot.

1469
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.866
And you can use
quick path here.

1470
01:14:13.933 --> 01:14:16.800
Oops.

1471
01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:18.466
Just like that.

1472
01:14:18.533 --> 01:14:20.133
Now, to select text, just
hold your finger on a

1472
01:14:18.533 --> 01:14:20.133
Now, to select text, just
hold your finger on a

1473
01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:26.766
word, sorry.

1474
01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:28.100
Hold your finger on a word
and just drag it out like

1475
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:31.899
that and our new gestures
make text editing a breeze.

1476
01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.399
It's a three-finger pinch,
once to copy or twice in a

1477
01:14:35.466 --> 01:14:38.666
row to cut, and then a
three finger drop gesture

1478
01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:40.800
to paste it into
place like that.

1479
01:14:41.533 --> 01:14:41.966
Now to -

1480
01:14:42.199 --> 01:14:43.466
(Applause)

1481
01:14:43.633 --> 01:14:44.699
It's really easy.

1482
01:14:44.766 --> 01:14:48.100
Now, to undo your
gestures, or to undo your

1482
01:14:44.766 --> 01:14:48.100
Now, to undo your
gestures, or to undo your

1483
01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.666
changes, I want to
reassure you, you can

1484
01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:52.133
still shake your iPad if
you want, but I do find

1485
01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:55.533
the three-finger swipe
to the left a little bit easier.

1486
01:14:55.933 --> 01:14:57.366
I also want to note that
these gestures are not

1487
01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:59.399
limited to text
editing only.

1487
01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:59.399
limited to text
editing only.

1488
01:14:59.466 --> 01:15:01.933
They will work in any
application that supports

1489
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.366
copy/paste, undo and redo.

1490
01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:05.766
Okay.

1491
01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:08.333
Let's switch now and
talk about the pencil.

1492
01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:10.733
So, you can see here at
the tool palette with its

1493
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.399
beautiful new design, the
new tools, and now you can

1493
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.399
beautiful new design, the
new tools, and now you can

1494
01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:15.899
drag it around the
screen like this.

1495
01:15:15.966 --> 01:15:18.666
You can pin it to any
edge of the screen, you

1496
01:15:18.733 --> 01:15:21.366
minimize it down in the
bottom like that, and then

1497
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:24.399
with a tap or a drag,
open it back up again.

1497
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:24.399
with a tap or a drag,
open it back up again.

1498
01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:27.800
Now, of course, Notes has
been tailor made to work

1499
01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:29.633
really well with the
Pencil, but you can

1500
01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:32.366
actually use this to
markup any application on

1501
01:15:32.433 --> 01:15:34.033
the - on your iPad.

1502
01:15:34.466 --> 01:15:36.199
Let's switch over to
Safari here and I will

1503
01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.966
show you how this works.

1503
01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.966
show you how this works.

1504
01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.833
So, Craig has put me
in charge of the next

1505
01:15:39.899 --> 01:15:42.666
software offsite and I
want to share an idea with him.

1506
01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.133
So, check this out.

1507
01:15:44.466 --> 01:15:46.500
Watch as I drag from the
corner of the iPad with my

1508
01:15:46.566 --> 01:15:48.866
Pencil like this.

1509
01:15:48.933 --> 01:15:51.300
It takes you right into
markup where you can see a

1509
01:15:48.933 --> 01:15:51.300
It takes you right into
markup where you can see a

1510
01:15:51.366 --> 01:15:54.566
screenshot of exactly
what you were looking at.

1511
01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.833
But many apps can now
support a new full-page

1512
01:15:56.899 --> 01:16:00.066
capture mode which you select with this button at the top.

1513
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.866
Here you can see the
entire document that you

1514
01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:04.500
were looking at.

1514
01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:04.500
were looking at.

1515
01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:06.600
You can scroll through it
or use the side bar on the

1516
01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.800
right to quickly navigate
and as you would expect,

1517
01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:14.533
you can mark it up with
your pencil just like this.

1518
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.399
I will bet we've got a few
Rush fans in the crowd

1518
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.399
I will bet we've got a few
Rush fans in the crowd

1519
01:16:17.466 --> 01:16:17.699
here today, I think.

1520
01:16:17.766 --> 01:16:18.500
(Applause)

1521
01:16:18.566 --> 01:16:19.866
Yes.

1522
01:16:19.933 --> 01:16:22.466
I think Craig would make
a great Alex Lifeson.

1523
01:16:22.933 --> 01:16:24.866
Now, when you're done,
just bring up the share

1524
01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:27.533
sheet and you can send it
off right from here and

1525
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.533
that's how you can easily
markup anything on your iPad.

1525
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.533
that's how you can easily
markup anything on your iPad.

1526
01:16:30.966 --> 01:16:32.133
Back to you now, Craig.

1527
01:16:32.199 --> 01:16:33.199
Thank you.

1528
01:16:33.633 --> 01:16:35.133
(Applause)

1529
01:16:37.733 --> 01:16:38.833
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Toby.

1530
01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:40.699
Those are some great
improvements to Apple

1531
01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:44.166
Pencil and so much
more for iPad OS.

1531
01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:44.166
Pencil and so much
more for iPad OS.

1532
01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.600
There are a ton of great
new features that take

1533
01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:49.399
iPad OS to the next level.

1534
01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:52.033
Well, that's what
I have for you now.

1535
01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.199
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

1536
01:16:53.266 --> 01:16:54.133
Thank you so much.

1537
01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:57.000
(Applause)

1537
01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:57.000
(Applause)

1538
01:16:59.399 --> 01:17:02.333
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig.

1539
01:17:02.399 --> 01:17:05.333
These are just blow
away huge releases.

1540
01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:08.800
iPad OS built on the
foundation of iOS takes

1540
01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:08.800
iPad OS built on the
foundation of iOS takes

1541
01:17:08.866 --> 01:17:12.733
the distinctive experience
of iPad even further.

1542
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.000
In a powerful new version
of iOS, iOS 13, we can't

1543
01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.166
wait for all of you to
get your hands on these

1544
01:17:20.233 --> 01:17:23.266
great new releases.

1544
01:17:20.233 --> 01:17:23.266
great new releases.

1545
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:26.633
Now, let's turn
to the Mac.

1546
01:17:26.966 --> 01:17:29.199
(Applause)

1547
01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.899
We love the Mac and
our customers do too.

1547
01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.899
We love the Mac and
our customers do too.

1548
01:17:34.966 --> 01:17:37.966
In fact, the Mac is the
number one in customer

1549
01:17:38.033 --> 01:17:40.500
satisfaction by far
in the industry.

1550
01:17:41.399 --> 01:17:44.066
People use their Macs to
create amazing things,

1551
01:17:44.133 --> 01:17:46.966
simply and powerfully.

1552
01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:50.300
We have the strongest Mac
lineup we have ever had,

1553
01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:52.533
from the new MacBook Air
all the way up to the

1554
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.066
power house iMac Pro.

1555
01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:59.033
And for Mac users looking
to really push the limits

1556
01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.300
of performance, there
is one more spot in our

1556
01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.300
of performance, there
is one more spot in our

1557
01:18:03.366 --> 01:18:07.166
lineup that the team has been working really hard to fill.

1558
01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:08.366
(Applause)

1559
01:18:09.366 --> 01:18:12.266
Yes.

1560
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:16.000
To create a product that
will take Mac further than

1560
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:16.000
To create a product that
will take Mac further than

1561
01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:19.800
it's ever gone before
and I am so excited and

1562
01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:22.733
thrilled to show
it to you now.

1563
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.266
(Applause)

1564
01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:36.133
(Music)

1565
01:19:09.433 --> 01:19:11.899
(Applause)

1566
01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:35.566
>> TIM COOK: This is the new MacPro and it's incredible.

1567
01:19:35.766 --> 01:19:37.699
(Applause)

1568
01:19:39.366 --> 01:19:43.533
It has a truly gorgeous
design and remarkable

1569
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.300
performance to match.

1569
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.300
performance to match.

1570
01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:50.333
It is the most powerful
Mac we have ever created.

1571
01:19:50.399 --> 01:19:52.933
And to tell you all about
it, I would like to invite

1572
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.733
John Ternus to the stage.

1573
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.233
John.

1574
01:19:56.433 --> 01:19:58.133
(Applause)

1574
01:19:56.433 --> 01:19:58.133
(Applause)

1575
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.866
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, Tim.

1576
01:20:02.933 --> 01:20:07.266
I am so excited to be able to tell you about this new MacPro.

1577
01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:08.899
Now, in designing this
product, we wanted to

1578
01:20:08.966 --> 01:20:11.266
build an architecture that
could meet the incredible

1578
01:20:08.966 --> 01:20:11.266
build an architecture that
could meet the incredible

1579
01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:14.033
diversity of pro needs,
a system that offers

1580
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.699
virtually unlimited
possibilities for customization.

1581
01:20:17.766 --> 01:20:20.033
And key to this is a
simple and elegant

1582
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.633
solution for accessing
the internal components.

1583
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.933
Now, inside you will find
a stainless steel frame

1584
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.833
that forms a strong
internal structure for the

1585
01:20:27.899 --> 01:20:30.833
entire system and it
provides a foundation for

1586
01:20:30.899 --> 01:20:33.733
modularity and
flexibility.

1587
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.399
The frame also
incorporates stainless

1588
01:20:35.466 --> 01:20:36.466
steel handles.

1588
01:20:35.466 --> 01:20:36.466
steel handles.

1589
01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:38.199
They feel great in your
hand and they make it easy

1590
01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.500
to move the system around.

1591
01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:42.466
All of the internal
modules mount to this

1592
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:46.033
frame which means users
have 360-degree access to

1593
01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.199
easily configure
components and every sub

1593
01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.199
easily configure
components and every sub

1594
01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.833
system has been optimized
for performance.

1595
01:20:52.733 --> 01:20:55.233
So, let's start
with the processor.

1596
01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.333
Now, we have designed
this new MacPro for our

1597
01:20:57.399 --> 01:20:59.233
customers who need
the ultimate in CPU

1598
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.133
performance for tasks like
production rendering or

1598
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.133
performance for tasks like
production rendering or

1599
01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:04.266
playing back hundreds of
virtual instruments or

1600
01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:07.500
simulating an iOS app on
multiple devices at once.

1601
01:21:07.566 --> 01:21:10.466
So, we are using a
brand-new Intel Xeon

1602
01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:14.366
Processor and it has up
to twenty-eight cores.

1603
01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.533
(Applause)

1603
01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.533
(Applause)

1604
01:21:21.233 --> 01:21:23.266
And to get every last
ounce of performance out

1605
01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:26.566
of this processor, we are
giving it over 300 watts

1606
01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.899
of power and a massive heat
sink for cooling so this means

1606
01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.899
of power and a massive heat
sink for cooling so this means

1607
01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:33.033
it can run fully
unconstrained all of the time.

1608
01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300
Now, we also have an
extremely high-performance

1609
01:21:36.366 --> 01:21:37.433
memory architecture.

1610
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.899
Six channels of super fast
ECC memory in 12 DIMM

1611
01:21:40.966 --> 01:21:45.600
slots enable an incredible
1.5 terabytes of system memory.

1611
01:21:40.966 --> 01:21:45.600
slots enable an incredible
1.5 terabytes of system memory.

1612
01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.366
(Applause)

1613
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.433
Now, let's talk
about expansion.

1613
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.433
Now, let's talk
about expansion.

1614
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.033
Many of our pro customers
need to add things like

1615
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.933
fiber channel or audio
DPSs or SDI video to their

1616
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.600
systems, so we are
bringing PCI expansion

1617
01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:04.800
back to the Mac
in a big way.

1618
01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.300
(Applause)

1619
01:22:08.566 --> 01:22:12.666
Because this new MacPro
has eight internal PCI slots.

1620
01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:19.266
There are four double wide
slots and three single

1621
01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:21.066
wide slots, and there is
one additional half-length

1621
01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:21.066
wide slots, and there is
one additional half-length

1622
01:22:21.133 --> 01:22:23.500
slot that we populate
with an I/O card.

1623
01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.566
Now, this I/O card has two
Thunderbolt 3 ports, two

1624
01:22:26.633 --> 01:22:29.600
USB-A ports and an audio
jack and there are also

1625
01:22:29.666 --> 01:22:32.333
two more Thunderbolt 3
ports conveniently located

1626
01:22:32.399 --> 01:22:33.699
on the top of the system.

1626
01:22:32.399 --> 01:22:33.699
on the top of the system.

1627
01:22:33.899 --> 01:22:37.233
And finally, the MacPro
has two built-in 10

1628
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.033
gigabit ethernet ports.

1629
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.666
So, one of the most
critical areas of

1630
01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:44.833
expansion is graphics.

1631
01:22:44.899 --> 01:22:47.566
Graphics performance is so
important for tasks like

1631
01:22:44.899 --> 01:22:47.566
Graphics performance is so
important for tasks like

1632
01:22:47.633 --> 01:22:51.600
animating 3D film assets
or compositing 8K scenes

1633
01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:54.733
or building complex 3D
environments, but we

1634
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.833
wanted to go beyond the
typical graphics card

1635
01:22:56.899 --> 01:22:59.766
design so we've invented
something completely new.

1635
01:22:56.899 --> 01:22:59.766
design so we've invented
something completely new.

1636
01:23:00.533 --> 01:23:03.000
Now, it starts with an
industry standard PCI

1637
01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:05.199
connector, so the slot
maintains compatibility

1638
01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:06.866
with standard cards.

1639
01:23:06.933 --> 01:23:09.433
We have added a second
connector that allows us

1640
01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.133
to integrate Thunderbolt
throughout the entire system

1640
01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.133
to integrate Thunderbolt
throughout the entire system

1641
01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:14.633
and provide a tremendous
amount of extra power.

1642
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:18.233
In fact, at 500 watts,
this module has the same

1643
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:22.066
power capacity as the entire previous generation MacPro.

1644
01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:25.199
And instead of adding its
own dedicated fan, we have

1644
01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:25.199
And instead of adding its
own dedicated fan, we have

1645
01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.766
a huge heat sink that's
quietly cooled by the

1646
01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:29.333
MacPro thermal system.

1647
01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:33.133
We call this the MacPro
expansion module or MPX

1648
01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:35.600
for short, and using this
architecture we are going

1649
01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:38.966
to offer multiple graphics
options, starting with the

1649
01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:38.966
to offer multiple graphics
options, starting with the

1650
01:23:39.033 --> 01:23:42.100
Radeon Pro 580X, a great
all-around graphics card.

1651
01:23:42.733 --> 01:23:45.300
For a big upgrade in
graphics performance, the

1652
01:23:45.366 --> 01:23:48.899
MacPro can be configured
with AMD's Radeon Pro Vega II.

1653
01:23:48.966 --> 01:23:52.266
Vega II delivers 14
teraflops of graphics

1653
01:23:48.966 --> 01:23:52.266
Vega II delivers 14
teraflops of graphics

1654
01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:55.166
compute and 32 gigabytes
of memory with an insane

1655
01:23:55.233 --> 01:23:58.233
1 terabyte per second
of memory bandwidth.

1656
01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.266
But we didn't stop there
because with the increased

1657
01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:02.966
head room of the MPX
module, we can actually

1658
01:24:03.033 --> 01:24:06.966
use two Vega II GPUs for
double the teraflops,

1658
01:24:03.033 --> 01:24:06.966
use two Vega II GPUs for
double the teraflops,

1659
01:24:07.033 --> 01:24:10.866
double the memory and
double the memory bandwidth.

1660
01:24:10.933 --> 01:24:13.233
This is quite simply
the world's most

1661
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.933
powerful graphics card.

1662
01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:25.600
Now, these two GPUs are
connected by the Infinity

1663
01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:27.233
Fabric Link which allows
data transfer between them

1664
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.033
at five times faster
than the PCI BUS.

1664
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.033
at five times faster
than the PCI BUS.

1665
01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.033
This is a really big
deal for apps that are

1666
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.533
optimized to take
advantage of multiple GPUs.

1667
01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.266
And if all of this wasn't
crazy enough, the MacPro

1668
01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:40.033
can be configured with
two of these modules.

1669
01:24:40.399 --> 01:24:42.166
(Applause)

1670
01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:46.100
Enabling up to 56
teraflops and 128

1670
01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:46.100
Enabling up to 56
teraflops and 128

1671
01:24:46.166 --> 01:24:48.000
gigabytes of high
bandwidth memory.

1672
01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:50.100
This is an unbelievable
amount of graphics compute

1673
01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:51.600
in a single workstation.

1674
01:24:52.766 --> 01:24:55.466
Now, we have also done
something really special

1675
01:24:55.533 --> 01:24:56.366
for video editing.

1675
01:24:55.533 --> 01:24:56.366
for video editing.

1676
01:24:56.433 --> 01:24:58.300
One of the challenges in
working with high quality

1677
01:24:58.366 --> 01:25:00.533
cameras is the need to
convert the native files

1678
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.966
into proxies for
easier editing.

1679
01:25:03.033 --> 01:25:05.966
This is a time consuming
and error prone process.

1680
01:25:06.466 --> 01:25:08.266
Being able to work
directly with the native

1681
01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:09.966
formats would be a game
changer in these high end

1681
01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:09.966
formats would be a game
changer in these high end

1682
01:25:10.033 --> 01:25:13.366
work flows so we have
built a brand-new card

1683
01:25:13.433 --> 01:25:15.833
that we call Afterburner
and it turns your MacPro

1684
01:25:15.899 --> 01:25:18.266
into a monster of a
video editing machine.

1685
01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:21.600
Afterburner is a hardware
accelerator card that is

1686
01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:23.933
built with an FPGA which
is a programmable ASIC and

1686
01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:23.933
built with an FPGA which
is a programmable ASIC and

1687
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.833
this ASIC is capable of
processing 6 billion

1688
01:25:27.899 --> 01:25:29.100
pixels per second.

1689
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.466
(Applause)

1690
01:25:35.133 --> 01:25:36.933
So, with this custom
solution, we have achieved

1691
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.833
an unprecedented level of
performance for the ProRes

1692
01:25:39.899 --> 01:25:42.366
and ProRes RAW codecs.

1693
01:25:42.433 --> 01:25:44.800
The most powerful
workstations in the world

1694
01:25:44.866 --> 01:25:47.133
today struggle to play
back just one stream of 8K

1695
01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:49.066
video, but with
Afterburner, the new

1695
01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:49.066
video, but with
Afterburner, the new

1696
01:25:49.133 --> 01:25:51.966
MacPro can play back an
incredible three streams

1697
01:25:52.033 --> 01:25:53.766
of 8K Pro Res RAW.

1698
01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.233
(Applause)

1699
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.633
Or 12 streams of 4K.

1699
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.633
Or 12 streams of 4K.

1700
01:26:02.233 --> 01:26:04.566
This is ground breaking
performance and it means

1701
01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:07.433
we can finally say goodbye
to proxy workflows.

1702
01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:10.366
Now, of course, all of
this compute requires a

1703
01:26:10.433 --> 01:26:12.666
massive amount of power,
and so we have given every

1704
01:26:12.733 --> 01:26:16.500
MacPro a 1.4 kilowatt
power supply.

1704
01:26:12.733 --> 01:26:16.500
MacPro a 1.4 kilowatt
power supply.

1705
01:26:18.866 --> 01:26:20.566
Of course, all of
that power requires a

1706
01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:22.699
tremendously capable
cooling system.

1707
01:26:22.766 --> 01:26:26.000
So, the MacPro has three
enormous fans and one

1708
01:26:26.066 --> 01:26:29.199
blower that together can
generate up to 300 cubic

1708
01:26:26.066 --> 01:26:29.199
blower that together can
generate up to 300 cubic

1709
01:26:29.266 --> 01:26:32.199
feet per minute of air
flow and it's very quiet.

1710
01:26:32.266 --> 01:26:34.133
In fact, when it's under
your desk in typical load

1711
01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:36.133
conditions, it's as
quiet as an iMac Pro.

1712
01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:39.500
To seal the thermal
system, the beautiful

1713
01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:43.100
aluminum housing slides over the frame and latches into place.

1713
01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:43.100
aluminum housing slides over the frame and latches into place.

1714
01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.566
And its unique
three-dimensional vents

1715
01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.333
are actually machined on
both the internal and

1716
01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:48.800
external surfaces.

1717
01:26:48.866 --> 01:26:51.233
The resulting lightweight
lattice pattern maximizes

1718
01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.399
air flow while creating an
extremely rigid structure.

1718
01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.399
air flow while creating an
extremely rigid structure.

1719
01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:58.233
And finally, optional
wheels make it easy to

1720
01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.399
move the MacPro
around your studio.

1721
01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.100
(Applause)

1722
01:27:08.233 --> 01:27:10.699
As you can see, utility
and function define the

1723
01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:13.399
design of the new MacPro,
and while the specs we

1724
01:27:13.466 --> 01:27:15.266
have been talking about
are impressive, we have

1725
01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:17.266
really been focused on
delivering real world

1726
01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:19.566
performance where
it matters most.

1726
01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:19.566
performance where
it matters most.

1727
01:27:19.633 --> 01:27:21.533
To do that, we have been
working closely with a

1728
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.366
number of pro
app developers.

1729
01:27:24.033 --> 01:27:26.433
This includes Adobe, Auto
Desk, Serif and Blackmagic

1730
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:30.199
who are all announcing support for the new MacPro today.

1731
01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:32.500
In fact, Blackmagic is
seeing some amazing

1731
01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:32.500
In fact, Blackmagic is
seeing some amazing

1732
01:27:32.566 --> 01:27:33.933
performance gains.

1733
01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.833
With the Afterburner card
doing the heavy lifting of

1734
01:27:35.899 --> 01:27:38.933
decoding video, they can
tap into the CPU and GPUs

1735
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.766
to add effects and
coloring in real time on

1736
01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:43.733
native 8K content.

1737
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.766
This is a work flow that
has never been possible

1737
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.766
This is a work flow that
has never been possible

1738
01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.033
before the new MacPro.

1739
01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:50.933
Side FX, Red, Epic
and Avid are also

1740
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.466
announcing support today.

1741
01:27:52.699 --> 01:27:54.899
(Applause)

1742
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.699
Avid is taking advantage
of the incredible

1743
01:27:57.766 --> 01:28:00.133
expansion capabilities of
the MacPro to do something

1743
01:27:57.766 --> 01:28:00.133
expansion capabilities of
the MacPro to do something

1744
01:28:00.199 --> 01:28:02.800
never before possible in
a single work station.

1745
01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:06.500
They are enabling support
for up to six HDX cards.

1746
01:28:06.566 --> 01:28:08.966
This yields more I/O,
increased voices and two

1747
01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:12.100
times the DSP processing than any other system can achieve.

1747
01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:12.100
times the DSP processing than any other system can achieve.

1748
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.100
3D app developers like
Unity, Pixar, Foundry and

1749
01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:19.566
Maxon are also
announcing support.

1750
01:28:19.633 --> 01:28:23.233
Maxon is seeing 20% faster
GPU render performance in

1751
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.266
Cinema 4D than on a
Windows work station maxed

1751
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.266
Cinema 4D than on a
Windows work station maxed

1752
01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:28.699
out with three of the
latest Nvidia Quadro cards.

1753
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.533
We are really excited to
announce that Maxon is

1754
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.033
bringing their Redshift
render engine to the Mac

1755
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.699
optimized for Metal.

1756
01:28:37.266 --> 01:28:38.000
And finally -

1757
01:28:38.266 --> 01:28:39.000
(Applause)

1758
01:28:39.066 --> 01:28:40.100
There you go.

1759
01:28:40.166 --> 01:28:42.399
The folks at Otoy are
already hard at work

1760
01:28:42.466 --> 01:28:44.833
building a version of
Octane that is really

1761
01:28:44.899 --> 01:28:47.199
going to shine with the
incredible GPU performance

1762
01:28:47.266 --> 01:28:48.766
of the new MacPro.

1763
01:28:49.933 --> 01:28:53.000
We are thrilled by the
excitement and commitment

1763
01:28:49.933 --> 01:28:53.000
We are thrilled by the
excitement and commitment

1764
01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:54.666
we are seeing from all of
these great developers.

1765
01:28:54.733 --> 01:28:56.399
And, of course, our own
internal app teams are

1766
01:28:56.466 --> 01:28:58.399
really excited about
the MacPro as well.

1767
01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.633
So, now, I would like to
bring up David Earl from

1768
01:29:00.699 --> 01:29:02.866
our Pro X marketing team
to give you a firsthand

1769
01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:04.766
look at some of the
amazing things you can do

1769
01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:04.766
look at some of the
amazing things you can do

1770
01:29:04.833 --> 01:29:07.500
in Logic and Final
Cut on the new MacPro.

1771
01:29:07.566 --> 01:29:08.533
David?

1772
01:29:08.699 --> 01:29:09.466
(Applause)

1773
01:29:13.566 --> 01:29:15.066
>> DAVID EARL:
Thanks, John.

1774
01:29:15.133 --> 01:29:18.833
I am thrilled to show you
Logic Pro 10 running on

1774
01:29:15.133 --> 01:29:18.833
I am thrilled to show you
Logic Pro 10 running on

1775
01:29:18.899 --> 01:29:19.633
the new MacPro.

1776
01:29:19.699 --> 01:29:21.133
To get started, we are
going to open up this

1777
01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:22.966
music score from a
documentary we are working

1778
01:29:23.033 --> 01:29:24.266
on that was shot in Kenya.

1779
01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:26.766
What you see here is a
Logic project and every

1780
01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:29.466
row is a track and every
track represents an

1780
01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:29.466
row is a track and every
track represents an

1781
01:29:29.533 --> 01:29:31.733
individual musical
instrument performance.

1782
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.666
So, let's have a listen.

1783
01:29:34.933 --> 01:29:36.100
(Music)

1784
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.100
Okay.

1785
01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:45.133
So, we wanted to have some
fun and see just how far

1786
01:29:45.199 --> 01:29:47.266
we could push this
powerful new Mac.

1787
01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:49.166
What you are looking
at here is a brand-new

1788
01:29:49.233 --> 01:29:51.300
version of Logic and the
theme of this release is

1789
01:29:51.366 --> 01:29:53.600
all about performance.

1790
01:29:53.666 --> 01:29:55.166
So, to show performance
I'm going to use these

1790
01:29:53.666 --> 01:29:55.166
So, to show performance
I'm going to use these

1791
01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:57.466
incredibly realistic
sampler instrument libraries.

1792
01:29:57.533 --> 01:29:59.833
I use the libraries so
that it sounds exactly

1793
01:29:59.899 --> 01:30:02.000
like a real orchestra
when I create my parts.

1794
01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:04.033
So, let's add a 50
piece percussion ensemble

1795
01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.600
to the score.

1796
01:30:07.899 --> 01:30:12.166
And you know what, how about
a 100-piece orchestra?

1796
01:30:07.899 --> 01:30:12.166
And you know what, how about
a 100-piece orchestra?

1797
01:30:12.233 --> 01:30:14.800
And how about another full
orchestra just because,

1798
01:30:14.866 --> 01:30:16.500
you know, we can.

1799
01:30:21.033 --> 01:30:24.133
Now, many composers have
to actually add a second

1800
01:30:24.199 --> 01:30:26.433
and third computer to be
able to run these massive

1801
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.000
orchestral libraries, but
the new MacPro with CPU

1802
01:30:29.066 --> 01:30:32.466
power and RAM can do this
all in a single unit.

1803
01:30:33.433 --> 01:30:34.566
So, of course, I'm going
to need a lot more to

1803
01:30:33.433 --> 01:30:34.566
So, of course, I'm going
to need a lot more to

1804
01:30:34.633 --> 01:30:36.433
push this MacPro.

1805
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.300
So, let's add a
ton more tracks.

1806
01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:41.066
So, we have never seen
this before in Logic.

1807
01:30:41.133 --> 01:30:46.166
I have got 300, 400, 500,
we can now have a thousand

1808
01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.066
audio tracks and a
thousand software

1808
01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.066
audio tracks and a
thousand software

1809
01:30:48.133 --> 01:30:49.133
instruments in Logic.

1810
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.733
(Applause)

1811
01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:57.000
That's four times the
amount that we had in our

1812
01:30:57.066 --> 01:30:59.633
previous version of Logic,
and, of course, with all

1813
01:30:59.699 --> 01:31:02.066
of this going on we
have to check the CPU.

1813
01:30:59.699 --> 01:31:02.066
of this going on we
have to check the CPU.

1814
01:31:02.133 --> 01:31:05.266
Opening the performance
meter, that is 56 threads

1815
01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:08.566
across 28 cores with more
tracks and plug-ins than

1816
01:31:08.633 --> 01:31:10.899
we have ever seen
before in Logic.

1817
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.066
The MacPro still
has power to spare.

1817
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.066
The MacPro still
has power to spare.

1818
01:31:13.133 --> 01:31:14.600
It's a monster
for running Logic.

1819
01:31:15.933 --> 01:31:16.866
Okay.

1820
01:31:16.933 --> 01:31:21.899
Now, let's take this music
score over to Final Cut.

1821
01:31:21.966 --> 01:31:25.466
It's the Soundtrack for
this beautiful documentary

1822
01:31:25.533 --> 01:31:27.899
that was all shot
and edited in HDR.

1822
01:31:25.533 --> 01:31:27.899
that was all shot
and edited in HDR.

1823
01:31:27.966 --> 01:31:29.633
It follows Ami Vitale.

1824
01:31:29.699 --> 01:31:31.600
She is a world-renowned
photo journalist on a

1825
01:31:31.666 --> 01:31:33.100
recent assignment to Kenya.

1826
01:31:35.833 --> 01:31:38.399
Now, what we see here, we
have never seen before in a Mac.

1827
01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:42.500
This is 8K ProRes RAW
playing back at full resolution.

1827
01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:42.500
This is 8K ProRes RAW
playing back at full resolution.

1828
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.933
Now, what makes 8K so
amazing is that there are

1829
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.133
over 33 million pixels in
every frame which means it

1830
01:31:48.199 --> 01:31:50.600
looks great on a huge
display like this, but it

1831
01:31:50.666 --> 01:31:52.733
includes enough resolution
that we can crop in and

1831
01:31:50.666 --> 01:31:52.733
includes enough resolution
that we can crop in and

1832
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.199
reframe for 4K projects
and, you know, we can add

1833
01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:59.899
8K effects in real-time
like this animated title,

1834
01:31:59.966 --> 01:32:02.333
and I think I'm going
to go in and add some

1835
01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:06.000
advanced color correction
and lens flare without stopping.

1835
01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:06.000
advanced color correction
and lens flare without stopping.

1836
01:32:06.066 --> 01:32:07.699
I don't have to wait
for it to render.

1837
01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:11.633
Now, so far we have been
watching a single stream

1838
01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:15.033
of 8K ProRes RAW but this
computer has Afterburner

1839
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.600
installed which means we
can push it even further

1840
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:21.699
and we can have our single
stream of 8K ProRes RAW,

1840
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:21.699
and we can have our single
stream of 8K ProRes RAW,

1841
01:32:21.766 --> 01:32:26.800
add another stream of 8K
and how about a third

1842
01:32:26.866 --> 01:32:29.866
stream 8K ProRes RAW
running simultaneously.

1843
01:32:29.933 --> 01:32:32.300
That's 100 million pixels.

1843
01:32:29.933 --> 01:32:32.300
That's 100 million pixels.

1844
01:32:32.366 --> 01:32:34.366
This has never been seen.

1845
01:32:35.033 --> 01:32:36.199
(Applause)

1846
01:32:38.533 --> 01:32:40.733
Never been seen before on
any video editing software

1847
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.466
on any computer.

1848
01:32:42.533 --> 01:32:45.233
The MacPro is an 8K power
house and absolutely by

1848
01:32:42.533 --> 01:32:45.233
The MacPro is an 8K power
house and absolutely by

1849
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.333
far the most powerful Mac
that's ever been created

1850
01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:50.266
for professional film
makers and musicians.

1851
01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:51.033
Thank you.

1852
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.133
Back to you, John.

1853
01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.133
(Applause)

1854
01:32:58.566 --> 01:32:59.966
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, David.

1855
01:33:00.033 --> 01:33:01.466
That performance is nuts.

1856
01:33:01.533 --> 01:33:03.366
So that is the new MacPro.

1857
01:33:03.433 --> 01:33:05.566
It is the most
configurable, most

1858
01:33:05.633 --> 01:33:09.833
expandable and by far the most powerful Mac we have ever made.

1859
01:33:10.466 --> 01:33:12.300
But, of course, an
extraordinary computer

1860
01:33:12.366 --> 01:33:15.566
deserves an extraordinary
display, and to tell you

1861
01:33:15.633 --> 01:33:17.500
more about that, I would
like to bring out Colleen

1862
01:33:17.566 --> 01:33:19.600
Novielli from the Mac
Product Marketing Team.

1863
01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:20.500
Colleen?

1864
01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:22.166
(Applause)

1865
01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.300
>> COLLEEN NOVIELLI:
Thank you, John.

1866
01:33:26.366 --> 01:33:28.500
Good morning.

1867
01:33:28.566 --> 01:33:31.733
Displays are incredibly
important to our pro

1868
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.566
customers because they
play a vital role in

1869
01:33:34.633 --> 01:33:36.833
creating their
life's best work.

1869
01:33:34.633 --> 01:33:36.833
creating their
life's best work.

1870
01:33:36.899 --> 01:33:40.366
Yet today, if you look at
their wish list, there is

1871
01:33:40.433 --> 01:33:42.866
no single display that
gives them every feature

1872
01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:47.266
they have asked for, and this one feature, High Dynamic Range

1873
01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.933
or HDR, it's increasingly requested because it's yet

1873
01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.933
or HDR, it's increasingly requested because it's yet

1874
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.199
to be delivered with
pro level precision.

1875
01:33:53.699 --> 01:33:55.100
So, what is HDR?

1876
01:33:55.166 --> 01:33:58.533
HDR is a way to bring
content to life by better

1877
01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.199
reflecting what the eye
can see in the real world.

1878
01:34:01.266 --> 01:34:03.800
The eye sees the brightest
specular highlights,

1878
01:34:01.266 --> 01:34:03.800
The eye sees the brightest
specular highlights,

1879
01:34:03.866 --> 01:34:06.699
really dark blacks,
vibrant, rich color and

1880
01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:08.133
all of the details
in between.

1881
01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.199
Today, more and more
devices can play HDR

1882
01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:14.833
content so more and more
pros who create that

1883
01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:17.733
content, they need
a great HDR display.

1883
01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:17.733
content, they need
a great HDR display.

1884
01:34:19.133 --> 01:34:21.566
There is one
class of displays.

1885
01:34:21.633 --> 01:34:24.033
It's commonly called
reference monitors and

1886
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.433
these do deliver true HDR
along with these features,

1887
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.000
but they are still missing
these features and they

1887
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.000
but they are still missing
these features and they

1888
01:34:31.066 --> 01:34:32.966
are incredibly expensive.

1889
01:34:33.033 --> 01:34:35.266
This one is $43,000.

1890
01:34:35.333 --> 01:34:38.266
So, our goal,
it was simple.

1891
01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:41.100
Make a display that
expertly delivers every

1891
01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:41.100
Make a display that
expertly delivers every

1892
01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:43.000
feature that pros
have asked for.

1893
01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.033
Like the MacPro, the
design is stunning and

1894
01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.100
every element is
built for pros.

1895
01:34:50.166 --> 01:34:52.500
And it's the most
incredible panel we

1896
01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:54.366
have ever made.

1896
01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:54.366
have ever made.

1897
01:34:54.433 --> 01:34:57.600
It's a 32-inch LCD display
with over 20 million

1898
01:34:57.666 --> 01:35:02.066
pixels, and with 218
pixels per inch, it's a

1899
01:35:02.133 --> 01:35:04.000
6K retina display.

1900
01:35:04.233 --> 01:35:06.100
(Applause)

1901
01:35:10.399 --> 01:35:13.233
It's the largest retina
display we have ever made.

1902
01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.933
It's over 40% larger than
the iMac 5K display,

1903
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.699
giving pros even more room for their tools and their content.

1904
01:35:20.833 --> 01:35:25.399
It has P3 and true 10-bit color and reference modes built in.

1905
01:35:25.466 --> 01:35:29.066
All expertly calibrated
at the factory.

1906
01:35:29.133 --> 01:35:32.000
And we keep that color
accurate at a super wide

1907
01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:35.066
viewing angle by using a
cutting-edge polarizer.

1907
01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:35.066
viewing angle by using a
cutting-edge polarizer.

1908
01:35:35.133 --> 01:35:37.466
For contrast, that's
twenty-five times better

1909
01:35:37.533 --> 01:35:39.366
than a typical
LCD display.

1910
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.866
(Applause)

1911
01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:43.100
It's awesome.

1912
01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.666
Now, the cover glass has our industry leading antireflective

1912
01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.666
Now, the cover glass has our industry leading antireflective

1913
01:35:47.733 --> 01:35:50.466
coating, but for challenging lighting conditions,

1914
01:35:50.533 --> 01:35:53.266
we have created an
innovative matte option.

1915
01:35:54.433 --> 01:35:56.533
So, most matte displays,
they add a coating to the

1916
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.600
glass and this coating, it
scatters the light, but it also

1916
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.600
glass and this coating, it
scatters the light, but it also

1917
01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:03.866
adds unwanted haze and sparkle and it lowers the contrast.

1918
01:36:03.933 --> 01:36:09.566
So instead, we precisely
etch the glass itself for

1919
01:36:09.633 --> 01:36:11.666
a nano texture surface and
this means enhanced image

1920
01:36:11.733 --> 01:36:14.166
quality and contrast along
with low reflectivity.

1920
01:36:11.733 --> 01:36:14.166
quality and contrast along
with low reflectivity.

1921
01:36:15.866 --> 01:36:20.566
Next, we have delivered HDR at a level never seen before.

1922
01:36:20.633 --> 01:36:23.633
Now, for great HDR
images, you need extreme

1923
01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:26.666
brightness right next to
extreme contrast or deep

1923
01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:26.666
brightness right next to
extreme contrast or deep

1924
01:36:26.733 --> 01:36:30.166
blacks, and this is
incredibly hard to achieve.

1925
01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:32.399
So, we have designed a
back-lighting system like

1926
01:36:32.466 --> 01:36:33.899
none other in the world.

1927
01:36:35.399 --> 01:36:37.366
First, a large array
of blue LEDs generates

1928
01:36:37.433 --> 01:36:39.866
extreme brightness.

1928
01:36:37.433 --> 01:36:39.866
extreme brightness.

1929
01:36:39.933 --> 01:36:42.600
We calibrate every single
LED on every single

1930
01:36:42.666 --> 01:36:45.566
display at the factory and
then this feeds a massive

1931
01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:50.966
algorithm and then this
modulates each LED based

1932
01:36:51.033 --> 01:36:53.333
on the content rapidly.

1933
01:36:53.399 --> 01:36:58.866
Then we use custom lenses
and reflectors to actually

1934
01:36:58.933 --> 01:36:59.800
shape and precisely
control the light.

1935
01:37:00.199 --> 01:37:02.266
Now, a typical thermal
system would make this

1936
01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:05.800
impossible to achieve for
more than a few minutes.

1936
01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:05.800
impossible to achieve for
more than a few minutes.

1937
01:37:05.866 --> 01:37:07.800
So, we did
something amazing.

1938
01:37:07.866 --> 01:37:10.466
We designed the rear
lattice pattern to act as

1939
01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:13.066
a heat sink and this
doubles the surface area,

1940
01:37:13.133 --> 01:37:16.300
quietly extracting
heat from each LED.

1941
01:37:16.366 --> 01:37:19.266
The results are
incredible.

1941
01:37:16.366 --> 01:37:19.266
The results are
incredible.

1942
01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.899
This display can maintain
1,000 nits of full screen

1943
01:37:22.966 --> 01:37:24.899
brightness indefinitely.

1944
01:37:25.366 --> 01:37:26.633
(Applause)

1945
01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:32.199
Forever.

1945
01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:32.199
Forever.

1946
01:37:32.266 --> 01:37:34.666
And 1,600 nits peak.

1947
01:37:34.733 --> 01:37:36.899
And this is going to allow
our pros to do things they

1948
01:37:36.966 --> 01:37:38.899
have been dreaming about.

1949
01:37:38.966 --> 01:37:42.833
So, for example, video
editors can now work with

1950
01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:46.133
their HDR content exactly
as it's intended and

1950
01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:46.133
their HDR content exactly
as it's intended and

1951
01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:49.166
photographers can now edit
an amazing HDR image like

1952
01:37:49.233 --> 01:37:51.699
this for hours.

1953
01:37:51.766 --> 01:37:53.966
And that is not all.

1954
01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:56.766
Those images are going to
have gorgeous, incredibly

1954
01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:56.766
Those images are going to
have gorgeous, incredibly

1955
01:37:56.833 --> 01:38:01.766
nuanced contrast, an
incredible one million to

1956
01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.699
one contrast ratio.

1957
01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:05.466
(Applause)

1958
01:38:09.033 --> 01:38:12.133
The images this display
produces are truly stunning.

1959
01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:17.500
With these capabilities,
we have taken this way

1960
01:38:17.566 --> 01:38:19.199
beyond High Dynamic Range.

1961
01:38:19.266 --> 01:38:23.633
This is extreme dynamic
range or XDR, and so we

1961
01:38:19.266 --> 01:38:23.633
This is extreme dynamic
range or XDR, and so we

1962
01:38:23.699 --> 01:38:27.100
call this display
the Pro Display XDR.

1963
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.533
(Applause)

1964
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.399
So now, we have delivered every feature on the pro wish list,

1964
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.399
So now, we have delivered every feature on the pro wish list,

1965
01:38:38.466 --> 01:38:40.133
but there is more.

1966
01:38:40.199 --> 01:38:43.633
Thunderbolt 3 will provide
seamless one cable connectivity.

1967
01:38:43.699 --> 01:38:45.833
So, with a 15-inch MacBook
Pro, you can have a

1968
01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:50.000
stunning two display
desktop setup or with the

1968
01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:50.000
stunning two display
desktop setup or with the

1969
01:38:50.066 --> 01:38:52.333
new MacPro, you can
connect an incredible six

1970
01:38:52.399 --> 01:38:58.266
displays with 6K
resolution, 120 million pixels.

1971
01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.333
Yes.

1972
01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:01.266
(Applause)

1972
01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:01.266
(Applause)

1973
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.566
Woo.

1974
01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:04.966
Yeah.

1975
01:39:05.033 --> 01:39:06.233
Woo.

1976
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.966
That's right.

1977
01:39:10.233 --> 01:39:12.600
Now, there is one more
feature that does not get

1978
01:39:12.666 --> 01:39:15.100
much attention on other
displays and that's the

1978
01:39:12.666 --> 01:39:15.100
much attention on other
displays and that's the

1979
01:39:15.166 --> 01:39:18.733
stand which is as pro
as the display itself.

1980
01:39:19.966 --> 01:39:22.800
First, it has an amazing
counter balancing arm that

1981
01:39:22.866 --> 01:39:25.866
makes the display feel
virtually weightless.

1982
01:39:25.933 --> 01:39:27.966
It provides tilt and
height adjustment and it

1982
01:39:25.933 --> 01:39:27.966
It provides tilt and
height adjustment and it

1983
01:39:28.033 --> 01:39:31.133
maintains the display's
angle as it's raised or

1984
01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:36.366
it's lowered and it has
rotation for Portrait Mode.

1985
01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:37.566
Yes.

1986
01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:39.833
(Applause)

1987
01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.500
And this is perfect
for retouching photos,

1988
01:39:45.566 --> 01:39:48.399
designing a web page
or writing code.

1989
01:39:48.466 --> 01:39:49.699
Yeah.

1990
01:39:52.866 --> 01:39:55.166
And it's removable.

1990
01:39:52.866 --> 01:39:55.166
And it's removable.

1991
01:39:55.233 --> 01:39:57.466
It quickly detaches from
the display to pack it up

1992
01:39:57.533 --> 01:39:59.199
and take it on location.

1993
01:40:00.133 --> 01:40:02.533
And finally, for pros
with unique mounting

1994
01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.066
requirements, we have
designed a base amount

1995
01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:07.666
adapter that attaches
in a matter of seconds.

1995
01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:07.666
adapter that attaches
in a matter of seconds.

1996
01:40:09.333 --> 01:40:11.566
So, that's the new
Pro Display XDR.

1997
01:40:11.633 --> 01:40:14.433
It's the only display in
the industry that delivers

1998
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.166
every feature on a pro's
wish list and more.

1999
01:40:18.233 --> 01:40:21.600
And now, all pros can use
the same display across

1999
01:40:18.233 --> 01:40:21.600
And now, all pros can use
the same display across

2000
01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:25.566
the work flow and have
the same incredible XDR

2001
01:40:25.633 --> 01:40:29.066
viewing experience with
all of the features they

2002
01:40:29.133 --> 01:40:32.766
need to create their
life's best work, making

2002
01:40:29.133 --> 01:40:32.766
need to create their
life's best work, making

2003
01:40:32.833 --> 01:40:36.000
this the world's
best Pro Display.

2004
01:40:36.266 --> 01:40:37.266
And now back to you, John.

2005
01:40:38.133 --> 01:40:39.500
(Applause)

2006
01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:48.866
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thanks, Colleen.

2007
01:40:48.933 --> 01:40:51.800
So that's the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR.

2008
01:40:51.866 --> 01:40:53.633
Groundbreaking in every
way, they deliver

2009
01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:55.333
performance and
capabilities that will

2010
01:40:55.399 --> 01:40:57.199
forever change
pro workflows.

2011
01:40:58.066 --> 01:40:59.933
Now, the new MacPro is
going to start with an

2012
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.500
eight core Xeon processor,
32 gigabytes of memory,

2013
01:41:03.566 --> 01:41:07.533
Radeon Pro 580X and
a 256 gigabyte SSD.

2014
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.133
If you look at other
systems configured with

2015
01:41:10.199 --> 01:41:13.699
comparable components, you will see they cost around $8,000.

2015
01:41:10.199 --> 01:41:13.699
comparable components, you will see they cost around $8,000.

2016
01:41:13.766 --> 01:41:17.166
The new MacPro will
start at $5,999.

2017
01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:19.300
(Applause)

2018
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.800
And it's going to be
available this fall.

2019
01:41:25.866 --> 01:41:27.866
Now, we know a lot of
customers who use the

2020
01:41:27.933 --> 01:41:30.133
MacPro really want to be
able to rack mount them in

2021
01:41:30.199 --> 01:41:31.833
edit bays and
machine rooms.

2022
01:41:31.899 --> 01:41:33.833
So, to support this, we
are also going to have a

2023
01:41:33.899 --> 01:41:36.133
version optimized
for rack deployment.

2024
01:41:36.433 --> 01:41:38.899
(Applause)

2024
01:41:36.433 --> 01:41:38.899
(Applause)

2025
01:41:42.733 --> 01:41:45.100
As for the Pro Display
XDR, well, the reference

2026
01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:47.333
monitors that we talked
about can cost tens of

2027
01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:50.133
thousands of dollars and still not match the feature set.

2027
01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:50.133
thousands of dollars and still not match the feature set.

2028
01:41:50.199 --> 01:41:53.633
The Pro Display XDR will be $4,999 for the display itself.

2029
01:41:58.133 --> 01:42:01.600
And the nano texture
version will be $5,999.

2030
01:42:01.666 --> 01:42:04.600
The VESA mount
adapter will be $199 and

2030
01:42:01.666 --> 01:42:04.600
The VESA mount
adapter will be $199 and

2031
01:42:04.666 --> 01:42:06.866
the pro stand, $999.

2032
01:42:07.066 --> 01:42:10.466
And like the MacPro, they will all be available in the fall.

2033
01:42:10.533 --> 01:42:14.399
So that is the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR.

2034
01:42:14.466 --> 01:42:15.866
Now, back to Tim.

2035
01:42:20.933 --> 01:42:23.333
>> TIM COOK: Thank you.

2036
01:42:23.399 --> 01:42:25.366
Thank you, John, and
thank you Colleen.

2037
01:42:25.433 --> 01:42:29.066
We can't wait to get the
new MacPro and the Pro

2037
01:42:25.433 --> 01:42:29.066
We can't wait to get the
new MacPro and the Pro

2038
01:42:29.133 --> 01:42:32.199
Display XDR into the hands
of our pro users and see

2039
01:42:32.266 --> 01:42:34.166
all the great things they
are going to create with them.

2040
01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:39.366
Now, powering the Mac
experience is macOS, the

2041
01:42:39.433 --> 01:42:42.433
world's most advanced
desktop Operating System.

2041
01:42:39.433 --> 01:42:42.433
world's most advanced
desktop Operating System.

2042
01:42:42.633 --> 01:42:44.633
(Applause)

2043
01:42:47.233 --> 01:42:49.533
The latest release of
macOS is Mojave with

2044
01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.166
system-wide Dark Mode and
new features for both

2045
01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:55.500
finder and desktop that
were inspired by pro users

2045
01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:55.500
finder and desktop that
were inspired by pro users

2046
01:42:55.566 --> 01:42:57.933
but designed for everyone.

2047
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.766
It's been a huge hit
with Mac customers.

2048
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.533
The next release of macOS
brings more exciting new

2049
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.433
features to the Mac, and
to tell you all about it,

2050
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.366
I'd like to invite Craig
back to the stage.

2050
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.366
I'd like to invite Craig
back to the stage.

2051
01:43:10.433 --> 01:43:11.266
Craig.

2052
01:43:11.466 --> 01:43:13.333
(Applause)

2053
01:43:17.699 --> 01:43:19.233
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Great to be back with all of you again.

2054
01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:22.366
So, for our next major
release of macOS, we are

2054
01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:22.366
So, for our next major
release of macOS, we are

2055
01:43:22.433 --> 01:43:25.133
moving out of the desert
into the beautiful waters

2056
01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:28.399
off the California coast,
a place for sailing,

2057
01:43:28.466 --> 01:43:30.933
diving and so much more.

2058
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.600
It's macOS Catalina.

2059
01:43:33.766 --> 01:43:35.933
(Applause)

2059
01:43:33.766 --> 01:43:35.933
(Applause)

2060
01:43:38.133 --> 01:43:40.566
Now, Catalina includes
cool new features, some

2061
01:43:40.633 --> 01:43:43.399
really fresh new apps and
some powerful technology

2062
01:43:43.466 --> 01:43:45.199
for Developers.

2063
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.100
Let's take a look.

2063
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.100
Let's take a look.

2064
01:43:47.166 --> 01:43:49.466
We begin with iTunes.

2065
01:43:49.533 --> 01:43:53.500
Now, iTunes started
completely focused, rip,

2066
01:43:53.566 --> 01:43:56.500
mix, and burn
songs on your Mac.

2067
01:43:56.566 --> 01:43:59.800
And then came the iTunes
Music Store kicking off

2068
01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:03.033
the digital music
revolution.

2068
01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:03.033
the digital music
revolution.

2069
01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:08.033
And then it took on Podcasts
and it redefined radio.

2070
01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:11.166
And then video,
introducing us to

2071
01:44:11.233 --> 01:44:13.933
on-demand movies and
ad-free TV, and if that

2071
01:44:11.233 --> 01:44:13.933
on-demand movies and
ad-free TV, and if that

2072
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.233
weren't enough, it also
handled all of your

2073
01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:20.899
syncing, making possible
the first iPod and iPhones.

2074
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.133
Well, now, customers love
iTunes and everything it can do.

2074
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.133
Well, now, customers love
iTunes and everything it can do.

2075
01:44:26.199 --> 01:44:29.666
But if there is one thing
we hear over and over,

2076
01:44:29.733 --> 01:44:33.100
it's can iTunes
do even more?

2077
01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:36.233
I think it can.

2078
01:44:36.666 --> 01:44:41.366
Like how about
Calendar in iTunes?

2078
01:44:36.666 --> 01:44:41.366
Like how about
Calendar in iTunes?

2079
01:44:41.433 --> 01:44:43.766
I mean, you could have all
of your appointments and

2080
01:44:43.833 --> 01:44:47.866
your best tracks
right in one app.

2081
01:44:47.933 --> 01:44:48.866
Could we take it further?

2082
01:44:48.933 --> 01:44:49.633
I think so.

2083
01:44:49.699 --> 01:44:51.600
How about Mail in iTunes?

2084
01:44:52.199 --> 01:44:53.066
(Applause)

2085
01:44:53.266 --> 01:44:55.300
And maybe Safari
in iTunes?

2086
01:44:55.366 --> 01:44:57.800
And how are you going to
switch between these apps?

2087
01:44:57.866 --> 01:45:00.199
Well, of course you
will add a dock.

2088
01:45:00.266 --> 01:45:01.533
I think we've nailed it.

2089
01:45:01.933 --> 01:45:03.166
(Applause)

2090
01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:14.633
"Truth Be Told" our
team had a better idea.

2091
01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:18.333
The future of Apple Music
or iTunes at not one app

2091
01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:18.333
The future of Apple Music
or iTunes at not one app

2092
01:45:18.399 --> 01:45:24.233
but three, Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.

2093
01:45:25.066 --> 01:45:27.466
(Applause)

2094
01:45:29.066 --> 01:45:31.166
Let's start with Apple
Music because Apple Music

2094
01:45:29.066 --> 01:45:31.166
Let's start with Apple
Music because Apple Music

2095
01:45:31.233 --> 01:45:34.500
in Catalina is the best
music app we have ever made.

2096
01:45:35.166 --> 01:45:38.699
With its singular focus on
music, it's so simple, but

2097
01:45:38.766 --> 01:45:41.933
it has all of the powerful
music features you expect

2098
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.199
from iTunes all while
being just blazingly fast.

2098
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.199
from iTunes all while
being just blazingly fast.

2099
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.766
It's the best place for
Apple Music subscribers,

2100
01:45:48.833 --> 01:45:51.066
with personalized
recommendations from a

2101
01:45:51.133 --> 01:45:54.100
catalog of over
50 million tracks.

2102
01:45:54.433 --> 01:45:58.333
And for those of you that
use iTunes to sync, we

2102
01:45:54.433 --> 01:45:58.333
And for those of you that
use iTunes to sync, we

2103
01:45:58.399 --> 01:46:00.866
made that experience
better as well because now

2104
01:46:00.933 --> 01:46:05.033
when you plug in your
phone, this is what you see.

2105
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:06.166
Nothing.

2106
01:46:06.366 --> 01:46:09.399
(Applause)

2107
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.199
If you do want to sync,
you can find it in the side

2108
01:46:16.266 --> 01:46:20.266
bar in finder; all of your
sync options are right there.

2109
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:23.866
(Applause)

2109
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:23.866
(Applause)

2110
01:46:24.133 --> 01:46:27.666
And next, let's turn our
attention to Podcast.

2111
01:46:27.733 --> 01:46:29.933
It brings a dedicated
Podcast listening

2112
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.733
experience to the Mac and
it features all of the

2113
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.133
great features you are
used to in iOS, like

2114
01:46:35.199 --> 01:46:37.800
listen now where you can
see new episodes and keep track

2114
01:46:35.199 --> 01:46:37.800
listen now where you can
see new episodes and keep track

2115
01:46:37.866 --> 01:46:41.100
of your listening across all
of your devices and it

2116
01:46:41.166 --> 01:46:44.633
has a great new feature and it has to do with search.

2117
01:46:45.366 --> 01:46:48.233
You know, sometimes you
hear about something on

2118
01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.033
the radio maybe or a new
podcast or something on

2118
01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.033
the radio maybe or a new
podcast or something on

2119
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.766
the news and you think oh,
I want to hear more about

2120
01:46:51.833 --> 01:46:54.133
that, but you are not sure
what show it was on or

2121
01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:56.699
even that it appeared
in the title.

2122
01:46:56.766 --> 01:46:59.833
Well, now we use machine
learning to index the

2123
01:46:59.899 --> 01:47:03.533
contents of the spoken
content of Podcasts, so

2123
01:46:59.899 --> 01:47:03.533
contents of the spoken
content of Podcasts, so

2124
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.633
now you can search that
content and find the

2125
01:47:05.699 --> 01:47:09.066
Podcast with just a
few clicks in the app.

2126
01:47:09.133 --> 01:47:10.000
It's great.

2127
01:47:10.199 --> 01:47:12.266
(Applause)

2128
01:47:14.366 --> 01:47:18.300
And finally, the Apple TV
app, your new home for TV

2128
01:47:14.366 --> 01:47:18.300
And finally, the Apple TV
app, your new home for TV

2129
01:47:18.366 --> 01:47:20.366
and music on the Mac.

2130
01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:22.866
Now, you will love having
access to Watch Now,

2131
01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:25.766
including all of your
great channels like HBO

2132
01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:29.199
and Showtime, and it has
all of your purchased

2132
01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:29.199
and Showtime, and it has
all of your purchased

2133
01:47:29.266 --> 01:47:31.699
movies for iTunes as well,
and they have never looked

2134
01:47:31.766 --> 01:47:35.066
or sounded better because
now on recent Macs, we

2135
01:47:35.133 --> 01:47:39.666
have support for 4K HDR
playback on the Mac with

2136
01:47:39.733 --> 01:47:41.833
HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

2136
01:47:39.733 --> 01:47:41.833
HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

2137
01:47:42.933 --> 01:47:45.633
And Dolby Atmos playback
as well so you will

2138
01:47:45.699 --> 01:47:49.366
experience amazing spatial
audio rendered right out

2139
01:47:49.433 --> 01:47:51.333
of your MacBook's speakers.

2140
01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:54.899
So, that's Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple

2140
01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:54.899
So, that's Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple

2141
01:47:54.966 --> 01:47:58.533
TV, and now I want to
turn to something new.

2142
01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.933
We call it sidecar.

2143
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.466
Yeah.

2144
01:48:03.966 --> 01:48:07.433
Now, Mac users love
connecting their laptop to

2144
01:48:03.966 --> 01:48:07.433
Now, Mac users love
connecting their laptop to

2145
01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.766
an external display so
they can spread out their

2146
01:48:09.833 --> 01:48:12.600
work, but often when they
have to leave on the go,

2147
01:48:12.666 --> 01:48:15.266
they have to leave
that display behind.

2148
01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:19.433
Well, no longer, because
now you can use your iPad

2149
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.600
as a second display
for your Mac.

2149
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.600
as a second display
for your Mac.

2150
01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.300
(Applause)

2151
01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.899
It's great.

2152
01:48:28.966 --> 01:48:30.866
You can spread out your
work right across your

2153
01:48:30.933 --> 01:48:34.733
iPad, but, of course, some
pro users like using these

2153
01:48:30.933 --> 01:48:34.733
iPad, but, of course, some
pro users like using these

2154
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.600
dedicated tablets for
precise input on their Mac.

2155
01:48:39.399 --> 01:48:42.233
Well, now with the iPad
and Apple Pencil, you can

2156
01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.300
do that too.

2157
01:48:45.366 --> 01:48:48.066
It works both wired and
wirelessly so you can get

2157
01:48:45.366 --> 01:48:48.066
It works both wired and
wirelessly so you can get

2158
01:48:48.133 --> 01:48:51.000
comfortable, and it
works across all of your

2159
01:48:51.066 --> 01:48:54.233
favorite Mac Apps
that support tablets.

2160
01:48:55.399 --> 01:48:58.600
Now, next I want to
turn to accessibility.

2161
01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:01.333
Now, we believe technology
is most powerful when

2161
01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:01.333
Now, we believe technology
is most powerful when

2162
01:49:01.399 --> 01:49:03.199
everyone can use it.

2163
01:49:03.266 --> 01:49:06.066
So, we engineer a wide
array of assistive

2164
01:49:06.133 --> 01:49:08.766
technologies into our
all of our products.

2165
01:49:09.733 --> 01:49:11.733
Now, for users with
physical motor

2166
01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.366
limitations, voice can be
an extremely powerful way

2166
01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.366
limitations, voice can be
an extremely powerful way

2167
01:49:14.433 --> 01:49:16.633
to operate a computer.

2168
01:49:16.699 --> 01:49:21.000
And this year, we are proud
to introduce voice control.

2169
01:49:21.066 --> 01:49:23.666
Now, voice control lets
you control your Mac

2170
01:49:23.733 --> 01:49:26.600
entirely with your voice
and not just that.

2170
01:49:23.733 --> 01:49:26.600
entirely with your voice
and not just that.

2171
01:49:26.666 --> 01:49:30.199
We are also bringing
it to iOS as well.

2172
01:49:30.266 --> 01:49:32.766
I would like to show you
just how transformative

2173
01:49:32.833 --> 01:49:34.366
this can be.

2174
01:49:38.933 --> 01:49:40.766
>> MALE SPEAKER: Wake up.

2175
01:49:40.833 --> 01:49:42.966
Voice control is a
breakthrough feature that

2176
01:49:43.033 --> 01:49:45.966
gives you full control of
your devices, comma, with

2177
01:49:46.033 --> 01:49:47.800
just your voice, period.

2178
01:49:47.866 --> 01:49:50.500
It's a whole new way to
do everything you love,

2179
01:49:50.566 --> 01:49:51.300
period.

2179
01:49:50.566 --> 01:49:51.300

01:50:47.533 --> 01:50:48.766
Hey, good to see you.

2203
01:50:49.266 --> 01:50:50.533
Open music.

2204
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.933
Turn up the volume.

2205
01:50:55.199 --> 01:50:57.933
(Applause)

2205
01:50:55.199 --> 01:50:57.933
(Applause)

2206
01:51:10.633 --> 01:51:12.166
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So,
that's voice control.

2207
01:51:12.233 --> 01:51:14.033
Now, it leverages the
latest Siri voice

2208
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.899
recognition technology to
precisely understand what

2209
01:51:16.966 --> 01:51:19.166
you are saying and all
of those commands and of

2210
01:51:19.233 --> 01:51:21.933
course, your voice is
processed locally on

2211
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.300
device so none of that
audio goes to Apple.

2212
01:51:25.866 --> 01:51:29.333
Now, next, I want to turn
to a new solution that helps

2213
01:51:29.399 --> 01:51:32.366
you find your Mac should it
ever be lost or stolen.

2214
01:51:32.433 --> 01:51:34.000
It's called Find My.

2215
01:51:34.233 --> 01:51:37.533
Now, Find My combines Find
My iPhone with Find My

2215
01:51:34.233 --> 01:51:37.533
Now, Find My combines Find
My iPhone with Find My

2216
01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.266
Friends and it's now
available on the Mac and

2217
01:51:40.333 --> 01:51:42.666
iOS devices as well.

2218
01:51:42.733 --> 01:51:45.833
And it has a new twist
because it can now even

2219
01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:49.133
locate Apple devices
that are offline.

2219
01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:49.133
locate Apple devices
that are offline.

2220
01:51:49.433 --> 01:51:51.699
Now, this is particularly
important for Macs because

2221
01:51:51.766 --> 01:51:54.666
often your laptop is
folded up in a bag,

2222
01:51:54.733 --> 01:51:58.199
asleep, and no longer
on the network.

2223
01:51:58.266 --> 01:52:00.699
Now, the way this
works is really cool.

2224
01:52:01.466 --> 01:52:04.266
Let's say you have
misplaced your MacBook.

2225
01:52:04.333 --> 01:52:07.399
So, even when it's offline
and sleeping, it sends out

2226
01:52:07.466 --> 01:52:10.466
a secure Bluetooth beacon
that can be detected by

2227
01:52:10.533 --> 01:52:12.866
other people's Apple
devices nearby.

2228
01:52:13.966 --> 01:52:16.199
Now, they can relay your
MacBook's location to the

2228
01:52:13.966 --> 01:52:16.199
Now, they can relay your
MacBook's location to the

2229
01:52:16.266 --> 01:52:20.000
network and ultimately back
to you so you can find it.

2230
01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:23.033
Now, what's amazing
is that this whole

2231
01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.466
interaction is end to end
encrypted and anonymous.

2232
01:52:26.533 --> 01:52:29.100
It uses just tiny bits of
data that piggyback on

2232
01:52:26.533 --> 01:52:29.100
It uses just tiny bits of
data that piggyback on

2233
01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:32.466
existing network traffic,
so there is no need to

2234
01:52:32.533 --> 01:52:35.600
worry about your battery
life, your data usage,

2235
01:52:35.666 --> 01:52:37.666
or your privacy.

2236
01:52:38.566 --> 01:52:40.566
Next, activation lock.

2236
01:52:38.566 --> 01:52:40.566
Next, activation lock.

2237
01:52:40.633 --> 01:52:43.366
We are bringing activation
lock to your Mac to make

2238
01:52:43.433 --> 01:52:45.833
it far less
attractive to thieves.

2239
01:52:45.899 --> 01:52:49.366
It's available on all Macs
with a T2 security chip

2240
01:52:49.433 --> 01:52:52.966
and it works just like
on your iPhone and iPad.

2241
01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.500
So, in the unfortunate
event that your Mac ever

2242
01:52:55.566 --> 01:52:58.800
is stolen, the thief will
find it completely useless

2243
01:52:58.866 --> 01:53:01.266
because they can't even
install or boot it unless

2244
01:53:01.333 --> 01:53:04.066
you reactivate it with
your credentials.

2245
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.300
Now, I want to turn to
apps because there is much

2245
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.300
Now, I want to turn to
apps because there is much

2246
01:53:07.366 --> 01:53:10.333
more to the App
story in Catalina.

2247
01:53:10.399 --> 01:53:13.699
Now, you will find of
course the beautiful new

2248
01:53:13.766 --> 01:53:17.266
photo browsing experience
in Photos, an updated

2249
01:53:17.333 --> 01:53:19.966
start page in Safari.

2249
01:53:17.333 --> 01:53:19.966
start page in Safari.

2250
01:53:20.033 --> 01:53:22.933
The brand-new gallery
view in Notes.

2251
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.966
And a completely
redesigned Reminders app,

2252
01:53:28.033 --> 01:53:30.433
but also for the first
time, we're bringing

2253
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.133
Screen Time to the Mac.

2253
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.133
Screen Time to the Mac.

2254
01:53:32.333 --> 01:53:34.266
Now, it has all of the
same great features from

2255
01:53:34.333 --> 01:53:36.733
iOS, so you and your
family can understand the

2256
01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.266
complete picture of your
use across all of your

2257
01:53:39.333 --> 01:53:41.933
devices and all of the
limits are enforced across

2258
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.766
all of your devices.

2259
01:53:44.699 --> 01:53:46.966
We think this is going to
be great for families.

2259
01:53:44.699 --> 01:53:46.966
We think this is going to
be great for families.

2260
01:53:47.033 --> 01:53:51.133
Now, of course, Mac users
also love third party apps

2261
01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:54.300
and they love to have
more on the platform.

2262
01:53:54.366 --> 01:53:56.833
We have been working
on a new project that

2263
01:53:56.899 --> 01:53:59.333
internally we call Project
Catalyst, and it's new

2263
01:53:56.899 --> 01:53:59.333
internally we call Project
Catalyst, and it's new

2264
01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:02.233
technology that lets
developers quickly and

2265
01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:05.300
efficiently create apps
for the Mac based on their

2266
01:54:05.366 --> 01:54:07.166
existing iPad apps.

2267
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.333
Now, there are over a
million iPad apps out

2268
01:54:10.399 --> 01:54:13.466
there and we think some of them would be fantastic on the Mac.

2268
01:54:10.399 --> 01:54:13.466
there and we think some of them would be fantastic on the Mac.

2269
01:54:13.533 --> 01:54:16.433
Now, iPad developers, of
course, would also love to

2270
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.033
have a greater audience
to sell their apps to and

2271
01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.233
there are 100 million
active Mac users out there

2272
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.533
waiting for them.

2272
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.533
waiting for them.

2273
01:54:24.933 --> 01:54:26.966
Now, if you are running
Mojave, you already use

2274
01:54:27.033 --> 01:54:29.233
Catalyst technology
because we used it to

2275
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.899
build News, Stocks,
Voice Memos, Home.

2276
01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:36.666
Now, that was just V1 and we have learned a lot since then.

2277
01:54:37.333 --> 01:54:39.966
We have spent the last
year expanding the number

2278
01:54:40.033 --> 01:54:42.566
of categories of apps the
technology could support

2279
01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:44.800
and we have tuned it up
so it results in a much

2280
01:54:44.866 --> 01:54:47.600
better Mac App.

2281
01:54:47.666 --> 01:54:49.133
We are pleased to announce
that we are making

2282
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:53.466
Catalyst available to developers today in macOS Catalina.

2282
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:53.466
Catalyst available to developers today in macOS Catalina.

2283
01:54:53.666 --> 01:54:56.166
(Applause)

2284
01:55:01.899 --> 01:55:04.866
Now, the experience starts
right here in XCode.

2284
01:55:01.899 --> 01:55:04.866
Now, the experience starts
right here in XCode.

2285
01:55:04.933 --> 01:55:08.333
Just open up your existing
iPad project, check the

2286
01:55:08.399 --> 01:55:10.533
Mac checkbox.

2287
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.266
And just like that, you
will get a huge head start

2288
01:55:13.333 --> 01:55:17.000
because XCode
automatically builds in

2288
01:55:13.333 --> 01:55:17.000
because XCode
automatically builds in

2289
01:55:17.066 --> 01:55:18.500
all of the fundamental
features like cursor

2290
01:55:18.566 --> 01:55:20.033
controls, window controls
and so forth, and that

2291
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.399
lets you focus on the
finishing touches, maybe a

2292
01:55:23.466 --> 01:55:26.399
translucent side bar, pull
down menus or whatever

2293
01:55:26.466 --> 01:55:29.766
features would make your
Mac - your app just great

2293
01:55:26.466 --> 01:55:29.766
features would make your
Mac - your app just great

2294
01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:31.033
on the Mac.

2295
01:55:31.699 --> 01:55:34.333
Now, this means one
Development Team for the

2296
01:55:34.399 --> 01:55:37.800
first time can build a
single app that can span

2297
01:55:37.866 --> 01:55:41.833
all the way from
iPhone to iPad to Mac.

2298
01:55:42.633 --> 01:55:44.100
Now, we have been
working with a number of

2299
01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:47.333
developers previewing
Catalyst technology, and

2300
01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:50.399
we have already seen
some great Mac Apps.

2301
01:55:50.466 --> 01:55:54.399
For instance, the great
racing game Asphalt 9:

2302
01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:56.600
Legends from Gameloft.

2302
01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:56.600
Legends from Gameloft.

2303
01:55:56.666 --> 01:55:58.000
Here is what
they had to say.

2304
01:55:58.399 --> 01:56:01.500
"We had Asphalt 9: Legends
for the Mac running on

2305
01:56:01.566 --> 01:56:02.766
the first day.

2306
01:56:02.833 --> 01:56:06.133
It looks stunning and runs
super fast using Metal on

2307
01:56:06.199 --> 01:56:07.966
powerful Mac hardware."

2308
01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.100
And Twitter, excited to
come back to the Mac with

2309
01:56:12.166 --> 01:56:13.933
a native app.

2310
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.833
They said, "We had
Twitter for Mac running -

2311
01:56:15.899 --> 01:56:19.033
including native Mac
features - in just days.

2312
01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.233
Now a single team can
efficiently manage Twitter

2312
01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.233
Now a single team can
efficiently manage Twitter

2313
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.866
for iPhone, iPad and Mac."

2314
01:56:25.733 --> 01:56:28.300
And finally, we asked
Atlassian, Developers of

2315
01:56:28.366 --> 01:56:30.766
Jira Cloud, leading
project management

2316
01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:33.399
solution for agile
software development, to

2317
01:56:33.466 --> 01:56:35.466
give Catalyst a try.

2317
01:56:33.466 --> 01:56:35.466
give Catalyst a try.

2318
01:56:35.533 --> 01:56:37.833
To tell you more about it,
I would like to invite Rob

2319
01:56:37.899 --> 01:56:40.699
Chatfield, Senior iOS
Engineer, to the stage.

2320
01:56:40.766 --> 01:56:42.500
Rob, come on up.

2321
01:56:42.533 --> 01:56:44.000
(Applause)

2322
01:56:44.233 --> 01:56:48.033
>> ROB CHATFIELD:
Thanks, Craig.

2322
01:56:44.233 --> 01:56:48.033
>> ROB CHATFIELD:
Thanks, Craig.

2323
01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:51.966
Jira has been on the web
for years and recently we

2324
01:56:52.033 --> 01:56:54.800
have put a lot of effort
into mobile, like our iOS

2325
01:56:54.866 --> 01:56:57.366
app that offers quick
and easy access to your

2326
01:56:57.433 --> 01:56:58.600
projects on the go.

2327
01:56:59.233 --> 01:57:01.300
Many of you have asked us
for a similar experience

2327
01:56:59.233 --> 01:57:01.300
Many of you have asked us
for a similar experience

2328
01:57:01.366 --> 01:57:02.666
on the Mac.

2329
01:57:02.733 --> 01:57:05.133
Well, today, I am thrilled
to announce that we have

2330
01:57:05.199 --> 01:57:06.366
done just that.

2331
01:57:07.166 --> 01:57:08.899
We were impressed that we
were able to get the Jira

2332
01:57:08.966 --> 01:57:12.100
project up and running in
just a few days and it's a

2333
01:57:12.166 --> 01:57:13.966
huge project.

2333
01:57:12.166 --> 01:57:13.966
huge project.

2334
01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:17.466
Now, our iOS devs
are Mac devs too.

2335
01:57:17.533 --> 01:57:20.033
One code base, one team.

2336
01:57:21.066 --> 01:57:25.433
Here is a preview.

2337
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.466
The boards view looks
amazing on the Mac display

2337
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.466
The boards view looks
amazing on the Mac display

2338
01:57:28.533 --> 01:57:31.333
with plenty of room for
multitasking, and the

2339
01:57:31.399 --> 01:57:34.233
benefit of this being a
native app is that it's

2340
01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:36.000
insanely fast.

2341
01:57:36.066 --> 01:57:38.533
We can switch between
these views instantly

2342
01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.533
which is a level of
performance you just don't

2342
01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.533
which is a level of
performance you just don't

2343
01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.833
get on the Web.

2344
01:57:42.333 --> 01:57:45.133
And this is one project,
so all of the work we did

2345
01:57:45.199 --> 01:57:48.433
on iPad automatically
translated to the Mac,

2346
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:52.466
like keyboard shortcuts,
Spotlight, and Drag and Drop.

2346
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:52.466
like keyboard shortcuts,
Spotlight, and Drag and Drop.

2347
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.533
And it was easy to add
those finishing touches

2348
01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.533
that make it perfect
for the desktop.

2349
01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.500
For example, we added our top tasks into the custom toolbar.

2350
01:58:03.566 --> 01:58:07.333
All of this never would
have happened without

2350
01:58:03.566 --> 01:58:07.333
All of this never would
have happened without

2351
01:58:07.399 --> 01:58:08.866
Project Catalyst.

2352
01:58:08.933 --> 01:58:12.300
We are super excited to be
bringing the Jira app to

2353
01:58:12.366 --> 01:58:14.399
Mac and can't wait
for you to try it.

2354
01:58:14.466 --> 01:58:16.933
So, look for Jira Cloud
in the Mac App Store

2355
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.233
later this year.

2355
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.233
later this year.

2356
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.633
Thank you very much.

2357
01:58:20.033 --> 01:58:24.899
(Applause)

2358
01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:27.699
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, we
are really excited about

2359
01:58:27.766 --> 01:58:30.766
this technology and
excited to see what apps

2360
01:58:30.833 --> 01:58:32.866
you all bring to the Mac
App Store this fall.

2360
01:58:30.833 --> 01:58:32.866
you all bring to the Mac
App Store this fall.

2361
01:58:33.899 --> 01:58:36.266
So that's macOS Catalina.

2362
01:58:36.333 --> 01:58:39.600
Sidecar, strong security
improvements, great new

2363
01:58:39.666 --> 01:58:42.733
system apps and Project
Catalyst bringing a whole

2364
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.199
new way to bring
new apps to the Mac.

2364
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.199
new way to bring
new apps to the Mac.

2365
01:58:47.333 --> 01:58:50.066
You know, you have seen
a lot today in terms of

2366
01:58:50.133 --> 01:58:52.066
tools for pro users, and
you know who our biggest

2367
01:58:52.133 --> 01:58:54.233
group of pros is?

2368
01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.833
Well, it's developers,
all of you.

2369
01:58:56.899 --> 01:59:01.733
And, you know, everything
we do for Developers is

2369
01:58:56.899 --> 01:59:01.733
And, you know, everything
we do for Developers is

2370
01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.266
focused on the goal of
helping you create the

2371
01:59:04.333 --> 01:59:07.533
greatest and most
innovative apps and we do

2372
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.466
this by providing tools
and technologies designed

2372
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.466
this by providing tools
and technologies designed

2373
01:59:10.533 --> 01:59:12.600
to give you a head start.

2374
01:59:13.733 --> 01:59:16.366
Well, this year we have a
whole bunch to talk about,

2375
01:59:16.433 --> 01:59:19.699
like Metal and Core ML,
but we are going to cover

2376
01:59:19.766 --> 01:59:21.199
that later in
the conference.

2377
01:59:21.266 --> 01:59:23.866
Today I want to focus
on just two areas.

2377
01:59:21.266 --> 01:59:23.866
Today I want to focus
on just two areas.

2378
01:59:23.933 --> 01:59:25.866
AR and Swift.

2379
01:59:25.933 --> 01:59:27.699
And we will start with AR.

2380
01:59:28.399 --> 01:59:31.933
Today, we have three
really big announcements,

2381
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.666
starting with RealityKit.

2382
01:59:34.733 --> 01:59:37.333
So, you know, creating
complex 3D environments

2382
01:59:34.733 --> 01:59:37.333
So, you know, creating
complex 3D environments

2383
01:59:37.399 --> 01:59:40.833
can require deep knowledge
of 3D modeling and mastery

2384
01:59:40.899 --> 01:59:44.533
of sophisticated gaming
engines like Unity and

2385
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.600
Unreal, but what about the
developers who want to

2386
01:59:47.666 --> 01:59:50.500
incorporate 3D and AR in
their apps but they don't

2386
01:59:47.666 --> 01:59:50.500
incorporate 3D and AR in
their apps but they don't

2387
01:59:50.566 --> 01:59:52.100
have that experience?

2388
01:59:52.166 --> 01:59:54.166
Well, that's where
RealityKit comes in.

2389
01:59:54.466 --> 01:59:56.966
It's built from the ground
up for AR with photo

2390
01:59:57.033 --> 01:59:59.933
realistic rendering,
amazing effects like

2391
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.866
camera motion blur
and noise, and it is

2391
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.866
camera motion blur
and noise, and it is

2392
02:00:02.933 --> 02:00:06.966
seamlessly integrated into ARKit and has a native Swift API.

2393
02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:10.166
Now, how do you actually
model your 3D content?

2394
02:00:10.233 --> 02:00:13.533
Well, that's where Reality
Composer comes in.

2395
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.733
Reality composer is a new
app featuring Drag and

2395
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.733
Reality composer is a new
app featuring Drag and

2396
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.100
Drop - a Drag and Drop
interface and a library of

2397
02:00:19.166 --> 02:00:22.199
high quality objects and
animations making it

2398
02:00:22.266 --> 02:00:25.233
incredibly fast and
easy to build an

2399
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.466
interactive environment.

2400
02:00:27.533 --> 02:00:29.033
Now, of course, it's
integrated with XCode, but

2400
02:00:27.533 --> 02:00:29.033
Now, of course, it's
integrated with XCode, but

2401
02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.600
it's also
available on iOS.

2402
02:00:31.666 --> 02:00:35.433
So, you can edit, test,
and tune your app right on

2403
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.066
the device where it will
ultimately be delivered.

2404
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.066
Now, of course, the
foundation of AR on iOS is

2404
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.066
Now, of course, the
foundation of AR on iOS is

2405
02:00:42.133 --> 02:00:45.800
ARKit, and ARKit
is a major update.

2406
02:00:45.866 --> 02:00:48.766
I want to focus on
one area around the

2407
02:00:48.833 --> 02:00:51.899
improvement in the way
people are handled in AR

2408
02:00:51.966 --> 02:00:54.366
scenes starting with
people occlusion.

2408
02:00:51.966 --> 02:00:54.366
scenes starting with
people occlusion.

2409
02:00:54.433 --> 02:00:56.066
Now, this is insane.

2410
02:00:56.233 --> 02:00:57.466
(Applause)

2411
02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.100
What used to require
painstaking compositing by

2412
02:00:59.166 --> 02:01:01.566
hand can now be
done in real time.

2413
02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.266
(Applause)

2414
02:01:03.466 --> 02:01:05.300
Now, by knowing where
these people are in the

2415
02:01:05.366 --> 02:01:07.100
scenes you can see we can
layer virtual content in

2415
02:01:05.366 --> 02:01:07.100
scenes you can see we can
layer virtual content in

2416
02:01:07.166 --> 02:01:08.800
front and behind them.

2417
02:01:08.866 --> 02:01:12.166
And check this out;
Motion Capture.

2418
02:01:12.233 --> 02:01:14.666
Just point your camera at
a person and we can track

2419
02:01:14.733 --> 02:01:18.133
in real-time the positions
of their head, their torso and

2420
02:01:18.199 --> 02:01:21.933
their limbs and feed it as an input into the AR experience.

2420
02:01:18.199 --> 02:01:21.933
their limbs and feed it as an input into the AR experience.

2421
02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.433
(Applause)

2422
02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.833
Now, Developers are going
to do amazing things with

2423
02:01:25.899 --> 02:01:30.133
ARKit 3, and that
brings us to Minecraft.

2424
02:01:30.199 --> 02:01:32.633
Minecraft is the
bestselling game of all

2425
02:01:32.699 --> 02:01:35.666
time, and a great
platform for creativity.

2425
02:01:32.699 --> 02:01:35.666
time, and a great
platform for creativity.

2426
02:01:35.733 --> 02:01:39.533
So, to see how ARKit is
enabling Minecraft to go

2427
02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.733
to the next level, I'm
happy to welcome to the

2428
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.733
stage, Lydia Winters and
Saxs Persson from Mojang.

boundaries and build
unique experiences.

2433
02:02:02.733 --> 02:02:06.066
We are here today to show
you our newest creation.

2434
02:02:06.899 --> 02:02:07.833
>> SAXS PERSSON: We have
been dreaming about a

2435
02:02:07.899 --> 02:02:10.433
Minecraft in the real
world and Minecraft in

2436
02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:12.100
Augmented Reality.

2436
02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:12.100
Augmented Reality.

2437
02:02:12.166 --> 02:02:15.366
We share a vision with
Apple, how AR can uniquely

2438
02:02:15.433 --> 02:02:18.433
connect us to the world
and today technology is

2439
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.000
ready for that vision.

2440
02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:21.733
We built something we
think is pretty special.

2441
02:02:22.333 --> 02:02:24.399
>> LYDIA WINTERS: We are
excited to demo gameplay

2442
02:02:24.466 --> 02:02:27.833
for the very first time
right here on stage.

2442
02:02:24.466 --> 02:02:27.833
for the very first time
right here on stage.

2443
02:02:28.066 --> 02:02:30.633
(Applause)

2444
02:02:33.566 --> 02:02:36.300
This is Minecraft Earth.

2445
02:02:38.033 --> 02:02:39.100
>> SAXS PERSSON: Let's
start with the basics.

2446
02:02:39.166 --> 02:02:44.533
This is a real living,
breathing Minecraft world

2447
02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.266
right on your tabletop
with red stone circuitry,

2448
02:02:45.333 --> 02:02:48.000
fireworks, flowing water.

2449
02:02:48.066 --> 02:02:51.899
You can break anything,
you can play with your

02:02:48.066 --> 02:02:51.899
You can break anything,
you can play with your

2450
02:02:51.966 --> 02:02:54.733
mobs, and when I look at
Lydia, I can see what tool

2451
02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:57.966
she is holding and I can
see her name and we can

2452
02:02:58.033 --> 02:02:59.966
see anything
she is building.

2453
02:03:00.166 --> 02:03:02.233
>> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm going
to put myself into the build.

2454
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.266
There I am.

2455
02:03:03.833 --> 02:03:04.366
>> SAXS PERSSON: Nice.

>> SAXS PERSSON: Nice.

2456
02:03:04.433 --> 02:03:05.699
Looks just like you.

2457
02:03:05.766 --> 02:03:09.266
Let's use Motion Capture
and make your character wave.

2458
02:03:09.333 --> 02:03:11.933
Try one wave.

2459
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.566
Let's try the trick
of the double wave.

2460
02:03:14.633 --> 02:03:16.000
Cool.

2461
02:03:16.833 --> 02:03:18.466

tabletop, but let's
use the stage.

2463
02:03:30.433 --> 02:03:32.100
Here we go.

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:04.066
people occlusion feature
like you can fit right

2468
02:04:04.133 --> 02:04:05.300
into your Minecraft world.

2469
02:04:05.366 --> 02:04:06.666
That only works on iOS.

2470
02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:22.000
>> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
like hide and seek.

2471
02:04:23.899 --> 02:04:26.899
>> SAXS PERSSON: This is
a fully interactive world

2472
02:04:26.966 --> 02:04:28.433
even at this scale.

2473
02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.633
>> LYDIA WINTERS: There
are some interesting

2474
02:04:29.699 --> 02:04:30.666
levers over here.

2475
02:04:30.733 --> 02:04:32.733
I'm going to press the one
with the feathers on it.

2476
02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.033
>> SAXS PERSSON: All right.

2477
02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:36.866
Watch out for
the chickens.

2478
02:04:36.933 --> 02:04:37.899
>> LYDIA WINTERS:
Chickens.

2479
02:04:37.966 --> 02:04:39.399
>> SAXS PERSSON: I'm going
to put some seeds in my hand.

2480
02:04:39.466 --> 02:04:40.966
They should come rushing over.

2481
02:04:43.333 --> 02:04:46.500
>> LYDIA WINTERS: So cute.

2482
02:04:46.566 --> 02:04:49.966
Hey Saxs, there is
another lever over here.

2482
02:04:46.566 --> 02:04:49.966
Hey Saxs, there is
another lever over here.

2483
02:04:50.033 --> 02:04:51.466
It has TNT on it.

2484
02:04:51.533 --> 02:04:52.933
I'm definitely
going to pull it.

2485
02:04:54.466 --> 02:04:55.399
>> SAXS PERSSON:
Watch out.

2486
02:04:56.566 --> 02:05:00.199
>> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm
right on the edge.

2487
02:05:00.266 --> 02:05:01.666
Skeletons.

2487
02:05:00.266 --> 02:05:01.666
Skeletons.

2488
02:05:02.833 --> 02:05:03.633
>> SAXS PERSSON:
All right, Lydia.

2489
02:05:03.699 --> 02:05:05.000
Can I help you out
with the skeletons?

2490
02:05:05.233 --> 02:05:06.100
>> LYDIA WINTERS:
Thank you.

2491
02:05:07.033 --> 02:05:08.600
>> SAXS PERSSON: Uh
oh, chicken, sorry.

2492
02:05:09.333 --> 02:05:11.066
>> LYDIA WINTERS: Oh no.

2493
02:05:11.133 --> 02:05:12.466
Skeletons only.

2494
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.300
>> SAXS PERSSON:
I'm trying.

2495
02:05:16.366 --> 02:05:17.333
All right.

2496
02:05:17.399 --> 02:05:19.199
That's a huge cave
underneath you we can light up.

2497
02:05:20.833 --> 02:05:22.100
>> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
hard to believe that there

2498
02:05:22.166 --> 02:05:24.033
is nothing on the ground
or around us on the stage.

2499
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.066
It's incredibly immersive.

2499
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.066
It's incredibly immersive.

2500
02:05:27.266 --> 02:05:29.666
The fun, quirkiness and
surprises of Minecraft are

2501
02:05:29.733 --> 02:05:32.466
all around to discover.

2502
02:05:32.533 --> 02:05:33.933
Oh, no, Saxs, a creeper.

2503
02:05:35.933 --> 02:05:39.600
(Applause)

2504
02:05:50.199 --> 02:05:52.066
It's always a creeper.

2505
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:57.066
Minecraft takes on its
biggest dimension yet, earth.

2506
02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:59.600
Unleash your creativity,
build with friends and

2507
02:05:59.666 --> 02:06:02.300
turn the real world
into your playground.

2508
02:06:02.899 --> 02:06:05.133
>> SAXS PERSSON: Go to
Minecraft dot net to learn

2509
02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:08.166
more and sign up for your chance to play on iOS this summer.

2509
02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:08.166
more and sign up for your chance to play on iOS this summer.

2510
02:06:08.233 --> 02:06:09.866
>> LYDIA WINTERS: We can't
wait to see what you do in

2511
02:06:09.933 --> 02:06:11.300
Minecraft Earth.

2512
02:06:11.366 --> 02:06:12.100
Thanks, everyone.

2513
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:13.000
>> SAXS PERSSON:
Thank you.

2514
02:06:13.166 --> 02:06:15.300
(Applause)

2515
02:06:17.399 --> 02:06:19.233
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Isn't that great?

2515
02:06:17.399 --> 02:06:19.233
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Isn't that great?

2516
02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.766
Now, just to be clear, no
chickens were harmed on

2517
02:06:21.833 --> 02:06:23.133
the stage at WWDC.

2518
02:06:23.199 --> 02:06:25.666
I know it was very lifelike,
but that was an illusion.

2519
02:06:26.699 --> 02:06:31.699
So, that's ARKit 3, RealityKit and Reality Composer.

2520
02:06:31.766 --> 02:06:34.933
It's a huge year for AR.

2520
02:06:31.766 --> 02:06:34.933
It's a huge year for AR.

2521
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.066
It's also an enormous
year for Swift.

2522
02:06:39.333 --> 02:06:41.233
(Applause)

2523
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:47.466
Now, platform programming
language transitions, they

2523
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:47.466
Now, platform programming
language transitions, they

2524
02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:50.199
only come along
every 20 to 30 years.

2525
02:06:50.266 --> 02:06:53.633
You know, C and Objective
C, those were created in

2526
02:06:53.699 --> 02:06:57.033
the 70s and 80s and Swift
was just launched five

2527
02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.733
years ago and it's
just amazing how strong

2527
02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.733
years ago and it's
just amazing how strong

2528
02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.766
it's been going.

2529
02:07:00.833 --> 02:07:04.399
There are over 450,000
apps on the App Store

2530
02:07:04.466 --> 02:07:07.500
using Swift and
Developers are loving it.

2531
02:07:07.733 --> 02:07:09.266
(Applause)

2532
02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:10.800
Yes.

2533
02:07:10.866 --> 02:07:12.433
Thank you all.

2533
02:07:10.866 --> 02:07:12.433
Thank you all.

2534
02:07:15.666 --> 02:07:17.933
But you know, a new
language enables new

2535
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.966
paradigms and with
it, new frameworks.

2536
02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:24.333
Now, Objective C enabled
AppKit and then UIKit,

2536
02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:24.333
Now, Objective C enabled
AppKit and then UIKit,

2537
02:07:24.399 --> 02:07:26.199
improving developer
productivity by an order

2538
02:07:26.266 --> 02:07:27.899
of magnitude and
ultimately igniting the

2539
02:07:27.966 --> 02:07:29.833
app revolution.

2540
02:07:30.033 --> 02:07:32.366
Now, when we introduce
Swift, the first step was

2541
02:07:32.433 --> 02:07:35.199
to make sure developers
could access these great

2542
02:07:35.266 --> 02:07:37.199
frameworks while taking
advantage of the

2542
02:07:35.266 --> 02:07:37.199
frameworks while taking
advantage of the

2543
02:07:37.266 --> 02:07:40.266
languages, speed, and
expressiveness, but, of

2544
02:07:40.333 --> 02:07:43.633
course, the biggest
gains were yet to come.

2545
02:07:43.899 --> 02:07:47.100
The true step function in
development would only

2546
02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:50.666
come when we engineered a
new framework, built from

2546
02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:50.666
come when we engineered a
new framework, built from

2547
02:07:50.733 --> 02:07:54.300
the ground up to take
advantage of everything

2548
02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:56.300
that Swift had to offer.

2549
02:07:56.366 --> 02:07:59.566
Today we are announcing
that new framework.

2550
02:07:59.633 --> 02:08:02.699
It's called SwiftUI.

2551
02:08:03.033 --> 02:08:05.066
(Applause)

2552
02:08:16.766 --> 02:08:20.500
Now, SwiftUI is built in
Swift for Swift and it

2553
02:08:20.566 --> 02:08:22.466
provides a new paradigm.

2554
02:08:22.533 --> 02:08:25.000
You specify UI with
simple declarations.

2555
02:08:25.066 --> 02:08:27.199
It makes code really
easy to write and really

2556
02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:28.633
easy to understand.

2557
02:08:28.899 --> 02:08:32.899
It's designed to help you build better apps with way less code.

2557
02:08:28.899 --> 02:08:32.899
It's designed to help you build better apps with way less code.

2558
02:08:32.966 --> 02:08:35.833
For instance, let's take
an app like this, a simple list.

2559
02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:37.566
We have all written
one of these.

2560
02:08:37.633 --> 02:08:39.066
It turns out if you want
to write this with support

2561
02:08:39.133 --> 02:08:41.733
for all of the modern
features, you might end up

2562
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.100
writing something
like this in UIKit.

2562
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.100
writing something
like this in UIKit.

2563
02:08:46.166 --> 02:08:48.800
It's actually quite
a bit of code.

2564
02:08:48.866 --> 02:08:51.766
Here is that same
thing in SwiftUI.

2565
02:08:53.533 --> 02:08:54.633
That's it.

2566
02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.800
(Applause)

2566
02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.800
(Applause)

2567
02:08:56.633 --> 02:08:57.600
Just a few lines
of Swift code.

2568
02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:02.933
Yes.

2569
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.933
Now, there is so much
that SwiftUI gives you.

2570
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.033
It frees you to focus on
the functionality in your

2570
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.033
It frees you to focus on
the functionality in your

2571
02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:10.666
apps and we automatically
do new things for you like

2572
02:09:10.733 --> 02:09:14.333
when we add Dark Mode,
your app gets it automatically.

2573
02:09:14.766 --> 02:09:16.966
And of course, the
framework is only part of

2574
02:09:17.033 --> 02:09:19.033
the story because in XCode
there's a new interactive

2575
02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.666
development experience.

2576
02:09:20.733 --> 02:09:22.766
You can think about it
like Playgrounds cranked

2576
02:09:20.733 --> 02:09:22.766
You can think about it
like Playgrounds cranked

2577
02:09:22.833 --> 02:09:25.533
to eleven built for apps.

2578
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.766
Now, to show you SwiftUI
in action, I would like to

2579
02:09:29.833 --> 02:09:33.300
invite Josh Shaffer,
the head of our iOS UI

2580
02:09:33.366 --> 02:09:36.833
frameworks team to the
stage to give you a live demo.

2580
02:09:33.366 --> 02:09:36.833
frameworks team to the
stage to give you a live demo.

2581
02:09:36.899 --> 02:09:37.899
Josh.

2582
02:09:38.066 --> 02:09:41.600
(Applause)

2583
02:09:43.966 --> 02:09:44.566
>> JOSH SHAFFER: All right.

2584
02:09:44.633 --> 02:09:45.899
Thanks, Craig.

2585
02:09:45.966 --> 02:09:49.266
Let me show you how easy it is to get started with SwiftUI.

2585
02:09:45.966 --> 02:09:49.266
Let me show you how easy it is to get started with SwiftUI.

2586
02:09:49.866 --> 02:09:51.533
On the canvas on the
right, you can see my

2587
02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.066
simple hello world app.

2588
02:09:53.133 --> 02:09:54.966
And I can just select the
text on the canvas and

2589
02:09:55.033 --> 02:09:57.000
when I do, XCode
highlights the code in the

2590
02:09:57.066 --> 02:09:58.366
editor on the left.

2591
02:09:58.433 --> 02:10:00.133
Watch what happens
when I edit it.

2591
02:09:58.433 --> 02:10:00.133
Watch what happens
when I edit it.

2592
02:10:00.199 --> 02:10:02.300
The preview updates
immediately.

2593
02:10:02.633 --> 02:10:04.333
(Applause)

2594
02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.466
Now, to get started let's
open our library of views.

2595
02:10:09.533 --> 02:10:11.600
We can see options and
drag one right out and

2596
02:10:11.666 --> 02:10:13.600
drop one right
on the canvas.

2596
02:10:11.666 --> 02:10:13.600
drop one right
on the canvas.

2597
02:10:13.666 --> 02:10:15.633
As soon as I do, the code
for it is added to the

2598
02:10:15.699 --> 02:10:16.966
editor on the left.

2599
02:10:17.466 --> 02:10:20.399
With simple Drag and Drop,
we can get real code

2600
02:10:20.466 --> 02:10:24.600
created instantly, and
built in inspectors let us

2601
02:10:24.666 --> 02:10:27.000
adjust the layout of our
views exactly like you

2601
02:10:24.666 --> 02:10:27.000
adjust the layout of our
views exactly like you

2602
02:10:27.066 --> 02:10:29.033
would in an app
like Keynote.

2603
02:10:30.199 --> 02:10:31.966
The inspectors are
tailored for each type of

2604
02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:34.399
view so you can see the
kind of options that you

2605
02:10:34.466 --> 02:10:37.366
have, and choose exactly
the one that you want.

2606
02:10:37.433 --> 02:10:39.733
And I can use the exact
same tools to edit the

2606
02:10:37.433 --> 02:10:39.733
And I can use the exact
same tools to edit the

2607
02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:41.800
code directly too.

2608
02:10:41.866 --> 02:10:44.633
So, with just one step, we
can take this view we have been

2609
02:10:44.699 --> 02:10:47.500
building and convert it into
a scrollable list of views.

2610
02:10:50.466 --> 02:10:52.699
Now, a list
requires content.

2610
02:10:50.466 --> 02:10:52.699
Now, a list
requires content.

2611
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.100
(Applause)

2612
02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:55.033
Thanks.

2613
02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:56.399
It's really incredible.

2614
02:10:57.133 --> 02:10:57.933
Okay.

2615
02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.333
So, a list requires
content and for that we

2616
02:10:59.399 --> 02:11:01.033
can bring in a model
object that I created

2617
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.666
earlier and start
connecting it up to our views.

2618
02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.699
For the first public app
written with SwiftUI, we

2619
02:11:07.766 --> 02:11:09.233
thought it would be kind
of fun to help our friends

2620
02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.199
in product marketing to
choose the perfect name

2621
02:11:11.266 --> 02:11:13.033
for the next
release of MacOS.

2622
02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:16.399
So, here we have a list of
themes but we need a place

2623
02:11:16.466 --> 02:11:17.933
to display a release name.

2624
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.066
For that, we can drag
in a custom component we

2625
02:11:20.133 --> 02:11:22.800
created earlier and drop
it right at the top.

2626
02:11:22.866 --> 02:11:25.899
Now, even with this little
amount of code, SwiftUI

2627
02:11:25.966 --> 02:11:28.833
already provides default
support for really common

2628
02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:31.333
features like localization
for right to left

2628
02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:31.333
features like localization
for right to left

2629
02:11:31.399 --> 02:11:35.933
languages and, of course,
iOS 13's new Dark Mode.

2630
02:11:36.133 --> 02:11:38.033
(Applause)

2631
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.800
All right.

2631
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.800
All right.

2632
02:11:44.866 --> 02:11:47.033
Now, let's make this
interactive so that when

2633
02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:49.033
we select a row in the
table, we will display a

2634
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.566
name for the theme.

2635
02:11:50.633 --> 02:11:52.633
Now, we are ready to test
it out and with just a

2636
02:11:52.699 --> 02:11:54.966
click, we can go from
designing our app to

2637
02:11:55.033 --> 02:11:57.333
interacting with
it, right in XCode.

2637
02:11:55.033 --> 02:11:57.333
interacting with
it, right in XCode.

2638
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.233
Now, testing within XCode
is incredible, but I want

2639
02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.266
to try it on a device too,
so with just one more

2640
02:12:04.333 --> 02:12:06.966
click we can now install
it on our phone and be

2641
02:12:07.033 --> 02:12:09.066
ready to try it out there.

2642
02:12:09.133 --> 02:12:12.933
So, let's try farms
or maybe food.

2642
02:12:09.133 --> 02:12:12.933
So, let's try farms
or maybe food.

2643
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.233
That's great but what's
really incredible about this

2644
02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:18.533
is that we can start to edit
it live right on the device.

2645
02:12:19.833 --> 02:12:21.633
So, SwiftUI includes
built in support for

2646
02:12:21.699 --> 02:12:23.266
animated transitions.

2646
02:12:21.699 --> 02:12:23.266
animated transitions.

2647
02:12:23.333 --> 02:12:25.733
So, let's see some options
and pick a cool one for the top.

2648
02:12:26.633 --> 02:12:28.033
Now, this time when we
choose a name it is going

2649
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:29.266
to animate in.

2650
02:12:29.333 --> 02:12:32.533
So, let's say deserts
or maybe beaches.

2651
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.800
That's better, but we
all know that product

2652
02:12:35.866 --> 02:12:39.100
marketing chooses these
names randomly, so to get

2652
02:12:35.866 --> 02:12:39.100
marketing chooses these
names randomly, so to get

2653
02:12:39.166 --> 02:12:41.233
a feel that matches that
reality, let's wrap our

2654
02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:43.633
banner in a custom
randomizer component that

2655
02:12:43.699 --> 02:12:46.066
I built earlier to help us
pick a name and now we are

2656
02:12:46.133 --> 02:12:48.933
ready to choose the
next name for macOS.

2657
02:12:50.666 --> 02:12:51.500
That one is not great.

2658
02:12:51.566 --> 02:12:52.566
Let's try one more.

2659
02:12:52.633 --> 02:12:54.366
Cute animals
seems promising.

2660
02:12:54.433 --> 02:12:56.466
Well, that one is perfect.

2661
02:12:56.533 --> 02:12:57.566
All right.

2662
02:12:57.633 --> 02:12:59.766
So, because SwiftUI
includes built in support

2663
02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:02.166
for integrating with
other Apple frameworks, I

2663
02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:02.166
for integrating with
other Apple frameworks, I

2664
02:13:02.233 --> 02:13:03.833
thought it would be fun
to use the new RealityKit

2665
02:13:03.899 --> 02:13:06.566
framework to envision
the release of MacOS 10,

2666
02:13:06.633 --> 02:13:08.866
Flying Squirrel.

2667
02:13:08.933 --> 02:13:11.766
It looks like it's
going to be amazing.

2668
02:13:11.833 --> 02:13:13.800
That's a Quick Look at
building user interfaces

2669
02:13:13.866 --> 02:13:16.333
with SwiftUI and
XCode previews.

2669
02:13:13.866 --> 02:13:16.333
with SwiftUI and
XCode previews.

2670
02:13:16.399 --> 02:13:18.300
You are going to love it.

2671
02:13:18.666 --> 02:13:21.066
(Applause)

2672
02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:26.300
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
What do you think?

2673
02:13:26.533 --> 02:13:29.000
(Applause)

2673
02:13:26.533 --> 02:13:29.000
(Applause)

2674
02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:38.433
Now, I'm sure that many of
you are really excited to

2675
02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.133
adopt SwiftUI in your apps
and the good news is you

2675
02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.133
adopt SwiftUI in your apps
and the good news is you

2676
02:13:41.199 --> 02:13:43.899
can do it starting with a
single view all the way up

2677
02:13:43.966 --> 02:13:45.966
to a whole application.

2678
02:13:46.033 --> 02:13:49.300
And this isn't just
for building iOS apps.

2679
02:13:49.366 --> 02:13:51.433
For the first time ever,
we now have a native

2680
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.166
framework for building
Watch apps as well.

2680
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.166
framework for building
Watch apps as well.

2681
02:13:54.733 --> 02:13:56.733
(Applause)

2682
02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:02.433
But not just that.

2683
02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:05.066
SwiftUI is available
across all of our

2684
02:14:05.133 --> 02:14:07.933
platforms and it provides
bindings to all of the

2684
02:14:05.133 --> 02:14:07.933
platforms and it provides
bindings to all of the

2685
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.100
native controls so you can
customize your experiences

2686
02:14:12.166 --> 02:14:14.733
specifically for each, all
while using a common API.

2687
02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:16.466
It's incredibly powerful.

2688
02:14:17.366 --> 02:14:19.633
Now, that's just some
of our big news for

2689
02:14:19.699 --> 02:14:21.300
developers this morning.

2689
02:14:19.699 --> 02:14:21.300
developers this morning.

2690
02:14:21.366 --> 02:14:23.500
I want to thank you all
for spending the time with me.

2691
02:14:23.833 --> 02:14:24.733
You are so awesome.

2692
02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:25.666
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

2693
02:14:25.733 --> 02:14:26.600
Thank you.

2694
02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.433
(Applause)

2695
02:14:33.466 --> 02:14:36.466
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig.

2696
02:14:36.533 --> 02:14:38.533
What an incredible morning.

2697
02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:39.233
Have you enjoyed it?

2698
02:14:40.466 --> 02:14:40.800
(Applause)

2699
02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:43.533
Yeah.

2700
02:14:43.533 --> 02:14:47.300
Today - today we moved all
of our software platforms

2700
02:14:43.533 --> 02:14:47.300
Today - today we moved all
of our software platforms

2701
02:14:47.366 --> 02:14:49.899
forward, providing
customers new ways to

2702
02:14:49.966 --> 02:14:52.766
enrich their lives
and powerful tools to

2703
02:14:52.833 --> 02:14:56.199
developers so they can
continue to change the world.

2704
02:14:56.266 --> 02:15:00.566
All of the platforms will
be available as a beta today.

2704
02:14:56.266 --> 02:15:00.566
All of the platforms will
be available as a beta today.

2705
02:15:01.266 --> 02:15:02.966
(Applause)

2706
02:15:04.233 --> 02:15:08.399
And the public seed for
macOS, iOS and iPad iOS

2707
02:15:08.466 --> 02:15:12.199
will be available in July,
and, of course, all of

2707
02:15:08.466 --> 02:15:12.199
will be available in July,
and, of course, all of

2708
02:15:12.266 --> 02:15:14.933
this great software will
be available to our users

2709
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.466
in the fall.

2710
02:15:16.933 --> 02:15:19.333
(Applause)

2711
02:15:19.733 --> 02:15:24.500
Now, you will also be able
to get an early look at

2712
02:15:24.566 --> 02:15:28.933
the new MacPro and the Pro
Display XDR in our Pro

2712
02:15:24.566 --> 02:15:28.933
the new MacPro and the Pro
Display XDR in our Pro

2713
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.133
Studio just
across the street.

2714
02:15:31.199 --> 02:15:32.733
I encourage
you to do that.

2715
02:15:33.833 --> 02:15:36.433
We have a huge week
planned for you guys, with

2716
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.466
more than one hundred
sessions, more than two

2716
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.466
more than one hundred
sessions, more than two

2717
02:15:38.533 --> 02:15:42.066
hundred hands on labs,
and over a thousand Apple

2718
02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:45.166
engineers that are
here to help you.

2719
02:15:45.233 --> 02:15:46.500
So, seek them out.

2720
02:15:47.166 --> 02:15:49.000
We can't wait to see what
you guys are going to

2721
02:15:49.066 --> 02:15:51.266
dream up and how you are
going to continue to

2721
02:15:49.066 --> 02:15:51.266
dream up and how you are
going to continue to

2722
02:15:51.333 --> 02:15:52.500
change the world.

2723
02:15:53.333 --> 02:15:55.933
Now, before I close this
morning, I would like to

2724
02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.366
thank everyone that worked
so hard at Apple on all of

2725
02:16:01.433 --> 02:16:03.866
the products that
you saw this morning.

2726
02:16:03.933 --> 02:16:07.166
These guys have given up
their nights and weekends

2726
02:16:03.933 --> 02:16:07.166
These guys have given up
their nights and weekends

2727
02:16:07.233 --> 02:16:10.133
from their families and so
on and so forth, and many

2728
02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:13.899
of these innovations are
years in the making.

2729
02:16:13.966 --> 02:16:14.600
So, thank you.

2730
02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:16.166
Let's give them a
round of applause.

2731
02:16:16.366 --> 02:16:17.633
(Applause)

2731
02:16:16.366 --> 02:16:17.633
(Applause)

2732
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.433
Yes.

2733
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.398
Thank you all for coming
and sharing the time with us.

2734
02:16:36.032 --> 02:16:37.799
Have a great week.

2735
02:16:37.866 --> 02:16:39.066
Thank you.

2736
02:16:39.966 --> 02:16:43.500
(Applause)

2736
02:16:39.966 --> 02:16:43.500
(Applause)

2737
02:16:50.333 --> 02:16:54.266
(Music playing)
