[ Music ]

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:09.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.886 A:middle
I'm Giovanni Tarducci, from the

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.316 A:middle
System UI SpringBoard team.

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:13.966 A:middle
And today, I'm happy to tell you

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.246 A:middle
everything about managing your

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.746 A:middle
windows on iPadOS.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:19.406 A:middle
We are introducing three new

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:21.006 A:middle
API's, to do just that.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:22.596 A:middle
To respectively activate,

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.926 A:middle
refresh, or destroy any of your

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:25.646 A:middle
scene sessions.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:28.216 A:middle
But let's jump right into a demo

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:29.846 A:middle
of these API's at work, in an

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:30.956 A:middle
app we've been prototyping.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:42.086 A:middle
Okay. We call it Clown Town.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:43.876 A:middle
And it's a great new way to get

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.056 A:middle
a clown for your party.

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:47.456 A:middle
It opens to a full-screen map,

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.946 A:middle
showing all the clowns in my

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:49.456 A:middle
network.

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:51.346 A:middle
I can tap on any of their

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:53.206 A:middle
markers, to see more about them.

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.336 A:middle
The implementation is straight

00:00:56.336 --> 00:00:57.386 A:middle
forward, as well.

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.146 A:middle
The detail view controller just

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.606 A:middle
knows how to show a clown with a

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.606 A:middle
knows how to show a clown with a

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:01.336 A:middle
given ID.

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:03.206 A:middle
While the map view controller,

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:04.506 A:middle
delegates everything,

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.426 A:middle
presentation, animation and

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:07.706 A:middle
gestures to UIKit.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.186 A:middle
Through the presentviewcontroller

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:10.636 A:middle
animated API.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:12.426 A:middle
Well, with the enhancement to

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.876 A:middle
multitasking, we can push this

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:16.316 A:middle
delegation model to the next

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:16.586 A:middle
level.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.656 A:middle
And gain powerful new features

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:19.106 A:middle
for free.

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:20.936 A:middle
Taxes may apply at checkout.

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:23.886 A:middle
So, we did start by adding an

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:25.556 A:middle
"open in new window" button in

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:26.216 A:middle
the data view.

00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:29.126 A:middle
So, that all our users are going

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
to be able to discover this

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.106 A:middle
great new feature.

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:33.976 A:middle
When tapped, we call new request

00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:36.716 A:middle
scene session activation API, to

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:38.666 A:middle
open this clown in an auxiliary

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:39.616 A:middle
dedicated window.

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:41.686 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.546 A:middle
Already, I can keep browsing my

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:44.926 A:middle
map and checking out and

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:46.146 A:middle
comparing other clowns.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:48.606 A:middle
But not only that, we can now

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:50.466 A:middle
have the whole system working

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:51.026 A:middle
for us.

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:54.156 A:middle
We can resize the windows, move

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:54.776 A:middle
them around.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.646 A:middle
Keep opening new windows.

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.416 A:middle
And the one I had on my side, is

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
now in its own space in the

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
now in its own space in the

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:00.906 A:middle
switcher.

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:03.396 A:middle
Now, I can make this one a slide

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:06.216 A:middle
over, move it around, stash it.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:09.306 A:middle
And maybe opening another couple

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:13.876 A:middle
details, Crusty and a last one,

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.536 A:middle
Mr. Happy here.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.816 A:middle
Okay, so, with the swipe app, I

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.526 A:middle
can check out my whole stack of

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:23.276 A:middle
slide overs.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:25.466 A:middle
And I can even quickly swipe

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:26.676 A:middle
through them all, just like

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:26.896 A:middle
that.

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:28.886 A:middle
I can even go back from being a

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:30.216 A:middle
slide over, to being next to the

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:30.766 A:middle
map again.

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:32.486 A:middle
Now, let's pause for a second.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.346 A:middle
We did achieve all of these,

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.606 A:middle
again, by delegating,

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:37.296 A:middle
presentation, animation and

00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:38.816 A:middle
more, to the system.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.756 A:middle
So far, through the single

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.546 A:middle
request scene session activation

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:43.786 A:middle
API.

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.856 A:middle
Now, I only now noticed that Mr.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.396 A:middle
Happy here has got a one-star

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:47.706 A:middle
rating.

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:49.716 A:middle
Probably not a good clown.

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:51.506 A:middle
So, let's get rid of him and his

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.516 A:middle
window, through new request

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:55.326 A:middle
scene session destruction API,

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:56.896 A:middle
which I'm calling for the upper

00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:58.116 A:middle
right down button here.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:02:58.976 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:00.896 A:middle
And he's gone for good.

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:00.896 A:middle
And he's gone for good.

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.506 A:middle
Now, I remembered the one I had

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:03.896 A:middle
in my switcher, had a five-star

00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:04.176 A:middle
rating.

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:06.236 A:middle
So, let me open her again.

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.136 A:middle
Notice how she wasn't

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:09.856 A:middle
duplicated.

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:11.496 A:middle
This is Clown Town policy.

00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:13.406 A:middle
And it's easily enforced, just

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.056 A:middle
by asking the request session

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.836 A:middle
activation API to activate and

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:18.166 A:middle
existing session instead of a

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:18.526 A:middle
new one.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:21.516 A:middle
I can even track her

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:22.156 A:middle
availability.

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:23.726 A:middle
She was checked and found

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.056 A:middle
available, as I can tell from

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.456 A:middle
the green navigation bar.

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:29.136 A:middle
Also, an instant book button did

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.556 A:middle
appear on the left side.

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.336 A:middle
If her availability were to

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:34.586 A:middle
change, I will get a

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:35.446 A:middle
notification.

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:36.956 A:middle
I will update this UI to have

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:38.656 A:middle
the navigation bar now in red.

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:41.216 A:middle
And I will call the new request

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:43.706 A:middle
scene session refresh API, to

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:46.056 A:middle
update, beside other things, the

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
snapshot of this UI, for it to

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
be represented in the switchers.

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:52.336 A:middle
But I did not decide yet.

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:54.996 A:middle
So, let us instead start

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:57.266 A:middle
tracking them all, just like

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:57.586 A:middle
this.

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
Say now that I do background the

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
Say now that I do background the

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:01.986 A:middle
app, to do something else.

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:03.486 A:middle
Maybe recommend this app to my

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:03.946 A:middle
friends.

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:06.016 A:middle
And show the current collection

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:06.636 A:middle
I have right now.

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.276 A:middle
But I'm getting notifications

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:09.586 A:middle
already.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.196 A:middle
A bunch of them are no longer

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:11.606 A:middle
available.

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:13.286 A:middle
I cannot recall their names.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.356 A:middle
So, let me instead use app

00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:17.216 A:middle
expose, to glance at all my

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.106 A:middle
windows at once.

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:19.476 A:middle
And there we go.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.346 A:middle
Their snapshots were updated,

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.186 A:middle
which is great.

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:23.696 A:middle
Because I can manage my window

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:24.786 A:middle
right here and there.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.586 A:middle
A couple of swipe ups and I'm

00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:27.696 A:middle
done.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:28.956 A:middle
Looks like these clowns are

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:29.776 A:middle
running out fast.

00:04:29.846 --> 00:04:31.606 A:middle
So, let me go ahead and book the

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:33.366 A:middle
great BuBu LuBu, so we can go

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.466 A:middle
back to our party.

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:38.816 A:middle
Oops, see you later Clown Town.

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:40.456 A:middle
Okay, so...

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:42.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:42.746 A:middle
Thank you.

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.111 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:46.296 A:middle
So, let's check out the API's,

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:47.996 A:middle
activating a session.

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:50.736 A:middle
First of all, you activate a

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:52.336 A:middle
session only in response to

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:53.756 A:middle
direct and local user

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:54.336 A:middle
interaction.

00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:56.876 A:middle
The user has to touch the screen

00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:59.976 A:middle
for it to happen.

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.106 A:middle
And you do so by calling the new

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.106 A:middle
And you do so by calling the new

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:02.656 A:middle
request scene session activation

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:04.466 A:middle
API on UI application.

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:06.216 A:middle
To either activate an existing

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:07.326 A:middle
session or a new one.

00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:10.336 A:middle
Now, in Clown Town, when we

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:12.026 A:middle
first launched, UIApplication

00:05:12.026 --> 00:05:14.186 A:middle
had just one open session.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:15.666 A:middle
The one with our map

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
configuration.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:19.916 A:middle
All in just window, displaying

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:21.006 A:middle
our whole view hierarchy.

00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:23.656 A:middle
When the open a new window

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
button was pressed, through

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:26.706 A:middle
delegation, the detail view

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:28.246 A:middle
controller gets to the map view

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.526 A:middle
controller, which is presenting

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:29.646 A:middle
it.

00:05:30.336 --> 00:05:31.776 A:middle
And the map view controller

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:33.716 A:middle
calls this method that we added

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:35.186 A:middle
on our application delegate.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.406 A:middle
Here, since we have the no

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:40.036 A:middle
duplicate policy, we check for

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.906 A:middle
any existing session for this

00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:42.486 A:middle
given clown.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.376 A:middle
Now, on first launch, we won't

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:44.886 A:middle
find any.

00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:45.946 A:middle
So, we're going to end up

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.616 A:middle
passing nil here, at runtime.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.386 A:middle
Pass nil here, to this

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:51.506 A:middle
parameter, requests a brand-new

00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:53.126 A:middle
scene session to be created.

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:55.856 A:middle
We then create a userActivity

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:56.576 A:middle
for this clown.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:58.336 A:middle
And the userActivity is going to

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.866 A:middle
be given back to us by UIKit,

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.866 A:middle
be given back to us by UIKit,

00:06:01.566 --> 00:06:03.666 A:middle
later on along the delegate

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:04.656 A:middle
chain, as we'll see.

00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:07.356 A:middle
The options objects, let's me

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:08.776 A:middle
specify a requesting scene,

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:10.936 A:middle
which is meant to be the one

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:12.526 A:middle
where this request was user

00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:13.256 A:middle
initiated.

00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:15.596 A:middle
The system uses this information

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:17.276 A:middle
to avoid replacing the

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:18.856 A:middle
requestingScene with the

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:19.686 A:middle
activated one.

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:21.416 A:middle
And for other navigation

00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:21.896 A:middle
purposes.

00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:23.906 A:middle
We can now call the API.

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:26.276 A:middle
The new window is shown.

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.046 A:middle
And alongside, a new session

00:06:28.046 --> 00:06:29.336 A:middle
hierarchy has been created.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.616 A:middle
As I mentioned, there are two

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.116 A:middle
key delicate methods you

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:35.636 A:middle
definitely want to implement, in

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:37.516 A:middle
order for your app to have a say

00:06:37.516 --> 00:06:39.286 A:middle
in what actually gets created.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
And how it gets configured.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.826 A:middle
So, let's step back and go back

00:06:43.826 --> 00:06:45.376 A:middle
to when we called the API.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:49.536 A:middle
As soon as we do so, UIKit

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:51.026 A:middle
creates a brand-new scene

00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:51.386 A:middle
session.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:53.126 A:middle
And let's you specify a

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.846 A:middle
configuration for it, by calling

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:56.466 A:middle
configuration for connecting

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:57.896 A:middle
scene session on your app

00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:58.456 A:middle
delegate.

00:06:58.766 --> 00:06:59.836 A:middle
You definitely want to implement

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
this one.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
this one.

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.296 A:middle
And here, you can inspect the

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.156 A:middle
user activity.

00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:05.136 A:middle
Which is given back to you now

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:06.486 A:middle
through the UI scene connecting

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.756 A:middle
options, to pick a session.

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:12.586 A:middle
In my case, it's the detail

00:07:12.726 --> 00:07:13.376 A:middle
configuration.

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:15.706 A:middle
Now, if your configuration

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:17.556 A:middle
specifies a storyboard, as I do

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:18.036 A:middle
recommend.

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:19.916 A:middle
At this point, UIKit is able to

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:21.086 A:middle
go ahead and create the whole

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:21.646 A:middle
view hierarchy.

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:23.386 A:middle
And you just need to configure

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:23.976 A:middle
that.

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.556 A:middle
You do so by implementing

00:07:25.556 --> 00:07:27.186 A:middle
scenewillConnectToSession on

00:07:27.186 --> 00:07:28.026 A:middle
your scene delegate.

00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:30.006 A:middle
In there again, you'll be able

00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:31.476 A:middle
to find your user activity and

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:32.416 A:middle
the connecting options.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.416 A:middle
And you configure your window

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:35.646 A:middle
and view controller hierarchy

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:36.726 A:middle
for it.

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
Now, that was a new session.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.606 A:middle
What about an existing session?

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:44.516 A:middle
If the session is still is

00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:46.306 A:middle
existing, we go straight to the

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:47.046 A:middle
scene delegate.

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:49.016 A:middle
And if the session had been

00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:50.866 A:middle
disconnected in the meantime, we

00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:52.506 A:middle
call sceneWillConnectToSession.

00:07:53.576 --> 00:07:54.946 A:middle
But if the scene is still

00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:56.616 A:middle
connected, we'll just go to the

00:07:56.616 --> 00:07:58.286 A:middle
continueUserActivity one.

00:07:58.416 --> 00:08:00.436 A:middle
You definitely want to implement

00:07:58.416 --> 00:08:00.436 A:middle
You definitely want to implement

00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:00.636 A:middle
those.

00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:03.456 A:middle
To recap, you activate a

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:04.886 A:middle
session, only in response to

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:06.286 A:middle
direct user request.

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.726 A:middle
To either activate a new or

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:09.616 A:middle
existing session.

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:12.516 A:middle
And you want to implement your

00:08:12.516 --> 00:08:14.156 A:middle
app and scene delegates methods,

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.116 A:middle
to be able to configure both

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.296 A:middle
session and the window for the

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:20.856 A:middle
activity at hand.

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.676 A:middle
Now, onto refreshing a session.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.266 A:middle
You refresh for user-relevant

00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:26.436 A:middle
updates from your app.

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:28.306 A:middle
A couple of examples.

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.966 A:middle
It could be that you have

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.256 A:middle
multiple windows showing and

00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:34.346 A:middle
working on the same assets.

00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:36.106 A:middle
And the user may have modified

00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:38.436 A:middle
them from a window or even

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:39.306 A:middle
another device.

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:40.446 A:middle
And now you want to keep them in

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
sync.

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:41.916 A:middle
You want to have their

00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:43.525 A:middle
presentation being updated in

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:45.116 A:middle
these features and more.

00:08:45.876 --> 00:08:47.906 A:middle
Or you just fetched new data and

00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:49.646 A:middle
it is available for the user to

00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:50.126 A:middle
be seen.

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:52.286 A:middle
Or you want to update some scene

00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:53.746 A:middle
and session metadata, as we'll

00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:53.976 A:middle
see.

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
You do so by calling at any

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:57.706 A:middle
time, the

00:08:57.706 --> 00:08:59.856 A:middle
requestSceneSessionRefresh API

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:01.196 A:middle
on UIApplication.

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:04.576 A:middle
By just passing in the session you

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:05.866 A:middle
wish to be refreshed.

00:09:07.716 --> 00:09:10.126 A:middle
Now, what is it actually that

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:12.056 A:middle
this API affords you to update?

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:14.776 A:middle
You can update the state

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:16.436 A:middle
restoration user activity for

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:16.996 A:middle
the session.

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:18.676 A:middle
You can update the scene

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.046 A:middle
activation conditions.

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:23.116 A:middle
And your UI, which is eventually

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:24.396 A:middle
going to be captured in a

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:25.256 A:middle
snapshot, again.

00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:28.416 A:middle
As we saw in Clown Town, thanks

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:30.256 A:middle
to those updated snapshots, the

00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:31.866 A:middle
app felt alive in the switcher.

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:33.956 A:middle
And we were able to confidently

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:35.166 A:middle
act on the incoming data.

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:37.396 A:middle
Without having to navigate to

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:39.016 A:middle
each and every session, just to

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:40.796 A:middle
find out, once connected and

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:42.206 A:middle
updated, that we didn't even

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:42.886 A:middle
want them anymore.

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:47.426 A:middle
On an architectural note, you

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:48.996 A:middle
want to listen for rare model

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:50.226 A:middle
changes for which you want to

00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:50.956 A:middle
call the API.

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:52.886 A:middle
Both in the interested view

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:54.676 A:middle
controller, as well as in a

00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:55.576 A:middle
long-lived object.

00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:58.296 A:middle
Because if the scene is still

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.676 A:middle
connected, either in the

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.676 A:middle
connected, either in the

00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:01.856 A:middle
foreground or the background, it

00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:03.666 A:middle
can listen to the notification

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:03.976 A:middle
itself.

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:05.736 A:middle
And call the API, which is going

00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:07.306 A:middle
to do the right thing

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:07.936 A:middle
internally.

00:10:08.966 --> 00:10:10.946 A:middle
If the scene has been

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:12.246 A:middle
disconnected though, the view

00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:13.336 A:middle
controller won't be there

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:13.646 A:middle
anymore.

00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:15.666 A:middle
And so, the long-lived object

00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:17.946 A:middle
can step in, figure that out and

00:10:17.946 --> 00:10:19.956 A:middle
call to refresh API in its

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:20.396 A:middle
place.

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:22.646 A:middle
The scene is going then to be

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:23.636 A:middle
background connected.

00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:25.336 A:middle
And the view controller will

00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:27.016 A:middle
have a chance to update itself.

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:29.076 A:middle
And the snapshot will be

00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:29.476 A:middle
captured.

00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:33.196 A:middle
As a summary, you want to

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:34.896 A:middle
refresh for user relevant

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:36.006 A:middle
updates from your app.

00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:39.346 A:middle
Make your layout time fast, so

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:40.716 A:middle
that we can quickly capture the

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:41.216 A:middle
snapshot.

00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.956 A:middle
And do not rely on it being

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:45.136 A:middle
executed immediately.

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:46.736 A:middle
The system reserves the ability

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:48.296 A:middle
to fulfill this request at a

00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:49.376 A:middle
later point in time, if

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:49.906 A:middle
necessary.

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:53.526 A:middle
Now, destroying a session, also

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:55.456 A:middle
known as going away with style.

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.886 A:middle
You destroy a session for direct

00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:00.856 A:middle
user request.

00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:02.646 A:middle
Or if you have a window, which

00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:04.606 A:middle
is an auxiliary window dedicated

00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:05.916 A:middle
to show a piece of data, an

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.696 A:middle
item, that the user already

00:11:07.696 --> 00:11:09.146 A:middle
deleted from somewhere else.

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:10.876 A:middle
Another window or even another

00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:11.386 A:middle
device.

00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
You do so by calling, at any

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:15.386 A:middle
time, the

00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:17.036 A:middle
requestSceneSessionDestruction

00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:18.476 A:middle
API, on UIApplication.

00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:20.216 A:middle
Which takes in the session you

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:21.106 A:middle
wish to be destroyed.

00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:23.646 A:middle
As well as an options object.

00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:26.516 A:middle
This option lets you specify a

00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:27.606 A:middle
DismissalAnimation.

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:29.776 A:middle
Which the system is going to

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:32.086 A:middle
take into account, if the scene

00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:33.756 A:middle
happens to be foreground at that

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:34.086 A:middle
moment.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:36.626 A:middle
Now, let me be clear, the

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.726 A:middle
session is going to go away and

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:39.556 A:middle
won't come back.

00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:41.946 A:middle
But the animation lets you

00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:44.006 A:middle
acknowledge the user's intent in

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:44.666 A:middle
getting rid of it.

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:46.776 A:middle
So, which one to pick, then?

00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:49.026 A:middle
The main draft is a great

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:49.536 A:middle
paradigm.

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.826 A:middle
When the main draft is

00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:53.356 A:middle
cancelled, without saving, the

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.556 A:middle
user is explicitly asking for

00:11:55.556 --> 00:11:56.706 A:middle
its content to be destroyed.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:58.336 A:middle
Which is the common case, when

00:11:58.386 --> 00:11:59.626 A:middle
getting rid of a window, as we

00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:00.356 A:middle
saw in Clown Town.

00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:00.356 A:middle
saw in Clown Town.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:02.626 A:middle
You pick the standard animation,

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:05.236 A:middle
in these cases, to acknowledge

00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:05.966 A:middle
this intent.

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:09.796 A:middle
When to draft the assent, the

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.646 A:middle
user is not asking for his

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:12.576 A:middle
content to be destroyed.

00:12:13.276 --> 00:12:14.416 A:middle
The session though, will be

00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:15.866 A:middle
destroyed as a side effect of

00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:17.716 A:middle
the user accepting the final

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.096 A:middle
purpose of the session.

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.256 A:middle
Which, in the mail case, is

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:22.126 A:middle
sending the e-mail.

00:12:22.506 --> 00:12:23.816 A:middle
In the Clown Town case, was

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:25.296 A:middle
booking the clown, if you are in

00:12:25.296 --> 00:12:25.866 A:middle
tracking mode.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:28.426 A:middle
You pick commit to acknowledge

00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:29.886 A:middle
that the final purpose of the

00:12:29.886 --> 00:12:32.316 A:middle
session has been approved by the

00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:32.686 A:middle
user.

00:12:34.126 --> 00:12:36.996 A:middle
Now, when the draft is cancelled

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:39.866 A:middle
and saved, the user again, is

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:41.396 A:middle
not asking for his content to be

00:12:41.396 --> 00:12:41.806 A:middle
destroyed.

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:43.466 A:middle
The session though, will be

00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:45.036 A:middle
destroyed as a side effect of

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:47.096 A:middle
the user declining from taking

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:48.206 A:middle
action right now.

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:50.086 A:middle
You pick decline, in these

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:51.506 A:middle
cases, to acknowledge that the

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:53.516 A:middle
final purpose of the session has

00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:55.106 A:middle
not been fulfilled yet.

00:12:58.436 --> 00:13:01.166 A:middle
To recap, you destroy a session

00:12:58.436 --> 00:13:01.166 A:middle
To recap, you destroy a session

00:13:01.256 --> 00:13:02.736 A:middle
in response to user request.

00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:04.476 A:middle
Either locally or remotely.

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:06.136 A:middle
And you pick the animation style

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.986 A:middle
to best acknowledge the user's

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:10.166 A:middle
intent in getting rid of it.

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:12.846 A:middle
To recap, we've seen how through

00:13:12.846 --> 00:13:14.846 A:middle
these new API's, you can empower

00:13:14.936 --> 00:13:16.096 A:middle
your user's actions.

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.966 A:middle
And you can delegate complexity

00:13:19.016 --> 00:13:20.396 A:middle
to the system, while gaining

00:13:20.476 --> 00:13:22.616 A:middle
powerful new features, easily

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.586 A:middle
discoverable by all your users.

00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:24.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:27.508 A:middle
