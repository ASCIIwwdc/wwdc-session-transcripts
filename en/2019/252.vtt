[ Music ]

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:09.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Tom from the Car

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.586 A:middle
Experience Team at Apple and

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:12.166 A:middle
welcome to our talk on Advances

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.246 A:middle
in CarPlay Systems.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:16.656 A:middle
As you know, CarPlay is the

00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:18.636 A:middle
smarter, safer way to use your

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.766 A:middle
iPhone in the car.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.716 A:middle
iOS 13 has a ton of new updates

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.576 A:middle
to CarPlay including the all-new

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:26.326 A:middle
CarPlay Dashboard for a simple

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.746 A:middle
view of your tunes, turns and

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.186 A:middle
Smart Siri suggestions.

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:32.235 A:middle
In this session we will

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.436 A:middle
introduce you to vehicle

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:34.826 A:middle
integration features newly

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.546 A:middle
available in iOS 13.

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:38.746 A:middle
All of the features we will talk

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.096 A:middle
about today will require the

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:42.006 A:middle
vehicle system to adopt new APIs

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.456 A:middle
available in the CarPlay

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
Communication plug-in R15.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.926 A:middle
Today we will introduce new

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:50.696 A:middle
display and audio features in

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:51.856 A:middle
CarPlay that you can take

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.566 A:middle
advantage of in future vehicles.

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:56.956 A:middle
First up, let's look at how

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.406 A:middle
CarPlay supports irregularly

00:00:58.406 --> 00:00:59.406 A:middle
shaped displays.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:01.866 A:middle
The vehicle declares the

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.786 A:middle
physical size and resolution of

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:04.786 A:middle
the display and iPhone will

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:07.416 A:middle
setup an H.264 video stream of

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:08.836 A:middle
that size which will be rendered

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:09.456 A:middle
to the display.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.606 A:middle
Prior to iOS 13, the CarPlay UI

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.566 A:middle
would be drawn up to each edge

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.526 A:middle
of the video screen.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
However, some car displays are

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:19.976 A:middle
fitted with pieces of trim that

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.636 A:middle
may obscure parts of the CarPlay

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.566 A:middle
user interface, restricting

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.776 A:middle
access to some touchable

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:26.506 A:middle
controls and preventing the user

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:27.926 A:middle
from being able to see certain

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:28.876 A:middle
parts of the UI.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.296 A:middle
With iOS 13, CarPlay now

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:33.826 A:middle
supports irregularly shaped

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:34.496 A:middle
displays.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:36.556 A:middle
First, your system defines a

00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:37.186 A:middle
view area.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.246 A:middle
This represents the rectangle

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:40.886 A:middle
that CarPlay can draw a user

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:42.156 A:middle
interface image into.

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:45.646 A:middle
A view area can also contain a

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:46.326 A:middle
safe area.

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:48.796 A:middle
The safe area is also a

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.626 A:middle
rectangular area and must be a

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:51.896 A:middle
subset of the view area.

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:55.006 A:middle
The safe area represents the

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.446 A:middle
portion of the display that will

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.076 A:middle
contain interactive content.

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.346 A:middle
This includes user interface

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.346 A:middle
This includes user interface

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:01.536 A:middle
elements such as buttons and

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.996 A:middle
lists and important status

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:05.136 A:middle
information like time, signal

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:06.546 A:middle
strength and route guidance

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.146 A:middle
information.

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:09.295 A:middle
iPhone will draw interactive

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.076 A:middle
content within the boundaries of

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:11.786 A:middle
the safe area.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:15.036 A:middle
Modern car displays can come in

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:16.786 A:middle
many different shapes and sizes.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:17.956 A:middle
Displays themselves may be

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:19.736 A:middle
non-rectangular or portions of

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:21.486 A:middle
the display may be occluded by

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:22.196 A:middle
other elements.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.896 A:middle
With iOS 13, CarPlay can use

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.476 A:middle
safe areas to better support

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:28.296 A:middle
non-rectangular shaped displays.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.976 A:middle
First, the system defines a view

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:31.316 A:middle
area.

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:33.516 A:middle
The view area rectangle in this

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:34.586 A:middle
case would be made up of the

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.216 A:middle
widest and tallest points of the

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:36.736 A:middle
display.

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:38.626 A:middle
This allows the CarPlay image to

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.016 A:middle
render to all parts of the

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:40.546 A:middle
display.

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:43.416 A:middle
Then a safe area rectangle will

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.756 A:middle
be declared for the part of the

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.756 A:middle
display where a CarPlay UI is

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:48.496 A:middle
guaranteed to be visible and

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:49.896 A:middle
interactable to the user.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:52.926 A:middle
And that was our update on

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:54.566 A:middle
irregularly shaped displays.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:58.276 A:middle
Next up, let's talk about second

00:02:58.276 --> 00:02:59.606 A:middle
screen support in CarPlay.

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:02.866 A:middle
Prior to iOS 13, iPhone provided

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.586 A:middle
a single H.264 video screen to

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.126 A:middle
display the CarPlay UI on the

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:08.386 A:middle
center console display.

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:10.686 A:middle
This provides a great way for

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:12.096 A:middle
users to set a navigation

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:13.976 A:middle
destination, interact with music

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:15.006 A:middle
apps and more.

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:17.366 A:middle
However, this limits the user's

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.486 A:middle
CarPlay experience to the

00:03:18.486 --> 00:03:19.676 A:middle
vehicle's main display.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:23.136 A:middle
Many vehicles have rich displays

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.626 A:middle
directly in front of the driver

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:26.226 A:middle
to show important information in

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:27.216 A:middle
the form of an instrument

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:27.586 A:middle
cluster.

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:30.156 A:middle
In iOS 13, we now support

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:33.116 A:middle
multiple H.264 video streams to

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:34.636 A:middle
display CarPlay content in the

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:36.026 A:middle
vehicle's instrument cluster.

00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:38.116 A:middle
This is a great way to display

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:39.176 A:middle
additional information from

00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:40.946 A:middle
CarPlay apps directly in the

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:41.796 A:middle
instrument cluster.

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:45.006 A:middle
And different types of

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
information can be displayed in

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:47.146 A:middle
different areas of the

00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:48.866 A:middle
instrument cluster using more

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:49.876 A:middle
than one video stream.

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:53.806 A:middle
In iOS 13, CarPlay will support

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:55.276 A:middle
a maneuver instruction card

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.726 A:middle
provided by Apple Maps, as well

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
as a map view which can be

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
rendered in parallel with the

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
rendered in parallel with the

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.066 A:middle
instruction card in two separate

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.016 A:middle
video streams.

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:05.756 A:middle
Each video stream will have an

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:07.576 A:middle
independent night mode, allowing

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:09.086 A:middle
the vehicle system to specify an

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.336 A:middle
appearance mode for different

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:11.266 A:middle
content types.

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.216 A:middle
Also, the vehicle chooses what

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:15.886 A:middle
type of content is shown in each

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:16.276 A:middle
stream.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.116 A:middle
For instrument clusters, car

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.986 A:middle
play will only draw the type of

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.136 A:middle
content the vehicle has

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:21.636 A:middle
selected.

00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
But please note for heads-up

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.306 A:middle
displays, information from iAP2

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:27.906 A:middle
Route Guidance will continue to

00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
be used.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.606 A:middle
So with this in mind, let's look

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:31.896 A:middle
at how to best utilize the

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.456 A:middle
different available protocols to

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.026 A:middle
integrate CarPlay into a vehicle

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:35.776 A:middle
instrument cluster.

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:38.116 A:middle
Users can be provided with

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:39.726 A:middle
simple status information from

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.126 A:middle
apps in CarPlay such as

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:43.026 A:middle
navigation, audio and phone

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:43.456 A:middle
calls.

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:46.396 A:middle
Firstly, map or turn-by-turn

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:47.956 A:middle
information provided as a video

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:49.426 A:middle
from iPhone can be displayed.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:51.726 A:middle
Additional information about the

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:52.946 A:middle
navigation route can also be

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.126 A:middle
provided as metadata using the

00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:56.986 A:middle
iAP2 Route Guidance feature.

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:00.266 A:middle
This, like other iAP2 features,

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:00.266 A:middle
This, like other iAP2 features,

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.706 A:middle
requires the vehicle to draw the

00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.786 A:middle
metadata in its own native UI.

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.696 A:middle
The currently playing track or

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:07.396 A:middle
podcasts can be rendered using

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:09.596 A:middle
iAP2 Now Playing along with any

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:11.456 A:middle
information about ongoing phone

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:12.786 A:middle
calls using the iAP2

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:14.006 A:middle
Communications feature.

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:16.666 A:middle
Control of those phone calls can

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:18.686 A:middle
be supported using iAP2 Call

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.456 A:middle
Controls, allowing the system to

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:22.036 A:middle
offer specific user actions

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.726 A:middle
during phone calls like mute,

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:26.786 A:middle
swap call and end call.

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:30.536 A:middle
Displaying CarPlay content in

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:31.586 A:middle
the instrument cluster is

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:32.636 A:middle
another part of the vehicle

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:34.206 A:middle
system that benefits from using

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:35.936 A:middle
safe areas and view areas.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.316 A:middle
In this example, the view area

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:39.986 A:middle
would be the rectangle between

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:41.376 A:middle
and behind the virtual

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:42.106 A:middle
tachometers.

00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:43.976 A:middle
While aesthetically it may be

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.856 A:middle
desirable for CarPlay content to

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.296 A:middle
fill this region, some of it

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:48.696 A:middle
would be obscured by the virtual

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.396 A:middle
tachometers.

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:51.476 A:middle
So a safe area would be declared

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.866 A:middle
in the area between the two

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.466 A:middle
tachometers and CarPlay will

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:55.526 A:middle
position the important

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:56.736 A:middle
information where it will be

00:05:56.736 --> 00:05:57.716 A:middle
visible to the user.

00:05:58.286 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And multiple streams can be set

00:05:58.286 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And multiple streams can be set

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:02.116 A:middle
up to display different types of

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:03.496 A:middle
content from CarPlay within the

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.296 A:middle
instrument cluster.

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:06.626 A:middle
For example, the second stream

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:07.806 A:middle
could be a map view and the

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:09.736 A:middle
third stream an instruction

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:10.606 A:middle
card.

00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:12.216 A:middle
Displaying content within a

00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:13.806 A:middle
virtual tachometer will also

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.706 A:middle
make use of view areas and safe

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:16.186 A:middle
areas.

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:18.196 A:middle
The rectangle containing the

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.046 A:middle
entire circle would be the view

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.666 A:middle
area, and the rectangle

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.246 A:middle
contained entirely within the

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.916 A:middle
circle is the safe area.

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:27.706 A:middle
Again, CarPlay will position the

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:29.286 A:middle
important information where it

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:30.476 A:middle
will be visible to the user.

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:33.206 A:middle
So that was our update on

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:34.666 A:middle
support for second screens.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.446 A:middle
Now let's take a look at the

00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:38.836 A:middle
last of our new features that

00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:40.236 A:middle
affects displays in CarPlay,

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:42.316 A:middle
dynamic screen resizing.

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:45.606 A:middle
Prior to iOS 13, the size of the

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:47.336 A:middle
CarPlay image remained fixed

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.506 A:middle
while the CarPlay session was

00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:48.906 A:middle
active.

00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:51.606 A:middle
Now the size of the CarPlay UI

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:53.086 A:middle
can change on the fly at the

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
user's request by declaring

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:56.406 A:middle
multiple view areas for that

00:06:56.406 --> 00:06:56.866 A:middle
display.

00:06:57.856 --> 00:06:59.226 A:middle
This is ideal for systems that

00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:00.926 A:middle
support configurable horizontal

00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:00.926 A:middle
support configurable horizontal

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:03.116 A:middle
split screens as shown here, and

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:04.616 A:middle
larger portrait screens that are

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.276 A:middle
normally divided into distinct

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:07.846 A:middle
context-specific regions.

00:07:08.436 --> 00:07:10.016 A:middle
CarPlay can provide an Always

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:11.546 A:middle
Available button for the user to

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:13.176 A:middle
trigger a resize request from

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:14.476 A:middle
within the CarPlay UI.

00:07:15.786 --> 00:07:17.376 A:middle
This is useful to show CarPlay

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:18.966 A:middle
in a full-screen configuration

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.416 A:middle
without reserving space in the

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:22.626 A:middle
native UI for dedicated control

00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:23.816 A:middle
for the user to exit that

00:07:23.816 --> 00:07:24.566 A:middle
configuration.

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.236 A:middle
Resizing is not only supported

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:29.626 A:middle
on the center console display

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:30.796 A:middle
but also on the instrument

00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:31.486 A:middle
cluster as well.

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:34.076 A:middle
So let's use the instrument

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:35.176 A:middle
cluster from the previous

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:36.556 A:middle
section as an example of how

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.236 A:middle
dynamic resizing could be used

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:38.816 A:middle
in CarPlay.

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.436 A:middle
Let's say this instrument

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:43.076 A:middle
cluster offers the user a way to

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:44.616 A:middle
move the virtual tachometers

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:46.476 A:middle
into one of two preferred

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:47.156 A:middle
positions.

00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:50.116 A:middle
For this to work well, the

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:51.406 A:middle
CarPlay image needs to be able

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:52.776 A:middle
to adjust its size based on

00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:54.066 A:middle
where the virtual tachometers

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:54.746 A:middle
are positioned.

00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:57.586 A:middle
Multiple view areas can be

00:07:57.586 --> 00:07:59.016 A:middle
declared for this display to

00:07:59.016 --> 00:07:59.706 A:middle
make this happen.

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
Let's declare the first view

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:02.686 A:middle
area for the widest

00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.426 A:middle
configuration and include a safe

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:05.786 A:middle
area as discussed earlier.

00:08:08.056 --> 00:08:09.526 A:middle
For the narrower configuration,

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.236 A:middle
a second view area would be used

00:08:11.236 --> 00:08:12.936 A:middle
with its own narrower safe area.

00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.316 A:middle
The vehicle system can also

00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:16.956 A:middle
specify how long the transition

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:18.246 A:middle
between those configurations

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:19.666 A:middle
should take, allowing the

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.236 A:middle
CarPlay content to transition

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:22.966 A:middle
sizes in the same timeframe.

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:25.026 A:middle
Let's take a look at how this

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.566 A:middle
transition would work.

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:29.486 A:middle
The user starts in the wider

00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
configuration and uses some

00:08:30.956 --> 00:08:32.806 A:middle
native UI control, possibly a

00:08:32.806 --> 00:08:34.056 A:middle
steering wheel button, to begin

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:34.746 A:middle
the transition.

00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:37.976 A:middle
During this three-second

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.466 A:middle
transition, CarPlay is telling

00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
the native system the size of

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:42.645 A:middle
the encoded image in the H.264

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:44.196 A:middle
frame, allowing the vehicle

00:08:44.196 --> 00:08:45.306 A:middle
system to synchronize the

00:08:45.306 --> 00:08:46.656 A:middle
position of its own tachometer

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:47.626 A:middle
UI elements.

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:51.026 A:middle
So in summary, dynamic resizing

00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:52.706 A:middle
is supported on center console

00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:54.226 A:middle
and instrument cluster displays.

00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.966 A:middle
A UI resize can be triggered by

00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:58.316 A:middle
the user either through the

00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:00.026 A:middle
native UI or a button within the

00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:00.026 A:middle
native UI or a button within the

00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:00.846 A:middle
CarPlay UI.

00:09:02.316 --> 00:09:03.736 A:middle
The vehicle system declares how

00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:05.116 A:middle
long transitions between view

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:05.886 A:middle
areas should take.

00:09:06.276 --> 00:09:09.256 A:middle
And CarPlay provides an update

00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:10.556 A:middle
on how far the view area

00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:12.106 A:middle
transition it is so the vehicle

00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:13.116 A:middle
system can synchronize

00:09:13.116 --> 00:09:14.816 A:middle
transition animations in its own

00:09:14.816 --> 00:09:15.156 A:middle
UI.

00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:18.186 A:middle
So that's all for our new

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:19.716 A:middle
display-related features.

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:21.326 A:middle
Thanks for listening so far.

00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:23.096 A:middle
Now over to Tanya for an update

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.216 A:middle
on Siri in CarPlay.

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:26.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tom.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.656 A:middle
My name is Tanya Kancheva and

00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.656 A:middle
I'll talk to you about enabling

00:09:30.656 --> 00:09:32.396 A:middle
Hey Siri support in future

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:33.046 A:middle
vehicles.

00:09:33.996 --> 00:09:35.756 A:middle
So what do we mean when we talk

00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:37.476 A:middle
about supporting Hey Siri in

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:37.966 A:middle
your car?

00:09:39.326 --> 00:09:41.696 A:middle
First, of course, the driver can

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:43.006 A:middle
launch Siri completely

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.996 A:middle
hands-free without needing to

00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:46.886 A:middle
press a button or take their

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:47.896 A:middle
eyes off the road.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:51.136 A:middle
And since Hey Siri is detected

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:52.646 A:middle
using the car's microphone,

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.436 A:middle
iPhone can be out of sight, left

00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:57.086 A:middle
in a pocket or even in the

00:09:57.086 --> 00:09:57.436 A:middle
trunk.

00:09:58.156 --> 00:09:59.846 A:middle
Siri will still be available.

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:03.946 A:middle
We also updated audio handling

00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:05.856 A:middle
so that activating Siri through

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.116 A:middle
a button press is instantaneous.

00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:10.666 A:middle
Just hold the Siri button on the

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:12.426 A:middle
steering wheel and say your

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:14.056 A:middle
request without waiting for an

00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:15.506 A:middle
audible trigger to speak.

00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:17.636 A:middle
Siri will be back with your

00:10:17.636 --> 00:10:18.906 A:middle
answer immediately.

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:23.566 A:middle
Lastly, we looked at how Siri

00:10:23.566 --> 00:10:25.276 A:middle
and Music interplay in the car

00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:27.496 A:middle
and enable the smoother and more

00:10:27.496 --> 00:10:28.756 A:middle
familiar experience.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.936 A:middle
Music continues to play in the

00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:33.076 A:middle
background while interacting

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:33.626 A:middle
with Siri.

00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:39.166 A:middle
Here is a system overview for

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:40.576 A:middle
audio handling in CarPlay.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.826 A:middle
Some of the components should

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:44.516 A:middle
already be familiar to you, but

00:10:44.746 --> 00:10:46.276 A:middle
let's go ahead and look into the

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:46.876 A:middle
details.

00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:50.506 A:middle
To support Hey Siri, the in-car

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:52.386 A:middle
microphone needs to be always

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:55.336 A:middle
active and undergo continuous

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:56.256 A:middle
voice processing.

00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:59.376 A:middle
The echo cancellation module

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.256 A:middle
runs all the time and removes

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.256 A:middle
runs all the time and removes

00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:02.626 A:middle
any audio playing through the

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:04.916 A:middle
car's speakers as well as

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.386 A:middle
reduces background driving

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:06.656 A:middle
noise.

00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:11.146 A:middle
The process microphone data is

00:11:11.146 --> 00:11:12.826 A:middle
sent to an audio ring buffer

00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:14.786 A:middle
within the CarPlay communication

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:16.886 A:middle
plug-in which holds a couple of

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:18.816 A:middle
seconds of historical audio.

00:11:19.586 --> 00:11:21.296 A:middle
This buffer is stored within the

00:11:21.296 --> 00:11:23.576 A:middle
car until there is a trigger to

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:25.796 A:middle
send it to iPhone.

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.256 A:middle
So what is this trigger?

00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:30.126 A:middle
In fact, there are two modules

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:31.886 A:middle
which can lead to audio exchange

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:32.576 A:middle
with iPhone.

00:11:33.366 --> 00:11:35.306 A:middle
Both constantly analyze the

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:36.716 A:middle
process microphone data.

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:39.116 A:middle
One can trigger when the drive

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:40.126 A:middle
says Siri.

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:41.936 A:middle
That's the keyword detector.

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:44.456 A:middle
The other one triggers when the

00:11:44.456 --> 00:11:45.836 A:middle
drive starts talking.

00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:47.556 A:middle
That's the voice activity

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:48.016 A:middle
detector.

00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:51.196 A:middle
Both detectors must be available

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:53.646 A:middle
in the car as iPhone determines

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.126 A:middle
which one is used for a

00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:56.306 A:middle
particular scenario.

00:11:58.096 --> 00:11:59.956 A:middle
Now let's say the keyword

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
detector triggered so the car

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
detector triggered so the car

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:03.936 A:middle
notifies iPhone through the

00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:05.066 A:middle
communication plug-in.

00:12:06.706 --> 00:12:09.176 A:middle
iPhone opens a new audio stream

00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:11.946 A:middle
called Aux In, requesting some

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:13.756 A:middle
historical audio data to be

00:12:13.756 --> 00:12:14.186 A:middle
sent.

00:12:15.346 --> 00:12:18.366 A:middle
The received audio is reanalyzed

00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:20.886 A:middle
by a voice trigger detector on

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:23.246 A:middle
iPhone which verifies that the

00:12:23.246 --> 00:12:24.706 A:middle
user said, "Hey, Siri."

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:28.026 A:middle
The second pass detector uses

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:29.916 A:middle
offline keyword detection on

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.706 A:middle
iPhone similar to how Hey Siri

00:12:32.706 --> 00:12:34.606 A:middle
is detected when the user is not

00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:35.056 A:middle
driving.

00:12:36.336 --> 00:12:38.196 A:middle
Only after the second pass

00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:41.736 A:middle
detector on iPhone triggers Siri

00:12:41.736 --> 00:12:43.686 A:middle
is activated to process the data

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:45.316 A:middle
and respond to the user.

00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:49.716 A:middle
Now, let's look at how this

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:51.516 A:middle
architecture is helping us

00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:53.376 A:middle
improve triggering Siri with a

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.246 A:middle
button press.

00:12:54.636 --> 00:12:57.926 A:middle
As we already saw, the mic, the

00:12:57.926 --> 00:13:00.276 A:middle
ECNR unit and the audio ring

00:12:57.926 --> 00:13:00.276 A:middle
ECNR unit and the audio ring

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:02.136 A:middle
buffer are processing audio

00:13:02.136 --> 00:13:04.026 A:middle
within the car system all the

00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:04.436 A:middle
time.

00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:08.686 A:middle
Now the user presses the Siri

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:10.326 A:middle
button on the steering wheel

00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:13.416 A:middle
that is the trigger for iPhone

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:15.336 A:middle
to request audio data from the

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.176 A:middle
time when the user pressed the

00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:17.646 A:middle
button.

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:20.076 A:middle
Since this is the button press,

00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:22.446 A:middle
Siri activates immediately.

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:24.956 A:middle
And as the buffered audio is

00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:27.566 A:middle
sent faster than real-time, Siri

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.366 A:middle
can be ready with a response

00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:31.056 A:middle
right after the user stops

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:31.546 A:middle
talking.

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:35.886 A:middle
Okay, now that we have discussed

00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:37.756 A:middle
the three ways in which Siri can

00:13:37.756 --> 00:13:40.536 A:middle
trigger from the car through a

00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:43.156 A:middle
detected keyword, voice activity

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:45.596 A:middle
or a button press, let's see

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:47.506 A:middle
what happens when Siri is active

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:48.896 A:middle
and helping the driver.

00:13:50.466 --> 00:13:52.936 A:middle
Typically, music will be playing

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:53.496 A:middle
in the car.

00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:56.136 A:middle
In this case, let's say that

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.846 A:middle
music is coming from iPhone.

00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
The car will receive the audio,

00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
The car will receive the audio,

00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:02.366 A:middle
mix it and play it through the

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:03.016 A:middle
speakers.

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:05.696 A:middle
In the past, when Siri started

00:14:05.696 --> 00:14:08.126 A:middle
in CarPlay, music had to stop

00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:09.836 A:middle
and there was a bit of silence

00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:11.486 A:middle
before Siri prompts played.

00:14:12.636 --> 00:14:13.956 A:middle
With this new architecture,

00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:16.536 A:middle
media playback is separated from

00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:19.396 A:middle
Siri prompts so the music can

00:14:19.396 --> 00:14:20.776 A:middle
keep playing in the background.

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:23.706 A:middle
When Siri launches, an

00:14:23.706 --> 00:14:25.116 A:middle
additional audio stream

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:27.556 A:middle
dedicated to Siri output, Aux

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:29.296 A:middle
Out, will be opened.

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:32.636 A:middle
The car will then mix the two

00:14:32.636 --> 00:14:35.036 A:middle
streams, reduce the volume of

00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:37.366 A:middle
the music as needed and play

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.496 A:middle
Siri prompts quickly and without

00:14:39.496 --> 00:14:40.586 A:middle
big interruptions.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:44.536 A:middle
But please don't forget that in

00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:47.016 A:middle
addition to Siri prompts, there

00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:49.276 A:middle
might be active route guidance,

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:51.556 A:middle
so the mixer has to be able to

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.816 A:middle
mix three parallel audio streams

00:14:53.816 --> 00:14:54.866 A:middle
coming from iPhone.

00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:57.676 A:middle
All right.

00:14:58.226 --> 00:14:59.626 A:middle
Now that we have gone through

00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:00.936 A:middle
the details of the audio

00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:00.936 A:middle
the details of the audio

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:02.926 A:middle
architecture, let's quickly

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:05.656 A:middle
summarize what is needed within

00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
the vehicle system.

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:10.046 A:middle
First, a microphone which is

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:11.766 A:middle
always processing audio in your

00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:12.256 A:middle
system.

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
Then, an echo canceller and

00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:17.136 A:middle
noise reduction module to clean

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:18.396 A:middle
up microphone input.

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:21.786 A:middle
A detector that triggers when

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:23.006 A:middle
the driver is talking.

00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:26.676 A:middle
A detector that triggers when

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.296 A:middle
the Siri keyword is heard.

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:32.906 A:middle
The ability to mix three audio

00:15:32.906 --> 00:15:33.946 A:middle
streams from CarPlay.

00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:38.396 A:middle
And that's how our update on Hey

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:38.816 A:middle
Siri.

00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:41.926 A:middle
Thank you for your time.

00:15:42.616 --> 00:15:44.376 A:middle
