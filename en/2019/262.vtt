[ Music ]

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:08.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Tim Horton from the

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:09.646 A:middle
Safari and WebKit Team.

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:11.706 A:middle
I'm here to show you how to

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:13.516 A:middle
present rich links in your app.

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:17.306 A:middle
In iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, we

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:18.546 A:middle
introduced rich links in

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:20.376 A:middle
messages as a way to make URLs

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:23.396 A:middle
more beautiful and more useful.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:24.506 A:middle
In order to maximize the

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:25.356 A:middle
benefit, we built

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:26.676 A:middle
specializations for certain

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:28.326 A:middle
kinds of links.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:30.176 A:middle
This includes things like inline

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:31.446 A:middle
video and audio playback, a

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.756 A:middle
special presentation for Tweets

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
including those with multiple

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.286 A:middle
images and many other things

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:38.556 A:middle
like Apple Maps links.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.276 A:middle
This year iOS 13 and macOS 10.15

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:47.166 A:middle
bring new APIs that allow you to

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.686 A:middle
present rich links in your own

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:50.516 A:middle
apps so that you get those same

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:51.946 A:middle
benefits with a minimal amount

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:52.356 A:middle
of work.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:54.686 A:middle
In this video, we're going to

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.586 A:middle
follow the development of this

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.356 A:middle
very simple recipe book marking

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
app as we progressively adopt

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
app as we progressively adopt

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.866 A:middle
features of the new link

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
presentation framework to go

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.525 A:middle
from a bland list of URLs to a

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.686 A:middle
rich grid of links like this in

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:08.376 A:middle
no time at all.

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:11.716 A:middle
To achieve this I'm going to

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.326 A:middle
cover 3 topics.

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:15.296 A:middle
First, how to present metadata

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:16.296 A:middle
given a URL.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:19.096 A:middle
Second, how to easily present

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:20.586 A:middle
that metadata to the user.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:23.506 A:middle
And third, how to use fetched

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:24.966 A:middle
metadata to accelerate the

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.396 A:middle
presentation of the new Share

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.806 A:middle
Sheet experience in iOS 13.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:31.986 A:middle
So let's start with retrieving

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:32.416 A:middle
metadata.

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.276 A:middle
In the recipe app, let's say

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.546 A:middle
that you already have some

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.496 A:middle
mechanism for users to get URLs

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:40.226 A:middle
into the app.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.496 A:middle
You could just present them in a

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:44.556 A:middle
table and call it quits, but

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.046 A:middle
URLs are not very user-friendly

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:47.666 A:middle
and in this case, it's quite

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
hard to distinguish between

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:48.966 A:middle
them.

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:51.326 A:middle
You could instead ask the user

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.936 A:middle
for a title for each link, but

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:54.266 A:middle
we can make it even easier.

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.686 A:middle
Using the new link presentation

00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:59.936 A:middle
framework it's very easy to use

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.286 A:middle
the LP metadata provider class

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.286 A:middle
the LP metadata provider class

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.376 A:middle
to retrieve rich metadata from

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:04.926 A:middle
the website.

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:07.646 A:middle
You just pass it the URL and it

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:10.026 A:middle
returns you an LPLinkMetadata

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:11.836 A:middle
object with a representative

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.596 A:middle
title in any media that is

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:14.066 A:middle
available.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.256 A:middle
Let's see what this looks like.

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:19.376 A:middle
First you create an

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:22.266 A:middle
LPMetadataProvider and then call

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.956 A:middle
startFetchingMetadata with the

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.786 A:middle
URL you're interested in.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:27.936 A:middle
When the completion handler is

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:29.336 A:middle
called, be sure to check the

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:29.766 A:middle
error.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.056 A:middle
If the server doesn't respond or

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.296 A:middle
is too slow or your user doesn't

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:35.436 A:middle
have a network connection, the

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.456 A:middle
metadata fetched can fail.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.396 A:middle
Finally, you use the metadata

00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:41.346 A:middle
for whatever you want.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:42.936 A:middle
We'll come back to this in a

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:43.306 A:middle
moment.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.456 A:middle
Before we continue there are a

00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:48.136 A:middle
few things to keep in mind when

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.966 A:middle
using metadataProvider and

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:51.226 A:middle
LinkMetadata.

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.436 A:middle
First, the resultant metadata

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:54.906 A:middle
object can include any of a

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:58.166 A:middle
title, icon, image or video or

00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.376 A:middle
none at all if the site doesn't

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:00.086 A:middle
specify any.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:00.086 A:middle
specify any.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.726 A:middle
It is also serializable within a

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:03.526 A:middle
secure coding.

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:05.356 A:middle
This is important because

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:06.946 A:middle
LPMetadataProvider hits the

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:08.766 A:middle
Internet to do its job and you

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.606 A:middle
don't want to do that work nor

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:11.916 A:middle
make your users pay that data

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:14.076 A:middle
and performance cost every time

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:15.246 A:middle
you present the same link.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:16.966 A:middle
You should cache retrieved

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:18.726 A:middle
metadata locally as much as

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:19.306 A:middle
possible.

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:23.056 A:middle
Also, you can fetch metadata for

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:25.486 A:middle
local file URLs in which case

00:03:25.486 --> 00:03:26.996 A:middle
the new QuickLook thumbnailing

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:29.316 A:middle
API will be used to retrieve a

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:30.656 A:middle
representative thumbnail for the

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:31.716 A:middle
file, if possible.

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:35.296 A:middle
Now let's talk about how to put

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:37.136 A:middle
the metadata we retrieve to use

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:38.546 A:middle
by presenting it in our app.

00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:40.996 A:middle
Once again, it's

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:41.696 A:middle
straightforward.

00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:43.176 A:middle
You can just take the object

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.706 A:middle
from earlier and create an

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:45.726 A:middle
LPLinkView with it.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:49.256 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
Let's return to the recipe app

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.366 A:middle
and put LPLinkViews inside our

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:56.366 A:middle
table view cells.

00:03:57.846 --> 00:03:58.486 A:middle
Much better.

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:00.226 A:middle
Now you have a very familiar

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:00.226 A:middle
Now you have a very familiar

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:01.586 A:middle
presentation that makes each

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.146 A:middle
recipe easy to identify at a

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.836 A:middle
glance.

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.476 A:middle
LPLinkView has an intrinsic

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:08.556 A:middle
size, but it also responds to

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:10.726 A:middle
size that fits with the ideal

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:12.486 A:middle
size to use given a constraining

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
size and we'll try to present

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:15.806 A:middle
something reasonable when laid

00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:17.486 A:middle
out at any size.

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:20.065 A:middle
The last thing I'm going to talk

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:21.416 A:middle
about is how to make use of

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.366 A:middle
LinkMetadata to accelerate the

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:24.776 A:middle
presentation of the new Share

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:26.966 A:middle
Sheet experience in iOS 13.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:29.946 A:middle
For existing apps that share

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:31.426 A:middle
URLs, the Share Sheet will

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:32.786 A:middle
automatically present a preview

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:33.716 A:middle
of the link at the top of the

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
card.

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
However, this requires reaching

00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:37.946 A:middle
out to the server to retrieve

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:39.966 A:middle
metadata once the Share Sheet is

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:40.546 A:middle
presented.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.536 A:middle
So the title and icon show up

00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:44.406 A:middle
asynchronously.

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:45.596 A:middle
Let's watch that again.

00:04:45.906 --> 00:04:47.556 A:middle
Keep a close eye on the Share

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:48.256 A:middle
Sheet's header.

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:52.606 A:middle
If you already have an

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:54.846 A:middle
LPLinkMetadata object for URL,

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:56.596 A:middle
you should just pass it to the

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.266 A:middle
Share Sheet and the preview will

00:04:58.266 --> 00:04:59.836 A:middle
appear instantly without loading

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:00.506 A:middle
from the network.

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:00.506 A:middle
from the network.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
You can use the new

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.136 A:middle
activityViewControllerLink

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.826 A:middle
Metadata method on your

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:06.626 A:middle
implementation of

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:09.276 A:middle
UIActivityItemSource and just

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.816 A:middle
return the metadata object.

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:13.386 A:middle
Let's look at the difference in

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:14.816 A:middle
our recipe app if we provide the

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.196 A:middle
data that we already use in the

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:16.686 A:middle
table view.

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:20.056 A:middle
Much nicer.

00:05:20.206 --> 00:05:21.706 A:middle
It's also good to note that if

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:22.966 A:middle
the user chooses to share to

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:25.046 A:middle
messages the same metadata is

00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:26.196 A:middle
passed directly through

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:27.826 A:middle
providing a smooth and seamless

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.616 A:middle
experience with no unnecessary

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:29.966 A:middle
loading.

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:31.846 A:middle
One last thing.

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:33.976 A:middle
Say your app already has a

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:35.776 A:middle
database of recipes with titles

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.206 A:middle
and images that weren't fetched

00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
by linked presentation.

00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:40.356 A:middle
You don't have to re-fetch the

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:42.056 A:middle
metadata from the Internet in

00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:43.216 A:middle
order to accelerate the Share

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:44.986 A:middle
Sheet or to present a rich link.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.216 A:middle
Instead, you can just fill in

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:48.696 A:middle
the fields of LPLinkMetadata

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:50.696 A:middle
yourself from your pre-existing

00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:51.406 A:middle
source of data.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.436 A:middle
You simply create an

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.706 A:middle
LPLinkMetadata object and fill

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:57.496 A:middle
in at least the original URL and

00:05:57.496 --> 00:05:59.396 A:middle
URL fields plus whatever

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:01.366 A:middle
additional information you have.

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:01.366 A:middle
additional information you have.

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:05.346 A:middle
So our 3 key takeaways today are

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.946 A:middle
you can use LP metadata provider
