00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.800
>> Francois Jouaux: Welcome to
Automating the Creation of iPad Content,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.150
Tools for the New Desktop Publishing Revolution.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.770
Wow. Good title like this.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.370
Either they are a car salesman or there's
something really interesting here.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.340
Let's see.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.510
And I forgot my teacup.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.370
[ Silence ]

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.140
Hello. I am Francois Jouaux.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.990
I am the Senior Manager of System Tools
at Apple, and also Engineering Manager

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.420
of Automation which means they make me code.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.290
And what is this session about?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.300
This session is about the relationship
between automation and iPad content creation.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.510
It's about the role automation will have to take in
iPod content creation, and the tools and techniques

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.020
that are available today to simplify your life.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.020
Who is this session for?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.230
There's a very wide spectrum of people
that want to create content for the iPad.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.840
These range from students, teachers
that want to publish papers,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.370
that want to publish art, photos,
illustrations to your boss.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.340
People that are coding impaired.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460
People unlike you.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.150
You have to relate to these people and help them
distribute and manage the content that they have created

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.130
on the desktop, and that they want to make
available to all the people that have iPads.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.950
This session is about developers
because there is a market for such tools

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.620
that will enable the creativity of all the consumers.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.520
What you will learn.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.620
You will learn how automation can help you.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.150
You will learn about the automation
technologies available today on Mac OS X.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.590
And how to develop custom content
creation tools using these technologies.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.730
What are these technologies anyway?

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.230
AppleScript is your English-like scripting language
that controls the Mac OS X operating system,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.080
its applications on also third party applications.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.560
Automator.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.760
Our award winning visual workflow development tool.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:50.490
With its hundreds of actions allows you
to create powerful recipes and services

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.960
since Mac OS X Snow Leopard services put at your
point-of-need contextual menus that allow you.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.930
That gives you the power and the ability
to harness these automation technologies.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:16.510
And to talk to you about this into more detail, dealing
you with some crazy demo, here is Sal who you all know.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.490
[ Applause and cheers ]

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.520
>> Sal Soghoian: Sick, sick, sick.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.920
Anybody who gets up at 9:00 in the morning to hear me
talk is insane, so I'm in a roomful of crazy people.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.930
I'm Sal Soghoian.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.660
I am officially the Product Manager for Automation
Technologies at Apple Computer for the last thirteen years.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.060
And this has been.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.410
Out of thirteen years of being at Apple, this has been one
of the most exceptional years that I've seen at the company.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:56.780
You know, with the release of the iPad and just all the
changes that are going on, the dramatic movement forward

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.560
and pushing the platform and integrating new and
groundbreaking technologies, it's a lot of upheaval,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.350
a lot of disruption, a lot of creativity.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.630
So people might have a question about well, how
does this relate to Mac OS X now that we have iPads?

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.830
Well, if history is anything to judge
about what's going to be coming up,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:28.130
we in the automation community are really excited
about our prospects and about what we can do to make

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.540
and assist concrete, the creation of
content for the iPad moving forward.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.050
And I'll start by giving you a brief little history
about the concept behind desktop publishing.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.410
Now back in like 1990 or the early '90s,
or the end of whatever decade that was,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:57.490
there was an invention of a new technology called
PostScript which defined the way things looked on a page.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.360
And they integrated this technology into printers, laser
printers, into Linotronics, and into the Macintosh.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.390
And for the first time, using programs like Ready,Set,Go!

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.660
and PageMaker, designers and publishers
were able to produce content

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.300
that they could never do before in a really timely fashion.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.030
Because up to this point they were
taking photographs, stripping things in.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.500
They had Hot Type, there were Ruby lists.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.470
A lot of manual effort went in to produce a page.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.040
And suddenly when that moved to the desktop
computer, it enabled a lot of creativity

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.600
and it enabled the faster processing
and turnaround of media.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.990
Around 1993, AppleScript was introduced.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:53.250
And with scriptable programs like QuarkXPress and
FileMaker Pro, all of a sudden we had the ability

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.330
to produce content based upon data sources like databases.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.220
So catalogs and different types of
publications that were data intensive,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.490
yet needed precision like weather
maps and stock figures for newspapers.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.220
Those kind of materials could for the time be
produced in a timely fashion and with accuracy.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:24.460
Because what AppleScript and automation delivered
was speed, accuracy, consistency and scalability.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.610
So for the first time companies could scale what they
were doing without having to add a lot of new people

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.630
and deal with the aspect of dealing with
humans and time off and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:43.700
So this was a groundbreaking point when automation and
publishing combined for the first time electronically.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.020
About the beginning of the last
decade of the last millennium.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.610
Ooh, I like that.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.790
Last millennium.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.250
The Internet really boomed and started
becoming a commercial entity where people,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.670
the focus on it was no longer this,
you know, creative education community.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.120
And became wait a second, this thing is really big.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.010
We need to communicate, we need to get our message out.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.520
I need to tell you something.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.020
I need to hear this.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.920
And it really became a lot about communication.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.860
So technologies were developed
like CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.150
RSS, XML, and other Internet technologies joined HTML.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.540
And really allowed the Internet to start
becoming a platform for development.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.590
Again, automation played a role in that because with
AppleScript and tools like Automator, suddenly media,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.530
being able to produce media in a timely fashion
and get it out to the public through podcasts,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.710
audio and video podcasts, became possible.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:49.260
So the concept that had started earlier in the mid
'90s is now coming to fruition and growing more

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.120
and more because the demand for content increased.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.030
And here we are now at the beginning of this decade
and they've turbocharged some of the technologies

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.740
that they introduced for the Internet
like cascading style sheets and HTML5.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.420
And they enhanced their abilities
to take it into the next decade.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.720
Well, the same happened with automation.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.260
With Snow Leopard we introduced something very dramatic.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.750
It's called AppleScript Objective-C.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.040
And for the first time AppleScript could
talk directly to the Cocoa frameworks.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.630
So anything that is possible to be called from a
Cocoa app can now be called from AppleScript directly.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.920
And this, combined with our revolutionary new
Services architecture that puts these tools

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.800
at the point-of-need contextually throughout
the OS, this really set it up for the delivery

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.420
of content to a whole new series of devices.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:51.260
So as you can see throughout the whole electronic history,
automation has played a role in delivering content.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.090
And if this is true, I have a feeling that
it's going to pertain and producing content

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.490
for the devices moving forward just the same way.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:08.470
Because this device is going to spur a whole
new wave of desktop publishing revolution.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.620
A whole new wave of content creation.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.010
You're here because of that.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.890
You're learning how to produce content.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.990
You're learning how to create apps that
absorb content or deal with content.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.390
So let's take a look at this device.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:30.010
By itself, it's just a really handsome well-designed tool.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:35.260
It doesn't have impact until you put something on it.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.190
And then you can become, it becomes
a device that can inform.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:49.800
It becomes a device that can find and locate
things, and help you get through and navigate.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.640
It also becomes a device that helps you remember.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.910
These are a couple friends of mine I lost this last year.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.780
That's Leroy Moore and George Melvin, so that's to you guys.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.230
So you can remember.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:09.880
You can have photographs and videos that
help you see part of into your life.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.510
And you can also use the device for
education as well with iTunes U,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.540
and with third-party software like
MathBoard from Pala Software.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:28.200
So the device, it's really the content that
makes this device important and makes it happen.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:37.080
It's a great device, but without the content that
you produce and others produce it's just a device.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.390
So how do you get content onto the iPod, iPad, iPod, iPad.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.030
Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.980
So let's take a look at some of the ways.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.150
First of all, you can make a native app, right?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.570
You can write an app and the app
can have, deliver its own content.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:59.510
So you've seen things like, you know, USA Today has an app
and it gets content and displays it from within its own app.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.810
We know about that.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.860
You can also have productivity
applications like the iWork Suited Tools.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.760
Or like Omni's programs where you
can create and share files.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.890
And that's one way to get content between different iPads.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.500
There's also electronic books.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.200
You can deliver those through commercial
publishers and through the iBook Store.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:33.140
Or you can use the open and free EPUB format and
create your own, and distribute those as well.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.120
But one of the most exciting things
is, of course, podcasts keep.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.900
You can now take podcasts and enhance them.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:46.110
They're much more visually exciting, and
you can convey the messages a lot easier now

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.050
on an iPad because they're portable.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:54.290
And one of the most exciting things that's now
available is this whole discussion of HTML5.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:59.190
You know that a lot of the classes that
you've been seeing here are all about HTML5.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:06.410
Well, we're going to look at how automation
plays a role in HTML5 and how, how can auto.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.880
How can you automate the creation of HTML content?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.880
So we're going to look at a couple different scenarios.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.940
We're going to look at contextual tools.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.020
What kind of automation tools can you have that
make it easier for you to process the materials

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.890
that you are going to put together and send to an iPad?

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.370
How do you deal with media?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.580
How do you deal with compression of audio and video?

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.600
How do you deal with manipulating images?

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.580
How do you deal with talking to
databases and grabbing information?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.450
So we're going to look at contextual tools, automated
tools that allow you to do these kind of things.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.390
Then we're going to look at a technique
called Template Publishing.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:55.350
This was first designed back in the '90s where
they were automating the creation of catalogs.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.620
But the principles remain the same.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.540
It's just at different destinations.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.100
Instead of going to print, we're
now going to an HTML bundle.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.540
But the principles about how you could take a template and
populate it instantly through automation remain the same.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.250
And we're going to a look at a couple of those examples.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:20.750
And then finally we're going to look at an interactive
Web example where automation not only creates the content,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:27.150
but publishes it across the Internet and then responds
to the users when they interact with that content.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.920
So those are three scenarios we're going to
look at in this short period of time today.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:39.160
And the technologies we're going to look at, we're
going to examine that do this are of course Automator,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.860
AppleScript, AppleScript Objective-C and Services.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.320
So let's talk about contextual tools.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.430
This is a great quote.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.620
This was a Tweet from John.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.620
I heart Automator.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:14:03.630
Thought to myself wish I had a droplet that could
turn high-res H.264 into Apple TV-size H.264.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.980
Took thirty seconds to make one.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:11.840
John was talking about of course this technology, Automator.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.000
We introduced Automator way back in Tiger.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.190
But it's steadily progressed.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:24.770
And what it does, it's a tool for visually
creating automation recipes called workflows

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:31.360
by joining together little nuggets of
pre-done automation called actions.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.770
Now these actions are installed in the operating
system, and by default they have hundreds installed.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:41.730
But you can download thousands of
third-party ones or create them yourself.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:48.210
Because they're just Xcode projects that are written in
any of the languages supported by the operating system.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.780
So if you write Objective-C or
AppleScript, Shell, Ruby, PERL, Python,

00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:00.840
whatever code works on Mac OS X you can
use to create your own Automator actions.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.530
And we're going to look at that.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.630
And they're based upon a simple principle
that you've seen over and over and over again.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.880
I'm by law required to do this slide, so
here's the frameworks of the operating system.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.230
The applications sit on top of the frameworks.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.520
The user triggers the applications
to talk to the system frameworks.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.650
And then that does something good for the user.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.920
We've seen this over and over.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.890
You design an application, it might
be an image manipulation application.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.750
It talks to Core Image.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.470
And then does something to the
image that the user wants, right?

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.350
Basic concept.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.700
We understand this.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:43.960
But what you might not know is that Services
can do the same thing as an application.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:50.850
When you write one of those Automator actions, it talks
to the frameworks the same way that an application does.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.300
There's no framework that the application
can get at that the service can't get at.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.180
So in many ways they're like mini apps themselves.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.810
But one other thing in addition is
that they can control applications.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.930
So a service can interact with an application
and get the application to do something,

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.290
as well as talk to the frameworks in the operating system.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.870
They're really powerful.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:21.580
So you can gain access to all the different
abilities of the operating system through Automator.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.620
That includes applications, it
includes the command line, Core Video,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.810
Core Audio, Core Data, Core, Core, Core, Core, Core.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.820
And even the media frameworks.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.810
All of that's exposed to you when
you write an Automator action.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.790
Then once you've created these, you
can expose them through Services.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:47.940
Services is the architecture that provides
point-of-need access to the power of the OS.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:56.210
So up in the Services menu, in the Application
menu you have the ability to access Services.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:03.390
In the Finder, in the Action menu you can access
Services contextually based upon what you have selected.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.600
The same with the contextual menu in the Finder,
or the contextual menu in other applications.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.180
So if you have text selected, you only
see the services that pertain to text.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.520
Or pertain to the type of text that you're looking for.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.820
So no longer do you have to open up an
image in an application to rotate it

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.360
or apply effects to it or do anything else to it.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:32.470
Because all of that ability that's part of the operating
system can now be exposed contextually at the point-of-need.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.910
You can be in an application like Mail, look
for a certain kind of data like an address,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:41.580
and tell Mail to make a new document
with that and pre-address it.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.980
No longer do you have to write a plug-in to Mail to do that,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:51.270
because the Services architecture gives you contextual
access to whatever is selected in the application.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.160
And then you can apply that power to it.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.200
And you can do way beyond what a browser plug-in can do.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.990
You can select data in one form,
transform it into another form.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:10.020
Take it to a different application and put it into that
application as I just did here by selecting Table Data

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.070
in Safari, turning it into a pie
chart that I put into pages.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.270
This goes way beyond being just a browser extension.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:24.420
You have total access to the entire OS,
and you're only limited by your creativity.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:32.560
So tools for content preparation is talking about creating
these kind of contextual tools and using these kind

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:40.470
of contextual tools that manipulate the content, the
raw content in preparation for getting it to the iPad.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.680
Make sense?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.840
Hmm-hmm-hmm?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.880
Okay, good.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.110
Now HTML Template Publishing.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.500
Simple concept.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.730
Basic concept.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:57.400
It's been used for out, since the Egyptian
used cuneiform they used template publishing.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.680
It's a basic concept.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.670
Once you understand it you can spend
a lot of money on pre-done systems

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.970
that do exactly the same thing that you can do yourself.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:13.380
And it's about taking something that you're going
to use over and over, and making it generic enough

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:20.190
that you can replace certain things inside of
that template to end with a finished product.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.810
Not everything about content is hand done.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.620
We don't do one-offs for every kind of thing that we do.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.520
There's a lot of templates that
we use in life that we're used to.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.320
And as long as they're attractive and functional and
they serve the users by having a decent interface,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.500
we're very happy as consumers to use templates.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.770
And you can automate them.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.870
They're great for automation.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.810
So here's a scenario of why is that important?

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.810
Welcome to the classroom of the future.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.750
You notice everybody sitting there with their iPad, right?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.890
And so there's our teacher.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.370
She's from like 1800.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.580
And she's wondering well, how do I get content?

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.870
I want to create this little thing
and deliver it to their iPads.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.950
How do I do that?

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.880
And the students are saying the same thing.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.560
They're going hey, how do we take
my little report and my photos

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.240
and my little video and deliver that as content to the iPad?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.610
Do I write an app and then submit that to the store?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.110
Or, you know, like exactly how do you do this?

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.020
And this is where template publishing
can really come into play.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:36.860
Because you can take the raw content, the stories, the
videos, the audio clips, all of that kind of stuff,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:44.380
and using Services you can convert them
into Web-Apps which are just HTML bundles

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.000
that you can automatically upload to
a server like your MobileMe account.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.090
And then thwat!

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:55.880
It shows right up on the iPad as a
full screen interactive type of thing.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.540
So we're going to look at one of
those scenarios of how that's done.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.250
Especially with the single view apps.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:08.860
So the first template that we created for
you was this one of just a single page.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.980
I have a report.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.220
I have a flowing text document.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.340
I want to display that on the iPad.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.070
Oh, and I want to add an image or maybe an audio clip, okay?

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.300
That's about it.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.270
I just want it to be quick and
dirty, but to have it look nice,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.810
be accessible to anybody with a Web browser or with an iPad.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.090
So this is an example we're going to look at.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.300
Then we're also going to look at
if you want more interactivity.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.610
What if you want something that has
different screens and different views?

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.520
And you can navigate it and it acts
just like a regular functional app.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.840
Can something as complex as this be automated?

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:58.910
Yes, because this is just basically a template and you
populate it with certain materials and media files.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.630
And it becomes a functional app, so
that you have this beautiful interface.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.540
And it begins with three different technologies.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.970
The first is HTML5.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:19.090
You can think of HTML5 as like when you're building a
building and you have a metal steel frame it hangs onto.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.210
It provides the foundation that
this app is going to hang onto.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.380
It has video and audio support through the video/audio tags.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.100
It has Web font integration, scalable vector graphics,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:37.290
and canvas support too so you can have
that interactive canvas thing in HTML.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.740
I stole these from Darren.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.980
Darren, if you're out there don't be mad at me.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:50.720
And of course it reuses WebKit, that set of APIs that
provides all the interactive transitions like you saw.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.460
The fades, the twistings, the, you
know, special effects, the dissolves.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.020
All that kind of stuff is done with WebKit.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.520
So the first technology that we use that
we're going to automate is this HTML5.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.280
The second one is cascading style sheets.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.770
Now we're used to the idea that style
sheets control type, on how type looks.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.930
But style sheets also control positional.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.530
So they can control where things
are located on the document as well.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.010
And apply effects to the objects that are in there.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:30.070
And the third technology is the wiring and it's JavaScript.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.250
And it's for when you click a button, that sends
the signal down the wire to a JavaScript controller

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:41.070
that triggers the CSS transforms that
make something happen on the computer.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:45.820
So that's the basic structure of what
goes on with these type of bundles.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.150
All of those files live in a folder.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.810
You've got your JavaScript.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.710
You've got your CSS, your HTML.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.830
All the media in there.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:58.580
Everything lives in this folder, and it becomes
this little interactive website called the Web-App.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:05.490
But for the user all they're going to do is just
select Images or something, and bring up an interface.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:12.410
You're going to wire up this interface so
that when they choose a setting that setting,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.140
each one replaces some placeholder in the template.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.250
So you're going to replace the letter space
placeholder with the value of that control.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.790
And we're going to use Cocoa bindings
and all that kind of stuff to do that.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:33.160
And then those values control how the media
is finally displayed with the thing itself.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.060
So the steps to develop your own
content creation tools, very simple.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.720
One, you design and build your HTML template.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.660
You basically steal anything that you like.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.320
You go out there, you look at it and go
oh, I like the way he does this or --

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:53.370
and you basically take your HTML kind of designs
and you insert at key points placeholders.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:25:00.850
Then second, you create an interface that's going to
gather the media and gather the settings from the user.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.650
Now if you're creating a service the media
is automatically passed into your service

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.830
so you don't have to do anything special for that.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:16.270
Third, then you're going to add the code inside of
your little control for replacing the placeholders

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.930
and scaling the media or doing whatever
processing you need to do to it.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:27.280
So let's take a look at the contextual tools and
this thing of HTML plumbing.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.090
Is this semi-interesting?

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.700
>> Audience: Yes!

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.520
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.290
[ Applause ]

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.620
So here's a video clip on my desktop.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:43.970
I just wanted to see if I could actually take 30 seconds
and make the tool that John Gruber talked about, okay?

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:51.390
So I want to convert this from like this big down to
something that I could actually put on an iPad, all right?

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:58.680
So to make the tool I'm going to
open Automator, launch on O.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.100
Botosan! And here's your blank Automator window.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:11.430
I'm going to create a new service and the service
is going to handle, hmm, movie files in the Finder.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.030
And then I'm going to look for something that does encoding.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.950
Encode Media.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.710
I'm going to add that action into there.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.350
Yes, this does it.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:29.540
And then I'm going to have it Show When Run,
save my service as Movie Bullet Encode Media.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.930
Like that, Save and Quit.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:39.700
Okay, so now when I need to encode a movie file in
the Finder I can just go down here and go Encode Media

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.120
and then say okay, make this for the iPad.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.310
Go. And you can see up at the top
here there's a little spinning gear.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.870
That means that the workflow is processing it.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:59.390
And in a couple of seconds you should, depending upon
the size of this, you should see something over here.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.710
So I made a tool.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.730
[ Applause ]

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.090
You know, how many times do you.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.400
Okay, better move this to the Movies
folder or something, right?

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:13.580
So how many times have you just wanted a quick
tool, quick and easy tool for compressing video?

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.180
Why do I have to open up an application to do that?

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.310
I've got all of Core Video at my disposal.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.950
All you do is open up Automator, set it to
have an input that's a movie file, encode,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.190
show me this when it runs so I can make my settings.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.800
And then you're done.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:37.410
Voila! So there's this simple example of what John was
talking about, of tying into the ability of getting that.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.600
Now let's look at creating an HTML template bundle.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.560
So I'm going to launch a service here that takes
me to various places in the operating system.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.560
And I have a niece, Alice, and that's her.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.100
God bless her.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.030
She's gorgeous.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.020
Look at her.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.800
Look at those eyes.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.890
And she really likes Alice in Wonderland.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.260
That's her favorite book.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:07.160
So I'm going to create a little small Web-App
that I can put up on my MobileMe account

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.720
that she can get to and read Alice in Wonderland.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.510
So I have this image here, so I'm going
to do a couple things to the image

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.640
to make it a little bit more, you know, cooler.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.390
I'm going to first of all apply a
little color sync profile to it.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.610
And so I'm using a service here to make a.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.950
Let's generate a little bit lightness.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.010
Lightness increase?

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.160
Yes, that's good.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.490
Okay, and do it.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.770
Okay, it did it.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:42.560
And then I'm going to apply like
a quartz filter effect to it.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.830
Let's do something like oh, maybe a glow.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:50.720
Get a clean edge on that and go.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.870
Okay. That's good.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.650
And well, as long as I'm doing
that let me put a title on it.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.380
So I'm going to select the text
here of the file, Alice Goes to Tea,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.450
and I'm going to create a banner
image with the selected text.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:10.610
And bring up this Automator action
that basically will let me do this.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.690
I'm going to make it like 128.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.630
Make it blue or lavender.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:19.800
Lavender will do.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.900
And let's set the font for like Hobo.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.390
Okay, that looks pretty good.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.650
Put it on your desktop, open it up.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.420
Yes, very good.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:35.720
So open that and Select All C, V Paste.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.680
Move it over here.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.130
Okay. Good.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.190
Save, Quit.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.420
Okay. So now I have an image.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.790
I have some text here.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.230
Hmm, this is Chapter 7, The Mad Tea Party scene.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.070
That's good reading.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.030
So I'm going to use that.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:58.030
And in addition I also have an audio file.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.100
>> Voiceover: This is a LibriVox recording.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.180
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.400
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.280
>> Voiceover: For more information or to volunteer.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.280
I don't quite understand you, she
said as politely as she could.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.920
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.620
So this is a public domain of that chapter.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:22.770
So it's an AIF file, so I need to compress it to something
I can actually put up there because it's about 180 megs.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.770
So I'm going to go Encode to iTunes Format.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.400
Do a spoken podcast format.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.100
And just go Continue and let that go to work.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.290
So it's working on compressing that right now.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.120
So I'm going to take the, that audio file.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.490
I'm going to take the image, and I'm
going to take this text and convert it

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.550
into using Template Publishing into a single page Web-App.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.870
So I'm going to select all the text here.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:56.990
And then I'm going to hold down the Contextual key and
go hey, create single page Web-App with selected text.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.110
Brings up my interface.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.290
The title is Alice in Wonderland.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.650
I have an O impediment.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:16.060
Subhead is Alice Has Tea With Some Strange Friends.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.450
She'll like that.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.860
Author of course is Lewis Carroll.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.290
And instead of a copyright, I'm using a
creative commons license that I put in here.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:35.020
And I'm going to have, use the image file as in there.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:42.090
And I'm also going to add the audio
file right with it as well.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.930
And let's see, that's it right there.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:52.290
Okay. And give you the description, Chapter 7 From the Book.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.950
And some keywords party, fun.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.230
And I'll leave the type.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.190
Let's see, I'll set the type for the subhead to be 24.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.520
The author, I'll make that 18.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.620
And the story I'm going to put in to
Bradley Hand font and make that 24.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.960
And the background let's use, hmm, oh, Icy Lavender.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.220
All right.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:21.350
Go. So it creates a bundle for me on
the desktop, and then opens up my page.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.460
So now I have.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.110
Can you see that?

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:30.610
I have a scrolling document that's sized to the iPad.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:36.460
And with a creative commons license
built in so that, you know,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:42.070
you can go and tell people that they can use it as well.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.770
And in addition, it also has that audio.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:50.760
>> Voiceover: Let's say, that's the same thing you know.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.200
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.190
So that's what I want.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.710
Now let's take this and I want to
make sure that she can use that.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:02.110
So here's the bundle that was created by this.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.100
And if we look inside the bundle we
can see that it's a small Web-App.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.450
It only has one Index page.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.330
The Index page contains everything.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:14.350
It contains your basic controls for the iPad up here.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.520
It contains your built-in style sheet.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:23.090
And then it contains all the other HTML,
so it's not a lot but it's the principle.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.080
And it contains my Media files.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.990
And it also contains the manifest that tells your
iPad what to cache, so that once she loads it

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.910
on her iPad she can view it later offline as well.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.580
So I can take this folder.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.890
I'm going to rename it Alice.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.920
And now I want to publish this folder.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:52.400
So I'm going to select this and choose Copy to
My MobileMe Site's Folder and Generate An Email.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.500
Okay. And let's watch it work.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:06.110
[ Silence ]

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.340
You never know with MobileMe.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.030
Did it actually do it?

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.990
It should have dismounted that.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:21.210
Okay, it didn't want to do it because I already have it
done because I thought something like this might happen.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:30.520
Okay. So I'm going to go up here and pull up that.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.090
So this is what it'll look like on the iPad, only nice.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.630
Not like that.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.130
So you can scroll.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.500
Yeah!

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.350
[ Applause ]

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.900
You know. And then you have all the
way down and you get this whole thing.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.850
And then there's the creative commons license right there.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.510
And in addition you have the audio,
so I can touch the audio.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.140
Try it again.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.120
There it goes.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.590
>> Voiceover: This is a Libri [inaudible] then.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.290
And said without opening its eyes, of course.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:09.360
>> Sal Soghoian: So I pretty quickly
delivered what I wanted to do.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:16.610
I wanted to create a simple template app that
I can publish easily to have my niece be able

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:21.880
to read and listen to this story as well.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.270
[Background Voiceover] So that's an example.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.950
The principle there, the principles
that are involved with doing

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:32.970
that remain the same whether it's
large or whether it's a small project.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.880
You're creating a basic Web app where you have placeholders.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:43.280
And the automation takes the content, manipulates it the
way it wants to, puts it in the appropriate location.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.410
Takes the interface, takes the
information out of the interface.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.180
Replaces the placeholders with the
information from the interface.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.320
Publishes it and you're done.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.680
For a lot of stuff you're going to do,
especially in education, this is more than enough.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:04.590
This is a really good example of
quick and easy automation techniques.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:11.210
Now what if you want to do something that's
a little bit more involved with more detail?

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:18.800
So let's go back here and go back into this.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.100
So what if I wanted to provide her with something that
was a little bit more than just a simple Web page?

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:30.080
The Web page is nice because it can be
viewed on the computer as well as an iPad.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.720
But what if I wanted to create some type of storage
vehicle for information that she could take with her?

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.130
Well, an eBook is a great way to do that.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.750
But how do you create an eBook?

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:46.740
Uh, I don't know and I don't want to know.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.640
That's the whole thing, is I don't want to know.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.320
I don't really want to know how to write the
HTML but I'm forced to because of my job.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.800
But I just like using these tools of select
this, select that, go, build, all right, done.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.370
So let's take a look at making an eBook.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.370
Ooohhh! This is getting interesting.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.990
>> Attendee: Switch your [inaudible] source.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.810
>> Sal Soghoian: Oh, switch the source.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.340
Okay, yes.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.730
Nope, wrong source.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.990
I'm already done here.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.550
Ah! Okay, so here I have chapters from the book.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:23.460
These are Open Source, you know, chapters from the thing.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.070
I got it. Okay.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:35.680
And I want to create and publish an eBook to
this computer over here to my iPad doing this.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.720
So I'm going to select these three.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.500
Here we go.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.880
Francois, holding on, babe.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.910
Create and Sync Electronic Book.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:51.700
Okay. Title will be Alice in Wonderland.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:58.220
Save as Alice Book on the desktop.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.920
I'm going to first of all add the cover image.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.320
Well, let's search my library for Alices.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.030
What do I got?

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.270
I want the cover image.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.410
This one will be vertical, okay.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.080
Then I want to add some more media.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.860
You know, I'm going to use that movie.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.200
Use that movie that I created.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:20.510
Where is it?

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.500
RabbitHole.m4v.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.130
There it is.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.180
Okay, Add.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.550
And then I'm going to just add every Alice image I have.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.560
All the remaining Alice images,
and let them find their spot.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.850
Select All except for this one, and add all of those guys.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:43.810
And if I lived right, we're going to do it.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.110
So it creates the publication.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.850
It's opening up iTunes.

It should be adding it to iTunes and then doing a sync.

Oh, Pool of Tears.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:43.710
Every chapter begins with an image, so
I'll go back to there and I can turn pages.

Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.040
Okay, very good.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.390
And it even has illustrations, so all the other
images that I put in are at the end of the book.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.360
That's illustrations.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.430
So now I created something that Alice can take with her.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:03.230
I created an eBook.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:09.330
Automated using Services and my Mac.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:15.390
This is how you automate content to get it to these devices.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:16.610
Here's another scenario.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.160
Let's take a look at another one.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.400
Okay. Whew!

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.500
That worked.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.600
That was good.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.020
You never know with demos.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.500

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.280
All right.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.410
So let's look at creating something that's more interactive.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:39.670
That whole interactive kind of thing with the screens
moving back and forth and all the little transitions.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.630
I have some images selected here on my desktop.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.100

I have images selected on the desktop here.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:58.680
Of course they're contextual, so when I go to the
Contextual menu I get the things only dealing with images.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:08.890
While I also have this thing called Create
iPad Photo Web-App and it brings this up.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.400
Background audio, what do I have for audio?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.980
Something called Bubbles.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.480
Yeah, that'll do.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.320
And now my cover I want without a story.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.320
My photo carousel, add the caption data out of the images.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.500
For my text, let's use something fun.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.390

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.570
That's fine.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.370
Title will be Tropical Fish.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:50.750
Let's add some letter space into the title as well.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:57.320
And make it part of my animal project, my animal
kingdom project that I've been working on.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.110
You see the caption data that was extracted from the image?

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.270
If you click the image it goes full screen.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.490
I mercifully didn't loop the background noise.

And back to the Home screen.

on the iPad but I have to turn that.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.200

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.350
A photo carousel template.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:38.950
It's just a little HTML thing, and
then you have full screen style sheet.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:45.590
Back down again and then back to Home.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.350
Then I have a video page I added to this one, Fish Swim.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:55.450
Of course it's all built in so HTML5
handles the going up and down, right?

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.290
I can stop that and go back to my Home screen.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.640
So there's an example of just selecting files.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.420
I could have selected them in iPhoto.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.210
I could have selected them in Aperture or the desktop.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:14.070
And generating this bundle, this HTML
bundle automatically using automation.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.580
So get the idea?

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.430
You basically take some templates.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.200
You write a little bit of code that generates these things.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.100
And you can produce this kind of content quickly.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.800
It's not going to change the world content, but
it's the content that you can use over and over.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:34.640
It's attractive, it's interesting, and
it's a great vehicle for delivering ideas.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.200
All right.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:46.340
So that's some examples of doing basic content creation.

The third thing we were going to
talk about is Interactive Web.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.500
So here's a scenario.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:11.680
[ Audience chuckling ]

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.210
Here's a scenario.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.840
So I have a friend, it's Joe.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.990
Joe is a photographer.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.400
Joe has a bunch of images.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.420
He's working on an ad campaign for a client.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:29.250
He needs to know what images he's going to use in
the ad out of the prospective images that he has.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.680
You know, he's in Cupertino.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.270
He's working away at night.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:43.750
His client, jet setter Francesca, is over in Paris about
to get on board the airline to fly back to the States.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:52.330
So the question is, is how does Joe communicate
the options to Francesca and get her pick

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:55.970
and understand that all within this deadline?

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.090
How do you do this?

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:03.870
Well, you use something called Publish for
Approval, so he's going to do this technique.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.700
What he's going to do is he's going to open up Aperture.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.140
He's going to select the images that he
wants to have his client approve and view.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:17.430
Then he's going to run an AppleScript
application called Publish for Approval.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:24.480
What this application does is it exports the images,
creates a mini website, hosts it in his person,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.290
on his computer in the Web server folder.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.810
Turns on the built-in Apache of Mac OS X.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.290
And then opens up the Web page for him to review.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:39.740
If he likes that, then he just goes up
there, goes Mail a Link to This Page.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:45.840
Creates an e-mail, sends the e-mail message to the client.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.910
Then he goes back to Aperture, creates a Smart
Album looking for a keyword called Approved,

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:56.310
a metadata tag called Approved with a value of True.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.350
That's all he does.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:01.480
So he sets it up, goes have, go gets a donut or coffee.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.160
Or he's eating late so it's probably
mung beans or something.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.130
Who knows.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:10.790
So Francesca meanwhile, who's in Paris,
she gets the e-mail, taps the link.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.390
It opens up to that Web page being served on his machine.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:20.130
She picks the images that she wants
to approve for use in the ad campaign.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.410
Clicks the Submit button.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:28.630
The moment she clicks that button, instantly it transfers
back to his computer and switches the metadata tag

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:33.550
so that he can see live what images are the
ones that the client wants to work with.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.930
He didn't have to call her.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.850
He didn't have to e-mail her low-res
versions of all the images.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.040
He didn't have to try to gen a website.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.850
He didn't have to do any of that.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:46.040
He just ran a simple application that would do that.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:53.890
So in this scenario, the automation not only builds
the website, turns it on on his computer and hosts it.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:48:03.590
But it also acts as a CGI intermediary, so that when
the client responds it triggers something in Aperture.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:04.940
All right.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:11.840
So the first thing I'm going to do is to just make sure my
Web sharing is turned on and this should be interesting.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:18.690
The Apple turned it on, but I'm going
to be a little proactive here with this.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.500
Go Aperture.

This is my collection of tropical fish.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.210

And then I'm going to run this
program called Publish for Approval.

I am going to give the collection ID a unique
identifier that will be used in the URL.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.690
And then title for the Web page will be Tropical Fish.

The automation technologies that are part of Mac OS X
can be used in a variety of ways to produce content,

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:05.460
to become interactive to really make
your life a lot more interesting.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:12.120
So in summary, you can use automation to build stuff.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.110
It makes it easier to create content.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.650
Now you can use it just as yourself as a consumer.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:24.150
Or you can write these tools yourself
to have other people do them.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:29.000
And it's all, everything you're seeing is coming soon.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:37.790
But actually everything you just saw you can have today.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.040
There's a new website.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.430
It's called padilicious.com.

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.150
I put it up just for you guys.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:49.920
P-A-D-I-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.com, Padilicious.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.580
So Padilicious, you're going to go there and
you're going to download the examples I showed you.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.370
You can install them, tear them apart, do whatever you like.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.140
You'll find the single web page thing there.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.820
You'll find the Tropical Fish kind of building thing there.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.040
And soon we'll be putting up the eBook.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.650
The eBook's not quite ready for prime time yet.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.910
Give us a week and we'll have that up.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:19.020
To learn how to do this kind of stuff and how to
create these, or to just go download dozens and dozens

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:25.550
of pre-done services like the ones I used
today, you can go to macosxautomation.com.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.840
That contains three websites, AppleScript,
Automator and Services.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.790
Lots of tutorials, videos.

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:35.830
All the backup stuff that you need is on those two sites.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:36.950
Don't talk to John.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.720
Leave him alone.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.910
Related sessions.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.580
Now there's just so.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:50.490
If you have automation at your back, all of a sudden
all of these sessions become pretty interesting

00:52:50.490 --> 00:53:07.390
because you can use them to create your own templates that
you're going to pre-populate and tear apart and build.
