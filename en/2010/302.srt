>> Francois Jouaux: Welcome to
Automating the Creation of iPad Content,

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,150
Tools for the New Desktop Publishing Revolution.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,770
Wow. Good title like this.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,370
Either they are a car salesman or there's
something really interesting here.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,340
Let's see.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,510
And I forgot my teacup.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:31,370
[ Silence ]

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,140
Hello. I am Francois Jouaux.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,990
I am the Senior Manager of System Tools
at Apple, and also Engineering Manager

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,420
of Automation which means they make me code.

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,290
And what is this session about?

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,300
This session is about the relationship
between automation and iPad content creation.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:02,510
It's about the role automation will have to take in
iPod content creation, and the tools and techniques

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,020
that are available today to simplify your life.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,020
Who is this session for?

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,230
There's a very wide spectrum of people
that want to create content for the iPad.

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,840
These range from students, teachers
that want to publish papers,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,370
that want to publish art, photos,
illustrations to your boss.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,340
People that are coding impaired.

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,460
People unlike you.

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:42,150
You have to relate to these people and help them
distribute and manage the content that they have created

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,130
on the desktop, and that they want to make
available to all the people that have iPads.

23
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,950
This session is about developers
because there is a market for such tools

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,620
that will enable the creativity of all the consumers.

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,520
What you will learn.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,620
You will learn how automation can help you.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,150
You will learn about the automation
technologies available today on Mac OS X.

28
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,590
And how to develop custom content
creation tools using these technologies.

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,730
What are these technologies anyway?

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:30,230
AppleScript is your English-like scripting language
that controls the Mac OS X operating system,

31
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,080
its applications on also third party applications.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
Automator.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,760
Our award winning visual workflow development tool.

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:50,490
With its hundreds of actions allows you
to create powerful recipes and services

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:58,960
since Mac OS X Snow Leopard services put at your
point-of-need contextual menus that allow you.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,930
That gives you the power and the ability
to harness these automation technologies.

37
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:16,510
And to talk to you about this into more detail, dealing
you with some crazy demo, here is Sal who you all know.

38
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,490
[ Applause and cheers ]

39
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,520
>> Sal Soghoian: Sick, sick, sick.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,920
Anybody who gets up at 9:00 in the morning to hear me
talk is insane, so I'm in a roomful of crazy people.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,930
I'm Sal Soghoian.

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,660
I am officially the Product Manager for Automation
Technologies at Apple Computer for the last thirteen years.

43
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,060
And this has been.

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,410
Out of thirteen years of being at Apple, this has been one
of the most exceptional years that I've seen at the company.

45
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:56,780
You know, with the release of the iPad and just all the
changes that are going on, the dramatic movement forward

46
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,560
and pushing the platform and integrating new and
groundbreaking technologies, it's a lot of upheaval,

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,350
a lot of disruption, a lot of creativity.

48
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:13,630
So people might have a question about well, how
does this relate to Mac OS X now that we have iPads?

49
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,830
Well, if history is anything to judge
about what's going to be coming up,

50
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:28,130
we in the automation community are really excited
about our prospects and about what we can do to make

51
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,540
and assist concrete, the creation of
content for the iPad moving forward.

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:41,050
And I'll start by giving you a brief little history
about the concept behind desktop publishing.

53
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,410
Now back in like 1990 or the early '90s,
or the end of whatever decade that was,

54
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:57,490
there was an invention of a new technology called
PostScript which defined the way things looked on a page.

55
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:05,360
And they integrated this technology into printers, laser
printers, into Linotronics, and into the Macintosh.

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,390
And for the first time, using programs like Ready,Set,Go!

57
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,660
and PageMaker, designers and publishers
were able to produce content

58
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,300
that they could never do before in a really timely fashion.

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,030
Because up to this point they were
taking photographs, stripping things in.

60
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,500
They had Hot Type, there were Ruby lists.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,470
A lot of manual effort went in to produce a page.

62
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,040
And suddenly when that moved to the desktop
computer, it enabled a lot of creativity

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,600
and it enabled the faster processing
and turnaround of media.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,990
Around 1993, AppleScript was introduced.

65
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:53,250
And with scriptable programs like QuarkXPress and
FileMaker Pro, all of a sudden we had the ability

66
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,330
to produce content based upon data sources like databases.

67
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,220
So catalogs and different types of
publications that were data intensive,

68
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,490
yet needed precision like weather
maps and stock figures for newspapers.

69
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,220
Those kind of materials could for the time be
produced in a timely fashion and with accuracy.

70
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:24,460
Because what AppleScript and automation delivered
was speed, accuracy, consistency and scalability.

71
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,610
So for the first time companies could scale what they
were doing without having to add a lot of new people

72
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,630
and deal with the aspect of dealing with
humans and time off and all that kind of stuff.

73
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:43,700
So this was a groundbreaking point when automation and
publishing combined for the first time electronically.

74
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,020
About the beginning of the last
decade of the last millennium.

75
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,610
Ooh, I like that.

76
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,790
Last millennium.

77
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,250
The Internet really boomed and started
becoming a commercial entity where people,

78
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,670
the focus on it was no longer this,
you know, creative education community.

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,120
And became wait a second, this thing is really big.

80
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,010
We need to communicate, we need to get our message out.

81
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,520
I need to tell you something.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,020
I need to hear this.

83
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,920
And it really became a lot about communication.

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,860
So technologies were developed
like CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.

85
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,150
RSS, XML, and other Internet technologies joined HTML.

86
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,540
And really allowed the Internet to start
becoming a platform for development.

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,590
Again, automation played a role in that because with
AppleScript and tools like Automator, suddenly media,

88
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,530
being able to produce media in a timely fashion
and get it out to the public through podcasts,

89
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,710
audio and video podcasts, became possible.

90
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,260
So the concept that had started earlier in the mid
'90s is now coming to fruition and growing more

91
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,120
and more because the demand for content increased.

92
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,030
And here we are now at the beginning of this decade
and they've turbocharged some of the technologies

93
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,740
that they introduced for the Internet
like cascading style sheets and HTML5.

94
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,420
And they enhanced their abilities
to take it into the next decade.

95
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,720
Well, the same happened with automation.

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,260
With Snow Leopard we introduced something very dramatic.

97
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,750
It's called AppleScript Objective-C.

98
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,040
And for the first time AppleScript could
talk directly to the Cocoa frameworks.

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,630
So anything that is possible to be called from a
Cocoa app can now be called from AppleScript directly.

100
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,920
And this, combined with our revolutionary new
Services architecture that puts these tools

101
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,800
at the point-of-need contextually throughout
the OS, this really set it up for the delivery

102
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,420
of content to a whole new series of devices.

103
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:51,260
So as you can see throughout the whole electronic history,
automation has played a role in delivering content.

104
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,090
And if this is true, I have a feeling that
it's going to pertain and producing content

105
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,490
for the devices moving forward just the same way.

106
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,470
Because this device is going to spur a whole
new wave of desktop publishing revolution.

107
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,620
A whole new wave of content creation.

108
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,010
You're here because of that.

109
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,890
You're learning how to produce content.

110
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,990
You're learning how to create apps that
absorb content or deal with content.

111
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,390
So let's take a look at this device.

112
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,010
By itself, it's just a really handsome well-designed tool.

113
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,260
It doesn't have impact until you put something on it.

114
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,190
And then you can become, it becomes
a device that can inform.

115
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:49,800
It becomes a device that can find and locate
things, and help you get through and navigate.

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,640
It also becomes a device that helps you remember.

117
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,910
These are a couple friends of mine I lost this last year.

118
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,780
That's Leroy Moore and George Melvin, so that's to you guys.

119
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,230
So you can remember.

120
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:09,880
You can have photographs and videos that
help you see part of into your life.

121
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,510
And you can also use the device for
education as well with iTunes U,

122
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,540
and with third-party software like
MathBoard from Pala Software.

123
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,200
So the device, it's really the content that
makes this device important and makes it happen.

124
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:37,080
It's a great device, but without the content that
you produce and others produce it's just a device.

125
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,390
So how do you get content onto the iPod, iPad, iPod, iPad.

126
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,030
Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh.

127
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,980
So let's take a look at some of the ways.

128
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,150
First of all, you can make a native app, right?

129
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,570
You can write an app and the app
can have, deliver its own content.

130
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,510
So you've seen things like, you know, USA Today has an app
and it gets content and displays it from within its own app.

131
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,810
We know about that.

132
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,860
You can also have productivity
applications like the iWork Suited Tools.

133
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,760
Or like Omni's programs where you
can create and share files.

134
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,890
And that's one way to get content between different iPads.

135
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,500
There's also electronic books.

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,200
You can deliver those through commercial
publishers and through the iBook Store.

137
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:33,140
Or you can use the open and free EPUB format and
create your own, and distribute those as well.

138
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,120
But one of the most exciting things
is, of course, podcasts keep.

139
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,900
You can now take podcasts and enhance them.

140
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,110
They're much more visually exciting, and
you can convey the messages a lot easier now

141
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,050
on an iPad because they're portable.

142
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,290
And one of the most exciting things that's now
available is this whole discussion of HTML5.

143
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,190
You know that a lot of the classes that
you've been seeing here are all about HTML5.

144
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:06,410
Well, we're going to look at how automation
plays a role in HTML5 and how, how can auto.

145
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,880
How can you automate the creation of HTML content?

146
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,880
So we're going to look at a couple different scenarios.

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,940
We're going to look at contextual tools.

148
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,020
What kind of automation tools can you have that
make it easier for you to process the materials

149
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,890
that you are going to put together and send to an iPad?

150
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,370
How do you deal with media?

151
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,580
How do you deal with compression of audio and video?

152
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,600
How do you deal with manipulating images?

153
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,580
How do you deal with talking to
databases and grabbing information?

154
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,450
So we're going to look at contextual tools, automated
tools that allow you to do these kind of things.

155
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,390
Then we're going to look at a technique
called Template Publishing.

156
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:55,350
This was first designed back in the '90s where
they were automating the creation of catalogs.

157
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,620
But the principles remain the same.

158
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,540
It's just at different destinations.

159
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,100
Instead of going to print, we're
now going to an HTML bundle.

160
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:11,540
But the principles about how you could take a template and
populate it instantly through automation remain the same.

161
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,250
And we're going to a look at a couple of those examples.

162
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,750
And then finally we're going to look at an interactive
Web example where automation not only creates the content,

163
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,150
but publishes it across the Internet and then responds
to the users when they interact with that content.

164
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,920
So those are three scenarios we're going to
look at in this short period of time today.

165
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,160
And the technologies we're going to look at, we're
going to examine that do this are of course Automator,

166
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,860
AppleScript, AppleScript Objective-C and Services.

167
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,320
So let's talk about contextual tools.

168
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,430
This is a great quote.

169
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,620
This was a Tweet from John.

170
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,620
I heart Automator.

171
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:03,630
Thought to myself wish I had a droplet that could
turn high-res H.264 into Apple TV-size H.264.

172
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,980
Took thirty seconds to make one.

173
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,840
John was talking about of course this technology, Automator.

174
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,000
We introduced Automator way back in Tiger.

175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,190
But it's steadily progressed.

176
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:24,770
And what it does, it's a tool for visually
creating automation recipes called workflows

177
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,360
by joining together little nuggets of
pre-done automation called actions.

178
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,770
Now these actions are installed in the operating
system, and by default they have hundreds installed.

179
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,730
But you can download thousands of
third-party ones or create them yourself.

180
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:48,210
Because they're just Xcode projects that are written in
any of the languages supported by the operating system.

181
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,780
So if you write Objective-C or
AppleScript, Shell, Ruby, PERL, Python,

182
00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:00,840
whatever code works on Mac OS X you can
use to create your own Automator actions.

183
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,530
And we're going to look at that.

184
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,630
And they're based upon a simple principle
that you've seen over and over and over again.

185
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm by law required to do this slide, so
here's the frameworks of the operating system.

186
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,230
The applications sit on top of the frameworks.

187
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,520
The user triggers the applications
to talk to the system frameworks.

188
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,650
And then that does something good for the user.

189
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,920
We've seen this over and over.

190
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,890
You design an application, it might
be an image manipulation application.

191
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,750
It talks to Core Image.

192
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,470
And then does something to the
image that the user wants, right?

193
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,350
Basic concept.

194
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,700
We understand this.

195
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,960
But what you might not know is that Services
can do the same thing as an application.

196
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,850
When you write one of those Automator actions, it talks
to the frameworks the same way that an application does.

197
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,300
There's no framework that the application
can get at that the service can't get at.

198
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,180
So in many ways they're like mini apps themselves.

199
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,810
But one other thing in addition is
that they can control applications.

200
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,930
So a service can interact with an application
and get the application to do something,

201
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,290
as well as talk to the frameworks in the operating system.

202
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,870
They're really powerful.

203
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:21,580
So you can gain access to all the different
abilities of the operating system through Automator.

204
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,620
That includes applications, it
includes the command line, Core Video,

205
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,810
Core Audio, Core Data, Core, Core, Core, Core, Core.

206
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,820
And even the media frameworks.

207
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,810
All of that's exposed to you when
you write an Automator action.

208
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,790
Then once you've created these, you
can expose them through Services.

209
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,940
Services is the architecture that provides
point-of-need access to the power of the OS.

210
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:56,210
So up in the Services menu, in the Application
menu you have the ability to access Services.

211
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:03,390
In the Finder, in the Action menu you can access
Services contextually based upon what you have selected.

212
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,600
The same with the contextual menu in the Finder,
or the contextual menu in other applications.

213
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,180
So if you have text selected, you only
see the services that pertain to text.

214
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,520
Or pertain to the type of text that you're looking for.

215
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,820
So no longer do you have to open up an
image in an application to rotate it

216
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,360
or apply effects to it or do anything else to it.

217
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,470
Because all of that ability that's part of the operating
system can now be exposed contextually at the point-of-need.

218
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,910
You can be in an application like Mail, look
for a certain kind of data like an address,

219
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,580
and tell Mail to make a new document
with that and pre-address it.

220
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,980
No longer do you have to write a plug-in to Mail to do that,

221
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,270
because the Services architecture gives you contextual
access to whatever is selected in the application.

222
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,160
And then you can apply that power to it.

223
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,200
And you can do way beyond what a browser plug-in can do.

224
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,990
You can select data in one form,
transform it into another form.

225
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,020
Take it to a different application and put it into that
application as I just did here by selecting Table Data

226
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,070
in Safari, turning it into a pie
chart that I put into pages.

227
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,270
This goes way beyond being just a browser extension.

228
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,420
You have total access to the entire OS,
and you're only limited by your creativity.

229
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:32,560
So tools for content preparation is talking about creating
these kind of contextual tools and using these kind

230
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,470
of contextual tools that manipulate the content, the
raw content in preparation for getting it to the iPad.

231
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,680
Make sense?

232
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,840
Hmm-hmm-hmm?

233
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
Okay, good.

234
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,110
Now HTML Template Publishing.

235
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,500
Simple concept.

236
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,730
Basic concept.

237
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,400
It's been used for out, since the Egyptian
used cuneiform they used template publishing.

238
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
It's a basic concept.

239
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,670
Once you understand it you can spend
a lot of money on pre-done systems

240
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,970
that do exactly the same thing that you can do yourself.

241
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,380
And it's about taking something that you're going
to use over and over, and making it generic enough

242
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,190
that you can replace certain things inside of
that template to end with a finished product.

243
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,810
Not everything about content is hand done.

244
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,620
We don't do one-offs for every kind of thing that we do.

245
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,520
There's a lot of templates that
we use in life that we're used to.

246
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,320
And as long as they're attractive and functional and
they serve the users by having a decent interface,

247
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,500
we're very happy as consumers to use templates.

248
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,770
And you can automate them.

249
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,870
They're great for automation.

250
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,810
So here's a scenario of why is that important?

251
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,810
Welcome to the classroom of the future.

252
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,750
You notice everybody sitting there with their iPad, right?

253
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,890
And so there's our teacher.

254
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,370
She's from like 1800.

255
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,580
And she's wondering well, how do I get content?

256
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,870
I want to create this little thing
and deliver it to their iPads.

257
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,950
How do I do that?

258
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,880
And the students are saying the same thing.

259
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,560
They're going hey, how do we take
my little report and my photos

260
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,240
and my little video and deliver that as content to the iPad?

261
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,610
Do I write an app and then submit that to the store?

262
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,110
Or, you know, like exactly how do you do this?

263
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,020
And this is where template publishing
can really come into play.

264
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:36,860
Because you can take the raw content, the stories, the
videos, the audio clips, all of that kind of stuff,

265
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:44,380
and using Services you can convert them
into Web-Apps which are just HTML bundles

266
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,000
that you can automatically upload to
a server like your MobileMe account.

267
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,090
And then thwat!

268
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,880
It shows right up on the iPad as a
full screen interactive type of thing.

269
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,540
So we're going to look at one of
those scenarios of how that's done.

270
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,250
Especially with the single view apps.

271
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:08,860
So the first template that we created for
you was this one of just a single page.

272
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,980
I have a report.

273
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,220
I have a flowing text document.

274
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,340
I want to display that on the iPad.

275
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,070
Oh, and I want to add an image or maybe an audio clip, okay?

276
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,300
That's about it.

277
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,270
I just want it to be quick and
dirty, but to have it look nice,

278
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,810
be accessible to anybody with a Web browser or with an iPad.

279
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,090
So this is an example we're going to look at.

280
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,300
Then we're also going to look at
if you want more interactivity.

281
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,610
What if you want something that has
different screens and different views?

282
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,520
And you can navigate it and it acts
just like a regular functional app.

283
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,840
Can something as complex as this be automated?

284
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:58,910
Yes, because this is just basically a template and you
populate it with certain materials and media files.

285
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,630
And it becomes a functional app, so
that you have this beautiful interface.

286
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,540
And it begins with three different technologies.

287
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,970
The first is HTML5.

288
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:19,090
You can think of HTML5 as like when you're building a
building and you have a metal steel frame it hangs onto.

289
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,210
It provides the foundation that
this app is going to hang onto.

290
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,380
It has video and audio support through the video/audio tags.

291
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,100
It has Web font integration, scalable vector graphics,

292
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,290
and canvas support too so you can have
that interactive canvas thing in HTML.

293
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,740
I stole these from Darren.

294
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,980
Darren, if you're out there don't be mad at me.

295
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:50,720
And of course it reuses WebKit, that set of APIs that
provides all the interactive transitions like you saw.

296
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,460
The fades, the twistings, the, you
know, special effects, the dissolves.

297
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,020
All that kind of stuff is done with WebKit.

298
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,520
So the first technology that we use that
we're going to automate is this HTML5.

299
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,280
The second one is cascading style sheets.

300
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,770
Now we're used to the idea that style
sheets control type, on how type looks.

301
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,930
But style sheets also control positional.

302
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,530
So they can control where things
are located on the document as well.

303
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,010
And apply effects to the objects that are in there.

304
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:30,070
And the third technology is the wiring and it's JavaScript.

305
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,250
And it's for when you click a button, that sends
the signal down the wire to a JavaScript controller

306
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,070
that triggers the CSS transforms that
make something happen on the computer.

307
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,820
So that's the basic structure of what
goes on with these type of bundles.

308
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,150
All of those files live in a folder.

309
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,810
You've got your JavaScript.

310
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,710
You've got your CSS, your HTML.

311
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,830
All the media in there.

312
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,580
Everything lives in this folder, and it becomes
this little interactive website called the Web-App.

313
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:05,490
But for the user all they're going to do is just
select Images or something, and bring up an interface.

314
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:12,410
You're going to wire up this interface so
that when they choose a setting that setting,

315
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,140
each one replaces some placeholder in the template.

316
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,250
So you're going to replace the letter space
placeholder with the value of that control.

317
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,790
And we're going to use Cocoa bindings
and all that kind of stuff to do that.

318
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:33,160
And then those values control how the media
is finally displayed with the thing itself.

319
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,060
So the steps to develop your own
content creation tools, very simple.

320
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,720
One, you design and build your HTML template.

321
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,660
You basically steal anything that you like.

322
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,320
You go out there, you look at it and go
oh, I like the way he does this or --

323
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:53,370
and you basically take your HTML kind of designs
and you insert at key points placeholders.

324
00:24:53,370 --> 00:25:00,850
Then second, you create an interface that's going to
gather the media and gather the settings from the user.

325
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,650
Now if you're creating a service the media
is automatically passed into your service

326
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,830
so you don't have to do anything special for that.

327
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:16,270
Third, then you're going to add the code inside of
your little control for replacing the placeholders

328
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,930
and scaling the media or doing whatever
processing you need to do to it.

329
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:27,280
So let's take a look at the contextual tools and
this thing of HTML plumbing.

330
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,090
Is this semi-interesting?

331
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,700
>> Audience: Yes!

332
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,520
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

333
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,290
[ Applause ]

334
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,620
So here's a video clip on my desktop.

335
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,970
I just wanted to see if I could actually take 30 seconds
and make the tool that John Gruber talked about, okay?

336
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:51,390
So I want to convert this from like this big down to
something that I could actually put on an iPad, all right?

337
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:58,680
So to make the tool I'm going to
open Automator, launch on O.

338
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,100
Botosan! And here's your blank Automator window.

339
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:11,430
I'm going to create a new service and the service
is going to handle, hmm, movie files in the Finder.

340
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,030
And then I'm going to look for something that does encoding.

341
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,950
Encode Media.

342
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,710
I'm going to add that action into there.

343
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,350
Yes, this does it.

344
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:29,540
And then I'm going to have it Show When Run,
save my service as Movie Bullet Encode Media.

345
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,930
Like that, Save and Quit.

346
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:39,700
Okay, so now when I need to encode a movie file in
the Finder I can just go down here and go Encode Media

347
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,120
and then say okay, make this for the iPad.

348
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,310
Go. And you can see up at the top
here there's a little spinning gear.

349
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,870
That means that the workflow is processing it.

350
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:59,390
And in a couple of seconds you should, depending upon
the size of this, you should see something over here.

351
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,710
So I made a tool.

352
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,730
[ Applause ]

353
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,090
You know, how many times do you.

354
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,400
Okay, better move this to the Movies
folder or something, right?

355
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,580
So how many times have you just wanted a quick
tool, quick and easy tool for compressing video?

356
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,180
Why do I have to open up an application to do that?

357
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,310
I've got all of Core Video at my disposal.

358
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,950
All you do is open up Automator, set it to
have an input that's a movie file, encode,

359
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,190
show me this when it runs so I can make my settings.

360
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,800
And then you're done.

361
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:37,410
Voila! So there's this simple example of what John was
talking about, of tying into the ability of getting that.

362
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,600
Now let's look at creating an HTML template bundle.

363
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,560
So I'm going to launch a service here that takes
me to various places in the operating system.

364
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,560
And I have a niece, Alice, and that's her.

365
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,100
God bless her.

366
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,030
She's gorgeous.

367
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,020
Look at her.

368
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,800
Look at those eyes.

369
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,890
And she really likes Alice in Wonderland.

370
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,260
That's her favorite book.

371
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:07,160
So I'm going to create a little small Web-App
that I can put up on my MobileMe account

372
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,720
that she can get to and read Alice in Wonderland.

373
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,510
So I have this image here, so I'm going
to do a couple things to the image

374
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,640
to make it a little bit more, you know, cooler.

375
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,390
I'm going to first of all apply a
little color sync profile to it.

376
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,610
And so I'm using a service here to make a.

377
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,950
Let's generate a little bit lightness.

378
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,010
Lightness increase?

379
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes, that's good.

380
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,490
Okay, and do it.

381
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,770
Okay, it did it.

382
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,560
And then I'm going to apply like
a quartz filter effect to it.

383
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,830
Let's do something like oh, maybe a glow.

384
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,720
Get a clean edge on that and go.

385
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,870
Okay. That's good.

386
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,650
And well, as long as I'm doing
that let me put a title on it.

387
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,380
So I'm going to select the text
here of the file, Alice Goes to Tea,

388
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,450
and I'm going to create a banner
image with the selected text.

389
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,610
And bring up this Automator action
that basically will let me do this.

390
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,690
I'm going to make it like 128.

391
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,630
Make it blue or lavender.

392
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,800
Lavender will do.

393
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,900
And let's set the font for like Hobo.

394
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,390
Okay, that looks pretty good.

395
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,650
Put it on your desktop, open it up.

396
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,420
Yes, very good.

397
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,720
So open that and Select All C, V Paste.

398
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,680
Move it over here.

399
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,130
Okay. Good.

400
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,190
Save, Quit.

401
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,420
Okay. So now I have an image.

402
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,790
I have some text here.

403
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,230
Hmm, this is Chapter 7, The Mad Tea Party scene.

404
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,070
That's good reading.

405
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,030
So I'm going to use that.

406
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,030
And in addition I also have an audio file.

407
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,100
>> Voiceover: This is a LibriVox recording.

408
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,180
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.

409
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,400
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

410
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,280
>> Voiceover: For more information or to volunteer.

411
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,280
I don't quite understand you, she
said as politely as she could.

412
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,920
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

413
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,620
So this is a public domain of that chapter.

414
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:22,770
So it's an AIF file, so I need to compress it to something
I can actually put up there because it's about 180 megs.

415
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,770
So I'm going to go Encode to iTunes Format.

416
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,400
Do a spoken podcast format.

417
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,100
And just go Continue and let that go to work.

418
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,290
So it's working on compressing that right now.

419
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,120
So I'm going to take the, that audio file.

420
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,490
I'm going to take the image, and I'm
going to take this text and convert it

421
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,550
into using Template Publishing into a single page Web-App.

422
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,870
So I'm going to select all the text here.

423
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:56,990
And then I'm going to hold down the Contextual key and
go hey, create single page Web-App with selected text.

424
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,110
Brings up my interface.

425
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,290
The title is Alice in Wonderland.

426
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,650
I have an O impediment.

427
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:16,060
Subhead is Alice Has Tea With Some Strange Friends.

428
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,450
She'll like that.

429
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,860
Author of course is Lewis Carroll.

430
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,290
And instead of a copyright, I'm using a
creative commons license that I put in here.

431
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:35,020
And I'm going to have, use the image file as in there.

432
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:42,090
And I'm also going to add the audio
file right with it as well.

433
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,930
And let's see, that's it right there.

434
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:52,290
Okay. And give you the description, Chapter 7 From the Book.

435
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:56,950
And some keywords party, fun.

436
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,230
And I'll leave the type.

437
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,190
Let's see, I'll set the type for the subhead to be 24.

438
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,520
The author, I'll make that 18.

439
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,620
And the story I'm going to put in to
Bradley Hand font and make that 24.

440
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,960
And the background let's use, hmm, oh, Icy Lavender.

441
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,220
All right.

442
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:21,350
Go. So it creates a bundle for me on
the desktop, and then opens up my page.

443
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,460
So now I have.

444
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,110
Can you see that?

445
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:30,610
I have a scrolling document that's sized to the iPad.

446
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:36,460
And with a creative commons license
built in so that, you know,

447
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,070
you can go and tell people that they can use it as well.

448
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,770
And in addition, it also has that audio.

449
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:50,760
>> Voiceover: Let's say, that's the same thing you know.

450
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,200
>> Sal Soghoian: Okay.

451
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,190
So that's what I want.

452
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,710
Now let's take this and I want to
make sure that she can use that.

453
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:02,110
So here's the bundle that was created by this.

454
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,100
And if we look inside the bundle we
can see that it's a small Web-App.

455
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,450
It only has one Index page.

456
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,330
The Index page contains everything.

457
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,350
It contains your basic controls for the iPad up here.

458
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,520
It contains your built-in style sheet.

459
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:23,090
And then it contains all the other HTML,
so it's not a lot but it's the principle.

460
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,080
And it contains my Media files.

461
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,990
And it also contains the manifest that tells your
iPad what to cache, so that once she loads it

462
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,910
on her iPad she can view it later offline as well.

463
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,580
So I can take this folder.

464
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,890
I'm going to rename it Alice.

465
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,920
And now I want to publish this folder.

466
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:52,400
So I'm going to select this and choose Copy to
My MobileMe Site's Folder and Generate An Email.

467
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,500
Okay. And let's watch it work.

468
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:06,110
[ Silence ]

469
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,340
You never know with MobileMe.

470
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,030
Did it actually do it?

471
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,990
It should have dismounted that.

472
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:21,210
Okay, it didn't want to do it because I already have it
done because I thought something like this might happen.

473
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:30,520
Okay. So I'm going to go up here and pull up that.

474
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,090
So this is what it'll look like on the iPad, only nice.

475
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,630
Not like that.

476
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,130
So you can scroll.

477
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,500
Yeah!

478
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,350
[ Applause ]

479
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,900
You know. And then you have all the
way down and you get this whole thing.

480
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,850
And then there's the creative commons license right there.

481
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,510
And in addition you have the audio,
so I can touch the audio.

482
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,140
Try it again.

483
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,120
There it goes.

484
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,590
>> Voiceover: This is a Libri [inaudible] then.

485
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,290
And said without opening its eyes, of course.

486
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,360
>> Sal Soghoian: So I pretty quickly
delivered what I wanted to do.

487
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,610
I wanted to create a simple template app that
I can publish easily to have my niece be able

488
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:21,880
to read and listen to this story as well.

489
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,270
[Background Voiceover] So that's an example.

490
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,950
The principle there, the principles
that are involved with doing

491
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,970
that remain the same whether it's
large or whether it's a small project.

492
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,880
You're creating a basic Web app where you have placeholders.

493
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,280
And the automation takes the content, manipulates it the
way it wants to, puts it in the appropriate location.

494
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,410
Takes the interface, takes the
information out of the interface.

495
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,180
Replaces the placeholders with the
information from the interface.

496
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,320
Publishes it and you're done.

497
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,680
For a lot of stuff you're going to do,
especially in education, this is more than enough.

498
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,590
This is a really good example of
quick and easy automation techniques.

499
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:11,210
Now what if you want to do something that's
a little bit more involved with more detail?

500
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:18,800
So let's go back here and go back into this.

501
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,100
So what if I wanted to provide her with something that
was a little bit more than just a simple Web page?

502
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,080
The Web page is nice because it can be
viewed on the computer as well as an iPad.

503
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,720
But what if I wanted to create some type of storage
vehicle for information that she could take with her?

504
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,130
Well, an eBook is a great way to do that.

505
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,750
But how do you create an eBook?

506
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,740
Uh, I don't know and I don't want to know.

507
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,640
That's the whole thing, is I don't want to know.

508
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,320
I don't really want to know how to write the
HTML but I'm forced to because of my job.

509
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,800
But I just like using these tools of select
this, select that, go, build, all right, done.

510
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,370
So let's take a look at making an eBook.

511
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,370
Ooohhh! This is getting interesting.

512
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,990
>> Attendee: Switch your [inaudible] source.

513
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,810
>> Sal Soghoian: Oh, switch the source.

514
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,340
Okay, yes.

515
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,730
Nope, wrong source.

516
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,990
I'm already done here.

517
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,550
Ah! Okay, so here I have chapters from the book.

518
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:23,460
These are Open Source, you know, chapters from the thing.

519
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,070
I got it. Okay.

520
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:35,680
And I want to create and publish an eBook to
this computer over here to my iPad doing this.

521
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,720
So I'm going to select these three.

522
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,500
Here we go.

523
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,880
Francois, holding on, babe.

524
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,910
Create and Sync Electronic Book.

525
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,700
Okay. Title will be Alice in Wonderland.

526
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:58,220
Save as Alice Book on the desktop.

527
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm going to first of all add the cover image.

528
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,320
Well, let's search my library for Alices.

529
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,030
What do I got?

530
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,270
I want the cover image.

531
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,410
This one will be vertical, okay.

532
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,080
Then I want to add some more media.

533
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,860
You know, I'm going to use that movie.

534
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,200
Use that movie that I created.

535
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,510
Where is it?

536
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,500
RabbitHole.m4v.

537
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,130
There it is.

538
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,180
Okay, Add.

539
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,550
And then I'm going to just add every Alice image I have.

540
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,560
All the remaining Alice images,
and let them find their spot.

541
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,850
Select All except for this one, and add all of those guys.

542
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,810
And if I lived right, we're going to do it.

543
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,110
So it creates the publication.

544
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,850
It's opening up iTunes.

545
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,240
It should be adding it to iTunes and then doing a sync.

546
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:01,910
And then na-na-na-na-na-na.

547
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,500
Nope. Boy, this is living large.

548
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,190
[ Silence ]

549
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,570
Whoa! You see that?

550
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,500
>> Attendee: Yeah, we do!

551
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:21,300
[ Applause ]

552
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,540
>> Sal Soghoian: This is what happens
when you live on the bleeding edge.

553
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,700
Ah! All right.

554
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,390
Whoa, down the Rabbit Hole.

555
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,900
Cool. Have video.

556
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,840
Okay, let's go to my chapters.

557
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,360
Oh, Pool of Tears.

558
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,710
Every chapter begins with an image, so
I'll go back to there and I can turn pages.

559
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,850
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

560
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,040
Okay, very good.

561
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,390
And it even has illustrations, so all the other
images that I put in are at the end of the book.

562
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,360
That's illustrations.

563
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,430
So now I created something that Alice can take with her.

564
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,230
I created an eBook.

565
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,330
Automated using Services and my Mac.

566
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:15,390
This is how you automate content to get it to these devices.

567
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,610
Here's another scenario.

568
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,160
Let's take a look at another one.

569
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,400
Okay. Whew!

570
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,500
That worked.

571
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,600
That was good.

572
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,020
You never know with demos.

573
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,500
You know how it is.

574
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,280
All right.

575
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,410
So let's look at creating something that's more interactive.

576
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:39,670
That whole interactive kind of thing with the screens
moving back and forth and all the little transitions.

577
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,630
I have some images selected here on my desktop.

578
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,100
I'm going.

579
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,940
>> Attendee: [Inaudible].

580
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,240
>> Sal Soghoian: Switch.

581
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,640
Thank you.

582
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:52,370
I have images selected on the desktop here.

583
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:58,680
Of course they're contextual, so when I go to the
Contextual menu I get the things only dealing with images.

584
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:08,890
While I also have this thing called Create
iPad Photo Web-App and it brings this up.

585
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,160
First image file, whatever you want.

586
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,400
Background audio, what do I have for audio?

587
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,980
Something called Bubbles.

588
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,480
Yeah, that'll do.

589
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,320
And now my cover I want without a story.

590
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,320
My photo carousel, add the caption data out of the images.

591
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,500
For my text, let's use something fun.

592
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,390
Party 72, make it yellow.

593
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,490
The byline, make it Bradley Hand 18.

594
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,600
Captions, let's make that Bradley Hand too, 14.

595
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,570
That's fine.

596
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,370
Title will be Tropical Fish.

597
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:50,750
Let's add some letter space into the title as well.

And make it part of my animal project, my animal
kingdom project that I've been working on.

And a description, Pretty Pictures of Fish.

603
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:23,870
Whoo! Go. Again, a bundle's made on my desktop.

604
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:30,140
And I get something looking like this.

605
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,500
So I have a little button for.

606

[ Bubble sounds ]

607
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,770
So I can navigate this, right?

608
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,110
You see the caption data that was extracted from the image?

609
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,270
If you click the image it goes full screen.

610
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,490
I mercifully didn't loop the background noise.

611
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,260
See? And back and forth like that, right?

612
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,360
And back to the Home screen.

613
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,500
Now I have a version of that over here
on the iPad but I have to turn that.

614
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,500
[ Silence ]

615
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,290
Okay. Pat, I need the audio.

616
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,100
Play the audio so you can hear it.

617
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,260
[Bubble sounds] All right.

618
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,910
It works, right?

619
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,260
[Bubble sounds] Look.

620
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,200
All right.

621
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:29,290
So now I can go and I can scroll the text there, touch here.

622
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,340
A template.

623
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,350
A photo carousel template.

624
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:38,950
It's just a little HTML thing, and
then you have full screen style sheet.

625
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:45,590
Back down again and then back to Home.

626
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,350
Then I have a video page I added to this one, Fish Swim.

627
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:55,450
Of course it's all built in so HTML5
handles the going up and down, right?

628
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,290
I can stop that and go back to my Home screen.

629
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,640
So there's an example of just selecting files.

630
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,420
I could have selected them in iPhoto.

631
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,210
I could have selected them in Aperture or the desktop.

632
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:14,070
And generating this bundle, this HTML
bundle automatically using automation.

633
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,580
So get the idea?

634
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,430
You basically take some templates.

635
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,200
You write a little bit of code that generates these things.

636
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,100
And you can produce this kind of content quickly.

637
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:28,800
It's not going to change the world content, but
it's the content that you can use over and over.

638
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,640
It's attractive, it's interesting, and
it's a great vehicle for delivering ideas.

639
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
All right.

640
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:46,340
So that's some examples of doing basic content creation.

641
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,030
The third thing we were going to
talk about is Interactive Web.

642
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,700
Now this I'm really standing out
on the edge with this because I'm,

643
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,150
this is actually going to be live
over the network and, you know.

644
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,420
You know how those kind of things go, right?

645
00:44:59,420 --> 00:44:59,690
All right.

646
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,110
All of you turn off everything you got.

647
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,410
I don't care what everyone.

648
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,000
All right.

649
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,500
So here's a scenario.

650
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,680
[ Audience chuckling ]

651
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,210
Here's a scenario.

652
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,840
So I have a friend, it's Joe.

653
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,990
Joe is a photographer.

654
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,400
Joe has a bunch of images.

655
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,420
He's working on an ad campaign for a client.

656
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:29,250
He needs to know what images he's going to use in
the ad out of the prospective images that he has.

657
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,680
You know, he's in Cupertino.

658
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,270
He's working away at night.

659
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:43,750
His client, jet setter Francesca, is over in Paris about
to get on board the airline to fly back to the States.

660
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:52,330
So the question is, is how does Joe communicate
the options to Francesca and get her pick

661
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,970
and understand that all within this deadline?

662
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,090
How do you do this?

663
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:03,870
Well, you use something called Publish for
Approval, so he's going to do this technique.

664
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,700
What he's going to do is he's going to open up Aperture.

665
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,140
He's going to select the images that he
wants to have his client approve and view.

666
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,430
Then he's going to run an AppleScript
application called Publish for Approval.

667
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:24,480
What this application does is it exports the images,
creates a mini website, hosts it in his person,

668
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,290
on his computer in the Web server folder.

669
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,810
Turns on the built-in Apache of Mac OS X.

670
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,290
And then opens up the Web page for him to review.

671
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,740
If he likes that, then he just goes up
there, goes Mail a Link to This Page.

672
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:45,840
Creates an e-mail, sends the e-mail message to the client.

673
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:51,910
Then he goes back to Aperture, creates a Smart
Album looking for a keyword called Approved,

674
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:56,310
a metadata tag called Approved with a value of True.

675
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,350
That's all he does.

676
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,480
So he sets it up, goes have, go gets a donut or coffee.

677
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,160
Or he's eating late so it's probably
mung beans or something.

678
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,130
Who knows.

679
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,790
So Francesca meanwhile, who's in Paris,
she gets the e-mail, taps the link.

680
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,390
It opens up to that Web page being served on his machine.

681
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:20,130
She picks the images that she wants
to approve for use in the ad campaign.

682
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,410
Clicks the Submit button.

683
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:28,630
The moment she clicks that button, instantly it transfers
back to his computer and switches the metadata tag

684
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,550
so that he can see live what images are the
ones that the client wants to work with.

685
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,930
He didn't have to call her.

686
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,850
He didn't have to e-mail her low-res
versions of all the images.

687
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,040
He didn't have to try to gen a website.

688
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,850
He didn't have to do any of that.

689
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:46,040
He just ran a simple application that would do that.

690
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:53,890
So in this scenario, the automation not only builds
the website, turns it on on his computer and hosts it.

691
00:47:53,890 --> 00:48:03,590
But it also acts as a CGI intermediary, so that when
the client responds it triggers something in Aperture.

692
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,940
All right.

693
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:11,840
So the first thing I'm going to do is to just make sure my
Web sharing is turned on and this should be interesting.

694
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:18,690
The Apple turned it on, but I'm going
to be a little proactive here with this.

695
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,500
Go Aperture.

Okay. I don't want to import from the iPad.

698
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,720
So I have Tropical Fish here.

699
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,100
This is my collection of tropical fish.

700
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,210
Very good.

701
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,740
And then I'm going to run this
program called Publish for Approval.

702
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:49,340
I am going to give the collection ID a unique
identifier that will be used in the URL.

703
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,690
And then title for the Web page will be Tropical Fish.

704
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,500

There's the banner image.

708
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,660
And I want the export size to be like 1024 published for me.

709
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,980
So it's preparing the project folder, the Web folder.

710
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,710
It's exporting all the images in there.

Thank you.

739
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,490
So there's an example of how automation.

740
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,280
This is stuff that's built into Mac OS X.

741
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:59,170
The automation technologies that are part of Mac OS X
can be used in a variety of ways to produce content,

742
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:05,460
to become interactive to really make
your life a lot more interesting.

743
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:12,120
So in summary, you can use automation to build stuff.

744
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,110
It makes it easier to create content.

745
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,650
Now you can use it just as yourself as a consumer.

746
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:24,150
Or you can write these tools yourself
to have other people do them.

747
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:29,000
And it's all, everything you're seeing is coming soon.

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,580
So Padilicious, you're going to go there and
you're going to download the examples I showed you.

754
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,370
You can install them, tear them apart, do whatever you like.

755
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,140
You'll find the single web page thing there.

756
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,820
You'll find the Tropical Fish kind of building thing there.

757
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,040
And soon we'll be putting up the eBook.

758
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,650
The eBook's not quite ready for prime time yet.

759
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,910
Give us a week and we'll have that up.

760
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:19,020
To learn how to do this kind of stuff and how to
create these, or to just go download dozens and dozens

761
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:25,550
of pre-done services like the ones I used
today, you can go to macosxautomation.com.

762
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,840
That contains three websites, AppleScript,
Automator and Services.

763
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,790
Lots of tutorials, videos.

764
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,830
All the backup stuff that you need is on those two sites.

765
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:36,950
Don't talk to John.

766
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,720
Leave him alone.

767
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,910
Related sessions.

768
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,580
Now there's just so.

769
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:50,490
If you have automation at your back, all of a sudden
all of these sessions become pretty interesting

770
00:52:50,490 --> 00:53:07,390
because you can use them to create your own templates that
you're going to pre-populate and tear apart and build.
