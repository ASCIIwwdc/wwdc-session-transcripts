00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.940
>>My name is Max Muller, I'm the director
the iTunes Store, Content Engineering Group.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.540
My group is responsible for building the digital supply
chain that powers the iTunes, iBooks and App Store.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.650
And this session we've divided into three sections.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.440
The first we're going to look at the process of
publishing a new application to the App Store.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.320
We understand that many of you are
already very familiar with this flow,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.160
so we're going to go through it very quickly,
highlighting items that are new or recently updated.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.760
Next, we're going to look at how you
enable your application in iTunes Connect

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.250
to take advantage of Game Center, as well as IM.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.800
And finally, we're going to review some
of the tools that are available for you

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.200
to manage your applications once
they're live in the App Store.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.220
Also throughout the presentation, we are
going to highlight some best practices as well

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.180
as some common pit falls that are easy to avoid.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.770
So getting right into it, setting
up a new app in the App Store.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340
We are going to cover five topics today.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.280
The first are Accounts and Contracts.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.860
Get an account for publishing an app.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.330
You first need to be a member of the iPhone Developer
Program, if you have that you will be able to log

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.950
into their portal, to register for your distribution profile
which you'll use to submit your binary to us later on.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.830
Once you have an account there, you should be able
to access iTunes Connect at itunesconnect.apple.com.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.940
The first time you log in, you will
land here, this is the home page.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.500
Now if you are interested in having
a commercial relationship with us,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.320
your first stop should be the contracts
module, second one down on the left.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.860
Note that banking contact and tax information are required
if you plan on summiting a paid application to us.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.780
If you plan on using In App Purchase Items, or if
you're planning on integrating the iAd Network.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.710
A few things I would like to call out, the first is that you
make the decision upfront, if you would like to be entering

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.410
to this relationship as an individual or company.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.570
The process of changing from an individual to a
company at a later point, can take several months.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.890
And last, once you have access to iTunes Connect, we ask
you to start filling out the contracts as soon as possible,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.410
don't wait until you actually submitted an
application to us to start the contract flow.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.100
All right so now let's look at the process
of publishing a new app to the App Store.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.960
Starting with the metadata.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.390
To add a new app, you're going to log into iTunes Connect

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.560
and click on the Manager Applications
Module in the upper right hand corner.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.840
Now if this is your first time logging into this module,
I highly suggest you download the Developer Guide,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.450
linked in the bottom middle part of the page.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.070
The Developer Guide contains detailed
examples of application publishing

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.040
and covers everything we are going
to cover today, and in more detail.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.390
It is also updated about every month and a half to
two months, as we add new features to the portal.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.480
So to add a new app, we're going to click on
the upper left hand button, Add a new app.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.510
Now the first time you set up a new application, we
are going to prompt you for two pieces of information.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.760
The first is your company name, this
is your brand within the App Store,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.590
every application that you publish
will be listed under this name.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.360
And the second is your primary App Store language.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.490
What we're looking for here is what language, by default,
are you entering the metadata about your applications in.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.160
This will come into play later on when you start to look

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.810
at how you localize your marketing
message and in the different storefronts.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.370
The other thing to point out with these two pieces of
information is that currently we don't have any facility

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.910
for you to edit them, so you want to make
sure you get them right the first time.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.840
Next up is Export Compliance.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.510
The iTunes Store servers are located within the United
States, and as such, we are going to ask you five questions

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.080
about your use of encryption or
more specifically your bundling

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.870
of your own encryption libraries into your application.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.730
If you answer yes to all five questions, we are going
to require that you upload a valid CCATS file to us.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.520
Now one thing to point out is if you are only using
iPhone OS security frame works including HTTPS,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.800
a CCATS form is not required.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.930
So now let's look at the actual metadata that you are
going to be supplying to us about your application.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.830
The first is your application name.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.580
This is what is listed in the App Store.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.850
A few best practices to call out
about your application name,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.050
the first is that you should not use any trademark
names, unless you actually own the trademark.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.710
We ask you to refrain from adding the words
beta or trial to your application name.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.800
And your application name must match
the name of your app within your binary.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.420
For instance, if I set up an app called Orange
Racing, but when the application actually launched,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.070
it said Banana Racing my application would not be approved.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.360
And last, we ask you that you actually
have intent to publish a binary to us

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.140
if you reserve an application name within iTunes Connect.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.810
Next up is your description.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.920
This is the text that a user can read about
your application before choosing to download it.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.910
A few things to call out about your description, the
first is that it needs to be at least one sentence long,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.180
putting the words TBD or a single period are not acceptable.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.840
Also, we ask that you not to include any
profanity in your application description,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.460
parental controls do not restrict
access to your descriptions.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.810
Also when editing your description
bear in mind that it is a live edit

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.290
and it applies to all versions of your application.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.390
And last, as Steve called out in keynote,
what you describe in your description needs

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.710
to actually match the functionality
of your binary once submitted.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.360
You then choose to categorize or primary category
for app, copyright, and a version number.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.710
Version number can't be changed until you
supply a new update to your application,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.710
and a best practice we like to recommend you to keep your
version number in sync with the CFBundleShortVersion string.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.750
A SKU, which will only appear in your financial
reports at the end of the month, and finally keywords.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.130
Keywords help in the discoverability
of your app within the App Store.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.440
This should be relevant to your application,
and again, you should not include trademarks

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.920
in your keywords unless you own those trademarks.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.300
You can also provide some optional
fields about your application.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.600
The first is a secondary category,
an application URL, and demo notes.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.960
Demo notes are instructions to the review
team on how best to review your application.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.100
They're not a forum for general
questions or miscellaneous notes.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.060
And finally, you can provide a custom EULA, if you have one.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.690
Next up are App advisories.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.290
We're going to ask you to rank the frequency or
intensity of the following ten content descriptors,

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.130
based on your selections, we'll determine the
rating of your application within the App Store.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.330
The App Store has a simple age based
rating system of 4+, 9+ 12+, and 17+.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.180
We should point out that parents have
the option of restricting access to apps

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.640
of certain ratings, on both the iPhone as well as the iPad.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.890
So now, let's take a small segue and
talk about In-App Purchase items.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.620
In-App Purchases allow you to sell additional
content or services within your application,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.910
and this was introduced in iPhone OS 3.0.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.790
To enable your application to take
advantage of In-App Purchase items,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.110
you want to log-in to the provisioning
portal, select the Bundle Identifier

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.740
that you are interested in, and
enable it for In-App Purchase.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.640
Once you've done this, you can then log back into
iTunes Connect and add new In-App Purchase items.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.830
When setting up a new In-App Purchases,
we require the following information.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.930
The first is your bundle identifier, this will be
auto-populated from all of the bundle identifiers

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.580
that you have enabled in the provisioning portal.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.220
Next is a reference name.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.360
This is just your name for the item, and
will only appear within iTunes Connect.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.350
Next is a product identifier.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.920
This is how you'll actually retrieve
the offers, via StoreKit API.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.000
This will also appear in your financial
reports at the end of the month.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.770
A type. We offer three types of In-App Purchase
items, consumable, non-consumable, and subscription.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.160
Consumable are those that are, we allow multiple, we
allow the customer to purchase repeatedly, for instance,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.590
if you're selling 100 seeds or 100 bullets,
these will be things that you will use

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.260
up as part of the application or game play.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.670
The second are non-consumable.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.010
These are things that would enhance
your application, for instance,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.400
if you're selling an additional map, or a race track.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.150
Non-consumables are treated in the same
way as applications on the App Store.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.750
Once a user has purchased an app, we always
allow them re-download it for free again.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.970
Same works for a non-consumable In-App Purchases.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.440
And finally subscription.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.070
Subscription items, we allow the purchase, we allow the
customer to purchase repeatedly, so in that way they behave

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.530
in the same way as consumables, however,
the requirement on you, the developer,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.390
is that for subscription In-App Purchase
items, you need to insure that they,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:10.320
the user has access to this subscription
item across all devices that they own.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.230
Finally a display name.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.130
This will actually be retrieved
using StoreKit API's from the server

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.630
and displayed to the user in the purchase dialogue.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.860
A description, and finally, a screen
shot for review purposes only.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.370
A few best practices to call out about In-App Purchases.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.860
The first is that you need to test your In-App Purchase
items thoroughly in the Sandbox, the test environment.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.120
To do this, the first step is you need
to create Test Users in iTunes Connect.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.940
You log in to the user's module,
and they're two types of users.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.390
You want to select the Sandbox Test Account User.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.960
For each storefront that you wish to test your In-App
Purchase items in, you want to set up a new user.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.370
And finally, you should always use the StoreKit API's
to actually determine which offers are available.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.330
This will determine if you've actually
set them up correctly in iTunes Connect.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.000
There are two ways to submit In-App
Purchase items for review.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.920
The first is ad hoc and the second is with a binary.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.970
We recommend that you submit your In-App Purchase items
with a binary, this way you've tied the two together

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.700
and they will travel through the review process as one.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.630
When your application is approved, you then know that
you're In-App Purchase items were likewise also approved.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.390
All right, so let's now talk about pricing.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.270
Both pricing for In-App Purchase
items, as well as applications.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:24.740
When setting up pricing for an application, you need to
specify an availability date, this is the earliest date

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.430
at which your application can be
made available on the App Store.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.430
A price tier, which we'll get to
in just a second, and clearance.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.640
By default, clearance is assumed to be world-wide.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.670
However, if that is not your intent, you
can choose which of the 90 countries you'd

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.000
like to make your applications available in.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.200
The price tier, corresponds to both the
customer price as well as the proceeds.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.270
In this example, for price tier 10, you can see the middle
column is the customer price that will be charged world-wide

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.480
and on the right-hand side, you can see your proceeds.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.340
All of the countries not listed here that are
not in the Euro Zone, operate on the US dollar.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.980
Added a few months back is date-based pricing.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.050
It's available for both apps as
well as In-App Purchase items.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.240
Essentially, it gives you a date time
range where you can specify a price tier.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.890
You'll be setting a price tier, an
effective date, and optionally an end date.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:21.530
In this example, I have a price, I have an
application that's normally a price tier 1 application,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.840
but I've made it free for the month of June.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.630
A few best practices to call out for pricing.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.440
First, that pricing is global across all your version,
meaning when you're editing your pricing information,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.340
you're making those changes across
all versions of your application.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.370
Next is that In-App Purchase availability
is tied to your application.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.380
If you pull your application from the Store,
you have likewise pulled also pulled all

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.680
of your In-App Purchase items from the Store.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.600
All right, last topic that we want to cover
are the assets required for submitting

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.700
and setting up a new app on the App Store.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.460
The first one is your binary icon.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.890
This is the icon, that you'll, it is actually part that
you specify in your Info.plist file of your application.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.630
We require a 57 by 57 for iPhone and iPod touch apps.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.850
Now we've added iPhone 4, with its high dpi screen,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:14.350
we are also asking that you include
a 114 by 114 version of your icon.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.780
If you're doing iPad only apps, you
need to be specifying a 72 by 72 icon.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:26.880
And finally, for universal, you need to provide
a 57 by 57, a 72 by 72,and a 114 by 114.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.850
Note rounded corners and shine are
automatically added by the App store, however,

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:36.050
if you'd like to pre-shine your icon, the App
Store will honor the UIPrerenderedIcon key,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.820
as specified in your Info.plist file.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.540
And last, we ask you not to write the words
free or any pricing information in your icons.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.580
Added on iPhone OS 3.0, are device capabilities.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.580
Device capabilities allow you, if you application
absolutely requires that the device have a given capability,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.760
say a camera or cellular capabilities, you'll specify
this in the array of UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.750
Note that the App Store will prevent purchase of
your application onto any device that does not,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:11.810
does not have all of the specified device capabilities, and
iTunes will prevent syncing your application onto any device

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.640
if all of those capabilities are not present.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.930
Here's some example capabilities.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.760
Note that with iPhone 4, we've now
added Gyroscope, Front-facing camera,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.510
and Camera flash to the list of
capabilities that you can specify.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:29.170
Next asset, we're going to ask you
for a 512 by 512 version of your icon.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:35.040
It should be 72 dpi RGB, we set PNG, JPEG, or TIFF.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.290
And this is a big one, your large
icon needs to match identically,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.590
your 57, your 72 and your 114 dimensioned icons.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:51.130
If none of those, if those icons do not all
match, your application will not be approved.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.300
Next asset is Screenshots.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:59.310
For iPhone and iPod touch, you can provide
up to five screenshots, either 320 by 480,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.970
or you can now provide 640 by 960 for high-dpi screenshots.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.290
For iPad only and universal apps, you'll provide
five additional iPad dimension screenshots.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.050
And a few things to call out about your screenshots.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.350
The first is to insure that they are age-appropriate.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.850
If your application is rated 4+, then your
screenshots, likewise, should be rated 4+.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.860
Another thing we always ask you to do is to remove
the status bar from all of your screenshots.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.930
Now, if you pre-upload checks that you want to
check about your binary before you upload it to us.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.280
The first is cellular bandwidth.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.670
If you're using the Cellular Network,
we ask that you double-check

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.030
that you are abiding by the Developer Guideline Rules.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.690
Next is iPod touch functionality.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:45.460
If you've not restricted your application, please
ensure that it works across all of Apple's devices.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.000
And as Steve pointed out, please
test your applications thoroughly.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.340
The top three reasons application are
not approved is because they crash

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.800
on launch or crash during the review process.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.520
And finally, calling out again, the binary icon mismatch.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.760
Ensure that all of our binary's match exactly.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.650
So now that you're ready to upload your
binary to us, you have two options.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.170
The first is to upload it via iTunes Connect.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.310
Second is to use the ApplicationLoader.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.290
ApplicationLoader is located in the
Utilities folder of the iPhone SDK.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:20.050
Optimized for UDP delivery, it's faster than iTunes
Connect and it performs dozens of validation checks

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:26.270
on your machine before it uploads to us, and it's what
we recommend for all binary submission, at this point.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.510
And as of today, we're now accepting
iOS 4 binaries, so if you have.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.100
[Applause]

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.660
>>All right, all right.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.520
So if you have iOS 4 binaries that
you want to get in for launch,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.200
you want to start getting those
uploaded to us as soon as possible.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.190
And with that, I'd like bring Jason Fosback up,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.090
Engineering Manager for the iTunes Store
Content Delivery Team to give us a demo.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.250
>>Jason Fosback: Hi everyone, I'm Jason Fosback,
Manager of Content Delivery for the iTunes Store.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:58.680
I want to walk you through a quick demo here of checking
our metadata, because I've already prepared metadata

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.890
for an application, then actually building an
application and delivering it to the iTunes Store.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.460
So I'm going to go ahead and start Safari here,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:16.710
and I'm going to log in to iTunes Connect
with your Apple Connect credentials.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:27.030
And we're going to go here to Manage your Application.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:33.820
Here we already have Touch Fighter set up, and you'll
notice here that the status is waiting for upload.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.040
I'll touch on that a little bit more later,
but that's something important to note.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.640
I'm going to go ahead and edit the information now so
we can walk through all of the information to make sure

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.940
that everything looks good before
we submit our binary to the Store.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.660
So as Max had mentioned, one of the important things
that may prevent your binary from being approved is

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.360
that your application description needs to
actually match what the application does.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.140
So I just want to review here that my description is still
correct and that I haven't done anything to my application

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.960
to make it not valid, so that looks good.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.320
So, I want to check my category here, and it's a game,
which is correct, and I want to look at my sub-category,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.580
which is action, which applies to the
particular binary we're uploading here.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:26.740
So the copyright looks correct, and my keywords look
good, they're definitely applicable to my application.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.250
The application URL, support URL and
support email address all look great.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:36.220
So let's go ahead and move on to the next tab.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:44.040
So the advisories here have a number of different
settings for frequency here, as you notice,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:51.570
as you change the settings here, the, what we're actually
going to rate your application dynamically updates

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:58.480
on the page so that you can make sure that, you know, what
you're devising and how that's going affect your end user.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.630
So our application has infrequent
or mild cartoon fantasy violence,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.200
and that looks great, so let's go ahead and move on.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.910
So I'm going to skip over Game Center her for a second,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.950
because we'll touch on that a little
bit later, go to the upload tab.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:16.060
One of the things I want to do here is make sure
that the application icon actually matches, still,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.640
the application icon for my binary, and
in this case, it happens to be good.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.170
And then I also want to verify that my screenshot is still
appropriate and still matches what the application does.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:33.140
This is a 320 by 480 screenshot and that looks great.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.730
So now, let's go ahead and move on to the next tab.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.630
Localization.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.320
Now, I've actually localized this application to French,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.640
so that our French users can actually get an
accurate description of what the application is.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:52.740
So I've noticed here that I've got the French description
here, and some French keywords, that all looks great,

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.580
so let's move on to the next tab, pricing.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.960
Max had mentioned that pricing, the accept
and availability date, and in our case,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.300
I've actually set the availability date to December
31, 2010 because I don't want it to go live just yet.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.950
You'll notice that here.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.000
And I want to check my price tier, because, obviously,
you want to make sure that what you're charging

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.010
for you application is what you really intend to.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.950
So, you can click here on your price
tier, price tier 10 and you'll notice

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.800
that the customer price is 9.99,
and your proceeds is 7 dollars.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.380
That looks like what I want to charge for the
application, so let's move on to the summary page.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.920
Summary page basically gives you
a one quick stop look for what all

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.670
of your metadata is going to look
like on a particular storefront.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:43.170
So, in this case, we've localized to French, so I
want to go to the France Storefront and just make sure

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.230
that everything updates properly
and that what I expect to see

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.540
on the France Storefront looks
correct, and that looks good to me.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.530
So let's go ahead and log out now of
iTunes Connect and build our application.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:03.510
One of the things that we added for Xcode 3.2 and
higher, or sorry the iPhone SDK 3.2 and higher,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:10.310
is the ability to actually validate your application
offline every time that you build your product.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.670
So here in your settings for building, you'll actually
notice there's a new setting called Validate Built Product,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.100
and we can check that, and now
every time I build my application,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.310
we're going to actually perform all
the Store validations that we perform

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.430
or can perform offline, on your binary right when you build.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.840
So let's go ahead and bring up the Build
panel, make sure that our device is correct

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.510
and that our target is right, distribution
and iPhone Device 3.1.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.290
Let's go ahead and build it.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:45.100
So you'll notice here that there are a few errors saying
that the icon specified in the Info.plist can't be found.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.250
All right, well, let's go take a look at our Info.plist
for the application and see what might be wrong.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:56.010
So here's the icon file that I've specified here, and I
notice that actually I've actually spelled this incorrectly,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:03.750
so I need to fix that, because the icon's actually called
TouchFighter.png, I want to save it, let's go ahead

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.950
and head back her to Build panel and build
again, and this time it built successfully.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.560
So now, we're actually ready, almost,
to deliver it to the Store.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:19.560
So we go down here to Products, right-click,
reveal our application in the Finder, compress it,

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.850
so that it's actually ready to be delivered
to the Store, and then I'm just going

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.070
to drag this onto the Desktop to easily find it.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:34.310
One of the other changes we made in the iPhone OS
3.2 SDK is that we actually moved Application Loader

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:42.740
down into Developer, Applications,
Utilities, and there it is.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.820
So I've already set, gone through Application Loader
once and entered my iTunes Connect information,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.680
which is usually the first thing that happens when you
start up Application Loader, so it's not actually going

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.040
to ask us anything, at this point, about our credentials.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:01.260
So it will actually connect to the Store, and as I
mentioned before, it will look for any applications that are

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.530
in the Waiting for Upload state and
display them here in this pop-up.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.430
So we're going to choose that, TouchFighter,
and it's asking us right now if we've qualified

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.770
and tested this for iPhone OS 3.0 and yes, we have.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.290
So here, it just gives us some, you know, a brief
summary of some of the attributes of our application

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.500
so that we can verify that this
is really the application metadata

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.430
that we want to upload the binary against, and it is.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.050
So now let's choose the binary, and there
it is, the TouchFighter ZIP that we created.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.000
And let's go ahead and send it to the Store.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.780
Now, when you do this, Application Loader actually does
all the same validations that are performed in Xcode now,

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.110
as well as some, what we call connected
validations, which is where we talk to the Store

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:48.570
and actually verify your minimum OS version is
correct, your bundle identifier hasn't changed,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.930
and some other things like that, so the important
thing to realize here is that underneath the hood,

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:58.890
we're actually using a very robust transport
mechanism to send your binary to the Store.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:05.170
It uses a secure UDP transport protocol, and it attempts
to use that and if your network is not configured

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.990
to allow that, we'll actually fail over to HTTPS,

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.140
so it will actually ultimately fall
back to what you do at iTunes Connect.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.770
The important thing here to remember
though, is that you can deliver

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:20.570
up to 10 times faster using Application
Loader than with iTunes Connect.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.690
So, our application has been successfully
uploaded and we're now done.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.220
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Max.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.430
[Applause]

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.620
>>Max: All right, thank you Jason.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.680
All right, so that's what we wanted to show for
setting up a new application in iTunes Connect.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.140
So, now let's look at how you enable your application
to take advantage of Game Center as well as iAd.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.180
And to do that, I would like to bring up Ricardo
Cortes, Engineering Manager for iTunes Store,

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.510
Provider Services Group to walk
us through Game Center and iAd.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.110
[Applause]

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.490
>>Ricardo Cortes: Thank you Max.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.400
Let's take a look at Game Center first.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.250
Game Center is new for iOS 4.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:10.430
It provides a social gaming network that includes
Invitations, Matchmaking, Leaderboards and Achievements.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:16.060
There are three steps involved, which
respect integration with iTunes Connect,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.750
you need to do to enable your app for Game Center.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.680
Let's look at registration.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:30.210
And like fashioned In-App Purchases, you need to go
back to the iPhone Provisioning Portal, go to App IDs,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.030
find your app and enable that bundle
identifier for Game Center.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:40.520
Go back to iTunes Connect, we have a new
tab, the third tab over, called Game Center,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:46.900
and you need to click that Enable button
to enable your app for Game Center.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.070
Upon doing so, you can now select the
bundle identifier in the drop-down.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:24:01.280
Let's go to the metadata involved with Game Center.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.950
First, you have your Leaderboard.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:11.050
We have an identifier that goes along with that
Leaderboard and, again, we recommend reverse domain syntax.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.660
A language, we have 14 languages you can choose from.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.390
You want to localize your Leaderboard
in as many languages as possible.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:23.320
We have a sort order, whether you want your scores
to be sorted ascending or descending, in other words,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.890
do you want the top score at the top, or
do you want the top score at the bottom.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.100
We also have a score format.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.330
All scores for Game Center is sent over as
64-bit ints, so we need to format that score

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.750
to represent it correctly in the
Leaderboard, within Game Center.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:44.130
Three examples are integer, with no
decimals, float, with decimals, and money.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:51.580
Here we're showing US dollars, we also have support for
Kronos, Francs as well as Pounds and a few other currencies.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.730
We also have 17 other formatters you can choose from.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.850
We also have a score format suffix.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.290
If your game is centered around gold
coins, and you have a Leaderboard

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:07.640
that represents who's collected the most gold coins, you
might want to represent that at the end of the score.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.400
So you might have 250 gold coins in
English and 250 gold coins in Spanish.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.310
Let's look in the example.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.660
In this example, in iTunes Connect,
I have set up a Leaderboard,

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.170
Leaderboard ID is com.apple.touchfighter.leaderboard.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:36.730
I've chosen to sort these scores ascending, and I've set up
two formatters, both are integers, in English and Spanish,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.790
and one has a score format suffix of gold
coins and the other of gold coins in Spanish.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.420
That's Leaderboards, let's look at achievements.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.100
Achievements also have an identifier.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.030
Again, we recommend reversing domain
syntax there, same set of 14 languages,

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.480
and they have a pre-earned description
and a post-earned description.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.710
A Pre-earned description is what you entice your users in
Game Center in the app to go out and achieve the achievement

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.420
that you've set up, It's akin to the trophy.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:11.650
And the post-earned is, a little congratulations
to the user once they've earned it.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:18.450
You can also assign the achievement a point value
and we're going to require a 512 by 512 PNG,

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.760
TIFF or JPEG, it represents the achievement.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.850
Let's look at a multi-player compatibility.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:32.250
Multi-player compatibility allows different
versions to be compatible within the same app.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.500
If you're enabling Game Center in an existing app
on the Store, it's likely that you have not had,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.770
added the code to enable Game Center, so you'll
need to have some version logic to figure

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.600
out which versions can play with each other.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:48.280
This controls two major features within
Game Center; Matchmaking and Invitations.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:53.840
With respect to matchmaking, you might want
to find someone to play with, randomly.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.060
And invitation you might know the person you want to
invite to play with, and so you'll send them an invite

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.460
to play the game, and you want to make sure they
can play the same version of the app that you can.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:09.330
Lastly, let's look at testing.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.940
Again, iOS 4 is required.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:18.930
And development builds automatically use the Sandbox,
there's nothing that you need to do as a developer

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:24.800
when you're using Development Environment to
hit our Sandbox Environment for Game Center.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.160
And likewise, apps that are purchased off the
store use the Production Environment automatically.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.780
If you want to test to ensure that your localization is
setup correctly, and your localizations you've added,

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:40.030
including score formatters, need to
be localized correctly across locales.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.270
And on-device testing is required.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.940
It's not sufficient to test your
use of Game Center on a simulator.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.550
Feature availability; what's available today?

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:56.010
Right now in iTunes Connect, you can go and set up your
Leaderboard and you can play around with Game Center,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.000
which is in Preview Mode, and do Sandbox testing.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:08.370
Later this year we're introducing achievements,
compatibility, multiple leaderboards and binary submission.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:13.680
One note on binary submission, we are not accepting
binaries that have Game Center code added to them,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.670
so if you need to update your binary, you'll need to remove
the Game Center's OS or accommodate it out for submission.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:25.860
Let's look at iAd; iAd is also a new feature for iOS 4.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:33.210
It is Apple's Mobile Advertising
platform, and if you saw the keynote,

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:39.340
you'll know that there is some really
crazy rich media support built into iAd.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:46.410
It's easy to implement with the iAd framework and you need
to join the iAd Network to run ads and receive revenue.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.470
There's a new contract, we'll get into in a second.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:57.470
The steps for enabling your app with iAd begin
with Contracts, it's an iAd specific agreement

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:03.520
and it's co-terminus with your Program
License Agreement, the 99 dollar fee,

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.070
as well as the paid contract if you filled that out.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.700
It is required to receive non-test ads.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:19.570
And in this screenshot you see in the contract module in
iTunes Connect, the iAd Network contract is highlighted.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.120
One thing to note is you'll need to sign the
latest PLA to even get access to the iAd Network.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.760
You will not be able to request, until doing so.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.980
Next step is to enable your app for iAd.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:38.930
You do this by logging into iTunes Connect, and creating
a new app, or updating, and clicking the Enable Ads button

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.820
as well as answering the Primary Audience question.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.080
Upon doing so, you can select your
bundle notifier in iTunes Connect.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.980
Note, this is different from Game
Center, you do not have to go

00:29:51.980 --> 00:30:01.180
to the Provisioning Portal to set up your bundle identifier.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.930
Lastly, once you've set up iAd, and you delivered
your binary, you want to monitor how your app is doing

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.660
with those ads, and with that, you go to
the iAd Network module in iTunes Connect.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.920
It's a new module that we've introduced with iOS 4, you can
do your revenue, most importantly, your add impressions,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.010
your click-thru rates and many other stats about your app.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:27.370
You can also specify exclusions for those competitors
that you would not wish to have ads in your app.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:32.900
In this screenshot, you'll see the iAd Network
module, below In-App Purchases, above promo codes.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:39.970
You will not be enabled for the iAd Network
until you sign the iAd Network contract.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.840
Upon clicking the iAd Network module, you'll
see a summary of how your app is doing

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.330
in the last 7 days with respect to revenue and eCPM.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:55.090
You also can get graphical representation of
your data across revenue, impressions, requests,

00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:00.810
eCPM, click-thru rates as well as fill rates.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.150
You can also find your apps and view them
specifically and inspect their details.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:12.480
In this example, I have two apps, I have TouchFighter
1.0 and TouchFighter 2.0; 1.0 is a live app,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.010
you can see that with the green status saying Live Ads.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.270
It also has revenue and requests and impressions.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.860
I can then inspect that app, get more details about it.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:30.260
I can see the minimum OS requirements, its languages,
supported languages, as well as the name and the rating.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:40.200
To specify exclusions, you can enter
an Apple ID, a URL or a keyword.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:48.780
In this example, I'm entering Meteoroids, it will then show
up in a currently excluding section below with DeepSpace

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.200
and ShapeShipDeluxe, two of my competitors.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.510
And with that, I'd like to bring Aloke Bhatnager up to
stage, he's going to walk us through iAd and Game Center.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.390
[Applause]

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.720
>>My name is Aloke Bhatnager and I'm the
Engineering Manager for iTunes Connect.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:10.290
As Ricardo mentioned, there are two things
that you are going to do for iAd setup

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:14.760
and I'm going to demo iAd and Game Center for you.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.300
So, two things that you need to do for
iAd setup are, setting up your application

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.310
to be ad enabled, and requesting your iAd contract.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:29.520
So let's log into iTunes Connect
and see those two things then.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:37.890
I'm going to click on the Contracts module, and as you can
see over here, I've requested the iAd Network contract,

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.840
and I've entered my banking and tax info.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:47.060
After a little while, the contract goes into effect
and that's the first step that you need to take.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.600
Now I'm going to click in Manage your Applications.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:33:05.780
I have two iAd enabled applications setup over here,
TouchFighter, which is ready for sale and TouchRacer,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:11.940
which I'm still playing around in Sandbox and testing
a bunch of things, so it's waiting for upload.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:26.380
So, once you've done those two things, as you can see, a new
module called iAd Network shows up, let's click into that.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:32.250
So when you first come over to the screen, you're presented
with an aggregate view of real revenue data and a bunch

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:37.390
of other statistics for across all your applications,
and the statistic that you can see are revenue

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:43.290
in the last 7 days, revenue to date, eCPM
average last 7 days, and eCPM average to date.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:49.240
We have a graph listing your revenue, you can hover over
it to get all kinds of information at various data points,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:59.800
and you can get different data for revenue, impressions,
requests, eCPM, click-through rate and fail rate,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.640
and of course, you can switch and
do bar graph and line graph mode.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.070
If you don't know what these mean,
you can click into the Help Link here

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.850
and it will expand what each one of these means to you.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.990
So as I've mentioned, this was a aggregate view about the
application, but right now I'm just focused on TouchFighter,

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:22.620
which is getting live art versus the other
application which I was playing around with in Sandbox.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.840
So, let's look into that.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.380
So I clicked into the application, now I'm
only seeing data about the application itself.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.730
Now my application is only selling in the US,
which is why I only see that country over here,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.620
but if your application is selling in more countries,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.390
you can drill down further by clicking
into one of these countries.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.720
So the graph is very similar to the aggregate
view, so I'm not going to go into that.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:50.110
What I am going to show is how you can edit
your application exclusions at this point,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:54.820
so you click the Edit button, and you click Exclusions.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:01.610
So Spaceship Deluxe is a TouchFighter competitor, so
I'm, I've already added that to the exclusions list,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:07.740
and let's assume that Acme Corp is also one of the
competitors, so I'm going to go ahead and add it,

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:14.430
and it shows up in the list, and I can check either one of
these and click remove whenever I want to, and hit Done.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:19.680
And with that, that's the iAd demo.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:26.770
So, I click back into iTunes Connect,
I'm going to demo Game Center for you.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:36.130
Click Manage your Applications, TouchRacer, Edit
information, and as Ricardo and Max mentioned earlier,

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.710
there's a new tab called Game Center in iTunes Connect now.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:44.400
This application hasn't been enabled for Game
Center yet, so I'm going to click enable,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.800
since I already chose a bundle identifier for iAd for
the application, I do not have to choose this again

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.150
for Game Center, if this application wasn't iAd enabled,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.510
I would get a drop down to chose
my bundle identifier over here.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.690
As you can see there's no Leaderboard set up yet for
this application, so let's go ahead and click Set-up.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:08.540
Let's give it a nice Leaderboard ID,
something like hey com.apple.touchracer.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:17.080
Now you can chose what sort order you want depending on how
you want to display the scores, I chose ascending for this,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.590
and you can add various localizations, so let's go
ahead and add a language, let's do English first,

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.940
and these are the formatters that Ricardo mentioned earlier,

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:32.330
let's choose integer for now, and
I'm going to enter gold coins.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:37.030
And it shows up.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:45.760
Let's go ahead and add another localization,
Spanish this time, choose the formatter,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:55.750
and enter the Spanish localization, hit Save
Changes, and your Leaderboard is all set up.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.750
>>Max: All right, thank you Aloke.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.570
And that's the iAd as well as the Game Center setup.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.820
So now let's look at some of the
tools that are available for you

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.180
to manage your applications once
your apps are live on the Store.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:13.980
So the first are Financial Reports, Financial
reports are posted on a monthly basis.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.890
For every proceed, currency that you
generated revenue in the previous month.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:22.040
To get your financial report, click
on module Financial Reports.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.230
Every report that we've ever posted for you is always
available for you to download, simple CSV format.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.060
If you can't wait until the end of the month to find

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:34.140
out how your applications are doing,
we also offer daily and weekly trends.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:41.310
To get to the Sales and Trends Module, upper left-hand
corner, select your report type, as well as your period,

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:47.870
daily or weekly, we store up to 26 weeks worth
of data for you to look at your sales and trends.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:51.160
Next step are Promo Codes.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.230
Promo codes are a great way for
you to promote your applications.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:59.260
They provide a royalty free download for a paid
application, they're for non-commercial distribution only.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.120
Every version that you have approved will
allow you to generate up to 50 codes,

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.540
once a code has been generated,
it will expire after 4 weeks.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.920
Note that the iTunes Connect user must have the legal
role, in order to be able to generate promo codes,

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.750
and they are available to redeem for accounts
with US, have US iTunes Store accounts.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:22.480
To get to your promo codes, you're going to want
to click on the module Request Promotional Codes.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.300
Here in the drop-down, we'll give you a list of all of
your applications that are eligible for promo codes,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:33.360
enter the number of codes you wish to
generate, click Continue to download a CSV file.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.740
Next up are Crash Reports.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.140
We have lots of users out there who have elected to
send us information about misbehaving applications.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.010
If you suspect that your application might be
one of those misbehaving apps, you can log in

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.510
and click on the Crash Reports link at the top.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:53.240
Crash Reports are generated on demand, we'll collect
the last 14 days worth of data for your application.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:02.170
Note across the top, we give you a
broken down by an iPhone OS version.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:08.180
The first section are the crashes, we collate the
top 10 most frequent crashes of your application,

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:14.750
and for each unique crash point, we'll give you up to
10, up to 5 example stat traces that you can download,

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.800
load in Xcode to help you debug the issue.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:23.980
Next, we'll give you the timeouts, either timeout on
launch, timeout on quit, or being force quit by the user.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.320
For each one of these, again, well
provide up to five example stat traces.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:34.500
And finally for all of the reports that were submitted
to us, we give you a breakdown of crashes versus timeouts

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:40.120
versus memory, this way you can kind of get a real good
feel for where you need be focusing your debugging energies.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.590
Next up are Customer Reviews.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:49.170
It was added about a few months back, get to all of the
customer reviews for a given version of your application,

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.950
log in and click on the Customer Reviews link at the bottom.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:57.020
Here it will give you a country pop-up,
you can select the different countries

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.240
to see all the reviews for your application, nice easy spot.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.470
And finally App delete.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.890
This is going live actually today, so you
can stop putting the words iTunes Connect,

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.150
please delete me as part of your application name.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.520
To delete your application, log in, inspect
your app, and we now have a Delete button

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.890
in the bottom left-hand corner, right there.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:23.210
When you delete it, we're going to pop-up a nice scary
confirm message, because at this point it's going

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.850
to disappear from iTunes Connect,
if it's available for sale,

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.950
it will disappear from the Store, for
all intents and purposes, it's gone.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.600
And those are some of the tools that we have

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.720
to help you manage your applications,
once they're live in the App Store.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.910
Well, actually we do have one more
tool that we'd like to show you today.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.510
It's my pleasure to introduce iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:52.050
[ Applause ]

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.260
This allows you to track your apps
and how they are doing on the go.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:59.430
Now we're really happy with how well this application's
turned out and we think it's going to be an invaluable tool

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:03.480
to you to track the performance of
your applications on the App Store.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.930
So this is literally been one of the most
highest requested developer features.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:12.880
We started off giving you easy access to daily and
weekly sales data, you can either slice it by apps

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.890
or by the different markets, we've integrated
in some really nice looking graphs and charts

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:21.940
to help you visualize this data, and
it will available later on today.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.510
So with that, I would like to bring Ricardo back up
on stage to give us a demo of iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:30.180
[ Applause ]

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.060
>>Ricardo: Thank you Max.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.460
I had a feeling you guys might like this little surprise.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:41.280
My team's worked pretty hard to get this ready for you
guys today, so I hope you like what we have to offer.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.160
Let's click on iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.540
You're prompted with a login screen,
it's the same login screen you use

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.280
for iTunes Connect, your username and password.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:42:02.970
And upon signing in, you see a breakdown in segments
of Paid Apps, Free Apps, In-App Purchases and updates,

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:09.000
you also see a trend pane across the top from one day
all the way to 26 weeks, and a trend pane at the bottom,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.300
a time period at the top, and a trend
pane at the bottom, for graphical view.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.770
You can click on Paid Apps, to see how
you did, say in the two-week period.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:24.400
You did 25 thousand units and a two-week prior,
you're actually down 6,500 units from two-weeks prior.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.240
You can also see the percentage
change and get back to the units.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:37.210
Switching to the products tab at the bottom here, we'll list
the top 10 products that are currently selling on the store.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:42.170
Here you see TouchFighter as well a few other apps.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:50.440
There's a segmentation control, switch between Sales and
Updates, if you're interested in your update numbers.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.470
Again, you can get the percentages as well as the
differences in that same time period, two weeks.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:43:02.830
At the bottom, if you swipe the trend pane, you get
your binary icon, Apple ID and bundle identifier,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:08.890
a few essential pieces of information about
the app, and if I rotate into landscape view,

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:19.870
you also get a trend pane that's bigger
and you can apply a HUD across that.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:27.390
Sales, the Sales and Update segmentation control is
still there, and then you can swipe in landscape view

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:33.350
to get subtotals across the time period that you
previously selected, so I previously selected two weeks,

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:37.980
I get daily subtotal across this
time periods for Sales and Updates.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.140
I can also get a weekly breakdown of the same time period.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.070
Previously selected two weeks,
so I get two weeks of subtotals.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:52.490
Rotating back to portrait, let's go to Markets, here again,

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.970
we'll show you the top 10 territories
in which you're selling your apps.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:03.960
And at the bottom, we have an others row, which
collates all the rest of your territories.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:10.730
Now let's say you have an app, it is not in the top 10,
maybe it's 11 or 50 or 100, and some of you have upwards

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:15.610
to 9 thousand, 10 thousand apps, you can search for it,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:22.470
and get the same information you would
if you had found it in the Products tab.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:30.680
Again, trend pane at the bottom and you can
rotate in landscape and get daily subtotals,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.290
weekly subtotals, as well as a detailed trend graph.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:42.230
Finally, the last tab at the bottom, lists your
account, you can autofill the account so you don't have

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.720
to remember the account every time
you log in, and the version number.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.490
You can also sign out of iTunes Connect Mobile if you wish.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:55.340
As Max mentioned, it's available today, it will be going up
as a link in iTunes Connect in the next three to four hours.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.000
You will not be able to find it on the Store, you
will have to use iTunes Connect to download it.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.510
Hope you guys enjoy it.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.300
[ Applause ]

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.210
>>Max: All right, thank you Ricardo.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:11.250
Now obviously that's the first of many updates we
hope to be bringing to you in the mobile space;

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.740
iTunes Connect Mobile, so it will be posted later on today.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.330
You will log in to iTunes Connect, you should have
a link into the App Store, as Ricardo mentioned,

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.290
you won't be able to actually search for iTunes
Connect Mobile within the normal App Store.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:28.690
And that's what we had to cover today, so if you, for more
information Mark Malone was the Evangelist for this session,

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.600
on the documentation front, iTunes Connect Developer Guide.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:38.520
A few other related sessions, Integrating Ads
with iAd is tomorrow in Pacific Heights, 9 am,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.150
Introduction to Game Center is
in Presidio tomorrow at 11:30.
