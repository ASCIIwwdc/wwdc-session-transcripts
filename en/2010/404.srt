1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,150
>> Mike Lampell: Hello and thank you for coming.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,820
Mike Lampell here to tell you all about Game Center.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,910
So, we're really excited about Game Center and we
want to tell you a little bit more about what's in it.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,210
So, first off, Game Center is a developer preview right now.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,660
So, it's there for you guys to work with
and we will be saying when, later this year,

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,840
you'll be able to use it and shift games with it.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,930
Game Center includes three pieces.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,350
You have the Game Center application and that's
where you go to discover new Game Center friends,

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,600
to discover new Game Center games and to
compare how you're doing against your friends.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,370
It also includes GameKit, which a powerful, flexible,

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,390
framework and the Game Center Services,
which is our backbone set of servers.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,210
We're going to be going over this and a lot more detail
today in this session and then the next two sessions,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,670
we're going to be going into detail on
how to use these and how to code for them.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,210
So, first of all, just as a big overview,
Game Center sits on top of GameKit,

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,410
our Game Center application and so do your games.

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,790
They both take advantage of the same framework, there's
a couple of pieces of the framework that are limited only

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,460
to Game Center application and those have to
do with account management, friends management

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,080
and being able to see multiple games at once.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,610
So, this is kind of the overall picture of how it looks and
we're going to be talking about all these in more detail.

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,170
Just want to encourage everybody to go to the other
two parts, we have Game Center Techniques Part 1,

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,050
which is going to go into Leader Boards, Achievements,
Game Center Techniques Part 2 is going to go into more

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,250
of the multiplayer aspects of it, Invites,
Auto-Matching and a couple other features like that.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,760
Graham did a session this morning,
if any of you missed it, on Quest.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,740
Those are going to be repeated on Friday.

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,880
We encourage you to go to those.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,640
We also have two labs which we encourage you to go to.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,860
So, what you'll learn in the overview.

28
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,940
First, we're going to go over the definition
of what is a Game Center game and we'll go

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,280
over the definition of what is a Game Center player.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Once we got those definitions out of the way, we're going
to go on and start looking over what's in the application,

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
what's in the framework and then I want to highlight some
differences between what you're going to see in development

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,860
and what the consumer's going to see in production.

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,530
First of all, what is a Game Center game?

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,700
So you have to do two things to be a Game Center game.

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,370
First of which you have to register your
bundle identifier through the developer portal.

36
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,500
Second thing is, when you, when your game is launched,
you have to authenticate a Game Center player.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,260
You do those two things, you're a Game Center game.

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,740
Pretty simple.

39
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,990
There's a couple optional things that we
encourage people to use such as Leader Boards,

40
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,450
Achievements and Multiplayer functionality that we
have and we'll be going into all this in more detail.

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,580
But, I want to say, if you just do the first two things
and become a Game Center game, actually maybe multiplayer

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,500
for the first one, you get a lot of extra things.

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,650
If you have multiplayer you, you
get the invite notifications.

44
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,450
This is a fantastic way to increase
discoverability of your games.

45
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,150
When a person gets an invite notification, if they don't
have the game, they'll get a purchase upgrade option

46
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,430
or upgrade option if they have it in the wrong
version and purchase option if they don't have it.

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,300
If you just do the first two things, you're automatically
listed in Game Center as a game a person has played.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,930
This means when other people looking at their
friends games, they'll see your game listed.

49
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,340
You get all the friend comparison
stuff in our Game Center application,

50
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,170
you get the secure player registration authentication

51
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,720
and you get all our friend relationships
from our social gaming network.

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,680
Game Center player, again you have to do
two things to be a Game Center player.

53
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,510
You have to have an account and
most people already have an account.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,290
We leverage the iTunes accounts there to there

55
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,140
or you can create a new account that's an
Apple ID without the iTunes information.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:09,530
You can do either, but almost everybody out there using
an iPhone right now or iPod touch has the iTunes account.

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,070
You also have to create a unique nickname.

58
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,980
Some people already have unique nicknames.

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:22,420
This is the same name space as the iTunes Store
today, when you do reviews of music or apps,

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,340
it asks you for a nickname, this is the same name space.

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,800
So, a lot of people already have these first two things.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,620
There's some optional things, just listed a few here, but,

63
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,080
but optional things for players is creating
a status message and making friends.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:46,720
So, just a couple of things as a highlight you get from a
Game Center player, first of all, you the developers find

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,670
out the person's nickname, as I said
it's unique, but it's not persistent.

66
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,310
We also have the unique Player ID,
this one is unique and persistent.

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,300
So it, the deal is the person can change their nickname if
they decide to, but this unique Player ID would persistent

68
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,030
and unique and this is what you
should use to reference that player.

69
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,510
There's also a flag letting you know if the player is under
age and there's the information about that player's friends.

70
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,680
In the Game Center app, there's also, obviously editing the
styles, message, seeing all your friends status messages,

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,330
the games played and statistics for those games.

72
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,360
The Game Center is there to pull all of this together
so people can browse how their friends are doing,

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,890
how they're doing and all their different games, all that.

74
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,120
And you also get a list of recently played
people and games and we'll go into that in a bit.

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,030
So, I want to do an overview of the Game Center application
and we're going to do something kind of un-Apple like here.

76
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm going to be talking about some
features you haven't seen yet.

77
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,660
I'll try and call out the ones that are
different from what you see and what's available

78
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:01,200
in the developer seeds right now, and what will
be available to the consumers, as we go along.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,340
The Game Center application is a built in application.

80
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:13,220
It's, it comes with iOS 4 and it's available to
everybody to use and it's there to promote social gaming.

81
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,630
It's where you go to do your player account creation and
modification, create and manage your friend relationships,

82
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:27,740
view your friend details, view your game details,
purchase games and launch games with or without invites

83
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,090
and again I'll get into this in more detail.

84
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,580
So, first off, I want to show the Me tab.

85
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,050
This is where you go to get your player overview, you
get a high level look at yourself, you're the player,

86
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,970
it's where they can manage their status,
change their status and manage their account.

87
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,380
Here's where you go to, if you click on
the Account button, you go to Log Out,

88
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,750
Change Accounts or change any of your account settings.

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:01,250
I also want to point out the bottom are four tabs, what
you're seeing today in the developers seed has three tabs,

90
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:09,080
because one tab we don't enable in the
developer seed and that is the Games tab,

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,340
third tab in, and I'll be going into that.

92
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,120
In the Games tab you see a list of games,
Game Center games that you've played.

93
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,260
These are ordered in the order you played them last and
there's some extra high level information per game there.

94
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,170
It also has a button there to go
find more Game Center games.

95
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,330
Obviously, trying to increase the
discoverability of all the Game Center games.

96
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,660
Now, I want to go back one tab to
the Friends tab and talk about that.

97
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,000
These will kind of coincide in a minute.

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,990
Friends tab is a list of all your friends, most of
this you're seeing today, some of this your not.

99
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,780
It's ordered by the ones that most recently played, so you
kind of get an indication of when this player last played.

100
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,980
It also tells you what game they last played.

101
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,620
That part you're not seeing today.

102
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,130
And, this is a great way for you to discover if
a lot of your friends are playing a certain game

103
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,690
or which ones most popular among your friends.

104
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,420
Right here, at a quick glance, you can see.

105
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,430
You have a lot of people playing Onword, so
then it gives you their status message, also.

106
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,830
So, great way to get a high level information about
your friends, you hit the + button to add more friends

107
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,560
or you can drill down and look at any
detail on these friends in more detail.

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,140
So let's do that.

109
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,980
So we're going to go look at Ares of War.

110
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:38,660
So this is a friend's detail page and what you see
on here is high level information about the friend,

111
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,350
real similar to what you see for yourself.

112
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,240
You got the how many friends they have,
how many games they've played and ooh,

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,050
they don't have many achievements yet, but they
show how many achievements they had if they did.

114
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:57,250
And there's their status message and now there's three
categories underneath this of the games they've played.

115
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,520
We break them down to three sections,
the games that I've played with Ares

116
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,710
of War is the first section,he games we've played together.

117
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:14,980
And then the second section is the games
they've played that I haven't, but we both own.

118
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,790
And then the games they own that I don't and this is
another great way for discoverability of new games,

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,320
so I don't have Blocks, they do, tells me the
overall rating of this game, how much it is

120
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,830
and if I click on it, it takes me to the store.

121
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,080
I can go buy that game.

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,170
We got a lot of I think features like that built
in to Game Center for discoverability of new games.

123
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,860
We're going to really help people find good games.

124
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,580
So now, I want to drill into one of
those games in a little bit more detail,

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,240
so now I'm looking at a game my friend played, Tanks.

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,250
So what it does in this case is, since I'm looking
at my friend's game, it knows we both have this game,

127
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,720
it's comparing my progress in this game versus my friend's.

128
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,680
So, right away I can see where we rank in the leaderboards
and how many achievements they have versus how many I have.

129
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
Real quick and easy.

130
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,770
So now let's drill down a little bit, we're going to look
at the leaderboard for them and real, it highlights me

131
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,120
and highlights my friend if they're on there
and I can quickly and easily see where we're at.

132
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,960
Now, each leaderboard comes with the
basic filters for friends or anyone

133
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,430
and for time, today, this week or all time.

134
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,490
It's all built in for you and real easy to use.

135
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,040
So there's the friend's leaderboard and
there's the overall leaderboard listed here.

136
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,580
Now, let's go look at achievements.

137
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,910
Again, since I'm looking at my friend's game, it
does a real quick comparison of my achievements

138
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,630
in Tanks versus their achievements in Tanks.

139
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,940
Real quick and easy.

140
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,460
And, we don't give away any spoilers, so if
I don't have the achievement it doesn't show

141
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,970
that achievement to me, it shows it as I would see it.

142
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,250
So, you see the one with the question mark,
I haven't earned that yet, but my friend has.

143
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,110
Doesn't show me what it is, we
aren't giving away the spoiler alert.

144
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,520
So, just real quick, I want to look at how the Game Detail
screen looks at for me, so now, it's a little bit different

145
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,330
than how it looks at from looking at my friend's.

146
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm looking at my game detail for Tanks and in this case,
there's no comparison here, it has the leaderboards,

147
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,430
it has achievements, it has my overall summation of those
two, but it also has a button called Recently Played.

148
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,450
What Recently Played does is this will give me a
list of all the people I've recently played in Tank.

149
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,540
This way, if I played somebody and I liked them but forgot,
I can go in there, find them and friend them from there.

150
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,350
It's an easy way if some games don't show me who I
was playing or something like that, I can go in here

151
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,550
and find out and still make friends with them.

152
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,280
We also have a Tell a Friend button, another great
way to increase that discoverability about your game.

153
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm going to tell my friends that I
love this game and they can go buy it.

154
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,010
There's been this Play button in the upper
corner there that I haven't talked about.

155
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,430
And I want to talk about that for a little bit right now.

156
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,850
So, it's on every Game Detail screen and it may do something
a little bit different depending on which screen it's on.

157
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:16,110
This one, I'm on my friend's Tank screen, their Game
Detail, if I hit Play here it's going to launch Tank.

158
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,810
So no matter, on all of them, if I click
the Play button it will launch that game.

159
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,810
But in this case, since I'm on my friend's
Tank Detail, it will launch the game

160
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,830
and tell the game I want to play with this friend.

161
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,250
So, it will automatically start the invitation process.

162
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,690
So if I click Play it launches
Tank, brings up the Invite Flow,

163
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,300
this is a UI we provide and automatically
selects that friend.

164
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,280
From here I can click Next, put in a
personalized message for them and send it.

165
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,930
We're going to do a quick demo of this, we're actually
going to do a quick demo of launching the invite

166
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,940
from within a game and Albert Ho, if
you can come up and help me on this.

167
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:04,330
>> Albert Ho: We fired up two iPhones here, so, I'm
logging in as Thunder Zeus with this device here

168
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,250
and I'm also going to go ahead and fire Tanks up, first.

169
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,090
So you see when Tanks boots, you'll
see a "Welcome back" message drop

170
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,070
and that's how you know you've
authenticated against Game Center.

171
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,980
And so Tank is a game we use internally for testing.

172
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,880
It's really a head to head, you destroy the other
team's tanks before you lose any tanks of your own.

173
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,730
And we built this game largely to test the various
invite and auto-matching features of Game Center.

174
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,100
So, I'll just demonstrate the Invite Flow here, so
I'll click on Invite and it'll will bring up a UI,

175
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,180
which lists the, what we call the multiplayer
sort of game screen, so this is a list of U,

176
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,550
this is a list of UI that we provide for game developers,
you don't have to do anything to write this UI.

177
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,420
Just ingrade this view controller into your code.

178
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:59,250
So you'll notice that there is a, a slot representing, that
says Auto-match, so if I were to click Play Now and any,

179
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,580
if there were other players for
example in the audience playing Tanks

180
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,940
and clicking Play Now the game would
automatically auto-match and start.

181
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,970
But in this demo we're going to
show the invite sequence instead.

182
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,590
So if I click on Invite Friend it will bring up a list
of all my friends and I'm going to select Ares of War

183
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,930
and then click Next and I can type him a quick message.

184
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,540
Then the Push notification came from
the other device and with my message

185
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,500
and so on invitee side I'll click Accept
Now and the Tank game will launch.

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,800
So you'll notice it launched automatically
into the Tank game

187
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,980
and into the multiplayer game screen and it was very quick.

188
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,500
But, the devices were connecting, trying
to establish a peer-to-peer connection

189
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,870
and now at this point they're both marked as ready.

190
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,030
So they have a peer-to-peer connection at this point
and if I go back to this device and click Play Now,

191
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,350
the game will start and they are connected inside the game.

192
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:07,320
So, I'll move the tanks around, just to show that
we're in the same game, they're tanks so they're very,

193
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,080
very slow and so as you can see the games are connected.

194
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,460
So, there really wasn't a lot of
code at all to get this to work.

195
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,080
In the later sessions you'll see actually
how simple it is to get this connected.

196
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,910
>> Mike Lampell: I just wanted to
show how quick and easy it all works.

197
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,070
Now I want to move in and talk about the
GameKit framework that enables all this to work.

198
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,600
And again we're just doing an overview here
to familiarize yourself with the pieces

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,220
and then the next two sessions we're going
to go into detail on how to use them.

200
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,800
Here's another look at the overall
layout of the GameKit framework.

201
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,180
There's basically broken down into the
general section of the multiplayer section,

202
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:53,190
we provide the ways to authenticate a user, submitting
scores, displaying leaderboards and using our standard UI

203
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,970
or a custom UI, submitting and displaying
achievements, again standard UI, custom UI,

204
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,990
establishing multiplayer games, an example
is just shown there and in game voice chat.

205
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,760
All these I'm going to talk about a little bit more.

206
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,080
So authenticating a user.

207
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:14,290
That was one of the requirements to be a Game Center
game is to authenticate a user when it starts up.

208
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,940
When do you do this?

209
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,730
You do this as soon as the UI can be presented.

210
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,420
What it's going to do is authenticate that
user through our servers if we can reach them,

211
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,050
but I got to mention that it's, it's all asynchronous,
you don't really know when that's going to happen,

212
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:35,770
it could be that we can't get to our servers, it
could be it takes a little bit to get to our servers,

213
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,960
it could be that player hasn't logged in yet and we have to
log them in, it could be they don't even have an account,

214
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm going to have to create an account and then log in.

215
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,360
So, we maybe presenting different UIs
depending on the state of that user.

216
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,560
But, as soon as we can log them in we present the
Welcome Back screen and return you an authentication.

217
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,300
Now it could be we'll return you an
authentication even if we can't get to our servers

218
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,550
and we'll cover that in the next sessions.

219
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:10,020
The player information that you get back from this like
I was saying before is the unique ID and the nickname.

220
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,970
And again, please use the unique ID as the persistent
information you store if you want to remember this person.

221
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,520
Leaderboards.

222
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:24,590
Leaderboards are, are a great way I think for adding
another dimension to games, letting people compete worldwide

223
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:33,630
and believe me, you know iPhone OS or iOS is
worldwide so, I mean it's a great feature and we tried

224
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,840
to make it real simple for you guys to add and use.

225
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,210
We provide a standard UI that you can just use to
display your leaderboards works in landscape or portrait,

226
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:50,810
comes with the basic filters I talked about or
you can customize the UI as they did for Quest

227
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,760
and in that case you get a fully immersive feel in it.

228
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,480
It's the same data, we're, we're keeping on our
servers and providing back to you when you ask

229
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,770
for it, but we, but we provide that flexibility.

230
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:09,460
The features, as I was saying, includes the filters
and you can also query the number of entries

231
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,660
so you can see how many friends of mine have
played this game which is the Friends Leaderboard,

232
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:20,210
how many people overall have played this
game and that's the, Everyone Leaderboard

233
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,410
or you, and you can also retrieve ranges.

234
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,960
So if, so if you have a player who's ranked
700th, you can retrieve a range around that player

235
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,720
and show him who's right above him or who's right below him.

236
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,730
Is, so leaderboard setup, this is done through
iTunes Connect, real simple and easy to use.

237
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,720
A lot of you have already used iTunes
Connect for some other features.

238
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,490
You enable it through iTunes Connect, you set the sort
order whether your leaderboard is ascending or descending,

239
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:59,230
you know golf games will be different than the first
person shooter game in the order they're sorted.

240
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:05,170
You specify the suffix, this is if it says
points or oranges or tanks or whatever it says

241
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,980
and you specify the format you want the numbers to be in.

242
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,190
So it's not only integers, we support
a lot of other formats.

243
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,140
We'll be going over those in later
sessions, the exact formats.

244
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,780
And for each of these we provide a way to localize
it into all the languages we support for this.

245
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,210
I want to talk a little bit about leaderboard usage.

246
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,920
One of the things is, there's one
leaderboard for all versions of your game.

247
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:36,020
So, a lot of people put out a game and then put out
another version and another version and another and I want

248
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,560
to say they're all referencing the same leaderboard
data, so it would be really bad game design

249
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,630
if at one point you changed your, your scoring mechanism
because all of that's going up to our same server.

250
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,980
Now each game has their own leaderboard
or leaderboards but all the versions

251
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,350
of your game share the same leaderboard or leaderboards.

252
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,230
Another thing I want to say is do not download all entries.

253
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,280
You may have millions of people who
have played your game, hopefully.

254
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,330
And you don't want to try and download
the entire leaderboard.

255
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,180
It's a bad user experience, it will take forever
you just download what the player needs to see.

256
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,900
So, here's another thing that's coming soon, it's
not available right now but due to strong demand,

257
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,050
we're making sure it gets in for the first
release and that's multiple leaderboards

258
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,610
and this is set up really similar to everything else.

259
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:33,950
You go to iTunes Connect and there you can specify
the different categories of leaderboards you want,

260
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,770
we also do something, we, you can have an overall
leaderboard skill, so if you have let's say a leaderboard

261
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,780
for easy and a leaderboard for medium and a
leaderboard for hard difficulties in your game,

262
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,460
if you want to do it that way, you can also have an
overall leaderboard and what this does is all scores,

263
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,210
we will automatically copy those up to the overall
leaderboard, you just have to submit to your category.

264
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,190
You can have leaderboards if you have like
a race track per track or whatever you want.

265
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,570
And again, you can have one overall
one, we'll take care of that for you.

266
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,160
If you don't have an overall leaderboard you have to
specify a default leaderboard because that's the one

267
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,210
that by default will come up in the Game
Center, in our Game Center application.

268
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:25,200
And the way this works different from what you're
doing today is there's another field you can specify

269
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,630
which category you're submitting this score for.

270
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,630
And then when you query the data
back, you use that same category.

271
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,100
All this we're going into more detail later.

272
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,680
Now I want to talk about achievements.

273
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Achievements are another great way to add dimension
to a game and I think we've made it real simple again.

274
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,430
Just like on leaderboards we provide a standard UI, you can
just use and then the achievements will look very similar

275
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:59,800
in your game as they do in Game Center or you can choose to
customize it and make it fully immersive within your game.

276
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,730
We provide the flexibility to do either.

277
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:08,120
I'm going to talk about what our achievements do because
it's a little bit different than what you might be used to.

278
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,580
One, we, we provide before and afters, so you can
have a description before the person has accomplished

279
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,700
that achievement and then a separate description for
after the person has accomplished that achievement.

280
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,170
So, if you want to be fun you go find
the hidden treasure and you know before

281
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,880
and then after "Congratulations
on finding the hidden treasure."

282
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm sure you can be much more creative on that.

283
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,200
We also offer progress on achievements, so if
one of your achievements might be, Kill 500 Orcs

284
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,500
and the players killed 400 so far, well they
haven't quite achieved the achievement yet,

285
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
but we can show progress towards it.

286
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,780
So if you report up that 80 percent of that achievements
been accomplished, we'd be able to show that.

287
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,270
We also support hidden achievements.

288
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:02,780
Hidden achievements are, they don't show up until
your game tells us to show it for that player.

289
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,560
They can be used for a lot of different things, if you
want to keep the achievements secret and just don't want

290
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,220
to let the user know about it until they've achieved
it and let them know, you can do it that way.

291
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,550
I think they're going to be really
useful for in app purchases.

292
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,770
So, for instance if you want to tie some achievements
to an in app purchase you start them out hidden,

293
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:28,010
when the person purchases that in app
purchase, you can then unhide those achievements

294
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,610
and so that's how you'd do it with hidden achievements.

295
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:37,520
You set them up the same way, through
iTunes Connect, real simple and easy.

296
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,630
So, again just like leaderboards, one set of achievements
per app, not as you have different versions of your app,

297
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,560
they all point to the same achievement
data so you have to kind of plan ahead

298
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,190
and design these out appropriately for your game.

299
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,550
Cause you would, it would be bad to give your user an
achievement and then put out another version of your game

300
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,940
and that achievements now something totally different.

301
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,010
So, just plan ahead when you do this and like
I said, you set it up through iTunes Connect.

302
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,750
Here's an example of how Quest customized
the leaderboard display for their game.

303
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,050
Now I want to move on to multiplayer.

304
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,150
Multiplayer is normally extremely
difficult thing to implement in games

305
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,730
and we've gone and made it much, much more simple.

306
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,580
Part of one of the things that we offer for multiplayer
is game invitations, in the example you just saw,

307
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,440
auto-matching, multiplayer UI,
matchmaking only, and in-game voice chat.

308
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,380
Let me go into these in a little bit more detail.

309
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,930
Multiplayer game invitations, I think you just
saw how that worked with the push notifications.

310
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,850
Push notifications have been really,
really robust and popular

311
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,310
and we're leveraging that for the in game invitations.

312
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,610
So wherever you are you can invite
a friend and wherever they are,

313
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,320
whatever they're doing they can get an
invite, so this is really mobile multiplayer.

314
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,940
They click Accept, as you saw, it launches the game.

315
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,730
Now, we also identify when a friend doesn't have your
application and in this case we'll give them the option

316
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,240
to go to the App Store and purchase your application.

317
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,530
So great way of discoverability of your game, you
leverage our entire social gaming network to do this.

318
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,770
We also, if they have your game but they don't
have the appropriate version to play against,

319
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,500
we take care of that also and tell
them to go to the App Store to update.

320
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,250
Auto-matching.

321
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,000
Auto-matching I think is an awesome feature that we
have, invites are great for friends to invite friends

322
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,180
but I just want to play a multiplayer game now,
I want to be able to play against anybody else

323
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,770
and our auto-matching service helps to do that.

324
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,620
Players launch the game, then they select
to be auto-matched, all the people selecting

325
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,590
to be auto-matched feed up to our server, our server
does some great logic, figures out the best matches

326
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,130
out of all those people and returns that information.

327
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,300
We can set up a peer-to-peer connection after that
or you can take these matches to your own server,

328
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,050
if you have your own server to host
the games, and then you're playing.

329
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,560
We also have some other features to extend our
auto-matching which I'll talk about briefly,

330
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,650
just player groups and player attributes.

331
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,700
So first, I just want to kind of do a
visual example of what I just explained

332
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,110
so make sure everybody gets it in their head.

333
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:22,280
We have, this is another game we created just to test out
stuff, this is Onword done by one of our engineers, Ken.

334
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,190
And, I choose to hit Multiplayer and that brings up our UI.

335
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,790
This is a UI we provide, it's consistent for all
the games so you, the user is very familiar on how

336
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,050
to do invites and how to do auto-matching.

337
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:42,440
And this game supports up to 2 to 4 players, went and made
it a 4 player game by hitting Add a Player a few times

338
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,860
and at this point, by default,
everybody comes up to be auto-matched.

339
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,220
So if I were to hit Play now, it's going
to go to our server and say auto-match me.

340
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,300
I could choose to invite a friend or not, we did an example
of that, I'm going to do auto-match for all these people.

341
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:04,020
That information gets compute, communicated
up to our Game Center auto-matching service

342
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,230
and I'm assuming you guys are writing popular games, right?

343
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,800
So there's going to be lots of
other people doing the same thing.

344
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,460
There's a probability thing, there's always going
to be lots of people wanting to play your game

345
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:24,610
and all that information gets fed into our services and
our services then do some great logic and figure out,

346
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,640
here's the best, here's a good grouping of those
people asking and it will do this for everybody.

347
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:36,200
So everybody will get matched and it does it very,
very quickly, passes that information back to the games

348
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,070
and then we can set up real quickly and easily, we've
provide the services to set up the peer-to-peer network

349
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:50,130
with all these people or like I said you can
take it to your server and connect up there.

350
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,330
So we support both of those.

351
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,600
We've built in the peer-to-peer
connectivity to make it super simple,

352
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,990
that's usually another very difficult
thing for games to develop.

353
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,320
We've done a lot of great technologies
there, we're really happy about that.

354
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,090
We should be able to connect just about
any two devices over Wi-Fi or over 3G.

355
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,320
So, now I want to talk about some of the expansions
we've put on and excuse the art a little bit.

356
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,360
Let's say you have a racing game and you have 4 race
tracks and what you want to do is have people select

357
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,950
which race track they want to race on and
then go out and match from there so that,

358
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,040
"Hey I want to race on the figure 8 one," and I get matched
to other people that want to race on the figure 8 track.

359
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,050
Well the way this works is we provide player groups.

360
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,020
You communicate up to our services the
groupings you want to be matched into

361
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,070
and we find the best matches within
anyone of those groupings.

362
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,750
Now we also provide some other functionality on top of this.

363
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:56,230
There's a way to query the service so you can find out,
see this one poor guy, he's the only guy that wants to play

364
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,630
that one track right now and you can query the
services and kind of see that that's happening

365
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:09,100
and either provide the user with some feedback or
automatically adjust them over to a more popular race track.

366
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,490
So that they will get matched.

367
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,350
All this is, you can create as many
of these player groups as you want

368
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,150
or you can adjust them dynamically during run time.

369
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:24,230
So now I want to talk about player attributes and
this will work, I'm going to do an example here

370
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,160
for like a dungeon crawler game, this will work
equally well for lots of different types of games.

371
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:36,190
There's a lot of different ways this could be used, if
you have the, let's say a music type game and you wanted

372
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,840
to create a band with a drummer, a guitarist and
whatever else, it could be used for that also.

373
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,310
But, this time, what we want to do is put a match
together with four different types of people

374
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,840
or different combinations of people in the same match.

375
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,440
And we do this with our player attributes, so we're going
to do a dungeon crawl, so now, just to make it simple,

376
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,740
I've gone back to one player group,
everybody communicates up to our service

377
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,340
and they communicate up also their player attributes.

378
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,260
And we get a little bit of logic based on this
on how to use those attributes to match people.

379
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,140
Again, we do our logic plus the extra
logic the game sends up to us and are able

380
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,550
to match back the people with the right player attributes.

381
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:23,260
These two extensions are really powerful and flexible
and I can't wait to see what you guys do with them.

382
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,710
This game has a range of players,
2 to 4 players can play it.

383
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:34,150
Your game may only be for 2, only for 4, if you tell us that
then that's the default we use and there is no adjusting.

384
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,380
But if you offer the range, the user can
select how many people they want to play with.

385
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,930
He has a racing game he wants to
race with three people right now.

386
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,400
Maybe he wants to race with only one other
person, his friend head to head, he can choose,

387
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,780
he can choose whether he wants to be auto-matched, he can
choose whether he wants to invite a friend, it's all there,

388
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,910
he can also add a personalized message for all
the friends he's inviting or one per friend.

389
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,580
He can do it all through our invite UI.

390
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,300
It's also a possibility of doing a combination of the two.

391
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,650
I can invite one of my friends and
then be Auto-Matched for two others.

392
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,170
So let's say we want to play a 4 player game but
I only have one other friend available right now.

393
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:22,430
We provide the UI to do this and we make it simple and we
make it consistent across all the games using multiplayer

394
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,890
in Game Center, so that the user gets
very familiar with how this works

395
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,400
and I think it will be great for
getting a lot of people to play.

396
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,090
Here's a feature I really love, so, in-game voice chat.

397
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,790
I'm playing a multiplayer game, I have a phone here.

398
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,560
I have a device capable of voice
and a speaker and everything on it.

399
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,920
I want to be able to talk to the people I'm playing with,
so we also hook into all of this in game voice chat.

400
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:56,300
We provide the controls for you to set the participation, so
if you have a 4 player game, you can have everybody talking

401
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,100
to everybody or you can choose to have Team A talking
amongst themselves and Team B talking amongst themselves,

402
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:08,920
there's a lot of flexibility here including
flexibility on the volume and new controls

403
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,060
and we'll be going over these in a lot more detail.

404
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,050
I just kind of wanted to do the high level here.

405
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:21,240
Went through Game Center application, that's where
people go to find everything and I talked about some

406
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,610
of the new features that you're not seeing right now.

407
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:31,850
Went through the framework which I think is powerful and
flexible, we allow you to do a lot of things really easily,

408
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,570
when it comes to, when we show you the code later, you'll
be really surprised at how little code it takes to add

409
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:41,010
like leaderboards, achievements or multiplayer to your game.

410
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:47,900
Now I want to talk about the difference between what
you're doing right now and what will be in production.

411
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,460
Part of which I already went over and that's
what you're seeing and developer's seed

412
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,120
for the Game Center application is slightly
different than what the consumer will see.

413
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,080
For one there's an extra tab.

414
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,800
One of the things we hide in the developer's
seed is the games you're playing or have played.

415
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,370
And we do this for your privacy.

416
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,500
So if you have friends that are working at a rival
company, they won't see all the games you're working on

417
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,680
and that's one of the reasons we do that.

418
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,370
So let me step through this in a little bit more detail.

419
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,480
First of all, development versus production,
we often call development sandbox,

420
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,560
so you will hear it referred to that way also.

421
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,870
This is the development area.

422
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:36,060
This is where you make new games or you
make new versions of current titles.

423
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:42,560
So, if you've already put out a version of your
game and you're working on the next version,

424
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,690
even though you already have one in production, the one
you're working on is in our development section sandbox.

425
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,800
I also want to mention the difference
in accounts and the data.

426
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,600
So, it's a separate nickname space
in sandbox versus production.

427
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,320
It can be the same iTunes account, but it
will be a separate nickname name space.

428
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,710
So any nicknames you're creating right now
on, in our sandbox, in our developer preview,

429
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,860
those are different than what you will have in production.

430
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,770
Just so you know.

431
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,140
But also the Game Center Service, servers are different.

432
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,870
You're hitting a different set of
servers than our production servers.

433
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:29,340
That means that all the matching you're doing is
to a different set of people than in production.

434
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,250
All the leaderboard data you have right now is
separate than what will be seen in production.

435
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,990
And the same is true with achievements.

436
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,940
This is great, so you can mess with this stuff, you
can play with it, you can change the way it works

437
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,040
and it won't affect anything you've already
shipped if you're working on another version of it.

438
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,710
You won't, you won't accidentally be matched with
somebody that's a, has a production version of your game.

439
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:58,260
And maybe you can take an unfair advantage of
them if you're working on a debugged version.

440
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:05,000
One other thing I failed to mention earlier which I
should mention is, we also have a compatibility matrix

441
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
that you can set up through iTunes
Connect, it doesn't really matter right now,

442
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,550
because nobody's shipped any Game Center games yet,
but once you've shipped one and let's say you come

443
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,870
out with a future version where you don't want
people to be matched that have the previous version.

444
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,900
You can set that up in iTunes Connect.

445
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,620
And so we call that the Compatibility and we will
be talking about that a little bit more later, too.

446
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:34,710
Once Game Center goes live it will be possible
for you to have production Game Center games

447
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,490
and development Game Center games
both on your device at the same time.

448
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,380
Now there'll only be one Game Center application
on your device that will be able to switch back

449
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,580
and forth between sandbox and production mode.

450
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,890
And what we're trying to do is make it
easy for you guys so it's not confusing

451
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,430
when you're in one or when you're in another.

452
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,750
Let me walk you through how that works a little bit.

453
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,440
I just want to talk about how you switch between the two.

454
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:12,230
This is some of the internal games we made to test out Game
Center and what we're going to do is first of all I want

455
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,830
to reinforce that this isn't really an issue
right now, I'm preparing you guys for the future

456
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,080
because I don't think we're going to have
another WWDC before the end of the year.

457
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,940
So what you do is, you logout of your
current game through Game Center.

458
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,030
I think I showed you before there's that Account
button, you hit the Account button and you hit Sign Out.

459
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:39,970
And that will sign you out of Game Center, then you go
back to here so you can select one of your applications,

460
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,670
you select the one you want to launch and
if it happens to be a sandbox application,

461
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,750
one in development, you get a different sign in.

462
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,150
It tells you you're going to be signing in to sandbox.

463
00:36:52,150 --> 00:37:01,050
And from here you can choose to use an existing
account and log into that or create a new account.

464
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,570
When you sign in here, you will now be signed into
our sandbox servers and if you go back to Game Center,

465
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,290
you'll have a , you'll see a slightly different Game Center.

466
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,360
One that's hitting our sandbox servers.

467
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,740
The third tab, the Games tab will disappear
and there will be a couple other changes,

468
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,440
but it will be getting all it's data from
our sandbox servers as will your game.

469
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:33,380
Now you can reverse the process easily and go back to a
production by logging out through Game Center application

470
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,100
and logging in using a production application.

471
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:44,990
Real simple and easy to do and we've tried to make it
obvious which one you're hitting, even in the password box.

472
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:52,600
One more little difference between some, what we've done
before at Apple and what we're doing now, as I said,

473
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Game Center is available as a developer preview right now.

474
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,380
We'll be out later this year for
consumer release and we'll give you plenty

475
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,260
of notice before it's available
so you'll know when to go out.

476
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:16,190
You can't ship any games on Game Center until then, but I
want to make sure you can get at the Game Center features

477
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:26,300
and it will be available, you can download it as
an IPSW from the developer site, you see here.

478
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,530
And again, no submissions to the App Store until later,
so I want to make sure everybody's aware of that.

479
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,550
So, let me summarize a little bit what we've gone through.

480
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:40,240
We've tried to make it real simple for you
to adopt all these Game Center features.

481
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,840
Easy ways to enhance social game play.

482
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,190
We provide the player identification to you, we
provide the leaderboards and achievements stuff for you

483
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:56,180
and we host it all on our servers, take care of sorting
and filtering it and all that for you, the game invites,

484
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,970
we've tried to streamline that as much as
possible, make it super simple and easy to use.

485
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,900
You can use our standard UI which allows the user a lot
of flexibility, they choose who they want to invite,

486
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,240
they choose if they want to invite or do auto-matching.

487
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,940
We also provide the ability for
you to just do auto-matching.

488
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,610
There's no UI involved in it.

489
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,940
It's real quick and easy, your game
says auto-match this person, it goes up,

490
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,470
they get auto-matched and they're in a game.

491
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:28,500
So, all that we've tried to streamline, take something
very difficult and hard to do and make it real easy.

492
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,320
We also do the connectivity layer underneath for
peer-to-peer connectivity, very, very robust.

493
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,940
We've done some amazing things there and I'm really excited.

494
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,190
Can't wait until that's all out
and you guys can try all that.

495
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,150
Everything is really flexible.

496
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,500
We've provided a lot more features than
are normally available for these things to,

497
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,160
we know we've got a wide variety of games out
there and we wanted to appeal to all of them.

498
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,520
We want the wide variety of games that you guys are
providing and so we've put a lot of flexibility in here.

499
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,130
Including the skin ability in most of these screens
so that you can make them totally immersive,

500
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,300
use the data we're giving you and make them fit your game.

501
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,620
We've also, as you saw as we were going through here,

502
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,050
I hit some of the viral distribution
options we offer in Game Center.

503
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,220
It's been one of the things we focused on.

504
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,620
We want to help sell your game so we've
put a lot of discoverability things

505
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,980
in Game Center and we talked about a lot of them.

506
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,820
There's more and I think it's going
to be great for the entire community.

507
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,190
Players will be able to find great games.

508
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,990
They'll be able to use their friends to
help find recommendations for new games,

509
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,250
they'll get the friend invites which
they, give them the ability to get it.

510
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,430
There's a lot of things in there and
I'm really excited about all that.

511
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:45,720
