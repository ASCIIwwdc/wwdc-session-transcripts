WEBVTT

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.220
>> Darin Adler: Welcome to the Safari, Internet
and Web State of the Union [applause and cheering].

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.200
Let's start with Safari.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.610
Safari is our blazing fast web browser.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.420
It's got innovative features like Top
Sites that watches the sites you use,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.290
puts them in a beautiful easy to click preview.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.410
Innovations like full history search.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.890
Type a word and any website you've been to recently with
that word shows up, Cover flow display, just click on it.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.800
Safari leads in web standards and the same Safari that
many of you use on Mac is the same Safari on Windows,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:02.300
and the same Safari that we brought to iPhone,
revolutionizing what it means to be a mobile web browser,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.100
and the same Safari that creates the magical
experience of touching the web on iPad.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:21.700
I'm pleased to announce that there are
over 200 million devices with Safari.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.510
Wow!

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.400
[ Applause ]

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.030
Now a lot of you are software developers so
you're just as interested at what's inside Safari.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.500
WebKit is Safari's open source engine and
this is a great place to talk about WebKit.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.570
It was here five years ago today at the Developers
Conference at WWDC where we changed Safari

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.240
from an open source project into an open community.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.920
Apple created mailing lists, bug databases, source code
repositories, everything that we need to work on WebKit

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.630
in collaboration with other software
developers around the world.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:23.230
And WebKit has been a huge success
on Mac, on Windows and on Linux;

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.510
lots of applications have been built on top of WebKit.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:38.310
In fact, that includes just a few of those that are here and
they're not just web browsers, mail apps, chat apps, games,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.160
development tools and the same on iOS, tons of apps.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.850
I'm particularly proud of how WebKit has
become the standard on the mobile web.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.060
Nokia uses WebKit for the web browser in their smartphones.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:09.780
Android uses it, Palm uses it and RIM has announced
that in the future Blackberry's will use WebKit.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.510
Over half a billion devices out there with WebKit.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.910
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.190
So when you've got a half a billion WebKit
out there, that gives you an opportunity.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:41.380
It's an opportunity to popularize web standards.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.500
At Apple we believe in web standards.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.820
In fact when it comes to web technology,
standards are how we innovate.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
Take the Acid2 test.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.870
This is a test of web standards and Safari
was the first web browser to pass this test.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.200
If fact it was over two years before
any other popular web browser passed it.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.170
Or consider the Acid3 test.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:24.220
This is a test of web standards including more of the
dynamic standards used in next generation websites

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.420
and Safari was also the first browser to pass the
Acid3 test, all 100 parts, it's an extensive test.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.840
When it comes to standards these days the
most exciting thing going on is HTML5.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.980
What is HTML5?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:51.590
Well, HTML5 includes video and audio
elements and they have a rich scripting API.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:01.860
CSS includes animations and transforms, which allows you to
have elements that move on your web page with almost no code

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.330
and CSS reflections, gradient's and masks make it
possible to have beautiful designs on web pages

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.270
without pre-rendering them in an image editor program.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.390
Vector graphics and canvas lets you draw arbitrary graphics.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.420
You could put a graph on your page or
some other kind of image transform;

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.160
apply to an image, again without pre-rendering.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.460
HTML5 offline support allows you to take a
web application and have it run even offline

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.880
on the user's machine and store data in a offline database.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:53.860
Now just like with Acid2 and with Acid3
with HTML5 Safari has been leading.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.380
With all these features HTML5, video,
audio, canvas, CSS animations, transforms,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.450
Safari was the first browser to implement.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:14.350
Everything I've been talking about works in Safari on the
Mac, Safari on Windows, iPod, iPod touch, iPhone and iPad.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.740
But this is not just a Safari story.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.780
All the major web browsers have
announced support for HTML5, every one.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.580
Now HTML5 has got amazing momentum.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.970
Right now all sorts of websites are using HTML5.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:44.420
Here are just a few of them.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.370
I'd like you to see HTML5 in action.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:55.720
So to do that I'd like to invite Adele Peterson, a
manager in my Safari and WebKit engineering team to come

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.890
up on stage and put it through its paces [applause].

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.340
>> Adele Peterson: Thanks, Darin.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.030
Hi, everyone.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.320
So we recently put up a web page on apple.com to show
you some of the power of HTML5 and web standards.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.740
Let's take a look!

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.790
So here's the web page and if you scroll down
you'll see we have a bunch of demos here.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.050
What's really cool is that for you as developers you can
dig into the code and learn more about these technologies

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.190
and how to use them so the place to
do that is the Safari Dev Centers.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.650
We're going to go there and take
a look at a few of these demos.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:41.170
Okay let's check out these photo transitions.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.000
So now with a few lines of CSS it's pretty
straight forward to create affects like this.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.850
We've got a fade through, a slide in, a dissolve,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:06.470
and then when you want to start getting fancy you can use 3D
CSS transforms to do some of these affects like an unfold,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:20.260
or a horizontal flip, or a multiflip, rotate in, I love the
little bounce there at the end look lets watch that again

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.930
and then there's a cube, again see a little bounce.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.720
I mean this is something that you don't
really see right there on the web right now

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.910
until now with HTML5, really powerful stuff.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.990
So here we have a virtual tour
of the Fifth Avenue Apple Store.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:49.960
So this is done using CSS transforms and
photos were taken from inside the cube

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.590
and so using those 3D transforms we're able
to build up this 3D scene and as you scroll

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:03.430
around you're actually rotating the images as
they're transformed and this is all built right

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.160
into your web browser with CSS and HTML5.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:14.460
So these are just a few demos that we put up to
show you the power of HTML5 and web standards

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:22.440
but it's actually being used right now on the web and
I'd like to show you a few examples of that on the iPad.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:36.000
So on Vimeo you can watch video using their HTML5 player
and then NPR offers news and music with HTML5 audio,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.750
and then on Life you've got these really
beautiful photographic slide shows

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.000
that are all done using web standards.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.940
So it's not just media companies.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:58.720
Sites like Nike have done this really great product
gallery using web standards that works great on iPad.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:06.000
You can flick it, have that whole experience.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.410
And then on a site like Virgin America with their online
ticketing site it really shows how web standards can work

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.390
for e-commerce too.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:22.770
So there are all these sites out there actually
using this technology, it's really powerful stuff,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.540
built right into your web browser and that's HTML5.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.020
Back to your Darin [applause].

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:37.490
>> Darin Adler: Wow, Adele showed us some great HTML5
technology demos and you get the source code for those

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.690
at the Dev Center and also sites using HTML5 now.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:49.330
I'm pleased to announce our next major release of Safari.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.510
Safari 5.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:59.770
[ Applause ]

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:07.200
This is available for Mac and for Windows and there are five
things you need to know about Safari 5 so let's get started.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:17.760
The first thing you need to know is that
Safari 5 has over a dozen new HTML5 features.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.200
I don't have time to go through all of
them, I'll just tell you about a few.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:31.230
Full screen video: The HTML5 video
element, the video up in full screen.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:38.540
Closed Captioning: HTML5 video with captions in it.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.920
Geolocation: So your website can tell where
the user is and customize the content.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:51.880
We protect the user's privacy by
asking for permission and a bunch more.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.570
Over a dozen new HTML5 features.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:05.370
The second thing you need to know about Safari 5 is that
it's blazing fast; it's the world's fastest web browser.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:13.880
We took a browser that was already the worlds fastest and
made it even faster and as you can see from this chart it's

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:21.150
about three times faster than Firefox
and faster than either Chrome or Opera.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.710
Blazing fast performance.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:33.220
The third thing you need to know about HTML5 is Reader.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.950
So Reader is a feature that's great
for a webpage like this one.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.350
It's got an article on it but it's
also got a lot of other things.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:52.280
It's got links that take you to other parts
of the website, a lot of distractions.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:13:01.140
So when Reader sees that a website has an article on it,
it puts this button up on the side of your address bar

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:08.510
and when you click the button Reader
brings up a clean view of the article.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.490
[ Applause ]

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:21.090
It's got nice big text, no distractions and
very easy to read and you know the thing

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:27.310
about this is the continuous view shows you the whole
article so you don't have to go find the next page button

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.470
to go to the next page of the article [applause].

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.300
Now we included a few of the commands you use most.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.800
There's a way to make the text even bigger or smaller.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:52.220
It's easy to print and you can click to mail and
I love how when you mail an article you get a link

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.070
to the original article and then a clean copy.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:05.460
So, Adele, would you come up here
and show us Reader in action.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:11.510
>> Adele: I'm really excited to show you guys Reader,
it's one of my favorite features, so let's get started.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:18.530
[ Pause in speaking ]

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:23.680
So here we have a pretty standard web
page, probably come across a lot of these

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.170
in your browsing habits but there's
kind of a lot going on here.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.050
Sometimes you just want to read the article
so Reader's detected the article and I'm going

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.220
to just go up here to this button and click it.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.200
Let's see that again actually.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:57.720
Nice. So as Darin was telling you, you get this really nice
clean layout and Reader has loaded the whole article for me

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:05.170
so I don't have to break my concentration to go and search
for those next page links and there's some handy controls.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:11.430
You can make your text bigger or smaller and
Reader actually remembers the setting for you

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:17.400
so as you're reading other articles you
get your preferred text size each time.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:26.580
It's also really convenient to email articles, I'll just
send this and as Darin mentioned you've got the link

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.900
up there at the top so you're friend
can go get the same clean layout

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:38.830
and then check out the original site if they want.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.740
Oh how about not.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.820
So it's also really straight forward to print an
article and you get again that same clean layout

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.180
and then when you're done to exit Reader all
you have to do is click this close button.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.570
And that's Reader.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.070
You guys are going to love it!

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.200
[ Applause ]

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.070
>> Darin: Thanks, Adele.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.660
So you know Reader is a great feature
and it's something that I use every day.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:15.340
So the fourth thing you need to know about HTML5.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:23.510
We've made some changes to the
search field, we've added Bing.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.450
[ Pause in speaking and applause ]

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.500
So Bing is available as an option in the
search field and if you type a search

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.400
in there you get suggestions just like today.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:45.420
Down here in the same menu are your
choices of which search you'd like to use.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:53.110
Google, Yahoo!, which was previously available on
Safari on Windows and iPhone but is now available on Mac

00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:01.810
as well, starting with Safari 5 and Bing.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:15.200
Safari 5 has this Bing option on Mac and on Windows
and it's also available on iPhone and iPod touch.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:24.700
So Microsoft is doing some amazing things with Bing
and Jeff Henshaw is here from Bing to show them to you.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.430
Jeff.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.850
[ Applause ]

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.100
>> Jeff Henshaw: Thanks everybody.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:38.860
I use a lot of Apple products and I enjoy them, I
enjoy them all tremendously and because of that I tend

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:46.130
to think I have a better design sense than the
average consumer and I also I value my privacy a lot,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:53.560
so before I even start this demo I'm going to fix Safari
5 by making a quick little adjustment here [laughter].

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.720
Ah that feels so much better.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.500
So one of the best reasons to use Bing is our
relentless focus on creating search experiences

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:13.210
that go beyond the basic 10 blue links and give you richer
tools and richer information to help you make the decisions

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.940
and find the results that you care about.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.750
That's evident on our search results
page where you'll see Bing doing things

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:27.960
like dynamically assembling intelligent cards of
information, where we look ahead into the target sites

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.400
and find the information that's going to be most relevant
to you and surface it earlier in your search experience

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.190
to help you get where you're going faster,
well beyond the basic 10 blue links.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.060
People have appreciated this.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:48.830
Nowhere more so than in the Bing homepage which everyday
gives people a new curated exceptional photograph.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:54.060
This is our photo from today with hover hotspots
that let you explore your world and we found

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.160
that people have adored this experience so much that they're
setting Bing as their homepage and coming here every day

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.810
to learn a little bit more about their
world and find something interesting.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:09.640
So when Apple called us a couple of weeks ago we
started to have some discussion about what could we do

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:17.800
with the search experience to really leverage
the power of HTML5 on Safari 5 and what we did

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:25.150
up in Redmond is we took a handful of engineers and spent
about a week exploring what would be possible and we had

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.590
such a productive week and the collaboration
with Apple was so fruitful that we decided

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.820
to bring it down here and show it to you today.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.380
So I've very pleased to introduce
to you an early exploration

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.460
into HTML5 and Safari 5 powered search experiences.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:47.340
We'll go from the Bing.com that you see today, to a
brand new Bing home page powered by HTML5 [applause].

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.420
Thank you very much.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.070
We're very excited about this.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:20:00.720
You can see right away that we're using things like image
transforms from HTML5 to give a perspective based view

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.450
on that homepage image that people
have come to love so much.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.260
The information at the bottom is being dynamically
updated from real time data feed so instead of looking

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.830
at a static still page that doesn't reflect the
world around you, you're getting more information,

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.320
more dynamic assembled in real time right away.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.460
Let's go ahead and run a query.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:29.160
One of the things you're going to notice is that in the
old web days when you did a query you're page would blank,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.550
completely refresh and you'd get a
brand new page with your search results.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:38.980
I'm planning a trip to Hawaii so let's go take a look at
Honolulu and you'll notice when I run the query instead

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:45.000
of the page refreshing we dynamically reassemble
the page without it blanking [applause].

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:54.900
Another thing you're going to notice is these dynamic
cards that we're building are now alive and vibrant

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.290
with more information coming into
them with HTML5 animations.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.040
So instead of having just a few
fields down here that don't change,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.580
we actually get additional information that scrolls by.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.480
When I see what I want I can hover on it
to freeze it and click through if I want

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.420
and if you've ever used the home screen on
an iPhone or an iPad you'll be very familiar

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.560
with this tile based interface that'll let you
flip around the information that you care about,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.250
a much, much more vibrant search experience.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:28.300
A little later on this month we're going to be releasing
some new updates to Bing including a tabbed interface

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:34.270
across the top to help you very quickly flip
through different categories of search results.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.880
With HTML5 we took it to the next level.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.590
I can hover over a tab and get a preview of
that content without even having to click.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.860
So if I want to see a map it's just a hover.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:52.910
If I want to check the weather at a target location
I can hover and not only do I get the typical table

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:59.020
of forecast it'll actually dynamically build an
animation to give you a much more vibrant sense

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.440
of what the weather might be like in that location.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.960
This HTML5 work that we've done in Safari
5 on the Mac and PC translates directly

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.910
to Apple's mobile devices, the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:21.870
I'd like to switch over to our first phone here, phone
number one and I'm going to go ahead and do a similar query

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.670
at the upcoming new Bing Mobile m.bing.com site.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:31.150
If I check on Hawaii flowers for
example and run this search it's going

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.520
to give me a search interface that
we're fairly familiar with.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:42.440
I'm going to switch over to images and go to more
results to show you the new image results interface

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.520
that we've built in HTML5 for the iPhone and iPod touch.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.640
You'll notice first of all it's got a gorgeous image browse.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.530
I can actually scroll this with a gesture and you'll notice

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.950
that the scroll is infinite and
it clips to the top of each tile.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:06.300
It gives you the feeling of a native application but
this is all being done in Safari 5 on the mobile device.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.920
As I begin to go look at individual images you'll notice
the transforms and animations are completely fluid

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:21.480
and the interface is fully gesture aware so I'm swiping with
my finger to swipe through this image result catalogue just

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.060
as easily as I would do it in a native application.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:31.460
So that's how powerful HTML5 can be as
we move from the PC to mobile devices.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.280
If we could go back to the PC I would like
to take a look at one more query here.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:43.060
I'm going to go ahead and begin the search
again you notice no jarring transitions.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.550
We're going to continue to explore these possibilities
with Apple and look to deliver these later on this year

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.160
but I hope for now you've really enjoyed this
sneak peak as much as we've enjoyed building it.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.500
Thank you very much everybody.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.060
[ Applause ]

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.370
>> Darin: Pretty cool!

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.780
So some changes to search.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:11.390
The fifth thing you need to know about HTML5
is that we've improved our Developer Tools.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:19.610
So a lot of you may already be aware of Developer
Tools built into Safari and this is the hub

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.240
of Developer Tools, what we call the web inspector.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.750
To turn on the developer tools all you need to
do is go into the Advanced preferences in Safari

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:36.700
and check this check box it says Show Develop menu,
that turns on the Develop menu and all the tools.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:42.080
In Safari 5 we have a new timeline panel and this
shows you what's going on when you load a web page,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.780
or when you click on a button, or do anything and you
can see network activity, you can see the time it takes

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.680
for rendering, you can see your scripts running,
everything that's going on, it's a great way to figure

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.910
out exactly what's happening and speed up your website.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:07.020
Now besides the timeline panel, we have edit as HTML
in the web inspector so this lets you edit a tag

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.090
and just change the markup around, it's really handy.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.580
Attribute editing lets you kind of
tab through the different attributes,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.130
add a new one, just tab key and type in a few letters.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:27.110
Color editing is great for tweaking colors and you can
view them in different color spaces and now event listeners

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:32.690
which used to be invisible in the web inspector can be seen
in there so you can you've got an element that you click

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.620
on you can see what codes going to run when it clicks.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:43.400
So these are a few of the improvements
to Developer Tools in Safari 5.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:57.290
Now besides these five things that you need to know about
Safari 5, there's actually a sixth that's just for you.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.500
Safari 5 has extensions.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:07.380
[ Applause ]

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.760
It's everything that developers
need to make Safari extensions.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:20.590
So extension can add an extension bar like
this one, or add a tool bar button like that.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:31.520
An extension can add like a balloon that points
to a part of a page like the one you see up here,

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:38.510
or remove something from a page, add
something from a page, or move things around.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.200
Safari extensions are easy to install.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:49.090
You don't have to quit the browser to install an extension
or restart it, you can enable or disable an extension just

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:59.090
with one click and you build Safari extensions
with the same HTML5 that you use to make web pages,

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.530
with a few additions to let you
do things like add those bars.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:11.570
If you know how to make a webpage, you already
know what you need to start writing an extension.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:16.560
Extensions are signed with a digital
signature and any update

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.000
to the extension has to be signed with that same signature.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.820
That means that you know the updates came from the same
developer who made the original and the HTML5 doesn't run

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:37.220
with any native code so it's sandboxed, it
can't get at the files on the users machine.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:44.660
Safari 5 includes an extension builder tool and you use
the web inspector while you're developing extensions

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.450
but you're also going to use this extension builder.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:53.640
You don't have to create a text file listing all the
scripts and files that you're going to work with;

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.170
instead you just fill out a form and
push a button to build your extension.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:13.910
So we asked a handpicked set of developers to take a
look at Safari extensions and see what they could do

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:21.400
and I'm really happy to introduce you to a few
of them and have them show you what they've done.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.020
So let's get started.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:29.840
Roustem Karimov from Agile Web
Solutions, makers of 1Password is here.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.130
[ Applause ]

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:37.480
>> Roustem Karimov: Thanks Darin.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:44.210
Today every one of us has to remember many different
passwords and to make sure all these passwords are secure.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.380
With our app you need to remember just one.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.970
We had just a few days to play with the
extensions API and wanted to show some

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.080
of the cool features that are possible with Safari 5.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:04.650
All information on 1Password is protected by a single master
password and we're entering it right now to get access.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:12.200
This is the 1Password overview screen.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.080
Everything you see here is built using open web standards.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.100
On the left, you see logins.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.290
They help you to quickly login to different websites.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:31.940
In the center identities they help with signing up
for new online accounts and on the right credit cards.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.050
1Password can fill them for you when you're shopping online.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:41.420
Okay let's say we're browsing the web
and would like to check our email.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:47.100
Here we click on a login and instead
of typing the URL, entering user name,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:52.360
password and clicking login button
everything is done for us.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.070
As you can see [applause].

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:02.690
As you can see I was able to log
in with just a single click.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.310
Great! Let's do something else.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:10.250
Let's try we want to create a new account at Apple Store.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:18.500
Again we can type everything ourselves but it's easier and
much faster to simply drag and drop one of our identities.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:25.970
[ Applause ]

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.170
Or you can try Wendy's identity instead.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:42.880
Better! As you can see 1Password filled everything for you,
it generates a strong password and all this data was saved

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:50.940
in 1Password and the most amazing thing
is just a week ago none of this existed.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.500
Let's applaud 1Password before we go.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.670
[ Applause ]

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.500
Thank you.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:10.900
[ Applause ]

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.500
>> Darin: Alright, Sandeep Gupta is here from Yahoo.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.110
[ Applause ]

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.420
>> Sandeep Gupta: Thank you Darin.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.030
So hi I'm Sandeep.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.240
This is Michael we're here from Yahoo!

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.740
to show you this extension we put
together for new version Safari.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.370
So Yahoo! is the leading internet
provider for sports, news and finance.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:37.350
So we thought it would be great to take a piece of that
and put it into an extension bar so here's what we've got.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:44.410
Here you see in the extensions bar all the quotes you
usually track on the site and the easy way to get to.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.560
You can scroll through them individually,
where you get the news headlines

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.680
for that stock, or you can get the ticker mode.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.570
This is really so you can see how
much money you're losing [laughter].

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.320
Usually it's my favorite mode.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:05.980
Or you could click on a stock, it will take you
to the finance page that you all know and love,

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.230
you can click on a headline and
go straight to that news article.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.620
It's that easy.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.000
Configuring this bar is just as easy.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:23.180
If I want to check out what's in my bar I could just go
to the main site and then we automatically synch the bar

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.930
to any stock you search for on the site before.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:37.430
If I want to add a stock I simply search for it in the bar
and it is automatically added to the bar, it's that easy.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.690
The goal here of course is making configuring
the bar as easy as possible and getting access

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.590
to information you need without the hassle.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.280
If you want to go further and dig
more customized you go to details

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.950
and from there you can manually add or delete stocks.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.810
We also do a web search for you there just in place
in case you want to look out what's on the web.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:03.910
So the amazing thing for us was
how quickly this came together.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:09.120
We built on Yahoo's powerful YQL query language
to cloud source all of this great data,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.770
then we hooked into the Safari extensions
bar and there's full injected scripts

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.030
to put this together in just a day or two.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.230
That's pretty amazing.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.500
That's it and I hope you get a
lot of joy out of it thank you!

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:27.490
[ Applause ]

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.660
>> Darin: Just a few days, that's great.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.500
Charles Osborne from MLB Advanced Media.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:42.580
[Applause]

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.420
>> Charles Osborne: Hi everyone I'm Charles Osborne this is
Jon Ferrer we're from MLB Advanced Media

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.910
and we are here today to show you the MLB Toolbar.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:58.780
The toolbar is a great way to keep track of the day's games
and you see all the key information for each game in an easy

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.250
to read and use toolbar so let's walk through it.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.370
So I'll open up the tool bar you'll see the date, the score,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:10.890
if the game is live you'll see the inning,
man on base indicator, and the count.

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:13.150
One cool thing about the man on
base indicator is if you roll

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:19.220
over the base you'll see the players
actually on the base [applause].

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.080
If you want to listen to the game
you just click on the listen button

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.910
and it launches the premium audio and stats app.

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:32.100
If you want to watch the game, click the
watch icon, it launches our MLBTV app.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.470
You'll see whose pitching; you'll
see whose at bat and their records.

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.650
Now the toolbar automatically scrolls through the
games in 5 second increments but if you want to pause

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:45.650
on a specific game you just hit the pause
button or you can manually go back and forth.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:51.580
Now another feature we really like about this and
we're excited about is what we call live look-ins.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.360
So what live look-ins are if there's something exciting
going on right now in a game, let's say there's a no hitter

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.420
in progress, we're able to broadcast
a portion of that game to you live.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.800
So if a live look-in becomes available you'll see an
alert come up on the tool bar, click the watch now button

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.500
and the live look-in launches on our scoreboard page.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:21.630
[ Applause ]

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.510
Love that.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:30.430
So using web standard technologies and the Safari
extension API, we're able to pull this together with,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.930
you know it truly showcases some of the best of
our live game coverage and multimedia capabilities

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.200
in about two days, so that's the toolbar.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.910
Thank you very much [applause].

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.500
>> Darin: So next up Cabel Sasser is here from Panic.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.780
[ Applause ]

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.790
>> Cabel Sasser: Hello, hello!

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.100
Super excited to be here right now.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.500
So at Panic we make an app called Coda and Coda is an
all in one development environment, thanks clapping guy,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.670
for people who make web pages, for
people who hand code web pages.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:09.610
So with Coda we feel like we're doing a pretty
good job for the developer but when we first heard

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:15.980
about Safari extensions we asked ourselves is there anything
we can do for the client, the person who's paying the bills,

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:21.810
or the marketing person, or the person who's most likely to
leave you that voicemail and say hey I saw the new webpage

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.150
but can you move that thing over to that other
thing and can you make that one thing bigger

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.210
and you know nobody likes getting
those emails or phone calls so our idea

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.480
for Safari extension is something we're calling Coda Notes.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.430
So with Coda Notes when you click the
new Coda Notes toolbar button you'll see

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:42.400
that we've basically added some new features to Safari
that let you annotate web pages right within the browser.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.150
So I can pull up our webpage and you know circle
our logo and make a note that it's pretty old

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.890
because it is and I would like to change it.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.190
We have a highlighter here so I
can highlight a couple of sections.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:01.780
We have of course sticky notes so I can come in here and
say you know make the logo bigger, or you know add as many

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:09.890
of those as you want on a page and one interesting thing
that we did is we added a live text tool so there are times

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:14.260
when marketing wants to change copy on a webpage
but designers and developers are concerned

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.860
about how that's going to look, like I only want it to
be two sentences, don't put a bunch of words in there.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.920
With the live text tool you can come in and
actually edit the text on the page directly,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.090
see how it looks right on the webpage
without any technical knowledge whatsoever.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.500
So I've done a...

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:35.240
[ Applause ]

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.370
I've done a pretty terrible job annotating this
webpage so I will click the send notes button

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:46.510
and without even leaving Safari it shrinks down onto
this little postcard, you can add your comments,

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:51.890
here's what I'm thinking, [applause] thanks,
set your recipient, set who it's from,

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.500
click this nice looking send notes
button, of course the stamp comes down

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.000
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.190
[ Applause ]

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:07.490
I don't know why we did that yeah and that's it.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.250
Yeah it's off, the developer gets an
email with a screen shot of the annotation

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.340
which is something we could never do before, thanks to the
extensions we can actually take a screen shot of the tab,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:21.620
they can see my notes, they can see my drawings and
in just a few seconds I've accomplished something

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.710
that would have taken a long time to do before.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.430
So for us this took four days but
that's cool but to me way cooler

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.850
than that is the fact that we added a feature to Safari.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.330
I mean that's unheard of.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:37.070
We did it in a way that's clean, it's
not hacky, it's using web standards

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.750
and you know we added something to
the functionality of the browser.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.500
So that is awesome and we think you guys will
also find it awesome so thanks for listening.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.610
>> Darin: Beautiful, beautiful.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:02.500
Alright, Michael Gundlach is here from BetaFish.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.450
[ Applause ]

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.000
>> Michael Gundlach: Hi everybody.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.980
So the BetaFish thing is a lie actually they
just needed something to put on the screen there.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.910
I'm a freelance developer.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.350
I'm the author of AdBlock for Chrome so I've
been working on AdBlock since about December.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.730
It's getting more and more users.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.810
I'm not supposed to tell you how many users
but it's the most popular extension for Chrome

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.810
and over the weekend I ported it to Safari.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:24.440
So let's take a look.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.100
[ Laughter ]

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.510
So here's a page that had some ads all over
it across the top on the sides and stuff

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.210
and let's see how it looks when we turn on AdBlock.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.660
So the cool thing about AdBlock is that unlike
other extensions that you use for a particular task

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.310
or on a particular website AdBlock is kind of a no brainer.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.330
It's a fire and forget you turn it on and by
default it sucks down list of ads from the web

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.390
and keeps it updated fro you so hopefully
you'll just forget you have it installed

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.080
at all, it just makes the world a better place.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.280
So we'll turn it on, we are protected,
thank you AdBlock let's see how this works.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.700
Now we'll reload this page now that we turn
on AdBlock and hopefully it will look better.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.820
There we go.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.570
Okay [applause] let's do the before and after here.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:08.630
We have before we have some sort of flying
toaster something and after that's much better.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:13.100
So not only does this look better, it actually loaded
more quickly as well because there's a feature in Safari

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.770
that isn't in Chrome yet which is you can prevent
resources from being downloaded if you don't want them

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.300
so in my case anything that's an ad we
don't download yeah pretty cool [applause].

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.630
So this is good for your bandwidth.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.690
This is good for your bandwidth.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.660
It's good for your load time.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.880
I did a test on Saturday on a domain and it took it 8.5
seconds to load the page with ads and with AdBlock it went

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.010
to 1.5 seconds, just didn't download
those resources, it's pure savings.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.880
It's also better for your privacy because
you're not downloading things like web trackers

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.900
that let people know that you're on the page.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.530
So in addition to the standard stuff that you get for free
just by installing AdBlock if there's something you don't

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:49.240
like on the page then you can block
it with our custom blacklist rules.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.910
So you can make a new blacklist rule and just
say I don't want to see this part of the page.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:57.580
If you don't know AdBlock Plus's filter
syntax or CSS selectors that's OK because most

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.650
of our users are casual users, so we
made a wizard for them to do this.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.510
So let's open up the blacklist wizard here.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.860
Show the blacklist wizard and I just click on the
thing on the page I don't like so maybe I don't

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.290
like this launch this slideshow
thing let's see how this works

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:16.670
and the cool thing is you have this slider you just say how
much of the page you don't want to see so maybe I'll say

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:21.050
that I don't want to see the article body, maybe I
don't like articles on this place, so it looks good.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.340
[ Laughter ]

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.640
Thank you blacklist wizard and it re-loads and now
that's gone forever so you didn't have to know how

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.310
to do CSS selectors, you don't have
to do the filter syntax, it just works

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:34.220
and if you are advanced you can create arbitrary blacklists
and whitelists entries on your AdBlock options page.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.160
So I don't have time to show you all of the options but
I wanted to mention one thing in the options which is

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.720
that if everyone hates image ads, everyone hates flash
ads but if you like text ads and find them useful,

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.400
and a lot of my users do then you can turn them on with one
click here, I actually find it nice when you do a search

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.580
on Google to see text ads so this way don't
have to go searching through your filters

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.750
to find what is or isn't related to text ads.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.020
Okay that's all I have time for.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.010
You can go to safariadblock.com later today to get the code.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:00.700
Also I have a porting library if you want to use it to
port your Chrome extensions to Safari it abstracts all

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.250
of the differences between them and finally I'm one guy.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:03.980
I don't have Yahoo!

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.730
behind me so I would love your help.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.760
This is open source and you could work on a common
code base for Chrome and Safari and help lots of people

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.460
who have this installed and make the world a better place.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.500
Thanks very much.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:23.080
[ Applause and cheering ]

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.800
>> Darin: So just a few days these
guys did all of this amazing work.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.800
Imagine what you can do.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:42.200
So Safari extensions: Customize Safari and modify
web pages, install without quitting the browser,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:48.730
one click to turn it off, built with
the same HTML5 standards that you use

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:55.140
to make web pages, secure and a free developer program.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.310
Well that's Safari 5.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.290
Over a dozen new HTML5 features.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:14.470
Blazing fast performance, fastest browser in the world,
Reader, new options for search, improved developer tools

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.500
and everything you need to develop Safari extensions.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:26.650
[ Applause ]

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.140
So I'm pleased to announce that Safari
5 is available for download today.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.140
[ Applause ]
