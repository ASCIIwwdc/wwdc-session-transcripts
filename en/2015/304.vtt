[Applause]

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:25.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; PAUL TURNER: Thank you.

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:26.636 A:middle
Thank you, everyone.

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:27.646 A:middle
Thanks for joining us here.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.906 A:middle
Thank you for joining
us for session 304.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:33.096 A:middle
Welcome. My name is
Paul Turner and I'm one

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:35.706 A:middle
of the engineering managers
for iTunes, but I also --

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:37.266 A:middle
some of the teams that I lead,

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.946 A:middle
one of the teams is
the best teams at Apple

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:41.226 A:middle
and that's the team that
manages the logistics

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.106 A:middle
and release control for
all of Apple's own apps.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.466 A:middle
And we use iTunes Connect,
just like you guys.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:50.226 A:middle
So this is a new session
we're trying out this year,

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:52.606 A:middle
this is iTunes Connect
Development and Distribution.

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:55.756 A:middle
We already have the
wildly popular what's new

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:56.456 A:middle
on iTunes Connect.

00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
We just devoted an incredible
session to app analytics


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
We just devoted an incredible
session to app analytics

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.516 A:middle
and maybe some of the
fundamental features

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.966 A:middle
of iTunes Connect to make
sure that you are empowered

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:07.356 A:middle
to make best use out of them.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:08.486 A:middle
That's what this is.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.526 A:middle
From the conversations
that I had in the labs,

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.086 A:middle
I think we picked
the right topics.

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:15.786 A:middle
Let's jump into them.

00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:18.386 A:middle
We will talk about
the help and resources

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:19.376 A:middle
that are available for you guys.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:21.826 A:middle
I want to talk about
the vast resources

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:24.646 A:middle
that are available very
quickly but then we will jump

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:26.636 A:middle
into a demo of TestFlight.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.796 A:middle
Then we will briefly go
over some of the materials

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:32.706 A:middle
that you need to launch
your app on the App Store

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:38.366 A:middle
which will lead us into a deep
dive of transporter and XML

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:39.856 A:middle
and how you manage them.

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:42.476 A:middle
Sound good?

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:44.456 A:middle
Sounds good, all right!

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.666 A:middle
It's an interactive
presentation.

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:48.396 A:middle
Stay with me here.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:48.716 A:middle
All right.

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:50.226 A:middle
Let's jump in.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.416 A:middle
This screen should be
available to everyone,

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:53.306 A:middle
this is iTunes Connect,

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:56.646 A:middle
and here's all the
beautiful modules on this.

00:01:57.226 --> 00:01:59.176 A:middle
This is my favorite module.

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:00.056 A:middle
My favorite module.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:00.056 A:middle
My favorite module.

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.206 A:middle
This is My Apps.

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.176 A:middle
This is where you spend a
lot of your time, the bread

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:05.776 A:middle
and butter of iTunes Connect.

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.186 A:middle
This is where you
manage your apps

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.416 A:middle
and manage your TestFlight
campaigns, manage versions

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.646 A:middle
and manage your pricing
and availability.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:13.916 A:middle
My Apps, if this was
a physical button,

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.386 A:middle
I feel like mine would
have the paint worn off,

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:20.386 A:middle
because I'm always in there.

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:21.606 A:middle
This is our baby.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:23.316 A:middle
Our baby's name is
App Analytics.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:25.616 A:middle
It launched this year.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.146 A:middle
It's really empowering you guys.

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:30.656 A:middle
It's giving you data, I think
that only we can provide

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.176 A:middle
because of the integration, and
it's really giving you a picture

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:37.666 A:middle
of how your app exists in your
customer's hands and we do

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:38.376 A:middle
that all the while

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:40.196 A:middle
by maintaining your
customer's privacy.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:41.976 A:middle
So we love App Analytics.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.246 A:middle
I hope you caught
the session earlier.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.806 A:middle
It's amazing and as you can see,

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:47.066 A:middle
we took the beta
badge off of it.

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:51.116 A:middle
One more module I would like to
talk about, this is my protip

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:52.546 A:middle
of the day and it's
not that big of a tip.

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:55.336 A:middle
I already had a couple of
questions about it in the labs.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:58.386 A:middle
And it's the agreements,
tax, and banking section

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.836 A:middle
and so this section -- my protip
is make sure you are caring


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.836 A:middle
and so this section -- my protip
is make sure you are caring

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:04.046 A:middle
and feeding for your
iTunes Connect by going

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.716 A:middle
into the agreements,
tax, and banking section

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:07.686 A:middle
and accepting your agreements.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:10.436 A:middle
I think one went live on
Monday, the unified agreement.

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.886 A:middle
We had a couple of
questions in the lab.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.926 A:middle
My protip is make sure you keep
your account up to date and go

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:17.156 A:middle
into your Agreements
and Tax and Banking.

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:18.606 A:middle
It's a stellar tip.

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:22.276 A:middle
Don't tell anyone.

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
This is Help and Resources,
resources and help.

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:26.966 A:middle
This is all new.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:27.976 A:middle
We are revamping it.

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:31.296 A:middle
We put as much design as the UI
designers let us put in there,

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.266 A:middle
I don't know if you
caught the session earlier,

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:35.596 A:middle
but we are putting it
outside the log-in screen.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:39.226 A:middle
It's fully searchable
and it will be great.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:42.646 A:middle
Help and resources.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:45.976 A:middle
Like I said,

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:48.966 A:middle
it's outside the log-in and
it contains the best piece

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:52.896 A:middle
of information you will ever own
and that is the developer guide.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.586 A:middle
This has everything
you need in it!

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.406 A:middle
This tells you how to
launch apps and how

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
to get your assets ready and how
to interact with iTunes Connect.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
to get your assets ready and how
to interact with iTunes Connect.

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:02.186 A:middle
Print it out, put it
under your pillow,

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.196 A:middle
sleep with it, do
whatever you want.

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:07.036 A:middle
The developer's guide is the
be-all and end-all document

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:09.196 A:middle
and I hope you are reading
it and referencing it.

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:10.736 A:middle
It has a lot more stuff.

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:12.776 A:middle
It's 2015!

00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:14.056 A:middle
We have multimedia now.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.216 A:middle
We have some videos in there.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:18.146 A:middle
We have some deep dive videos.

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:21.116 A:middle
A lot of you guys
have questions.

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:22.036 A:middle
We read through the questions

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:24.506 A:middle
and so we are making videos
constantly trying to to keep you

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:27.556 A:middle
up to date, we have Agreements,
Tax, and Banking, TestFlight,

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.546 A:middle
App Previews, App
Transfer, there as a video.

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:32.746 A:middle
A lot of videos.

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:33.916 A:middle
Check out these resources.

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:34.936 A:middle
They are meant to help you.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:36.856 A:middle
Of course we have
the developer guide

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:38.546 A:middle
but we have specialized
user guides,

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:41.096 A:middle
one of which we will talk
about later in the session,

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:42.896 A:middle
as the transporter user guides.

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.366 A:middle
Deeper topics a lot of
specialized materials

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:48.476 A:middle
and then last but definitely
not least, the FAQs.

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
We have this incredible
operations team that's

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:53.586 A:middle
constantly going through
all the support requests,

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.766 A:middle
all the developer posts,
anything, and everything,

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:59.496 A:middle
trying to come up with
relevant FAQs for you guys.

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
It's likely that if
you have a question,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
It's likely that if
you have a question,

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:02.766 A:middle
it's answerable in the FAQs.

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:04.836 A:middle
So that's resources and help.

00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:06.456 A:middle
I'm just going to move on here.

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:09.806 A:middle
New also this year we have
iTunes Connect specific

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:10.676 A:middle
developer forums.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:11.786 A:middle
I hope you are using them.

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:14.296 A:middle
We have an incredible community
of developers out there,

00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:16.976 A:middle
which is you guys and
thousands of others

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:20.346 A:middle
and if you have a question,
there's probably a place --

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:23.046 A:middle
somebody else probably
had the same question.

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:25.166 A:middle
It's self-help, questions
and answers.

00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:26.986 A:middle
It's a forum post,
that's moderated

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.926 A:middle
and it's a fantastic
resource for you guys.

00:05:29.006 --> 00:05:31.506 A:middle
We would love to hear
your feedback on it.

00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:33.066 A:middle
We think it's doing
really great.

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:37.186 A:middle
It's questions and answers
and support and it's not

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:38.696 A:middle
for proprietary information
there.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.766 A:middle
Don't pass any passwords to your
accounts and things in there.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:43.926 A:middle
I will put up the
URL right here.

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:47.606 A:middle
Quickly moving on to another
support resource that's

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:50.456 A:middle
available, yes, AppleCare,
our friends at AppleCare.

00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:54.406 A:middle
We have iTunes Connect technical
support, via AppleCare.

00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:56.036 A:middle
If you go into help and
resources right now,

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.366 A:middle
it's up in the top left
corner, it's called contact us,

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:00.916 A:middle
and you can reach it via
the developer forums.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:00.916 A:middle
and you can reach it via
the developer forums.

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:06.986 A:middle
Then we can filter it down by,
I think 19 different categories.

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:09.126 A:middle
We can get your issue
to the right specialist.

00:06:09.426 --> 00:06:12.216 A:middle
Sometimes you have a problem
with your account and you want

00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:14.176 A:middle
to ask somebody a question.

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:15.166 A:middle
Go for it.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.386 A:middle
Ask us. It's there for you.

00:06:17.046 --> 00:06:18.836 A:middle
I have a little bit
of a surprise,

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.576 A:middle
although I think it's
already out this in the wild,

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.486 A:middle
but we have an 800-number now.

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:23.746 A:middle
You can call us.

00:06:23.746 --> 00:06:26.376 A:middle
If you have questions that you
really need to somebody about,

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:29.616 A:middle
the account, you can call
us on an 8-hundred number.

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:31.846 A:middle
It rings to phone in my pocket.

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:32.256 A:middle
No, I'm kidding.

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:35.356 A:middle
Oh, it -- somebody is actually
calling -- there you go.

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
I will put that number
up right now.

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:41.416 A:middle
You guys can write it down
or take a picture of it.

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.876 A:middle
That's the iTunes
Connect technical support.

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:45.256 A:middle
Nobody hummed.

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:48.916 A:middle
Too bad. 1-800-633-2152.

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:54.546 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:55.976 A:middle
I had a bet with people
that I wouldn't sing.

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:57.026 A:middle
There you go.

00:06:57.026 --> 00:07:01.236 A:middle
All right.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.026 --> 00:07:01.236 A:middle
All right.

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:03.006 A:middle
I know you want to see
TestFlight and XML.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.296 A:middle
Here we go.

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:08.386 A:middle
There's a couple
of other resources,

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
developer technical support.

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.306 A:middle
Sometimes you read
the documentation,

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:15.516 A:middle
and you have asked the
questions in the dev forums

00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
and maybe you have
interacted with AppleCare

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.076 A:middle
but maybe it's more of a
deeper engineering question.

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:21.676 A:middle
Developer technical support
is always available to you.

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:25.126 A:middle
Go and check it out and
also I really encourage you

00:07:25.126 --> 00:07:26.706 A:middle
to join our bug filing
community.

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.296 A:middle
We really appreciate the
bugs that you guys file.

00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:31.716 A:middle
We read them and
prioritize them and fix them.

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
It's a great relationship
that we have with you

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:34.796 A:middle
and I really appreciate it.

00:07:34.796 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
So join the community.

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
Lastly, I just want to reinforce
that there's some great articles

00:07:41.316 --> 00:07:44.546 A:middle
on the developer -- excuse
me, the developer section.

00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:46.186 A:middle
Developer portal.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.306 A:middle
This one, we talked about in
the new and iTunes Connect,

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:50.426 A:middle
but I will put it up here again.

00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:54.396 A:middle
The app review is giving you the
most common rejection reasons

00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:55.636 A:middle
for your app not making it

00:07:55.636 --> 00:07:58.526 A:middle
through the first pass
through app review.

00:07:58.526 --> 00:07:59.676 A:middle
They keep it up to date.

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:00.396 A:middle
It's fantastic.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:00.396 A:middle
It's fantastic.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.486 A:middle
There are a couple of others.

00:08:02.386 --> 00:08:06.636 A:middle
There's a marketing video that's
available as well or excuse me,

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:08.446 A:middle
a marketing article,
that's available as well.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.776 A:middle
It shows you how to make your
product page look its best.

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:11.606 A:middle
Check it out.

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:12.696 A:middle
These are great articles.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.596 A:middle
There's another one
on app previews.

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:16.086 A:middle
All right.

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:18.776 A:middle
So that's the help
and resources section.

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:20.266 A:middle
I wanted to reinforce
those things and make sure

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.026 A:middle
that you were empowered.

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:24.576 A:middle
So, what do you do when you have
an app that's about ready to go?

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.436 A:middle
You test it.

00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:26.586 A:middle
And what do you test it with?

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:27.576 A:middle
You test it with TestFlight.

00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:30.826 A:middle
I would like to bring up my
good friend, Alex Miyamura

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:33.586 A:middle
to give you a demo
of TestFlight.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.885 A:middle
[Applause]

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:38.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ALEX MIYAMURA: Thank
you so much, Paul.

00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:40.486 A:middle
I'm Alex Miyamura.

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:43.166 A:middle
I'm an engineer with the
TestFlight team I'm here

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.736 A:middle
to show you how easy it is

00:08:44.736 --> 00:08:47.036 A:middle
to distribute your
app via TestFlight.

00:08:47.576 --> 00:08:51.676 A:middle
Now, we will begin with a
screen that is very familiar to,

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.536 A:middle
I'm pretty sure everyone
in this room right now,

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:55.486 A:middle
and this is Xcode.

00:08:55.816 --> 00:08:58.886 A:middle
I have an app that I
created open, Touch Fighter

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:02.086 A:middle
and I'm going to upload
it up to iTunes Connect.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:02.086 A:middle
and I'm going to upload
it up to iTunes Connect.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:07.386 A:middle
Now, in order to do that, I will
go up to product, and archive.

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:10.956 A:middle
And one of the great things
about TestFlight is that instead

00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:12.976 A:middle
of having to upload
one beta build

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:15.676 A:middle
and then also an App Store
build, if you find a beta build

00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:19.306 A:middle
that works for you and
you want to distribute

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:26.056 A:middle
that to the App Store, you
don't have to do that again.

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:31.166 A:middle
I can go ahead and click this
big button, submit to App Store.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:33.536 A:middle
Usually you would go
through the prompt

00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:35.806 A:middle
and would you deliver your
build to the App Store

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:38.356 A:middle
but in the interest of time,
I'm actually going to switch

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:42.186 A:middle
over to iTunes Connect, where I
have a build that's already been

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:48.636 A:middle
-- a build that's already been
uploaded to iTunes Connect.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:50.316 A:middle
And here we go.

00:09:50.736 --> 00:09:52.486 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:55.856 A:middle
[Applause]

00:09:56.356 --> 00:09:58.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ALEX MIYAMURA: And so now
you will see the My Apps module

00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:01.376 A:middle
that Paul spoke about,
and we'll click in there


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:01.376 A:middle
that Paul spoke about,
and we'll click in there

00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:03.866 A:middle
and see TouchFighter
is right in there.

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:05.406 A:middle
We will click in there.

00:10:05.956 --> 00:10:07.556 A:middle
And you will see
the prerelease tab.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:10.496 A:middle
Now, of course, we are
TestFlighting these apps.

00:10:10.596 --> 00:10:12.406 A:middle
So we do care about prerelease

00:10:12.406 --> 00:10:14.256 A:middle
and we will go straight
into there.

00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:19.576 A:middle
And you will see we have
build two of version 1.0

00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:23.776 A:middle
and we actually get a lot of
questions from developers as to

00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.946 A:middle
where that comes from, right?

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:28.136 A:middle
And I will actually
show you right now.

00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:30.516 A:middle
So we will go back to Xcode.

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:36.136 A:middle
And we are in the
info.plist file for my app.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.156 A:middle
I will zoom in so everyone
can see and as you can see,

00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:43.276 A:middle
the bundle version
short string is 1.0.

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
That matches 1.0 that we
saw in iTunes Connect.

00:10:46.656 --> 00:10:48.656 A:middle
And the bundle version is 2,

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.916 A:middle
which matches the build
number build number 2.

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:55.706 A:middle
And test flight has
two types of testing.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:58.866 A:middle
We have internal testing
and external testing.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
And first, we'll go
over internal testing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
And first, we'll go
over internal testing.

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:04.256 A:middle
Internal testing is used
to distribute your app

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.686 A:middle
to a small select
group of testers,

00:11:07.406 --> 00:11:09.656 A:middle
within your iTunes
Connect organization.

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:13.896 A:middle
These testers must be either an
admin role or a technical role

00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:15.676 A:middle
and you get 25 of them.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:19.586 A:middle
Each build that you distribute
is currently available

00:11:19.586 --> 00:11:22.306 A:middle
for 30 days, but
coming this fall,

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:23.616 A:middle
we're actually going
to double that.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:25.726 A:middle
It will be available
for 60 days.

00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:29.116 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:29.616 --> 00:11:31.736 A:middle
And so we will go
ahead and click

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:33.496 A:middle
into the internal testers tab.

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:36.386 A:middle
And you will see that
I'm here, Alex Miyamura,

00:11:36.776 --> 00:11:38.216 A:middle
and I want to invite one

00:11:38.216 --> 00:11:41.466 A:middle
of my colleagues Johnny
Appleseed to be a tester.

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:43.316 A:middle
Oh, here's Johnny Appleseed.

00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:50.646 A:middle
He's a technical user and so
we can invite him as a tester.

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:56.956 A:middle
And we will go to
TestFlight beta testers

00:11:57.396 --> 00:12:00.576 A:middle
and select his Apple
ID and hit save.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.396 --> 00:12:00.576 A:middle
and select his Apple
ID and hit save.

00:12:01.056 --> 00:12:04.976 A:middle
When we have done that, that
actually adds my colleague,

00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:07.986 A:middle
Johnny Appleseed as a
tester and if we go back

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:09.296 A:middle
to the internal testers tab,

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:12.576 A:middle
you can see that Johnny
Appleseed is now a tester

00:12:12.576 --> 00:12:12.996 A:middle
for this app.

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:20.636 A:middle
Now for them to install
the app on their iOS device

00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:24.196 A:middle
on the TestFlight app, they
will check all the testers

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:25.036 A:middle
that they want to invite.

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:27.866 A:middle
Go to save.

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:32.916 A:middle
And then go back to
builds and you will see

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:36.736 A:middle
that we have a switch for
TestFlight beta testing.

00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:39.406 A:middle
We will go ahead and
toggle that switch

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:43.466 A:middle
and that will send those invite
emails to all the testers

00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:44.156 A:middle
that you have selected.

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:47.526 A:middle
As you can see, the build
is active for 30 days now.

00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:57.476 A:middle
And so once you -- once
you switched that switch,

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:01.166 A:middle
you will see that I as a
tester have received an email


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:01.166 A:middle
you will see that I as a
tester have received an email

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:06.926 A:middle
from the iTunes Store, and I'm
invited to test TouchFighter

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:14.606 A:middle
and I can go ahead and open that
in TestFlight, and tap install.

00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:17.776 A:middle
Now we will see that
the app installs.

00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:19.646 A:middle
It's ready to open.

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:20.956 A:middle
You go back to your home screen

00:13:20.956 --> 00:13:23.366 A:middle
and then you will see
TouchFighter right there next

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:26.176 A:middle
to the TestFlight app
and that orange dot next

00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:28.806 A:middle
to TouchFighter indicates
it's a TestFlight app,

00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:31.006 A:middle
that it's a beta app.

00:13:31.296 --> 00:13:34.746 A:middle
And so once your testers
are able to test your app,

00:13:34.926 --> 00:13:36.546 A:middle
they will give you feedback

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:37.976 A:middle
and you will be able
to iterate on that.

00:13:38.406 --> 00:13:41.646 A:middle
You will want to distribute your
app to a wider range of testers

00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:45.946 A:middle
and for that, we have
external testers.

00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:49.236 A:middle
And so we'll go into the
external testers' tab

00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.496 A:middle
and the first thing that
you will see is, wow!

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:57.046 A:middle
You have 1,000 of these as
compared to 25 internal testers.

00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:59.976 A:middle
That's 40 times and
coming this fall,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:01.136 A:middle
again, we will double that.

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.256 A:middle
Instead of 1,000,
you will be able

00:14:03.256 --> 00:14:05.326 A:middle
to have 2,000 external testers.

00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:09.826 A:middle
[Applause]

00:14:10.326 --> 00:14:14.386 A:middle
So in order to add testers to be
external testers for your build,

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:18.326 A:middle
you will click on the plus,
and you will add new testers.

00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:20.996 A:middle
You can obviously
type in the email.

00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:28.706 A:middle
But this can get really tedious

00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:31.476 A:middle
if you have 1,000
names to type in there.

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:32.986 A:middle
You will be there for
a long, long time.

00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:36.816 A:middle
So that's why we have added
this option to import a file.

00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:41.206 A:middle
Now, we provide you with the
CSV template if you click

00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:45.016 A:middle
on the question mark next
to import file, but in order

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:48.086 A:middle
to actually import
those testers,

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:49.876 A:middle
you will click open import file,

00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:53.346 A:middle
and it will actually
populate all the tester names

00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:58.306 A:middle
and you will be able
to add the testers.

00:14:59.556 --> 00:15:03.076 A:middle
The one difference, other than
the large amount of testers

00:14:59.556 --> 00:15:03.076 A:middle
The one difference, other than
the large amount of testers

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:05.016 A:middle
that you get as external
testing,

00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:07.826 A:middle
versus internal testing is
that for external testing,

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:10.426 A:middle
do you have to submit your
app for beta app review.

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.996 A:middle
We will go ahead and do that.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.556 A:middle
You have to fill in
some information.

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:17.646 A:middle
Obviously, you need to tell
your testers what to test.

00:15:17.646 --> 00:15:20.276 A:middle
They need to see what
features you really want

00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:22.346 A:middle
to have them focus on.

00:15:22.346 --> 00:15:23.646 A:middle
You might be adding
something new

00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:28.706 A:middle
and you really want them
to drill down in it.

00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:31.866 A:middle
Feedback email is very important
because the whole point

00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:33.426 A:middle
of testing is to be
able to get feedback

00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:35.426 A:middle
and to be able to
improve your app.

00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:37.286 A:middle
So we do require that.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:42.756 A:middle
Privacy policy is something
that you add as well

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:44.356 A:middle
and then your app description.

00:15:44.356 --> 00:15:51.086 A:middle
"This is the best app ever."

00:15:51.276 --> 00:15:54.136 A:middle
And we also require some
contact information,

00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:57.906 A:middle
so that if there is a problem
with your app, we will be able

00:15:57.906 --> 00:15:59.546 A:middle
to reach out to you, and so

00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:02.006 A:middle
that that can be get
resolved as soon as possible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:02.006 A:middle
that that can be get
resolved as soon as possible.

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:04.006 A:middle
And once you fill

00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:06.416 A:middle
that information in,
you can click next.

00:16:07.046 --> 00:16:08.926 A:middle
And export compliance.

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:15.056 A:middle
We have some export
labs here at WWDC.

00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:16.866 A:middle
This is a fairly simple app

00:16:17.146 --> 00:16:19.716 A:middle
and so we will go
ahead and click no.

00:16:20.456 --> 00:16:21.246 A:middle
We will submit.

00:16:22.746 --> 00:16:27.036 A:middle
And now you will see
that external testing

00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:28.776 A:middle
for build 2 is waiting
for review.

00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:30.386 A:middle
Obviously you can
remove it from review

00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:33.366 A:middle
and once your app
passes beta app review,

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.386 A:middle
iTunes Connect will
send you an email

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:40.456 A:middle
and then you can send invites
to all of your external testers.

00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:42.376 A:middle
And now back to Paul.

00:16:43.516 --> 00:16:47.366 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:47.866 --> 00:16:49.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; PAUL TURNER: Alex
what was it,

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:52.586 A:middle
the best feature is
the one you don't have?

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:52.653 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ALEX MIYAMURA:

00:16:52.653 --> 00:16:56.356 A:middle
No provisioning profiles
and no UUIDs.

00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:58.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; PAUL TURNER: I will
make T-shirts that say that

00:16:58.966 --> 00:17:03.096 A:middle
and we're going to wear them
around town and everyone's going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.966 --> 00:17:03.096 A:middle
and we're going to wear them
around town and everyone's going

00:17:03.096 --> 00:17:06.636 A:middle
to think we are the
weirdest people ever.

00:17:06.636 --> 00:17:11.205 A:middle
Before I bring up Mr. Nik Uglov
to do a deep dive into XML,

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:14.566 A:middle
I just want to remind everybody
of all the materials needed

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:15.796 A:middle
to launch an app
on the App Store.

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:21.536 A:middle
We come to the end and we are
about to release and we go, oh,

00:17:21.536 --> 00:17:22.586 A:middle
my gosh, I have to get all

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:25.996 A:middle
of those screen shots
localized or the privacy URL.

00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:27.986 A:middle
So let's take a look at
the store real quick.

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
App icons.

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:33.566 A:middle
One for the app, one
for the watch app,

00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:37.506 A:middle
hopefully you guys are
doing an app preview.

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:40.066 A:middle
We also have five
screen shots per device.

00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:42.116 A:middle
Just refreshing this
in your head right now.

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:44.556 A:middle
Of course, now we take
Apple Watch screen shots.

00:17:45.326 --> 00:17:49.196 A:middle
Starting counting how
many screen shots.

00:17:49.196 --> 00:17:51.826 A:middle
Five per device and
28 localizations.

00:17:52.486 --> 00:17:53.796 A:middle
We have app descriptions.

00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:56.146 A:middle
We want to draw people
into your app

00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:57.156 A:middle
and make sure they
understand how

00:17:57.156 --> 00:17:58.216 A:middle
to use it before they buy it.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:02.716 A:middle
If it has a new version,
it's what's new text.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:02.716 A:middle
If it has a new version,
it's what's new text.

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:06.076 A:middle
And privacy policies and
especially if it's a kid's app

00:18:06.076 --> 00:18:08.306 A:middle
and EULAs and all
of these things

00:18:08.306 --> 00:18:10.336 A:middle
that you need to get together.

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
I think that's 840
screen shots possible.

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:14.366 A:middle
We did the math there.

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:15.156 A:middle
You know, fancy!

00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:18.786 A:middle
And we make it really easy on
iTunes Connect to get them in.

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:20.826 A:middle
We have the drag and drop
wells that we reintroduced

00:18:20.946 --> 00:18:24.066 A:middle
and separated the sections and
made it a really powerful tool.

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:26.586 A:middle
But maybe you have
more than one app.

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:29.446 A:middle
Maybe you are updating your
screen shots frequently.

00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:33.186 A:middle
Maybe you have lots of apps and
lots of designers making all

00:18:33.186 --> 00:18:34.196 A:middle
of these screen shots for you.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.616 A:middle
Make you have a CMS system.

00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:38.956 A:middle
Maybe you have a corporate CMS
system, wouldn't it be nice

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:42.676 A:middle
to hook up iTunes Connect to
your system and manage this

00:18:42.676 --> 00:18:44.026 A:middle
in an automated fashion.

00:18:44.026 --> 00:18:47.756 A:middle
And that's what we have to talk
about right now, Transporter

00:18:48.206 --> 00:18:49.306 A:middle
and command line automation.

00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:51.346 A:middle
Let's bring up my good
friend, Mr. Nik Uglov.

00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
[Applause]

00:18:57.396 --> 00:18:59.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; NIK UGLOV: Hi, everybody
my name is Nik Uglov,

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:02.996 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager with
iTunes Store for content import.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:02.996 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager with
iTunes Store for content import.

00:19:03.946 --> 00:19:08.206 A:middle
And as Paul just showed you
and kind of gave you a hint

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:12.086 A:middle
that there's quite a lot
of data for you to enter

00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:14.016 A:middle
into iTunes Connect in
order for your app to appeal

00:19:14.016 --> 00:19:15.986 A:middle
to the widest possible audience.

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:19.356 A:middle
The store's localized
in 28 languages.

00:19:19.466 --> 00:19:22.456 A:middle
So that's how many languages
you can localize the metadata

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:23.406 A:middle
about your app for.

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:26.666 A:middle
And it certainly
makes sense to reach

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.876 A:middle
out to your potential
customers in the language

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.776 A:middle
that they can understand.

00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:36.186 A:middle
There's up to five screen
shots to set up for each

00:19:36.186 --> 00:19:38.446 A:middle
of the devices that
your app runs on,

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:40.166 A:middle
and those are localizable.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.636 A:middle
There rates and pricing
to set up.

00:19:45.056 --> 00:19:46.086 A:middle
In-app purchases.

00:19:46.546 --> 00:19:48.006 A:middle
Some of you have a few of those.

00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:51.466 A:middle
Some have hundreds, and
some have had thousands.

00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:51.986 A:middle
We have seen that.

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:55.216 A:middle
And those are localizable.

00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.726 A:middle
And those have screen
shots in their own right.

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
Game Center achievements


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
Game Center achievements

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:03.946 A:middle
and leaderboards also have
images and localization.

00:20:03.946 --> 00:20:05.676 A:middle
Are you counting?

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:10.206 A:middle
That's quite a lot
of work there.

00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:12.186 A:middle
And for those of you who have
multiple apps on the store.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:15.236 A:middle
First of all, congratulations
and thank you.

00:20:16.156 --> 00:20:17.706 A:middle
But also that means that there's

00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:19.146 A:middle
that much more work
to do, right?

00:20:20.246 --> 00:20:21.966 A:middle
And really at that scale,

00:20:21.966 --> 00:20:24.806 A:middle
no matter how good a UI we will
put together in iTunes Connect,

00:20:25.496 --> 00:20:27.456 A:middle
it's still going to get
tedious and error-prone

00:20:27.456 --> 00:20:28.786 A:middle
to copy and paste that data.

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:33.246 A:middle
No matter what we do,
it will not scale.

00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:38.016 A:middle
So let's take a look at
doing it some other way.

00:20:38.016 --> 00:20:40.986 A:middle
I will produce a command
line tool called Transporter

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:44.476 A:middle
that manages inactions
between your environment

00:20:44.566 --> 00:20:48.496 A:middle
and iTunes Connect using
an app metadata XML feed.

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:51.506 A:middle
The feed covers the
areas I just named,

00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:55.826 A:middle
the version level localization,
the rates and pricing,

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:59.566 A:middle
and in-app purchases and
Game Center achievements


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:02.266 A:middle
and leaderboards.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:05.676 A:middle
It's not new functionality
we are introducing.

00:21:06.376 --> 00:21:09.576 A:middle
We want to make sure that you
are aware of it and using it

00:21:09.576 --> 00:21:11.066 A:middle
and for those of you who
are new to the program --

00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:12.706 A:middle
new developers, by
the way, welcome --

00:21:13.986 --> 00:21:16.796 A:middle
we want to make sure that
you know that you have it

00:21:16.796 --> 00:21:19.276 A:middle
in your hands and ready
to take advantage of it.

00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:23.296 A:middle
This is a fully supported
robust functionality used

00:21:23.296 --> 00:21:24.846 A:middle
by developers like
you every day.

00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:26.786 A:middle
It's great for automation.

00:21:27.466 --> 00:21:30.546 A:middle
You are able to manage
your data in bulk.

00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:34.296 A:middle
And more intriguingly
integrate iTunes Connect

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.306 A:middle
with your back-end systems
whatever those may be.

00:21:36.846 --> 00:21:43.596 A:middle
What I mean by that is suppose
we have already an asset

00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:46.006 A:middle
management system where the
screen shots are collected,

00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:49.896 A:middle
or maybe your contracting out
with some company that allows

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:51.206 A:middle
to you localize that metadata

00:21:51.206 --> 00:21:53.356 A:middle
because you don't have
the speakers of all

00:21:53.356 --> 00:21:54.536 A:middle
of those languages in house.

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.436 A:middle
So you take it back and you
need to park it somewhere.

00:21:57.436 --> 00:22:00.916 A:middle
You are holding it somewhere and
you have some sort of process


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.436 --> 00:22:00.916 A:middle
You are holding it somewhere and
you have some sort of process

00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:02.416 A:middle
that works for your company.

00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:05.166 A:middle
At that point, if you
have a system like this

00:22:05.606 --> 00:22:09.516 A:middle
or you are thinking of setting
it up, it becomes just a matter

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:13.096 A:middle
of an XML export into a format
that we are about to see,

00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:19.446 A:middle
hook it up with Transporter and
put together a little harness

00:22:19.476 --> 00:22:21.776 A:middle
to capture any validation
messages we might send back

00:22:22.056 --> 00:22:23.106 A:middle
and you are on the
way to automate.

00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:26.836 A:middle
So a few basic rules.

00:22:27.986 --> 00:22:31.136 A:middle
The app itself, and the
version that you are trying

00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:33.296 A:middle
to target must already
exist in iTunes Connect.

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:36.636 A:middle
You set those up first
and you are ready to go.

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.646 A:middle
All of these state transitions
are done in iTunes Connect,

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:41.036 A:middle
like submitting your
app for review

00:22:41.036 --> 00:22:44.936 A:middle
or submitting in-app
purchases for review.

00:22:44.936 --> 00:22:48.226 A:middle
The app binaries are
uploaded the same way they are

00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:50.916 A:middle
through today, through
Xcode or application loader.

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:52.606 A:middle
No change.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:55.536 A:middle
And the feed itself is available

00:22:55.536 --> 00:22:57.606 A:middle
for iOS apps and
Mac apps equally.

00:23:01.516 --> 00:23:02.726 A:middle
So how does this work?

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:06.016 A:middle
First of all, it's a
two-way communication.

00:23:06.366 --> 00:23:08.216 A:middle
You use Transporter,
the command line tool,

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:11.876 A:middle
and the first thing I suggest
you do is do a metadata lookup.

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:16.996 A:middle
What this does is it retrieves
onto your local environment,

00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:20.576 A:middle
the current state
of the app metadata

00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:22.046 A:middle
as we have it in iTunes Connect.

00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:24.866 A:middle
So you download it in
a form of a package

00:23:24.866 --> 00:23:26.886 A:middle
which is just a fancy
word for a directory named

00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:29.086 A:middle
after your app SKU with
a .itmsp extension.

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:31.126 A:middle
You crack one of those open

00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:33.636 A:middle
and you find a metadata
XML file in there.

00:23:33.956 --> 00:23:36.996 A:middle
This is the expression of
all the metadata we have

00:23:36.996 --> 00:23:41.226 A:middle
for your app so far and this
is the file that you would use

00:23:41.226 --> 00:23:43.416 A:middle
to make changes to
iTunes Connect.

00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:47.096 A:middle
You edit that file and you
add some screen shots to it,

00:23:47.096 --> 00:23:48.546 A:middle
any other assets
that you need to add.

00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:52.256 A:middle
You validate it, to make sure
that it passes all the rules

00:23:52.456 --> 00:23:54.256 A:middle
and if its, go ahead and upload.

00:23:54.846 --> 00:23:58.066 A:middle
So this forms a life
cycle of your interactions

00:23:58.096 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
with iTunes Connect
using Transporter.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.096 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
with iTunes Connect
using Transporter.

00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:06.736 A:middle
Download the package, edit XML
and add assets to it, validate,

00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:09.956 A:middle
and upload and repeat
over time as necessary

00:24:09.956 --> 00:24:11.736 A:middle
to achieve the edits
you are trying to get.

00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:15.876 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the commands.

00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:18.166 A:middle
This is for the metadata lookup.

00:24:18.166 --> 00:24:19.506 A:middle
This is to get the
information from us.

00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:25.626 A:middle
The command is iTMSTransporter
and the first method

00:24:25.626 --> 00:24:28.906 A:middle
or mode you want to explore
is the look up metadata.

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:33.596 A:middle
Use your iTunes Connect user
name and you identify the app

00:24:33.756 --> 00:24:35.886 A:middle
that you are interested
in by the vendor ID.

00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.246 A:middle
The vendor ID is your app's SKU.

00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:41.996 A:middle
Not the bundle ID, not the
Apple ID, that's the app SKU.

00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:47.866 A:middle
Give where you would like
this to be deposited in.

00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:52.536 A:middle
You will get the
metadata XML data inside

00:24:53.746 --> 00:24:58.206 A:middle
and the reason I recommend
that you start this way is

00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
that it's a lot easier
to start by example.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
that it's a lot easier
to start by example.

00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:03.496 A:middle
You are going to get a large
file captures all the details

00:25:04.456 --> 00:25:06.796 A:middle
and it's valid by definition

00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:08.736 A:middle
because it's actually
emitted from the store.

00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:12.156 A:middle
So you will see all the areas
where you can make edits to it

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:14.196 A:middle
and it's a lot easier to put
it together than to start

00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:17.786 A:middle
from scratch from a spec. So
let's say you took that advice

00:25:17.906 --> 00:25:20.996 A:middle
and you added keywords and
added some screen shots

00:25:20.996 --> 00:25:23.156 A:middle
and a localization.

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:26.096 A:middle
Go ahead and validate it.

00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:31.276 A:middle
Same command, Transporter,
different mode, verify.

00:25:32.326 --> 00:25:36.536 A:middle
You use your iTunes Connect
user name, and supply a path

00:25:36.956 --> 00:25:38.516 A:middle
to the package that you
have been working on.

00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:40.176 A:middle
That's the one that
has the metadata XML

00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:41.346 A:middle
and all the assets
that you have added.

00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:44.806 A:middle
So what is going to
happen here is we are going

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:47.916 A:middle
to use exactly the same
rules that we apply

00:25:48.196 --> 00:25:49.956 A:middle
on iTunes Connect the web GUI,

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:52.076 A:middle
to validate what
you have September.

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:52.886 A:middle
We will check all the I.Ds.

00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:54.766 A:middle
We will check all the
required fields and the lengths

00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:58.486 A:middle
of the field and the
dimensions of the screen shots

00:25:58.486 --> 00:25:59.656 A:middle
that you are sending
to make sure

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:01.446 A:middle
that they match the
devices that they are for.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:01.446 A:middle
that they match the
devices that they are for.

00:26:02.806 --> 00:26:04.296 A:middle
If there are any errors,
we will report it back

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:05.416 A:middle
to you right on the
command line.

00:26:06.706 --> 00:26:07.956 A:middle
And if you don't
have any errors,

00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:09.786 A:middle
then go ahead and upload it.

00:26:10.226 --> 00:26:12.946 A:middle
This is the same command,
transporter, iTMSTransporter

00:26:13.836 --> 00:26:16.146 A:middle
with a different mode, upload.

00:26:16.146 --> 00:26:16.956 A:middle
That's the only difference.

00:26:18.386 --> 00:26:22.856 A:middle
Your iTunes Connect user name
and the path to the package

00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:24.766 A:middle
that you have been
putting together all along.

00:26:25.456 --> 00:26:27.866 A:middle
So what's going to happen here
is we are going to actually run

00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:30.226 A:middle
through the validation mode
first, in case you skipped it,

00:26:30.226 --> 00:26:31.256 A:middle
we will apply it anyways.

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:34.366 A:middle
Same rules as would
apply in iTunes Connect.

00:26:35.276 --> 00:26:38.196 A:middle
If there are any errors, they
will be reported back to you

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:39.696 A:middle
and the upload will be blocked.

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:44.076 A:middle
If there are no errors then
the app upload will succeed

00:26:44.256 --> 00:26:47.226 A:middle
and we will get it
on our servers and at

00:26:47.226 --> 00:26:49.276 A:middle
that point it's asynchronous.

00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.696 A:middle
So it's in the queue
to be processed,

00:26:51.696 --> 00:26:57.616 A:middle
alongside the binaries and
any other content we process.

00:26:58.136 --> 00:27:02.286 A:middle
And it might take a
minute or two for it to be,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.136 --> 00:27:02.286 A:middle
And it might take a
minute or two for it to be,

00:27:02.286 --> 00:27:04.426 A:middle
as we say ingested and
appear on iTunes Connect.

00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:07.876 A:middle
You can actually use one of the
commands in Transporter to look

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:12.406 A:middle
up the current state
of that process.

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:14.066 A:middle
In order to take
advantage of all of this,

00:27:14.066 --> 00:27:16.226 A:middle
there are two pieces of
documentation that you need.

00:27:16.286 --> 00:27:18.546 A:middle
They are available
on the resources

00:27:18.546 --> 00:27:20.046 A:middle
and the help screen
on iTunes Connect.

00:27:20.756 --> 00:27:23.016 A:middle
The app metadata
specification for all the tags

00:27:23.846 --> 00:27:26.206 A:middle
and a Transporter user
guide for all the commands

00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:28.646 A:middle
and all the options
which is a lot more

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:29.676 A:middle
than I will go through here.

00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:30.286 A:middle
All right.

00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:34.306 A:middle
We are ready to see that XML.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:36.026 A:middle
So this is what it
would look like.

00:27:36.026 --> 00:27:37.806 A:middle
This is how metadata
XML would look like.

00:27:38.236 --> 00:27:42.516 A:middle
There are required elements
forming a sort of envelope

00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:43.426 A:middle
around everything else.

00:27:43.846 --> 00:27:48.126 A:middle
So you have the package,
for your team ID.

00:27:49.196 --> 00:27:51.846 A:middle
You have software because this
is what we are discussing here,

00:27:51.846 --> 00:27:52.076 A:middle
right?

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:56.326 A:middle
Your app is identified by the
vendor ID which is the app SKU

00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:58.836 A:middle
and then the software metadata

00:27:58.836 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
because this is what
you are about to send.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.836 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
because this is what
you are about to send.

00:28:01.726 --> 00:28:04.916 A:middle
Everything else is
optional elements.

00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:08.906 A:middle
They are optional in the
sense that only those

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:09.926 A:middle
that have some changes,

00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:12.246 A:middle
only those that you
actually need to send in.

00:28:12.556 --> 00:28:13.916 A:middle
So, for example, if you
are making some changes

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.386 A:middle
to the purchases, just
send that section.

00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:19.826 A:middle
This is not to say that you
can't send the whole thing

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:20.276 A:middle
back in.

00:28:20.646 --> 00:28:21.676 A:middle
It is going to work fine.

00:28:21.736 --> 00:28:23.866 A:middle
Let's say you followed
that advice I had

00:28:24.326 --> 00:28:25.996 A:middle
about doing a metadata
lookup first.

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:30.476 A:middle
You got the package and made
a few minor edits and decided

00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:33.016 A:middle
to send the whole thing
back in, perfectly fine.

00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:33.596 A:middle
That will work.

00:28:34.156 --> 00:28:36.276 A:middle
We are capable of seeing
where the changes are

00:28:36.276 --> 00:28:38.636 A:middle
and applying those and ignoring
the sections that didn't change.

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:40.946 A:middle
It's all up to you
how to structure it.

00:28:42.406 --> 00:28:47.306 A:middle
So diving in, into this
-- into the package here,

00:28:47.646 --> 00:28:49.706 A:middle
just to call your
attention to the team ID,

00:28:49.706 --> 00:28:51.676 A:middle
is a value that you
received originally

00:28:51.676 --> 00:28:53.366 A:middle
when you created your
team account with Apple

00:28:54.116 --> 00:28:56.596 A:middle
and your app is identified
by the vendor ID

00:28:56.596 --> 00:28:57.816 A:middle
which is the app's SKU.

00:28:58.376 --> 00:29:03.966 A:middle
And the next step
depends on what it is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.376 --> 00:29:03.966 A:middle
And the next step
depends on what it is

00:29:04.216 --> 00:29:05.616 A:middle
that you are trying to do.

00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:07.096 A:middle
Which area are you editing?

00:29:07.286 --> 00:29:09.366 A:middle
Let's say you are editing
some localization --

00:29:09.366 --> 00:29:11.286 A:middle
something about localization,
adding a description

00:29:11.286 --> 00:29:11.946 A:middle
or something like that.

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:16.536 A:middle
Just like in iTunes Connect,
you get to select one of up

00:29:16.586 --> 00:29:19.676 A:middle
to two versions that you
are trying to target.

00:29:19.846 --> 00:29:22.536 A:middle
The one that's currently
on the store

00:29:22.746 --> 00:29:23.896 A:middle
and maybe the one
you are building

00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:24.886 A:middle
up for the next release.

00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:27.126 A:middle
So in the XML, would you do

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:31.066 A:middle
that by using the iTunes Connect
version stream, version 1.5

00:29:31.796 --> 00:29:34.016 A:middle
or the 2.0 in this example.

00:29:34.686 --> 00:29:38.136 A:middle
And for the sake of argument,
let's say you are interested

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:39.516 A:middle
in editing the 2.0 version.

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:42.406 A:middle
So the next slide is we
are diving down into that,

00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:44.146 A:middle
and what's the next step?

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:46.516 A:middle
Select a language you
are talking about.

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:49.896 A:middle
So let's say in the -- in
iTunes Connect, would you do

00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:52.206 A:middle
that by using a pull
down for English.

00:29:52.766 --> 00:29:55.176 A:middle
In the XML, it would be locale,

00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:59.766 A:middle
name and the BCP47 tag
identifying the language.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:03.406 A:middle
BCP47 is a format --

00:30:03.406 --> 00:30:05.586 A:middle
is a standard for
identifying any language spoken

00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:08.596 A:middle
on this planet, and I
think a few off the planet.

00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.686 A:middle
But they are only ones
that you can only use

00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:14.236 A:middle
in the feed are the ones that
the store is localized in.

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:16.306 A:middle
So those are 28 and
they are listed

00:30:16.306 --> 00:30:19.446 A:middle
in the spec. Please take a look.

00:30:19.896 --> 00:30:25.786 A:middle
Let's say ENUS for US English
and diving further down.

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:28.426 A:middle
Now we are finally down to
the actual data elements.

00:30:28.926 --> 00:30:32.236 A:middle
We have the title which is the
app name and the description.

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.296 A:middle
We have the version
of what's new

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:35.346 A:middle
if it happens to be an update.

00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:39.196 A:middle
And really, any element that
you encounter in iTunes Connect

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:43.356 A:middle
at this point has a
representative tag in the XML.

00:30:43.356 --> 00:30:46.066 A:middle
I won't go through all of
them, other than to stay

00:30:46.066 --> 00:30:48.136 A:middle
for a few seconds
on screen shots

00:30:48.136 --> 00:30:49.916 A:middle
because those are just
a bit more involved.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.836 A:middle
For each screen shot,
you would need

00:30:53.836 --> 00:30:56.456 A:middle
to tell us what device
they are for.

00:30:56.576 --> 00:30:59.616 A:middle
So that's the dismay target
and all of the iPhones

00:30:59.616 --> 00:31:02.346 A:middle
and Apple Watch and
iPad and if it happens


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.616 --> 00:31:02.346 A:middle
and Apple Watch and
iPad and if it happens

00:31:02.346 --> 00:31:04.506 A:middle
to be a Mac app is
the option there

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.906 A:middle
and which position you want
that screen shot to appear

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:10.136 A:middle
on the store and they go
from one to five, remember,

00:31:10.136 --> 00:31:11.356 A:middle
up to five per device.

00:31:12.456 --> 00:31:15.266 A:middle
Specify the size of
the file in bytes.

00:31:16.106 --> 00:31:19.166 A:middle
The file name, which is of the
file that you would park next

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:20.936 A:middle
to metadata XML in the package,

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:25.416 A:middle
give us the MD5 checksum,
and onwards.

00:31:26.026 --> 00:31:30.666 A:middle
Let's say what you
wanted to do is set

00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:32.206 A:middle
up some pricing parameters
instead.

00:31:33.566 --> 00:31:35.636 A:middle
Like in iTunes Connect, and
I think you might be picking

00:31:35.636 --> 00:31:38.516 A:middle
up a theme here, that it's --
it's -- they are equivalent.

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:40.966 A:middle
Most of these are
applicable worldwide.

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:45.296 A:middle
So the XML product
equivalent section is

00:31:45.426 --> 00:31:47.476 A:middle
in the product for territory WW.

00:31:48.636 --> 00:31:51.896 A:middle
And at that level, you get to
state what your available date

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:54.516 A:middle
for the app is, the sales
start date and things

00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:58.956 A:middle
like the educational
discount and also still

00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:03.016 A:middle
on the same level, also
territory WW for worldwide,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:03.016 A:middle
on the same level, also
territory WW for worldwide,

00:32:03.716 --> 00:32:05.446 A:middle
what is the pricing
tier for your app?

00:32:06.326 --> 00:32:09.046 A:middle
So here's wholesale price
Tier 3, corresponding

00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:13.206 A:middle
to the same option in the GUI
and the effective dates of it,

00:32:13.406 --> 00:32:15.686 A:middle
the start date and the end date.

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:20.696 A:middle
Notice for a second that those
appear inside an interval tag,

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:23.876 A:middle
which is itself an interval
section and what that builds

00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:27.616 A:middle
up to is the ability to do
this advanced scheduling

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:28.606 A:middle
of your price changes.

00:32:29.106 --> 00:32:32.256 A:middle
So in iTunes Connect, for
example, here's a map that goes

00:32:32.256 --> 00:32:33.936 A:middle
on sale today for
five days, right?

00:32:34.656 --> 00:32:38.156 A:middle
Price Tier 3 goes down to price
Tier 1 and then comes back to 3,

00:32:38.876 --> 00:32:40.346 A:middle
exactly the same
way in the feed.

00:32:41.006 --> 00:32:46.786 A:middle
You have the initial interval,
and the wholesale Price Tier 3

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:53.646 A:middle
and then it goes down to Tier 1
for five days and back up to 3.

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:57.016 A:middle
Notice no end date there, which
means it's effective forever,

00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.836 A:middle
until you decide to change
that with a next update.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.836 A:middle
until you decide to change
that with a next update.

00:33:02.326 --> 00:33:05.916 A:middle
What is available on
the per territory basis,

00:33:05.986 --> 00:33:07.006 A:middle
per country basis?

00:33:07.006 --> 00:33:10.016 A:middle
It's just the setting of whether
your app is available there

00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:10.336 A:middle
or not.

00:33:10.836 --> 00:33:12.606 A:middle
You can do that by
exclusion or inclusion.

00:33:12.986 --> 00:33:15.016 A:middle
In exclusion, you state
that it's available

00:33:15.296 --> 00:33:17.726 A:middle
for sale everywhere,
and then enumerate

00:33:17.836 --> 00:33:20.376 A:middle
through territories specifically
like Japan over there,

00:33:20.676 --> 00:33:22.846 A:middle
where you don't want the app
to be available for sale.

00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:25.226 A:middle
So that's one option.

00:33:25.226 --> 00:33:27.316 A:middle
The other one is inclusion,
exactly the opposite.

00:33:27.686 --> 00:33:30.876 A:middle
For territory WW, your app
is not available for sale,

00:33:30.876 --> 00:33:33.966 A:middle
meaning it's just not
clear for sale anywhere.

00:33:33.966 --> 00:33:36.436 A:middle
And spend specifically
enumerate the areas

00:33:36.706 --> 00:33:40.286 A:middle
where you want to
make it available.

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:42.996 A:middle
In-app purchases.

00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:45.866 A:middle
This is the area where you can
probably get the most effect,

00:33:45.866 --> 00:33:47.646 A:middle
the most bang for the
buck for using the feed.

00:33:47.646 --> 00:33:50.986 A:middle
That's due to the sheer
number of in-app purchases

00:33:50.986 --> 00:33:51.956 A:middle
that some of your apps have.

00:33:52.896 --> 00:33:55.116 A:middle
This is where we have
seen the most activity

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:59.166 A:middle
and this is a deep
enough section of the feed

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.006 A:middle
that I won't go through
the tags here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.006 A:middle
that I won't go through
the tags here.

00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:03.636 A:middle
Please download the
documentation,

00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:04.326 A:middle
take a look there.

00:34:04.326 --> 00:34:07.786 A:middle
It's fully supported, what you
can do in the web interface,

00:34:07.786 --> 00:34:09.406 A:middle
you can do in the feed.

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:12.626 A:middle
The same goes for
leaderboards and achievements.

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.076 A:middle
Fully supported.

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:18.966 A:middle
Everything you can do in a
web GUI, you can do in a feed.

00:34:19.295 --> 00:34:20.536 A:middle
Please download the
documentation,

00:34:20.536 --> 00:34:25.676 A:middle
study it, and take advantage.

00:34:25.766 --> 00:34:30.856 A:middle
So in summary, what you have
able to you is Transporter,

00:34:30.946 --> 00:34:34.166 A:middle
the command line tool for
managing the interactions

00:34:34.206 --> 00:34:35.795 A:middle
in your environment
and iTunes Connect

00:34:36.696 --> 00:34:40.485 A:middle
and app metadata XML feed for
all the areas that we covered.

00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:44.216 A:middle
And those are great
for automation.

00:34:44.576 --> 00:34:47.966 A:middle
They allow you to manage your
data in iTunes Connect in bulk.

00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:51.016 A:middle
You can get out of the
copy/paste business.

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:54.536 A:middle
And you can integrate
iTunes Connect

00:34:54.686 --> 00:34:55.755 A:middle
with your back-end systems.

00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:56.585 A:middle
Whatever those may be.

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.326 A:middle
So get your hands on two
pieces of information,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.326 A:middle
So get your hands on two
pieces of information,

00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:05.306 A:middle
app metadata XML
feed for all the tags

00:35:05.306 --> 00:35:09.786 A:middle
and all the formats there
and Transporter user guide

00:35:10.656 --> 00:35:12.636 A:middle
for all the commands and
all the options to them.

00:35:13.356 --> 00:35:14.846 A:middle
And automate away!

00:35:15.806 --> 00:35:17.746 A:middle
And with that, back
to Paul and thank you.

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:23.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:35:24.046 --> 00:35:24.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; PAUL TURNER: Okay.

00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:24.626 A:middle
Thanks, Nik.

00:35:24.626 --> 00:35:25.396 A:middle
That was great.

00:35:26.076 --> 00:35:26.676 A:middle
Oh, my gosh!

00:35:26.926 --> 00:35:28.786 A:middle
I'm so lucky to work
with engineers like this.

00:35:28.786 --> 00:35:30.056 A:middle
All right, we are a
little pressed for time

00:35:30.056 --> 00:35:31.206 A:middle
and I will wrap it
up really quickly.

00:35:31.366 --> 00:35:32.616 A:middle
I want to let you know

00:35:32.616 --> 00:35:37.066 A:middle
that 1-800 song already
chartered on Apple Music.

00:35:37.066 --> 00:35:38.826 A:middle
You will see me at
the Grammys next year.

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:42.826 A:middle
We took a look at
help resources.

00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:43.706 A:middle
I hope you use them.

00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:44.656 A:middle
Give us feedback on them.

00:35:44.656 --> 00:35:46.206 A:middle
I want to know what you need.

00:35:46.806 --> 00:35:52.186 A:middle
We took a look at TestFlight,
went over the resources

00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:54.576 A:middle
and then Nik's Transporter
and XML feeds.

00:35:55.116 --> 00:35:57.846 A:middle
For more information,
obviously the developer portal.

00:35:57.846 --> 00:36:01.086 A:middle
And you can contact our fearless
evangelist, Marc Malone.

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:03.996 A:middle
Some related sessions
already happened

00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
but catch them on the replay.

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:08.286 A:middle
The What's New in iTunes Connect
this morning was fantastic!

00:36:08.506 --> 00:36:11.566 A:middle
The App Analytics
lab was incredible.

00:36:11.866 --> 00:36:13.366 A:middle
I'm so happy that
you guys are here.

00:36:13.496 --> 00:36:14.976 A:middle
So come visit us and
have a great conference!

00:36:15.516 --> 00:36:19.500 A:middle
[Applause]
