&gt;&gt; LUKE HIESTERMAN:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:38.716 A:middle
Thank you so much for coming
to Cocoa Touch best practices.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
I am Luke Hiesterman, an
engineer on the UIKit team,

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:44.736 A:middle
and it will be my
pleasure to walk you

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:48.946 A:middle
through today a collection of
pieces of wisdom, practical bits

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.086 A:middle
of advice that you can apply
directly to the applications

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:54.766 A:middle
that you are writing
today and into the future.

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:59.736 A:middle
So I am going to do this by
walking across a collection

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.686 A:middle
of topics that will
be of strong interest


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.686 A:middle
of topics that will
be of strong interest

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:07.086 A:middle
to any Cocoa Touch application,
and in each of these topics,

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:10.186 A:middle
I will have sort of a series
of best practice tips to give

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
to you, and those topics are
app life cycle, number one;

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:22.736 A:middle
views and view controllers;
Auto Layout; and finally,

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:24.556 A:middle
table and collection views.

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:27.406 A:middle
Now, as I go across
these topics,

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:31.066 A:middle
I am going to have a series
of goals that I want to impart

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.176 A:middle
to you with each of the bits
of wisdom that I am giving

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.946 A:middle
because everything is sort

00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:41.196 A:middle
of corralled towards
accomplishing a few basic ideas

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:43.326 A:middle
that you definitely want
to have in your app.

00:01:43.326 --> 00:01:45.216 A:middle
So you know, number one
is going to be you want

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:46.326 A:middle
to have peak performance.

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:48.486 A:middle
Your apps want to
be silky smooth,

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.646 A:middle
so you look like
rock star developers

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.496 A:middle
and everybody loves you.

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.716 A:middle
You also want to have a
top-notch user experience

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.226 A:middle
in your app.

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.246 A:middle
That way everybody thinks

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.176 A:middle
that your app looks
polished and it's awesome.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.176 A:middle
that your app looks
polished and it's awesome.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:05.436 A:middle
And finally, you want to
write your code in such a way

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.856 A:middle
that it's as future-proof
as possible so that

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.666 A:middle
as future versions of iOS
come out, you're writing

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.446 A:middle
as little code as possible to
adapt to those revisions of iOS.

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:16.886 A:middle
So those are the goals we
are going to have in mind

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:17.996 A:middle
as we go through these topics.

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:21.156 A:middle
And I will start off by
talking about app life cycle.

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:26.756 A:middle
The very first best practice
I want to impart upon you has

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:29.816 A:middle
to do with the very first
experience that the user has

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.706 A:middle
with your app, and
that's launching it.

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:35.766 A:middle
So the first best
practice is launch quickly.

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:40.086 A:middle
That's how you appear responsive
when the user taps on your icon

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.136 A:middle
and right away they get your
app ready to interact with.

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.676 A:middle
And the way that you launch
quickly is extremely simple.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.576 A:middle
It's return quickly from the
Application Did Finish Launching

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:51.286 A:middle
UI application delegate event.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:54.816 A:middle
That in itself is really simple.

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.336 A:middle
I am sure you all
already know how to do it.

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
Take all the long-running work
you might have to do to set


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
Take all the long-running work
you might have to do to set

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:02.436 A:middle
up an application
and defer that out

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:05.066 A:middle
of Application Did Finish
Launching because you want

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:07.566 A:middle
to return as fast as possible
doing the minimum amount

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:10.576 A:middle
of work, set up a
basic UI for your users

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:12.366 A:middle
to interact with, and return.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.516 A:middle
So if you are loading data,
whatever you need to do,

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:17.886 A:middle
from a database,
network, defer that out

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:19.356 A:middle
of Application Did
Finish Launching.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:24.106 A:middle
If you take too much time, of
course, your app will be killed

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:25.956 A:middle
because it just looks like
it's hung to the system,

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.926 A:middle
so you really want to return
as fast as possible from that.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:33.636 A:middle
Now, being a superresponsive
app doesn't end

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.016 A:middle
at application launch.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:36.326 A:middle
We want to think beyond that.

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:38.376 A:middle
We want to be superresponsive
all the time.

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:42.266 A:middle
So I want to delve deeper into
this technique of what it means

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:45.836 A:middle
to be responsive in general
so we can build a technique

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
that works not just
at app launch

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:50.476 A:middle
but throughout the
life cycle of your app.

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:53.006 A:middle
So even though I just talked
about deferring all of this work

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:54.726 A:middle
out of Application
Did Finish Launching,

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:56.376 A:middle
what we are really getting

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
at for a best practice
isn't just about asynchrony.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:03.016 A:middle
It's actually about taking
long-running work and putting

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:04.536 A:middle
that on background queues.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.026 A:middle
If you need to load
data from a database,

00:04:07.026 --> 00:04:08.026 A:middle
if you are hitting the network,

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.416 A:middle
that's work that can be
done in the background.

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:13.206 A:middle
So if we revisit Application
Did Finish Launching

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:16.315 A:middle
and we have this sort
of very simple approach

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:20.396 A:middle
to a naive Application Did
Finish Launching, you know,

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.686 A:middle
we see we load our data directly

00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:24.246 A:middle
in Application Did
Finish Launching,

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:25.756 A:middle
and I just said defer that.

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:27.826 A:middle
Okay. So we can do
that pretty easily.

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:31.546 A:middle
We dispatch that, and it's gone.

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.706 A:middle
It's out of Application
Did Finish Launching.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.586 A:middle
We are able to launch quickly,
and things are better at launch.

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:40.216 A:middle
But that still introduces
the possibility

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.896 A:middle
of blocking the main
queue later on and, thus,

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:45.386 A:middle
blocking user interaction.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.396 A:middle
So really, the best
practice is move that work

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:53.166 A:middle
onto a background queue so
that whenever it does run,

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:55.696 A:middle
user interaction
continues to happen,

00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:58.366 A:middle
and your application seems
responsive all the time.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.686 A:middle
So this technique, putting
the work on background queues,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.686 A:middle
So this technique, putting
the work on background queues,

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:06.766 A:middle
can be applied anytime in
your app, not just at launch.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
Then, you take that work that
you do in the background working

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:12.336 A:middle
with data, and when
you are done with it,

00:05:12.336 --> 00:05:14.526 A:middle
that's when you come back to
the main queue to interact

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:17.316 A:middle
with UIKit elements like
views and view launchers.

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.856 A:middle
So that's being really
responsive.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.666 A:middle
The next thing you
want to do besides

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.066 A:middle
that first launch is
be superresponsive

00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:29.076 A:middle
on the second time the
user launches your app,

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.596 A:middle
and the third time, and so on.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:32.936 A:middle
And this comes from the fact

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:36.986 A:middle
that when the user exits your
app, the app doesn't just die,

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:39.446 A:middle
it goes into a suspended
state on iOS.

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:43.506 A:middle
And so to be superfast the
second time the user goes

00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:45.846 A:middle
to your app, you really
just want to resume

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.056 A:middle
from that suspended state,

00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:50.666 A:middle
and that's contingent upon
you still being in memory.

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.076 A:middle
So if we take a look
at a picture

00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:55.366 A:middle
of what system memory
looks like, you know,

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:57.506 A:middle
we know that some of it
is taken up by the kernel

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.076 A:middle
and the operating
system processes.

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:02.686 A:middle
A good chunk is going to be
taken up by the foreground app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:02.686 A:middle
A good chunk is going to be
taken up by the foreground app.

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:05.836 A:middle
And then a bunch of it
is going to be taken

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:07.846 A:middle
up by background apps.

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:11.476 A:middle
Now, you'll notice that
there's one sort of hog

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.466 A:middle
of a background app in
this picture that's using

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:14.886 A:middle
up more memory than
everyone else.

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:18.596 A:middle
You don't want your
app to be that app,

00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:20.056 A:middle
and the reason you
don't want that is

00:06:20.056 --> 00:06:23.476 A:middle
because that app is the
first one that's going to die

00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:25.566 A:middle
when the foreground app
needs additional memory.

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:30.916 A:middle
So you want your app to be the
one that's using UI application

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:33.646 A:middle
delegate methods to know when
it's going into the background,

00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:36.406 A:middle
get rid of unneeded
memory resources,

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:39.106 A:middle
take its memory footprint and
get it as small as possible

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.396 A:middle
when it's going into
the background.

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:43.336 A:middle
This is even more
important in the world

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.136 A:middle
when we have split view

00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:47.456 A:middle
and there can be
multiple foreground apps.

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:50.796 A:middle
You know when a second
foreground app comes,

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:53.936 A:middle
that big hog of an app
isn't going to survive.

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:57.026 A:middle
So you don't want to be that.

00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:59.726 A:middle
So that's being superresponsive
and thinking

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:01.826 A:middle
about performance throughout
the life cycle of your app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:01.826 A:middle
about performance throughout
the life cycle of your app.

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:05.876 A:middle
The next best practices I want
to talk about with respect

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:07.766 A:middle
to general application
programming is

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:08.956 A:middle
leveraging frameworks.

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:13.446 A:middle
Now, this is maybe the most
basic best practice I can give

00:07:13.446 --> 00:07:15.166 A:middle
to you, but that's: do it!

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:17.186 A:middle
Leverage frameworks
that Apple provides.

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:21.026 A:middle
We spend our lives throughout
the year building great

00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:24.356 A:middle
frameworks for you to build
on top of, and doing so comes

00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:25.926 A:middle
with several basic advantages

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.016 A:middle
that I am sure you
are familiar with.

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:29.376 A:middle
It reduces your maintenance
burden.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:32.736 A:middle
You know? If you use UI
Navigation Controller,

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:34.636 A:middle
for example, then you don't have

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:37.376 A:middle
to maintain the Navigation
Controller across releases

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:40.066 A:middle
as you would if you built your
own Navigation Controller.

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.726 A:middle
And as we make improvements, you
get those improvements for free.

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:45.426 A:middle
For example, you know,

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:49.016 A:middle
Navigation Controller
gained a swipe gesture

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:51.286 A:middle
for going back a
couple of releases ago.

00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:54.846 A:middle
Everyone who built on top of it
got that improvement for free.

00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:57.636 A:middle
If you had your own, you would
have had to go implement it

00:07:57.636 --> 00:08:00.976 A:middle
or not have a feel that fit
with the rest of the system.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.636 --> 00:08:00.976 A:middle
or not have a feel that fit
with the rest of the system.

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:05.316 A:middle
So that's what you want because
you really want to be able

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:09.116 A:middle
to spend your time focusing on
what makes your app special.

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:10.196 A:middle
That's what we all want.

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:12.936 A:middle
We want you to write fantastic
apps and spend your time

00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:14.926 A:middle
on that rather than things

00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
that you could leave
to our framework.

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:19.296 A:middle
So that's what we want
to encourage you to do.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:22.206 A:middle
And of course, while
you are doing that,

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:24.416 A:middle
something that you're
going to have to keep

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:27.426 A:middle
in mind is how you
deal with versioning.

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:30.336 A:middle
So one of the biggest
questions we get is:

00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:33.775 A:middle
How many versions should
apps deploy against?

00:08:34.176 --> 00:08:36.186 A:middle
And our advice to
you is going to be,

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.966 A:middle
target the two most
major releases of iOS.

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:43.756 A:middle
So starting this fall when iOS
9 comes out and going forward,

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.946 A:middle
that's going to mean
iOS 8 and 9.

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:50.416 A:middle
This technique will give you the
best mix of getting a whole lot

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:53.286 A:middle
of users while not taking
on the maintenance burden

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:56.566 A:middle
of deploying back
several iOS releases

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:57.636 A:middle
and having to deal with that.

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:02.186 A:middle
Now, in this process,
you might find yourself


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:02.186 A:middle
Now, in this process,
you might find yourself

00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:06.606 A:middle
at times needing specific
logic to check the version

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:07.766 A:middle
of what system you're on.

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:11.566 A:middle
And another best practice for
that is going to be to make sure

00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:14.256 A:middle
that you include
fallbacks for your logic

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:16.096 A:middle
that is based on system version.

00:09:16.636 --> 00:09:19.746 A:middle
So that means definitely don't
write code that looks like this,

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:22.176 A:middle
where you check for
a specific version

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:24.566 A:middle
like iOS 9 before
doing something.

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:27.366 A:middle
If you make a check like this,
it is almost certainly going

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.436 A:middle
to cause a bug in your program
when iOS 9.1, for example,

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.486 A:middle
is released that causes
this check to fail.

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:38.016 A:middle
Instead, you want to think
about anything that's

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:43.176 A:middle
in iOS 9 is going to be in
future releases, so any logic

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:46.216 A:middle
that you put in iOS 9 you'd
want for versions greater

00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:47.836 A:middle
than or equal to iOS 9.

00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:51.576 A:middle
And even better, if you are
writing your app in Swift,

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:55.116 A:middle
you can take advantage of the
new pound availability syntax

00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:59.636 A:middle
to put all your version-specific
code into a block

00:09:59.636 --> 00:10:02.246 A:middle
that the compiler can
understand and reason about


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.636 --> 00:10:02.246 A:middle
that the compiler can
understand and reason about

00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:04.436 A:middle
and let you know if you
are doing anything wrong

00:10:04.706 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
for a particular version.

00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:09.316 A:middle
Whichever technique
that you end up using,

00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:12.226 A:middle
think through whether you
need to have an Else clause

00:10:12.576 --> 00:10:14.276 A:middle
because you don't want
to make the mistake

00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:19.216 A:middle
of putting some specific logic
in that handles a core piece

00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:23.656 A:middle
of your application for some
system version but fails

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:27.516 A:middle
to do other work that it needs
to do if it's not that version,

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:31.116 A:middle
and you get a bug on versions
that aren't what you expected.

00:10:31.726 --> 00:10:34.006 A:middle
So that's some basic
best practices

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.446 A:middle
for general application
life cycle.

00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:38.836 A:middle
Let's talk about view and view
controller best practices.

00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:42.856 A:middle
And the first idea I want
to hit there is how we think

00:10:42.856 --> 00:10:44.736 A:middle
about layout on modern devices.

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:48.806 A:middle
You all know that last
fall we introduced iPhone 6

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:53.016 A:middle
and iPhone 6 Plus, and I am
sure you are aware that along

00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:55.896 A:middle
with this we had
four new dimensions

00:10:56.176 --> 00:11:00.166 A:middle
that had never been
seen on iOS devices


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:56.176 --> 00:11:00.166 A:middle
that had never been
seen on iOS devices

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:01.326 A:middle
for your apps to lay out in.

00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:06.246 A:middle
When you add that to the
dimensions of various iPhones

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:09.926 A:middle
that we already had plus
iPad, now the matrix

00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:13.116 A:middle
for possible dimensions that
your app needs to lay out in,

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:16.396 A:middle
especially when you throw
in split view on iPad Air 2,

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.086 A:middle
that matrix is fairly large.

00:11:19.476 --> 00:11:22.006 A:middle
So it no longer makes
sense to build layouts

00:11:22.006 --> 00:11:25.926 A:middle
that are built specific
for a particular dimension

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:27.956 A:middle
that your view controller
expects to be in.

00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:32.956 A:middle
Instead, layout in general wants
to think of itself as being done

00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:35.036 A:middle
to proportions, and we do

00:11:35.036 --> 00:11:39.166 A:middle
that by specifically avoiding
hard-coded values in the layout

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.646 A:middle
of our views and
view controllers.

00:11:41.476 --> 00:11:45.836 A:middle
If we imagine a view that simply
puts a label into a superview,

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:49.376 A:middle
we might have a couple of
years ago thought of the layout

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:54.866 A:middle
of this as being done as a label
described as 260 points wide

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:57.856 A:middle
with a 30-point margin
from the left.

00:11:58.106 --> 00:12:00.836 A:middle
We don't want to do that
because we want to think


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.106 --> 00:12:00.836 A:middle
We don't want to do that
because we want to think

00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:02.916 A:middle
about the dimension scaling.

00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:04.396 A:middle
Either or both of
them might scale.

00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:07.786 A:middle
In this case, if the width
scales, this layout breaks,

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:12.016 A:middle
it just doesn't work because the
offset no longer makes sense.

00:12:12.016 --> 00:12:15.356 A:middle
So if we had instead thought
of this as a centered label,

00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:18.706 A:middle
then that makes sense
as the dimensions scale.

00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:20.866 A:middle
And we will revisit this
example a bit when I talk

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:22.986 A:middle
about Auto Layout
best practices.

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:28.296 A:middle
I want to talk a little bit
about an API that we introduced

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:30.736 A:middle
in iOS 8 to help you
with this idea of laying

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:34.706 A:middle
out to proportions because
part of the goal was to get rid

00:12:34.706 --> 00:12:36.896 A:middle
of the idea of orientation.

00:12:36.896 --> 00:12:40.816 A:middle
You know, we no longer want you
to ever think about orientation.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:43.306 A:middle
In fact, I am going
to tell you if,

00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:45.896 A:middle
when you are designing your
app, you have the thought

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:48.686 A:middle
in your head that thinks
about portrait or landscape

00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:50.476 A:middle
or you have that
conversation with your designer

00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:52.406 A:middle
where the word "portrait"
or "landscape" comes out,

00:12:53.096 --> 00:12:54.726 A:middle
you are already thinking
about it wrong.

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
We only think about
things in terms of size.

00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:02.986 A:middle
And so size classes are here
to help us think about things


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:02.986 A:middle
And so size classes are here
to help us think about things

00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:05.476 A:middle
in terms of size, do
proportional layout,

00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:08.356 A:middle
while also recognizing
and embracing

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.416 A:middle
that there are certain
size thresholds

00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:15.696 A:middle
where the fundamental
UI we have changes.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.796 A:middle
As an example, Settings

00:13:17.886 --> 00:13:21.026 A:middle
on iPhone 4S is a simple
one-column table view.

00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:25.236 A:middle
When we go to the iPhone
5, it's still a table view.

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.116 A:middle
It's just a little taller.

00:13:26.766 --> 00:13:29.346 A:middle
On iPhone 6, it's
taller and wider,

00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:30.806 A:middle
still basically a table view.

00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:33.246 A:middle
iPhone 6 Plus, bigger still.

00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:36.156 A:middle
However, when we
transition to iPad,

00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:39.506 A:middle
we cross a certain
width threshold

00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:45.866 A:middle
where now this view changes
fundamentally how it appears.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:48.746 A:middle
It's now two columns
of scrolling content.

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:51.086 A:middle
So we've crossed
some threshold there.

00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:55.226 A:middle
And in fact, you find that that
same threshold has been crossed

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:57.436 A:middle
when we view in iPhone 6,

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.416 A:middle
and I will use the dirty
word, landscape mode.

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:05.996 A:middle
And size classes are
the API that's there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:05.996 A:middle
And size classes are
the API that's there.

00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:08.756 A:middle
For Apple to communicate
to your app

00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:11.996 A:middle
where those fundamental
thresholds are crossed

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:16.446 A:middle
so that you can then react
to those thresholds and think

00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:19.776 A:middle
about having a fundamentally
changed UI according

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:20.616 A:middle
to those thresholds.

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:23.806 A:middle
And you get notified of
those thresholds changing

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:28.976 A:middle
as size classes are packaged
in UITraitCollection objects,

00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:31.046 A:middle
which your view controller
will have access to.

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:32.846 A:middle
So that's layout.

00:14:33.496 --> 00:14:35.886 A:middle
The next best practice I
want to impart upon you is

00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:37.756 A:middle
to use properties
in your classes

00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:40.706 A:middle
as an alternative
to tags on UIView.

00:14:41.156 --> 00:14:45.026 A:middle
So what I mean here is if
you are using View With Tag

00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:47.986 A:middle
or Set Tag UIView API
and shipping code,

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:50.676 A:middle
I am going to encourage
you to move away from that.

00:14:51.406 --> 00:14:53.126 A:middle
Reasons are this is just --

00:14:54.016 --> 00:14:55.266 A:middle
[Applause]

00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:55.536 A:middle
Thank you.

00:14:55.536 --> 00:15:01.516 A:middle
I am really, really glad that
somebody is happy about that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:55.536 --> 00:15:01.516 A:middle
I am really, really glad that
somebody is happy about that.

00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:04.586 A:middle
Yes. So I mean, the reasons
for this should be obvious.

00:15:04.586 --> 00:15:07.886 A:middle
It's just an integer, and it
has collisions potentially

00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:08.616 A:middle
with other code.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.106 A:middle
Maybe it's other
code that you write.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:12.586 A:middle
Maybe it's the new guy on
your team who doesn't know

00:15:12.586 --> 00:15:14.456 A:middle
about your carefully
managed integers.

00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:18.076 A:middle
Maybe it's a framework
that you use

00:15:18.076 --> 00:15:20.026 A:middle
that you have no
visibility into.

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.746 A:middle
And whenever these
collisions happen,

00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:24.826 A:middle
you get no compiler
warnings about them.

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.306 A:middle
The compiler has
no way to reason

00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:27.586 A:middle
about your integer management.

00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:31.966 A:middle
And when you not only do
not get a compiler warning,

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:35.356 A:middle
but any runtime errors you
get will not say anything

00:15:35.356 --> 00:15:36.766 A:middle
about your use of
View With Tags.

00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:40.156 A:middle
At best, you'll get a crash
for unrecognized selector.

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.906 A:middle
You won't know what happened.

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:45.786 A:middle
As a replacement to
this, declare properties

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
on your classes, and then you
will have real connections

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.886 A:middle
to those views that
you need later.

00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:58.206 A:middle
As a simple code example,
imagine that I wrote some code

00:15:58.206 --> 00:16:01.056 A:middle
that creates an image view, and
I keep track of it with a tag


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.206 --> 00:16:01.056 A:middle
that creates an image view, and
I keep track of it with a tag

00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:02.936 A:middle
of 1,000 because I'm sure

00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:07.096 A:middle
in all my cleverness nobody else
will ever use a tag of 1,000.

00:16:07.626 --> 00:16:11.646 A:middle
But then I watch my own
talk, and I say no, no,

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.506 A:middle
let me create an actual property

00:16:14.826 --> 00:16:16.536 A:middle
that declares it
a UI image view.

00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:19.166 A:middle
Then I keep a real
reference to that view

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:23.176 A:middle
that also has better type
information because View

00:16:23.176 --> 00:16:25.896 A:middle
With Tag only is a type UI view.

00:16:26.356 --> 00:16:29.106 A:middle
Now that I use a
property-typed UI image view,

00:16:29.316 --> 00:16:32.236 A:middle
the compiler can actually reason
about what I do and help me

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:33.406 A:middle
out if I make mistakes.

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.756 A:middle
So please heed that.

00:16:36.756 --> 00:16:39.346 A:middle
The last best practice for
view and view controllers is

00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:41.776 A:middle
about making timing
deterministic.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:47.006 A:middle
This is, for those of you who
may have been in the position

00:16:47.096 --> 00:16:51.876 A:middle
of doing something
alongside a system animation

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:55.636 A:middle
or you have some work
that you want to fire off

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:58.256 A:middle
when an animation is
complete, and so you are left

00:16:58.256 --> 00:17:01.116 A:middle
in the position of trying to
make a guess about how long


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.256 --> 00:17:01.116 A:middle
in the position of trying to
make a guess about how long

00:17:01.116 --> 00:17:02.516 A:middle
that animation is going to take

00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:04.685 A:middle
and perhaps implementing
an NSTimer

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:06.826 A:middle
to take care of that
time for you.

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.576 A:middle
Well, you don't want
to do that because

00:17:09.576 --> 00:17:12.046 A:middle
that introduces indeterminism
into your app,

00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:14.195 A:middle
especially with the possibility

00:17:14.195 --> 00:17:16.935 A:middle
that animation timings can
change from release to release.

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.876 A:middle
You are really the
opposite of future-proof

00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:21.766 A:middle
if that's what you are doing.

00:17:21.766 --> 00:17:25.185 A:middle
Instead, leverage
UIViewTransitionCoordinator,

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:30.346 A:middle
an API on UIViewController,
to know what the timings are

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:31.786 A:middle
for the animations
that you have.

00:17:32.316 --> 00:17:33.516 A:middle
This has the capability

00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:36.406 A:middle
to let you do any
animation you want alongside

00:17:36.636 --> 00:17:38.036 A:middle
of view controller transition.

00:17:39.286 --> 00:17:43.316 A:middle
You know for sure when that
transition is completed.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:47.936 A:middle
And it has built-in support
for cancelable animations

00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:49.716 A:middle
and interactive animations.

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:52.956 A:middle
So if you imagine that
navigation swipe gesture again,

00:17:53.366 --> 00:17:56.306 A:middle
the user may move his or
her hand back and forth,

00:17:56.386 --> 00:17:59.596 A:middle
changing the speed,
direction, and even decide not

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.836 A:middle
to pop the view controller
and cancel it altogether.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.836 A:middle
to pop the view controller
and cancel it altogether.

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:04.906 A:middle
If you use the Transition
Coordinator, you are prepared

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:07.106 A:middle
to handle all of that.

00:18:07.656 --> 00:18:09.606 A:middle
Let's talk about Auto
Layout best practices.

00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:13.406 A:middle
Auto Layout is a tool that I am
sure many of you know and love,

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:17.156 A:middle
and it's kind of
built there designed

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:22.136 A:middle
to help you be adaptable and
future-proof in your code.

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.836 A:middle
And of course, we are
going to talk about that.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:26.546 A:middle
Future-proofing is one of
the goals with Auto Layout.

00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:30.606 A:middle
But first I want to hit
on some best practices

00:18:30.606 --> 00:18:33.276 A:middle
for high performance
in your Auto Layout.

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:37.126 A:middle
And that's going to start
with managing your constraints

00:18:37.406 --> 00:18:38.916 A:middle
in the most efficient
way possible.

00:18:39.866 --> 00:18:44.316 A:middle
So the way that you do that is
imagining all the constraints

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:48.216 A:middle
that will be in your view and
identify those constraints

00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:50.866 A:middle
that might change throughout
the lifetime of the view.

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:56.366 A:middle
What that does when you identify
what changes is you'll be able

00:18:56.366 --> 00:19:01.626 A:middle
to make targeted changes
and not change the things


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:56.366 --> 00:19:01.626 A:middle
to make targeted changes
and not change the things

00:19:01.736 --> 00:19:02.946 A:middle
that don't need to change

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:06.276 A:middle
because when you keep
some things constant,

00:19:06.696 --> 00:19:09.766 A:middle
you allow the Auto Layout engine
to optimize for those things

00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:12.716 A:middle
that don't change and,
therefore, it doesn't have

00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:16.616 A:middle
to make certain calculations
over again, and your app lays

00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:18.726 A:middle
out faster, which is
especially important

00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:21.526 A:middle
if you are doing
re-layout during scrolling

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.346 A:middle
or something else
user interactive.

00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:27.466 A:middle
So part of that, a
definite best practice --

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.716 A:middle
while this is a worst practice
and the best practice is

00:19:29.776 --> 00:19:31.386 A:middle
to avoid the worst practice --

00:19:31.856 --> 00:19:34.616 A:middle
is removing all the
constraints from a view.

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:38.606 A:middle
This is bad not only in
terms of the performance

00:19:38.606 --> 00:19:40.626 A:middle
of your app enforcing
the Auto Layout engine

00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:42.526 A:middle
to do the most work possible,

00:19:43.066 --> 00:19:46.556 A:middle
but it's also actually a
potential compatibility issue

00:19:46.556 --> 00:19:51.126 A:middle
because future versions of iOS
may have additional constraints

00:19:51.126 --> 00:19:53.606 A:middle
that the framework has added,
which you'll be removing

00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:55.306 A:middle
when you call Remove
All Constraints.

00:19:55.806 --> 00:19:58.436 A:middle
So you want to avoid calling
Remove All Constraints

00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.206 A:middle
on a view as much as possible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.206 A:middle
on a view as much as possible.

00:20:01.436 --> 00:20:05.456 A:middle
So the way that you sort of
tie this together and are able

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:07.546 A:middle
to manage your constraints
efficiently is

00:20:07.546 --> 00:20:11.546 A:middle
by having explicit references
to them using the same strategy

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:14.586 A:middle
that we just talked about
by replacing view tags,

00:20:14.886 --> 00:20:18.656 A:middle
having actual properties
that point out the views

00:20:18.656 --> 00:20:20.506 A:middle
or the constraints
that you might need

00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:22.836 A:middle
to change throughout the
lifetime of the view.

00:20:23.586 --> 00:20:26.346 A:middle
So we can look at a
very simple example

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:30.006 A:middle
of how you might write your
update view constraints code,

00:20:30.336 --> 00:20:32.616 A:middle
and this does the most
naive thing possible,

00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:35.696 A:middle
and that is it says hey, I
need to update my constraints.

00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:37.466 A:middle
Let me just remove all of them,

00:20:37.726 --> 00:20:39.396 A:middle
and then I will recalculate
them and add them back.

00:20:40.846 --> 00:20:41.796 A:middle
We don't want to do this.

00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:43.246 A:middle
This is not the best practice.

00:20:43.596 --> 00:20:47.916 A:middle
The best practice is if we have
one constraint, for example,

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:51.346 A:middle
that needs to be changed, we
can remove that constraint,

00:20:52.526 --> 00:20:56.076 A:middle
rebuild just that
constraint, and add it back.

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:59.176 A:middle
The Auto Layout engine again
knows what didn't change

00:20:59.296 --> 00:21:02.136 A:middle
and is able to optimize
for us around that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.296 --> 00:21:02.136 A:middle
and is able to optimize
for us around that.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:07.456 A:middle
So the next set of best
practices I have for you

00:21:07.456 --> 00:21:09.786 A:middle
around constraints
are around this idea

00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:13.796 A:middle
of how specific you are when
you describe your constraints.

00:21:14.386 --> 00:21:16.766 A:middle
In general, you want
your constraints

00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:21.306 A:middle
to describe your layout exactly
as precisely as is necessary.

00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:23.956 A:middle
That is, you want to
say what is needed

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:27.206 A:middle
to get the layout you
desire, and you don't want

00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:29.026 A:middle
to say any more, and you
don't want to say any less.

00:21:30.036 --> 00:21:34.756 A:middle
And there are potential problems
that can happen on both sides

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:38.676 A:middle
of this specificity problem,
and I am going to talk

00:21:38.676 --> 00:21:39.716 A:middle
about each of these now.

00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:43.006 A:middle
The first one is a
performance problem.

00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:47.556 A:middle
So the first one is about
adding duplicate constraints

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.256 A:middle
to your views.

00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:52.586 A:middle
Duplicate constraints are those
ones that if you removed them,

00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:54.936 A:middle
the layout would
be exactly the same

00:21:55.126 --> 00:21:58.236 A:middle
because they're just implied
by what's already there.

00:21:58.946 --> 00:22:01.246 A:middle
And when you have that, it
causes the layout engine


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.946 --> 00:22:01.246 A:middle
And when you have that, it
causes the layout engine

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:03.396 A:middle
to do more work than it
needs to because it's solving

00:22:03.396 --> 00:22:04.916 A:middle
for these constraints
because they are there,

00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:07.016 A:middle
but it didn't actually
need to solve for them.

00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:11.696 A:middle
An example of this can be seen
in this sort of simple layout.

00:22:12.216 --> 00:22:14.456 A:middle
I've got a couple of
views inside a superview,

00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:21.246 A:middle
and I might describe the layout
first by doing the vertical axis

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:25.276 A:middle
and say, hey, there's
some margin between my top

00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:29.246 A:middle
and bottom view, and I give
it an alignment option to say

00:22:29.246 --> 00:22:31.926 A:middle
that the left edges of both of
those views are also aligned.

00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:35.326 A:middle
Then I say, okay, let me go
to the horizontal dimension.

00:22:35.686 --> 00:22:39.196 A:middle
I provide some spacing
for the top view,

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:41.906 A:middle
so now I know what
its left margin is.

00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:45.146 A:middle
Then I think, well, I've got
to specify that bottom view

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:48.106 A:middle
as well, so I specify a
margin for that bottom view.

00:22:48.786 --> 00:22:52.076 A:middle
But what I've just done
is provided a margin

00:22:52.076 --> 00:22:55.656 A:middle
that I really didn't need in
that bottom view left margin.

00:22:56.186 --> 00:22:58.856 A:middle
Since I already knew what
the top view's margin was

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:02.496 A:middle
and I also knew that the
left edges of the bottom


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:02.496 A:middle
and I also knew that the
left edges of the bottom

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.876 A:middle
and the top view were going
to align to each other,

00:23:05.476 --> 00:23:09.436 A:middle
this view hierarchy would
have laid out exactly the same

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:14.086 A:middle
if I hadn't specified the left
margin of the bottom view.

00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:17.136 A:middle
So that extra constraint just
causes the engine to do work

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:18.326 A:middle
that it doesn't need to do.

00:23:19.326 --> 00:23:21.556 A:middle
Get rid of that,
we'll be faster.

00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:24.856 A:middle
The next problem that
can happen as a result

00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:27.306 A:middle
of overspecifying your
constraints actually isn't a

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:30.796 A:middle
performance problem, but
it's an adaptability problem.

00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:32.906 A:middle
It's a future problem
for your app.

00:23:32.906 --> 00:23:35.746 A:middle
And that's when your constraints
simply aren't flexible enough.

00:23:36.296 --> 00:23:40.366 A:middle
So if we think about hard-coded
values, we know we hate them,

00:23:40.996 --> 00:23:42.466 A:middle
and let's go back
to this example

00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:46.396 A:middle
that I promised we'd come back
to about a label in a view.

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:51.446 A:middle
Again, if we think about this in
terms of it's a 30-point margin

00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:53.376 A:middle
from the left and
it's 260 points wide,

00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:55.906 A:middle
we might describe
its constraints

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.156 A:middle
in terms of those hard values.

00:23:58.706 --> 00:24:02.276 A:middle
But those hard values cause
us to be rigid and unchanging,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.706 --> 00:24:02.276 A:middle
But those hard values cause
us to be rigid and unchanging,

00:24:02.476 --> 00:24:05.606 A:middle
which kind of defeats the
entire purpose of Auto Layout

00:24:05.606 --> 00:24:07.216 A:middle
as a future-proofing tool.

00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:11.866 A:middle
What we really want to do is
describe our constraints using

00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:13.696 A:middle
the bounds of the
views that they're in.

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:17.916 A:middle
So this should have been
something that used the bounds

00:24:17.916 --> 00:24:21.806 A:middle
of the superview and
described minimum margins

00:24:21.806 --> 00:24:22.606 A:middle
around that view.

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:27.966 A:middle
So let's talk about the other
side of constraint specificity,

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:30.726 A:middle
which is underspecifying
your constraints.

00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:31.536 A:middle
You don't want to
do that either.

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.906 A:middle
You want to make sure you've
specified everything you need.

00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:38.096 A:middle
If you think about this view
here and imagine what happens

00:24:38.096 --> 00:24:41.586 A:middle
if we underspecified, we'd
be introducing ambiguity.

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:45.836 A:middle
So focus in on constraints
I might have specified here.

00:24:46.126 --> 00:24:49.906 A:middle
If I set left and right
margins around this label

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:54.206 A:middle
and I set a top margin as well,
there's something missing,

00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:55.966 A:middle
and it should be
pretty obvious to you

00:24:56.216 --> 00:24:58.616 A:middle
that there's no bottom
margin, and there needs to be.

00:24:59.046 --> 00:25:03.046 A:middle
And there needs to be because if
it's ambiguous, it's undefined,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.046 --> 00:25:03.046 A:middle
And there needs to be because if
it's ambiguous, it's undefined,

00:25:03.116 --> 00:25:06.236 A:middle
and that means my
view might come

00:25:06.236 --> 00:25:09.336 A:middle
out different ways
different times I run my app.

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:11.136 A:middle
Maybe if this is a table cell,

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:13.316 A:middle
it changes when I
call Reload Data,

00:25:13.316 --> 00:25:14.716 A:middle
and I am mystified by that.

00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:17.436 A:middle
Maybe it will change on the
next version of iOS because,

00:25:17.636 --> 00:25:21.566 A:middle
you know, the cosmic rays
hit the phone differently.

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:22.556 A:middle
Who knows.

00:25:23.176 --> 00:25:25.496 A:middle
We don't want undefined
behavior.

00:25:25.816 --> 00:25:28.096 A:middle
We don't want our view to
come out looking like this.

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:31.816 A:middle
We want it to be the height
that we want it to be.

00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:34.726 A:middle
So make sure you fully
specify your constraints.

00:25:35.436 --> 00:25:38.146 A:middle
I want to give you a best
practice in terms of testing

00:25:38.146 --> 00:25:39.686 A:middle
and debugging your
Auto Layout code.

00:25:40.816 --> 00:25:44.956 A:middle
You can use a method on UIView
called Has Ambiguous Layout.

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:47.036 A:middle
If you are in a debugger,
you are trying to figure

00:25:47.036 --> 00:25:50.166 A:middle
out why your view isn't
laying out the way

00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:53.306 A:middle
that you expect it to,
call Has Ambiguous Layout.

00:25:53.306 --> 00:25:56.586 A:middle
It will let you know if
there's ambiguity in your view.

00:25:57.726 --> 00:26:02.186 A:middle
Moreover, you call this method
on a UIWindow, it will tell you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.726 --> 00:26:02.186 A:middle
Moreover, you call this method
on a UIWindow, it will tell you

00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:05.956 A:middle
if any view in the window
tree has ambiguous layout.

00:26:06.486 --> 00:26:07.516 A:middle
So that's pretty handy.

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:13.536 A:middle
You can call UIView Auto Layout
Trace, then, to get a picture

00:26:13.536 --> 00:26:16.416 A:middle
of all the constraints
throughout your entire view tree

00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:19.866 A:middle
and use those constraints
to go find ambiguity.

00:26:20.466 --> 00:26:24.186 A:middle
A really interesting
best practice is

00:26:24.186 --> 00:26:28.446 A:middle
to take these methods as they
are, put them into a unit test.

00:26:29.836 --> 00:26:34.986 A:middle
You can imagine for each view
tree, each basic UI in your app,

00:26:34.986 --> 00:26:40.526 A:middle
you could call UIWindow
Has Ambiguous Layout,

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.616 A:middle
and if it does have
ambiguous layout,

00:26:44.076 --> 00:26:48.376 A:middle
then you could call UIView
Auto Layout Trace to find

00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:51.586 A:middle
where the ambiguous
constraints are.

00:26:52.036 --> 00:26:55.666 A:middle
Just package that up into a
report, and then you have a test

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:58.716 A:middle
which both lets you know
when there's ambiguity

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:01.076 A:middle
and provides debugging
information


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:01.076 A:middle
and provides debugging
information

00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.756 A:middle
for whoever comes along and sees

00:27:02.756 --> 00:27:04.436 A:middle
that there is a failure
in the test.

00:27:05.146 --> 00:27:07.866 A:middle
So that's a great best
practice you can use

00:27:07.866 --> 00:27:08.816 A:middle
with your Auto Layout apps.

00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:15.736 A:middle
[Applause]

00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:16.656 A:middle
All right.

00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:21.436 A:middle
So I will transition now to our
last topic for best practices,

00:27:21.786 --> 00:27:23.506 A:middle
and that's table and
collection views.

00:27:24.026 --> 00:27:26.516 A:middle
I know that this is
something that is important

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:29.426 A:middle
to almost every iOS
app out there,

00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:31.846 A:middle
and it's certainly
important to me, too.

00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:36.116 A:middle
So the first best practice
is use self-sizing cells

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:39.856 A:middle
when you have content
that needs to change --

00:27:39.896 --> 00:27:41.296 A:middle
or you have cells that need

00:27:41.296 --> 00:27:42.726 A:middle
to change size based
on the content.

00:27:43.876 --> 00:27:47.806 A:middle
I am sure most all of
you have at some point

00:27:47.806 --> 00:27:50.796 A:middle
in your iOS development
life been in this situation

00:27:51.126 --> 00:27:54.966 A:middle
where you have a basic table
view with some content in there,

00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:58.026 A:middle
and you realize,
oh, each cell needs

00:27:58.026 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
to be a different height based
on the content that's in it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.026 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
to be a different height based
on the content that's in it.

00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:02.936 A:middle
I can't just have one
height for every cell.

00:28:04.076 --> 00:28:07.576 A:middle
And self-sizing cells introduced
in iOS 8 make it easier

00:28:07.576 --> 00:28:10.286 A:middle
than ever to transition
to what you really want,

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:13.156 A:middle
which is a table view where all
the cells are the height they

00:28:13.156 --> 00:28:15.756 A:middle
need for the content.

00:28:15.756 --> 00:28:18.136 A:middle
So I'll run through the
best practice mechanism

00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:21.806 A:middle
for how you get self-sizing
cells in your app.

00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:23.856 A:middle
And it starts just
like we talked

00:28:23.856 --> 00:28:25.436 A:middle
about in the Auto Layout section

00:28:25.776 --> 00:28:27.746 A:middle
by fully specifying
your constraints.

00:28:28.816 --> 00:28:31.946 A:middle
You want to use all those
tips that I just talked about,

00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:38.136 A:middle
thinking about this idea of
your Auto Layout system is this

00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:41.536 A:middle
machine that's taking
width in as an input

00:28:42.206 --> 00:28:44.736 A:middle
because the table view
has a fixed width,

00:28:44.926 --> 00:28:46.586 A:middle
and so your cell is
going to be that wide.

00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:50.806 A:middle
And then it's producing as an
output the height of the cell.

00:28:51.516 --> 00:28:54.216 A:middle
So any ambiguity in there,

00:28:54.216 --> 00:28:56.336 A:middle
if you haven't fully
specified your constraints,

00:28:56.336 --> 00:29:00.766 A:middle
comes out as the height
isn't what you want it to be.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:56.336 --> 00:29:00.766 A:middle
comes out as the height
isn't what you want it to be.

00:29:01.016 --> 00:29:03.856 A:middle
If we use the simple
example of a table view cell,

00:29:04.106 --> 00:29:05.166 A:middle
here it's really easy.

00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:09.086 A:middle
We can just put margins
around all of our content,

00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:10.766 A:middle
which in this case
is just a label,

00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:12.906 A:middle
and it has an intrinsic
content size.

00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:15.046 A:middle
So when we put margins
around it,

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:18.796 A:middle
we fully specified
the constraints

00:29:18.796 --> 00:29:23.146 A:middle
of this particular cell, and
we'll get the size that we want.

00:29:23.326 --> 00:29:26.426 A:middle
You, however, might have some
more complex cells than this.

00:29:26.486 --> 00:29:28.356 A:middle
I understand that
this is an easy case.

00:29:28.996 --> 00:29:33.286 A:middle
And if you are in the position
where you find, you know, hey,

00:29:33.546 --> 00:29:35.116 A:middle
I've specified all
my constraints,

00:29:35.116 --> 00:29:37.426 A:middle
but I am not getting the height
that I thought I should get,

00:29:37.426 --> 00:29:42.176 A:middle
I want to give you a tip, which
is try adding a constraint

00:29:42.176 --> 00:29:43.466 A:middle
to your content view

00:29:43.756 --> 00:29:45.976 A:middle
that specifies the height
of the content view.

00:29:45.976 --> 00:29:48.276 A:middle
So you are using, in fact,

00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:49.976 A:middle
a height constraint
on the content view.

00:29:50.446 --> 00:29:52.716 A:middle
Then you can specify that
in terms of your content.

00:29:52.776 --> 00:29:56.196 A:middle
Here I can say hey, content
view height should be equal

00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:59.826 A:middle
to the height of the label
plus my top and bottom margins.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.376 --> 00:30:03.016 A:middle
In this case, that's
repeating work.

00:30:03.016 --> 00:30:05.036 A:middle
I don't really need
to do that here,

00:30:05.356 --> 00:30:07.026 A:middle
and I'll get the same thing.

00:30:07.426 --> 00:30:10.076 A:middle
But if in your app you are
not getting what you expect

00:30:11.116 --> 00:30:13.806 A:middle
and you add a height
constraint to your view,

00:30:13.806 --> 00:30:18.076 A:middle
and then that causes the
height of the cell to change,

00:30:18.906 --> 00:30:20.466 A:middle
then that's a great indication

00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:25.236 A:middle
that your constraints aren't
giving you quite the logic

00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:26.736 A:middle
that you expected them to.

00:30:27.266 --> 00:30:31.296 A:middle
So that's a great tool that
you can use to figure that out.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.906 A:middle
Now, once you have that,
you might want to think

00:30:34.906 --> 00:30:38.906 A:middle
about how you animate the height
changes of your cells, you know,

00:30:39.416 --> 00:30:42.976 A:middle
even using self-sizing
cells and Auto Layout.

00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:49.046 A:middle
Now, you can imagine if you had
some cell in here that you want

00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:52.996 A:middle
to change its content, you might
take the very naive approach

00:30:53.406 --> 00:30:56.536 A:middle
and update your model and
then call Reload Data.

00:30:56.536 --> 00:30:59.336 A:middle
And if you do that, it's
going to look like this,

00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:02.556 A:middle
where it snaps to the new
position of the table,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:02.556 A:middle
where it snaps to the new
position of the table,

00:31:02.876 --> 00:31:08.476 A:middle
and it gets the job done, but it
just isn't the user experience

00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:09.616 A:middle
that you wanted out of your app.

00:31:09.616 --> 00:31:11.696 A:middle
It doesn't quite look as
polished as it should be.

00:31:12.556 --> 00:31:16.686 A:middle
What you wanted was to have
that cell animate its height

00:31:17.196 --> 00:31:20.186 A:middle
and the cells around it
animate their positions smoothly

00:31:20.666 --> 00:31:23.426 A:middle
so everything dropped into place

00:31:23.426 --> 00:31:26.506 A:middle
and the user understood
what was happening.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:28.666 A:middle
So let's walk through
how you do that.

00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:30.466 A:middle
Thankfully, it's pretty simple.

00:31:31.486 --> 00:31:34.736 A:middle
Whenever you want to
specify a geometry change is

00:31:34.736 --> 00:31:40.496 A:middle
to be animated in table
view, you use a begin update

00:31:40.496 --> 00:31:43.306 A:middle
and update block with
the Table View API.

00:31:43.546 --> 00:31:47.076 A:middle
So first step is to call
Table View Begin Updates.

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:50.036 A:middle
This is true whether you are
using self-sizing cells or not.

00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:52.656 A:middle
This is the general way you
animate geometry changes

00:31:52.656 --> 00:31:53.266 A:middle
in table view.

00:31:54.026 --> 00:31:55.636 A:middle
Then you update your model.

00:31:56.836 --> 00:31:57.436 A:middle
That's easy.

00:31:58.086 --> 00:32:02.856 A:middle
Third step is if you're changing
the height of an onscreen cell,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.086 --> 00:32:02.856 A:middle
Third step is if you're changing
the height of an onscreen cell,

00:32:03.356 --> 00:32:05.746 A:middle
you can just reach into
that cell, get a reference

00:32:05.746 --> 00:32:08.076 A:middle
by calling Table View Cell
For Row At Index Path,

00:32:08.586 --> 00:32:10.436 A:middle
and change the contents
of that cell,

00:32:10.436 --> 00:32:12.376 A:middle
even changing the
constraints as needed.

00:32:12.636 --> 00:32:13.866 A:middle
Sometimes people think they need

00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:16.406 A:middle
to call Reload Rows
Of Index Path.

00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:17.686 A:middle
You don't actually
need to do that,

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.516 A:middle
and it won't get you quite
the optimal experience.

00:32:21.246 --> 00:32:23.086 A:middle
You actually can just
reach into the cell

00:32:23.086 --> 00:32:24.106 A:middle
and change its contents.

00:32:24.796 --> 00:32:25.946 A:middle
Then when you are
done with that,

00:32:26.596 --> 00:32:30.116 A:middle
you say Table View End
Updates, and table view

00:32:30.116 --> 00:32:33.816 A:middle
at that time recalculates
the geometry of all the rows,

00:32:34.346 --> 00:32:36.506 A:middle
including asking all
the onscreen rows

00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:38.856 A:middle
for their Auto Layout
information to get their height,

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:42.436 A:middle
and everything animates
into place as you saw.

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:45.946 A:middle
So begin updates, end
updates is the key to that.

00:32:47.356 --> 00:32:51.716 A:middle
So the last best practice
that I want to give you is how

00:32:51.716 --> 00:32:56.986 A:middle
to implement custom
collection view layouts

00:32:56.986 --> 00:33:00.606 A:middle
that invalidate themselves and
are very fast as they do it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:56.986 --> 00:33:00.606 A:middle
that invalidate themselves and
are very fast as they do it.

00:33:01.156 --> 00:33:03.196 A:middle
So I know this comes up a lot,

00:33:03.196 --> 00:33:05.566 A:middle
people write custom
collection view layouts,

00:33:05.856 --> 00:33:08.286 A:middle
and they're doing something,
they are changing something

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.586 A:middle
about themselves as
the user is scrolling,

00:33:10.706 --> 00:33:13.546 A:middle
and they have a hard time
keeping up with that layout.

00:33:14.156 --> 00:33:17.096 A:middle
Well, I am going to tell you
exactly how the Photos app

00:33:17.096 --> 00:33:21.116 A:middle
in iOS does this job so that
you can take that technique

00:33:21.186 --> 00:33:25.206 A:middle
and put it into your
custom layout that you have.

00:33:25.386 --> 00:33:28.986 A:middle
So the Photos layout has this
header, which is expressed

00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:31.926 A:middle
as a supplementary view
in collection view terms,

00:33:32.516 --> 00:33:35.606 A:middle
and when the user scrolls,
even though the cells move

00:33:35.666 --> 00:33:39.956 A:middle
with the scrolling, that header
view stays in place on screen.

00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:44.196 A:middle
This is the same basic idea
that I know many people want

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:46.286 A:middle
to implement in their
collection views,

00:33:46.766 --> 00:33:50.256 A:middle
and the Photos layout
is able to do this

00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:54.696 A:middle
by using a UICollectionView
invalidation context instance.

00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:58.556 A:middle
This is API that you can
find in UICollectionView.

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:02.816 A:middle
So the steps to this
are just a few.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:02.816 A:middle
So the steps to this
are just a few.

00:34:03.306 --> 00:34:04.886 A:middle
Number one is the most obvious.

00:34:05.236 --> 00:34:08.775 A:middle
The Photos layout is invalidated
on every bounds change.

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:10.806 A:middle
So every frame as the
user is scrolling,

00:34:11.545 --> 00:34:13.255 A:middle
the Photos layout
gets invalidated.

00:34:13.606 --> 00:34:14.166 A:middle
Piece of cake.

00:34:14.466 --> 00:34:15.376 A:middle
That's the easy part.

00:34:15.376 --> 00:34:17.106 A:middle
The question is, how
do we make that fast?

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:22.516 A:middle
And the answer is, the Photos
layout builds a targeted

00:34:22.516 --> 00:34:26.786 A:middle
invalidation context that is
specified to invalidate just

00:34:26.966 --> 00:34:30.846 A:middle
that header view so that
the collection view is able

00:34:30.846 --> 00:34:33.626 A:middle
to optimize, understanding
that the only view

00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:35.826 A:middle
that is being invalidated
is the header view

00:34:36.235 --> 00:34:37.416 A:middle
and none of the cells are.

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:40.416 A:middle
That allows the collection
view to do the entire operation

00:34:40.476 --> 00:34:43.226 A:middle
as fast as possible,
and it's so fast

00:34:43.226 --> 00:34:45.946 A:middle
that this can just be
repeated as necessary

00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:48.076 A:middle
at frame rate scrolling as fast,

00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:52.045 A:middle
even though the layout is being
invalidated on every frame.

00:34:52.545 --> 00:34:55.966 A:middle
So you can use that same
technique in any layout if,

00:34:55.996 --> 00:35:00.056 A:middle
in general, if you have
performance concerns using a


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:55.996 --> 00:35:00.056 A:middle
in general, if you have
performance concerns using a

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:00.896 A:middle
custom layout.

00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:02.396 A:middle
Generally speaking,

00:35:02.586 --> 00:35:05.736 A:middle
UICollectionView
invalidation context is the key

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.986 A:middle
to overcoming those
performance concerns.

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:11.626 A:middle
So I encourage you to
check out that API.

00:35:12.056 --> 00:35:16.296 A:middle
Okay. So I've talked
about a whole collection

00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:18.316 A:middle
of best practices here.

00:35:19.236 --> 00:35:21.366 A:middle
We talked about performance
and how

00:35:21.366 --> 00:35:24.236 A:middle
to make your apps
superresponsive at launch

00:35:24.236 --> 00:35:26.516 A:middle
and throughout its
life cycle and how

00:35:26.516 --> 00:35:28.526 A:middle
to make your Auto Layout
as fast as possible.

00:35:29.626 --> 00:35:32.926 A:middle
We've discussed user experience
as one of your great goals

00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
and animating your table views
around and laying out properly

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:39.126 A:middle
across the myriad
of iOS devices.

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:43.836 A:middle
And of course, I've given you
tips for how to write your code

00:35:43.836 --> 00:35:47.086 A:middle
in the most future-proof way so
that it's running on versions

00:35:47.086 --> 00:35:48.846 A:middle
of iOS for generations to come.

00:35:50.026 --> 00:35:53.436 A:middle
Now, I encourage you to use
this entire talk as a reference,

00:35:53.856 --> 00:35:56.126 A:middle
something you can come
back, watch the video

00:35:56.126 --> 00:35:57.616 A:middle
as you are building
your future apps.

00:35:57.616 --> 00:36:01.336 A:middle
There's a lot of best practices
here that you can use this


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.616 --> 00:36:01.336 A:middle
There's a lot of best practices
here that you can use this

00:36:01.416 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
as a launching board to then
go into the documentation,

00:36:05.566 --> 00:36:08.176 A:middle
look up the specific APIs
that I've referenced,

00:36:08.506 --> 00:36:11.126 A:middle
and you will be able to
put that to -- well --

00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:13.336 A:middle
best practice in all
of your future apps.

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:17.156 A:middle
So you know, with that, I
thank you, and I am glad

00:36:17.186 --> 00:36:19.516 A:middle
that you have come here to WWDC,
and I hope you have a best rest

00:36:19.516 --> 00:36:20.916 A:middle
of your afternoon possible.

00:36:21.516 --> 00:36:24.500 A:middle
[Applause]
