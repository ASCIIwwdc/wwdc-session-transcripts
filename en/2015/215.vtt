[Applause]

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:32.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: Good morning!

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.096 A:middle
Happy Thursday to everybody.

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:37.256 A:middle
Congratulations on making it

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.976 A:middle
to a 9:00 a.m. session
this late in the week.

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:40.086 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:41.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: I was
in your seats last year.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.036 A:middle
I know exactly how
difficult that can be.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:48.856 A:middle
Today we're going to talk
about some improvements

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:50.296 A:middle
that we've made to storyboards.

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:54.546 A:middle
Just to help everybody warm-up
and get ready for the day,

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.606 A:middle
I'm going to do a
quick exercise here.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.936 A:middle
How many people here
have shipped an app

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:00.606 A:middle
that uses storyboards?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:00.606 A:middle
that uses storyboards?

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:04.025 A:middle
That is a very good number.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:08.996 A:middle
How many people here have
maybe tried to use storyboards

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:11.476 A:middle
or thought about using
storyboards and either they

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:15.136 A:middle
or their team decided that this
isn't the way we want do this?

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:16.436 A:middle
Maybe not for now.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:22.816 A:middle
Okay. How many people
here have never used the

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.606 A:middle
storyboard before?

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:28.186 A:middle
Wow, this is a very
experienced crowd.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:29.586 A:middle
All right.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:33.886 A:middle
We're going to focus on
three main areas today:

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:36.976 A:middle
First we're going to talk about
a new feature that we've added

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:38.456 A:middle
to help you organize
your storyboards

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.816 A:middle
and keep them manageable
and then we're going to talk

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
about ways that you can
customize the standard segueway

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.586 A:middle
ways that we've provided
for you in Interface Builder

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:47.486 A:middle
and finally we're going to talk

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:50.546 A:middle
about what might be a little
bit more of an advanced feature,

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:54.916 A:middle
unwind segueway ways and how we
have improved them in relation

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:58.186 A:middle
to the custom container view
controllers that you use in iOS.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.446 A:middle
So let's get started.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.446 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:05.846 A:middle
We have a really simple
demo application here.

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:07.856 A:middle
It is just a collection
view that displays a bunch

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:09.795 A:middle
of photos inside of
navigation controller.

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
If I tap one of those
photos, it comes in onscreen.

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:16.906 A:middle
Then I can tap that back button

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:19.186 A:middle
in the upper-left
corner and it goes away.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:28.146 A:middle
The three components of that
user interface correspond

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:30.916 A:middle
to three view controller
instances at runtime.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.356 A:middle
If I were to diagram
this application

00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:36.186 A:middle
out on paper I might
do something like this.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.996 A:middle
It might represent those
view controllers as boxes

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:44.156 A:middle
and then draw lines between
them to describe the flow

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:45.206 A:middle
through my application.

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:49.526 A:middle
That's the kind of information
that a storyboard captures

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:51.186 A:middle
for you and let's
you use at runtime.

00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:55.056 A:middle
There's a bit of
specialized terminology

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:56.906 A:middle
with regard to storyboards.

00:02:56.906 --> 00:02:58.896 A:middle
Those boxes that have been
turned into circles here,

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:02.286 A:middle
we call those scenes and
they act as templates


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:02.286 A:middle
we call those scenes and
they act as templates

00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:04.106 A:middle
for the view controllers
that actually make

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:07.416 A:middle
up your user interface
at runtime.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:10.846 A:middle
Those lines we call segueways,
and there are a couple

00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:12.476 A:middle
of different kinds of segueways.

00:03:13.506 --> 00:03:14.776 A:middle
That relationship --

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:17.096 A:middle
that segueway between
the navigation controller

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.946 A:middle
and the collection view
controller is a kind

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:20.516 A:middle
of segueway called a
relationship segueway.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.226 A:middle
Specifically it states that that
collection view controller is

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.636 A:middle
at the root of the
navigation stack managed

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:28.866 A:middle
by that navigation controller.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:33.396 A:middle
Another kind of segueway
is a triggered segueway,

00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:36.886 A:middle
this one specificallys says
that when I tap on a cell

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.596 A:middle
in a collection view I want

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:41.866 A:middle
to show my photo view controller
using the semantics defined

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.066 A:middle
by the show view
controller method.

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:49.236 A:middle
When we actually
put this altogether

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:53.306 A:middle
in a storyboard file we
can give things identifiers

00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:56.656 A:middle
and then we set that up
in Interface Builder --

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:59.496 A:middle
in Xcode as our main
interface file for our project


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.166 A:middle
and we run the application.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.256 A:middle
The first thing that happens,

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.966 A:middle
is that we instantiate a
navigation controller based

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:08.666 A:middle
on what's in the initial
scene in our storyboard

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:12.156 A:middle
and then we see that there
is a relationship defined

00:04:12.156 --> 00:04:13.496 A:middle
on that navigation controller.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:18.446 A:middle
So we instantiate the view
controller at the other end

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:22.206 A:middle
of that segueway and then we
establish the relationship

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:24.586 A:middle
that is defined by
that segueway,

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:28.176 A:middle
that root of the
navigation stack.

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:32.126 A:middle
Later on as the user is using
our application they tap

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:36.446 A:middle
on a collection view cell
which performs that segueway

00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:37.996 A:middle
that we have labeled
show pic here,

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.836 A:middle
that's that show
segueway from before.

00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:43.716 A:middle
We instantiate the view
controller at the other end

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:46.816 A:middle
of that segueway and we
establish the relationship,

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:49.706 A:middle
we perform that action
that the segueway defines.

00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:52.946 A:middle
As you're designing
your application,

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.576 A:middle
you're implementing your
application your interfaces get

00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:57.566 A:middle
more complicated and
so do your storyboards.

00:04:58.156 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
Eventually in order to
keep things manageable,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.156 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
Eventually in order to
keep things manageable,

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:02.456 A:middle
just like you split your source
code into multiple files,

00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:05.296 A:middle
you split your storyboards
into multiple files,

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:09.406 A:middle
but we can't draw a segueway
across a file boundary.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:13.616 A:middle
We can fall back to code, we
can instantiate an instance

00:05:13.616 --> 00:05:14.896 A:middle
of that secondary storyboard,

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:19.326 A:middle
and we can instantiate view
controllers based on the scenes

00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:24.636 A:middle
in that storyboard, or
we have lost the ability

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:27.406 A:middle
to visualize the connection
between the scenes.

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:30.826 A:middle
What we really want to do is
we want to get that arrow back.

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:34.976 A:middle
That's what we have
done for you in Xcode 7

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:37.336 A:middle
with a new feature we call
Storyboard References.

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:43.686 A:middle
[Applause]

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:45.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: So just so
you know, you're all have

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:47.376 A:middle
to applaud again for Tony
because he actually did most

00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:48.976 A:middle
of the work on implementing
this.

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:50.046 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: A
storyboard reference stands

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:54.886 A:middle
in for another scene and
that scene can actually be

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:57.656 A:middle
in to the same storyboard
or in another storyboard.

00:05:58.196 --> 00:06:01.856 A:middle
Just like any scene, it can be


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.196 --> 00:06:01.856 A:middle
Just like any scene, it can be

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.896 A:middle
at the destination
end of any segueway.

00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:09.946 A:middle
Really that's all there is
to say about that so I'd

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:12.766 A:middle
like to ask Tony up, show you
how easy it is with Xcode 7

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:15.416 A:middle
to organize your
storyboards for OS X 10.11,

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
iOS 9 and watchOS using Xcode 7.

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:23.286 A:middle
[Applause]

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:24.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY RICCIARDI:
Thank you, Kyle.

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:28.366 A:middle
Good Morning, my name is Tony
and I work on Interface Builder.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:30.976 A:middle
In this (unintelligible),
I'll show you our new feature,

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.146 A:middle
called Storyboard References,

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.106 A:middle
but before we get started let me
show you the app we're building.

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:38.736 A:middle
This is an app to
help you organize

00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:40.466 A:middle
and plan events for a road trip.

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:44.686 A:middle
I implemented the UI for this
app using a custom container

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:47.896 A:middle
view controller which
manages four tabs.

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:50.286 A:middle
Each of these tabs
is implemented

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
with its own UI navigation
controller and you can open

00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:55.966 A:middle
up a tab by tapping
on its navigation bar.

00:06:56.676 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
This first tab shows a
table of upcoming events.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:56.676 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
This first tab shows a
table of upcoming events.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:05.666 A:middle
This tab shows a
journal of past events.

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.386 A:middle
Here we have a map
of upcoming stops.

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.546 A:middle
Finally, we have a
collection of photos

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:11.466 A:middle
that we have taken on our trip.

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:15.596 A:middle
You can tap on a photo cell to
get a larger view of the photo

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.696 A:middle
and you can tap on
this bar button item

00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:19.306 A:middle
to get a menu of
possible actions.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:24.206 A:middle
Let's take a look at the
main storyboard for my app.

00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:29.206 A:middle
Up here in the top left I
have my custom container view

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:32.996 A:middle
controller and that
container is connected to each

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:36.506 A:middle
of its four child navigation
controllers using an

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:37.196 A:middle
embed segueway.

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.316 A:middle
An embed segueway allows you

00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:44.216 A:middle
to embed a child view
controller inside of a parent.

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:46.616 A:middle
As you can see, over time
this storyboard has gotten

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.236 A:middle
pretty large.

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:49.096 A:middle
And so what I want to
do today is break it

00:07:49.096 --> 00:07:50.116 A:middle
up into smaller pieces.

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:56.866 A:middle
If we take a look at the bottom
of my storyboard you can see

00:07:56.866 --> 00:08:00.016 A:middle
that I have the three view
controllers for my photos tab.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.866 --> 00:08:00.016 A:middle
that I have the three view
controllers for my photos tab.

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:04.256 A:middle
These view controllers are
mostly independent of the rest

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.456 A:middle
of the scenes in my storyboard.

00:08:05.816 --> 00:08:07.316 A:middle
And so it would make
sense to pull them

00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.166 A:middle
out into their own file.

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:13.196 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to select
these view controllers and head

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:16.076 A:middle
up to the editor menu and
choose refactor to storyboard.

00:08:16.356 --> 00:08:20.086 A:middle
I'm going to call the new
file photos.storyboard.

00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:24.796 A:middle
When I do that, Xcode
generates a new storyboard file,

00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.216 A:middle
pulls those view controllers
out of my main storyboard

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.276 A:middle
and puts them in the new file.

00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:32.336 A:middle
What happened back in
the main storyboard file?

00:08:32.336 --> 00:08:33.385 A:middle
Let's use the back button.

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:35.916 A:middle
Down here where we used

00:08:35.976 --> 00:08:38.306 A:middle
to see those three view
controllers we now have a

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
storyboard reference.

00:08:40.936 --> 00:08:43.076 A:middle
Whenever you refactor
scenes from a storyboard

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:46.406 A:middle
and the scenes have incoming
segueways, Xcode is going

00:08:46.406 --> 00:08:50.006 A:middle
to take those segueways,
generate a storyboard reference

00:08:50.006 --> 00:08:51.696 A:middle
and reroute the segueways
to the reference.

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:54.826 A:middle
At runtime when this
segueway executes,

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:57.636 A:middle
it is going to instantiate
the initial view controller

00:08:57.636 --> 00:09:00.366 A:middle
out of my photo storyboard and
use that as its destination.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.636 --> 00:09:00.366 A:middle
out of my photo storyboard and
use that as its destination.

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:06.136 A:middle
If I double-click on this
reference Xcode takes me

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:08.766 A:middle
to that storyboard and
shows me the view controller

00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:09.366 A:middle
I'm referencing.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.716 A:middle
Which in this case is
the initial navigation...

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:13.156 A:middle
the initial view
controller of the storyboard.

00:09:14.526 --> 00:09:15.796 A:middle
That's one way to
use this feature.

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:17.996 A:middle
You can take a large
storyboard file

00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:19.756 A:middle
and refactor it into
smaller pieces.

00:09:20.696 --> 00:09:23.786 A:middle
Another way you can use this
feature is to create segueways

00:09:23.786 --> 00:09:26.256 A:middle
to view controllers that
already exist in separate files.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.576 A:middle
I'm going to create a new
segueway now and I want

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:32.416 A:middle
that segueway to be triggered
by this journal button.

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:35.656 A:middle
I want it to take me
back to a view controller

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:37.776 A:middle
in my main storyboard
file that manages the UI

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:39.246 A:middle
for creating a new
journal entry.

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:44.656 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to scroll
over to my photo view controller

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:48.146 A:middle
over here and I'm going to
drag out a storyboard reference

00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:49.956 A:middle
from the library and
drop it next to it.

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:53.806 A:middle
Let's take a look at
the Attributes inspector

00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:54.886 A:middle
for a storyboard reference.

00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:58.566 A:middle
As you can see, there
are three fields here.

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:01.086 A:middle
The first field is the name


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:01.086 A:middle
The first field is the name

00:10:01.086 --> 00:10:02.476 A:middle
of the storyboard file
you're referencing.

00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:06.536 A:middle
If you leave this blank Xcode
will use the same storyboard

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:08.336 A:middle
that contains the
reference itself,

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:10.866 A:middle
which in this case would
be the photo storyboard.

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.156 A:middle
That may be useful if you
have a really large storyboard

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:16.246 A:middle
and you want to create a
segueway from a view controller

00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:18.296 A:middle
on one side to a view
controller on another side.

00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:21.936 A:middle
In my case, I want to reference
the main storyboard so I'm going

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:25.396 A:middle
to choose main from the menu.

00:10:25.516 --> 00:10:27.566 A:middle
The next field is the identifier

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:28.846 A:middle
of the view controller
you're referencing.

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.546 A:middle
If you leave this blank Xcode
will use the initial view

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:34.026 A:middle
controller of the
referenced storyboard.

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:37.786 A:middle
In my case, I want to
reference a specific controller

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.536 A:middle
in my main storyboard
and I have given

00:10:39.536 --> 00:10:42.776 A:middle
that controller the
identifier new journal entry.

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:47.886 A:middle
The last field here is
the bundle identifier.

00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:51.276 A:middle
Your storyboard that
you're referencing might be

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.446 A:middle
in an external framework.

00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:53.956 A:middle
In that case, you'll want

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.816 A:middle
to put the framework's
bundle identifier here.

00:10:55.816 --> 00:10:59.686 A:middle
I'm going to leave it blank
because my main storyboard is

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:01.756 A:middle
in the same bundle as
my photo storyboard.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:01.756 A:middle
in the same bundle as
my photo storyboard.

00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:08.576 A:middle
Once again, now that my
storyboard reference is

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:12.026 A:middle
configured, if I double-click
on it, Xcode will take me

00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:13.606 A:middle
into my reference
storyboard file

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.636 A:middle
and show me the view
controller I'm referencing.

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:20.216 A:middle
In this case it is a navigation
controller and if we take a look

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:22.146 A:middle
at its Identity inspector
you can see

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:24.536 A:middle
that I have given it the
same identifier I just typed

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:25.946 A:middle
in the reference.

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:31.296 A:middle
The root view controller of this
navigation controller is this

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:32.976 A:middle
table view controller
which manages the UI

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:34.396 A:middle
for creating a new
journal entry.

00:11:34.846 --> 00:11:37.996 A:middle
Let's head back to
the photo storyboard

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:42.016 A:middle
and create a segueway
to that reference.

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.656 A:middle
Earlier I mentioned that I want
this segueway to be triggered

00:11:44.656 --> 00:11:45.506 A:middle
by this journal button.

00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:48.406 A:middle
You don't see that
journal button here

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:49.396 A:middle
in my photo view controller.

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:54.006 A:middle
That's because that menu
is up here in the SceneDoc.

00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:59.396 A:middle
The SceneDoc allows you to store
top level objects alongside your

00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:01.946 A:middle
view controller and you might
put a view in your SceneDoc


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:01.946 A:middle
view controller and you might
put a view in your SceneDoc

00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:04.526 A:middle
if you don't want that
view to initially be a part

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:05.726 A:middle
of the view hierarchy
at runtime.

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:08.996 A:middle
In Xcode 7 when you put
a view in your SceneDoc

00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:11.986 A:middle
and you select it, it
shows up in its own editor

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:13.886 A:middle
above the view controller
right there in the canvas.

00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:20.976 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:23.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY RICCIARDI: So now that
we can see the journal button,

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:24.756 A:middle
let's create that segueway.

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:28.236 A:middle
I'm going to control drag over
to my storyboard reference

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:30.676 A:middle
and I want to present this
view controller modally,

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:34.136 A:middle
so I'll choose that.

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:34.676 A:middle
All right.

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:36.006 A:middle
Let's see this segueway
in action.

00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:43.826 A:middle
So the first thing I
want to point out is

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:46.536 A:middle
that my photos tab is showing
up just like it did before,

00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:48.776 A:middle
even though now it is
coming from a separate file.

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:52.586 A:middle
If I tap on a cell and
bring down the menu and tap

00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:56.146 A:middle
on the journal button we
execute that segueway which goes

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:58.136 A:middle
into our main storyboard
file and instantiates

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:01.726 A:middle
that view controller by its
identifier and it works just


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:01.726 A:middle
that view controller by its
identifier and it works just

00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:03.096 A:middle
as if it was in the
same storyboard.

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:05.986 A:middle
That's our new Storyboard
Reference feature

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:07.306 A:middle
and I hope you find it useful.

00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:09.506 A:middle
Now I'll hand you
back over to Kyle.

00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:16.946 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:19.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: Thank you, Tony.

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:23.436 A:middle
Okay. So I gather that
everybody is really excited

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:23.986 A:middle
about that feature.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:25.066 A:middle
We're really happy
to have been able

00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:25.976 A:middle
to bring it to you this year.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:30.746 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:32.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: Let's talk
about something different.

00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:35.876 A:middle
Let's talk about how
you can customize some

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:37.416 A:middle
of the standard segueways
that we provide

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.936 A:middle
for you in Interface Builder.

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:43.136 A:middle
Looking at a different aspect
of our demo application here,

00:13:43.286 --> 00:13:46.436 A:middle
we have a journal that is
implemented using a table

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:46.986 A:middle
view controller.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:51.326 A:middle
If the user taps that
plus button at the top

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:54.736 A:middle
of the journal we want to
do a modal presentation just

00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:56.626 A:middle
like Tony showed you before
with the journal button

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:59.796 A:middle
and that's going to bring
up navigation controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:03.106 A:middle
that has a table view
controller inside of it.

00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:08.686 A:middle
Tap the cancel button, that
navigation controller goes away.

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:11.006 A:middle
That's the standard modal
presentation style coming

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:12.746 A:middle
up from the bottom of
the screen and going back

00:14:12.746 --> 00:14:14.516 A:middle
down to the bottom of the screen
that you see on an iPhone.

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:18.236 A:middle
What if you want to be fancy?

00:14:18.236 --> 00:14:23.886 A:middle
User taps the plus button,
we perform our segueway,

00:14:23.936 --> 00:14:26.286 A:middle
we want to be sparkly!

00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:32.936 A:middle
And if we're going to be fancy
in the incoming direction,

00:14:33.216 --> 00:14:35.796 A:middle
we really want to be equally
fancy when we're going away.

00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:39.456 A:middle
You might be familiar,

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:43.196 A:middle
if you are an experienced
storyboard user,

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.036 A:middle
with some of the options you
get when you select the segueway

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:47.956 A:middle
and look at the segueway
inspector.

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:52.026 A:middle
There are a couple of
standard transitions

00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:54.816 A:middle
that a modal presentation
can take on in iOS.

00:14:55.656 --> 00:14:58.496 A:middle
The default is coming from the
bottom, its that cover vertical,

00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:01.716 A:middle
but we can also do a horizontal
flip or cross dissolve,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:01.716 A:middle
but we can also do a horizontal
flip or cross dissolve,

00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:04.226 A:middle
but sparkly, really
isn't in this list.

00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:09.196 A:middle
One thing we can do in iOS
8 using earlier versions

00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:11.126 A:middle
of Xcode is we can
go and we can turn

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:12.346 A:middle
that into a custom segueway.

00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:16.226 A:middle
At that point we're responsible

00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:18.246 A:middle
for subclassing
UIStoryboardSegueway

00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:20.146 A:middle
and doing all of
the work ourselves.

00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:24.976 A:middle
That's not really all that
big a burden when it comes

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:28.586 A:middle
to actually presenting the view
controller, but it would be nice

00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:30.816 A:middle
if we didn't have to do that.

00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:34.636 A:middle
Specifically in this case we
need to do a bunch of work

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:35.576 A:middle
to set up the animation.

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:41.506 A:middle
In Xcode 7 when you're
targeting iOS 9

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:45.636 A:middle
or OS X 10.11 you can select any
of our standard segueway types

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:48.516 A:middle
and still be able to
specify a custom subclass

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:49.696 A:middle
of storyboard segueway.

00:15:50.196 --> 00:15:53.826 A:middle
You over-ride the perform
method just like you would

00:15:53.876 --> 00:15:57.146 A:middle
for a completely custom segueway
but now your implementation

00:15:57.146 --> 00:15:59.886 A:middle
of perform can call up
the supers implementation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:01.386 A:middle
and get the default behavior.

00:16:02.106 --> 00:16:04.876 A:middle
Around that super call you can
perform whatever customizations

00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:05.386 A:middle
you want.

00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:09.366 A:middle
What's really important
about this

00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:13.856 A:middle
for our modal presentation
case is that we will hang on to

00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:17.126 A:middle
that segueway object that gets
created when the user triggers

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:19.876 A:middle
that segueway for
the entire time

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:21.676 A:middle
that your modal presentation
is onscreen.

00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.826 A:middle
Usually segueway objects
are really transient,

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:28.626 A:middle
we perform the segueway, we
allocate a segueway, we send it,

00:16:28.626 --> 00:16:31.496 A:middle
perform, deallocate it,
but we're going to hold

00:16:31.496 --> 00:16:34.856 A:middle
on to your modal presentation
segueways and popover segueways

00:16:34.856 --> 00:16:38.076 A:middle
on iOS for the duration that
the view controller is onscreen

00:16:38.076 --> 00:16:39.326 A:middle
as long as you call
up the super.

00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:43.316 A:middle
Why am I making a
big deal out of this?

00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:45.806 A:middle
We need to go through how
you would actually implement

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.136 A:middle
that custom sparkle animation

00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:49.136 A:middle
or any custom modal
presentation animation.

00:16:50.146 --> 00:16:52.196 A:middle
We've got our application
nice and tiny up here,

00:16:52.736 --> 00:16:56.296 A:middle
and the user has tapped the
button to trigger the segueway.

00:16:56.856 --> 00:17:00.776 A:middle
The destination view controller
exists, it has been instantiated


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:56.856 --> 00:17:00.776 A:middle
The destination view controller
exists, it has been instantiated

00:17:00.776 --> 00:17:02.796 A:middle
from the storyboard but has
not been put onscreen yet.

00:17:03.566 --> 00:17:04.906 A:middle
We're going to send
perform to the segueway,

00:17:04.906 --> 00:17:08.406 A:middle
and the first thing that our
override or perform needs

00:17:08.406 --> 00:17:10.976 A:middle
to do is assign a
transitioning delegate

00:17:10.976 --> 00:17:12.316 A:middle
to the destination
view controller.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:18.646 A:middle
Then it will call super to begin
the normal modal presentation.

00:17:19.146 --> 00:17:22.016 A:middle
Now the destination
view controller,

00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:24.346 A:middle
when it gets
presentViewController

00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:26.596 A:middle
which is done by supers
implementation or perform,

00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:29.196 A:middle
is going to consult with
the transition delegate

00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:31.046 A:middle
to bend another object

00:17:31.906 --> 00:17:34.056 A:middle
that actually drives
the custom animation.

00:17:34.506 --> 00:17:38.706 A:middle
For more details on how this
series of protocols works,

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:41.076 A:middle
I suggest that you check out the
custom transitions using view

00:17:41.076 --> 00:17:43.336 A:middle
controller section
from WWDC2013.

00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:48.066 A:middle
Now in the other direction,
one the user is done

00:17:48.226 --> 00:17:50.306 A:middle
with our view controller,
they tap the cancel button.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.496 A:middle
The destination view controller,

00:17:53.496 --> 00:17:56.486 A:middle
since it is going away still
has a transitioning delegate

00:17:56.486 --> 00:17:58.826 A:middle
assigned to it and asks
that transitioning delegate

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:02.446 A:middle
for an animation controller
to drive the dismissal.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:02.446 A:middle
for an animation controller
to drive the dismissal.

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:05.466 A:middle
If we didn't hold on to our
segueway which in turn holds

00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:06.676 A:middle
on to our transition delegate,

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:08.736 A:middle
this all would have
been released

00:18:08.736 --> 00:18:10.916 A:middle
and in iOS 8 we probably
would have a crash here,

00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:12.566 A:middle
in iOS 9 it is a weak pointer

00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:14.606 A:middle
so we wouldn't have gotten
our nice custom animation.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:19.256 A:middle
Then animation controller gets
asked to drive the dismissal

00:18:19.796 --> 00:18:21.306 A:middle
and our fancy view goes away.

00:18:22.446 --> 00:18:24.216 A:middle
Another case where
this is important is

00:18:24.306 --> 00:18:26.316 A:middle
when you are handling
adaptivity.

00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:29.326 A:middle
For example, if you're
running on a iPhone

00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:32.056 A:middle
and the user rotates the
device, maybe an iPhone 6 Plus

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:35.286 A:middle
and you want to present a
different interface in landscape

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:38.406 A:middle
or portrait or you
have taken advantage

00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:41.326 A:middle
of the new multitasking
features in iOS 9 when running

00:18:41.326 --> 00:18:45.166 A:middle
on an iPad Air 2, and the
user has split your app 50/50

00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:48.706 A:middle
and you don't want to have, say,

00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:50.666 A:middle
a popover in the
compact presentation.

00:18:51.676 --> 00:18:54.646 A:middle
This specific example comes
from a talk on Tuesday,

00:18:54.646 --> 00:18:58.046 A:middle
getting started with
multitasking on iPad in iOS 9

00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:00.756 A:middle
which explains why you would
want to do something like this


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:00.756 A:middle
which explains why you would
want to do something like this

00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:03.816 A:middle
and in the cases in
which this would occur.

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:05.656 A:middle
Similarly to our
custom animation,

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:08.536 A:middle
we need to use the delegate
to customize the presentation.

00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:13.146 A:middle
Our user is going to trigger
whatever segueway brings

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:17.366 A:middle
up the modal presentation and
our overrider perform is going

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:18.896 A:middle
to assign an adaptive delegate

00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:21.866 A:middle
to that destination
view controller's

00:19:22.216 --> 00:19:23.286 A:middle
presentation controller.

00:19:24.086 --> 00:19:25.516 A:middle
It is just the delegate
property,

00:19:25.516 --> 00:19:28.716 A:middle
but the protocol is actually
called adaptive delegate.

00:19:28.716 --> 00:19:29.806 A:middle
Then we call super in order

00:19:29.806 --> 00:19:31.176 A:middle
to get the standard
modal presentation

00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:33.466 A:middle
to popover a full
screen, whatever happens

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.636 A:middle
to be appropriate for
the current size class.

00:19:36.636 --> 00:19:39.446 A:middle
Later on the user does something
to cause the size class

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:42.066 A:middle
to change this, rotates
their iPhone 6 Plus,

00:19:42.136 --> 00:19:46.336 A:middle
does 50/50 in split
view on iPad air 2.

00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:51.066 A:middle
The presentation
controller is going to inform

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.466 A:middle
that adaptive delegate that
we're changing size classes

00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:56.166 A:middle
and will turn around to
ask that adaptive delegate

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:57.596 A:middle
to have a new view controller

00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
to temporarily replace
the view controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
to temporarily replace
the view controller

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:01.826 A:middle
that is currently
being presented.

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:04.586 A:middle
For more information
on how this works,

00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:06.456 A:middle
last year my boss gave
a great presentation

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.876 A:middle
on view controller advancements
on iOS 8, last year,

00:20:09.926 --> 00:20:15.006 A:middle
not two years ago, but to
show you how this works today,

00:20:15.636 --> 00:20:18.376 A:middle
Tony will use Xcode 7 to
give us a custom animation.

00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:24.356 A:middle
[Applause]

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:25.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY RICCIARDI:
Thank you, Kyle.

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:31.666 A:middle
In this demo I will show you
a few ways you can add custom

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:33.256 A:middle
Logic to your segueways
with code.

00:20:34.556 --> 00:20:36.626 A:middle
If you've used storyboards
before you have probably written

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:39.526 A:middle
code to pass along data from
a source view controller

00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:42.196 A:middle
to its destination while
preparing to execute a segueway.

00:20:43.246 --> 00:20:45.836 A:middle
What you may not know is it
is also possible to customize

00:20:45.956 --> 00:20:48.096 A:middle
when a segueway triggers
or how it animates.

00:20:48.826 --> 00:20:53.466 A:middle
To show you that, I will create
a segueway here and specifically

00:20:53.826 --> 00:20:55.256 A:middle
when a user taps
this delete button,

00:20:55.256 --> 00:20:58.396 A:middle
I want to conditionally
present a confirmation sheet

00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:01.956 A:middle
if this photo here is
associated with a journal entry.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:01.956 A:middle
if this photo here is
associated with a journal entry.

00:21:03.056 --> 00:21:07.066 A:middle
The first step in doing that is
to drag out of view controller

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.466 A:middle
from the library which
will represent our

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:10.846 A:middle
confirmation sheet.

00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:14.056 A:middle
I give this view
controller a custom class

00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:17.686 A:middle
which I have already
added to the project.

00:21:18.206 --> 00:21:20.296 A:middle
This class implements load view

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:22.316 A:middle
to create its view
from the code.

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:24.546 A:middle
The view controller doesn't
need this view that came along

00:21:24.546 --> 00:21:25.536 A:middle
with it from the library.

00:21:26.476 --> 00:21:29.506 A:middle
I'll click on the
view and remove it.

00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:33.286 A:middle
Now that this view controller is
no longer going to get its view

00:21:33.286 --> 00:21:36.696 A:middle
from its storyboard, at runtime
the framework will fall back

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:39.006 A:middle
to my view controller's
implementation of load view.

00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:43.346 A:middle
Now that we have our
confirmation sheet view

00:21:43.346 --> 00:21:46.156 A:middle
controller let's
create a segueway to it.

00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:48.906 A:middle
I want this segueway to be
triggered from code rather

00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:51.756 A:middle
than from a particular
button press.

00:21:51.756 --> 00:21:54.646 A:middle
Rather than dragging out
the segueway from a sub view

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.026 A:middle
in my view controller's
hierarchy I'll drag it

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:58.556 A:middle
out from the view
controller itself.

00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:01.926 A:middle
To do that, I'll control
drag from this icon


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:01.926 A:middle
To do that, I'll control
drag from this icon

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:03.546 A:middle
in my sourceViewController
SceneDoc

00:22:03.876 --> 00:22:05.016 A:middle
over to the destination.

00:22:05.766 --> 00:22:08.306 A:middle
Once again, I want to present
this view controller modally.

00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:14.706 A:middle
I want the code that
executes this segueway

00:22:15.226 --> 00:22:17.366 A:middle
to be triggered by
the delete button.

00:22:17.976 --> 00:22:20.186 A:middle
What I want to do now
is create an IB action

00:22:20.476 --> 00:22:22.886 A:middle
from the delete button.

00:22:22.886 --> 00:22:25.596 A:middle
I open up the assistant
editor taking me

00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:29.856 A:middle
to the implementation file
for my photo view controller.

00:22:29.856 --> 00:22:33.056 A:middle
Now I'm going to control-drag
from the delete button

00:22:33.216 --> 00:22:36.636 A:middle
over to my source code and
I get a popover allowing me

00:22:36.636 --> 00:22:39.226 A:middle
to configure my new connection.

00:22:40.696 --> 00:22:43.456 A:middle
As I said, I want this to
be an action and I'm going

00:22:43.806 --> 00:22:49.886 A:middle
to call it delete photo.

00:22:49.886 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
Xcode generates an IB action
method and now I'm just going

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:56.386 A:middle
to paste in some code here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:01.176 --> 00:23:03.076 A:middle
There you go.

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:06.956 A:middle
In this code it checks if there
is an associated journal entry,

00:23:07.626 --> 00:23:11.066 A:middle
if so it calls perform
segueway with identifier

00:23:11.636 --> 00:23:17.356 A:middle
and the identifier pass
in here let's me refer

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:19.556 A:middle
to that segueway we just
created in the storyboard.

00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:23.506 A:middle
I'm going to give that
segueway the same identifier

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:24.066 A:middle
in just a moment.

00:23:24.476 --> 00:23:27.546 A:middle
First I want to point out I
also referred to that identifier

00:23:27.736 --> 00:23:29.206 A:middle
from my prepare for
segueway method.

00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:34.486 A:middle
In this method I pass along
that associated journal entry

00:23:34.526 --> 00:23:37.456 A:middle
to the destination view
controller, which allows it is

00:23:37.456 --> 00:23:39.676 A:middle
to present the details
of that journal entry

00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:41.306 A:middle
in its confirmation sheet.

00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:45.376 A:middle
Now let's head over
to the storyboard

00:23:45.376 --> 00:23:48.816 A:middle
and select the segueway and head
up to the Attributes inspector.

00:23:49.236 --> 00:23:54.456 A:middle
I'm going to type in that same
identifier here, confirm delete.

00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:59.546 A:middle
You may notice if you used the
segueway Attributes inspector

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
before, there is a new
field under the identifier


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
before, there is a new
field under the identifier

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:04.556 A:middle
which allows you to specify
a custom segueway class.

00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:08.796 A:middle
In Xcode 7 you can now
provide a subclass for any

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:10.336 A:middle
of the system provided
segueway types.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:15.876 A:middle
This works both on iOS
9 and Mac OS X 10.11.

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:18.216 A:middle
I have a custom segueway
I have added to my project

00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:19.316 A:middle
and I will choose that here.

00:24:19.406 --> 00:24:21.516 A:middle
It is called scaling
animation segueway.

00:24:22.856 --> 00:24:25.416 A:middle
Let's take a look at the
implementation for that class.

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:27.696 A:middle
I'm going to close
the assistant,

00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:29.886 A:middle
then I'll use the
jump bar to head

00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:32.416 A:middle
over to my scaling
animation segueway.

00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:36.936 A:middle
The first thing I
want to point out is

00:24:36.936 --> 00:24:40.636 A:middle
that this segueway derives
from UIStoryboardSegueway

00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:41.796 A:middle
and then conforms

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:44.596 A:middle
to the protocol UIViewController
transitioning delegate.

00:24:45.456 --> 00:24:47.436 A:middle
This protocol allows
you to vend objects

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:50.956 A:middle
which control the animation
both for the presentation

00:24:51.106 --> 00:24:53.066 A:middle
and for the dismissal
of the modal child.

00:24:55.626 --> 00:24:58.676 A:middle
First I override the
perform method and in

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:00.776 A:middle
that method I set the segueway


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:00.776 A:middle
that method I set the segueway

00:25:00.986 --> 00:25:03.126 A:middle
as the destination view
controller's transitional

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.056 A:middle
delegate and I call super

00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:06.776 A:middle
which kicks off the
modal presentation.

00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:10.456 A:middle
Next I override two methods

00:25:10.456 --> 00:25:12.156 A:middle
from the transitioning
delegate protocol.

00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:14.636 A:middle
Animation controller for
presented controller,

00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:17.626 A:middle
and animation controller
for dismissed controller.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:23.476 A:middle
The objects that I return from
each of these methods conform

00:25:23.936 --> 00:25:27.026 A:middle
to the UIViewController
animated transitioning protocol.

00:25:28.366 --> 00:25:30.076 A:middle
In this protocol, it
contains the methods

00:25:30.076 --> 00:25:31.796 A:middle
that actually control
the animation.

00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:37.536 A:middle
Down here in my presentation
animator I have a pretty simple

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:40.676 A:middle
animation which scales up the
destination view controller

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:41.686 A:middle
from the center of the screen.

00:25:42.846 --> 00:25:43.976 A:middle
Let's see the segueway
in action.

00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:49.026 A:middle
All right.

00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:51.706 A:middle
Once again I'll tap on a
cell and bring down the menu.

00:25:52.536 --> 00:25:58.026 A:middle
When I tap on this delete button
our custom segueway executes

00:25:58.026 --> 00:25:59.126 A:middle
with our custom animation.

00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:01.656 A:middle
We see our confirmation sheet.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:01.656 A:middle
We see our confirmation sheet.

00:26:02.396 --> 00:26:08.476 A:middle
Now when I cancel this we run
our dismissal animation using

00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:09.386 A:middle
our dismissal animator.

00:26:09.946 --> 00:26:13.946 A:middle
So you saw a couple of different
ways you can customize your

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:17.866 A:middle
segueways with code and
I encourage you to check

00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:20.826 A:middle
out the rest of our segueway
API on UIViewController

00:26:20.826 --> 00:26:21.926 A:middle
and UIStoryboardSegueway.

00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:25.376 A:middle
That wraps up our demo
on custom segueways.

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:28.966 A:middle
Again, let's head back to Kyle
to take us to the next segment.

00:26:29.516 --> 00:26:35.376 A:middle
[Applause]

00:26:35.876 --> 00:26:36.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: Thank you.

00:26:36.226 --> 00:26:40.746 A:middle
So I know it is an
advanced crowd here,

00:26:40.746 --> 00:26:43.416 A:middle
pretty experienced
with storyboards.

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:46.256 A:middle
How many people here have
used unwind segueways before?

00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:51.086 A:middle
Substantially fewer than have
used storyboards themselves.

00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:53.776 A:middle
How many people here have
implemented a custom container

00:26:53.776 --> 00:26:54.926 A:middle
view controller on iOS?

00:26:55.556 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
About the same number.

00:26:58.646 --> 00:27:00.096 A:middle
One thing that I'm
really excited to talk


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.646 --> 00:27:00.096 A:middle
One thing that I'm
really excited to talk

00:27:00.096 --> 00:27:02.496 A:middle
about this year is how we have
made those two features work

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:03.116 A:middle
better together.

00:27:04.126 --> 00:27:06.306 A:middle
For those of you that aren't
familiar with an unwind segueway

00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:08.856 A:middle
and what it does,
the best analogy

00:27:08.856 --> 00:27:11.726 A:middle
that I have found is the map.

00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:15.286 A:middle
So imagine I'm hanging out
here at Grace Cathedral,

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:18.046 A:middle
which is that really nice
geometric church that's

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:21.266 A:middle
up on Nob Hill, you can see
it from places from downtown.

00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:24.196 A:middle
And it being at the
top of a hill,

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:26.326 A:middle
figure we'll take a
nice long downhill walk

00:27:26.326 --> 00:27:27.086 A:middle
to the ferry terminal.

00:27:27.086 --> 00:27:33.526 A:middle
Hang out at the ferry terminal
for a bit, get my organic kale

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:37.056 A:middle
and my blue bottle coffee and
since I'm on the Embarcadero,

00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:41.586 A:middle
I may as well take a nice long
flat walk to Fisherman's Wharf.

00:27:41.586 --> 00:27:44.376 A:middle
Now I'm really tired.

00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:47.736 A:middle
I want to go home.

00:27:48.396 --> 00:27:51.276 A:middle
What I don't want
to do is turn around

00:27:51.276 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
and come back the way I
came because A, I don't live

00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:56.546 A:middle
at the Cathedral, and B, that's
not even the shortest way

00:27:56.546 --> 00:27:57.326 A:middle
to get to the Cathedral.

00:27:57.846 --> 00:28:03.216 A:middle
What I want to do is first
figure out where I'm going,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.846 --> 00:28:03.216 A:middle
What I want to do is first
figure out where I'm going,

00:28:04.646 --> 00:28:09.516 A:middle
second, find that
location, and third,

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:12.686 A:middle
plot and execute a route
to that destination.

00:28:13.556 --> 00:28:15.196 A:middle
That's what unwind segueways do.

00:28:16.316 --> 00:28:19.286 A:middle
They find a path to a
specific destination

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:21.746 A:middle
that doesn't necessarily
mean that we go backwards

00:28:21.816 --> 00:28:22.746 A:middle
through the way we came.

00:28:23.256 --> 00:28:27.596 A:middle
To give you a more concrete
example using an actual

00:28:27.596 --> 00:28:29.486 A:middle
application let's go back

00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:32.636 A:middle
to this demo application
we have been using

00:28:32.636 --> 00:28:33.996 A:middle
with our tab bar controller...

00:28:34.096 --> 00:28:37.366 A:middle
sorry, our custom tab
controller and the table view

00:28:38.086 --> 00:28:40.576 A:middle
and its navigation
controller that contains it.

00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:43.026 A:middle
As the user uses
our application,

00:28:43.026 --> 00:28:44.786 A:middle
our view controller
hierarchy changes.

00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:49.536 A:middle
They may tap on an
image and push something

00:28:49.536 --> 00:28:55.496 A:middle
into the nav controller
that is a child of that tab.

00:28:55.716 --> 00:28:56.866 A:middle
That's where we're at right now.

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
At this point the user
says I want to go back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
At this point the user
says I want to go back

00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:02.306 A:middle
to that journal table I
was looking at before.

00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:10.726 A:middle
So when they ask to do that,

00:29:11.326 --> 00:29:12.926 A:middle
we're going to perform
a segueway

00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:15.356 A:middle
from our photo view controller.

00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:19.696 A:middle
It is an unwind segueway with
the identifier goBackToJournal.

00:29:20.026 --> 00:29:23.976 A:middle
The first thing that
unwind segueway needs

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.666 A:middle
to do is identify
the destination.

00:29:26.176 --> 00:29:30.496 A:middle
The way we find our
destination, the way we dermine

00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:32.216 A:middle
that we've found what
we're looking for,

00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:33.876 A:middle
it is with some code.

00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:38.836 A:middle
That code is in our subclass
of UITableViewController

00:29:39.436 --> 00:29:42.256 A:middle
and it is a method that I have
chosen to call iAmTheJournal.

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:44.496 A:middle
That method doesn't do anything.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.056 A:middle
It is an ID action that takes
a UI storyboard segueway

00:29:47.556 --> 00:29:50.166 A:middle
and exists solely so
that we can determine

00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:52.376 A:middle
that we have found the view
controller we are looking for.

00:29:58.216 --> 00:30:00.496 A:middle
Step two is finding
the destination.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.216 --> 00:30:00.496 A:middle
Step two is finding
the destination.

00:30:01.006 --> 00:30:06.446 A:middle
So we start by looking at the
parent of our current source.

00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:12.196 A:middle
In iOS 8 we ask this view
controller -- excuse me.

00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:15.716 A:middle
In iOS 8 we ask this
view controller,

00:30:15.716 --> 00:30:17.886 A:middle
viewController
ForUnwindseguewayAction.

00:30:18.536 --> 00:30:21.206 A:middle
This view controller would look
through its children trying

00:30:21.206 --> 00:30:23.406 A:middle
to find a view controller
that responded

00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:28.916 A:middle
to that iAmTheJournal selector
that we have specified here.

00:30:29.376 --> 00:30:31.646 A:middle
We have set that
up in the inspector

00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:32.576 A:middle
for our unwind segueway.

00:30:33.126 --> 00:30:39.006 A:middle
That method is great for smaller
view controller hierarchies

00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:40.326 A:middle
but doesn't really
handle the kind

00:30:40.326 --> 00:30:42.246 A:middle
of viewer controller hierarchy
we have in this application.

00:30:43.526 --> 00:30:47.486 A:middle
In iOS 9 we have deprecated
that method and replaced it

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:50.896 A:middle
with a new method, allowed child
view controllers for unwinding

00:30:50.896 --> 00:30:53.666 A:middle
from source, and what
this method returns,

00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:56.746 A:middle
instead an individual view
controller, returns an array

00:30:56.746 --> 00:30:59.916 A:middle
of the children of the
receiver that we should look

00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:02.126 A:middle
through to try to find
the destination So we want


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:02.126 A:middle
through to try to find
the destination So we want

00:31:04.316 --> 00:31:07.496 A:middle
to actually return a
subset, we don't want to try

00:31:07.496 --> 00:31:11.126 A:middle
to find an unwind
destination that's a descendant

00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:12.116 A:middle
of where we're coming from.

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:13.886 A:middle
We also have another new method,

00:31:14.246 --> 00:31:16.336 A:middle
child view controller
containing segueway source

00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:19.816 A:middle
that are an override of allow
child view controllers can use

00:31:19.816 --> 00:31:21.976 A:middle
to figure out where
we're coming from.

00:31:23.296 --> 00:31:26.326 A:middle
The implementation on UI
navigation controller calls

00:31:26.326 --> 00:31:29.746 A:middle
that method to figure out where
we're coming from and says, oh,

00:31:29.746 --> 00:31:31.306 A:middle
that photo view controller
is the source,

00:31:31.506 --> 00:31:32.746 A:middle
therefore contains the source.

00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:37.806 A:middle
The returned array of child
view controllers omits

00:31:37.806 --> 00:31:39.836 A:middle
that view controller and
we get an array of 1.

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:44.256 A:middle
At this point the
storyboard runtime recurses

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:46.586 A:middle
into that array starting with
the first and only element.

00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:50.876 A:middle
We ask this, the collection
view controller that's currently

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:54.606 A:middle
obscured what children do you
have that we should search

00:31:54.606 --> 00:31:56.836 A:middle
through to find the destination
of our unwind segueway?

00:31:57.396 --> 00:31:59.166 A:middle
It doesn't have any children.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:03.866 A:middle
We have the base case for
our recursion and we ask it,

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:07.226 A:middle
can you perform the unwind
segueway action we're

00:32:07.226 --> 00:32:07.716 A:middle
looking for.

00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:14.216 A:middle
It can't. We haven't
found our destination.

00:32:15.276 --> 00:32:17.166 A:middle
Let's try the search
again one level

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.536 A:middle
up the view controller
hierarchy chain.

00:32:19.046 --> 00:32:23.706 A:middle
Same method as before, this
new method allowed child view

00:32:23.706 --> 00:32:25.886 A:middle
controllers from
unwinding from source.

00:32:26.556 --> 00:32:31.376 A:middle
Its implementation, our
custom view controller,

00:32:31.686 --> 00:32:33.066 A:middle
only wants to go backwards,

00:32:33.066 --> 00:32:34.486 A:middle
vertically up through
that stack.

00:32:35.396 --> 00:32:38.866 A:middle
It asks itself which of
my children contains the

00:32:38.866 --> 00:32:39.556 A:middle
unwind source?

00:32:40.056 --> 00:32:44.646 A:middle
That photo nav controller
contains the source

00:32:45.716 --> 00:32:47.786 A:middle
so the array it returns
omits that child.

00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:50.876 A:middle
We have again an array of
one child that we're return

00:32:50.876 --> 00:32:54.456 A:middle
from this method and
the runtime recurses.

00:32:55.076 --> 00:32:57.496 A:middle
Which of your children
should we look

00:32:57.496 --> 00:32:59.196 A:middle
through to find the
unwind source?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.246 --> 00:33:01.386 A:middle
I'm sorry, the unwind
destination.

00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:05.526 A:middle
This navigation controller
doesn't have any --

00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:07.526 A:middle
doesn't have the source
of the descendants,

00:33:07.526 --> 00:33:10.926 A:middle
we can skip over that for
now and we recurse again.

00:33:10.926 --> 00:33:13.786 A:middle
We ask the Table
view controller,

00:33:13.786 --> 00:33:14.926 A:middle
which of your children
should we look

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.026 A:middle
through to find the destination?

00:33:16.026 --> 00:33:17.636 A:middle
It doesn't have any children.

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:21.666 A:middle
We ask it, can you perform
the unwind segueway action?

00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:25.426 A:middle
That's what that method is
that I implemented earlier

00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:28.446 A:middle
that didn't have actually any
body to its implementation.

00:33:29.056 --> 00:33:31.866 A:middle
That's our sentinel, we found
it, we found our destination.

00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
Now at this point, in iOS
8 we would ask the parent

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:47.466 A:middle
of our destination to return
us a segueway that knows how

00:33:47.466 --> 00:33:49.346 A:middle
to restore our view
controller hierarchy

00:33:49.676 --> 00:33:51.116 A:middle
such that our destination
is visible.

00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:54.686 A:middle
That's a really hard
question to answer

00:33:54.786 --> 00:33:57.756 A:middle
for more complicated view
controller hierarchies.

00:33:58.316 --> 00:34:02.216 A:middle
We have deprecated that
method and we replaced it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.316 --> 00:34:02.216 A:middle
We have deprecated that
method and we replaced it

00:34:02.216 --> 00:34:04.236 A:middle
with a feature we call
incremental unwinding.

00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:09.085 A:middle
This feature let's every view
controller from the source

00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:11.636 A:middle
to the destination
participate in the unwind

00:34:11.636 --> 00:34:14.656 A:middle
so that it only needs to
use the local knowledge.

00:34:15.456 --> 00:34:18.576 A:middle
The runtime will construct a
UI storyboard segueway object

00:34:18.826 --> 00:34:22.806 A:middle
for you using whatever subclass
you specified in the inspector

00:34:22.806 --> 00:34:23.496 A:middle
and Interface Builder.

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:29.386 A:middle
It will ask it to perform.

00:34:29.516 --> 00:34:33.406 A:middle
Here is step three,
follow the route.

00:34:33.606 --> 00:34:34.636 A:middle
Well, we have found the route

00:34:34.966 --> 00:34:36.706 A:middle
from the source to
the destination.

00:34:37.235 --> 00:34:42.505 A:middle
The first thing we're going
to do is ask the first hop

00:34:42.505 --> 00:34:44.466 A:middle
on that route to unwind

00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:46.025 A:middle
for segueway towards
view controller.

00:34:46.025 --> 00:34:48.815 A:middle
We're going to ask the
parent of the source

00:34:49.916 --> 00:34:52.505 A:middle
to perform whatever action
is necessary to get us

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:55.775 A:middle
to the next step in the chain.

00:34:55.996 --> 00:34:58.146 A:middle
The child view controller
doesn't know anything

00:34:58.146 --> 00:34:58.586 A:middle
about its parent.

00:34:58.586 --> 00:35:00.886 A:middle
This method actually
doesn't do anything.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.586 --> 00:35:00.886 A:middle
This method actually
doesn't do anything.

00:35:01.236 --> 00:35:02.926 A:middle
It has been told unwind
towards your parent,

00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:04.546 A:middle
that's not the child's
responsibility.

00:35:05.026 --> 00:35:08.446 A:middle
Next we get to our custom
container view controller.

00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:12.536 A:middle
We ask it, okay, unwind
towards our journal

00:35:12.536 --> 00:35:13.466 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:17.326 A:middle
This is something that the
custom tab controller is

00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:20.946 A:middle
actually responsible for and it
knows how to rearrange itself

00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:24.146 A:middle
so that the journal navigation
controller is visible.

00:35:24.396 --> 00:35:31.826 A:middle
Next up on the chain we ask our
navigation controller to unwind

00:35:31.826 --> 00:35:32.816 A:middle
to the table view controller.

00:35:32.816 --> 00:35:35.996 A:middle
It is already at the top
of the navigation stack

00:35:35.996 --> 00:35:37.096 A:middle
so there is nothing to do here.

00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:40.546 A:middle
We returned where
the user wants to go.

00:35:41.026 --> 00:35:44.026 A:middle
This is how all this
stuff works internally.

00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:46.156 A:middle
Tony will show you how

00:35:46.156 --> 00:35:47.566 A:middle
to implement it in
your application.

00:35:48.516 --> 00:35:52.646 A:middle
[Applause]

00:35:53.146 --> 00:35:54.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY RICCIARDI:
Thank you, Kyle.

00:35:54.176 --> 00:35:57.196 A:middle
In this demo I'll show you
how to use unwind segueways

00:35:57.406 --> 00:35:58.966 A:middle
with a custom container
view controller.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:03.716 A:middle
You might remember in our first
demo we created a segueway

00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:04.616 A:middle
from this journal button.

00:36:05.336 --> 00:36:07.606 A:middle
This modal sheet for
creating a new journal entry.

00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:12.096 A:middle
Unfortunately we haven't
implemented any functionality

00:36:12.096 --> 00:36:12.876 A:middle
for this done button.

00:36:13.636 --> 00:36:16.266 A:middle
What I want to do now is
create an unwind segueway

00:36:16.266 --> 00:36:17.746 A:middle
from this done button and I want

00:36:17.746 --> 00:36:19.166 A:middle
that unwind segueway
button to do a few things.

00:36:20.186 --> 00:36:22.786 A:middle
First of all, I want it to
dismiss this modal sheet.

00:36:23.856 --> 00:36:27.006 A:middle
I want it to pop my
photo view controller off

00:36:27.006 --> 00:36:28.066 A:middle
of the navigation stack.

00:36:28.976 --> 00:36:31.876 A:middle
I want it to switch tabs
over to my journal tab.

00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:33.956 A:middle
I want it to descend

00:36:33.956 --> 00:36:36.536 A:middle
down through this navigation
controller and finally end

00:36:36.536 --> 00:36:38.026 A:middle
up at this table view controller

00:36:38.376 --> 00:36:40.196 A:middle
where we'll insert a
new table view cell

00:36:40.196 --> 00:36:41.056 A:middle
for the new journal entry.

00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
That's a lot to ask
for one segueway.

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:46.346 A:middle
Where do we get started?

00:36:46.506 --> 00:36:49.916 A:middle
The first step in creating
an unwind segueway is

00:36:49.966 --> 00:36:52.676 A:middle
to define a special
type of IB action method

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:54.796 A:middle
in the view controller
you're unwinding to.

00:36:55.086 --> 00:36:59.036 A:middle
In this case, it is our
journal table view controller.

00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:00.756 A:middle
Over here in the implementation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:00.756 A:middle
Over here in the implementation

00:37:00.756 --> 00:37:03.616 A:middle
for that controller you can
see I have an IB action method.

00:37:04.486 --> 00:37:06.046 A:middle
And this IB action
method is special

00:37:06.196 --> 00:37:08.446 A:middle
because it is taking
a UIStoryboardSegueway

00:37:08.676 --> 00:37:09.776 A:middle
as its only paramater.

00:37:11.276 --> 00:37:14.746 A:middle
Whenever Xcode sees an IB
action method it takes a

00:37:14.746 --> 00:37:17.846 A:middle
UIStoryboardSegueway as its
only paramater and allows you

00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:21.106 A:middle
to create unwind segueways
targeting that selector.

00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:26.786 A:middle
Within this method I grab
the source view controller

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:30.266 A:middle
of the segueway which in this
case is that view controller

00:37:30.266 --> 00:37:31.536 A:middle
for creating a new
journal entry.

00:37:31.856 --> 00:37:36.046 A:middle
I use that view controller's
journal entry and add it

00:37:36.076 --> 00:37:39.336 A:middle
to our model which refreshes
the table and inserts a new cell

00:37:39.586 --> 00:37:41.036 A:middle
and scrolls to that
cell's position.

00:37:41.486 --> 00:37:45.736 A:middle
Now that we have seen the action
that we're unwinding towards,

00:37:46.106 --> 00:37:47.466 A:middle
let's head over to
our storyboard

00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:49.436 A:middle
and create a segueway
targeting that selector.

00:37:49.966 --> 00:37:54.176 A:middle
Here we aree at the
view controller

00:37:54.176 --> 00:37:55.376 A:middle
for creating a new journal entry

00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:59.716 A:middle
and we'll create an unwind
segueway from this done button.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.446 --> 00:38:02.806 A:middle
To do that, we'll control-drag
from the done button

00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:05.766 A:middle
to the exit place
holder in the SceneDoc.

00:38:06.916 --> 00:38:10.336 A:middle
The exit place holder serves
as a place holder for all

00:38:10.336 --> 00:38:11.816 A:middle
of the valid unwind actions

00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:13.576 A:middle
that Xcode has found
in your work space.

00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:17.226 A:middle
It determines that a method is
a valid unwind action once again

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:19.726 A:middle
based on whether it
is an IB action method

00:38:19.726 --> 00:38:21.206 A:middle
that takes a
UIStoryboardSegueway.

00:38:22.086 --> 00:38:27.516 A:middle
It found that method we saw
so I'm going to select that.

00:38:27.726 --> 00:38:29.976 A:middle
Normally when you create an
unwind segueway that's all you

00:38:29.976 --> 00:38:30.386 A:middle
have to do.

00:38:30.576 --> 00:38:33.596 A:middle
You define the unwind selector
and create the segueway to it.

00:38:34.286 --> 00:38:37.256 A:middle
In my case I want to
execute some custom logic

00:38:38.016 --> 00:38:40.496 A:middle
which allows my custom
container view controller

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:42.186 A:middle
to switch between these tabs.

00:38:43.186 --> 00:38:46.406 A:middle
That logic is in my custom
container view controller file

00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:51.626 A:middle
so let's head over there.

00:38:51.836 --> 00:38:54.186 A:middle
As you can see, in this
view controller I have

00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:56.886 A:middle
over ridden unwind for segueway
towards view controller.

00:38:57.986 --> 00:38:59.336 A:middle
In this method I do two things.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.826 --> 00:39:03.516 A:middle
First of all, I take the
currently selected navigation

00:39:03.516 --> 00:39:06.206 A:middle
controller, and I pop that down
to the root view controller.

00:39:07.526 --> 00:39:10.276 A:middle
Then I set the selected
navigation controller

00:39:10.626 --> 00:39:13.366 A:middle
to be this parameter
subsequent view controller.

00:39:14.696 --> 00:39:16.986 A:middle
Subsequent view controller
is the next step

00:39:17.056 --> 00:39:17.836 A:middle
in the unwind chain.

00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:20.406 A:middle
It is not necessarily
the end destination

00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:23.106 A:middle
of the unwind segueway,
it is a direct child

00:39:23.106 --> 00:39:25.566 A:middle
of this custom container
that we're unwinding towards.

00:39:26.216 --> 00:39:30.946 A:middle
The did set observer for this
property, is going to take care

00:39:31.176 --> 00:39:34.036 A:middle
of updating my auto layout
constraints and performing

00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:35.716 A:middle
that sliding animation
we saw earlier.

00:39:35.716 --> 00:39:40.566 A:middle
Now that we have seen my custom
container view controllers'

00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:42.436 A:middle
implementation of
incremental unwinding,

00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:48.656 A:middle
let's see this unwind
segueway in action.

00:39:48.816 --> 00:39:50.086 A:middle
I'll tap on a cell.

00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:50.856 A:middle
Bring down the menu.

00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:53.696 A:middle
I tap on that journal button.

00:39:53.696 --> 00:39:54.926 A:middle
Now I'm going to
tap the done button.

00:39:55.696 --> 00:39:57.636 A:middle
You can see we have
switched tabs.

00:39:58.546 --> 00:40:00.166 A:middle
We have ended up at our
journal view controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.546 --> 00:40:00.166 A:middle
We have ended up at our
journal view controller

00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:03.156 A:middle
and inserted this new table
view cell for our journal entry.

00:40:03.636 --> 00:40:07.736 A:middle
As you can see, unwind segueways
have gotten a lot more powerful

00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:09.426 A:middle
in iOS 9 and they work great

00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:10.966 A:middle
with custom container
viewer controllers.

00:40:11.516 --> 00:40:18.166 A:middle
[Applause]

00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:21.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY RICCIARDI: So that
wraps up our unwinding demo.

00:40:21.466 --> 00:40:24.766 A:middle
Now let's head back over to Kyle
one last time to wrap this up.

00:40:26.376 --> 00:40:28.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KYLE SLUDER: Thank you, Tony.

00:40:28.376 --> 00:40:30.896 A:middle
So just a quick summary

00:40:30.896 --> 00:40:32.666 A:middle
of the new API we have
introduced for unwinding.

00:40:33.436 --> 00:40:35.046 A:middle
We have deprecated
viewer controller

00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:37.546 A:middle
for unwind segueway action
and we have replaced it

00:40:37.546 --> 00:40:39.106 A:middle
with allowed child
view controllers

00:40:39.106 --> 00:40:40.266 A:middle
from unwinding from source.

00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:42.406 A:middle
If you override the old method

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.896 A:middle
and don't override
the new method,

00:40:44.136 --> 00:40:46.896 A:middle
we will call the old
method even on iOS 9

00:40:46.896 --> 00:40:49.686 A:middle
so that your code behaves the
same if your app targets iOS 8

00:40:50.136 --> 00:40:51.466 A:middle
and it can also run on iOS 9.

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:54.536 A:middle
The implementation of
that override my want

00:40:54.536 --> 00:40:56.796 A:middle
to call the new allowed child
view containing controllers

00:40:56.796 --> 00:41:00.746 A:middle
for segueway source method so
that it can filter the array


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:56.796 --> 00:41:00.746 A:middle
for segueway source method so
that it can filter the array

00:41:00.746 --> 00:41:04.066 A:middle
of child view controllers
that it returns.

00:41:04.176 --> 00:41:06.726 A:middle
If you need some sort
of custom validation

00:41:06.726 --> 00:41:09.696 A:middle
for whether you can perform a
certain unwind you can override

00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:12.446 A:middle
the can perform unwind segueway
action method which has existed

00:41:12.446 --> 00:41:15.206 A:middle
for a while but by
default all it does is see

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.176 A:middle
if the receiver responds
to that selector.

00:41:17.826 --> 00:41:21.216 A:middle
Usually that's sufficient.

00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:23.556 A:middle
Likewise, we have
deprecated the segueway for --

00:41:23.556 --> 00:41:26.486 A:middle
segueway for unwinding
to view controller method

00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:30.016 A:middle
and replaced it with unwind
for segueway which is called

00:41:30.016 --> 00:41:31.606 A:middle
on each view controller
in the chain

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.396 A:middle
to implement incremental
unwinding.

00:41:36.676 --> 00:41:39.126 A:middle
Overall, today we learned how

00:41:39.126 --> 00:41:41.266 A:middle
to organize our storyboards
using references.

00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:45.276 A:middle
We learned how to customize our
segueways by subclassing them.

00:41:45.786 --> 00:41:47.446 A:middle
Even though we want to
get the standard behavior.

00:41:48.946 --> 00:41:52.996 A:middle
We learned that in iOS and iOS
9 specifically, present modally

00:41:52.996 --> 00:41:56.956 A:middle
and popover presentation
segueways will hang on to --

00:41:56.956 --> 00:41:59.196 A:middle
sorry -- the view
controllers that are presented

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:02.526 A:middle
by present modally and popover
presentation segueways will hang

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:02.526 A:middle
by present modally and popover
presentation segueways will hang

00:42:02.526 --> 00:42:05.316 A:middle
on to the segueway
objects that presented them

00:42:05.736 --> 00:42:07.026 A:middle
so that they can
act as delegates

00:42:07.026 --> 00:42:09.416 A:middle
for animation or for adaptivity.

00:42:09.816 --> 00:42:12.806 A:middle
We have learned how
unwind segueways work

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:15.366 A:middle
to get us backwards
through our application flow

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:18.416 A:middle
and that we can support them
easier in our custom containers

00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:21.426 A:middle
and remove our deprecated
APIs in order

00:42:21.426 --> 00:42:22.726 A:middle
to get the behavior in iOS 9.

00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:26.226 A:middle
If you need more
information on storyboards,

00:42:26.226 --> 00:42:28.486 A:middle
the storyboard help has
been rewritten in Xcode 7,

00:42:28.486 --> 00:42:30.016 A:middle
so you should check
that out first.

00:42:30.016 --> 00:42:33.766 A:middle
We also have a sample
project, segueway catalog,

00:42:34.746 --> 00:42:37.506 A:middle
which is available on
the developer website.

00:42:37.506 --> 00:42:39.866 A:middle
There actually isn't a space
in that name so if you search

00:42:39.866 --> 00:42:40.926 A:middle
for segueway in the
space catalog,

00:42:40.926 --> 00:42:43.486 A:middle
you find the wrong thing.

00:42:44.076 --> 00:42:46.766 A:middle
If you need technical support,
check out the dev forums.

00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:49.246 A:middle
There are a lot of developers
out there just like you,

00:42:49.246 --> 00:42:52.476 A:middle
facing the same problems you
have have been posting on there,

00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.436 A:middle
are able to help you
figure out your problems,

00:42:54.436 --> 00:42:57.166 A:middle
you can contact developer
technical support

00:42:57.236 --> 00:42:58.436 A:middle
or if you have general
inquiries,

00:42:58.496 --> 00:43:00.546 A:middle
contact Curt Rothert,
our evangelist.
