[ Applause ]

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:32.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SAL SOGHOIAN: Whoa, thank
you and welcome to Session 306,

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.016 A:middle
Supporting the Enterprise
with OS X Automation.

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.436 A:middle
I am Sal Soghoian.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:41.296 A:middle
I am the Product Manager
for Automation Technologies

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:45.506 A:middle
at Apple, and I'm
excited to be here today.

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:49.556 A:middle
Some days I feel like I'm a
dinosaur looking for a tar pit,

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.736 A:middle
but today is not
one of those days.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:56.056 A:middle
We're here to talk
about automation

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.636 A:middle
and how it can be used
in production situations,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.636 A:middle
and how it can be used
in production situations,

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:05.385 A:middle
how it can be used within your
organization to address some

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.206 A:middle
of the tasks and challenges
that often come up.

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:15.626 A:middle
And before we begin, I just want
to make it clear in our minds

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:21.756 A:middle
that when you talk about an
enterprise you're actually

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:23.586 A:middle
talking about people.

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:27.586 A:middle
People are what comprise
an enterprise

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.626 A:middle
and make it successful, they
are the people that come

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:32.856 A:middle
up with the creativity,
they are the ones

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.166 A:middle
that implement solutions,
they are the ones

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.536 A:middle
that create solutions.

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.426 A:middle
You are those kind of people.

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:42.186 A:middle
You look for a problem, and
you look for ways to solve it.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:46.836 A:middle
So throughout this talk today,
I'm always going to look

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:51.596 A:middle
at things from a people
perspective, so let's keep

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:55.706 A:middle
that in mind as we look at
the enterprise and automation.

00:01:56.686 --> 00:02:00.086 A:middle
And specifically when
you're creating a solution,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:56.686 --> 00:02:00.086 A:middle
And specifically when
you're creating a solution,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.226 A:middle
or I call them a workflow,
there's some strategies

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.186 A:middle
that could be useful to follow

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
when you're designing
a solution.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:11.886 A:middle
And the first is use
a variety of tools.

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.636 A:middle
It's interesting that
you have to mention this,

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.526 A:middle
but people often get locked
into a one-tool concept.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:24.946 A:middle
Don't solve everything with
a hammer because then all

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.146 A:middle
of the problems appear
to be nails.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.076 A:middle
Use the right tool for the job,

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:33.296 A:middle
don't try to drive a
nail with a wrench.

00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:38.786 A:middle
You know, use the right tool
that gives you the ability

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:40.996 A:middle
to accomplish what you
need to accomplish.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:48.736 A:middle
And, as well, make
your workflows modular

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:52.036 A:middle
so that you can take the
individual components

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:56.966 A:middle
of a workflow and adjust them or
connect them in different ways

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:59.476 A:middle
or use them in other
solutions as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:04.266 A:middle
So by keeping your workflow as
a modular design it's easier

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.756 A:middle
to find the points where
there are problems,

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:12.096 A:middle
and problems always appear when
you're trying to use a workflow

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.006 A:middle
in an enterprise solution.

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:18.016 A:middle
Look for the places that
are the bottlenecks,

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:20.286 A:middle
and they usually occur
around complexity

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:25.346 A:middle
or a heavy repetition, and you
want to identify those places

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:28.636 A:middle
and address them so that
your workflows run smooth.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.796 A:middle
And that's because
in the end all

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:36.166 A:middle
of our workflows
are run by people.

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:41.666 A:middle
And if your solution is
really complex and intricate,

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:45.256 A:middle
people aren't going to use it
or they won't like using it.

00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:50.566 A:middle
But if your workflow is designed
logically so that it flows

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.446 A:middle
and it's understandable,
then people are going

00:03:53.446 --> 00:03:56.066 A:middle
to love using it and
they'll use it all the time.

00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
So those are the basic workflow
strategies that we're going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
So those are the basic workflow
strategies that we're going

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:03.186 A:middle
to look at as I review
some examples

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.836 A:middle
of how you can use
automation in the enterprise,

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:09.546 A:middle
but there's one more concept I'd
like you to pay attention to,

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:12.966 A:middle
and it is to pursue inclusion.

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:18.416 A:middle
Now what I mean by that
is this: that the success

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:25.046 A:middle
of an organization depends upon
the strategy of and, not or.

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:30.936 A:middle
Many times people get locked
into the idea that's often used

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:34.856 A:middle
for hardware that one piece of
hardware has to go away in order

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:38.516 A:middle
for another piece of hardware to
take its place, and many times

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:42.806 A:middle
that is true, but when it
comes to providing solutions,

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.796 A:middle
inclusion is really important.

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:48.996 A:middle
You want to use all of the
tools that are available to you,

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:52.586 A:middle
and we have two platforms
at Apple

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.986 A:middle
that really personify
this power.

00:04:57.556 --> 00:05:03.586 A:middle
And they are OS X and iOS, and
they work really well together,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.556 --> 00:05:03.586 A:middle
And they are OS X and iOS, and
they work really well together,

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:07.676 A:middle
and it is through them working
together that you get success

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.126 A:middle
for your organization.

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:13.616 A:middle
When it comes to
being a good partner,

00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:17.746 A:middle
OS X is an incredible
operating system.

00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:22.436 A:middle
It is mature, it has a depth of
frameworks that is unrivaled,

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:25.426 A:middle
it has support for all
the different connective

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:28.486 A:middle
technologies that you
want to use in-house

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.086 A:middle
in your organization
to communicate

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:33.086 A:middle
and share data back and forth.

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:38.936 A:middle
And when it comes to
automation, OS X is unrivaled.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.566 A:middle
We have AppleScript, the
English-like language

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:45.676 A:middle
that you can use to control the
computer and the applications

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:49.306 A:middle
that run on it, and we've
extended AppleScript

00:05:49.586 --> 00:05:53.256 A:middle
with AppleScript/Objective-C,
that gives it a window

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:57.106 A:middle
into the Cocoa framework so
that you can directly talk

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:01.516 A:middle
to Cocoa classes and call Cocoa
methods from within AppleScript,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:01.516 A:middle
to Cocoa classes and call Cocoa
methods from within AppleScript,

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:04.136 A:middle
so that any of the
Cocoa frameworks

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:06.726 A:middle
that provide the power
for the OS and all

00:06:06.726 --> 00:06:09.746 A:middle
of its apps are available
to your script as well.

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:16.206 A:middle
And last OS, we introduced
JavaScript for Automation

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:20.206 A:middle
so that if you like working with
the JavaScript language or you

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:24.536 A:middle
like a more tight construct,
JavaScript for Automation --

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:28.676 A:middle
or JXA as we call it -- provides
you all of the abilities

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:31.366 A:middle
to control applications
as similar

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:35.006 A:middle
to the way AppleScript does and
it also provides you the window

00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:37.066 A:middle
into the Cocoa frameworks,
as well.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:41.516 A:middle
So if you like using JavaScript,
you can still accomplish all

00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:44.106 A:middle
of the kind of automations
you want to do using

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:45.766 A:middle
that as your native language.

00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:50.166 A:middle
And another tool that we
have is Otto the Automator.

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:57.026 A:middle
Automator is a visual tool for
building automation recipes,

00:06:57.806 --> 00:06:59.496 A:middle
through a drag-and-drop process

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:02.246 A:middle
where you take the individual
steps that are required


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:02.246 A:middle
where you take the individual
steps that are required

00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:05.596 A:middle
to accomplish something and
you drag them into a file

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:07.256 A:middle
and save them as a workflow.

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:11.316 A:middle
It's incredibly powerful,
it works with any language

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:13.896 A:middle
or ability that's part
of the operating system,

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:17.016 A:middle
and it handles data translation
for you automatically.

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:19.336 A:middle
We're going to see
this quite a bit today

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.046 A:middle
as we go over some examples.

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:25.436 A:middle
And, finally, because
of its heritage

00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:30.946 A:middle
and its power OS X has all of
the UNIX toolset we've come

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
to rely upon, including all of
the different shelves and some

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:38.026 A:middle
of your favorite languages, like
Pearl, Ruby, and Python as well.

00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:41.266 A:middle
So combined, it's a
holistic approach.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
This is a very powerful set

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:47.046 A:middle
of automation tools
for you to rely upon.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:53.446 A:middle
And today we're going to see
how automation can give you the

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:56.796 A:middle
speed, the accuracy,
the consistent output,

00:07:57.306 --> 00:07:59.426 A:middle
and the scalability
that you need

00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:01.486 A:middle
when you're dealing
with solutions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:01.486 A:middle
when you're dealing
with solutions.

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:05.496 A:middle
So let's take a look at
three example scenarios.

00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:06.966 A:middle
I'm going to keep them simple

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:10.906 A:middle
so that we can examine the
principle behind them rather

00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:12.746 A:middle
than get lost in any complexity.

00:08:13.046 --> 00:08:14.746 A:middle
See, I'm being people-oriented
here.

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:17.026 A:middle
The first scenario
we're going to look

00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:21.906 A:middle
at is how you can create a
workgroup image repository,

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:25.296 A:middle
and by that I mean we can
have a central computer

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:30.536 A:middle
that is accessible by 40 or 50
people in a local network area

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:35.525 A:middle
by both computers and
wireless devices as well,

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:39.936 A:middle
and how we can use automation
and the technologies of OS X

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.405 A:middle
to make that possible.

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:45.976 A:middle
The second scenario we're
going to look at a basic thing

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:49.266 A:middle
that faces everyone who
works in an organization,

00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:52.186 A:middle
and that's creating
documents on time.

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:55.636 A:middle
You know, everybody has
challenges of gathering data,

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:59.186 A:middle
and putting it together, and
formatting it, and presenting it

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
in interesting ways,
and so we can look


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:02.146 A:middle
in interesting ways,
and so we can look

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:04.666 A:middle
at how automation can
be used to solve some

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:06.186 A:middle
of those issues as well.

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:08.386 A:middle
And, finally, we're
going to look

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
at a third example that's new,

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:17.926 A:middle
where you can use the automation
technologies in OS X to set up

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:21.386 A:middle
and manage iOS devices
automatically.

00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.586 A:middle
So this is going to be an
interesting category for us

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
because it's a new one as well.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:30.156 A:middle
So let's begin with a workgroup
image repository scenario.

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:33.516 A:middle
Now remember I'm talking
about setting up a computer

00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:35.906 A:middle
that is an image
repository, and we're going

00:09:35.906 --> 00:09:40.556 A:middle
to be specifically using
the new photos architecture

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:43.736 A:middle
and frameworks and application
that are part of OS X.

00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:46.426 A:middle
And we're going to set
it up on a computer,

00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:50.356 A:middle
and this computer is going
to exist in an environment

00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:55.096 A:middle
where you have other
laptops and desktop computers

00:09:55.646 --> 00:09:57.446 A:middle
that might be running Mac OS X

00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:01.276 A:middle
or it could even be running
Windows, as well as being


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:01.276 A:middle
or it could even be running
Windows, as well as being

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:03.646 A:middle
in an environment that
has mobile devices,

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:06.676 A:middle
whether it's the new MacBook
that we just introduced

00:10:07.036 --> 00:10:10.726 A:middle
or it's our great iOS devices,
like iPads and iPhones.

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:16.096 A:middle
And to accomplish this workgroup
concept, we're going to rely

00:10:16.096 --> 00:10:18.966 A:middle
on three OS X technologies.

00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.096 A:middle
The first we're going
to use is File Sharing.

00:10:22.026 --> 00:10:26.736 A:middle
Now File Sharing is part of
OS X basic core structure,

00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:29.946 A:middle
and it allows you to
set up share points

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:34.046 A:middle
so that other computers
can easily transfer files

00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:35.476 A:middle
over to your computer.

00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:39.046 A:middle
It's been around forever,
it's based on SMB and AFP,

00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:43.156 A:middle
it's very reliable, it's
an established technology.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:47.866 A:middle
The second technology we're
going to look at is AirDrop,

00:10:49.046 --> 00:10:52.216 A:middle
and AirDrop is a
newer technology

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:54.356 A:middle
that combines Bluetooth
with Wi-Fi

00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:58.996 A:middle
so that mobile devices
can easily recognize

00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:01.916 A:middle
and transfer files
to a computer.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:01.916 A:middle
and transfer files
to a computer.

00:11:02.546 --> 00:11:05.106 A:middle
And we're going to use
both of those technologies

00:11:05.446 --> 00:11:09.256 A:middle
when we address this task.

00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:12.846 A:middle
Now you'll notice that in
this connective scenario

00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:15.616 A:middle
that we have here, where
we have the computers

00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:20.526 A:middle
and the iOS devices, there's one
area that still needs some work

00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:22.936 A:middle
in order for all of this
to become automated.

00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:28.896 A:middle
And it is the transferal of the
copied documents or the images

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.726 A:middle
that have been provided
from other sources

00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:34.586 A:middle
into the actual media
library itself.

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.036 A:middle
And to solve that
problem we're going

00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:41.286 A:middle
to use a technology
called Folder Actions

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.566 A:middle
through Automator.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:46.056 A:middle
Now many of you might not
know about Folder Actions,

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:50.366 A:middle
but a Folder Action is a
system service that allows you

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:55.696 A:middle
to assign a workflow to a folder
so that when items are placed

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:59.846 A:middle
into that folder, the system
automatically provides them

00:11:59.846 --> 00:12:04.176 A:middle
as input to a workflow that it
executes for you automatically.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.846 --> 00:12:04.176 A:middle
as input to a workflow that it
executes for you automatically.

00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:07.906 A:middle
And Folder Actions
have been part of OS X

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:12.376 A:middle
since before it was OS X,
we've had them since System 8.5

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:15.816 A:middle
and they're very powerful, and
we've done a lot of work on it

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:17.936 A:middle
with the new release
and I think you're going

00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:19.436 A:middle
to really enjoy using them.

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:24.466 A:middle
So let me show you how easy it
is to create a Folder Action.

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:28.836 A:middle
For this we're going to need,
for our scenario we're going

00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:30.406 A:middle
to need two different
Folder Actions,

00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:35.466 A:middle
one for the Dropbox folder
for the file sharing and one

00:12:35.466 --> 00:12:38.786 A:middle
for the Downloads folder
that is the recipient

00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:40.616 A:middle
of the AirDrop files.

00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:43.646 A:middle
And to do that I'm going
to open up Automator,

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.576 A:middle
I'm going to create
a new document,

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:48.616 A:middle
and from the template I'm
going to choose Folder Action

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:51.146 A:middle
as the type of Automator file.

00:12:53.276 --> 00:12:56.786 A:middle
And at the top we're
going to select a folder

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:59.846 A:middle
that is the source
folder for the workflow.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:06.226 A:middle
So we'll select that,
and I'll navigate

00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:10.816 A:middle
over to the Public
folder and then

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:12.136 A:middle
within the Public
folder we're going

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:16.196 A:middle
to select the Dropbox
folder as the source folder.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:19.706 A:middle
So any items placed into
the Dropbox are going

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:21.666 A:middle
to become the input
for this workflow.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:24.816 A:middle
Now we need to perform
some series of actions

00:13:24.896 --> 00:13:28.576 A:middle
on those added files,
and to do that I'm going

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:33.726 A:middle
to select the Photos category
over here and I'm going to drag

00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:38.436 A:middle
in the Automator action for
importing items into Photos.

00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:42.166 A:middle
And I'm running a little
bit of a lag -- there we go.

00:13:42.946 --> 00:13:44.916 A:middle
And so once you've
added an action

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:47.726 A:middle
to the workflow you
see its action view.

00:13:48.006 --> 00:13:50.486 A:middle
The action view contains
all of the controls

00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:52.876 A:middle
for the various parameters
for that action.

00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:56.286 A:middle
So we're going to set some basic
parameters for that action,

00:13:57.216 --> 00:13:59.856 A:middle
and then it's just a matter
of saving the workflow

00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:07.346 A:middle
and giving it a name, like
Import from Dropbox, very good.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:07.346 A:middle
and giving it a name, like
Import from Dropbox, very good.

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:11.776 A:middle
And once it's been saved
it's automatically installed

00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:14.246 A:middle
into the operating
system and active.

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.876 A:middle
We'll create a second workflow
just like the first one,

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.886 A:middle
the only difference is its
source folder will be the

00:14:20.886 --> 00:14:21.856 A:middle
Downloads folder.

00:14:22.306 --> 00:14:26.166 A:middle
So that's how easy it is
to create a Folder Action

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:29.696 A:middle
that can receive files
from network devices.

00:14:30.156 --> 00:14:33.956 A:middle
Once that's been done, then
any files that are placed

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.666 A:middle
into these connected
folders will get transferred

00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:39.236 A:middle
automatically into
our image repository.

00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:41.976 A:middle
So let's take a people
perspective

00:14:41.976 --> 00:14:43.696 A:middle
and see how this looks

00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:47.066 A:middle
to a person using this
from, like, the Mac side.

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:50.906 A:middle
So if you're running
this from the Mac side,

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:53.886 A:middle
you have a Finder
window and to connect

00:14:53.886 --> 00:14:58.146 A:middle
to the repository shared folder
is just a matter of going

00:14:58.146 --> 00:15:01.466 A:middle
to the Finder sidebar
and connecting that,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.146 --> 00:15:01.466 A:middle
to the Finder sidebar
and connecting that,

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:06.596 A:middle
selecting the Public folder
there, and then dragging

00:15:06.596 --> 00:15:11.926 A:middle
in whatever images you have
onto the Dropbox itself.

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:18.976 A:middle
The computer is running a
little slow today, there we go,

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:20.566 A:middle
you can see all the builds.

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:23.976 A:middle
And once you do that you'll
get a notification dialogue

00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:27.186 A:middle
that tells you you're
about to copy some files

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.236 A:middle
and you won't be able to
see them -- is that okay?

00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:31.146 A:middle
You approve that
and the files --

00:15:31.146 --> 00:15:34.296 A:middle
the two computers are
automatically connected,

00:15:34.646 --> 00:15:37.596 A:middle
and the file gets transferred
over into the other folder.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:41.476 A:middle
The Automator workflow
gets executed,

00:15:41.476 --> 00:15:45.246 A:middle
and the copied image gets
added to our image repository.

00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:48.126 A:middle
So this is how it looks
when you're running this

00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:50.806 A:middle
from the OS X side of
things through file sharing.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:54.206 A:middle
Now let's examine the same
process, but this time

00:15:54.206 --> 00:15:57.046 A:middle
from the viewpoint of
using a mobile device.

00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:02.856 A:middle
So with your mobile device you
connect it, you turn it on,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:02.856 A:middle
So with your mobile device you
connect it, you turn it on,

00:16:02.856 --> 00:16:05.426 A:middle
you find the image that you
want from your mobile device,

00:16:05.426 --> 00:16:08.636 A:middle
you click, you tap
the Share button.

00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:17.456 A:middle
You wait for the destination
to become visible as a network,

00:16:18.296 --> 00:16:21.356 A:middle
as an AirDrop target,
you select the AirDrop

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
and then the connection is made
and the image is transferred

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:28.406 A:middle
over to the computer, and then
the Folder Action is triggered

00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:30.356 A:middle
and the image is copied into it.

00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:34.386 A:middle
So from a person's
perspective you can see

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:38.116 A:middle
that this becomes a very
easy-to-use operation.

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:43.356 A:middle
This strategy incorporates
basic technologies that are part

00:16:43.356 --> 00:16:46.886 A:middle
of OS X and File Sharing
and AirDrop as well

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:50.646 A:middle
as Folder Actions, and it works
with a variety of devices,

00:16:50.806 --> 00:16:55.386 A:middle
including computers, Mac
computers, Windows computers,

00:16:55.486 --> 00:16:57.146 A:middle
and mobile devices as well.

00:16:57.706 --> 00:17:00.436 A:middle
Now I know you're asking,
well, okay, Sal, wait a second,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.706 --> 00:17:00.436 A:middle
Now I know you're asking,
well, okay, Sal, wait a second,

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:04.915 A:middle
so when I send an AirDrop
over, there's a notification

00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:07.846 A:middle
that happens, what
happens if there's nobody

00:17:07.846 --> 00:17:10.256 A:middle
at the computer,
what do you do then?

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:11.896 A:middle
Well, here's another case

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:14.636 A:middle
where automation can
solve a problem for you.

00:17:14.996 --> 00:17:19.306 A:middle
You can use the Auto
Accept AppleScript droplet

00:17:19.546 --> 00:17:22.786 A:middle
that whenever a notification
is set,

00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:25.636 A:middle
it will automatically accept
it and continue the process

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:27.586 A:middle
of allowing the image
to be transferred

00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:29.986 A:middle
over to the media library.

00:17:31.396 --> 00:17:34.916 A:middle
All of this is available, you
can download the beta version

00:17:34.916 --> 00:17:37.936 A:middle
of the photos actions
that you saw here

00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:40.416 A:middle
and you can follow the
instructions on this

00:17:40.416 --> 00:17:42.536 A:middle
and as well get the
Auto Accept droplet

00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:46.466 A:middle
from this location,
photosautomation.com.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.226 A:middle
Okay, so that's our
first scenario

00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:55.456 A:middle
of using automation technologies
in a mixed-use environment

00:17:55.856 --> 00:17:58.886 A:middle
to be able to solve
some problems.

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.846 A:middle
The next scenario
we're going to look


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.846 A:middle
The next scenario
we're going to look

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:03.606 A:middle
at is how we can automate
document construction.

00:18:04.396 --> 00:18:07.906 A:middle
Now the thing about using
the automation technologies

00:18:07.906 --> 00:18:14.366 A:middle
in OS X is that they're very
powerful and they act as you,

00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:17.686 A:middle
they act on your behalf
with all the authority

00:18:17.686 --> 00:18:19.426 A:middle
that you have as a user.

00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:23.966 A:middle
So you can do all the things

00:18:23.966 --> 00:18:26.466 A:middle
that you normally do
through automation.

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:30.476 A:middle
You can command and control
applications, you can copy data

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:34.356 A:middle
from one place to another, you
can create and delete files,

00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:37.046 A:middle
you can mount volumes,
you can unmounts volumes,

00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:40.366 A:middle
pretty much anything that
you can do as a user,

00:18:40.366 --> 00:18:43.326 A:middle
automation can do
on your behalf.

00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:47.246 A:middle
And this is incredibly powerful
because when you combine

00:18:47.246 --> 00:18:50.516 A:middle
that with the fact that we
have some great scriptable

00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:55.026 A:middle
applications on OS X, then you
can really accomplish a lot

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:58.266 A:middle
and create very inventive,
useful solutions.

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.716 A:middle
So here's a simple example.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.716 A:middle
So here's a simple example.

00:19:01.196 --> 00:19:04.656 A:middle
Let's say as part of
your daily or as part

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:07.206 A:middle
of your job assignment,
I'll put it that way,

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:10.696 A:middle
every Thursday you
have to gather the data

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.526 A:middle
about your company's
sales, you have to put it

00:19:14.526 --> 00:19:17.126 A:middle
into a presentation
that you deliver

00:19:17.126 --> 00:19:20.626 A:middle
to your teammates
every Thursday.

00:19:21.196 --> 00:19:23.906 A:middle
And this usually takes quite a
while to do because you've got

00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:27.056 A:middle
to go gather the data, then
you have to transform it

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:31.546 A:middle
from one shape of being
spreadsheet into being a chart,

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.616 A:middle
then you have to build
the presentation.

00:19:34.246 --> 00:19:37.356 A:middle
So here's an example of
how you can use automation

00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:39.286 A:middle
to automate that process.

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:44.076 A:middle
Using Automator, you can
create a workflow for yourself

00:19:44.076 --> 00:19:47.786 A:middle
that will automatically build
a presentation that grabs data

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:51.946 A:middle
out of other files, transforms
it into the things you need,

00:19:52.136 --> 00:19:55.446 A:middle
and then triggers the sending
of it to your iOS device,

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:59.416 A:middle
so that all you have to do
is just accept the transfer

00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:01.676 A:middle
from the computer and then


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:01.676 A:middle
from the computer and then

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:07.136 A:middle
within a couple seconds you have
the presentation ready to go

00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:10.376 A:middle
that you can take
with you when you have

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:12.466 A:middle
to do your presentation
with your team.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
So this is a simple
example of the power

00:20:16.876 --> 00:20:18.256 A:middle
of creating a document.

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:20.916 A:middle
So let me show you that, I'm
going to create a workflow

00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:22.926 A:middle
that does just what we just saw.

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:30.296 A:middle
And this is my desktop
that is the Martian sunset,

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:34.156 A:middle
NASA just released this photo,
it's totally incredible,

00:20:34.156 --> 00:20:36.666 A:middle
it just really makes
you feel small

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:38.046 A:middle
in the universe when
I look at that.

00:20:38.686 --> 00:20:41.396 A:middle
Okay, so I'm going
to create a workflow

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:45.036 A:middle
that generates a presentation
and incorporates data

00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:50.636 A:middle
from a spreadsheet and then
sends it to my mobile device

00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:52.876 A:middle
that I have over
here via AirDrop.

00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:57.006 A:middle
So I'm going to launch
Automator, and I'm going

00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:01.086 A:middle
to create a new document,
and let me just zoom this


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:01.086 A:middle
to create a new document,
and let me just zoom this

00:21:01.086 --> 00:21:02.656 A:middle
so that we can see together.

00:21:02.806 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
How is that?

00:21:03.556 --> 00:21:04.496 A:middle
Much better isn't it?

00:21:04.886 --> 00:21:06.406 A:middle
So when you launch Automator,

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:09.106 A:middle
you'll see that there's
a template picker here.

00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:12.126 A:middle
For our purposes we're just
going to use a workflow

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:15.026 A:middle
that I save into this
system-wide script menu

00:21:15.296 --> 00:21:17.296 A:middle
so that it's always
available for me.

00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:18.876 A:middle
So I'll click Choose.

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:22.516 A:middle
Over on the left-hand
side is the library

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:26.046 A:middle
of Automator actions, those
are those individual nuggets

00:21:26.046 --> 00:21:28.516 A:middle
of functionality that
you combine together

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:30.556 A:middle
to make an automation recipe.

00:21:30.926 --> 00:21:34.086 A:middle
And you can view them by
category, as it shows here,

00:21:34.416 --> 00:21:37.026 A:middle
or you can even arrange
them by application.

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:39.446 A:middle
I'm going to choose
application and then go

00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:42.896 A:middle
to the Keynote application
and click on that.

00:21:43.096 --> 00:21:45.776 A:middle
When I click on it, you can
see all the actions related

00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:47.726 A:middle
to Keynote are available
over here

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:51.506 A:middle
and whatever action I have
selected has a description

00:21:51.506 --> 00:21:52.956 A:middle
that appears here at the bottom

00:21:53.106 --> 00:21:55.176 A:middle
that gives me information
on how to use it.

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:56.966 A:middle
So let me create a workflow.

00:21:56.966 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
The first thing I'm going
to do is add an action


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.966 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
The first thing I'm going
to do is add an action

00:22:00.146 --> 00:22:02.566 A:middle
to the workflow area
by dragging in here

00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:04.666 A:middle
for creating a new presentation.

00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:08.146 A:middle
You can see that the action
view has various controls

00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:10.276 A:middle
and parameters for
deciding what kind

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:12.146 A:middle
of presentation I
want to create.

00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:13.996 A:middle
I'm going to choose a gradient.

00:22:14.296 --> 00:22:16.656 A:middle
I'm going to choose its
dimensions to be set

00:22:16.656 --> 00:22:21.866 A:middle
for a mobile device, and I'll
just basically leave it at that.

00:22:22.346 --> 00:22:26.046 A:middle
So my first action is to
create the presentation.

00:22:26.506 --> 00:22:29.616 A:middle
Now when you create a default
presentation in Keynote,

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:33.206 A:middle
it gives you one slide
that is title and subtitle.

00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:37.306 A:middle
So the next step I want to
do is to set the contents

00:22:37.306 --> 00:22:38.856 A:middle
of the title and subtitle.

00:22:39.186 --> 00:22:43.426 A:middle
To do that I'm going to use
an action called Set Contents

00:22:43.426 --> 00:22:44.836 A:middle
of Default Text Items.

00:22:45.056 --> 00:22:46.066 A:middle
I drag it in.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:48.466 A:middle
You notice that there's
a connection made

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:52.266 A:middle
so that a reference to the
new presentation is passed

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:53.116 A:middle
to this action.

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:56.176 A:middle
It then knows which
presentation to work with.

00:22:56.596 --> 00:22:58.416 A:middle
I'm going to set it
so that the title

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:03.686 A:middle
of the presentation will
be Sales Report, like this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:03.686 A:middle
of the presentation will
be Sales Report, like this.

00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:07.476 A:middle
And then for the subtitle
I want the current date.

00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:11.506 A:middle
And since I want this to be a
workflow that I can use over

00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:14.826 A:middle
and over again, I'm going
to use an Automator variable

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:17.506 A:middle
to dynamically generate
the date for me.

00:23:18.136 --> 00:23:21.496 A:middle
Over here on the library I'll
click the Variables category,

00:23:22.056 --> 00:23:26.026 A:middle
and variables are containers
of data, they can either be

00:23:26.026 --> 00:23:29.046 A:middle
from storing it or
dynamically generated.

00:23:29.386 --> 00:23:31.896 A:middle
So I'll click Date
and Time and then drag

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:36.246 A:middle
in today's date variable into
the body field over here.

00:23:37.266 --> 00:23:40.716 A:middle
Now you'll notice that it
automatically gets added

00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:42.846 A:middle
into a list of variables
currently used

00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:44.356 A:middle
by the document at the bottom.

00:23:44.416 --> 00:23:48.256 A:middle
I can set the parameters for how
the variable is going to appear

00:23:48.256 --> 00:23:51.796 A:middle
by clicking Edit and then
choosing a format that I'd like,

00:23:51.796 --> 00:23:56.066 A:middle
like this one where I have full
month, date, and then the year.

00:23:56.756 --> 00:24:02.876 A:middle
So my second slide, my second
task, the second action has been


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:56.756 --> 00:24:02.876 A:middle
So my second slide, my second
task, the second action has been

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:07.846 A:middle
to name the presentation
and provide a subtitle.

00:24:08.476 --> 00:24:12.336 A:middle
The next step is to apply a
transition for that slide.

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:17.516 A:middle
So I'll go back to my actions
and I'll go drag in the action

00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.926 A:middle
for setting transition.

00:24:19.386 --> 00:24:23.196 A:middle
From that I'm going to choose
-- let's do a basic dissolve.

00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:26.626 A:middle
I'll set it for about a
second and a half on click.

00:24:27.046 --> 00:24:28.686 A:middle
All right, now that
we've done that,

00:24:28.726 --> 00:24:31.036 A:middle
I'll need to create a
new slide that I'm going

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.586 A:middle
to add my sales data to.

00:24:33.966 --> 00:24:37.526 A:middle
And for this slide, I'm going
to create one that has a title

00:24:37.526 --> 00:24:41.016 A:middle
at the top and I'm going to add
it to the end of the slides.

00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:44.946 A:middle
So I have a new presentation,
I've titled it, subtitled it,

00:24:45.416 --> 00:24:48.756 A:middle
created a transition for the
first slide, added a new slide.

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:52.486 A:middle
Now I'm ready to add the
data that I want to have

00:24:52.876 --> 00:24:58.106 A:middle
in my presentation, but this
data lives in another file.

00:24:58.106 --> 00:25:02.936 A:middle
I have a numbers spreadsheet
here that contains the data


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.106 --> 00:25:02.936 A:middle
I have a numbers spreadsheet
here that contains the data

00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:06.436 A:middle
that I want to bring
into my presentation.

00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:08.436 A:middle
So I'm going to close that

00:25:08.436 --> 00:25:11.386 A:middle
and use an action
here called Add Chart

00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:15.606 A:middle
with Numbers Table Data,
drag it into my workflow,

00:25:15.886 --> 00:25:19.576 A:middle
and you can see that the action
view has two areas for settings,

00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:22.396 A:middle
the Data Settings and
the Chart Settings.

00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:25.936 A:middle
So we're going to pick the
file that I want to use,

00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:29.526 A:middle
it will be in my Documents
folder, and here it is,

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:33.796 A:middle
ACME Widget Domestic Sales --
bring that over a little bit,

00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:36.866 A:middle
like that -- and then I
can choose to identify

00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:38.716 A:middle
which table in that document.

00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:42.096 A:middle
I can use the active table, a
selection of the active table,

00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:45.656 A:middle
I can use the first table
that's on the active sheet,

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:49.376 A:middle
or I can even enter a name
for the table and it will find

00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:50.726 A:middle
that table in the document.

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:53.206 A:middle
I'm going to use first
table of active sheet,

00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:56.876 A:middle
and I want to use the table
title for the slide title.

00:25:57.436 --> 00:25:58.886 A:middle
Now when it comes to a chart,

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:01.706 A:middle
I'm going to pick something
very standard like a 2D,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:01.706 A:middle
I'm going to pick something
very standard like a 2D,

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.536 A:middle
I'm going to group it by
column data like this.

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:08.286 A:middle
So now I've created a
presentation, I've titled it,

00:26:08.286 --> 00:26:11.346 A:middle
subtitled it, applied a
transition, added a new slide,

00:26:11.566 --> 00:26:15.296 A:middle
imported data from a file,
formatted into a chart,

00:26:15.296 --> 00:26:17.006 A:middle
added that chart to a slide.

00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:23.086 A:middle
The next step is I will save
this document using a Save

00:26:23.086 --> 00:26:25.636 A:middle
Document action, I'm going
to save it to a folder,

00:26:26.216 --> 00:26:28.506 A:middle
and I'm going to save it
to my Documents folder.

00:26:28.756 --> 00:26:31.506 A:middle
And for its name I'm going
to call it Sales Report,

00:26:32.196 --> 00:26:35.926 A:middle
and then I want the file
name to have the same name

00:26:35.926 --> 00:26:39.246 A:middle
as the variable, so I'll
drag the variable from here

00:26:39.246 --> 00:26:43.756 A:middle
up into this field, so now the
file will be named Sales Report

00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:49.396 A:middle
and the current date.key and
replace any existing file.

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:56.196 A:middle
And then, finally, I have over
here my little iPad ready to go,

00:26:56.406 --> 00:27:00.176 A:middle
and I have it set up with
AirDrop, so let's make it easy


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.406 --> 00:27:00.176 A:middle
and I have it set up with
AirDrop, so let's make it easy

00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:02.716 A:middle
to get that file over here.

00:27:03.526 --> 00:27:08.646 A:middle
I'm going to go begin AirDrop
with disk items, and I'll extend

00:27:08.646 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
out the AirDrop for a
couple seconds extra just

00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:13.376 A:middle
in case we need it.

00:27:13.376 --> 00:27:15.856 A:middle
And what this will do is
at the end of the workflow,

00:27:15.856 --> 00:27:17.416 A:middle
it will take the
file that's created

00:27:17.416 --> 00:27:20.446 A:middle
and automatically begin an
AirDrop so that I can see it

00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:22.656 A:middle
over on my iPad and
receive it there.

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:26.786 A:middle
So I would save this,
I would place this

00:27:26.786 --> 00:27:31.116 A:middle
into the Scripts folder,
I would find a location

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:32.166 A:middle
that I like to keep it.

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:35.416 A:middle
And then once it's saved, it
becomes part of your script

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:37.206 A:middle
and you can choose
it at any time.

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:42.426 A:middle
I'll run the workflow so that
you can see it run in action,

00:27:42.866 --> 00:27:46.416 A:middle
right from here, let me
zoom back out a little bit.

00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:52.566 A:middle
And I will run this workflow, it
will generate the sales report,

00:27:53.216 --> 00:27:56.856 A:middle
grab the data, bring it in,
and begin the AirDrop session,

00:27:57.576 --> 00:28:02.736 A:middle
and there's the Woodbury School,
so now I'll click over to three.

00:27:57.576 --> 00:28:02.736 A:middle
and there's the Woodbury School,
so now I'll click over to three.

00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:07.936 A:middle
You can see, yes, you can see
here I'm going to accept this,

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:11.296 A:middle
and it's going to copy
it right into Keynote.

00:28:12.026 --> 00:28:16.166 A:middle
I can bring it in, I can do
editing because the power

00:28:16.166 --> 00:28:18.926 A:middle
of iWork I can make it a
little bit more colorful.

00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:21.886 A:middle
And then I actually have
my presentation here

00:28:22.736 --> 00:28:26.486 A:middle
and I can begin delivering --
it's going to give me some tips,

00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:30.226 A:middle
and get to the next
presentation.

00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:38.096 A:middle
So there's an example of how you
can create a workflow using the

00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:42.736 A:middle
power of OS X -- let's
go back to one --

00:28:44.116 --> 00:28:47.256 A:middle
so here's how you can create
a workflow using the power

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:51.806 A:middle
of the automation technologies
in OS X to make the process

00:28:51.806 --> 00:28:56.546 A:middle
of creating a chart and
a presentation as simple

00:28:56.546 --> 00:28:59.936 A:middle
as just going to a menu and
selecting that option for you.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.786 --> 00:29:02.896 A:middle
Okay, so let's go
back to slides here.

00:29:03.486 --> 00:29:05.106 A:middle
[Applause] Oh, thank you.

00:29:05.506 --> 00:29:11.686 A:middle
So how do we get
back over there?

00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:13.426 A:middle
You guys do that, magic.

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:15.736 A:middle
Isn't it interesting?

00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:17.396 A:middle
I'll bet you most of
you didn't realize

00:29:17.396 --> 00:29:19.446 A:middle
that stuff was actually
in the OS, huh?

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:25.586 A:middle
Right? Okay, so this
example uses all

00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:29.576 A:middle
of our automation technologies
that you have available to you.

00:29:29.746 --> 00:29:32.666 A:middle
And remember, they act
on your behalf with all

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:36.856 A:middle
of your authority, so you're
not limited by what you can do.

00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:39.856 A:middle
You don't need a specific
app for each step of it,

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:41.806 A:middle
all you need is the
functionality

00:29:41.806 --> 00:29:44.666 A:middle
that can be exposed to
you through Automator.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.926 A:middle
And you have some great apps
to work with, like iWork

00:29:47.926 --> 00:29:50.406 A:middle
and Photos, the Finder
and FileMaker Pro,

00:29:50.586 --> 00:29:52.676 A:middle
you can create incredible
solutions.

00:29:54.136 --> 00:29:57.406 A:middle
And this example with
the Automator actions

00:29:57.476 --> 00:30:00.566 A:middle
and the whole complete
examples available for you today

00:29:57.476 --> 00:30:00.566 A:middle
and the whole complete
examples available for you today

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:02.976 A:middle
at iworkautomation.com.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:05.726 A:middle
It's a website that
contains individual websites

00:30:05.726 --> 00:30:08.766 A:middle
about pages, numbers,
and Keynote.

00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:12.096 A:middle
I think you'll find it
useful in an informative way.

00:30:13.506 --> 00:30:16.436 A:middle
Okay, so that's Automating
Document Construction.

00:30:17.066 --> 00:30:20.036 A:middle
And for our last example we're
going to try something new,

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:22.356 A:middle
this will be the first
time I'm demoing this,

00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:24.616 A:middle
it's the first time
anybody has seen this,

00:30:24.996 --> 00:30:26.806 A:middle
and you guys are the ones
that are going to see it.

00:30:27.186 --> 00:30:30.446 A:middle
We're going to talk about
setting up iOS devices.

00:30:31.116 --> 00:30:33.296 A:middle
Now there could be no doubt

00:30:33.576 --> 00:30:37.386 A:middle
that Apple makes the
most incredibly powerful

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:41.906 A:middle
and sophisticated and elegant
mobile devices there are.

00:30:42.346 --> 00:30:46.386 A:middle
They are wonderful tools for the
enterprise, they're attractive,

00:30:46.846 --> 00:30:49.926 A:middle
they're powerful,
they're easy to use.

00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:52.076 A:middle
And with our partnership now

00:30:52.076 --> 00:30:57.906 A:middle
with IBM we are creating
best-of-class applications

00:30:57.906 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
for data deployment to put the
power of the enterprise right


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.906 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
for data deployment to put the
power of the enterprise right

00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:05.786 A:middle
at your staff's hands
and fingers.

00:31:06.196 --> 00:31:09.366 A:middle
And it's really incredible
what the tools

00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:12.276 A:middle
that are being produced
through this collaboration.

00:31:14.346 --> 00:31:19.446 A:middle
And we really are happy with
what is being developed,

00:31:19.886 --> 00:31:22.986 A:middle
but let's talk about for a
second, not data deployment,

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:24.886 A:middle
but device deployment.

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.646 A:middle
So when it comes to
device deployment,

00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:30.206 A:middle
there's usually two
strategies that you follow.

00:31:30.606 --> 00:31:32.846 A:middle
The first is called One to One,

00:31:33.256 --> 00:31:36.706 A:middle
and in One to One you
have a group of employees

00:31:36.796 --> 00:31:39.106 A:middle
that are given a mobile device

00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:42.676 A:middle
that is profiled
specifically for them.

00:31:43.176 --> 00:31:46.946 A:middle
It contains information about
them, it is targeted to them,

00:31:47.246 --> 00:31:50.426 A:middle
so that no matter where they
move within your organization

00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:57.096 A:middle
or within geographic location
that device stays with them.

00:31:58.066 --> 00:31:59.886 A:middle
Now the second strategy

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:03.436 A:middle
for device deployment
is called Shared Use,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:03.436 A:middle
for device deployment
is called Shared Use,

00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:06.906 A:middle
and in this scenario you
have a set of devices

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:10.436 A:middle
that are configured
generically for your company

00:32:10.526 --> 00:32:15.056 A:middle
as the identifier, and then your
staff uses those as they need

00:32:15.326 --> 00:32:18.626 A:middle
and then passes them to
other members of your staff

00:32:18.626 --> 00:32:21.846 A:middle
who will use them and then
pass them to other members

00:32:21.846 --> 00:32:24.546 A:middle
of your staff that gets
to use them as well.

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:29.026 A:middle
So shared use, you have a
limited number of mobile devices

00:32:29.346 --> 00:32:31.856 A:middle
that get used by a
large variety of people,

00:32:32.336 --> 00:32:36.166 A:middle
as compared to a
one-to-one scenario

00:32:36.266 --> 00:32:39.426 A:middle
where every employee gets
their own mobile device.

00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:42.706 A:middle
Now in shared use,
a couple scenarios

00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:45.446 A:middle
that quite often
happen with shared use,

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:50.116 A:middle
are you'll see them used in
professional organizations,

00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:53.796 A:middle
you'll see them used in
service organizations,

00:32:54.296 --> 00:32:58.796 A:middle
and you'll also see them
used in classrooms as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.486 --> 00:33:04.196 A:middle
Many classrooms use a limited
number of mobile devices

00:33:04.246 --> 00:33:07.426 A:middle
that they format and set
up for different classes

00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:09.096 A:middle
and different use
throughout the school.

00:33:10.086 --> 00:33:13.586 A:middle
So with both Shared
Use and One to One,

00:33:13.586 --> 00:33:16.796 A:middle
Apple has some great solutions
for device management.

00:33:16.796 --> 00:33:20.226 A:middle
For One to One, we have our
device enrollment program

00:33:20.526 --> 00:33:22.666 A:middle
and we have the volume
purchase program.

00:33:22.966 --> 00:33:26.286 A:middle
That really makes just
a simple setup process:

00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:29.436 A:middle
you turn on the device
and connects to a network,

00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:32.606 A:middle
it will set itself up for
that employee automatically.

00:33:33.526 --> 00:33:36.636 A:middle
When it comes to Shared
Use we have an application,

00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:39.086 A:middle
it's called Apple Configurator.

00:33:39.936 --> 00:33:43.816 A:middle
And Apple Configurator is
the application that you use

00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:47.956 A:middle
to connect to hardware
controllers like this

00:33:48.316 --> 00:33:54.626 A:middle
or like carts like this so that
you can have it manage hundreds

00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:57.786 A:middle
or dozens of devices
simultaneously.

00:33:58.366 --> 00:34:01.426 A:middle
You connect your computer
to the hardware controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.366 --> 00:34:01.426 A:middle
You connect your computer
to the hardware controller

00:34:01.896 --> 00:34:05.666 A:middle
and then you run the software
to manage that device.

00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:10.476 A:middle
On Tuesday we announced a
brand-new reimagined version

00:34:10.766 --> 00:34:14.025 A:middle
of Apple Configurator
with the incredible name

00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:16.156 A:middle
of Apple Configurator 2.

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:22.496 A:middle
And this look and feel of this
application is very interesting.

00:34:22.496 --> 00:34:27.485 A:middle
It now has a very nice graphical
flow to it, it's a lot easier

00:34:27.485 --> 00:34:32.896 A:middle
to use, and imagine the
controls, they're visual,

00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:37.406 A:middle
and they've done a really good
job at taking the complexity

00:34:37.646 --> 00:34:43.196 A:middle
of the processes for setting up
devices and made them logical

00:34:43.565 --> 00:34:46.815 A:middle
and attractive in
appearance to use.

00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:52.946 A:middle
Now even this application, as
smooth as it is, still requires

00:34:52.946 --> 00:34:55.856 A:middle
that you have some basic
knowledge of terminology

00:34:56.315 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
and the intricacies of
managing mobile devices.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:56.315 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
and the intricacies of
managing mobile devices.

00:35:00.486 --> 00:35:04.166 A:middle
This requires you to understand
these various concepts,

00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:08.056 A:middle
and for you guys that's
not really an issue

00:35:08.516 --> 00:35:12.736 A:middle
because you're all
award-winning IT professionals,

00:35:13.046 --> 00:35:16.646 A:middle
you have your crack staffs
and for you complexity, ah,

00:35:17.146 --> 00:35:19.016 A:middle
it's no big deal, you can drop

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:21.176 A:middle
into the command line
anytime you need.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:25.906 A:middle
But it just so happens that in
large organizations it's quite

00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:29.396 A:middle
often a reality that
the people who end

00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:34.456 A:middle
up managing devices really
don't have a great depth

00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:37.126 A:middle
of knowledge about IT issues.

00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:42.196 A:middle
So we call them, like,
accidental administrators.

00:35:42.536 --> 00:35:47.446 A:middle
It might be someone who
assumes a role or assumes a task

00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:50.336 A:middle
because another person has
moved to a different part

00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:54.076 A:middle
in the company, or organizations
might merge together

00:35:54.576 --> 00:35:57.026 A:middle
and people assume
new responsibilities.

00:35:57.436 --> 00:36:01.996 A:middle
So your challenge as an IT
professional is to create tools


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.436 --> 00:36:01.996 A:middle
So your challenge as an IT
professional is to create tools

00:36:01.996 --> 00:36:05.326 A:middle
that will solve these people's
problems and allow them

00:36:05.326 --> 00:36:06.966 A:middle
to set up mobile devices.

00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:11.706 A:middle
And, fortunately, new
Apple Configurator 2 comes

00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:13.326 A:middle
with Automator support.

00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:20.196 A:middle
And you as the IT professional
can use that Automator support

00:36:20.766 --> 00:36:25.436 A:middle
to easily create Automator
workflows that will go

00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:31.796 A:middle
through the various steps to set
up and configure mobile devices

00:36:32.656 --> 00:36:36.066 A:middle
and do the various actions
and the complexities

00:36:36.066 --> 00:36:40.976 A:middle
and the authentications and all
of the other interesting things

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:44.706 A:middle
that have to be done in
order to set up a device.

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:49.306 A:middle
And these actions will
run in order from the top

00:36:49.306 --> 00:36:51.686 A:middle
of your workflow down to
the bottom of your workflow,

00:36:51.686 --> 00:36:55.806 A:middle
they're executed, passing
along data as they work.

00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:59.216 A:middle
And then it's just a
matter of you being able

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:04.496 A:middle
to save this workflow to the
Script folder on your computer,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:04.496 A:middle
to save this workflow to the
Script folder on your computer,

00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:07.136 A:middle
and then it will
become installed

00:37:07.136 --> 00:37:09.606 A:middle
and ready to use by others.

00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:12.246 A:middle
So when the workflow
gets installed

00:37:12.246 --> 00:37:14.976 A:middle
into the Scripts folder, it
becomes part of the Script menu,

00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:16.766 A:middle
so that anybody that's using

00:37:16.766 --> 00:37:21.156 A:middle
that management computer just
merely needs to connect devices,

00:37:21.336 --> 00:37:26.896 A:middle
go to the Script menu, and then
choose one of the setup scripts

00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:29.786 A:middle
that you have created
through Automator,

00:37:30.256 --> 00:37:34.086 A:middle
one of the setup workflows,
and then let the process begin

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:40.116 A:middle
and manage the device, either
setting it up or configuring it,

00:37:40.206 --> 00:37:41.446 A:middle
and everybody is happy.

00:37:42.406 --> 00:37:46.126 A:middle
So let's take a look
at a specific scenario.

00:37:46.126 --> 00:37:48.956 A:middle
I'm going to create a
workflow and set up a device

00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:52.926 A:middle
for you here, and in
this scenario we're going

00:37:52.926 --> 00:37:56.476 A:middle
to have a -- we're going to
create an Automator workflow

00:37:56.676 --> 00:38:01.496 A:middle
that will automatically install
required documents onto iPads.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:56.676 --> 00:38:01.496 A:middle
that will automatically install
required documents onto iPads.

00:38:01.806 --> 00:38:04.266 A:middle
So in this scenario let's
say we have a school

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:06.626 A:middle
that we're working with,
we're going to want to copy

00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:09.876 A:middle
across the book report
template, the student handbook,

00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:14.976 A:middle
the student presentation
template, those kind of things.

00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:16.766 A:middle
So we're going to
create a workflow

00:38:16.926 --> 00:38:18.956 A:middle
that will allow administrators

00:38:18.956 --> 00:38:22.516 A:middle
to easily transfer
documents over to iPads.

00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:27.446 A:middle
So let's take a look
at that now.

00:38:29.236 --> 00:38:33.386 A:middle
There we go, let's launch
Automator, and I'm going to zoom

00:38:33.386 --> 00:38:36.116 A:middle
into this so you can see a
little bit better as we do this.

00:38:36.496 --> 00:38:39.936 A:middle
Again, I could choose
to create a variety

00:38:39.936 --> 00:38:43.616 A:middle
of Automator workflow
types, like workflow,

00:38:43.616 --> 00:38:46.826 A:middle
a self-running application, a
system service, a print plug-in,

00:38:47.006 --> 00:38:50.046 A:middle
a folder action, calendar,
alarm, image capture plug-in,

00:38:50.046 --> 00:38:53.196 A:middle
or a dictation command, but for
our purposes we're just going

00:38:53.196 --> 00:38:55.146 A:middle
to use a standard workflow file

00:38:55.426 --> 00:38:57.966 A:middle
that we can have installed
into the Script menu.

00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:00.216 A:middle
Over on the left-hand side,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:00.216 A:middle
Over on the left-hand side,

00:39:00.216 --> 00:39:03.746 A:middle
I'm going to choose Apple
Configurator as the category

00:39:03.746 --> 00:39:06.866 A:middle
that I'm going to be
drawing my actions from,

00:39:07.336 --> 00:39:08.726 A:middle
and then it's just a matter

00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:12.426 A:middle
of putting together
the various steps.

00:39:12.606 --> 00:39:14.646 A:middle
So the first thing you do
when you create a workflow

00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:18.056 A:middle
that involves setting up
mobile devices is to identify

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.086 A:middle
which devices you
want to work with.

00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:22.536 A:middle
So we have two actions
for doing that,

00:39:22.536 --> 00:39:24.436 A:middle
you have Choose Connected
Devices,

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:27.216 A:middle
which would interactively
present you a list,

00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:31.056 A:middle
or we're going to use the one
called Get Connected Devices.

00:39:31.056 --> 00:39:34.286 A:middle
I'll drag it into my
workflow area, and you can see

00:39:34.286 --> 00:39:37.956 A:middle
that in the action view I
can choose iPads, iPhones,

00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:42.656 A:middle
iPod touches, or Apple TVs,
so I can have multiple types

00:39:42.656 --> 00:39:44.646 A:middle
of devices connected and filter

00:39:44.646 --> 00:39:46.496 A:middle
out the ones that
I'm looking for.

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:48.066 A:middle
We're going to choose iPad.

00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:52.656 A:middle
Then once I've identified the
devices this action will pass a

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:56.616 A:middle
reference to those devices to
the next action, which is going

00:39:56.616 --> 00:39:58.916 A:middle
to be to copy some
documents over.

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.486 A:middle
So I have an action here
called Copy Documents


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.486 A:middle
So I have an action here
called Copy Documents

00:40:02.486 --> 00:40:04.636 A:middle
to Devices, I drag that in.

00:40:05.546 --> 00:40:10.706 A:middle
In iOS a document is
associated with a specific app,

00:40:11.206 --> 00:40:15.466 A:middle
so you have to identify
what application is going

00:40:15.466 --> 00:40:17.546 A:middle
to be associated
with these documents.

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:20.936 A:middle
And there's two ways to do that,
you can pick it from the list

00:40:20.936 --> 00:40:24.406 A:middle
of installed applications on
this computer or you can enter

00:40:24.406 --> 00:40:26.496 A:middle
in the iOS app ID, here.

00:40:26.996 --> 00:40:29.446 A:middle
We're going to choose
pick from the list.

00:40:29.446 --> 00:40:32.366 A:middle
I'm going to choose the first
one, Adobe Acrobat Reader,

00:40:32.706 --> 00:40:39.036 A:middle
and then I'm going to click
this to locate the documents.

00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:40.576 A:middle
In this case I want PDFs,

00:40:40.576 --> 00:40:43.696 A:middle
I'm going to choose the student
handbook, yes, and I'm going

00:40:43.696 --> 00:40:45.806 A:middle
to choose the student
newsletter, okay, good.

00:40:46.096 --> 00:40:47.826 A:middle
So I'll select these two,

00:40:48.376 --> 00:40:52.376 A:middle
and these two have now been
associated with this application

00:40:52.506 --> 00:40:55.136 A:middle
and will copy across
to the device.

00:40:55.456 --> 00:40:58.136 A:middle
Now here's a tip, as
administrator you might want

00:40:58.136 --> 00:41:00.656 A:middle
to go back into this
workflow again sometime,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.136 --> 00:41:00.656 A:middle
to go back into this
workflow again sometime,

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:05.566 A:middle
hold down the right key, the
Control key, right-click this

00:41:05.746 --> 00:41:09.406 A:middle
and go rename, and you can add
a comment into the action title.

00:41:09.446 --> 00:41:14.996 A:middle
So I'm going to say
Install Student Handbook,

00:41:16.186 --> 00:41:18.936 A:middle
and then hit the
-- oh, handbook --

00:41:18.936 --> 00:41:23.426 A:middle
nothing is going to help me
with my spelling, handbook.

00:41:24.546 --> 00:41:26.066 A:middle
And now I can collapse that.

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:29.826 A:middle
So I have Get Connected Devices,
Install Student Handbook.

00:41:30.096 --> 00:41:31.886 A:middle
Let's add this action again.

00:41:32.186 --> 00:41:35.026 A:middle
This time I'm going to
choose as an application,

00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:37.016 A:middle
I'm going to choose
the Pages application.

00:41:37.446 --> 00:41:40.226 A:middle
I'll go back here, select
it again, and I'm going

00:41:40.226 --> 00:41:42.696 A:middle
to choose the book
report template,

00:41:43.796 --> 00:41:46.906 A:middle
and I'll right-click
the title bar

00:41:46.906 --> 00:41:52.756 A:middle
and go Install Book
Report, very good.

00:41:52.756 --> 00:41:57.856 A:middle
And then I'm going to add the
action one more time over here,

00:41:57.856 --> 00:42:01.826 A:middle
and I'm going to choose Keynote
as the associated application,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.856 --> 00:42:01.826 A:middle
and I'm going to choose Keynote
as the associated application,

00:42:02.576 --> 00:42:04.876 A:middle
choose Add, and then we're going

00:42:04.876 --> 00:42:09.206 A:middle
to find the photo slideshow
template, choose that,

00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:12.806 A:middle
right-click the title bar
so I can give myself a name.

00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:18.856 A:middle
I go Install Photo
Slideshow, very good.

00:42:19.126 --> 00:42:20.946 A:middle
So there's my simple workflow,

00:42:21.186 --> 00:42:23.086 A:middle
so if those documents
are required

00:42:23.086 --> 00:42:27.166 A:middle
in all my devices now I have
a workflow that can be run

00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:29.336 A:middle
by my accidental administrators

00:42:29.596 --> 00:42:33.516 A:middle
to automatically copy all
the required documents over.

00:42:33.816 --> 00:42:36.996 A:middle
I can come back to this
workflow later and update it

00:42:36.996 --> 00:42:38.926 A:middle
with new documents if I want to.

00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:40.526 A:middle
One more thing.

00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:44.956 A:middle
I often find it useful that
when you're creating workflows

00:42:44.956 --> 00:42:48.686 A:middle
for others that you give
them a confirmation dialogue

00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:51.816 A:middle
at the beginning and end
of the workflow process.

00:42:52.276 --> 00:42:55.526 A:middle
So I have a script here
that does that for me,

00:42:55.526 --> 00:42:58.006 A:middle
that adds in confirmation
actions,

00:42:58.306 --> 00:43:00.546 A:middle
so when the workflow is
run you'll get this kind


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.306 --> 00:43:00.546 A:middle
so when the workflow is
run you'll get this kind

00:43:00.546 --> 00:43:02.666 A:middle
of confirmation action here.

00:43:03.336 --> 00:43:06.326 A:middle
Now I have my iPad
connected over here,

00:43:06.326 --> 00:43:08.576 A:middle
I'm going to copy this across.

00:43:09.066 --> 00:43:11.386 A:middle
Let's see if the
network holds up today.

00:43:11.386 --> 00:43:14.076 A:middle
We're going to actually run
this workflow right now.

00:43:14.606 --> 00:43:19.466 A:middle
So here's my confirmation,
and it's beginning the process

00:43:19.616 --> 00:43:21.436 A:middle
of identifying the devices.

00:43:22.936 --> 00:43:27.876 A:middle
It's now copying across
the first set of handbooks,

00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:32.216 A:middle
and now it's copying
across the book report,

00:43:32.896 --> 00:43:35.796 A:middle
and now it's copying
across the Keynote document,

00:43:36.706 --> 00:43:39.276 A:middle
and now it's confirmed
to me that it is done.

00:43:39.876 --> 00:43:44.986 A:middle
So let's go over to number
three, number three is showing

00:43:44.986 --> 00:43:46.446 A:middle
up over here -- yes, okay,

00:43:46.446 --> 00:43:49.106 A:middle
so here's our Woodbury
Middle School pad,

00:43:49.356 --> 00:43:53.156 A:middle
if I go to the Acrobat
Reader you can see that, hey,

00:43:53.156 --> 00:43:55.946 A:middle
there's the student
handbook, indeed,

00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:58.286 A:middle
and here's the student
newsletter

00:43:58.426 --> 00:44:00.876 A:middle
that they can read, very good.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.426 --> 00:44:00.876 A:middle
that they can read, very good.

00:44:01.336 --> 00:44:05.806 A:middle
And if I go to Pages,
I can import

00:44:05.806 --> 00:44:11.516 A:middle
that new book report template
into here, I'll tap it, hey,

00:44:11.516 --> 00:44:13.946 A:middle
and there's a place you can
add your picture as a student.

00:44:13.946 --> 00:44:17.436 A:middle
I'm going to choose take
photo, reverse the camera,

00:44:17.766 --> 00:44:24.316 A:middle
hold it on myself, use the
photo, it gets transferred in,

00:44:24.606 --> 00:44:26.406 A:middle
crazy man making a book report.

00:44:27.256 --> 00:44:29.856 A:middle
And then, finally, I'm
going to go to Keynote here

00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:35.096 A:middle
and you can see, I'll click Add,
and here is our photo slideshow

00:44:35.096 --> 00:44:38.636 A:middle
for students using the official
Woodbury School template,

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:40.346 A:middle
so I launch that.

00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:44.296 A:middle
And then I can add a
slide from the template,

00:44:44.616 --> 00:44:48.746 A:middle
and as long as we're doing that
let's add in a picture here,

00:44:48.826 --> 00:44:54.986 A:middle
let's pick this one, double tap,
call that Wind Power like that,

00:44:54.986 --> 00:44:57.536 A:middle
give that a capital, Power.

00:44:58.836 --> 00:45:00.096 A:middle
Spell, Sal, spell.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.836 --> 00:45:00.096 A:middle
Spell, Sal, spell.

00:45:01.236 --> 00:45:01.776 A:middle
Very good.

00:45:02.296 --> 00:45:04.116 A:middle
So there's the template.

00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:11.256 A:middle
So anytime that our accidental
administrators need to use

00:45:11.756 --> 00:45:14.526 A:middle
or configure some devices,
they just connect it,

00:45:14.526 --> 00:45:16.666 A:middle
they go over to the Script menu,

00:45:17.066 --> 00:45:20.146 A:middle
and they go over to the
Script menu on the computer,

00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:22.966 A:middle
choose Woodbury School,
and they can pick from any

00:45:22.966 --> 00:45:25.076 A:middle
of the various things
that they have set up.

00:45:25.426 --> 00:45:27.936 A:middle
Now I want to show
you one other thing.

00:45:27.936 --> 00:45:31.456 A:middle
I'm going to choose this Rename
and Wallpaper workflow and open

00:45:31.456 --> 00:45:33.926 A:middle
that up over here for us
to examine a little bit.

00:45:34.786 --> 00:45:38.996 A:middle
One of the things about any
workflow is customization.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:42.316 A:middle
You might not find all the
actions that you're looking

00:45:42.316 --> 00:45:49.696 A:middle
for within a particular library
of actions, but the advantage is

00:45:50.046 --> 00:45:52.066 A:middle
that since you're
using a variety

00:45:52.066 --> 00:45:58.176 A:middle
of automation technologies, you
can use the AppleScript library

00:45:58.366 --> 00:46:02.816 A:middle
that the Apple Configurator,
Automator actions are based upon


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.366 --> 00:46:02.816 A:middle
that the Apple Configurator,
Automator actions are based upon

00:46:03.056 --> 00:46:05.756 A:middle
to create your own
customized scripts

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:08.406 A:middle
that you can insert
into the workflow.

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:13.956 A:middle
This particular script here will
name the device a default name,

00:46:13.956 --> 00:46:17.936 A:middle
like Woodbury School, and then
add, append its serial number

00:46:17.936 --> 00:46:21.016 A:middle
to it as well, or any other
information that you want.

00:46:21.206 --> 00:46:23.376 A:middle
So this is what the
script for that type

00:46:23.376 --> 00:46:25.156 A:middle
of thing would actually look at.

00:46:26.156 --> 00:46:28.156 A:middle
Okay, let's go back
to our slides.

00:46:31.536 --> 00:46:37.026 A:middle
So when you use Automator
to set up iOS devices,

00:46:37.436 --> 00:46:39.456 A:middle
you can create these
kind of workflows

00:46:39.456 --> 00:46:41.836 A:middle
that could be used
by anybody, even you.

00:46:42.116 --> 00:46:45.246 A:middle
They're convenient,
easily modifiable

00:46:45.246 --> 00:46:49.376 A:middle
because they're modular,
and they're used by anybody,

00:46:49.376 --> 00:46:51.496 A:middle
even your accidental
administrators.

And you can also then call

00:46:54.016 --> 00:46:56.996 A:middle
into the underlying library
structure using either

00:46:56.996 --> 00:46:58.876 A:middle
JavaScript or AppleScript

00:46:58.876 --> 00:47:02.246 A:middle
to make your own detailed
controllers as well.

00:46:58.876 --> 00:47:02.246 A:middle
to make your own detailed
controllers as well.

00:47:03.476 --> 00:47:06.516 A:middle
And that, all of this,
is documented for you

00:47:06.516 --> 00:47:10.576 A:middle
at a third website, called
configautomation.com.

00:47:11.436 --> 00:47:12.876 A:middle
It's available for you today.

00:47:13.756 --> 00:47:18.236 A:middle
So we looked at three different
examples today of how automation

00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:22.246 A:middle
and OS X can be used to
support the enterprise.

00:47:22.536 --> 00:47:26.256 A:middle
And especially important to
remember that the concept

00:47:26.256 --> 00:47:28.876 A:middle
of inclusion is really valuable.

00:47:29.316 --> 00:47:32.806 A:middle
When you have iOS and
OS X working together,

00:47:33.256 --> 00:47:34.566 A:middle
they're unbeatable.

00:47:34.966 --> 00:47:39.216 A:middle
When you have a variety of
work tools available to you,

00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:42.266 A:middle
you can create interesting
and powerful solutions.

00:47:42.876 --> 00:47:46.776 A:middle
And remember we have these links
here for you to get information

00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:49.426 A:middle
about all of the examples
that I showed you today.

00:47:49.586 --> 00:47:53.546 A:middle
We have photosautomation.com,
configautomation.com,

00:47:53.936 --> 00:47:56.626 A:middle
iworkautomation.com,
and for OS X

00:47:56.626 --> 00:48:00.336 A:middle
in general we have
macosxautomation.com as well.

00:47:56.626 --> 00:48:00.336 A:middle
in general we have
macosxautomation.com as well.

00:48:01.226 --> 00:48:05.316 A:middle
So I want to remind you that
if you want more detailed

00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:08.076 A:middle
information about
Apple Configurator 2,

00:48:08.326 --> 00:48:12.256 A:middle
Todd on Tuesday really
covered it well in his session,

00:48:12.486 --> 00:48:14.916 A:middle
and I urge you to go back
and look at the video

00:48:14.916 --> 00:48:16.896 A:middle
on that, on his session.

00:48:17.326 --> 00:48:20.076 A:middle
In addition, we have some
labs that are going on today

00:48:20.076 --> 00:48:23.526 A:middle
and tomorrow, and after I'm done
here I'm going to go downstairs

00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:26.336 A:middle
and hang out at the lab so
you can come by and see me

00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:28.976 A:middle
and ask any questions
about this and we can play

00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:30.796 A:middle
with it right there
and try these out.

00:48:31.736 --> 00:48:34.576 A:middle
So I want to thank you for
coming by today and thank you

00:48:34.576 --> 00:48:37.676 A:middle
so much for being part of
this experience for me.

00:48:37.966 --> 00:48:39.986 A:middle
I hope this was valuable
for you.

00:48:40.096 --> 00:48:40.536 A:middle
Thank you.

00:48:42.516 --> 00:48:56.110 A:middle
