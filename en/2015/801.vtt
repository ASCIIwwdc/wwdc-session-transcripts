BERNSTEIN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:30.446 A:middle
And welcome to designing
for future hardware.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.946 A:middle
I'm Jeffrey Traer Bernstein.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:36.096 A:middle
With me are Matthaeus
Krenn and Bill Lindmeier.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:38.856 A:middle
Who is this session for?

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:44.296 A:middle
Perhaps you're creating
a device that's connected

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.926 A:middle
to an application.

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:53.126 A:middle
That device could be, say,
a dishwasher that you would

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:54.706 A:middle
like to control from
your application.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.926 A:middle
Or maybe it's a drone you would
like to control from an app.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:01.506 A:middle
Or maybe a golf club that
would send information

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:01.506 A:middle
Or maybe a golf club that
would send information

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.136 A:middle
about your swing back
to an application.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.046 A:middle
Perhaps you have an
application and you would

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.126 A:middle
like to create a device for it.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.676 A:middle
Maybe it's a game you would like
to create a custom controller

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.546 A:middle
for or a messaging application.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:15.866 A:middle
Or maybe a device to
go with a dating app.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:16.796 A:middle
Who knows what that would be.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.806 A:middle
You might also find this
useful if you are designing

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:25.176 A:middle
for a device you just don't have
yet like perhaps an Apple Watch

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:27.986 A:middle
or some fancy new
thing we've released.

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:29.146 A:middle
Who are we?

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:32.896 A:middle
We are a team of inventors,
designers, prototypers.

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.296 A:middle
We work across all
of Apple's products

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:38.686 A:middle
and explore what new
interfaces mean to our devices,

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.686 A:middle
operating systems
and applications.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:44.246 A:middle
We brought you exciting features
such as Multitouch gestures,

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:46.286 A:middle
Force Touch and a Taptic Engine.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:52.356 A:middle
This time last year we did
Prototyping at WWDC 2014.

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:53.976 A:middle

Less people, all right.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.136 A:middle
Well, it is not required
for this session,

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:09.545 A:middle
but I suggest you check
it out afterwards.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.326 A:middle
I'll give you a brief
synopsis right now.

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.206 A:middle
We unveiled a disruptive,

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.816 A:middle
revolutionary new
application called Toast Modern

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.706 A:middle
that allowed you to browse for
artisanal, overpriced toast

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.046 A:middle
on the streets of San Francisco,

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:27.506 A:middle
take photos of the toast
you're eating, and share it

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:28.656 A:middle
with your friends
and loved ones.

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.766 A:middle
We used this application to
explain why to Prototype.

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:34.376 A:middle
There are two important reasons.

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:37.206 A:middle
One, test ideas to save time

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:39.156 A:middle
and money building the right
things for your products.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:42.806 A:middle
Number two is to get new
ideas to make the experience

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:44.026 A:middle
of your product even better.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.156 A:middle
We also talked about
how to Prototype.

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:53.206 A:middle
Make fake apps, show people,
and learn from their feedback,

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.946 A:middle
and do it over and over
again until the experience

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.116 A:middle
of your product is incredible.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.156 A:middle
As you might have
imagined, the reception

imagined, the reception

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.566 A:middle

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:05.596 A:middle
"The workflow shown is
something I may try."

fake apps; number two, um...

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:15.356 A:middle
missed that part."

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.216 A:middle
"I'm so proud of you."

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.546 A:middle
So today, you're all very
fortunate to be here.

revolutionary Toast
Modern product

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:32.936 A:middle
that builds upon the success of
Toast Modern, the application.

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:37.966 A:middle
We are going to give you a peek
behind the curtain, a little bit

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:40.086 A:middle
of how Apple and partners
prototype the watch.

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:44.086 A:middle
We're going to create a device
and an app that connects to it.

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:47.366 A:middle
We're going to show you along
the way a few prototyping

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.106 A:middle
strategies for hardware
and software.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.656 A:middle

&gt;&gt; JEFFREY TRAER BERNSTEIN:
So we have an iPhone

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:10.206 A:middle
and we have a Toaster.

00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:13.336 A:middle
Both have excellent
qualities to recommend them.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.616 A:middle
The iPhone has a
great interface.

00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:17.996 A:middle
It is connected to the Internet.

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.276 A:middle
And it's always with you.

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:23.476 A:middle
Our toaster can turn
bread into toast.

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:27.066 A:middle
So we want to combine
the capabilities of each.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.806 A:middle
We want to blur the lines
between hardware and software,

00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:32.506 A:middle
create a perfect
meld of the two.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.976 A:middle
I can think of another
product that has done the same.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.946 A:middle
That is the Apple Watch.

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:44.236 A:middle
Now, you might think that
at Apple we would begin here

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
with the fully formed Apple
Watch springs from the brain

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:50.116 A:middle
of its designers and is
carved out of aluminum,

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:50.876 A:middle
and sent to all of you.

00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:56.036 A:middle
In reality, we actually
begin by drawing the Watch

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:59.276 A:middle
on another device so we can
experiment with the interface.

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:03.726 A:middle
This is a pretty well formed
watch as it exists today.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:03.726 A:middle
This is a pretty well formed
watch as it exists today.

00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:09.526 A:middle
We start with this, a rectangle,
and we use this platform

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.976 A:middle
to experiment with the different
things we might need to add

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:13.556 A:middle
to the Watch to make
the experience great.

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:16.816 A:middle
We might add a Digital Crown
that we draw on the screen

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:20.866 A:middle
and scroll over to understand
how that works and experiment

00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:21.796 A:middle
with different buttons.

00:07:22.796 --> 00:07:26.876 A:middle
This is great, teaches us a ton
about the interface of the Watch

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:28.556 A:middle
and the experience of using it.

00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:33.436 A:middle
But you can't strap an iPhone
to your wrist and go outside

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:34.666 A:middle
and try it in context.

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:39.216 A:middle
So some of our app partners
when they were developing

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:41.346 A:middle
for the Watch before
Watches were available

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:42.876 A:middle
to them did some clever things.

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:46.596 A:middle
For example, this
French Transit app.

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:48.456 A:middle
They created their
own Apple Watch.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.966 A:middle
It is more rustic but useful.

00:07:51.586 --> 00:07:55.336 A:middle
They drew some pictures of
their different screens.

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:58.276 A:middle
And then slid them
inside of the watch.

00:07:58.316 --> 00:07:59.116 A:middle
This was important.

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:00.636 A:middle
This is a Transit app.

This is a Transit app.

00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:03.286 A:middle
I need to be able to see
what it's like to run

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:04.826 A:middle
for the train I'm late for

00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:06.846 A:middle
and see what train
I'm going to catch.

00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:08.356 A:middle
They have to try it in context.

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:11.826 A:middle
The German newspaper Bild
printed out a picture

00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:15.486 A:middle
of an Apple Watch and slid
underneath various screens.

00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:18.836 A:middle
It was important for them
to test the legibility

00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:20.916 A:middle
of their articles in the places

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:24.666 A:middle
where they expect
people to read them.

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:26.126 A:middle
We learned a few things

00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:28.136 A:middle
about Prototyping
hardware and software.

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:31.716 A:middle
We learned we can fake
hardware on screens

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:33.176 A:middle
as with the Apple Watch.

00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:36.576 A:middle
We can fake software
with pictures

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.596 A:middle
as we explained last
year with Toast Modern,

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:43.736 A:middle
and it is important to try it
in context at the right size,

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:46.936 A:middle
in the right place as you saw
with the paper Watch Prototypes.

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:51.346 A:middle
Here is our prototyping
cycle from last year:

00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:53.306 A:middle
make fake things,
show them to people

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:54.496 A:middle
and learn from their feedback.

00:08:55.676 --> 00:08:58.576 A:middle
This year we are going to make
fake hardware and software.

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:00.466 A:middle
Before we begin we are going

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:03.256 A:middle
to ask ourselves three important
questions for each of those.

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:05.666 A:middle
What needs to be more real?

00:09:07.236 --> 00:09:08.136 A:middle
What can be faked?

00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:10.746 A:middle
That's nearly everything except
for the one thing we are going

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:13.836 A:middle
to choose to be real, and
where will it be used?

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.896 A:middle
And then we are going to
go and show it to people.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:20.326 A:middle
Who do we show it to?

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:22.516 A:middle
The people you app is for.

00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.656 A:middle
If it's not meant
for your office mate,

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:25.756 A:middle
go find the people it's for.

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:29.976 A:middle
Where? In the place
where people will use it.

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.306 A:middle
You might have to go outside.

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:37.166 A:middle
And remember, don't
argue, defend, or dismiss.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:39.256 A:middle
You're there to learn
from people's impression

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:40.466 A:middle
of the Prototype
you put together.

00:09:42.096 --> 00:09:45.156 A:middle
After we've shown it to people,
we learn from their feedback.

00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:49.076 A:middle
We ask ourselves
three questions:

00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:50.826 A:middle
Number one, what is working?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.056 A:middle
Number two, what is not working?

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:56.946 A:middle
Number 3, what other
ideas does this give us?

00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:00.556 A:middle
Now we are going to go through
the cycle three times today

00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:00.556 A:middle
Now we are going to go through
the cycle three times today

00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:02.186 A:middle
and show you a few
different techniques.

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:05.066 A:middle
We are going to begin with
pictures and animation.

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:07.796 A:middle
Then we are going to use
a technique we call behind

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:08.186 A:middle
the curtain.

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:12.316 A:middle
After that we are going to
create a lightweight interactive

00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:13.446 A:middle
and connected prototype.

00:10:13.996 --> 00:10:17.746 A:middle
I would like to quickly recap
Toastal Service for you guys.

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:21.126 A:middle
It's the world's
first social toaster.

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:24.596 A:middle
Allows you to receive toast
messages, we call them Toasties,

00:10:26.316 --> 00:10:27.506 A:middle
and send toast messages,

00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:30.586 A:middle
and we want that
experience to be magical.

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.846 A:middle
To kick it off, I'd like to
ask Matthaeus up to the stage.

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:39.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:40.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MATTHAEUS KRENN:
Thanks, Jeff.

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:46.216 A:middle
Cool. So how are we going
to get started with this?

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:50.666 A:middle
So first of all, let's look
at our hardware and our app

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:53.026 A:middle
and ask ourselves the question
that Jeff just mentioned.

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:56.646 A:middle
First of all, what do
we make more real now?

00:10:56.646 --> 00:11:02.176 A:middle
Well, I want us actually
to start with the receiving


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:56.646 --> 00:11:02.176 A:middle
Well, I want us actually
to start with the receiving

00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.346 A:middle
and the Toasting part
of the experience.

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:07.856 A:middle
So on the hardware, let's figure
out a way how we can indicate

00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:09.846 A:middle
that a new Toastie
has been received.

00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:14.026 A:middle
On the app we can look at
new Toastie notifications

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:19.256 A:middle
and see what kind of information
the app can display with it.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.546 A:middle
The next question is,
what can be faked?

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:26.136 A:middle
And really here just go for
as much as possible really.

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:28.146 A:middle
We are not going
to build a Toaster.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.666 A:middle
We are not going to look at
how to turn bread into Toast.

00:11:30.666 --> 00:11:33.576 A:middle
All we are going to do is
put pictures on the device

00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:35.016 A:middle
and simulate the
hardware like that.

00:11:36.056 --> 00:11:39.896 A:middle
For the app again,
everything we are going

00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:41.586 A:middle
to take pictures for everything.

00:11:41.586 --> 00:11:43.926 A:middle
We are not going to make
anything really interactive

00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:45.906 A:middle
and definitely not
writing any code.

00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:50.906 A:middle
And third, where will
the product be used?

00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:54.686 A:middle
For the Toaster,
that's the kitchen.

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:57.476 A:middle
For the app it's anywhere
or at least anywhere

00:11:57.476 --> 00:11:58.416 A:middle
around the house for sure.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:03.346 A:middle
So let's start with
looking at our Toaster.

00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
We said that we wanted
to simulate hardware

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:09.626 A:middle
by putting pictures on a screen.

00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:13.506 A:middle
That sounds awfully a lot
like what Jeff just described

00:12:13.606 --> 00:12:16.546 A:middle
with the Apple Watch
on an iPhone.

00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:20.946 A:middle
Luckily Apple also makes a great
Toaster shaped product called

00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:21.296 A:middle
the iPad.

00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:24.526 A:middle
That is just the right
thing for us here.

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.126 A:middle
To sketch out our Toaster, I'm
going to use keynote today.

00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:34.406 A:middle
For you really, whatever gets
you started easily and simply,

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:36.246 A:middle
I'm going to use keynote today.

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:37.836 A:middle
Feel free to use
whatever you can.

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:42.256 A:middle
I'm going to try to keep it
as simple as possible too.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:47.876 A:middle
A Toaster is really just
a box, some feet, a lever,

00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:50.886 A:middle
maybe we will actually
call this a digital lever.

00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:55.046 A:middle
And a slot where you can
put in a piece of bread.

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:58.036 A:middle
We also said that we
wanted to indicate

00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.656 A:middle
when a new Toastie
has been received.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.656 A:middle
when a new Toastie
has been received.

00:13:00.766 --> 00:13:03.416 A:middle
We'll put an LED up
there that can light up.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:07.626 A:middle
And while we are in
keynote, we are also going

00:13:07.626 --> 00:13:09.476 A:middle
to add some bread
to the Toaster.

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:11.926 A:middle
This is the Toaster toasting.

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:15.196 A:middle
And eventually the
Toastie pops back up

00:13:15.196 --> 00:13:17.256 A:middle
and we can see what's on it.

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:18.186 A:middle
We can take this.

00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:21.136 A:middle
We can open it in
keynote on our iPad.

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:22.876 A:middle
And we have a Toaster.

00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:27.276 A:middle
For our app we are going
to do something similar.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:30.136 A:middle
We are going to get started with
a home screen, a screen shot

00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:34.776 A:middle
of a home screen on the iPhone
and put our app icon on it.

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:39.296 A:middle
We are going to take a screen
shot and use it as an underlay

00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.236 A:middle
for an application that
we want to customize.

00:13:42.746 --> 00:13:43.286 A:middle
That's simple.

00:13:43.286 --> 00:13:48.476 A:middle
For our app, we're going to take
a screen shot of Toast Modern,

00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:50.606 A:middle
the product that we
unveiled last year.

00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:55.576 A:middle
You can see in the top left
corner there's a convenient open

00:13:55.576 --> 00:14:00.096 A:middle
spot that is the perfect place
for the link to our Toast inbox.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:55.576 --> 00:14:00.096 A:middle
spot that is the perfect place
for the link to our Toast inbox.

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:04.656 A:middle
I'll put a Toaster icon up there
and a little notification badge.

00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:10.426 A:middle
On the Toaster inbox
I'm going to use a slice

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:13.186 A:middle
of bread right now as a place
holder because I don't want

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.926 A:middle
to take away what is
actually on the Toastie.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:18.046 A:middle
We don't want to take
away the anticipation,

00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:20.346 A:middle
that surprise moment when
you are sitting waiting

00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:21.566 A:middle
for your Toast to be toasted.

00:14:22.506 --> 00:14:25.816 A:middle
We definitely want to show
who is this Toastie from?

00:14:26.336 --> 00:14:29.786 A:middle
We will put a picture and
name of the sender up there.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.366 A:middle
And we are also going to add the
date and time when it was sent.

00:14:34.066 --> 00:14:36.166 A:middle
At this point I think
it would be great

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:39.206 A:middle
if we can immediately also
choose how dark we want our

00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:40.316 A:middle
bread to be Toasted.

00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:46.376 A:middle
We can do that easily
with a slider here.

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:52.086 A:middle
Now, again let's open that on
our iPhone and see what it looks

00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:54.106 A:middle
like on an actual device.

00:14:55.756 --> 00:14:58.596 A:middle
This immediately gives
us a really life like

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
but completely fake app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
but completely fake app.

00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:05.796 A:middle
Now we can look at how these two
things work together in action.

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:08.596 A:middle
You can see that I'm
just tapping on a screen

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.956 A:middle
to make the notification
appear to open the app

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:12.326 A:middle
and to go into the inbox.

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:18.376 A:middle
And on the Toaster, I can also
-- you can first of all you see

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.126 A:middle
that the LED is already
blinking.

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.736 A:middle
Then I can tap to
insert some bread.

00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.726 A:middle
I tap again to lower
our digital lever.

00:15:26.476 --> 00:15:29.806 A:middle
Then in a couple seconds later
the Toastie will pop back out,

00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:32.076 A:middle
and we're going to
see what's on it.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:33.926 A:middle
That is not too bad for now.

00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:37.546 A:middle
We can immediately take this
and show it to our friends

00:15:37.656 --> 00:15:40.676 A:middle
and ask them how they feel
about this so we can learn

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:43.616 A:middle
from what they have to say.

00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:46.776 A:middle
So what is working right now?

00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:49.726 A:middle
Well, the LED seems to
be really good indicator

00:15:49.726 --> 00:15:52.546 A:middle
that there is a new
Toastie, and the notification

00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:55.716 A:middle
on the app helps us know that
there is a new Toastie even

00:15:55.716 --> 00:15:57.266 A:middle
when we are not sitting
in the kitchen

00:15:57.816 --> 00:16:00.046 A:middle
in full anticipation
looking at our Toaster.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.816 --> 00:16:00.046 A:middle
in full anticipation
looking at our Toaster.

00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:04.476 A:middle
What is not working so well
is, a lot of people mentioned

00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:07.786 A:middle
to us what happens when you
have more than one Toastie?

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:11.236 A:middle
That's true, our design doesn't
account for that very well.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:15.986 A:middle
So what can we do about this?

00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:21.096 A:middle
Well, maybe we'll actually
upgrade the LED on our Toaster

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.346 A:middle
and maybe our app
can show a list

00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:25.056 A:middle
of Toasties instead
of just the last one.

00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:30.036 A:middle
So let's take it from
the top here again.

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:33.246 A:middle
Let's look again at our
hardware and at our app.

00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:36.546 A:middle
And at this stage again let's
ask ourselves what needs

00:16:36.546 --> 00:16:37.316 A:middle
to be more real now.

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:42.186 A:middle
Well, we want our hardware
to handle multiple Toasties

00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.486 A:middle
and toast the right one.

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:46.416 A:middle
On the app we want to be
able to browse Toasties

00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:47.726 A:middle
and select the right one for us.

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:49.476 A:middle
What can we fake?

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.496 A:middle
Still we are going to
fake as much as possible.

00:16:52.496 --> 00:16:54.226 A:middle
There is not going to
be a real connection

00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:55.426 A:middle
between the two devices.

00:16:55.846 --> 00:16:58.756 A:middle
Anything related to actual
toasting we are not even going

00:16:58.756 --> 00:16:59.866 A:middle
to touch that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:03.406 A:middle
For the app sending data back
and forth, again we are going

00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:06.316 A:middle
to fake that and our UI
is mostly still pictures

00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:07.406 A:middle
and animations.

00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:10.096 A:middle
Where will the products be used?

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:11.336 A:middle
Still the same as before.

00:17:11.576 --> 00:17:14.826 A:middle
The Toaster in the kitchen
and the app really anywhere.

00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:17.665 A:middle
Let's look at our Toaster again.

00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:22.146 A:middle
We said we wanted to change
something about the LED.

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:24.876 A:middle
So maybe we can use a dot
matrix display here instead.

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:28.516 A:middle
We could indicate how many
Toasties have been received.

00:17:29.436 --> 00:17:33.086 A:middle
And instead of using hi res
touch screen that we put

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:36.616 A:middle
on the Toaster here which would
make our product complicated

00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:39.106 A:middle
to produce and expensive
to buy, we are not going

00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:41.646 A:middle
to recreate capabilities that
we have on the phone anyway.

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:44.676 A:middle
We'll keep the hardware
simple and focus

00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:46.666 A:middle
on the complicated
stuff on the phone.

00:17:47.236 --> 00:17:51.826 A:middle
So we'll add additional
Toasties to our inbox.

00:17:52.116 --> 00:17:54.376 A:middle
Easy to swipe through
so we can select

00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:55.756 A:middle
which one we want to Toast.

00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:59.076 A:middle
We will create a state where
a different Toastie has

00:17:59.076 --> 00:17:59.666 A:middle

00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:04.296 A:middle
We will also add a screen
that shows up on the app

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:05.936 A:middle
when the Toaster is toasting.

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:07.776 A:middle
We can add a count
down to the top

00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:09.556 A:middle
so we know how long it will be

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:12.236 A:middle
until we enjoy our
delicious piece of toast.

00:18:12.936 --> 00:18:17.786 A:middle
Finally the Toastie is toasted
and it's back on the list

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.726 A:middle
and we can see what's
on our app as well.

00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:30.616 A:middle
Now we have an iPhone, now we
have an iPhone running a keynote

00:18:30.616 --> 00:18:34.216 A:middle
of a fake app and we have
an iPad running a keynote

00:18:34.216 --> 00:18:35.006 A:middle
of a fake Toaster.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:39.606 A:middle
With those two together we can
start playing more realistic

00:18:39.606 --> 00:18:41.526 A:middle
scenario of our product
experience.

00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:44.726 A:middle
A notification comes in on
both devices at the same time.

00:18:45.556 --> 00:18:46.316 A:middle
We open the app.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.986 A:middle
We go to our inbox and
select a different Toastie.

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.446 A:middle
We add some bread
to the Toaster,

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:53.656 A:middle
push down the digital lever

00:18:53.656 --> 00:18:58.396 A:middle
and eventually the Toastie
pops back out on both devices.

00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:00.336 A:middle
Now, that's pretty cool.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:00.336 A:middle
Now, that's pretty cool.

00:19:00.336 --> 00:19:04.076 A:middle
But there is a fundamental
problem with this unfortunately.

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
When we test our product, we
can't just put the devices next

00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:12.446 A:middle
to each other in front of us
and happily tap on both of them

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:15.616 A:middle
in a really orchestrated way
to play this perfect scenario.

00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:19.946 A:middle
What is more realistic is that
eventually the Toaster is going

00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:22.476 A:middle
to be in the kitchen and
the app is going to be all

00:19:22.476 --> 00:19:23.596 A:middle
over the place with you.

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:26.916 A:middle
That's a fundamental part
of the experience, right?

00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:28.636 A:middle
You get a notification.

00:19:28.886 --> 00:19:30.046 A:middle
You walk up to the Toaster.

00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:31.216 A:middle
You do a couple things.

00:19:31.216 --> 00:19:33.336 A:middle
It starts Toasting
and you walk away

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:36.286 A:middle
to brush your teeth,
something like that.

00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:37.956 A:middle
Eventually the Toastie is done

00:19:38.116 --> 00:19:39.456 A:middle
and you come back
to the Toaster.

00:19:39.456 --> 00:19:41.896 A:middle
If you don't capture that
part of the experience,

00:19:42.246 --> 00:19:44.986 A:middle
you're testing for something
that is entirely unrealistic.

00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:49.536 A:middle
How can we make our
two Prototypes talk

00:19:49.536 --> 00:19:51.666 A:middle
to each other over a distance.

00:19:52.356 --> 00:19:53.836 A:middle
Ideally how can we do

00:19:53.836 --> 00:19:56.566 A:middle
that without putting any
additional effort into it.

00:19:56.566 --> 00:20:01.276 A:middle
I want to keep using the keynote
prototypes we just built.

I want to keep using the keynote
prototypes we just built.

00:20:01.276 --> 00:20:04.546 A:middle
It turns out our team has a
really convenient technique

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:06.056 A:middle
for circumstances like that.

00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:07.976 A:middle
I want to show that
to you right now.

00:20:11.216 --> 00:20:14.806 A:middle
You can see this is still our
keynote prototype on the phone.

00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:19.736 A:middle
But now the notification
actually comes in on its own.

00:20:20.556 --> 00:20:23.496 A:middle
We can still tap to
open the app and then go

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:25.896 A:middle
and select the different
Toastie that we want to Toast.

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:30.546 A:middle
And on the Toaster, you can see

00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:32.936 A:middle
that we can still tap
to insert some bread.

00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:35.966 A:middle
Now look at the app, what
happens when we lower the lever.

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
The app responds
to it in realtime.

00:20:40.236 --> 00:20:43.816 A:middle
When the Toastie is
back finished Toasting,

00:20:43.816 --> 00:20:47.746 A:middle
it appears on both
devices at the same time.

00:20:48.936 --> 00:20:50.326 A:middle
That's pretty awesome, I think.

00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:52.676 A:middle
But how do we do that?

00:20:53.576 --> 00:20:56.926 A:middle
Especially considering that
this is really just images

00:20:56.926 --> 00:21:02.056 A:middle
on devices, and we didn't
write a single line of code.

Well, it turns out
we have something

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:06.426 A:middle
that is a little bit cooler
and a little bit faster

00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:08.096 A:middle
and a little bit
smarter than code.

&gt;&gt; MATTHAEUS KRENN: We call this
technique behind the curtain.

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:27.656 A:middle
It is essentially about a person
pretending to be a computer.

00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:31.826 A:middle
In our case, it's
me behind the sofa,

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:37.106 A:middle
using two keynote remotes
connected to the iPhone and iPad

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:41.276 A:middle
and I can supplement
tapping on the Prototypes

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:44.256 A:middle
by remotely controlling
the state of each device.

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:48.286 A:middle
When you do something on the
app I can press on the remote

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:50.596 A:middle
and the Toaster reacts to it.

00:21:50.596 --> 00:21:53.956 A:middle
We create a perfect simulation
of this realistic experience

00:21:53.956 --> 00:21:56.726 A:middle
and we didn't really have to
do anything to achieve it.

00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:59.596 A:middle
You wouldn't believe
actually how many people

00:21:59.596 --> 00:22:00.826 A:middle
at Apple we tricked


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.596 --> 00:22:00.826 A:middle
at Apple we tricked

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:03.636 A:middle
into thinking we have
implemented some magical

00:22:03.636 --> 00:22:07.566 A:middle
technology where really, as
we were demoing our Prototype,

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:10.006 A:middle
some of our team is
just kind of sitting

00:22:10.006 --> 00:22:12.486 A:middle
in the corner controlling
one of the Prototypes.

00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:17.526 A:middle
And so again with this more
realistic setup we can go

00:22:17.526 --> 00:22:19.496 A:middle
to our friends and
ask them for feedback.

00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:27.566 A:middle
And we ask them what's working.

00:22:28.326 --> 00:22:31.406 A:middle
Well, selecting from
many Toasties

00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:33.986 A:middle
and then Toasting the right
one, it's all done, all good.

00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:36.516 A:middle
What is not working?

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:40.036 A:middle
Well, despite our incredible
Prototyping efforts,

00:22:40.656 --> 00:22:43.476 A:middle
the devices still don't feel
really connected and responsive.

00:22:44.616 --> 00:22:45.646 A:middle
What can we do about that?

00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:50.876 A:middle
Maybe we can have the Toaster
react in realtime to the input

00:22:50.876 --> 00:22:52.446 A:middle
in the app and vice versa.

00:22:53.576 --> 00:22:54.886 A:middle
To do that we are
going to have to step

00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:56.766 A:middle
up our Prototyping
game a little bit.

00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:58.686 A:middle

Bill on the stage

00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:00.666 A:middle

Matthaeus, that's awesome.

00:23:07.946 --> 00:23:09.476 A:middle
Hello, everybody, I'm Bill.

00:23:10.346 --> 00:23:13.166 A:middle
I get to spend my
days experimenting

00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:16.376 A:middle
with top-secret Apple hardware
which is pretty awesome.

00:23:18.256 --> 00:23:20.776 A:middle
So we would like to share a
little bit about our process

00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:23.656 A:middle
that might give you
some ideas for designing

00:23:23.656 --> 00:23:26.626 A:middle
for your own top-secret
hardware or possibly a device

00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:27.976 A:middle
that you just don't have yet.

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:37.376 A:middle
So after a couple of iterations,
we are feeling pretty good

00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:40.326 A:middle
about the designs that
Matthaeus created for us.

00:23:41.076 --> 00:23:43.006 A:middle
However, with the
keynote prototypes,

00:23:43.536 --> 00:23:44.936 A:middle
it can only take us so far.

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:48.326 A:middle
We can tap through from
state to state or fake that,

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:50.576 A:middle
but there is no true
interactivity yet.

00:23:51.226 --> 00:23:53.216 A:middle
For example, the digital lever.

00:23:53.706 --> 00:23:56.256 A:middle
We can't drag that up and
down, which is pretty critical.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:06.856 A:middle
So let's return to
our three questions

00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:10.726 A:middle
and decide how can we enhance
the fidelity of these prototypes

00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:13.306 A:middle
with a little bit of
interactivity and a little bit

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:15.826 A:middle
of connectivity to make
them that much better.

00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:19.576 A:middle
What needs to be more real?

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:24.016 A:middle
On the hardware side we want
to wire up the digital lever.

00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:26.696 A:middle
We also want to connect
the state

00:24:26.696 --> 00:24:29.206 A:middle
of the Toaster to
the app itself.

00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:33.146 A:middle
On the app side let's
allow our friends

00:24:33.146 --> 00:24:35.966 A:middle
to browse the Toasties
in the inbox.

00:24:36.936 --> 00:24:39.946 A:middle
Also pick a Toastie to Toast.

00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:43.186 A:middle
So we like faking things.

00:24:43.266 --> 00:24:44.906 A:middle
What can we keep fake?

00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:48.856 A:middle
Let's not worry about
servers, edge cases,

00:24:49.246 --> 00:24:50.506 A:middle
turning bread into Toast.

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:54.206 A:middle
And on the app side,
we are going to keep

00:24:54.206 --> 00:24:56.126 A:middle
that message queue
completely canned

00:24:56.426 --> 00:24:58.496 A:middle
and also the Toasties
themselves,

00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
we'll have them be
images on both devices.

00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
we'll have them be
images on both devices.

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:03.016 A:middle
We won't actually send
them back and forth

00:25:03.116 --> 00:25:08.696 A:middle
between the devices
over the air.

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:11.606 A:middle
Okay. So where are we
going to use these things?

00:25:11.606 --> 00:25:12.686 A:middle
Toasters live in the kitchen,

00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:14.426 A:middle
so we'll use the
Toaster in the kitchen.

00:25:15.576 --> 00:25:17.026 A:middle
The app can be used anywhere

00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:18.406 A:middle
that maybe you're
hungry for a snack.

00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:21.456 A:middle
Maybe it's the first app you
launch when you roll out of bed.

00:25:22.016 --> 00:25:25.906 A:middle
We have to ask ourselves,

00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:27.706 A:middle
what is the best way
of moving forward?

00:25:31.156 --> 00:25:34.186 A:middle
Matthaeus said he wanted to
connect the Toaster and the app.

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:37.906 A:middle
Maybe we start with a real
Toaster, hack it together

00:25:37.906 --> 00:25:39.466 A:middle
with a microcontroller.

00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:43.526 A:middle
Maybe put a wireless radio
on it, some LEDs to make

00:25:43.526 --> 00:25:45.166 A:middle
that a nice little display.

00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
And this would probably work.

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:51.666 A:middle
But we are not committed enough
to this design to move forward

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:54.156 A:middle
in this direction because this
is starting to feel very real.

00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:59.906 A:middle

a model of our Toaster

to use, but Toaster haptics
are still about five years out,

so we have to put it on hold.

examples have in common

the experience.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:04.316 A:middle
So to the extent that we do
any engineering at this point,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:04.316 A:middle
So to the extent that we do
any engineering at this point,

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:08.036 A:middle
let's keep it to the engineering
which enhances our design

00:27:08.036 --> 00:27:10.126 A:middle
and lets us explore that
a little bit further.

00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:13.916 A:middle
That way when we actually do
go to make this thing we know

00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:17.036 A:middle
that we are making
the right thing.

00:27:17.246 --> 00:27:20.416 A:middle
Okay. So with that in
mind, for the purposes

00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:22.916 A:middle
of our Prototype,
what is a Toaster?

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:26.886 A:middle
It is not a bread heating
device, but you knew that.

00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:29.766 A:middle
It is a connected state machine.

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:33.166 A:middle
When I say that I just mean
that it's a physical object

00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:36.076 A:middle
with attributes like where
the digital lever is, whether

00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:38.856 A:middle
or not there's Toast in it,
what message is toasting,

00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:41.936 A:middle
and we want to know how do
these attributes respond

00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:42.936 A:middle
to user input.

00:27:44.146 --> 00:27:47.606 A:middle
We can easily model
this with software.

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:53.906 A:middle
So we are going to take our
existing keynote Prototypes,

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:55.746 A:middle
the app of the Toaster.

00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:57.896 A:middle
We are going to port
them to Swift.

00:27:58.566 --> 00:28:02.496 A:middle
And when I say we are going to
port them to Swift, I don't mean


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.566 --> 00:28:02.496 A:middle
And when I say we are going to
port them to Swift, I don't mean

00:28:02.496 --> 00:28:04.026 A:middle
that we are going to
make a fully functional,

00:28:04.026 --> 00:28:05.436 A:middle
feature-rich Swift app.

00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:09.746 A:middle
It is a lot like the Prototypes
in that there are screen shots

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:13.616 A:middle
and they animate based on user
touches, but then we are going

00:28:13.616 --> 00:28:16.126 A:middle
to sprinkle in just a
little bit of extra code

00:28:16.126 --> 00:28:18.416 A:middle
for features we want
to explore further.

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:21.446 A:middle
Of course this doesn't
have to be Swift.

00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.796 A:middle
It can be another
programming language you like.

00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.576 A:middle
It can be another tool that
allows you more interactivity.

00:28:27.046 --> 00:28:29.686 A:middle
But we at Apple happen to
like Swift so we are going

00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:32.906 A:middle
to move forward with that.

00:28:33.116 --> 00:28:36.086 A:middle
Okay. So specifically let's
define what we are going

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:36.596 A:middle
to implement.

00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:38.546 A:middle
The Toast-a-Toastie flow.

00:28:39.126 --> 00:28:44.396 A:middle
So for the first step we want to
pick a Toastie from the inbox.

00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:51.096 A:middle
Next we want to send the
Toastie to the Toaster.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:57.096 A:middle
Third, we want to Toast the
selected Toastie and finally,

00:28:57.096 --> 00:28:59.206 A:middle
we want to indicate that
the Toastie is Toasted.

00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:05.146 A:middle
So here is our new
interactive app prototype.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:05.146 A:middle
So here is our new
interactive app prototype.

00:29:05.146 --> 00:29:09.426 A:middle
What we've done is turned this
carousel into a UI scroll view

00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:11.746 A:middle
that allows our friends
to easily paginate

00:29:11.746 --> 00:29:12.926 A:middle
between the different messages.

00:29:13.496 --> 00:29:18.496 A:middle
We have a UI slider at
the bottom which allows us

00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:19.896 A:middle
to pick the color of the Toast.

00:29:20.766 --> 00:29:23.846 A:middle
We've also added a gesture
recognizer to each slice

00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:26.936 A:middle
of Toast so we can pull it
down into the virtual Toaster

00:29:27.206 --> 00:29:28.686 A:middle
and simulate that
it's being sent.

00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:34.336 A:middle
Let's see how that
looks in action.

00:29:34.526 --> 00:29:35.566 A:middle
We launch our inbox.

00:29:36.586 --> 00:29:40.116 A:middle
You can see as we swipe through
the Toastie selected increases.

00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:44.106 A:middle
And we can adjust the
Toast darkness variable.

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:49.596 A:middle
And then we are going
to drag the Toast

00:29:49.596 --> 00:29:53.726 A:middle
down into the virtual Toaster
which sets Toasting to true,

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:56.976 A:middle
kicks off an animation and
our Toastie is presented.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:06.276 A:middle
All right.

00:30:06.706 --> 00:30:07.746 A:middle
Moving on to the Toaster.

00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:11.506 A:middle
We are going to add a gesture
recognizer to the digital lever.

00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:14.866 A:middle
When you pull it all the way
down, it begins Toasting,

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:17.166 A:middle
set Toasting to true,
begin a timer.

00:30:17.286 --> 00:30:20.266 A:middle
We have also added a
segmented control at the bottom

00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:23.006 A:middle
that lets us easily pick
the message we want to Toast

00:30:23.006 --> 00:30:24.156 A:middle
without connecting
it to the app,

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:27.466 A:middle
and finally the animation
will present the Toast.

00:30:27.866 --> 00:30:29.406 A:middle
Let's take a look at that.

00:30:30.736 --> 00:30:33.066 A:middle
We are selecting our Toast
which loads the bread.

00:30:33.366 --> 00:30:36.366 A:middle
You can see we have this nice
animation now in the LED matrix.

00:30:36.366 --> 00:30:40.326 A:middle
When we bring the lever
all the way down to 1,

00:30:40.326 --> 00:30:44.196 A:middle
it is Toasting set to
true, kicks off the timer.

00:30:44.796 --> 00:30:45.896 A:middle
And our Toast is presented.

00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:51.046 A:middle
So this is a critical stage.

00:30:52.086 --> 00:30:54.596 A:middle
This technique of
modeling hardware

00:30:54.596 --> 00:30:56.696 A:middle
with software is super
useful and we use it

00:30:56.696 --> 00:30:57.886 A:middle
in our studio all the time.

00:30:58.826 --> 00:31:01.546 A:middle
You can imagine that you are
making a connected Fireplace


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.826 --> 00:31:01.546 A:middle
You can imagine that you are
making a connected Fireplace

00:31:01.806 --> 00:31:03.476 A:middle
and you want to integrate
that with HomeKit.

00:31:04.776 --> 00:31:08.046 A:middle
You can use a projector or that
large screen TV that you've got.

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.946 A:middle
Put it where you expect the
Fireplace to be in the den

00:31:10.946 --> 00:31:13.236 A:middle
and you can simulate
the controls right

00:31:13.236 --> 00:31:14.416 A:middle
where they are going to be used.

00:31:15.856 --> 00:31:18.536 A:middle
Maybe you are creating the next
great Transit app for the Watch

00:31:18.536 --> 00:31:20.076 A:middle
but you don't have a Watch yet.

00:31:20.516 --> 00:31:23.076 A:middle
Throw the interface on
an iPod, bring the iPod

00:31:23.076 --> 00:31:26.146 A:middle
down into the subway station
and use it in context.

00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:30.446 A:middle
Maybe you're making
the next great drone.

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:33.856 A:middle
You can simulate the hardware
controls on an iPhone,

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.616 A:middle
strap it to the paper prototype,

00:31:35.616 --> 00:31:39.156 A:middle
and when you're moving it
around, you can stream gyroscope

00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:42.476 A:middle
and accelerometer data back
as if it's the real hardware.

00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:49.566 A:middle
So we've got the interactive
app, the interactive Toaster.

00:31:49.716 --> 00:31:52.226 A:middle
Now we need to send data across.

00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:56.346 A:middle
Pick the Toastie from the
app and send physical states

00:31:56.346 --> 00:32:00.706 A:middle
across from the Toaster
back to the app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.346 --> 00:32:00.706 A:middle
across from the Toaster
back to the app.

00:32:00.966 --> 00:32:02.386 A:middle
What is the best way to do this?

00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:06.576 A:middle
The best way is whatever is
easiest and fastest for you.

00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:09.526 A:middle
We are not designing
a network API.

00:32:09.526 --> 00:32:11.856 A:middle
We can let somebody
else do that later.

00:32:11.856 --> 00:32:13.666 A:middle
We are not worried
about efficiency.

00:32:14.216 --> 00:32:16.516 A:middle
If you're Prototyping
in the browser,

00:32:17.016 --> 00:32:18.396 A:middle
maybe you use Web sockets.

00:32:18.976 --> 00:32:22.566 A:middle
If you've got that drone and
the phone connected to it,

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:24.436 A:middle
you can stream the
gyroscope data

00:32:24.436 --> 00:32:28.386 A:middle
with O.S.C. Maybe you
have a back end server

00:32:28.686 --> 00:32:32.846 A:middle
and you can use HTTP requests.

00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:34.896 A:middle
I know that some of you have
probably never programmed a

00:32:34.896 --> 00:32:35.896 A:middle
networking layer before.

00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:37.766 A:middle
So think creatively.

00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:41.596 A:middle
You can use a service like if
this then that to observe emails

00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:43.846 A:middle
that you're sending back and
forth between the devices

00:32:43.896 --> 00:32:45.016 A:middle
and take action upon that.

00:32:45.726 --> 00:32:48.216 A:middle
Maybe you're noticing
whenever a new photo is added

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:49.726 A:middle
to a shared photo stream.

00:32:53.046 --> 00:32:56.566 A:middle
So we are going to use a
Multipeer connectivity peer

00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:57.476 A:middle
to peer connection.

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.686 A:middle
This is what our network
is going to look like.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.316 --> 00:33:02.646 A:middle
We have two iPhones
connected to an iPad

00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:04.566 A:middle
and call our network Toast Talk.

00:33:05.236 --> 00:33:07.646 A:middle
The reason we're using
Multipeer connectivity,

00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:09.586 A:middle
it is incredibly easy to set up.

00:33:09.936 --> 00:33:15.316 A:middle
It doesn't require a server and
it allows an arbitrary number

00:33:15.316 --> 00:33:16.356 A:middle
of devices to connect.

00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
So here is a bit of code.

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:21.976 A:middle
I'm going to fly right through
because we are running short

00:33:21.976 --> 00:33:22.516 A:middle
on time.

00:33:22.516 --> 00:33:24.316 A:middle
We are going to create
a session.

00:33:24.316 --> 00:33:28.726 A:middle
We are going to name the network
Toast Talk and take any data

00:33:28.726 --> 00:33:30.806 A:middle
that comes in and
convert it to a string.

00:33:31.356 --> 00:33:35.796 A:middle
We can choose devices with
this handy class called the MC

00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:37.026 A:middle
Browser View Controller.

00:33:37.026 --> 00:33:40.096 A:middle
Super easy to set up.

00:33:40.096 --> 00:33:42.846 A:middle
You pass the name
into the constructtor

00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:45.276 A:middle
and also pass in that session.

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:49.316 A:middle
You can present it on a button
click or when the app launches.

00:33:49.796 --> 00:33:53.816 A:middle
Then you just dismiss it
when they've connected.

00:33:53.866 --> 00:33:55.646 A:middle
What messages should
we send back and forth?

00:33:56.396 --> 00:33:59.776 A:middle
The app Prototype wants to tell
the Toaster the Toasty number


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.276 --> 00:34:01.786 A:middle
and the Toast darkness.

00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:05.786 A:middle
The Toaster needs to
send the lever position

00:34:06.016 --> 00:34:09.246 A:middle
when Toasting began and
when Toasting ended.

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:13.545 A:middle
A little bit of code
that does that.

00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:16.106 A:middle
We are just going to
convert our string to data

00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:17.396 A:middle
and send that to the session.

00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:21.315 A:middle
And this is an example of how we
might send the letter position.

00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:23.676 A:middle
We are going to say
we've got our message

00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:24.866 A:middle
which is lever position.

00:34:25.005 --> 00:34:27.606 A:middle
Throw a carat in there and
pass some data along with it.

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:31.376 A:middle
This is a totally arbitrary
format but fast and simple.

00:34:32.315 --> 00:34:34.856 A:middle
We will split the incoming
messages on that carat

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:38.985 A:middle
and switch overall the message
names and pass the data off

00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:40.436 A:middle
to whatever function
is appropriate.

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:45.096 A:middle
This allows us this really
cool dynamic relationship

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:46.556 A:middle
between our Toaster and our app.

00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:49.866 A:middle
You can see as I drag the
digital lever up and down,

00:34:50.426 --> 00:34:54.045 A:middle
that's reflected in the app.

00:34:54.306 --> 00:34:55.085 A:middle
That's pretty great.

00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:56.085 A:middle
We've closed the loop.

00:34:56.525 --> 00:34:58.456 A:middle
We have interactive
apps and Toasters.

Toastal Service is shaping up

that much engineering.

00:35:43.806 --> 00:35:45.236 A:middle
and send them to the Toaster.

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:47.506 A:middle
That's a fundamental
part of this experience.

00:35:48.886 --> 00:35:49.766 A:middle
What is not working?

00:35:49.766 --> 00:35:52.496 A:middle
Our friends told us
it's a little odd

00:35:52.496 --> 00:35:54.386 A:middle
that there's no visual
feedback from the Toaster

00:35:54.386 --> 00:35:57.556 A:middle
when you select the color
from the color slider.

00:35:58.206 --> 00:35:59.366 A:middle
Maybe in the next round

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:04.896 A:middle
of Prototyping iteration we
adjust the color of the LEDs

of Prototyping iteration we
adjust the color of the LEDs

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:08.056 A:middle
on that matrix to reflect that
the data is being sent over

00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:11.646 A:middle
and the color is
being remembered.

00:36:12.256 --> 00:36:16.176 A:middle
So with that, I would like to
invite Jeff back up to the stage

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.416 A:middle
and he can wrap it up for us.

00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:17.906 A:middle
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; JEFFREY TRAER
BERNSTEIN: Thank you, Bill.

00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:25.916 A:middle
Thanks for taking so much time

00:36:26.006 --> 00:36:28.416 A:middle
on that last sentence,
all right.

00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:30.166 A:middle
Quick recap for everybody.

00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:33.046 A:middle
We Prototyped using
pictures and animation

00:36:33.466 --> 00:36:35.526 A:middle
so we could quickly
see different inputs

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.656 A:middle
and outputs for the Toaster.

00:36:37.176 --> 00:36:39.096 A:middle
We showed you the behind
the curtain technique

00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:42.326 A:middle
to see how the app and
the device work together.

00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:45.416 A:middle
Then we created a
lightweight interactive

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:46.466 A:middle
and connective Prototype

00:36:47.186 --> 00:36:49.746 A:middle
so we could try the entire
end-to-end experience.

00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:53.416 A:middle
Along the way we learned a
few things about our Toaster.

00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:56.456 A:middle
We don't need a darkness
setting on the Toaster

00:36:56.456 --> 00:36:57.916 A:middle
where most Toasters have that.

00:36:59.036 --> 00:37:00.896 A:middle
We need a number
display on the Toaster.

00:36:59.036 --> 00:37:00.896 A:middle
We need a number
display on the Toaster.

00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:03.656 A:middle
We need a sensor on
the digital lever

00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:04.946 A:middle
to communicate back to the app.

00:37:05.586 --> 00:37:08.786 A:middle
We figured all of this
out really, really fast.

00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:11.906 A:middle
Look at all the time
and money we saved.

00:37:12.136 --> 00:37:14.946 A:middle
Imagine that we had to build
a real Toaster to learn all

00:37:14.946 --> 00:37:18.846 A:middle
of these things and we got
really cool ideas along the way.

00:37:19.816 --> 00:37:21.246 A:middle
So all of that reminds me:

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.736 A:middle
There are two important
reasons to Prototype.

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:26.876 A:middle
Number one is to test
ideas to save time

00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:29.016 A:middle
and money building the
right things for your app.

00:37:30.256 --> 00:37:32.506 A:middle
Number two is to get new
ideas to make the experience

00:37:32.506 --> 00:37:33.646 A:middle
of your product even better.

00:37:34.246 --> 00:37:35.276 A:middle
How do we do it?

00:37:35.476 --> 00:37:36.416 A:middle
We make fake things.

00:37:36.906 --> 00:37:39.386 A:middle
We show people and learn
from their feedback.

00:37:39.896 --> 00:37:44.506 A:middle
And we do it over and over again
until our product is incredible.

00:37:46.546 --> 00:37:48.736 A:middle
So here is what we would like
you to go and do after this.

00:37:49.776 --> 00:37:51.826 A:middle
If you are creating a
thing connected to an app,

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:53.906 A:middle
for the thing, fake
it on a screen.

00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:55.316 A:middle
In context.

00:37:56.046 --> 00:37:59.616 A:middle
For your app, fake it
with pictures in context

00:38:00.106 --> 00:38:03.636 A:middle
and for the connection between
the two, just tap through both.

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:07.116 A:middle
Or use the behind the curtain
technique or behind the sofa.

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:11.196 A:middle
And maybe create a
lightweight network prototype.

00:38:12.096 --> 00:38:13.716 A:middle
If you just don't
have the device,

00:38:14.556 --> 00:38:16.066 A:middle
especially perhaps
the next thing

00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:18.956 A:middle
that we unveil, don't wait.

00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:21.236 A:middle
Fake it on a screen, in context.

00:38:21.236 --> 00:38:24.456 A:middle
Here is some stuff
about more information.

00:38:25.346 --> 00:38:26.666 A:middle
There are related sessions.

00:38:27.566 --> 00:38:31.336 A:middle
Most importantly, tomorrow
Designing with Animation.

00:38:31.806 --> 00:38:34.776 A:middle
Some of our teammates at
3:30 in this very room.

00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:36.706 A:middle
I think you'll find
it very useful.

00:38:36.956 --> 00:38:37.976 A:middle
Thank you very much, everybody!
