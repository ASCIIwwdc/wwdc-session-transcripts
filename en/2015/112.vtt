&gt;&gt; A [inaudible] Thanksgiving

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:16.926 A:middle

there's no doubt about it.

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:57.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.426 A:middle
I'm Debbie Sterling,
and I'm on a mission


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.426 A:middle
I'm Debbie Sterling,
and I'm on a mission

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.526 A:middle
to get more girls
into engineering.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:04.556 A:middle
Yeah!

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:10.026 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So it probably
sounds kind of corny,

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.786 A:middle
but this mission is really
what gets me up every morning.

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:17.256 A:middle
It's what makes me tick.

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.386 A:middle
This mission has led
me to accomplish things

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.906 A:middle
that I never thought were
possible before, like standing

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.106 A:middle
up here right now onstage

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:29.166 A:middle
at the most important developers
conference in the world.

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:32.436 A:middle
Can you believe it?

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:40.486 A:middle
And this moment, this is just
one of many crazy, outrageous,

00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.156 A:middle
audacious goals that
I've set for myself,

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:44.776 A:middle
all in the name of this mission.

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.966 A:middle
So I'm going to share
my story with you today,

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:52.306 A:middle
and this is really a
story of audacious goals.

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.546 A:middle
When you dare to be
audacious, amazing,

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:59.376 A:middle
unbelievable things happen,
like a Super Bowl victory,

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
a legal battle with
the Beastie Boys,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
a legal battle with
the Beastie Boys,

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:05.546 A:middle
and a trip to the tattoo
parlor, just to name a few.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:09.826 A:middle
This GoldieBlox has
been a really wild ride,

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:11.516 A:middle
and I've had a lot

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:13.206 A:middle
of hard-earned lessons
along the way.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.906 A:middle
But I hope that this story
today that I'm sharing

00:03:15.906 --> 00:03:19.086 A:middle
with you will inspire all
of you to be audacious

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:20.726 A:middle
for the things that
you believe in.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:25.036 A:middle
So I'm going to start my
story right at the beginning.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:27.256 A:middle
This is me when I
was a little girl.

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:30.886 A:middle
Come on, you can
say it -- awwwwwww.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:35.846 A:middle
So I grew up in a small
town, went to public school,

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:39.406 A:middle
small-town U.S.A., Lincoln,
Rhode Island, to be exact.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:41.136 A:middle
Any Rhode Islanders in here?

00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:42.986 A:middle
Oh, there's like one, yes.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:48.086 A:middle
So growing up in
Lincoln, Rhode Island,

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:52.416 A:middle
I remember when I had
my first big break,

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:56.576 A:middle
and this was I got accepted
into Stanford University.

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.776 A:middle
And this was a really
huge deal for me.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:02.506 A:middle
No one from my high school
had ever gotten into Stanford.

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:05.756 A:middle
They announced it on the
loudspeaker, and everyone

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:06.856 A:middle
in the cafeteria clapped.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:11.406 A:middle
It was a huge deal, and
that day my math teacher,

00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:15.236 A:middle
she was my favorite teacher,
pulled me aside and she said,

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:18.116 A:middle
Debbie, what do you plan
on majoring in at Stanford?

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:19.616 A:middle
And I said I didn't know.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.036 A:middle
She said, how about engineering?

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:23.996 A:middle
I think you would
love engineering.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:27.406 A:middle
And I swear to God at that
moment I looked at her

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.976 A:middle
and I pictured an
old man train driver.

00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.441 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.906 A:middle
And I really, you know, it's
so funny and it's embarrassing

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.506 A:middle
to admit it, but I really had
no idea what engineering was

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.576 A:middle
and I was too ashamed
of asking her.

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:45.556 A:middle
So I just kind of shrugged my
shoulders and smiled and said,

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:47.936 A:middle
sure, Mrs. Verlay,
engineering sounds cool.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.386 A:middle
So I went off to
Stanford, my freshman year,

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.906 A:middle
and like most typical college
freshman I had no idea what I

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:55.736 A:middle
wanted to major in.

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:58.026 A:middle
And her voice stuck in my head,

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.936 A:middle
that you would excel
in engineering.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.626 A:middle
So I signed up for
Mechanical Engineering 101,

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:07.396 A:middle
and to my surprise I really
fell in love with that class.

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:11.376 A:middle
And so for the first time
in my life I set myself

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:15.826 A:middle
out with an audacious
goal: be an engineer.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.736 A:middle
Now most of you in this
room are probably engineers

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.646 A:middle
so this probably doesn't sound
audacious to you whatsoever,

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:26.796 A:middle
but for me this was
an unexpected path.

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:32.246 A:middle
Once I got to Stanford, it was
really only a handful of women

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:36.116 A:middle
in my classes, and only
14 percent of women

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:39.526 A:middle
in the U.S. are engineers,
so it's a huge problem.

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:40.646 A:middle
And I felt that.

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:45.246 A:middle
Being one of the only girls
in my classes, it would tend

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.236 A:middle
to mean that the
professors, when they split us

00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:50.596 A:middle
up into group projects, I'd
be the only girl in the group.

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:53.476 A:middle
And I could see the
look on the guys' faces

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:55.046 A:middle
when they got stuck
with the girl.

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
And in our group
projects, I always felt

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:00.426 A:middle
like my ideas were ignored.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:00.426 A:middle
like my ideas were ignored.

00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:04.866 A:middle
I felt like I'd compare myself
to the guys in my classes

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.096 A:middle
and they just seemed so
much smarter than me,

00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:09.876 A:middle
like they'd been
programming calculators

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:11.116 A:middle
since they were three.

00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:14.556 A:middle
Many of you in here
probably did do that.

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.046 A:middle
And I really, I never felt
good enough or that I belonged.

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:23.516 A:middle
I remember the one day that
I almost gave it up entirely.

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:28.016 A:middle
I had signed up to take an
engineering drawing class.

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:29.986 A:middle
It was a class where you
had to try and draw things

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.806 A:middle
in 3D, in perspective.

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.096 A:middle
And this class I
was actually excited

00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:36.906 A:middle
about because I'd always
loved art and I figured,

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:40.336 A:middle
I'm totally going to ace this,
but when I started getting

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:43.086 A:middle
into the coursework I
struggled with the material.

00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:47.266 A:middle
For some reason, for the life
of me I couldn't draw in 3D.

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:50.986 A:middle
I tried really hard, and
I remember our final day

00:06:50.986 --> 00:06:53.366 A:middle
of class we had to put
all of our drawings

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:54.856 A:middle
up on the wall for critique.

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
And the TAs went around and
they got up to my drawing

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
and they looked out to the
room, the entire class,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
and they looked out to the
room, the entire class,

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.346 A:middle
almost all guys, and they
said, raise your hand

00:07:05.346 --> 00:07:07.146 A:middle
if you think Debbie
should pass this class.

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:13.526 A:middle
And everyone just kind of
stood there, so awkward,

00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:14.876 A:middle
not knowing what to do.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:18.956 A:middle
And the teachers asked
again, and I turned beet red.

00:07:19.116 --> 00:07:20.936 A:middle
Everyone is kind of
shuffling their feet,

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:22.086 A:middle
not knowing what to say.

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:26.626 A:middle
And, finally, my friend, Micah
got up and he stood up for me,

00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:31.436 A:middle
and he told those TAs that
they were humiliating me

00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:32.626 A:middle
and it was unnecessary.

00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:35.626 A:middle
That it was their job to teach
me, not to make fun of me.

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:40.386 A:middle
Well, I ran out of that room
and I burst out into tears,

00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:42.036 A:middle
and I'm not much of a crier.

00:07:42.116 --> 00:07:45.696 A:middle
And at that moment I knew
what they were trying to do.

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:48.416 A:middle
I knew they were trying to
weed me out of the major.

00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:51.176 A:middle
And the worst part was I
felt like I deserved it.

00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:55.626 A:middle
But luckily Micah came to
my side and he told me not

00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:57.596 A:middle
to give up, he told
me to stick with it.

00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
He actually became
an Apple employee,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
He actually became
an Apple employee,

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:02.876 A:middle
so he's a pretty
smart guy, right?

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:09.316 A:middle
And so I followed his advice
and I did work harder,

00:08:09.316 --> 00:08:10.986 A:middle
harder than I'd ever
worked in my life,

00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:14.086 A:middle
and I earned my engineering
degree.

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
And on the day that
I graduated ...

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:21.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:23.996 A:middle
... it was really the
proudest day of my life

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.046 A:middle
because I had set an
audacious goal for myself

00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:29.046 A:middle
and I had achieved it.

00:08:29.046 --> 00:08:30.966 A:middle
And what made it so
much more meaningful is

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.836 A:middle
that it wasn't easy for me, and
once I hit it, once I climbed

00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:36.486 A:middle
that mountain and I achieved it,

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:38.395 A:middle
I learned something
about myself.

00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:41.196 A:middle
I learned that I really
was capable all along.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.256 A:middle
On the day of my graduation,
it was the same day

00:08:45.256 --> 00:08:48.836 A:middle
that Steve Jobs gave his
infamous 2005 commencement

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:52.016 A:middle
speech, and that speech
really changed my life.

00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:56.836 A:middle
He told us all to never settle,
to keep pushing, to keep going

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.636 A:middle
until you find your
true passion,

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:00.686 A:middle
until you can follow your heart.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:00.686 A:middle
until you can follow your heart.

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:04.746 A:middle
And I sat there on
that day deciding:

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:06.996 A:middle
I'm going to find my passion
and I'm going to follow it,

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:09.356 A:middle
I just don't really
know what it is.

00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:12.796 A:middle
So I started going out
there trying to find it.

00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:14.916 A:middle
I had a bunch of different jobs.

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:16.696 A:middle
I traveled the world.

00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:18.406 A:middle
I did volunteer work in India.

00:09:18.406 --> 00:09:21.546 A:middle
I was searching and searching,
I've got to follow my heart,

00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:24.946 A:middle
I just, again, don't
know what that is.

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.626 A:middle
Until finally one day it hit me.

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:34.806 A:middle
I've got to get more
girls into engineering.

00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:40.946 A:middle
The lack of women in engineering
is a joke, literally.

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.556 A:middle
There are memes about it
all over the Internet,

00:09:43.556 --> 00:09:48.116 A:middle
and everyone here knows, and I
know, that there are millions

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:50.386 A:middle
of girls out there in the
world who are just like me,

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.106 A:middle
who have it in them but
probably won't get lucky enough

00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:56.176 A:middle
to have a math teacher pull them
aside and encourage them, right?

00:09:56.916 --> 00:10:01.376 A:middle
So I started becoming obsessed
with why there are so few girls

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:56.916 --> 00:10:01.376 A:middle
So I started becoming obsessed
with why there are so few girls

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:04.626 A:middle
and women in engineering and
what I could do to change that.

00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:07.896 A:middle
I started talking about
it with everyone I could,

00:10:07.896 --> 00:10:10.356 A:middle
and asking them, how did
you get into engineering,

00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:12.526 A:middle
and why are there so
few women and girls?

00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:17.356 A:middle
And I started to hear the same
response over and over again:

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:18.386 A:middle
you can't fight nature.

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.926 A:middle
Seriously, smart, educated
people would tell me, you know,

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.346 A:middle
there are just biological
differences

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:26.456 A:middle
between men and women.

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:29.056 A:middle
And they told me, you know,

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:32.906 A:middle
men just are naturally inclined
toward building and engineering,

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.586 A:middle
they're just good
at it, you know?

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:38.766 A:middle
They've got spatial skills,
they're born to be engineers.

00:10:39.536 --> 00:10:40.946 A:middle
Well, this really pissed me off.

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:48.226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:50.556 A:middle
It did, I mean I got
into engineering,

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:52.906 A:middle
does that make me a freak
of nature or something?

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:57.616 A:middle
So this pissed me off
so much I decided to set

00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:02.136 A:middle
out with my next audacious
goal: I'm going to fight nature.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:02.136 A:middle
out with my next audacious
goal: I'm going to fight nature.

00:11:02.676 --> 00:11:04.936 A:middle
You say you can't fight nature,
well, I'm going to fight nature.

00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:09.606 A:middle
And what I started to do was
I wanted to get smart on it.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.326 A:middle
Is there any validity to
what these people are saying?

00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:13.526 A:middle
I'm going to do my homework.

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:17.626 A:middle
So I started doing research
and read every study I could

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:18.756 A:middle
on gender differences.

00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:21.516 A:middle
I wanted to know the
difference between the sexes,

00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:26.196 A:middle
those biological drivers
between men and women.

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.066 A:middle
So I read research articles.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.646 A:middle
I talked to neuroscientists.

00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:32.756 A:middle
I studied cognitive
development in children.

00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:35.376 A:middle
I met with engineers,
and parents,

00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:36.956 A:middle
and teachers, everybody I could.

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:39.746 A:middle
And I learned some
really interesting things.

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:43.196 A:middle
First, I learned that,
yes, there are differences

00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:44.366 A:middle
between men and women.

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:46.616 A:middle
There are differences
between boys and girls.

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:50.066 A:middle
For example, I learned if
you give a boy a stick,

00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:53.586 A:middle
he will most likely turn it
into a gun and shoot it at you.

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:55.516 A:middle
This is true, actually,

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:57.706 A:middle
my three-year-old
cousin literally did this

00:11:57.836 --> 00:11:59.506 A:middle
to me the other day
with my own toys.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:04.196 A:middle
I also learned that girls
are naturally inclined toward

00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:06.706 A:middle
nurturing, in case they
become a mother someday.

00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:09.826 A:middle
This is why baby dolls
and soft cuddly pets are

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:11.146 A:middle
so popular with girls.

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:14.846 A:middle
I learned that in
preschool classrooms,

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.916 A:middle
boys like to compete
mano a mano,

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:20.066 A:middle
man against man,
winner takes all.

00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:22.176 A:middle
Whereas girls like situations

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:24.996 A:middle
where everybody works
together toward a common goal,

00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:26.136 A:middle
where everybody wins.

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:29.926 A:middle
And the way that girls tend to
compete is by excluding others.

00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.156 A:middle
It's called cliques,
and I have been

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:33.726 A:middle
in a few cliques in my life.

00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:37.116 A:middle
And I learned so many
things, but I'll jump ahead

00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:40.806 A:middle
to really I think the
most important study.

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:41.976 A:middle
It was done recently.

00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:43.586 A:middle
There was a global test.

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:45.956 A:middle
Around the world they
tested boys and girls

00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:47.456 A:middle
on the same exact science test.

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:49.406 A:middle
And what the results showed was

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:53.066 A:middle
that girls actually outperformed
the boys on that test

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:54.386 A:middle
in most parts of the world,

00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:59.056 A:middle
but not in the U.S. What this
study showed, and many others

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.466 A:middle
that have been done
just like it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.466 A:middle
that have been done
just like it,

00:13:00.616 --> 00:13:03.396 A:middle
is that there's actually no
innate intellectual difference

00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:06.456 A:middle
between boys and girls in
the math and science fields.

00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:10.386 A:middle
What the study suggests is
that the problem isn't nature,

00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:13.536 A:middle
the problem is actually culture.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.726 A:middle
And from a young age, girls
and boys when they look

00:13:17.726 --> 00:13:20.816 A:middle
at the world they see
engineering as a boys' club.

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:26.366 A:middle
You've got Handy Manny; Bob the
Builder; Sid the Science Kid;

00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:32.786 A:middle
Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius;
Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:35.226 A:middle
From a young age this
is what kids believe,

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:37.696 A:middle
these are the builders, right?

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:41.936 A:middle
And what's even worse is
when you look at the world

00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:45.686 A:middle
through the eyes of a kid
it's very clear that dolls are

00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:48.046 A:middle
for girls and building
is for boys.

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:52.416 A:middle
Take a walk down the pink
aisle and there's princesses,

00:13:52.546 --> 00:14:00.056 A:middle
Barbie Dolls, fashion, literally
ironing boards today in 2015.

00:13:52.546 --> 00:14:00.056 A:middle
Barbie Dolls, fashion, literally
ironing boards today in 2015.

00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:04.096 A:middle
It's like we're back in the
1950s, and all the products

00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:07.226 A:middle
and characters for girls
tell girls that beauty

00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:09.226 A:middle
above all is what's important.

00:14:10.186 --> 00:14:11.596 A:middle
Meanwhile, the blue aisle

00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
for boys has the awesome super
heroes and action figures

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.766 A:middle
and brainteasers and
construction sets.

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.886 A:middle
Those things really help
develop an interest in science

00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:23.716 A:middle
and technology, engineering
and math,

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:25.696 A:middle
develop spatial skills,
tinkering.

00:14:26.336 --> 00:14:30.976 A:middle
So I was in this very pink
aisle four years ago and I felt

00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:32.646 A:middle
like I was in the Twilight Zone.

00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:35.986 A:middle
And at that instant
I just knew in my gut

00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:38.796 A:middle
that this was my
opportunity to change it.

00:14:38.796 --> 00:14:41.556 A:middle
So I came up with an obsession.

00:14:42.456 --> 00:14:45.666 A:middle
I'm going to invent an
engineering toy for girls.

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:50.096 A:middle
I left the store that
day, filled up a cart

00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:52.826 A:middle
with as many toys as I could
and I decided, all right,

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.096 A:middle
I'm going to start
doing research,

00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.086 A:middle
get to the bottom of this.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.666 A:middle
How can I get girls into
building and construction?

00:14:58.316 --> 00:15:00.786 A:middle
I went around, begged my
friends, please, please,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.316 --> 00:15:00.786 A:middle
I went around, begged my
friends, please, please,

00:15:00.786 --> 00:15:03.196 A:middle
please let me babysit your kids.

00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:04.856 A:middle
They were like, all right.

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:08.296 A:middle
But I needed even more
kids, people I didn't know.

00:15:08.296 --> 00:15:12.036 A:middle
I was searching and searching,
how do I find kids to test on?

00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:16.656 A:middle
I even posted -- I posted
an ad on Craigslist.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:22.636 A:middle
I did. It said free childcare
for girls four to nine.

00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:28.806 A:middle
And I didn't realize it
sounded so creepy, right?

00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:31.856 A:middle
My husband was like, thank
God you're not trying

00:15:31.856 --> 00:15:34.126 A:middle
to start a babysitting
company, what's wrong with you?

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.916 A:middle
And only one person
replied, this French woman,

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:40.586 A:middle
who I think it got lost in
translation or something.

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:42.016 A:middle
She must have been
like, America,

00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:43.576 A:middle
the greatest place in the world!

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.976 A:middle
But I actually went to her house
and I babysat her daughter.

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:51.376 A:middle
And through all of this time
I spent with kids I started

00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:52.596 A:middle
to notice some patterns.

00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:55.386 A:middle
I noticed that boys
would build for the sake

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:56.856 A:middle
of building all day long.

00:15:56.986 --> 00:15:59.686 A:middle
They would build it
up and smash it down

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:00.886 A:middle
and do it again and again.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:00.886 A:middle
and do it again and again.

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:04.616 A:middle
I noticed that the girls
really liked stories

00:16:04.616 --> 00:16:06.856 A:middle
and characters, they
liked narrative.

00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:09.216 A:middle
They didn't just want to
build, but they'd want

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.326 A:middle
to build something
for a purpose, like,

00:16:11.326 --> 00:16:14.306 A:middle
why are we building it and who
is it for, and who is it going

00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:17.426 A:middle
to help, and where is it, and
what's the story behind it?

00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:23.106 A:middle
And so all of this research
kind of led me to an "aha" way

00:16:23.106 --> 00:16:24.596 A:middle
to engage girls in building.

00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.046 A:middle
It was a really simple
idea, but I thought,

00:16:28.046 --> 00:16:30.816 A:middle
what if I combined
building with a story?

00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:35.606 A:middle
I came up with this
character that I invented,

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.826 A:middle
named GoldieBlox, and she
would be the girl builder,

00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:39.826 A:middle
a girl engineer.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.836 A:middle
And she'd go on adventures
and have to solve problems

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.306 A:middle
by building contraptions.

00:16:44.616 --> 00:16:48.496 A:middle
And I thought if girls thought
she was cool and they wanted

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:50.426 A:middle
to be like her and
do what she does,

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.916 A:middle
then maybe that would
get them to build, too,

00:16:53.226 --> 00:16:54.696 A:middle
and maybe the little machines

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:57.596 A:middle
that they build can teach
them engineering principles

00:16:57.596 --> 00:16:59.666 A:middle
and help solve problems,
give that context

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.236 A:middle
that girls were looking for.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.236 A:middle
that girls were looking for.

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:05.876 A:middle
So this was my genius idea,
this engineering toy for girls.

00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
And I became so obsessed
with it,

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:14.496 A:middle
it led me to my next audacious
goal: build a startup.

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:19.715 A:middle
So at the time when I came
up with this engineering toy

00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:21.715 A:middle
for girls, I was working

00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:25.776 A:middle
at a pretty cushy nine-to-five
job, steady paycheck.

00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
And, in fact, ever
since I was old enough

00:17:28.356 --> 00:17:31.126 A:middle
to work I always had
a job, so the thought

00:17:31.126 --> 00:17:33.726 A:middle
of actually leaving it and
starting out on my own,

00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:35.336 A:middle
it was pretty terrifying.

00:17:36.006 --> 00:17:38.666 A:middle
But it got to the point
where I was so obsessed

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.746 A:middle
with GoldieBlox it was
all I could think about,

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:43.916 A:middle
all I could talk about,
it got to the point

00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:44.996 A:middle
where it didn't feel
like a choice,

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:48.046 A:middle
it felt like it was
just what I had to do.

00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:52.736 A:middle
So I decided to give myself one
year, I'm going to go for it.

00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:56.166 A:middle
I have enough money in my bank
account that if by the end

00:17:56.166 --> 00:18:00.136 A:middle
of one year this doesn't work
out, then I can always just go

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:56.166 --> 00:18:00.136 A:middle
of one year this doesn't work
out, then I can always just go

00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:01.346 A:middle
and get another job, right?

00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:05.866 A:middle
And even if I fail at the end
of the year, am I ever going

00:18:05.866 --> 00:18:08.176 A:middle
to be ashamed for telling
people that I tried

00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:09.836 A:middle
to get girls into engineering?

00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:13.596 A:middle
No, so I went for it.

00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:18.456 A:middle
This is a picture of
me on the first day

00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:21.966 A:middle
of starting my dream job on
the floor of my apartment,

00:18:23.226 --> 00:18:25.006 A:middle
and I spent hours and hours.

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:27.336 A:middle
I had this image in my head.

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.626 A:middle
And I needed to be like the
mad scientist, and I needed

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:32.276 A:middle
to labor away until I came

00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.956 A:middle
up with this brilliant
masterpiece invention.

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:40.256 A:middle
I was so paranoid that
somebody might steal my idea

00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:45.366 A:middle
that I made anyone who came
anywhere near my prototype sign

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:46.206 A:middle
an NDA.

00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
I even made my mom sign an NDA.

00:18:51.736 --> 00:18:53.096 A:middle
And I worked and worked on this.

00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:55.296 A:middle
I was drawing pictures of
Goldie, what she might look

00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:58.476 A:middle
like building machines,
using thread spools and clay,

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.526 A:middle
stuff around the house,
the hardware store,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.526 A:middle
stuff around the house,
the hardware store,

00:19:00.816 --> 00:19:02.826 A:middle
until finally I had
a working prototype.

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:06.906 A:middle
And it was the ugliest
thing you have ever seen,

00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
but it worked and I was excited.

00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:12.596 A:middle
And so I finally decided I'm
going to take this prototype

00:19:12.596 --> 00:19:14.406 A:middle
to the New York Toy
Fair and I'm going

00:19:14.406 --> 00:19:17.256 A:middle
to see what the industry
has to say.

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:22.416 A:middle
So I went to the show with my
prototype and a badge I managed

00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:25.486 A:middle
to finagle, pretty
much snuck in,

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:27.496 A:middle
and a giant stack
of NDAs, of course.

00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:31.096 A:middle
And started walking
around booth to booth,

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.806 A:middle
talking with everyone I
could, toy store owners,

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.996 A:middle
toy executives, other
toy inventors to try

00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:40.946 A:middle
to get their feedback on what
they thought of my genius idea,

00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:42.796 A:middle
the engineering toy for girls.

00:19:43.586 --> 00:19:47.326 A:middle
Well, the response
was pretty unanimous,

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.066 A:middle
you can't fight nature.

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:55.596 A:middle
Again, these people, they
told me that girls like dolls

00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:57.056 A:middle
and boys like building,

00:19:57.486 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
that a construction toy
for girls won't sell.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.486 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
that a construction toy
for girls won't sell.

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:03.476 A:middle
They actually took me
by the arm and walked me

00:20:03.476 --> 00:20:05.486 A:middle
down the pink aisle
of the trade show

00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.736 A:middle
where we had the ironing boards

00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:09.406 A:middle
and the fashion dolls
and the tea sets.

00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:11.396 A:middle
They said this is
what girls want,

00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.876 A:middle
girls want to be princesses,
they don't want to be engineers.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:19.256 A:middle
They said maybe if you're
lucky you can license your idea

00:20:19.336 --> 00:20:22.986 A:middle
to some little educational
toy reseller

00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:25.266 A:middle
who maybe can convince
a school to put it in,

00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:28.356 A:middle
but starting your own company,

00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:30.846 A:middle
trying to make this
go mainstream,

00:20:31.216 --> 00:20:34.496 A:middle
it's an uphill battle and
you're never going to win it.

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:36.986 A:middle
So I left the show
pretty dejected

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.406 A:middle
because at this point
I'd quit my job,

00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:44.016 A:middle
I was going off my life's
savings, and I was worried,

00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.166 A:middle
what if they're right,
am I crazy?

00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:49.586 A:middle
So after the show was
over, I signed up to go

00:20:49.586 --> 00:20:51.706 A:middle
to this social entrepreneur
conference called

00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:52.366 A:middle
Starting Block.

00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.626 A:middle
It was a group of
100 young people

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.926 A:middle
who wanted to change the world.

00:20:56.646 --> 00:21:00.286 A:middle
Now I was feeling pretty
dejected after Toy Fair and,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:56.646 --> 00:21:00.286 A:middle
Now I was feeling pretty
dejected after Toy Fair and,

00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:02.626 A:middle
honestly, I wasn't
really in the mood to go

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.476 A:middle
and do more networking, but
I had already signed up,

00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:08.016 A:middle
I already paid, so
I went anyway.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.676 A:middle
And in that session, one

00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:12.636 A:middle
of the first exercises they
had us do was make all of us go

00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:13.996 A:middle
up in front of the entire room

00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:16.416 A:middle
and tell people what
we were working on,

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:17.586 A:middle
what we were passionate about.

00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:22.166 A:middle
Well, I was still so paranoid I
asked the conference organizers

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.296 A:middle
if I could have all 100
attendees sign an NDA.

00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:31.266 A:middle
And they're like, no, no,
no, that's not possible,

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
you just get up there and
do it anyway for God's sake.

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.096 A:middle
So I went up in front
of the room

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:40.346 A:middle
and for the first time ever,
I told the story and the idea

00:21:40.346 --> 00:21:44.396 A:middle
of GoldieBlox publicly,
and the room exploded.

00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:48.016 A:middle
People got to their feet
in standing ovation.

00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:50.496 A:middle
They formed a line around me

00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:52.246 A:middle
and everybody wanted
to be a part of it.

00:21:52.246 --> 00:21:53.676 A:middle
They wanted to know
how they could help.

00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:57.716 A:middle
At that conference I
learned a bunch of things

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:02.106 A:middle
about entrepreneurship, but
two lessons really stand out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:02.106 A:middle
about entrepreneurship, but
two lessons really stand out.

00:22:02.216 --> 00:22:06.156 A:middle
The first one that I learned was
this idea called creating your

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:06.526 A:middle
own luck.

00:22:07.716 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
One of the conference organizers
got up and told his story

00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:14.106 A:middle
about how he went
after his dream job.

00:22:14.726 --> 00:22:16.886 A:middle
He knew what organization
he wanted to work at,

00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:18.596 A:middle
but he didn't have
any connections there.

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:23.526 A:middle
So he started cold emailing,
coming up with every first

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:26.776 A:middle
and last name combination
he possibly could of someone

00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:28.876 A:middle
at the company, like B.

00:22:28.986 --> 00:22:31.796 A:middle
Smith at company
dot com, Brandon S.

00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:35.566 A:middle
at company dot com, emailing
every combination he could,

00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:37.256 A:middle
got no response.

00:22:37.706 --> 00:22:40.166 A:middle
So he did it again a week later,

00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:43.496 A:middle
every combo he could possibly
think of, no response.

00:22:44.306 --> 00:22:46.426 A:middle
Did it again a week later.

00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:50.206 A:middle
Finally, a woman wrote
him back begging him

00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:53.856 A:middle
to stopmailing everyone, and
she said, fine, I will meet you

00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:55.936 A:middle
at a coffee shop for
an informal interview.

00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
He got the job.

00:22:58.116 --> 00:23:01.086 A:middle
He didn't just sit around
waiting for luck to come to him.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.116 --> 00:23:01.086 A:middle
He didn't just sit around
waiting for luck to come to him.

00:23:01.086 --> 00:23:04.746 A:middle
He went out and got it, even
as shamelessly as he did so.

00:23:05.126 --> 00:23:08.856 A:middle
The next lesson I learned
was about the difference

00:23:08.856 --> 00:23:11.526 A:middle
between being an inventor
and an entrepreneur.

00:23:12.466 --> 00:23:15.486 A:middle
I learned that an inventor
is somebody who holes up,

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:18.476 A:middle
working on their ideas
all alone in isolation,

00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:20.566 A:middle
trying to perfect
something all by themselves,

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:24.666 A:middle
but an entrepreneur is somebody
who really puts themselves

00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:27.556 A:middle
out there, tells as
many people as they can

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:29.766 A:middle
about what they're passionate
about, what they're working on,

00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:33.036 A:middle
and builds a community around
them to be a part of it.

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:35.496 A:middle
And I realized that all
along I'd been acting

00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:38.196 A:middle
like an inventor, I
was a total hermit,

00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:40.156 A:middle
and that was lonely, too.

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:44.776 A:middle
And now I had this whole group
of people who believed in me

00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:47.526 A:middle
and believed in GoldieBlox,
who wanted to be a part of it,

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:51.486 A:middle
and not only that could
actually help make it better.

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:54.796 A:middle
So from that day forward
my whole view shifted.

00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:59.706 A:middle
After I left the conference,
the people there started showing

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
up in my apartment every day,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
up in my apartment every day,

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.326 A:middle
and they started
bringing their friends,

00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.566 A:middle
and their friends
brought their friends.

00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:08.806 A:middle
And this group of passionate
people gave me the energy

00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:10.376 A:middle
that I needed to
get excited again,

00:24:10.506 --> 00:24:12.976 A:middle
and we started building
prototypes

00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:14.396 A:middle
and encouraging each other.

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:18.086 A:middle
We even started a blog
where we'd write stories

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:19.426 A:middle
about what we were
learning and the challenges

00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:22.146 A:middle
that we were facing, and we'd
share it with all our friends

00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:24.146 A:middle
and family and find
more people to help.

00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:28.226 A:middle
And with the help of
this crew of people,

00:24:28.756 --> 00:24:31.476 A:middle
we built GoldieBlox
prototypes and took them all

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:34.206 A:middle
around the Bay area, into
people's homes and schools,

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:37.336 A:middle
to Maker Faire to
test it on kids.

00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:40.926 A:middle
It was a process of rapid
prototyping, and the great thing

00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:44.276 A:middle
about it is since we had no
money we didn't get too married

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:46.826 A:middle
to any one idea, we just
put it out in front of kids

00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:47.806 A:middle
and see what they thought.

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:50.446 A:middle
We just really wanted to
know what was going to work

00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:52.096 A:middle
with the girls, what
they wanted.

00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:54.306 A:middle
And, finally, after
months and months

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:57.156 A:middle
of testing we had a product
that I really believed in.

00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:01.416 A:middle
This was our first toy,
it's called GoldieBlox


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:01.416 A:middle
This was our first toy,
it's called GoldieBlox

00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:02.646 A:middle
and the Spinning Machine.

00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:07.586 A:middle
In it we have our story, a book
about Goldie and her dog, Nacho,

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:09.346 A:middle
who is always chasing his tail.

00:25:09.996 --> 00:25:12.336 A:middle
So Goldie decides, I'm
going to spin Nacho.

00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:16.036 A:middle
By using a wheel and an axle,
she builds a spinning machine.

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:20.326 A:middle
But soon her other animal
friends want to spin, too.

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.486 A:middle
So Goldie invents a belt drive

00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:24.956 A:middle
where she gets everybody
spinning all at once.

00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:28.836 A:middle
This product, you know,
as simple as it sounds,

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:30.636 A:middle
really did engage
the little girls.

00:25:30.796 --> 00:25:35.066 A:middle
I had girls in tutus pounding
their fists on the table,

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:37.716 A:middle
we have to have everybody spin!

00:25:38.356 --> 00:25:40.236 A:middle
So it works.

00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:44.256 A:middle
And it was back to all of
the research that I had done,

00:25:44.466 --> 00:25:46.346 A:middle
creating the scenarios
where everybody wins,

00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:48.416 A:middle
engaging with story,
having nurturing,

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.816 A:middle
having pets and characters.

00:25:50.256 --> 00:25:54.856 A:middle
I knew it worked, but the
problem was I knew not a single

00:25:54.856 --> 00:25:57.566 A:middle
toy store was going to buy
it because they didn't think

00:25:57.566 --> 00:25:58.666 A:middle
that girls like building.

00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
Also, I only had $2,000
left in my bank account


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
Also, I only had $2,000
left in my bank account

00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:06.176 A:middle
so that was not good
either, and in order

00:26:06.176 --> 00:26:10.256 A:middle
to actually produce
GoldieBlox I needed $150,000

00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:12.186 A:middle
for a first manufacturing run.

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.316 A:middle
So I had to set out with
my next audacious goal,

00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
Kickstart a movement.

00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:24.226 A:middle
I decided if the toy store
owners weren't going to buy it,

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:27.176 A:middle
I was going to need to
crowdfund it and prove

00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:28.116 A:middle
that there was market demand.

00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:31.986 A:middle
So as everyone knows
with Kickstarter,

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:36.706 A:middle
in order to crush it you need
an amazing video, and so I got

00:26:36.776 --> 00:26:40.236 A:middle
to work plotting out
the perfect video plan.

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:42.726 A:middle
First, I convinced a friend

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:45.316 A:middle
to let me use his
beautiful workshop, you know,

00:26:45.316 --> 00:26:46.636 A:middle
make it seem really cool.

00:26:47.186 --> 00:26:49.126 A:middle
Then I convinced my husband,

00:26:49.126 --> 00:26:50.966 A:middle
who owned a video
production company,

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:54.436 A:middle
to use all of their best --

00:26:54.646 --> 00:27:00.946 A:middle
I know it's like kind of a
helpful think I know, I know,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:54.646 --> 00:27:00.946 A:middle
I know it's like kind of a
helpful think I know, I know,

00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:02.736 A:middle
I know -- but convince
him to film this video

00:27:02.736 --> 00:27:06.106 A:middle
with the best equipment,
lighting, camera people.

00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:08.996 A:middle
And I memorized this
perfect script,

00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:10.896 A:middle
the whole thing memorized.

00:27:11.536 --> 00:27:14.996 A:middle
Got my hair done, my makeup,
went out and bought a new dress.

00:27:15.746 --> 00:27:18.666 A:middle
I was all set, ready to
go, and brought in all

00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:20.216 A:middle
of these people to come help.

00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:24.666 A:middle
We filmed the video and
we were right on time,

00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:26.516 A:middle
we were about to
launch the campaign

00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:28.116 A:middle
in a week, everything was set.

00:27:28.636 --> 00:27:31.886 A:middle
And then the film crew sent
me the first cut of the video

00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:40.256 A:middle
and my heart sank, it was
too good, it felt staged,

00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.806 A:middle
it just didn't feel like
me, it wasn't genuine.

00:27:43.426 --> 00:27:46.626 A:middle
You see, when I tell people
face to face about my passion

00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:49.656 A:middle
for GoldieBlox, they get it and
they believe it and they want

00:27:49.656 --> 00:27:51.576 A:middle
to be a part of it,
but this video was

00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:55.066 A:middle
so overdone it just wasn't
reading, it didn't feel natural.

00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:59.146 A:middle
And so even though we only had
a couple days left before the

00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:01.646 A:middle
Kickstarter was going to
go live, and even though

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:01.646 A:middle
Kickstarter was going to
go live, and even though

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:04.096 A:middle
so many people had
helped me make this video

00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:05.986 A:middle
and I felt really bad, I had

00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:09.416 A:middle
to scrap the whole thing,
I had to reshoot it.

00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:13.106 A:middle
Literally, we had two days left,
on the floor of my apartment.

00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:17.536 A:middle
And in order to get
comfortable enough to be myself

00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:20.456 A:middle
when a video camera was
staring at me six inches away

00:28:20.506 --> 00:28:23.216 A:middle
from my face I had to
drink three-quarters

00:28:23.216 --> 00:28:23.976 A:middle
of a bottle of wine.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:29.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:30.396 --> 00:28:33.306 A:middle
Actually, I just did that
backstage -- no, just kidding.

00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:38.956 A:middle
But finally after hundreds of
takes, no script, I just spoke

00:28:38.956 --> 00:28:41.296 A:middle
from the heart, and that
was actually the footage

00:28:41.296 --> 00:28:44.556 A:middle
that we used once we cut out
all of the slurring parts.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.586 A:middle
Next order of business,
we had the video

00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:52.556 A:middle
and now we needed the support.

00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.346 A:middle
In true create your
own luck form,

00:28:55.786 --> 00:28:59.486 A:middle
we created this serial
killer-style list of all

00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:02.336 A:middle
of the people that we knew
we had to let them know


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:02.336 A:middle
of the people that we knew
we had to let them know

00:29:02.336 --> 00:29:04.986 A:middle
about GoldieBlox in hopes
that they would share it --

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.286 A:middle
celebrities, journalists,
people with big audiences,

00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:12.296 A:middle
everyone we could who we thought
could help get the word out.

00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:15.666 A:middle
And then we started mapping
them, who are these people,

00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:16.596 A:middle
how can we get to them?

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:18.236 A:middle
Does someone know
someone who knows someone

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:21.086 A:middle
who can get to Hillary Clinton?

00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:24.536 A:middle
And we maniacally
schemed and plotted.

00:29:25.066 --> 00:29:27.996 A:middle
One of the people on this
list was Tim Schafer,

00:29:28.796 --> 00:29:30.956 A:middle
and I'll just tell the story
of how I got a hold of him.

00:29:31.406 --> 00:29:33.926 A:middle
He was one of many
examples of the people

00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:35.336 A:middle
who we relentlessly stalked.

00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:38.986 A:middle
So after stalking Tim I found --

00:29:39.216 --> 00:29:40.846 A:middle
and Tim, for those of
you who don't know,

00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.936 A:middle
legendary videogame designer
and Kickstarter celebrity.

00:29:44.556 --> 00:29:49.986 A:middle
After stalking him, I found
out that we used the same bank,

00:29:50.076 --> 00:29:55.426 A:middle
so I emailed my banker and
sat down with him for a cup

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:57.856 A:middle
of coffee and kind of just
sort of brought it up,

00:29:57.856 --> 00:29:59.176 A:middle
and he was like, oh,
you should meet Tim.

00:29:59.436 --> 00:30:01.576 A:middle
I'm like, yes, yes,
I'd love to meet Tim.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.436 --> 00:30:01.576 A:middle
I'm like, yes, yes,
I'd love to meet Tim.

00:30:02.386 --> 00:30:03.766 A:middle
And before I knew it,

00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:05.996 A:middle
I'm hanging out at the
office of Double Fine.

00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:10.496 A:middle
And it turns out Tim had a
daughter, and he was interested

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:11.426 A:middle
in what we were doing.

00:30:11.996 --> 00:30:15.596 A:middle
So I made the ask, I said,
Tim, would you be willing

00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:18.046 A:middle
to let me film you playing
GoldieBlox with your daughter?

00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:19.436 A:middle
And he said, sure.

00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:23.246 A:middle
So we got them together, filmed
them playing for the first time,

00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:26.096 A:middle
and it was really magical
because she loved it and it was

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:27.566 A:middle
so cute seeing them
play it together.

00:30:27.596 --> 00:30:29.746 A:middle
It was really a genuine
moment, and we actually put it

00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:30.836 A:middle
in our video as a cameo.

00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:36.386 A:middle
And the day that the Kickstarter
went live, it exploded.

00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:40.766 A:middle
First, Tim Schafer tweeted it to
his 90,000 Kickstarter backers.

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:45.466 A:middle
Then, as it turned out,
reporters from TechCrunch

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:48.676 A:middle
and The Atlantic had been
reading my blog the whole time,

00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:51.866 A:middle
and so when our campaign
went live they wrote articles

00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.126 A:middle
about it.

00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:57.786 A:middle
Our goal of raising $150,000,
we reached it in only four days.

00:30:58.326 --> 00:31:00.076 A:middle
A friend of mine who
works at Facebook sent it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.326 --> 00:31:00.076 A:middle
A friend of mine who
works at Facebook sent it

00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:02.556 A:middle
to Sheryl Sandberg, and
she became a backer.

00:31:03.126 --> 00:31:06.796 A:middle
My aunt knew someone who knew
someone, who knew Craig Newmark

00:31:06.796 --> 00:31:10.176 A:middle
of Craigslist, he backed
it and he tweeted it.

00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:15.266 A:middle
So it just totally exploded,
and the craziest thing is

00:31:15.266 --> 00:31:17.416 A:middle
that Upworthy posted the video,

00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:21.076 A:middle
and it went so viral
online we ended

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:23.196 A:middle
up selling almost
a million dollars

00:31:23.336 --> 00:31:25.106 A:middle
of GoldieBlox in preorders.

00:31:26.006 --> 00:31:27.976 A:middle
It was overwhelming,
to say the least.

00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:34.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:35.486 --> 00:31:37.016 A:middle
And I finally had
money in the bank.

00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:41.126 A:middle
I made my first hire, Lindsey,
she left her job, took the leap,

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:45.306 A:middle
came onboard, and the next day
we got an email from Toys R Us,

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.466 A:middle
which led us to our
next audacious goal:

00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.236 A:middle
disrupt the pink aisle.

00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.636 A:middle
So Toys R Us calls
and they said,

00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.676 A:middle
we'd like to meet with you.

00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:59.976 A:middle
So Lindsey and I get on a plane
and we fly to Wayne, New Jersey,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:03.646 A:middle
and we get into the meeting

00:32:03.646 --> 00:32:07.246 A:middle
with these Toys R Us
executives, these men in suits.

00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:10.026 A:middle
And in part of the Kickstarter
video, I was skulking

00:32:10.026 --> 00:32:12.776 A:middle
through the pink aisle holding
up a picture of GoldieBlox next

00:32:12.776 --> 00:32:16.006 A:middle
to Barbie, it was
obviously like at Toys R Us.

00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:19.346 A:middle
And the Toys R Us guys were
like, so what's up with

00:32:19.756 --> 00:32:21.096 A:middle
that part in your video

00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:23.776 A:middle
where you're making
us look really bad?

00:32:24.446 --> 00:32:25.786 A:middle
I'm like, sorry.

00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:28.946 A:middle
And it turned out that the
head construction toy buyer

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:32.106 A:middle
at Toys R Us had two daughters,
and he said, you know,

00:32:32.186 --> 00:32:33.456 A:middle
GoldieBlox is the
kind of product

00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:34.736 A:middle
that I want for my girls.

00:32:35.346 --> 00:32:38.456 A:middle
And sure enough, six months
later we're on the shelves

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.276 A:middle
of Toys R Us nationwide.

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:44.486 A:middle
I remember going in there
and looking at our products

00:32:44.486 --> 00:32:47.736 A:middle
on the shelf for the first
time, and I had tears in my eyes

00:32:47.846 --> 00:32:50.436 A:middle
because we had set this
audacious goal, yes,

00:32:50.566 --> 00:32:53.766 A:middle
we'll be in Toys R Us, and
never thought it would happen

00:32:53.766 --> 00:32:56.566 A:middle
so quickly, that all of
that hard work and passion

00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:59.796 A:middle
and belief could
actually happen.

00:33:00.856 --> 00:33:04.016 A:middle
But at the same time
it was pretty rough,

00:33:04.506 --> 00:33:08.276 A:middle
we started to get sales reports
in, and just because you're

00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.436 A:middle
in Toys R Us nationwide
doesn't mean

00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:13.646 A:middle
that people are necessarily
going to buy it.

00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:18.116 A:middle
And it wasn't looking good,
the toys weren't selling.

00:33:18.116 --> 00:33:20.766 A:middle
So we asked the Toys R Us
team, you know, what can we do,

00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:22.926 A:middle
how do we get more
people to buy GoldieBlox?

00:33:23.466 --> 00:33:25.476 A:middle
And they said, well, most brands

00:33:25.476 --> 00:33:29.886 A:middle
in our store will do national
TV advertising for a minimum

00:33:29.886 --> 00:33:31.686 A:middle
of a $2 million buy, you know,

00:33:31.686 --> 00:33:33.116 A:middle
you might be able
to move the needle.

00:33:34.316 --> 00:33:35.486 A:middle
Two million dollars?

00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:39.846 A:middle
That was definitely
not an option, right?

00:33:40.266 --> 00:33:42.716 A:middle
But we did have 5,000
Kickstarter backers

00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:45.526 A:middle
and we had my husband, Beau,
who knew how to make a video.

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:49.466 A:middle
So we decided we've got to
make our own commercial.

00:33:49.796 --> 00:33:52.106 A:middle
And maybe we can't put it
on TV, but you know what,

00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:53.526 A:middle
we can put it up on YouTube.

00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:56.636 A:middle
So we're going to disrupt
the pink aisle ourselves.

00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:01.536 A:middle
We reached out to all of our
Kickstarter backers and we came

00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:01.536 A:middle
We reached out to all of our
Kickstarter backers and we came

00:34:01.536 --> 00:34:05.806 A:middle
up with this idea, let's shoot
a video having girls rampaging

00:34:05.806 --> 00:34:07.516 A:middle
through the pink
aisle at Toys R Us,

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:12.106 A:middle
singing "We Are The Champions,"
like this is awesome.

00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:15.085 A:middle
So we called up our Kickstarter
backers, and we said meet us

00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:17.636 A:middle
in the parking lot of Toys
R Us, we've got an idea.

00:34:18.846 --> 00:34:20.766 A:middle
So about 50 kids and
their parents showed

00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:24.846 A:middle
up at the Toys R Us parking
lot in the blazing heat.

00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:28.186 A:middle
And, by the way, we didn't
exactly have permission

00:34:28.186 --> 00:34:32.456 A:middle
from Toys R Us to do this, so
we were just trying to lay low,

00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.936 A:middle
which definitely didn't happen

00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:38.436 A:middle
because within minutes the
security vehicles started

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:39.936 A:middle
circling us.

00:34:40.315 --> 00:34:42.886 A:middle
And I'm like, oh, my God, we're
totally going to get arrested,

00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:45.346 A:middle
we're going to get busted,
and these parents are going

00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:46.706 A:middle
to be like, who are you people?

00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:50.775 A:middle
And then the manager of Toys R
Us comes out with his clipboard,

00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.496 A:middle
and now I know we're doomed.

00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:55.186 A:middle
And he looks at me, he's
like, who is in charge here?

00:34:55.306 --> 00:34:57.246 A:middle
Like, what's going on?

00:34:57.826 --> 00:35:00.286 A:middle
And I said, well, we're the
Ada Lovelace Girls Club,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.826 --> 00:35:00.286 A:middle
And I said, well, we're the
Ada Lovelace Girls Club,

00:35:00.656 --> 00:35:02.416 A:middle
and we're on a field trip
to our favorite place

00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:04.586 A:middle
in the world, Toys R Us.

00:35:04.726 --> 00:35:06.516 A:middle
Smiling. He kind of looks at me,

00:35:06.716 --> 00:35:09.456 A:middle
raises and eyebrow,
silence passes.

00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:13.356 A:middle
He says, why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:16.106 A:middle
I don't know if we
have enough gift bags.

00:35:16.746 --> 00:35:19.946 A:middle
Turns around, runs back into
the store, comes back out,

00:35:19.946 --> 00:35:23.596 A:middle
there's a guy dressed up
as Geoffrey the Giraffe.

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:27.056 A:middle
We bring all the girls in, they
announce on the loudspeaker,

00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:29.056 A:middle
welcome, the Ada
Lovelace Girls Club!

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:32.776 A:middle
And we set up our camera,
we get the girls running

00:35:32.776 --> 00:35:35.706 A:middle
down the aisle, we get the shot,
and then we run out of there

00:35:35.706 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
as fast as we possibly can.

00:35:37.516 --> 00:35:45.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:45.696 --> 00:35:48.246 A:middle
We post the video on
YouTube, and it went viral.

00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:50.886 A:middle
Forbes picked it up
with the headline,

00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:55.256 A:middle
GoldieBlox Wins Toys R Us and
Quests to Redecorate Pink Aisle

00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:57.156 A:middle
with Engineering Kits for Girls.

00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:01.376 A:middle
And Toys R Us, they were a
little annoyed at us at first,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:01.376 A:middle
And Toys R Us, they were a
little annoyed at us at first,

00:36:01.716 --> 00:36:05.296 A:middle
but they saw what a great story
it was and they got behind it

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.986 A:middle
and they shared it
with their customers.

00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:10.996 A:middle
And before we knew it, finally
our toys started to sell.

00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:13.586 A:middle
So this little video thing
was working out for us,

00:36:13.816 --> 00:36:17.146 A:middle
so much so in fact that my
husband, Beau, actually left,

00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:20.546 A:middle
sold his video company
to come to GoldieBlox

00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:25.196 A:middle
and take his video-making
powers and use them for good.

00:36:25.686 --> 00:36:28.796 A:middle
And we decided, okay, what's
our next video going to be,

00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:30.416 A:middle
we've got to come up
with a video that's going

00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:32.876 A:middle
to make engineering
so cool for girls.

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:38.066 A:middle
So over a lunch of margaritas
we started brainstorming,

00:36:38.566 --> 00:36:40.006 A:middle
and we came up with this idea.

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:43.146 A:middle
So we were all big fans

00:36:43.146 --> 00:36:45.896 A:middle
of the OK Go Rube
Goldberg-machine music video,

00:36:46.156 --> 00:36:47.916 A:middle
we're like Rube Goldberg
machine,

00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.746 A:middle
that makes engineering
cool, right?

00:36:50.346 --> 00:36:52.056 A:middle
But how will we make
it cool for girls?

00:36:52.056 --> 00:36:55.606 A:middle
So we came up with making
a Rube Goldberg machine

00:36:55.606 --> 00:36:59.646 A:middle
out of entirely stereotypical,
sexist, pink-aisle toys.

00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:03.866 A:middle
And then we thought,
what if we set the video


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:03.866 A:middle
And then we thought,
what if we set the video

00:37:03.866 --> 00:37:05.556 A:middle
to the Beastie Boys
song "Girls,"

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:08.916 A:middle
but we flipped the lyrics,
so instead of "girls

00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:12.086 A:middle
to do the laundry," it could be
"girls to build the spaceship"

00:37:12.086 --> 00:37:13.446 A:middle
or "girls to code the new app."

00:37:14.246 --> 00:37:17.966 A:middle
Well, we were so excited
about this idea after the end

00:37:18.206 --> 00:37:20.736 A:middle
of the lunch we were all high
fiving, we were like, yes,

00:37:21.226 --> 00:37:22.676 A:middle
this is the best idea ever.

00:37:23.356 --> 00:37:26.466 A:middle
And then the crazy thing
is we actually did it,

00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:28.266 A:middle
so we created our own luck

00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:31.416 A:middle
and we started serial
killer-style stalking

00:37:31.486 --> 00:37:34.546 A:middle
to find one of the engineers
from the OK Go music video.

00:37:35.106 --> 00:37:36.336 A:middle
And we actually found one,

00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:38.506 A:middle
we told him about it,
and he was pumped.

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:41.746 A:middle
He said, yes, let's do it.

00:37:41.746 --> 00:37:45.436 A:middle
We rented a house, an
Airbnb in Pasadena,

00:37:45.606 --> 00:37:48.186 A:middle
we actually removed all of
the furniture from the house

00:37:48.646 --> 00:37:51.556 A:middle
so that we could build a
giant princess machine.

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:55.106 A:middle
Going through every room of
the house, out by the pool,

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.436 A:middle
in the garage, out the backdoor.

00:37:58.016 --> 00:38:01.326 A:middle
We got three of our original
Kickstarter girls to star

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.016 --> 00:38:01.326 A:middle
We got three of our original
Kickstarter girls to star

00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:04.686 A:middle
in the video, which started with
them watching this ultra-sappy,

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:07.826 A:middle
girlie commercial on
TV, not looking amused,

00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:10.716 A:middle
so then they deploy the
Rube Goldberg machine.

00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:12.856 A:middle
And it winds its way
all through the house

00:38:12.856 --> 00:38:15.076 A:middle
until finally coming back
in through the living room,

00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:17.766 A:middle
hitting a frying pan,
going straight at the TV,

00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:19.706 A:middle
turning the channel
to GoldieBlox.

00:38:20.816 --> 00:38:24.316 A:middle
We posted the video online,
and within a week it had

00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:25.686 A:middle
over 12 million views.

00:38:25.686 --> 00:38:28.936 A:middle
It was on the Today Show,
Good Morning America,

00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:32.266 A:middle
Ellen is tweeting it, Chelsea
Clinton is tweeting it,

00:38:32.266 --> 00:38:33.716 A:middle
everyone is going insane.

00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:38.266 A:middle
It was unbelievable
until we found

00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:41.046 A:middle
out that the Beastie Boys were
not very amused with this video.

00:38:42.426 --> 00:38:46.756 A:middle
And we went from literally the
highest of highs to the lowest

00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:51.316 A:middle
of lows in an instant
and ended up having

00:38:51.316 --> 00:38:53.306 A:middle
to face a really public lawsuit.

00:38:54.066 --> 00:38:56.816 A:middle
We worked as hard as we could
to settle it, which we did,

00:38:57.506 --> 00:39:02.906 A:middle
but in that low, low time we
had to keep pushing forward.

but in that low, low time we
had to keep pushing forward.

00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:03.726 A:middle
What's next?

00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:06.316 A:middle
How do we keep disrupting
the pink aisle,

00:39:06.426 --> 00:39:07.396 A:middle
staying on our mission,

00:39:07.396 --> 00:39:09.506 A:middle
and making engineering
cool for girls?

00:39:10.156 --> 00:39:12.356 A:middle
And then the opportunity
of a lifetime came.

00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:15.746 A:middle
We found out that Intuit
was running a program

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:18.286 A:middle
where one small business
could win a free Super

00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:19.006 A:middle
Bowl commercial.

00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:21.306 A:middle
And I couldn't help but think,

00:39:21.656 --> 00:39:24.266 A:middle
all of those old dinosaur
toy people who said

00:39:24.476 --> 00:39:28.386 A:middle
that GoldieBlox would never go
mainstream, this was our chance,

00:39:28.526 --> 00:39:30.796 A:middle
and this was our fate, right?

00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:32.416 A:middle
I knew we deserved to win,

00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:35.816 A:middle
so our whole company got
onboard, all 12 of us.

00:39:36.096 --> 00:39:38.176 A:middle
We made it our number
one company priority,

00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:42.056 A:middle
and every single day we begged
our fans, we posted pictures --

00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:43.706 A:middle
Vote for GoldieBlox,
Vote for GoldieBlox.

00:39:44.396 --> 00:39:48.826 A:middle
And the amazing thing was
that when we went at it

00:39:49.016 --> 00:39:51.346 A:middle
and we reached out to people,
just like we had done back

00:39:51.346 --> 00:39:54.386 A:middle
in the days of Kickstarter,
people voted and they shared.

00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:56.446 A:middle
And we actually ended
up winning.

00:39:57.086 --> 00:40:01.116 A:middle
So last year in the Super Bowl,
which is traditionally one

So last year in the Super Bowl,
which is traditionally one

00:40:01.116 --> 00:40:03.806 A:middle
of the most sexist,
male-dominated ad slots

00:40:03.976 --> 00:40:06.156 A:middle
in the world, we had a pack

00:40:06.156 --> 00:40:08.886 A:middle
of girls grabbing
their pink-aisle toys,

00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:11.976 A:middle
racing into a park where
they built them into a rocket

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:14.486 A:middle
and shot them into outer space.

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:22.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:23.076 --> 00:40:25.156 A:middle
Well, we were on
top of the world,

00:40:25.686 --> 00:40:29.496 A:middle
but then my biggest
fear became a reality.

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:31.896 A:middle
We had a problem
with the product.

00:40:33.446 --> 00:40:36.346 A:middle
We were making the toys
so fast to meet the demand

00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:38.646 A:middle
of all the viral videos and
the Super Bowl commercial

00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:43.146 A:middle
that we started facing
quality issues, and the holes

00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:45.546 A:middle
in our blocks were a
little bit too loose,

00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:50.056 A:middle
like 0.0001 millimeters
too loose.

00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:52.466 A:middle
And even though that
sounds really small,

00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:55.246 A:middle
it had catastrophic results
because what happened was

00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:57.686 A:middle
that girls would get frustrated
and they wouldn't want to build,

00:40:57.716 --> 00:40:58.676 A:middle
even though they were excited.

00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:03.266 A:middle
And so we had to set
another audacious goal:


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:03.266 A:middle
And so we had to set
another audacious goal:

00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:05.316 A:middle
replace every single block.

00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.906 A:middle
We decided we've got
to tackle this head-on.

00:41:08.956 --> 00:41:11.616 A:middle
It was easy to fix the blocks,
we began to do this right away,

00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:12.606 A:middle
that wasn't the issue.

00:41:12.876 --> 00:41:15.166 A:middle
It was that there were hundreds
of thousands of these blocks

00:41:15.696 --> 00:41:18.486 A:middle
out in the market, and how
were we going to convince girls

00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:19.346 A:middle
to give us a second try?

00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:23.046 A:middle
So we decided to reach out
to every single customer

00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:24.926 A:middle
that we possibly
could and tell them

00:41:24.926 --> 00:41:26.576 A:middle
that we would send them
new blocks for free.

00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:28.256 A:middle
We made a huge investment.

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:29.596 A:middle
We didn't have to do it.

00:41:29.596 --> 00:41:30.906 A:middle
It wasn't a product recall.

00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:32.126 A:middle
But it was the right
thing to do.

00:41:32.126 --> 00:41:34.566 A:middle
And then we took
it a step further.

00:41:35.486 --> 00:41:38.486 A:middle
We got the name of every
single kid who had bought it

00:41:38.856 --> 00:41:40.796 A:middle
and wrote them a
personalized letter

00:41:40.946 --> 00:41:44.496 A:middle
from Goldie explaining
the engineering lesson

00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:47.176 A:middle
of how we fixed the block,
that we turned the holes

00:41:47.256 --> 00:41:48.976 A:middle

00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:01.866 A:middle
The girls thought
Goldie was a real person,

00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:04.426 A:middle
and they sent us letters
back, thanking her

00:42:04.766 --> 00:42:06.766 A:middle
for inspiring them
to become inventors.

00:42:07.606 --> 00:42:11.236 A:middle
So after all this blocks
debacle we were like, gosh,

00:42:11.606 --> 00:42:13.896 A:middle
making hardware is really hard,

00:42:14.636 --> 00:42:18.716 A:middle
and maybe we could reach
more girls digitally,

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:20.116 A:middle
wouldn't that be great?

00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:23.426 A:middle
And so we came up with
a new audacious plan:

00:42:24.156 --> 00:42:27.276 A:middle
we're going to create
an app and we're going

00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:29.536 A:middle
to use our great stories
and engineering lessons

00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:32.456 A:middle
and scale this digitally,
reach even more girls faster.

00:42:33.016 --> 00:42:34.366 A:middle
And we can't just make any app,

00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:36.636 A:middle
we've got to put an
audacious goal around it.

00:42:36.726 --> 00:42:39.686 A:middle
So we're going to make an app
that gets featured by Apple.

00:42:40.646 --> 00:42:43.526 A:middle
So we made our first hire
on the mobile space, Kyle.

[ Applause ]

00:42:49.236 --> 00:42:54.466 A:middle
Hi, Kyle. Making an app was
not easy, let me tell you.

00:42:54.696 --> 00:42:57.066 A:middle
What started as an ebook
turned into a monster.

00:42:57.606 --> 00:43:00.416 A:middle
We had feature creep,
is what they call it.

00:42:57.606 --> 00:43:00.416 A:middle
We had feature creep,
is what they call it.

00:43:00.696 --> 00:43:03.276 A:middle
But Kyle was not going to
give up, he's like we're going

00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:05.296 A:middle
to get this featured
by Apple, I promise,

00:43:05.686 --> 00:43:09.906 A:middle
and if we do I will
get a tattoo.

00:43:09.906 --> 00:43:14.496 A:middle
So to make a very long story
short, including a drive

00:43:14.496 --> 00:43:17.786 A:middle
to Cupertino, where we had to
activate wireless tethering

00:43:17.786 --> 00:43:20.436 A:middle
for Kyle's cell phone so that
he could download the build

00:43:20.436 --> 00:43:24.286 A:middle
and code it in the car,
demoing it to Apple,

00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:26.466 A:middle
and none of us could
believe it actually worked.

00:43:27.216 --> 00:43:28.346 A:middle
We launched this thing,

00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:31.546 A:middle
and multiple hotfixes later
we got featured by Apple

00:43:31.546 --> 00:43:32.776 A:middle
and Kyle got his tattoo.

00:43:34.516 --> 00:43:39.386 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:39.886 --> 00:43:42.836 A:middle
And so now without further
ado, I'm going to walk you

00:43:42.836 --> 00:43:45.576 A:middle
through this product that
sent us to the tattoo parlor,

00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:49.566 A:middle
and it's our first product
so I'm really proud of --

00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:51.396 A:middle
it's called GoldieBlox
and the Movie Machine,

00:43:51.396 --> 00:43:54.396 A:middle
and it blends digital
and physical and story.

00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:57.596 A:middle
And so as we learned
with all of our research,

00:43:58.236 --> 00:44:00.456 A:middle
the way to really engage
girls really starts

00:43:58.236 --> 00:44:00.456 A:middle
the way to really engage
girls really starts

00:44:00.456 --> 00:44:01.366 A:middle
with a great story.

00:44:02.646 --> 00:44:04.886 A:middle
So in our story we
start with Goldie.

00:44:05.546 --> 00:44:09.226 A:middle
She's not a princess and she's
not really a genius either,

00:44:09.836 --> 00:44:12.536 A:middle
but she's an inventor
who loves building even

00:44:12.536 --> 00:44:14.056 A:middle
if she gets it wrong
half the time.

00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:18.666 A:middle
So one day Goldie finds out that
the Bloxtown Film Festival is

00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:21.086 A:middle
cancelled because the
projector is broken.

00:44:21.646 --> 00:44:22.896 A:middle
So her and her friends decide,

00:44:23.206 --> 00:44:25.546 A:middle
we're going to save the
festival with an invention.

00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:29.856 A:middle
After hours of brainstorming,
Goldie comes up with the idea

00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:32.376 A:middle
to build a zoetrope,
it's the first pre-cinema

00:44:32.546 --> 00:44:33.416 A:middle
animation device.

00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:37.146 A:middle
Using the engineering
and persistence

00:44:37.146 --> 00:44:38.896 A:middle
of vision science principles,

00:44:39.386 --> 00:44:41.316 A:middle
Goldie and her friends
build a machine

00:44:41.316 --> 00:44:42.896 A:middle
that creates a moving picture.

00:44:43.436 --> 00:44:47.446 A:middle
Once the machine actually
works, Goldie's friends kind

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.796 A:middle
of realize, hey, there,
Goldie, there's a problem,

00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.976 A:middle
this movie is only
a second long.

00:44:52.406 --> 00:44:56.066 A:middle
Another typical Goldie invention
flop, but Goldie sees this

00:44:56.066 --> 00:44:57.296 A:middle
as a golden opportunity.

00:44:57.836 --> 00:45:01.366 A:middle
Why don't we create the first
ever one-second Film Festival

Why don't we create the first
ever one-second Film Festival

00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.156 A:middle
and we'll make a million movies?

00:45:04.056 --> 00:45:06.696 A:middle
And this is how we open up the
world of engineering to kids.

00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:10.456 A:middle
With our construction set
kids can build a real working

00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:11.886 A:middle
zoetrope with our pieces.

00:45:12.506 --> 00:45:15.186 A:middle
The pieces are inspired by
common household objects,

00:45:15.886 --> 00:45:19.686 A:middle
stuff from the hardware store,
the arts and crafts section.

00:45:19.916 --> 00:45:21.886 A:middle
What helps with making
these pieces feel

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.086 A:middle
like common household
objects is it makes kids start

00:45:24.086 --> 00:45:25.756 A:middle
to see the world
as their toolbox,

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.586 A:middle
that they can really
invent anything.

00:45:27.586 --> 00:45:30.476 A:middle
But then what really
brings the experience

00:45:30.546 --> 00:45:34.706 A:middle
to life is our mobile app,
with drawing tools, stamps,

00:45:35.186 --> 00:45:37.396 A:middle
stop motion photography
and backgrounds,

00:45:37.796 --> 00:45:40.096 A:middle
kids can make their
own movies digitally,

00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:43.476 A:middle
and then they can air print
them if they want to play

00:45:43.586 --> 00:45:46.246 A:middle
in their actual zoetrope
movie machine device,

00:45:46.756 --> 00:45:48.646 A:middle
they can email them,
they can text them,

00:45:49.176 --> 00:45:51.716 A:middle
or they can even send
it to the Apple Watch.

them a star for a job well done.

00:46:03.926 --> 00:46:06.536 A:middle
What's so cool is to see
what this app has inspired,

00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:10.486 A:middle
you never can guess what
kids are going to make,

00:46:10.786 --> 00:46:12.796 A:middle
and it's pretty extraordinary.

00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:16.696 A:middle
Actually, kids have made
over a million movies

00:46:17.106 --> 00:46:18.416 A:middle
in this app that we launched.

00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:22.896 A:middle
And it's so rewarding to see
how girls can get excited

00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.966 A:middle
to invent things and build
cool stuff, and it's awesome

00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:27.636 A:middle
to be a part of that
and give them the tools

00:46:27.636 --> 00:46:30.686 A:middle
and encouragement to do that.

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.716 A:middle
So where do we go next?

00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:35.686 A:middle
How do you go from here?

00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:38.046 A:middle
We've hit a lot of
audacious goals, right?

00:46:38.706 --> 00:46:41.406 A:middle
Well, the thing about having
audacious goals is once you hit

00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:45.016 A:middle
one and you know it's possible,
you set out a bigger one

00:46:45.016 --> 00:46:46.256 A:middle
and an even bigger one.

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.696 A:middle
And that's certainly
what my team is doing.

00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:52.066 A:middle
We've got a ton of audacious
goals that we want to hit next.

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:56.556 A:middle
Now we probably won't hit all
of these, but we're never going

00:46:56.556 --> 00:46:59.066 A:middle
to stop shooting for the
moon, like, literally,

00:46:59.176 --> 00:47:01.116 A:middle
first doll on the moon is
actually one of our goals.

first doll on the moon is

00:47:01.956 --> 00:47:04.906 A:middle
And how can we be so audacious?

00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:08.526 A:middle
Well, it's because at the end of
the day, the mission is greater

00:47:08.526 --> 00:47:11.026 A:middle
than our company, and I
never feel embarrassed going

00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:13.966 A:middle
and asking somebody for help
or asking somebody to be a part

00:47:13.966 --> 00:47:15.796 A:middle
of it because it's
bigger than all of us.

00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:20.066 A:middle
We really believe in it,
and I'm reminded every day

00:47:20.066 --> 00:47:24.456 A:middle
that it's working because
every day we see evidence

00:47:24.856 --> 00:47:26.716 A:middle
of girls getting
inspired by GoldieBlox.

00:47:27.566 --> 00:47:31.296 A:middle
Recently I got a letter from
a mom, she was telling me

00:47:31.296 --> 00:47:35.066 A:middle
that her daughter was not
excited to go to science camp,

00:47:35.676 --> 00:47:37.926 A:middle
that every morning her
daughter would whine and whine

00:47:37.926 --> 00:47:39.636 A:middle
and she'd have to
drag her to camp.

00:47:39.636 --> 00:47:40.746 A:middle
Her daughter didn't want to go

00:47:40.746 --> 00:47:42.656 A:middle
because the camp
was almost all boys.

00:47:43.746 --> 00:47:46.816 A:middle
And then her mom bought her
GoldieBlox and they played it

00:47:46.816 --> 00:47:48.566 A:middle
over the weekend
together, they had a blast.

00:47:49.436 --> 00:47:51.626 A:middle
On Monday they were
getting ready to go to camp,

00:47:51.626 --> 00:47:54.896 A:middle
and her daughter wasn't
having her usual crying fit.

00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:59.226 A:middle
And her Mom asked her what's
going on with you, you know,

00:47:59.976 --> 00:48:03.066 A:middle
what's going on, and why aren't
you nervous about camp anymore?

what's going on, and why aren't
you nervous about camp anymore?

00:48:03.446 --> 00:48:06.406 A:middle
And her daughter said, oh, Mom,
I'm not nervous about camp,

00:48:06.406 --> 00:48:09.486 A:middle
I've got GoldieBlox,
I'm all set.

00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:12.346 A:middle
And I know it sounds like
I'm making this story up,

00:48:12.346 --> 00:48:14.656 A:middle
but I'm actually not,
like, this really happened.

00:48:15.056 --> 00:48:19.516 A:middle
And it's amazing because with
GoldieBlox we're starting

00:48:19.516 --> 00:48:21.486 A:middle
to give these girls
a role model,

00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:25.106 A:middle
somebody who they can
see themselves being.

00:48:25.426 --> 00:48:27.956 A:middle
And we're not just teaching
them some engineering lessons,

00:48:28.016 --> 00:48:30.156 A:middle
but we're actually
giving them confidence.

00:48:30.156 --> 00:48:32.846 A:middle
And that's what we,
all of us here,

00:48:32.846 --> 00:48:35.196 A:middle
have the opportunity to do.

00:48:35.706 --> 00:48:39.166 A:middle
We can help kids shape the
way that they see the world,

00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:41.726 A:middle
whether it's the
products that we build

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:44.236 A:middle
or just the things
that we say to kids.

00:48:44.236 --> 00:48:47.926 A:middle
I mean think about it, every
time you see a little girl

00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:49.606 A:middle
and you tell her that
she looks beautiful,

00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:51.596 A:middle
imagine what a difference
it would make

00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:54.886 A:middle
if you said she looks capable?

Or every time you're
making a game or a movie

00:49:05.136 --> 00:49:09.646 A:middle
and you're choosing a hero and
you automatically make it a boy,

00:49:10.736 --> 00:49:12.836 A:middle
what if you made it
a girl, you know?

00:49:13.656 --> 00:49:15.656 A:middle
Sometimes we propagate
gender stereotypes

00:49:15.656 --> 00:49:18.756 A:middle
and we don't even realize
it, but the cool thing is

00:49:19.216 --> 00:49:20.846 A:middle
that we have the
opportunity to change that.

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:24.226 A:middle
There's no pink or blue
aisle in the App Store,

00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:28.086 A:middle
and we get to put stuff
out there that, you know,

00:49:28.086 --> 00:49:30.746 A:middle
kids are so impressionable,
we can put stuff

00:49:30.746 --> 00:49:32.576 A:middle
out there that's going to
make them see the world

00:49:32.576 --> 00:49:33.276 A:middle
in a whole new way.

00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:36.946 A:middle
And if we do that, and if you
all join me on this mission,

00:49:37.916 --> 00:49:40.676 A:middle
we can achieve my last and
final audacious goal --

00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:44.596 A:middle
that sometime in our
own lifetime 50 percent

00:49:44.806 --> 00:49:46.586 A:middle
of WWDC is women.
