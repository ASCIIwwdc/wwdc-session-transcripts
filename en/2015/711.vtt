00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:32.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; LUKE CASE: Good morning!

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:35.336 A:middle
Thanks for coming
out and welcome

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.196 A:middle
to "Networking with
NSURL Session."

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:40.266 A:middle
I'm Luke Case and I'm an
engineer on the CF Network team.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.836 A:middle
We have got some
great stuff lined

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:42.906 A:middle
up for you guys this morning.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.846 A:middle
First, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:49.126 A:middle
about app transport security
and following that we will talk

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.216 A:middle
about some new protocol support
we've added in NSURL Session.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.136 A:middle
Now, we all heard about
watchOS on Monday.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:59.936 A:middle
We'll talk about the NSURL
Session features we've added


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:01.666 A:middle
for watchOS.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:05.495 A:middle
Following that, we will wrap
things up with some API changes

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.776 A:middle
and some new additions we've
added to the NSURL Session.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.906 A:middle
Now, to begin, I would like
to start with a little bit

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:15.686 A:middle
of background on NSURL
Session and the HTTP protocol.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.976 A:middle
NSURL Session is a networking
API that is mainly used

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:23.666 A:middle
to download content, HTTP
content, from the web.

00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:27.906 A:middle
It has a rich set of delegate
methods that can be used

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:32.016 A:middle
for authentication and other
important event handling.

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:35.846 A:middle
And one of the greatest
features about NSURL Session is

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:36.886 A:middle
that it allows you

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:41.906 A:middle
to do networking even while
your app is not running via the

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.216 A:middle
background download APIs.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.456 A:middle
Now, for those of you
that aren't familiar

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.746 A:middle
with NSURL Session,
it's recommended

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:53.826 A:middle
that you go back a few years
to the previous WWDC sessions

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.986 A:middle
on the introduction
of NSURL Session.

00:01:56.356 --> 00:01:59.196 A:middle
So now let's talk a little bit

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.096 A:middle
about the hypertext
transfer protocol.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.096 A:middle
about the hypertext
transfer protocol.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.286 A:middle
It's a very well-known
protocol and many

00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:06.136 A:middle
of you x probably
are familiar with it.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:08.106 A:middle
Essentially at its core,

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:11.356 A:middle
what you are doing is you are
making requests to the server

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.396 A:middle
and you are pulling
in data in response.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:20.686 A:middle
Now, HTTP in itself, as
some of you may know,

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.096 A:middle
is sent out over cleartext.

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:23.766 A:middle
So it's inherently insecure.

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.086 A:middle
And in today's environment,

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:28.566 A:middle
there's many hostile
parties going

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.156 A:middle
after the data that's
leaving your app

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:32.636 A:middle
and going out onto the network.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:41.356 A:middle
Now, there was a time when
using cleartext HTTP alone was

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.346 A:middle
perfectly reasonable.

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:44.586 A:middle
But that time has passed.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:48.426 A:middle
Now, fortunately for all of us,
this problem has been solved

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:49.646 A:middle
for many years and
there's a tried

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:56.786 A:middle
and true solution
known as HTTPS.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.066 A:middle
Now, HTTPS is essentially
HTTP layered on top


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.066 A:middle
Now, HTTPS is essentially
HTTP layered on top

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.746 A:middle
of another protocol known
as transport layer security.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.656 A:middle
And transport layer security
performs a multi-leg handshake

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:10.026 A:middle
using public key
cryptography and, when complete,

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.806 A:middle
creates a secure connection.

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:15.216 A:middle
Now this connection
is considered secure

00:03:15.536 --> 00:03:16.806 A:middle
because of three properties.

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:21.866 A:middle
The first being that the data
that's leaving your app goes

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:23.026 A:middle
over the network encrypted.

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:24.256 A:middle
So it can't be read.

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:28.036 A:middle
The second that it
provides message integrity

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:31.096 A:middle
so the message can't be
altered without detection.

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:34.816 A:middle
And finally, the third,
it provides authentication

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:37.856 A:middle
so you can actually prove
the identity of exactly

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:42.766 A:middle
who you are talking to.

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:47.046 A:middle
Now, NSURL Session has
excellent HTTPS support embedded

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:51.206 A:middle
within in it, and so often in
your client code, it's as easy

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:54.296 A:middle
as using HTTPS instead
of using HTTP.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:57.456 A:middle
Now, do note that some
additional server support is

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:04.016 A:middle
required, but HTTPS is supported
by most server vendors today.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:04.016 A:middle
required, but HTTPS is supported
by most server vendors today.

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:09.386 A:middle
Also keep in mind that most data
should be considered sensitive,

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:13.296 A:middle
and this is because even
if you might not think

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.996 A:middle
that the data that's
leaving your app going

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:17.976 A:middle
out onto the network
is not sensitive,

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:21.726 A:middle
your customer may,
in fact, think it is.

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.616 A:middle
For example, if you
have a TV streaming app,

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:27.966 A:middle
you may think, well,
it's just TV.

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:30.406 A:middle
You know? He's just watching TV.

00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:32.916 A:middle
He or she is just
watching TV, but to them,

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:37.376 A:middle
it may mean that they
don't want people

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:39.176 A:middle
to know what they are
watching, essentially.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:39.966 A:middle
Let's put it that way.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.486 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:46.586 A:middle
So -- now, why is it
important to use HTTPS?

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.076 A:middle
Well, it's essentially,
it comes down to this:

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:52.586 A:middle
your customers trust you with
their data and their privacy.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.596 A:middle
And we at Apple, we really want
to work together with you guys

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:59.866 A:middle
to make sure that we build
upon and maintain that trust.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:01.146 A:middle
And today, I'm proud

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:03.556 A:middle
to introduce App
Transport Security.

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:08.726 A:middle
Now, App Transport Security
is a new feature from Apple

00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
in iOS 9 and OS X, El Capitan.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:17.366 A:middle
And essentially, at its core
it helps prevent accidental

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.736 A:middle
disclosure of sensitive
customer data.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:26.186 A:middle
Now, ATS also strengthens the
default policy of NSURL Session.

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:30.826 A:middle
And perhaps the most important
aspect of that strengthening is

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:33.436 A:middle
that now NSURL Session,
by default,

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:36.266 A:middle
will disallow cleartext
HTTP loads.

00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:38.776 A:middle
It'll only use HTTPS
connections.

00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:41.466 A:middle
Now, these connections that
it does make uses today's

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
best practices.

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:46.226 A:middle
So ATS places restrictions
on TLS versions,

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:49.776 A:middle
cipher suites used,
certificate trusts,

00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:52.756 A:middle
and certificate key sizes that
are used in that transaction.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:59.066 A:middle
Now ATS is simply configured
via your apps Info.plist.

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
And you can see an example here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
And you can see an example here.

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
Essentially what we
are asking you to do is

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:08.346 A:middle
to declare your intended network
behavior within your app.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:15.216 A:middle
So at its core, ATS wants you to
really describe what you intend

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:19.016 A:middle
to do with the network, and we
really want you to worry less

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.646 A:middle
about the security of your
app and rely more heavily

00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:23.406 A:middle
on the system to
do the right thing.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.216 A:middle
So describing your network
transaction is, of course,

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:28.836 A:middle
easiest when it's all secure.

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:34.956 A:middle
So if your app exclusively
uses secure connections,

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.266 A:middle
and they only use best
practice properties,

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:39.386 A:middle
then there's nothing
else you have to do

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.526 A:middle
to configure ATS
within your app.

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:45.426 A:middle
So if you are writing a
new app, this is exactly

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:48.606 A:middle
where we want you to start,
and if you have an existing app

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:50.046 A:middle
or you are supporting
legacy code,

00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:54.796 A:middle
this is where you
should aim to be.

00:06:55.056 --> 00:07:00.546 A:middle
Now, we understand that this
may not be always the case


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:55.056 --> 00:07:00.546 A:middle
Now, we understand that this
may not be always the case

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:02.016 A:middle
that you have a server
that can comply

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:06.506 A:middle
with these new restrictions on
TLS versions or cipher suites,

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:11.136 A:middle
so we allowed that to --
through the use of exceptions.

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:14.976 A:middle
And essentially, with ATS
you can declare exceptions

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:18.606 A:middle
and let us know what versions
of TLS you want to use,

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:19.386 A:middle
or if you want to opt

00:07:19.386 --> 00:07:21.686 A:middle
out of forward secrecy,
or other options.

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:24.956 A:middle
Now, we do understand

00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:27.896 A:middle
that existing apps may
have different constraints.

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:32.686 A:middle
Let's say for the most part
you do use secure connections,

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:37.346 A:middle
but in some cases,
you have servers

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:41.556 A:middle
that just don't support
HTTPS or the best practices.

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:44.306 A:middle
So, for example, if
you have a media server

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.856 A:middle
that doesn't support
HTTPS and only HTTP,

00:07:46.856 --> 00:07:52.046 A:middle
you can easily describe this
behavior using an exception.

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:56.736 A:middle
Essentially all you have to do
is declare which domain needs

00:07:56.736 --> 00:08:00.256 A:middle
to load over HTTP and NSURL
Session will still allow


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.736 --> 00:08:00.256 A:middle
to load over HTTP and NSURL
Session will still allow

00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
that cleartext load.

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:06.556 A:middle
Now we also know that some

00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:09.116 A:middle
of you may be supporting a
general purpose web browser

00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:13.006 A:middle
or another app that loads URLs
based off dynamic user input,

00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:14.946 A:middle
and we've allowed for that case.

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:19.656 A:middle
In this case here, you can't
possibly describe what secure

00:08:19.656 --> 00:08:22.876 A:middle
connections you need ahead of
time, and so you can simply opt

00:08:22.876 --> 00:08:25.606 A:middle
out by declaring an
allow-all policy.

00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:31.446 A:middle
Now the allow-all policy can
be used to allow NSURL Session

00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:35.366 A:middle
to load any HTTP
or HTTPS resource.

00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:40.076 A:middle
Now, do note that this is
a useful tool for debugging

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:42.236 A:middle
that I believe is already
out on the Internet.

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:46.486 A:middle
So we ask, if you do
use it for debugging,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:48.826 A:middle
to do it temporarily
for obvious reasons.

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.836 A:middle
Now, even if you
are in this state,

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:56.476 A:middle
you can still protect
specific servers and domains.

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.676 A:middle
So you are in this state where
you are allowing everything,

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:01.466 A:middle
but you have your
own servers, say,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:01.466 A:middle
but you have your
own servers, say,

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:04.526 A:middle
that you pull the configuration
data from or metadata from,

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:08.636 A:middle
and to do this, again, is
just an exception within ATS.

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:13.166 A:middle
You simply declare this domain
that you want to protect

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:16.046 A:middle
as an exception to
the allow-all policy.

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:19.426 A:middle
And this will allow
NSURL Session to continue

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:23.016 A:middle
to protect this resource
by only loading over HTTPS

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:25.256 A:middle
and with best practices.

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:32.546 A:middle
Now, the SDK has been
out since Monday,

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:36.066 A:middle
and there's probably
a few of you that woke

00:09:36.066 --> 00:09:39.526 A:middle
up at this awful hour, just to
find out what ATS is all about

00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.416 A:middle
and why your network
loads are failing.

00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:45.006 A:middle
Well, we understand that and we
want to work together with you

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:47.276 A:middle
to get you up and running.

00:09:48.976 --> 00:09:52.706 A:middle
So, do note that ATS is
only active if you build

00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:53.736 A:middle
against a current SDK.

00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:56.616 A:middle
If you are targeting
the previous release,

00:09:57.066 --> 00:10:00.716 A:middle
ATS rules do not apply.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.066 --> 00:10:00.716 A:middle
ATS rules do not apply.

00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:06.756 A:middle
NSURL Session will transfer all
HTTP resources or loads URLs

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:08.926 A:middle
to HTTPS automatically.

00:10:09.516 --> 00:10:14.826 A:middle
And, again, as I said earlier,
some of you already know

00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:18.466 A:middle
about the allow-all key, and we
ask you to use this temporarily

00:10:18.676 --> 00:10:22.346 A:middle
to find out if the new network
failures in your app are

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:24.096 A:middle
because of ATS or not.

00:10:24.356 --> 00:10:28.346 A:middle
And this will kind of help
you narrow things down.

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:32.336 A:middle
So the next step, if
you allow-all ATS loads,

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:36.256 A:middle
or allow-all loads,
and you've determined

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:39.336 A:middle
that the problem is ATS,
the next step would be

00:10:39.336 --> 00:10:42.396 A:middle
to log the NSURL Session
errors that you are seeing,

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
so you can try to
determine and narrow

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.076 A:middle
down which load is
actually failing,

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:48.546 A:middle
and what the underlying
error is.

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:55.216 A:middle
There is also a great debugging
tool that's an environment

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:57.506 A:middle
variable known as CF
Network Diagnostics.

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:01.186 A:middle
If you set CF Network
Diagnostics to level 1,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:01.186 A:middle
If you set CF Network
Diagnostics to level 1,

00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:04.036 A:middle
all the failing URL loads --

00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:07.206 A:middle
so, all the loads that
failed will log the URLs

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:09.426 A:middle
and the underlying TLS error.

00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:12.376 A:middle
And so what you can do
in the next step is take

00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:16.406 A:middle
that underlying TLS error, and
look up and secure transport.h,

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:20.336 A:middle
and see exactly what
the underlying issue is.

00:11:21.026 --> 00:11:24.036 A:middle
Usually it's a failure in
negotiation between client

00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:26.156 A:middle
and server at the TLS layer.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:34.196 A:middle
So now, do understand
that this is a new API,

00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:35.946 A:middle
and it's still under
development.

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:38.826 A:middle
So we strongly encourage
you guys to pay attention

00:11:38.826 --> 00:11:43.056 A:middle
to the seed notes and
release notes, and also,

00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:46.576 A:middle
please file radars so
we can track any issues

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:48.326 A:middle
that you guys are hitting

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:55.146 A:middle
and help you guys
get up and running.

00:11:55.766 --> 00:11:57.336 A:middle
So I hope it's clear
that the time

00:11:57.336 --> 00:11:58.636 A:middle
for secure networking is now.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
And we really want to
work with you in order


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
And we really want to
work with you in order

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:03.056 A:middle
to protect your customers' data.

00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:09.696 A:middle
So, again, if you are writing
a new app, start with HTTPS

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.306 A:middle
and try to get your
servers up and running

00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:14.796 A:middle
with the best practices.

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:20.056 A:middle
Now, for those of you
with existing apps,

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:24.016 A:middle
we ask that you first start by
moving what you can to HTTPS,

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.946 A:middle
and for the places where
you can't, go ahead

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:29.036 A:middle
and use the exceptions
that are available

00:12:29.336 --> 00:12:30.906 A:middle
through your Info.plist.

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:35.336 A:middle
Now, do keep in mind that
your customers trust you

00:12:35.946 --> 00:12:39.856 A:middle
with their data, and it is
truly sensitive in all cases.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:42.266 A:middle
And so Apple wants to
work together with you

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:45.886 A:middle
to provide a more secure
environment for your customers.

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:50.536 A:middle
So, again, please give
us feedback via radar,

00:12:51.156 --> 00:12:54.006 A:middle
come see us down at the lab
after this session and tomorrow.

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:57.316 A:middle
We really want to work with
you to protect our customers.

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:01.336 A:middle
Thank you all for being here and
I will be followed up by Andreas


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:01.336 A:middle
Thank you all for being here and
I will be followed up by Andreas

00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:03.936 A:middle
who will talk about new protocol
support and NSURL Session.

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:05.276 A:middle
Have a great conference.

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:10.936 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:12.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ANDREAS GARKUSCHA:
Thanks, Luke.

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:16.316 A:middle
Good morning, everyone!

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:18.576 A:middle
My name is Andreas
and I'm going to talk

00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:21.186 A:middle
about new protocol
support in NSURL Session.

00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:30.436 A:middle
Yes, NSURL Session
supports HTTP/2 protocol.

00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:35.056 A:middle
Your apps are ready to
communicate using HTTP/2

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:37.296 A:middle
and it's very easy to adopt.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:40.496 A:middle
Let me play it one more time.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:41.826 A:middle
All right!

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:45.786 A:middle
If you are already using
NSURL Session in your code,

00:13:46.146 --> 00:13:48.726 A:middle
you are automatically
a part of all of that.

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:51.416 A:middle
Future of the web,
major milestone

00:13:51.416 --> 00:13:54.606 A:middle
in the web's evolution, your
apps are running faster.

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.986 A:middle
You don't need to
change your source code.

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:58.766 A:middle
Everything works automatically.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
So today, we are going to
talk about three things.

00:14:05.616 --> 00:14:09.286 A:middle
Why do we need a new protocol
and what are the common problems

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.426 A:middle
of the current HTTP/1.1
protocol?

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:17.776 A:middle
We will learn about the most
important HTTP/2 features.

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:20.656 A:middle
And finally, we will talk

00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:26.546 A:middle
about HTTP/2 protocol
adoption in your apps.

00:14:27.656 --> 00:14:29.876 A:middle
So, why another new protocol?

00:14:31.716 --> 00:14:34.746 A:middle
We already have a
lot of protocols

00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:36.826 A:middle
for every kind of communication.

00:14:37.686 --> 00:14:39.096 A:middle
The reason is that most

00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:42.636 A:middle
of the protocols were
designed many years ago

00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:44.236 A:middle
for the needs of their time.

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:49.916 A:middle
Look at one of the
first Apple websites.

00:14:51.216 --> 00:14:54.186 A:middle
Today's needs look
significantly different

00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:56.726 A:middle
than those 15 years ago.

00:14:57.236 --> 00:14:58.776 A:middle
So it is time for an update.

00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
HTTP has been around since
the beginning of the web,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
HTTP has been around since
the beginning of the web,

00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:06.746 A:middle
and it is not a secret
that it has many issues.

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:11.026 A:middle
The most famous HTTP
issue is the problem

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:14.526 A:middle
of only one outstanding
request per TCP connection.

00:15:16.546 --> 00:15:19.146 A:middle
The solution for this
was HTTP pipelining,

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:22.706 A:middle
but HTTP pipelining
is not available

00:15:22.706 --> 00:15:24.136 A:middle
on all servers or networks.

00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:29.326 A:middle
In fact, it's disabled on most
popular desktop web browsers.

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:34.866 A:middle
Another solution was to open
multiple connections to a host.

00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:39.166 A:middle
This could help to fetch
multiple resources faster,

00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:43.606 A:middle
but together with other things
like textual protocol overhead,

00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:47.426 A:middle
the lack of header
compression, it just adds

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:51.296 A:middle
up to higher system requirements
and lower performance

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:58.216 A:middle
on both the client
and the server.

00:15:58.386 --> 00:16:01.576 A:middle
Last year, we introduced SPDY
Support in NSURL Session.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.386 --> 00:16:01.576 A:middle
Last year, we introduced SPDY
Support in NSURL Session.

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.876 A:middle
SPDY was an attempt to
make the web faster.

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:09.896 A:middle
It was an experimental
protocol, however, it was chosen

00:16:10.326 --> 00:16:12.896 A:middle
as a basis for a
new version of HTTP.

00:16:13.636 --> 00:16:18.086 A:middle
The specification for the
new protocol version went

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:20.686 A:middle
through the IETF
standardization,

00:16:20.956 --> 00:16:24.566 A:middle
and officially got an RFC
number assigned last month.

00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:30.476 A:middle
So today, as you already know,
NSURL Session is extended

00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:33.646 A:middle
to support HTTP/2 protocol.

00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:37.736 A:middle
Let's take a look at
the key differences

00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:40.546 A:middle
between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

00:16:41.856 --> 00:16:43.766 A:middle
As opposed to HTTP/1.1,

00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:48.096 A:middle
HTTP/2 opens only one
TCP connection to a host.

00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:52.756 A:middle
It's network friendly and
requires less system resources

00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:57.016 A:middle
on both the client
and the server.

00:16:57.836 --> 00:17:00.186 A:middle
HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.836 --> 00:17:00.186 A:middle
HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed.

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:04.415 A:middle
That means that a new
request does not need to wait

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:06.915 A:middle
until the server
sends the response

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:08.066 A:middle
for the previous request.

00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:12.826 A:middle
HTTP/2 has request priorities,

00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:16.496 A:middle
so that more important
resources can be delivered

00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:20.675 A:middle
at a higher priority
to the client.

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:28.386 A:middle
Let's take a look at how HTTP/2
multiplexing resolves the

00:17:28.386 --> 00:17:30.696 A:middle
Head-of-Line Blocking problem.

00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:35.406 A:middle
We have three requests for
resources on a web server.

00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:40.856 A:middle
We sent out the first
request and we get a response.

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:45.076 A:middle
Only after this, we can
send out the second request

00:17:46.016 --> 00:17:47.396 A:middle
and get the second response.

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:50.996 A:middle
Same happens with
the third request.

00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:58.586 A:middle
Now, with pipelining enabled, we
can send out all the requests,

00:17:59.206 --> 00:18:01.726 A:middle
one after another,
without waiting


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.206 --> 00:18:01.726 A:middle
one after another,
without waiting

00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:03.516 A:middle
for the previous
responses to arrive.

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:09.636 A:middle
But we still get the
responses in the same order.

00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:13.796 A:middle
And you see that the first
response for the image in blue,

00:18:15.236 --> 00:18:17.096 A:middle
blocks the following
two responses.

00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:23.626 A:middle
With HTTP/2, we have
the same three requests,

00:18:24.426 --> 00:18:25.576 A:middle
with different priorities.

00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:30.846 A:middle
We still can send out all the
requests at the beginning,

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:37.946 A:middle
but we are receiving all the
responses at the same time.

00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:42.076 A:middle
Moreover, the requests
with the higher priority,

00:18:43.486 --> 00:18:45.646 A:middle
I get and deliver
faster to the client.

00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:52.846 A:middle
You see that the second
response was a medium priority

00:18:52.846 --> 00:18:56.606 A:middle
and the third response for
request was a high priority,

00:18:57.306 --> 00:19:01.346 A:middle
arrived prior to the first
response even though they were


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.306 --> 00:19:01.346 A:middle
arrived prior to the first
response even though they were

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:02.206 A:middle
scheduled later.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.266 A:middle
The image does not block them
anymore and this is great.

00:19:06.606 --> 00:19:08.786 A:middle
Great for your applications
and the performance.

00:19:10.606 --> 00:19:12.736 A:middle
Let's continue with
the comparison.

00:19:13.376 --> 00:19:18.206 A:middle
HTTP/2 is a binary protocol.

00:19:20.476 --> 00:19:24.916 A:middle
That makes data processing
and parsing faster.

00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:30.006 A:middle
HTTP/1.1 does not use
header compression.

00:19:30.656 --> 00:19:33.546 A:middle
SPDY also could not
use header compression

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:35.406 A:middle
because of a security exploit.

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:40.376 A:middle
HTTP/2 uses HPACK, a
more secure mechanism

00:19:40.376 --> 00:19:41.386 A:middle
for header compression.

00:19:42.566 --> 00:19:44.966 A:middle
Let's talk about HPACK.

00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
HPACK header compression
is based on two tables,

00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:53.746 A:middle
a static table and
a dynamic one.

00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:59.146 A:middle
The static table contains
the most used HTTP headers

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.766 A:middle
and is unchangeable.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.766 A:middle
and is unchangeable.

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:06.776 A:middle
The headers, which are not
included in the static table,

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:08.876 A:middle
can be added to the
dynamic table.

00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:13.516 A:middle
The headers from the tables
can be referenced by index.

00:20:15.246 --> 00:20:19.476 A:middle
As an example, you see a
simple HTTP/1.1 request.

00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:26.986 A:middle
Highlighted is the data which is
going to be sent to the server.

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:30.736 A:middle
And here's HTTP/2 representation
of the same request.

00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:33.566 A:middle
So let's encode this request.

00:20:35.396 --> 00:20:42.046 A:middle
The pseudo headers,
method, scheme, and path,

00:20:43.386 --> 00:20:46.016 A:middle
can be referenced
using the static table.

00:20:47.756 --> 00:20:51.196 A:middle
The authority header is
included in the static table,

00:20:51.326 --> 00:20:52.626 A:middle
but without its value.

00:20:53.696 --> 00:20:58.456 A:middle
So to encode this request,
we need three bytes

00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:02.546 A:middle
for the first three headers,
plus an additional byte,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:02.546 A:middle
for the first three headers,
plus an additional byte,

00:21:03.356 --> 00:21:07.466 A:middle
which tells that we want
to add the authority header

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:10.446 A:middle
to the dynamic table
and the value

00:21:10.446 --> 00:21:13.086 A:middle
of the authority
with its length.

00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:18.706 A:middle
And this is what
is going to be sent

00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:24.166 A:middle
to the server plus additional
overhead for the header frame.

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:28.056 A:middle
Now with the second request,

00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:31.966 A:middle
and you see that the
authority header goes

00:21:32.006 --> 00:21:32.946 A:middle
in the dynamic table.

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:35.196 A:middle
So with the second request,

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:41.346 A:middle
HTTP/1.1 would send the same
headers over and over again.

00:21:43.586 --> 00:21:46.966 A:middle
In HTTP/2 case, in
that particular case,

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:51.306 A:middle
we can reference all the
headers using the static

00:21:51.306 --> 00:21:53.226 A:middle
and the dynamic table.

00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:55.586 A:middle
We are using only one
byte for each header.

00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:57.926 A:middle
It is a huge savings
of the bandwidth

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.926 A:middle
and it's remarkable how
few bytes are needed


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.926 A:middle
and it's remarkable how
few bytes are needed

00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:09.376 A:middle
to encode a request or
response header in HTTP/2.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:11.966 A:middle
So let's talk about
what you need

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:14.636 A:middle
to adopt HTTP/2 protocol
in your apps.

00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:18.786 A:middle
There's not much work to do.

00:22:18.786 --> 00:22:22.256 A:middle
HTTP/2 protocol is
seamlessly integrated

00:22:22.296 --> 00:22:23.836 A:middle
into NSURL Session API.

00:22:25.356 --> 00:22:30.426 A:middle
If you are already using NSURL
Session in your code, your apps

00:22:30.426 --> 00:22:34.536 A:middle
and OS X programs will get this
functionality automatically.

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:38.216 A:middle
You will not need to
write any new code

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:43.796 A:middle
or provide any additional
configuration to turn it on.

00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:46.396 A:middle
Let's take a look at
the source code example.

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.126 A:middle
This source code looks exactly

00:22:49.126 --> 00:22:51.646 A:middle
like the code you guys
already have in your apps.

00:22:52.126 --> 00:22:55.956 A:middle
You see, there's no difference,
no new configuration flags.

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.856 A:middle
It just works.

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:05.546 A:middle
[Chuckles]


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:05.546 A:middle
[Chuckles]

00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:10.006 A:middle
Yes, you only need
an HTTP/2 server.

00:23:11.776 --> 00:23:12.526 A:middle
But it's okay.

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:16.526 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:18.396 A:middle
Your apps are ready

00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:22.126 A:middle
to communicate using
HTTP/2 protocol.

00:23:22.576 --> 00:23:25.626 A:middle
If you do not deploy
an HTTP/2 server yet,

00:23:26.686 --> 00:23:30.776 A:middle
then your apps will
use HTTP/1.1 directly,

00:23:31.506 --> 00:23:35.096 A:middle
or the best available protocol
will be selected automatically

00:23:35.096 --> 00:23:36.496 A:middle
for the network communication.

00:23:37.276 --> 00:23:41.046 A:middle
Once you start using a web
server which supports HTTP/2,

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:43.916 A:middle
there is no additional
work needed.

00:23:44.726 --> 00:23:50.926 A:middle
Your apps will use HTTP/2
protocol automatically.

00:23:56.536 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
Please keep in mind that NSURL
Session supports HTTP/2 protocol


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:56.536 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
Please keep in mind that NSURL
Session supports HTTP/2 protocol

00:24:01.446 --> 00:24:03.586 A:middle
only over an encrypted
connection.

00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:10.596 A:middle
And that your HTTP/2 server
requires to support ALPN or NPN

00:24:11.026 --> 00:24:12.286 A:middle
for protocol negotiation.

00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:21.036 A:middle
Currently at Apple, HomeKit
remote access via iCloud is

00:24:21.036 --> 00:24:23.826 A:middle
using HTTP/2 protocol
for communication

00:24:23.826 --> 00:24:27.806 A:middle
between HomeKit accessories
and iCloud.

00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:32.166 A:middle
Many big companies are
already using HTTP/2 protocol.

00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:35.176 A:middle
Google provides its
services in HTTP/2.

00:24:35.916 --> 00:24:38.236 A:middle
Twitter is using HTTP/2 as well.

00:24:39.406 --> 00:24:43.456 A:middle
There are many HTTP/2 open
source web servers out there,

00:24:44.326 --> 00:24:48.286 A:middle
and finally, some CDN
service providers are working

00:24:48.516 --> 00:24:51.016 A:middle
on the HTTP/2 protocol
support today.

00:24:54.736 --> 00:24:58.116 A:middle
We worked hard to provide
HTTP/2 protocol support

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
in NSURL Session so
that you guys can adopt


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
in NSURL Session so
that you guys can adopt

00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:03.276 A:middle
and use it as easy as possible.

00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:07.676 A:middle
HTTP/2 is available
today in WWDC seed.

00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:11.936 A:middle
It's seamlessly integrated
into NSURL Session API

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:17.826 A:middle
and it's enabled in Safari,
on OS X, 10.11, and iOS 9.

00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:20.096 A:middle
Thank you.

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.816 A:middle
And now I would like to
invite Dan up to the stage.

00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:23.976 A:middle
Dan?

00:25:24.516 --> 00:25:31.126 A:middle
[Applause]

00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:32.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAN VINEGRAD: Good
morning, everyone.

00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:33.756 A:middle
My name is Dan.

00:25:33.756 --> 00:25:36.306 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on
the CF Network team at Apple,

00:25:36.306 --> 00:25:37.786 A:middle
and the first thing
I would like to talk

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:40.656 A:middle
about today is using
NSURL Session on watchOS.

00:25:42.266 --> 00:25:46.076 A:middle
With the WatchKit SDK that was
released alongside watchOS 2

00:25:46.076 --> 00:25:48.496 A:middle
in beta earlier this
week, I'm pleased to say

00:25:48.496 --> 00:25:51.506 A:middle
that HTTPS loads are fully
supported on watchOS.

00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:54.326 A:middle
And this means that
everything we've already talked

00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:57.766 A:middle
about today, like App
Transport Security and HTTP/2,

00:25:57.766 --> 00:25:58.816 A:middle
are built into this support.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:04.296 A:middle
One major difference between
using NSURL Session on watchOS

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:07.316 A:middle
and using it on other platforms
is that underneath the hood,

00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.156 A:middle
we actually will use the best
connectivity mechanism that's

00:26:10.156 --> 00:26:11.606 A:middle
available to us at the time.

00:26:12.016 --> 00:26:14.026 A:middle
And this means that
in most circumstances,

00:26:14.396 --> 00:26:17.766 A:middle
if the users' watch is nearby
their paired iPhone device,

00:26:18.196 --> 00:26:20.656 A:middle
then we will actually leverage
the Bluetooth connection

00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:24.496 A:middle
between them, perform the HTTP
loads on the phone itself,

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:27.196 A:middle
and deliver the results back
to the watch over Bluetooth.

00:26:28.366 --> 00:26:31.026 A:middle
If the user happens to be out
and away from their phone,

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:33.116 A:middle
but with their watch, and
the watch is connected

00:26:33.116 --> 00:26:35.706 A:middle
to a known Wi-Fi network,
then we can actually use

00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:37.026 A:middle
that Wi-Fi network directly.

00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:39.366 A:middle
But the good news for you is

00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:42.356 A:middle
that this is all abstracted
away from the API itself.

00:26:42.356 --> 00:26:45.066 A:middle
You can use the API just as you
have been on other platforms.

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:46.786 A:middle
You don't need to worry
about how we are connecting.

00:26:47.056 --> 00:26:50.096 A:middle
It just works like magic.

00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:53.256 A:middle
So, with that said, there are
a few best practices and things

00:26:53.256 --> 00:26:55.976 A:middle
to keep in mind when using
NSURL Session on watchOS.

00:26:56.706 --> 00:26:58.506 A:middle
The first is that
you should really try

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
to just download the
minimal size assets


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
to just download the
minimal size assets

00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:02.746 A:middle
that are actually required
for your app to function.

00:27:03.376 --> 00:27:06.956 A:middle
Keep in mind that the watch
has a very small screen.

00:27:07.166 --> 00:27:09.196 A:middle
So if you are downloading
images you don't really need

00:27:09.196 --> 00:27:12.056 A:middle
to download the full resolution
images that you would want

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:15.346 A:middle
to display on an iPhone 6 Plus
or a Mac with a retina display.

00:27:15.716 --> 00:27:18.276 A:middle
The screen's a lot smaller; you
can download smaller images.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:23.276 A:middle
And also keep in mind that the
watch has a lot less processing

00:27:23.276 --> 00:27:25.726 A:middle
power than a phone or a Mac,

00:27:26.576 --> 00:27:29.136 A:middle
and additionally will often
be limited by the bandwidth

00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:30.206 A:middle
and latency constraints

00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:31.786 A:middle
of the Bluetooth
connection to your phone.

00:27:32.006 --> 00:27:34.306 A:middle
So we're not really going to be
able to get you bytes as quickly

00:27:34.306 --> 00:27:35.916 A:middle
to the watch as we would
on other platforms.

00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:38.656 A:middle
So keep that in mind as well.

00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:43.026 A:middle
Another thing to note is that
apps on watch will generally run

00:27:43.026 --> 00:27:45.526 A:middle
for a much shorter period
of time than iPhone apps

00:27:45.526 --> 00:27:46.796 A:middle
or definitely Mac apps.

00:27:47.196 --> 00:27:49.266 A:middle
You will mostly be limited
by how long the user wants

00:27:49.266 --> 00:27:51.436 A:middle
to sit there standing with
his wrist raised staring

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:52.956 A:middle
at the watch and
interacting with it.

00:27:53.966 --> 00:27:57.046 A:middle
So if you are using a
default session configuration

00:27:57.046 --> 00:27:59.656 A:middle
or an ephemeral session
configuration, keep in mind

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:03.646 A:middle
that these networking transfers
will happen only while your app


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:03.646 A:middle
that these networking transfers
will happen only while your app

00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:05.726 A:middle
is actually running.

00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:08.136 A:middle
So this is totally fine if
you are sending small amounts

00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:10.546 A:middle
of data like fetching stock
quotes or weather data

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:12.586 A:middle
or social network
status updates,

00:28:13.106 --> 00:28:16.036 A:middle
but for any larger content
like videos, for instance,

00:28:16.036 --> 00:28:18.156 A:middle
you 'll want to use
background uploads or downloads,

00:28:18.156 --> 00:28:19.546 A:middle
which can continue

00:28:19.546 --> 00:28:22.036 A:middle
out of process while your
app is no longer running.

00:28:22.316 --> 00:28:23.806 A:middle
And for more information
on background uploads

00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:25.536 A:middle
and downloads, I highly
encourage you to check

00:28:25.536 --> 00:28:27.326 A:middle
out the WWDC sessions

00:28:27.326 --> 00:28:29.316 A:middle
on Foundation Networking
from previous years.

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:35.836 A:middle
Next up, I would like to
talk about some API changes

00:28:35.836 --> 00:28:37.476 A:middle
that we have made in
this year's releases.

00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:40.966 A:middle
The first thing I would like to
talk about is NSURL Connection,

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:42.876 A:middle
something we have not
talked about today so far.

00:28:43.466 --> 00:28:44.946 A:middle
So, this year, I'm announcing

00:28:44.946 --> 00:28:47.626 A:middle
that NSURL Connection
is deprecated on OS X,

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:49.196 A:middle
El Capitan, and iOS 9.

00:28:50.216 --> 00:28:52.596 A:middle
And let's just take a moment
to think about what that means.

00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:54.126 A:middle
Deprecation does not mean

00:28:54.126 --> 00:28:56.706 A:middle
that NSURL Connection
is going away entirely.

00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:58.776 A:middle
We know that there are
a lot of apps out there

00:28:58.776 --> 00:29:00.046 A:middle
that are using NSURL Connection,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.776 --> 00:29:00.046 A:middle
that are using NSURL Connection,

00:29:00.246 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
and we're not just
going to break them.

00:29:01.956 --> 00:29:02.886 A:middle
So it will still work.

00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
Those transfers will still
work, but keep in mind

00:29:05.716 --> 00:29:08.386 A:middle
that new features are really
only going to be added

00:29:08.386 --> 00:29:09.866 A:middle
to NSURL Session at this point.

00:29:09.866 --> 00:29:14.866 A:middle
We highly encourage you to
switch over existing code

00:29:15.156 --> 00:29:18.146 A:middle
from NSURL Connection to NSURL
Session if you haven't already,

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:22.206 A:middle
and if you are writing new
code, we would really hope

00:29:22.206 --> 00:29:24.356 A:middle
that you would only use NSURL
Session and not Connection.

00:29:25.046 --> 00:29:26.846 A:middle
Another thing to keep in mind is

00:29:26.846 --> 00:29:30.086 A:middle
that NSURL Connection is not
supported at all on watchOS.

00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:31.996 A:middle
So if you need to
load HTTP content

00:29:31.996 --> 00:29:34.706 A:middle
from a WatchKit extension,
you have to use NSURL Session.

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:37.556 A:middle
But luckily for you, if you
haven't done so already,

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.236 A:middle
switching from NSURL Connection

00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:40.916 A:middle
to NSURL Session is
actually very easy.

00:29:41.236 --> 00:29:44.596 A:middle
So I would like to walk
through an example of that now.

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:47.036 A:middle
Here's a simple use
of NSURL Connection

00:29:47.096 --> 00:29:49.246 A:middle
to perform an asynchronous
HTTP request,

00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.326 A:middle
which probably looks similar
to the things that a lot

00:29:51.326 --> 00:29:53.346 A:middle
of you have in your apps.

00:29:53.346 --> 00:29:57.926 A:middle
Here, we're connecting to
www.example.com over HTTPS,

00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:00.356 A:middle
and we have an NSURL
object to represent that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:00.356 A:middle
and we have an NSURL
object to represent that.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:04.806 A:middle
We then construct an
NSURLRequest, wrapping that URL,

00:30:05.686 --> 00:30:08.766 A:middle
and we use NSURL Connection's
'send asynchronous request'

00:30:08.766 --> 00:30:11.966 A:middle
method to fire off that
request asynchronously.

00:30:12.536 --> 00:30:16.886 A:middle
And we receive the result
in the form of this closure,

00:30:16.886 --> 00:30:20.316 A:middle
which includes an NSURL Response
object representing the HTTP

00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:23.636 A:middle
response headers that are
received, an NSData object

00:30:23.636 --> 00:30:26.366 A:middle
for the response body
data, and an error

00:30:26.766 --> 00:30:28.196 A:middle
if a transmission
error occurred.

00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:30.916 A:middle
So let's take a look
at what that would look

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.236 A:middle
like with NSURL Session.

00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:34.556 A:middle
It's very similar.

00:30:34.726 --> 00:30:36.846 A:middle
You will notice that the NSURL

00:30:36.846 --> 00:30:39.736 A:middle
and NSURL request objects are
still in use and this is true

00:30:39.736 --> 00:30:42.756 A:middle
for a lot of the other
NSURL family of objects,

00:30:42.756 --> 00:30:46.136 A:middle
like NSURL Credential Storage
and NSHTTP Cookie Storage.

00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:48.596 A:middle
The main difference
here is that instead

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.946 A:middle
of using NSURL Connection

00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:51.876 A:middle
to send an asynchronous
request method,

00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:55.326 A:middle
we are using the 'data
task with request' method

00:30:55.546 --> 00:30:58.396 A:middle
on the NSURL Session
shared session.

00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:02.866 A:middle
Then once we resume the task, we
would again receive the results


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:02.866 A:middle
Then once we resume the task, we
would again receive the results

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:05.056 A:middle
of that transaction,
asynchronously,

00:31:05.056 --> 00:31:08.626 A:middle
in the form of the response
data, the response headers,

00:31:08.626 --> 00:31:11.166 A:middle
and an error if a
transmission error occurred.

00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:15.796 A:middle
So that's how easy it is to
switch from NSURL Connection

00:31:15.796 --> 00:31:17.786 A:middle
into NSURL Session in your apps.

00:31:18.976 --> 00:31:20.796 A:middle
So, next I would like
to switch gears and talk

00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:22.356 A:middle
about some new additions
that we've added

00:31:22.356 --> 00:31:24.936 A:middle
to the NSURL Session
family of APIs this year.

00:31:25.856 --> 00:31:29.026 A:middle
The first thing I would like to
talk about deals with cookies.

00:31:29.926 --> 00:31:34.136 A:middle
Last year at WWDC we introduced
a great new feature called app

00:31:34.136 --> 00:31:36.596 A:middle
extensions, which
lets you embed parts

00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:38.636 A:middle
of your app's functionality
other places on the system

00:31:38.636 --> 00:31:39.846 A:middle
like notification center.

00:31:40.886 --> 00:31:45.966 A:middle
But applications and their
extensions have different data

00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:48.076 A:middle
containers by default,
which means that even

00:31:48.076 --> 00:31:49.466 A:middle
if you are using NSURL Session

00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:52.766 A:middle
and already leveraging our
great built-in cookie handling

00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:54.996 A:middle
support, those cookies
are actually being stored

00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:55.856 A:middle
in different places.

00:31:56.386 --> 00:32:00.076 A:middle
But you can use what's
called an application group


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.386 --> 00:32:00.076 A:middle
But you can use what's
called an application group

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:03.106 A:middle
to actually get access to
a shared data container,

00:32:03.106 --> 00:32:05.496 A:middle
which both your app and
its extensions can access.

00:32:06.066 --> 00:32:08.016 A:middle
And this year we have
introduced new API

00:32:08.016 --> 00:32:10.686 A:middle
to let you create a
cookie storage associated

00:32:10.686 --> 00:32:11.646 A:middle
with that group container.

00:32:11.646 --> 00:32:14.186 A:middle
And I would like to
show you how to do that.

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:19.176 A:middle
So what you want to use here
is NSHTTP cookie storage's new

00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:21.996 A:middle
'shared cookie storage for group
container identifier' method.

00:32:22.586 --> 00:32:26.456 A:middle
And you just simply create a
cookie storage with the passing

00:32:26.456 --> 00:32:28.226 A:middle
in the name of your
application group,

00:32:28.226 --> 00:32:31.316 A:middle
and application groups can be
configured while editing your

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:33.096 A:middle
project's build settings
in Xcode and going

00:32:33.096 --> 00:32:34.186 A:middle
to the Capabilities tab.

00:32:35.616 --> 00:32:39.076 A:middle
Once you've created the cookie
storage, you just need to set it

00:32:39.076 --> 00:32:40.816 A:middle
as the HTTP cookie
storage property

00:32:41.036 --> 00:32:43.326 A:middle
on an NSURL Session
configuration object,

00:32:43.976 --> 00:32:46.496 A:middle
create an NSURL Session
from that configuration,

00:32:46.536 --> 00:32:49.906 A:middle
and then any tasks that you
create in that session will use

00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:55.396 A:middle
that cookie storage in
the group container.

00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:58.596 A:middle
So for the entirety of
the presentations today,

00:32:58.596 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
we have been talking about using
NSURL Session in the context


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.596 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
we have been talking about using
NSURL Session in the context

00:33:01.776 --> 00:33:03.186 A:middle
of loading HTTP content.

00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:06.106 A:middle
But there are some cases

00:33:06.106 --> 00:33:10.026 A:middle
where you really need a protocol
other than HTTP or HTTPS.

00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:13.596 A:middle
So if you are implementing
a chat application,

00:33:13.976 --> 00:33:20.426 A:middle
a video calling app, or
-- or something like that,

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:23.146 A:middle
you really need -- you might
need a protocol that's not HTTP,

00:33:23.146 --> 00:33:25.856 A:middle
and you want to do
something custom directly

00:33:25.856 --> 00:33:28.246 A:middle
on top of TCP/IP networking.

00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:32.056 A:middle
So NSURL Session Stream
Task is a new API this year,

00:33:32.056 --> 00:33:33.706 A:middle
which is a Foundation
extraction,

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:35.446 A:middle
directly over a TCP connection.

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:39.686 A:middle
Now, in the past, you might
have used NSInput Stream

00:33:39.686 --> 00:33:43.366 A:middle
and NSOutput Stream to do
something similar, but we think

00:33:43.366 --> 00:33:46.396 A:middle
that NSUSRLSession Stream
Task has a few key advantages

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:48.076 A:middle
over the NSStream APIs.

00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:50.656 A:middle
First of all, it
offers a very simple,

00:33:50.656 --> 00:33:53.026 A:middle
convenient asynchronous
read and write interface,

00:33:53.776 --> 00:33:56.976 A:middle
whereas with NSStream you had
to set up a delegate to listen

00:33:56.976 --> 00:33:59.656 A:middle
for events or when to read, and
the read and writes could block,

00:33:59.656 --> 00:34:00.576 A:middle
and it was kind of a mess.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.656 --> 00:34:00.576 A:middle
and it was kind of a mess.

00:34:00.946 --> 00:34:02.506 A:middle
But this is a lot
easier and cleaner.

00:34:03.686 --> 00:34:07.126 A:middle
Secondly, NSURL Session
has great built-in support

00:34:07.126 --> 00:34:09.456 A:middle
for automatically getting
through HTTP proxies,

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:12.426 A:middle
and NSURL Session Stream Task
can leverage this support

00:34:12.426 --> 00:34:15.226 A:middle
so that you can connect
to a remote server even

00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:17.045 A:middle
if there's an HTTP
proxy between it,

00:34:17.045 --> 00:34:18.516 A:middle
and NSStream can't
really do this.

00:34:18.996 --> 00:34:21.426 A:middle
And there are a few
other new API goodies

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.045 A:middle
that I will talk
about later as well.

00:34:24.536 --> 00:34:26.896 A:middle
We also know that NSStream
is a very pervasive API.

00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:30.696 A:middle
There are a lot of other
frameworks and APIs that accept

00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:32.315 A:middle
and work with NSStream objects.

00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:35.806 A:middle
So we also have some support
to be compatible with NSStreams

00:34:35.806 --> 00:34:37.416 A:middle
as well and I will
show you that later on.

00:34:38.775 --> 00:34:42.835 A:middle
So as I said, NSURL Session
Stream Task supports TCP/IP

00:34:42.835 --> 00:34:45.896 A:middle
connections, which you
can create explicitly

00:34:45.896 --> 00:34:47.005 A:middle
with a host name and port,

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.936 A:middle
or if you are using
the NSNetService's APIs

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.766 A:middle
to discover Bonjour
services in your app,

00:34:53.766 --> 00:34:56.016 A:middle
then we can actually accept
that NSNetService and resolve

00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:57.096 A:middle
that for you automatically.

00:34:58.636 --> 00:35:02.496 A:middle
Stream Task uses the existing
NSURL Session configuration


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.636 --> 00:35:02.496 A:middle
Stream Task uses the existing
NSURL Session configuration

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:07.376 A:middle
options and delegate methods to
communicate events to you, and,

00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:10.406 A:middle
of course, we support
TLS-secured connections

00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:12.916 A:middle
and you can even dynamically
change this once you've actually

00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:14.226 A:middle
established a connection
to a server.

00:35:14.226 --> 00:35:19.366 A:middle
So let's take a look at how you
would perform a read operation

00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:21.086 A:middle
with a Stream Task.

00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:23.606 A:middle
First, to create a Stream Task
you can simply use the 'Stream

00:35:23.606 --> 00:35:26.496 A:middle
Task with Host Name
and Port' method.

00:35:26.626 --> 00:35:28.386 A:middle
And you just pass in
the host name and port

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:29.366 A:middle
that you want to connect to.

00:35:29.366 --> 00:35:32.816 A:middle
And then after resuming
the task,

00:35:32.816 --> 00:35:34.836 A:middle
you can use this 'Read
Data of Min Length,

00:35:34.836 --> 00:35:36.326 A:middle
Max Length, Timeout' method.

00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:40.406 A:middle
And what this will do is you
can pass in a range of bytes

00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:42.946 A:middle
that you want to read and a
timeout for that operation.

00:35:43.336 --> 00:35:45.716 A:middle
So if we managed to read
something within that range

00:35:45.716 --> 00:35:49.176 A:middle
or we hit an EOF, or there's a
transmission error or timeout

00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:52.056 A:middle
that occurs, we will invoke
this closure with the results.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:55.576 A:middle
Writing is very similar.

00:35:55.576 --> 00:35:58.976 A:middle
We -- unlike -- with NSStream we
can work directly with NSData,

00:35:58.976 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
you just pass in the NSData
object that you want us to write


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.976 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
you just pass in the NSData
object that you want us to write

00:36:01.206 --> 00:36:03.256 A:middle
and a timeout for that
operation, and, again,

00:36:03.526 --> 00:36:05.726 A:middle
this closure will be
invoked with a nil error

00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:08.646 A:middle
if that occurred successfully
or an error if a timeout

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.186 A:middle
or a transmission
error occurred.

00:36:11.366 --> 00:36:12.976 A:middle
Enabling TLS is as simple

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:18.946 A:middle
as calling the 'Start Secure
Connection' method on the task.

00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:21.816 A:middle
I mentioned before that we
also have some built-in support

00:36:21.816 --> 00:36:25.136 A:middle
to work with NSStream,
NSURL Session Stream Task.

00:36:25.596 --> 00:36:27.476 A:middle
So the reason we do
this is because we know

00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:29.386 A:middle
that there are a lot of
APIs out there that work

00:36:29.386 --> 00:36:31.086 A:middle
with NSStream objects
already and we want

00:36:31.086 --> 00:36:33.596 A:middle
to give you something that can
still be compatible with those.

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:37.366 A:middle
So, you can actually convert
an NSURLSession Stream Task

00:36:37.366 --> 00:36:39.566 A:middle
to NSStreams, and I will show
you the very simple code to do

00:36:39.566 --> 00:36:40.826 A:middle
that on the next slide.

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:45.136 A:middle
Just keep in mind that when you
do this, any pending async reads

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.606 A:middle
or writes that you have enqueued

00:36:46.606 --> 00:36:49.166 A:middle
on the Stream Task will
complete before we give you

00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:49.816 A:middle
the NSStreams.

00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:52.776 A:middle
And that doing this
also detaches the task

00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:53.646 A:middle
from the session.

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.096 A:middle
And so its connection,

00:36:55.306 --> 00:36:58.626 A:middle
its underlying connection will
no longer count against a limit

00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:00.986 A:middle
that you may have set on
the session's maximum number


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:00.986 A:middle
that you may have set on
the session's maximum number

00:37:00.986 --> 00:37:04.166 A:middle
of connections per host,
and it will no longer be

00:37:04.166 --> 00:37:07.726 A:middle
in the session's set
of outstanding tasks.

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:10.706 A:middle
So to convert a Stream
Task to Streams,

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:13.506 A:middle
you simply call the 'Capture
Streams' method on the Task,

00:37:14.176 --> 00:37:17.586 A:middle
and then those input streams and
output streams will be delivered

00:37:17.586 --> 00:37:19.886 A:middle
to your delegate with
a new delegate message.

00:37:21.116 --> 00:37:24.756 A:middle
We also have a few other
informational delegate messages

00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:26.796 A:middle
that we have introduced
on Stream Task.

00:37:26.856 --> 00:37:27.966 A:middle
The first is interesting.

00:37:27.966 --> 00:37:30.506 A:middle
It's a better route
discovered for Stream Task.

00:37:31.106 --> 00:37:33.376 A:middle
So let's say, you have a
Stream Task that's connected

00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:36.016 A:middle
to your server over a
cellular data connection.

00:37:36.456 --> 00:37:39.256 A:middle
If the user then
joins a Wi-Fi network,

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:41.256 A:middle
then we would deliver this
notification to your app

00:37:41.256 --> 00:37:43.176 A:middle
to tell you that there might
be a better way to connect.

00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:47.326 A:middle
And what you might want to do in
this situation, if you want to,

00:37:47.326 --> 00:37:50.236 A:middle
is tear down your existing
Stream Task and create a new one

00:37:50.626 --> 00:37:55.206 A:middle
to that host and port,
and try to connect

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.616 A:middle
over the better connection.

00:37:56.866 --> 00:37:58.486 A:middle
And we leave it up to
you to decide whether

00:37:58.486 --> 00:37:59.616 A:middle
or not you want to do this.

00:37:59.706 --> 00:38:03.026 A:middle
You know, if you are 99% of the
way through transferring a lot


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.706 --> 00:38:03.026 A:middle
You know, if you are 99% of the
way through transferring a lot

00:38:03.026 --> 00:38:04.956 A:middle
of data it might not make
sense to actually tear

00:38:04.956 --> 00:38:07.046 A:middle
down the existing connection
and create a new one.

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:10.186 A:middle
And we also have some
informational delegate methods

00:38:10.186 --> 00:38:11.816 A:middle
to tell you when to
read or write sides

00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:13.856 A:middle
of the underlying TCP
connections have been closed.

00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:19.736 A:middle
I also talked before about our
automatic support for dealing

00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:21.476 A:middle
with HTTP proxies
in Stream Task.

00:38:21.856 --> 00:38:24.596 A:middle
And the way you can do deal with
this is actually by starting

00:38:24.596 --> 00:38:27.766 A:middle
with an existing NSURL Session
Data Task, which generally deals

00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:30.706 A:middle
with HTTP content, and
converting it to a Stream Task.

00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:33.636 A:middle
And this you can do
when the response

00:38:33.636 --> 00:38:35.026 A:middle
for that Data Task is received.

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:38.526 A:middle
So to convert a Data
Task to a Stream Task,

00:38:38.526 --> 00:38:40.986 A:middle
and let you communicate
directly over the TCP connection

00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:44.696 A:middle
without the HTTP framing,
you would simply respond

00:38:44.696 --> 00:38:46.116 A:middle
to this completion handler

00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:48.156 A:middle
in the 'Did Receive
Response' delegate method

00:38:48.156 --> 00:38:50.256 A:middle
with the new 'Become
Stream' disposition.

00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:52.566 A:middle
And then we will
inform your delegate

00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:55.826 A:middle
that the Data Task has been
converted to a Stream Task

00:38:55.826 --> 00:38:59.206 A:middle
with the 'URL Session Data Task
Did Become Stream Task' method.

00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:04.156 A:middle
Before we finish up today,
I would just like to go

00:39:04.156 --> 00:39:06.456 A:middle
over a few things that we
discussed this morning.

00:39:07.006 --> 00:39:11.026 A:middle
We first talked about how you
can use App Transport Security

00:39:11.316 --> 00:39:14.036 A:middle
to guarantee that only
secure connections are made

00:39:14.036 --> 00:39:16.696 A:middle
from your app and how you
can declare exceptions

00:39:16.696 --> 00:39:17.676 A:middle
to those as needed.

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.136 A:middle
We then talked about how you
can make your apps faster

00:39:20.136 --> 00:39:22.016 A:middle
by supporting HTTP/2
on your servers,

00:39:22.256 --> 00:39:25.606 A:middle
which requires no additional
changes on the client.

00:39:26.446 --> 00:39:29.276 A:middle
We talked about best practices
for using NSURL Session

00:39:29.276 --> 00:39:33.946 A:middle
on watch apps, and went over the
new API changes this release,

00:39:34.006 --> 00:39:36.506 A:middle
the deprecation of NSURL
Connection and how to migrate

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:40.266 A:middle
to Session, how to share cookies
between apps and extensions,

00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:44.156 A:middle
and how to get a great
foundation level abstraction

00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:47.246 A:middle
if you need to communicate
using a TCP connection

00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:49.126 A:middle
without HTTP to your servers.

00:39:49.636 --> 00:39:55.586 A:middle
As always, I would like to
refer you to the documentation

00:39:55.586 --> 00:39:58.136 A:middle
that we have available on
our website, and remind you

00:39:58.236 --> 00:40:00.786 A:middle
about the developer forums
that you can participate in,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.236 --> 00:40:00.786 A:middle
about the developer forums
that you can participate in,

00:40:00.786 --> 00:40:03.246 A:middle
and any questions that you
might have while you are here

00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:05.816 A:middle
at WWDC this week, Paul
Danbold is our Evangelist

00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:06.706 A:middle
and you can talk to him.

00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:10.106 A:middle
There are a few other
related sessions

00:40:10.106 --> 00:40:10.976 A:middle
that you might want to attend.

00:40:10.976 --> 00:40:13.296 A:middle
I highly encourage you
to attend "Your App

00:40:13.296 --> 00:40:15.226 A:middle
and Next Generation
Networks," tomorrow,

00:40:15.226 --> 00:40:17.576 A:middle
which will be a lower level
discussion of networking.

00:40:18.116 --> 00:40:21.336 A:middle
And the networking labs
occur this week as well

00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:23.346 A:middle
and you can talk to us directly
for any questions you have.

00:40:23.836 --> 00:40:25.546 A:middle
With that, I would like to
thank you for coming out today,

00:40:25.976 --> 00:40:29.236 A:middle
and we look forward to seeing
the amazing apps that you create

00:40:29.356 --> 00:40:31.766 A:middle
with iOS 9, OS X, El
Capitan, and watchOS 2.

00:40:31.766 --> 00:40:31.976 A:middle
Thanks.

00:40:32.516 --> 00:40:35.500 A:middle
[Applause]
