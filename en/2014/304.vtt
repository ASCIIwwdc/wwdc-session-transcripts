&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

[ Applause ]

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:15.976 A:middle
All right.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.956 A:middle
All right.

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.536 A:middle
Let's have some fun today.

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:20.826 A:middle
All right.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.106 A:middle
Thank you for coming.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:24.846 A:middle
This is a session not
just creating app previews

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:27.336 A:middle
but creating great app previews.

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:28.926 A:middle
And I really believe that.

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.416 A:middle
After this session, I believe
you're going to be able

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:32.636 A:middle
to create a great app preview.

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.376 A:middle
My name is Paul Turner and I'm

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.436 A:middle
from the iTunes Engineering
Division.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:41.496 A:middle
And what that fancy title behind
you says, is that I have a job

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.236 A:middle
that requires many talents.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.356 A:middle
It's true.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.856 A:middle
Not only do I run several teams
that keep content processing

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.286 A:middle
such as your apps, processing
and flowing to the store.

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:56.646 A:middle
But in my 10 years at Apple,
I've been lucky enough

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:59.836 A:middle
to be able to participate
in producing and engineering

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.846 A:middle
and launching incredible
projects.

and launching incredible
projects.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:05.346 A:middle
One of my first projects was
with some of these people

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:05.976 A:middle
in the front here,

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:08.966 A:middle
it was actually the
original App Store launch.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:13.766 A:middle
Since then, we've done
iBooks Store and HD films

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:18.066 A:middle
and iTunes Extras and LPs and
iTunes Match and The Beatles.

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:20.246 A:middle
It's been awesome.

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.186 A:middle
This isn't about me.

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:26.296 A:middle
What's actually relevant to
you guys though is that one

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.066 A:middle
of the teams that I run is
actually the logistics team

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.496 A:middle
for apps made by Apple.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.746 A:middle
So, not only do I help engineer
and support iTunes Connect

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:36.656 A:middle
but I am a customer of
it, just like you guys.

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:37.726 A:middle
All right.

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:42.086 A:middle
So, let's talk about you and
your apps and your app previews.

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:48.116 A:middle
First, I want to talk about
how content is previewed

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:49.526 A:middle
to customers on the store.

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:55.376 A:middle
Currently, with our
amazing and innovative

00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:56.846 A:middle
and boundless music store,

00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:59.276 A:middle
we have those great
90-second previews.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:01:59.696 A:middle
I love them.

I sit and click and
buy all day long.

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:05.376 A:middle
And for my favorite
store, the film store,

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.196 A:middle
we have those great
theatrical trailers.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:09.606 A:middle
And for the TV store, we
have episode previews.

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:13.626 A:middle
And for everyone's
favorite, the iBooks Store,

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.296 A:middle
we have those enticing
downloadable samples.

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:18.066 A:middle
So, what do we have
for the App Store?

00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:22.756 A:middle
This week, we're
introducing app previews.

00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:24.376 A:middle
So, let's get to know them.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:24.906 A:middle
Yeah, whoo!

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:25.886 A:middle
You're allowed to clap.

00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:27.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:27.746 A:middle
This is great.

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:28.406 A:middle
This is good.

00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:29.806 A:middle
This is amazing.

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:30.726 A:middle
All right.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.066 A:middle
Let's get to know app previews.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:32.756 A:middle
This is fun.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
Let's pick it up where
Tim left us on Monday.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.116 A:middle
With that app that he
showed, Monument Valley.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:41.206 A:middle
And let's take a look at the way
that it's previewed to customers

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:45.676 A:middle
on the store right now.

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:46.546 A:middle
It's pretty.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:47.666 A:middle
All right.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.106 A:middle
So, on the store, on the store's
product page, you're going

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:50.956 A:middle
to have description text.

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:52.316 A:middle
You're going to have other
information but, you know,

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:53.686 A:middle
a picture is worth
a thousand words.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.436 A:middle
Let's look at these screenshots
and they're beautiful.

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:57.226 A:middle
They're beautiful.

00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:58.076 A:middle
They're gorgeous.

00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.686 A:middle
It's an amazing app.

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:03.746 A:middle
But I'm curious as a customer,
I don't fully understand it.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.596 A:middle
I don't understand
how the app functions.

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:07.636 A:middle
This is app previews.

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:11.506 A:middle
So, if a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:12.546 A:middle
what's a video worth?

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.976 A:middle
And this is it.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:45.546 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.626 A:middle
Right before our eyes, Monument
Valley becomes this immersive

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:50.926 A:middle
puzzle game.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.216 A:middle
And you make an immediate
emotional connection.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:55.066 A:middle
And that's app previews.

00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:58.416 A:middle
So, I want to start off,
get us all on the same page

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
with just some basic
information.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
with just some basic
information.

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:04.976 A:middle
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length.

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:10.556 A:middle
App previews are not really
brand or campaign-focused.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
They are not full of cut scenes.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.126 A:middle
They're definitely not
theatrical trailers.

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:18.076 A:middle
They're just brief videos
meant to demonstrate the UI,

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:21.086 A:middle
the features or the
functionality of your app.

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:25.806 A:middle
App previews are made
primarily of captured footage.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.476 A:middle
And we're going to show you how
to do that live on stage today.

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:33.586 A:middle
And once you're finished
producing your app preview,

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
you're going to export out
a high-resolution source

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:38.266 A:middle
that you're going
to upload right

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:39.936 A:middle
into iTunes Connect very easy.

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:42.336 A:middle
It's going to be reviewed
along with your binary.

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:43.906 A:middle
We're going to re-encode
it for streaming

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:46.126 A:middle
out to devices all
around the world.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:47.636 A:middle
It's incredible.

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:50.916 A:middle
So, with that, let's talk
about the agenda today.

00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.346 A:middle
First off, we're going to
go over a little bit more

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:56.356 A:middle
of the details in app
previews, the characteristics,

00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
what makes them different

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.816 A:middle
than anything you've
really seen before.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.456 A:middle
We're going to help you
take that first step.

We're going to help you
take that first step.

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:02.936 A:middle
And that's kind of the
most important step is,

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:06.506 A:middle
the planning step, how to
plan your video creatively

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:07.536 A:middle
and technically.

00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:11.576 A:middle
We're going to show you
that capture feature

00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:13.396 A:middle
and it's amazing and I love it.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.596 A:middle
We're also going to do
a little bit of editing.

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.116 A:middle
We're going to show your
editing options with iMovie.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.966 A:middle
Next, we're going to show
you some composition tips.

00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:25.046 A:middle
We're going to demonstrate
the uploading right

00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:26.016 A:middle
into iTunes Connect.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:29.676 A:middle
And we'll round out everything
at the end with some guidelines.

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:30.956 A:middle
Does that sound good
to everybody?

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:34.786 A:middle
Yes, OK. It's OK to talk.

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:36.946 A:middle
It's interactive.

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:37.946 A:middle
All right.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
Let's talk about those details.

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:42.936 A:middle
All right.

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:43.706 A:middle
App previews.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.146 A:middle
App previews are a feature
of the iOS App Stores.

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:49.426 A:middle
And as you saw on the
Monument Valley that Tim showed

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.366 A:middle
and we just showed here, app
previews are going to show

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:55.706 A:middle
up in the first slot
of the new section

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.546 A:middle
for screenshots and videos.

00:05:57.546 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
So, that first slot will be
dedicated to app previews

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
and show up on the product page.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
and show up on the product page.

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:07.006 A:middle
App previews are
device specific,

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.596 A:middle
meaning that if you
have a universal app,

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:14.606 A:middle
you will upload a distinct
iPhone and a distinct iPad video

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.006 A:middle
for your app previews.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:19.576 A:middle
Also, we're making it very easy.

00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:22.766 A:middle
You're going to upload just
that single set of videos

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.856 A:middle
to your apps primary
localization and we're going

00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:28.436 A:middle
to disperse them to
the other storefronts

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:29.926 A:middle
that your app is for sale on.

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:37.236 A:middle
A couple more details, we need
those beautiful widescreens

00:06:37.236 --> 00:06:38.756 A:middle
to show off your app preview.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:41.526 A:middle
So, app previews are going
to be a feature of iOS 8

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.946 A:middle
and they're going to
display on those iPhone,

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:47.106 A:middle
those widescreen iPhones, the
iPod touches, the iPhone 5,

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.636 A:middle
the iPod touches, the iPads
and the Desktop Store.

00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:54.486 A:middle
One question I get a lot,
they're not required,

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
but they're strongly encouraged.

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.086 A:middle
And I'm glad you guys
are all here today.

00:06:58.086 --> 00:06:58.936 A:middle
You've taken the first step.

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:01.776 A:middle
We didn't want to
launch app previews


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:01.776 A:middle
We didn't want to
launch app previews

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.856 A:middle
until we made everything
available

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.536 A:middle
and accessible to
every developer.

00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:06.706 A:middle
And now that we're doing that,

00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:09.096 A:middle
we're strongly encouraging
everyone to get on board.

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.226 A:middle
We really want you
to get on board.

00:07:10.526 --> 00:07:11.366 A:middle
We're here for the session.

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
We're going to be in the lab.

00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
We're here to help you get
on board with app previews.

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.186 A:middle
We just think they're amazing.

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:17.846 A:middle
This is my favorite.

00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:19.486 A:middle
This is my favorite
of all, my favorite.

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:23.466 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support built in.

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:30.866 A:middle
No longer will you have
to stretch or pinch or add

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:35.216 A:middle
that to your videos to fit
in a widescreen player.

00:07:35.526 --> 00:07:37.616 A:middle
I want that off the screen as
bad, it's just burning my eyes.

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:40.376 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support right in,

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:40.976 A:middle
built right in.

00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:45.576 A:middle
So, you get the full UI
video in the playback.

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:46.706 A:middle
It's fantastic.

00:07:46.706 --> 00:07:51.426 A:middle
I want to talk about
planning next.

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:54.286 A:middle
I'm sure you guys
are sitting here.

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:56.186 A:middle
I'm giving you a little
bit of information.

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:57.686 A:middle
Maybe the wheels are spinning.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.686 A:middle
Maybe you think about your app.

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.486 A:middle
So, let's talk about planning.

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.486 A:middle
Planning is the biggest part
about making your app preview.

00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
The rest of it we
made really easy.

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:08.486 A:middle
So, planning is where you're
going to have to start.

00:08:08.486 --> 00:08:11.116 A:middle
First, you're going
to have to figure

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.576 A:middle
out the goal of your
app preview.

00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:17.376 A:middle
Are you going to highlight
a feature, many features,

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:20.426 A:middle
maybe the utility of your app?

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:22.256 A:middle
Maybe you have a
really innovative UI.

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:25.466 A:middle
Start thinking about
what your goal

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:27.486 A:middle
of your 30-second app
preview is going to be.

00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:30.096 A:middle
And a great way to think

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:33.116 A:middle
about this is what
makes my app magical

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
or what makes my app magic?

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.926 A:middle
And an easy way to kind of put
yourself in that question is,

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.096 A:middle
if somebody walked up to
you with your app, you know,

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:43.496 A:middle
"Hey, I've got this app."

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
It's your app.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.326 A:middle
What would you want them to
say to you about the app?

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.266 A:middle
You know, "Oh, I've
got this app.

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.996 A:middle
It does this for phone basics."

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:52.926 A:middle
Or, "Oh, I've got
this really cool app.

00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:55.696 A:middle
It revolutionizes
the way I...that"

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:57.156 A:middle
or "What's your plan
over there?"

00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:59.176 A:middle
"Oh, this new cool
new game, it does this

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.316 A:middle
and this character does that."


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.316 A:middle
and this character does that."

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:02.076 A:middle
What makes your app magical?

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:04.636 A:middle
You know, that's going to
make your magical app preview

00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:05.996 A:middle
and your app preview magical.

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:09.726 A:middle
That's going to get people
to purchase your app.

00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:13.516 A:middle
Just like Monument Valley, you
saw those beautiful screenshots

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:15.346 A:middle
and screenshots are
a very powerful tool.

00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:17.436 A:middle
But now, you have
this story to tell.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:21.036 A:middle
You have this...you have app
previews to fill in that story.

00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:23.106 A:middle
So, you're going to look
beyond your screenshots.

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:27.646 A:middle
How do you tell your story
now with these videos?

00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:28.476 A:middle
It's fantastic.

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.976 A:middle
A couple more things
on content planning.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:36.016 A:middle
So now, you started to figure
out what makes your app magical.

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.346 A:middle
You're starting to
understand what your goal is.

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.426 A:middle
Now, it's time to start
listing out these elements,

00:09:43.426 --> 00:09:45.026 A:middle
maybe list out the
elements that you want

00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:46.246 A:middle
to put in your app preview.

00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:49.456 A:middle
If you're an app that's already
on the store, a great place

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.086 A:middle
to start would probably
be a description text,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.836 A:middle
that's probably your
first list today.

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:55.346 A:middle
I bet every one of
you got bulleted list

00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
in your description text right
now, you can just steal that,

00:09:58.216 --> 00:09:59.106 A:middle
put that in your list.

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
But add to it, start
playing with things.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
But add to it, start
playing with things.

00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:04.376 A:middle
Start thinking about what
your app is all about.

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:07.086 A:middle
Or, "Oh man, I spent so much
time on this great level.

00:10:07.086 --> 00:10:08.546 A:middle
I really want to show this off.

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:09.396 A:middle
Kids love this."

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:11.666 A:middle
Or, "I get so much feedback
about this portion of my app,

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:13.526 A:middle
that's a great thing to
put in my app preview."

00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:17.746 A:middle
And I-- having said that,
now I highly encourage you

00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:20.736 A:middle
to make some kind of
outline or storyboard.

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:21.896 A:middle
And you see the storyboard
that we have

00:10:21.896 --> 00:10:22.936 A:middle
up on here-- on the screen.

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.426 A:middle
This is for storyboard
but we're going

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:25.786 A:middle
to actually show the app
preview this is based

00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:27.556 A:middle
on in a little bit.

00:10:27.846 --> 00:10:29.006 A:middle
But, it doesn't have
to be fancy.

00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:29.916 A:middle
You don't have to
be a greater drawer.

00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:31.336 A:middle
This is a fantastic drawing.

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
[Speaker laughs] It
could be on a napkin,

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.626 A:middle
it could be on a
Chipotle napkin.

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:37.336 A:middle
You know, it doesn't matter
what you're drawing it on.

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.256 A:middle
It could be a series
of arrows and boxes

00:10:39.256 --> 00:10:40.776 A:middle
but start storyboarding it out.

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:42.676 A:middle
What do I want to
show in my video?

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.746 A:middle
How am I going to put the
story together, right?

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:49.406 A:middle
And along those lines,
you probably want to work

00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:52.046 A:middle
with that list of
elements, your storyboard

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:53.646 A:middle
and start working
with the timing.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:55.276 A:middle
Remember you have a
finite amount of time.

00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:57.526 A:middle
So say, "I like this element,

00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:58.856 A:middle
I really want to
show off this UI."

00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:00.566 A:middle
That takes about
5 seconds to load.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:00.566 A:middle
That takes about
5 seconds to load.

00:11:00.856 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
Let's start working
with the timing here.

00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:04.506 A:middle
This is the time in
the planning stage.

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:06.506 A:middle
You don't want to get bogged
down in the production stage.

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:08.786 A:middle
You don't want to be
working on your app preview

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:11.356 A:middle
and still not know what you're
trying to accomplish by it.

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:13.656 A:middle
So, part of the planning stage,

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.896 A:middle
and these are all basic
things I'm telling here,

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.206 A:middle
but I think it's good to
remind everyone, it'll get you

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.586 A:middle
out of the weeds if you're
on the production process.

00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:25.336 A:middle
And one last thing on content
planning, just like screenshots,

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:28.136 A:middle
you have to disclose all
your In-App Purchases.

00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:30.676 A:middle
So, that's a good time in
your planning stage to figure

00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:31.686 A:middle
out how you're going to do that.

00:11:32.036 --> 00:11:35.646 A:middle
If you're going to show the,
you know, the sword of thunder

00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:39.406 A:middle
and that cost 10,000 coins,
you're either going to have

00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:41.286 A:middle
to figure out how to
disclose that with some kind

00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:44.336 A:middle
of textural element or
maybe you want to show how

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:48.856 A:middle
that in-app purchase was
purchased in your app preview.

00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:50.146 A:middle
So remember, you have

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:53.356 A:middle
to disclose all your in-app
purchases, plan for it.

00:11:54.486 --> 00:11:55.176 A:middle
It's a good tip.

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:55.666 A:middle
All right.

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:57.986 A:middle
A couple of technical
things to go over.

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:03.006 A:middle
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:03.006 A:middle
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.296 A:middle
might have a great plan.

00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
But your iPad app
and your iPad version

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:10.576 A:middle
and your iPhone version may
have different UI elements

00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:12.756 A:middle
that you want to highlight or
need to highlight or capture

00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:15.476 A:middle
in a different way to edit
into your app preview.

00:12:15.476 --> 00:12:17.896 A:middle
And the planning phase
is good to identify those

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:20.286 A:middle
so you can capture them when
you need them to edit them

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
into your production process.

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:25.886 A:middle
Next one. Oh, this
is a good one.

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:30.496 A:middle
You know your customers
best, and so therefore,

00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:32.356 A:middle
we're going to allow you
to pick your language

00:12:32.616 --> 00:12:33.376 A:middle
for your app preview.

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:36.276 A:middle
And remember, it goes on to
your apps primary localization,

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
but you need to choose
a language.

00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:39.806 A:middle
Now, yet again, you know
your customers best.

00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:43.196 A:middle
If your app's primary
localization is Japanese

00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:47.596 A:middle
and it's primarily sold
in Japan, but yet you know

00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.806 A:middle
that your customer is
expecting an English video,

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:53.026 A:middle
as long as it passes guidelines,
we're going to allow it.

00:12:53.526 --> 00:12:55.006 A:middle
So, in the planning
phase, it's good to figure

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:56.376 A:middle
out what language
you're going to use.

00:12:56.906 --> 00:12:59.886 A:middle
This is probably the most
obvious thing I'm going

00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
to tell you today.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
to tell you today.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:03.806 A:middle
The demo accounts, if you're
app opens up to a login screen,

00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:05.226 A:middle
it's going to be a
really boring app preview.

00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:07.086 A:middle
So, you're probably going

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.426 A:middle
to need some demo
accounts, you know.

00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:10.526 A:middle
And along those lines,
you may need

00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:14.296 A:middle
to stage some information
into those accounts.

00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:15.496 A:middle
If you're a social app,
you're going to need

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:16.366 A:middle
to put some social media.

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:17.626 A:middle
And if you're a calendar
app, you're going to need

00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.556 A:middle
to put some calendar
information in.

00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:22.986 A:middle
If you're a game and you really
want to show off that 4th level

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
that you, you know, kids really
love, you're going to have

00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:27.416 A:middle
to figure out a way to
get to that 4th level.

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:31.216 A:middle
And I caution you, don't stage
anything in your app preview

00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:33.146 A:middle
that cannot be accomplished
in your app.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:35.656 A:middle
Your app preview has to
be represented of the app

00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:36.586 A:middle
that customer will buy.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
It's just a caution, I know
none of you guys would do that,

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
but I just want to
warn you about that.

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:46.566 A:middle
Also in staging, it's a good
idea, just like screenshots,

00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:48.426 A:middle
we can't have any advertisements
in the app preview,

00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:50.466 A:middle
so it's a good time
to stage those out.

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:52.266 A:middle
Sound good?

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:53.346 A:middle
All right.

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:54.876 A:middle
Let's show you a
cool app preview now,

00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:55.976 A:middle
enough of me talking.

00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
This is a preview from
our friends at Toco Boca,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
This is a preview from
our friends at Toco Boca,

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.676 A:middle
for an app called Toca Labs.

00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:08.046 A:middle
And they just have put a
few captured clips together.

00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:12.586 A:middle
They demonstrate their quirky
art direction, their fun UI.

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:15.486 A:middle
This is an app that gets
kids really involved

00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:16.886 A:middle
in experimentation in science.

00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:08.246 A:middle
about this, the capture.

00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:11.256 A:middle
And you need a really
expensive cable for this

and really lots of...no,
I'm kidding,

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:14.506 A:middle
you just need a Lightning cable.

so easy, it's amazing.

00:15:16.926 --> 00:15:17.396 A:middle

you're going to be able to hook

00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:28.166 A:middle
up your device via a Lightning
cable, right to your Mac,

00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:31.786 A:middle
open up QuickTime Player and
your device's screen output

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:35.096 A:middle
and audio are available
as inputs just

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:36.006 A:middle
like a camera would be.

All right.

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:52.146 A:middle
So, to do this obviously,
you're going to need iOS devices

00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:53.226 A:middle
that require Lightning cables.

00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:56.286 A:middle
So, that's your iPod
touches, your iPhone 5 series,

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:59.576 A:middle
your iPads, you needed the
Lightning cable support,

00:15:59.576 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
it only works over Lightning.

A couple tips for capture.

00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:26.216 A:middle
We want to display the
highest quality video and audio

00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:29.656 A:middle
to the customers and so
we've made this capture tool

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.906 A:middle
so that you can capture
the highest quality video

00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:32.906 A:middle
and audio of your app.

00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:36.486 A:middle
You spend a lot of time
making...perfecting every pixel

00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:39.176 A:middle
in your UI and we want to
capture every single pixel

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:42.616 A:middle
and make sure that the
customer sees how much love and,

00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:44.196 A:middle
you know, everything that
you put into your app.

00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:46.466 A:middle
So, we're hoping that you're
going to use these Apple tools.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
A tip just like Toca
Boca did there,

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:54.176 A:middle
you can start your capture
or, you know, you can edit

00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:55.416 A:middle
in from your splash screen.

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.186 A:middle
It looks really kind
of cool if you want to.

00:16:57.636 --> 00:16:58.916 A:middle

from the home screen
going into your app

or if your app has inter-app
operability, don't switch back

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:06.796 A:middle
and forth between apps.

seconds is scary to some of you

00:17:18.506 --> 00:17:20.415 A:middle

some amazing app previews.

in a second, but go slow.

00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:27.306 A:middle
If your customer can't follow
along with what you're doing,

00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:29.326 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app preview,

00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:30.336 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app,

00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:32.776 A:middle
and they're probably going to be
discouraged by it, so go slow.

00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:38.796 A:middle
Use intentional moves, smooth
moves, smooth moves, you know?

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:41.776 A:middle
And there's no film or anything
to load into this camera.

The only limitation is your hard
drive so rehearse it, retake it.

You know, if you flub it and
you try and continue on, don't--

00:17:48.576 --> 00:17:51.766 A:middle
don't-- no, no, just stop,
retake, rehearse it, retake it.

is an example of what we

00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:19.886 A:middle
like to call a one take.

00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:22.406 A:middle
Instead of editing
clips together,

00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:27.136 A:middle
they've literally taken a one
take shot at their app preview.

00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:29.346 A:middle
Click Record, they've
added a couple graphics

00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:30.026 A:middle
in the front and the back.

00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:32.276 A:middle
But they click Record
and they go

00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.396 A:middle
through this nice smooth
intentional movements.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:37.456 A:middle
They've populated it with
a lot of, you know, data.

A couple tips on composition.

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.806 A:middle
You have been developing your
app for days, weeks, months,

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.746 A:middle
years, you know a
lot about your app.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:45.786 A:middle
Well, the customer
probably doesn't have

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:47.226 A:middle
that same perspective.

00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.586 A:middle
So, when you're making
your app preview,

00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:50.866 A:middle
think about their perspective.

00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:53.496 A:middle
If you're going to barrage them
with a bunch of information

00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:55.676 A:middle
or assumptions about
what your app does,

00:19:55.886 --> 00:19:57.676 A:middle
they might be confused,
maybe put off.

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.466 A:middle
So, think about your
customer's perspective.

00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:02.156 A:middle

great, great tip is, you know,

off and look

00:20:07.636 --> 00:20:10.196 A:middle
for what their feedback
is, you know.

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.896 A:middle
See if there's something missing

00:20:11.896 --> 00:20:14.046 A:middle
to your story 'cause
you might have something

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:14.936 A:middle
in your head that, you know,

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:16.276 A:middle
somebody else doesn't
have in their head.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.276 A:middle
This is a common mistake; a
very, very common mistake.

00:20:20.276 --> 00:20:22.476 A:middle
If you're going to put
text up on the screen,

00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:26.366 A:middle
you need to put it up there long
enough for people to read it.

00:20:27.176 --> 00:20:28.566 A:middle
People do this all the time.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:31.186 A:middle
They throw a text up on the
screen and they don't make it--

00:20:31.306 --> 00:20:32.976 A:middle
you know, they've-- it's
gone before you can read it.

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:34.956 A:middle
So, make sure if you're
throwing text up there,

00:20:35.646 --> 00:20:37.086 A:middle
allow people to read your text.

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:40.946 A:middle
This one is easy for me
'cause I'm always positive.

00:20:41.026 --> 00:20:41.996 A:middle
Stay positive.

00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:46.006 A:middle
There's no worst sales pitch
than a negative sales pitch.

00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:49.376 A:middle
This is about your app and
why your app is the best

00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:51.236 A:middle
or why your app is awesome.

00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:54.516 A:middle
So, don't imply anything
about other applications.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
Just keep it about your
app and stay positive.

A couple more tips.

00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
You may be a cross-platform
developer,

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.726 A:middle
but for these 30 seconds,
you're all App Store.

00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.456 A:middle
So, go ahead and leave
off those platform logos.

00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:15.266 A:middle
In fact, leave off
the App Store logo,

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:16.606 A:middle
use the 30 seconds for you.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.296 A:middle
We like our logo
just and-- it's fine.

00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:20.936 A:middle
These are your 30 seconds.

00:21:21.706 --> 00:21:23.036 A:middle
Leave off the platform logos.

00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:26.616 A:middle
You might have this great idea.

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:33.286 A:middle
"New for Spring" in your app
preview, and then, you know,

00:21:33.286 --> 00:21:35.006 A:middle
you think you're going
to upload a new binary

00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:39.416 A:middle
or upload a new preview and your
cat gets sick or your car breaks

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:41.766 A:middle
down and it's eight months later

00:21:41.866 --> 00:21:44.306 A:middle
and it's winter or
whatever season.

00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:46.306 A:middle
And now, it says,
"New for Spring,"

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.586 A:middle
and it makes absolutely
no sense.

00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:50.816 A:middle
So, keep it timeless.

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:53.236 A:middle
Allow your app preview just to
be about your app in some kind

00:21:53.236 --> 00:21:55.126 A:middle
of neutral time space.

00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:09.396 A:middle
so straightforward transitions
are really recommended

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.636 A:middle
when you're making
an app preview.

00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:14.556 A:middle
Straightforward transitions
we actually have found just

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:16.826 A:middle
in our tests can actually
sometimes be confusing though.

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.466 A:middle
Jump cuts is what we
recommend for everyone.

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.936 A:middle
You've seen a lot of jump cuts
here and I'll show you a couple

00:22:21.936 --> 00:22:23.816 A:middle
of app previews that have
a lot of great jump cuts.

00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:27.106 A:middle
But in a couple situations, we
noticed that in jump cutting,

00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:29.596 A:middle
you can imply that
your app does something

00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.126 A:middle
that your app doesn't
actually do.

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:33.306 A:middle
So, another great
straightforward transition is

00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:35.556 A:middle
like a dissolve or
a fade-through color

00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:40.686 A:middle
to give your user-- oh, OK,
this is a fade to another clip.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.236 A:middle
Make sure you don't imply

00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.126 A:middle
that your app does
something that it does not.

00:22:44.126 --> 00:22:45.496 A:middle
You don't want to
confuse your customers,

00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:46.426 A:middle
we love our customers.

00:22:47.156 --> 00:22:49.846 A:middle
My last point is,
remember the tone.

00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:53.176 A:middle
These aren't in your
face marketing videos.

00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:58.516 A:middle
This is just simple short app
usage videos, they're fantastic.

00:22:58.516 --> 00:22:59.386 A:middle
Remember the tone.

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:07.376 A:middle
Things to avoid.

If they're watching
your app preview,

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:22.916 A:middle
they're already on
your product page.

They've already clicked Play,

00:23:24.096 --> 00:23:26.176 A:middle
you don't need a
gimmick to draw them in.

Please keep it simple.

You don't have to do this.

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:34.136 A:middle
Pricing, if you're going to
put pricing in your video,

00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:34.906 A:middle
it's going to get lost,

00:23:34.906 --> 00:23:37.516 A:middle
it's going to put
you into the corner.

00:23:37.686 --> 00:23:39.766 A:middle
Remember, your app preview

00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.446 A:middle
or your app is sold
internationally.

You may put your
app on sale one day.

If you block yourself in
the pricing in your video,

00:23:45.576 --> 00:23:46.866 A:middle
it's not going to
make any sense.

00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:47.816 A:middle
Leave the pricing out.

00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.586 A:middle
These are going to display
in your product page.

00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:51.296 A:middle

already has pricing.

that I don't even understand
because I don't watch the show.

I'm probably the
only one who doesn't.

00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:13.316 A:middle
But this is about
your app preview.

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:17.456 A:middle
It's not about anything that's
going on in the media nowadays.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.526 A:middle
So, just keep it about
your app, keep it simple.

00:24:20.196 --> 00:24:21.486 A:middle
And here's the big one.

00:24:21.546 --> 00:24:24.496 A:middle
You can't put anything-- this
is just like screenshots,

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:26.666 A:middle
it's just like your app,
you can't put anything

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:28.976 A:middle
in your app preview that you
don't have the rights to use.

00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:32.406 A:middle
And this includes, but
isn't limited to, imagery

00:24:32.406 --> 00:24:36.466 A:middle
or photography or text or
sounds or music or videos.

00:24:36.756 --> 00:24:40.686 A:middle
If you don't have the rights
to use it, do not put it

00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:42.446 A:middle
in your app preview, all right.

00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:45.186 A:middle
That was as serious
as it's going to get.

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:47.256 A:middle
One thing we added in
here 'cause we got a lot

00:24:47.256 --> 00:24:49.096 A:middle
of questions on it,
is narration.

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:53.596 A:middle
Absolutely, it's a powerful
tool if used correctly.

00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:55.776 A:middle
So, here's a couple of tips.

00:24:56.736 --> 00:25:00.476 A:middle
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:56.736 --> 00:25:00.476 A:middle
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.

00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:02.926 A:middle
Look for them, they're
so talented.

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:04.556 A:middle
Use professional voices.

00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:08.806 A:middle
Not everyone has the intonation
and clarity for voice over work.

00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:11.026 A:middle
Obviously, I don't either, um.

00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:15.006 A:middle
But remember, this
is a voice now.

00:25:15.006 --> 00:25:16.296 A:middle
This is the voice of your app.

00:25:16.296 --> 00:25:17.596 A:middle
So, choose your voice wisely.

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:21.006 A:middle
The second one is use
professional equipment.

00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:22.876 A:middle
It's available everywhere.

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:26.296 A:middle
Condenser mics, pop filters,
just recording studios

00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:27.606 A:middle
in general, quiet rooms.

00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:31.326 A:middle
Nobody wants to listen to an app
preview with a narration on it

00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.276 A:middle
and they can hear your dog
barking at the background.

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:36.986 A:middle
Or maybe for some of our younger
developers, you know, "Jenny,

00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:39.756 A:middle
come down to dinner," you know.

00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:47.556 A:middle
No, no. And lastly,
narration is a powerful tool,

00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.076 A:middle
but sometimes, it
can be overused.

00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:51.396 A:middle
You don't want to narrate your
entire video, but you want

00:25:51.396 --> 00:25:52.466 A:middle
to let your app speak.

00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:55.646 A:middle
So, just use narration wisely
is what I'm going to say.

00:25:56.836 --> 00:25:57.906 A:middle
And having said that, I want

00:25:57.906 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
to show you a really
cool app preview.

in the intro to their games.

00:26:18.406 --> 00:26:20.196 A:middle

that narration

00:26:20.606 --> 00:26:22.276 A:middle
with some capture
gameplay footage.

of the story of the game as well

the QuickTime Capture captures

that your app outputs.

I'm going to drag
them in to our event.

timeline down here

where we can start
building our preview,

So, let's just start
with some drums.

00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:49.686 A:middle
These are drums we captured off

in this room with the echo.

So, I'm going to
drag those in here,

00:35:53.326 --> 00:35:57.666 A:middle
make this timeline a little
smaller so I can work with it.

00:35:57.666 --> 00:36:00.056 A:middle
What was that next instrument?

00:36:00.056 --> 00:36:00.726 A:middle
That was the bass.

00:36:00.886 --> 00:36:04.156 A:middle
So, I'm just scrubbing
along here.

00:36:04.156 --> 00:36:05.996 A:middle
You can see I have the
waveform view up right here.

00:36:05.996 --> 00:36:10.516 A:middle
So, you can kind of see
where my audio clicks in.

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:17.486 A:middle
I got...there we go,
that's a good amount.

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:21.296 A:middle
It's the bass right there.

And what was next?

00:36:22.796 --> 00:36:25.696 A:middle
That was the synth, right,
with the cool controllers.

00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:28.556 A:middle
Let's get that.

00:36:29.386 --> 00:36:34.426 A:middle
Let me grab a little
bit of that.

slick my way from up.

There we go.

We get right as those come
in, can I get that hit?

00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:54.246 A:middle
How about four seconds for that.

00:36:55.456 --> 00:36:57.596 A:middle

00:36:57.826 --> 00:37:01.236 A:middle

John's song earlier,

00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:02.316 A:middle
I put that in the folder too.

00:37:02.316 --> 00:37:04.816 A:middle
So, we're going to
drag that down

00:37:04.816 --> 00:37:07.806 A:middle
into the soundtrack
section just right there.

00:37:09.006 --> 00:37:11.886 A:middle
Now, I could add maybe
some titles to this

end on a fade to black

that on there,

make that look really pro.

What I want to do also is
I want to mute these clips

00:37:27.686 --> 00:37:30.786 A:middle
so they don't conflict with
that soundtrack, all right?

00:37:31.576 --> 00:37:34.716 A:middle

give this a whirl.

A couple takeaways here.

00:44:27.056 --> 00:44:30.956 A:middle
We're going to take two
codecs that are very familiar

00:44:30.956 --> 00:44:35.376 A:middle
to the Apple ecosystem, that's
H.264 and ProRes 422 HQ,

00:44:35.376 --> 00:44:36.386 A:middle
remember, high quality.

00:44:36.386 --> 00:44:37.586 A:middle
We want take the
ProRes, so you'd--

00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:40.106 A:middle
highest quality video
to your customers.

00:44:40.536 --> 00:44:43.036 A:middle
A couple takeaways is
the 30 frames per second.

00:44:43.036 --> 00:44:45.886 A:middle
We'd like you to upload your
sources in 30 frames per second.

00:44:45.886 --> 00:44:50.736 A:middle
And we're going to take stereo
audio either in AAC or PCM wave.

00:44:51.786 --> 00:44:54.426 A:middle
Basic, all this documentation
will be available to you,

00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:55.506 A:middle
don't worry about
writing it down,

00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:56.946 A:middle
I see this guy writing
it down, I'm sorry.

00:44:57.506 --> 00:45:00.596 A:middle
It's OK. All right.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.506 --> 00:45:00.596 A:middle
It's OK. All right.

00:45:00.666 --> 00:45:04.636 A:middle
I'd like to end out with a
couple review guidelines.

00:45:05.296 --> 00:45:08.896 A:middle
Now, the review guidelines
will be published

00:45:08.896 --> 00:45:10.886 A:middle
as this feature is rolled out.

00:45:11.656 --> 00:45:14.116 A:middle
And obviously, I'm not going to
be able to go over every single,

00:45:14.116 --> 00:45:16.226 A:middle
applicable review
guideline to you.

00:45:16.226 --> 00:45:18.696 A:middle
But, I'd like to highlight
a few that'll help find you

00:45:18.696 --> 00:45:19.536 A:middle
safe passage.

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:23.626 A:middle
Remember things like
inappropriate content,

00:45:23.626 --> 00:45:26.206 A:middle
trademarked items, all
apply to app previews.

00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:31.146 A:middle
So, consult the app review
guidelines before uploading your

00:45:31.146 --> 00:45:31.666 A:middle
app preview.

00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:34.076 A:middle
First one, keep it relevant.

00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:38.176 A:middle
If your app has screenshots,
or app previews

00:45:38.176 --> 00:45:39.646 A:middle
that are absolutely not relevant

00:45:39.646 --> 00:45:41.746 A:middle
to your app, it will
be rejected.

00:45:42.136 --> 00:45:45.646 A:middle
So, don't sneak in a plug for
your Uncle Murray's car wash

00:45:46.046 --> 00:45:49.886 A:middle
or a, you know, surprise
proposal to your fiancee.

00:45:49.886 --> 00:45:51.256 A:middle
This is not the time.

00:45:51.686 --> 00:45:52.676 A:middle
Keep it relevant to your app.

00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.626 A:middle
By the way, she said yes
and we're married, I know.

00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:57.906 A:middle
Yay, all right.

00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:02.536 A:middle
Next one, just like screenshots,
you got to keep it 4+.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:02.536 A:middle
Next one, just like screenshots,
you got to keep it 4+.

00:46:02.966 --> 00:46:04.916 A:middle
And I know you're sitting
there maybe have a game called

00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:06.206 A:middle
Mortal Kombat.

00:46:06.716 --> 00:46:08.076 A:middle
And that you're like,
"Paul, do I have to make it

00:46:08.076 --> 00:46:09.716 A:middle
into a tickle fest or
something like that?"

00:46:09.716 --> 00:46:12.036 A:middle
No. But you're going to have
to get creative, you know,

00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:14.106 A:middle
what did Spielberg do when
the shark didn't work?

00:46:14.106 --> 00:46:15.356 A:middle
He made "Jaws" and
it was awesome.

00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:18.666 A:middle
So, get creative, creative
editing, just, you know,

00:46:18.666 --> 00:46:20.276 A:middle
leave the violence,
those things out.

00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:22.836 A:middle
It has to be 4+ applicable
to all audiences just

00:46:22.836 --> 00:46:25.426 A:middle
like screenshots, easy enough.

00:46:26.196 --> 00:46:26.786 A:middle
All right.

00:46:27.276 --> 00:46:28.566 A:middle
Use captured footage.

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:34.336 A:middle
No people in-- you know,
videos of people interacting

00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:36.696 A:middle
with your apps, no
hands in the shots,

00:46:36.696 --> 00:46:38.556 A:middle
so let's remove that hand.

00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:39.886 A:middle
This is captured footage.

00:46:39.886 --> 00:46:41.686 A:middle
You can use some
textual elements.

00:46:41.936 --> 00:46:44.916 A:middle
You can use graphic elements
that highlight points.

00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:47.716 A:middle
But, this is mostly about your
app and your app preview needs

00:46:47.716 --> 00:46:49.886 A:middle
to be made mostly
of captured footage.

00:46:49.886 --> 00:46:51.206 A:middle
And we've given you those tools.

00:46:51.206 --> 00:46:52.886 A:middle
So, use captured footage.

00:46:54.256 --> 00:46:57.856 A:middle
This one, simulated data please,
this goes without saying.

00:46:58.136 --> 00:47:00.596 A:middle

celebrities, don't use anybody,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:00.596 --> 00:47:02.736 A:middle
don't use your neighbor, your
friend, the person sitting next

to you, anybody that
would have issue with use

00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:06.906 A:middle
of their likeness
in your app preview.

00:47:07.496 --> 00:47:09.876 A:middle
You know about Johnny Appleseed,
we use it all the time.

00:47:10.196 --> 00:47:12.956 A:middle
You need to find your own Johnny
Appleseeds and if you're going

00:47:12.956 --> 00:47:14.846 A:middle
to use any data in
your app preview.

00:47:15.786 --> 00:47:18.496 A:middle
This last one, I've gone over it
before, I'll go over it again.

00:47:18.726 --> 00:47:21.726 A:middle
You got to identify your
in-app purchases, you know,

00:47:21.726 --> 00:47:26.326 A:middle
the sword of truth, the missiles
in our Touch Fighter app here.

00:47:26.666 --> 00:47:28.796 A:middle
You got to figure out a
way in your app preview--

00:47:28.796 --> 00:47:31.116 A:middle
if you're going to use those
in-app purchase content,

00:47:31.296 --> 00:47:32.806 A:middle
you got to figure out
a way to disclose them

00:47:32.806 --> 00:47:35.136 A:middle
in your in-app purchases,
simple as that.

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.966 A:middle
Just a couple guidelines to
keep in your head, very easy.

00:47:38.016 --> 00:47:40.056 A:middle
We want to make this
very easy for you guys.

00:47:40.796 --> 00:47:41.116 A:middle
All right.

00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:43.116 A:middle
Time for a summary.

00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:48.726 A:middle
App previews are just 30
seconds of app usage footage.

00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:53.756 A:middle
They need to be 4+ and
appropriate for all audiences.

You're going to edit on
your Mac using iMovie.

00:48:07.396 --> 00:48:08.506 A:middle
iMovie will be updated

00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:11.906 A:middle
to support those native aspect
ratios and device dimensions.

00:48:11.906 --> 00:48:13.626 A:middle
For more advanced editing,

00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:16.506 A:middle
Final Cut Pro is
always a great option.

00:48:16.506 --> 00:48:17.306 A:middle
Love Final Cut Pro.

00:48:18.746 --> 00:48:21.906 A:middle

with your binary reviewed.

that for streaming
all around the world.

00:48:29.146 --> 00:48:32.926 A:middle
Simple. I want to close out
with a really cool app preview.

00:48:32.926 --> 00:48:34.596 A:middle
And this one's kind
of personal to me.

00:48:34.596 --> 00:48:37.876 A:middle
This one came in and I believe
this app also won a design award

00:48:38.026 --> 00:48:39.076 A:middle
this week which is kind of neat.

00:48:39.736 --> 00:48:42.926 A:middle
This app preview came in
and it just touched me.

00:48:43.556 --> 00:48:45.936 A:middle
Ever since I was a kid,
I was one of those people

00:48:45.936 --> 00:48:48.366 A:middle
that would kind of sit
and look out of the stars.

00:48:48.366 --> 00:48:49.786 A:middle
And everybody does this, right?

00:48:49.786 --> 00:48:53.596 A:middle
You've put your finger out, you
kind of trace the Big Dipper

00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:56.946 A:middle
or you track Orion or
something like that.

immediately run to my iPad,

00:49:05.306 --> 00:49:06.596 A:middle
bought the app, went home,
