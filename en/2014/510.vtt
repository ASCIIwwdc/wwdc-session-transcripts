00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:14.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.846 A:middle
And welcome to WWDC
session on iAd Workbench.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.726 A:middle
I'm Paresh Rajwat and I'm
here with my colleague,

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.616 A:middle
Ravi Chittari, to share with
you how we're evolving the iAd

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.626 A:middle
Workbench platform.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:31.576 A:middle
We have some awesome stuff we
are bringing to you this fall,

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.656 A:middle
and I can't wait to
share it with you.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.996 A:middle
But before we go there, knowing
some of you are probably new

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.406 A:middle
to advertising, and perhaps
hearing the word iAd Workbench

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:42.236 A:middle
for the first time.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.426 A:middle
Let's start with two
foundational questions.

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:47.576 A:middle
Why advertise?

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:49.956 A:middle
And why iAd?

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:54.136 A:middle
Let's start with the first
question: why advertise.

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:59.806 A:middle
Say you developed this app, you
put a lot of time and energy

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.426 A:middle
in it and you put
it on the App Store.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.426 A:middle
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:05.966 A:middle
Now two things can happen.

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:11.526 A:middle
First, users can find
your app, or second,

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
you can find users for your app.

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:18.276 A:middle
Users will find your app
if they know about you,

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:21.336 A:middle
or your app is featured in one

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:24.726 A:middle
of the categories
in the App Store.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.076 A:middle
But with thousands
of apps coming

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.586 A:middle
on the App Store every
day, natural discovery

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.206 A:middle
of your app becomes
increasingly difficult

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:35.986 A:middle
and you don't have
much control on it.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.136 A:middle
So what can you do
to take more control

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
of the success of your app?

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.776 A:middle
You can advertise.

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.036 A:middle
When you advertise, you
can find the right users

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:50.716 A:middle
that will make the difference.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.116 A:middle
And when it comes to advertising
your apps or your products

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.786 A:middle
to millions of Apple
costumers around the world,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.376 A:middle
iAd is your best choice.

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:11.316 A:middle
Why? Because iAd is part of
Apple, and we know Apple users,

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.036 A:middle
all 800 million of them.

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:18.886 A:middle
We know what apps and other
items content they downloaded

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.236 A:middle
and we know how and
when they use it.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.966 A:middle
Last June, we introduced
iAd Workbench.

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:31.066 A:middle
It's self-service mobile
advertising platform

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:36.186 A:middle
that provides you the simplest
way to promote your product

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.846 A:middle
to millions of Apple
users around the world.

00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.496 A:middle
Since we introduced
iAd Workbench,

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.906 A:middle
we have successfully
helped developers,

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:50.056 A:middle
many of them advertising for the
very first time, drive millions

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.706 A:middle
of visits to their
iTunes product pages.

00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:56.906 A:middle
iAd Workbench is
open to everyone.

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.506 A:middle
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.506 A:middle
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
You can promote your apps.

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.436 A:middle
You can promote your products,
your brands, your service,

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.256 A:middle
including your iTunes content,

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.656 A:middle
whether it's music,
books or movies.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.756 A:middle
Last June when we
introduced iAd Workbench,

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:22.266 A:middle
we started in the U.S.
as the first market.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.896 A:middle
And then a few months
after that,

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.886 A:middle
we expanded internationally.

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.136 A:middle
iAd Workbench is now
available in 14 countries

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.116 A:middle
and expanding rapidly.

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:37.986 A:middle
Now creating a campaign using
iAd Workbench is very easy.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.536 A:middle
You can create one in
just a few minutes.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:48.036 A:middle
To demonstrate, why don't I have
Ravi show you how easy it is

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.446 A:middle
to advertise using
iAd Workbench.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paresh.

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:53.256 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.206 A:middle
I'm Ravi Chittari from
iAd Engineering team.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
I'm here to demo iAd Workbench.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.256 A:middle
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.256 A:middle
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:10.656 A:middle
During this demo, you will see
several options, but I'm going

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.196 A:middle
to focus on a few and
will cover more later.

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:15.786 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:21.666 A:middle
iAd Workbench is accessible
through iadworkbench.apple.com.

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:25.846 A:middle
All you need is an
Apple ID to log in.

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:30.026 A:middle
When you log in, the first page
you go to is the Dashboard.

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.926 A:middle
Dashboard is a summary
of all the campaigns,

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:35.266 A:middle
and also it gives basic metrics.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.156 A:middle
To get into the campaign
creation flow,

00:04:38.636 --> 00:04:39.916 A:middle
let's click on Create Campaign.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.486 A:middle
The first choice you have is
what do you want to promote?

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.316 A:middle
App or a Product?

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:55.096 A:middle
Let's select App.

00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:59.256 A:middle
Below are the three apps that
are published to the App Store

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.846 A:middle
from my developer account.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.846 A:middle
from my developer account.

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.416 A:middle
iAd Workbench automatically gets
all the apps that you published

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:07.786 A:middle
to the App Store and
makes it available here

00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.666 A:middle
so you can promote
through campaigns.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:13.716 A:middle
Let me select Klara.

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:19.896 A:middle
For a bid type, my goal
is to drive downloads.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
I'm going to select
CPC, cost per click.

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
Let me name my campaign.

00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:37.966 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
me to step 2, Targeting.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:40.936 A:middle
Targeting is all about
finding the right audience

00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:41.546 A:middle
for your campaign.

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.746 A:middle
We have two options,
Auto and Manual.

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:49.166 A:middle
In case of Auto, iAd finds
the right audience for you.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.786 A:middle
In case of Manual, you get to
set the targeting preferences.

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.956 A:middle
Let me set up Auto.

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.986 A:middle
Next, country where
your ad is going to run.

00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
I'm going to select
United States.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
I'm going to select
United States.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:05.286 A:middle
Next, Ad. Ad is a combination
of Creative and Destination.

00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:08.456 A:middle
I'm going to select
Banner for Creative

00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
and Destination: iTunes.

00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:15.136 A:middle
iTunes destination refers to
the App Store product page

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.796 A:middle
where user can review
the app details

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.176 A:middle
and download the app
right from there.

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.116 A:middle
Next, flight dates.

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:26.646 A:middle
These are the dates during which
your campaign is going to run.

00:06:27.556 --> 00:06:30.446 A:middle
The default started is today
and ended is a month from now.

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.806 A:middle
Let's leave it as is.

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:33.826 A:middle
Next, budget.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.166 A:middle
How much money you are willing
to spend on this campaign?

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.406 A:middle
Let me enter 2,000 dollars.

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:41.996 A:middle
Daily Spend Goal is
automatically calculated.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.916 A:middle
CPC Bid: how much you are
willing to pay per click,

00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.506 A:middle
the maximum you're
willing to pay per click.

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:54.546 A:middle
You may enter 50 cents.

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.456 A:middle
Let's leave the CPA
Goal optional.

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.496 A:middle
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.496 A:middle
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
of impressions and tabs.

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
If you want to see more
impressions and tabs,

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.526 A:middle
you can change the combination
of targeting, budget,

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:17.056 A:middle
and bid, and you'll see more.

00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:18.586 A:middle
Next, let's name our line.

00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:21.876 A:middle
I've used the term "line"
several times in this page.

00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:23.216 A:middle
What is line?

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:27.576 A:middle
A line is a combination of
targeting, budget, and bid.

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.626 A:middle
You can have several
lines in a campaign.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:34.626 A:middle
I'm going to name this
line, My Simple Auto Line.

00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:39.756 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take me
to the Targeting Summary page

00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
where all the lines are listed.

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.436 A:middle
For this campaign, we
have just one line.

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:47.626 A:middle
You can always add more lines by
clicking on Create Line button.

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:54.226 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us to
step 3, which is Creating an Ad.

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.846 A:middle
The first choice we have
is selecting a device

00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:58.876 A:middle
where your ad is going to run.

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.726 A:middle
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.726 A:middle
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:05.136 A:middle
and gave iPhone,
iPad on Universal.

00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:06.556 A:middle
Let's select Universal.

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:09.286 A:middle
For language, let's
stick with English.

00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:10.916 A:middle
We have more choices
there as well.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
Then let's define the creative.

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:18.166 A:middle
There are two choices, Using a
Template and From My Desktop.

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.966 A:middle
From My Desktop is
upload your own Banner.

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.366 A:middle
But for now, let's
select templates.

00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:31.276 A:middle
We have built several templates
for you to make it easy.

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:36.666 A:middle
As you can see, there
are different formats

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.466 A:middle
for these templates.

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:39.476 A:middle
Let me select marigold.

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:46.106 A:middle
For title, let's give
the name of the app.

00:08:47.046 --> 00:08:50.106 A:middle
And for message, few
words about your app.

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:56.776 A:middle
And for Call to Action, you
have several predefined ones

00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:58.626 A:middle
or you can always
enter a custom text.

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.486 A:middle
I'm going to select
Download Now.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.486 A:middle
I'm going to select
Download Now.

00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:06.526 A:middle
And here is the preview of
how your Banner is going

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.306 A:middle
to look on the device.

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.106 A:middle
You can click on View All Sizes

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.126 A:middle
to see how we have prepared
this creative for iPhone, iPad,

00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:15.056 A:middle
portrait and landscape.

00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:23.056 A:middle
Let's select their
destination, iTunes.

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:29.006 A:middle
As you saw, as soon as I
selected the destination,

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:34.886 A:middle
it's pointing to the
Klara iTunes product page.

00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:38.056 A:middle
For this ad to go live,
we need to associate this

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.316 A:middle
with the line that
we just created.

00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:45.056 A:middle
I'm assigning to the line.

00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:52.476 A:middle
We give that name, Marigold 1.

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:55.686 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page

00:09:56.316 --> 00:09:57.436 A:middle
where you will see all the ads

00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:58.806 A:middle
that are created
for this campaign.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:01.526 --> 00:10:03.926 A:middle
And you can always
create more Ads from here

00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:05.566 A:middle
by clicking on Create Ad.

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.066 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us
to the Campaign Summary page

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.946 A:middle
where you can review all
the details in one place.

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:13.896 A:middle
Where you're promoting,

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:16.946 A:middle
what you're targeting,
what are your ads.

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:20.856 A:middle
In case you have not
set up the payment yet,

00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:24.636 A:middle
which is a credit card,
you can always click here,

00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:25.816 A:middle
but let's Submit.

00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:32.236 A:middle
When you submit, the
creatives are submitted

00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:33.966 A:middle
for iAd's Certification review.

00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
Once they are approved,
your campaign goes live.

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:39.746 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:42.086 A:middle
Back to you, Paresh.

00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:47.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So next, let's take a deeper
dive at the tools, options,

00:10:47.686 --> 00:10:49.676 A:middle
controls, flexibility you have

00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:53.596 A:middle
in making advertising
work using iAd Workbench.

00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:02.526 A:middle
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:02.526 A:middle
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:08.326 A:middle
the controls you have in
setting your price, the tools

00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:11.446 A:middle
and options you have to create
an ad that will make an impact,

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.366 A:middle
and finally, the data
and insights you have

00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.936 A:middle
to understand your campaign
performance and optimize.

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.826 A:middle
Let's start with
choosing your audience.

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
Selecting the right audience
for your app or product is key.

00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.126 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, we
make it very easy for you

00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:32.516 A:middle
to define your audience.

00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:37.896 A:middle
At the highest level,
you have two options.

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:39.686 A:middle
Auto and Manual.

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:44.766 A:middle
Auto targeting, which you saw
in the demo is the simplest

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:47.726 A:middle
and probably the most powerful
option we have on iAd Workbench.

00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:52.386 A:middle
This is where iAd does all
the heavy lifting for you.

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:56.656 A:middle
If you want control,
you can choose Manual.

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.396 A:middle
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.396 A:middle
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:03.666 A:middle
to define your audience.

00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:07.516 A:middle
On the left side, you see
simple targeting options

00:12:08.246 --> 00:12:12.256 A:middle
like gender, age,
geo, and device.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:16.566 A:middle
You can choose, for age, you
can choose specific age groups

00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:17.636 A:middle
that you want to target.

00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:23.206 A:middle
For geo, you can choose
or specify states and DMAs

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.786 A:middle
that you want to
target for your users.

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:29.366 A:middle
On the right side, there are
some very powerful options.

00:12:30.836 --> 00:12:35.046 A:middle
Starting to the top, iTunes
Preferences is an option

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.486 A:middle
that is exclusive to iAd.

00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:41.036 A:middle
This is where the
power of the App Store

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.026 A:middle
and the iTunes Store
comes together

00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:45.686 A:middle
to help you find
the right audience.

00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:51.616 A:middle
When you make a selection here,
you're basically selecting users

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:57.066 A:middle
who have actually downloaded
content in that category.

00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:01.406 A:middle
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:01.406 A:middle
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:05.716 A:middle
wouldn't it be great if you
could choose the audience

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.406 A:middle
who like to download
health and fitness apps,

00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:12.696 A:middle
or who like to download
fitness and workout music.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.856 A:middle
With iAd Workbench,
you can do that.

00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:17.776 A:middle
It's very powerful.

00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
The next three options
lets you define

00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:24.766 A:middle
where your ad wants-where
you want to show your ad,

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:26.206 A:middle
which is App Channels.

00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:30.336 A:middle
When you want to show
your ad, that's scheduling

00:13:31.146 --> 00:13:34.546 A:middle
and how often do you want to
show an ad to a particular user,

00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:36.076 A:middle
which is frequency capping.

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:40.046 A:middle
You can mix and match
any of these options

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
to define the right
audience for your campaign.

00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:48.586 A:middle
Next, let's look at the
flexibility you have

00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:49.606 A:middle
in setting your price.

00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:55.046 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, you
can choose how you want

00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:56.236 A:middle
to pay for your campaign.

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.606 A:middle
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.606 A:middle
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.806 A:middle
If you want to pay for
every thousand impressions,

00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:05.676 A:middle
you can choose CPM.

00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:10.416 A:middle
The bid you enter is the
maximum you're willing to pay

00:14:10.936 --> 00:14:12.006 A:middle
when you win the auction.

00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:16.086 A:middle
iAd Workbench is a
bidded marketplace.

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:20.286 A:middle
And on this platform, you
have the peace of mind to know

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:27.106 A:middle
that you only pay a penny more
than the next highest bidder.

00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
Now let's look at the options
you have in creating your ad.

00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.256 A:middle
There are a range
of options you have

00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:35.066 A:middle
when it comes to
selecting your ad.

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:40.876 A:middle
You can have Banner Ads, Video
Ads, which are also known

00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:45.246 A:middle
as pre-roll, and Rich-Media Ads
if you want higher engagement

00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:50.786 A:middle
of the users with your ads.

00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:54.426 A:middle
Banner ads provide a
direct path to action.

00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:58.016 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can take a user directly

00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:04.816 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner,
you can also take a user

00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:10.146 A:middle
and show them a video and then
take them to iTunes product page

00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:11.386 A:middle
or to a mobile website.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:16.706 A:middle
Let's take a look as an example
how a banner ad looks like.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:21.456 A:middle
Here's an app, you see the
ad will render at the bottom.

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:25.416 A:middle
After a few seconds,
the ad will refresh,

00:15:27.336 --> 00:15:28.916 A:middle
the user engages with the ad.

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:33.316 A:middle
And when the user clicks on it,

00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:35.066 A:middle
the user is taken
to the App Store.

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:38.266 A:middle
The user can download
the app at this point.

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:42.036 A:middle
Now once the user
downloads the app,

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:46.916 A:middle
you don't show the same
download ad again to this user,

00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:52.646 A:middle
which means you don't waste your
money showing your ads to users

00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.466 A:middle
who already have your app.

00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.696 A:middle
Next is Video ads.

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.406 A:middle
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.406 A:middle
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.866 A:middle
They play directly
in fullscreen mode.

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:10.196 A:middle
With video ads, you can also
have an optional call to action

00:16:10.756 --> 00:16:11.836 A:middle
which will take the user

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.896 A:middle
to an iTunes product
page or a mobile website.

00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:17.606 A:middle
Here's an example of a video ad.

00:16:17.606 --> 00:16:19.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
You can chase light,

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:22.316 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.776 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.896 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:34.626 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available in the App Store.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As you noticed, there
was a Learn More link

00:16:36.376 --> 00:16:37.496 A:middle
at the bottom of that video.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.686 A:middle
The user clicks on that Learn
More link and the user is taken

00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:42.676 A:middle
to the iTunes product page.

00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:45.036 A:middle
You can also have the user
go to a mobile website.

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:51.276 A:middle
If you want to create rich-media
ads for more higher engagement,

00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:53.906 A:middle
you can do that using
iAd Workbench as well.

00:16:55.226 --> 00:16:57.976 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can immerse your users

00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:01.676 A:middle
into a very custom product
or brand experience.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:01.676 A:middle
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:06.046 A:middle
You can choose any combination
of features and any combination

00:17:06.046 --> 00:17:08.386 A:middle
of call to actions to
create a rich-media ad.

00:17:09.116 --> 00:17:10.356 A:middle
I'll show you an example

00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:14.586 A:middle
that the client had actually
used really good features

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:16.376 A:middle
to create a great experience.

00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:17.675 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:19.326 A:middle
Here's the app.

00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:22.756 A:middle
You see the ad being rendered.

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:27.056 A:middle
The user taps on the ad,
and is taken-is immersed

00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:28.185 A:middle
into a brand experience.

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.056 A:middle
The user can browse through
the pictures gallery.

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:39.776 A:middle
The user is still
within the app.

00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:41.566 A:middle
You can take the
user to Facebook

00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.486 A:middle
so you can have a
Facebook integration.

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.206 A:middle
You can have the user like
your page on Facebook.

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:52.906 A:middle
You can have the reservations
module within the ad.

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:55.916 A:middle
And finally, you can even
integrate the app download right

00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:58.176 A:middle
from this place.

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.016 A:middle
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.016 A:middle
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:02.226 A:middle
when it comes to rich-media ads.

00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:08.126 A:middle
Now that awesome ad was
created using a free tool

00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:12.606 A:middle
that is available to everyone
which is called iAd Producer.

00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:19.196 A:middle
With iAd Producer, you can
create highly interactive

00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:19.846 A:middle
rich-media ads.

00:18:21.126 --> 00:18:24.266 A:middle
They made it so easy for
you that you can just drag

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.916 A:middle
and drop your assets
in a visual layout.

00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.056 A:middle
Or you can customize
the visual layout.

00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:35.526 A:middle
We provide you with an extensive
library of over 500 blueprints

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.156 A:middle
which are like templates.

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:39.516 A:middle
And when you use one
of these blueprints,

00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:42.466 A:middle
they come with built-in
performance and analytics

00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:46.166 A:middle
so you can see how your user
is engaging and interacting

00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:47.996 A:middle
with the rich-media ad.

00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:51.436 A:middle
And finally, with
iAd Producer 4.2

00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:53.786 A:middle
that was introduced
just two weeks ago,

00:18:53.826 --> 00:19:00.156 A:middle
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:53.826 --> 00:19:00.156 A:middle
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.656 A:middle
if you create an ad
using iAd Producer,

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:06.466 A:middle
you can now upload it
directly on to Workbench.

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
And when you go to Workbench,
you'll have it available to use.

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.516 A:middle
So once you create
your campaign,

00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:20.326 A:middle
your campaign is
running and you want

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.906 A:middle
to see how the campaign
is performing.

00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:26.126 A:middle
When it comes to
campaign performance,

00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:28.866 A:middle
we provide you rich analytics

00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:31.556 A:middle
that helps you understand
how your campaign is doing

00:19:31.556 --> 00:19:33.046 A:middle
so you can take the
right actions.

00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:36.556 A:middle
We give you data,
performance metrics,

00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:38.946 A:middle
as well as conversion metrics
which includes, you know,

00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.906 A:middle
what your spend is,
your capture rate is,

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:44.556 A:middle
number of impressions you
got, as well as the downloads

00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
that you've received so
you can tune your campaign.

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:51.236 A:middle
We provide you this
data at every level

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:55.366 A:middle
at the aggregate
campaign level as well

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:59.966 A:middle
as at lower line and ad levels.

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:03.936 A:middle
You can also download this
data as a .CSV file from any

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.876 A:middle
of the analytic screens.

00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
So, at this point, I'll ask
Ravi to walk us through some

00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.676 A:middle
of these tools and
options that we talked

00:20:11.676 --> 00:20:13.766 A:middle
about to make your
advertising work.

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:15.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paresh.

00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:22.926 A:middle
In this demo, I'm going
to walk you through some

00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:24.926 A:middle
of the core concepts that
Paresh has mentioned,

00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:29.596 A:middle
touch and targeting, some of
the new ad formats analytics.

00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:31.886 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:35.936 A:middle
I've been working on a
campaign I'm halfway through it,

00:20:37.146 --> 00:20:39.056 A:middle
let's finish this
campaign together.

00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.086 A:middle
I created a campaign and
created just one line

00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:50.376 A:middle
with a manual targeting
and I want

00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:52.116 A:middle
to finish-show you
what targeting I've set

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:57.416 A:middle
up by editing the
line and later,

00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.896 A:middle
we'll add ads to this one.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:10.146 A:middle
A targeting option, we're going
to select as Manual and this-and

00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:12.576 A:middle
for the country, let's
leave it as United States.

00:21:12.696 --> 00:21:17.026 A:middle
And these are the
different targeting options

00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
that we have available.

00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:23.256 A:middle
You can see all the options
on the left-hand side.

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:26.566 A:middle
On the right, you will see the
options that we have selected.

00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:28.176 A:middle
By default, it's All.

00:21:30.516 --> 00:21:35.936 A:middle
Next, I'm going to target
few of the app references.

00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:43.886 A:middle
I'm going to select Lifestyle,
Photo and Video and Travel.

00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:48.896 A:middle
Then for App Channels, I
want to do similar thing.

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:51.946 A:middle
I'm going to do Lifestyle,

00:21:52.126 --> 00:21:56.946 A:middle
I'm going to do Photo
and Video and Travel.

00:21:58.746 --> 00:22:02.076 A:middle
You can always select
more based upon,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.746 --> 00:22:02.076 A:middle
You can always select
more based upon,

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.066 A:middle
you know, how it's performing.

00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:08.486 A:middle
For app type, last time we
did for creative: banner.

00:22:09.906 --> 00:22:12.026 A:middle
This time we're going to
do video as a creative

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.716 A:middle
to a website as a destination.

00:22:15.746 --> 00:22:17.666 A:middle
My goal here is to drive
traffic to the website.

00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:23.706 A:middle
And for flight dates,
let's leave it as a default

00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:27.226 A:middle
and I've given some
spend, budget and bid here.

00:22:27.226 --> 00:22:35.076 A:middle
Let's go to the next step
where we can create an ad.

00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:39.726 A:middle
Here we have two choices,
a banner or a video.

00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.776 A:middle
Let's select video.

00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:48.486 A:middle
And where your ad-you want
your ad to run for devices

00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.746 A:middle
for maximum reach,
let's pick Universal.

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:54.926 A:middle
For language, let's
keep it at English.

00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.556 A:middle
And here we are at a step where
we need to upload a video file.

00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:05.436 A:middle
iAd Workbench supports
two formats


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:05.436 A:middle
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
for the video file,
.M4V and .MOV.

00:23:09.406 --> 00:23:11.156 A:middle
There are few more
specs here right here.

00:23:12.616 --> 00:23:14.586 A:middle
We encourage you to follow
the specs so you don't trip

00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:15.666 A:middle
on any validation errors.

00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.656 A:middle
Let's upload.

00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:24.936 A:middle
The file is being
uploaded from my laptop

00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:28.556 A:middle
to the Workbench
servers right now.

00:23:28.626 --> 00:23:30.156 A:middle
Once the file reaches
the servers,

00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:34.006 A:middle
the file will be transcoded
to multiple formats

00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:37.336 A:middle
to suit the devices
and resolutions

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:41.836 A:middle
like iPhone high res, low res,
iPad high res and low res.

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
It's uploading right now.

00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:50.386 A:middle
Let it take its time.

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.556 A:middle
I guess everybody is using
the network bandwidth I guess.

00:23:57.026 --> 00:23:58.876 A:middle
So, right now it seems like
the file has reached the server

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.926 A:middle
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.926 A:middle
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

00:24:02.686 --> 00:24:04.886 A:middle
This is when the video
transcoding is happening.

00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:09.026 A:middle
It's actually transforming the
video to suit the other devices.

00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:12.536 A:middle
Let's take a quick review.

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
You can chase light

00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:22.906 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

00:24:22.906 --> 00:24:24.356 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:27.676 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:37.796 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available from the App Store.

00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:38.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was a cool video.

00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:42.056 A:middle
I just want to highlight
one thing here.

00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
For you as an advertiser,
prepare one file

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.056 A:middle
to one technical
specification and be assured

00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:57.746 A:middle
that your ad-video ad is going
to run on all the Apple devices

00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:10.806 A:middle
to create a video ad here.

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:15.466 A:middle
Use this ad format, we encourage
you to take advantage of it.

00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:16.776 A:middle
Let's select the destination.

00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:19.916 A:middle
As I said I'm going
to the website.

00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
You can view the URL right here.

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:33.356 A:middle
And then it will ask you for
the destination, for the name.

00:25:34.246 --> 00:25:35.706 A:middle
I like the name LightRight
website here.

00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:38.276 A:middle
So I'm going to leave it as is.

00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
For this app to go live, you
need to assign to the line.

00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:43.316 A:middle
I'm going to assign to the video
line that I created earlier.

00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:47.986 A:middle
Let's name the ad.

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.476 A:middle
I'm going to name it
as My Awesome Video.

00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:07.456 A:middle
So, that's the demo of the
powerful ad format video ad.

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:14.676 A:middle
So far in my two
demos, we mainly focused

00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:17.276 A:middle
on creating a campaign,
on editing a campaign,

00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:19.926 A:middle
focused on a little bit on
targeting and ad formats.

00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:24.146 A:middle
Once a campaign is
created, the next thing

00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:27.686 A:middle
to focus is monitoring the
performance of the campaign

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:33.136 A:middle
to ensure that it is going
towards the goal you have set

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:33.526 A:middle
out for.

00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.306 A:middle
In order to monitor the
performance of the campaign,

00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:41.206 A:middle
we have some analytics.

00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
So, next, I want you to
take-I want to take you

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:45.846 A:middle
to the analytics pages.

00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:51.626 A:middle
I have these two campaigns
that have been running

00:26:51.626 --> 00:26:54.066 A:middle
for the last 6 months.

00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.886 A:middle
I want to show the
performance of these campaigns.

00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:01.406 A:middle
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:01.406 A:middle
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:04.486 A:middle
impressions, TTR
and conversions.

00:27:04.986 --> 00:27:09.386 A:middle
You can click on any of these
metrics and go into the details.

00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:14.556 A:middle
By default, it gives
Since Campaign Start

00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:20.426 A:middle
and you have different custom
data groups you can select

00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:21.356 A:middle
that we have prepared for you.

00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:23.146 A:middle
Let me select last 30 days.

00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.076 A:middle
That's the spend for the last
30 days for this campaign.

00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.456 A:middle
Seems like we are spending
more in the weekends

00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:34.786 A:middle
and spend is coming down
during the weekdays.

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:38.986 A:middle
You have different
metrics that you can view.

00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:40.166 A:middle
I've listed here.

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:48.276 A:middle
And you can overlay any
metric on top of it.

00:27:48.496 --> 00:27:50.746 A:middle
Or if you want to compare
how you've been spending,

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.056 A:middle
compare to the previous period,

00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:56.316 A:middle
you can always select
Compare with Previous Period.

00:27:57.256 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.256 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:06.296 A:middle
to the previous 30 days.

00:28:06.326 --> 00:28:08.246 A:middle
Overlay is a pretty neat feature

00:28:08.246 --> 00:28:17.166 A:middle
where you can overlay any metric
here and compare to the spend.

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
I ordered average CPA metric.

00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:22.226 A:middle
It seems like we are doing less

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.646 A:middle
than 2 dollars for
download here.

00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:28.286 A:middle
Let's go into the lines.

00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.906 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the cumulative number.

00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:36.936 A:middle
You can always select
Time, Time Series graph

00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:38.376 A:middle
to see how the lines
are performing.

00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:42.116 A:middle
It seems like we are spending
more on this line than this one.

00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:50.026 A:middle
And you can do similar
analysis on ad side as well.

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:53.066 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the spend for cumulative.

00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:56.466 A:middle
You can always change
the metrics and change

00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:57.566 A:middle
to the time series graph.

00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.626 A:middle
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:04.786 A:middle
Let me go back to
the summary and find

00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:05.686 A:middle
out a couple of things here.

00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:08.886 A:middle
You can easily toggle between
a graph and a table view

00:29:09.296 --> 00:29:10.156 A:middle
if you choose to do so.

00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:16.536 A:middle
Or if you can scroll down and
you can click on Download CSV

00:29:16.536 --> 00:29:22.136 A:middle
to get a file onto your
desktop and do offline analysis.

00:29:22.816 --> 00:29:25.676 A:middle
And Download CSV is available
across the board on Dashboard

00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:28.946 A:middle
on every analytic
space that we have.

00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:35.176 A:middle
So, that's a quick
overview of, you know,

00:29:35.176 --> 00:29:37.576 A:middle
how to measure the
performance of your campaign.

00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:42.056 A:middle
All the data that I've been
showing in last 5 minutes,

00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.376 A:middle
that data is available
through the API.

00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:48.346 A:middle
So, next, I'm going to drop you
through the complete overview

00:29:48.346 --> 00:29:51.216 A:middle
of iAd Workbench API that
we have released this year.

00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:54.966 A:middle
So, your-you are an advertiser.

00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:57.586 A:middle
You have created
multiple campaigns

00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:00.336 A:middle
and managing all
those campaigns.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:00.336 A:middle
and managing all
those campaigns.

00:30:01.336 --> 00:30:03.756 A:middle
And you want to scale
beyond the web interface.

00:30:05.556 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
API is for you.

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.076 A:middle
Say you're an advertiser who
wanted to get the metrics

00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:14.216 A:middle
and incorporate it to
your own dashboards.

00:30:15.516 --> 00:30:16.356 A:middle
API is for you.

00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:19.586 A:middle
Let's get into the-more details.

00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:22.456 A:middle
You can also use it
for bulk operations.

00:30:26.316 --> 00:30:29.176 A:middle
API has two broad categories.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:37.576 A:middle
Reporting, where you can get the
metrics and perform the offline

00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:38.636 A:middle
and real-time analysis.

00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:42.966 A:middle
What do I mean by
real-time analysis here?

00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
You can write a program for
example that runs at the top

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:50.446 A:middle
of every hour, get some
metrics, analyze the data

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:53.296 A:middle
and modify your campaign data.

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:57.426 A:middle
You can trace the bid, start
and stop a campaign ad.

00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.456 A:middle
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.456 A:middle
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:04.296 A:middle
For offline analysis, you
can do your own dashboards.

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:11.196 A:middle
And campaign management, you
can get the campaign details,

00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:13.956 A:middle
update the critical
campaign data and start

00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:15.926 A:middle
and stop campaign lines or ads.

00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:20.996 A:middle
Let's get into some very basics.

00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:22.256 A:middle
We're talking about API here.

00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:29.876 A:middle
For communication, API
uses JSON or HTTPS.

00:31:29.876 --> 00:31:33.326 A:middle
We want to keep the data
protocol pretty simple

00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
so it's easy to understand
and it's easy to test.

00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:41.266 A:middle
We use JSON for data protocol
and secure HTTPS for security.

00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:50.306 A:middle
The next: authentication, we use
client certificates, private key

00:31:50.306 --> 00:31:55.106 A:middle
and access token as a
combination for authentication,

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.776 A:middle
making it a very
strong authentication.

00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

00:32:03.616 --> 00:32:05.896 A:middle
so you can be having
web interface

00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:08.086 A:middle
for that on Workbench app.

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:13.466 A:middle
So, how do you initiate
this API?

00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:17.826 A:middle
We have three basic
steps: download keys,

00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:19.676 A:middle
verify keys and integrate.

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:25.886 A:middle
Go to Workbench,
go to the API page,

00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.126 A:middle
click on the Download
link to download the keys.

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.696 A:middle
When you download the keys,
we give you a .zip file

00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:34.446 A:middle
that has keys and
sample programs.

00:32:34.576 --> 00:32:39.826 A:middle
And sample programs are
already embedded with your keys.

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:42.616 A:middle
Run those sample programs
and verify the keys.

00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:47.686 A:middle
And then download the
API programming guide,

00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:53.096 A:middle
write your own programs,
deploy them on your servers

00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:56.196 A:middle
and integrate, that's
how simple it is.

00:32:57.946 --> 00:33:00.296 A:middle
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.946 --> 00:33:00.296 A:middle
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

00:33:00.776 --> 00:33:05.996 A:middle
We have InitSession for session
initialization, which is key

00:33:06.436 --> 00:33:08.506 A:middle
because you need to pass the
sessionId for every method

00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:11.476 A:middle
that you are going to call
in your program for API.

00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
Campaign method-metadata methods
to get the campaign details,

00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:20.226 A:middle
reporting API to
get the metrics.

00:33:20.226 --> 00:33:26.626 A:middle
And campaign management
API to update the details

00:33:26.626 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
as well as start and stop.

00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:33.856 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
walk you through some

00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:36.926 A:middle
of the sample program that
I've already done using the

00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:39.136 A:middle
highlighted methods
here, InitSession,

00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:45.746 A:middle
GetCampaignDetails
and UpdateLine.

00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:49.836 A:middle
So, here is a sample program,
sample method where I'm trying

00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:53.666 A:middle
to pass access token,
prepare the request tab,

00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:00.386 A:middle
post it to the server
then get the response back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:00.386 A:middle
post it to the server
then get the response back

00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:03.646 A:middle
and read the session from that,
sessionId from the response.

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:08.786 A:middle
Once I get the sessionId,
I pass the sessionId

00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:14.826 A:middle
to getCampaignDetails method,
get the campaign IDs and filter

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:18.246 A:middle
by running state, post
that to the server,

00:34:18.246 --> 00:34:20.646 A:middle
get the response back.

00:34:22.386 --> 00:34:27.686 A:middle
Next, for the campaign details
I got, I'm passing the LineId

00:34:27.686 --> 00:34:29.005 A:middle
for which I want to
increase the bid.

00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:33.426 A:middle
So I gave the line-SessionId,
LineId and the CPMBid,

00:34:37.016 --> 00:34:40.096 A:middle
post to server, and
get the response back.

00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.275 A:middle
That's how simple it is
to write the programs

00:34:44.275 --> 00:34:49.206 A:middle
to communicate with the API.

00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:55.545 A:middle
Powerful, secure and easy
to use, go try it out.

00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
through what's coming next.

00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:03.486 A:middle
There you go Paresh.

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:05.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ravi.

00:35:05.786 --> 00:35:08.286 A:middle
It's fascinating what
you can do with the APIs

00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:10.816 A:middle
and how you can make bulk
changes to your campaigns

00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.176 A:middle
from your own user interface.

00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:17.506 A:middle
So, what's coming this fall?

00:35:17.706 --> 00:35:21.146 A:middle
So far, we've talked about
how iAd Workbench can help you

00:35:21.146 --> 00:35:22.706 A:middle
acquire new customers.

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:25.556 A:middle
But that's just half the battle.

00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:30.566 A:middle
For you to grow your business,
you also need to re-engage

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:34.586 A:middle
with your existing customers
and have them do more

00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:39.566 A:middle
of what you want, whether it's
spending more time in your app,

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:42.966 A:middle
buying more of your products,
or even trying your new apps.

00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:47.116 A:middle
I came across a study
recently on the web

00:35:48.086 --> 00:35:49.866 A:middle
by a mobile analytics
firm, Localytics,

00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:53.196 A:middle
which said 22 percent
of the apps

00:35:53.196 --> 00:35:58.286 A:middle
that were downloaded were used
only once and over 60 percent

00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.416 A:middle
of them were used
less than 10 times.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.416 A:middle
of them were used
less than 10 times.

00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:05.516 A:middle
Now, you want users
to frequently engage

00:36:05.516 --> 00:36:07.346 A:middle
with your app or your website.

00:36:07.796 --> 00:36:11.766 A:middle
Let's take a few examples
how engaged-re-engaging

00:36:11.766 --> 00:36:14.076 A:middle
with your customers can
help you grow your business.

00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:19.816 A:middle
First example is
about a game app.

00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:26.536 A:middle
So you came up with a new iPad
version of your iPhone game.

00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:32.326 A:middle
Now, who will be the best
customers for this new app?

00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:37.156 A:middle
Of course, the users who
use that game on the iPhone.

00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
What if you had a way to
connect with these customers

00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:48.056 A:middle
and inform them about
your new game?

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:52.126 A:middle
And what if you could inform
them about this new game

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:56.966 A:middle
when they are on their iPad?

00:36:57.106 --> 00:36:59.296 A:middle
Or, say you enhanced your app

00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:01.466 A:middle
and you added more
levels more game levels


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:01.466 A:middle
and you added more
levels more game levels

00:37:01.546 --> 00:37:05.886 A:middle
or you have more things that
you want to sell in your app.

00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:10.636 A:middle
What if you had a way to
re-engage with the users

00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:17.196 A:middle
and show or promote these
levels only to users

00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:20.416 A:middle
who have reached certain
levels in your game

00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:23.436 A:middle
or show this merchandise
only to users

00:37:23.436 --> 00:37:28.086 A:middle
who actually buy
merchandise like this?

00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:32.796 A:middle
And what about all those
users who downloaded your app

00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:37.386 A:middle
but haven't used it
in the last two weeks?

00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:40.496 A:middle
What if you had a way
to reconnect with them

00:37:41.356 --> 00:37:45.496 A:middle
and motivate them to try-come
back and try your app again?

00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:47.936 A:middle
And what if you could
connect with them

00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:49.046 A:middle
when they're not in your app?

00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:51.756 A:middle
Let's take another example.

00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:55.446 A:middle
A retail app.

00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:57.026 A:middle
Say you have a retail app.

00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:00.576 A:middle
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:00.576 A:middle
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:03.206 A:middle
and add things to
the shopping basket.

00:38:04.106 --> 00:38:08.896 A:middle
Many of these users exit the
app before they actually make

00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:10.706 A:middle
a purchase.

00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:16.416 A:middle
What if you had a way to find
these users and bring them back

00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:19.126 A:middle
to finish the purchase and what

00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:22.266 A:middle
if you could bring them
back exactly at the point

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.326 A:middle
where they had left
in the shopping basket

00:38:25.296 --> 00:38:27.766 A:middle
so they can finish the
transaction in next step.

00:38:28.116 --> 00:38:33.776 A:middle
And if you want to send offers
to your loyal customers,

00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:36.416 A:middle
what if you could
show these offers

00:38:36.416 --> 00:38:38.496 A:middle
to your loyal customers
irrespective

00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:40.616 A:middle
of what iOS device they are on?

00:38:41.086 --> 00:38:47.066 A:middle
And for users and your
customers who have items

00:38:47.066 --> 00:38:50.326 A:middle
in their wish list, what if
you could reconnect with these

00:38:51.436 --> 00:38:54.436 A:middle
and inform them when the items
on the wish list are on sale?

00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:59.626 A:middle
Now, in each of these
examples that we talked about,

00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.086 A:middle
we talked about reconnecting


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.086 A:middle
we talked about reconnecting

00:39:02.086 --> 00:39:03.856 A:middle
with a specific group
of audience.

00:39:05.396 --> 00:39:08.486 A:middle
Whether it's all the customers
who have downloaded your app

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.896 A:middle
or the dormant users who
haven't used your app,

00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:17.936 A:middle
or the loyal users who do
purchases for you, or the users

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:22.186 A:middle
who have an abandoned cart
on your shopping-on your app.

00:39:22.406 --> 00:39:28.696 A:middle
We call this group of
audiences as "segments".

00:39:29.426 --> 00:39:32.976 A:middle
Now there are probably
a million ways you could

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.116 A:middle
segment audiences.

00:39:35.266 --> 00:39:38.246 A:middle
You know your business and
your app, and your users best.

00:39:38.946 --> 00:39:42.156 A:middle
So you will segment your
users the way you want it.

00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:45.326 A:middle
And for you to easily
create segments,

00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:49.876 A:middle
we're introducing a new
functionality this fall

00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:54.346 A:middle
with iOS 8 which we call
Audience Segmentation.

00:39:55.736 --> 00:39:59.026 A:middle
Building segments using Audience
Segmentation is very easy.

00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:01.386 A:middle
You can do it in just two steps.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:01.386 A:middle
You can do it in just two steps.

00:40:03.436 --> 00:40:08.686 A:middle
The first one is you get
segment IDs from iAd Workbench.

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:14.496 A:middle
Now, every segment is unique
so it has a unique segment ID.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.846 A:middle
You can download the segment
IDs from iAd Workbench.

00:40:18.906 --> 00:40:20.286 A:middle
Once you get the segment IDs,

00:40:20.986 --> 00:40:24.546 A:middle
you then integrate those
segment IDs in your app.

00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:29.886 A:middle
You map the user behavior of
the functionality you have

00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.466 A:middle
in the app with these
segment IDs.

00:40:33.816 --> 00:40:36.596 A:middle
And when the user demonstrates
a particular user behavior

00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:40.226 A:middle
or reaches a functionality,
say reaches a particular level,

00:40:41.026 --> 00:40:42.776 A:middle
you instrument it in a way

00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:48.136 A:middle
that you automatically make API
call using the new iOS 8 SDK,

00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:52.636 A:middle
and pass that segment
ID onto Workbench.

00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.736 A:middle
Now when you do that,

00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:59.366 A:middle
your segments will automatically
start getting populated

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
on iAd Workbench.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
on iAd Workbench.

00:41:00.756 --> 00:41:03.986 A:middle
Here's an example where
segmentation was done based

00:41:03.986 --> 00:41:05.976 A:middle
on time spent in an app.

00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:10.616 A:middle
To avail your segments, users
who have spent less than 1 hour

00:41:10.616 --> 00:41:17.486 A:middle
in the app, 1 to 10 hours, 10 to
20 and 20 plus hours in the app.

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:21.106 A:middle
Now, if you were to reconnect
or re-engage with these users,

00:41:21.976 --> 00:41:25.066 A:middle
you would probably have a very
different strategy when it comes

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:28.506 A:middle
to reengaging you with users
who have spent less than an hour

00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:32.306 A:middle
in your app compared to who
have spent more than 20 hours.

00:41:34.476 --> 00:41:36.256 A:middle
Here's another example

00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:39.296 A:middle
where segmentation is
based on levels of use.

00:41:41.996 --> 00:41:44.536 A:middle
Whenever a user reaches
a particular level,

00:41:45.646 --> 00:41:47.276 A:middle
they go from level 1 to level 2.

00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:50.826 A:middle
The API call that I talked
about is automatically made

00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:52.466 A:middle
from the client side
from your app

00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:54.866 A:middle
and the right segment
ID is passed

00:41:55.406 --> 00:41:57.736 A:middle
and the user gets added
to this new segment.

00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:01.616 A:middle
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:01.616 A:middle
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:07.456 A:middle
we can unlock some amazing
things which brings us

00:42:07.456 --> 00:42:09.376 A:middle
to the second thing that
we're introducing this fall,

00:42:10.326 --> 00:42:12.096 A:middle
we call it Audience Insights.

00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:17.776 A:middle
When your segments reach a
particular threshold of users,

00:42:19.176 --> 00:42:22.576 A:middle
we will show you unique audience
insights into your segments,

00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:26.826 A:middle
all for free at no charge.

00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:29.306 A:middle
These insights are
based on iTunes data.

00:42:30.726 --> 00:42:33.556 A:middle
So we'll show you how the
distribution is of the users

00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:35.976 A:middle
in your segment, the
demographic distribution.

00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:40.236 A:middle
How age, gender, household
income distribution is

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.076 A:middle
for these users.

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:46.666 A:middle
We'll show you the top regions,
the top countries, top states,

00:42:46.896 --> 00:42:51.556 A:middle
DMAs these users come from, the
top languages these users have

00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:53.976 A:middle
on their devices as well

00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:56.176 A:middle
as the top iTunes
preferences of these users.

00:42:56.176 --> 00:42:58.906 A:middle
So you know what are the things
they really like to download.

00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:02.086 A:middle
Now once you have
these unique insights,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:02.086 A:middle
Now once you have
these unique insights,

00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.566 A:middle
you can take some
very tangible actions.

00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:12.026 A:middle
If you know the demographics of
your audience in the segment,

00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:17.416 A:middle
you can fine tune your app to
suit more of the demographics.

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:23.556 A:middle
If you know the top regions and
the languages of your audience,

00:43:24.526 --> 00:43:27.136 A:middle
you might want to consider
localizing your app.

00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:30.736 A:middle
If you have an English
app and you know

00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:33.176 A:middle
that the top region
is Asia Pacific

00:43:33.176 --> 00:43:37.626 A:middle
and the top language is
Japanese, you might want

00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:39.126 A:middle
to make a Japanese app.

00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:42.126 A:middle
If you created a segment
of all your loyal users,

00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:45.756 A:middle
now you understand
the characteristics

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:46.606 A:middle
of those audience.

00:43:47.946 --> 00:43:51.676 A:middle
And then using Workbench
targeting, you can find more

00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:55.096 A:middle
of the same and you can
build your audience pool.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.176 A:middle
And finally, with
audience segmentation

00:43:58.926 --> 00:44:00.596 A:middle
and audience targeting together,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.926 --> 00:44:00.596 A:middle
and audience targeting together,

00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.966 A:middle
we can bring you
another big thing

00:44:04.656 --> 00:44:06.266 A:middle
which we are also
introducing this fall

00:44:06.806 --> 00:44:09.476 A:middle
and we call it Audience
Retargeting.

00:44:09.826 --> 00:44:15.786 A:middle
Audience retargeting lets you
re-engage with every segment

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.916 A:middle
that you have in
a customized way

00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:19.766 A:middle
so you can give a
custom experience

00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:21.506 A:middle
through each of your segments.

00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:25.306 A:middle
So now when you have
those dormant users

00:44:25.306 --> 00:44:28.916 A:middle
who didn't use your
app, you can re-engage

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.856 A:middle
with those users
with that segment.

00:44:31.566 --> 00:44:34.626 A:middle
Show them a custom message,
motivate them to come back

00:44:34.626 --> 00:44:35.526 A:middle
and try your app again.

00:44:36.026 --> 00:44:40.966 A:middle
And when you have users who
have reached a certain level

00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:43.026 A:middle
and you want to push
them to the next level,

00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:46.946 A:middle
you can create a
segment of the users

00:44:46.946 --> 00:44:48.746 A:middle
who have reached say level 2.

00:44:48.996 --> 00:44:51.946 A:middle
Show them a custom
message about level 3.

00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:56.306 A:middle
When they engage with
that, take them to level 3,

00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.886 A:middle
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.886 A:middle
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

00:45:02.336 --> 00:45:05.706 A:middle
And those users who
had an abundant cart

00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:08.976 A:middle
in your retail app,
you can now re-engage

00:45:09.136 --> 00:45:12.156 A:middle
or retarget those
users irrespective

00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:17.216 A:middle
of what device they are on and
bring them back to your app.

00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:23.176 A:middle
And not only bring them
back, deep link them directly

00:45:23.666 --> 00:45:24.486 A:middle
to the shopping basket,

00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:30.256 A:middle
so in the next step they
can finish the purchase.

00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:31.786 A:middle
So really anything is possible.

00:45:32.586 --> 00:45:37.046 A:middle
For each of your segments, you
can create that awesome message

00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.746 A:middle
and take the user to
wherever you want in the app

00:45:41.306 --> 00:45:42.366 A:middle
or even to any website.

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.096 A:middle
Now that's not it.

00:45:46.066 --> 00:45:49.656 A:middle
With audience retargeting,
we'll actually find those users

00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:52.756 A:middle
for you on any iOS device.

00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:58.106 A:middle
So now when you had that example
but you introduce your iPad app,

00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:06.096 A:middle
when they're on the iPad.

00:46:06.546 --> 00:46:11.326 A:middle
So what we are introducing
here is a cross-app,

00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.656 A:middle
cross-device retargeting.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:16.656 A:middle
That is huge.

00:46:18.556 --> 00:46:20.726 A:middle
What else is unique about this?

00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:24.186 A:middle
The first thing is
automation that comes with it.

00:46:25.036 --> 00:46:28.536 A:middle
When you build segments
using iOS 8,

00:46:29.296 --> 00:46:32.056 A:middle
your segments are automatically
updated in real-time.

00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
No more of manually harvesting
idea phase, sharing them

00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:39.026 A:middle
with your network partners.

00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:43.716 A:middle
Your data is most secure
when it's in one place.

00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:47.536 A:middle
And there's no better
place than Apple iAd.

00:46:47.536 --> 00:46:51.266 A:middle
When you create segments this
way, segmentation is automated,

00:46:52.106 --> 00:46:54.786 A:middle
audience insights run
based on segmentation,

00:46:55.616 --> 00:46:58.206 A:middle
that's real-time updated as well

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.606 A:middle
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.606 A:middle
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

00:47:02.906 --> 00:47:06.406 A:middle
The next thing is Privacy.

00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:09.606 A:middle
Audience retargeting and this
entire solution we talked

00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:12.646 A:middle
about is deeply integrated
with iOS.

00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:15.576 A:middle
So you get all the benefits

00:47:15.706 --> 00:47:18.136 A:middle
of the built-in privacy
controls that come with it.

00:47:18.576 --> 00:47:21.726 A:middle
The solution complies with
the Limit Ad Tracking.

00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:26.496 A:middle
So now if you have a user
who has Limit Ad Tracking on,

00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:30.256 A:middle
that user is removed
automatically from the segments.

00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:33.006 A:middle
So the user is not retargeted.

00:47:34.346 --> 00:47:35.476 A:middle
Everything is automated.

00:47:36.306 --> 00:47:37.396 A:middle
You have nothing to worry about.

00:47:37.836 --> 00:47:42.756 A:middle
So with Audience
Segmentation, Audience Insights,

00:47:43.316 --> 00:47:45.516 A:middle
and Audience Retargeting,

00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:50.186 A:middle
iAd becomes-iAd Workbench
becomes a complete solution.

00:47:51.256 --> 00:47:54.616 A:middle
You can, not only acquire
new users and new customers,

00:47:55.246 --> 00:47:59.566 A:middle
you can now understand your
existing users and re-engage

00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.336 A:middle
with them to grow your business.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.336 A:middle
with them to grow your business.

00:48:02.766 --> 00:48:03.466 A:middle
What else is coming?

00:48:04.096 --> 00:48:07.256 A:middle
We'll be introducing two
new ad formats this fall.

00:48:08.356 --> 00:48:11.546 A:middle
Interstitial ads which are also
called as fullscreen banners

00:48:12.686 --> 00:48:15.346 A:middle
and Medium Rectangle
also call as MREC.

00:48:16.646 --> 00:48:18.556 A:middle
Both these ad formats
will be available

00:48:18.556 --> 00:48:20.706 A:middle
on iPad as well as on iPhone.

00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:24.926 A:middle
So with that, you will have
four ad formats to choose:

00:48:25.286 --> 00:48:30.346 A:middle
the banner ads, video ads,
interstitials and MREC.

00:48:32.256 --> 00:48:33.366 A:middle
The next is we're going

00:48:33.366 --> 00:48:36.556 A:middle
to continue enhancing
the iAd Workbench APIs.

00:48:37.476 --> 00:48:39.876 A:middle
We'll introduce iAd
Workbench API 2.0

00:48:40.156 --> 00:48:42.866 A:middle
which will give you a
full read-write campaign

00:48:42.866 --> 00:48:43.896 A:middle
creation capability.

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:47.576 A:middle
So if you work with a
Demand Side Partner,

00:48:47.576 --> 00:48:51.886 A:middle
also called as DSP, you
can now have your DSP plug

00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:55.876 A:middle
into iAd Workbench and
create and manage campaigns

00:48:55.876 --> 00:48:59.066 A:middle
on your behalf from their
own UI ad interface.

00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.176 A:middle
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.176 A:middle
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,

00:49:02.016 --> 00:49:04.946 A:middle
automated way of
booking campaigns

00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:06.506 A:middle
and managing them
from your own UI.

00:49:06.756 --> 00:49:09.246 A:middle
We'll also provide you APIs
for segmentation that we talked

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.776 A:middle
about just in-a little bit ago.

00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:13.746 A:middle
And finally, we'll continue
with the geo expansion.

00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:16.736 A:middle
We'll go in more countries
and there is bunch more things

00:49:16.736 --> 00:49:17.716 A:middle
that we have in plans for you.

00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:22.976 A:middle
So to summarize, as
you saw in the demos

00:49:22.976 --> 00:49:25.946 A:middle
and throughout the talk, iAd
Workbench is the simplest way

00:49:25.946 --> 00:49:27.416 A:middle
for you to reach Apple users.

00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:31.276 A:middle
It's very powerful and
it's open to everyone.

00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:34.436 A:middle
So if you haven't tried
iAd Workbench yet,

00:49:35.396 --> 00:49:41.246 A:middle
go to iadworkbench.apple.com and
log in with just your Apple ID.

00:49:41.446 --> 00:49:44.126 A:middle
Make sure you take advantage of
the APIs that we reviewed today.

00:49:44.786 --> 00:49:47.166 A:middle
And the new ad formats
that are available now

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:48.166 A:middle
and coming in fall.

00:49:49.526 --> 00:49:53.366 A:middle
And finally, the key thing,
make sure you enable your app

00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:58.126 A:middle
for segmentation so you
can get those free insights

00:49:58.126 --> 00:50:01.046 A:middle
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage

00:50:09.356 --> 00:50:16.816 A:middle

00:50:21.656 --> 00:50:26.186 A:middle
There was a session which
is very related to some

00:50:26.186 --> 00:50:27.896 A:middle
of the things that we
talked about today.

00:50:27.896 --> 00:50:29.076 A:middle
It was yesterday.

00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:32.416 A:middle
In case you missed it, make
sure you watch it later on.

00:50:33.486 --> 00:50:34.986 A:middle
In that session,
we talked about how

00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:36.966 A:middle
to use the API for segmentation.

00:50:36.966 --> 00:50:38.156 A:middle
So if you're interested in that,

00:50:38.156 --> 00:50:40.496 A:middle
make sure you take
a look at that.

00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:40.886 A:middle
That's it.

00:50:41.296 --> 00:50:43.386 A:middle
Thank you and have a great WWDC.
