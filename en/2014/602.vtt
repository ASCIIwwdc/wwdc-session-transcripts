00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:18.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.546 A:middle
So welcome to "Ingredients
of Great Games".

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.606 A:middle
What we're going to talk
about today is some things

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:27.176 A:middle
that you can do in your game to
make it really, really great.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.876 A:middle
Because having a fun game
is simply not enough.

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:34.236 A:middle
There are things
that great games do.

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.826 A:middle
What I mean is, games that are
recognized as industry leading

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:39.286 A:middle
in the games industry.

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:40.926 A:middle
Things that they do
that you should be doing

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:44.106 A:middle
or what you really need to be
doing to make your game great.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:46.726 A:middle
And there's a massive
opportunity.

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:48.786 A:middle
As Tim talked about yesterday,

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:53.276 A:middle
there's 75 billion
downloads of applications.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.446 A:middle
And as everyone in
this room knows,

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.246 A:middle
a huge portion of
those are games.

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.586 A:middle
Game Center also reinforces this


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.586 A:middle
Game Center also reinforces this

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:06.436 A:middle
with 130 million monthly
active users last month.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.456 A:middle
That is a huge audience that
you can tap into for your game.

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.856 A:middle
But, and to do that, you need
to start with a great idea,

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:18.826 A:middle
obviously put in hard work, and
you need to follow some really,

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:21.976 A:middle
really important key tips
to make your game great.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:26.216 A:middle
So over the last couple days,
yesterday and this morning,

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:27.766 A:middle
we've been talking
about technology.

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:32.286 A:middle
And so technology like OpenGL
ES 3.0, which was introduced

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:37.566 A:middle
since WWDC last year, and is
the most advanced OpenGL ES

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.226 A:middle
out there.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:43.456 A:middle
We also have Metal, our low
level highly optimized GPU API.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:45.646 A:middle
We have Game Center,
which provides

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.636 A:middle
that social connection
for your players.

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:49.726 A:middle
SpriteKit and SceneKit.

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:52.306 A:middle
You know, let us do the
heavy lifting for you.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:55.506 A:middle
If you don't need to go
right to OpenGL or Metal,

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:56.956 A:middle
you can use SpriteKit
and SceneKit.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.876 A:middle
It'll allow you to do less
programming and let us build


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.876 A:middle
It'll allow you to do less
programming and let us build

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.736 A:middle
out efficient API
underneath your game.

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:06.956 A:middle
And Game Controllers: open your
game up to many forms of input.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:12.186 A:middle
Of course, there's also Xcode
6 with Swift and Playground.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:18.956 A:middle
We have tools like the
Metal or OpenGL Debuggers.

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.246 A:middle
We have SceneKit and
SpriteKit editors.

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:25.216 A:middle
And, also this week,
we have a mass amount

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:26.906 A:middle
of sessions about games.

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:31.736 A:middle
We have three on Metal, two
on SceneKit, two on SpriteKit.

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:34.666 A:middle
We have labs on all of
these technologies all week,

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.456 A:middle
and we have sessions
about developer tools.

00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:40.936 A:middle
But technology alone
is not enough.

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:44.076 A:middle
You can't just take the
technology, build a game on top

00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:45.426 A:middle
of it, and expect
it to be successful.

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:49.606 A:middle
You have to go about the games
business and the business

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.386 A:middle
of building a game with the
same passion that you would go

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.546 A:middle
about your game design

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.576 A:middle
or choosing your technology
or your graphics API.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
If you look at the winners

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
from the Apple Design Awards
last night, like "Threes",


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
from the Apple Design Awards
last night, like "Threes",

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:08.656 A:middle
"Leo's Fortune", "DEVICE 6",
"Blek", or "Monument Valley",

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.036 A:middle
they have some common
traits that attract,

00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:14.576 A:middle
engage and retain their players.

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:16.736 A:middle
And this engagement
is key to success.

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:22.256 A:middle
So what we find are there are
some common threads among these

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.196 A:middle
successful games.

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:26.606 A:middle
Things like, make it easy
to buy and play your game

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:28.436 A:middle
by reducing the friction.

00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:34.336 A:middle
Or refresh your content to
continually be able to retain

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:35.356 A:middle
and engage those players.

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:37.156 A:middle
As I said, engagement
is really key.

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:41.516 A:middle
We've identified these and
other traits among these games.

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:44.916 A:middle
And I'd like to invite Allan
Schaffer up on stage to talk

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.566 A:middle
about these key ingredients
for great games.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.786 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.756 A:middle
Welcome to WWDC 2014 and games.

00:03:58.456 --> 00:03:59.936 A:middle
So my name is Allan Schaffer.

00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
I'm the Game Technologies
Evangelist at Apple.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
I'm the Game Technologies
Evangelist at Apple.

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.576 A:middle
And, as Geoff said, I'm here
to talk to you about some

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:09.086 A:middle
of the things we see in some
of the best games on iOS.

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:11.996 A:middle
Now, there's a lot
of things that go

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:13.706 A:middle
into making a great game.

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:17.136 A:middle
And a lot of different ways to
describe that process, right?

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:19.956 A:middle
But to echo back to what he was
saying, when we look at games

00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:22.646 A:middle
and we think about the
Apple Design Award winners

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:25.906 A:middle
over the years, we start to
see common threads and the kind

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.746 A:middle
of key ingredients that all
of these games get right.

00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:31.296 A:middle
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:35.206 A:middle
So I'm going to go through a
list of some of these things

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:36.756 A:middle
that just really
stand out to me.

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.766 A:middle
There is a lot more than
what I'm going to go through,

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:43.446 A:middle
but here is the first
thing on my list: Okay,

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:45.706 A:middle
is to remove friction.

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:50.256 A:middle
So I'm talking here about
making a great first impression

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.916 A:middle
and a really frictionless first
time experience in the game,

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.356 A:middle
really streamlining
everything that gets in the way

00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:01.066 A:middle
of the player getting into
the game as they start.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:01.066 A:middle
of the player getting into
the game as they start.

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.376 A:middle
So what do I really
mean by friction here?

00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:07.746 A:middle
So here's our imaginary
game, "Paddle Mania 3000".

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:08.876 A:middle
It is awesome, by the way.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:12.506 A:middle
But it has some of the
problems with friction

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:13.766 A:middle
that I'm thinking of here.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.206 A:middle
So let me show you first
the start up experience

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:18.646 A:middle
of this game: Player comes in?

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:22.576 A:middle
Loading. So, yeah,
still loading.

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:24.776 A:middle
And it's going to take
it about a minute to load

00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:25.966 A:middle
because that's how
long it will take me

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.046 A:middle
to get through the slide.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.766 A:middle
So, you know, the problem
that I have or that I see here

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:33.806 A:middle
with a number of games is
that they really take kind

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:37.466 A:middle
of a monolithic approach
to loading their assets.

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:41.786 A:middle
And they preload everything
up front instead of, you know,

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
trying to just do what they
need just to get started.

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:48.366 A:middle
So your goal should
be to get interactive

00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:49.926 A:middle
as quickly as you can.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.296 A:middle
Load just enough of your
assets so that you can get up

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:55.616 A:middle
and running to your
first interactive screen.

00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:58.356 A:middle
And then use technologies
like Grand Central Dispatch,

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:02.286 A:middle
and so on, to move work off
of your main thread and so,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:02.286 A:middle
and so on, to move work off
of your main thread and so,

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:04.326 A:middle
and let that continue
asynchronously.

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:09.366 A:middle
Then, also, use the Time
Profiler to really take a look

00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:11.166 A:middle
at your loading performance.

00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:13.706 A:middle
And it will show you in a lot

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:17.836 A:middle
of detail exactly what work the
app is doing during that time.

00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:21.396 A:middle
But even before you get into
the Time Profiler, I don't want

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:24.376 A:middle
to just punt to the Time
Profiler as my advice.

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:28.616 A:middle
You have to really think
about it first, right?

00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:31.546 A:middle
Why are so many things
being loaded up front?

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.986 A:middle
And isn't there something
that could be deferred

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:39.006 A:middle
and loaded asynchronously
a little bit later?

00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.726 A:middle
So, okay. So it's done loading.

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:46.996 A:middle
And now let's go on to now
we're downloading some assets.

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:50.896 A:middle
Okay. So, you know, a lot of
you guys do this in the game.

00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:51.596 A:middle
And it's fine.

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:53.566 A:middle
In many cases, it's
a good thing.

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.406 A:middle
But it doesn't have
to be something

00:06:56.406 --> 00:06:58.586 A:middle
where it makes the player wait.

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.276 A:middle
So later in the talk I'm going
to go through a couple of things


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.276 A:middle
So later in the talk I'm going
to go through a couple of things

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
that you can do to move
this off to the side

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:07.056 A:middle
so the user doesn't
even have to notice it.

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:11.256 A:middle
Okay, next: registration.

00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:13.366 A:middle
Would I like a "Paddle
Mania" account?

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:16.386 A:middle
No, I would like to
play "Paddle Mania".

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:21.156 A:middle
So, you know, when you think
about the registration,

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:23.416 A:middle
there's a couple of
possibilities here.

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:27.166 A:middle
You know, maybe, actually
that registration is needed.

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:30.386 A:middle
Maybe you have a game
that is server backed,

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.536 A:middle
and you need some way to
uniquely identify this player.

00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:35.486 A:middle
If that's the case,

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:39.236 A:middle
then actually you could just use
the Vendor ID that we provide

00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:42.776 A:middle
to the game as the unique
identifier for that player.

00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:45.616 A:middle
And get it so that it's
out of the player's way.

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.216 A:middle
Handle it automatically.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.426 A:middle
But maybe the case isn't that
you have a server backed game.

00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:53.906 A:middle
Maybe you're just asking the
user to sign up for an account

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:57.526 A:middle
because you want to give
them news or special offers

00:07:57.526 --> 00:07:59.446 A:middle
or just whatever
the reason may be.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.516 A:middle
Well, the first-time experience

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:05.626 A:middle
in the game is not the right
time to ask for this yet.

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:09.296 A:middle
They don't who, you know,
why you might be asking.

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:12.226 A:middle
So, of course, you would
need to clearly explain it.

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.226 A:middle
Like, is it needed?

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.756 A:middle
Or is it just kind of extra?

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:19.556 A:middle
And if it's not really needed,
then defer it until later.

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:22.396 A:middle
So I want to play, I'm
going to say, no thanks.

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.246 A:middle
Next, configure my paddle.

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:27.596 A:middle
It's "Paddle Mania".

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.236 A:middle
But, so, let me be clear:

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:33.385 A:middle
If this is my first
time playing the game,

00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:35.606 A:middle
then I don't know the
implications of any

00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:38.056 A:middle
of these choices,
right, to go and play.

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:42.256 A:middle
So if they matter, then
now is not the time

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:43.775 A:middle
to ask me because I don't know.

00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:47.736 A:middle
And if they don't matter,
then don't put them in the way

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.866 A:middle
of user getting onboard
into the game.

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:55.476 A:middle
And, you know, not knowing
either way sort of conveys

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:58.886 A:middle
to the players that it's not
really-the experience here

00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.446 A:middle
hadn't really been
thought through.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.446 A:middle
hadn't really been
thought through.

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:03.056 A:middle
And so there's some real trouble
with "Paddle Mania", actually.

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.286 A:middle
And then, yeah, there we go.

00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:08.906 A:middle
The last one here:
please leave a rating.

00:09:08.906 --> 00:09:13.526 A:middle
You know, this is fine, right,
we talk about this all the time.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.356 A:middle
But, you know, at
this point, actually,

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.106 A:middle
I haven't even played
the game yet.

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:21.296 A:middle
So, you know, now is not
the best time to come

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:22.756 A:middle
and ask me about rating it.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:26.086 A:middle
But, you know, I think, you
guys are getting it here, right.

00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:28.216 A:middle
So let me give you the
takeaways of this first section:

00:09:28.216 --> 00:09:30.686 A:middle
So you've got to get the
player into the game.

00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:34.236 A:middle
Reduce the load time
and any blocking updates

00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:37.306 A:middle
to get the game interactive
as quickly as possible.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.226 A:middle
Then streamline the
registration, right.

00:09:40.486 --> 00:09:43.866 A:middle
Provide an escape from
tutorials and long intros

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.606 A:middle
and all those things that
might get in the way.

00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:49.846 A:middle
And then don't force
decisions about something

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:52.846 A:middle
that the player can't
possibly know about yet.

00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.666 A:middle
And be patient, you
know, show some restraint

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.296 A:middle
when you're asking for feedback.

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
So that's number
one: remove friction


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
So that's number
one: remove friction

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.766 A:middle
from the first time experience.

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:07.146 A:middle
Okay, here's number
two: be a good teacher.

00:10:08.196 --> 00:10:11.766 A:middle
So being a good teacher is
really all about thinking

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:13.496 A:middle
through that onboarding
experience

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.316 A:middle
and really kind of
making it fun.

00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:19.826 A:middle
Because if you can help
your players get started,

00:10:19.826 --> 00:10:22.806 A:middle
it's more likely that they'll
become more deeply engaged

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:23.676 A:middle
into the game.

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:26.406 A:middle
And, you know, it's
almost easier to think

00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:27.576 A:middle
of it on the other side.

00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:30.806 A:middle
If you just leave it
to the player to figure

00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:34.596 A:middle
out your game themselves,
then you run a lot of risks.

00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:37.466 A:middle
You risk people just
failing a couple of times

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:39.956 A:middle
and getting frustrated
and leaving the game.

00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:43.986 A:middle
Or maybe they'll miss something
that was really important

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:46.696 A:middle
to the gameplay and would
have captured their interest,

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:47.936 A:middle
but they just didn't see it.

00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:50.306 A:middle
They didn't know to
go down that path.

00:10:50.676 --> 00:10:52.906 A:middle
So yesterday during the
design award ceremony,

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:53.696 A:middle
John was up here.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:56.546 A:middle
He talked about "Leo's
Fortune" as his example.

00:10:56.776 --> 00:10:58.446 A:middle
I'm going to use a
different example:

00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:03.626 A:middle
Apple Design Award Winner from
2011, and that's "Cut the Rope".


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:03.626 A:middle
Apple Design Award Winner from
2011, and that's "Cut the Rope".

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:06.046 A:middle
So this was an awesome
puzzle game.

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:09.016 A:middle
And it's kind of the
perfect example here to use

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.956 A:middle
as an onboarding case study.

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:15.156 A:middle
So right away what you see here
is they're using coaching tips

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:18.076 A:middle
to explain the goal,
which is to deliver candy

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:19.456 A:middle
to Om Nom, the little character.

00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:22.556 A:middle
And then they start to
tell you about things

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.186 A:middle
like the primary interaction.

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:25.576 A:middle
In "Cut the Rope", you swipe

00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:27.216 A:middle
with your finger
to cut the rope.

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:30.016 A:middle
Now you might be looking at
this kind of going like, well,

00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:30.926 A:middle
that's totally obvious.

00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
But, no, it's only because
you've seen this picture.

00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:38.426 A:middle
And so the, you know what
people would do without this,

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:41.656 A:middle
they would tap the candy,
they would tap Om Nom trying

00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.596 A:middle
to get him to jump
up and eat the candy.

00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:44.576 A:middle
They don't know what to do.

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.836 A:middle
And those aren't the
right interactions, right?

00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:49.646 A:middle
The correct one is to
swipe, cut the rope.

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:53.526 A:middle
So then once the
player has that down,

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:56.446 A:middle
then they start introducing new
interactions one at that time.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.866 A:middle
So each time there's
another coaching tip.

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:03.126 A:middle
So here you cut the rope,
the candy flows down,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:03.126 A:middle
So here you cut the rope,
the candy flows down,

00:12:03.126 --> 00:12:04.156 A:middle
it goes into the bubble,

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.216 A:middle
and then the bubble will
start to lift it up.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.946 A:middle
And then there's another tip
put right in context once

00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:12.726 A:middle
that happens telling the
player to pop the bubble

00:12:12.726 --> 00:12:15.456 A:middle
with their finger and
that will release it

00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:17.626 A:middle
and it will come down to Om Nom.

00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:23.426 A:middle
Okay. And then more really
sort of subtle thing is

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:27.906 A:middle
that a big part of the
gameplay in Cut the Rope comes

00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:30.456 A:middle
from trying to get the candy

00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:35.566 A:middle
to touch all the stars before
it gets down to Om Nom and kind

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:36.926 A:middle
of routing around that way.

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:40.166 A:middle
And to be successful at that
usually takes some trial

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.526 A:middle
and error on every level

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:42.906 A:middle
when you're actually
playing the game.

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:46.946 A:middle
So it's actually really
important to the Core Loop

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:52.196 A:middle
of this game to show players
how they can try again, right.

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:55.976 A:middle
So in their onboarding, they
call that out specifically.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.996 A:middle
And you would think oh,
that's just, you know,

00:12:57.996 --> 00:12:59.856 A:middle
okay fine they're showing
me around the buttons.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:03.306 A:middle
But, no, if they had left
that to the player to discover

00:13:03.306 --> 00:13:05.756 A:middle
on their own, some people
might not have played

00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:08.666 A:middle
around with all the buttons and
the menus to go and play again.

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.896 A:middle
But really this is
core to the gameplay

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:13.956 A:middle
so that's why they show it.

00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:15.636 A:middle
But, okay, so to summarize now:

00:13:16.236 --> 00:13:19.876 A:middle
So start by bringing the
player right into the game

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:21.546 A:middle
and show them how
to get started.

00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:25.386 A:middle
And then introduce more complex
interactions one at that time.

00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:28.806 A:middle
Provide tips and
context as you go along

00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:32.726 A:middle
and then help them discover the
things that will be important

00:13:32.726 --> 00:13:34.636 A:middle
in the game as they
play through it.

00:13:35.046 --> 00:13:36.926 A:middle
So that's number two:
be a good teacher.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:41.166 A:middle
Now, I want to mention, also,
we're having a related session.

00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.506 A:middle
It's going to be on
Thursday, very aptly named,

00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:46.866 A:middle
"Making a Great First Impression
with Strong Onboarding Design".

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:49.456 A:middle
We'll spend a whole hour
going through some examples

00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.956 A:middle
that really get this right.

00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:52.606 A:middle
So be sure to catch
that on Thursday.

00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:57.816 A:middle
All right, now I want to turn
focus to the gameplay itself.

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:02.116 A:middle
So number three is to really
tune and perfect your Core Loop.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:02.116 A:middle
So number three is to really
tune and perfect your Core Loop.

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
You know, I talk to
people all the time.

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:06.996 A:middle
And people will ask me to
take a look at their game,

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:09.206 A:middle
give them some feedback, you
know stuff under development.

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:12.486 A:middle
And a lot of times what I'm
looking at is something,

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:15.716 A:middle
you know, they're saying, I just
it doesn't really feel fun yet.

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:19.446 A:middle
And what that really comes
down to is the Core Loop.

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:23.126 A:middle
So Core Loop is the
term that wraps up how

00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:25.786 A:middle
to describe the game mechanic
in terms of, you know,

00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:27.836 A:middle
the actions the player
takes in the game;

00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:30.916 A:middle
the reward that they
receive, you know,

00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:35.816 A:middle
as they're pursuing a goal;
and the resulting expansion

00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:40.086 A:middle
of the game or the growth of the
character that motivated them

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:41.236 A:middle
to pursue that reward.

00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:44.396 A:middle
And just in games that
aren't quite right,

00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:46.996 A:middle
what I often find is that
there's some disconnect

00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:51.026 A:middle
in this cycle or some
mismatch between the parts

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:52.796 A:middle
so they don't really
line up well.

00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:55.386 A:middle
But, so let me just
illustrate this

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:58.576 A:middle
by showing you some typical
examples from different genres,

00:14:58.576 --> 00:14:59.746 A:middle
just to set the stage.

00:14:59.746 --> 00:15:02.326 A:middle
So, you know, here is a
fantasy role playing game.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.746 --> 00:15:02.326 A:middle
So, you know, here is a
fantasy role playing game.

00:15:02.646 --> 00:15:05.046 A:middle
I explore the dungeon.

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.746 A:middle
I fight enemies.

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:09.676 A:middle
Defeating the enemies gets
me treasure and experience.

00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:12.706 A:middle
And then I use that
treasure and experience

00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:15.306 A:middle
to level up and to buy things.

00:15:15.306 --> 00:15:17.236 A:middle
And then that lets
me go and fight more

00:15:17.236 --> 00:15:18.786 A:middle
and more powerful enemies, okay?

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:19.336 A:middle
Very clear.

00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:23.296 A:middle
Or a platformer, you know, the
basic idea in a platformer is

00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:25.616 A:middle
to run and jump, okay,
that's the player action.

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:28.616 A:middle
But their goal is really to
complete the level itself

00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:31.086 A:middle
and avoid all the
obstacles and the bad guys

00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:33.336 A:middle
and collect the stars
or power ups

00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:35.166 A:middle
or whatever is happening
on that level.

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.616 A:middle
But then if you're
successful the expansion is

00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:42.106 A:middle
to unlock the next stage,
literally expand the universe,

00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:44.216 A:middle
the game universe,
for that game.

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:47.796 A:middle
And where then you then go
and find new things to run

00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:50.786 A:middle
and jump over, new
obstacles, and so on.

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:51.186 A:middle
But, okay.

00:15:51.186 --> 00:15:54.006 A:middle
So now to get a little
deeper, you know,

00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:56.686 A:middle
it's really worth
noting that some

00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.816 A:middle
of the most compelling
games are the ones

00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:01.066 A:middle
with more than one Core Loop.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:01.066 A:middle
with more than one Core Loop.

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:03.136 A:middle
And I'm showing these
side by side.

00:16:03.236 --> 00:16:05.516 A:middle
But really they're
meant to be overlapping.

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.546 A:middle
So you're fighting monsters,

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:09.146 A:middle
you gain experience,
you're leveling up.

00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:12.126 A:middle
But, at the same time,
you're collecting clues.

00:16:12.126 --> 00:16:14.356 A:middle
You're using the clues
to solve a puzzle.

00:16:14.646 --> 00:16:16.676 A:middle
The puzzle lets you
unlock a door.

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:19.686 A:middle
Behind the door there's more
monsters and more clues.

00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:23.276 A:middle
And these are overlaid in the
experience on top of each other.

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:25.186 A:middle
But, okay.

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:28.996 A:middle
So let me give you some
more concrete advice here.

00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:31.356 A:middle
So, you know, what
really is the bottom line?

00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:36.176 A:middle
So the best games, first,
are the ones that really,

00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:40.576 A:middle
clearly understand their
target audience and are able

00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:43.416 A:middle
to put center excuse
me, put the centerpoint

00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:46.686 A:middle
of the Core Loop right
on top of that audience.

00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:51.186 A:middle
And it's important that the Core
Loop be easy to express and kind

00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:52.326 A:middle
of easy to understand.

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.196 A:middle
That's kind of, when
I find games

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:57.956 A:middle
that are have these little
mismatches, usually it's a case

00:16:57.956 --> 00:16:59.756 A:middle
where it's difficult
for the developer

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.906 A:middle
to actually express the
Core Loop, these components,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.906 A:middle
to actually express the
Core Loop, these components,

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:06.175 A:middle
clearly in terms of the action,
the reward, the expansion.

00:17:07.455 --> 00:17:09.806 A:middle
Now, as I have been
saying, make sure each phase

00:17:09.806 --> 00:17:12.746 A:middle
of this feeds right
into the next.

00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:15.016 A:middle
And, sort of, all of the
energy that the player gives

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:17.726 A:middle
into one part of it flows
around and, kind of,

00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:19.266 A:middle
reinforces the other parts.

00:17:20.566 --> 00:17:23.286 A:middle
Make each iteration meaningful.

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.336 A:middle
And I'll talk about this
a little more as I talk

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.286 A:middle
about progression in the game.

00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:30.866 A:middle
But then also question
your assumptions.

00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:33.696 A:middle
And this is probably the best
advice for any developer is

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:37.346 A:middle
to go back and really
rethink it and keep iterating

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.696 A:middle
until you know you've
done it well.

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:42.406 A:middle
And, you know, how do you know?

00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:43.546 A:middle
How do you really know?

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:47.396 A:middle
I could say playtest, but
that's just a punt, right.

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:51.256 A:middle
It's like, how do you really
know that you did it well?

00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:56.026 A:middle
Well, you know it by really
thinking it through yourself.

00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:59.336 A:middle
You know, if you find the
clues, will you be able

00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:02.666 A:middle
to solve the puzzle without
some giant leap of faith


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:02.666 A:middle
to solve the puzzle without
some giant leap of faith

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:06.276 A:middle
or going online to Google how
to figure out this puzzle.

00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:10.676 A:middle
Well, you know, if you unlock
something, if you solve

00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:13.386 A:middle
that puzzle, is it going
to unlock the next stage?

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:16.576 A:middle
If you unlock that next stage,
will I have something new

00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:18.926 A:middle
or novel to really look
at once I get there?

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:20.956 A:middle
Okay. So test it.

00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
But, at the same time,
don't feel boxed in.

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.326 A:middle
I am not saying that
every game needs

00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:31.576 A:middle
to follow the same design
methodology or, you know,

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:34.226 A:middle
kind of deal with its
audience in the same way.

00:18:34.576 --> 00:18:36.906 A:middle
A lot of the really
best expressions

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:40.706 A:middle
of great games are the ones that
aren't afraid to mix this up.

00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:45.166 A:middle
But, so, now, let me show
you just a quick example,

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:47.786 A:middle
a game that's really
fantastic in the way

00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:50.376 A:middle
that it does its Core Loop is
the Apple Design Award winner

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:53.046 A:middle
last year, this is "Ridiculous
Fishing" by Vlambeer.

00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.806 A:middle
So it really has, I
think you could break it

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.976 A:middle
down into three distinct
mechanics.

00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:03.216 A:middle
The first one is when you
are dropping your line


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:03.216 A:middle
The first one is when you
are dropping your line

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:03.926 A:middle
into the water.

00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:06.566 A:middle
You're just trying to, you're
using the accelerometer

00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:08.456 A:middle
or the gyroscope and
trying to get the line

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:10.896 A:middle
down through the water
avoiding the fish,

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.326 A:middle
get it as deep as you can.

00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:16.576 A:middle
Okay. Then once you run out
of line or once you hit a fish

00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:19.186 A:middle
on the way down,
everything reverses.

00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:21.976 A:middle
And now you're going
back up and reeling

00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:23.766 A:middle
in as many fish as you can.

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:27.846 A:middle
We're back on the gyro again
and just trying now to collect

00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:29.576 A:middle
as many of the fish
and try to run

00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.776 A:middle
into them while avoiding
the jellyfish

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.156 A:middle
and other baddies
that are there.

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:37.716 A:middle
And then the third loop, when
we get up to the surface,

00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:42.146 A:middle
of course, we fling the fish up
into the air and then you tap

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.836 A:middle
on them to shoot them
out of the sky, right,

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:46.756 A:middle
so and collect points.

00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:50.936 A:middle
And so, and then those
points are what we use

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.066 A:middle
as the expansion in the game.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:56.856 A:middle
It lets us get a better lure,
a longer line, and so on.

00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:59.356 A:middle
And so the game is really,
you know, hilarious.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:00.966 A:middle
And if you didn't
see it last year

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:03.646 A:middle
from the design awards,
check it out.

00:20:03.916 --> 00:20:05.876 A:middle
But so that's tuning
your Core Loop.

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.876 A:middle
Now, let me expand
out from there.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:13.726 A:middle
And so for the next few parts
of the talk, I want to go

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:17.766 A:middle
through some aspects of this
next ring around the Core Loop

00:20:18.036 --> 00:20:20.736 A:middle
and I want to start with
the interaction mechanic.

00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:22.756 A:middle
Because obviously, you know,
how the player interacts

00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:25.296 A:middle
with your game is completely
fundamental to the success

00:20:25.806 --> 00:20:27.346 A:middle
of the Core Loop,
to it feeling fun.

00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:30.906 A:middle
And if your players seem
to be having trouble

00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:33.286 A:middle
with the controls,
this is where to start.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.506 A:middle
And it's to design for touch.

00:20:37.296 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
So sometimes when I'm working

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:41.246 A:middle
with someone who's
bringing a game over to iOS

00:20:41.446 --> 00:20:45.026 A:middle
from another platform like a
PC or a console or whatever,

00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:49.006 A:middle
their first instinct is actually
to just bring their Core Loop

00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:52.606 A:middle
over completely unchanged,
you know, including all

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:54.996 A:middle
of their old interaction
mechanic, right.

00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:58.166 A:middle
And so, you know, if their game
was based on pressing buttons

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.016 A:middle
than they just overlay
the screen,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.016 A:middle
than they just overlay
the screen,

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:01.176 A:middle
superimpose some buttons.

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.006 A:middle
Or if they used to use a
D pad, then, okay, great,

00:21:05.006 --> 00:21:07.226 A:middle
then they'll put a virtual
D pad on the screen.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.046 A:middle
But the truth is that this is
usually not really optimal.

00:21:11.316 --> 00:21:13.076 A:middle
These overlays get in the way

00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:15.476 A:middle
of the player seeing
the game field.

00:21:16.226 --> 00:21:18.906 A:middle
And, but more profoundly,
they're indirect.

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:20.986 A:middle
They're controls
that are controlling

00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:23.566 A:middle
that little paddle that's
going to go underneath.

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:26.316 A:middle
And, you know, it's a
bouncy ball game, right?

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:31.566 A:middle
And so since they're indirect,
it relies on the player

00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:33.576 A:middle
to really be able
to be in control

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:35.096 A:middle
of the controls themselves.

00:21:35.476 --> 00:21:38.506 A:middle
But they can't feel when their
finger is in the right spot.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
And so they kind of have to look
at their finger a lot in order

00:21:42.016 --> 00:21:43.976 A:middle
to be confident in
their actions.

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:48.146 A:middle
Okay. Now, if you step back
a moment and really think

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:51.036 A:middle
about where all this is
coming from, you know,

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:54.296 A:middle
if the game was designed with a
different interaction mechanic

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:57.336 A:middle
in mind, then a lot
of the assumptions

00:21:57.336 --> 00:22:00.336 A:middle
of that other mechanic just
get built into the game.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.336 --> 00:22:00.336 A:middle
of that other mechanic just
get built into the game.

00:22:00.336 --> 00:22:03.806 A:middle
They become kind of implicit and
ultimately kind of forgotten.

00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:09.716 A:middle
And when that happens, the
answer isn't just to, kind of,

00:22:09.716 --> 00:22:11.586 A:middle
remap some controls

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:14.036 A:middle
onto a virtual joystick
or virtual buttons.

00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:18.686 A:middle
You really need to go back
and rethink those assumptions.

00:22:18.926 --> 00:22:22.276 A:middle
And, you know, go back
and redesign for touch.

00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:25.746 A:middle
And if you're not sure what I
really, really mean by this,

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.796 A:middle
then let's just go
back and look at some

00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:30.546 A:middle
of the Design Award winners
over the past couple of years.

00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:34.866 A:middle
"Monument Valley": tap the
path, and that directs Ida

00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:36.006 A:middle
around to walk around.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.536 A:middle
She's the main character.

00:22:37.536 --> 00:22:40.766 A:middle
And then you or you do
these little twist gestures

00:22:40.866 --> 00:22:44.046 A:middle
and that'll turn the cranks
and move the walkways.

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.126 A:middle
So it's based on
taps and gestures.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.696 A:middle
"Blek": You make a
shake with your finger.

00:22:50.906 --> 00:22:54.046 A:middle
And that's the pattern that the
stroke that's generated is going

00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:56.726 A:middle
to follow and you try
and get that to repeat.

00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:58.746 A:middle
And try to hit the dots.

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:00.416 A:middle
By the way, I'm going
to hang this picture


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:00.416 A:middle
By the way, I'm going
to hang this picture

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:01.966 A:middle
in John's office
when we get back.

00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:06.706 A:middle
So but it's about
stroking a path.

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:10.986 A:middle
"Threes". So in "Threes", you
push the tiles against the walls

00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:14.146 A:middle
to make, you know, matching
numbers join together.

00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:15.456 A:middle
It's very, kind of, physical.

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:16.806 A:middle
You're pushing the tiles.

00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:18.996 A:middle
They're coming, they're
squeezing together

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:20.046 A:middle
against the walls, and so on.

00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:23.836 A:middle
But it's all based on
short strokes and swipes.

00:23:25.396 --> 00:23:26.296 A:middle
Infinity Blade.

00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:29.396 A:middle
You swipe the screen to control
how your character's going

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:30.706 A:middle
to swing its sword.

00:23:30.986 --> 00:23:35.606 A:middle
Then there's some buttons you
press to dodge, and raise,

00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:37.476 A:middle
you know, you put
on your shield.

00:23:37.886 --> 00:23:41.786 A:middle
And there's some gestures
you use to cast a spell.

00:23:42.316 --> 00:23:45.926 A:middle
But so it's taps,
swipes, and gestures.

00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:48.606 A:middle
"Cut the Rope": We
just showed you.

00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:51.206 A:middle
You swipe to cut the rope,
and then you tap things

00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:55.476 A:middle
like balloons and you tap on the
bubbles and so on to blow air

00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:56.596 A:middle
around or pop the bubbles.

00:23:56.596 --> 00:23:58.326 A:middle
So it's taps and swipes.

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:01.846 A:middle
"Where's My Water": You
guys are getting this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:01.846 A:middle
"Where's My Water": You
guys are getting this.

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:06.666 A:middle
You know, you take your finger,
you drag a path through the dirt

00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:08.686 A:middle
and that's where the
water is going to flow.

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:12.186 A:middle
So you feel your finger
touching the glass.

00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:17.366 A:middle
You instantly get audio feedback
when you touch the screen.

00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:20.656 A:middle
You feel the friction
as you draw that path,

00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:22.236 A:middle
move your finger around.

00:24:22.476 --> 00:24:25.346 A:middle
And you instantly see
the path you drew.

00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:28.106 A:middle
So it's a game that
gets everything right.

00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:29.286 A:middle
Everything is in sync.

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:33.356 A:middle
So let's take all this and
sort of distill it down

00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:34.916 A:middle
and summarize what
I mean by this.

00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:38.316 A:middle
So the key to what
all those games,

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:43.036 A:middle
and others that are all doing,
is to design their controls

00:24:43.276 --> 00:24:45.986 A:middle
around direct interactions
reinforced

00:24:46.206 --> 00:24:48.206 A:middle
by instantaneous feedback.

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:51.446 A:middle
So direct manipulation
is the key

00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.606 A:middle
to that interaction
model on iOS.

00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:55.436 A:middle
You've got to embrace the idea

00:24:55.436 --> 00:24:59.606 A:middle
that the best iOS games are
the ones where you reach

00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:04.576 A:middle
through the glass and touch the
game elements themselves, right.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:04.576 A:middle
through the glass and touch the
game elements themselves, right.

00:25:04.886 --> 00:25:08.236 A:middle
So it's based on touches and
taps and gestures and swipes

00:25:08.676 --> 00:25:10.236 A:middle
and panning and drawing paths

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:15.326 A:middle
where those interactions are the
ones that define the gameplay.

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:21.676 A:middle
And then it's critical that you
provide instantaneous feedback.

00:25:22.156 --> 00:25:26.116 A:middle
So these are the visual cues and
audio cues so that what you see

00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:31.456 A:middle
and what you hear and what you
feel all reinforce what you did.

00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:33.466 A:middle
And they reinforce each other.

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
But, okay.

00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:39.636 A:middle
So, with all that passion,
that was designed for touch.

00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:43.956 A:middle
But if people seem to be
having a lot of trouble

00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:47.116 A:middle
with your controls, go
back to those principles

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:50.516 A:middle
and really redesign your
Core Loop around the idea

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:53.246 A:middle
of direct interactions
that are reinforced

00:25:53.466 --> 00:25:55.016 A:middle
by instantaneous feedback.

00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:58.996 A:middle
Okay, next is to
foster engagement.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.956 A:middle
So, you know, this about
keeping the player coming back

00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:03.876 A:middle
to your game.

00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:06.646 A:middle
And we use a lot of different
terms to describe this,

00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:08.946 A:middle
you know, it's a
huge, a huge area.

00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:12.236 A:middle
But all this is done because,
just hopefully, you know,

00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:15.836 A:middle
having a really deeply engaged
player is going to generate word

00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:19.326 A:middle
of mouth and viral discovery,
more business for you,

00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:21.126 A:middle
more of a fan base, and so on.

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.736 A:middle
And there are a ton of
things to talk about here.

00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:28.316 A:middle
But, you know, and I'll get
to some specifics in a minute.

00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:31.716 A:middle
But I want to first say
something else that's a little

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.576 A:middle
deeper about this.

00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:37.896 A:middle
So it's really easy for
any of us to, kind of,

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:41.286 A:middle
get wrapped up in the
details of the Core Loop

00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:42.816 A:middle
and the onboarding and so on.

00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:49.466 A:middle
But it's important for you to be
able to rise above those details

00:26:49.926 --> 00:26:53.816 A:middle
of the game and really see the
game from the player perspective

00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:58.186 A:middle
and understand that the
design process here is

00:26:58.186 --> 00:27:00.266 A:middle
profoundly fractal.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.186 --> 00:27:00.266 A:middle
profoundly fractal.

00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:05.426 A:middle
The same patterns emerge
at every level of detail.

00:27:05.706 --> 00:27:08.006 A:middle
And there are resonances
among them.

00:27:08.946 --> 00:27:12.096 A:middle
So even if you get the
game loop completely right,

00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:16.066 A:middle
if you can't rise above
that, it won't resonate

00:27:16.066 --> 00:27:17.846 A:middle
with your meta game
or your progression.

00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:22.236 A:middle
If you get the progression right
but you can't rise above that,

00:27:22.816 --> 00:27:25.986 A:middle
it won't resonate with the
storyline, and so on and so on.

00:27:27.496 --> 00:27:27.886 A:middle
But, okay.

00:27:28.026 --> 00:27:31.516 A:middle
So now taking this down a notch,
back to Earth just a moment.

00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:35.666 A:middle
Do you remember how a couple
of moments ago I said that,

00:27:35.666 --> 00:27:38.146 A:middle
you know, a lot of really
interesting games overlay

00:27:38.146 --> 00:27:39.436 A:middle
multiple Core Loops?

00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:42.816 A:middle
Well, that holds true for
the progression as well.

00:27:42.816 --> 00:27:45.036 A:middle
And so one way that
you can really get,

00:27:45.036 --> 00:27:48.826 A:middle
hold the player's interest is
to provide layers of progression

00:27:48.826 --> 00:27:52.386 A:middle
or overlays of it, of
progression and expansion

00:27:52.386 --> 00:27:55.496 A:middle
with multiple goals, multiple
paths of goals, I mean,

00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:57.576 A:middle
multiple paths of challenges,

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:01.936 A:middle
and different paths
giving different balance


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:01.936 A:middle
and different paths
giving different balance

00:28:01.936 --> 00:28:03.836 A:middle
between risk and reward.

00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:07.106 A:middle
That's something that players
will find very, very compelling.

00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:11.556 A:middle
And you can even gamify
the expansions themselves.

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.996 A:middle
So this is, you know, kind
of the essence of a lot

00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:17.996 A:middle
of crafting games is that you
make the expansions themselves

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:21.466 A:middle
into choices that the players
have to make that are strategic

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:23.236 A:middle
to the future of their gameplay.

00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:26.356 A:middle
And then you ensure
that you take them

00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:30.086 A:middle
down different paths
depending on what they've done.

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:31.666 A:middle
But, okay.

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:35.136 A:middle
This next one now, so this
is particularly important

00:28:35.136 --> 00:28:37.186 A:middle
for anyone who's making
free to play games.

00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:40.326 A:middle
And that's to provide
value for everyone,

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:43.966 A:middle
both your paying players
and your non-paying players.

00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:48.176 A:middle
So work through the
entire experience for both

00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:51.066 A:middle
of those audiences
to ensure that those

00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:56.006 A:middle
who are playing your game for
free can progress, can expand,

00:28:56.456 --> 00:28:58.656 A:middle
and, sure, they can
see the benefit.

00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:01.496 A:middle
Show them the benefit of
becoming a paying player.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:01.496 A:middle
Show them the benefit of
becoming a paying player.

00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:05.436 A:middle
But if you try to force them,
then you'll lose engagement

00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:07.126 A:middle
with a fair number of them.

00:29:07.986 --> 00:29:11.516 A:middle
And on the other side, ensure
that those who are paying

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.506 A:middle
in your game will feel

00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:16.006 A:middle
that they're getting
properly rewarded in the game

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.296 A:middle
and getting something for the
money that they're spending.

00:29:19.676 --> 00:29:23.286 A:middle
Then next, again, this is
holding the player's interest.

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:27.876 A:middle
So really do what you can
to incentivize repeat play.

00:29:28.446 --> 00:29:32.886 A:middle
So enable and motivate the
player to try one more time.

00:29:33.386 --> 00:29:36.276 A:middle
Enable and motivate the
player to see what's next.

00:29:36.736 --> 00:29:40.416 A:middle
Enable and motivate to
see how it ends, right.

00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.566 A:middle
And if you think about
where these fit in,

00:29:43.516 --> 00:29:45.606 A:middle
"one more try" is
about the Core Loop.

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:48.926 A:middle
"See what's next" is
about the progression.

00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:53.106 A:middle
"See how it ends" is about
the storyline, right.

00:29:54.746 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
Okay. Now, let me talk a
bit about re engagement.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:02.356 A:middle
So providing really,
you know, coming out

00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:05.146 A:middle
and providing really
fresh new content

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.926 A:middle
after you've launched
is a great way

00:30:07.926 --> 00:30:10.376 A:middle
to keep your momentum
going and, in many cases,

00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
even to help drive new growth.

00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:16.846 A:middle
So really think about how
you will continue your story

00:30:17.126 --> 00:30:20.506 A:middle
to provide new content or
new levels or new goals

00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:21.826 A:middle
or challenges, and so on.

00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:25.146 A:middle
Or seasonal content
around holidays.

00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:27.846 A:middle
Or regional content
in different locales.

00:30:28.476 --> 00:30:31.686 A:middle
It's all to give your players
another positive reason

00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:33.336 A:middle
to come back into the game.

00:30:33.926 --> 00:30:38.156 A:middle
And it's important that you
plan this out before you launch.

00:30:39.086 --> 00:30:43.496 A:middle
Because the people who have had
catastrophic success are the

00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:45.566 A:middle
ones who a game takes off

00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:47.606 A:middle
and then they realize
people are done.

00:30:48.376 --> 00:30:51.116 A:middle
And they need to scramble
to get more content out.

00:30:51.466 --> 00:30:53.476 A:middle
You're most engaged
players are going

00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:58.216 A:middle
to consume your content very
quickly; so have it ready.

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:01.076 A:middle
Have it ready to go
so that your really,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:01.076 A:middle
Have it ready to go
so that your really,

00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:03.516 A:middle
deeply engaged players can
have something that's going

00:31:03.516 --> 00:31:05.006 A:middle
to bring them back
into the game.

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:09.316 A:middle
And you'll attract new
players to come in as well.

00:31:09.526 --> 00:31:12.256 A:middle
Now, it's also important
to really measure

00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:15.016 A:middle
and understand how well
you're retaining your players.

00:31:15.456 --> 00:31:17.216 A:middle
And starting later this fall,

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:21.116 A:middle
we'll be providing
retention information to you

00:31:21.366 --> 00:31:22.536 A:middle
through iTunes Connect.

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:25.736 A:middle
So this is going to show you
how many players have downloaded

00:31:25.736 --> 00:31:30.356 A:middle
your game by day, by region,
by platform, by source

00:31:30.996 --> 00:31:34.576 A:middle
and what percentage of them
kept playing in the days

00:31:34.576 --> 00:31:36.816 A:middle
that followed their download.

00:31:37.486 --> 00:31:39.936 A:middle
And so this is just
a taste, okay.

00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:42.116 A:middle
So we'll show you a
lot more about this

00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:45.356 A:middle
in the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow morning.

00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:49.736 A:middle
But so that's number five:
to foster engagement.

00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:53.816 A:middle
So now, let me turn the
focus the other way and get

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:56.046 A:middle
into a couple of things
on the technical side.

00:31:56.576 --> 00:31:59.866 A:middle
And so this is number six:
to use background transfers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:01.216 A:middle
Huh? Okay.

00:32:01.216 --> 00:32:04.176 A:middle
So you remember back
in the first section

00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:05.596 A:middle
where I was talking
about friction,

00:32:05.596 --> 00:32:07.476 A:middle
I talked about downloading
updates,

00:32:07.786 --> 00:32:10.076 A:middle
and I said that that was
something that we could move

00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:11.236 A:middle
out of the player's way?

00:32:11.236 --> 00:32:14.856 A:middle
That's what this is about and
that's what I'll get into here.

00:32:15.096 --> 00:32:18.436 A:middle
So in "Paddle Mania
3000", we have, you know,

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.526 A:middle
thousands of image
assets because we have

00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:21.876 A:middle
so many levels, right.

00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:25.026 A:middle
We have-and for all of
those different assets,

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:28.936 A:middle
we have one for Retina,
non Retina, iPhone 5s,

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:30.596 A:middle
the iPad, iPad Air, right.

00:32:30.596 --> 00:32:32.606 A:middle
And then we have
all of our sounds,

00:32:32.606 --> 00:32:34.976 A:middle
AAC and MP3 for our soundtrack.

00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:39.236 A:middle
We've got Linear PCM for
audio effects with OpenAL.

00:32:39.676 --> 00:32:42.806 A:middle
We've got 13 different
localizations, right.

00:32:42.806 --> 00:32:46.296 A:middle
So English, French, you
know, EFIGS, Japanese,

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.866 A:middle
Traditional Chinese,
Simplified Chinese, Brazilian,

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:50.226 A:middle
Portuguese, and a few more.

00:32:50.766 --> 00:32:53.536 A:middle
And then we have a binary
compiled three different,

00:32:53.536 --> 00:32:57.326 A:middle
you know, three ways:
armv7, armv7s, arm64.

00:32:57.326 --> 00:33:01.386 A:middle
Okay. So there's a lot of
stuff in "Paddle Mania 3000".


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.326 --> 00:33:01.386 A:middle
Okay. So there's a lot of
stuff in "Paddle Mania 3000".

00:33:01.976 --> 00:33:05.266 A:middle
And you know putting all
that together is putting us

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:08.806 A:middle
over the limit for
downloading over cellular.

00:33:09.246 --> 00:33:10.806 A:middle
So what do you do?

00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:15.556 A:middle
Well, you know, a lot of times,
a discussion will begin, and,

00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:17.786 A:middle
you know, quite often there
will be somebody who will chime

00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:22.006 A:middle
in with advice like this:
"One size fits all!"

00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:23.926 A:middle
Just ship one size.

00:33:23.926 --> 00:33:24.746 A:middle
Stretch it.

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.236 A:middle
Stretch it to fit
on all platforms,

00:33:27.576 --> 00:33:29.616 A:middle
or just ship one localization.

00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.316 A:middle
They all speak English, right?

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:33.626 A:middle
No, they really don't.

00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:37.306 A:middle
So don't sacrifice quality.

00:33:37.526 --> 00:33:40.656 A:middle
And don't shortchange
your global audience.

00:33:41.196 --> 00:33:44.976 A:middle
Realize that what you could
probably get your game

00:33:44.976 --> 00:33:48.596 A:middle
under 100 megabytes if you use
background transfers, you know,

00:33:48.596 --> 00:33:51.686 A:middle
and let the user download
the main bundle of it now

00:33:51.686 --> 00:33:54.026 A:middle
but have more content
that gets transferred

00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:56.056 A:middle
down after they've
run it the first time.

00:33:57.126 --> 00:33:59.406 A:middle
So there's a couple of
things to do this now.

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.336 A:middle
So the first step really is
to take a good solid look


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.336 A:middle
So the first step really is
to take a good solid look

00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:05.696 A:middle
at your game and the
game design and determine

00:34:05.696 --> 00:34:07.016 A:middle
if there is some content

00:34:07.016 --> 00:34:09.485 A:middle
that isn't really
needed right up front.

00:34:10.206 --> 00:34:12.545 A:middle
And games, especially
games with any kind

00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:16.485 A:middle
of a linear progression are
perfect for this, right.

00:34:16.795 --> 00:34:19.275 A:middle
You put the first couple of
hours or whatever, you know,

00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:23.226 A:middle
the first 20, 30 levels in
the bundle at full quality.

00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:26.696 A:middle
And then that's going to
provide enough time for the user

00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:29.666 A:middle
to be playing, and then you
use background transfers

00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:32.576 A:middle
to download the rest while
their playing those first 20.

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:34.946 A:middle
So how's this done?

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:38.966 A:middle
Okay. So NSURLSession is an
API that we introduced back

00:34:38.966 --> 00:34:42.596 A:middle
in iOS 7, and the
use is to upload

00:34:42.596 --> 00:34:44.956 A:middle
and download data
from your own server.

00:34:45.286 --> 00:34:47.676 A:middle
And this is intended
for large data sets.

00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:52.176 A:middle
So game levels, big images,
sound files, texture atlases,

00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:53.565 A:middle
all that kind of thing, right.

00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:58.046 A:middle
Now, the transfer, itself,
happens outside of your process.

00:34:58.046 --> 00:34:58.996 A:middle
You just set it off.

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
You'll get notified
when it's completed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
You'll get notified
when it's completed.

00:35:01.396 --> 00:35:04.116 A:middle
The player can continue
or the app can even be,

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:05.946 A:middle
you know, quit or terminated.

00:35:05.946 --> 00:35:07.986 A:middle
And the download is
going to keep on going.

00:35:08.696 --> 00:35:11.276 A:middle
And the app, if it's
running, will be notified,

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.726 A:middle
or it'll be woken up when
the transfer is done.

00:35:15.136 --> 00:35:18.236 A:middle
And it's just enough so that you
can take the content that's been

00:35:18.236 --> 00:35:21.156 A:middle
downloaded and, kind
of, unpack it and put it

00:35:21.156 --> 00:35:22.666 A:middle
into its permanent location.

00:35:23.376 --> 00:35:24.646 A:middle
So it's really useful.

00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:28.456 A:middle
It does obviously, it adds
some complexity, right.

00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:30.926 A:middle
Because you're going to have
to handle some corner cases now

00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:33.736 A:middle
that you didn't have before,
like the player running

00:35:33.736 --> 00:35:37.646 A:middle
out of disk space or, you
know, reaching a level

00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:39.866 A:middle
that you haven't
successfully downloaded yet.

00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:42.346 A:middle
And it's important, also,

00:35:42.346 --> 00:35:44.806 A:middle
that you follow the iOS
Data Storage Guidelines.

00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:46.996 A:middle
So these will tell you exactly

00:35:46.996 --> 00:35:49.986 A:middle
where to put any
downloaded assets.

00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:55.416 A:middle
And also remember, this is about
assets, you know, new textures,

00:35:55.416 --> 00:35:59.166 A:middle
new levels, new sounds, and that
kind of thing, but not code.

00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.256 A:middle
If you're making code
changes, that has to go back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.256 A:middle
If you're making code
changes, that has to go back

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:05.206 A:middle
up through app review
as an update to the app.

00:36:05.776 --> 00:36:09.236 A:middle
But, okay, so that's number six:
to use background transfers.

00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:13.316 A:middle
And, you know, if you're going
to be targeting iOS 7 and above,

00:36:13.316 --> 00:36:16.596 A:middle
like now is the time, right,
because you can move cleanly

00:36:16.596 --> 00:36:22.026 A:middle
up to all of your supported
devices with NSURLSession.

00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:27.176 A:middle
Okay, number seven: optimize
graphics performance.

00:36:28.256 --> 00:36:29.656 A:middle
So, you know, I've
mentioned I meet

00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:30.896 A:middle
with developers all the time.

00:36:30.896 --> 00:36:32.896 A:middle
I probably met with some
of the people in this room.

00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:35.876 A:middle
And, you know, to give people
feedback on their games,

00:36:36.116 --> 00:36:40.806 A:middle
but one of the things that just
very, very honestly that I love

00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:43.446 A:middle
to do is to run their game

00:36:43.446 --> 00:36:47.146 A:middle
through our performance tools
and, kind of, use that to figure

00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:52.596 A:middle
out what optimizations they need
to make in OpenGL and so on.

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:55.176 A:middle
It's kind of what I eat
for breakfast, right.

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:59.546 A:middle
Now, so as I get into this
section, though, the first thing

00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.266 A:middle
to realize and to
say about it is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.266 A:middle
to realize and to
say about it is

00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:07.256 A:middle
that optimizing graphics is
totally what Metal is all about.

00:37:07.256 --> 00:37:09.076 A:middle
But I'll get to Metal
in a second.

00:37:09.556 --> 00:37:12.566 A:middle
I want to talk first just
about optimizing the games

00:37:12.566 --> 00:37:13.686 A:middle
that are already out there.

00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:17.846 A:middle
So, you know, every game
is different, right,

00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:21.466 A:middle
and most of them are actually
pretty well optimized.

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:22.036 A:middle
They're okay.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:26.866 A:middle
But in the games that are having
performance issues with OpenGL,

00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:30.666 A:middle
it's usually because for some
portion of the frame, at least,

00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:33.646 A:middle
or maybe all of the frame,
they're trying to do a lot

00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:36.786 A:middle
of draw calls with a
low number of triangles

00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:38.806 A:middle
to be processed in
each draw call.

00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:45.116 A:middle
And the worst case scenario
is actually fairly common.

00:37:45.116 --> 00:37:46.096 A:middle
I see it sometimes.

00:37:46.096 --> 00:37:49.056 A:middle
It's particularly in
2D and isometric games

00:37:49.056 --> 00:37:50.356 A:middle
that I'll find this sometimes.

00:37:50.716 --> 00:37:52.466 A:middle
Is that they're just,
they're in a loop

00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:55.966 A:middle
where they're binding a texture,
drawing a quad, and then repeat.

00:37:55.966 --> 00:37:57.506 A:middle
Bind; draw; bind;
draw; bind; draw.

00:37:57.506 --> 00:38:01.656 A:middle
And that's how they draw their
entire scene with one draw call


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.506 --> 00:38:01.656 A:middle
And that's how they draw their
entire scene with one draw call

00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:04.786 A:middle
for every quad, one texture
bind for every draw call.

00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:08.376 A:middle
And, you know, for
OpenGL ES, there's just,

00:38:08.426 --> 00:38:12.046 A:middle
there's a fair amount of CPU
overhead that's involved here

00:38:12.046 --> 00:38:15.276 A:middle
in the validation and the
processing draw calls.

00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:19.166 A:middle
So, you know, the theory behind
this becomes very important

00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:20.746 A:middle
to optimize this.

00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:24.356 A:middle
It's super important that
those developers find a way

00:38:24.356 --> 00:38:28.036 A:middle
to amortize that overhead
over more triangles.

00:38:28.886 --> 00:38:33.066 A:middle
Now, this is something that
I can help any of you with,

00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:36.996 A:middle
and we have tons of people
in the lab this week.

00:38:36.996 --> 00:38:40.576 A:middle
So if you're falling into this
situation, we can help you.

00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:44.816 A:middle
But these 15 recommendations
that are up here cover most

00:38:44.816 --> 00:38:46.446 A:middle
of the cases that I run into.

00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:50.616 A:middle
This is the solutions that we
apply depending on the game,

00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:55.016 A:middle
depending on the structure, and
what they're doing in OpenGL.

00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:59.286 A:middle
But, and I'm not going to
go deep into any of these.

00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:03.426 A:middle
But, so, more broadly,
what you need to realize is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:03.426 A:middle
But, so, more broadly,
what you need to realize is

00:39:03.426 --> 00:39:07.436 A:middle
that optimizing graphics
performance is really

00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:12.426 A:middle
and primarily about identifying
the bottlenecks that you have

00:39:12.426 --> 00:39:15.786 A:middle
and then addressing them, taking
some action to address them.

00:39:16.796 --> 00:39:19.496 A:middle
Okay, so that lets me
talk about the tools.

00:39:19.496 --> 00:39:21.706 A:middle
You know, we have
these fantastic tools

00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:25.126 A:middle
that will help you
identify exactly

00:39:25.126 --> 00:39:27.076 A:middle
where your performance
bottlenecks are

00:39:27.076 --> 00:39:28.966 A:middle
and different bottlenecks
that might be happening.

00:39:29.576 --> 00:39:33.306 A:middle
So this is a screenshot from the
GPU performance graphs in Xcode.

00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:38.026 A:middle
And this, along with the
GPU frame debugger in Xcode

00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:40.636 A:middle
and the OpenGL ES
analyzer instrument,

00:39:41.006 --> 00:39:42.436 A:middle
are kind of the tools
of the trade

00:39:42.436 --> 00:39:44.366 A:middle
that you should familiarize
yourself with here.

00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.156 A:middle
So now let me zoom in.

00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:50.386 A:middle
So what you see here: Section
at the top you see this sort

00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:53.506 A:middle
of speedometer on the left up
at the top, the purple bars

00:39:53.506 --> 00:39:55.826 A:middle
with utilization in the
middle that's showing me my

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.256 A:middle
GPU utilization.

00:39:57.256 --> 00:39:59.796 A:middle
And then over here on the
right, the frame time,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:03.176 A:middle
or how much time the CPU
is working on this frame,

00:40:03.176 --> 00:40:05.306 A:middle
and how much time the GPU
is working on this frame.

00:40:06.186 --> 00:40:09.406 A:middle
Now, in this particular
screenshot,

00:40:09.836 --> 00:40:12.266 A:middle
this is a little different
than what I was just talking

00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.786 A:middle
about with bind, draw,
bind, draw, bind, draw.

00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:18.376 A:middle
In this one, what it is, I can
see the renderer utilization is

00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:21.626 A:middle
at 100 percent and that's
pushing the device utilization

00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:22.636 A:middle
up to 100 percent.

00:40:23.096 --> 00:40:25.246 A:middle
And that is typically
a sign actually

00:40:25.246 --> 00:40:26.996 A:middle
of a very expensive
fragment shader.

00:40:27.436 --> 00:40:30.736 A:middle
Okay. And so down in the
bottom here, you can see,

00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:36.526 A:middle
a view here now where I can-it's
showing me the cost of every one

00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:38.656 A:middle
of my shaders that was
used in this frame.

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.266 A:middle
And I can turn down
these disclosures

00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:44.736 A:middle
and see the specific draw
calls that use that shader

00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:46.836 A:middle
and how much each one
of them cost as well.

00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:50.946 A:middle
And, then, I can
also go and drill

00:40:50.946 --> 00:40:52.656 A:middle
down into a particular shader.

00:40:52.656 --> 00:40:54.366 A:middle
I'm not going to walk
you through all the UI.

00:40:54.366 --> 00:40:57.426 A:middle
But once you get to the
view where you're looking

00:40:57.426 --> 00:41:00.426 A:middle
that your shaders, if
I zoom that in again.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.426 --> 00:41:00.426 A:middle
that your shaders, if
I zoom that in again.

00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:05.066 A:middle
Okay. So what this
is showing me now,

00:41:05.066 --> 00:41:07.856 A:middle
look at on the right hand
side, these little bars.

00:41:08.616 --> 00:41:11.086 A:middle
This is taken live
from the device.

00:41:11.086 --> 00:41:13.056 A:middle
It's able to see the
performance data.

00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:16.046 A:middle
And it's going line by
line through the shader

00:41:16.046 --> 00:41:18.686 A:middle
to show you the performance
cost of each line.

00:41:19.036 --> 00:41:22.596 A:middle
And so here I see that,
okay, 59 percent of the cost

00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:25.936 A:middle
of this shader was going
into shadow projection.

00:41:25.936 --> 00:41:27.926 A:middle
And that's probably
something I can optimize.

00:41:27.926 --> 00:41:30.206 A:middle
I can use a lower resolution
shadow map or something.

00:41:30.616 --> 00:41:33.886 A:middle
Because, remember, this was
the most expensive shader

00:41:34.096 --> 00:41:34.466 A:middle
in the app.

00:41:35.126 --> 00:41:37.776 A:middle
And the renderer utilization
was at 100 percent.

00:41:37.886 --> 00:41:41.616 A:middle
So this is the bottleneck,
this shadow projection.

00:41:41.616 --> 00:41:43.646 A:middle
And so it's exactly
what, in this case,

00:41:43.936 --> 00:41:45.156 A:middle
needs to be optimized out.

00:41:45.896 --> 00:41:48.556 A:middle
But, so the point, though,
is that the tools can be used

00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:52.026 A:middle
to exactly pinpoint what's
going on in your app.

00:41:52.256 --> 00:41:54.976 A:middle
Now, you know, if you're
not familiar with the tool

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:58.546 A:middle
or this isn't something that
you know your way around yet,

00:41:58.546 --> 00:41:59.606 A:middle
just come down to the labs.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.006 --> 00:42:01.866 A:middle
We have so many people
down there who would love

00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:03.996 A:middle
to help you to suss this out.

00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:07.086 A:middle
But so, obviously, there's
an opportunity here, right,

00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:11.486 A:middle
for OpenGL ES-based games to
kind of use the tools, optimize

00:42:11.486 --> 00:42:12.706 A:middle
and get better performance.

00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:15.676 A:middle
But I also want to be
super clear, you know,

00:42:15.676 --> 00:42:20.316 A:middle
that seeing so many developers
struggle and face these kinds

00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:24.176 A:middle
of issues are a big part
of the reason why SpriteKit

00:42:24.176 --> 00:42:26.396 A:middle
and SceneKit were
developed, right.

00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:28.826 A:middle
Their purpose is to provide you

00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:30.916 A:middle
with the capabilities
that you need, right?

00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:34.876 A:middle
2D games with SpriteKit,
3D games with SceneKit.

00:42:35.146 --> 00:42:38.116 A:middle
Or now they can be
mixed together, right.

00:42:38.626 --> 00:42:41.546 A:middle
But the real key is that
once you're using them

00:42:41.546 --> 00:42:43.726 A:middle
and taking advantage
of their feature set,

00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:48.926 A:middle
they take on the burden of
rendering optimally in OpenGL.

00:42:48.926 --> 00:42:50.716 A:middle
And you don't have to
worry about it anymore.

00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:54.726 A:middle
And, if you think about it,
one more step, you know,

00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:58.766 A:middle
since Apple provides the
entire technology stack

00:42:58.766 --> 00:43:02.836 A:middle
from these APIs all the
way down to the hardware,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.766 --> 00:43:02.836 A:middle
from these APIs all the
way down to the hardware,

00:43:03.176 --> 00:43:06.936 A:middle
it means that everything can
be made very optimal in a way

00:43:06.936 --> 00:43:08.356 A:middle
that you don't have to work on.

00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:13.156 A:middle
And then, okay, speaking
of optimal, right.

00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:15.246 A:middle
Now there's Metal, right.

00:43:15.476 --> 00:43:19.296 A:middle
So this, this is for those
of you with games or engines

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:22.546 A:middle
that need to push a
lot more draw calls.

00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:27.156 A:middle
And really allow your code
to have very efficient access

00:43:27.156 --> 00:43:31.576 A:middle
to the GPU to interleave
graphics and compute, and so on.

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:33.286 A:middle
And really take control yourself

00:43:33.286 --> 00:43:35.616 A:middle
over how the frame
is being rendered.

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:39.546 A:middle
So that is number seven:
optimize graphics performance.

00:43:41.326 --> 00:43:44.256 A:middle
Okay, number eight: now,
we're lifting out of the tech

00:43:44.256 --> 00:43:46.206 A:middle
in just a couple of
really kind of quick

00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:47.826 A:middle
and light bits of advice here.

00:43:48.266 --> 00:43:50.136 A:middle
This is a super quick one.

00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:52.526 A:middle
It's to make a great
gameplay video.

00:43:52.946 --> 00:43:54.356 A:middle
You know, so earlier
in the talk,

00:43:54.356 --> 00:43:55.386 A:middle
I talked about the importance

00:43:55.386 --> 00:43:57.476 A:middle
of making a really
great first impression.

00:43:57.796 --> 00:44:00.176 A:middle
But what I didn't
really get into then was


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.796 --> 00:44:00.176 A:middle
But what I didn't
really get into then was

00:44:00.176 --> 00:44:01.876 A:middle
that from the user's
perspective,

00:44:01.876 --> 00:44:04.496 A:middle
your player's perspective,
all of that is going

00:44:04.496 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
to start on the App Store.

00:44:06.326 --> 00:44:09.186 A:middle
And, you know, as we talked
about yesterday, you know,

00:44:09.186 --> 00:44:11.326 A:middle
when people are really
coming on to the App Store,

00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.536 A:middle
they're looking for
something that's cool and new.

00:44:13.536 --> 00:44:16.806 A:middle
You know, they're going to be
looking for some way to kind

00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:19.396 A:middle
of understand what
your game is doing.

00:44:19.396 --> 00:44:22.856 A:middle
And you want to have something
that's going to stand out

00:44:23.566 --> 00:44:25.426 A:middle
and exactly explain it.

00:44:25.946 --> 00:44:28.266 A:middle
And so that they'll
be more confident

00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:30.386 A:middle
and more ready to get your game.

00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:34.066 A:middle
Okay. Now, as we talked
about a little bit yesterday,

00:44:34.066 --> 00:44:37.226 A:middle
so in iOS 8, OS X
Yosemite, you'll be able

00:44:37.226 --> 00:44:39.556 A:middle
to create these short
app previews

00:44:39.556 --> 00:44:41.626 A:middle
or game previews
to demo your game.

00:44:42.086 --> 00:44:44.516 A:middle
You should use this to show
how the game is played.

00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.156 A:middle
You know, use it.

00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:48.316 A:middle
Tell a story with
this and really appeal

00:44:48.316 --> 00:44:50.736 A:middle
to what makes the
gameplay so much fun.

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:54.686 A:middle
You know, here's how it'll look
when it's on the App Store.

00:44:54.966 --> 00:44:58.146 A:middle
We showed this "Monument
Valley" example yesterday.

00:44:58.146 --> 00:45:03.226 A:middle
And how it works is just
the app preview just appears


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.146 --> 00:45:03.226 A:middle
And how it works is just
the app preview just appears

00:45:03.696 --> 00:45:06.326 A:middle
as the first image there
along with the screenshot.

00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:09.286 A:middle
User taps on that, and they
can see this gameplay video.

00:45:09.816 --> 00:45:11.996 A:middle
But now some details about this.

00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:15.926 A:middle
Okay. So the app preview
needs to be, you know,

00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.276 A:middle
a video of your gameplay.

00:45:17.276 --> 00:45:19.096 A:middle
It's not intended to be an ad.

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:23.086 A:middle
It should convey the real
experience of playing the game.

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:26.136 A:middle
It can be up to 30 seconds long.

00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:30.846 A:middle
You provide it as an H.264,
you know, MPEG4 encoded file

00:45:30.846 --> 00:45:32.506 A:middle
that you upload into
iTunes Connect.

00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:36.136 A:middle
You can have, or you should
have a different video

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:38.126 A:middle
for iPhone versus iPad.

00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:43.136 A:middle
And your content itself can
be captured directly off

00:45:43.136 --> 00:45:47.216 A:middle
of your iOS device and onto
your Mac that's running OS

00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:47.976 A:middle
X Yosemite.

00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:51.346 A:middle
The Mac just sees the iOS
device as a video camera.

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.096 A:middle
And you start playing the game,

00:45:53.096 --> 00:45:55.596 A:middle
and you can capture it using
whatever tool you like:

00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:57.806 A:middle
Quicktime Player, and so on.

00:45:57.806 --> 00:45:59.876 A:middle
iMovie is where you
can do your editing.

00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:01.626 A:middle
And then just put it
all together and get it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:01.626 A:middle
And then just put it
all together and get it

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:03.746 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect,
and you're ready to go.

00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:07.636 A:middle
And then this is really
just sort of one piece

00:46:07.636 --> 00:46:11.706 A:middle
of building a great App
Store presence, right.

00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:14.956 A:middle
So having a great icon,
compelling screenshots,

00:46:15.286 --> 00:46:19.506 A:middle
localizations, description,
your keywords, and so on.

00:46:20.016 --> 00:46:23.066 A:middle
Okay. So about app previews,
there's a whole session

00:46:23.066 --> 00:46:25.426 A:middle
on it that's also on
Thursday afternoon.

00:46:25.426 --> 00:46:27.176 A:middle
Check your schedule to see that.

00:46:28.366 --> 00:46:32.236 A:middle
And make a great video
that's going to show players

00:46:32.236 --> 00:46:35.136 A:middle
who are interested in your
game what the gameplay is

00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:35.626 A:middle
really like.

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.936 A:middle
Okay. Number nine
is to localize.

00:46:40.836 --> 00:46:43.466 A:middle
You know the App Store
is a global business.

00:46:43.856 --> 00:46:49.156 A:middle
It's available in 155 countries
in 40 languages, right.

00:46:49.156 --> 00:46:53.456 A:middle
So this, this is an opportunity
that is just phenomenal

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.466 A:middle
and you should think globally.

00:46:55.466 --> 00:46:57.956 A:middle
You know, you need to think
about the distribution

00:46:57.956 --> 00:47:00.676 A:middle
of your game as a
global opportunity.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:57.956 --> 00:47:00.676 A:middle
of your game as a
global opportunity.

00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:05.026 A:middle
Now, so the first thing
that you should do,

00:47:05.026 --> 00:47:06.746 A:middle
if you haven't already
done this,

00:47:07.066 --> 00:47:10.476 A:middle
is to localize your App
Store presence, right.

00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:15.346 A:middle
Just so that when a player in
some other region is coming in

00:47:15.346 --> 00:47:17.856 A:middle
and looking at your game,
it just stands to reason

00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:19.996 A:middle
that they'll be more
interested in it

00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:23.166 A:middle
if they can read the description
of these other things

00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.996 A:middle
in their native language, right.

00:47:24.996 --> 00:47:28.936 A:middle
So localize the name, the
description, the keywords,

00:47:29.176 --> 00:47:32.826 A:middle
the snapshots, and so on, right.

00:47:32.826 --> 00:47:35.606 A:middle
And then the second
piece of this, of course,

00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:37.856 A:middle
is to localize the
app content itself.

00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:42.556 A:middle
So by that I mean to really go
back and structure your game

00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:44.136 A:middle
for internationalization.

00:47:44.136 --> 00:47:46.216 A:middle
You'll need to do what
you can to separate text

00:47:46.576 --> 00:47:48.856 A:middle
from artwork and texture.

00:47:48.856 --> 00:47:51.446 A:middle
So you don't have to
make copies of big images

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:53.156 A:middle
for every language
that you support.

00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:55.706 A:middle
And then go through your UI.

00:47:56.366 --> 00:47:57.646 A:middle
And, of course, right.

00:47:57.646 --> 00:48:00.326 A:middle
And translate the text into
all the different languages


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.646 --> 00:48:00.326 A:middle
And translate the text into
all the different languages

00:48:00.326 --> 00:48:01.876 A:middle
that you want to support.

00:48:01.876 --> 00:48:05.226 A:middle
And then, finally, you
know, also, consider things

00:48:05.226 --> 00:48:07.106 A:middle
like whether your game is right

00:48:07.106 --> 00:48:10.286 A:middle
to provide some culturalized
content

00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:11.906 A:middle
where it would be appropriate.

00:48:12.286 --> 00:48:14.336 A:middle
For example, if it
was a driving game,

00:48:14.526 --> 00:48:16.596 A:middle
maybe you would use
local road signs

00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.326 A:middle
for different locales and so on.

00:48:18.676 --> 00:48:20.796 A:middle
Local license plates
from different locales.

00:48:23.216 --> 00:48:27.466 A:middle
So, now, here's a list
of some of the languages

00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:29.546 A:middle
that we've recommended before.

00:48:29.546 --> 00:48:31.466 A:middle
It's certainly not exhaustive.

00:48:31.466 --> 00:48:32.826 A:middle
It's a big list.

00:48:32.886 --> 00:48:34.746 A:middle
And it's a good place
to start though.

00:48:35.206 --> 00:48:38.046 A:middle
So first is EFIGS,
right: English, French,

00:48:38.046 --> 00:48:39.246 A:middle
Italian, German, Spanish.

00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:44.786 A:middle
Then many regions in Asia, so
Japanese, Korean, Traditional

00:48:44.786 --> 00:48:47.616 A:middle
and Simplified Chinese, and
then branches out from there.

00:48:47.616 --> 00:48:50.146 A:middle
So Brazilian, Portuguese,
Russian, Turkish,

00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:53.036 A:middle
and Arabic are what
we would recommend

00:48:53.036 --> 00:48:54.596 A:middle
that you really put
some focus into.

00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:57.796 A:middle
And there's a great
resource online:

00:48:57.936 --> 00:49:00.696 A:middle
developer.apple.com/
internationalization.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:57.936 --> 00:49:00.696 A:middle
developer.apple.com/
internationalization.

00:49:01.156 --> 00:49:03.876 A:middle
So this will take you step
by step through the process

00:49:03.876 --> 00:49:07.326 A:middle
of internationalizing and
localizing your app, your game.

00:49:07.806 --> 00:49:12.486 A:middle
And it gives you some links to
third party localization vendors

00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:15.186 A:middle
if you don't have that
expertise in-house.

00:49:16.176 --> 00:49:19.096 A:middle
But, so that is number
nine: to localize.

00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:24.056 A:middle
And so number 10: to
target the state of the art.

00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:29.626 A:middle
So if you think about some of
the best games that are on iOS,

00:49:30.516 --> 00:49:32.686 A:middle
you know, a real common
thread, as we've been saying,

00:49:32.686 --> 00:49:35.466 A:middle
is how they consistently
aim high

00:49:35.466 --> 00:49:38.936 A:middle
and consistently target
the latest and greatest

00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:41.546 A:middle
to differentiate
themselves on our devices.

00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:46.956 A:middle
So to be state-of-the-art
means really taking advantage

00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:48.036 A:middle
of the capabilities

00:49:48.036 --> 00:49:50.896 A:middle
of the latest hardware
like the A7, right.

00:49:51.186 --> 00:49:54.226 A:middle
And target the feature
set of those devices

00:49:54.226 --> 00:49:55.866 A:middle
so that you stand out.

00:49:56.496 --> 00:50:00.566 A:middle
I mean, you guys, you saw
those demos yesterday, right,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:56.496 --> 00:50:00.566 A:middle
I mean, you guys, you saw
those demos yesterday, right,

00:50:00.566 --> 00:50:02.366 A:middle
during the "Keynote",
the "State of the Union".

00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:04.686 A:middle
They were on this hardware.

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:08.316 A:middle
You know, you've
seen what it can do.

00:50:08.656 --> 00:50:11.686 A:middle
So take advantage
of that, that power,

00:50:11.726 --> 00:50:14.626 A:middle
that capability that's there.

00:50:14.826 --> 00:50:17.616 A:middle
Then hand in hand with
that, is that state

00:50:17.616 --> 00:50:21.566 A:middle
of the art apps support
the latest versions of iOS.

00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:26.616 A:middle
And I think that this week
should be that turning point

00:50:26.616 --> 00:50:31.346 A:middle
for you where it's time now for
you to realign your projects

00:50:31.586 --> 00:50:36.376 A:middle
to aim for the release of iOS 8
and the APIs and the frameworks

00:50:36.376 --> 00:50:38.646 A:middle
that you'll be learning
about all this week.

00:50:38.956 --> 00:50:42.586 A:middle
And then bring your
minimum OS up to iOS 7.

00:50:43.066 --> 00:50:44.736 A:middle
That is our recommendation.

00:50:44.736 --> 00:50:47.776 A:middle
Support the latest
N and N minus 1.

00:50:48.156 --> 00:50:51.396 A:middle
So when iOS 8 is released,
you'll probably want

00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:53.116 A:middle
to be looking at 7 and 8.

00:50:54.276 --> 00:50:58.776 A:middle
Okay. Now something, you know,
something that we do hear

00:50:58.776 --> 00:51:01.346 A:middle
from developers, actually more
often than you might think,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.776 --> 00:51:01.346 A:middle
from developers, actually more
often than you might think,

00:51:01.346 --> 00:51:05.886 A:middle
is that they're telling us
that they'll, they're deciding

00:51:05.886 --> 00:51:08.716 A:middle
to stick with an older version
of Xcode or an older SDK

00:51:08.716 --> 00:51:12.716 A:middle
because they think that if
they move up to what's latest,

00:51:13.106 --> 00:51:15.006 A:middle
they won't be able
to still ship a game

00:51:15.006 --> 00:51:17.336 A:middle
that supports anything
older than that.

00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:20.356 A:middle
But obviously that's
not the case.

00:51:21.066 --> 00:51:24.886 A:middle
So you can adopt the latest SDK
version by setting your base SDK

00:51:24.886 --> 00:51:29.026 A:middle
to what is current and then
setting your deployment target

00:51:29.026 --> 00:51:32.746 A:middle
down to the lowest OS version
that you want to support

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:35.016 A:middle
and dropping support
for the rest.

00:51:35.716 --> 00:51:39.286 A:middle
And then handle differences
between 7 and 8 in your code.

00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:40.826 A:middle
You know, check for
the existence

00:51:41.146 --> 00:51:42.666 A:middle
of hardware capabilities.

00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:45.116 A:middle
Or check whether
classes are defined.

00:51:45.386 --> 00:51:47.086 A:middle
Or check whether classes respond

00:51:47.086 --> 00:51:49.016 A:middle
to a particular selector
and so on.

00:51:49.746 --> 00:51:52.116 A:middle
Now for those of you who
are coming over to iOS

00:51:52.116 --> 00:51:55.156 A:middle
and are just not as
familiar with that process,

00:51:55.296 --> 00:51:57.986 A:middle
we actually went through
it all in pretty good depth

00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:02.566 A:middle
when we went out for our iOS
7 Tech Talks last November,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:02.566 A:middle
when we went out for our iOS
7 Tech Talks last November,

00:52:02.566 --> 00:52:03.056 A:middle
December.

00:52:03.556 --> 00:52:06.926 A:middle
And so those videos are online
on our developer website.

00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:08.566 A:middle
So you should check them out.

00:52:10.376 --> 00:52:12.946 A:middle
Then also, state of the
art games are the ones

00:52:12.976 --> 00:52:15.876 A:middle
that integrate with our
built in game technologies

00:52:16.536 --> 00:52:19.186 A:middle
as Geoff talked about.

00:52:20.026 --> 00:52:24.186 A:middle
So we're providing just this
incredible foundation for you.

00:52:24.506 --> 00:52:27.866 A:middle
It's built on a lot of different
APIs, you know, like SpriteKit,

00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:32.446 A:middle
Game Center, OpenGL, and
Game Controllers and so on.

00:52:32.446 --> 00:52:36.426 A:middle
And then the new APIs, like
Metal and SceneKit on iOS.

00:52:37.316 --> 00:52:40.006 A:middle
Right. And these are just
a few of the technologies.

00:52:40.006 --> 00:52:40.976 A:middle
You know this.

00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:45.056 A:middle
But the point I want to make
is about the other things.

00:52:45.056 --> 00:52:48.746 A:middle
You know, the tools and the
APIs that are available to you

00:52:48.746 --> 00:52:52.606 A:middle
as game developers is
comprehensive on iOS.

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.966 A:middle
And you should learn
the entire stack.

00:52:56.796 --> 00:52:59.056 A:middle
Oh, my god, that's a
lot of learning to do.

00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:02.676 A:middle
But really what I mean is
to familiarize yourself


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:02.676 A:middle
But really what I mean is
to familiarize yourself

00:53:02.676 --> 00:53:06.066 A:middle
with the technologies
that are on iOS rather

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:09.536 A:middle
than just taking a project
that you were working on,

00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:12.916 A:middle
maybe on another platform
or on an older OS version,

00:53:13.076 --> 00:53:16.526 A:middle
and just shifting that over and
fitting it into the equivalent.

00:53:17.116 --> 00:53:20.676 A:middle
Your target should be to go
for the latest and greatest.

00:53:20.736 --> 00:53:24.586 A:middle
Target the top, target the
state of the art, target the A7,

00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:28.236 A:middle
target iOS 8 and its
capabilities, right,

00:53:28.896 --> 00:53:31.766 A:middle
rather than just coming
over and just fitting

00:53:31.986 --> 00:53:33.806 A:middle
in with something that's older.

00:53:34.256 --> 00:53:38.066 A:middle
But, so that's number 10:
target the state of the art.

00:53:38.626 --> 00:53:40.796 A:middle
But before I finish, I
do have one more thing

00:53:40.796 --> 00:53:42.476 A:middle
that I want to talk about.

00:53:43.706 --> 00:53:47.346 A:middle
So you know let's say that
you've done all 10 of these.

00:53:47.346 --> 00:53:51.496 A:middle
You've fixed your onboarding,
you tuned up your Core Loop,

00:53:51.496 --> 00:53:53.036 A:middle
you're optimized,
you're localized,

00:53:53.036 --> 00:53:55.416 A:middle
you're state-of-the-art,
etc., all 10.

00:53:55.916 --> 00:53:58.856 A:middle
So where do you go from here?

00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:01.696 A:middle
Yeah, well, go to 11.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:01.696 A:middle
Yeah, well, go to 11.

00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:05.506 A:middle
Really, give it that extra push.

00:54:06.216 --> 00:54:07.686 A:middle
Go the extra mile.

00:54:08.126 --> 00:54:10.496 A:middle
Because here is my
observation about this,

00:54:11.226 --> 00:54:12.996 A:middle
you know: We keep innovating.

00:54:13.386 --> 00:54:16.066 A:middle
We keep enhancing our
game technologies.

00:54:16.206 --> 00:54:19.306 A:middle
And we have this
thriving ecosystem, right,

00:54:19.586 --> 00:54:20.716 A:middle
where we're investing.

00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:23.946 A:middle
We're adding performance,
and we're adding capability.

00:54:24.446 --> 00:54:26.566 A:middle
You guys, you can't stand still.

00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:28.246 A:middle
Keep inventing.

00:54:28.576 --> 00:54:29.346 A:middle
Keep learning.

00:54:29.746 --> 00:54:30.506 A:middle
Keep current.

00:54:30.946 --> 00:54:35.546 A:middle
Get started on that next update
for iOS 8, and keep up with us

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:39.426 A:middle
because we love to shine
the spotlight on developers

00:54:39.426 --> 00:54:42.086 A:middle
who can go one louder.

00:54:43.186 --> 00:54:43.536 A:middle
All right.

00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:45.216 A:middle
So thank you, everyone.

00:54:45.316 --> 00:54:46.926 A:middle
That is my list.

00:54:47.516 --> 00:54:52.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:54:53.486 --> 00:54:57.706 A:middle
And just to wrap things up,
I'd like to pass the stage back

00:54:57.706 --> 00:54:59.076 A:middle
to Geoff for just a moment.

00:54:59.076 --> 00:54:59.876 A:middle
So thank you.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:06.456 --> 00:55:07.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Allan.

00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:10.906 A:middle
So thank you very much, Allan.

00:55:11.226 --> 00:55:15.566 A:middle
And I think, when I step
back and look at this,

00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:16.686 A:middle
we see a tremendous
amount of games.

00:55:16.686 --> 00:55:18.116 A:middle
You look around the room;
there's a lot of you

00:55:18.116 --> 00:55:19.586 A:middle
who are interested
in building games.

00:55:19.906 --> 00:55:22.376 A:middle
And there's a large number
of games in the App Store.

00:55:22.376 --> 00:55:25.386 A:middle
We're talking about how you
can make your game stand out.

00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:27.746 A:middle
It isn't good enough to
just go, "Oh, I'm going to.

00:55:27.746 --> 00:55:28.396 A:middle
I have a great idea.

00:55:28.976 --> 00:55:29.596 A:middle
It's a cool game.

00:55:29.596 --> 00:55:32.316 A:middle
I'm going to toss it up onto the
App Store and see what happens."

00:55:32.316 --> 00:55:35.976 A:middle
It is a very big pond, so
use what Allan has told you.

00:55:35.976 --> 00:55:38.116 A:middle
Use these 10 steps,
and use the 11th step.

00:55:39.346 --> 00:55:41.216 A:middle
And really make your game shine.

00:55:41.656 --> 00:55:44.196 A:middle
These are the things which may
not be apparent when you look

00:55:44.196 --> 00:55:45.696 A:middle
at it, it may not be
apparent when you look

00:55:45.696 --> 00:55:48.976 A:middle
at the Design Awards Winners
that they do these things.

00:55:48.976 --> 00:55:51.116 A:middle
But they really do, they
spend a lot of time.

00:55:51.536 --> 00:55:52.816 A:middle
"Cut the Rope" was
a great example.

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:55.916 A:middle
Spent a lot of time on
going through with people

00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:58.366 A:middle
who haven't played the
game before and say, "Hey,

00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:01.656 A:middle
when you approach the game
what do you need to know?"


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:01.656 A:middle
when you approach the game
what do you need to know?"

00:56:01.876 --> 00:56:03.996 A:middle
It's not just like that
came to them in an hour.

00:56:04.366 --> 00:56:05.786 A:middle
So take the time with your game.

00:56:06.106 --> 00:56:07.666 A:middle
Take the time to
go that extra mile.

00:56:08.046 --> 00:56:10.856 A:middle
Take the time to adopt
these 10 items and the 11th

00:56:11.196 --> 00:56:14.326 A:middle
and really bring your
content up so it stands out.

00:56:14.326 --> 00:56:17.106 A:middle
And we really hope to
see someone in this room

00:56:17.106 --> 00:56:19.836 A:middle
or many people in this
room on stage next year

00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:20.846 A:middle
at the Apple Design Awards.

00:56:21.116 --> 00:56:22.446 A:middle
Thank you very much
and enjoy the week.
