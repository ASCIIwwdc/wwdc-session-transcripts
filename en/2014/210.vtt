00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:12.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:16.146 A:middle
I'm Clare and I'm on the
iOS Accessibility Team here

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:16.486 A:middle
at Apple.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.136 A:middle
Today, I'll be sharing with
you about accessibility on iOS,

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:25.376 A:middle
and how you can develop your
apps to be used by everyone.

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.886 A:middle
Our talk today is going
to be in two parts.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:32.716 A:middle
First, I'll give an
introduction to accessibility.

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:35.606 A:middle
I'll talk about some of
the features we offer

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:39.796 A:middle
on iOS currently, as well as
some new things coming in iOS 8.

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.426 A:middle
In the second part of this talk,

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.476 A:middle
I'll be showing you how you
can make your apps accessible,

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.236 A:middle
both by adding visual
accommodations,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.726 A:middle
and by implementing
Semantic Accessibility.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.036 A:middle
So first, what is accessibility?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.036 A:middle
So first, what is accessibility?

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
Accessibility is all

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
about making things
usable for everyone.

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:09.946 A:middle
On iOS, we look at four
broad areas of user needs.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.906 A:middle
We want users with physical
and motor challenges,

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.156 A:middle
users with learning needs,
users with hearing loss,

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.846 A:middle
and users with different
vision needs,

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.236 A:middle
to be able to experience
iOS fully.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.366 A:middle
Our goal is equal
access for everyone.

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:33.576 A:middle
So let's look at some examples
of how we accomplish this.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.836 A:middle
Some users may have a physical
impairment that prevents them

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:38.186 A:middle
from using the touch screen.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:42.066 A:middle
In fact, their only [inaudible]
device may be a switch.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.156 A:middle
A switch could be something
like a button mounted

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.186 A:middle
on a wheelchair headrest.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:51.276 A:middle
So how do we make the rich
touch interface of iOS usable

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:53.026 A:middle
by someone who can
only use a switch?

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:57.636 A:middle
Our answer is Switch Control.

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:02.356 A:middle
When Switch Control is enabled,
a cursor appears on the screen,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:02.356 A:middle
When Switch Control is enabled,
a cursor appears on the screen,

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:07.066 A:middle
and it moves from item to
item with a specific timing.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:12.086 A:middle
When the user activates their
switch, that lets them interact

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.266 A:middle
with a highlighted element,

00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:16.646 A:middle
so they can do things
like tap or scroll.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:21.566 A:middle
Next, let's look at learning.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:24.846 A:middle
iOS devices have been incredibly
powerful in the classroom,

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.576 A:middle
because of their
easy to use interface

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:29.136 A:middle
and their engaging apps.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:32.086 A:middle
For the same reasons,
they've been great

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.626 A:middle
for children with autism.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.196 A:middle
But for these users, we faced
some unique challenges at first.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:41.236 A:middle
For one, when a child with
autism is learning in an app,

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.616 A:middle
they might decide to
press the Home button.

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.336 A:middle
And now the device is
full of distractions.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:50.896 A:middle
So to address this issue,
we created Guided Access,

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.326 A:middle
which is a way for
parents or educators

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:56.286 A:middle
to keep the device
in a specific app.

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
When Guided Access is enabled,
pressing the Home button


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
When Guided Access is enabled,
pressing the Home button

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:02.036 A:middle
or the Lock button
have no effect,

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.846 A:middle
and so the child can have
an uninterrupted learning

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.716 A:middle
experience, free
from distractions.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:12.116 A:middle
Next, let's look at hearing.

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:15.846 A:middle
Many users with hearing
loss use hearing aids

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.806 A:middle
to help amplify the
sound around them,

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.136 A:middle
but traditional hearing aids
come with a couple of issues.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.876 A:middle
First, they require that
you carry a remote with you

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.326 A:middle
so that you can adjust
the volume,

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:28.946 A:middle
and that can be cumbersome.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:33.346 A:middle
And second, call quality
can be less than optimal

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:34.696 A:middle
when using a hearing aid.

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.096 A:middle
When you have a phone
next to a hearing aid,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.036 A:middle
either the hearing aid
amplifies all the sound,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:43.826 A:middle
including background noise,
or it picks up the signal

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.656 A:middle
from the phone's
electromagnetic field,

00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:49.286 A:middle
but that signal can also
be noisy, creating static.

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:54.326 A:middle
So to address these two
issues, we partnered

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:56.516 A:middle
with hearing aid
manufacturers around the globe

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
to create made-for-iPhone
hearing aids.

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.866 A:middle
These hearing aids connect
directly to your iPhone,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.866 A:middle
These hearing aids connect
directly to your iPhone,

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:04.516 A:middle
and you can do things
like adjust the volume

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.246 A:middle
of your hearing aids, without
the need for a separate remote.

00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.866 A:middle
In addition, audio streams
directly from your iPhone

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:11.806 A:middle
to your hearing aid,

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:14.116 A:middle
so it becomes effectively
a Bluetooth headset.

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:17.245 A:middle
And that improves call
quality dramatically.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:23.656 A:middle
Finally, let's look at
the broad area of vision.

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.266 A:middle
When the iPhone was
first introduced,

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:29.916 A:middle
many people were concerned that
blind users would not be able

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.286 A:middle
to take advantage
of its features.

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:35.096 A:middle
Because if you think about it,
how do you use a touch screen

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:36.856 A:middle
if you don't see the screen.

00:04:37.636 --> 00:04:38.776 A:middle
It's going to be difficult

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:41.046 A:middle
because you won't necessarily
know what you're touching,

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:43.116 A:middle
and you might accidentally
tap a button

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.206 A:middle
that you didn't mean to tap.

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.756 A:middle
So to address this,
we created VoiceOver.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:53.126 A:middle
When VoiceOver is enabled,
a user can touch anywhere

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.636 A:middle
on screen to hear what
they just touched,

00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:02.976 A:middle
before they take an action
like tapping a button.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:02.976 A:middle
before they take an action
like tapping a button.

00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.236 A:middle
We also have accommodations
in our settings for users

00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
with low vision who may not
necessarily need the full power

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:10.226 A:middle
of VoiceOver.

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.986 A:middle
For example, some users
prefer bolder fonts,

00:05:14.266 --> 00:05:18.746 A:middle
in which case they can enable
bold text to get thicker text.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:22.396 A:middle
Some users may need
higher contrast, and if so,

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:24.786 A:middle
we offer several options,
including the ability

00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.136 A:middle
to reduce transparency
on the system.

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.716 A:middle
And finally, for users who
are more sensitive to motion,

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.356 A:middle
we offer a Reduce
Motion setting,

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
which provides more
subtle transitions.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:40.076 A:middle
For example, when you launch an
app with Reduce Motion enabled,

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.516 A:middle
it cross-fades into view.

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:49.356 A:middle
So that's some of what
we offer on iOS currently

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:50.636 A:middle
to support equal access.

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:54.026 A:middle
But we've been working hard, and
I'd like to highlight just some

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:56.026 A:middle
of the new features
we're offering in iOS 8.

00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
First, Guided Access
Time Limits.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
First, Guided Access
Time Limits.

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
Time limits are all
about transitions.

00:06:04.286 --> 00:06:08.496 A:middle
When a child is immersed in an
app, and then it's time to move

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:09.506 A:middle
on to the next activity,

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
that transition can
cause some anxiety.

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:16.886 A:middle
With time limits, a caretaker
can assign a specific amount

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:18.696 A:middle
of time that a child
should use an app.

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.386 A:middle
When the time limit
is almost reached,

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.756 A:middle
the child receives a warning,
helping them to prepare to move

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:25.836 A:middle
on to the next activity.

00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:29.886 A:middle
And when the time limit
is over, the device locks.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:32.676 A:middle
Next, we're bringing
Alex to iOS.

00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:35.456 A:middle
Some of you may have
already met Alex.

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:37.986 A:middle
But for those who haven't,
I'll let him introduce himself.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:44.066 A:middle
I'm Alex. And I'm
the US English voice.

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:48.746 A:middle
I've been living on Macs for
years, and now I'm excited

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:51.036 A:middle
to make myself at home on iOS.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So Alex will be
available in all

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.276 A:middle
of our assistive
technologies that use speech,

00:06:56.626 --> 00:06:58.926 A:middle
including VoiceOver,
Speak Selection,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:01.866 A:middle
and a new feature
we're introducing

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:03.656 A:middle
in iOS 8, called Speak Screen.

00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:06.086 A:middle
Speak Screen is great for anyone

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.546 A:middle
who might have trouble
reading the screen.

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:12.336 A:middle
When it's enabled, you can do
a simple gesture or ask Siri

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:13.336 A:middle
to speak the screen to you,

00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:16.776 A:middle
and the device will start
reading whatever's on screen.

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
You also get options, like
the ability to pause, rewind,

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:22.436 A:middle
or again slow down the speech.

00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:27.476 A:middle
And finally, I'd like
to highlight Zoom.

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:30.836 A:middle
Some of you may have been
using Zoom for years on iOS,

00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:35.486 A:middle
but we've re-imagined it in
iOS 8, and have a whole new way

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:37.616 A:middle
for you to interact with it.

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:40.616 A:middle
But before I introduce
that, let's first talk

00:07:40.616 --> 00:07:42.056 A:middle
about what Zoom does currently.

00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:46.496 A:middle
Zoom magnifies the
entire screen,

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:49.586 A:middle
and then you use three-finger
gestures to navigate.

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.966 A:middle
This approach comes
with a few issues.

00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:56.496 A:middle
First, if you're using
three-finger gestures,

00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.286 A:middle
that means you're covering up a
significant part of the screen,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.286 A:middle
that means you're covering up a
significant part of the screen,

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:03.406 A:middle
especially on iPhones.

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:06.856 A:middle
Also using three-finger
gestures means it's hard

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:08.196 A:middle
to use a phone on the go.

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:11.406 A:middle
You can't use the phone in a
single hand, you always need

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.926 A:middle
to have one hand to hold
it, and the other hand

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.036 A:middle
to do the three-finger gestures.

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:20.996 A:middle
And finally, typing can be
tricky with Zoom enabled.

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:23.196 A:middle
You have the choice
between zooming

00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:25.266 A:middle
in on the content
you're creating,

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.976 A:middle
or having access to
the full keyboard.

00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:30.726 A:middle
But you can't have
both at the same time.

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:35.126 A:middle
So to address all
of these issues,

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:37.706 A:middle
we're introducing a new
windowed mode for Zoom.

00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:39.265 A:middle
And I'd like to demo
that to you now.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.525 A:middle
This is windowed Zoom.

00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:45.346 A:middle
Notice how only part of
the screen is magnified?

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
I can change what part is
magnified by dragging the edge

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.046 A:middle
of the window with
a single finger.

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:56.456 A:middle
I can also tap the edge of the
window to get resize handles,

00:08:56.586 --> 00:08:58.806 A:middle
so I can change how much
of the screen is magnified.

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:04.156 A:middle
If I tap on the arrow at the
edge of the window, I get a menu


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:04.156 A:middle
If I tap on the arrow at the
edge of the window, I get a menu

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.176 A:middle
with several options,
including the ability

00:09:06.176 --> 00:09:07.306 A:middle
to adjust my Zoom level.

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:11.456 A:middle
Now, let's go into notes.

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:16.266 A:middle
I'm going to create a new
note, and watch what happens

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:17.666 A:middle
when the keyboard comes up.

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:21.046 A:middle
The Zoom window automatically
got out of the way

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:23.516 A:middle
of the keyboard, so I have
full access of the keyboard,

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.236 A:middle
but my content is zoomed.

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:31.996 A:middle
And as I type, notice how the
Zoom window follows my cursor.

00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:33.916 A:middle
So I can always see
what I just typed.

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:37.436 A:middle
So that's some of what we've
been doing here at Apple

00:09:37.846 --> 00:09:39.746 A:middle
to promote equal
access for everyone.

00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:43.626 A:middle
But for the second part of
the story, we need your help.

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:48.036 A:middle
IOS is a great platform because
of all the apps you guys create,

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:50.106 A:middle
and it's up to you to make sure

00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:52.266 A:middle
that your apps can
be used by everyone.

00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:56.906 A:middle
To that end, I'll be showing
you now how you can do

00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:57.706 A:middle
that with our API.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:02.506 A:middle
Our tutorial is going
to be in two parts.

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:06.516 A:middle
First, I'll show you how to add
visual accommodations for users

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:07.506 A:middle
with different vision needs.

00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:09.846 A:middle
And second, I'll
be showing you how

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:11.616 A:middle
to implement some
magic accessibility.

00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:16.356 A:middle
So an assistive technology like
VoiceOver can navigate your app.

00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:17.906 A:middle
Earlier in this talk,
I showed some

00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:20.996 A:middle
of the visual accommodations
we offer on iOS for users

00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:21.946 A:middle
with different vision needs.

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:24.306 A:middle
Now, we're providing API,

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.346 A:middle
so you can make those
accommodations

00:10:26.346 --> 00:10:27.456 A:middle
in your apps as well.

00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:31.826 A:middle
We have a way for you to detect
whether the user has bold text,

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:34.536 A:middle
reduced transparency,
darkened colors,

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.106 A:middle
or Reduce Motion enabled.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.986 A:middle
And that makes it
really easy for you

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.116 A:middle
to make specific adjustments
in your app for those users.

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:44.776 A:middle
So I'd like to show you
how you can do that now,

00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:47.636 A:middle
using a sample app we've
created for this presentation.

00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:51.636 A:middle
Okay, so first we're going to
identify some areas of our app

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:53.206 A:middle
that need visual accommodations.

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.816 A:middle
To do that, I've
gone to my simulator,

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:58.606 A:middle
and I've enabled several of
the accessibility settings.

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:02.476 A:middle
In this case, I've got
Bold Text, Reduce Motion,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:02.476 A:middle
In this case, I've got
Bold Text, Reduce Motion,

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.626 A:middle
and underneath Increase
Contrast,

00:11:04.626 --> 00:11:06.706 A:middle
I've also got Reduced
Transparency

00:11:06.996 --> 00:11:07.906 A:middle
and Darkened Colors.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.376 A:middle
So that way, when we build
and run our app from Xcode,

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:13.986 A:middle
we'll see what a user with
those settings will see.

00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:16.196 A:middle
So now, I'm going to Xcode.

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:20.236 A:middle
I'm going to click
on build and run.

00:11:20.366 --> 00:11:22.966 A:middle
So this is a simple dating app.

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:24.786 A:middle
At the top, you have
the title of the app,

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:25.766 A:middle
which is HelloGoodbye.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:28.536 A:middle
Notice how the title
is very bold,

00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:30.786 A:middle
and the background
is fully opaque.

00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:34.506 A:middle
That's because we're using a
standard navigation controller.

00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:36.056 A:middle
So we get the bold text

00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:38.786 A:middle
and reduced transparency
behaviors for free.

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:42.456 A:middle
But because we're doing
some custom UI in our app,

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:44.346 A:middle
there's still some
work we need to do.

00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:48.526 A:middle
You probably already noticed
how we have transparent overlays

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:49.846 A:middle
over a photo background.

00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:52.566 A:middle
When reduced transparency is on,

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:54.256 A:middle
we should really be
making those opaque.

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:59.126 A:middle
In addition, the text in the
buttons should be thicker

00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.876 A:middle
because we have bold
text enabled.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.876 A:middle
because we have bold
text enabled.

00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:04.896 A:middle
Now I'm going to click
on the Profile button.

00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:08.906 A:middle
So here's where as a user
I can adjust my settings.

00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:12.826 A:middle
Again, we have the transparent
overlay, and the text

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:13.726 A:middle
that should be bolder.

00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:18.026 A:middle
At the bottom of this view,
we have a preview tab,

00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:21.066 A:middle
which I can slide up
to see how other users

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.686 A:middle
in this app will see my profile.

00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:27.046 A:middle
Notice how my info is in gray
text under each of the headings.

00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:30.096 A:middle
When the user has
darkened colors enabled,

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.306 A:middle
it would be better if
that text were darker

00:12:32.776 --> 00:12:35.266 A:middle
to provide higher contrast
against the white background.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:39.646 A:middle
Now, I'm going to click on
Back and I'm going to go

00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:40.976 A:middle
into the Matches page.

00:12:41.286 --> 00:12:44.136 A:middle
So here's where I
can see matches

00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:45.736 A:middle
that the app is suggesting
for me.

00:12:46.006 --> 00:12:48.176 A:middle
And I can say hello or
goodbye to each one.

00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:52.156 A:middle
I like this guy's
elevator pitch,

00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:53.886 A:middle
so I'm going to say hello.

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:58.346 A:middle
And watch what happens
when I swipe up.

00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:01.696 A:middle
Notice how the next
match animates on screen


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:01.696 A:middle
Notice how the next
match animates on screen

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:03.466 A:middle
as though it's coming
from far away.

00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:06.776 A:middle
So that's an example
of an animation

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:09.396 A:middle
where we should provide
an alternate to users

00:13:09.396 --> 00:13:13.836 A:middle
who are more sensitive
to motion.

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:17.786 A:middle
And now, let's do all this,
using the API in Xcode.

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:20.796 A:middle
So the first thing we're
going to address is the text.

00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:23.726 A:middle
Let's make sure that it's
thicker when bold text is on.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.996 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to click
on the Style Utilities file

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:29.066 A:middle
on the left, which is
where all of our colors

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:30.026 A:middle
and fonts are defined.

00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:32.346 A:middle
I'm going to click on
the drop-down at the top,

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:34.716 A:middle
to find our font methods.

00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:40.116 A:middle
Notice how both of these methods
are returning Avenir-Light

00:13:40.116 --> 00:13:41.746 A:middle
as a custom font.

00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:45.356 A:middle
Now, if we were using the system
font, or the preferred font

00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:48.936 A:middle
for text style API, we would
be getting bold text for free.

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:52.516 A:middle
But because we've picked
a specific font to use,

00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.816 A:middle
we also need to pick a font to
use when bold text is enabled.

00:13:55.816 --> 00:14:01.306 A:middle
So to do that, I'd like
to create a helper method,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:55.816 --> 00:14:01.306 A:middle
So to do that, I'd like
to create a helper method,

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:03.806 A:middle
that returns a font name.

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:07.126 A:middle
All we're doing here is first
checking whether bold text

00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:07.736 A:middle
is enabled.

00:14:07.776 --> 00:14:12.506 A:middle
If it is, we can return a
thicker version of our font.

00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:15.206 A:middle
Otherwise, we can return the
same font we've been using.

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:21.666 A:middle
And now, we just need to use our
helper in our 2-font methods.

00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:26.676 A:middle
So that takes care of bold text.

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:29.306 A:middle
Now, let's look at those
transparent overlays.

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:32.936 A:middle
I'm going to click on the
drop-down at the top and find

00:14:32.936 --> 00:14:35.536 A:middle
where that transparent
overlay color is defined.

00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:39.976 A:middle
Notice how right now we're
returning an 80 percent white.

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.556 A:middle
When reduced transparency
is enabled,

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:48.416 A:middle
we should return a 100 percent
white, so we do that here.

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:51.586 A:middle
Okay. Now, let's make
sure that the gray text

00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:55.046 A:middle
in the profile preview is
darker when Darken Colors is on.

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.436 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to
click on the drop-down again,

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.586 A:middle
and find where that
color is defined.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.586 A:middle
and find where that
color is defined.

00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:02.946 A:middle
So here, we're just
returning gray.

00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:07.246 A:middle
Let's first check whether the
user has Darken Colors enabled,

00:15:07.496 --> 00:15:12.716 A:middle
and if so, we can
return black instead.

00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:15.816 A:middle
Finally, let's look at that
zooming animation that we saw

00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:18.066 A:middle
on the Matches page, where
the new match appears

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:19.576 A:middle
as though it's coming
from far away.

00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:22.326 A:middle
To address that,
I'm going to click

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:25.156 A:middle
on the Matches View
Controller on the left.

00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:26.526 A:middle
Now I'm going to
open the drop down,

00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:31.936 A:middle
and find where we
animate the cards.

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:34.966 A:middle
So notice how here we're
zooming the new card into view.

00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:37.746 A:middle
Now, for users who have
Reduce Motion enabled,

00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:41.596 A:middle
a better experience would be
to fade the card into view,

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:45.756 A:middle
because that animation does
not utilize a motion effect.

00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:48.376 A:middle
So I'm going to create
a helper method

00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:50.096 A:middle
that fades the card into view.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.426 A:middle
All we're doing is
setting the alpha

00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:53.956 A:middle
of the card with animation.

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:57.496 A:middle
And then at the point where
normally we would Zoom the card,

00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.336 A:middle
let's first check whether
Reduce Motion is enabled.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.336 A:middle
let's first check whether
Reduce Motion is enabled.

00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:04.656 A:middle
If it is, we use our
fading method instead.

00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:08.236 A:middle
We can use the Zooming
method for other users.

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:11.766 A:middle
Okay, now let's build and run
our app with these changes.

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:16.616 A:middle
Here's our app again.

00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:19.076 A:middle
Notice how the transparent
overlays are gone,

00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:21.036 A:middle
and have been replaced
by opaque white,

00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:22.966 A:middle
because reduced transparency
is enabled.

00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:26.206 A:middle
In addition, the text on
the buttons is much thicker.

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:29.756 A:middle
When I click on Profile, again,

00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:32.776 A:middle
the same issues have
been resolved here.

00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:35.246 A:middle
I can slide up on the View tab,

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:38.836 A:middle
and now notice how my
information is darker

00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:40.916 A:middle
and higher contrast against
the white background.

00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:45.836 A:middle
Now I'm going to click on Back
and click on the Matches button.

00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:49.986 A:middle
Again, I'm going to say
hello to my favorite match,

00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:52.306 A:middle
and watch what happens
when I do that.

00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:55.886 A:middle
The next match fades onto view,

00:16:55.976 --> 00:16:57.716 A:middle
because we have Reduce
Motion enabled.

00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:03.016 A:middle
So that's how easy it is for you
to make visual accommodations

00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:03.016 A:middle
So that's how easy it is for you
to make visual accommodations

00:17:03.016 --> 00:17:06.146 A:middle
in your app for users with
different vision needs.

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.876 A:middle
Next, let's look at implementing
Semantic Accessibility,

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:12.846 A:middle
so that VoiceOver users

00:17:13.506 --> 00:17:16.566 A:middle
and Switch Control users
can also use your app.

00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.675 A:middle
Semantic Accessibility is what
allows an assistive technology

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:26.685 A:middle
like VoiceOver to get
information from an app,

00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:28.566 A:middle
and to control the
app doing things

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.796 A:middle
like tapping buttons
or adjusting sliders.

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:36.926 A:middle
Here's an example of Semantic
Accessibility at work.

00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.056 A:middle
Let's say I've got the
calculator app open

00:17:40.136 --> 00:17:41.266 A:middle
and VoiceOver is enabled.

00:17:41.446 --> 00:17:46.236 A:middle
When I touch on top of the 5
button, VoiceOver intercepts

00:17:46.236 --> 00:17:51.666 A:middle
that touch, and then it asks the
app what it has at that point.

00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:56.136 A:middle
The app responds with an element
that represents the 5 button.

00:17:56.316 --> 00:17:59.756 A:middle
And that allows VoiceOver to
draw a cursor around the 5,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:04.706 A:middle
and to speak 5, so that I
know what I've just touched.

00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:07.136 A:middle
If I then decide to
tap the 5 button,

00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:09.476 A:middle
I can do a double tap
anywhere on screen,

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:12.826 A:middle
and that tells VoiceOver to
activate the selected item.

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:18.286 A:middle
So that's how VoiceOver users
can use the calculator app.

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:25.556 A:middle
So how do you make sure
that your app works

00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:27.396 A:middle
with VoiceOver in
this way as well?

00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:32.256 A:middle
Well, the good news is that
most Semantic Accessibility is

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:35.616 A:middle
already built into iOS, so you
get a lot of stuff for free.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.256 A:middle
But you should still
audit your app

00:18:38.306 --> 00:18:39.666 A:middle
with VoiceOver on the device.

00:18:40.126 --> 00:18:42.376 A:middle
And there are a couple questions
you should ask yourself.

00:18:42.836 --> 00:18:46.446 A:middle
First, can VoiceOver
speak everything

00:18:46.446 --> 00:18:47.286 A:middle
that needs to be seen?

00:18:48.546 --> 00:18:51.066 A:middle
And second, can VoiceOver
do everything

00:18:51.236 --> 00:18:53.576 A:middle
that a user would want to do?

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:56.466 A:middle
Now, I'm going to be referring
a lot to VoiceOver in this talk,

00:18:56.796 --> 00:18:59.426 A:middle
but all of the work we're going
to do in our app also applies

00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.926 A:middle
to Switch Control, so
just keep that in mind.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.926 A:middle
to Switch Control, so
just keep that in mind.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:07.736 A:middle
To set up an audit of your app
for Semantic Accessibility,

00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:10.696 A:middle
I recommend that you go to
your Accessibility settings

00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.446 A:middle
on the device, and set
your accessibility shortcut

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:14.416 A:middle
to VoiceOver.

00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:18.186 A:middle
That will allow you to
triple click the Home button

00:19:18.506 --> 00:19:20.306 A:middle
to quickly enable or
disable VoiceOver.

00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:24.346 A:middle
If you've never used
VoiceOver before,

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.566 A:middle
here are some tips
to get you started.

00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:31.286 A:middle
When you tap something,
that selects and speaks.

00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:33.456 A:middle
So, for example, in this screen,

00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:35.836 A:middle
if I tap on the accessibility
table cell,

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:40.906 A:middle
the cursor moves there, and the
device speaks accessibility.

00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:46.276 A:middle
If I double tap anywhere on
screen, that tells VoiceOver

00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.166 A:middle
to activate the selected item.

00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.016 A:middle
So, in this case, if I did that,

00:19:50.736 --> 00:19:52.716 A:middle
the accessibility table
cell would get pressed,

00:19:53.716 --> 00:19:55.346 A:middle
and we would move to
the accessibility page.

00:19:55.446 --> 00:20:01.406 A:middle
When I swipe to the
right, that selects


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:55.446 --> 00:20:01.406 A:middle
When I swipe to the
right, that selects

00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:02.906 A:middle
and speaks the next element.

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:06.486 A:middle
Right now, the Back button
is selected, so if I swipe

00:20:06.486 --> 00:20:09.486 A:middle
to the right, the Navigation
title becomes selected.

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:13.866 A:middle
And finally, when you
have a scroll view,

00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:16.346 A:middle
you can use three-finger
swipes to scroll.

00:20:17.096 --> 00:20:19.356 A:middle
So if I want to see more of
the accessibility settings,

00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:23.266 A:middle
I can three-finger swipe
up to scroll down by page.

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:28.906 A:middle
So that's all you need
to know to do an audit

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:30.256 A:middle
of your own app with VoiceOver.

00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:32.286 A:middle
And now I'd like to show
you how you can do that,

00:20:32.576 --> 00:20:33.396 A:middle
with our sample app.

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.416 A:middle
So here's our dating app
running on the device.

00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:38.526 A:middle
When I triple click
the home button --

00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:40.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:43.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver becomes enabled.

00:20:43.566 --> 00:20:45.796 A:middle
The first thing we'll do is
ask ourselves that question.

00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:48.396 A:middle
Can VoiceOver speak everything
that needs to be seen?

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:51.716 A:middle
So first, I'm going to tap
on the title at the top.

00:20:52.456 --> 00:20:53.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; HelloGoodbye.

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:54.306 A:middle
Heading.

00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:55.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so VoiceOver
can see that.

00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:57.966 A:middle
Now, let's touch on the
logo [beeping sound].

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.486 A:middle
It's kind of quiet, but that
sound we just heard means


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.486 A:middle
It's kind of quiet, but that
sound we just heard means

00:21:04.486 --> 00:21:06.036 A:middle
that VoiceOver doesn't
think there's anything

00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:06.776 A:middle
under my finger.

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.766 A:middle
So it looks like VoiceOver users
won't be able to read this logo.

00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:13.996 A:middle
Now, I'm going to tap
on the profile button.

00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:15.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile button.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And VoiceOver sees that.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.956 A:middle
When I swipe to the right,
that selects the next element.

00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:20.646 A:middle
So when I do that.

00:21:21.006 --> 00:21:21.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches.

00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:22.136 A:middle
Button.

00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:24.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver finds
the Matches button.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:28.936 A:middle
If I swipe to the right one
more time we hear that sound,

00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:30.786 A:middle
which means there's nothing
else after this element.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.216 A:middle
Which is correct in this case.

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.916 A:middle
So it looks like this view
is in pretty good shape,

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:36.276 A:middle
except for the missing logo.

00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:39.306 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
tap on profile.

00:21:40.176 --> 00:21:41.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile button.

00:21:41.396 --> 00:21:43.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to
double tap to activate it.

00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:46.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile, Profile,
Back, Back button.

00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:48.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's swipe to
the right a few times

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:50.066 A:middle
to see what VoiceOver sees.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:51.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile.

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.846 A:middle
Heading. Your age.

00:21:54.586 --> 00:21:55.476 A:middle
19 percent.

00:21:55.756 --> 00:21:56.276 A:middle
Adjustable.

00:21:57.446 --> 00:21:59.446 A:middle
Swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value.

00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So that was a little strange.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So that was a little strange.

00:22:02.186 --> 00:22:06.076 A:middle
We just heard "your age,"
followed by "19 percent,"

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.886 A:middle
it would make a lot more sense

00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:11.086 A:middle
if VoiceOver said the age
here, which is actually 37.

00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:13.356 A:middle
And the instructions
said to swipe up

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.676 A:middle
or down to adjust the value.

00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:16.496 A:middle
So if I swipe up,
watch what happens.

00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:17.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 28 percent.

00:22:19.146 --> 00:22:20.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My age is jumping
up by 10 years.

00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:23.786 A:middle
So it doesn't look like
VoiceOver users will be able

00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:27.276 A:middle
to set their age accurately
right now in our app.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.326 A:middle
Now, I'm going to swipe to
the right a few more times

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:30.836 A:middle
to see what else VoiceOver sees.

00:22:31.766 --> 00:22:33.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 47. Hobbies.

00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:35.816 A:middle
Music. Swing dance.

00:22:36.096 --> 00:22:37.286 A:middle
Wine. Text field.

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:39.166 A:middle
Double tap to edit.

00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:40.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's make sure

00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.226 A:middle
that VoiceOver users
can edit their hobbies.

00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:44.546 A:middle
So I'm going to double tap.

00:22:44.756 --> 00:22:46.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Text field is editing.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:47.566 A:middle
Music. Swing dance.

00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:48.196 A:middle
Wine.

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:50.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And the keyboard came up.

00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:52.996 A:middle
So that looks like VoiceOver
users will be able to do that.

00:22:53.616 --> 00:22:55.916 A:middle
Let's just make sure that the
Done button, which appeared

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:58.266 A:middle
in the top right, is also
visible to VoiceOver.

00:22:58.466 --> 00:22:59.926 A:middle
So I'll tap on that.

00:22:59.926 --> 00:23:00.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done button.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.926 --> 00:23:00.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done button.

00:23:00.866 --> 00:23:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And it is.

00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:03.686 A:middle
When I double tap.

00:23:04.036 --> 00:23:06.146 A:middle
That takes us out of editing.

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:09.006 A:middle
So it looks like the
hobbies are in good shape.

00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:12.106 A:middle
And the elevator pitch field
is very similar to hobbies,

00:23:12.206 --> 00:23:13.586 A:middle
so we'll skip that for now.

00:23:13.806 --> 00:23:16.806 A:middle
Now I'm going to touch on the
Preview tab at the bottom.

00:23:17.406 --> 00:23:18.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview.

00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:21.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So it's just saying
"preview,"

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:25.826 A:middle
and if I couldn't see the screen
with that visual indication

00:23:25.826 --> 00:23:29.226 A:middle
of a tab, it might not be
clear to me what this does.

00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:32.366 A:middle
I mean, I might try to double
tap it, and so when I do that --

00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:33.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview.

00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:37.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Nothing happens, because this
tab doesn't respond to a tap.

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.646 A:middle
It needs to have a
slide gesture up.

00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:43.396 A:middle
So right now, VoiceOver users
cannot preview their profile.

00:23:43.396 --> 00:23:46.186 A:middle
Now, I'm going to touch
on the back button.

00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:48.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Back. Back button.

00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:49.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And double tap.

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:51.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Beeping sound]
HelloGoodbye, heading.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to tap
on Matches now.

00:23:54.006 --> 00:23:55.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches button.

00:23:55.196 --> 00:23:56.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And double tap.

00:23:56.756 --> 00:23:59.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches, Matches,
Back, Back button.

00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:02.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Again we're going to
swipe to the right a few times


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:02.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Again we're going to
swipe to the right a few times

00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:03.566 A:middle
to see what VoiceOver sees.

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:04.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches.

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:07.936 A:middle
Heading. Swipe up
arrow to say hello,

00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:09.206 A:middle
swipe down arrow to say goodbye.

00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:09.876 A:middle
Ellipses.

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's also
a little strange.

00:24:13.256 --> 00:24:16.926 A:middle
Visually when you look at
this logo, or this label,

00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:19.296 A:middle
you see swipe up to say hello.

00:24:19.786 --> 00:24:22.806 A:middle
But VoiceOver is saying
swipe up arrow to say hello.

00:24:22.866 --> 00:24:24.726 A:middle
And that's because
VoiceOver is reading each

00:24:24.726 --> 00:24:26.046 A:middle
of those characters literally.

00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:29.236 A:middle
So it would be better if
VoiceOver described this

00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:30.216 A:middle
in a more natural way.

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.546 A:middle
Now, let's swipe to the
right to get to the photo.

00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:34.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Age.

00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:36.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Except we didn't
get to the photo.

00:24:37.096 --> 00:24:40.956 A:middle
So now let's try touching it
directly [beeping sounds].

00:24:41.356 --> 00:24:43.646 A:middle
And again, I get that sound,

00:24:43.646 --> 00:24:45.636 A:middle
which means VoiceOver doesn't
think there's a photo there.

00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:50.556 A:middle
Now, some of you might be
wondering whether that's

00:24:50.556 --> 00:24:51.256 A:middle
even important.

00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:55.376 A:middle
Because after all, a VoiceOver
user doesn't see the photo,

00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:55.626 A:middle
right?

00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.686 A:middle
But it turns out
it is important,

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.536 A:middle
so for a couple of reasons.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.536 A:middle
so for a couple of reasons.

00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:05.396 A:middle
First, if I'm a VoiceOver user,
using this app, I need to know

00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:08.716 A:middle
that other people in this
app can see my photo.

00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:11.146 A:middle
Even if I don't take full
advantage of the photo,

00:25:11.486 --> 00:25:13.676 A:middle
it's important to
know that it's there.

00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:14.976 A:middle
And second, remember

00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
that Semantic Accessibility
is not just about VoiceOver.

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:18.876 A:middle
So it's always a good idea

00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:22.146 A:middle
to expose any meaningful
info from your app.

00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:25.406 A:middle
Okay, now I'm going
to touch on age again.

00:25:25.816 --> 00:25:25.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Age.

00:25:26.056 --> 00:25:30.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to swipe
to the right a few times.

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:31.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hobbies.

00:25:31.986 --> 00:25:33.646 A:middle
32. Cooking.

00:25:33.856 --> 00:25:34.676 A:middle
Bubble tea with friends.

00:25:34.936 --> 00:25:35.266 A:middle
Travel.

00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:38.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you're paying
close attention,

00:25:38.226 --> 00:25:41.346 A:middle
you may have noticed how
VoiceOver went from age

00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:43.786 A:middle
to hobbies, and then back to 32.

00:25:44.716 --> 00:25:46.796 A:middle
So when you're looking
at the visual layout

00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:49.336 A:middle
of this profile card, it's
clear what this means,

00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:53.066 A:middle
but VoiceOver users
are often swiping

00:25:53.196 --> 00:25:55.636 A:middle
to visit different elements,
because that can be easier

00:25:55.636 --> 00:25:57.956 A:middle
than touching exactly
where an element is.

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.316 A:middle
And so it's important
to have a logical order


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.316 A:middle
And so it's important
to have a logical order

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:03.276 A:middle
for how these elements
are visited.

00:26:03.716 --> 00:26:06.316 A:middle
It's also important for
Switch Control users.

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:10.036 A:middle
The Switch Control cursor
will move from element

00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:11.576 A:middle
to element in the same order.

00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:14.846 A:middle
And it's important for that
order to be predictable,

00:26:14.846 --> 00:26:17.236 A:middle
so that a Switch Control user
can activate their switch

00:26:17.236 --> 00:26:18.126 A:middle
at the right time.

00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:24.416 A:middle
Okay. So last thing, remember
that our second question was

00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:26.416 A:middle
"Can VoiceOver do
everything that needs

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:29.076 A:middle
to be done in this app?"

00:26:29.596 --> 00:26:33.016 A:middle
The point of the Matches page
is to allow users to say hello

00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.506 A:middle
or goodbye to their matches.

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:38.716 A:middle
But VoiceOver users won't be
able to do this right now,

00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:43.026 A:middle
because swipe gestures get
intercepted by VoiceOver,

00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:44.766 A:middle
and we'll need to
provide a different way

00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:47.036 A:middle
for VoiceOver users to
do the same actions.

00:26:47.036 --> 00:26:50.026 A:middle
So that's the kind of process
you can take with your own app

00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.516 A:middle
to see whether it is
semantically accessible.

00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:56.326 A:middle
Now, let's look at resolving
those issues we encountered.

00:26:57.646 --> 00:26:59.486 A:middle
First, I'm going to
introduce the most basic

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:00.336 A:middle
accessibility API.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:00.336 A:middle
accessibility API.

00:27:01.046 --> 00:27:02.696 A:middle
There are only 2
properties here,

00:27:03.036 --> 00:27:04.896 A:middle
and if you remember
nothing else from this talk,

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.476 A:middle
please remember these 2.

00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:09.816 A:middle
Just by using these 2
properties, you can solve a lot

00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:11.046 A:middle
of accessibility issues.

00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:14.476 A:middle
The most important
property you need

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:17.606 A:middle
to know is the
isAccessibilityElement property.

00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.366 A:middle
This is a Boolean

00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:22.286 A:middle
that determines whether a
view is visible to VoiceOver.

00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:26.876 A:middle
By default, it returns yes
for standard UIKit controls

00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:29.376 A:middle
and labels, which is why even
though we haven't done any

00:27:29.376 --> 00:27:31.566 A:middle
Semantic Accessibility
work in our app yet,

00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:34.396 A:middle
a lot of the text is
already visible to VoiceOver.

00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:38.626 A:middle
And the second-most
important property you need

00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:41.376 A:middle
to know is the
accessibilityLabel property.

00:27:41.956 --> 00:27:45.066 A:middle
This describes a view, and
VoiceOver will speak this

00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.616 A:middle
when a VoiceOver user
touches on a view.

00:27:48.196 --> 00:27:53.146 A:middle
If you're creating your
views in Interface Builder,

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.616 A:middle
you can set these properties
directly from Xcode's UI.

00:27:56.146 --> 00:27:58.026 A:middle
On the right-hand side of Xcode,

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.306 A:middle
you'll find an identity
inspector.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.306 A:middle
you'll find an identity
inspector.

00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:02.666 A:middle
And there's an accessibility
section there.

00:28:02.946 --> 00:28:06.706 A:middle
The Accessibility enable
check box corresponds

00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:11.636 A:middle
to isAccessibilityElement and
the label field corresponds

00:28:11.636 --> 00:28:12.706 A:middle
to accessibilityLabel.

00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:18.506 A:middle
If you're creating your views
in code, it's still really easy

00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:20.846 A:middle
to set these properties
as shown here.

00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:26.616 A:middle
So now let's look at
using these two properties

00:28:26.796 --> 00:28:30.556 A:middle
and see how much more
accessible we can make our app.

00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:32.916 A:middle
So the first thing we're
going to do is make sure

00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:35.746 A:middle
that VoiceOver users can read
the logo on the first page.

00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:41.836 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to go
click on the StartViewController

00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:44.766 A:middle
on the left, which is
where we create that logo.

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:46.906 A:middle
So I'm going to click
on the drop-down

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:49.016 A:middle
and find our viewDidLoad method.

00:28:49.556 --> 00:28:51.336 A:middle
So here's the logo.

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.916 A:middle
It's just an image
view right now.

00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:56.976 A:middle
And first we're going to set
isAccessibilityElement to yes,

00:28:57.516 --> 00:28:58.676 A:middle
so that VoiceOver can see it.

00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.136 A:middle
And then we also need to make
sure VoiceOver describes it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.136 A:middle
And then we also need to make
sure VoiceOver describes it

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:04.996 A:middle
correctly, so we give it
an accessibilityLabel.

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:06.896 A:middle
In this case, we're just going

00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.996 A:middle
to give it the text
that's inside the logo.

00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:12.176 A:middle
Notice also that we're
localizing the string,

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.956 A:middle
because VoiceOver
speaks in many languages.

00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:20.646 A:middle
Next, let's make sure
that the photo that's

00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:23.426 A:middle
in the profile card can
also be seen by VoiceOver.

00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:26.016 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to click

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.476 A:middle
on the card view
clef on the left.

00:29:28.406 --> 00:29:30.396 A:middle
And I'm going to open
the drop-down to find

00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:32.136 A:middle
where we add our ProfileViews.

00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:34.936 A:middle
So here's where we're
adding the photo.

00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:37.886 A:middle
Again, we set
isAccessibilityElement to yes,

00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:41.426 A:middle
and we give it an
appropriate accessibilityLabel.

00:29:41.806 --> 00:29:45.136 A:middle
In this case, we're just going
to call it profile photo.

00:29:46.776 --> 00:29:50.046 A:middle
Finally, let's look
at the instructions

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:51.166 A:middle
for saying hello or goodbye.

00:29:51.826 --> 00:29:55.366 A:middle
Right now, VoiceOver is saying
swipe up arrow to say hello.

00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:57.426 A:middle
Let's fix that.

00:29:57.426 --> 00:29:59.016 A:middle
So to do that, I'm
going to click

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:02.076 A:middle
on the Matches View Controller
on the left, and we're going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:02.076 A:middle
on the Matches View Controller
on the left, and we're going

00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:04.716 A:middle
to open the drop-down
at the top to find

00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:06.916 A:middle
where we add those
swiping instructions.

00:30:08.226 --> 00:30:10.866 A:middle
So here's a label that
says those instructions.

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.476 A:middle
It's already in
accessibilityElement by default,

00:30:14.786 --> 00:30:17.286 A:middle
so all we need to do is change
the accessibility label.

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.596 A:middle
We're going to give it one
that is just like the text

00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:23.776 A:middle
on the label, except we're
replacing those unicode arrows

00:30:24.306 --> 00:30:25.106 A:middle
with words.

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:34.246 A:middle
Now I'm going to build and run
the app with these changes.

00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:35.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Beeping sound]
Extras folder.

00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:39.896 A:middle
Two apps. Double tap to
open [beeping sound].

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:40.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; HelloGoodbye.

00:30:41.566 --> 00:30:42.276 A:middle
Extras folder.

00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:49.686 A:middle
Two apps. Double tap to open.

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:50.346 A:middle
Hello goodbye [beeping sound].

00:30:50.536 --> 00:30:54.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So here's our app
again with these changes.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:57.296 A:middle
The first thing I'm going
to do is touch the logo.

00:30:57.916 --> 00:30:58.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; HelloGoodbye.

00:30:58.886 --> 00:30:59.506 A:middle
Meet your match.

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:00.146 A:middle
Image.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:00.146 A:middle
Image.

00:31:00.956 --> 00:31:02.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So now VoiceOver
users can read this.

00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:06.026 A:middle
Next, I'm going to touch
on the Matches button.

00:31:06.446 --> 00:31:07.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches button.

00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:09.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And double tap.

00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:12.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Beeping sound]
Matches, Back, Back button.

00:31:12.726 --> 00:31:15.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's first look at what
the instructions say right now.

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:17.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Swipe up to say hello.

00:31:17.556 --> 00:31:18.616 A:middle
Swipe down to say goodbye.

00:31:19.206 --> 00:31:21.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's much
easier to understand.

00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:23.356 A:middle
And now when I swipe
to the right.

00:31:24.026 --> 00:31:25.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile photo, image.

00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver is able to see
the photo in the profile.

00:31:29.276 --> 00:31:32.786 A:middle
So that's how, even with
just these two properties,

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:35.356 A:middle
you've already made other
parts of our app accessible.

00:31:35.846 --> 00:31:40.386 A:middle
But because we've got some
more custom UI in our app,

00:31:40.386 --> 00:31:42.446 A:middle
there's some additional
API we'll need to use

00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:44.896 A:middle
to give VoiceOver users a
really great experience.

00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:51.076 A:middle
First, I'd like to introduce the
concept of Accessibility Traits.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:53.736 A:middle
Traits describe the
function of a view.

00:31:54.986 --> 00:31:58.726 A:middle
For example, in the familiar
timer app, each of the wheels

00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.846 A:middle
of time has a trait
of adjustable.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.846 A:middle
of time has a trait
of adjustable.

00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:05.656 A:middle
And that means that its value
can be changed up or down.

00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:09.296 A:middle
The Start button has
a trait of button.

00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:12.286 A:middle
And that gives the user a
hint that this is something

00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:13.226 A:middle
that can be activated.

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:19.236 A:middle
Again, if you're creating your
views in Interface Builder,

00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:22.316 A:middle
it's really easy to set these
traits directly from Xcode's UI.

00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:24.846 A:middle
In the same section we
talked about earlier,

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:27.456 A:middle
you'll see a bunch of
check boxes for traits.

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:30.066 A:middle
Some of these check boxes
may already be checked,

00:32:30.446 --> 00:32:33.316 A:middle
in which case I would generally
recommend leaving those alone,

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.776 A:middle
but add check boxes
next to traits

00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:37.516 A:middle
that you think are
important for your view.

00:32:38.086 --> 00:32:42.496 A:middle
In code, it's also
straightforward

00:32:42.766 --> 00:32:44.136 A:middle
to set the Accessibility Traits.

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:47.476 A:middle
But just remember that it is
a bit mask, so if you want

00:32:47.576 --> 00:32:50.766 A:middle
to add a trait in addition
to others, use a bitwise

00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:54.716 A:middle
or operator, as shown
here, to combine them.

00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.326 A:middle
Next, let's talk about
Accessibility Value.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.326 A:middle
Next, let's talk about
Accessibility Value.

00:33:00.816 --> 00:33:04.316 A:middle
Accessibility Value is a string
on properties, so in that way,

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:06.116 A:middle
it's similar to accessibility
label.

00:33:06.706 --> 00:33:08.506 A:middle
Except you use Accessibility
Value

00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:09.726 A:middle
for things that are dynamic.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:12.846 A:middle
For example, you
use this on views

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:16.056 A:middle
that have the adjustable trait
to describe the numerical value.

00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:21.006 A:middle
Right now, in our app, the age
slider has an Accessibility

00:33:21.006 --> 00:33:22.706 A:middle
Value of 19 percent.

00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:26.426 A:middle
So that's a case where we can
override Accessibility Value

00:33:26.726 --> 00:33:28.116 A:middle
to return the age instead.

00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:33.796 A:middle
Next, we'll talk about actions.

00:33:34.046 --> 00:33:38.236 A:middle
So actions are how VoiceOver
can control your app.

00:33:38.486 --> 00:33:42.356 A:middle
Two really common ones are the
Increment and Decrement actions.

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:45.196 A:middle
So these are actions that
are associated specifically

00:33:45.376 --> 00:33:47.096 A:middle
for views that have
the adjustable trait.

00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:49.556 A:middle
And they allow the
user to increase

00:33:49.556 --> 00:33:51.276 A:middle
or decrease an element's value.

00:33:51.736 --> 00:33:56.146 A:middle
So again, in our app, the
age slider right now can be

00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.476 A:middle
incremented or decremented,

00:33:57.716 --> 00:33:59.676 A:middle
but right now it's
doing that by 10 years.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.786 --> 00:34:03.726 A:middle
We can override these
methods to allow the user

00:34:03.726 --> 00:34:05.316 A:middle
to change their age
by a single year.

00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:12.076 A:middle
Another really important
action is the Activate action,

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.186 A:middle
and that's what happens
when a user double taps.

00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:16.866 A:middle
Normally, when you
double tap something,

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:18.045 A:middle
that just taps the view.

00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:21.815 A:middle
But you can override this
method on views that respond

00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:24.916 A:middle
to a specific gesture, and
that way VoiceOver users can do

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.366 A:middle
that action as well easily.

00:34:26.806 --> 00:34:29.726 A:middle
For example, in our app, we can
use this for the Preview tab,

00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.436 A:middle
which currently only
responds to a sliding gesture.

00:34:32.866 --> 00:34:38.156 A:middle
And finally, we have
notifications,

00:34:38.335 --> 00:34:40.025 A:middle
which allow your app
to tell VoiceOver

00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:41.056 A:middle
when something has changed.

00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:43.985 A:middle
One really important
notification is

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:45.485 A:middle
the LayoutChangeNotification.

00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:50.576 A:middle
You should send this when you're
changing the layout of your app,

00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:52.326 A:middle
for example, adding
or removing views.

00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:55.616 A:middle
For example, in our
app right now,

00:34:55.616 --> 00:34:59.866 A:middle
when you reveal the preview,
VoiceOver might not realize

00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:02.986 A:middle
that new elements
have come on screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:02.986 A:middle
that new elements
have come on screen.

00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:06.616 A:middle
Once you post a layout change
notification, VoiceOver checks

00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:09.386 A:middle
to find the elements
that are there currently.

00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:15.766 A:middle
Now, let's put all this
together in our sample app

00:35:15.766 --> 00:35:17.876 A:middle
to resolve some more of
those issues we encountered.

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:19.906 A:middle
So the first thing we're
going to do is make sure

00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:22.446 A:middle
that VoiceOver users
can edit their age.

00:35:23.466 --> 00:35:26.466 A:middle
To do that, I'm going
to go to Xcode and click

00:35:26.466 --> 00:35:30.866 A:middle
on the AgeSlider
class on the left.

00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:33.166 A:middle
Here let's override
accessibilityValue,

00:35:33.326 --> 00:35:36.906 A:middle
and that way we can return the
age instead of a percentage.

00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:39.806 A:middle
All we're doing is taking
the value of the slider,

00:35:39.886 --> 00:35:45.016 A:middle
which corresponds to the age,
and making it into a string.

00:35:45.136 --> 00:35:48.096 A:middle
Next, let's make sure that
VoiceOver users can add

00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.776 A:middle
or remove to their
age by a single year.

00:35:52.626 --> 00:35:55.266 A:middle
So to do that, let's override
accessibilityIncrement.

00:35:56.196 --> 00:35:59.066 A:middle
All we're doing here is adding
1 to the slider's value.

00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:02.286 A:middle
We also send the Value
Change Control Event,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:02.286 A:middle
We also send the Value
Change Control Event,

00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:05.396 A:middle
that way other parts
of our UI that rely

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.636 A:middle
on the slider's value
can update accordingly.

00:36:08.236 --> 00:36:12.576 A:middle
We do the same thing for
accessibilityDecrement.

00:36:13.026 --> 00:36:16.146 A:middle
And now, one nuance to this.

00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:21.296 A:middle
After these changes, our age
slider has all the information

00:36:21.296 --> 00:36:22.386 A:middle
that the user needs to know.

00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:23.896 A:middle
Namely, the user's age.

00:36:24.856 --> 00:36:27.206 A:middle
So from a Semantic
Accessibility standpoint,

00:36:27.806 --> 00:36:31.236 A:middle
that label that's showing up
next to the slider is redundant,

00:36:31.676 --> 00:36:33.186 A:middle
and might even be confusing.

00:36:34.086 --> 00:36:36.126 A:middle
So let's just hide it.

00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:40.136 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to click
on the Profile View Controller

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:43.586 A:middle
on the left, and open
the drop-down to find

00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:45.006 A:middle
where we add that label.

00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:54.546 A:middle
To hide it, we simply set
isAccessibilityElement to no.

00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:56.656 A:middle
Okay. Next, let's make sure

00:36:56.656 --> 00:36:58.956 A:middle
that VoiceOver users can
preview their profiles.

00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:03.746 A:middle
To do that, let's go
in Xcode and click


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:03.746 A:middle
To do that, let's go
in Xcode and click

00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:06.246 A:middle
on our PreviewLabel class.

00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:08.496 A:middle
So here's our roadmap for this.

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:11.666 A:middle
We're going to override
accessibilityActivate

00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:14.626 A:middle
on the Preview Label, so that
we can control what happens

00:37:14.626 --> 00:37:16.166 A:middle
when the user double taps.

00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:18.866 A:middle
But we need to tell the
Profile View Controller

00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:20.446 A:middle
to show or hide the preview.

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:23.526 A:middle
So we'll need a way
to communicate that.

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:27.446 A:middle
To do that, let's set
up a delegate protocol.

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:31.126 A:middle
And all this delegate
protocol has is a single method

00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.606 A:middle
that we're going to call when
the label gets activated.

00:37:33.956 --> 00:37:37.336 A:middle
Of course, we also set
up a delegate property

00:37:37.786 --> 00:37:40.486 A:middle
so that the View Controller
can set itself a delegate.

00:37:40.486 --> 00:37:43.906 A:middle
Now let's go to the
implementation file.

00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:48.886 A:middle
Here we're going to override
accessibilityActivate.

00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:52.376 A:middle
All we're doing is
letting the delegate know

00:37:52.586 --> 00:37:56.086 A:middle
that the label was activated,
and we return yes to indicate

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.076 A:middle
that the action succeeded.

00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:02.836 A:middle
While we're here, let's
also add a button trait


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:02.836 A:middle
While we're here, let's
also add a button trait

00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:06.786 A:middle
to the Preview Label, and that
way VoiceOver users will have a

00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:10.316 A:middle
hint that they can
double tap to activate it.

00:38:10.856 --> 00:38:13.476 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to
override accessibilityTraits,

00:38:14.576 --> 00:38:16.476 A:middle
and first recalling super,

00:38:16.706 --> 00:38:18.276 A:middle
to get any traits we
would have by default.

00:38:19.106 --> 00:38:22.846 A:middle
Then we use the bitwise
or operator to combine

00:38:22.846 --> 00:38:23.776 A:middle
that with a button trait.

00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:29.556 A:middle
Okay. Now, let's go back to
our Profile View Controller,

00:38:30.046 --> 00:38:31.536 A:middle
to implement the
delegate protocol.

00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:35.256 A:middle
So first, I'm going to scroll
to the top of the file,

00:38:36.386 --> 00:38:38.716 A:middle
and declare that this
view controller implements

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:39.286 A:middle
that protocol.

00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:45.336 A:middle
Next, I'm going to open the
drop down and find where we add

00:38:45.336 --> 00:38:47.376 A:middle
that Preview Label to the view.

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:52.726 A:middle
Here we set the View
Controller as its delegate.

00:38:53.806 --> 00:38:55.706 A:middle
And finally, let's
implement that protocol.

00:38:55.976 --> 00:39:01.736 A:middle
I'm going to scroll
to the bottom.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:55.976 --> 00:39:01.736 A:middle
I'm going to scroll
to the bottom.

00:39:01.886 --> 00:39:04.426 A:middle
And here we've implemented the
only delegate protocol method

00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:04.696 A:middle
we have.

00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:08.046 A:middle
So when the Preview
Label is activated,

00:39:08.626 --> 00:39:11.116 A:middle
we'll first check whether the
preview is currently showing.

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:12.896 A:middle
If it is, we can hide it.

00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:15.866 A:middle
Otherwise, we reveal it.

00:39:16.956 --> 00:39:18.366 A:middle
One additional thing.

00:39:19.006 --> 00:39:21.376 A:middle
Recall that when you
hide or show the preview,

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:23.206 A:middle
you're changing the
layout of the screen.

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.556 A:middle
So we should tell VoiceOver
that that's happened.

00:39:26.496 --> 00:39:28.616 A:middle
To do that, let's go
to the implementation

00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:30.926 A:middle
of reveal card and dismiss card.

00:39:31.216 --> 00:39:32.726 A:middle
So I'm going to click on
the drop down of the top

00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:34.426 A:middle
and find those two methods.

00:39:35.036 --> 00:39:39.126 A:middle
Both of these methods
are animating the card

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:39.986 A:middle
on or off screen.

00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:42.516 A:middle
In the completion
for that animation,

00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:45.266 A:middle
we post the layout
change notification.

00:39:45.726 --> 00:39:47.496 A:middle
Let's do the same
thing down here

00:39:47.496 --> 00:39:51.746 A:middle
when dismissing the preview.

00:39:52.196 --> 00:39:52.296 A:middle
Okay.

00:39:53.176 --> 00:39:54.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now let's build
and run our app

00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:57.906 A:middle
with these changes
[beeping sound].

00:39:58.706 --> 00:39:59.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; HelloGoodbye.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.486 --> 00:40:02.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Double tap to open.

00:40:02.696 --> 00:40:03.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [beeping sound].

00:40:03.426 --> 00:40:04.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Extras folder.

00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:06.896 A:middle
Two apps. Double tap to open.

00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:07.816 A:middle
HelloGoodbye.

00:40:07.816 --> 00:40:10.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here we are in
the app with our changes.

00:40:10.686 --> 00:40:12.446 A:middle
First I'm going to tap
on the profile button.

00:40:12.976 --> 00:40:14.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile button.

00:40:14.556 --> 00:40:16.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to
double tap to activate.

00:40:16.546 --> 00:40:19.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile, Profile,
Back, Back button.

00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:21.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; First, let's touch
on the age slider.

00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:24.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 37. Adjustable.

00:40:25.346 --> 00:40:27.456 A:middle
Swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value.

00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So notice how
that's much clearer.

00:40:30.216 --> 00:40:32.966 A:middle
We're actually seeing the
age now, and when I swipe

00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:34.096 A:middle
up to adjust the value.

00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:35.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 38.

00:40:35.696 --> 00:40:36.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It goes up by a single year.

00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:39.326 A:middle
When I swipe to the right --

00:40:40.136 --> 00:40:40.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hobbies.

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:42.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Notice how we've skipped

00:40:42.276 --> 00:40:44.006 A:middle
over that redundant
label to the right.

00:40:44.516 --> 00:40:47.566 A:middle
Now, I'm going to touch
on the preview tab.

00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:49.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview button.

00:40:50.146 --> 00:40:52.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So this time, because
it says it's a button,

00:40:52.556 --> 00:40:54.246 A:middle
I know I can do something
with this.

00:40:54.346 --> 00:40:55.186 A:middle
So I'm going to double tap.

00:40:56.216 --> 00:40:56.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview.

00:40:56.816 --> 00:40:59.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And notice how
the preview appears.

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.256 A:middle
So when I swipe to the right.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.256 A:middle
So when I swipe to the right.

00:41:00.576 --> 00:41:01.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile photo.

00:41:01.776 --> 00:41:02.116 A:middle
Image.

00:41:02.206 --> 00:41:04.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can see stuff
inside the preview.

00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:06.586 A:middle
If I tap on preview again --

00:41:07.076 --> 00:41:08.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview button.

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:08.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And double tap.

00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:10.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Preview.

00:41:10.686 --> 00:41:12.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That hides the preview, so
when I swipe to the right now,

00:41:13.036 --> 00:41:16.296 A:middle
I hear that sound,
VoiceOver knows

00:41:16.296 --> 00:41:17.766 A:middle
that the preview
has gone off screen.

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:21.376 A:middle
So that's how we can make
even custom UI accessible

00:41:21.376 --> 00:41:21.986 A:middle
to VoiceOver.

00:41:24.516 --> 00:41:27.746 A:middle
To resolve the last remaining
issues we encountered during our

00:41:27.746 --> 00:41:30.926 A:middle
audit, we're going to use some
new API we've added in iOS 8.

00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:36.636 A:middle
First, let's talk about the
UIAccessibilityContainer

00:41:36.636 --> 00:41:37.126 A:middle
protocol.

00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:40.286 A:middle
Some of you may already
realize that that isn't new,

00:41:40.386 --> 00:41:43.896 A:middle
but we've updated it in iOS 8
to make it much easier to use.

00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.676 A:middle
For those who aren't
familiar with this protocol,

00:41:47.516 --> 00:41:50.536 A:middle
UIAccessibilityContainer
is a way to return a list

00:41:50.536 --> 00:41:52.276 A:middle
of accessibility
elements from a view.

00:41:53.086 --> 00:41:56.156 A:middle
You'll need to do this
if you have elements

00:41:56.156 --> 00:41:57.656 A:middle
that don't correspond to views.

00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:02.086 A:middle
For example, you might have
a view with a drawing in it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:02.086 A:middle
For example, you might have
a view with a drawing in it,

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:03.706 A:middle
and you might want
different parts of the drawing

00:42:03.906 --> 00:42:05.746 A:middle
to be separate accessibility
elements.

00:42:06.366 --> 00:42:08.926 A:middle
In that case, you would create
an accessibility element

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.196 A:middle
for each part of the drawing,

00:42:10.646 --> 00:42:13.936 A:middle
and return those elements using
the UIAccessibilityContainer

00:42:13.936 --> 00:42:14.456 A:middle
protocol.

00:42:15.106 --> 00:42:18.646 A:middle
And you can see last year's
talk, for a great example of how

00:42:18.646 --> 00:42:20.466 A:middle
to create your own elements.

00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:23.356 A:middle
But what many people
don't realize is

00:42:23.356 --> 00:42:25.436 A:middle
that this protocol
is also a great way

00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:28.266 A:middle
to return existing elements
in a specific order.

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:32.566 A:middle
So for example, if
VoiceOver is navigating things

00:42:32.736 --> 00:42:35.156 A:middle
in a different order
from what we want,

00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:38.266 A:middle
we can use this protocol
to return those elements

00:42:38.446 --> 00:42:41.916 A:middle
in the order that we want
VoiceOver to see them.

00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:47.076 A:middle
And now for what's changed.

00:42:47.246 --> 00:42:49.896 A:middle
So currently, in order
to use this protocol,

00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.836 A:middle
there are three methods
you need to override.

00:42:53.276 --> 00:42:57.746 A:middle
In iOS 8, there's a
single property called

00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.966 A:middle
accessibilityElements, which
you can set to return a list


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.966 A:middle
accessibilityElements, which
you can set to return a list

00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:04.436 A:middle
of those elements, and
notice how now you don't need

00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:07.536 A:middle
to override subclass, and
you don't have to deal

00:43:07.536 --> 00:43:08.606 A:middle
with three separate methods.

00:43:08.846 --> 00:43:11.706 A:middle
So we think people are going to
find that much easier to use.

00:43:11.706 --> 00:43:12.466 A:middle
[Applause]Thank you.

00:43:13.166 --> 00:43:20.046 A:middle
Okay next up we're
introducing a new class called

00:43:20.046 --> 00:43:20.946 A:middle
the CustomAction.

00:43:21.436 --> 00:43:24.706 A:middle
You should use CustomActions
when you have more

00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:26.926 A:middle
than one action for an element.

00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:30.176 A:middle
For example, in the
app switcher,

00:43:30.176 --> 00:43:32.546 A:middle
each of the app thumbnails
can either be tapped

00:43:33.256 --> 00:43:38.206 A:middle
to launch the app, or you can
slide it up to close the app.

00:43:38.456 --> 00:43:41.506 A:middle
And so we expose a CustomAction
for closing the app,

00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:44.526 A:middle
and that way VoiceOver users
can do that action easily

00:43:44.776 --> 00:43:46.356 A:middle
without needing to do
the sliding gesture.

00:43:46.356 --> 00:43:50.706 A:middle
In our sample app, we
can also use this API

00:43:51.306 --> 00:43:53.566 A:middle
to allow VoiceOver
users to say hello

00:43:53.566 --> 00:43:54.856 A:middle
or goodbye to their matches.

00:43:55.396 --> 00:44:00.216 A:middle
The custom matching
class looks like this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:55.396 --> 00:44:00.216 A:middle
The custom matching
class looks like this.

00:44:00.816 --> 00:44:03.436 A:middle
You create a custom
action object with a name

00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
that VoiceOver uses
to describe it.

00:44:06.206 --> 00:44:08.426 A:middle
And you also give it a
target and a selector,

00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:11.116 A:middle
so similar to what you
would pass to a UI button.

00:44:11.396 --> 00:44:14.236 A:middle
And that determines what happens
when the action is performed.

00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:18.446 A:middle
Once you've created all of
your CustomAction objects,

00:44:19.106 --> 00:44:20.946 A:middle
you can assign them
to a view using the

00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:23.666 A:middle
accessibilityCustomActions
array property.

00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:30.196 A:middle
So now, let's use this in our
app to fix the remaining issues.

00:44:30.796 --> 00:44:33.406 A:middle
First, what we're going
to do is make sure

00:44:33.406 --> 00:44:35.656 A:middle
that VoiceOver navigates
the views

00:44:35.816 --> 00:44:38.226 A:middle
in the profile card
in the correct order.

00:44:38.816 --> 00:44:40.496 A:middle
Namely, we don't want
it to go from age

00:44:40.496 --> 00:44:42.106 A:middle
to hobbies and back to 32.

00:44:42.106 --> 00:44:49.506 A:middle
So to fix that, let's click on
the card view class on the left.

00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:51.846 A:middle
Here's our method where we
add all the profile views.

00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:53.526 A:middle
When I scroll to the bottom,

00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:57.436 A:middle
after all of our subviews
have been created,

00:44:57.916 --> 00:45:00.266 A:middle
we can set the
accessibilityElement property


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.916 --> 00:45:00.266 A:middle
we can set the
accessibilityElement property

00:45:00.266 --> 00:45:03.516 A:middle
of our card view to an
array of its subviews

00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:04.946 A:middle
in the order you
want them to appear.

00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:09.756 A:middle
Notice how I put the age title
right next to the age value.

00:45:11.496 --> 00:45:14.036 A:middle
Whoops. Okay.

00:45:14.576 --> 00:45:19.176 A:middle
Next let's make sure that
VoiceOver users can say hello

00:45:19.176 --> 00:45:20.236 A:middle
or goodbye to their matches.

00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.576 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to click

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:26.266 A:middle
on the Matches View
Controller on the left.

00:45:26.636 --> 00:45:29.856 A:middle
First, let's find out what we're
doing when a user swipes up

00:45:29.856 --> 00:45:31.676 A:middle
or down without VoiceOver
enabled.

00:45:31.946 --> 00:45:34.656 A:middle
So I'm going to click
on the drop down

00:45:34.916 --> 00:45:37.756 A:middle
and find our swipe gesture
recognizer handlers.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.686 A:middle
So both of these handlers
are simply calling

00:45:41.686 --> 00:45:44.976 A:middle
in to methods called say
hello and say goodbye,

00:45:45.486 --> 00:45:47.826 A:middle
which are implemented
right above.

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:52.056 A:middle
These methods are also great
candidates for the selector

00:45:52.056 --> 00:45:54.776 A:middle
that we pass to the
CustomAction objects.

00:45:55.646 --> 00:45:58.046 A:middle
The only thing we'll need
to change is make sure

00:45:58.046 --> 00:45:59.406 A:middle
that they return Booleans

00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:01.406 A:middle
to indicate whether
the action succeeded.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:01.406 A:middle
to indicate whether
the action succeeded.

00:46:01.906 --> 00:46:04.526 A:middle
In most cases, you
can just return yes.

00:46:05.436 --> 00:46:06.646 A:middle
Oh, one more thing.

00:46:07.746 --> 00:46:11.436 A:middle
When you say hello or goodbye
to a match, the layout changes.

00:46:12.026 --> 00:46:14.656 A:middle
So again, we're going to post
a layout change notification.

00:46:15.326 --> 00:46:17.006 A:middle
Both of these methods
are calling

00:46:17.006 --> 00:46:19.566 A:middle
in to a helper called
animateCardsForHello,

00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:21.526 A:middle
which is implemented
right above.

00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:26.186 A:middle
So in the completion
for this animation,

00:46:27.396 --> 00:46:29.686 A:middle
we should post our
layoutChangedNotification.

00:46:30.216 --> 00:46:32.756 A:middle
Okay. So that's all
the setup we need.

00:46:33.116 --> 00:46:35.326 A:middle
Now, let's create those
CustomAction objects.

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:40.406 A:middle
I'm going to click on the
drop down at the top and find

00:46:40.406 --> 00:46:42.596 A:middle
where we add the card
to the Matches page.

00:46:42.706 --> 00:46:45.946 A:middle
So here's where we're
creating the card,

00:46:47.036 --> 00:46:50.566 A:middle
and we're assigning swipe
gesture recognizers to it.

00:46:51.796 --> 00:46:53.886 A:middle
Alongside those swipe
gesture recognizers,

00:46:54.226 --> 00:46:55.846 A:middle
let's now create
our CustomActions.

00:46:56.306 --> 00:46:58.466 A:middle
First, I'm going to create
an action for saying hello.

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:02.566 A:middle
So here's how that looks.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:02.566 A:middle
So here's how that looks.

00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:05.936 A:middle
We give it a name, which in
this case is simply say hello.

00:47:06.746 --> 00:47:10.906 A:middle
We pass in the View Controller
as a target, and as a selector,

00:47:10.906 --> 00:47:13.036 A:middle
we pass in the method
that we just modified

00:47:13.036 --> 00:47:13.916 A:middle
to return a Boolean.

00:47:14.516 --> 00:47:17.646 A:middle
We do the same thing
for saying goodbye.

00:47:18.306 --> 00:47:22.476 A:middle
And now, we want the user
to be able to say hello

00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:25.856 A:middle
or goodbye wherever they
are in the profile card.

00:47:26.106 --> 00:47:29.596 A:middle
So for every element
in the card view,

00:47:29.876 --> 00:47:32.696 A:middle
we're going to set it's
accessibilityCustomActions

00:47:32.696 --> 00:47:35.436 A:middle
property to an array
of these two actions.

00:47:36.016 --> 00:47:40.976 A:middle
Okay. Now, let's build and
run with these changes.

00:47:41.516 --> 00:47:51.726 A:middle
[ Background Sounds ]

00:47:52.226 --> 00:47:56.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Double tap to open.

00:47:56.656 --> 00:47:57.336 A:middle
HelloGoodbye [clicking sound].

00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:58.276 A:middle
HelloGoodbye.

00:47:58.566 --> 00:47:59.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let's tap on Matches.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:01.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Matches button.

00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:03.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And double tap to activate.

00:48:03.676 --> 00:48:04.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Beeping sound] Matches.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:05.386 A:middle
Matches. Back.

00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:06.456 A:middle
Back button.

00:48:06.606 --> 00:48:09.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I'm going
to do is tap on the photo,

00:48:09.776 --> 00:48:10.966 A:middle
and start swiping to the right

00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:13.626 A:middle
to see what order VoiceOver
sees these elements.

00:48:14.796 --> 00:48:15.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Profile photo.

00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:17.296 A:middle
Image. Age.

00:48:17.736 --> 00:48:19.346 A:middle
32. Hobbies.

00:48:19.946 --> 00:48:21.436 A:middle
Cooking. Bubble tea
with friends.

00:48:21.696 --> 00:48:22.026 A:middle
Travel.

00:48:22.536 --> 00:48:24.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So that's much
easier to understand.

00:48:24.776 --> 00:48:28.506 A:middle
Next, let's touch any
element in the profile card.

00:48:28.736 --> 00:48:30.526 A:middle
In this case, I'm going
to touch on the photo.

00:48:30.846 --> 00:48:31.896 A:middle
And listen to what it says.

&gt;&gt; Profile photo.

00:48:33.586 --> 00:48:36.706 A:middle
Image. Swipe up or down
to select a CustomAction.

00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:38.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we're given the
option to choose one

00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:40.246 A:middle
of the actions we created.

00:48:40.726 --> 00:48:41.596 A:middle
When I swipe down --

00:48:42.056 --> 00:48:42.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Say hello.

00:48:43.716 --> 00:48:45.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I hear the description
of the action.

00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:49.046 A:middle
If I want to take that action, I
can double tap, [clicking sound]

00:48:49.486 --> 00:48:52.856 A:middle
and so now VoiceOver
users can also say hello

00:48:52.856 --> 00:48:54.086 A:middle
or goodbye to their matches.

00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:56.826 A:middle
And that's how easy it is

00:48:56.826 --> 00:48:59.106 A:middle
to use the new API
we've added in iOS 8.

[ Applause ]

00:49:07.046 --> 00:49:08.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we've come to
the end of our talk,

00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:10.776 A:middle
and there are a few
takeaways I'd like you

00:49:10.776 --> 00:49:13.526 A:middle
to have when you leave.

00:49:14.066 --> 00:49:16.586 A:middle
First, iOS users are diverse.

00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:19.556 A:middle
Keep in mind that there
may be users of your app

00:49:19.986 --> 00:49:22.286 A:middle
who have different needs,
which you should accommodate.

00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:27.766 A:middle
When you accommodate more users,
you're widening your user base.

00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:31.186 A:middle
When more people can use
your app, more people will.

00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:33.836 A:middle
And finally,

00:49:33.836 --> 00:49:39.516 A:middle
adding accessibility is a low
effort, high reward business.

00:49:39.756 --> 00:49:42.666 A:middle
We've just seen how, with only a
few code changes, we took an app

00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:45.306 A:middle
that was just unusable
for many users,

00:49:45.306 --> 00:49:47.886 A:middle
and made it into an experience
that they, too, can enjoy.

00:49:49.336 --> 00:49:52.116 A:middle
So without needing
a lot of work,

00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:54.266 A:middle
you can make a real
difference to users.

00:49:55.446 --> 00:50:00.536 A:middle

00:50:05.876 --> 00:50:07.336 A:middle
There is also the
developer forums.

00:50:07.566 --> 00:50:09.416 A:middle
So you can ask other
developers your questions.

00:50:09.866 --> 00:50:13.866 A:middle
There are several related
sessions to this one.

00:50:14.476 --> 00:50:16.166 A:middle
Prior to this talk,
we had a talk

00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:17.586 A:middle
about accessibility on OS X.

00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:19.626 A:middle
If you missed it, you
can watch the video.

00:50:20.096 --> 00:50:23.886 A:middle
Tomorrow there will be a talk
about designing apps for people

00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:25.166 A:middle
on the autistic spectrum.

00:50:25.346 --> 00:50:27.936 A:middle
And on Friday, you can learn how

00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:30.746 A:middle
to make even complex web
applications accessible.

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:33.346 A:middle
Thank you all for coming.

00:50:33.526 --> 00:50:34.576 A:middle
I hope you enjoyed the talk.

00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:36.576 A:middle
And have a great rest
of the conference.
