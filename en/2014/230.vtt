00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:15.186 A:middle
I'm John Cavanaugh,
and I manage the group

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:17.576 A:middle
that creates the
documentation for all

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:19.606 A:middle
of Apple's consumer
and Pro products.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:21.296 A:middle
And here's some of what we do.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:29.236 A:middle
Print pieces that come in
the box, iBooks and PDFs,

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:32.706 A:middle
help topics that appear
in the OS X Help Viewer.

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:36.816 A:middle
We have some highly
contextual In-App solutions

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:41.416 A:middle
and deliverables on the web
like these iOS user guides

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:45.346 A:middle
or this What's New
Experience you may have seen

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.966 A:middle
in OS X Mavericks.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:53.476 A:middle
Now, creating great customer
documentation isn't always seen

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.986 A:middle
as one of the most exciting
parts of software development -

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:59.616 A:middle
I realize that as the
documentation guy.

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:04.286 A:middle
And it can often be treated as
an afterthought by developers.

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.756 A:middle
Not the developers in
this room of course,

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.436 A:middle
but let's just say
some developers.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:14.676 A:middle
And when that's the case, it can
often take the form of an FAQ

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:18.316 A:middle
or help system where
basically you wait

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:22.866 A:middle
until a person gets stuck, drop
them into a comprehensive body

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.946 A:middle
of content and then have
them fend for themselves

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:27.206 A:middle
to try to get answers.

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:32.326 A:middle
And historically, icons
like this have been used

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:34.136 A:middle
to represent the experience,

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.726 A:middle
which really isn't the
most flattering image

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:44.096 A:middle
to have associated with your app
or game, unless of course it's

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:49.866 A:middle
about rescuing people
lost at sea, I don't know.

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:54.206 A:middle
Now, this Get answers
strategy, it does have its place

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:59.136 A:middle
in help systems for deeper
apps, but as iOS developers,

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:01.286 A:middle
you probably don't
even have to go here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:01.286 A:middle
you probably don't
even have to go here.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.476 A:middle
Instead, Rachel is
going to show you how

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:10.735 A:middle
to anticipate users' needs in a
seamless onboarding experience

00:02:10.906 --> 00:02:13.006 A:middle
so they won't even feel like
they're getting your help.

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:16.066 A:middle
They'll just feel as though
they're experiencing your

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.356 A:middle
amazing app or game.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.136 A:middle
She's also going to show you
how to extend the strategy

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.346 A:middle
into an area we like to
call Inform &amp; Inspire,

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:30.326 A:middle
and that gives you the
opportunity to delight users

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:32.676 A:middle
by showing them what's possible.

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:38.066 A:middle
Now as I've said, there's
great ways to do this and not

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:41.146 A:middle
so great ways, and that's what
Rachel is going to show you now.

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:42.306 A:middle
Rachel.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:48.156 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:50.946 A:middle
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:53.596 A:middle
of Apple's user experience
evangelists.

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.566 A:middle
So today, we're going to talk

00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:59.516 A:middle
about onboarding and
welcoming people.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:01.946 A:middle
Now, this term onboarding,

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:05.336 A:middle
you may have heard it called
the new user experience

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.856 A:middle
or the first use
experience or what happens

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.306 A:middle
in a tutorial for a game.

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:15.336 A:middle
And really, onboarding is a term
that's traditionally associated

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:17.476 A:middle
with what happens with employees

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:18.886 A:middle
when they first started
a company.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:22.306 A:middle
It's how people acquire the
knowledge and the skills

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:25.436 A:middle
and behaviors to become
successful at their job.

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:29.946 A:middle
Now, when it comes to an app or
a game, people are going to go

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:32.026 A:middle
through a similar
sort of experience.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.966 A:middle
They need to figure out, you
know, how does the UI work,

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.296 A:middle
how's the game played,
is this app really going

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:39.186 A:middle
to be right for me?

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:43.186 A:middle
And that's why you
want to welcome them.

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:46.816 A:middle
It's so important that their
first experience is a good one

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.976 A:middle
because otherwise it's going
to be their last experience,

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:52.866 A:middle
because we've got a
million other competitors

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.086 A:middle
in the App Store, literally.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:55.766 A:middle
So people aren't going to stick

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:58.756 A:middle
around if the first
experience isn't really great.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:05.106 A:middle
Now, when you step into a store,
there's - like a physical store


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:05.106 A:middle
Now, when you step into a store,
there's - like a physical store

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:07.456 A:middle
in real life, there's a number
of things that are going

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.676 A:middle
to influence whether
or not you stick around

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:11.606 A:middle
or whether you turn
around and walk out.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:13.876 A:middle
You know, is the layout

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:16.676 A:middle
of the store intimidating
or is it inviting?

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:18.986 A:middle
You know, is the staff rude?

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.926 A:middle
Is the staff really
aggressively pushy?

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:25.816 A:middle
Those things could turn you
off and make you walk away.

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:30.066 A:middle
But if the staff is inviting and
the environment is comfortable,

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.396 A:middle
well, you might stick around,
explore the merchandise.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.096 A:middle
So the best approach with
apps or games is that you want

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:42.196 A:middle
to get people in and using
them as quickly as possible.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:45.146 A:middle
You just want to let
people jump right in,

00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:48.966 A:middle
and sometimes that's
not always possible.

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:53.576 A:middle
Now, there are a number of
reasons for having onboarding

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:58.746 A:middle
and having a confusing or poorly
executed UI is not one of them.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:04.016 A:middle
So you want to make sure if
your UI isn't intuitive and easy


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:04.016 A:middle
So you want to make sure if
your UI isn't intuitive and easy

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:06.336 A:middle
to use, spend time
refining that UI,

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:10.066 A:middle
not building an onboarding
sequence, OK?

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:14.026 A:middle
Now, if you have
registration required

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:16.936 A:middle
to use your application,
that's a different story.

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:21.056 A:middle
Or with games.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:25.946 A:middle
You might need to explain
the backstory or the rules,

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.536 A:middle
you know, how games are played.

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:31.426 A:middle
Or if your UI is heavily
reliant on gestures,

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.826 A:middle
that might warrant a
little bit of information

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:34.966 A:middle
in order to get started.

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:38.776 A:middle
So let's talk briefly
about if you have

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.186 A:middle
to require registration.

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:44.416 A:middle
Sometimes, it is absolutely
necessary to see anything,

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:50.396 A:middle
like a banking application or
social networks or bill pay,

00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
anything that has personal
information, then you're going

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:56.886 A:middle
to need to let people
know what's going on.

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:02.586 A:middle
But before, if there's any way
possible, you want to delay


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:02.586 A:middle
But before, if there's any way
possible, you want to delay

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:05.536 A:middle
that registration until
it's absolutely necessary.

00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:09.666 A:middle
Now, the iTunes store is
a great example of this.

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:13.476 A:middle
You can browse and look at
all the books and the music

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.426 A:middle
and the movies that you want,
and it's only when you go

00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:20.746 A:middle
to buy something that you need
to authenticate or register.

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:23.696 A:middle
So this means there's
nothing standing in the way

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:25.186 A:middle
of finding something you love.

00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:28.886 A:middle
Requiring people to register
before they can see anything

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:31.936 A:middle
puts this unnecessary
obstacle in their way.

00:06:32.516 --> 00:06:34.826 A:middle
They have to trust that it's
going to be worth their while

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:36.406 A:middle
to go through that obstacle.

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:40.256 A:middle
Here is a better way,
this is "JUKELY,"

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:41.796 A:middle
and it's a concert-finding app.

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:43.906 A:middle
They've got a great design.

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:47.356 A:middle
They'll help you find
concerts that are local to you,

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.666 A:middle
tailored to your taste - they
will even find someone to go

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:51.726 A:middle
to the concert with you.

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:55.596 A:middle
Now, not only do they have a
very short onboarding sequence,

00:06:55.736 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
but they will let you browse
without registering at all.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:55.736 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
but they will let you browse
without registering at all.

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:04.586 A:middle
You just tap that "skip this
for now" text at the bottom,

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.426 A:middle
and you can go right inside

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.336 A:middle
and explore what the
app is all about.

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:12.126 A:middle
You can look at the concert
listings, read about bands,

00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:15.476 A:middle
and it's only when you
express interest in something

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:18.306 A:middle
or you want to buy some tickets,
well, that's when they have -

00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:21.616 A:middle
they ask you to sign
up, and that's great.

00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:25.386 A:middle
This approach lets you see
what that app is all about.

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:28.896 A:middle
You can explore everything,
all the concerts in your area,

00:07:28.896 --> 00:07:31.686 A:middle
and you only have to
register when you're ready

00:07:31.686 --> 00:07:33.046 A:middle
to take action on something.

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:36.576 A:middle
People are going to
be much more motivated

00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:38.916 A:middle
and quite frankly
comfortable going

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.906 A:middle
through that registration
process if they're confident

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:44.426 A:middle
in the quality and the utility

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.486 A:middle
of what your app
is offering them.

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:49.966 A:middle
Now, when it's time
to have people go

00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:51.266 A:middle
through that registration,

00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:55.646 A:middle
you want to explain why you're
asking them to register.

00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
So think about it this way,
let's say a stranger walked


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
So think about it this way,
let's say a stranger walked

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.936 A:middle
up to you in front of
Moscone and said, "Hey,

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:05.396 A:middle
can I have your email
address and phone number?"

00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:07.466 A:middle
You wouldn't give
it to him, right?

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:10.086 A:middle
That's just creepy, and you
have no idea what's going

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:11.696 A:middle
to happen with that data.

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:16.666 A:middle
Now, that's exactly what
you're doing if you ask people

00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:18.646 A:middle
to register but you're
not telling them why,

00:08:18.646 --> 00:08:20.566 A:middle
and they don't know
anything about you.

00:08:21.996 --> 00:08:26.596 A:middle
It's especially important in
cases where you have to register

00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:30.696 A:middle
in order to use an app
because your description

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:32.876 A:middle
in the App Store,
or word of mouth,

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:35.376 A:middle
or brand awareness isn't enough

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:38.076 A:middle
to make people feel
comfortable giving you all

00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
of their personal information.

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:43.846 A:middle
You need to make it really clear
what you're going to do with it.

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:48.126 A:middle
So this is "Jelly" and they
crowdsource the answers

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:50.146 A:middle
to questions from
your social network.

00:08:50.686 --> 00:08:52.586 A:middle
So they have a real challenge -

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.406 A:middle
there really is nothing
they can show you

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:56.206 A:middle
without you registering
and signing in.

00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:59.476 A:middle
So that's why they've given

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
of what the service is about

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
of what the service is about

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:03.936 A:middle
and explain why they
need your information.

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:07.816 A:middle
And very importantly, they let
you know that they're not going

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:09.656 A:middle
to post anything automatically.

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:14.876 A:middle
And this is very important
because when you're dealing

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:17.246 A:middle
with people's personal
information,

00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:18.026 A:middle
you want to make sure

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:19.776 A:middle
that they're comfortable
giving it to you.

00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:23.016 A:middle
They want to know that you're
going to protect their privacy.

00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:28.236 A:middle
And transparency around privacy
is particularly important

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:30.476 A:middle
if you're dealing with
social network integration

00:09:31.086 --> 00:09:33.016 A:middle
because I'm sure we've
all had that friend

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:36.656 A:middle
that he's got some app that's
going crazy on their timeline

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:38.806 A:middle
and you're thinking, "Oh
what a noob," you know,

00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:40.086 A:middle
nobody checked their settings,

00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:41.296 A:middle
they didn't know
what they were doing.

00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:44.786 A:middle
And nowhere is this more
the case when you're dealing

00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:46.166 A:middle
with dating applications,

00:09:46.826 --> 00:09:48.926 A:middle
because that would
be a nightmare.

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.996 A:middle
All of a sudden, all your
friends and your family

00:09:51.996 --> 00:09:55.126 A:middle
and some people that you kind of
know from work or met some time

00:09:55.126 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
in a bar could see who you
liked and who you didn't like.

00:09:59.096 --> 00:09:59.936 A:middle
Nobody wants that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:04.756 A:middle
So "Tinder" here is a very
popular dating application

00:10:04.756 --> 00:10:09.396 A:middle
and they're very explicit: They
are never going to post anything

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:10.936 A:middle
to Facebook on your behalf.

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:14.426 A:middle
And this is hugely
important because the way that

00:10:14.476 --> 00:10:16.926 A:middle
"Tinder" works is
they're asking you if you

00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:18.876 A:middle
like people based
on their picture.

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:21.586 A:middle
So if you have any doubts at all

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:23.286 A:middle
or you're feeling
a little hesitant,

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.236 A:middle
you can tap that i button,

00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:27.236 A:middle
and they spell it
out in more detail.

00:10:27.846 --> 00:10:30.956 A:middle
They take your privacy
very seriously.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:34.606 A:middle
They're never going to
post on Facebook for you.

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:36.576 A:middle
They're not going to
give away your location.

00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:40.036 A:middle
So people can feel reassured
and more comfortable.

00:10:41.116 --> 00:10:45.106 A:middle
And nowhere is this privacy
going to be more important

00:10:45.176 --> 00:10:46.876 A:middle
than with your social
integration.

00:10:47.306 --> 00:10:51.176 A:middle
Now I've just given you a whole
lot of advice about things

00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:52.966 A:middle
to tell people before
they register,

00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:55.806 A:middle
but I want to encourage you that
when you're telling them all

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:58.126 A:middle
of these things, be succinct.

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.486 A:middle
Be as succinct as possible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.486 A:middle
Be as succinct as possible.

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:02.616 A:middle
We all know that people don't

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:06.176 A:middle
like to read long passages
of texts on an app.

00:11:06.396 --> 00:11:08.286 A:middle
They just tap, tap,
tap and get going so.

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:10.886 A:middle
"Uber" does a great
job with this.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:13.756 A:middle
If you haven't experienced
"Uber" yet in San Francisco,

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:17.496 A:middle
it's a car service, so
they'll come pick you up,

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:19.036 A:middle
kind of like a taxi.

00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.026 A:middle
And you might think,
"Well, why do I have

00:11:21.026 --> 00:11:24.316 A:middle
to give them an email address
and a phone number just in order

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.956 A:middle
to get a ride from A to B?"

00:11:26.796 --> 00:11:31.256 A:middle
And they explain here very
briefly, they're going

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:34.666 A:middle
to send you notifications
about when the car is coming

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:36.526 A:middle
and emails about
the confirmation.

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:40.726 A:middle
So that makes you feel better.

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:45.296 A:middle
So being succinct will keep
your registration process short,

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:48.556 A:middle
and it will help encourage
people to actually read the text

00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:52.756 A:middle
that you've so carefully
crafted for that screen.

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:55.326 A:middle
Now, another way that you
can make the process short is

00:11:55.326 --> 00:11:58.476 A:middle
to only collect what
you need right now.

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.636 A:middle
Don't be tempted to ask
for a lot of information


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.636 A:middle
Don't be tempted to ask
for a lot of information

00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:04.226 A:middle
because you have
this great feature

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:06.136 A:middle
and you're probably
going to do it someday,

00:12:06.136 --> 00:12:08.806 A:middle
or maybe you're thinking about
doing this, so let's get date

00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:12.416 A:middle
of birth and let's ask their
gender and - you only want

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:14.436 A:middle
to take what it is that
you're going to use

00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:17.866 A:middle
and what you've told the users
that you're going to do with it

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:20.636 A:middle
so that people feel
comfortable giving it to you.

00:12:21.596 --> 00:12:24.696 A:middle
Otherwise, people are
going to be suspicious,

00:12:24.796 --> 00:12:27.076 A:middle
and that could prevent
them from actually going

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:28.646 A:middle
through the registration
process.

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:33.626 A:middle
So, if you do need people
to register in order

00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:36.506 A:middle
to use your app, keep
these things in mind,

00:12:37.286 --> 00:12:39.106 A:middle
follow these guidelines
and everyone is going

00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:41.116 A:middle
to feel really comfortable
and motivated

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.556 A:middle
to give you their information.

00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:45.816 A:middle
All right, so now, let's get

00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:47.856 A:middle
into the onboarding
best practices.

00:12:48.596 --> 00:12:54.916 A:middle
As I said earlier, the best
experience is going to be

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:58.386 A:middle
to just jump in and start
using that app right away.

00:12:59.006 --> 00:13:02.346 A:middle
So you want to ask yourselves,
"What do people need to know


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.006 --> 00:13:02.346 A:middle
So you want to ask yourselves,
"What do people need to know

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:03.916 A:middle
in order to get started
with my app?"

00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:08.266 A:middle
And if the answer is
nothing, fantastic.

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.556 A:middle
Don't put any onboarding in.

00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:11.566 A:middle
You're great.

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:13.536 A:middle
Just let them in and
let them get going.

00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:18.556 A:middle
Now, if there are some things
like the rules for a game

00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:20.776 A:middle
or like the gestures that
they might need to know,

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:24.036 A:middle
you want to tell them
just enough to get started

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.406 A:middle
and then get out
of the way quickly.

00:13:27.636 --> 00:13:32.056 A:middle
So think about if you went into
a restaurant, and before you sat

00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:34.196 A:middle
down at the table,
the host said, "OK,

00:13:34.196 --> 00:13:35.206 A:middle
welcome to the restaurant.

00:13:35.206 --> 00:13:37.956 A:middle
I'm going to tell you
every single thing

00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:40.656 A:middle
on the menu right
now in great detail.

00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:42.326 A:middle
And by the way, here
are the things

00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:43.576 A:middle
that I think you should order."

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:46.096 A:middle
That would be ridiculous, right?

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:49.316 A:middle
So pushy. You really
just want to come in,

00:13:49.316 --> 00:13:52.406 A:middle
get settled at your table,
peruse the menu at your leisure.

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:55.196 A:middle
That's the experience
that you're after, right?

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.746 A:middle
So that's what you
need to re-create

00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:59.246 A:middle
in your app or your game.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:01.526 A:middle
You want to do that equivalent

00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:03.556 A:middle
of leading people
in to their table.

00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:06.596 A:middle
Maybe you're going to tell them
the specials in a restaurant,

00:14:07.156 --> 00:14:10.056 A:middle
and then let them
explore on their own.

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:14.356 A:middle
When people launch an app
or a game, they're expecting

00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:17.346 A:middle
to participate, they're not
expecting a long lecture.

00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:22.606 A:middle
So imagine you launched
"Calculator" app

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:27.176 A:middle
and you saw something like
this, followed by this,

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:31.576 A:middle
followed by this, oh my gosh.

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:35.376 A:middle
Now, I'm not going to make
you guys sit through all seven

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:39.076 A:middle
of these but you can see how
frustrating that would be

00:14:39.456 --> 00:14:42.366 A:middle
if you're faced with a long
list of marketing messages

00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:44.666 A:middle
about an app before
you even got to use it.

00:14:44.756 --> 00:14:46.296 A:middle
I mean, it's a calculator,
right?

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:52.576 A:middle
So really, resist the temptation
to string together a whole lot

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:55.726 A:middle
of long list of features
and marketing and hey,

00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:57.126 A:middle
make sure you check

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.386 A:middle
There is no need
for instructions

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:05.666 A:middle
if the user interface
is intuitive to use

00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:07.436 A:middle
and the functionality
is obvious.

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:10.766 A:middle
And if it isn't, I suggest

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:15.166 A:middle
that you spend time reworking
the design, not sticking a bunch

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:19.626 A:middle
of onboarding screens on there.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.726 A:middle
If you need to give a few UI
tips, you want to do it quickly

00:15:22.726 --> 00:15:24.346 A:middle
and get out of the
way, but otherwise,

00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:28.876 A:middle
avoid those long
marketing messages, OK?

00:15:29.436 --> 00:15:32.346 A:middle
Now, you always want to
start with the basics

00:15:32.676 --> 00:15:34.576 A:middle
and this is especially
important for games,

00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:36.246 A:middle
which are most often the place

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:38.446 A:middle
where you need a little
information to get going.

00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:42.006 A:middle
Like with video games
with our App Store games,

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:44.636 A:middle
you might want the backstory
so you know, you know,

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:45.926 A:middle
what's the objective
of the game?

00:15:46.186 --> 00:15:47.926 A:middle
Or the backstory makes
it more fun, right?

00:15:48.926 --> 00:15:50.496 A:middle
But think about a
card game that you sit

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:51.746 A:middle
down to play with friends.

00:15:52.406 --> 00:15:55.116 A:middle
First, you usually go over
OK, what are the rules?

00:15:55.396 --> 00:15:56.566 A:middle
How does play progress?

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:57.446 A:middle
How do you win?

00:15:57.616 --> 00:15:58.616 A:middle
That's an important one.

00:15:59.256 --> 00:16:01.326 A:middle

And then you might even
try a couple of tips

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
on strategy all before
you start playing.

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:08.326 A:middle
So just like that card game,
you start with the basics

00:16:08.326 --> 00:16:10.926 A:middle
and then you build up the
complexity from there.

00:16:11.926 --> 00:16:13.536 A:middle
Because you're not going
to be prepared to learn

00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:15.346 A:middle
about strategies for winning

00:16:15.346 --> 00:16:17.156 A:middle
if you don't understand
how the game is played

00:16:17.156 --> 00:16:17.896 A:middle
in the first place.

00:16:17.956 --> 00:16:21.836 A:middle
Let's look at a great
example, this is "Dots,"

00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:23.916 A:middle
and "Dots" is a puzzle game.

00:16:24.986 --> 00:16:26.696 A:middle
They need just a
little bit of onboarding

00:16:26.696 --> 00:16:30.336 A:middle
to explain how the game works,
and they've also touched

00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:31.836 A:middle
on the inspiration for the game.

00:16:31.836 --> 00:16:34.596 A:middle
They've got this quote here,
"A smart man once said,

'Everything eventually
connects.'" OK.

00:16:37.686 --> 00:16:43.006 A:middle
So the first thing, two
dots, connect them, got it.

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:47.536 A:middle
Now, a couple more dots.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.606 A:middle
Now different colors of dots.

00:16:59.146 --> 00:17:01.266 A:middle
as you go, and they're
reinforcing everything

00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:05.156 A:middle
with sound and animation
and positive reassurance

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:06.146 A:middle
as you're going through.

00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.016 A:middle
So it is completely interactive.

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:11.685 A:middle
So that's a great
way to get started.

00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:15.516 A:middle
And now, I know that this seems
like a pretty simple example,

00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:18.576 A:middle
but really, almost any kind
of game benefits from this:

00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:21.445 A:middle
builders, role-playing games,
arcade games, all of it.

00:17:22.236 --> 00:17:23.806 A:middle
Let's take a look
at "Hitman GO."

00:17:24.406 --> 00:17:27.826 A:middle
Now, "Hitman GO" has eliminated
onboarding altogether.

00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:30.296 A:middle
They just put you in
the game right away.

00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:31.436 A:middle
It's a great experience.

00:17:32.236 --> 00:17:34.576 A:middle
But to set people
up for success,

00:17:35.226 --> 00:17:38.496 A:middle
the very basic levels
start - the first levels

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.896 A:middle
that you play start
with very basic actions.

00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:43.166 A:middle
So what's the first
thing you need to know

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:44.496 A:middle
in order to play this game?

00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:50.056 A:middle
Well, that's how to move
and how to win, right?

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:55.576 A:middle
OK, we got a straight line,
I only have one choice.

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.816 A:middle
All right, one more choice.

00:17:58.436 --> 00:17:59.596 A:middle
Hooray. Success.

00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:02.036 A:middle
I mean, it was very easy.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:02.036 A:middle
I mean, it was very easy.

00:18:02.036 --> 00:18:04.856 A:middle
It's a no-lose situation,
but that's teaching you.

00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:05.946 A:middle
What's the objective?

00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:07.246 A:middle
I want to get to that big,

00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:09.186 A:middle
dark circle at the end
of the screen, right?

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:13.636 A:middle
How do I move along the path?

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.976 A:middle
Next, they introduce
you to obstacles.

00:18:20.076 --> 00:18:23.336 A:middle
Again, I've got one
path, and I'm a hit man,

00:18:23.546 --> 00:18:25.056 A:middle
and this guy's back
is towards me

00:18:25.056 --> 00:18:32.276 A:middle
so he was a pretty easy target.

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:36.106 A:middle
Again, it's a can't-lose
level, but I'm playing the game

00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:38.246 A:middle
and I'm learning as
I go, so it's fun.

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:39.296 A:middle
It's not onboarding.

00:18:39.476 --> 00:18:40.536 A:middle
I'm playing a game here.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:44.946 A:middle
Now as the levels progress,
they get more difficult.

00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:46.456 A:middle
You get choices in your path,

00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:49.476 A:middle
and now your obstacle here
is facing you so that's going

00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:50.496 A:middle
to be a little trickier.

00:18:50.556 --> 00:18:53.316 A:middle
And trust me, it gets
much, much harder.

00:18:53.316 --> 00:18:56.726 A:middle
You get different kinds of
obstacles, more of them.

00:18:56.726 --> 00:18:58.006 A:middle
Trapdoors and things like that.

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:01.166 A:middle
When you first start
playing, all you have


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:01.166 A:middle
When you first start
playing, all you have

00:19:01.216 --> 00:19:02.906 A:middle
to do is complete the level.

00:19:03.566 --> 00:19:07.096 A:middle
Get to that dark
circle at the end.

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:10.236 A:middle
But the more you play, the
more challenges you have.

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:12.586 A:middle
So now, I'm not just
completing the level,

00:19:12.746 --> 00:19:14.666 A:middle
I need to collect the briefcase,

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:17.246 A:middle
I got to do it in
12 moves or less.

00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:19.576 A:middle
It's getting more complex.

00:19:20.316 --> 00:19:22.816 A:middle
And this is giving
me more challenges

00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:25.006 A:middle
and it's encouraging
repeat gameplay as well.

00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:29.076 A:middle
I mean, because if you had to
start on this level, hoo-wee,

00:19:29.516 --> 00:19:32.036 A:middle
I think that would last
all of about 30 seconds,

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.926 A:middle
and then I'd be off
to find another game.

00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:37.486 A:middle
Now starting simply and building

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:39.386 A:middle
up the complexity is
called scaffolding.

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:42.486 A:middle
And that's how you
can set up new players

00:19:42.486 --> 00:19:44.456 A:middle
to have an enjoyable experience.

00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:46.836 A:middle
It's going to keep them
coming back to your game.

00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:50.196 A:middle
But this approach also
works for apps as well.

00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:54.026 A:middle
You want to teach the basic
things, how to navigate

00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:55.776 A:middle
and the general purpose
functions,

00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:58.936 A:middle
before you even consider
trying to teach people

00:19:58.936 --> 00:20:00.766 A:middle
about more advanced operations.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.936 --> 00:20:00.766 A:middle
about more advanced operations.

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:04.526 A:middle
Now, this is "Yahoo!

00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:05.286 A:middle
News Digest."

00:20:05.426 --> 00:20:08.066 A:middle
It's one of this year's
Apple Design Award winners.

00:20:08.856 --> 00:20:10.686 A:middle
Now, they've got a fantastic UI

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:13.286 A:middle
as you might have
guessed by their award.

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.516 A:middle
It's intuitive to use, so none

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:19.746 A:middle
of their onboarding
is covering UI.

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.816 A:middle
Now, the way that
its news works is

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:23.616 A:middle
that it's a daily
digest twice a day.

00:20:23.616 --> 00:20:27.336 A:middle
And this is an entirely new
paradigm for Yahoo News,

00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:29.386 A:middle
who have quite an
established audience.

00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:33.566 A:middle
So it's really important to
set people's expectations

00:20:33.686 --> 00:20:36.686 A:middle
about the content that they
were going to be seeing.

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:38.276 A:middle
Otherwise, people
might be confused

00:20:38.276 --> 00:20:39.396 A:middle
about the purpose of the app.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.546 A:middle
So by putting together
just three short screens

00:20:43.546 --> 00:20:45.106 A:middle
with the supportive
illustrations,

00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:49.286 A:middle
and then getting you right into
the news, they're setting you

00:20:49.286 --> 00:20:51.166 A:middle
up for success in a
different kind of way.

00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:54.516 A:middle
And this approach
is not appropriate

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:56.176 A:middle
for all kinds of apps or games.

00:20:56.776 --> 00:20:59.136 A:middle
It's really when you're
breaking into a new market

00:20:59.256 --> 00:21:01.636 A:middle
or that you're establishing
some sort of new paradigm


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.256 --> 00:21:01.636 A:middle
or that you're establishing
some sort of new paradigm

00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:04.396 A:middle
that you might need to
communicate just a little bit

00:21:04.856 --> 00:21:05.936 A:middle
about your core concept.

00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:09.276 A:middle
And that's going to help
people understand the products

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:11.076 A:middle
and quite frankly,
appreciate it, right?

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:15.256 A:middle
So, just three short screens and
then getting you into the news

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:16.946 A:middle
because they're going to
get out of the way quickly.

00:21:17.496 --> 00:21:21.726 A:middle
So think about the basic, basic
things that people would need

00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:24.076 A:middle
to know in order to
start playing your game

00:21:24.076 --> 00:21:25.786 A:middle
or using your app.

00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:28.676 A:middle
And think about if any of
them really need explaining,

00:21:29.216 --> 00:21:32.176 A:middle
because again, if you
don't - if they don't,

00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:33.596 A:middle
don't do any onboarding, right?

00:21:33.956 --> 00:21:38.006 A:middle
But if you do, consider
the ways that you can start

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.596 A:middle
with the basics and
build up the complexity.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:44.296 A:middle
With games, it's going to be how
to move, what's the objective,

00:21:44.676 --> 00:21:46.426 A:middle
how do you win and
things like that.

00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:49.186 A:middle
And when you're teaching
these things,

00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:52.716 A:middle
make sure you're only
teaching one thing at a time.

00:21:53.766 --> 00:21:57.126 A:middle
It is so much harder to learn
if you're dealt with a bunch

00:21:57.126 --> 00:21:59.326 A:middle
of instructions at
once or if it's -

00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
especially if it's related to
something unfamiliar, right?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
especially if it's related to
something unfamiliar, right?

00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:04.726 A:middle
OK, I'm going to give all of
you guys some instructions.

00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:10.396 A:middle
After this, I want you to leave
Moscone, make two left turns,

00:22:10.686 --> 00:22:12.026 A:middle
then a right down the alleyway.

00:22:12.606 --> 00:22:15.926 A:middle
Go to the coffee shop on the
corner, order two lattes,

00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:18.356 A:middle
one decaf, one low fat.

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:21.726 A:middle
Put three sugars in the
decaf one and one sugar

00:22:21.726 --> 00:22:23.876 A:middle
in the low fat one and then
bring them back to me here.

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:29.346 A:middle
Got it? If anyone got
that, I'm looking forward

00:22:29.346 --> 00:22:30.416 A:middle
to my latte after this.

00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:33.836 A:middle
But you can see how
difficult that is.

00:22:33.836 --> 00:22:36.256 A:middle
I'm sure you guys are all
tuned out on step three.

00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:39.966 A:middle
People are going to
be much more able

00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.216 A:middle
to follow those instructions

00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:43.096 A:middle
if they're parceled
out one at a time.

00:22:43.866 --> 00:22:47.056 A:middle
So if I said, "Go out of
Moscone, make two left turns,

00:22:47.756 --> 00:22:49.266 A:middle
and then when you
get to the corner,

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:50.406 A:middle
I'll tell you what to do."

00:22:50.486 --> 00:22:52.906 A:middle
And then I'll say, "Go
to the coffee shop."

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:56.196 A:middle
And then when you get to the
register, I text you, "Hey,

00:22:56.196 --> 00:22:58.316 A:middle
here's the coffee that
I want you to order" -

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:01.016 A:middle
this would be so much easier.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:01.016 A:middle
this would be so much easier.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:04.806 A:middle
So you want to give
instructions one at a time

00:23:05.346 --> 00:23:06.286 A:middle
and give people a chance

00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:08.546 A:middle
to apply those instructions
before you start teaching

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:09.826 A:middle
anything else.

00:23:10.516 --> 00:23:12.906 A:middle
So this is "Leo's
Fortune," another one

00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:15.346 A:middle
of our Apple Design Award
winners from this year.

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:19.746 A:middle
It's a really fun
platform adventure game set

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.446 A:middle
in these really gorgeous
environments.

00:23:22.586 --> 00:23:25.626 A:middle
And their tutorial
level is fantastic.

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:28.566 A:middle
They first start
to explain the game

00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:29.896 A:middle
with a little bit of backstory.

00:23:30.036 --> 00:23:31.646 A:middle
They introduce you to Leopold.

00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:35.116 A:middle
They let you know he's lost
his fortune and you're going

00:23:35.116 --> 00:23:35.946 A:middle
to help him reclaim it.

00:23:37.056 --> 00:23:40.216 A:middle
So this translates into
"get the gold coins."

00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:42.066 A:middle
Now you got your
objective, right?

00:23:43.556 --> 00:23:46.956 A:middle
Next step is just about
how to hold your device.

00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:50.406 A:middle
They're getting you used to
this idea that the left side

00:23:50.406 --> 00:23:52.576 A:middle
of the screen and the right
side of the screen are going

00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:53.596 A:middle
to do something different,

00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:55.896 A:middle
but they haven't told
you what that is yet.

00:23:56.816 --> 00:23:58.686 A:middle
Just put your thumbs
in this position,

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
and that gets you holding
the device in the best way.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
and that gets you holding
the device in the best way.

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:06.046 A:middle
Now, once you press your
thumbs in each circle,

00:24:06.136 --> 00:24:07.616 A:middle
then they're talking
about movement.

00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:09.626 A:middle
What do you do with
your left thumb?

00:24:09.706 --> 00:24:11.656 A:middle
Well first, we're
just going to forwards

00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:14.206 A:middle
and backwards, the very basics.

00:24:14.206 --> 00:24:18.026 A:middle
And then you get a chance to
play with that a little bit.

00:24:18.026 --> 00:24:20.016 A:middle
You're going to collect
some coins, go through some

00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:21.026 A:middle
of the cool environments.

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:24.886 A:middle
And then, a slight obstacle.

00:24:25.306 --> 00:24:27.686 A:middle
Now, there's a little chalk
drawing to help you out

00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:28.906 A:middle
or some words on the right

00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:31.256 A:middle
that lets you know now
it's time you're going

00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:34.746 A:middle
to use your right thumb, here
we go, get up over that ledge.

00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:38.476 A:middle
And then, a chance to play.

00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:41.696 A:middle
They give you things to jump
over, things to jump onto.

00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:45.596 A:middle
And next step, some
more obstacles.

00:24:45.726 --> 00:24:48.456 A:middle
Here, it's about using that
up gesture for something else.

00:24:48.856 --> 00:24:49.606 A:middle
So they're building

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:53.986 A:middle
up the complexity while teaching
you one thing at a time.

00:24:54.186 --> 00:24:56.766 A:middle
Pushing up on that lever is
going to release the drawbridge,

00:24:56.766 --> 00:24:58.956 A:middle
and then you can
continue on your way.

00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:03.626 A:middle
Then you'll learn about pushing
down and what that does for you.

00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:07.416 A:middle
So "Leo's Fortune" -
one skill at a time,

00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:10.776 A:middle
which is so manageable, and
it's fun because you're playing.

00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:14.006 A:middle
So it's a great example
of scaffolding,

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:18.236 A:middle
along with "Hitman GO" and
several other examples.

00:25:19.826 --> 00:25:22.866 A:middle
So the first thing you do,
is you learn the objective,

00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:25.136 A:middle
collect those gold coins.

00:25:26.536 --> 00:25:27.576 A:middle
Next thing you're going to learn

00:25:27.576 --> 00:25:30.136 A:middle
about is the optimal
hand position, right?

00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:32.706 A:middle
So they're building up the
complexity with the scaffolding.

00:25:33.286 --> 00:25:35.686 A:middle
And the next thing
that you learn

00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:38.936 A:middle
about is really basic
movement - how to go forwards,

00:25:39.086 --> 00:25:42.546 A:middle
what are you doing
with your left hand?

00:25:42.716 --> 00:25:44.116 A:middle
Next step is obstacles,

00:25:44.606 --> 00:25:47.856 A:middle
which you conquer using your
right hand and various gestures.

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.756 A:middle
And then further in the game,

00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:53.096 A:middle
they start showing you
advanced obstacles or puzzles.

00:25:53.186 --> 00:25:57.626 A:middle
So you can see how the
complexity builds up that way.

00:25:57.846 --> 00:25:59.606 A:middle
Now like I said, the
same thing applies

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
to apps, it's not just games.

You can teach people by doing.

00:26:03.226 --> 00:26:05.686 A:middle
You don't want to show them
a lot of screens upfront.

00:26:07.076 --> 00:26:08.966 A:middle
Now Pinterest - this
is Pinterest,

00:26:09.266 --> 00:26:12.156 A:middle
and they use onboarding
just for a specific feature.

00:26:12.366 --> 00:26:15.956 A:middle
So they have a new guided
search feature, and they needed

00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:17.436 A:middle
to teach people new to the app

00:26:17.616 --> 00:26:21.416 A:middle
and also returning users
how to go about using it.

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:23.946 A:middle
And they do a great
job of parceling

00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:26.056 A:middle
out this information
one step at a time.

00:26:26.816 --> 00:26:28.726 A:middle
So the first time you
go to the Search tab

00:26:28.726 --> 00:26:30.286 A:middle
after this feature
was introduced,

00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:31.636 A:middle
you get a little
bit of information.

00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:34.126 A:middle
And they've given
you some samples.

00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:37.426 A:middle
And these samples are all things
that I'm pretty interested in.

00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:39.346 A:middle
So they've done a great job

00:26:39.346 --> 00:26:42.136 A:middle
in making this a really
valuable exercise for me.

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:48.056 A:middle
Now I happen to like nail art,
and so next I tap, they explain

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:51.366 A:middle
to me how to refine that
search even further.

00:26:51.976 --> 00:26:55.856 A:middle
And then once I've
done some refinement,

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:57.996 A:middle
they talk about even
more advanced refinement,

00:26:58.336 --> 00:26:59.286 A:middle

And because you're getting this
information one step at a time,

00:27:03.826 --> 00:27:06.156 A:middle
it's much easier to
understand what to do,

00:27:06.476 --> 00:27:09.096 A:middle
and they're letting you
execute on these instructions

00:27:09.206 --> 00:27:10.396 A:middle
so you're really learning.

00:27:10.746 --> 00:27:11.796 A:middle
You're taking it all in.

00:27:12.216 --> 00:27:13.296 A:middle
You're much more likely

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:16.156 A:middle
to remember this later next time
you go to search for something.

00:27:16.696 --> 00:27:22.216 A:middle
With all of these examples,
it wasn't overwhelming, right?

00:27:22.396 --> 00:27:26.456 A:middle
And you're actually able
to use what you've learned

00:27:26.456 --> 00:27:29.126 A:middle
because you're playing
the game or using an app.

00:27:31.256 --> 00:27:36.216 A:middle
Because people learn better by
doing than they do by reading

00:27:36.496 --> 00:27:40.896 A:middle
or listening when it
comes to apps or games.

00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:43.516 A:middle
"Dots," "Hitman GO,"

they all reinforce what
they're teaching you with play.

00:27:46.836 --> 00:27:49.466 A:middle
And Pinterest was letting you
actually search for things.

00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:51.036 A:middle
It wasn't a canned experience.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:53.466 A:middle
Those were real search
terms with real refinements.

Now Benjamin Franklin has
a great quote about this:

00:28:20.086 --> 00:28:21.336 A:middle
"Tell me and I forget.

take you out of context

It would be terrible, right?

00:28:44.016 --> 00:28:45.256 A:middle
First of all, the UI is

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.566 A:middle
so dimmed you can barely
see the buttons at all.

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:53.666 A:middle
Secondly, you don't need to say
tap here, tap here, tap here all

over a touch interface.

00:28:55.426 --> 00:28:56.536 A:middle

Now again, if your buttons don't
look obviously interactive,

00:29:10.756 --> 00:29:11.886 A:middle
redesign your buttons.

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.646 A:middle
Don't put some modal
display letting you know

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:15.926 A:middle
that you can tap places.

00:29:16.446 --> 00:29:20.336 A:middle
So if you do need onboarding,

00:29:20.936 --> 00:29:23.436 A:middle
make sure that your experience
lets people participate.

00:29:23.436 --> 00:29:28.766 A:middle
And you can use animation

00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:30.376 A:middle

For today, I would just
like to talk specifically

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:49.206 A:middle
about something that I
see in games all the time:

00:29:50.236 --> 00:29:52.516 A:middle
the giant bouncing arrow.

00:29:54.936 --> 00:29:58.506 A:middle
Now at first, this does
seem like an effective way

00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:00.396 A:middle
to get people through
a tutorial level.

to get people through
a tutorial level.

00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:06.406 A:middle
Great. But then, you know,
while it starts to show people

00:30:06.406 --> 00:30:10.306 A:middle
where to look, it eventually
becomes distracting.

00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:13.476 A:middle
When there's more information on
the screen, you're not looking

00:30:13.476 --> 00:30:16.646 A:middle
at the information, you're just
looking at the arrow and where

00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:18.906 A:middle
to tap and thinking, "I
want to play the game.

00:30:18.906 --> 00:30:20.246 A:middle
I don't want to read
the tutorial."

00:30:20.796 --> 00:30:24.236 A:middle
So you're looking at this
button instead of looking

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:27.136 A:middle
at what the different characters
are going to do for you.

00:30:27.136 --> 00:30:28.156 A:middle
Why you're picking them.

The strategy of a game, or how
much it's going to cost you

00:30:31.806 --> 00:30:33.396 A:middle
or what the reward
is going to be.

00:30:34.076 --> 00:30:37.966 A:middle
So pretty soon, your game
has gone from, you know,

00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:41.866 A:middle
"happy ice cream fun time" or
whatever to "tap the arrow."

00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:44.446 A:middle
No one wants to play
tap the arrow.

00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:45.826 A:middle

Tap the arrow gets
old so quickly.

Another way you can
kind of think

00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:53.386 A:middle
of it is I don't know
how many of you have pets

00:30:53.386 --> 00:30:55.816 A:middle
but if you've ever tried to
point something out to a dog

00:30:55.816 --> 00:30:59.106 A:middle
or a cat, they often
just wind up looking

00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:00.206 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:10.676 A:middle
Yea. So this is exactly what
you're doing with tap the arrow.

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.526 A:middle
People aren't going
to be looking

00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:14.046 A:middle
at what you're pointing
towards, they're going

00:31:14.046 --> 00:31:15.256 A:middle
to be looking at the arrow.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:20.496 A:middle
So rather than pointing,
try a suggestive animation,

00:31:20.496 --> 00:31:23.056 A:middle
one that's going to help lead
people's eye to the right part

00:31:23.056 --> 00:31:25.206 A:middle
of the screen or let them
know what they should do.

00:31:25.206 --> 00:31:28.476 A:middle
This is a really basic
example but it's a good one.

00:31:28.836 --> 00:31:33.076 A:middle
With "Hitman GO," you don't
need an arrow or a graphic

00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:35.966 A:middle
or some other kind of bouncy
arrow thing to let you know

00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:38.536 A:middle
that this is a button in
addition to being the name.

00:31:39.116 --> 00:31:41.556 A:middle
That pulsing animation
draws you to it.

00:31:41.556 --> 00:31:43.026 A:middle
It makes you want
to tap it, right?

00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:47.126 A:middle
I mean, they could have had
an arrow pointing, "Tap here,

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:51.886 A:middle
tap here," but you
don't need to do that.

00:31:51.886 --> 00:31:54.666 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
using animation thoughtfully.

00:31:55.506 --> 00:31:58.466 A:middle
I hope I look forward to seeing
far fewer bouncing arrows

there is no need to point

the unconventional

00:32:13.576 --> 00:32:15.736 A:middle
because everybody knows

look that way.

Or that you can swipe
for more content

00:32:38.826 --> 00:32:42.266 A:middle
because the content bleeding off
the edge does that job for you.

And that's really one of
the greatest advantages

00:32:46.236 --> 00:32:47.996 A:middle
of using platform conventions.

know how to interact with them,

for these type of things.

00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:06.616 A:middle
Now, another thing to be wary
of is forcing people to go

00:33:06.616 --> 00:33:09.256 A:middle
down a secondary path that
they may not want to take.

00:33:10.096 --> 00:33:12.246 A:middle
So think about a
photo application.

00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:15.366 A:middle
I don't want to be
forced to crop an image

00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:17.546 A:middle
if I don't think it
needs to be cropped.

00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:20.236 A:middle
If I don't want to
apply a photo filter

00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:22.616 A:middle
to a photo, I shouldn't have to.

00:33:22.846 --> 00:33:25.746 A:middle
This is my app, I want to
do what I want with it.

00:33:26.496 --> 00:33:28.976 A:middle
Similarly, with music
applications,

00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:32.616 A:middle
it's great to show people how
to make a playlist or a station,

00:33:33.146 --> 00:33:36.426 A:middle
but don't make them market a
favorite if it's not a favorite.

00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:38.106 A:middle
That's just frustrating.

00:33:38.106 --> 00:33:43.056 A:middle
Now, when it comes to
text like I said before,

00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:44.976 A:middle
shorter is always better.

00:33:45.916 --> 00:33:47.686 A:middle
We know that people
are not inclined

00:33:47.686 --> 00:33:50.196 A:middle
to read really long
passages unless it's a book,

00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:55.266 A:middle
so make sure your language
is short and clear.

00:33:56.316 --> 00:34:00.096 A:middle
Avoid jargon and acronyms
or insider language


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:56.316 --> 00:34:00.096 A:middle
Avoid jargon and acronyms
or insider language

00:34:00.146 --> 00:34:01.186 A:middle
that may not make sense

00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:03.536 A:middle
to someone who's
new to your app, OK?

00:34:04.096 --> 00:34:08.436 A:middle
This is my favorite example,
"JUKELY," and they're talking

00:34:08.436 --> 00:34:09.775 A:middle
about their notifications.

00:34:11.206 --> 00:34:14.426 A:middle
It's so fun, a mixtape
from a stalker.

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:15.886 A:middle
I'm excited.

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:22.775 A:middle
I mean, this text is clear,
it's friendly, it's entertaining

00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:24.505 A:middle
as well as being educational.

00:34:25.076 --> 00:34:27.835 A:middle
So here are some
things you can think

00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:29.426 A:middle
about when it comes
to writing your text.

00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:31.906 A:middle
Ask yourself these questions.

00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:35.696 A:middle
Could the text be shorter
or could it be clearer?

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:39.396 A:middle
Will the text make sense
to someone who's new

00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:43.025 A:middle
to the application, because
you look at your app all day

00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:47.116 A:middle
and all night every day, so you
really need fresh perspective,

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:50.136 A:middle
and what will someone
unfamiliar with your app think?

00:34:50.616 --> 00:34:53.866 A:middle
Is the message too complicated?

00:34:54.315 --> 00:34:58.596 A:middle
If it is, you can make it
simpler, or maybe you need

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.276 A:middle
to change your approach
altogether.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.276 A:middle
to change your approach
altogether.

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:05.606 A:middle
Or would images work
better than text?

00:35:05.746 --> 00:35:08.526 A:middle
There's our phrase, "A picture
is worth a thousand words."

00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:12.006 A:middle
Sometimes, it's just easier
to do it with a drawing,

00:35:12.586 --> 00:35:13.796 A:middle
like with "Leo's Fortune."

00:35:14.406 --> 00:35:17.746 A:middle
That little chalk drawing
is much - is a quick read.

00:35:17.746 --> 00:35:22.446 A:middle
You can hop up and go on your
way as opposed to saying, "OK.

00:35:22.446 --> 00:35:24.586 A:middle
When you get here,
lift your thumb up so

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:26.306 A:middle
that Leo will hop
over the ledge."

00:35:26.836 --> 00:35:27.936 A:middle
That would be ridiculous.

00:35:30.056 --> 00:35:32.676 A:middle
And make sure that it feels
like an extension of your brand,

00:35:33.176 --> 00:35:36.306 A:middle
because onboarding is going
to be the first experience

00:35:36.306 --> 00:35:38.196 A:middle
that somebody has
with your app or game.

00:35:38.546 --> 00:35:40.566 A:middle
It's kind of like a
wedding invitation

00:35:40.566 --> 00:35:41.926 A:middle
or a party invitation.

00:35:42.196 --> 00:35:45.346 A:middle
It's going to set the tone
for the entire experience,

00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:48.716 A:middle
so make sure it feels
exactly like your brand,

00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:52.996 A:middle
like the personality
of your app.

00:35:53.246 --> 00:35:56.056 A:middle
And this is a very
important one:

00:35:56.906 --> 00:35:59.396 A:middle
Always give people
an option to skip.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:00.096 --> 00:36:04.146 A:middle
Always. If you saw the lunchtime
session yesterday, Natalia talks

00:36:04.146 --> 00:36:06.486 A:middle
about the dark days
of the interwebs

00:36:06.886 --> 00:36:10.456 A:middle
with the big crazy flash intros,
and all people wanted was

00:36:10.556 --> 00:36:12.016 A:middle
"skip intro, skip intro."

00:36:12.016 --> 00:36:14.766 A:middle
And that's exactly what
we're talking about here.

00:36:15.486 --> 00:36:19.516 A:middle
You don't know if someone has
used your app on another device,

00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:23.236 A:middle
if they watched their friend
use your app, or quite frankly,

00:36:23.236 --> 00:36:25.186 A:middle
if they're just impatient
and want to get going.

00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:28.806 A:middle
If people don't want to watch
your onboarding no matter how

00:36:28.806 --> 00:36:32.106 A:middle
awesome it is, don't make them.

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:35.556 A:middle
And finally, learning should
be an enjoyable experience.

00:36:36.576 --> 00:36:37.566 A:middle
It's going to be pleasant.

00:36:37.756 --> 00:36:41.496 A:middle
Again, it's your first
impression of the app

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:45.306 A:middle
or the game, so you want to
make sure that it's a good one.

00:36:46.546 --> 00:36:47.716 A:middle
Let's take a look at "Flight,"

00:36:48.216 --> 00:36:51.256 A:middle
which I think they have a really
great onboarding experience.

00:36:51.256 --> 00:36:53.876 A:middle
That Close button up there
is your option to skip.

00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:56.776 A:middle
And the UI is based
solely on gestures,

00:36:56.776 --> 00:36:58.486 A:middle
and so that's why they
wanted to give some -

00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
just a very brief
onboarding explanation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
just a very brief
onboarding explanation.

00:37:01.966 --> 00:37:05.236 A:middle
The text invokes
the joy of travel.

00:37:06.376 --> 00:37:08.056 A:middle
It's just a few short screens.

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:15.766 A:middle
The visual design matches
every other aspect of the app.

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:18.176 A:middle
And when you're all done,
you tap "Ready to fly,"

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:21.166 A:middle
and you get a nice
little animation.

00:37:21.356 --> 00:37:21.986 A:middle
Fun, right?

00:37:22.216 --> 00:37:26.656 A:middle
Enjoyable, short and pleasant.

00:37:26.696 --> 00:37:29.206 A:middle
So make sure if you need
to provide onboarding

00:37:29.206 --> 00:37:30.716 A:middle
that you're doing
in a way that's fun.

00:37:30.906 --> 00:37:33.116 A:middle
Nobody likes a long
boring lecture.

00:37:33.756 --> 00:37:36.816 A:middle
So these are the things
that you need to strive

00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:41.116 A:middle
for if you need onboarding
- if you need onboarding.

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:45.126 A:middle
Now, whether or not you
have an app or a game,

00:37:45.426 --> 00:37:48.456 A:middle
one thing that's always a
challenge is how to teach people

00:37:48.456 --> 00:37:51.556 A:middle
about gestures or
gyroscope enhancements,

00:37:52.176 --> 00:37:53.536 A:middle
anything that doesn't
have some sort

00:37:53.536 --> 00:37:56.126 A:middle
of visual representation
in the UI.

00:37:57.096 --> 00:37:59.896 A:middle
So let me give you
a few tips about how


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:01.596 A:middle
to make the invisible visible.

00:38:03.086 --> 00:38:05.916 A:middle
And the first one is
using animation cues.

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.916 A:middle
Now I know none of you are going
to make a big bouncy arrow,

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:11.976 A:middle
but there's a lot of
things that you can do

00:38:11.976 --> 00:38:14.706 A:middle
to convey the interactivity
or the gestures

00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:15.916 A:middle
in a very elegant way.

00:38:17.056 --> 00:38:21.416 A:middle
You'll keep people focused
on the UI, not on the cues.

00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:23.536 A:middle
This is "JETSETTER."

00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:27.786 A:middle
It's an app that specializes
in luxury hotels and resorts.

00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:31.386 A:middle
And they've got tons of amazing
photography, which is one

00:38:31.386 --> 00:38:33.546 A:middle
of the things that sets them
apart from their competitors.

00:38:35.596 --> 00:38:38.876 A:middle
This gentle drift of
the photo lets you know

00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:41.536 A:middle
that it's interactive,
that you can touch it

00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:45.816 A:middle
and explore different aspects
of this stunning kitchen.

00:38:47.006 --> 00:38:51.986 A:middle
It invites you to touch it.

00:38:52.176 --> 00:38:55.646 A:middle
Now, the Withings health tracker
app uses horizontal movement

00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:57.466 A:middle
to show that the
screens are swipable.

00:38:58.156 --> 00:39:02.606 A:middle
So that - and if you don't
swipe it, it will auto-advance.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.156 --> 00:39:02.606 A:middle
So that - and if you don't
swipe it, it will auto-advance.

00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:06.856 A:middle
And they've got a nice rewind
page flip type of animation

00:39:06.856 --> 00:39:09.016 A:middle
at the end so that you know
you've hit the last item,

00:39:09.016 --> 00:39:11.306 A:middle
and then you can flip
through for anything you might

00:39:11.306 --> 00:39:11.716 A:middle
have missed.

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:17.676 A:middle
And those are just some of the
ways that you can use animation

00:39:17.926 --> 00:39:21.016 A:middle
to really help encourage
people or explain gestures

00:39:21.016 --> 00:39:22.316 A:middle
or other aspects of the UI.

00:39:22.316 --> 00:39:25.736 A:middle
And again, there were
a lot of tips on this

00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:27.966 A:middle
in Tuesday's session,
so make sure to check it

00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:31.796 A:middle
out if you didn't
already see it.

00:39:32.056 --> 00:39:35.006 A:middle
Now, another effective teaching
tool is temporary hints.

00:39:35.446 --> 00:39:37.486 A:middle
Just really quick
tips about gestures.

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:39.416 A:middle
This is "Yahoo!

00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:42.346 A:middle
News Digest" again, and
as I showed earlier,

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:44.476 A:middle
their onboarding is all
about the core concept.

00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:48.606 A:middle
So instead, once you get
into the UI, they don't need

00:39:48.606 --> 00:39:51.456 A:middle
to tell you about
that ahead of time,

00:39:51.796 --> 00:39:53.026 A:middle
but they give you just a couple

00:39:53.026 --> 00:39:55.196 A:middle
of animation cues
and temporary hints.

00:39:56.006 --> 00:39:59.346 A:middle
So tapping on an article
headline has a horizontal

00:39:59.346 --> 00:40:04.976 A:middle
animation and then that
short message about swiping.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.346 --> 00:40:04.976 A:middle
animation and then that
short message about swiping.

00:40:05.086 --> 00:40:08.096 A:middle
So if the horizontal
animation didn't do it for you,

00:40:08.096 --> 00:40:10.916 A:middle
this message, which only
appears for two seconds,

00:40:11.146 --> 00:40:13.356 A:middle
makes it abundantly
clear that you can swipe

00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:14.456 A:middle
from article to article.

00:40:14.926 --> 00:40:17.816 A:middle
And you'll notice, they
didn't force you to swipe.

00:40:18.446 --> 00:40:20.746 A:middle
Because I might be interested
in reading this article.

00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:26.096 A:middle
They just want to make sure
you know how to navigate.

00:40:26.146 --> 00:40:28.166 A:middle
"Lightly" has a different
approach.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.456 A:middle
It's a photo editing
application,

00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:33.606 A:middle
and the first time you use
it, they give you hints

00:40:33.606 --> 00:40:35.236 A:middle
about gestures with short tips.

00:40:36.036 --> 00:40:39.736 A:middle
So here, I've just selected the
Argyle filter, and so what comes

00:40:39.736 --> 00:40:42.486 A:middle
up is a message about
adjusting the intensity.

00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:47.256 A:middle
Now, I just want to point out,
they don't actually force you

00:40:47.256 --> 00:40:48.536 A:middle
to adjust the intensity.

00:40:49.216 --> 00:40:52.496 A:middle
Any other - any place that you
tap will dismiss that hint,

00:40:52.916 --> 00:40:55.856 A:middle
whether it's adjusting
the intensity,

00:40:55.856 --> 00:40:58.556 A:middle
picking another filter from
the bottom or using any

00:40:58.556 --> 00:40:59.326 A:middle
of the other controls.

00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:05.006 A:middle
So in addition to
displaying temporary hints,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:05.006 A:middle
So in addition to
displaying temporary hints,

00:41:05.366 --> 00:41:08.746 A:middle
you can also think about
providing controls for people

00:41:08.746 --> 00:41:11.706 A:middle
to turn them on, and
this is what we do

00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:13.366 A:middle
in "GarageBand" on iOS.

00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:16.736 A:middle
Now, this is something
that's more appropriate

00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:18.266 A:middle
for deeper applications.

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:20.706 A:middle
Not every app warrants this.

00:41:21.626 --> 00:41:23.996 A:middle
And you can come in and just
start playing these drums

00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:26.376 A:middle
and going nuts without
any assistance at all,

00:41:27.016 --> 00:41:29.776 A:middle
but if you want to know
more, get a deeper knowledge

00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:33.576 A:middle
about drumming, because it's
sort of a specialty case.

00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:35.416 A:middle
If you want to become
a better musician,

00:41:36.206 --> 00:41:40.606 A:middle
then using that question mark
button up in the corner turns

00:41:40.606 --> 00:41:43.006 A:middle
on these non-modal tips,

00:41:43.186 --> 00:41:48.436 A:middle
so you can keep playing the
drums while you're reading more

00:41:48.436 --> 00:41:48.966 A:middle
about them.

00:41:49.816 --> 00:41:52.466 A:middle
And without those non-modal
tips - without these tips,

00:41:52.466 --> 00:41:54.996 A:middle
you might not realize that
you can get different sounds

00:41:54.996 --> 00:41:59.616 A:middle
out of the hi-hat based on where
it is that you're tapping it,

00:41:59.616 --> 00:42:02.256 A:middle
or that a single tap will
play the crash cymbal


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.616 --> 00:42:02.256 A:middle
or that a single tap will
play the crash cymbal

00:42:02.346 --> 00:42:06.326 A:middle
and the bass drum together, but
a two-finger tap is what results

00:42:06.636 --> 00:42:07.926 A:middle
in just the crash cymbal.

00:42:08.536 --> 00:42:11.076 A:middle
Or you wouldn't know
that the speed

00:42:11.076 --> 00:42:13.306 A:middle
of the drum repeat is
determined by the distance

00:42:13.306 --> 00:42:14.436 A:middle
between your two fingers.

00:42:14.716 --> 00:42:15.776 A:middle
All really useful.

00:42:15.856 --> 00:42:19.116 A:middle
So if you think you
have an audience

00:42:19.116 --> 00:42:21.996 A:middle
that wants a deeper knowledge
or needs extra guidance

00:42:21.996 --> 00:42:27.426 A:middle
on a specialized subject,
this could be a good method.

00:42:27.426 --> 00:42:30.766 A:middle
And it's really important that
you can continue to use the app

00:42:31.076 --> 00:42:32.686 A:middle
so that you can learn by doing.

00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:38.996 A:middle
You can put it into
practice right on the spot.

00:42:38.996 --> 00:42:41.416 A:middle
Because all of these
approaches work best

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:42.856 A:middle
if they're shown in context.

00:42:43.426 --> 00:42:46.016 A:middle
It's important that when
you're demonstrating gestures,

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:47.706 A:middle
you want to do it
right in the moment

00:42:47.706 --> 00:42:50.136 A:middle
when people can experiment
with them

00:42:50.136 --> 00:42:51.446 A:middle
so that they're learning
by doing.

00:42:52.266 --> 00:42:57.356 A:middle
So now, I would like to address
a dirty word in iOS UI design.

00:42:58.806 --> 00:43:00.726 A:middle
Help. Help.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.806 --> 00:43:00.726 A:middle
Help. Help.

00:43:01.916 --> 00:43:04.376 A:middle
Nobody wants to think
they need help,

00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:05.906 A:middle
or nobody wants to ask for help.

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:10.906 A:middle
And as a designer, I certainly
hope that every aspect

00:43:10.906 --> 00:43:14.566 A:middle
of my UI is intuitive
to use to every person

00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:17.796 A:middle
in every scenario no
matter what their needs.

00:43:18.286 --> 00:43:22.096 A:middle
But sometimes, this
is hard to achieve.

00:43:23.486 --> 00:43:25.936 A:middle
I mean, people have
different experiences,

00:43:26.126 --> 00:43:27.096 A:middle
different backgrounds.

00:43:27.726 --> 00:43:28.996 A:middle
They come from different
cultures.

00:43:29.586 --> 00:43:31.316 A:middle
They may have a lot
of experience

00:43:31.316 --> 00:43:35.756 A:middle
with the Apple platform but not
with iOS or specialty knowledge.

00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:38.836 A:middle
Like, I can navigate
around just about any app

00:43:39.146 --> 00:43:42.146 A:middle
on the Apple platform but
I'm not a good photographer.

00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:44.826 A:middle
So all those filters
and photo effects,

00:43:44.826 --> 00:43:47.126 A:middle
I don't know what
to do with them.

00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:49.256 A:middle
I don't know when I should
use them, how they're going

00:43:49.256 --> 00:43:50.526 A:middle
to make my pictures better.

00:43:50.526 --> 00:43:54.166 A:middle
And that's where help
can be very handy.

00:43:55.216 --> 00:43:58.576 A:middle
But it's not so as to feel like
a lecture from a mean teacher.

00:43:59.376 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
Or boring.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.376 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
Or boring.

00:44:02.426 --> 00:44:03.676 A:middle
Nobody wants boring.

00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:07.486 A:middle
We're moving away from that
large reference manual, right?

00:44:08.426 --> 00:44:09.506 A:middle
It should feel more like this.

00:44:10.296 --> 00:44:12.716 A:middle
Just making things a
little bit easier on people.

00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:17.196 A:middle
Or maybe like support from
a friend or a family member,

00:44:17.236 --> 00:44:18.386 A:middle
just giving you a
couple of tips,

00:44:19.446 --> 00:44:21.166 A:middle
because I'm definitely
not suggesting

00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:24.906 A:middle
that you add a huge reference
document to your app.

00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:27.596 A:middle
There are a lot of ways
that you can provide help

00:44:27.966 --> 00:44:30.226 A:middle
without people even
realizing that they got any.

00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:34.816 A:middle
One of the easiest
things that you can do is

00:44:34.816 --> 00:44:37.296 A:middle
to put instructions in
your empty containers.

00:44:38.136 --> 00:44:42.296 A:middle
Rather than just saying "no
results for search" or "nothing

00:44:42.296 --> 00:44:45.206 A:middle
to see here," you want
to keep an empty view

00:44:45.206 --> 00:44:46.276 A:middle
from being a dead end.

00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:51.316 A:middle
If it all possible, let people
know what to expect here or how

00:44:51.316 --> 00:44:53.206 A:middle
to get out of this
dead-end situation.

00:44:54.876 --> 00:44:57.986 A:middle
So in iMovie for iOS,
there is a theater view

00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:02.256 A:middle
where your completed projects
go so you can view them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:02.256 A:middle
where your completed projects
go so you can view them.

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:04.486 A:middle
Now, before you create
any projects,

00:45:04.486 --> 00:45:05.756 A:middle
there is nothing to show here.

00:45:06.126 --> 00:45:08.776 A:middle
So the message lets you know
exactly what you're going

00:45:08.776 --> 00:45:12.356 A:middle
to find here in the future,
and then they tell you how

00:45:12.356 --> 00:45:13.686 A:middle
to get started making
a product -

00:45:13.726 --> 00:45:17.076 A:middle
project so that you can have
a movie here really quickly.

00:45:17.696 --> 00:45:21.166 A:middle
And it's worth pointing out that
both the message and the icon

00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:22.766 A:middle
in the navigation
are interactive,

00:45:22.766 --> 00:45:25.886 A:middle
so you can get going quickly
while you're learning the UI.

00:45:26.896 --> 00:45:31.886 A:middle
And this same approach can work
for empty input fields too.

00:45:32.406 --> 00:45:34.786 A:middle
Placeholder text can
be super informative.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:39.786 A:middle
This is "UpTo," which
is a calendar app.

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:42.366 A:middle
You can of course manage
your own appointments,

00:45:42.366 --> 00:45:44.876 A:middle
but one of the things
that's cool about "UpTo" is

00:45:44.876 --> 00:45:47.626 A:middle
that you can also subscribe
to other people's calendars,

00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.186 A:middle
and the other people
can be your friends,

00:45:50.756 --> 00:45:52.136 A:middle
or it can be Barack Obama.

00:45:52.776 --> 00:45:55.256 A:middle
And they have tons of
calendars available in here

00:45:55.356 --> 00:45:57.436 A:middle
so you can browse to
find the ones you want,

00:45:57.706 --> 00:45:59.126 A:middle
but you can also search,

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:04.196 A:middle
and that Search text is very
suggestive in terms of the type


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:04.196 A:middle
and that Search text is very
suggestive in terms of the type

00:46:04.196 --> 00:46:06.046 A:middle
of things that you might
want to put in there.

00:46:06.616 --> 00:46:09.496 A:middle
Now, I got the impression from
the graphic that I could search

00:46:09.496 --> 00:46:12.956 A:middle
for sports teams, but I didn't
realize I could just type

00:46:12.956 --> 00:46:16.966 A:middle
in San Francisco and see all
the listings for San Francisco.

00:46:18.196 --> 00:46:23.046 A:middle
It's very helpful, and it
didn't feel like help, right?

00:46:23.236 --> 00:46:26.206 A:middle
I didn't even realize
I needed any help,

00:46:26.246 --> 00:46:27.606 A:middle
but yet I've learned
something new.

00:46:28.096 --> 00:46:33.476 A:middle
You can also think about showing
supporting information right

00:46:33.476 --> 00:46:38.166 A:middle
inline, and we do this with
settings - not all settings

00:46:38.356 --> 00:46:39.406 A:middle
because they don't all need it.

00:46:40.206 --> 00:46:42.736 A:middle
Date &amp; Time is a pretty
universal concept;

00:46:42.736 --> 00:46:44.226 A:middle
there is nothing
else to say here.

00:46:45.406 --> 00:46:46.986 A:middle
The Dial Assist, well,

00:46:48.056 --> 00:46:50.576 A:middle
some people might have some
questions about what that is.

00:46:50.936 --> 00:46:52.286 A:middle
So there's just a little bit

00:46:52.286 --> 00:46:54.596 A:middle
of more information
right in that moment.

00:46:55.636 --> 00:46:58.126 A:middle
Again, it didn't feel like help.

00:46:59.246 --> 00:47:01.296 A:middle
And with games, "Leo's Fortune."


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.246 --> 00:47:01.296 A:middle
And with games, "Leo's Fortune."

00:47:01.426 --> 00:47:03.416 A:middle
That chalk drawing is
giving you that little hint.

00:47:04.586 --> 00:47:06.796 A:middle
And they don't just do this
in the tutorial level -

00:47:06.796 --> 00:47:10.046 A:middle
it's throughout the game.

00:47:10.236 --> 00:47:13.496 A:middle
In fact, showing information
inline is often a great

00:47:13.496 --> 00:47:15.656 A:middle
alternative to onboarding
altogether.

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:17.986 A:middle
You don't have to tell
everything up front.

00:47:18.576 --> 00:47:22.496 A:middle
Just put the extra information
inline so it's there right

00:47:22.496 --> 00:47:24.606 A:middle
in that moment that
people need it.

00:47:26.846 --> 00:47:29.836 A:middle
Now, another great approach
is to watch for indications

00:47:29.836 --> 00:47:31.866 A:middle
that people are stuck.

00:47:32.856 --> 00:47:35.436 A:middle
Now, when it comes to games,
though, you have to be wary

00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:37.796 A:middle
about over-helping people
because it's a game,

00:47:38.526 --> 00:47:41.126 A:middle
nobody enjoys having the
puzzle solved for them.

00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:42.076 A:middle
That's not fun.

00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:45.806 A:middle
You want to give people a
chance to play all on their own

00:47:45.876 --> 00:47:47.906 A:middle
and then watch for clues
they might be stuck.

00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:52.636 A:middle
And that's when you
offer the help.

00:47:52.816 --> 00:47:56.136 A:middle
With "Leo's Fortune," if you
try a number of times to get

00:47:56.136 --> 00:47:58.716 A:middle
over this very basic obstacle
and you don't make it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:00.016 --> 00:48:02.046 A:middle
they give you the option
of onscreen controls.

00:48:02.886 --> 00:48:05.076 A:middle
Again, they only
do this if it looks

00:48:05.076 --> 00:48:07.666 A:middle
like you're struggling
with that first jump.

00:48:09.116 --> 00:48:11.166 A:middle
"The Room Two" also
has a great approach.

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:15.716 A:middle
Now, if you haven't played it,
it's a mystery puzzler game.

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.816 A:middle
You're stuck in this room and
you follow clue, after clue,

00:48:18.816 --> 00:48:20.616 A:middle
after clue to make your escape.

00:48:21.266 --> 00:48:23.386 A:middle
Now, if you've been
struggling for a long time,

00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:26.556 A:middle
and you still didn't manage
to accomplish the next thing,

00:48:27.426 --> 00:48:29.196 A:middle
they give you this
question mark button.

00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:35.986 A:middle
And this is great because it's
giving you the option of a hint.

00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:37.676 A:middle
Because it's true,
I might be stuck,

00:48:38.876 --> 00:48:40.606 A:middle
or I may have been distracted.

00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:44.626 A:middle
My dog may have started barking,
or someone needed something

00:48:44.626 --> 00:48:45.806 A:middle
and walked into the room.

00:48:46.386 --> 00:48:49.186 A:middle
So that's really good because
they're not solving the puzzle

00:48:49.256 --> 00:48:50.406 A:middle
for me.

00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:55.316 A:middle
However, if I am really
stuck and I'm at the point

00:48:55.316 --> 00:48:57.556 A:middle
of walking away, it's
enough to keep me engaged,

00:48:57.556 --> 00:48:58.716 A:middle
to keep me moving forward.

00:48:59.276 --> 00:49:03.126 A:middle
And instead of giving away the
answers, they give you clues


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.276 --> 00:49:03.126 A:middle
And instead of giving away the
answers, they give you clues

00:49:03.126 --> 00:49:04.996 A:middle
so you don't have
to feel guilty.

00:49:04.996 --> 00:49:06.516 A:middle
It doesn't have to
feel like cheating.

00:49:06.596 --> 00:49:08.526 A:middle
You don't have to feel
bad about it, right?

00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:11.936 A:middle
And this doesn't devalue
the achievements of people

00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:12.956 A:middle
who didn't use the clues.

00:49:13.496 --> 00:49:14.676 A:middle
We're all going to
get to the end.

00:49:15.826 --> 00:49:17.836 A:middle
Some of us are going
to get there faster,

00:49:18.186 --> 00:49:19.496 A:middle
but this works out really well.

00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:22.066 A:middle
Everyone can feel really good
when they finish the game.

00:49:22.696 --> 00:49:26.706 A:middle
And these kind of hints can
be helpful with apps too.

00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:29.376 A:middle
This is "Sky Guide," another one

00:49:29.376 --> 00:49:31.556 A:middle
of this year's Apple
Design Award winners.

00:49:32.516 --> 00:49:35.926 A:middle
You can pan all around the sky
and see the constellations,

00:49:36.286 --> 00:49:40.906 A:middle
planets, comets, all sorts
of stars, and they have a ton

00:49:40.906 --> 00:49:45.166 A:middle
of information about almost
anything in the night sky.

00:49:46.496 --> 00:49:48.786 A:middle
Now, you might think that
tapping on a star is the way

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:50.046 A:middle
to get that information,

00:49:50.046 --> 00:49:53.046 A:middle
but that would make it a
little too easy to navigate

00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:55.206 A:middle
into the details view
- if you're going there

00:49:55.206 --> 00:49:57.356 A:middle
on accident then you'd
be getting frustrated.

00:49:58.226 --> 00:50:03.116 A:middle
So instead, the right way to
get to that information is

00:49:58.226 --> 00:50:03.116 A:middle
So instead, the right way to
get to that information is

00:50:03.116 --> 00:50:06.006 A:middle
by selecting a star and
then tapping that "i" button

00:50:06.006 --> 00:50:07.306 A:middle
on the right side of the screen.

00:50:07.876 --> 00:50:13.476 A:middle
And if you tap a star
again to try and select it

00:50:13.476 --> 00:50:16.346 A:middle
or get more information,
you get a pulsing animation,

00:50:16.466 --> 00:50:19.296 A:middle
and that glow calls
attention to itself.

00:50:20.436 --> 00:50:22.756 A:middle
They're using animation
to attract your attention.

00:50:22.756 --> 00:50:25.376 A:middle
And that's really elegant

00:50:25.496 --> 00:50:28.526 A:middle
because if you double-tap
a star thinking oh,

00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:31.406 A:middle
maybe I didn't tap hard enough
or maybe I need to tap twice,

00:50:31.866 --> 00:50:35.036 A:middle
they pulse every time you
tap, to get your attention.

00:50:35.796 --> 00:50:39.586 A:middle
So they're keeping an eye
out for you that you're stuck

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.866 A:middle
and trying to pull you
in the right direction,

00:50:42.236 --> 00:50:45.546 A:middle
get you back on track.

00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:48.046 A:middle
And all of these tips that
I've shown you are really just

00:50:48.046 --> 00:50:50.006 A:middle
about anticipating
people's needs.

00:50:50.786 --> 00:50:53.546 A:middle
Telling people what they
need to know in the moment

00:50:53.546 --> 00:50:55.376 A:middle
that they need to know it.

00:50:55.516 --> 00:50:59.206 A:middle
Think about the restaurant again
that I talked about earlier.

00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:02.106 A:middle
You don't want to see the
dessert menu before you've been


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:02.106 A:middle
You don't want to see the
dessert menu before you've been

00:51:02.166 --> 00:51:04.856 A:middle
seated or while you're
eating your appetizer.

00:51:05.136 --> 00:51:06.596 A:middle
You want it when you
finish your meal.

00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:10.696 A:middle
And when you have good
service at a restaurant,

00:51:10.696 --> 00:51:13.126 A:middle
it means the wait staff is
there when you need them,

00:51:13.376 --> 00:51:14.836 A:middle
and they're not there
when you don't.

00:51:16.166 --> 00:51:18.816 A:middle
And that's exactly the
approach you want to take

00:51:18.816 --> 00:51:20.816 A:middle
if you've got help inside
of your application.

00:51:22.436 --> 00:51:24.726 A:middle
And "Secret" is really
one of the best examples

00:51:24.726 --> 00:51:26.016 A:middle
that I've seen out there.

00:51:26.596 --> 00:51:28.606 A:middle
It's an anonymous
social networking app.

00:51:28.916 --> 00:51:31.616 A:middle
So what this means is that you
see posts from your friends,

00:51:31.616 --> 00:51:33.996 A:middle
but you don't know who they are
because everything is anonymous.

00:51:34.806 --> 00:51:37.406 A:middle
That's a really interesting
way to interact with people.

00:51:38.306 --> 00:51:41.896 A:middle
Now, the first time your feed
loads, they're explaining

00:51:41.896 --> 00:51:43.916 A:middle
in a moment exactly
the information

00:51:43.916 --> 00:51:44.656 A:middle
that you need to know.

00:51:46.076 --> 00:51:48.406 A:middle
So here, I'm scrolling
through my feed,

00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:50.736 A:middle
and I don't know
anyone in the UK.

00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:53.436 A:middle
Oh, it's traveled
across friends.

00:51:54.336 --> 00:51:56.426 A:middle
Speaking of friends,
where are my friends?

00:51:57.916 --> 00:52:00.356 A:middle
Oh, I didn't have
my phone number yet.

Oh, I didn't have
my phone number yet.

00:52:00.946 --> 00:52:04.376 A:middle
Shoot. And what's the
star mean, I wonder?

00:52:05.086 --> 00:52:06.126 A:middle
It's a popular one.

00:52:06.826 --> 00:52:08.066 A:middle
And when you go to Comments,

00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:12.246 A:middle
they explain why there
are all these icons here.

00:52:12.806 --> 00:52:15.536 A:middle
They're just letting you know
about commenting because that's

00:52:15.536 --> 00:52:16.736 A:middle
where you are in the app.

00:52:17.506 --> 00:52:19.206 A:middle
They're not telling
you about navigation

00:52:19.206 --> 00:52:21.206 A:middle
or what does the star mean
and things like that -

00:52:21.206 --> 00:52:22.676 A:middle
they're focused on commenting.

00:52:23.876 --> 00:52:25.906 A:middle
And it's worth noting that
they're just giving one piece

00:52:25.906 --> 00:52:29.586 A:middle
of information at
a time as well.

00:52:29.706 --> 00:52:31.496 A:middle
And if you're the
first to comment,

00:52:31.766 --> 00:52:35.666 A:middle
they've populated their
empty view with information.

00:52:36.036 --> 00:52:37.666 A:middle
You know that comments
are going to be there.

00:52:38.256 --> 00:52:40.546 A:middle
This little gentle push
should be the first one,

00:52:41.596 --> 00:52:45.316 A:middle
and I just love that the
placeholder text encourages you

00:52:45.316 --> 00:52:46.816 A:middle
to say something kind.

00:52:47.306 --> 00:52:48.006 A:middle
It's great.

00:52:48.656 --> 00:52:52.886 A:middle
So think about what people need
to know based on where they are

00:52:52.886 --> 00:52:56.276 A:middle
in your app or game, how
long they've been using it,

00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:58.786 A:middle
and anticipating people's
needs is just another way

00:52:58.786 --> 00:53:00.416 A:middle
that you're going to
be able to provide help


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:58.786 --> 00:53:00.416 A:middle
that you're going to
be able to provide help

00:53:00.706 --> 00:53:02.376 A:middle
without it feeling like help.

00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:08.756 A:middle
And be sure to take the
opportunity to inspire people

00:53:09.066 --> 00:53:11.306 A:middle
like "Secret" did with
"say something kind."

00:53:11.956 --> 00:53:17.246 A:middle
Now, a lot of people use Siri
to set reminders or send text

00:53:17.246 --> 00:53:20.636 A:middle
or check sports scores,
things like that, but remember

00:53:20.636 --> 00:53:22.696 A:middle
when you found out that
Siri would answer questions

00:53:22.696 --> 00:53:24.066 A:middle
like this?

00:53:24.616 --> 00:53:27.736 A:middle
I mean, all of a sudden, this
convenience feature is a source

00:53:27.736 --> 00:53:29.226 A:middle
of entertainment as well.

00:53:30.076 --> 00:53:34.606 A:middle
It's unexpected and fun, and
now Siri is more valuable to me

00:53:35.356 --> 00:53:37.326 A:middle
because she's not just
a utility anymore.

00:53:37.326 --> 00:53:38.286 A:middle
She's comedy.

00:53:38.736 --> 00:53:39.786 A:middle
She's flattery.

00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:40.836 A:middle
It's great.

00:53:42.296 --> 00:53:45.346 A:middle
People might come to your app
with a certain expectation

00:53:46.326 --> 00:53:49.356 A:middle
about getting one thing
done, but when they discover

00:53:49.356 --> 00:53:51.126 A:middle
that your app can
do more for them,

00:53:51.356 --> 00:53:53.926 A:middle
well then the app becomes
even more valuable.

00:53:55.036 --> 00:53:57.806 A:middle
It's going to feel
like a bonus prize.

00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:02.416 A:middle
And that's why with Siri, we
give you a lot of suggestions


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:02.416 A:middle
And that's why with Siri, we
give you a lot of suggestions

00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:03.956 A:middle
of things that you can ask her.

00:54:04.056 --> 00:54:06.546 A:middle
You just tap that question
mark button and you're going

00:54:06.546 --> 00:54:09.456 A:middle
to get a long list of things
that you can ask Siri.

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:13.756 A:middle
And you may have known that you
can use Siri to initiate calls

00:54:13.756 --> 00:54:17.056 A:middle
or have her make an
appointment on your calendar,

00:54:17.056 --> 00:54:20.216 A:middle
but did you know that she also
will book restaurants for you

00:54:20.776 --> 00:54:22.086 A:middle
or tell you movie times?

00:54:22.336 --> 00:54:25.036 A:middle
I mean, this list goes
on, and on and on.

00:54:27.076 --> 00:54:29.376 A:middle
"Path" does it with some
of their onboarding.

00:54:29.836 --> 00:54:32.956 A:middle
And they're a private social
network, so they really need you

00:54:32.956 --> 00:54:35.086 A:middle
to register because
everything is oriented

00:54:35.086 --> 00:54:36.436 A:middle
around your personal
information.

00:54:37.436 --> 00:54:40.736 A:middle
But before registering, they're
giving you a series of screens

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:44.176 A:middle
that covers both the
features of the apps

00:54:44.316 --> 00:54:46.886 A:middle
but also how you might
want to use them.

00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:50.616 A:middle
A lot of people go to "Path"
thinking they're going to use it

00:54:50.616 --> 00:54:52.456 A:middle
for work, but now, they're
going to be thinking

00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:55.226 A:middle
about how they can use it
in their personal life, too.

00:54:57.516 --> 00:55:01.096 A:middle
Or with Pinterest, they've
got a similar approach.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:57.516 --> 00:55:01.096 A:middle
Or with Pinterest, they've
got a similar approach.

00:55:01.696 --> 00:55:03.236 A:middle
I mean, maybe you
came to Pinterest

00:55:03.236 --> 00:55:06.296 A:middle
because you were interested
in nail art or wanting recipes

00:55:06.296 --> 00:55:08.706 A:middle
for a dinner party, but
now you're also thinking

00:55:08.706 --> 00:55:09.806 A:middle
about gardening.

00:55:10.806 --> 00:55:11.716 A:middle
And then you're thinking

00:55:11.716 --> 00:55:13.846 A:middle
about what else Pinterest
can be used for.

00:55:14.496 --> 00:55:19.106 A:middle
So step away from that
traditional idea of help,

00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:22.006 A:middle
reference manuals, and think

00:55:22.006 --> 00:55:24.366 A:middle
about how you can
anticipate people's needs.

00:55:25.506 --> 00:55:27.726 A:middle
Putting instructions
in empty containers

00:55:27.726 --> 00:55:30.186 A:middle
and showing supporting
information inline,

00:55:30.706 --> 00:55:33.446 A:middle
it's about telling people what
they need to know in that moment

00:55:33.966 --> 00:55:37.036 A:middle
that they need to know it
- like the perfect service

00:55:37.096 --> 00:55:39.976 A:middle
in a restaurant, there
when you need them

00:55:39.976 --> 00:55:42.956 A:middle
and invisible when you don't.

00:55:43.066 --> 00:55:45.006 A:middle
When you're doing all
of that, don't forget

00:55:45.036 --> 00:55:47.166 A:middle
to take the opportunity
to inspire people,

00:55:47.166 --> 00:55:49.056 A:middle
because that increased
knowledge,

00:55:49.316 --> 00:55:51.286 A:middle
that increased utility
about your app,

00:55:51.286 --> 00:55:53.566 A:middle
it's going to mean
increased value.

00:55:54.376 --> 00:55:59.386 A:middle
So if you only take a few things
away from this talk today,

00:55:59.546 --> 00:56:04.426 A:middle
in summary, only require
people to register

in summary, only require
people to register

00:56:04.426 --> 00:56:06.416 A:middle
when it's absolutely necessary.

00:56:07.736 --> 00:56:10.426 A:middle
Ask yourselves if you really
need onboarding at all.

00:56:11.106 --> 00:56:13.056 A:middle
If they don't need any
information before getting

00:56:13.056 --> 00:56:15.806 A:middle
started, then just let them
get started, otherwise,

00:56:16.016 --> 00:56:17.496 A:middle
tell them what they need
to know and then get

00:56:17.496 --> 00:56:18.536 A:middle
out of the way quickly.

00:56:19.766 --> 00:56:21.836 A:middle
Teach through actions
because people are going

00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:23.066 A:middle
to learn better by doing.

00:56:24.816 --> 00:56:28.306 A:middle
Anticipate people's
needs, and don't forget

00:56:28.306 --> 00:56:30.046 A:middle
to take the opportunity
to inspire.

00:56:31.206 --> 00:56:34.256 A:middle
Now, I hope that you'll leave
today with a new impression

00:56:34.256 --> 00:56:36.886 A:middle
about help and how it can
work in your apps or games

00:56:37.646 --> 00:56:40.166 A:middle
and that I hope that I've
inspired you all with how

00:56:40.166 --> 00:56:41.766 A:middle
to make a great first
impression.

00:56:42.586 --> 00:56:46.926 A:middle
So this is my email, and I
would genuinely like to hear

00:56:46.926 --> 00:56:49.326 A:middle
about changes that
you make to your app

00:56:49.326 --> 00:56:51.416 A:middle
and how that's changed
the overall experience.

00:56:52.146 --> 00:56:54.356 A:middle
We've got a lot more
information about design

about making a great game,

00:57:06.706 --> 00:57:10.056 A:middle

00:57:10.056 --> 00:57:11.086 A:middle
of those animation tips.
