00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:20.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.616 A:middle
My name is Katie
Skinner and I work

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.436 A:middle
at Apple Product
Security and Privacy.

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:28.756 A:middle
That means I work with teams
all across Apple on user privacy

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:29.936 A:middle
and protecting our users.

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:34.696 A:middle
This includes our
platforms like iOS, Siri,

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.386 A:middle
and applications like iPhoto.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.586 A:middle
Today in this session, David
Stites and I are going to talk

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:45.336 A:middle
about ways you can protect your
users' privacy and changes made

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:48.306 A:middle
to the Apple ecosystem
to improve user privacy.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:51.486 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:57.756 A:middle
So, we're going to start
out talking about privacy

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.996 A:middle
and reputation, identifiers
in iOS,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.996 A:middle
and reputation, identifiers
in iOS,

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:07.436 A:middle
how to prompt your users well,
new classes for data isolation,

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:09.576 A:middle
and some privacy best practices.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:15.076 A:middle
So, privacy and reputation.

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
Your users are so
important to you.

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:23.376 A:middle
They're the key to your success,
so maintaining your relationship

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:25.676 A:middle
with them is your
most important thing.

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:28.936 A:middle
They're the people
who download your app,

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:31.356 A:middle
tell their friends
how great it is,

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:33.526 A:middle
don't think twice
before uploading photos,

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:36.006 A:middle
or granting you access
to contents.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:38.796 A:middle
Or alternately, those
are the users

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:43.736 A:middle
who will uninstall your
application or think twice

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.036 A:middle
about using location with you.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:51.976 A:middle
So, privacy and how you protect
your users' data is a big part

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:52.706 A:middle
of this.

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:57.316 A:middle
Lately there's been an appetite
in the media for stories

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.816 A:middle
about privacy, from
large stories

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
like Target to smaller ones.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
like Target to smaller ones.

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.436 A:middle
But, they continue to
appear over and over again.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:08.356 A:middle
The best bet is to be
trustworthy with your users

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.706 A:middle
because rebuilding
user trust is hard.

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:15.496 A:middle
It's much more difficult than
maintaining your users' trust.

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:21.166 A:middle
Now, I'm going to talk about the
identifiers available in iOS.

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:24.116 A:middle
There are three purpose-scoped
identifiers.

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:30.786 A:middle
The first one is the application
identifier, NSUUID UUID.

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.906 A:middle
The second one is the
vendor identifier,

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:38.396 A:middle
UIDevice currentDevice,
identifierForVendor.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:41.686 A:middle
The third one, advertising
identifier,

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:45.876 A:middle
UIDevice currentDevice
identifierForAdvertising.

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:50.986 A:middle
Now, I'm not going to talk about
these in a lot of detail today.

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:54.856 A:middle
Last year we talked about
them, how to use them,

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:56.836 A:middle
their behavior, lifetime.

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.736 A:middle
So if you're new to the
platform, you should go and look

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.186 A:middle
at "Protecting User's
Privacy" from last year's WWDC.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.186 A:middle
at "Protecting User's
Privacy" from last year's WWDC.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.236 A:middle
It's a great place to start.

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:08.776 A:middle
Now, this is a great
reference slide to look

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:11.586 A:middle
at when you're thinking
about which identifier to use

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.796 A:middle
for a particular use-case.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.876 A:middle
I'm going to pull
out a couple points.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.956 A:middle
The application identifier
is used

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:21.706 A:middle
to identify something
uniquely within a single app.

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:24.606 A:middle
The vendor identifier
can be used

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:28.116 A:middle
across multiple applications
and it's all in the same device

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.346 A:middle
with the same team ID.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:34.356 A:middle
Now, the application identifier
you need to manage yourself,

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:38.366 A:middle
but the vendor identifier
iOS will manage for you.

00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:42.166 A:middle
The advertising identifier
should be used

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.746 A:middle
for all user tracking
for advertising,

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:46.156 A:middle
or related to advertising.

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:52.306 A:middle
Now, there's been a lot
of discussion about how

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:54.016 A:middle
to use the advertising
identifier,

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:55.666 A:middle
what are the supported
use-cases?

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
But, before we get into that
I want to allay one point

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.626 A:middle
with you guys, is be
clear with your users


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.626 A:middle
with you guys, is be
clear with your users

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.846 A:middle
about how you advertise,

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:06.816 A:middle
especially if you're using
their user data as part

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.256 A:middle
of your advertising practices.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.346 A:middle
You should not cache the
advertising identifier.

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
You need to respect
a user's ability

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.245 A:middle
to reset this identifier.

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:19.565 A:middle
They can reset it under
Settings, Privacy,

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:24.206 A:middle
Advertising using the Reset
Advertising ID button.

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:29.436 A:middle
Also this year, for TestFlight
apps the advertising identifier

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.086 A:middle
will be different each
time you call the API.

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:34.726 A:middle
This is another reason
why you shouldn't count

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:37.646 A:middle
on the advertising identifier
to be a stable value.

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:44.146 A:middle
In iOS we've given users a
choice about how they want

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:45.476 A:middle
to be served advertising

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.346 A:middle
and that really comes
back to Limit Ad Tracking.

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:55.136 A:middle
Before using the advertising
identifier you need

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
to check the value
of Limit Ad Tracking.

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:01.346 A:middle
This is ASIdentifierManager
sharedManager


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:01.346 A:middle
This is ASIdentifierManager
sharedManager

00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:03.396 A:middle
advertisingTrackingEnabled.

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:08.916 A:middle
Note, this may be controlled --

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:10.576 A:middle
this can be controlled
by restrictions,

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
and with Family Sharing this
year this may affect more

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:15.116 A:middle
of your users.

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:19.306 A:middle
Even if you, yourself,
are not writing the code

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:21.216 A:middle
to handle the advertising
identifier

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:24.176 A:middle
and you're using a third
party advertising library,

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:28.066 A:middle
you need to ensure that that
library is also checking Limit

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:31.056 A:middle
Ad Tracking before using
the advertising identifier.

00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:36.626 A:middle
When advertisingTracking
Enabled is set to No,

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:40.886 A:middle
the advertising identifier
is not permitted to be used

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:45.456 A:middle
to collect data for, or to
serve, targeted advertising.

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:51.496 A:middle
You can use it only for
the purposes enumerated

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.136 A:middle
in the iOS Program
License Agreement.

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:58.086 A:middle
This includes frequency
capping, conversion events,

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
fraud detection for advertising,
and debugging for advertising.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
fraud detection for advertising,
and debugging for advertising.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:07.986 A:middle
Note, for fraud detection and
debugging this can only be used,

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.586 A:middle
not for all fraud detection,
not for all debugging,

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
only debugging advertising
issues.

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:19.416 A:middle
This year in iTunes Connect,
now you need to explain

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:22.886 A:middle
and attribute why you're using
the advertising identifier

00:06:22.886 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
for which of these uses.

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:27.076 A:middle
You should select one,
two, or three depending

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:29.506 A:middle
on how you use the
advertising identifier.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
The first one's pretty
clear; serve advertisements.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.876 A:middle
The second one, attribute
app installation,

00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:41.396 A:middle
now once a user installs
your application,

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:44.186 A:middle
this means attributing
that installation

00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.316 A:middle
to an advertisement
they may have seen

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:48.356 A:middle
in a different application.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:53.716 A:middle
The last one, attribute an
action, this could be Coins Bot

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.736 A:middle
or any other in-app purchase.

00:06:56.996 --> 00:07:00.386 A:middle
Attribute that action taken to a
previously served advertisement,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:56.996 --> 00:07:00.386 A:middle
Attribute that action taken to a
previously served advertisement,

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:05.046 A:middle
either within your app
or another application.

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:09.776 A:middle
Now, here's where you go

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:11.726 A:middle
and make these choices
in iTunes Connect.

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:15.356 A:middle
You can see the first thing that
you do is say, "Are you going

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:17.406 A:middle
to use the advertising
identifier, or not?"

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:21.556 A:middle
Then select which of the
three choices or more than one

00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:24.146 A:middle
that you'll be using the
advertising identifier for.

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:26.716 A:middle
And then lastly, you must say

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:29.606 A:middle
that you will check Limit
Ad Tracking before using the

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:30.786 A:middle
advertising identifier.

00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:37.856 A:middle
Now, I'm going to talk about a
couple changes coming to iOS 8

00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
and OS X Yosemite that
are privacy-related.

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:45.996 A:middle
The first one's Family Sharing.

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:50.186 A:middle
This means that this year
there'll be an increased number

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:53.096 A:middle
of child accounts within
the Apple ecosystem.

00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:57.386 A:middle
There's a great talk by Chris
Espinoza [assumed spelling]

00:07:57.386 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
right after ours that will go
further into the implications


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.386 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
right after ours that will go
further into the implications

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
that you should be thinking
about as a result of this,

00:08:03.356 --> 00:08:05.596 A:middle
so I would encourage everyone
to stick around after our talk

00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:06.746 A:middle
to hear "Kids and Apps".

00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:10.276 A:middle
He'll talk a little bit
more about the relevant laws

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.076 A:middle
like COPPA to be
thinking about for this,

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:19.436 A:middle
for the additional number
of children on this system.

00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:22.646 A:middle
So, here's the talk,
right in here.

00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:26.316 A:middle
In iOS 8 the Mac address
during probe requests

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:29.436 A:middle
and probe responses, as
well as region monitoring,

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.246 A:middle
will be locally administrated
and random.

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:36.376 A:middle
This means if you
interact or design a piece

00:08:36.376 --> 00:08:38.525 A:middle
of external hardware
you should not count

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:41.616 A:middle
on a stable Mac address
until after authentication.

00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
Go test some iOS state

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.616 A:middle
and understand the impact
this may have for you.

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:51.506 A:middle
This year in Safari
there's a new setting.

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:54.806 A:middle
This will allow users to
block third party cookies

00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:59.446 A:middle
and it is available
both on iOS and OS X.

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:02.386 A:middle
Now, I assume most of
you, if not all of you,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:02.386 A:middle
Now, I assume most of
you, if not all of you,

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:04.226 A:middle
in the audience have
a web presence,

00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:07.726 A:middle
even if it's only a website
that points and has a link

00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:09.906 A:middle
to the App Store, you
have a web presence.

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:13.546 A:middle
So, go on iOS, enable
this setting,

00:09:13.546 --> 00:09:14.676 A:middle
and visit your web presence.

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:18.056 A:middle
Understand the impact that this
will have on you and ensure

00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:20.686 A:middle
that your users will still be
able to do the things they need

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:25.826 A:middle
to do on your website; go to the
App Store, FAQ, whatever it is.

00:09:26.936 --> 00:09:29.606 A:middle
Here you can see where you
can go and find this setting.

00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:32.586 A:middle
On iOS it's under
Settings, Safari,

00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
in the Privacy and
Security Section.

00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:38.986 A:middle
On OS X you can find this

00:09:39.276 --> 00:09:42.266 A:middle
under Safari Preferences
on the Privacy tab.

00:09:42.606 --> 00:09:44.866 A:middle
Note, this setting
is not on by default

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.206 A:middle
but this is a choice
that users can make.

00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:54.816 A:middle
Also in iOS, we've now
given the ability for you

00:09:54.816 --> 00:09:56.666 A:middle
to utilize the people picker

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.656 A:middle
without requesting
Contacts access

00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:01.696 A:middle
to the full address
book from your users.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:01.696 A:middle
to the full address
book from your users.

00:10:02.056 --> 00:10:03.366 A:middle
This is a great win for apps

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.886 A:middle
that don't need the
whole address book,

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:08.186 A:middle
that maybe only you
need to send an invite

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
to one person you're
going to share every

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:12.036 A:middle
so often with a single user.

00:10:12.796 --> 00:10:17.306 A:middle
But note, this will provide only
a static -- static information.

00:10:17.306 --> 00:10:21.946 A:middle
If the user then later
goes and decides to change

00:10:22.046 --> 00:10:24.376 A:middle
or update this contact
you will not receive any

00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:25.436 A:middle
of that information.

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
In a future seed, some of the
iOS 7 delegate methods are going

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:35.716 A:middle
to be deprecated so you
need to update and migrate

00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:37.386 A:middle
if you're currently
using the people picker.

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.356 A:middle
We have a great sample code
project for you to go and check

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:44.456 A:middle
out and see how to
implement on iOS 8.

00:10:44.456 --> 00:10:49.136 A:middle
These are the delegate methods
that will be deprecated.

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:52.166 A:middle
ABPeoplePicker
NavigationController Delegate

00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:54.316 A:middle
peoplePicker
NavigationController

00:10:54.496 --> 00:10:56.596 A:middle
shouldContinueAfterSelecting
Person

00:10:56.966 --> 00:10:59.006 A:middle
and shouldContinue
AfterSelectingPerson

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
:property:identifier.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
:property:identifier.

00:11:02.376 --> 00:11:05.346 A:middle
And, we also have some new
properties and delegates

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:09.326 A:middle
in iOS 8; ABPeoplePicker
NavigationController

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:15.176 A:middle
.predicateForEnablingPerson,
predicateFor SelectionOfPerson,

00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:17.466 A:middle
and predicateFor
SelectionOfProperty.

00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:20.806 A:middle
And then new delegates
are ABPeoplePicker

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.306 A:middle
NaviagionControllerDelegate
peoplePicker

00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:26.706 A:middle
NavigationController
:didSelectPerson

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:29.676 A:middle
and didSelectPerson
:property :identifier.

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:32.146 A:middle
So go and update,
and migrate early.

00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:37.736 A:middle
Now, I've gone through several
different privacy changes

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:40.466 A:middle
and what I want to encourage
everyone here to do is

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:42.936 A:middle
if they're not already
have a device on iOS 8

00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:45.156 A:middle
and OS X Yosemite, update now.

00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:48.196 A:middle
Understand the impact these
changes will have on you

00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:51.566 A:middle
because you have a great
experience for your users today,

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:54.646 A:middle
and you don't want to mess it
up as they move and migrate

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:57.116 A:middle
to iOS 8; keep a
consistent great experience.

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
hand it over to David,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
hand it over to David,

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.576 A:middle
who's going to talk more
about the keys to prompting

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:05.546 A:middle
with purpose and how to
be successful at that.

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:11.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:13.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you and good afternoon.

00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:15.586 A:middle
As Katie mentioned, I'm
going to talk to you

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:19.456 A:middle
about both prompting your users
with purpose and then dive

00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:25.636 A:middle
into data isolation and how
it works on both iOS and OS X.

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:29.586 A:middle
Prompting with purpose means
designing the experience your

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:31.476 A:middle
users will receive
when they're confronted

00:12:31.476 --> 00:12:32.736 A:middle
with a privacy dialog.

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:36.826 A:middle
There are five core
principles that form the basis

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:41.536 A:middle
for prompting with purpose;
consent, transparency, context,

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:44.526 A:middle
clarity, and minimization,
and we'll talk

00:12:44.526 --> 00:12:46.586 A:middle
about all of those coming up.

00:12:47.386 --> 00:12:50.336 A:middle
The first principle is consent.

00:12:51.016 --> 00:12:53.466 A:middle
Consent is getting
your user's approval

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.836 A:middle
to access their user data.

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:56.646 A:middle
This should already
be familiar to you.

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:59.836 A:middle
The model that Apple has
chosen to adopt is the Just

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:03.026 A:middle
in Time model, meaning that
consent is only presented


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:03.026 A:middle
in Time model, meaning that
consent is only presented

00:13:03.026 --> 00:13:06.286 A:middle
to the user at the exact
time that the access occurs.

00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:10.706 A:middle
We think that Just in Time
access is a key differentiating

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:12.006 A:middle
feature of our platform.

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:14.496 A:middle
If the user decides
to allow access,

00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:15.486 A:middle
then you'll get data back.

00:13:15.856 --> 00:13:18.756 A:middle
And, if they decide not to allow
access, you won't get anything.

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:23.356 A:middle
Transparency is the
second principle.

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:26.386 A:middle
Transparency is complementary
to consent

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:28.106 A:middle
in that it answers the question

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:30.746 A:middle
of why an app needs
access to user data.

00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:33.696 A:middle
Apps are given a dedicated space

00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:35.786 A:middle
to tell users called
a purpose string.

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:38.266 A:middle
And purpose strings
are as an apps chance

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:41.706 A:middle
to explain the proposition
value of allowing that access.

00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:44.926 A:middle
If the user understands that
there might be more willing

00:13:44.926 --> 00:13:46.616 A:middle
to allow your application
access.

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:49.586 A:middle
In this example, Calendar
wants to use Location

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:52.376 A:middle
to estimate travel times and
improve location searches.

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:58.226 A:middle
The third principle is context.

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.676 A:middle
Context is making it clear
to your users what action led


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.676 A:middle
Context is making it clear
to your users what action led

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:03.906 A:middle
to the consent dialog.

00:14:04.536 --> 00:14:05.676 A:middle
Consider this example.

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:07.546 A:middle
Here we have the App Store.

00:14:07.906 --> 00:14:10.626 A:middle
And, when the user
goes to the Near Me tab

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:15.596 A:middle
and taps the Show Popular and
Near Me link they're presented

00:14:15.596 --> 00:14:18.906 A:middle
with this dialog saying the app
would like to use their location

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:21.456 A:middle
to find relevant apps near them.

00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:27.816 A:middle
Contrast this with a conga line
of alerts that are presented

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:30.726 A:middle
to the user right when the
application first opens;

00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:32.656 A:middle
not a great user experience.

00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:36.086 A:middle
Conga lines don't work
because they're not presented

00:14:36.086 --> 00:14:38.326 A:middle
at the correct time so
make sure you choose

00:14:38.326 --> 00:14:41.936 A:middle
to present yours at
the correct time.

00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:45.976 A:middle
The fourth principle is clarity.

00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:49.506 A:middle
Clarity is distilling the
purpose of your request

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:52.686 A:middle
down to its essence because it
helps users build clear mental

00:14:52.686 --> 00:14:56.116 A:middle
models about what you're going
to do with their user data.

00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:56.966 A:middle
You can think of this

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.876 A:middle
as improving the why,
and when, and where.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:03.786 A:middle
Give the user a guide
of what they can expect

00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:04.876 A:middle
from your application.

00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:07.756 A:middle
Be concise, but include
sufficient detail.

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.916 A:middle
In this example, Reminders
clearly states what it's using

00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:11.696 A:middle
Location for.

00:15:13.916 --> 00:15:17.036 A:middle
The last and fifth
principle is minimization,

00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:18.446 A:middle
and this one's super simple

00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:21.236 A:middle
because it's exactly
what it sounds like.

00:15:21.446 --> 00:15:24.866 A:middle
If you don't need access to that
data then you shouldn't ask.

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:31.106 A:middle
Scared users are more
likely to tap Don't Allow.

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:34.966 A:middle
All of the consent dialogs
support a purpose string,

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.546 A:middle
and their use is
highly encouraged

00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:39.306 A:middle
because it makes what
you're going to do

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.646 A:middle
with the user data
very transparent.

00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:46.426 A:middle
All of the data classes
support one purpose string,

00:15:46.566 --> 00:15:50.076 A:middle
except for Location Services
in iOS 8, which supports two,

00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:52.386 A:middle
and we'll talk about
that coming up.

00:15:52.656 --> 00:15:54.156 A:middle
You can set these
purpose strings

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.086 A:middle
in your application's
info.plist.

00:15:56.476 --> 00:15:58.836 A:middle
And for those of you who
localize your applications,

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.716 A:middle
you can set the localized
versions


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.716 A:middle
you can set the localized
versions

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:02.526 A:middle
in Localizeable.strings.

00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:07.956 A:middle
What you need to do is
you need to go to X code,

00:16:08.146 --> 00:16:11.226 A:middle
select your target,
select the info.plist,

00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:13.976 A:middle
and then fill out the strings.

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:17.606 A:middle
You should look for the
privacy-data class keys.

00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:22.706 A:middle
Now, X code is simply a
frontend to the info.plist so,

00:16:22.706 --> 00:16:25.716 A:middle
if you want to, you can always
edit the info.plist manually.

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:28.816 A:middle
In this example we see we have a
new application here that wants

00:16:28.816 --> 00:16:32.796 A:middle
to access Camera and Microphone
so that they can help you record

00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:34.946 A:middle
that new music video
for your album.

00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:41.406 A:middle
Now, there are several new
purpose string keys on iOS,

00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:46.366 A:middle
including Location, Camera,
HealthKit, and Motion Activity.

00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:49.336 A:middle
The reason Motion
Activity is listed here is

00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:53.406 A:middle
because it was announced
after WWDC last year.

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:57.296 A:middle
You can always find the full
list of purpose string keys

00:16:57.716 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
in the Information Property
List Key Reference located


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.716 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
in the Information Property
List Key Reference located

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:02.236 A:middle
on the Apple Developer website.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:08.386 A:middle
When a user wants to go manage
their privacy settings on iOS,

00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:11.945 A:middle
they understand that they need
to look in the Settings app,

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:14.965 A:middle
then Privacy, and then
look for the data class

00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:15.886 A:middle
that they want to manage.

00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:21.076 A:middle
Similarly, on OS X users will go
to System Preferences, Security

00:17:21.076 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
and Privacy, then Privacy.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.876 A:middle
This is what Apple and
developers have tried

00:17:25.876 --> 00:17:27.286 A:middle
to communicate with users.

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:30.106 A:middle
However, users may want

00:17:30.106 --> 00:17:32.406 A:middle
to update their privacy
settings from time to time.

00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:35.186 A:middle
Perhaps your application
came out with a new feature

00:17:35.186 --> 00:17:36.416 A:middle
and they want to
take advantage of it,

00:17:37.126 --> 00:17:39.446 A:middle
or perhaps they've just simply
changed their mind on one

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:40.616 A:middle
of their privacy settings.

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:45.276 A:middle
We're excited to give you
a brand new ability today

00:17:45.616 --> 00:17:48.426 A:middle
to send users directly
to their privacy settings

00:17:48.616 --> 00:17:49.826 A:middle
so that they can manage them.

00:17:51.186 --> 00:17:55.176 A:middle
You can do that with
UIApplication sharedApplication

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:57.966 A:middle
openURL and then pass it a URL

00:17:57.966 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
with a string UIApplication
OpenSettings URLString.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.966 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
with a string UIApplication
OpenSettings URLString.

00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:07.026 A:middle
This is going to
drop them directly

00:18:07.026 --> 00:18:08.256 A:middle
into their settings bundle.

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:11.286 A:middle
For each application
installed on iOS 8,

00:18:11.636 --> 00:18:14.146 A:middle
the device will now have
their own settings entries,

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:16.616 A:middle
as well as full privacy
settings.

00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:20.016 A:middle
Users can go to these settings
and manage those settings.

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:23.366 A:middle
If your application already
has a settings bundle,

00:18:23.746 --> 00:18:25.826 A:middle
then these entries
will be prepended to it

00:18:26.716 --> 00:18:30.096 A:middle
so you don't have to worry
about losing your settings.

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:37.166 A:middle
All of the things
that we've talked

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:40.046 A:middle
about so far form the
principles for data isolation.

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.316 A:middle
For the developers
who are new out there,

00:18:42.316 --> 00:18:46.036 A:middle
data isolation is a technical
design where the OS intervenes

00:18:46.036 --> 00:18:48.576 A:middle
between an application
and the user's data

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:49.866 A:middle
on behalf of the user.

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:53.826 A:middle
This occurs outside the address
space of your process, however,

00:18:53.826 --> 00:18:56.036 A:middle
it's completely transparent
to your application.

00:18:56.686 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
Just simply calling the existing
APIs will help you gather


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:56.686 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
Just simply calling the existing
APIs will help you gather

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:02.006 A:middle
consent and inform the user.

00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:05.366 A:middle
If they decide to
allow the application

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.076 A:middle
to access the data,
you'll get data back.

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:08.966 A:middle
And, if they don't allow access,

00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:11.046 A:middle
then you will receive
nothing back.

00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:17.006 A:middle
There are several new data
classes and updated data classes

00:19:17.006 --> 00:19:21.836 A:middle
on iOS 8, including
Location, Contacts, Camera,

00:19:21.946 --> 00:19:25.646 A:middle
which is now worldwide, Motion
Activity, and HealthKit.

00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:32.286 A:middle
OS X Yosemite supports all the
same data classes that it did

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:36.626 A:middle
in OS X Mavericks;
Location, Contacts, Calendars,

00:19:36.626 --> 00:19:37.926 A:middle
Reminders, and Social.

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.586 A:middle
However, there were no
new additions or updates.

00:19:44.256 --> 00:19:46.486 A:middle
If you're already
shipping an application

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:47.616 A:middle
on the App Store, that's great!

00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:51.746 A:middle
This data isolation applies to
your application from day-one.

00:19:51.746 --> 00:19:53.216 A:middle
You don't have to recompile

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:55.506 A:middle
or resubmit your
application to the App Store.

00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:58.266 A:middle
However, certain changes
can help you improve the

00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.396 A:middle
user experience.

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:02.516 A:middle
For example, if you
are accessing Camera,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:02.516 A:middle
For example, if you
are accessing Camera,

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:05.146 A:middle
new this year we've added
that to data isolation,

00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:08.326 A:middle
so additional UI might
be helpful to explain

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:11.016 A:middle
to the user why they're
receiving a black screen,

00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:13.306 A:middle
or essentially all zeroes
in their video stream.

00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:18.246 A:middle
Also, adding purpose strings can
help clarify why you need access

00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:21.366 A:middle
to this data.

00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:23.776 A:middle
So, now that we know
what data isolation is,

00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:28.696 A:middle
let's briefly discuss what
that looks like on OS X.

00:20:30.486 --> 00:20:35.146 A:middle
On OS X, when an application
calls the purpose specific API,

00:20:35.806 --> 00:20:37.736 A:middle
the OS will handle that request

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.406 A:middle
and present the dialog
to the user.

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:43.046 A:middle
For example, if you call
ABAddressBook sharedAddressBook

00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:46.166 A:middle
ABPerson alloc init then

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:48.746 A:middle
that will call the system
to pop up the dialog.

00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:51.686 A:middle
On OS X the calls
are synchronous.

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:55.006 A:middle
So, you're going to want to
use Grand Central Dispatch

00:20:55.316 --> 00:20:58.006 A:middle
and wrap the invocation
in a block

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:00.816 A:middle
to keep the UI responsive
while your user decides.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:00.816 A:middle
to keep the UI responsive
while your user decides.

00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:03.846 A:middle
After the user has made
their initial decision,

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
the APIs will return
immediately.

00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:13.396 A:middle
As I said before, when the
user makes their decision,

00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:15.166 A:middle
if they decide to
grant you access,

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:17.266 A:middle
then you will receive
populated objects.

00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:19.326 A:middle
And, if they decide
not to allow access,

00:21:19.326 --> 00:21:22.086 A:middle
then you will either receive
nil objects or no objects.

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:26.966 A:middle
For applications that use system
services, such as Spotlight

00:21:26.966 --> 00:21:29.706 A:middle
or AppleScript, then
the OS will still prompt

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:30.956 A:middle
on the user's behalf.

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:38.696 A:middle
On OS X applications can
participate in the app Sandbox

00:21:38.816 --> 00:21:41.446 A:middle
and if you ship on the Mac App
Store then you are required

00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:42.266 A:middle
to participate.

00:21:42.556 --> 00:21:44.226 A:middle
For the new developers
out there,

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:48.306 A:middle
the Sandbox is a security design
that isolates your process

00:21:48.376 --> 00:21:50.286 A:middle
from the other processes
on the system,

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:52.766 A:middle
as well as the operating system.

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.586 A:middle
Applications that are Sandboxed
typically have a tight set

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:58.506 A:middle
of restrictions that
are imposed upon them.

00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:03.536 A:middle
So, if you're going to Sandbox
your application there's going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:03.536 A:middle
So, if you're going to Sandbox
your application there's going

00:22:03.536 --> 00:22:05.166 A:middle
to be more work that
you'll have to do

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.656 A:middle
to get these consent
dialogs to show up.

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
You'll need to add entitlements
to your entitlements plist,

00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:12.966 A:middle
which we'll talk about
here in a second.

00:22:13.856 --> 00:22:16.736 A:middle
An important note is that if
the permissions ever change

00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:18.786 A:middle
in the future while your
application is running,

00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:21.526 A:middle
the system will prompt the
user of whether they want

00:22:21.526 --> 00:22:25.246 A:middle
to terminate the app immediately
or wait until its next launch

00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:26.996 A:middle
to make the Sandbox consistent.

00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:33.776 A:middle
To add the entitlements to
the application all you have

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:37.786 A:middle
to do is go to the
entitlements plist or use Xcode

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:39.796 A:middle
to modify those entitlements.

00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:41.626 A:middle
What you would do
is you would go

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:44.846 A:middle
to the targets My
Application Capabilities,

00:22:45.176 --> 00:22:46.466 A:middle
turn on the App Sandbox,

00:22:47.026 --> 00:22:49.086 A:middle
and then select the
entitlements that you want.

00:22:49.446 --> 00:22:52.226 A:middle
You should only build with the
entitlements that you need.

00:22:52.606 --> 00:22:56.726 A:middle
If you're interested in learning
more about the App Sandbox,

00:22:56.916 --> 00:22:59.916 A:middle
there's a reference at the end
of the talk to a practical guide

00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:03.476 A:middle
to the App Sandbox that
was presented in WWDC 2013.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:03.476 A:middle
to the App Sandbox that
was presented in WWDC 2013.

00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:09.186 A:middle
So now that we've talked
about data isolation on OS X,

00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:13.256 A:middle
let's talk a little bit
about data isolation on iOS

00:23:13.706 --> 00:23:19.866 A:middle
and contrast it to that.

00:23:20.626 --> 00:23:25.976 A:middle
On iOS data isolation
is obligatory

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:29.696 A:middle
because applications are built
on top of the App Sandbox.

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:32.396 A:middle
However, you don't need
to add entitlements

00:23:32.396 --> 00:23:34.556 A:middle
to your application
as you did in OS X.

00:23:35.396 --> 00:23:37.846 A:middle
Also, access is asynchronous

00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:40.456 A:middle
so API calls will
return immediately,

00:23:40.926 --> 00:23:44.406 A:middle
and then data would be returned
via a block or a delegate call.

00:23:47.246 --> 00:23:50.856 A:middle
Unlike OS X, if the user decides
to change the permissions

00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:53.326 A:middle
of your application, then
you will receive a SIGKILL

00:23:53.326 --> 00:23:55.156 A:middle
signal immediately.

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:56.526 A:middle
There is no chance to wait

00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:58.746 A:middle
or have the user
decide at a later time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:03.196 A:middle
You need to be prepared
to handle changes

00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:08.316 A:middle
in permission status via change
notifications and, honestly,

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
this was a good idea anyway

00:24:09.606 --> 00:24:12.526 A:middle
because the user can change
their permissions at any time.

00:24:14.976 --> 00:24:19.746 A:middle
There's multiple ways to trigger
these data consent popups

00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:23.096 A:middle
and all you have to do
is simply call the API.

00:24:24.026 --> 00:24:26.006 A:middle
There's four new APIs in iOS

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:29.416 A:middle
that will trigger these
consents; Location, Photos,

00:24:29.596 --> 00:24:30.906 A:middle
Camera, and HealthKit.

00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:37.956 A:middle
And, we're going to go over
some examples of that right now.

00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:43.226 A:middle
Location Services in iOS 8 now
supports two different modes

00:24:43.296 --> 00:24:47.196 A:middle
of updating device location;
when in use and always.

00:24:47.876 --> 00:24:49.806 A:middle
And the functionality
that is provided

00:24:49.806 --> 00:24:51.886 A:middle
in both sounds similar
to how they're named.

00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:55.926 A:middle
Also, depending on what
targets you want to support

00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:59.036 A:middle
with your binary, you may need
to conditionalize your logic

00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:01.146 A:middle
to call the appropriate methods.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:01.146 A:middle
to call the appropriate methods.

00:25:03.176 --> 00:25:06.806 A:middle
When in Use is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:11.436 A:middle
You're only able to access
the devices location while the

00:25:11.436 --> 00:25:13.086 A:middle
application is in
the foreground.

00:25:14.406 --> 00:25:17.806 A:middle
The API that you would call is
CLLocationManager requestWhenIn

00:25:17.806 --> 00:25:20.916 A:middle
UseAuthorization and
the info.plist key

00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:23.166 A:middle
that you would use
is NSLocationWhen

00:25:23.366 --> 00:25:25.316 A:middle
InUseUsage Description.

00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:28.816 A:middle
This is a more privacy-friendly
mode

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:32.256 A:middle
because applications cannot
update location while they're

00:25:32.256 --> 00:25:33.056 A:middle
in the background.

00:25:33.636 --> 00:25:37.856 A:middle
Additionally, applications won't
have access to functionalities

00:25:37.856 --> 00:25:39.166 A:middle
such as Region Monitoring,

00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:44.566 A:middle
the Significant Location
Change API, or the Visits API.

00:25:45.756 --> 00:25:50.476 A:middle
Also, if your application
implements the UI Capability's

00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:54.176 A:middle
Background modes for
Location, in their plist,

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:57.216 A:middle
then if you start updating
Location in the foreground,

00:25:57.576 --> 00:25:59.966 A:middle
and then serialize the
application to the background,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:03.946 A:middle
then the OS will implicate your
application as using Location

00:26:03.946 --> 00:26:07.406 A:middle
in the background by drawing
a double height status bar.

00:26:08.156 --> 00:26:11.056 A:middle
Here we can see that where
Fitness is using our Location

00:26:11.056 --> 00:26:14.966 A:middle
in the background.

00:26:15.526 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
Always authorization
is the second mode.

00:26:18.496 --> 00:26:21.966 A:middle
Its API is CLLocationManager
requestAlways Authorization

00:26:21.966 --> 00:26:23.976 A:middle
and the info.plist
key that you'll need

00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:27.286 A:middle
to implement is NSLocationAlways
UsageDescription.

00:26:28.046 --> 00:26:32.296 A:middle
You should only try and use
this mode when necessary

00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:35.636 A:middle
because it has an increased
privacy impact to the user

00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:40.736 A:middle
because applications can
start accessing Location data

00:26:40.946 --> 00:26:43.346 A:middle
in the background and
the app has access

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:46.516 A:middle
to the significant Location
Change APIs, the Visits APIs,

00:26:46.896 --> 00:26:49.106 A:middle
as well as the Region
Monitoring APIs.

00:26:49.896 --> 00:26:53.656 A:middle
The default mode
for applications

00:26:53.656 --> 00:26:55.866 A:middle
that are not updated
to take advantage

00:26:55.866 --> 00:26:59.276 A:middle
of these new APIs will
be Always authorization.

00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:04.236 A:middle
And, if you use Always
authorization then the OS will


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:04.236 A:middle
And, if you use Always
authorization then the OS will

00:27:04.236 --> 00:27:07.536 A:middle
occasionally re-prompt the
user for access to Location.

00:27:08.096 --> 00:27:10.046 A:middle
You should only use this mode

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:12.796 A:middle
if you think your users
will thank you for doing so.

00:27:16.476 --> 00:27:21.216 A:middle
So, previously on iOS 7 you
could implement this info.plist

00:27:21.216 --> 00:27:23.596 A:middle
key, NSLocation
UsageDescription.

00:27:24.266 --> 00:27:25.496 A:middle
That's now deprecated.

00:27:26.196 --> 00:27:29.366 A:middle
And, on iOS 8 there are
two new purpose strings,

00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:32.036 A:middle
NSLocationWhen
InUseUsageDescription

00:27:32.416 --> 00:27:35.406 A:middle
and NSLocationAlways
UsageDescription.

00:27:35.936 --> 00:27:40.246 A:middle
You must put one or two of these
plist keys in your info.plist.

00:27:40.706 --> 00:27:43.986 A:middle
Calling the APIs without
these keys will not work.

00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:47.496 A:middle
If you want to target
multiple operating systems

00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:50.726 A:middle
in a single binary then
you may need multiple keys.

00:27:50.726 --> 00:27:55.736 A:middle
So, let's take a look at what
a code example might look

00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:57.016 A:middle
like for this.

00:27:57.856 --> 00:28:01.506 A:middle
On iOS 7 you probably would have
had some code that looks similar


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.856 --> 00:28:01.506 A:middle
On iOS 7 you probably would have
had some code that looks similar

00:28:01.506 --> 00:28:03.546 A:middle
to this, CLLocationManager.

00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:05.056 A:middle
You get a shared manager object

00:28:05.436 --> 00:28:07.796 A:middle
and then you call
startUpdatingLocation.

00:28:09.706 --> 00:28:13.666 A:middle
This is what implicitly prompted
the user for access to location.

00:28:14.496 --> 00:28:17.436 A:middle
In iOS 8 we're changing that so

00:28:17.436 --> 00:28:21.226 A:middle
that you explicitly request
access to a user's Location

00:28:21.226 --> 00:28:23.926 A:middle
by calling requestWhenIn
UseAuthorization.

00:28:24.226 --> 00:28:28.246 A:middle
In this example we see we're
asking the Objective-C runtime,

00:28:28.246 --> 00:28:29.766 A:middle
"Do you respond to
the selector Request

00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:31.056 A:middle
When in Use Authorization?"

00:28:31.366 --> 00:28:34.506 A:middle
And if not, then we call
the old way of doing it.

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:38.016 A:middle
Alternatively, you can
also call requestWhenInUse

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.826 A:middle
or requestAlways Authorization.

00:28:41.446 --> 00:28:44.106 A:middle
Note that if you fail
a particular request,

00:28:44.586 --> 00:28:47.396 A:middle
either Request Always
or Request When in Use,

00:28:47.766 --> 00:28:50.726 A:middle
you can't request the
other mode, you're done.

00:28:51.476 --> 00:28:55.316 A:middle
You can't prompt up or down,
in terms of access rights.

00:28:56.836 --> 00:29:00.756 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about
Location, and the changes


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:56.836 --> 00:29:00.756 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about
Location, and the changes

00:29:00.756 --> 00:29:02.986 A:middle
to Location, and what's new.

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:05.566 A:middle
Here are the important
takeaway points.

00:29:05.966 --> 00:29:08.776 A:middle
There's two new modes
in iOS 8 versus iOS 7,

00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:11.316 A:middle
and there's two new
info.plist keys

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.846 A:middle
that you'll have to implement.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.466 A:middle
While there is a
bunch of implications

00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:21.606 A:middle
to which modes you use, you
should check out what's right

00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:24.316 A:middle
for your application by
going to see "What's New

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:25.996 A:middle
in Core Location"
that was presented

00:29:25.996 --> 00:29:27.216 A:middle
on Tuesday of this week.

00:29:27.686 --> 00:29:33.036 A:middle
The second example I would
like to talk about is Camera.

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
In iOS 8 Camera is a
data isolated data class.

00:29:39.686 --> 00:29:42.086 A:middle
Here, we create an
ABCapture Session,

00:29:42.556 --> 00:29:45.216 A:middle
and then we create
an ABCaptureDevice,

00:29:46.236 --> 00:29:49.516 A:middle
and simply calling the
API AVCapture DeviceInput

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:53.736 A:middle
deviceInput WithDeviceError will
present the dialog to the user.

00:29:54.406 --> 00:29:58.836 A:middle
While the user decides, the
video stream will be all zeroes,

00:29:58.836 --> 00:30:01.596 A:middle
or essentially a black
screen, so you need to be able


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.836 --> 00:30:01.596 A:middle
or essentially a black
screen, so you need to be able

00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:03.096 A:middle
to explain that to your user.

00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:06.216 A:middle
Then below, you can
either handle the failure

00:30:06.286 --> 00:30:10.626 A:middle
or the success as you choose.

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.366 A:middle
The last code example I
want to show is HealthKit.

00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:20.656 A:middle
On this code example,
we're checking first to see

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.986 A:middle
if HealthKit data is
available on this device.

00:30:24.376 --> 00:30:27.586 A:middle
Then, we're allocinitting
an HKHealthStore and asking

00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:30.876 A:middle
for access to the heart
rate type identifier.

00:30:31.106 --> 00:30:34.026 A:middle
This is an important
point because access

00:30:34.026 --> 00:30:37.236 A:middle
to HealthKit data types
is very, very granular.

00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:41.136 A:middle
And, you should only ask for
access to the data classes

00:30:41.136 --> 00:30:42.936 A:middle
that you're going
to actively use.

00:30:43.426 --> 00:30:46.826 A:middle
What you would do then is
call requestAuthorization

00:30:46.826 --> 00:30:50.626 A:middle
ToShareTypes completion
to prompt the user.

00:30:51.456 --> 00:30:53.606 A:middle
Now, you can't check
to see whether

00:30:53.606 --> 00:30:57.216 A:middle
or not the user gave you access
to read or if there, in fact,

00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:58.986 A:middle
is any data at all
of that data type.

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:00.476 A:middle
That's part of the
privacy design.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:00.476 A:middle
That's part of the
privacy design.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:02.616 A:middle
So, the success variable

00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:06.466 A:middle
in the block actually indicates
whether the user was prompted

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:10.806 A:middle
or not, not what the
response of the user was.

00:31:11.696 --> 00:31:15.986 A:middle
If the request was not
successful, then the error --

00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:17.626 A:middle
the NS error will be populated.

00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:22.526 A:middle
Writing is slightly different.

00:31:22.526 --> 00:31:25.246 A:middle
You can check to see if you
have authorization to write,

00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:28.686 A:middle
and you do that by calling
authorizationStatus ForDataType.

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:31.746 A:middle
This will return you back
in authorization status,

00:31:32.616 --> 00:31:35.156 A:middle
which you then can then
conditionalize your logic on.

00:31:36.286 --> 00:31:44.146 A:middle
Also, applications can only
edit, or modify, or delete data

00:31:44.146 --> 00:31:48.006 A:middle
that they have written, not
other applications' data.

00:31:48.756 --> 00:31:51.016 A:middle
So, you should check your
authorization status first,

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.606 A:middle
and then if you need to,
ask the user for permission.

00:31:58.366 --> 00:31:59.686 A:middle
Calling saveObject


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.116 --> 00:32:03.516 A:middle
and deleteObject will modify
those particular objects.

00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:09.486 A:middle
So, we've talked
about data isolation.

00:32:09.846 --> 00:32:11.926 A:middle
What are the differences
on the different platforms,

00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:13.736 A:middle
and that's a lot of information.

00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:18.006 A:middle
So, we need to be able to test
it and it's really easy to test.

00:32:18.006 --> 00:32:20.516 A:middle
All you need to do is
run your application.

00:32:21.076 --> 00:32:23.236 A:middle
You should already
be testing on-device,

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:26.116 A:middle
however the simulator
does support a lot

00:32:26.116 --> 00:32:28.296 A:middle
of the data isolated classes.

00:32:29.036 --> 00:32:32.116 A:middle
Note that apps can only trigger
the prompt once, so if you need

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:36.196 A:middle
to go back and retrigger it
on the iOS you need to go

00:32:36.196 --> 00:32:40.746 A:middle
to Settings, General, Reset,
Reset Location and Privacy,

00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:43.736 A:middle
or on OS X use tccutil.

00:32:45.056 --> 00:32:49.106 A:middle
Consider all of the different
test cases, and there's four

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:51.586 A:middle
of them; permission
being sought and denied,

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:54.626 A:middle
permission being
sought and granted,

00:32:55.276 --> 00:32:58.536 A:middle
permission previously denied,
and permission restricted.

00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:02.046 A:middle
You might even want to
consider building these


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:02.046 A:middle
You might even want to
consider building these

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:06.236 A:middle
in to your unit tests so that
you don't ship any regressions.

00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:09.956 A:middle
I'd like to talk a little bit
about permission restricted,

00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:15.586 A:middle
as that's a special,
interesting case.

00:33:16.066 --> 00:33:18.356 A:middle
Restrictions can
prevent your users

00:33:18.476 --> 00:33:21.096 A:middle
from changing their privacy
settings even if they want to.

00:33:21.806 --> 00:33:24.086 A:middle
For example, enterprise
restriction

00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
or on-device restrictions
can prevent the user

00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:28.996 A:middle
from changing their
privacy settings.

00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.756 A:middle
So, you should try to
send users to settings,

00:33:32.216 --> 00:33:33.866 A:middle
but your code should
be resilient

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:35.366 A:middle
to the lack of data returned.

00:33:36.086 --> 00:33:38.786 A:middle
The OS can help you
fail gracefully.

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:40.526 A:middle
Some of the picker classes

00:33:40.526 --> 00:33:44.446 A:middle
in iOS will actually show a lock
page indicating the user has

00:33:44.486 --> 00:33:47.046 A:middle
previously declined
access to that data type

00:33:47.696 --> 00:33:51.286 A:middle
so you shouldn't design dialogs
that say go flip the switch

00:33:51.286 --> 00:33:52.586 A:middle
in the case that
you're restricted

00:33:52.936 --> 00:33:56.426 A:middle
because users may not actually
be able to flip the switch.

00:33:58.096 --> 00:34:00.626 A:middle
It's easy to test
with restrictions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.096 --> 00:34:00.626 A:middle
It's easy to test
with restrictions.

00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:04.336 A:middle
All you have to do is go to
Settings, General Restrictions,

00:34:04.726 --> 00:34:06.346 A:middle
and then choose the
data type that you want

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:07.386 A:middle
to test restrictions with.

00:34:07.976 --> 00:34:12.306 A:middle
So, we have some
great iOS sample code

00:34:12.306 --> 00:34:13.426 A:middle
out there for you today.

00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:15.775 A:middle
It's called "Checking
and Requesting Access

00:34:15.775 --> 00:34:19.216 A:middle
to Data Classes in Privacy
Settings" and it's available

00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:20.876 A:middle
on the iOS Developer Library.

00:34:22.235 --> 00:34:23.926 A:middle
You can use it directly
in your project

00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:26.306 A:middle
or just download it
and play with it.

00:34:27.196 --> 00:34:29.366 A:middle
So, that's data isolation

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:31.735 A:middle
and prompting your
users with purpose.

00:34:32.116 --> 00:34:34.585 A:middle
I'm now going to give it back
to Katie so she can take you

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.126 A:middle
through privacy best practices.

00:34:36.436 --> 00:34:36.786 A:middle
Thank you.

00:34:38.516 --> 00:34:43.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:43.606 --> 00:34:44.235 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, David.

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:47.335 A:middle
So now, I'm going to finish
off talking about some things

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.025 A:middle
that you can do and apply
in your application.

00:34:50.616 --> 00:34:55.616 A:middle
I'm going to talk about
transparency, data collection,

00:34:56.436 --> 00:35:00.516 A:middle
avoiding fingerprinting, and
how to protect your users' data.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:56.436 --> 00:35:00.516 A:middle
avoiding fingerprinting, and
how to protect your users' data.

00:35:01.336 --> 00:35:05.706 A:middle
So, David talked about
transparency already.

00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:08.986 A:middle
He talked about in terms of
consent and Just in Time alerts.

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:11.956 A:middle
But, transparency is
important even wider.

00:35:12.266 --> 00:35:13.796 A:middle
This is all about insuring

00:35:13.796 --> 00:35:17.046 A:middle
that your users understand
what's happening to them

00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:18.576 A:middle
and what's happening
to their data.

00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:22.546 A:middle
Users should never be
surprised if you explain

00:35:22.546 --> 00:35:25.906 A:middle
to them how your code works or
what's happening to their data.

00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:29.956 A:middle
Think about what the
user expectations are.

00:35:29.956 --> 00:35:32.276 A:middle
This is what you should go
back to and think about.

00:35:32.276 --> 00:35:34.216 A:middle
What would users think
is happening here?

00:35:35.096 --> 00:35:38.066 A:middle
So, there's other ways
that we can be transparent.

00:35:38.926 --> 00:35:40.596 A:middle
Logging is one of those places.

00:35:40.926 --> 00:35:45.186 A:middle
For instance, both on iOS and
OS X, if the user has selected

00:35:45.746 --> 00:35:48.576 A:middle
to submit logs to
Apple via Diagnostics

00:35:48.576 --> 00:35:50.926 A:middle
and Usage the user can
go and look at these.

00:35:51.076 --> 00:35:55.506 A:middle
You can go in iOS under
Settings, Privacy, Diagnostics

00:35:55.506 --> 00:35:58.236 A:middle
and Usage, and look at all the
logs that will be sent to Apple.

00:35:59.036 --> 00:36:03.646 A:middle
You can also see them
via the console on OS X.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.036 --> 00:36:03.646 A:middle
You can also see them
via the console on OS X.

00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:07.996 A:middle
Another example of this on
OS X is for crash reports.

00:36:08.506 --> 00:36:11.356 A:middle
You can then expand
out and view the data

00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:12.546 A:middle
that would be sent to Apple.

00:36:13.176 --> 00:36:16.266 A:middle
I would also encourage
you to think about his

00:36:16.266 --> 00:36:19.386 A:middle
when you have a data
store of user data.

00:36:20.546 --> 00:36:23.206 A:middle
Figure out a way to
visualize this data

00:36:23.206 --> 00:36:25.766 A:middle
and let them see what
information you're storing.

00:36:26.686 --> 00:36:29.606 A:middle
Users like when they have
the control to be able to see

00:36:29.606 --> 00:36:32.626 A:middle
and understand what's happening.

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:35.056 A:middle
Your Privacy Policy
is another way

00:36:35.056 --> 00:36:37.116 A:middle
that you can be transparent
to users.

00:36:37.116 --> 00:36:37.966 A:middle
It's a great tool.

00:36:38.686 --> 00:36:42.646 A:middle
Your Privacy Policy should
include what data you collect,

00:36:43.386 --> 00:36:48.086 A:middle
what you plan to do with
that data, and if you plan

00:36:48.086 --> 00:36:49.786 A:middle
to share it with any third
parties, who they are.

00:36:51.246 --> 00:36:55.926 A:middle
As a family's sharing, you may
need to include a kid section

00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:57.426 A:middle
of your Privacy Policy, as well.

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:01.716 A:middle
There are four different areas
this year where we are going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:01.716 A:middle
There are four different areas
this year where we are going

00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:04.826 A:middle
to be requiring a Privacy Policy
if you're taking advantage

00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:05.756 A:middle
of this functionality.

00:37:06.276 --> 00:37:09.236 A:middle
The first one is apps that
link against HealthKit.

00:37:10.276 --> 00:37:11.916 A:middle
Second, HomeKit.

00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:15.216 A:middle
Third, third party keyboards.

00:37:15.886 --> 00:37:19.456 A:middle
And lastly, if you want your app
to show up in the kids' section

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:22.376 A:middle
of the app store you will
also require a Privacy Policy.

00:37:23.296 --> 00:37:26.456 A:middle
We make it easy to submit a
link and you can do it right

00:37:26.456 --> 00:37:29.416 A:middle
in iTunes Connect, and
then this will be visible

00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:30.916 A:middle
in all of the App Stores.

00:37:32.286 --> 00:37:34.916 A:middle
So, here you can see
in iTunes Connect,

00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:35.996 A:middle
you probably know this page,

00:37:35.996 --> 00:37:37.156 A:middle
it's where you write
the description

00:37:37.156 --> 00:37:38.826 A:middle
of what your app
does, what it is.

00:37:39.096 --> 00:37:41.716 A:middle
And at the bottom, here's
where you add a link

00:37:41.716 --> 00:37:42.796 A:middle
to your Privacy Policy.

00:37:44.616 --> 00:37:48.476 A:middle
Then, in the App Store on
the first page, if you scroll

00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:51.316 A:middle
down you can see, and
users can go and click

00:37:51.316 --> 00:37:53.486 A:middle
on your Privacy Policy
and go read it.

00:37:53.906 --> 00:37:56.086 A:middle
Now this, users can see it

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:58.926 A:middle
and read it before they
have downloaded this app,

00:37:59.536 --> 00:38:00.486 A:middle
so it gives them the ability


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.536 --> 00:38:00.486 A:middle
so it gives them the ability

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:03.866 A:middle
to understand what's happening
before it happens to their data.

00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:08.596 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk
about data collection.

00:38:08.716 --> 00:38:11.916 A:middle
So, data collection is
a really powerful tool.

00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:15.046 A:middle
It's great to understand where
users are having problems,

00:38:15.356 --> 00:38:17.366 A:middle
where they're running
into issues or crashing,

00:38:18.196 --> 00:38:20.326 A:middle
where users are spending
the most time in your apps

00:38:20.326 --> 00:38:22.646 A:middle
so you can expand more
engineering resources there.

00:38:23.646 --> 00:38:27.776 A:middle
But, we believe that all data
collection does have privacy

00:38:27.776 --> 00:38:32.166 A:middle
impact, so you want a weigh
the benefits against the risks.

00:38:33.676 --> 00:38:36.476 A:middle
The thing that I work with teams
and talk to teams about is think

00:38:36.476 --> 00:38:38.976 A:middle
about the decision that
you're trying to achieve,

00:38:38.976 --> 00:38:41.216 A:middle
the decision you're trying to
make with the data collection,

00:38:41.546 --> 00:38:43.036 A:middle
and the question
you're trying to answer.

00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:46.746 A:middle
That's where you should
start with data collection.

00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:50.696 A:middle
And, if you can't think of
a question, you can't think

00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:53.096 A:middle
of anything that you're
going to do with the data,

00:38:53.096 --> 00:38:55.216 A:middle
the best question is -- because
I think it sounds interesting,

00:38:55.506 --> 00:38:57.726 A:middle
because I wondered,
then that's a good sign

00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:59.936 A:middle
that we shouldn't be
collecting that amount

00:38:59.936 --> 00:39:01.786 A:middle
of data and that data.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.936 --> 00:39:01.786 A:middle
of data and that data.

00:39:02.546 --> 00:39:04.736 A:middle
So, we've all heard
about and heard

00:39:04.736 --> 00:39:06.346 A:middle
in the industry about breaches.

00:39:07.156 --> 00:39:11.046 A:middle
And one thing to think about is,
unfortunately, if this happens

00:39:11.046 --> 00:39:14.376 A:middle
to you, you want to be able to
explain how you plan you use

00:39:14.376 --> 00:39:15.566 A:middle
and have a clear explanation

00:39:15.566 --> 00:39:17.326 A:middle
for all the data
that you're storing.

00:39:18.066 --> 00:39:21.136 A:middle
If you don't have a good
explanation and users want

00:39:21.136 --> 00:39:23.816 A:middle
to understand, this will
have more of an impact

00:39:23.816 --> 00:39:26.736 A:middle
to your reputation and
your company's reputation.

00:39:28.216 --> 00:39:32.976 A:middle
Now, this is true both for
applications and servers,

00:39:33.046 --> 00:39:37.036 A:middle
so you shouldn't think of just
this on the iOS or OS X side.

00:39:38.936 --> 00:39:41.796 A:middle
There is six data collection
techniques on this slide.

00:39:42.316 --> 00:39:45.366 A:middle
Now, last year we got
into depth about them,

00:39:45.606 --> 00:39:47.276 A:middle
we talked about, defined them.

00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:50.626 A:middle
We gave examples on
how to apply them.

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:54.256 A:middle
So, if you're interested in
these, and they're great to use

00:39:54.256 --> 00:39:57.316 A:middle
to protect your users' privacy
when doing data collection,

00:39:57.856 --> 00:39:59.456 A:middle
go and watch last year's talk.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.056 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
And, these are great techniques
to use to avoid fingerprinting.

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:07.106 A:middle
That's really one
of their main uses.

00:40:08.046 --> 00:40:09.556 A:middle
So, what is fingerprinting?

00:40:09.556 --> 00:40:12.046 A:middle
I mean, we hear about
fingerprinting, but what is it?

00:40:12.496 --> 00:40:14.016 A:middle
This is when a large number

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:17.636 A:middle
of fairly static
metrics are collected.

00:40:18.466 --> 00:40:21.366 A:middle
A configuration, collecting
configurations is a good example

00:40:21.366 --> 00:40:23.766 A:middle
of this, and then they
can be pieced together

00:40:23.766 --> 00:40:28.426 A:middle
to form a fairly stable
semi-persistent fingerprint.

00:40:28.836 --> 00:40:31.626 A:middle
So then, any other
data that is logged

00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:34.586 A:middle
with this information is then
associated to this device.

00:40:36.036 --> 00:40:40.216 A:middle
This can happen very easily,
it can happen accidentally,

00:40:40.376 --> 00:40:42.766 A:middle
and it can happen
without collecting any

00:40:42.766 --> 00:40:43.946 A:middle
personal information.

00:40:44.626 --> 00:40:48.046 A:middle
You may think, "Well, there's no
personal information in my logs,

00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.226 A:middle
in my logging, so
there's no privacy impact.

00:40:52.076 --> 00:40:53.076 A:middle
This is not true.

00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:56.146 A:middle
You should go back, look at
what you're logging to see

00:40:56.146 --> 00:40:58.456 A:middle
if you have accidentally been
fingerprinting your users.

00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:01.956 A:middle
Now, I'm going to take
us through an example


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:01.956 A:middle
Now, I'm going to take
us through an example

00:41:01.956 --> 00:41:03.596 A:middle
that helps illustrate
a little bit more

00:41:03.596 --> 00:41:05.576 A:middle
about how easy fingerprinting
can happen,

00:41:05.576 --> 00:41:06.536 A:middle
and how accidentally.

00:41:07.096 --> 00:41:09.576 A:middle
So, here we have an
initial user population.

00:41:09.806 --> 00:41:11.276 A:middle
All these dots, they're devices.

00:41:12.606 --> 00:41:14.856 A:middle
So, first we're going
to take all the devices

00:41:14.856 --> 00:41:16.736 A:middle
that have OS X Yosemite
installed,

00:41:18.116 --> 00:41:23.666 A:middle
then have a certain screen
resolution, a certain time zone,

00:41:24.006 --> 00:41:25.006 A:middle
Pacific Standard Time.

00:41:25.526 --> 00:41:28.556 A:middle
Do they have Java installed?

00:41:29.326 --> 00:41:31.236 A:middle
Are cookies enabled?

00:41:31.766 --> 00:41:37.196 A:middle
A certain version of Flash?

00:41:37.346 --> 00:41:40.456 A:middle
And, with a User-Agent string
of Safari OS X Yosemite,

00:41:40.676 --> 00:41:43.336 A:middle
we're down to a single
device, Alice.

00:41:44.636 --> 00:41:47.706 A:middle
So, this is where I encourage
all of you to go and look

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:48.726 A:middle
at your data collection
and think

00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:50.296 A:middle
about if this is
happening to you.

00:41:50.296 --> 00:41:52.436 A:middle
And, this is where you
can easily apply some

00:41:52.436 --> 00:41:53.746 A:middle
of the data collection
techniques.

00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:56.206 A:middle
Maybe what you're doing,

00:41:56.206 --> 00:41:58.546 A:middle
it doesn't really matter what
screen resolution they have.

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:03.156 A:middle
Bucketing it into high,
medium, and low maybe enough


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:03.156 A:middle
Bucketing it into high,
medium, and low maybe enough

00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:06.176 A:middle
for your use, but it'll
have more people fall

00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:11.876 A:middle
into each bucket.

00:42:12.036 --> 00:42:14.006 A:middle
We all are creating way
more data these days,

00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:16.896 A:middle
and users are sharing
it with us.

00:42:16.976 --> 00:42:18.516 A:middle
So, you need to be mindful

00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:20.946 A:middle
about how you're
protecting all this data

00:42:21.066 --> 00:42:22.716 A:middle
that users are entrusting
you with.

00:42:23.346 --> 00:42:25.846 A:middle
So, there are a bunch

00:42:25.916 --> 00:42:31.346 A:middle
of different tools,
in both iOS and OS X.

00:42:31.346 --> 00:42:34.876 A:middle
And, we have provided a
help and make it easier

00:42:34.876 --> 00:42:36.356 A:middle
to protect your users' data.

00:42:37.016 --> 00:42:38.486 A:middle
The first one is the keychain.

00:42:39.016 --> 00:42:43.276 A:middle
All application credentials
should be stored

00:42:43.276 --> 00:42:44.096 A:middle
in the keychain.

00:42:45.316 --> 00:42:47.716 A:middle
Think about whether they
need to be synchronized

00:42:48.146 --> 00:42:50.476 A:middle
or if they can be stored
only on a single device.

00:42:51.496 --> 00:42:56.606 A:middle
Also, think about Touch ID,
presence, APIs, can you use this

00:42:56.676 --> 00:42:59.526 A:middle
to help protect your
users' data?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:05.146 A:middle
All client-server communication
should be encrypted.

00:43:06.386 --> 00:43:09.036 A:middle
Also, for the data you
are storing on-disk,

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.586 A:middle
use data protection.

00:43:11.006 --> 00:43:14.046 A:middle
This is great on iOS that we
have different data protection

00:43:14.046 --> 00:43:18.506 A:middle
classes so then you can pick out
data that may be most sensitive

00:43:18.506 --> 00:43:23.066 A:middle
and store it at the
highest level.

00:43:23.066 --> 00:43:28.126 A:middle
Now, we've talked about a
bunch of different changes,

00:43:29.176 --> 00:43:32.346 A:middle
new data classes for data
isolation, but the thing I want

00:43:32.346 --> 00:43:34.386 A:middle
to leave you with is a
couple of things you can do

00:43:34.386 --> 00:43:35.496 A:middle
and act on immediately.

00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:40.196 A:middle
Make sure if you don't have a
device that's upgraded to iOS 8

00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:43.006 A:middle
or OS X Yosemite
that you do today.

00:43:43.926 --> 00:43:45.216 A:middle
Test on them.

00:43:45.316 --> 00:43:47.326 A:middle
Understand the impact
this has to your users

00:43:47.566 --> 00:43:50.926 A:middle
to ensure there's not going
to be user impact on launch.

00:43:52.356 --> 00:43:55.816 A:middle
Prompt users well, and this
really means purpose strings.

00:43:55.816 --> 00:44:00.376 A:middle
If you don't have purpose
strings, go add them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:55.816 --> 00:44:00.376 A:middle
If you don't have purpose
strings, go add them.

00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:01.696 A:middle
Look into the new data classes.

00:44:01.756 --> 00:44:03.326 A:middle
See if you can provide
a great experience

00:44:03.326 --> 00:44:05.036 A:middle
by taking advantage
of the new classes.

00:44:05.436 --> 00:44:07.926 A:middle
If you don't have a
Privacy Policy link,

00:44:08.326 --> 00:44:10.056 A:middle
go submit one to iTunes Connect.

00:44:10.786 --> 00:44:15.426 A:middle
And lastly, think about privacy
throughout the design process,

00:44:16.046 --> 00:44:20.736 A:middle
and this will help you
maintain your reputation

00:44:21.236 --> 00:44:28.486 A:middle
and a strong relationship
with your users.

00:44:28.906 --> 00:44:34.056 A:middle
Now, Paul is our Evangelist
and he is a great resource,

00:44:34.056 --> 00:44:37.536 A:middle
if you have any questions after
today, to go and reach out to.

00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:42.336 A:middle
Also, we have two pieces of
great sample code projects.

00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:43.816 A:middle
We have two sample
code projects.

00:44:44.136 --> 00:44:49.136 A:middle
The first one, privacy prompts,
this is a help start for how

00:44:49.136 --> 00:44:53.286 A:middle
to adopt data isolation,
and especially great to look

00:44:53.286 --> 00:44:55.136 A:middle
out for the new data
isolation classes.

00:44:56.376 --> 00:44:58.746 A:middle
Then, people picker,
this is good to look

00:44:58.746 --> 00:45:00.706 A:middle
at if you currently
use the people picker,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.746 --> 00:45:00.706 A:middle
at if you currently
use the people picker,

or are wanting to
adopt it in iOS 8.

00:45:03.256 --> 00:45:08.966 A:middle
We talked about, today,
a few best practices

00:45:09.316 --> 00:45:10.786 A:middle
for maintaining your
users' privacy,

00:45:10.906 --> 00:45:11.946 A:middle
but there are a lot more.

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.546 A:middle
Go look at this documentation
and see

00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:16.066 A:middle
which other ones you can adopt.

00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:19.456 A:middle
Also, there's always great
information to be found

00:45:19.456 --> 00:45:20.776 A:middle
at the Apple Developers' Forums.

00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:24.286 A:middle
We mentioned several talks.

00:45:24.406 --> 00:45:26.316 A:middle
The first one is
"Kids and Apps".

00:45:26.316 --> 00:45:28.146 A:middle
It's happening right
here after ours

00:45:28.146 --> 00:45:29.906 A:middle
and I would encourage
you guys all to stay.

00:45:31.516 --> 00:45:35.556 A:middle
"What's New in Core Location",
and "Keychain Authentication

00:45:35.556 --> 00:45:37.566 A:middle
with Touch ID" already
happened this week,

00:45:37.566 --> 00:45:38.836 A:middle
but are great to go watch.

00:45:39.066 --> 00:45:41.716 A:middle
And then from last
year or previous years,

00:45:41.966 --> 00:45:43.486 A:middle
"Protecting your
User's Privacy",

00:45:44.406 --> 00:45:45.656 A:middle
"Protecting User's Data",

00:45:45.726 --> 00:45:48.246 A:middle
and "A Practical Guide
to the App Sandbox".

00:45:49.686 --> 00:45:52.576 A:middle
From David and I,
thank you very much.

00:45:53.516 --> 00:45:57.880 A:middle
