[ Silence ]

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:14.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to this
afternoon's, this year's edition

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:15.816 A:middle
of "What's New in
Foundation Networking."

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.166 A:middle
Foundation Networking
is, of course,

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.156 A:middle
the layer of networking
that's available

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:23.706 A:middle
to application developers
on Mac OS X and iOS.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:28.826 A:middle
It's our goal to provide
you guys with the protocol

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:30.146 A:middle
and networking support
that you need

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:31.756 A:middle
to make great applications
on our platform.

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:33.846 A:middle
And, of course, we use
these APIs ourselves.

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:36.786 A:middle
Here's a standard picture

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.516 A:middle
of what frameworks look
like on our system.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.286 A:middle
Your application sits on top,

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:45.606 A:middle
and nowadays you're also having
extensions that are sitting

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:46.836 A:middle
on top of all these frameworks.

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:48.816 A:middle
Extensions are particularly
interesting

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:49.916 A:middle
for background networking

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.646 A:middle
because when your extension
terminates, you might still need

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
to have work done, and you
can use background networking

00:00:55.946 --> 00:01:00.026 A:middle
through NSURLSession
to get that work done.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:55.946 --> 00:01:00.026 A:middle
through NSURLSession
to get that work done.

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.956 A:middle
Looking at the different
levels that actually make

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.926 A:middle
up Foundation Networking,
that we start

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:09.856 A:middle
with the Core OS BSD
networking layer.

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:13.806 A:middle
This is the lowest level that
sockets its bind, its addresses.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:15.996 A:middle
It's kind of like
building a car from a kit.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:22.546 A:middle
Back when Mac OS started,
we took the foundation layer

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:25.776 A:middle
of things from NeXTSTEP,
and we said, "Well,

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:26.996 A:middle
we need something
that's a C API."

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:28.626 A:middle
And CoreFoundation
came out of that.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:29.856 A:middle
And CFNetwork came out of that.

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:32.976 A:middle
As time has gone
on, we find more

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:35.196 A:middle
and more developers want
a higher level approach.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:38.536 A:middle
Foundation and Foundation
Networking provides

00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:44.846 A:middle
NSURLSession, replacing
NSURLConnection, NSStream,

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:50.766 A:middle
and NSNetServices as
Cocoa-style APIs for developers

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.726 A:middle
to use on Mac OS X and iOS.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.616 A:middle
These APIs serve
different purposes.

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:05.926 A:middle
NSStream is an API that is used
to synch bytes into the system


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:05.926 A:middle
NSStream is an API that is used
to synch bytes into the system

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.686 A:middle
in various places
or to receive bytes

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.936 A:middle
out when you maybe
don't have an idea

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:10.996 A:middle
of how many bytes there are.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:12.976 A:middle
You could have a file
on disk and you know

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:14.026 A:middle
that it's a certain size.

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:17.486 A:middle
So you create an
NSInputStream from a file.

00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:20.676 A:middle
Or you could receive an
NSInputStream from an API.

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:23.916 A:middle
You don't know how big it is,
so you schedule the stream

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:27.016 A:middle
and then you start
reading bytes out of it.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.676 A:middle
NSNetServices is an
API that allows you

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:35.196 A:middle
to do peer-to-peer servers
and clients on your machine,

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.876 A:middle
on your device, talking
to other devices.

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:39.596 A:middle
It's a great way
of publishing work

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.066 A:middle
that you want other apps to do.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:47.036 A:middle
NSURLSession provides sort
of a message-based delivery.

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:50.246 A:middle
You're talking about putting
a request on the network

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:53.616 A:middle
and receiving a response
and some data code.

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:57.936 A:middle
In this talk, we're going
to talk about those APIs:

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:00.986 A:middle
NSStream NSNetServices
and NSURLSession.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:00.986 A:middle
NSStream NSNetServices
and NSURLSession.

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.786 A:middle
We're going to review
NSURLSession,

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:04.406 A:middle
which is what we
introduced last year.

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.056 A:middle
So there will be a
bit of review here.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:10.206 A:middle
We have some new
protocol support,

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.826 A:middle
and if you saw Craig's
talk yesterday,

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:16.526 A:middle
there's on one slide there was a
little mention of a new protocol

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:17.216 A:middle
that we'll talk about.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:19.626 A:middle
And lastly we're going to
spend some time talking

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:22.556 A:middle
about the best way
to use NSURLSession

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.486 A:middle
and background networking.

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.736 A:middle
Let's get the new APIs
out of the way first.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.056 A:middle
NSNetServices has
a single, new API.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.476 A:middle
But it's not really new because
it was available last year

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:33.236 A:middle
in iOS 7.

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:35.826 A:middle
This year includes
peer-to-peer is available

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:39.306 A:middle
on Mac OS X Yosemite on
hardware that supports it

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.376 A:middle
which is recent, 2012
or later Mac hardware.

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:44.826 A:middle
That's really the only
API change available,

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:48.846 A:middle
but it is now available
for you to use.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.426 A:middle
NSStream gets two new APIs.

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:57.876 A:middle
Now NSStream is-it's Toll-Free
Bridged with CFStream,

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.576 A:middle
which means that there's a lower
level API that this works with.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.576 A:middle
which means that there's a lower
level API that this works with.

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:03.366 A:middle
But at some point
we lost the ability

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:06.336 A:middle
of just creating a stream
to a host on the internet.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:09.996 A:middle
So adding back a new
API gets streams to host

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:11.726 A:middle
with name specifying a port.

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:15.056 A:middle
Then the host could
be a dotted IP,

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.906 A:middle
IPv6 or regular internet
host name.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.946 A:middle
The result is an inputStream
and an outputStream

00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:23.396 A:middle
that you then open,
schedule, and read and write

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.866 A:middle
from as those streams get opened

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.776 A:middle
or if you pass on
to another layer.

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.126 A:middle
So, for instance, if you had an
audio streaming app that wanted

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:33.046 A:middle
to read bytes off of a network
resource that was providing you

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:37.736 A:middle
with audio data, you could use
this API to get an NSInputStream

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.016 A:middle
from that and pass

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:41.056 A:middle
that NSInputStream off
to the audio player.

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:45.066 A:middle
Well, if you had bytes that you
were generating that you wanted

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:48.016 A:middle
to send into that audio
player, or if you wanted

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.496 A:middle
to filter those bytes,
you might need

00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:51.096 A:middle
to implement your own NSStream.

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:53.366 A:middle
You could do that by
subclassing NSStream

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.396 A:middle
or the preferred
way we'd want you

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.556 A:middle
to do it is creating what
we call a "bound pair".

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
That creates an input and
output stream and a buffer.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
That creates an input and
output stream and a buffer.

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:03.896 A:middle
So you'll write bytes
into the output stream,

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:07.446 A:middle
and the audio unit or whatever
it is will consume the bytes

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:08.646 A:middle
out of the input stream.

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.136 A:middle
So that's just a
couple of new APIs

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.996 A:middle
in NSNetServices and NSStream.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.056 A:middle
I'm going to talk
about NSURLSession.

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:19.366 A:middle
And a lot of this is
review from last year.

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:22.066 A:middle
NSURLSession is sort
of a big machine

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:23.906 A:middle
that has a lot of moving parts.

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:27.296 A:middle
And in this picture it
kind of looks like a boat.

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:31.416 A:middle
It's an object that you
create with a configuration

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:33.376 A:middle
and it references
storage objects.

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.416 A:middle
The storage objects are
needed to supply information

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.106 A:middle
about how to perform a load.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.626 A:middle
Well, if it's a boat,

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.126 A:middle
the captain of the
boat is your delegate

00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:43.266 A:middle
that you bind into the system.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:47.706 A:middle
The purpose of this boat as it's
running along is to take data

00:05:47.706 --> 00:05:51.326 A:middle
in a request and to produce
responses and data objects out.

00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:55.096 A:middle
So it's like carrying
passengers and a duty-free shop

00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:57.076 A:middle
out the other side where
you get whatever it is

00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:58.736 A:middle
that you're getting.

00:05:59.506 --> 00:05:59.656 A:middle
All right.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:02.036 A:middle
So the concepts of
an NSURLSession.

00:06:02.036 --> 00:06:03.986 A:middle
The session object itself.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.896 A:middle
The API is called
an NSURLSession.

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:08.986 A:middle
The main factory class is
called an NSURLSession.

00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:12.606 A:middle
An NSURLSessionClass is created

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.926 A:middle
with an NSURLSession
configuration object.

00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:18.556 A:middle
The configuration object is
a dictionary of properties

00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:23.716 A:middle
that dictate things like the
how many connections we can make

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:24.276 A:middle
to a server.

00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:26.476 A:middle
What kind of SSL
we're going to use.

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.876 A:middle
What storage objects
we're going to use.

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:32.746 A:middle
The session creates
task objects.

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:36.706 A:middle
These represent the
sort of transient state

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:38.556 A:middle
of a resource as
it's being loaded.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:42.756 A:middle
A task object is created
from a request or a URL.

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:45.276 A:middle
And its initial state
is suspended.

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:48.436 A:middle
You resume it; it does its
work within the session,

00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:50.366 A:middle
conferring with your
delegate as needed,

00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.306 A:middle
and in the end the
task becomes finished.

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:56.326 A:middle
And you're done;
you've got your data.

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.496 A:middle
Okay. The delegate itself
is something you supply.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.496 A:middle
Okay. The delegate itself
is something you supply.

00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:04.716 A:middle
The delegate is has
to conform to a bunch

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:05.836 A:middle
of different protocols.

00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:07.626 A:middle
There are protocols
for session, for task

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.246 A:middle
and for the various
task subclasses.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.976 A:middle
There are storage objects that
exist in the system by default.

00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:18.696 A:middle
There is a Keychain-based
credential store.

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.926 A:middle
There is a cookie
store-a cookie jar.

00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:25.706 A:middle
Cookies are sort of a degenerate
form of authentication.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:27.976 A:middle
They serve the same purpose.

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:30.416 A:middle
They identify you to a
website, and allow that website

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:34.186 A:middle
to communicate with you in
what it thinks is a secure way.

00:07:35.816 --> 00:07:39.626 A:middle
Protocols are objects that you
can register with a session

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:42.586 A:middle
that override the
default behavior

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:43.876 A:middle
or provide additional behavior.

00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:48.746 A:middle
So a URL looks like "HTTP:",
your protocol could be "MOOF:"

00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:52.296 A:middle
and you could deal with MOOF
protocols however you want,

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
including rewriting them
to become HTTP protocols.

00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:01.546 A:middle
Lastly, there's the URL cache
object, which is what we're able


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:01.546 A:middle
Lastly, there's the URL cache
object, which is what we're able

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:04.476 A:middle
to consult in order to avoid
going out on the network at all.

00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:08.896 A:middle
In NSURLSession, the other
configuration object,

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:11.386 A:middle
you can specify your
own subclasses for all

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:12.866 A:middle
of these storage objects.

00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:19.946 A:middle
The configuration object
itself, as I mentioned,

00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:23.146 A:middle
it basically is a dictionary
although it is comprised

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:24.946 A:middle
of a bunch of property
attributes.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:28.796 A:middle
When you create one, when you
get a configuration object,

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:30.106 A:middle
you modify it however you want.

00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:31.686 A:middle
And then you're going
to create a session

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:32.905 A:middle
with that configuration.

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:35.535 A:middle
Once you've created a
session with a configuration,

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:36.895 A:middle
you can't modify it again.

00:08:37.296 --> 00:08:39.895 A:middle
These are some of the
attributes that you can change

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:43.306 A:middle
within a configuration: the
TLS levels, whether you want

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:46.616 A:middle
to support the latest TLS
level, restrict it to that,

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:49.616 A:middle
or to allow the previous
one, whether or not

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:53.636 A:middle
to allow a request to go over
the network (cell network).

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
Network service type is,
well, "I'm doing video data.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.886 A:middle
I want a higher priority
if that's available."


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:03.416 A:middle
I won't try and list all
the configuration options,

00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:04.396 A:middle
because there are quite a few

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:08.266 A:middle
and they're all in
the header file.

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:09.826 A:middle
To get a configuration object,

00:09:09.826 --> 00:09:11.936 A:middle
you can ask for the default
session configuration.

00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:13.946 A:middle
This is a factory method
that returns an object

00:09:14.546 --> 00:09:17.476 A:middle
that captures the global
state of the framework.

00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:19.316 A:middle
If you look at the
Foundation Framework,

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:23.026 A:middle
there are some classes like
NSData that have a class method,

00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:24.516 A:middle
NSData dataWithContentsOfURL.

00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:28.246 A:middle
If you were to pass
an HTTP URL into that,

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:30.626 A:middle
it would use all
the global defaults

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.836 A:middle
of the Foundation
Framework in order to go

00:09:32.836 --> 00:09:34.686 A:middle
out on the network
and get that data.

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:38.626 A:middle
Never call that API because
it blocks and it will end

00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:41.506 A:middle
up hanging whatever thread
you're executing it on.

00:09:41.506 --> 00:09:44.436 A:middle
The point is that that
configuration is what the

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:46.426 A:middle
default session configuration
represents.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.986 A:middle
If you get a default session
configuration and modify it,

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:52.606 A:middle
you're only modifying
that configuration.

00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:55.246 A:middle
You're not modifying the
global configuration.

00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:59.526 A:middle
There's a factory method for an
ephemeral session configuration.

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:02.066 A:middle
This is set up so that none


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:02.066 A:middle
This is set up so that none

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:05.536 A:middle
of the storage objects
actually persist data to this.

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:08.246 A:middle
You would use it in private
browsing, for instance.

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:13.426 A:middle
The third factory method is used
to create a background session.

00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:17.676 A:middle
You specify an identifier
which is a string that,

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:22.906 A:middle
when your app is re-launched,
you use the same string in order

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:26.396 A:middle
to get re-associated with that
session in the background.

00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:28.936 A:middle
Then you'll start receiving
events for that session.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:32.036 A:middle
There's a factory
method for a session

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:33.116 A:middle
that gives you a shared session.

00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:34.506 A:middle
The shared session is, well,

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:40.806 A:middle
going back to that NSData
dataWithContentsOfURL example,

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:43.576 A:middle
that would be using the
shared session to do its work.

00:10:43.646 --> 00:10:47.076 A:middle
It's representing the
global environment.

00:10:47.076 --> 00:10:50.036 A:middle
It's a very handy thing
to use when you just want

00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:51.316 A:middle
to get a resource
off the network.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.016 A:middle
Once you have a configuration
object that's set up though,

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:57.056 A:middle
you might want to create
a session all your own

00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:59.726 A:middle
that uses only your
own resources

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.906 A:middle
and maybe only your
own storage classes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.906 A:middle
and maybe only your
own storage classes.

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:05.096 A:middle
You don't have to specify
a delegate though, because,

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:06.606 A:middle
as we're going to talk
about in a few minutes,

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:09.086 A:middle
there's some asynchronous
convenience routines

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:12.966 A:middle
that don't require you
to implement a delegate

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.746 A:middle
with your NSURLSessions.

00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:20.256 A:middle
But if you do specify a
delegate, which you need to do

00:11:20.256 --> 00:11:24.256 A:middle
for background transfers,
then this is the API you use:

00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:25.996 A:middle
sessionWithConfiguration passing

00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:28.136 A:middle
of a delegate and
a delegateQueue.

00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:30.096 A:middle
And a delegateQueue can
be a concurrent queue.

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:35.416 A:middle
So, task objects themselves.

00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:37.726 A:middle
The session creates
task objects.

00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:40.686 A:middle
There's a base class task object
that has a couple of methods:

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.266 A:middle
-cancel, -suspend, and -resume.

00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:46.316 A:middle
When a task object is
created, it is suspended.

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:48.476 A:middle
You have to send it the
resume message in order

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:49.376 A:middle
for it to start working.

00:11:49.816 --> 00:11:53.256 A:middle
There are two subclasses,
which are really only available

00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:57.866 A:middle
for the purposes of providing
some sort of semantic glue.

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:02.706 A:middle
Currently, there's a
delegate for data tasks,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:02.706 A:middle
Currently, there's a
delegate for data tasks,

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:06.486 A:middle
but there's no delegate specific
for download-for upload tasks.

00:12:06.606 --> 00:12:09.346 A:middle
But if there were in the future,
we would have the ability

00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:10.976 A:middle
to differentiate
between the types.

00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:13.276 A:middle
There's also a download task.

00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:14.976 A:middle
And all this adds on top

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:18.816 A:middle
of the normal task object is
cancelByProducingResumeData.

00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:23.136 A:middle
When a download is
cancelled if you use this API,

00:12:24.046 --> 00:12:26.536 A:middle
we're able to capture the
state of the download and,

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:29.526 A:middle
at a later time, you can
create a download task using

00:12:29.526 --> 00:12:31.236 A:middle
that resumeData and avoid having

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:34.386 A:middle
to download all those bytes
again if the server supports it

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:37.136 A:middle
and if the conditions warrant
it and blah, blah, blah.

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:38.866 A:middle
There are all sorts of reasons
why that might not work.

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.336 A:middle
But if you want it to
have a chance of working,

00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:43.126 A:middle
this is how you'd
get that resumeData.

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:49.546 A:middle
To create task objects from
a session, dataTaskWithURL:

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:53.126 A:middle
You just give it an
arbitrary URL-HTTP, MOOF,

00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:55.586 A:middle
whatever is going to be
supported by the protocols.

00:12:56.886 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
dataWithRequest, which takes
an NSURLRequest, which is sort


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.886 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
dataWithRequest, which takes
an NSURLRequest, which is sort

00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:06.956 A:middle
of the older way of specifying
binding a URL with a method

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:11.336 A:middle
or however your protocol is
going to interpret that request.

00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:16.596 A:middle
Upload tasks are similar,
except that we don't allow you

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.206 A:middle
to create an upload
task from a URL.

00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:20.836 A:middle
You have to create an
upload task from a request

00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:23.716 A:middle
where you've specified the
method like post or put.

00:13:25.106 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
We give you the option of
performing an upload from a file

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.396 A:middle
or a data; either
of these are great.

00:13:30.156 --> 00:13:33.276 A:middle
But we also give you the option
of creating an upload task

00:13:33.406 --> 00:13:36.436 A:middle
with a stream-we say
"streamed request".

00:13:36.526 --> 00:13:40.396 A:middle
That means we're going to ask
your delegate for a stream

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:42.606 A:middle
when we're ready
to write the bytes

00:13:42.876 --> 00:13:45.596 A:middle
of your upload to the network.

00:13:46.356 --> 00:13:48.136 A:middle
The reason we have to do that is

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:50.326 A:middle
because sometimes we will
open a connection to a server

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:51.266 A:middle
and we'll start writing bytes.

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:54.236 A:middle
And the server will come
back and off-challenge us.

00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:56.026 A:middle
And we'll have to talk
with your delegate.

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:58.236 A:middle
But at that point we've
already sent bytes along.

00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
And if we're doing an
upload from a stream,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
And if we're doing an
upload from a stream,

00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:03.206 A:middle
we're going to have to
throw that stream away

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:04.716 A:middle
and ask your delegate
for a new one.

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:08.406 A:middle
If we did the upload from a
file or from a data object,

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.386 A:middle
we know how to restart
that stream

00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:12.096 A:middle
without having to
ask you for it.

00:14:12.566 --> 00:14:17.716 A:middle
If you're trying to do uploads
for background transfers,

00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:20.666 A:middle
you have to do it from a file
because we want to capture

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:22.656 A:middle
that file so we can upload
it in the background.

00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:26.616 A:middle
Download tasks are similar.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:27.846 A:middle
You can download from a URL.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:31.686 A:middle
I want to copy: I want a URL
that goes from, you know,

00:14:31.686 --> 00:14:38.106 A:middle
my big file .tgz or from an
NSURLRequest or create it

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:39.746 A:middle
from a resumeData block.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:42.256 A:middle
And that gives you
back a downloadTask

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.016 A:middle
which you then resume.

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:48.686 A:middle
The lifecycle of a data
task starts out suspended,

00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:52.016 A:middle
referencing the request that
we're going to deal with.

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.636 A:middle
You tell it, "Okay, resume."

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.656 A:middle
The state goes to running.

00:14:56.106 --> 00:14:57.886 A:middle
And then the delegate
starts getting called.

00:14:57.886 --> 00:14:59.296 A:middle
didReceiveResponse occurs.

00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:02.826 A:middle
It handed you the response, and
the response is also available


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:02.826 A:middle
It handed you the response, and
the response is also available

00:15:02.826 --> 00:15:04.656 A:middle
as a property on
the task object.

00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:09.316 A:middle
As data comes in, will call
didReceiveData delegate message

00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:10.516 A:middle
0 or more times.

00:15:11.156 --> 00:15:16.006 A:middle
If the task is in a
session that was enabled

00:15:16.006 --> 00:15:17.356 A:middle
that has enabled caching,

00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:19.466 A:middle
we're going to call
your willCacheResponse.

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:20.696 A:middle
This gives you the
opportunity to say,

00:15:20.696 --> 00:15:23.116 A:middle
"It's for a particular
resource," "I don't want

00:15:23.116 --> 00:15:26.596 A:middle
to cache this," or you want
to modify the cache response,

00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:29.946 A:middle
but we're going to call that
at this point before we call

00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:31.856 A:middle
didCompleteWithError
and the state

00:15:31.856 --> 00:15:33.016 A:middle
of the task goes to finish.

00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:35.776 A:middle
One thing to note,
didCompleteWithError

00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:39.176 A:middle
as the final thing that gets
sent to your delegate on behalf

00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:41.756 A:middle
of the task, the error
is going to be nil

00:15:42.406 --> 00:15:44.756 A:middle
if the server gave
us a valid response.

00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:47.696 A:middle
A valid response
would be 200 OK.

00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:51.706 A:middle
But a valid response is
also 404 FileNotFound.

00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:55.296 A:middle
Because the body that came back
might be interesting to you.

00:15:55.296 --> 00:15:56.976 A:middle
You might want to
display that body.

00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:00.396 A:middle
The error parameter
here then is strictly


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:00.396 A:middle
The error parameter
here then is strictly

00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:03.546 A:middle
for transmission errors, like,
the host cannot be resolved,

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:05.796 A:middle
or a timeout occurred,

00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:09.756 A:middle
or you cancelled the task
while it was in flight.

00:16:09.756 --> 00:16:13.656 A:middle
When you look at the error here,
it's going to contain, well,

00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.836 A:middle
the reason why the transfer
failed, and you should assume

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.616 A:middle
that the response and the data
that you got back are invalid.

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:22.276 A:middle
A download task works
very similarly.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.286 A:middle
You create a download task.

00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:26.356 A:middle
In this case, you reference some
file that you're going to get,

00:16:26.356 --> 00:16:29.946 A:middle
and it starts doing its work
as soon as you say resume-yeah,

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:31.476 A:middle
you send it the resume message.

00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:32.546 A:middle
So it goes to running

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:35.766 A:middle
and it will periodically
call didWriteData.

00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:37.726 A:middle
It will tell you, "Yes,
I'm making progress

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:39.166 A:middle
on this download as it's going."

00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:41.696 A:middle
Note that this is also
what's going to happen

00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:42.986 A:middle
for a background download.

00:16:42.986 --> 00:16:45.716 A:middle
If this task were created
for a background download

00:16:45.716 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
and your app is running,
you're going

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:49.516 A:middle
to receive didWriteData
callbacks.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.596 A:middle
Finally, we've written
all the bytes

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:54.756 A:middle
of this file to the file system.

00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:57.586 A:middle
We're going to invoke the
didFinishDownloadingToURL

00:16:57.586 --> 00:16:57.906 A:middle
message.

00:16:57.906 --> 00:17:00.986 A:middle
And we're going to give you
a file URL in your container.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.906 --> 00:17:00.986 A:middle
And we're going to give you
a file URL in your container.

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:03.696 A:middle
You have to move that to
a more permanent location.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.616 A:middle
Move the file to a
more permanent location

00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:08.566 A:middle
in your container because, when
you return from this delegate,

00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:09.836 A:middle
we're going to delete the file.

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:13.336 A:middle
Then we will call
didCompleteWithError:nil,

00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:18.996 A:middle
because we successfully got
the file all the way to disk.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:22.356 A:middle
Creating NSURLSessionTasks
can be done just-you know,

00:17:22.506 --> 00:17:24.675 A:middle
throw a request in,
get a task out.

00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:27.246 A:middle
But there's some convenience
routines that are really handy,

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:29.006 A:middle
especially when you
have a session

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.826 A:middle
that doesn't use a
delegate or, I should say,

00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:34.376 A:middle
particularly you can only
use these with a session

00:17:34.376 --> 00:17:37.896 A:middle
that doesn't have a delegate.

00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:40.256 A:middle
So you say
dataTaskWithURL:completion

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:41.656 A:middle
and you give it a
completionHandler.

00:17:42.536 --> 00:17:46.216 A:middle
The task object that comes
back has to be resumed.

00:17:46.856 --> 00:17:51.396 A:middle
But it doesn't bother calling
any of the delegate messages

00:17:51.396 --> 00:17:54.556 A:middle
that might be in the
session, or it might not.

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:58.376 A:middle
And when the work is done it
invokes your completionHandler.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
This is true for, you know,
with an upload via file or data,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
This is true for, you know,
with an upload via file or data,

00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:06.076 A:middle
or a download to disk.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:06.886 A:middle
In that case,

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:09.746 A:middle
the completionHandler
references the file.

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:12.556 A:middle
And, like the delegate for
didFinish LoadingToFile,

00:18:13.006 --> 00:18:14.396 A:middle
you have to move that file away.

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:18.216 A:middle
This is what this looks like
(the convenience routines).

00:18:18.216 --> 00:18:20.436 A:middle
Very simply you just create
a URL that you're going

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:21.976 A:middle
to request off the network.

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:25.166 A:middle
In this case I'm going to create
a configuration object using the

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.866 A:middle
ephemeralSessionConfiguration
prototype object.

00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:31.736 A:middle
I don't want to store anything
and I don't want anybody

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:32.986 A:middle
to know about this resource.

00:18:33.116 --> 00:18:35.396 A:middle
I'm going to create
a private session.

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:37.586 A:middle
And then I'm going
to create a task

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:39.846 A:middle
with that private
session and with that URL.

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:43.626 A:middle
So I tell the session,
dataTaskWithURL, "Here's my URL.

00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:44.776 A:middle
Here's my completionHandler."

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:47.256 A:middle
The signature for the
completionHandler is data,

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:48.936 A:middle
response and error.

00:18:49.946 --> 00:18:52.406 A:middle
Error will be nil if data
and response are valid.

00:18:54.056 --> 00:18:56.846 A:middle
I resume the task, and then I go
back to running in the run loop.

00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:59.826 A:middle
If you were to just exit right
here, nothing would happen


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:01.936 A:middle
because we're not
doing anything.

00:19:01.936 --> 00:19:05.056 A:middle
We have to run the run loop
or dispatchMain in order

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:07.036 A:middle
for this completionHandler
to get called.

00:19:07.436 --> 00:19:08.846 A:middle
It gets called and
we're able to deal

00:19:08.846 --> 00:19:11.926 A:middle
with the data that came back.

00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:17.056 A:middle
The delegate that you create a
session with then, is comprised

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:18.816 A:middle
of a number of different
protocols.

00:19:19.506 --> 00:19:22.026 A:middle
The session level
delegate is sort

00:19:22.026 --> 00:19:24.006 A:middle
of meta information
about the session.

00:19:24.736 --> 00:19:27.766 A:middle
When a session is created,
it might become invalid.

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:29.246 A:middle
You can send an "invalidate"
message,

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:32.316 A:middle
in which case the session
invalidation delegate message

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:32.986 A:middle
will be called.

00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:37.316 A:middle
But there's a more interesting
delegate message sent

00:19:37.316 --> 00:19:40.106 A:middle
to a session delegate, which is

00:19:40.106 --> 00:19:41.966 A:middle
for connection-level
authentication.

00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:46.486 A:middle
If you connected to a website
that has SSL encryption,

00:19:47.346 --> 00:19:50.566 A:middle
we're going to call your
session-level authentication

00:19:50.676 --> 00:19:54.016 A:middle
challengeHandler to ask
whether or not you want

00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:55.406 A:middle
to continue connecting
to a site.

00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:58.886 A:middle
We're going to put multiple
requests on the same socket.

00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:02.726 A:middle
We're not going to make a new
socket and off-challenge you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:02.726 A:middle
We're not going to make a new
socket and off-challenge you

00:20:02.726 --> 00:20:03.986 A:middle
for each request as they go.

00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:07.986 A:middle
We're going to do it once.

00:20:08.126 --> 00:20:11.026 A:middle
On the basis of each
task, on each request,

00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:13.056 A:middle
there's an
NSURLSessionTaskDelegate.

00:20:13.056 --> 00:20:15.006 A:middle
You can see that these
things are sort of building

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:15.976 A:middle
on top of one another.

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:19.886 A:middle
The most important thing
that this delegate responds

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.516 A:middle
to is didFinishLoadingWithError.

00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:25.406 A:middle
And again, if the error is nil,

00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:27.666 A:middle
that means that the
response was valid

00:20:28.056 --> 00:20:30.086 A:middle
and you should deal
with the data.

00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:33.426 A:middle
If the error is not nil, then
something happened that kept us

00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:35.026 A:middle
from being able to
transmit your request.

00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:38.546 A:middle
There is also request
authentication handling here.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:41.986 A:middle
If the server says, for
a particular request,

00:20:41.986 --> 00:20:44.096 A:middle
"I don't know how
to deal with you.

00:20:44.096 --> 00:20:46.186 A:middle
I need some credentials
for this request."

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:47.576 A:middle
It has nothing to do
with any other request,

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:48.346 A:middle
just this request.

00:20:48.796 --> 00:20:52.846 A:middle
Then that challenge request will
come through this task delegate.

00:20:54.646 --> 00:20:58.196 A:middle
Data delegate then
extends the task delegate.

00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
It's got a couple new
methods that are interesting.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
It's got a couple new
methods that are interesting.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.436 A:middle
First, didReceiveResponse.

00:21:03.746 --> 00:21:06.046 A:middle
Suppose you're downloading
a file off the network

00:21:06.046 --> 00:21:07.926 A:middle
or downloading data off
the network, and you look

00:21:07.926 --> 00:21:10.176 A:middle
at the content type when
you get the response back.

00:21:10.716 --> 00:21:13.206 A:middle
The content type says
that this is a disk image.

00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:14.776 A:middle
Well, you probably don't want

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:16.156 A:middle
to read the disk
image all to memory.

00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:21.296 A:middle
The completion routine for this
delegate message allows you

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:25.266 A:middle
to specify that this data task
should become a download task.

00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:26.326 A:middle
And that's exactly what happens.

00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:27.926 A:middle
We create a download task.

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:31.726 A:middle
We replace your data task and we
start writing the file to disk.

00:21:31.886 --> 00:21:35.256 A:middle
When the file is completely
written, we treat this task

00:21:35.256 --> 00:21:38.126 A:middle
as if it were a data
task and we notify you

00:21:38.126 --> 00:21:39.126 A:middle
of the file's location.

00:21:39.546 --> 00:21:43.956 A:middle
The bytes that are read off the
network then are sent to you

00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:45.346 A:middle
as didReceiveData callback,

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:47.546 A:middle
zero or more didReceiveData
callbacks.

00:21:47.636 --> 00:21:50.846 A:middle
One thing to note: you don't
have to copy those datas.

00:21:50.846 --> 00:21:52.226 A:middle
You can keep track of them.

00:21:52.226 --> 00:21:53.346 A:middle
You can reference them.

00:21:53.796 --> 00:21:56.176 A:middle
But you don't need to copy them.

00:21:56.176 --> 00:21:58.226 A:middle
Each of those datas
may, under the scenes,

00:21:58.296 --> 00:21:59.646 A:middle
be discontiguous data.

00:21:59.646 --> 00:22:03.456 A:middle
So you should use the NSData
discontiguous data application


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.646 --> 00:22:03.456 A:middle
So you should use the NSData
discontiguous data application

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:06.026 A:middle
APIs instead of requesting
the byte pointer

00:22:06.026 --> 00:22:06.796 A:middle
to the start of the data.

00:22:06.796 --> 00:22:08.826 A:middle
And that's probably
true with a lot of APIs

00:22:08.826 --> 00:22:10.246 A:middle
that are producing data today.

00:22:10.846 --> 00:22:13.306 A:middle
Behind the scenes, we're trying
to stitch things together

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:15.056 A:middle
to keep things discontiguous
in memory,

00:22:15.356 --> 00:22:17.006 A:middle
which is a big performance win.

00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:21.866 A:middle
Finally the download delegate
extends the task delegate.

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:23.296 A:middle
It doesn't receive the bytes,

00:22:23.296 --> 00:22:25.406 A:middle
it receives notification
of the bytes.

00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:28.816 A:middle
In the end, it receives a
delegate message that says,

00:22:29.196 --> 00:22:32.796 A:middle
"Here is the file
location for the data

00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:33.676 A:middle
that we just transferred."

00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:38.186 A:middle
One quick thing that I want to
talk about is the delegate queue

00:22:38.186 --> 00:22:39.696 A:middle
that you created
the session with.

00:22:40.366 --> 00:22:43.086 A:middle
We treated it in iOS 7
and Mac OS X Mavericks

00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:43.966 A:middle
as a serial queue.

00:22:43.966 --> 00:22:48.286 A:middle
Every time a task had
something to do, it would call

00:22:48.286 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
into your delegate and
wait for that to return.

00:22:50.556 --> 00:22:52.506 A:middle
And go on to the next task
that had some work to do.

00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:55.366 A:middle
The problem with this
approach is that,

00:22:55.366 --> 00:22:58.146 A:middle
if any one of your delegates
stalled for some reason,

00:22:58.476 --> 00:23:02.846 A:middle
like is happening here, then we
have to wait for that delegate


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.476 --> 00:23:02.846 A:middle
like is happening here, then we
have to wait for that delegate

00:23:02.846 --> 00:23:06.506 A:middle
to return before the
next task can come along.

00:23:06.976 --> 00:23:12.066 A:middle
In Mac OS X Yosemite and
iOS 8, we're now going

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:13.576 A:middle
to treat your queue
as concurrent

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:16.266 A:middle
if it is a concurrent queue,
as wide as you have specified.

00:23:16.406 --> 00:23:18.666 A:middle
So all of these tasks
are able to call

00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:20.186 A:middle
in to your delegate at once.

00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:23.416 A:middle
No matter what order
they finish, you know,

00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.756 A:middle
delegates may finish
at different times.

00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:28.946 A:middle
We're always going to be able to
enqueue work for the next task,

00:23:28.946 --> 00:23:30.136 A:middle
and that's a good thing.

00:23:31.836 --> 00:23:33.796 A:middle
There is a little bit of
new API that I need to talk

00:23:33.796 --> 00:23:34.826 A:middle
about in NSURLSession.

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:39.866 A:middle
This revolves around
storage objects

00:23:39.866 --> 00:23:44.186 A:middle
like the NSHTTPCookieStorage
and NSURLcredentialStorage

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:47.526 A:middle
and the NSURLCache as
well as NSURLProtocol.

00:23:48.056 --> 00:23:51.176 A:middle
In each of these cases, we
found that it was insufficient

00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:54.146 A:middle
for the accessors for
these storage objects

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:55.866 A:middle
to receive just the URL.

00:23:56.406 --> 00:23:59.496 A:middle
People who were subclassing
these objects wanted access

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.716 A:middle
to the task that was
asking the question.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:01.716 A:middle
to the task that was
asking the question.

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:05.476 A:middle
So there's a new category
NSURLSessionTaskAdditions.

00:24:06.056 --> 00:24:10.986 A:middle
If you look in the headers or on
the NSURLLibrary, you're going

00:24:11.686 --> 00:24:13.386 A:middle
to see this category show up,

00:24:13.636 --> 00:24:17.656 A:middle
and it provides asynchronous
gets and, presumably,

00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:20.546 A:middle
asynchronous sets, although
that's an implementation detail.

00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:24.076 A:middle
We'll take NSHTTPCookieStorage
for an example.

00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:27.626 A:middle
So two new methods of
gets: storeCookies:forTask.

00:24:27.816 --> 00:24:29.526 A:middle
Here's an array of
cookies, and I'm doing it

00:24:29.556 --> 00:24:31.106 A:middle
because this task cares.

00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:34.016 A:middle
You look-the implementation
will look in the task,

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:36.336 A:middle
look at the current
request, get the URL out of

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:37.816 A:middle
that and do that work.

00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:40.546 A:middle
getCookiesForTask
works the same way.

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:42.586 A:middle
I would like the
cookies for this task.

00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:45.246 A:middle
But instead of synchronously
responding,

00:24:45.606 --> 00:24:46.706 A:middle
here is a completionHandler.

00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:49.686 A:middle
Once you've got those cookies,
invoke the completionHandler,

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:51.846 A:middle
and you don't have to block me.

00:24:52.766 --> 00:24:56.976 A:middle
These APIs are available
on NSHTTPCookieStorage,

00:24:57.156 --> 00:24:59.166 A:middle
NSURLCredential and NSURLCache.

00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:06.566 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, during
the keynote there was a slide

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:10.216 A:middle
which had one little bit
of interesting stuff in it.

00:25:10.216 --> 00:25:13.196 A:middle
And I'd like to ask Scott
to come on up and tell us

00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:14.786 A:middle
about the new protocol support.

00:25:15.376 --> 00:25:16.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Steve.

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:17.366 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:25:17.366 --> 00:25:19.456 A:middle
I'm Scott, and today
I'll be talking

00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:21.986 A:middle
about new protocol support
in Foundation Networking.

00:25:22.886 --> 00:25:25.136 A:middle
We've been working hard
to improve the performance

00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:28.466 A:middle
of our HTTP implementation
for our developers-you guys.

00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:33.846 A:middle
And a popular request at last
year's WWDC was to add support

00:25:33.846 --> 00:25:35.196 A:middle
for the SPDY protocol.

00:25:35.736 --> 00:25:37.466 A:middle
Today we're pleased to announce

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:41.056 A:middle
that the SPDY protocol is
now supported by NSURLSession

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:43.756 A:middle
on OS X Yosemite and iOS 8.

00:25:44.336 --> 00:25:47.296 A:middle
Not only does this mean that
it's available in Safari

00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:49.846 A:middle
for your day-to-day browsing,
but it's also available

00:25:49.846 --> 00:25:51.806 A:middle
for direct use in your apps.

00:25:52.506 --> 00:25:55.866 A:middle
Even if you don't use
NSURLSession directly

00:25:55.866 --> 00:26:00.526 A:middle
in your applications, keep in
mind that SPDY's also leveraged


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:55.866 --> 00:26:00.526 A:middle
in your applications, keep in
mind that SPDY's also leveraged

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:02.386 A:middle
through other Apple
frameworks, like UIWebView,

00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:04.156 A:middle
which you might use
in your apps.

00:26:04.616 --> 00:26:07.946 A:middle
For those of you who don't
know what SPDY is already,

00:26:08.226 --> 00:26:14.716 A:middle
it's a protocol that is
designed to make the web faster.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:17.646 A:middle
Essentially, what it does is
it changes the on-wire format

00:26:17.646 --> 00:26:19.176 A:middle
of HTTP/1.1.

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:22.426 A:middle
But the semantics of
HTTP/1.1 stay the same.

00:26:22.846 --> 00:26:26.616 A:middle
So you know about request
types like get, post, put.

00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:27.696 A:middle
Those are the same.

00:26:27.936 --> 00:26:30.666 A:middle
Response codes, like 200
OK, that's still the same.

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:34.086 A:middle
Caches, cookies,

00:26:34.086 --> 00:26:36.466 A:middle
credentials-those are
also all the same.

00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
SPDY is also serving as the base

00:26:41.676 --> 00:26:44.216 A:middle
for the HTTP/2.0
draft specification.

00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:45.576 A:middle
I'm actually going to come back

00:26:45.576 --> 00:26:47.006 A:middle
to that point a little
bit later on.

00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:50.636 A:middle
But it's interesting to see
where technology and the sort

00:26:50.636 --> 00:26:52.426 A:middle
of development specifications
is heading

00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:54.106 A:middle
as a result of the SPDY work.

00:26:55.366 --> 00:26:58.236 A:middle
Now the way SPDY works at a
very sort of high level is

00:26:58.236 --> 00:26:59.516 A:middle
that it allows for the exchange

00:26:59.516 --> 00:27:01.776 A:middle
of multiple HTTP
messages-both requests


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.516 --> 00:27:01.776 A:middle
of multiple HTTP
messages-both requests

00:27:01.776 --> 00:27:05.466 A:middle
and responses-simultaneously
and potentially out of order,

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:07.426 A:middle
all over a single
TCP connection.

00:27:08.306 --> 00:27:11.676 A:middle
So if you'd like to use
SPDY in your applications,

00:27:11.766 --> 00:27:12.776 A:middle
here is what you need to know.

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:18.166 A:middle
As I mentioned, it's available
on both OS X Yosemite and iOS 8.

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:20.476 A:middle
And we support three versions

00:27:20.476 --> 00:27:24.676 A:middle
of the SPDY protocol:
2, 3, and 3.1.

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:29.306 A:middle
And what we've decided to do is
make it supported transparently

00:27:29.306 --> 00:27:30.376 A:middle
by NSURLSession.

00:27:30.946 --> 00:27:34.156 A:middle
So this goes along the lines
of a philosophy we have.

00:27:34.306 --> 00:27:37.906 A:middle
Which is that we will always
pick the best protocol we should

00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:40.026 A:middle
use when communicating
with your server.

00:27:40.516 --> 00:27:42.696 A:middle
Currently, that means we're
going to decide if it's going

00:27:42.696 --> 00:27:45.996 A:middle
to be HTTP/1.1 or SPDY
and the version of SPDY

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:46.956 A:middle
that we're going to use.

00:27:47.276 --> 00:27:49.096 A:middle
But this could also
hold true in the future

00:27:49.096 --> 00:27:52.206 A:middle
for some other protocol.

00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:55.066 A:middle
What this means for you is that
no source changes are needed.

00:27:55.576 --> 00:27:56.456 A:middle
It will just work.

00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:02.456 A:middle
If we look at a source code
example here, what you do first,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:02.456 A:middle
If we look at a source code
example here, what you do first,

00:28:02.456 --> 00:28:03.776 A:middle
of course, is create your URL

00:28:04.126 --> 00:28:06.716 A:middle
for whatever resource
you'd be interested

00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:07.806 A:middle
in fetching from your server.

00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:10.476 A:middle
And then you'd construct
a session task.

00:28:10.886 --> 00:28:13.806 A:middle
In this case we're using
a data task-in this case,

00:28:13.806 --> 00:28:17.136 A:middle
also with the shared session-and
then having a completionHandler

00:28:17.136 --> 00:28:19.116 A:middle
with the data you'd
receive, the response

00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:20.886 A:middle
and a transmission
error if there was one.

00:28:22.066 --> 00:28:24.956 A:middle
Of course, you then have to
resume the task to start it.

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:28.546 A:middle
What you'll notice about this
code sample is there's nothing

00:28:28.806 --> 00:28:31.026 A:middle
different here because
SPDY is going to be used.

00:28:31.316 --> 00:28:33.346 A:middle
There isn't some code
that I added, changed,

00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:35.426 A:middle
or otherwise removed
to support SPDY.

00:28:35.426 --> 00:28:38.016 A:middle
In fact, this example
should look very similar

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:40.196 A:middle
to what Steve showed you not
more than a couple minutes ago,

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:41.366 A:middle
and that's intentional.

00:28:42.726 --> 00:28:44.966 A:middle
I want to dive into
some of SPDY's benefits

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:48.706 A:middle
so you can understand how it
will actually impact your apps.

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:51.256 A:middle
The way SPDY works
is it has a single,

00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:53.186 A:middle
long-lived TCP connection

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.166 A:middle
between the client
and the server.

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:58.856 A:middle
This actually helps to mitigate
latency penalties often times

00:28:58.856 --> 00:29:01.656 A:middle
that are seen when you ask
for additional resources,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.856 --> 00:29:01.656 A:middle
that are seen when you ask
for additional resources,

00:29:01.986 --> 00:29:03.286 A:middle
because traditionally
we may have had

00:29:03.286 --> 00:29:04.666 A:middle
to open an additional socket

00:29:04.666 --> 00:29:07.226 A:middle
and TCP connection
to get the data back.

00:29:07.826 --> 00:29:09.596 A:middle
But now we have the one
connection that's open

00:29:09.596 --> 00:29:10.886 A:middle
for a longer period of time,

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:12.796 A:middle
which helps to get
rid of that latency.

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:15.966 A:middle
It also means that since we're
only opening one connection

00:29:15.966 --> 00:29:19.086 A:middle
to your server, that any given
app instance now should be using

00:29:19.086 --> 00:29:22.346 A:middle
fewer resources on your server,
which is a big win for you.

00:29:23.366 --> 00:29:26.686 A:middle
SPDY supports the
concept of multiplexing,

00:29:26.846 --> 00:29:29.896 A:middle
which is where a request and
response can be interleaved.

00:29:30.376 --> 00:29:32.726 A:middle
Potentially multiple requests
and responses can be interleaved

00:29:32.726 --> 00:29:33.876 A:middle
over a single connection.

00:29:34.486 --> 00:29:37.476 A:middle
This gets rid of what's known
as Head-of-Line Blocking.

00:29:38.226 --> 00:29:40.826 A:middle
This is where, while
you're in the process

00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:42.766 A:middle
of receiving the
response for one object,

00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:45.056 A:middle
that you can't receive
responses for other objects

00:29:45.056 --> 00:29:45.976 A:middle
on the same connection.

00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:48.336 A:middle
For example, you might
be in the process

00:29:48.336 --> 00:29:51.046 A:middle
of downloading a large image,
and that actually then gets

00:29:51.046 --> 00:29:53.686 A:middle
in the way of your ability
to download say a smaller

00:29:53.686 --> 00:29:57.026 A:middle
and more important
Javascript file or CSS file.

00:29:58.636 --> 00:30:02.266 A:middle
Finally, SPDY supports
the notion of priorities.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.636 --> 00:30:02.266 A:middle
Finally, SPDY supports
the notion of priorities.

00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:05.406 A:middle
Now the order in which you
issue requests no longer has

00:30:05.406 --> 00:30:08.066 A:middle
to dictate the order in which
responses are actually received

00:30:08.066 --> 00:30:08.966 A:middle
by your application.

00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:13.016 A:middle
I want to sort of show you
a diagram of how this works.

00:30:13.406 --> 00:30:16.086 A:middle
Keep in mind that this is going
to be sort of an ideal network

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:19.006 A:middle
where there's no latency and
perfect bandwidth utilization.

00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:20.796 A:middle
We're going to first
start by looking

00:30:20.796 --> 00:30:22.496 A:middle
at how Head-of-Line
Blocking is present

00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
in HTTP/1.1 without pipelining.

00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:31.886 A:middle
Imagine you issue three requests
for three resources: an image,

00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:34.596 A:middle
a style sheet, and
some XML data.

00:30:35.606 --> 00:30:37.626 A:middle
The first thing that will
happen of course is we'll send

00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:39.556 A:middle
out the GET request
for the image.

00:30:40.536 --> 00:30:42.696 A:middle
And then you'll wait a
while as all the bytes

00:30:42.696 --> 00:30:45.876 A:middle
in the 200 OK response come back
for that image back to your app.

00:30:46.736 --> 00:30:48.356 A:middle
Meanwhile, notice
nothing has happened

00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:50.016 A:middle
for the style sheet
or the XML data.

00:30:51.246 --> 00:30:54.026 A:middle
Then we can send out the
request for the style sheet,

00:30:54.456 --> 00:30:57.506 A:middle
receive its response, and then
do the same for the XML data.

00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.236 A:middle
So you can see here
that during the time


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.236 A:middle
So you can see here
that during the time

00:31:00.236 --> 00:31:02.566 A:middle
when you are receiving the
response bytes for the image,

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:05.356 A:middle
we can't make any
forward progress

00:31:05.896 --> 00:31:08.306 A:middle
with the style sheet
or the XML data.

00:31:09.256 --> 00:31:11.376 A:middle
Now pipelining makes the
situation a little bit better,

00:31:11.376 --> 00:31:13.466 A:middle
but it doesn't get rid of
Head-of-Line Blocking still.

00:31:13.586 --> 00:31:17.576 A:middle
So let's see what
that looks like.

00:31:18.056 --> 00:31:20.936 A:middle
Now, requests can get sent
out one after another.

00:31:21.336 --> 00:31:24.306 A:middle
But responses are still blocked
by the previous response.

00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.446 A:middle
And Head-of-Line Blocking
is still an issue even

00:31:26.446 --> 00:31:27.796 A:middle
if you are using pipelining.

00:31:28.126 --> 00:31:30.836 A:middle
So multiplexing changes
that with SPDY.

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:33.696 A:middle
Let's look at the same
three resources now,

00:31:34.436 --> 00:31:35.816 A:middle
but this time with multiplexing.

00:31:37.456 --> 00:31:40.256 A:middle
We'll start by sending
the request for the image.

00:31:40.256 --> 00:31:44.016 A:middle
That should look no
different than before.

00:31:44.016 --> 00:31:46.986 A:middle
Like before, with pipelining we
can actually send the request

00:31:46.986 --> 00:31:49.536 A:middle
for the stylesheet immediately
after the request for the image.

00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:51.836 A:middle
And of course we can
start making progress

00:31:51.836 --> 00:31:54.156 A:middle
by receiving bytes
for the image.

00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:56.036 A:middle
But here's where
things get different.

00:31:58.176 --> 00:32:02.226 A:middle
Because the stylesheet is
higher priority than the image,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.176 --> 00:32:02.226 A:middle
Because the stylesheet is
higher priority than the image,

00:32:02.956 --> 00:32:05.516 A:middle
the server will start
sending back response bytes

00:32:05.516 --> 00:32:08.216 A:middle
for the stylesheet instead of
response bytes for the image.

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:11.406 A:middle
And then once the request
for the XML data has gone

00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:13.806 A:middle
out because it is the
highest priority object,

00:32:14.356 --> 00:32:17.336 A:middle
we receive its response bytes
in lieu of the image bytes

00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:18.606 A:middle
or the stylesheet bytes.

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:22.086 A:middle
You'll also notice in this
diagram that the amount

00:32:22.086 --> 00:32:25.426 A:middle
of data we're receiving for
the XML data is a larger chunk

00:32:25.876 --> 00:32:27.386 A:middle
than that of the style
sheet or the image.

00:32:27.606 --> 00:32:28.556 A:middle
That was intentional.

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.406 A:middle
Often times, with
SPDY implementations,

00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:33.136 A:middle
the responses are
weighted by priority.

00:32:33.716 --> 00:32:36.626 A:middle
So if we let this sort
progressing continue,

00:32:36.626 --> 00:32:39.756 A:middle
what we end up seeing is that
we can receive the entire

00:32:39.756 --> 00:32:42.606 A:middle
stylesheet and XML
data before the image,

00:32:42.606 --> 00:32:44.106 A:middle
even though those
resources were asked

00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:45.956 A:middle
for after we asked
for the image.

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:52.616 A:middle
So you might be wondering
why should I adopt SPDY?

00:32:52.616 --> 00:32:54.526 A:middle
And the plain and
simple reason is

00:32:54.526 --> 00:32:56.496 A:middle
that it can give a
better user experience.

00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:58.856 A:middle
That's what we're all
after I would think.

00:32:59.306 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
There's sort of two
reasons this is the case.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.306 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
There's sort of two
reasons this is the case.

00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:06.336 A:middle
The first is that, as I
mentioned, it reduces latency

00:33:06.336 --> 00:33:08.316 A:middle
by having a single,
long-lived connection open

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:09.966 A:middle
between the client and server.

00:33:10.306 --> 00:33:13.586 A:middle
What this means is that over
the lifetime of you app, as more

00:33:13.586 --> 00:33:16.066 A:middle
and more requests are
issued, we don't have

00:33:16.066 --> 00:33:17.706 A:middle
to continually open
new connections.

00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:19.566 A:middle
Which helps to get
rid of that latency.

00:33:19.826 --> 00:33:22.646 A:middle
It means that your app can have
much more interactive behavior

00:33:22.646 --> 00:33:24.596 A:middle
even when using a
cellular connection.

00:33:26.136 --> 00:33:27.756 A:middle
In our own performance
measurements,

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:32.216 A:middle
we found that SPDY could be up
to 25% faster than HTTP/1.1.

00:33:32.216 --> 00:33:35.766 A:middle
And I'll come back to this
a little bit later on.

00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:39.386 A:middle
There's also though some more
subtle points I want to raise

00:33:39.386 --> 00:33:42.146 A:middle
about performance in
SPDY and its benefits.

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:45.646 A:middle
Because it's only opening
a single TCP connection,

00:33:45.646 --> 00:33:48.216 A:middle
it also only has to do
a single SSL handshake.

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:51.766 A:middle
And that means that your
app will have less CPU use,

00:33:51.936 --> 00:33:54.696 A:middle
and over time better
battery life on the device.

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:58.296 A:middle
It also means that when your
app becomes the next big app

00:33:58.296 --> 00:34:01.826 A:middle
on the app store, and a big hit,
that you may not have to roll


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.296 --> 00:34:01.826 A:middle
on the app store, and a big hit,
that you may not have to roll

00:34:01.826 --> 00:34:03.416 A:middle
out as much server
site infrastructure

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:06.076 A:middle
to support the increased
number of clients,

00:34:06.126 --> 00:34:09.255 A:middle
because each client has
fewer connections going back

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:10.186 A:middle
to your server, right?

00:34:10.186 --> 00:34:11.346 A:middle
It's one instead of many.

00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:17.096 A:middle
I already told you that
if you'd like to make use

00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:19.985 A:middle
of SPDY you don't need any
client-side code changes.

00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:22.056 A:middle
But there are a few
other points with respect

00:34:22.056 --> 00:34:24.966 A:middle
to SPDY adoption I do
want to talk about.

00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:27.275 A:middle
First, we are planning
to add API

00:34:27.275 --> 00:34:29.686 A:middle
for setting priorities
on session tasks.

00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:31.076 A:middle
You'll see that in
a future seed;

00:34:31.186 --> 00:34:32.406 A:middle
it's not currently available.

00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:35.936 A:middle
We'd also welcome any other
feedback from you during either

00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:38.525 A:middle
of the networking lab sessions,
or through a bug report

00:34:38.886 --> 00:34:41.156 A:middle
if you believe there's other
APIs that would be useful

00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:44.525 A:middle
that you don't currently see.

00:34:44.786 --> 00:34:47.565 A:middle
While you don't need to have
any client-side code changes

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:50.496 A:middle
to support SPDY, keep in
mind SPDY does require

00:34:50.496 --> 00:34:51.335 A:middle
server-side support.

00:34:51.966 --> 00:34:54.906 A:middle
This all happens when the client
is negotiating with the server,

00:34:54.906 --> 00:34:56.686 A:middle
using the TLS handshake.

00:34:57.526 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
The reason this is important
is that all of the URLs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.526 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
The reason this is important
is that all of the URLs

00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:04.226 A:middle
for requests that you issue
from your application need

00:35:04.226 --> 00:35:07.526 A:middle
to have HTTPS and not HTTP.

00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:10.666 A:middle
I'll just point out that
there's a fair amount

00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:13.616 A:middle
of existing web server software
and content delivery networks

00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:16.156 A:middle
that already support SPDY.

00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.446 A:middle
So you may already have SPDY
support and have to do nothing

00:35:18.446 --> 00:35:20.246 A:middle
at all to turn it
on, on your server.

00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:27.986 A:middle
Finally, many of you might
have an NSURLProtocol subclass,

00:35:28.036 --> 00:35:30.186 A:middle
or maybe perhaps multiple
in your application.

00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:33.516 A:middle
And I do want to note that our
SPDY implementation is not going

00:35:33.516 --> 00:35:36.916 A:middle
to interfere with your protocol
subclasses regardless of whether

00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:38.376 A:middle
or not they're adding
support for SPDY

00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:40.486 A:middle
or some other protocol entirely.

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:46.336 A:middle
I mentioned that we
found that SPDY could be

00:35:46.336 --> 00:35:50.336 A:middle
up to 25% faster than HTTP/1.1.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:53.126 A:middle
I want to go into a little
more detail about sort

00:35:53.126 --> 00:35:56.386 A:middle
of the performance
and expectations.

00:35:56.386 --> 00:35:58.546 A:middle
Naturally, parallel
TCP connections

00:35:59.006 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
in some cases can be faster
than SPDY single connection.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.006 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
in some cases can be faster
than SPDY single connection.

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:05.656 A:middle
What we've found is that
whether or not SPDY is going

00:36:05.656 --> 00:36:06.806 A:middle
to be faster is dependent

00:36:06.806 --> 00:36:09.056 A:middle
on both network conditions
and your workload.

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:12.336 A:middle
In general, our guidance
is that if you are going

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:15.146 A:middle
to issue many requests,
particularly requests

00:36:15.146 --> 00:36:17.216 A:middle
for small size objects,
you're going

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:19.416 A:middle
to see a performance
gain with SPDY.

00:36:19.416 --> 00:36:21.986 A:middle
But if you're writing an app
that's downloading a handful

00:36:21.986 --> 00:36:24.976 A:middle
of files, perhaps though
also downloading large files,

00:36:25.236 --> 00:36:27.486 A:middle
such as a movie,
SPDY is not going

00:36:27.486 --> 00:36:28.566 A:middle
to be advantageous for you.

00:36:29.586 --> 00:36:32.976 A:middle
So keep in mind that you control
whether or not SPDY's going

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:34.626 A:middle
to be used based on whether

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:36.186 A:middle
or not it's turned
on on your server.

00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:41.126 A:middle
I also want to note that the
SPDY specification indicates

00:36:41.526 --> 00:36:45.296 A:middle
that HTTP headers can be
compressed to boost performance.

00:36:45.946 --> 00:36:47.766 A:middle
But it turns out this
is actually susceptible

00:36:47.766 --> 00:36:50.066 A:middle
to the crime vulnerability,
which you can read about online.

00:36:50.596 --> 00:36:52.076 A:middle
So in our implementation,

00:36:52.526 --> 00:36:55.416 A:middle
as is in many common
SPDY implementations,

00:36:55.816 --> 00:36:57.916 A:middle
we've actually disabled
this for user privacy.

00:36:57.916 --> 00:36:59.506 A:middle
So you're not going to
see a performance boost

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:00.566 A:middle
from compressed headers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:00.566 A:middle
from compressed headers.

00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:02.946 A:middle
Finally, I want to point

00:37:02.946 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
out SPDY is not an
IETF-recognized standard.

00:37:06.506 --> 00:37:10.746 A:middle
But we see it as a protocol that
is paving the way for HTTP/2.0.

00:37:11.106 --> 00:37:13.916 A:middle
In particular it gives you,
developers, the opportunity

00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:16.676 A:middle
to get a jump start on
using a protocol that relies

00:37:16.676 --> 00:37:18.866 A:middle
on a single, long-lived
connection with multiplexing,

00:37:18.866 --> 00:37:21.586 A:middle
which is the same direction
that HTTP/2.0 is heading.

00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:27.156 A:middle
I want to wrap up and talk
about some best practices

00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:29.236 A:middle
for working with SPDY.

00:37:29.236 --> 00:37:32.016 A:middle
Keep in mind, these are not
necessarily hard and fast rules

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.016 A:middle
that you always have to follow,

00:37:33.016 --> 00:37:35.596 A:middle
but these are good suggestions
just to keep in the back

00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:38.096 A:middle
of your mind as you
work with SPDY.

00:37:38.336 --> 00:37:44.646 A:middle
The first is, it's best if you
can issue your requests as soon

00:37:44.806 --> 00:37:46.646 A:middle
as you want the resources.

00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:50.176 A:middle
In other words, what I mean is
you might have previously held

00:37:50.176 --> 00:37:52.936 A:middle
back and actually manually
scheduled requests to try

00:37:52.936 --> 00:37:54.436 A:middle
to avoid Head-of-Line Blocking.

00:37:54.976 --> 00:37:56.976 A:middle
But because Head-of-Line
Blocking is no longer

00:37:56.976 --> 00:38:01.146 A:middle
of concern, we ask that you
enqueue all your requests right


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:56.976 --> 00:38:01.146 A:middle
of concern, we ask that you
enqueue all your requests right

00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:04.206 A:middle
away, and let multiplexing
do what it's meant to do.

00:38:05.126 --> 00:38:07.776 A:middle
Also, you might have
spread your content

00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:10.536 A:middle
across multiple host names,
called hostname sharding.

00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:13.956 A:middle
So if some resources might have
been, like, on css.apple.com,

00:38:13.956 --> 00:38:16.316 A:middle
some would have been on
images.apple.com and so on.

00:38:16.386 --> 00:38:19.016 A:middle
For HTTP/1.1 this made sense.

00:38:19.016 --> 00:38:21.266 A:middle
It would cause us to open
multiple TCP connections

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:22.466 A:middle
which would boost performance.

00:38:23.286 --> 00:38:26.916 A:middle
But since SPDY relies on a
single, long-live connection

00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:29.676 A:middle
which gives us optimal
connection reuse,

00:38:29.676 --> 00:38:32.596 A:middle
it's actually best if you
unshard and consolidate all

00:38:32.596 --> 00:38:35.816 A:middle
of your content to a single
hostname and single port,

00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:37.566 A:middle
so we can have that one,
long-lived connection

00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:39.916 A:middle
to give you the best
experience possible.

00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:42.856 A:middle
I'd like to turn
things over to Dan.

00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:44.046 A:middle
He's going to be talking

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.946 A:middle
about Background
Networking and Extensions.

00:38:46.996 --> 00:38:48.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone.

00:38:48.796 --> 00:38:51.556 A:middle
I'm Dan. And as Scott said,
I'm going to be talking

00:38:51.556 --> 00:38:52.636 A:middle
about background networking.

00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:54.656 A:middle
So Steve mentioned before

00:38:54.656 --> 00:38:56.536 A:middle
that you can enable
background networking

00:38:56.536 --> 00:38:58.496 A:middle
in your applications
using NSURLSession

00:38:58.496 --> 00:39:00.716 A:middle
if you use the background
session configuration


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.496 --> 00:39:00.716 A:middle
if you use the background
session configuration

00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:02.206 A:middle
with identifier factory method.

00:39:03.056 --> 00:39:05.386 A:middle
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of what I'm going

00:39:05.386 --> 00:39:06.856 A:middle
to be talking about today.

00:39:06.856 --> 00:39:08.486 A:middle
First, I'm going to
go over why you'd want

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:09.936 A:middle
to use background sessions

00:39:09.936 --> 00:39:11.906 A:middle
and background networking
in your applications.

00:39:12.826 --> 00:39:15.696 A:middle
Tying in with this, I'll talk
about using background sessions

00:39:15.696 --> 00:39:17.696 A:middle
in app extensions,
which is a new feature

00:39:17.696 --> 00:39:19.546 A:middle
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:39:20.086 --> 00:39:23.636 A:middle
I'll then talk about
discretionary networking,

00:39:23.636 --> 00:39:26.846 A:middle
which is a feature of background
networking that allows us

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:30.196 A:middle
to schedule tasks
when it's appropriate,

00:39:30.196 --> 00:39:31.756 A:middle
given current power conditions.

00:39:32.866 --> 00:39:35.666 A:middle
Finally, I'll talk about using
background sessions properly

00:39:35.666 --> 00:39:38.026 A:middle
in your applications, going
over a couple use cases,

00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:40.956 A:middle
and talking about some common
pitfalls and best practices.

00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:43.706 A:middle
So why do you want

00:39:43.706 --> 00:39:45.676 A:middle
to use background sessions
in your applications?

00:39:46.116 --> 00:39:48.256 A:middle
Well, the main benefit,
particularly

00:39:48.256 --> 00:39:49.766 A:middle
on iOS is for multitasking.

00:39:50.246 --> 00:39:52.436 A:middle
In a background session,
file-based uploads

00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:54.626 A:middle
and downloads can
continue out of process,

00:39:54.716 --> 00:39:55.956 A:middle
even while your app
isn't running.

00:39:56.626 --> 00:39:58.756 A:middle
This means that your
app can crash even.

00:39:58.846 --> 00:39:59.756 A:middle
It can be terminated.

00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:03.646 A:middle
Or, on iOS, it can be suspended
and those file-based uploads


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:03.646 A:middle
Or, on iOS, it can be suspended
and those file-based uploads

00:40:03.646 --> 00:40:06.696 A:middle
and downloads will still
continue, and will actually wake

00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:09.926 A:middle
up your app on iOS in the
background to handle things

00:40:09.926 --> 00:40:12.806 A:middle
like authentication
challenges and the completion

00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:14.116 A:middle
of all the tasks
in your sessions.

00:40:15.026 --> 00:40:18.046 A:middle
Another benefit is that
in a background session,

00:40:18.096 --> 00:40:21.366 A:middle
we monitor the network and
power environment for you.

00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:24.546 A:middle
This means that we cover things
like network reachability

00:40:24.546 --> 00:40:26.366 A:middle
and connectivity for
you, so you don't have

00:40:26.406 --> 00:40:28.236 A:middle
to use the reachability
APIs at all.

00:40:28.506 --> 00:40:30.876 A:middle
We won't attempt to establish
a connection until we know

00:40:30.876 --> 00:40:31.996 A:middle
that the server is reachable.

00:40:32.526 --> 00:40:36.946 A:middle
And similarly, if the user is
performing a download and steps

00:40:36.946 --> 00:40:40.156 A:middle
out of Wi-Fi, normally
that task would then fail

00:40:40.156 --> 00:40:41.196 A:middle
with a transmission error.

00:40:41.536 --> 00:40:43.536 A:middle
But, in a background session,
we'll actually recover

00:40:43.536 --> 00:40:46.346 A:middle
from that automatically
and retry it and resume

00:40:46.346 --> 00:40:48.716 A:middle
where we left off if the
download is resumable.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.106 A:middle
And you won't hear
about that error.

00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:55.276 A:middle
For discretionary tasks, we also
perform some battery monitoring

00:40:55.516 --> 00:40:58.036 A:middle
so that we don't perform a
task if the user's really low

00:40:58.036 --> 00:40:59.406 A:middle
on battery and not charging.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:02.156 A:middle
We'll also do bandwidth
monitoring.

00:41:02.296 --> 00:41:04.796 A:middle
What this means is
that if the user's

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:07.216 A:middle
on a really flaky Wi-Fi network

00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:09.886 A:middle
and isn't making really
sufficient throughput,

00:41:10.056 --> 00:41:12.506 A:middle
than we'll stop and
just retry automatically

00:41:12.506 --> 00:41:13.946 A:middle
when network conditions
are better.

00:41:13.946 --> 00:41:18.036 A:middle
I'd like to talk about
using background sessions

00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:20.576 A:middle
in app extensions, which
as I said are a new feature

00:41:20.696 --> 00:41:22.396 A:middle
of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:25.286 A:middle
Now extensions are very
short-lived processes.

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:26.646 A:middle
Generally they're only going

00:41:26.646 --> 00:41:29.356 A:middle
to be running while they're
actually active on screen,

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:32.896 A:middle
and that's going to be a very
short period of time usually.

00:41:32.896 --> 00:41:35.026 A:middle
In-process networking
really isn't sufficient

00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:37.236 A:middle
in an app extension if you
need to do any moderate-

00:41:37.236 --> 00:41:39.586 A:middle
to large-sized upload
or download.

00:41:40.466 --> 00:41:42.156 A:middle
But if you use a
background session,

00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:44.546 A:middle
then that task will
actually be performed

00:41:44.546 --> 00:41:45.666 A:middle
by our background daemon.

00:41:46.026 --> 00:41:50.236 A:middle
So your app extension can exit
or be suspended and, on iOS,

00:41:50.396 --> 00:41:53.366 A:middle
when that task completes or
authentication is required,

00:41:53.416 --> 00:41:56.316 A:middle
will actually launch the app
that your extension's shipped

00:41:56.316 --> 00:41:57.686 A:middle
with in order to
handle those events.

00:41:58.426 --> 00:42:00.596 A:middle
So essentially, your
app extensions


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.426 --> 00:42:00.596 A:middle
So essentially, your
app extensions

00:42:00.596 --> 00:42:03.736 A:middle
and your apps can share
background sessions.

00:42:03.996 --> 00:42:06.336 A:middle
This leads us to a
couple constraints

00:42:06.686 --> 00:42:08.746 A:middle
when using background
sessions in app extensions.

00:42:09.356 --> 00:42:11.906 A:middle
The first is that in order
to use a background session

00:42:12.136 --> 00:42:15.406 A:middle
in an app extension, you need
to use a shared data container.

00:42:15.856 --> 00:42:18.686 A:middle
Now the reason for this
is that by default an app

00:42:18.686 --> 00:42:20.576 A:middle
and any extensions
that it ships with are

00:42:20.576 --> 00:42:23.206 A:middle
in different data containers
and won't have access

00:42:23.206 --> 00:42:24.336 A:middle
to the same sets of files.

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:29.226 A:middle
But in Xcode you can create
an application group using the

00:42:29.226 --> 00:42:30.206 A:middle
Capabilities tab.

00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:32.926 A:middle
And if you create an
application group,

00:42:32.926 --> 00:42:35.566 A:middle
you can tell us the
identifier of that app group

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:36.946 A:middle
of that group container,

00:42:36.946 --> 00:42:38.366 A:middle
and will download
into that container.

00:42:38.366 --> 00:42:39.976 A:middle
I'll show you how to
do that momentarily.

00:42:41.636 --> 00:42:45.306 A:middle
Another caveat is that only
one process can be connected

00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:46.926 A:middle
to the background
session at a time.

00:42:47.436 --> 00:42:50.266 A:middle
This means that if your app
is running in the background,

00:42:50.386 --> 00:42:54.816 A:middle
and then another app launches
and brings up your extension,

00:42:54.816 --> 00:42:57.156 A:middle
it won't be able to use that
same background session.

00:42:58.226 --> 00:43:00.736 A:middle
Now a background session
is essentially defined


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.226 --> 00:43:00.736 A:middle
Now a background session
is essentially defined

00:43:00.736 --> 00:43:02.286 A:middle
by the identifier that you use

00:43:02.286 --> 00:43:04.956 A:middle
when you create your background
session configuration object.

00:43:05.406 --> 00:43:06.846 A:middle
What we recommend here is

00:43:06.846 --> 00:43:09.786 A:middle
that you use a different
background session identifier

00:43:09.786 --> 00:43:12.406 A:middle
for your app and for each
extension that you ship with.

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:15.176 A:middle
The only time that you should
take advantage of the fact

00:43:15.316 --> 00:43:18.326 A:middle
that your app and your
extensions can share background

00:43:18.326 --> 00:43:20.086 A:middle
sessions is when
we launch your app

00:43:20.086 --> 00:43:21.526 A:middle
to handle events
for that session.

00:43:22.126 --> 00:43:24.456 A:middle
Now I mention that you need
to use a shared data container

00:43:24.576 --> 00:43:27.816 A:middle
when using background
sessions and app extensions.

00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:30.986 A:middle
You can specify that using the
shared container identifier

00:43:30.986 --> 00:43:33.096 A:middle
property on
NSURLSessionConfiguration.

00:43:33.836 --> 00:43:36.876 A:middle
What you do is you just create
a configuration object using the

00:43:36.876 --> 00:43:39.756 A:middle
backgroundSessionConfiguration
WithIdentifier factory method

00:43:39.756 --> 00:43:40.916 A:middle
that Steve showed you before.

00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:43.426 A:middle
And you set the
sharedContainerIdentifier

00:43:43.486 --> 00:43:46.126 A:middle
property to the identifier of
your shared group container.

00:43:47.006 --> 00:43:49.146 A:middle
Then you can create
an NSURLSession

00:43:49.146 --> 00:43:50.416 A:middle
from that configuration object

00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:51.776 A:middle
and create tasks
in that session.

00:43:52.216 --> 00:43:55.526 A:middle
Now I'd like to switch
gears and talk

00:43:55.526 --> 00:43:57.896 A:middle
about discretionary
networking, which is something

00:43:57.896 --> 00:44:04.816 A:middle
that some background tasks can
use in order to perform tasks


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.896 --> 00:44:04.816 A:middle
that some background tasks can
use in order to perform tasks

00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:06.156 A:middle
at power-optimal times.

00:44:07.086 --> 00:44:10.396 A:middle
What this means is, that we will
take into account things like,

00:44:10.396 --> 00:44:13.136 A:middle
whether or not we're on a Wi-Fi
network or using cellular data.

00:44:13.136 --> 00:44:15.756 A:middle
And we'll also take into account
the current battery state,

00:44:15.816 --> 00:44:17.156 A:middle
whether or not we're charging,

00:44:17.466 --> 00:44:20.316 A:middle
how much-what percentage
the battery is charged.

00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:22.706 A:middle
We also take into account things

00:44:22.706 --> 00:44:24.686 A:middle
like how often your
app is launched.

00:44:24.966 --> 00:44:27.486 A:middle
If it's something that a user
launches really frequently,

00:44:27.486 --> 00:44:30.616 A:middle
we'll be more likely to
treat a task more urgently,

00:44:30.616 --> 00:44:32.456 A:middle
since the user's
more likely to notice

00:44:32.796 --> 00:44:34.326 A:middle
when those resources
are downloaded.

00:44:36.156 --> 00:44:39.406 A:middle
One improvement that
we've made in iOS 8

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:41.976 A:middle
for discretionary transfers,
is that tasks are treated

00:44:41.976 --> 00:44:43.606 A:middle
with more urgency
as time goes on.

00:44:43.606 --> 00:44:46.676 A:middle
In iOS 7, discretionary
transfers were limited

00:44:46.676 --> 00:44:47.636 A:middle
to Wi-Fi only.

00:44:48.226 --> 00:44:51.486 A:middle
Now, while we may limit
discretionary transfers

00:44:51.486 --> 00:44:55.456 A:middle
to run while there is Wi-Fi
and plugged in at first,

00:44:55.766 --> 00:44:58.096 A:middle
these constraints will
relax as time goes on.

00:44:58.436 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
As we approach the resource
timeout that's specified


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.436 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
As we approach the resource
timeout that's specified

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.556 A:middle
on your configuration
object, we'll be more likely

00:45:04.556 --> 00:45:07.516 A:middle
to relax these conditions
and allow transfers

00:45:07.516 --> 00:45:08.766 A:middle
over battery and cellular data.

00:45:11.056 --> 00:45:12.906 A:middle
There are a couple
different ways

00:45:12.906 --> 00:45:14.606 A:middle
that you can use
discretionary networking

00:45:14.686 --> 00:45:15.776 A:middle
in a background session.

00:45:16.636 --> 00:45:18.506 A:middle
One way is by explicitly opting

00:45:18.506 --> 00:45:21.306 A:middle
in using the discretionary
property which is just a boolean

00:45:21.336 --> 00:45:23.396 A:middle
in an NSURLSessionConfiguration.

00:45:23.986 --> 00:45:25.836 A:middle
This was made available on iOS 7

00:45:25.906 --> 00:45:27.756 A:middle
and is now available
on OS X Yosemite.

00:45:28.946 --> 00:45:30.596 A:middle
You might want to do
this for any tasks

00:45:30.596 --> 00:45:32.296 A:middle
that aren't really
user-initiated.

00:45:32.766 --> 00:45:34.766 A:middle
So let's say you have, you know,

00:45:34.766 --> 00:45:38.106 A:middle
an app that lets users watch
episodes of a TV series.

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:40.976 A:middle
And they're watching an episode
that they've downloaded already,

00:45:40.976 --> 00:45:43.606 A:middle
and maybe you want to pre-fetch
the next one so it's ready

00:45:43.636 --> 00:45:46.566 A:middle
for them when they're finished
watching the current episode.

00:45:47.036 --> 00:45:50.356 A:middle
Now, that's not something the
user explicitly requested.

00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:52.286 A:middle
So that's something
that you might want

00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:53.306 A:middle
to treat as discretionary.

00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:56.036 A:middle
Similarly, if you have an app

00:45:56.036 --> 00:45:58.926 A:middle
and the user is modifying
a document, you might want

00:45:58.926 --> 00:46:02.506 A:middle
to upload that document
to your app servers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.926 --> 00:46:02.506 A:middle
to upload that document
to your app servers

00:46:02.506 --> 00:46:04.706 A:middle
so that it's accessible from
the users other devices.

00:46:04.706 --> 00:46:06.706 A:middle
And this might also be
something that's discretionary.

00:46:06.796 --> 00:46:12.296 A:middle
On iOS there are also times
when we will treat tasks

00:46:12.296 --> 00:46:13.516 A:middle
as discretionary automatically.

00:46:13.896 --> 00:46:16.096 A:middle
This happens when your app
is running in the background.

00:46:16.916 --> 00:46:21.686 A:middle
In iOS 7, we introduced a
few new multitasking APIs.

00:46:21.686 --> 00:46:24.166 A:middle
Most notably background
fetch updates,

00:46:24.466 --> 00:46:26.246 A:middle
and handling silent
push notifications

00:46:26.246 --> 00:46:28.776 A:middle
where your app gets a limited
amount of time, on the order

00:46:28.776 --> 00:46:31.986 A:middle
of 30 to 60 seconds, to run in
the background to make updates.

00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:36.166 A:middle
When used in-this is really
great when used in conjunction

00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:37.776 A:middle
with background uploads
and downloads.

00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:40.596 A:middle
But because the user doesn't
know that your app is running

00:46:40.596 --> 00:46:44.186 A:middle
at this time, any
downloads or uploads

00:46:44.186 --> 00:46:47.846 A:middle
that you enqueue will be treated
as discretionary automatically

00:46:48.356 --> 00:46:50.156 A:middle
because this work can't
be user-initiated,

00:46:50.156 --> 00:46:51.726 A:middle
because the user doesn't
know that you're running.

00:46:52.686 --> 00:46:56.786 A:middle
One improvement that we've
made here in iOS 8 is that any

00:46:56.786 --> 00:46:58.456 A:middle
of these tasks that
we automatically treat

00:46:58.456 --> 00:47:01.016 A:middle
as discretionary will
become non-discretionary


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.456 --> 00:47:01.016 A:middle
as discretionary will
become non-discretionary

00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:03.696 A:middle
if the user launches the app
and brings it to the foreground.

00:47:04.936 --> 00:47:06.126 A:middle
I've mentioned a couple times

00:47:06.126 --> 00:47:08.756 A:middle
that on iOS we will launch
your apps in the background

00:47:08.756 --> 00:47:10.476 A:middle
to handle events
like authentication

00:47:10.686 --> 00:47:12.066 A:middle
and the completion
of all your tasks.

00:47:12.066 --> 00:47:13.106 A:middle
I want to talk a little bit

00:47:13.106 --> 00:47:14.636 A:middle
about how you handle
those events.

00:47:15.376 --> 00:47:19.946 A:middle
In iOS 7, we introduced a new
method on UIApplicationDelegate,

00:47:20.136 --> 00:47:21.006 A:middle
called application:

00:47:21.006 --> 00:47:23.536 A:middle
handleEventsForBackground
URLSession:completionHandler.

00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:27.156 A:middle
When this is called, you'll be
provided with the identifier

00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:29.116 A:middle
of the session that
needs your attention.

00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:31.446 A:middle
And at this point you should
reconnect to that session

00:47:31.726 --> 00:47:34.276 A:middle
by creating a background
configuration object

00:47:34.276 --> 00:47:36.806 A:middle
with that identifier,
and then an NSURLSession

00:47:36.806 --> 00:47:38.296 A:middle
from that configuration object.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:41.726 A:middle
At this point you'll immediately
begin receiving the delegate

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:43.186 A:middle
messages that you missed.

00:47:43.186 --> 00:47:45.176 A:middle
Maybe authentication challenges

00:47:45.176 --> 00:47:46.926 A:middle
or didCompleteWithError
callbacks.

00:47:47.706 --> 00:47:50.006 A:middle
And after you're finished
handling these events,

00:47:50.236 --> 00:47:51.946 A:middle
you'll want to call
the completionHandler

00:47:51.946 --> 00:47:55.536 A:middle
that was provided to your
UIApplicationDelegate.

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.486 A:middle
This completionHandler allows
us to take a snapshot of your UI

00:47:59.706 --> 00:48:01.856 A:middle
to show up in the app switcher,
so that it's up-to-date


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.706 --> 00:48:01.856 A:middle
to show up in the app switcher,
so that it's up-to-date

00:48:01.856 --> 00:48:03.696 A:middle
when the user double-clicks
the home button.

00:48:04.696 --> 00:48:07.126 A:middle
It also allows us
to suspend your app.

00:48:07.126 --> 00:48:08.956 A:middle
Now, when you're
launched to handle events

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:12.466 A:middle
for background sessions, you'll
again be given a limited amount

00:48:12.466 --> 00:48:13.016 A:middle
of time to run

00:48:13.016 --> 00:48:15.066 A:middle
in the background-around
30 to 60 seconds.

00:48:15.786 --> 00:48:17.606 A:middle
If you don't call your
completion handler

00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:19.716 A:middle
within this time, your
app will be terminated,

00:48:19.716 --> 00:48:21.846 A:middle
meaning it won't have
an up-to-date snapshot

00:48:21.846 --> 00:48:25.016 A:middle
and it will be slower to launch
the next time the user wants

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:26.136 A:middle
to launch your app.

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.926 A:middle
So it's important that you
call this completionHandler

00:48:27.926 --> 00:48:29.836 A:middle
so your app gets suspended
and has an up-to-date UI.

00:48:31.006 --> 00:48:33.746 A:middle
Once you're finished receiving
all the pending events

00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:34.786 A:middle
from your NSURLSession,

00:48:34.786 --> 00:48:37.686 A:middle
we'll deliver the URLSessionDid
FinishEventsForBackground

00:48:37.686 --> 00:48:40.996 A:middle
URLSession message to
your NSURLSessionDelegate.

00:48:41.226 --> 00:48:43.116 A:middle
And this is an indication
of when it's a good time

00:48:43.116 --> 00:48:46.406 A:middle
to call your completionHandler
past your UIApplicationDelegate.

00:48:46.856 --> 00:48:51.116 A:middle
I'd also like to talk
about using data tasks

00:48:51.206 --> 00:48:52.296 A:middle
in background sessions.

00:48:52.856 --> 00:48:55.196 A:middle
Steve mentioned earlier
that data tasks,

00:48:55.196 --> 00:48:56.736 A:middle
instead of downloading to a file

00:48:56.736 --> 00:49:01.566 A:middle
or on disk will just deliver
didReceiveData callbacks


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:56.736 --> 00:49:01.566 A:middle
or on disk will just deliver
didReceiveData callbacks

00:49:01.566 --> 00:49:02.086 A:middle
in memory.

00:49:02.716 --> 00:49:05.316 A:middle
Now data tasks were unavailable
in background sessions

00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:07.396 A:middle
in iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:11.216 A:middle
But they're now available
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite

00:49:11.346 --> 00:49:13.536 A:middle
with one restriction, which is

00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:16.236 A:middle
that we will only
perform a data task

00:49:16.236 --> 00:49:18.576 A:middle
in the background session while
your app is actually running.

00:49:19.086 --> 00:49:22.286 A:middle
If your app gets suspended or is
terminated, then there is no one

00:49:22.286 --> 00:49:24.746 A:middle
to deliver that data to,
so it makes no sense for us

00:49:24.746 --> 00:49:25.836 A:middle
to continue performing it.

00:49:26.866 --> 00:49:30.146 A:middle
However, you can
convert it to a download

00:49:30.536 --> 00:49:31.816 A:middle
when you receive the response.

00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:34.136 A:middle
Steve eluded to this
earlier when talking

00:49:34.136 --> 00:49:35.896 A:middle
about the didReceiveResponse
callback.

00:49:36.666 --> 00:49:39.946 A:middle
That delegate message
provides a completionHandler.

00:49:40.316 --> 00:49:42.546 A:middle
And you can pass
NSURLSessionResponse

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:45.396 A:middle
BecomeDownload to
that completionHandler

00:49:45.696 --> 00:49:47.616 A:middle
and then we'll start
streaming the bytes to a file

00:49:47.616 --> 00:49:48.916 A:middle
on disk rather than memory.

00:49:49.476 --> 00:49:52.476 A:middle
Once you do that, this
becomes a download

00:49:52.476 --> 00:49:55.896 A:middle
that can be continued even after
your app is suspended or exits.

00:49:57.096 --> 00:50:00.036 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about
a couple common pitfalls


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:57.096 --> 00:50:00.036 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about
a couple common pitfalls

00:50:00.036 --> 00:50:01.436 A:middle
that we've seen from
apps in the past

00:50:01.436 --> 00:50:02.656 A:middle
when using background sessions.

00:50:03.096 --> 00:50:06.066 A:middle
One common pattern that we've
seen that we'd like developers

00:50:06.066 --> 00:50:09.016 A:middle
to avoid is a pattern where
they create one task at a time.

00:50:09.546 --> 00:50:12.546 A:middle
So you might, for instance,
be downloading a large video

00:50:12.546 --> 00:50:13.576 A:middle
from your server that's split

00:50:13.576 --> 00:50:16.836 A:middle
up into many different smaller
segments, each a separate file.

00:50:17.866 --> 00:50:20.396 A:middle
If you download all of
these and if you, let's say,

00:50:20.626 --> 00:50:24.016 A:middle
create a download task for the
first task for the first asset

00:50:24.016 --> 00:50:25.736 A:middle
and then create a
second download task

00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:28.156 A:middle
for the next asset once
the first one completes,

00:50:28.496 --> 00:50:31.316 A:middle
this is a really bad
pattern, particularly because,

00:50:31.316 --> 00:50:35.506 A:middle
if the user suspends the app
by going to the home screen

00:50:35.506 --> 00:50:38.476 A:middle
at any point, than you'll
actually need to be re-launched

00:50:38.476 --> 00:50:42.656 A:middle
in the background once the
current download finishes before

00:50:42.656 --> 00:50:43.856 A:middle
you can enqueue your next one.

00:50:44.266 --> 00:50:45.996 A:middle
This means because it's
running in the background

00:50:45.996 --> 00:50:48.056 A:middle
that it will automatically
be treated as discretionary,

00:50:48.806 --> 00:50:51.116 A:middle
which means we won't guarantee
that it will start right away.

00:50:52.196 --> 00:50:53.306 A:middle
In particular, even

00:50:53.306 --> 00:50:56.906 A:middle
if conditions are great-we're
100% charged and connected

00:50:56.906 --> 00:51:00.116 A:middle
to a power source
and we're connected


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:56.906 --> 00:51:00.116 A:middle
to a power source
and we're connected

00:51:00.116 --> 00:51:02.756 A:middle
to a great Wi-Fi network,
we still make no guarantees

00:51:02.756 --> 00:51:03.686 A:middle
that we'll start right away.

00:51:03.796 --> 00:51:05.926 A:middle
In particular, the
system will take measures

00:51:05.926 --> 00:51:08.086 A:middle
to prevent your app from
being launched too frequently.

00:51:08.516 --> 00:51:11.506 A:middle
So you can't rely on launches
for background sessions

00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:13.696 A:middle
for any sort of regular
launch events.

00:51:14.626 --> 00:51:17.836 A:middle
Tying in with this, it's
much better if instead

00:51:17.836 --> 00:51:20.406 A:middle
of downloading lots of
small assets like this,

00:51:20.406 --> 00:51:22.366 A:middle
if you can zip these
up on your server

00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:23.986 A:middle
into one large zipped asset.

00:51:23.986 --> 00:51:26.326 A:middle
That's much more efficient
for a background download.

00:51:27.086 --> 00:51:29.796 A:middle
And finally, blocking
while waiting for transfers

00:51:29.796 --> 00:51:31.756 A:middle
to complete is just
a really bad idea

00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:33.116 A:middle
when doing any kind
of networking.

00:51:33.116 --> 00:51:35.286 A:middle
But it's particularly bad
in a background session

00:51:35.286 --> 00:51:37.476 A:middle
where we recover from
network failures automatically

00:51:37.476 --> 00:51:39.656 A:middle
and don't tell you
about them and, again,

00:51:39.656 --> 00:51:40.836 A:middle
for discretionary transfers

00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:42.536 A:middle
where we're not guaranteed
to start right away.

00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:47.006 A:middle
I'd also like to go over
a couple best practices

00:51:47.006 --> 00:51:48.576 A:middle
for using background sessions

00:51:48.576 --> 00:51:50.326 A:middle
and also NSURLSession
in general.

00:51:51.276 --> 00:51:53.926 A:middle
One common mistake that we
think some people have made

00:51:53.926 --> 00:51:56.726 A:middle
in the past is that they've
assumed that when running

00:51:56.726 --> 00:51:58.536 A:middle
in the background
to handle things

00:51:58.536 --> 00:52:01.246 A:middle
like a background fetch update
or a silent push notification,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.536 --> 00:52:01.246 A:middle
like a background fetch update
or a silent push notification,

00:52:01.406 --> 00:52:03.556 A:middle
that they've been required
to use background sessions.

00:52:03.936 --> 00:52:06.506 A:middle
Now, using background uploads
or downloads with these forms

00:52:06.506 --> 00:52:09.006 A:middle
of multitasking works
really well,

00:52:09.386 --> 00:52:11.616 A:middle
but in particular
for large downloads.

00:52:12.326 --> 00:52:14.066 A:middle
When you're running for
a background fetch update

00:52:14.066 --> 00:52:16.796 A:middle
or a silent push notification,
as I said, you'll have about 30

00:52:16.796 --> 00:52:18.746 A:middle
to 60 seconds to run
in the background.

00:52:19.356 --> 00:52:22.266 A:middle
Now if you have any
small networking tasks

00:52:22.526 --> 00:52:24.636 A:middle
that could finish within this
time, it's perfectly okay

00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:27.746 A:middle
to do them in an in-process
or default NSURLSession.

00:52:28.396 --> 00:52:31.296 A:middle
If you have something like a
Twitter client that's going

00:52:31.296 --> 00:52:33.756 A:middle
to be downloading a few tweets
for a background fetch update,

00:52:33.966 --> 00:52:35.806 A:middle
that's totally doable
in process.

00:52:35.896 --> 00:52:38.666 A:middle
On the other hand, if you
want to download, you know,

00:52:38.666 --> 00:52:40.426 A:middle
the next episode of a TV series,

00:52:40.426 --> 00:52:43.196 A:middle
that's something that's fairly
large and probably not going

00:52:43.256 --> 00:52:45.526 A:middle
to finish within the
60 seconds you have

00:52:45.526 --> 00:52:47.926 A:middle
to run-that should be done
in a background session.

00:52:48.926 --> 00:52:52.836 A:middle
It's also important that you
support resumable downloads

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:53.496 A:middle
on your servers.

00:52:53.946 --> 00:52:57.336 A:middle
As I mentioned in a background
session, we retry automatically

00:52:57.336 --> 00:52:59.846 A:middle
after network failures
if the user goes off

00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:00.976 A:middle
of Wi-Fi, for instance.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:00.976 A:middle
of Wi-Fi, for instance.

00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:03.576 A:middle
So if you support resumable
downloads, we don't have

00:53:03.656 --> 00:53:05.956 A:middle
to re-download bytes
we've already received.

00:53:06.286 --> 00:53:08.676 A:middle
But if you don't, than we have
to start from the beginning.

00:53:09.306 --> 00:53:11.546 A:middle
Now supporting resumable
downloads is generally just

00:53:11.546 --> 00:53:14.296 A:middle
as simple as supporting Range
GET requests on your servers.

00:53:14.296 --> 00:53:16.516 A:middle
And most servers should
support this configuration

00:53:16.516 --> 00:53:17.216 A:middle
out of the box.

00:53:18.316 --> 00:53:19.816 A:middle
Finally, it's very important

00:53:19.816 --> 00:53:21.796 A:middle
that you handle launch
events properly,

00:53:22.126 --> 00:53:23.456 A:middle
as I talked about before.

00:53:23.666 --> 00:53:26.876 A:middle
This means when you get launch
to handle a background session,

00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:29.396 A:middle
you should reconnect to
that background session

00:53:29.636 --> 00:53:31.656 A:middle
and handle any messages.

00:53:31.656 --> 00:53:34.346 A:middle
This is particularly
important with authentication.

00:53:34.346 --> 00:53:36.786 A:middle
Because if you don't respond
to an authentication challenge,

00:53:37.116 --> 00:53:39.096 A:middle
then that task will
timeout and fail.

00:53:39.096 --> 00:53:40.446 A:middle
And that's not what
the user wants.

00:53:40.766 --> 00:53:43.806 A:middle
Finally, be sure to call the
completion handler that's past

00:53:43.806 --> 00:53:45.866 A:middle
your UIApplicationDelegate.

00:53:46.066 --> 00:53:48.786 A:middle
As I said before, this allows
your UI to be up-to-date

00:53:48.786 --> 00:53:51.566 A:middle
in the app switcher and makes
it so your app is suspended

00:53:51.566 --> 00:53:53.356 A:middle
after it's completed
instead of being terminated.

00:53:55.176 --> 00:53:57.926 A:middle
Before I wrap up, I'd just
like to give a brief summary

00:53:58.176 --> 00:54:00.286 A:middle
of what we discussed today.

00:53:58.176 --> 00:54:00.286 A:middle
of what we discussed today.

00:54:00.286 --> 00:54:03.456 A:middle
First we talked about new APIs
and NSStream and NSNetService.

00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:09.356 A:middle
We gave a review of using
NSURLSession from what we talked

00:54:09.356 --> 00:54:11.326 A:middle
about in last year's
WWDC session.

00:54:12.346 --> 00:54:15.416 A:middle
We talked about SPDY and
new protocol support.

00:54:16.016 --> 00:54:19.606 A:middle
And went over some new
features and best use cases

00:54:19.606 --> 00:54:21.276 A:middle
in background networking.

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:27.166 A:middle
In case you don't get the
chance to ask us any questions

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:28.706 A:middle
in person this week
while you're here,

00:54:28.916 --> 00:54:32.026 A:middle
Paul Danbold is our
Technologies Evangelist.

00:54:32.316 --> 00:54:34.356 A:middle
And he's a great person
to ask for any questions

00:54:34.356 --> 00:54:35.666 A:middle
that you might have that
you don't get a chance

00:54:35.666 --> 00:54:38.556 A:middle
to ask us while you're here.

00:54:38.556 --> 00:54:40.566 A:middle
We also have plenty of
documentation available

00:54:40.566 --> 00:54:43.636 A:middle
at developer.apple.com,
including for NSURLSession.

00:54:44.146 --> 00:54:46.526 A:middle
The Apple developer forums
are another great place

00:54:46.526 --> 00:54:48.506 A:middle
to ask questions that you don't
get to ask while you're here.

00:54:49.656 --> 00:54:52.376 A:middle
I'd also like to point you
at a couple related sessions

00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:53.646 A:middle
that are going on this week.

00:54:53.646 --> 00:54:55.246 A:middle
In particular you
might be interested

00:54:55.516 --> 00:54:57.596 A:middle
in the Extensions sessions.

00:54:57.596 --> 00:54:59.146 A:middle
There are two of them.

00:54:59.146 --> 00:55:00.936 A:middle
You can learn more about
creating app extensions,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:59.146 --> 00:55:00.936 A:middle
You can learn more about
creating app extensions,

00:55:00.936 --> 00:55:02.056 A:middle
and we'll also talk a little bit

00:55:02.056 --> 00:55:04.526 A:middle
about using background
sessions and app extensions.

00:55:05.536 --> 00:55:07.906 A:middle
With that, I'd like to
thank you all for coming.

00:55:07.906 --> 00:55:10.196 A:middle
And we look forward to seeing
the amazing apps you create

00:55:10.196 --> 00:55:12.576 A:middle
with iOS 8 and OS X
Yosemite [applause].
