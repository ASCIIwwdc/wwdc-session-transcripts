We're shipping the best
Macs in our history.

00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:45.066 A:middle
If you look just in
this last fiscal year,

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:51.986 A:middle
while the industry declined by 5
percent Macs grew by 12 percent,

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
that's swelled our installed
base of Macs to over 80 million,

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.736 A:middle
which is a record for us.

We're really proud of this.

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:04.416 A:middle
And of course our latest release

00:09:04.416 --> 00:09:07.296 A:middle
of OS X Mavericks has
done really great.

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:13.706 A:middle
It had great features for power
users like power tabs, and tags,

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:16.056 A:middle
and enhanced support
for multiple displays.

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:19.536 A:middle
Advanced technologies
for longer battery life

00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:20.996 A:middle
and greater performance.

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:23.556 A:middle
And of course, new
and improved apps.

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:27.866 A:middle
Just since its release in
October we've installed

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:30.866 A:middle
over 40 million copies
of Mavericks.

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:35.916 A:middle
This is the most of a single
release ever in Apple's history.

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:44.896 A:middle
Also, that makes over 50 percent
of our installed base working

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:47.366 A:middle
on our latest operating system.

00:09:48.386 --> 00:09:51.256 A:middle
This is the fastest
adoption ever

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:56.296 A:middle
of any PC operating
system in history.

00:09:56.416 --> 00:10:00.476 A:middle

that compares to Windows.

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:11.146 A:middle
Well, as it turns
out Windows 8 shipped

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:15.266 A:middle
about a year before Mavericks
and it's at 14 percent.

[ Applause ]

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:33.716 A:middle
So, we could not be happier
with Mavericks and the momentum

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
of the Mac, but of course
we're always future focused.

00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:41.526 A:middle
And today, to talk about
the future of OS X,

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:45.106 A:middle
I'd like to invite my
colleague up, Craig Federighi,

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:46.176 A:middle
to tell us all about it.

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:46.806 A:middle

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:09.336 A:middle
You guys are fantastic.

00:11:09.676 --> 00:11:13.176 A:middle
You know, it was just a
year ago, here at WWDC,

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:18.496 A:middle
when we narrowly averted a
major OS X naming crisis.

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:20.756 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:11:20.756 --> 00:11:25.036 A:middle
You may remember that we're able
to deftly shift from names based

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:29.676 A:middle
on big cats to names based on
beautiful places in California,

00:11:30.236 --> 00:11:33.256 A:middle
starting of course
with OS X Mavericks.

00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:37.296 A:middle
Well, it's another year
and time for another name

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:41.326 A:middle
and so we collected our
crack product marketing team,

00:11:42.566 --> 00:11:46.826 A:middle
shoved them in their VW Minibus
and set them out on the road.

00:11:47.446 --> 00:11:51.496 A:middle
Now, they first ventured south
discovering OS X, Oxnard.

But undeterred, they
headed east,

00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:01.546 A:middle
landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.

quite hit the mark.

north landing at OS X Weed.

within the product
marketing organization,

00:12:26.216 --> 00:12:30.946 A:middle
but saner heads did
prevail and they set off

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:34.556 A:middle
on what then was somewhat
more circuitous path.

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:36.316 A:middle
It took them ultimately
to a place

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:39.696 A:middle
that embodies the
beauty and power of OS X.

00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:43.736 A:middle

our most popular apps

and something all knew,
we call Continuity.

00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:09.866 A:middle
Now, I want to start
with design.

00:13:10.406 --> 00:13:14.896 A:middle
OS X, of course started with
the bold design of Aqua.

00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:18.096 A:middle
And over the years, it's evolved

00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:22.276 A:middle
to the refined look we all
loved today in Mavericks.

00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:27.266 A:middle
Well, with Yosemite, we
continue this evolution and I'd

00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:31.946 A:middle
like to give you a look
at where we're headed.

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:39.226 A:middle
I think the team has done
some remarkable work.

You know, we started with the
most fundamental controls,

00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:47.666 A:middle
focused always on clarity,
as well as utility.

00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:53.056 A:middle
We refined the tool bars
and the window materials

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.866 A:middle
and the window constructions.

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:57.896 A:middle
If you look at the window title
bar, you'll see how the use

00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:00.366 A:middle
of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:00.366 A:middle
of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.786 A:middle
as you scroll your content.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:05.586 A:middle
Now, these same carefully
crafted translucent materials

00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:07.256 A:middle
are used in the sidebars.

00:15:07.716 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
So now, your windows take on
the personality of your desktop.

00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:16.236 A:middle
As you change your desktop
picture, your window adapts

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:19.016 A:middle
to reflect that personality
and that temperature.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:23.336 A:middle
And the translucency also
helps maintain a sense of depth

00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:27.126 A:middle
and place as you move your
windows over one another.

00:15:28.246 --> 00:15:31.506 A:middle
Now, we also use the same
gorgeous translucent material

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:36.666 A:middle
for the dock and check out these
beautifully crafted new icons.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.716 A:middle
So clean and yet so
fundamentally still Mac.

00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:45.076 A:middle
And check out the trash can,
that is a gorgeous trash can.

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:47.246 A:middle
You wouldn't believe how
much time we spent crafting a

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:47.956 A:middle
trash can.

[ Laughter ]

00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:52.206 A:middle
So, we also focused on precise

00:15:52.206 --> 00:15:54.356 A:middle
and consistent typography
throughout.

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.766 A:middle
So, from the menus
to the window chrome

00:15:56.766 --> 00:16:00.136 A:middle
to application control is
consistent and clear type.

to application control is
consistent and clear type.

00:16:00.946 --> 00:16:04.476 A:middle
Now, we know, for our pro users,
often, they really want to focus

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.746 A:middle
on the center on the
screen and not be distracted

00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:08.866 A:middle
by bright menus and
bright docks,

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:12.156 A:middle
so we also introduced
a dark mode.

Lovers of dark.

00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:22.606 A:middle
Yes. So, of course
these changes extend

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.336 A:middle
through to the applications.

00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:27.876 A:middle
You notice here, with
Calendar, this construction

00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:30.266 A:middle
with a common toolbar
and title bar area

00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:33.236 A:middle
that makes the window both
more distinctly recognizable,

00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:36.866 A:middle
but more importantly maximizes
the space available for content.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:38.016 A:middle
And we carry this

00:16:38.016 --> 00:16:41.306 A:middle
over throughout the
system to apps like Maps.

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:45.456 A:middle
Now, we also have a new look
for sidebar apps, like Messages,

00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:47.606 A:middle
you can see it here with the
beautiful translucent material

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:49.366 A:middle
running top to bottom.

00:16:49.866 --> 00:16:52.236 A:middle
And we extend that look
to apps like FaceTime,

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.196 A:middle
Contacts, and Reminders.

00:16:55.956 --> 00:16:59.046 A:middle

and precise type of Yosemite.

00:17:23.195 --> 00:17:26.626 A:middle
It also now, most importantly,
has a new Today view.

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:29.906 A:middle
So, you get an at-a-glance
look at your Calendar,

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:35.246 A:middle
your Reminders, Weather, and
more, but most importantly,

00:17:35.506 --> 00:17:39.226 A:middle
you can extend the contents of
Today view with the contents

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:42.316 A:middle
of widgets and apps that you've
downloaded from the App Store.

00:17:42.836 --> 00:17:46.586 A:middle
Just add them right in and set
up the Today view, that you want

00:17:46.586 --> 00:17:48.806 A:middle
for at-a-glance access
to information.

00:17:50.116 --> 00:17:52.156 A:middle

So Spotlight has always
been a superfast way

00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:06.236 A:middle
to launch applications and
find content local on your Mac.

00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.806 A:middle
And Yosemite is a
great new interface.

00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:11.206 A:middle
So when you click on
the magnifying glass

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:12.896 A:middle
on the toolbar you'll
get a big field right

00:18:12.896 --> 00:18:14.016 A:middle
in the middle of the display.

00:18:14.016 --> 00:18:16.536 A:middle
And if you just type
a few characters,

00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:20.136 A:middle
you can launch an app just
like that, or type the name

00:18:20.136 --> 00:18:22.826 A:middle
of a document and you
get great search results

00:18:22.826 --> 00:18:25.466 A:middle
and an inline preview,
it's really awesome.

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:28.476 A:middle
Now, in addition to these
sources, local to your Mac,

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:31.986 A:middle
we also tap into sources of
information on the internet.

00:18:32.436 --> 00:18:35.796 A:middle
So for instance, type a few
characters in like Yosemite,

00:18:35.796 --> 00:18:38.926 A:middle
you can get news feed,
information from Wikipedia,

00:18:39.156 --> 00:18:41.946 A:middle

Let's launch an app.

00:19:03.546 --> 00:19:06.316 A:middle
I'm going to start here with
Maps and I want you to observe

00:19:06.316 --> 00:19:08.546 A:middle
that as I scroll the
content of the map,

00:19:08.956 --> 00:19:12.586 A:middle
the way that the title bar
actually reacts its translucency

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:16.596 A:middle
and color to the content
beneath is just really gorgeous.

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:18.906 A:middle
I'm going to launch
now another app.

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:23.256 A:middle
Calendar. So Calendar has
a new look for a week view

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:25.346 A:middle
but also an all new day view.

00:19:25.656 --> 00:19:28.266 A:middle
And you notice here on day
view, I have all of my meetings

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:30.176 A:middle
in the day right
here on the left,

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.966 A:middle
and on the right I got
details about my appointments.

00:19:32.966 --> 00:19:34.426 A:middle
So for instance,
here at 2 o'clock,

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.496 A:middle
we have our executive
karaoke outing,

00:19:36.656 --> 00:19:39.396 A:middle
that's going to be big blast.

00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:40.256 A:middle
It's right there.

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:42.876 A:middle
You want to probably drop in
on that if you get the chance.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:46.126 A:middle
So let's take a look
now at Messages.

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:47.896 A:middle
So Messages, you see this use

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:51.236 A:middle
of the translucent sidebar
material, how it reacts subtly

00:19:51.236 --> 00:19:54.406 A:middle
to the background is really
nice, and how the contents

00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:58.416 A:middle
of the title bar react as I
scroll content underneath.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:19:59.846 A:middle
It's really cool.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:02.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at
Notification Center.

00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:05.086 A:middle
So of course, I have
my notifications here,

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:08.646 A:middle
but I also have Today view
so I can see my Calendar

00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:10.206 A:middle
at a glance, my Weather.

00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
These are interactive so I
can click, get hourly weather,

00:20:13.586 --> 00:20:16.946 A:middle
clock, interact with stocks for
instance, or even Reminders.

00:20:16.946 --> 00:20:19.336 A:middle
So here I'm supposed to practice
for the demo and I forgot to do

00:20:19.336 --> 00:20:20.446 A:middle
that but it's too late now.

00:20:20.926 --> 00:20:22.256 A:middle
So, we'll send out
one on its way.

00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:25.956 A:middle
Now, of course, I can edit
these widgets as well,

00:20:25.956 --> 00:20:27.446 A:middle
just click the Edit
button down here

00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:29.886 A:middle
and you see widgets available
to me right here on the side.

00:20:29.956 --> 00:20:32.636 A:middle
These are all from apps
that can export widgets.

00:20:32.636 --> 00:20:34.686 A:middle
So I'm just going to
drag out Calculator,

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
add that in here just like that
or even a third party widget.

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:40.996 A:middle
Let's drag one of those
in, ESPN SportsCenter.

00:20:40.996 --> 00:20:44.766 A:middle
So right there, I get all my
information right at a glance.

00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:46.306 A:middle
It's really awesome.

00:20:47.516 --> 00:20:52.296 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:52.796 --> 00:20:53.956 A:middle
So next. Spotlight.

00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
So I'm going to click here on
the magnifying glass and, boom,

00:20:56.936 --> 00:20:58.946 A:middle
got a search field right in
the middle of the screen.

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:01.556 A:middle
I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app

I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app

00:21:01.556 --> 00:21:02.536 A:middle
like our new reminders.

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:03.806 A:middle
There it is.

00:21:03.806 --> 00:21:04.666 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:07.516 A:middle
But of course, Spotlight is
great for looking up people too.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.296 A:middle
So I'm going to look
up Phil Schiller here.

00:21:09.776 --> 00:21:10.606 A:middle
There's Phil.

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:13.306 A:middle
And you see I have all of
his contact information here,

00:21:13.756 --> 00:21:16.256 A:middle
but I also have matches
on mail from Phil.

00:21:16.256 --> 00:21:18.356 A:middle
Phil and I are planning
a camping trip.

00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:20.046 A:middle
He's a bit of a gear nut
and has something he wants

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:21.616 A:middle
to try out on our trip.

00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:23.616 A:middle
We also have Events
and Reminders.

00:21:23.936 --> 00:21:27.956 A:middle
So we have here that our Meeting
at the Campsite and-- oh, good.

00:21:27.956 --> 00:21:31.166 A:middle
I see that Jeff and Johnny are
both in on the trip as well.

00:21:31.736 --> 00:21:35.266 A:middle
And I'll tell you, you just have
not had chili by the campfire

00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:36.166 A:middle
until you've eaten it with one

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.976 A:middle
of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons.

00:21:38.016 --> 00:21:39.296 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:21:39.296 --> 00:21:42.326 A:middle
It's a-- it's the diamond
cut chamfered edges

00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:43.826 A:middle
that really make the experience.

00:21:45.916 --> 00:21:50.606 A:middle
So, I'm working on a document
as well to help plan our trip.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.616 A:middle
Now, there are a lot of ways
of course to find documents,

00:21:52.616 --> 00:21:53.926 A:middle
but one way now is by app.

00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:55.606 A:middle
So this is a numbers document.

00:21:56.036 --> 00:21:58.296 A:middle
I typed numbers and you
see in addition to the app,

00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app

00:22:02.006 --> 00:22:03.116 A:middle
and I can access
them right here.

00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:04.636 A:middle
So let's open up my hiking trip.

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:10.656 A:middle
And here we see that the trip
has planned involved a 16.4 mile

00:22:10.656 --> 00:22:14.356 A:middle
hike and you're being an
operations professional.

00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:16.636 A:middle
Jeff is a big stickler
for the metric system.

00:22:17.056 --> 00:22:19.696 A:middle
And so, fortunately,
Spotlight has my back.

00:22:19.696 --> 00:22:23.406 A:middle
I can just type in
16.4 miles here

00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:26.636 A:middle
and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers.

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.306 A:middle
So that's awfully handy.

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:29.926 A:middle
We do all kinds of conversion.

00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:32.646 A:middle
They drop that in, fix
that document right up.

00:22:33.266 --> 00:22:35.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:35.936 A:middle
All right.

00:22:35.936 --> 00:22:38.286 A:middle
Well, that's enough
for my document.

00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:41.076 A:middle
I can also do great searches
like just type a few characters,

00:22:41.396 --> 00:22:45.336 A:middle
bang, I've got Yosemite
entry from Wikipedia.

00:22:46.006 --> 00:22:49.376 A:middle
I've got news from
various sources.

00:22:49.376 --> 00:22:51.446 A:middle
I even have maps right here.

00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:55.786 A:middle
Well, you know, I'm looking to
plan a dinner and maybe a movie

00:22:55.786 --> 00:22:58.006 A:middle
out and now without
even launching an app,

00:22:58.006 --> 00:23:00.266 A:middle
I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance.

I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance.

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:03.466 A:middle
And we see I have maps
results right here,

00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:05.916 A:middle
right inside of Spotlight.

00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:08.096 A:middle
And of course, in addition
to map information,

00:23:08.266 --> 00:23:10.336 A:middle
we've got pictures,
great information

00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:12.256 A:middle
from Yelp, it's all right there.

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:14.836 A:middle
And to wrap it up, I want
to go out to a movie.

00:23:14.836 --> 00:23:17.546 A:middle
You can just type
in Godzilla here.

00:23:17.576 --> 00:23:19.396 A:middle
Oh, there we go, Godzilla.

00:23:19.396 --> 00:23:22.396 A:middle
And you see, I have show times

00:23:22.596 --> 00:23:26.456 A:middle
where it's playing near me
right here in Spotlight as well

00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:31.346 A:middle
as content I can stream from the
iTunes Store, all in Spotlight.

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:35.976 A:middle

the new UI of Yosemite.

Now-- OK, intriguing.

00:23:53.106 --> 00:23:56.396 A:middle
So, we all know that

way for working with an app

00:24:00.196 --> 00:24:03.386 A:middle
that works across all platforms
working on the same document.

00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:05.926 A:middle
But now with iCloud Drive,

00:24:06.576 --> 00:24:08.336 A:middle
your Mac in addition will
let you work on those

00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:13.576 A:middle
all of those folders right
accessible inside of Finder.

00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:16.266 A:middle
And in addition to those
apps that are local

00:24:16.266 --> 00:24:18.636 A:middle
to your Mac you can
get a content from apps

00:24:18.636 --> 00:24:19.636 A:middle
that you don't have on your Mac,

00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.736 A:middle
so get a contents
from iOS documents.

00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:26.036 A:middle
But even better, you can
store all of your own files

00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:30.366 A:middle
of any sort and organize them
however you wish with folders

00:24:30.366 --> 00:24:33.476 A:middle

So, Mail in Yosemite has an
elegant new Yosemite style UI.

00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:11.176 A:middle
But we really focused
on the basics,

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:16.316 A:middle
reliable synching fast switching
between mailboxes, quick fetches

00:25:16.316 --> 00:25:18.346 A:middle
of your new mail, the basics.

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:22.666 A:middle
But in addition to that, we want
to address a fundamental problem

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:25.976 A:middle
with email, which is these
days we so often want

00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:28.196 A:middle
to send large attachments
whether it's videos

00:25:28.196 --> 00:25:31.436 A:middle
or large sets of photos and
we're underpinning one of these,

00:25:32.036 --> 00:25:34.676 A:middle
a message saying that our
recipient's mail server can't

00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:36.096 A:middle
take those large attachments.

00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:37.966 A:middle
Well, we're solving that problem

00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:40.506 A:middle
with the technology
we call Mail Drop.

00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:45.086 A:middle
With Mail Drop, instead of
your message bouncing off your

00:25:45.086 --> 00:25:47.796 A:middle
recipient's mail
server, you can elect

00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:50.176 A:middle
to have the attachment
sent encrypted

00:25:50.176 --> 00:25:52.796 A:middle
and securely via iCloud
separate from the message

00:25:53.056 --> 00:25:55.136 A:middle
and it rendezvous on
the receiving end.

00:25:55.606 --> 00:25:59.946 A:middle

they get it just like before.

client, they get a link

00:26:02.846 --> 00:26:04.926 A:middle
to securely download
those attachments.

00:26:05.136 --> 00:26:08.756 A:middle
And those attachments can
be up to 5 gigs in size.

So next. Markup.

00:26:20.526 --> 00:26:23.626 A:middle
Have you ever been working on an
email message and you realized

00:26:23.626 --> 00:26:26.106 A:middle
that if you could just
maybe circle something

00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.676 A:middle
or write something
on the message,

00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:29.606 A:middle
maybe do a little something,
you can get your point

00:26:29.606 --> 00:26:33.136 A:middle
across so much more clearly,
well, now with Markup you can.

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:36.106 A:middle
It burns right back in
to your mail message,

00:26:36.316 --> 00:26:37.896 A:middle
and it even works with PDFs.

00:26:38.536 --> 00:26:41.656 A:middle
So if you needed, for instance,
sign a PDF, you can now do

00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
that with your iSight camera

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:45.376 A:middle
or even drawing your
signature right on the trackpad

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:47.226 A:middle
and it goes right
into the email message

00:26:47.346 --> 00:26:48.846 A:middle
and you can send on its way.

00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.346 A:middle

able to pack all the power

00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:06.546 A:middle
of the Safari UI
into this single bar,

00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:10.236 A:middle
and that means you have
more space for your content.

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:12.546 A:middle
Now, of course, you may
wonder what happened

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:13.586 A:middle
on my Favorites bar.

00:27:14.386 --> 00:27:17.076 A:middle
Well, of course, you can bring
that back if you want to.

00:27:17.276 --> 00:27:19.206 A:middle
But in Yosemite you
don't really need

00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:22.126 A:middle
to because now your
Smart Search Field

00:27:22.126 --> 00:27:25.476 A:middle
when you click it shows you all
of your favorites right there.

00:27:25.946 --> 00:27:27.666 A:middle
And it's also really
great for search.

00:27:27.936 --> 00:27:29.246 A:middle
So in addition, when
you type to get

00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:30.786 A:middle
in your smart search
suggestions,

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:34.566 A:middle
you also get spotlight
suggestions right there

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:35.646 A:middle
in your completion menu.

00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
And this means, you can get
things faster than ever before.

00:27:39.706 --> 00:27:43.226 A:middle
Now, Safari is also more
powerful than ever with sharing.

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:47.516 A:middle
So now, if you want to subscribe
to an RSS feed on the site,

00:27:47.996 --> 00:27:49.496 A:middle
you can do that right here

00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:51.916 A:middle
and those RSS feed
articles will show up right

00:27:51.916 --> 00:27:54.446 A:middle
in your Safari sidebar
under Shared Links.

00:27:54.836 --> 00:27:58.206 A:middle
And you can also share to
people more quickly than ever,

00:27:58.486 --> 00:28:00.316 A:middle
because Safari lists the
people you've message


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.486 --> 00:28:00.316 A:middle
because Safari lists the
people you've message

00:28:00.316 --> 00:28:03.776 A:middle
with most recently, and with
just one click you can share

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:04.516 A:middle
a webpage.

00:28:05.536 --> 00:28:09.676 A:middle
Now, Safari is better than
ever as well with tabs.

00:28:09.996 --> 00:28:13.636 A:middle
We now have a tab view that
gives you a bird's-eye glance

00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:18.066 A:middle
of all of your tabs and it
stacks tabs from sites just

00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:20.076 A:middle
like this so you get
individual stacks

00:28:20.076 --> 00:28:22.266 A:middle
for each site that
you're browsing.

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:26.196 A:middle
Safari is also great
when it comes to privacy.

00:28:26.196 --> 00:28:29.136 A:middle
Safari was the first browser
to introduce private browsing

00:28:29.196 --> 00:28:30.896 A:middle
and now it's easier than ever,

00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:33.596 A:middle
because you can create
a new private window.

00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
And when you do, all the
content within that window

00:28:36.796 --> 00:28:39.586 A:middle
and all its tabs
stay private and all

00:28:39.586 --> 00:28:42.116 A:middle
of your other windows
are unaffected.

00:28:42.506 --> 00:28:43.396 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:47.106 A:middle
Now, Safari is great when
it comes to standards.

00:28:47.366 --> 00:28:50.836 A:middle
It has WebGL now for
superfast 3D graphics,

00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:55.956 A:middle
SPDY for efficient networking,
and HTML Premium Video.

00:28:56.456 --> 00:29:01.346 A:middle
Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:56.456 --> 00:29:01.346 A:middle
Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video

00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:03.726 A:middle
from site like Netflix
without a plug-in

00:29:03.726 --> 00:29:05.556 A:middle
and the results are awesome.

00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:08.986 A:middle
You get up to two hours
longer battery life

00:29:09.376 --> 00:29:11.376 A:middle
on a MacBook Air
streaming Netflix.

00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:13.636 A:middle
And that's for 1080P video.

00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:17.766 A:middle
Now, Safari has been
set the benchmark really

00:29:17.766 --> 00:29:19.956 A:middle
for energy efficiency
since Mavericks

00:29:20.536 --> 00:29:22.626 A:middle
and its lead here continues.

00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:25.986 A:middle
When it comes to multi-tab
browser energy efficiency,

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:27.986 A:middle
Safari is without equal.

00:29:28.276 --> 00:29:30.556 A:middle
And when it comes to the
kind of UI manipulations

00:29:30.556 --> 00:29:34.486 A:middle
that are typical in web apps,
Safari is faster than ever.

00:29:35.386 --> 00:29:36.706 A:middle
And how about JavaScript?

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:39.866 A:middle
Well, take the most complex kind
of JavaScript that's typical

00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:41.946 A:middle
of very rich web applications.

00:29:42.306 --> 00:29:47.466 A:middle
Well, Safari now has a Fourth
Tier LLVM-based optimized

00:29:47.466 --> 00:29:51.716 A:middle
JavaScript Compiler that is the
fastest of any major browser.

00:29:52.346 --> 00:29:55.866 A:middle
And when it comes to
typical website JavaScript,

00:29:57.226 --> 00:29:59.136 A:middle
Safari is in a league
of its own.

00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:00.966 A:middle
So of that is Safari.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:00.966 A:middle
So of that is Safari.

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:03.516 A:middle
And to give you a quick
demo, I'd like to bring

00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:05.176 A:middle
up Brian Crowe to the stage.

00:30:05.176 --> 00:30:05.826 A:middle
Let's give him a big welcome.

00:30:05.826 --> 00:30:05.976 A:middle
Brian.

00:30:06.516 --> 00:30:11.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:12.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Craig.

00:30:14.036 --> 00:30:15.786 A:middle
I'm really happy
to be here today.

00:30:16.276 --> 00:30:18.586 A:middle
So, I'm just going to
dive right into Safari.

00:30:19.066 --> 00:30:19.646 A:middle
Here we go.

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:22.876 A:middle
It's really great.

00:30:23.046 --> 00:30:25.496 A:middle
And when you go to a website,

00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:28.276 A:middle
you can really appreciate
the new design.

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:32.196 A:middle
It's simpler and it's
even more powerful.

00:30:32.736 --> 00:30:36.326 A:middle
I can open up the sidebar really
easily to get at my Bookmarks,

00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:39.216 A:middle
my Reading List as well
as my Shared Links.

00:30:40.136 --> 00:30:46.036 A:middle
And when I click into the Search
field, I get instant access

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:47.696 A:middle
to all my favorite sites.

00:30:48.286 --> 00:30:49.256 A:middle
It's really nice.

00:30:49.756 --> 00:30:50.966 A:middle
So, I'm going to
go ahead and type

00:30:50.966 --> 00:30:53.426 A:middle
in a search for Ansel Adams.

00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:54.086 A:middle
There we go.

00:30:54.926 --> 00:30:57.266 A:middle
And if I hit return,
I can just go

00:30:57.266 --> 00:30:58.686 A:middle
to a regular old Google search.

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:03.946 A:middle
But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:03.946 A:middle
But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term,

00:31:04.876 --> 00:31:08.246 A:middle
I get this new Spotlight
suggestion there at the top.

00:31:08.716 --> 00:31:11.136 A:middle
It has a snippet of
information from Wikipedia.

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:14.476 A:middle
I can read it there, or
if I'd like I can go ahead

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:18.016 A:middle
and see the entire article
right on the Wikipedia site.

00:31:18.786 --> 00:31:20.346 A:middle
It's super convenient.

00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:25.636 A:middle
Now, if you use tabs,
you're going to love this.

00:31:26.996 --> 00:31:29.896 A:middle
Now, no matter how many
tabs I have opened,

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:33.946 A:middle
I can smoothly scroll
through them to get at any

00:31:33.946 --> 00:31:35.126 A:middle
of that tab I'm looking for.

00:31:35.616 --> 00:31:36.616 A:middle
It's really nice.

00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:39.091 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:42.766 A:middle
So now, sometimes I want to
see my tabs so I can go ahead

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:45.646 A:middle
and do this and I'll click
on the new Tab View button.

00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:48.976 A:middle
And there you go, a
beautiful bird's eye view

00:31:49.066 --> 00:31:50.096 A:middle
of all my open tabs.

00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:53.026 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this one here.

00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:57.066 A:middle
It's a photoblog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite

00:31:57.066 --> 00:32:00.726 A:middle
and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.066 --> 00:32:00.726 A:middle
and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below.

00:32:00.726 --> 00:32:02.816 A:middle
So, I'll find in
there El Capitan.

00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:04.936 A:middle
And then I'm going
to choose this one.

00:32:04.936 --> 00:32:06.476 A:middle
Now, I want to share it
with Craig so I'm going

00:32:06.476 --> 00:32:07.636 A:middle
to get the high-res image.

00:32:08.036 --> 00:32:10.596 A:middle
Now, sharing couldn't
be easier in Safari.

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.586 A:middle
I just simply click on
the Share button here,

00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:16.776 A:middle
and now I can use the new
recent recipients feature

00:32:16.776 --> 00:32:18.676 A:middle
to address it to Craig.

00:32:18.766 --> 00:32:19.676 A:middle
And here we go.

00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:24.336 A:middle
And with just one click, I'm
ready to send that image.

00:32:24.736 --> 00:32:25.486 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:28.976 A:middle
So-- But before I send it,

00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:30.736 A:middle
I'm going to add my
two cents to this.

00:32:31.486 --> 00:32:33.496 A:middle
So, I can go here and we
have just the right feature

00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:34.876 A:middle
called Markup.

00:32:35.576 --> 00:32:38.536 A:middle
Now with Markup, I
can edit this image

00:32:38.536 --> 00:32:40.256 A:middle
without ever even leaving Mail.

00:32:40.916 --> 00:32:41.926 A:middle
It's really great.

00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:45.336 A:middle
So, what I'm going to do
is annotate this image

00:32:45.336 --> 00:32:48.346 A:middle
with a nice magnifying
glass a loop.

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:50.546 A:middle
So, you move it around
you can say

00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:52.246 A:middle
that it magnifies
everything underneath it.

00:32:52.246 --> 00:32:54.026 A:middle
So, I'm going to
place it right here.

00:32:54.516 --> 00:32:57.266 A:middle
And it turns out
that those two specs

00:32:57.666 --> 00:33:00.876 A:middle
on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.666 --> 00:33:00.876 A:middle
on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers.

00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:01.936 A:middle
It's kind of crazy.

00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:03.456 A:middle
So, I'm going to
zoom it a little more

00:33:03.456 --> 00:33:04.556 A:middle
so you can see it better.

00:33:04.766 --> 00:33:05.416 A:middle
There we go.

00:33:06.356 --> 00:33:08.116 A:middle
So, I can zoom nicely
and place it here.

00:33:09.186 --> 00:33:11.616 A:middle
Now, I want to point this
out to Craig in the mail.

00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:16.306 A:middle
And I can use my trackpad
to draw on the image.

00:33:16.566 --> 00:33:18.406 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here.

00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:19.786 A:middle
There we go.

00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:24.646 A:middle
And you notice Markup's smart
enough to recognize the arrow

00:33:25.076 --> 00:33:26.246 A:middle
and make it really pretty.

00:33:27.556 --> 00:33:32.566 A:middle
So now-- now, it's really
easy to add a comment.

00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:36.026 A:middle
And so, check out the climbers.

00:33:36.586 --> 00:33:37.986 A:middle
There we go.

00:33:37.986 --> 00:33:41.346 A:middle
Now, I can have a little
fun with this, so I'm going

00:33:41.496 --> 00:33:45.006 A:middle
to go ahead and create
a cartoon bubble, OK?

00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:48.866 A:middle
I'm not so good at drawing
but Markup's going to help me.

00:33:48.866 --> 00:33:49.496 A:middle
There we go.

00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:52.096 A:middle
So, luckily you can
clean that up [phonetic],

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:52.926 A:middle
it's better than I am.

00:33:53.526 --> 00:33:55.196 A:middle
So now I can add a caption.

00:33:56.086 --> 00:33:57.826 A:middle
And so, I think I'm
going to appeal

00:33:57.826 --> 00:33:59.706 A:middle
to the inner developer
and all of us.

00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:05.106 A:middle
I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is,"

I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is,"

00:34:05.976 --> 00:34:08.376 A:middle
wait for it, "multithreaded."

00:34:11.606 --> 00:34:11.906 A:middle
Yeah.

00:34:12.516 --> 00:34:15.216 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:34:15.716 --> 00:34:18.056 A:middle
OK. So, I think I've done
enough to this picture.

00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:20.436 A:middle
Time to go.

00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:23.326 A:middle
So, now it's ready
for me to mail

00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:25.275 A:middle
and I can just click like that.

00:34:25.275 --> 00:34:29.076 A:middle
So that's how easy it is
to Markup an image in Mail.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:31.275 A:middle
So, those are just a couple

00:34:31.275 --> 00:34:33.936 A:middle
of great new features
in Safari in Mail.

00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:34.866 A:middle
Thank you.

00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:43.255 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:45.525 A:middle
&gt;&gt; How about that
parallel programming joke.

00:34:45.525 --> 00:34:46.646 A:middle
You did not see that coming.

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:52.396 A:middle
Next, something entirely
different.

00:34:52.616 --> 00:34:54.176 A:middle
It's called the Continuity.

00:34:54.696 --> 00:34:56.946 A:middle
So now at Apple, we
believe you should be able

00:34:56.946 --> 00:34:59.446 A:middle

device for the moment.

00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.216 A:middle
to kick back on the

00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:08.096 A:middle
when you're trying to
get some work done.

00:35:08.096 --> 00:35:11.766 A:middle
But we also want the transitions
between these moments

00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:15.916 A:middle
to be absolutely as natural
and seamless as possible.

00:35:16.836 --> 00:35:19.486 A:middle
Now, our Continuity features
start with something simple

00:35:20.146 --> 00:35:22.856 A:middle
and that's AirDrop,
because now AirDrop works

00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:23.926 A:middle
between iOS and the Mac.

00:35:24.516 --> 00:35:32.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:32.606 --> 00:35:34.426 A:middle
It's really convenient.

00:35:35.156 --> 00:35:36.886 A:middle
But now we have something
that we really take it

00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:39.426 A:middle
to the next level and
that's called Handoff.

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:45.306 A:middle
So, it turns out now that when
you're working on your Mac,

00:35:45.966 --> 00:35:50.266 A:middle
your devices around you
in proximity are aware

00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:53.166 A:middle
of each other and aware
of what you're up to.

00:35:53.656 --> 00:35:56.426 A:middle
And so, if you want to pick up
where you left off on your Mac

00:35:56.546 --> 00:35:59.766 A:middle
and your iPad, your iPad
is prompting you right

00:35:59.766 --> 00:36:01.296 A:middle
in the lower left of the screen.

in the lower left of the screen.

00:36:01.566 --> 00:36:04.656 A:middle
Just swipe up and you
can pick up working

00:36:04.656 --> 00:36:06.946 A:middle
on what you're working on
your Mac right on your iPad.

00:36:07.286 --> 00:36:08.486 A:middle

00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:16.096 A:middle
This works in the other
direction as well.

00:36:16.096 --> 00:36:20.066 A:middle
So, let's say, you're
composing an email on your phone

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:21.926 A:middle
and you walk up to your Mac.

00:36:22.636 --> 00:36:24.576 A:middle
Well, your Mac will
notice what you're doing

00:36:24.766 --> 00:36:26.366 A:middle
and prompt you right
on the dock.

00:36:26.966 --> 00:36:29.336 A:middle
You click it and you
can pick up finishing

00:36:29.336 --> 00:36:30.846 A:middle
that message right on your Mac.

[ Applause ]

00:36:38.246 --> 00:36:41.426 A:middle
Now, we've been able to take
this same proximity awareness

00:36:42.376 --> 00:36:45.306 A:middle
and make the process of
creating a hotspot easier

00:36:45.306 --> 00:36:46.196 A:middle
than ever before.

00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:49.556 A:middle
So now, if you're using your Mac
and you're away from a network

00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:52.836 A:middle
but your phone is nearby, when
you go up to your Wi-Fi menu,

00:36:53.406 --> 00:36:56.226 A:middle
your Mac, actually without any
configuration ever have been

00:36:56.226 --> 00:36:59.986 A:middle
done on your phone, sees
your phone and prompts you

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.836 A:middle
so you click it and it
automatically sets up a hotspot.

so you click it and it
automatically sets up a hotspot.

00:37:02.836 --> 00:37:04.236 A:middle
You never type a
password and you're

00:37:04.236 --> 00:37:05.516 A:middle
on the network that easily.

[ Applause ]

00:37:11.656 --> 00:37:13.466 A:middle
And this works even
if your phone is

00:37:13.466 --> 00:37:15.316 A:middle
across the room sitting
in a handbag.

00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:16.656 A:middle
You just never have to touch it.

00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:20.796 A:middle
Now, the next that we really
wanted to handle is SMS.

00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:25.126 A:middle
Now, we all love iMessage.

00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:27.136 A:middle
We can continue our
conversations seamlessly

00:37:27.136 --> 00:37:30.296 A:middle
from device to device but
then we have these green

00:37:30.296 --> 00:37:31.166 A:middle
bubble friends.

00:37:31.976 --> 00:37:37.956 A:middle
And, you know, they have
inferior devices and they insist

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:39.596 A:middle
on sending us messages,
and we don't want

00:37:39.596 --> 00:37:40.406 A:middle
to hold it against them.

00:37:40.406 --> 00:37:43.586 A:middle
But the problem is that
those messages don't show

00:37:43.586 --> 00:37:48.966 A:middle
up on our other devices
until now, because now--

Now, believe it or not,

00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:04.826 A:middle
we're able to do the same
thing with phone calls.

00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:09.346 A:middle
So now, when you
receive a phone call,

00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:14.316 A:middle
your Mac gives you caller ID
and you can even accept the call

00:38:14.316 --> 00:38:15.986 A:middle
and use your Mac
as a speaker phone.

00:38:17.516 --> 00:38:26.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:30.306 A:middle
And believe it or not, this
works even if your phone is

00:38:30.306 --> 00:38:32.236 A:middle
across the house in a charger.

00:38:32.846 --> 00:38:34.696 A:middle
You never have to miss a call.

00:38:35.586 --> 00:38:39.256 A:middle
Well, now that your
Mac is all phone savvy,

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:41.006 A:middle
it's also a great way
to dial the phone.

00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:43.746 A:middle
So, if you're in Contacts and
you want to dial a number,

00:38:44.176 --> 00:38:45.386 A:middle
you can do it right there.

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:49.516 A:middle
And even on a webpage, you
see a number you want to call,

00:38:49.516 --> 00:38:50.986 A:middle
you can call it right
from your Mac.

00:38:51.156 --> 00:38:52.826 A:middle

I'm going to pick
up my iPhone here.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:19.226 A:middle
And I was composing an email
about our karaoke night.

00:39:19.766 --> 00:39:23.736 A:middle
Does anyone want to--
you know, I'm by my Mac,

00:39:23.916 --> 00:39:25.086 A:middle
so let's use my Mac here.

00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:27.946 A:middle
And you notice my
Mac actually is aware

00:39:28.056 --> 00:39:29.166 A:middle
that I was using my phone.

00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:32.406 A:middle
So with a click, I
bring up that message

00:39:32.406 --> 00:39:33.626 A:middle
to right where I left of.

00:39:33.626 --> 00:39:35.596 A:middle
Does anyone want to
go-- and you know,

00:39:35.596 --> 00:39:37.216 A:middle
to give these people
some inspiration

00:39:37.216 --> 00:39:39.596 A:middle
about what they might be able
to experience at karaoke night,

00:39:40.496 --> 00:39:43.436 A:middle
you just summon a picture from
last year's karaoke event.

one on its way.

in the other direction.

00:43:04.846 --> 00:43:08.826 A:middle
and customizable widgets,
spotlight with fast search

00:43:08.826 --> 00:43:11.366 A:middle
and access to all kinds of
great sources of information

00:43:11.366 --> 00:43:14.626 A:middle
on the internet, a
new iCloud Drive,

mail with great new features.

00:43:17.046 --> 00:43:20.406 A:middle
Safari, faster and
more elegant than ever.

00:43:20.406 --> 00:43:22.896 A:middle
And of course, continuity.

00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:26.606 A:middle
It's a wonderful new
release, Yosemite.

00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:29.976 A:middle
And it's available to you
developers here today.

00:43:30.516 --> 00:43:38.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:43.796 A:middle
Now, everyone else will get
it in the fall and believe it

00:43:43.796 --> 00:43:45.816 A:middle
or not, it will be free.

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:50.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:54.316 A:middle
Now, we're doing something
a little unusual this summer

00:43:54.316 --> 00:43:58.036 A:middle
as well which is we're
having a public beta program.

00:43:58.696 --> 00:44:01.976 A:middle

and you want

00:43:58.696 --> 00:44:01.976 A:middle
So, if you're a non-developer
and you want

00:44:01.976 --> 00:44:05.516 A:middle
to help us improve Yosemite,
you can sign up on the web

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.306 A:middle
and you can receive access

00:44:08.586 --> 00:44:10.756 A:middle
to Yosemite betas
throughout the summer.

00:44:11.286 --> 00:44:13.386 A:middle
That is OS X Yosemite.

00:44:14.326 --> 00:44:15.116 A:middle
I think you're going to love it.

00:44:15.116 --> 00:44:15.776 A:middle
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

00:44:15.776 --> 00:44:15.956 A:middle
Thank you.

00:44:16.046 --> 00:44:18.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:18.076 --> 00:44:18.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank, Craig.

[ Applause ]

00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:27.066 A:middle
It's a really terrific release.

00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:28.976 A:middle
I'm just glad I'm
in the beta program.

00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:31.151 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:44:31.286 --> 00:44:32.846 A:middle
Next up is iOS.

[ Applause ]

00:44:36.986 --> 00:44:44.146 A:middle
We've now sold well over 800
million iOS devices and each

00:44:44.146 --> 00:44:47.936 A:middle
of the categories of devices has
set its own significant sales

00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:49.206 A:middle
record in the past year.

00:44:50.036 --> 00:44:53.776 A:middle
iPod Touch has passed
100 million units.

00:44:54.686 --> 00:44:57.666 A:middle
iPad has passed 200
million units.

00:44:58.716 --> 00:45:02.316 A:middle
And iPhone has passed
half a billion units.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.716 --> 00:45:02.316 A:middle
And iPhone has passed
half a billion units.

00:45:03.606 --> 00:45:04.816 A:middle
This is incredible.

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:10.556 A:middle
But what's even more impressive
is how many new customers

00:45:10.556 --> 00:45:14.186 A:middle
to Apple that iOS
devices has brought to us.

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:22.026 A:middle
Over 130 million customers
who bought an iOS device

00:45:22.076 --> 00:45:27.866 A:middle
in the past 12 months was
buying their first Apple device.

[ Applause ]

00:45:34.616 --> 00:45:40.296 A:middle
Now, many of these customers
were switchers from Android.

00:45:42.556 --> 00:45:47.976 A:middle
They had bought an
Android phone by mistake.

00:45:48.111 --> 00:45:50.111 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:55.586 A:middle
And then had sought a better
experience and a better life.

00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:58.221 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:45:58.426 --> 00:46:03.636 A:middle
And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.426 --> 00:46:03.636 A:middle
And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS.

00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:09.626 A:middle
Nearly, in fact, nearly half
of our customers in China

00:46:09.626 --> 00:46:14.386 A:middle
in the past six months
switched from Android to iPhone.

00:46:15.836 --> 00:46:17.946 A:middle
This is incredible and of course

00:46:17.946 --> 00:46:21.366 A:middle
that better experience
is our devices in iOS.

00:46:22.786 --> 00:46:26.636 A:middle
And iOS 7 took that
experience to even higher level.

00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:32.606 A:middle
The customer sat with iOS
7 is really off the charts.

00:46:33.406 --> 00:46:37.216 A:middle
Change wave recently
measured it at 97 percent.

00:46:38.656 --> 00:46:42.036 A:middle
These are customer sat
ratings that no one gets.

00:46:43.276 --> 00:46:44.956 A:middle
It's really enormous.

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:53.806 A:middle
Now, one of the reasons why
customers say they love iOS is

00:46:53.806 --> 00:46:57.946 A:middle
that we make available
our software updates

00:46:58.036 --> 00:47:02.346 A:middle
for the OS available to as
many customers as possible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.036 --> 00:47:02.346 A:middle
for the OS available to as
many customers as possible.

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:07.416 A:middle
And, if you look at what
has happened with iOS 7,

00:47:07.416 --> 00:47:11.856 A:middle
our latest release,
almost 9 out of 10 people

00:47:11.856 --> 00:47:15.976 A:middle
in our install base are running
our latest operating system.

00:47:16.516 --> 00:47:22.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:47:22.936 --> 00:47:25.976 A:middle
Now, this is in stark
contrast to Android.

00:47:26.436 --> 00:47:28.436 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:47:28.856 --> 00:47:33.406 A:middle
If you look at their latest
release, less than one out of 10

00:47:33.406 --> 00:47:37.036 A:middle
of their customers are
on their latest software.

00:47:37.636 --> 00:47:43.706 A:middle
And, if you look at a
broader group, over a third

00:47:43.706 --> 00:47:47.006 A:middle
of their customers
are running a version

00:47:47.006 --> 00:47:51.196 A:middle
of Android from four years ago.

00:47:52.276 --> 00:47:53.946 A:middle
That's like ancient history.

00:47:54.516 --> 00:47:57.126 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:02.626 A:middle
Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:02.626 A:middle
Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great

00:48:02.626 --> 00:48:03.496 A:middle
new features.

00:48:04.456 --> 00:48:06.756 A:middle
They're not able to
run your latest apps.

00:48:08.116 --> 00:48:10.886 A:middle
And, they don't get
security updates

00:48:11.616 --> 00:48:13.666 A:middle
that they may need to stay safe.

00:48:15.146 --> 00:48:17.966 A:middle
And, this is particularly
important for Android

00:48:18.536 --> 00:48:20.976 A:middle
which dominates the
mobile malware market.

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:24.136 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:48:24.636 --> 00:48:28.206 A:middle
No wonder experts are
saying things like this.

00:48:29.436 --> 00:48:31.936 A:middle
Android fragmentation
is turning devices

00:48:31.936 --> 00:48:35.726 A:middle
into a toxic hell stew
of vulnerabilities.

00:48:37.196 --> 00:48:44.206 A:middle
Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't
had this kind of issues

00:48:44.626 --> 00:48:49.136 A:middle
because we do everything we can
to make our updates available

00:48:49.136 --> 00:48:51.376 A:middle
to as many people as possible.

00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:57.846 A:middle
So, we could not be
happier with iOS 7

00:48:58.446 --> 00:49:00.726 A:middle
and the momentum of iOS devices.

and the momentum of iOS devices.

00:49:00.726 --> 00:49:04.146 A:middle
But, we are not standing still.

00:49:05.146 --> 00:49:07.976 A:middle
Today, we're announcing iOS 8.

00:49:08.516 --> 00:49:15.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:49:16.056 --> 00:49:19.586 A:middle
And, iOS 8 is a giant release

00:49:19.936 --> 00:49:22.536 A:middle
and it's really two
stories not one.

00:49:23.266 --> 00:49:26.196 A:middle
It has great end user features.

00:49:27.536 --> 00:49:32.006 A:middle
But, it also has
incredible developer features

00:49:32.376 --> 00:49:36.856 A:middle
so you can extend your
experience and build apps

00:49:36.896 --> 00:49:38.586 A:middle
that you couldn't do before.

00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:43.336 A:middle
We'd like to get started with
describing it with talking

00:49:43.336 --> 00:49:45.096 A:middle
about the end user features.

00:49:45.456 --> 00:49:48.256 A:middle
And, to do that, I'd
like to bring Craig back

00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:48.636 A:middle
up to the stage.

00:49:48.636 --> 00:49:48.976 A:middle
Craig?

00:49:57.046 --> 00:49:57.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I missed you guys.

00:49:58.706 --> 00:50:02.736 A:middle
So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.706 --> 00:50:02.736 A:middle
So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8.

00:50:03.296 --> 00:50:07.316 A:middle
Now, iOS 8 of course builds
on the design of iOS 7

00:50:08.536 --> 00:50:11.686 A:middle
with enhancements for
both iPhone and iPad.

00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.316 A:middle
And, let's start with the phone.

00:50:14.336 --> 00:50:17.766 A:middle
Now, in iOS 8, we've
refined notification center.

00:50:18.706 --> 00:50:23.626 A:middle
But, what I really love are our
new interactive notifications.

00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:27.856 A:middle
So now, if you get a message
like this, just pull down

00:50:28.506 --> 00:50:30.896 A:middle
and you can reply from
right where you are.

00:50:31.036 --> 00:50:33.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:50:33.056 --> 00:50:34.706 A:middle
You don't have to leave
the app you're in.

00:50:34.706 --> 00:50:37.546 A:middle
And this works for all
kinds of notifications.

00:50:37.546 --> 00:50:40.316 A:middle
If you get a calendar event
for instance, just pull down

00:50:40.316 --> 00:50:43.546 A:middle
and respond and it works
on the lock screen.

00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.276 A:middle
So, you can just swipe
across in the lock screen.

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.706 A:middle
You get those action
buttons tapped

00:50:48.166 --> 00:50:49.826 A:middle
and you've dealt
with it right there.

00:50:50.836 --> 00:50:54.966 A:middle
Now, in iOS 7, we gave you
quick double-tap access to get

00:50:54.966 --> 00:50:56.186 A:middle
at your most recent apps.

00:50:56.936 --> 00:51:00.386 A:middle
Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:56.936 --> 00:51:00.386 A:middle
Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get

00:51:00.386 --> 00:51:03.396 A:middle
at the people you communicate
with most frequently.

00:51:03.996 --> 00:51:04.996 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:51:05.676 --> 00:51:09.746 A:middle
And, in iOS 7, we introduce
this great Tab View in Safari.

00:51:10.636 --> 00:51:13.916 A:middle
Well, we're bringing a great
Tab View to iPad as well

00:51:13.916 --> 00:51:16.626 A:middle
with this bird's eye
view of all of your tabs.

00:51:17.106 --> 00:51:21.156 A:middle
And, Safari also picks up
the Side Bar that we love

00:51:21.156 --> 00:51:24.726 A:middle
in Yosemite with access to your
bookmarks, your reading list

00:51:24.926 --> 00:51:25.846 A:middle
and your shared links.

00:51:26.676 --> 00:51:30.066 A:middle
Now, we've made managing your
mail easier than ever before.

00:51:30.406 --> 00:51:32.566 A:middle
So now, if you're reading a
message, you want to remember

00:51:32.566 --> 00:51:34.266 A:middle
to get back to it so you're
going to mark it on red.

00:51:34.606 --> 00:51:36.456 A:middle
We can do that with
just a single gesture.

00:51:37.356 --> 00:51:39.256 A:middle
And, if you want
to flag a message,

00:51:39.576 --> 00:51:41.306 A:middle
you can just pull across,
there's a flag option.

00:51:41.306 --> 00:51:42.576 A:middle
But, if you pull
all the way across,

00:51:43.006 --> 00:51:44.866 A:middle
you can delete with
just a gesture.

00:51:45.656 --> 00:51:48.396 A:middle
But the piece I love the
best is what we've done

00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:49.696 A:middle
with composing messages.

00:51:49.966 --> 00:51:52.306 A:middle
Have you ever found
yourself composing an email

00:51:52.416 --> 00:51:55.006 A:middle
and then you really wish like
you get at something else

00:51:55.006 --> 00:51:56.726 A:middle
in your inbox maybe
for that reply?

00:51:57.686 --> 00:51:58.526 A:middle
Well now, you can.

00:51:58.626 --> 00:52:01.946 A:middle
Just swipe that message
down and you have access

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.626 --> 00:52:01.946 A:middle
Just swipe that message
down and you have access

00:52:01.946 --> 00:52:02.886 A:middle
to the rest of your mail.

00:52:03.516 --> 00:52:09.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:11.116 A:middle
So, I'd like to give
you a demo of some

00:52:11.116 --> 00:52:15.476 A:middle
of these great iOS
8 enhancements now.

00:52:16.976 --> 00:52:21.666 A:middle
So, here we are on
our iOS 8 lock screen.

00:52:22.546 --> 00:52:24.426 A:middle
And, if I receive
a notification,

00:52:24.426 --> 00:52:26.526 A:middle
it looks like I happen to
get one just right then,

00:52:26.806 --> 00:52:30.756 A:middle
I can swipe across and you see
I have action so I can accept

00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:32.046 A:middle
or decline this meeting
right here.

00:52:32.046 --> 00:52:35.466 A:middle
And, of course, I'm
going to use the device,

00:52:35.466 --> 00:52:39.416 A:middle
if I'm in here maybe playing
some music here on iTunes radio,

00:52:39.826 --> 00:52:42.476 A:middle
I might get a notification.

00:52:43.116 --> 00:52:47.356 A:middle
And, if I do get notification, I
can just swipe down on it, too.

00:52:47.356 --> 00:52:49.046 A:middle
So, here's one, just swipe down.

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.256 A:middle
Now, I get access
to my keyboard.

00:52:51.836 --> 00:52:53.736 A:middle
I can type right there.

00:52:54.396 --> 00:52:56.606 A:middle
Now, this works great for
third party apps as well.

00:52:57.166 --> 00:52:59.876 A:middle
So, for instance, looks like
I got tagged on Facebook,

00:53:00.446 --> 00:53:03.906 A:middle
I can like it right here with
an actionable notification.

00:53:04.416 --> 00:53:06.066 A:middle
And, sometimes, you
receive notifications

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:07.876 A:middle
that you just really don't
want deal with right now

00:53:07.876 --> 00:53:10.796 A:middle
and you can just flick
those away like that.

00:53:11.256 --> 00:53:11.986 A:middle
That's really handy.

00:53:12.626 --> 00:53:15.776 A:middle
Now, we've made getting at
people easier than ever before.

00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:17.366 A:middle
So, if I just double-tap
my Home button,

00:53:17.366 --> 00:53:20.776 A:middle
so I have all the people I most
recently communicated with.

00:53:20.776 --> 00:53:23.866 A:middle
I swipe to the side and I have
access to all my favorites.

00:53:24.456 --> 00:53:27.746 A:middle
If I tap on one, I have controls
here to give them a phone call,

00:53:28.476 --> 00:53:32.246 A:middle
iMessage them or even
FaceTime right here

00:53:32.246 --> 00:53:35.096 A:middle
with just a double-tap
on the Home button.

00:53:35.386 --> 00:53:36.236 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:53:37.036 --> 00:53:38.086 A:middle
Now, I want to show you some

00:53:38.086 --> 00:53:39.826 A:middle
of the enhancements
we made to mail.

00:53:40.586 --> 00:53:42.776 A:middle
Let's go take a look an
iPad actually this time.

00:53:44.336 --> 00:53:45.226 A:middle
So, here we are on iPad.

00:53:45.226 --> 00:53:46.976 A:middle
I'm going to launch mail.

00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:50.446 A:middle
Now, I have a number
of unread messages here

00:53:50.446 --> 00:53:51.826 A:middle
so let's work our
way through them.

00:53:52.156 --> 00:53:56.516 A:middle
Here's a message from Open
Table with a dinner appointment.

00:53:56.516 --> 00:54:01.196 A:middle
And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called

00:53:56.516 --> 00:54:01.196 A:middle
And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called

00:54:01.196 --> 00:54:02.176 A:middle
out right here on the top.

00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:05.026 A:middle
Mail has actually given me an
intelligent suggestion here

00:54:05.066 --> 00:54:06.096 A:middle
to add it to my calendar.

00:54:06.096 --> 00:54:08.806 A:middle
I can tap Add and just
like this, it lets--

00:54:08.806 --> 00:54:12.246 A:middle
it prompts me to fill out and
add an event to my calendar.

00:54:12.456 --> 00:54:13.266 A:middle
That's really handy.

00:54:14.116 --> 00:54:15.876 A:middle
Now, sometimes, you
get a message like this

00:54:16.346 --> 00:54:18.156 A:middle
where you're going to have
to do some thinking about it.

00:54:18.156 --> 00:54:19.246 A:middle
Maybe get back to it later.

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:23.226 A:middle
Well now, with just a single
swipe, I can mark it as unread.

00:54:23.846 --> 00:54:24.596 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:27.176 A:middle
You can also flag really easily.

00:54:27.176 --> 00:54:29.276 A:middle
So, this is a message
I want to flag.

00:54:29.276 --> 00:54:31.806 A:middle
Just flick it across and flag.

00:54:32.606 --> 00:54:33.686 A:middle
Now, here's a nice message.

00:54:33.926 --> 00:54:36.806 A:middle
I don't know who this fellow is
but he says great collaboration.

00:54:37.216 --> 00:54:39.946 A:middle
You and Johnny have really
come together really well.

00:54:40.246 --> 00:54:41.226 A:middle
Let's take a look at that one.

00:54:42.356 --> 00:54:42.976 A:middle
Oh, dear God.

[ Laughter ]

00:54:44.306 --> 00:54:45.466 A:middle
Well, this would be a good time

00:54:45.466 --> 00:54:47.196 A:middle
to demonstrate our
quick delete feature.

00:54:47.846 --> 00:54:50.366 A:middle
So, I can drag all the way
across and delete at a glance.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.716 A:middle
I'm certain that
message won't haunt me

00:54:52.716 --> 00:54:54.076 A:middle
on the internet for
years to come.

00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:56.786 A:middle
So, let's talk about composing.

00:54:56.786 --> 00:55:00.286 A:middle
I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:56.786 --> 00:55:00.286 A:middle
I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town,

00:55:00.286 --> 00:55:01.386 A:middle
who's looking for
a good restaurant.

00:55:01.386 --> 00:55:02.856 A:middle
So, I'll start replying
to this message.

00:55:03.856 --> 00:55:08.226 A:middle
And, I'll say, let's see--
check out and then, you know,

00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:09.936 A:middle
actually I got a
good recommendation

00:55:09.936 --> 00:55:11.336 A:middle
from another friend
here in my inbox,

00:55:11.336 --> 00:55:12.426 A:middle
so I'd like to get to that now.

00:55:12.656 --> 00:55:15.546 A:middle
Well, I can just swipe
this draft down like this.

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.956 A:middle
Go right into another
place, another message

00:55:18.956 --> 00:55:22.366 A:middle
in my inbox, tap
out a selection.

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.756 A:middle
That looks like exactly
what I want to send him

00:55:24.756 --> 00:55:25.806 A:middle
so I'll just copy that.

00:55:25.806 --> 00:55:27.396 A:middle
And now, with a tap
at the bottom,

00:55:27.396 --> 00:55:30.106 A:middle
I restore my draft
just like that.

00:55:30.656 --> 00:55:33.446 A:middle
I can paste and send
it on its way.

00:55:33.446 --> 00:55:36.026 A:middle
I think we're all going to
love doing mail this way.

00:55:36.316 --> 00:55:38.696 A:middle
That's a quick look, few
enhancements to iOS 8.

[ Applause ]

00:55:44.176 --> 00:55:45.716 A:middle
So, let's talk about Spotlight.

00:55:46.406 --> 00:55:48.756 A:middle
And of course, Spotlight
is a super convenient way

00:55:48.756 --> 00:55:49.626 A:middle
to search in your device.

00:55:49.626 --> 00:55:51.566 A:middle
You just pull down one
on your home screen

00:55:51.886 --> 00:55:53.256 A:middle
and you can execute
these searches,

00:55:53.306 --> 00:55:56.586 A:middle
find things like launching
apps or find an email message.

00:55:57.046 --> 00:56:00.176 A:middle
But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:57.046 --> 00:56:00.176 A:middle
But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite,

00:56:00.176 --> 00:56:03.386 A:middle
with Spotlight Suggestions,
you can get it so much more.

00:56:03.926 --> 00:56:06.736 A:middle
You can search for apps and find
matches of apps that you don't

00:56:06.736 --> 00:56:08.066 A:middle
yet have on the App Store.

00:56:09.016 --> 00:56:10.606 A:middle
You can search for
points of interest

00:56:11.006 --> 00:56:13.296 A:middle
and get Wikipedia
entries and directions.

00:56:13.806 --> 00:56:18.916 A:middle
You can search for news,
search for restaurants, songs,

00:56:19.156 --> 00:56:21.716 A:middle
not just in your own
library but also on iTunes.

00:56:21.926 --> 00:56:25.146 A:middle
And, when you search for a
movie, you can get results both

00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:30.286 A:middle
for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming.

00:56:30.826 --> 00:56:34.926 A:middle
And, when you search
inside of Safari in addition

00:56:34.926 --> 00:56:36.606 A:middle
to your great Google
Search suggestions,

00:56:37.256 --> 00:56:39.626 A:middle
you can also get a
suggestion at a glance

00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:41.496 A:middle
for the answer you're
looking for right

00:56:41.696 --> 00:56:43.136 A:middle
from Spotlight Suggestions.

00:56:43.706 --> 00:56:45.476 A:middle
So, that is the new Spotlight.

00:56:46.146 --> 00:56:50.606 A:middle
Next, the keyboard and the
technology we call QuickType.

00:56:52.146 --> 00:56:52.506 A:middle
Oh.

00:56:53.016 --> 00:56:54.776 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:56:54.776 --> 00:56:58.706 A:middle
So, prior to iPhone, this
was the state-of-the-art

00:56:59.126 --> 00:57:00.326 A:middle
in smartphone typing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:59.126 --> 00:57:00.326 A:middle
in smartphone typing.

00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:04.156 A:middle
But, iPhone changed all of that
with the introduction of Touch.

00:57:04.156 --> 00:57:07.456 A:middle
And, we've been able to do
so much more like access

00:57:07.556 --> 00:57:10.966 A:middle
to special characters or
alternate character sets,

00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:15.756 A:middle
special keyboard layouts, even
handwriting and dictation.

00:57:16.426 --> 00:57:20.376 A:middle
But, underlying it all have
been the language models

00:57:20.696 --> 00:57:22.226 A:middle
under autocorrect.

00:57:22.956 --> 00:57:28.166 A:middle
Well now, in iOS 8,
QuickType supports predictive

00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:29.496 A:middle
typing suggestions.

00:57:29.686 --> 00:57:32.576 A:middle
So, as you type,
you get suggestions

00:57:32.576 --> 00:57:34.606 A:middle
for the next words you
might want to type,

00:57:34.606 --> 00:57:37.976 A:middle
and you can tap things out
faster than ever before

00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:39.566 A:middle
and it's incredibly smart.

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:42.386 A:middle
So, it's context sensitive.

00:57:42.386 --> 00:57:44.286 A:middle
For instance in messages,
if someone asks you,

00:57:44.286 --> 00:57:45.576 A:middle
do you want to go for
dinner or a movie?

00:57:45.576 --> 00:57:47.976 A:middle
It's going to suggest
dinner or a movie.

00:57:56.946 --> 00:57:58.146 A:middle
And, it's personalized.

00:57:58.146 --> 00:57:59.316 A:middle
It learns how you type

00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.776 A:middle
to different people
in different apps.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

to different people
in different apps.

00:58:01.836 --> 00:58:04.416 A:middle
So, maybe you're communicating
with a co-worker and it's going

00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:07.466 A:middle
to say, well, the meeting was
canceled, rescheduled, moved.

00:58:07.466 --> 00:58:09.456 A:middle
These are kind of formal terms.

00:58:09.876 --> 00:58:11.236 A:middle
But now, if you're
communicating with someone else,

00:58:11.236 --> 00:58:13.006 A:middle
we have a different
communication style,

00:58:13.906 --> 00:58:17.376 A:middle
you might get the meeting was
epic, awesome or a snoozer

00:58:17.546 --> 00:58:19.086 A:middle
because it learns how you type.

00:58:20.576 --> 00:58:22.246 A:middle
And, when it does, it does

00:58:22.246 --> 00:58:25.216 A:middle
so in a way that's always
protecting your privacy.

00:58:25.696 --> 00:58:28.316 A:middle
All that learning is done
local to the device and none

00:58:28.316 --> 00:58:30.556 A:middle
of your keystrokes
leave the device.

00:58:31.126 --> 00:58:33.666 A:middle
Now, QuickType has
great language models

00:58:33.666 --> 00:58:34.966 A:middle
for all of these languages.

be typing a whole lot faster.

00:58:44.476 --> 00:58:46.776 A:middle
Next of course, continuity.

00:58:46.776 --> 00:58:48.856 A:middle
You get all the great
continuity features.

00:58:48.856 --> 00:58:50.936 A:middle

you can pick

up where you left
off on your iPhone.

00:58:54.316 --> 00:58:56.316 A:middle
You can set up an
instant hotspot

and when you receive a call
from someone going like this,

you can pick it up

that's continuity.

So, Messages is the most
frequently used app on iOS.

00:59:18.646 --> 00:59:20.776 A:middle
And, in iOS 8, it's
better than ever.

00:59:21.786 --> 00:59:23.396 A:middle
So, when it comes
to group messaging,

00:59:23.616 --> 00:59:25.356 A:middle
we have some great enhancements.

00:59:25.606 --> 00:59:26.896 A:middle
You can now name your threads.

00:59:27.166 --> 00:59:28.976 A:middle

that just keeps buzzing
in your pocket, well,

00:59:38.056 --> 00:59:41.616 A:middle
you can do not disturb on a per
thread level and you can choose

00:59:41.616 --> 00:59:42.776 A:middle
when to leave the tread.

00:59:42.776 --> 00:59:43.976 A:middle

their location with you,

of the pictures and attachments

But one feature that I really
love is our new Tap to Talk.

You just hold your finger
down on the microphone button

01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:17.666 A:middle
and then you can just
swipe up with your finger

01:00:17.666 --> 01:00:19.836 A:middle
when you're done talking
and send what you said.

01:00:20.406 --> 01:00:24.286 A:middle

video messaging as well.

01:00:37.206 --> 01:00:38.796 A:middle
It's fun to be up here
to be the first one

01:00:38.796 --> 01:00:41.696 A:middle
to show you what a rich
and powerful platform

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:44.026 A:middle
for communication
messages has become.

01:00:44.026 --> 01:00:45.246 A:middle
So let's get right into it.

01:00:45.436 --> 01:00:47.386 A:middle
So I got a message here
waiting from my friend

01:00:47.386 --> 01:00:49.026 A:middle
and co-worker, Kim Vorrath.

01:00:49.096 --> 01:00:51.326 A:middle
So I could just slide
that of course as usual.

01:00:51.326 --> 01:00:53.096 A:middle
It goes right into my messages.

01:00:53.406 --> 01:00:55.256 A:middle
And what I see here
is I have a thread

01:00:55.256 --> 01:00:57.286 A:middle
between me, Kim, and Craig.

01:00:57.496 --> 01:00:58.826 A:middle
But what I have that's new

01:00:58.826 --> 01:01:00.976 A:middle
in the upper right hand
corner is this Details button.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:00:58.826 --> 01:01:00.976 A:middle
in the upper right hand
corner is this Details button.

01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:04.396 A:middle
So if I tap it, it gives
me all kinds of information

01:01:04.396 --> 01:01:06.786 A:middle
about participants
in the message.

01:01:07.276 --> 01:01:10.946 A:middle
For one, Craig and Kim decided
to share their location with me.

01:01:11.136 --> 01:01:12.616 A:middle
So Craig of course
is up here with us

01:01:12.616 --> 01:01:16.886 A:middle
in San Francisco while Kim is
working hard back in Cupertino.

01:01:16.886 --> 01:01:17.816 A:middle
Thanks Kim for that.

01:01:18.076 --> 01:01:20.776 A:middle
One of the things I
can do is add contacts.

01:01:20.776 --> 01:01:22.676 A:middle
I can add people to this
conversation as we go,

01:01:22.676 --> 01:01:25.276 A:middle
but I can also choose
to share my location.

01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:27.326 A:middle
So if I just tap and Share
My Location, I can choose

01:01:27.326 --> 01:01:30.356 A:middle
to share my location for an
hour for the rest of the day

01:01:30.356 --> 01:01:33.526 A:middle
or I can keep sharing it until
I stop somewhere in the future.

01:01:33.976 --> 01:01:37.226 A:middle
But what's really convenient
is this Do Not Disturb button.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.856 A:middle
How many times you've
been in one

01:01:38.856 --> 01:01:41.296 A:middle
of those super chatty
group conversations

01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:42.796 A:middle
that your phone is
just continuing

01:01:42.796 --> 01:01:44.176 A:middle
to buzz over and over?

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.816 A:middle
Well now, I can just
choose to Do Not Disturb

01:01:46.816 --> 01:01:49.736 A:middle
that particular thread and
not get my phone buzzing.

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:51.616 A:middle
So, I'm going to find
that useful with Kim

01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:52.866 A:middle
and Craig, I know that for sure.

01:01:54.196 --> 01:01:55.896 A:middle
Or I can even Leave
this Conversation

01:01:55.896 --> 01:01:56.876 A:middle
with just a single tap.

01:01:57.406 --> 01:01:58.886 A:middle
What's also convenient
is the fact

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:01.606 A:middle
that I have all the
attachments, all the photos


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:01.606 A:middle
that I have all the
attachments, all the photos

01:02:01.606 --> 01:02:03.706 A:middle
from this conversation
all in one place.

01:02:03.706 --> 01:02:07.206 A:middle
So they still appear in line
in the thread but now instead

01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:09.506 A:middle
of trying to find that picture
by scrolling, scrolling,

01:02:09.506 --> 01:02:12.246 A:middle
scrolling, they all come in
one place here in the thread,

01:02:12.356 --> 01:02:13.566 A:middle
so very, very convenient.

01:02:13.726 --> 01:02:15.496 A:middle
So let's go back to
that conversation,

01:02:15.496 --> 01:02:16.806 A:middle
Kim had asked me how it's going.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.756 A:middle
Well, I have lots of
ways to reply to her.

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:21.316 A:middle
I could tap out which just
a few taps and, you know,

01:02:21.316 --> 01:02:23.216 A:middle
use my predictive
keyboard, a message.

01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:26.716 A:middle
But it's even cooler that I can
now do an audio or video message

01:02:26.716 --> 01:02:28.106 A:middle
to her with just a swipe.

01:02:28.516 --> 01:02:31.756 A:middle
So I'll send back an
audio message to her.

01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:35.776 A:middle
Hey Kim, I'm just hanging
out here with about 6,000

01:02:35.776 --> 01:02:36.796 A:middle
of our closest friends.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:39.046 A:middle
Having a good time while
Craig takes a much deserved

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:39.986 A:middle
break backstage.

01:02:40.586 --> 01:02:43.766 A:middle
Slide up, sends the
message just like that.

01:02:43.956 --> 01:02:45.026 A:middle
Super easy.

01:02:45.276 --> 01:02:47.206 A:middle
And I can do the same
thing with a video message

01:02:47.266 --> 01:02:48.246 A:middle
or even with a selfie.

01:02:48.336 --> 01:02:50.046 A:middle
So I'm going to dare
a selfie here.

01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:52.446 A:middle
It's all down the camera button.

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:03.586 A:middle
Not my best look.

01:03:03.586 --> 01:03:06.416 A:middle
Let's see what Kim
has to say about that.

01:03:06.486 --> 01:03:08.866 A:middle
So, I can-- see, I got an
audio message from Kim,

01:03:08.866 --> 01:03:11.096 A:middle
all I have to do is tap the play
button and hear the message.

01:03:11.936 --> 01:03:12.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Impressive Jos.

01:03:12.896 --> 01:03:15.136 A:middle
You've totally mastered
the duck face selfie.

01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:17.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad she likes it.

01:03:18.476 --> 01:03:21.506 A:middle
So it's super duper easy
to do this sort of things.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.486 A:middle
You notice that it said it
would expire in a couple

01:03:23.486 --> 01:03:25.076 A:middle
of minutes 'cause you don't
want to have this clean this up.

01:03:25.376 --> 01:03:27.126 A:middle
Audio and video messages
can take up space

01:03:27.126 --> 01:03:28.606 A:middle
so it self-destruct
unless you choose

01:03:28.606 --> 01:03:29.716 A:middle
to keep-- whoa, what's this?

01:03:30.616 --> 01:03:31.896 A:middle
So Craig should be backstage

01:03:31.896 --> 01:03:34.106 A:middle
but he apparently has sent me a
message and it looks important.

01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:35.296 A:middle
So if you don't mind I'm
going to play it back.

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.776 A:middle
And I can play it back in line
even with a video message here.

01:03:38.286 --> 01:03:42.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Jos, we got a serious
situation developing back here.

01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:43.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can't control this.

01:03:43.716 --> 01:03:45.376 A:middle
These are not going to work.

01:03:45.576 --> 01:03:46.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Bryan, you got
to do something.

01:03:47.176 --> 01:03:50.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I got it.

01:03:51.026 --> 01:03:52.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Jos, I'm going to need
you to buy some more time.

&gt;&gt; Needless to say, hair
like that doesn't come easy.

01:04:04.546 --> 01:04:07.076 A:middle
So while he's dealing with
his crisis backstage--

01:04:07.296 --> 01:04:09.646 A:middle
oh look, I've actually got
an audio message from him.

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:11.856 A:middle
Now, what's really cool
is I can actually listen

01:04:11.856 --> 01:04:14.856 A:middle
to audio messages and reply to
them from the lock screen simply

01:04:14.856 --> 01:04:16.296 A:middle
by raising the iPhone to my ear.

01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:20.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey Jos, we got the
crisis contained back here.

01:04:21.256 --> 01:04:25.356 A:middle
I'm good to go, so wrap it
up whenever you're ready.

01:04:25.356 --> 01:04:26.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And that's easy to
listen to a message.

01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.616 A:middle
I can reply to it the same way.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:30.916 A:middle
Craig, it's good to hear

01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:33.796 A:middle
that you survived the
great hair crisis of 2014.

01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:34.986 A:middle
I'll get things wrapped up here

01:04:34.986 --> 01:04:36.386 A:middle
and we'll get the
show back to you.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.906 A:middle
Lower it and the
message is sent.

01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:40.326 A:middle
Super easy.

01:04:40.726 --> 01:04:40.966 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:05:02.706 --> 01:05:08.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; OK. So next up, iCloud Drive.

01:05:09.346 --> 01:05:12.296 A:middle
So, of course, iCloud
documents work great

01:05:12.296 --> 01:05:15.936 A:middle
across a single app
on your iOS devices.

01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:20.306 A:middle
But now, with iCloud Drive,
you also have a great way

01:05:20.306 --> 01:05:22.446 A:middle
to work across applications.

01:05:22.876 --> 01:05:26.986 A:middle
So say you're in an app here
like Sketchbook, you can bring

01:05:26.986 --> 01:05:30.946 A:middle
up your iCloud Drive panel
and open documents directly

01:05:31.066 --> 01:05:32.366 A:middle
from other applications

01:05:32.366 --> 01:05:35.056 A:middle
like a compatible document
inside of GoodReader.

01:05:35.226 --> 01:05:38.716 A:middle
And when you open it up in that
document, in that application

01:05:38.716 --> 01:05:41.756 A:middle
and edit it, those edits
are saved right back

01:05:41.756 --> 01:05:43.046 A:middle
to their original locations.

01:05:43.046 --> 01:05:44.446 A:middle
So you don't end up with all

01:05:44.446 --> 01:05:46.496 A:middle
of these different
versions and copy problems.

01:05:47.086 --> 01:05:50.666 A:middle
Now, of course, you also have
access to all of those documents

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.306 A:middle
on your Mac and on
Windows as well.

01:05:53.796 --> 01:05:55.036 A:middle
So that's iCloud Drive.

01:05:55.536 --> 01:05:59.046 A:middle
Next up, something you weren't
expecting from me, Enterprise.

01:05:59.046 --> 01:06:01.686 A:middle
Now it turns out that iOS--


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:05:59.046 --> 01:06:01.686 A:middle
Now it turns out that iOS--

01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:05.386 A:middle
yeah, they got one Enterprise
guy over there, I know.

01:06:05.386 --> 01:06:07.636 A:middle
So iOS is a huge hit
in the Enterprise.

01:06:07.916 --> 01:06:12.626 A:middle
In fact, 98 percent of
the Fortune 500 uses iOS.

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:15.186 A:middle
And we're going to
get the last two.

01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:19.226 A:middle
And it's in part
because of these great

01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:21.676 A:middle
iOS-tailored applications.

01:06:22.406 --> 01:06:27.536 A:middle
But it's also because of the
amazing array of technologies,

01:06:27.536 --> 01:06:29.756 A:middle
both technologies that
applied to all of us

01:06:29.756 --> 01:06:32.126 A:middle
in protecting our
privacy and security

01:06:32.366 --> 01:06:34.736 A:middle
but also Enterprise
manageability features

01:06:34.736 --> 01:06:36.636 A:middle
that we've added to
iOS over the years.

01:06:37.346 --> 01:06:39.976 A:middle
Now, one of them
that we just released

01:06:39.976 --> 01:06:43.926 A:middle
in the last few months I think
is emblematic of our philosophy

01:06:43.926 --> 01:06:46.916 A:middle
of the Enterprise, and that's
the Device Enrollment Program.

01:06:47.496 --> 01:06:49.766 A:middle
Now traditionally, if you
go to work at a company

01:06:49.796 --> 01:06:51.896 A:middle
and they want you to give you
a device, they actually have

01:06:51.896 --> 01:06:54.836 A:middle
to take the device they give
you, rip it out of its box,

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:58.216 A:middle
connect it to some PC,
image it with software

01:06:58.216 --> 01:06:59.966 A:middle
to configure, it's a big pain.

But now with the Device
Enrollment Program,

01:07:02.696 --> 01:07:04.756 A:middle
you can actually get
your iPad or iPhone

01:07:05.096 --> 01:07:06.896 A:middle
in its original shrink wrap box.

01:07:07.326 --> 01:07:11.036 A:middle
And when you open it up, it'll
automatically configure itself

01:07:11.366 --> 01:07:13.776 A:middle
for your Enterprise,
setting up all of your mail

01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:16.136 A:middle
and getting your mail
messages, automatically setting

01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:19.436 A:middle
up your calendar, and even
downloading all your Enterprise

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:21.286 A:middle
apps, it's that simple.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:26.366 A:middle
Well now, in iOS 8, we
continue our focus on security,

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.206 A:middle
productivity and management.

01:07:28.706 --> 01:07:31.106 A:middle
iOS 8 has expanded
data protection.

01:07:31.106 --> 01:07:32.956 A:middle
So you get passcode protection

01:07:33.096 --> 01:07:35.996 A:middle
of all the major data types
including third-party apps.

01:07:36.626 --> 01:07:38.426 A:middle
We have a Per-message S/MIME

01:07:38.876 --> 01:07:41.356 A:middle
and we have a great productivity
feature I think we're all going

01:07:41.356 --> 01:07:43.326 A:middle
to like called VIP threads.

01:07:43.866 --> 01:07:46.796 A:middle
So now, there's a thread
you're on or message you send,

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:47.786 A:middle
and you want to get notified

01:07:47.786 --> 01:07:50.216 A:middle
on the lock screen whenever
there's a reply on that thread,

01:07:50.616 --> 01:07:52.356 A:middle
you can get that
with just a tap.

And we support third-party
Enterprise document providers

01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:06.666 A:middle
in addition to iCloud,
integrated right

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.796 A:middle
in to iCloud capable
applications.

01:08:09.516 --> 01:08:11.126 A:middle
Now we also improved
our management--

01:08:11.246 --> 01:08:12.756 A:middle
yes, the Enterprise

01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:15.241 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:18.836 A:middle
So, we also extend
our management

01:08:18.836 --> 01:08:20.586 A:middle
to include managed
books and PDFs,

01:08:20.586 --> 01:08:24.416 A:middle
and this is of course especially
valuable for education.

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:27.166 A:middle
So those are just a few
features for Enterprise.

01:08:27.856 --> 01:08:31.136 A:middle
Now, something that we all
care a lot about, Health.

01:08:31.626 --> 01:08:32.305 A:middle

01:08:36.376 --> 01:08:41.606 A:middle
So, developers have created a
vast array of healthcare devices

01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:44.145 A:middle
and accompanying applications,

01:08:44.216 --> 01:08:46.826 A:middle
everything from monitoring
your activity level,

01:08:47.246 --> 01:08:49.586 A:middle
to your heart rate,
to your weight,

01:08:50.216 --> 01:08:52.886 A:middle
and chronic medical conditions
like high blood pressure

01:08:53.236 --> 01:08:57.145 A:middle
and diabetes, but up to now
the information gathered

01:08:57.145 --> 01:09:00.066 A:middle
by those applications
lives in silos.

by those applications

01:09:00.406 --> 01:09:03.196 A:middle
You can't get a single
comprehensive picture

01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:04.986 A:middle
of your health situation.

01:09:05.656 --> 01:09:07.975 A:middle
But now you can with HealthKit.

01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:11.356 A:middle
HealthKit provides
a single place

01:09:11.576 --> 01:09:14.685 A:middle
that applications can contribute
to a composite profile

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:16.656 A:middle
of your activity and health.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.776 A:middle
And HealthKit comes

01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:20.765 A:middle
with a corresponding
application, Health.

01:09:21.486 --> 01:09:26.496 A:middle
And with Health, you can
monitor all of your metrics

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.136 A:middle
that you're most
interested in your activity.

01:09:29.446 --> 01:09:33.216 A:middle
But not just that, you can
use third-party applications.

01:09:33.216 --> 01:09:35.216 A:middle
Now we carefully
protect your privacy

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:38.176 A:middle
so you have total control over
which applications have access

01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:40.746 A:middle
to which part of your
healthcare information.

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:44.055 A:middle
But you can for instance provide
different activity, weight,

01:09:44.265 --> 01:09:47.376 A:middle
heart rate information
to the Nike app.

01:09:47.566 --> 01:09:49.645 A:middle
And Nike is working to
integrate HealthKit,

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:52.366 A:middle
so they use that information
to help you in your pursuit

01:09:52.366 --> 01:09:54.296 A:middle
of your personalized
fitness goals.

01:09:54.976 --> 01:09:57.526 A:middle

And with their integration
with HealthKit, they're going

01:10:03.326 --> 01:10:07.916 A:middle
to be able that when a patient
takes let's say a blood pressure

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:10.956 A:middle
reading, HealthKit
automatically notifies their app

01:10:11.316 --> 01:10:13.816 A:middle
and their app is automatically
able to check whether

01:10:13.816 --> 01:10:16.436 A:middle
that reading is within
that patient's personalized

01:10:18.706 --> 01:10:21.856 A:middle

the hospital proactively,

01:10:22.106 --> 01:10:24.886 A:middle
notify a doctor and that
doctor can reach back

01:10:25.006 --> 01:10:28.656 A:middle
to that patient providing
more timely care.

01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:29.136 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:10:35.806 --> 01:10:39.306 A:middle
Now we think this is going to be
really important for healthcare

01:10:39.306 --> 01:10:41.716 A:middle
and the CEO of the
Mayo Clinic agrees.

01:10:42.066 --> 01:10:44.516 A:middle
He says that, "We believe
Apple's HealthKit will

01:10:44.516 --> 01:10:47.026 A:middle
revolutionize the
health industry--

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:48.826 A:middle
how the health industry
interacts with people.

01:10:49.236 --> 01:10:50.556 A:middle
We're proud to be
at the forefront

of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app."

01:10:54.346 --> 01:10:57.246 A:middle

over 100 million Americans.

01:11:10.136 --> 01:11:13.566 A:middle

01:11:13.566 --> 01:11:16.266 A:middle

It's the easy way to
share what's important.

01:11:35.806 --> 01:11:37.266 A:middle
Now when I was a kid,

01:11:38.106 --> 01:11:41.056 A:middle
the refrigerator was the
center of family sharing.

01:11:41.056 --> 01:11:42.316 A:middle

like this except the
kid who had gray hair.

that easy to set up your family

01:11:51.176 --> 01:11:54.436 A:middle
on their iOS devices and once
you've set up your family

01:11:54.436 --> 01:11:57.356 A:middle

to in the home sharing
physical media.

but your device actually
has access to more photos

01:14:02.106 --> 01:14:04.846 A:middle
in the cloud than it can
physically store locally

01:14:05.216 --> 01:14:08.016 A:middle
so you can get them
all wherever you are.

Now of course, if you
have these many photos,

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:17.356 A:middle
you want great search and
so we now on iOS 8 Photos,

01:14:17.806 --> 01:14:20.636 A:middle
we give you great search
suggestions for instance

01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:24.256 A:middle
of locations, photos taken
near where you are right now,

01:14:25.076 --> 01:14:28.726 A:middle
photos taken a year ago today,
photos taken in your home,

01:14:28.726 --> 01:14:31.046 A:middle
but we also give you search.

01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:34.576 A:middle

match on things like location,

01:14:35.206 --> 01:14:40.826 A:middle

So here I am in my large
cloud photo collection,

01:15:14.746 --> 01:15:18.396 A:middle
and I have great search here,
so I have all my suggestion

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:21.586 A:middle
but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches

01:15:21.586 --> 01:15:23.466 A:middle
on location and time period.

01:15:23.856 --> 01:15:26.476 A:middle
But also an album, so here
I have beach day with Mandy.

01:15:26.476 --> 01:15:27.666 A:middle
And I can tap right in there,

01:15:28.636 --> 01:15:31.256 A:middle
look through these nice
photos, let's take a look.

01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:33.346 A:middle
Those are some good ones.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:37.046 A:middle
Now that's a photo that
I think has potential

01:15:37.796 --> 01:15:40.136 A:middle
but it's really quite dark
and kind of washed out.

01:15:40.686 --> 01:15:42.906 A:middle
Unfortunately, we have these
great smart editing controls

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:45.716 A:middle
that I can use to fix it up, so
I'm going to bring up our levels

01:15:45.716 --> 01:15:47.916 A:middle
and you also have levels
for light and color

01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:48.626 A:middle
down there at the bottom.

01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:49.546 A:middle
I'm going tap on light,

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:52.776 A:middle
and I get this great
smart light meter.

01:15:53.176 --> 01:15:56.486 A:middle
Now I can just drag this across
like this and it lightens

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:58.776 A:middle
up the photo really nicely,

01:15:58.776 --> 01:16:00.416 A:middle
so I dial that in
just the way I want.

But what's happening under
the hood is really amazing.

01:16:04.086 --> 01:16:06.456 A:middle
You notice that to achieve
the lightning effect,

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.176 A:middle
it brought brightness
and contrast up, exposure

01:16:10.176 --> 01:16:12.806 A:middle
and highlights down
and shadows up based

01:16:12.806 --> 01:16:15.366 A:middle
on detailed image analysis of
what would achieve that effect.

01:16:16.036 --> 01:16:18.266 A:middle
Now I could go in and
I could manually try

01:16:18.266 --> 01:16:21.046 A:middle
to tweak those parameters like
have that level of control

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:23.306 A:middle
but I don't need to because
it does such a great job

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:27.836 A:middle
and I also have that control
for color, so I can just drive

01:16:27.836 --> 01:16:31.336 A:middle
up the color for instance, bring
out the sky and the skin tones

01:16:31.936 --> 01:16:33.826 A:middle
and I look at the difference
of what we've been able

01:16:33.826 --> 01:16:38.386 A:middle
to achieve before, after,
it's really awesome.

of course immediately went
up to my cloud photo library.

to all my devices,

that right now in favorites,
I don't have that picture

01:17:01.746 --> 01:17:02.956 A:middle
because I didn't favorite it.

01:17:03.356 --> 01:17:04.656 A:middle
But now that I've
made those nice edits,

01:17:04.656 --> 01:17:06.396 A:middle
the picture is looking great,
I think I'll make it one

01:17:06.396 --> 01:17:08.746 A:middle
of my favorites, I'll just tap
on my iPhone on a little heart

01:17:09.436 --> 01:17:14.176 A:middle
and you notice that it appears
automatically here on my iPad,

01:17:15.046 --> 01:17:16.786 A:middle
so I can go into that
photo right here.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:21.156 A:middle
Now we have those same editing
controls tailored for iPad,

01:17:21.746 --> 01:17:24.526 A:middle
so I'm going to go in to
do a crop and do a kind

01:17:24.526 --> 01:17:29.216 A:middle
of extreme close up crop
here like this, hit done

01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:32.976 A:middle
and of course these changes
are going to go up live

01:17:33.186 --> 01:17:36.686 A:middle
to my iPad photo library and
it go right across to my phone.

01:17:42.736 --> 01:17:44.956 A:middle
So of course you may be
wondering what about the Mac?

01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:49.666 A:middle
Well good news, we are
working on a new grounds

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:54.326 A:middle
up photo solution for the Mac
built with iCloud in mind,

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:57.016 A:middle
and that's going to be
shipping early next year but I'd

01:17:57.016 --> 01:17:58.516 A:middle
like to give you
a sneak peek now.

01:17:58.956 --> 01:18:00.496 A:middle
All right.

All right.

01:18:02.776 --> 01:18:06.446 A:middle
So let's take a look
at photos on the Mac.

01:18:07.546 --> 01:18:13.216 A:middle
As you see, I get beautiful
buttery scrolling here.

01:18:13.936 --> 01:18:18.156 A:middle
I have my moments right here,
I can pinch out if I want

01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:22.476 A:middle
from moments to collections
and all the way out to years.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:28.276 A:middle
I can scrub through my photos
like this even in year view.

01:18:28.656 --> 01:18:32.166 A:middle
If I find a photo I like,
just let go and zoom right in.

01:18:32.966 --> 01:18:36.866 A:middle
You watch as I magnify
this photo, the interplay

01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:39.026 A:middle
with the title bar,
it's really gorgeous.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:44.166 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and browse
through these a little bit.

01:18:47.116 --> 01:18:49.296 A:middle
Now here's a photo
that looks really

01:18:49.296 --> 01:18:50.396 A:middle
like it's got some potential

01:18:50.396 --> 01:18:52.496 A:middle
but it could use
some brightening up,

01:18:53.086 --> 01:18:55.046 A:middle
can have the same
kinds of adjustments.

01:18:55.726 --> 01:18:57.946 A:middle
You notice here at this
light and color meters, well,

01:18:57.946 --> 01:19:00.746 A:middle
I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens

01:19:01.026 --> 01:19:03.976 A:middle
in real time as I make
the lighting adjustment.

01:19:04.426 --> 01:19:06.686 A:middle
And notice how some of these
are going up and some are going

01:19:06.686 --> 01:19:10.836 A:middle
down to create this
effect, it's really great.

01:19:10.836 --> 01:19:14.466 A:middle
I can do the same with color,
let's just boost the color,

01:19:15.586 --> 01:19:20.036 A:middle
bring out the sky, bring out the
skin tones, and it's that easy,

01:19:21.126 --> 01:19:24.816 A:middle
the new photos app, to really
create beautiful images.

01:19:25.156 --> 01:19:28.686 A:middle
And that's a quick preview
of photos coming to Yosemite

01:19:28.686 --> 01:19:31.986 A:middle
in the future and to
the new photo solution

01:19:31.986 --> 01:19:35.886 A:middle

with your Mac and via
the web, Windows as well.

01:19:54.586 --> 01:19:58.116 A:middle
Now this is all your
photos and also your videos.

01:19:58.386 --> 01:20:00.546 A:middle
And these are in
their original format

01:20:03.336 --> 01:20:05.276 A:middle
Now this uses your
iCloud storage,

01:20:05.616 --> 01:20:07.716 A:middle
so your first 5 gigs are free.

01:20:08.056 --> 01:20:10.976 A:middle
And we have some great new
affordable plans coming,

01:20:10.976 --> 01:20:15.586 A:middle
where you get 20 gigs for just
99 cents a month and 200 gigs

01:20:15.996 --> 01:20:18.496 A:middle
for 3.99, so we can all afford

01:20:18.496 --> 01:20:20.986 A:middle

01:20:30.676 --> 01:20:34.726 A:middle
So, a great set of major
features coming to iOS.

01:20:35.016 --> 01:20:38.426 A:middle
But of course, there's
always a whole lot more

01:20:38.426 --> 01:20:40.016 A:middle
than I have time
to talk about here.

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:44.376 A:middle
I do want to hit on just two
more quickly, and one is Siri.

01:20:44.886 --> 01:20:48.736 A:middle
Now, we have-- if you take
your phone and you plug it

01:20:48.736 --> 01:20:51.656 A:middle
in for instance in the car,
you can say, "Hey Siri,"

01:20:51.656 --> 01:20:53.946 A:middle
and start talking to
Siri without having

01:20:53.946 --> 01:20:55.466 A:middle
to even touch your phone.

01:20:55.906 --> 01:20:58.606 A:middle
And we have song
recognition with Shazam.

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:01.426 A:middle
So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:01.426 A:middle
So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing

01:21:01.426 --> 01:21:03.476 A:middle
around you, it will
tell you what it is

01:21:03.476 --> 01:21:06.756 A:middle
and you can even purchase it
right there from within Siri.

01:21:07.406 --> 01:21:10.176 A:middle
Siri also now supports
streaming voice recognition.

01:21:10.416 --> 01:21:12.536 A:middle
So as you talk, you can
see what it's recognizing.

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:15.596 A:middle
It's more responsive than
ever, and we have support

01:21:15.596 --> 01:21:18.206 A:middle
for 22 new dictation languages.

01:21:19.656 --> 01:21:23.686 A:middle
Finally, in China we now
have greatly improved maps

01:21:23.686 --> 01:21:27.276 A:middle
with vector based maps and
turn by turn directions.

01:21:27.776 --> 01:21:30.616 A:middle
We also have support for
lunar calendar which is great

01:21:30.896 --> 01:21:32.436 A:middle
for holidays and birthdays.

01:21:32.966 --> 01:21:37.336 A:middle
Improved Chinese predictive
input and improved weather data.

01:21:38.606 --> 01:21:41.036 A:middle

half of the story,

Amazing new features, and if we
ended the keynote now it would

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.746 A:middle
be a giant release.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.716 A:middle
But there is a lot more.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:18.316 A:middle
The second part of the
story is what iOS 8 provides

01:22:18.386 --> 01:22:19.616 A:middle
for developers.

01:22:20.196 --> 01:22:24.716 A:middle

make even more incredible apps

and apps you could
not create before.

Now, all of these apps are
delivered via the App Store.

01:22:34.356 --> 01:22:40.276 A:middle
The App Store now has over 1.2
million of your apps on it.

01:22:40.276 --> 01:22:42.026 A:middle
This is a phenomenal number.

01:22:42.636 --> 01:22:47.526 A:middle
And the marketplace around these
apps is unbelievably vibrant,

the App Store every week.

make the App Store even better.

And so, we're rolling out
a number of new features

01:23:16.836 --> 01:23:23.286 A:middle
on the store, starting with
we're adding an Explore tab

01:23:23.906 --> 01:23:27.726 A:middle
to help users find the app
they're looking for more.

01:23:27.726 --> 01:23:30.866 A:middle
So you can browse through
categories and subcategories.

01:23:31.576 --> 01:23:33.716 A:middle
We're adding top
trending searches

01:23:33.716 --> 01:23:35.476 A:middle
to make search even better.

01:23:35.776 --> 01:23:41.546 A:middle
It's great to see WWDC
at the top by the way.

01:23:41.546 --> 01:23:45.746 A:middle
We're making-- finding
your search even better

01:23:45.746 --> 01:23:50.166 A:middle
by making it faster by adding
a continuous scrolling list.

01:23:50.696 --> 01:23:53.506 A:middle
We're adding related
searches to make it easier

01:23:53.506 --> 01:23:56.056 A:middle
to find exactly the
app you're looking for.

01:23:56.716 --> 01:23:59.346 A:middle

them through the week

And for those of you
that are not developers,

01:25:41.946 --> 01:25:44.636 A:middle
the SDK is a Software

to make things that
you haven't dreamed of

So, with this year's SDK, the
team has done just an unreal job

01:26:33.996 --> 01:26:37.306 A:middle
with over 4,000 new
developer APIs.

01:26:37.306 --> 01:26:40.356 A:middle
Now, I want to start
with something

01:26:40.356 --> 01:26:42.596 A:middle
that I think is perhaps
most profound

01:26:43.526 --> 01:26:45.416 A:middle
and that's Extensibility.

01:26:46.146 --> 01:26:48.596 A:middle
So with Extensibility,
applications

01:26:48.596 --> 01:26:52.216 A:middle
from the App Store will be
able to extend the system

01:26:52.446 --> 01:26:54.786 A:middle

01:27:05.096 --> 01:27:05.866 A:middle
Now of course, one

01:27:05.866 --> 01:27:08.686 A:middle
of the reasons we're also
comfortable installing

01:27:08.686 --> 01:27:13.366 A:middle
so many apps from the App
Store are iOS' security model.

01:27:13.566 --> 01:27:16.126 A:middle
Apps are isolated
inside of sandboxes

01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:18.436 A:middle
where they can access their
own data but can't get

01:27:18.436 --> 01:27:20.886 A:middle
at your personal information
or mess with other apps

01:27:21.136 --> 01:27:22.026 A:middle
without your permission.

01:27:22.806 --> 01:27:25.496 A:middle
Well, the handle
Extensibility in an iOS way,

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.136 A:middle
we wanted to build on the
same sandboxing model.

01:27:29.576 --> 01:27:33.426 A:middle
So now extensions live inside
an application's own sandbox

01:27:33.426 --> 01:27:36.846 A:middle
with access to its own data,
but other applications can reach

01:27:36.846 --> 01:27:40.466 A:middle
out by way of iOS'
security mechanisms,

01:27:40.816 --> 01:27:41.906 A:middle
talk to that extension.

01:27:41.946 --> 01:27:44.746 A:middle
That extension can even
project UI right back

01:27:44.746 --> 01:27:45.876 A:middle
in to the originating app.

01:27:46.556 --> 01:27:48.346 A:middle
Now this enables
some great things.

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.136 A:middle
For instance, in addition

01:27:50.136 --> 01:27:52.136 A:middle
to the systems built-in
sharing options,

01:27:52.606 --> 01:27:56.286 A:middle
an app like Pinterest can
offer share sheet to Safari.

01:27:57.226 --> 01:28:00.496 A:middle
And if you look at
actions, for instance,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:57.226 --> 01:28:00.496 A:middle
And if you look at
actions, for instance,

01:28:00.496 --> 01:28:04.356 A:middle
an app like Bing could offer
translation right inside

01:28:04.356 --> 01:28:09.666 A:middle
of Safari accessing the web
pages web content right there.

01:28:10.276 --> 01:28:14.196 A:middle
Now we're also supporting photo
filters inside the photos,

01:28:14.616 --> 01:28:16.286 A:middle
and enabling third parties

01:28:16.316 --> 01:28:19.206 A:middle
to define their own
document providers that work

01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:22.206 A:middle
within the iCloud
drive-enabled application.

01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:27.936 A:middle
Finally, we're enabling third
party apps to define widgets

01:28:28.276 --> 01:28:29.856 A:middle
that can now go in

I think it feels
like time for a demo.

01:28:42.336 --> 01:28:44.886 A:middle
So let's start with
photo filters.

01:28:45.836 --> 01:28:47.396 A:middle
So, we're back here in photos

01:28:47.396 --> 01:28:51.006 A:middle
and I've got a nice
photo here of a flower.

01:28:51.006 --> 01:28:53.876 A:middle
And I'm going to go ahead and
edit and you notice an addition

01:28:53.876 --> 01:28:55.646 A:middle
to the options here at
the bottom of the screen,

01:28:56.296 --> 01:28:59.076 A:middle
we have at the top left
this extensions button.

01:28:59.076 --> 01:29:00.996 A:middle
I'm going to click
that, tap that rather.

I'm going to click
that, tap that rather.

01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:04.246 A:middle
And you notice I have
several extensions available,

01:29:04.246 --> 01:29:06.756 A:middle
one from VSCO Cam and
one from Waterlogue.

01:29:06.756 --> 01:29:07.976 A:middle
I'm going to select Waterlogue.

01:29:08.516 --> 01:29:11.566 A:middle
And now the Waterlogue extension
is able to run right here

01:29:11.566 --> 01:29:15.166 A:middle
in the context of photos to
manipulate my photo bringing

01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:20.786 A:middle
up their own UI, deliver this
beautiful water color effect

01:29:21.286 --> 01:29:26.166 A:middle
to my photo, and when I'm
done, it's right back inside

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:27.976 A:middle
of my photo album,
it's that easy.

[ Applause ]

01:29:34.356 --> 01:29:36.026 A:middle
Then next let's take
a look at widgets.

01:29:36.026 --> 01:29:38.956 A:middle
So I'm going to just pull
down Notification Center.

01:29:39.056 --> 01:29:42.106 A:middle
I have my existing widgets
here in my Today view.

01:29:42.566 --> 01:29:45.126 A:middle
Did you notice an addition
to my widget is down here

01:29:45.126 --> 01:29:46.976 A:middle
at the bottom it says
"One New Widget Available"

01:29:47.166 --> 01:29:48.956 A:middle
because I've downloaded
an app recently

01:29:48.956 --> 01:29:51.696 A:middle
that contains a Notification
Center widget.

01:29:51.696 --> 01:29:52.586 A:middle
So I'm going to tap Edit.

01:29:52.586 --> 01:29:54.686 A:middle
And you notice its SportsCenter.

01:29:54.686 --> 01:29:56.616 A:middle
So I can tap the plus
next to SportsCenter,

01:29:57.186 --> 01:30:00.146 A:middle
position it where I want, I'm
on my widgets in my Today view.

I have information

01:30:03.116 --> 01:30:06.556 A:middle
on my favorite sports
teams right here inside

01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:07.626 A:middle
of Notification Center.

01:30:08.306 --> 01:30:11.076 A:middle
Now this works great
on iPad as well.

01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:12.966 A:middle
Let's take a look at iPad.

01:30:13.996 --> 01:30:16.946 A:middle
So iPad, I'm going to bring
down Notification Center.

01:30:17.156 --> 01:30:19.886 A:middle
And you notice I have this
interactive widget from eBay.

01:30:20.646 --> 01:30:25.686 A:middle
So, I'm bidding on a guitar and
apparently I'm being outbid.

01:30:26.066 --> 01:30:28.376 A:middle
So I can now write inside of
notification, take advantage

01:30:28.376 --> 01:30:29.626 A:middle
of the interactivity widgets.

01:30:30.096 --> 01:30:33.376 A:middle
I can tap and bid
and just like this,

01:30:34.066 --> 01:30:38.556 A:middle
I can submit a leading bid all
inside of Notification Center.

01:30:39.216 --> 01:30:41.856 A:middle
Now to wrap it up, I want to
show you extensions in Safari.

01:30:41.946 --> 01:30:43.386 A:middle
I'm going to bring up Safari.

01:30:44.036 --> 01:30:45.496 A:middle

at here with some information

on a beautiful guitar and I'd
like to learn more about it but,

01:30:52.506 --> 01:30:55.966 A:middle
unfortunately, you notice
the text here is in Japanese

01:30:55.966 --> 01:30:57.626 A:middle
and I do not read Japanese.

01:30:58.196 --> 01:31:00.766 A:middle

translation extension,

01:31:01.126 --> 01:31:05.366 A:middle
so I can just bring
up my action sheet.

01:31:05.366 --> 01:31:07.836 A:middle
And you notice down here in
the second row, Bing translate,

01:31:07.836 --> 01:31:10.546 A:middle
I'm going to tap on
that and Bing is able

01:31:10.546 --> 01:31:13.456 A:middle
to translate this web
page right in line.

grand finale,

01:31:24.426 --> 01:31:27.406 A:middle
let's put that on
my Pinterest board.

01:31:27.406 --> 01:31:29.296 A:middle

an extension right here.

01:31:29.296 --> 01:31:32.726 A:middle
I'm going to tap on that and
this is actually able to bring

01:31:32.726 --> 01:31:35.776 A:middle
up a UI defined by Pinterest
where I can select my board,

01:31:35.776 --> 01:31:37.146 A:middle
maybe select my guitar's board.

01:31:37.146 --> 01:31:39.366 A:middle
Now the Pinterest
extension is accessed

01:31:39.366 --> 01:31:41.486 A:middle
to the underlying
web page, so I can--

01:31:41.916 --> 01:31:43.756 A:middle
let me slide through
the different photos

01:31:43.756 --> 01:31:46.146 A:middle
on the page till I find
the one I want to share.

01:31:46.486 --> 01:31:47.206 A:middle

Now there's one important kind
of extension that I did fail

01:32:03.806 --> 01:32:05.986 A:middle
to mention and that's
the ability

01:32:05.986 --> 01:32:09.756 A:middle
to install system-wide
third party keyboards.

01:32:16.426 --> 01:32:18.656 A:middle
So now if you have special
keyboard you want to use,

01:32:18.656 --> 01:32:20.026 A:middle
you can install those in iOS.

01:32:20.396 --> 01:32:23.306 A:middle
And by default, those
of course run inside

01:32:23.306 --> 01:32:26.576 A:middle
of the most restrictive
sandbox with no network access

01:32:26.606 --> 01:32:28.706 A:middle
because we want to make sure
to protect your privacy.

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:33.086 A:middle
But if that keyboard requires
or you want to grant it ability,

01:32:33.086 --> 01:32:35.226 A:middle
it can ask for access
to the network

01:32:35.736 --> 01:32:38.046 A:middle
to provide extended
functionality.

From the moment we
introduced Touch ID,

01:33:02.826 --> 01:33:05.236 A:middle
developers were excited
about the potential

01:33:05.666 --> 01:33:07.406 A:middle
and there's no question why,

01:33:07.406 --> 01:33:10.716 A:middle
Touch ID has been
extremely popular

01:33:10.896 --> 01:33:12.726 A:middle
and people authenticating
in their devices.

01:33:12.726 --> 01:33:14.696 A:middle
If you look at passcode usage

01:33:14.696 --> 01:33:16.976 A:middle

On iPhone 5s 83 percent,
people love using Touch ID.

01:33:23.166 --> 01:33:26.076 A:middle

apps can take advantage

01:33:26.076 --> 01:33:27.356 A:middle
of Touch ID as well.

So it identifies successful
fingerprint matches

01:33:44.626 --> 01:33:47.366 A:middle
but it always keeps the
fingerprint data itself

of the Secure Enclave
in the A7 processor.

The fingerprint information
is never exposed

But, you know, each of them
have their own application

01:34:55.026 --> 01:34:58.556 A:middle

their own network protocol,

with a common network protocol

that has secure pairing
to ensure

01:35:17.416 --> 01:35:20.486 A:middle
that only your iPhone

And in addition to being able
to control individual devices

in your home, with HomeKit you
can group devices and changes

01:35:29.496 --> 01:35:33.126 A:middle
in the scenes and then with
Siri integration you can say

01:35:33.126 --> 01:35:35.686 A:middle
something like, "Get ready
for bed," and be assured

01:35:35.686 --> 01:35:38.226 A:middle
that your garage door is
closed, your door is locked,

01:35:51.556 --> 01:35:53.106 A:middle
Next, CloudKit.

01:35:53.876 --> 01:35:55.746 A:middle
So today, if you're a developer

01:35:55.776 --> 01:35:57.276 A:middle
and you're writing
an application

01:35:57.486 --> 01:36:00.646 A:middle
and it needs a web component,
well, you end up really having


WEBVTT

01:35:57.486 --> 01:36:00.646 A:middle
and it needs a web component,
well, you end up really having

01:36:00.646 --> 01:36:02.236 A:middle
to write two apps in one.

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:05.506 A:middle
In addition to the writing in
the client side using Xcode

01:36:05.506 --> 01:36:06.866 A:middle
and our frameworks, you have

01:36:06.866 --> 01:36:08.096 A:middle
to write the server
side of the app.

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:11.806 A:middle
You have to write server side
app logic, you have to deal

01:36:11.806 --> 01:36:14.646 A:middle
with authentication, asset
storage, database storage,

01:36:14.646 --> 01:36:17.016 A:middle
search, even push
notifications and then you got

01:36:17.016 --> 01:36:18.346 A:middle
to pay somebody to host it all.

01:36:19.276 --> 01:36:23.086 A:middle
Well, now, with CloudKit,
CloudKit takes

01:36:23.086 --> 01:36:25.756 A:middle
over the cloud part
and provide you

01:36:25.756 --> 01:36:28.066 A:middle
with a client side
programming model

01:36:28.356 --> 01:36:32.456 A:middle
that lets you access iCloud
authentication storage,

01:36:32.566 --> 01:36:34.016 A:middle
search and more.

01:36:34.516 --> 01:36:36.216 A:middle
And when it comes to paying,

01:36:36.836 --> 01:36:43.946 A:middle
CloudKit is effectively
free, with limits.

01:36:45.716 --> 01:36:49.606 A:middle
So, CloudKit scales the
data allocated to your app

01:36:49.606 --> 01:36:52.476 A:middle
and bandwidth based on the
number of users using your app.

01:36:53.256 --> 01:36:56.916 A:middle
And this goes all the way up
to granting you free a petabyte

01:36:56.916 --> 01:36:59.126 A:middle
of assets, 10 terabytes
of database

01:36:59.386 --> 01:37:02.416 A:middle
and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use.

and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use.

01:37:02.966 --> 01:37:04.736 A:middle
That is CloudKit.

[ Applause ]

01:37:13.436 --> 01:37:16.706 A:middle
Next, I want to move on to
something huge in the area

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:22.346 A:middle
of 3D graphics, and
it's called Metal, so--

01:37:23.016 --> 01:37:24.886 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

01:37:24.886 --> 01:37:29.366 A:middle
As you know, OpenGL is
the standards based way

01:37:29.366 --> 01:37:33.486 A:middle
for high performance 3D graphics
on iOS, giving you access

01:37:33.486 --> 01:37:36.096 A:middle
to the power of the
A7 processor.

01:37:37.026 --> 01:37:39.486 A:middle
But increasingly, if you look at
what goes on in the performance

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:42.436 A:middle
of the game, in addition to what
the game wants to accomplish,

01:37:42.436 --> 01:37:46.166 A:middle
OpenGL ends up being a
thick layer of overhead

01:37:46.466 --> 01:37:48.606 A:middle
between the game
and the hardware.

01:37:49.756 --> 01:37:51.046 A:middle
Well, now, we have Metal.

01:37:51.396 --> 01:37:53.976 A:middle
And Metal dramatically reduces

01:37:53.976 --> 01:37:56.636 A:middle
that overhead giving
the game near bare

01:37:56.636 --> 01:37:59.056 A:middle
to the metal access
to the power of A7.

01:37:59.956 --> 01:38:04.986 A:middle
The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:37:59.956 --> 01:38:04.986 A:middle
The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates.

01:38:05.736 --> 01:38:10.646 A:middle
Now, in addition to these
dramatically reduced overheads,

01:38:11.496 --> 01:38:13.236 A:middle
you get access not
just to graphics

01:38:13.236 --> 01:38:15.566 A:middle
but to the compute
power of the GPU,

01:38:16.216 --> 01:38:18.536 A:middle
and Metal supports
pre-compiled shaders

01:38:18.536 --> 01:38:19.836 A:middle
and efficient multithreading

01:38:19.946 --> 01:38:22.266 A:middle
so you can always get the
most out of the processor.

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:26.336 A:middle
Now, we've been working
with the leading providers

01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:29.886 A:middle
of gaming engines
on mobile platforms

01:38:30.636 --> 01:38:32.856 A:middle
and what they've been able
to accomplish with Metal

01:38:33.156 --> 01:38:35.756 A:middle
in just a few weeks
is truly stunning.

01:38:37.176 --> 01:38:39.906 A:middle
Let's start with EA and the
work they've done taking their

01:38:39.946 --> 01:38:46.806 A:middle
console level title Plants vs.
Zombies and bringing it to iOS.

01:38:47.496 --> 01:38:51.876 A:middle
They're able to put over 1.3
million triangles on the screen

01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:55.166 A:middle
at a time and do depth
of motion, effects,

01:38:55.466 --> 01:38:58.686 A:middle
depth of field effects that they
could never imagine achieving.

01:38:58.686 --> 01:39:01.916 A:middle
In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:04.936 A:middle
that they thought could never
come to mobile and now it can.

01:39:05.966 --> 01:39:07.246 A:middle
And let's look at Crytek.

01:39:08.536 --> 01:39:12.626 A:middle
Crytek was able to bring their
console-level geom cache to iOS

01:39:13.736 --> 01:39:14.646 A:middle
and they were able to get

01:39:14.816 --> 01:39:17.976 A:middle
up to 4000 draw calls
per frame going here.

01:39:18.556 --> 01:39:20.476 A:middle
This is up to 10x, the kind

01:39:20.476 --> 01:39:22.486 A:middle
of performance they
were seeing previously.

01:39:23.726 --> 01:39:28.936 A:middle
Now, to show you live what
can be done with Metal,

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:32.356 A:middle
I'd like to bring up the
founder of Epic Games

01:39:32.356 --> 01:39:34.646 A:middle
to the stage, Tim Sweeney.

01:39:34.726 --> 01:39:36.456 A:middle

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:48.246 A:middle
We've had the opportunity
to work with Metal

01:39:48.446 --> 01:39:50.286 A:middle
and to illustrate some
of the possibilities,

01:39:50.286 --> 01:39:51.996 A:middle
we created a Zen Garden.

01:39:52.606 --> 01:39:55.786 A:middle
Now this environment was built

01:39:56.306 --> 01:39:58.276 A:middle
in Unreal Engine 4
on a high-end Mac.

01:39:58.636 --> 01:40:02.516 A:middle

running it on iPad in Realtime

running it on iPad in Realtime

01:40:02.516 --> 01:40:04.226 A:middle
with full fidelity
and performance.

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:08.506 A:middle
Metal's efficiency enable us
an order of magnitude increase

01:40:08.506 --> 01:40:11.456 A:middle
in detail making it possible
for developers like us

01:40:11.456 --> 01:40:13.596 A:middle
to create a new generation
of vivid

01:40:13.596 --> 01:40:15.446 A:middle
and interactive 3D experiences.

01:40:16.146 --> 01:40:18.126 A:middle
Now Josh Adams is the
programmer who wrote much

01:40:18.126 --> 01:40:19.266 A:middle
of the code that's running.

01:40:19.496 --> 01:40:21.056 A:middle
Josh, can you explain
what we're seeing here?

01:40:21.466 --> 01:40:21.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

01:40:22.486 --> 01:40:25.146 A:middle
First of all thanks to Metal
support for precompiled shaders,

01:40:25.576 --> 01:40:27.126 A:middle
we can have a huge
variety of materials

01:40:27.126 --> 01:40:28.036 A:middle
without a load time impact.

01:40:28.036 --> 01:40:31.066 A:middle
And our first stop we'll
check out this cherry tree

01:40:31.616 --> 01:40:34.026 A:middle
where I can drag on the
screen to paint the petals

01:40:34.026 --> 01:40:36.006 A:middle
on to the tree and they
start falling to the ground.

01:40:36.716 --> 01:40:39.476 A:middle
There are about 5,000 petals
here being physically simulated

01:40:40.166 --> 01:40:41.916 A:middle
and I can interact with them
by touching on the screen

01:40:41.916 --> 01:40:42.876 A:middle
to blow wind through the area.

01:40:43.066 --> 01:40:48.836 A:middle
All right, next up we
have a Koi pond filled

01:40:48.836 --> 01:40:49.546 A:middle
with hundreds of fish.

01:40:50.486 --> 01:40:53.186 A:middle
Metal has freed up enough
CPU time and we can have each

01:40:53.186 --> 01:40:54.706 A:middle
of them running their own
artificial intelligence

01:40:55.036 --> 01:40:56.726 A:middle
which you can see here as
I drag around the water.

01:40:56.856 --> 01:40:59.766 A:middle
And there's a few more fish
here than a real Koi pond

01:40:59.766 --> 01:41:01.236 A:middle
but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not.

but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not.

01:41:03.276 --> 01:41:05.046 A:middle
And of course every Zen garden
needs some sand to rake.

01:41:06.396 --> 01:41:09.386 A:middle
So I go over here I can
rake any pattern I want

01:41:09.386 --> 01:41:10.116 A:middle
into the sand here.

01:41:11.146 --> 01:41:13.206 A:middle
Now artist love that they
can make an effect like this

01:41:13.636 --> 01:41:15.056 A:middle
without needing a
programmer like me to make

01:41:15.216 --> 01:41:17.546 A:middle
that one-off effect for
a drop core reduction

01:41:17.546 --> 01:41:18.516 A:middle
or other optimizations.

01:41:22.796 --> 01:41:25.286 A:middle
And for our final
moment of Zen walk

01:41:25.286 --> 01:41:25.966 A:middle
over to this water fountain.

01:41:28.086 --> 01:41:32.086 A:middle
Now I can tap on it, pour out
some water which then turns

01:41:32.196 --> 01:41:33.346 A:middle
to a couple hundred butterflies

01:41:34.126 --> 01:41:35.506 A:middle
but of course not
going to stop there.

01:41:36.566 --> 01:41:38.426 A:middle
So I can touch the screen
to call more of them to me

01:41:38.556 --> 01:41:39.526 A:middle
and then guide them
around the area.

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:43.686 A:middle
So there are about 3,500
individually animated

01:41:43.686 --> 01:41:44.986 A:middle
and rendered butterfly
meshes here.

01:41:44.986 --> 01:41:47.656 A:middle
Now I had to keep telling the
artist to turn the numbers up

01:41:47.656 --> 01:41:49.236 A:middle
and up because they do not think
it was going to be possible.

01:41:50.006 --> 01:41:50.486 A:middle

There are thousands of objects
being rendered here and it seem

01:42:07.136 --> 01:42:09.346 A:middle
that we couldn't have
dreamed of building prior

01:42:09.346 --> 01:42:11.636 A:middle
to Metal delivering
a tenfold increase

01:42:11.636 --> 01:42:12.756 A:middle
in rendering efficiency.

01:42:12.756 --> 01:42:16.226 A:middle
To have this level of
graphics capability on iPhone

01:42:16.226 --> 01:42:18.896 A:middle
and iPad now is a
stunning breakthrough.

01:42:18.896 --> 01:42:22.906 A:middle
We're proud to have been a part
of it and of course we'd love

01:42:22.906 --> 01:42:23.886 A:middle
to share this with you.

01:42:23.976 --> 01:42:26.586 A:middle
So as soon as iOS 8 is
available we will be making

01:42:26.586 --> 01:42:29.496 A:middle
that Zen garden available
in the app store for free.

Its incredible graphics
they were able to achieve

01:42:47.326 --> 01:42:49.386 A:middle
and I think we are all
feeling very Zen now.

01:42:49.546 --> 01:42:50.146 A:middle
So that's very good.

01:42:50.776 --> 01:42:51.626 A:middle
So that's Metal.

01:42:51.996 --> 01:42:54.626 A:middle
Now I want to move
from high-end 3D gaming

01:42:55.206 --> 01:42:57.926 A:middle
to casual gaming in Sprite Kit.

01:42:58.136 --> 01:43:00.476 A:middle
We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC.

We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC.

01:43:00.476 --> 01:43:02.606 A:middle
And it's been a big hit

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.616 A:middle
with people building casual
games on the app store.

01:43:06.196 --> 01:43:09.116 A:middle
And now this year we've
really enhanced Sprite Kit

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.346 A:middle
with some things that make
your casual games just

01:43:11.346 --> 01:43:12.326 A:middle
that much more fun.

01:43:12.766 --> 01:43:16.086 A:middle
We have support for light
sources, field forces,

01:43:16.726 --> 01:43:19.316 A:middle
per-pixel physics that
actually allow your objects

01:43:19.316 --> 01:43:22.006 A:middle
to automatically interact
with proper physics based

01:43:22.006 --> 01:43:25.646 A:middle
on their drawn shapes and
even inverse kinematics.

01:43:26.346 --> 01:43:28.876 A:middle
And now also this year
for the first time

01:43:28.876 --> 01:43:32.026 A:middle
on iOS we're bringing SceneKit.

[ Applause ]

01:43:37.026 --> 01:43:39.446 A:middle
Now SceneKit is a
3D scene renderer

01:43:39.726 --> 01:43:42.506 A:middle
and now it's been enhanced
as designed for casual games

01:43:42.506 --> 01:43:45.676 A:middle
with an integrated physics
engine, particle systems

01:43:45.726 --> 01:43:48.046 A:middle
and support for scripted
actions.

01:43:48.466 --> 01:43:51.406 A:middle

for casual games on iOS.

01:44:11.646 --> 01:44:15.776 A:middle
The last version was
downloaded 14 million times.

01:44:16.816 --> 01:44:17.776 A:middle
It's unbelievable.

01:44:18.456 --> 01:44:22.776 A:middle
Now of course central to
Xcode is the language we use

01:44:22.776 --> 01:44:25.456 A:middle
to develop our apps,
Objective-C.

01:44:26.486 --> 01:44:30.956 A:middle
Now Objective-C has served
us so well for 20 years.

01:44:30.956 --> 01:44:32.146 A:middle
We absolutely love it.

01:44:32.146 --> 01:44:35.616 A:middle
But we had to ask ourselves
the question what would it be

01:44:35.616 --> 01:44:40.536 A:middle
like if we had Objective-C
without the baggage of C?

01:44:41.516 --> 01:44:43.626 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

01:44:44.126 --> 01:44:46.466 A:middle
Well we did more
than think about it.

01:44:47.936 --> 01:44:49.686 A:middle
We have a new programming
language.

01:45:00.856 --> 01:45:04.406 A:middle
The language is called Swift
and it totally rules [laughter].

01:45:06.146 --> 01:45:07.656 A:middle
Swift is fast.

01:45:07.866 --> 01:45:08.766 A:middle
It is modern.

01:45:09.146 --> 01:45:10.656 A:middle
It is designed for safety.

01:45:10.656 --> 01:45:13.276 A:middle
And it enables the level of
interactivity and development

01:45:13.276 --> 01:45:15.136 A:middle
that you've never
seen on the platform.

01:45:15.926 --> 01:45:19.646 A:middle
When it comes to
speed, Swift is great.

01:45:19.876 --> 01:45:21.916 A:middle
Compare Python a popular
scripting language

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.806 A:middle
with Objective-C, when it
comes to something like,

01:45:23.806 --> 01:45:25.406 A:middle
let's say complex object sort.

01:45:25.676 --> 01:45:27.186 A:middle
Objective-C is a lot faster.

01:45:28.516 --> 01:45:30.066 A:middle
But Swift is faster still.

01:45:30.716 --> 01:45:33.836 A:middle
And take something like
RC4 encryption extremely

01:45:33.836 --> 01:45:36.356 A:middle
computationally intensive.

01:45:36.846 --> 01:45:39.596 A:middle
Python gets utterly crushed
in this particular benchmark.

01:45:40.096 --> 01:45:43.156 A:middle
And Objective-- but
look at Swift.

01:45:44.606 --> 01:45:48.156 A:middle
Now Swift is also modern
with features like Closures,

01:45:48.156 --> 01:45:49.506 A:middle
Generics, Type inference,

01:45:49.506 --> 01:45:52.276 A:middle
Multiple return types,
and Namespaces.

what the heck are these
guys talking about?

01:46:13.016 --> 01:46:14.786 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:17.646 A:middle
With Swift you're able to
reduce a common pattern

01:46:17.646 --> 01:46:19.656 A:middle
that you might see in your
Objective-C code like this.

01:46:20.406 --> 01:46:23.546 A:middle
And reduce it to
something as simple as this.

01:46:24.136 --> 01:46:27.676 A:middle
And Swift defines
away large classes

01:46:27.676 --> 01:46:31.256 A:middle
of common programming errors
they just aren't possible.

01:46:32.376 --> 01:46:36.606 A:middle
Now, Swift is completely native
to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

01:46:36.846 --> 01:46:39.626 A:middle
It's built with the
same LLVM compiler

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:43.046 A:middle
as Objective-C using the same
Optimizer and Autovectorizer.

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.726 A:middle
And it has the same ARC
memory management model.

01:46:45.926 --> 01:46:48.346 A:middle
And the same runtime which means

01:46:48.346 --> 01:46:53.036 A:middle
that your Swift code can fit
right alongside your Objective-C

01:46:53.036 --> 01:46:55.596 A:middle
and your C code in
the same application.

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:11.546 A:middle
in development that
we've never seen before

01:47:11.546 --> 01:47:14.036 A:middle
for the feature we
call playgrounds.

01:47:14.516 --> 01:47:17.496 A:middle
To demonstrate Swift and
playgrounds in action,

01:47:17.926 --> 01:47:21.206 A:middle
I'd like to bring to
the stage Chris Lattner.

01:47:21.466 --> 01:47:22.156 A:middle

I am thrilled to be here
and to be the first person

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:34.536 A:middle
to give you a taste of Swift.

01:47:35.856 --> 01:47:36.826 A:middle
Let me show you how fun

01:47:36.826 --> 01:47:39.506 A:middle
and interactive it is
to write Swift code.

01:47:42.936 --> 01:47:44.696 A:middle
This is the Swift playground,

01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:48.266 A:middle
as I start typing I get
an immediately response.

01:47:49.726 --> 01:47:52.136 A:middle
It is actually running
my code as I type it

01:47:52.356 --> 01:47:59.356 A:middle
and displaying the result
in the sidebar to the right.

01:47:59.356 --> 01:48:01.406 A:middle
Of course, Swift
user type inference


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:47:59.356 --> 01:48:01.406 A:middle
Of course, Swift
user type inference

01:48:01.526 --> 01:48:04.066 A:middle
and has powerful string
processing capabilities

01:48:04.516 --> 01:48:06.556 A:middle
which make it as easy to
use as a scripting language

01:48:06.886 --> 01:48:08.926 A:middle
without sacrificing
any performance.

01:48:10.316 --> 01:48:13.156 A:middle
Swift was designed from
the ground up for Cocoa

01:48:13.156 --> 01:48:16.506 A:middle
and Cocoa Touch, so of course
I have their full power

01:48:16.506 --> 01:48:17.616 A:middle
at my fingertips.

01:48:18.246 --> 01:48:20.866 A:middle
Now, I can build
anything with Swift

01:48:21.406 --> 01:48:23.856 A:middle
from a social media
application all the way

01:48:23.856 --> 01:48:26.746 A:middle
up to a high-performance,
3D game using Metal.

01:48:27.836 --> 01:48:29.306 A:middle
But today to keep it simple,

01:48:29.456 --> 01:48:32.916 A:middle
I think I'll write a
simple casual 2D game.

01:48:33.856 --> 01:48:35.556 A:middle
Let's start by using NSImage.

01:48:37.216 --> 01:48:40.406 A:middle
Let's start by using
NSImage to load a resource.

01:48:40.976 --> 01:48:44.086 A:middle
As you can see here, I've--

01:48:45.666 --> 01:48:47.426 A:middle
the playground sees
I've loaded an image,

01:48:47.776 --> 01:48:52.036 A:middle
I can ever see it right
here from within Xcode.

01:48:52.176 --> 01:48:55.546 A:middle
Now, Swift is loaded with
high-end features like Generics

01:48:55.546 --> 01:48:59.366 A:middle
that allow me to get a lot
done with very little code.

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:01.786 A:middle
Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:01.786 A:middle
Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings

01:49:01.786 --> 01:49:05.446 A:middle
and using the functional map
algorithm to apply closure

01:49:05.446 --> 01:49:08.766 A:middle
to every element which allows
me to load an entire list

01:49:08.766 --> 01:49:13.306 A:middle
of images all with the
simple line of code.

01:49:13.506 --> 01:49:15.936 A:middle
Now, all these resources of part
of this game that I'm working on

01:49:16.186 --> 01:49:21.106 A:middle
and one piece I still need to
finish up is the flight path

01:49:21.106 --> 01:49:22.426 A:middle
for the blimp that we have.

01:49:23.946 --> 01:49:26.926 A:middle
Now this is a simple loop
that computes the position

01:49:26.926 --> 01:49:29.176 A:middle
for the blimp overtime
as my game plays.

01:49:30.406 --> 01:49:33.976 A:middle
And in addition to seeing
individual values Swift

01:49:34.466 --> 01:49:37.516 A:middle
playgrounds even allow me to
visualize the entire history

01:49:37.516 --> 01:49:40.526 A:middle
of a value overtime as
my application runs.

01:49:41.046 --> 01:49:42.696 A:middle
And so now I can immediately see

01:49:42.696 --> 01:49:45.916 A:middle
that this equation will
cause my blimp to slowly sink

01:49:45.916 --> 01:49:47.176 A:middle
as the scene plays out.

01:49:48.406 --> 01:49:49.356 A:middle
But I think I can do better

01:49:49.446 --> 01:49:51.116 A:middle
and that's not exactly
what I'm looking for.

01:49:51.516 --> 01:49:55.486 A:middle
So I can change the code and
I get an immediate response.

01:49:56.646 --> 01:49:59.966 A:middle
Simply by changing the equation
the blimp will now rise and fall

01:49:59.966 --> 01:50:02.016 A:middle
as the scene plays out
which is a lot more


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:49:59.966 --> 01:50:02.016 A:middle
as the scene plays out
which is a lot more

01:50:02.016 --> 01:50:02.876 A:middle
of what I'm looking for.

01:50:04.196 --> 01:50:06.386 A:middle
So, now that we have this the
way we want, we can take this

01:50:06.386 --> 01:50:09.666 A:middle
and copy it and let's go to
the game that I'm working on.

01:50:10.606 --> 01:50:11.656 A:middle
It's right here.

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:14.696 A:middle
Now, this is a playground
just like before.

01:50:15.286 --> 01:50:18.996 A:middle
But here, I have a game in the
code written using Sprite Kit.

01:50:19.526 --> 01:50:22.786 A:middle
Now, you can see our blimp
going left and right,

01:50:22.786 --> 01:50:23.976 A:middle
straight across the scene.

01:50:24.676 --> 01:50:25.926 A:middle
And, I can try out
the flight path

01:50:25.926 --> 01:50:28.726 A:middle
that we just developed
simply by pasting it in

01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:31.286 A:middle
and getting the immediate
feedback I'm looking for.

01:50:31.946 --> 01:50:36.426 A:middle
Now, the blimp is rising and
falling just like I wanted.

01:50:37.276 --> 01:50:40.736 A:middle
Because Swift enables
such powerful interactive

01:50:40.736 --> 01:50:43.296 A:middle
and dynamic programming
experiences,

01:50:43.296 --> 01:50:46.586 A:middle
it makes it really easy
to try out new things.

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.596 A:middle
And, just by adding
a few lines of code,

01:50:48.596 --> 01:50:53.736 A:middle
I can enable Sprite Kit's per
pixel collisions, field forces

01:50:53.736 --> 01:50:57.746 A:middle
and lighting effects gaining a
much more interesting result.

01:50:58.796 --> 01:51:02.676 A:middle
Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time.

01:51:02.676 --> 01:51:06.376 A:middle
And, with this timeline at
the bottom of the screen,

01:51:07.136 --> 01:51:09.496 A:middle
I can go forwards and backwards

01:51:09.736 --> 01:51:11.716 A:middle
through the execution
of my game.

01:51:12.366 --> 01:51:14.526 A:middle
So, I can really see
those effects in action.

01:51:15.086 --> 01:51:16.826 A:middle
You can see the balloons
interacting with each other

01:51:17.206 --> 01:51:19.746 A:middle
and with the blimp
just like that.

01:51:20.636 --> 01:51:22.976 A:middle
Playgrounds give me
unprecedented power

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:26.566 A:middle
to see my app in detail and
give me full control when I want

01:51:26.566 --> 01:51:28.406 A:middle
to refine and polish
my application.

01:51:29.726 --> 01:51:32.586 A:middle
But, of course, Swift
works great with Xcode

01:51:32.786 --> 01:51:34.016 A:middle
and runs great on iOS.

01:51:34.566 --> 01:51:37.666 A:middle
So, let's now jump and see what
the finished product looks like.

01:51:43.416 --> 01:51:44.466 A:middle
Here we go.

01:51:45.526 --> 01:51:46.916 A:middle
And, this is the game
that we just built.

01:51:46.916 --> 01:51:49.146 A:middle
It looks pretty great.

01:51:49.776 --> 01:51:52.036 A:middle
Now, as Craig told you earlier,

01:51:52.036 --> 01:51:54.026 A:middle
we've also brought
Scene Kit to iOS.

01:51:54.936 --> 01:51:56.516 A:middle
With Scene Kit, it's super easy

01:51:56.516 --> 01:51:58.766 A:middle
to build a 3D version
of our game.

01:51:58.766 --> 01:52:02.876 A:middle

01:52:18.516 --> 01:52:21.606 A:middle
It gives you access to all
of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

01:52:21.606 --> 01:52:24.256 A:middle
So, you can build everything
from a simple example,

01:52:24.256 --> 01:52:25.686 A:middle
like you saw there with Chris,

01:52:25.686 --> 01:52:29.056 A:middle
to the most powerful
applications you can imagine.

01:52:29.326 --> 01:52:32.456 A:middle
And Swift is going to be ready
for primetime out of the gates.

01:52:32.696 --> 01:52:36.046 A:middle
It comes with complete
Xcode support with indexing,

01:52:36.396 --> 01:52:38.276 A:middle
code completion and debugging.

01:52:38.596 --> 01:52:42.186 A:middle

And, when iOS and OS X
are available, day one,

01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:54.396 A:middle
you can submit apps written

iOS 8 is a huge developer

unprecedented developer release

01:53:30.246 --> 01:53:34.696 A:middle
with technology like
extensions, Metal and Swift.

01:53:36.096 --> 01:53:37.546 A:middle
That's iOS 8.

01:53:37.806 --> 01:53:41.976 A:middle
It's going to be available to
those of you here in Beta today.

01:53:50.286 --> 01:53:53.676 A:middle
And, you guessed it, available
to everyone else in the fall

01:53:54.606 --> 01:53:56.996 A:middle
and it will run on
all of these devices.

01:53:57.476 --> 01:53:58.546 A:middle
That is iOS 8.

01:53:58.546 --> 01:53:59.646 A:middle

and an incredible release.

01:54:16.046 --> 01:54:17.166 A:middle
It's been a fun morning.

01:54:17.166 --> 01:54:18.356 A:middle
You can probably
see that from us.

01:54:18.356 --> 01:54:19.976 A:middle

This morning, you've seen
Yosemite, the future of OS X

01:54:30.456 --> 01:54:35.036 A:middle
with an incredible new
design, amazing new features

01:54:35.606 --> 01:54:38.366 A:middle
and engineered to work
seamlessly with iOS.

01:54:39.496 --> 01:54:44.016 A:middle
You've seen iOS 8, the
biggest release of iOS

01:54:44.586 --> 01:54:47.086 A:middle
since the introduction
of the App Store.

01:54:47.486 --> 01:54:52.146 A:middle
It's huge for developers and
massive for everyone else.

01:54:52.736 --> 01:54:54.976 A:middle
And perhaps, more importantly,

01:54:55.586 --> 01:55:00.256 A:middle

you've seen how our
operating systems, devices

01:55:00.256 --> 01:55:03.936 A:middle

together in harmony.

01:55:04.546 --> 01:55:08.656 A:middle

01:55:15.356 --> 01:55:19.796 A:middle
And, you've seen how developers
can extend their experience

01:55:19.966 --> 01:55:21.956 A:middle
further than they've
ever done before

01:55:23.026 --> 01:55:27.666 A:middle
and how they can create powerful
apps even faster and more easily

01:55:28.266 --> 01:55:30.396 A:middle
than they've ever been able to.

01:55:33.246 --> 01:55:41.506 A:middle

01:55:42.156 --> 01:55:47.716 A:middle
we do this so we can
create a seamless experience

01:55:47.756 --> 01:55:53.686 A:middle

You've seen a few people
on stage this morning

but there are thousands of
people that made today possible.

01:56:12.696 --> 01:56:15.406 A:middle
And I'd like to take a
moment before we depart

01:56:15.506 --> 01:56:16.856 A:middle
and recognize them.

01:56:17.116 --> 01:56:21.266 A:middle
Would everyone from Apple stand
up that had something to do

01:56:21.266 --> 01:56:23.826 A:middle
with bringing today--
making today possible?

01:56:24.596 --> 01:56:25.976 A:middle
