00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:13.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.596 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:15.746 A:middle
Welcome to this morning's
session.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.036 A:middle
My name is Mark Miller.

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.926 A:middle
I'm an iTunes Engineering
Manager on the store,

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:21.826 A:middle
and we're going to
be talking about

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:25.776 A:middle
"Affiliate Tools
for App Developers."

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.686 A:middle
Now, just in case anybody is new
to the program, or unfamiliar

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:33.476 A:middle
with what it's for, we're going
to go over a quick overview

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.036 A:middle
of how it works,
what its purpose is

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.156 A:middle
and how you can use it.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:41.236 A:middle
It's also been a couple years
since we've last presented here,

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.066 A:middle
so we'll talk about
what's new in the program

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.406 A:middle
and what new things
you can do with it.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:50.256 A:middle
And finally, there's going
to be a deep dive on tools

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:57.676 A:middle
and services that you can use
to interact with the program.

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.096 A:middle
So first off, we kind of
need a cast of characters.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.096 A:middle
So first off, we kind of
need a cast of characters.

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.646 A:middle
Who's involved with
the affiliate program

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.306 A:middle
and how do they interact
with each other?

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.906 A:middle
As you might guess, they
are the customer, yours,

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:12.726 A:middle
and the iTunes Stores, and they
are talking to you and talking

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:15.216 A:middle
to the iTunes Store,
but what might not be

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:19.956 A:middle
so obvious is behind the scenes,
there's an affiliate network.

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:23.186 A:middle
And the affiliate network
mediates the interaction

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:26.026 A:middle
between you and the store.

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:29.006 A:middle
And the affiliate network
is where you go to sign up,

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:35.036 A:middle
set up payments, manage and
track your campaign performance

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:39.266 A:middle
and go to check on any
support issues you have.

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:44.126 A:middle
So what's it for?

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.976 A:middle
The key thing that
you're trying to do

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:51.006 A:middle
with the affiliate program
is to drive customers

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.386 A:middle
to your apps and other content.

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:55.196 A:middle
So you might have a game,

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.866 A:middle
and perhaps you've
released a sequel to it.

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.726 A:middle
You want to promote
that app, and you can do


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.726 A:middle
You want to promote
that app, and you can do

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.116 A:middle
that using the affiliate
program.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.376 A:middle
Similarly, you might
already have a website used

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.636 A:middle
to promote your apps, and
you can affiliate those links

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.306 A:middle
and start getting the benefits

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:11.296 A:middle
of the affiliate
program that way.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:16.026 A:middle
But it doesn't have to be your
own apps that you're promoting.

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:19.416 A:middle
You can promote other
app developers' apps

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:22.296 A:middle
and other content, and this is
pretty much all of the content

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.386 A:middle
on the Music Store -
excuse me, on the store.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:30.026 A:middle
So that's music, movies,
TV shows, books, podcasts,

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:34.326 A:middle
anything you can think of
is supported by the program.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:41.406 A:middle
And the Use Case here is
- there's pretty much -

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:46.666 A:middle
there's a wide Use Case for
what you can do with it.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:50.626 A:middle
You might have a soundtrack
that's related to your game,

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.696 A:middle
and you can promote that.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:55.926 A:middle
Or if you're a productivity
app, and there's a similar app

00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:00.396 A:middle
that works well with it,
you can promote that from


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:00.396 A:middle
that works well with it,
you can promote that from

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
within the app or
on your website.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:07.496 A:middle
Most of all, you are trying to
connect your users with content

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.026 A:middle
that they're going
to want to download.

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.326 A:middle
They're - you're interrupting
their workflow a little bit

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.806 A:middle
to send them to the store,
so make sure it counts.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.486 A:middle
Make sure that link is relevant
to what they're interested in

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:23.986 A:middle
and something that they're
going to want to buy.

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:28.206 A:middle
Now, the key to the
program is that all

00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.796 A:middle
of your links need a
little bit of data on them

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.416 A:middle
to function correctly.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:35.266 A:middle
So you add a bit
of affiliate data

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:38.446 A:middle
to an existing iTunes
Store link, and that's it.

00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:39.996 A:middle
You're ready to go with
the affiliate program.

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:45.066 A:middle
In return for marketing
and promoting the iTunes

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
and App Stores, you
earn a commission

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
on sales generated
from that referral.

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.806 A:middle
For you, you get the benefit
of tracking the effectiveness

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.596 A:middle
of your marketing
with our tools.

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:03.886 A:middle
And best of all, this works
on both web and in your app,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:03.886 A:middle
And best of all, this works
on both web and in your app,

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:07.076 A:middle
so there's no reason
to limit the usage

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.886 A:middle
of the affiliate
program to the web.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:10.976 A:middle
You can also do it
within your app.

00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:23.376 A:middle
Now, under the covers, those
links are going to be clicked on

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:26.506 A:middle
or tapped on in iOS, and the
data from the URL is going

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.606 A:middle
to be copied into a cookie,
and that cookie lives

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:31.876 A:middle
for 24 hours on the
user's device.

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.236 A:middle
And it's important
that you realize

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:35.866 A:middle
that the data is
tracking the cookie

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:37.366 A:middle
and not somewhere on the server.

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:41.276 A:middle
This means that if the user
clicks on one of your links

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.536 A:middle
and then moves to
her iPhone or iPad

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:50.296 A:middle
to continue browsing the
store, that any purchase made

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.476 A:middle
on the device will
not credit to you.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:59.356 A:middle
So it's the same device that the
tap happens on and the purchase.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.576 A:middle
Now, once the purchase
happens, the data is copied


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.576 A:middle
Now, once the purchase
happens, the data is copied

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:07.716 A:middle
into the database and
the database is synced

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:13.486 A:middle
to the affiliate network,
and that's how you get paid.

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.356 A:middle
Now the terms are really great.

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:19.086 A:middle
You earn 7 percent
commission on all sales.

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:22.666 A:middle
That means that if you link
to, for example, an app,

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.786 A:middle
and the user winds up buying
another app, you get credited.

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:30.306 A:middle
If the user actually leaves
the App Store and goes

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.196 A:middle
to buy something on the Music
Store, you also get credited.

00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:36.776 A:middle
And it's 7 percent for
all sales within 24 hours.

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:40.606 A:middle
Now this is kind of important.

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:44.136 A:middle
It's a case of last one wins.

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:47.876 A:middle
You are operating in
an ecosystem of a lot

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:51.966 A:middle
of other developers, and it's
whoever is the most recent

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.786 A:middle
referral gets the
credit for the sale.

00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:57.596 A:middle
So if some - if a
user taps on your link

00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.486 A:middle
and then three hours
later taps on another link


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.486 A:middle
and then three hours
later taps on another link

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:04.336 A:middle
from another affiliate,
that affiliate gets credited

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.826 A:middle
for the next 24 hours'
worth of sales.

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:11.916 A:middle
Now best of all, this
is a seamless experience

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.586 A:middle
from the point of
view of your users.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:16.906 A:middle
An affiliate link
looks and acts just

00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.336 A:middle
like a regular iTunes
Store link.

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.986 A:middle
So here, we've got an
example of "Cut the Rope,"

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:25.376 A:middle
and they're promoting the sequel
to their app, "Cut the Rope 2."

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:29.406 A:middle
So when the user taps on Get
it Now, an affiliate link,

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:32.986 A:middle
everything acts just
as you expect.

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:37.476 A:middle
The store carousels in,
and they can preview, buy,

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:38.846 A:middle
look at reviews, look

00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:40.496 A:middle
at screenshots and
browse the store.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:44.966 A:middle
And again, after they've
clicked this, it's not just apps

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:46.936 A:middle
that are credited
to that affiliate.

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:49.976 A:middle
It's music, movies,
TV shows, all of it.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:56.156 A:middle
So that's the affiliate
program in a nutshell.

00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
Let's talk about what's happened
in the past couple years.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
Let's talk about what's happened
in the past couple years.

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:05.006 A:middle
Most importantly, we have had
a massive territory expansion.

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.626 A:middle
This was the state of the world,

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:09.566 A:middle
or at least the affiliate
world in 2012.

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.396 A:middle
We were on three continents,

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:15.186 A:middle
and we had program
support in 45 countries.

00:07:16.386 --> 00:07:23.276 A:middle
Since then, we have
introduced the affiliate program

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.586 A:middle
to 147 countries.

00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:28.246 A:middle
That's a 3X expansion, and 50

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.686 A:middle
of those countries
happened in 2014 alone.

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.296 A:middle
Now, that's pretty great.

00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:42.346 A:middle
You're promoting your apps
and other content worldwide

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:46.506 A:middle
with the affiliate
program, but best of all,

00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:51.736 A:middle
you only need one network
to work in the entire world.

00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:54.336 A:middle
If you're familiar with the
program from a couple years ago,

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:58.666 A:middle
you had to sign up with one
program to work in the Americas,

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.756 A:middle
a second program to work in
Europe, and a third program


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.756 A:middle
a second program to work in
Europe, and a third program

00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:04.196 A:middle
to work in Australia
and New Zealand.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:08.036 A:middle
Nowadays, one network
gets you worldwide access

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.886 A:middle
to 147 countries.

00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:11.026 A:middle
This is really huge.

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
Now that means one sign
up, one payment set up,

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.766 A:middle
all your tax information,
all that sort

00:08:22.766 --> 00:08:25.866 A:middle
of financial transaction stuff
that you need to get started

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:27.706 A:middle
with the program,
you do that once

00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:30.126 A:middle
and you're working
across the globe.

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:35.686 A:middle
Even better, we have a
common link structure

00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:36.796 A:middle
for the entire world.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:41.515 A:middle
Now this is what a normal,

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:43.546 A:middle
unaffiliated iTunes
Store link looks like.

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:46.656 A:middle
You can see that it's
in the U.S. storefront.

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.216 A:middle
It's an app called "iMovie"

00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:51.176 A:middle
and there's the iTunes
Store content ID at the end.

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:55.016 A:middle
It used to be that if you
wanted to add affiliate data

00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:56.966 A:middle
to this URL, you would
end up with something

00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:59.936 A:middle
like these two options,
and you would have to do it

00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.526 A:middle
in a region specific manner.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.526 A:middle
in a region specific manner.

00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:04.436 A:middle
So the URL on top
was for the Americas.

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.466 A:middle
The URL on the bottom
was for Europe.

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:09.266 A:middle
These URL's are messy.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:10.616 A:middle
They're confusing.

00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:12.116 A:middle
They're even suspicious.

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:16.486 A:middle
If a user were to
look at the link

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:17.796 A:middle
that you're calling
an iTunes link

00:09:18.076 --> 00:09:21.106 A:middle
and examine it a little more
closely, they would say, "Oh,

00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:23.446 A:middle
I'm, this is, I'm not sure
what I'm clicking on anymore."

00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:24.896 A:middle
They might be turned
away by that.

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:28.306 A:middle
So no more of that.

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:32.916 A:middle
Nowadays, we take an
existing store link

00:09:33.276 --> 00:09:34.936 A:middle
and we add just a
small bit of data

00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:37.666 A:middle
and the host is still the
same: iTunes.apple.com.

00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:40.686 A:middle
So what we're adding here

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:45.906 A:middle
to the base URL is a small
bit of affiliate data.

00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:49.716 A:middle
The first part of that is
the AT Query parameter.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.416 A:middle
This stands for affiliate token,

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:54.876 A:middle
and the value is
essentially your user ID

00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:56.156 A:middle
within the affiliate program.

00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:00.796 A:middle
This is how we identify you,
and this is how you get credited


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:00.796 A:middle
This is how we identify you,
and this is how you get credited

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.366 A:middle
for purchases made after
a user taps on your link.

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.966 A:middle
So it's very important
to get this one right.

00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:10.046 A:middle
Also, in the affiliate data,
is the CT Query parameter,

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.266 A:middle
and CT stands for
campaign token.

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:15.326 A:middle
And this is an optional query
parameter so you don't have

00:10:15.326 --> 00:10:17.646 A:middle
to put it on, but
you can do a lot

00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:19.356 A:middle
of really important
things with it.

00:10:19.766 --> 00:10:23.066 A:middle
If you have a campaign that
you want to track separately

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:24.526 A:middle
from the rest of your
marketing efforts,

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.806 A:middle
you can use this
campaign, and it will show

00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:29.016 A:middle
up differently in our UIs.

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.516 A:middle
So for example, you might have
a campaign for your website.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.896 A:middle
You might have a campaign,
a separate campaign

00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:39.026 A:middle
for the interior
pages of your website.

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:40.016 A:middle
You could have campaigns

00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:42.056 A:middle
for each email blast
that you send out.

00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:44.276 A:middle
If you're doing online
advertising

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.296 A:middle
and you're buying keywords,

00:10:45.536 --> 00:10:47.436 A:middle
you can have a campaign
for each of those.

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:51.486 A:middle
You could have campaigns
for links within your apps.

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:55.546 A:middle
You can do a lot of analysis
to find out what works

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:57.746 A:middle
and what doesn't with
your marketing efforts.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.916 A:middle
Now it's important to note
one thing about these URLs.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.916 A:middle
Now it's important to note
one thing about these URLs.

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:06.096 A:middle
I said that there's one
link structure worldwide,

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:11.046 A:middle
but content is not necessarily
available around the world.

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.866 A:middle
The situation for
apps is pretty easy.

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:16.096 A:middle
Most apps are available
in every country.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:19.356 A:middle
But if you're linking to
music or movies or books,

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:23.326 A:middle
the rights may not carry over
from one storefront to another,

00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:25.416 A:middle
so you need to, if you're
trying to send your user

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:28.786 A:middle
to a particular piece of
content, it's best to check

00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:31.566 A:middle
if it's available in their
storefront before you present

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.976 A:middle
them with that link.

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:39.256 A:middle
Another common mistake that
you make when first interacting

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:42.146 A:middle
with the program is getting
your query strings wrong.

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:47.766 A:middle
The URLs are fairly simple,
but there's a few gotcha's

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:48.766 A:middle
that you need to avoid.

00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:52.936 A:middle
The first thing to make
sure of is to identify

00:11:52.936 --> 00:11:55.056 A:middle
if there's already
query string on the URL.

00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:57.046 A:middle
Now the query string, the start

00:11:57.046 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
of the query string is
identified by the question mark,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.046 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
of the query string is
identified by the question mark,

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
and if there's no question mark,

00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:05.266 A:middle
and you blindly append your
affiliate data using ampersand,

00:12:05.696 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
that URL probably won't
even load for your user.

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:11.056 A:middle
They're just going to have
an error, so don't do that.

00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:13.696 A:middle
What you want to do is
check for the question mark,

00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:17.566 A:middle
and if it's not present on the
string, add the question mark

00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:19.136 A:middle
and then your affiliate data.

00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
Now the reverse is
also a gotcha,

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:23.886 A:middle
and this is just as important.

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:27.726 A:middle
If there's already a
question mark in the URL,

00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:29.976 A:middle
that means that there's
an existing query string.

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:33.296 A:middle
You need to use the ampersand
as a delimiter instead

00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:34.556 A:middle
of using another question mark.

00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:37.776 A:middle
If you click on - if
a user clicks on a URL

00:12:37.776 --> 00:12:39.516 A:middle
with two question marks
in it, it's not going

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:41.066 A:middle
to parse correctly
and you're not going

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:44.066 A:middle
to be credited with
the referral.

00:12:44.686 --> 00:12:48.186 A:middle
So the key thing is look
for the question mark,

00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:50.236 A:middle
and if it's already
there, use ampersand

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.976 A:middle
to attach your affiliate data.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.126 --> 00:13:02.166 A:middle
Now I mentioned one network.

00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:06.036 A:middle
One of the key benefits of
having one network worldwide is

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:09.236 A:middle
that you can have a
global unified view

00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:12.016 A:middle
of how your marketing is going.

00:13:12.796 --> 00:13:15.006 A:middle
Now this is a dashboard
that shows you

00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:18.286 A:middle
in real time who's
clicking and what,

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:21.086 A:middle
what links they're clicking on
- excuse me, not who's clicking

00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:23.216 A:middle
but the type of links
that they're clicking on.

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:27.416 A:middle
So the first thing you'll
notice about this UI is

00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:31.536 A:middle
that you can track clicks
over time and you can zoom

00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:35.846 A:middle
in from a year's worth of data
all the way down to a day.

00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:40.256 A:middle
And again, these graphs are
updating in near real time.

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:44.346 A:middle
So in this case, we're looking
at the month-over-month view,

00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:47.156 A:middle
and our current month
is plotted in orange

00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:49.776 A:middle
against the previous
months' performance.

00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:52.626 A:middle
So you can see if your
graph is trending down

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:57.226 A:middle
or if it's different
compared month over month,

00:13:57.486 --> 00:13:59.926 A:middle
and adjust your marketing
campaign accordingly.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.846 A:middle
Also of note is that the
conversion rate is mentioned

00:14:04.846 --> 00:14:09.426 A:middle
here, and you should pay
close attention to this value.

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:12.266 A:middle
If the conversion
rate starts diving,

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:16.256 A:middle
that might represent a problem
with your marketing efforts.

00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:22.196 A:middle
Maybe your URLs are not really
exciting users into buying,

00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:24.276 A:middle
or maybe there's a
problem with your links

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.226 A:middle
and something needs
investigating.

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:27.766 A:middle
So keep an eye on that one.

00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:32.966 A:middle
Also on the global
dashboard, you can zoom in

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.826 A:middle
and get a per country
view of things.

00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:41.176 A:middle
The - if you're operating
in more than one country,

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:44.776 A:middle
you can see how well you're
doing in the U.S. as opposed

00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:48.006 A:middle
to the UK, or in South
America or wherever.

00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:53.416 A:middle
Also, if you are promoting
more than one type of content -

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:57.016 A:middle
so for example, apps and
books or movies and music -

00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:00.996 A:middle
you can slice and dice and
get reports on how each one


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:00.996 A:middle
you can slice and dice and
get reports on how each one

00:15:00.996 --> 00:15:01.856 A:middle
of those is performing.

00:15:02.886 --> 00:15:04.806 A:middle
So there's a lot
of rich data here.

00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:09.606 A:middle
And furthermore, there's
more utility up at the top.

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:14.006 A:middle
You can see additional tools for
interacting with the program.

00:15:14.406 --> 00:15:17.446 A:middle
You can get more in-depth
reports of what's going on.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:21.356 A:middle
You can manage your
payments and other settings.

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:24.086 A:middle
So make sure to check out all
the options that this provides

00:15:24.086 --> 00:15:27.226 A:middle
because it's a great way to
actually see how you're doing

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.186 A:middle
with your marketing efforts.

00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:32.876 A:middle
So that's the Global Dashboard.

00:15:32.996 --> 00:15:35.556 A:middle
It's a single, unified view

00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:40.106 A:middle
of a single network that's
operating in 147 countries.

00:15:40.276 --> 00:15:42.206 A:middle
I can't tell you how
excited I am about the fact

00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:44.796 A:middle
that we have one network that
lets you operate worldwide.

00:15:45.036 --> 00:15:48.556 A:middle
It's a huge simplification
of what we used to have

00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:50.216 A:middle
to do, so very exciting.

00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:55.076 A:middle
Hopefully, at this point
you are similarly excited.

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:56.506 A:middle
You want to - you're
ready to go.

00:15:56.696 --> 00:16:00.016 A:middle
Go sign up with your program,
and you want to know how next


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.696 --> 00:16:00.016 A:middle
Go sign up with your program,
and you want to know how next

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:03.976 A:middle
to - what the next steps
are in terms of integrating.

00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:08.516 A:middle
So for that, we've got a
Tools and Services section.

00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:12.656 A:middle
We're going to start
talking about simple tools

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.766 A:middle
to get you started quickly.

00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:17.056 A:middle
These are things that you don't
need a computer science degree

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.196 A:middle
to work with.

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:21.846 A:middle
It's maybe just a matter
of creating a couple links

00:16:21.846 --> 00:16:23.936 A:middle
and adding them to an
email or to your website

00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:25.666 A:middle
or somewhere in your app.

00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:28.406 A:middle
These tools are really
great for the one-offs,

00:16:28.616 --> 00:16:29.806 A:middle
the manual sort of set up.

00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:32.566 A:middle
There's also more
advanced tools.

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:38.236 A:middle
So if you want to find what's
going on really in the now

00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:41.406 A:middle
on the store, and promote
that sort of content,

00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:42.706 A:middle
these tools will
let you do that.

00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:45.816 A:middle
We also provide Smart
App Banners.

00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:49.416 A:middle
Smart App Banners allow
you to promote your app

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:52.936 A:middle
from your websites in
a very seamless way.

00:16:53.056 --> 00:16:56.006 A:middle
There's a lot of power there,
and in the right situation,

00:16:56.156 --> 00:16:57.506 A:middle
can be very, very useful.

00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:00.366 A:middle
The StoreKit Product Sheet


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:00.366 A:middle
The StoreKit Product Sheet

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:03.666 A:middle
and iTunes Radio have been
recently added to the program,

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:06.276 A:middle
and we'll talk about how
to work with those and how

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.955 A:middle
to get the most out of that.

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:11.866 A:middle
And finally, we'll finish
with the Collection feature

00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:16.715 A:middle
that allows you to define
dynamic playlists for the store.

00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:18.556 A:middle
This can be really useful

00:17:18.965 --> 00:17:22.086 A:middle
for customizing content
for your users.

00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:26.586 A:middle
Let's get started
with the simple stuff.

00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.496 A:middle
The simplest of all
is Link Maker.

00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:35.346 A:middle
This is a simple search
box where you can come in

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:40.176 A:middle
and type a search term,
get results and get links.

00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:43.196 A:middle
Especially if you
click into Link Maker

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:47.506 A:middle
from within the affiliate
network, your URL that you come

00:17:47.506 --> 00:17:49.296 A:middle
in with is going to have
all your affiliate data

00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:51.336 A:middle
pre-populated so you
don't need to worry

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:54.266 A:middle
about adding the affiliate
data to the URL itself.

00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:57.136 A:middle
You don't need to worry
about question marks

00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:58.686 A:middle
and ampersands and
URL encodings.

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
It's all dramatically easier.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
It's all dramatically easier.

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:04.986 A:middle
So in this case, we're going
to do a search for Ed Sheeran.

00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:09.456 A:middle
He's a UK singer/songwriter with
a lot of awesome great songs,

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:13.746 A:middle
and we can see that his
albums are available

00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:18.086 A:middle
in the research results,
and by tapping on one

00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:23.416 A:middle
of these search results, we
get a nice pop up of HTML

00:18:23.416 --> 00:18:25.976 A:middle
that we can drop
right into a web page.

00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:29.956 A:middle
Not only that, this
HTML has a number

00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:31.436 A:middle
of different options
for the formatting.

00:18:31.686 --> 00:18:34.296 A:middle
So this is the small
format for the Badge.

00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:38.626 A:middle
If you prefer a large Badge,
we've got HTML to do that.

00:18:39.496 --> 00:18:42.256 A:middle
Similarly, if you just want
to have a raw text link,

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:46.036 A:middle
maybe this is for an HTML email
blast or something like that,

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:50.426 A:middle
you've got the raw text
available, as well.

00:18:50.426 --> 00:18:52.766 A:middle
So that's Link Maker
in a nutshell.

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.296 A:middle
It's simple.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:55.726 A:middle
It's all UI oriented.

00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:58.676 A:middle
It's a bit of HTML
that you can drop in.

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.946 A:middle
It's a great way if you haven't
started and you only want -


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.946 A:middle
It's a great way if you haven't
started and you only want -

00:19:00.946 --> 00:19:04.076 A:middle
interested in linking to a few
pieces of content, to find that.

00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:09.286 A:middle
But maybe you've already got
a website up and running,

00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:12.276 A:middle
and you've got a
couple hundred links

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:13.996 A:middle
to various pieces
of iTunes content.

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:18.746 A:middle
In that case, you might be
interested in Auto Link Maker.

00:19:19.816 --> 00:19:25.926 A:middle
Auto Link Maker is a way to on
the fly, attach affiliate data

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:28.506 A:middle
to existing iTunes
links within a webpage.

00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:31.796 A:middle
It's a small bit of JavaScripts
that you paste into your page,

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:36.196 A:middle
and on load, it actually
finds all of the links

00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:38.916 A:middle
to the iTunes Store, and
when they're clicked,

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:43.526 A:middle
the Event Handler attaches
affiliate data to the URL,

00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:45.426 A:middle
and you get credit for the links

00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:47.546 A:middle
that you're already
sending to the page.

00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:51.106 A:middle
So if you don't want to go in
and edit hundreds or thousands

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:55.146 A:middle
of pages in your content
website to, you know,

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.656 A:middle
annotate all these links
with affiliate data,

00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:57.976 A:middle
Auto Link Maker can
really help you out there.

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:06.306 A:middle
So that's the simple
stuff that you can do.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:06.306 A:middle
So that's the simple
stuff that you can do.

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:09.006 A:middle
You might be more interested
in the advanced stuff

00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:12.056 A:middle
for finding content,
and for that,

00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:15.626 A:middle
one of the best tools are
the Search and Lookup APIs.

00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:22.556 A:middle
And this provides metadata
access on the web, up to date,

00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:28.136 A:middle
and very, very easy to do so.

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.746 A:middle
There are two main actions.

00:20:32.376 --> 00:20:33.866 A:middle
The first is Search.

00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:35.566 A:middle
This is probably
like you expect.

00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:37.376 A:middle
You can find content by name.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:39.566 A:middle
If you know the artist
name or the song name,

00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.186 A:middle
or your user wants
to type something in

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.876 A:middle
and find specific
pieces of content,

00:20:43.246 --> 00:20:44.456 A:middle
you can do that with
the Search API.

00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:50.636 A:middle
The Lookup API allows you
to cross-reference your IDs

00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:52.156 A:middle
with the iTunes Store.

00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:54.086 A:middle
So you might have
a set of content

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.016 A:middle
that you're interested in,

00:20:55.016 --> 00:20:56.866 A:middle
and you know the iTunes
Store content IDs,

00:20:56.866 --> 00:20:58.746 A:middle
you can get the latest data

00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:01.916 A:middle
about that content
using the Lookup API.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:01.916 A:middle
about that content
using the Lookup API.

00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:05.006 A:middle
And all these responses
are in the JSON format.

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.876 A:middle
That's JavaScript
object notation.

00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:09.396 A:middle
It's pretty much
the lingua franca

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:11.776 A:middle
for data transfer on the web.

00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:15.386 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the search API.

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:18.866 A:middle
The only thing that's
required to get started

00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:21.376 A:middle
with the search API is
the term Query Parameter,

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.046 A:middle
and this of course,
is the search term

00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:23.946 A:middle
that you're interested in.

00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:27.726 A:middle
But there's a lot of
modifiers available,

00:21:27.726 --> 00:21:29.206 A:middle
and you could do some
really interesting stuff

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.876 A:middle
to find specific
pieces of content.

00:21:33.096 --> 00:21:35.776 A:middle
You can also change the nature
of the content that comes back.

00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:39.056 A:middle
So the Language Query
Parameter allows you

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:43.396 A:middle
to specify the localization
of the response.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.726 A:middle
So let's say you're searching in
Canada for a piece of content,

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:48.996 A:middle
but you know you want to
localize it to French.

00:21:49.216 --> 00:21:51.016 A:middle
You can pass in Language
equals FR

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:54.596 A:middle
and get a result back in French.

00:21:54.716 --> 00:21:57.716 A:middle
Media is a constraint
for the search itself.

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:01.026 A:middle
If you only are interested
in movies or only interested


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:01.026 A:middle
If you only are interested
in movies or only interested

00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:03.946 A:middle
in books, you can specify
Media equals Movies

00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:06.466 A:middle
or Media equals Books and
get content back that way.

00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:11.586 A:middle
But what if you're actually
just interested not just in say,

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.506 A:middle
music, but you're
interested in songs,

00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:16.556 A:middle
or you're interested
specifically in albums.

00:22:16.896 --> 00:22:18.776 A:middle
You can use the Entity
Query Parameter

00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:22.626 A:middle
to specify a very
specific piece of content

00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:27.676 A:middle
or collection of
content that way.

00:22:28.406 --> 00:22:31.046 A:middle
Attribute is another
query parameter

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:34.436 A:middle
that focuses the search
term on a specific case.

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:38.866 A:middle
So the search will only be
applied to a specific portion

00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:42.246 A:middle
of the content, and this would
allow you to, for example,

00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:46.176 A:middle
if your query is for
Madonna, you might be looking

00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:48.126 A:middle
for the musician Madonna,

00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.976 A:middle
and you could use Attribute
equals Artist's name

00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:52.596 A:middle
and the searches would only be

00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:54.826 A:middle
for artists whose
name contains Madonna.

00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:56.666 A:middle
On the other hand,
maybe you're looking

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.976 A:middle
for the Beatles' popular
song "Lady Madonna."

00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:01.906 A:middle
You can specify Attribute
equals Song term


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:01.906 A:middle
You can specify Attribute
equals Song term

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:05.026 A:middle
and get song results back.

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:10.656 A:middle
The Limit Query Parameter is
another one where it can come

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:13.216 A:middle
in handy in many situations.

00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:15.906 A:middle
By default, you're going
to get 50 results back

00:23:16.586 --> 00:23:21.046 A:middle
for a given query, but
if you only want five,

00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:23.866 A:middle
there's no reason to spend time
parsing the results and waiting

00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:25.956 A:middle
for the response for
a larger data set.

00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:29.076 A:middle
So you can either decrease
or increase the size

00:23:29.076 --> 00:23:30.266 A:middle
of the response set you get.

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:32.726 A:middle
And finally, there's Callback.

00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:38.376 A:middle
Callback is very useful for web
developers if you are trying

00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:42.306 A:middle
to do something that operates
within the Java excuse me,

00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:43.746 A:middle
the browser security model.

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.136 A:middle
So if you're running
JavaScript in a browser,

00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:50.206 A:middle
you may not have access to make
a call to iTunes.apple.com.

00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.636 A:middle
But you can use the
Callback Query parameter

00:23:52.886 --> 00:23:59.256 A:middle
to essentially call a function
with the result of the query.

00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
This can be very useful,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
This can be very useful,

00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:04.786 A:middle
and just about every
JavaScript library like J Query,

00:24:04.786 --> 00:24:06.966 A:middle
what have you, supports
Callback.

00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:11.296 A:middle
And all these responses,
once when you do a query,

00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:16.626 A:middle
all the results are in the JSON
format, and they're dictionaries

00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:18.926 A:middle
of content sorted by relevancy.

00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:21.226 A:middle
And relevancy is an
important concept.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:24.866 A:middle
It's not - it's our best guess

00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:27.246 A:middle
at what you're actually
searching for.

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:30.126 A:middle
So it depends on how
appropriate is the content

00:24:30.176 --> 00:24:31.166 A:middle
to the search term.

00:24:31.296 --> 00:24:33.546 A:middle
And it also depends on other
factors like popularity.

00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:37.766 A:middle
So that can be - so your
search queries are not

00:24:37.766 --> 00:24:38.906 A:middle
necessarily static.

00:24:38.906 --> 00:24:40.216 A:middle
They're not going
to be set in time.

00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:42.556 A:middle
If another piece of content
becomes more popular,

00:24:42.886 --> 00:24:45.586 A:middle
it might move from rank number
three to rank number one,

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.686 A:middle
and your search results will
change even though the query

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:48.476 A:middle
parameter is the same.

00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:57.006 A:middle
Now the Lookup API uses a lot
of similar query parameters

00:24:57.006 --> 00:25:00.246 A:middle
to the Search API, but the
only thing required is an ID,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.006 --> 00:25:00.246 A:middle
to the Search API, but the
only thing required is an ID,

00:25:00.656 --> 00:25:04.506 A:middle
and the ID can be an
iTunes Store content ID,

00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:08.296 A:middle
or it can be a list, comma
separated, of those same IDs.

00:25:08.936 --> 00:25:13.106 A:middle
The Lookup API also supports
other identifier standards.

00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:19.676 A:middle
So if you have UPCs for albums,
or ISBNs for books, or ISRCs,

00:25:19.676 --> 00:25:24.786 A:middle
or any number of other
standard ID schemes,

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:26.376 A:middle
you can pass those in as well.

00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:35.746 A:middle
So we support similar
modifiers to the search API.

00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:37.636 A:middle
Language is a - as
you would expect,

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:39.736 A:middle
Callback is as you would expect.

00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:42.226 A:middle
The results are the exact
same content dictionaries,

00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:45.026 A:middle
and you can pass them into
some function you define

00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:45.646 A:middle
in JavaScript.

00:25:47.496 --> 00:25:51.386 A:middle
Entity is slightly
different in the Lookup API.

00:25:51.386 --> 00:25:54.386 A:middle
So you're passing in
one or more content IDs,

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:58.046 A:middle
and you can use the Entity
ID to actually navigate up

00:25:58.046 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
or down the content tree.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.046 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
or down the content tree.

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:04.516 A:middle
We'll go into how you
can use this in a bit.

00:26:04.516 --> 00:26:06.756 A:middle
And again, the results
are JSON dictionaries,

00:26:07.056 --> 00:26:09.846 A:middle
so it's the exact same content
whether you're using Search API

00:26:09.846 --> 00:26:11.056 A:middle
or Lookup API.

00:26:11.906 --> 00:26:16.996 A:middle
And the responses you get back
are very, very rich in data.

00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:20.656 A:middle
Now I know this is a wall
of text, but there's a lot

00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:24.846 A:middle
of information here that you
can use to populate your UIs

00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:28.746 A:middle
or to populate your
recommendations.

00:26:29.096 --> 00:26:30.406 A:middle
There's the expected.

00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:34.076 A:middle
You can get the artist ID, the
artist name, the album name,

00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:35.966 A:middle
the song name, app
name, what have you.

00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:38.476 A:middle
But there's also
you can get the -

00:26:38.476 --> 00:26:40.146 A:middle
what's the most recent
version on the store?

00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:42.016 A:middle
What are the release
notes for that version?

00:26:42.016 --> 00:26:44.146 A:middle
When was it released?

00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:45.136 A:middle
How much is it?

00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:46.776 A:middle
What's the file size?

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:49.766 A:middle
Maybe you only want to recommend
small files to your users

00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:52.266 A:middle
on some sort of constrained
device.

00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:56.726 A:middle
You can see screenshots,
album artwork.

00:26:56.996 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
What is the user rating for
this particular content?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.996 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
What is the user rating for
this particular content?

00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:02.136 A:middle
What is the age rating
for the content?

00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:07.996 A:middle
All this can really be useful if
you're trying to populate a UI.

00:27:08.236 --> 00:27:10.326 A:middle
So that said, let's go
through a couple examples.

00:27:10.826 --> 00:27:15.976 A:middle
Let's say we are developing
a music app and we want

00:27:16.036 --> 00:27:18.436 A:middle
to show the user a search API

00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:20.646 A:middle
so that they can find
content on the store.

00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:26.046 A:middle
So we might have a search box
that they can type something in,

00:27:26.376 --> 00:27:30.046 A:middle
and we would put that
content into this sort of URL.

00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.216 A:middle
And I want to highlight

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:36.676 A:middle
that we're specifying the U.S.
Storefront, and we're passing

00:27:36.676 --> 00:27:37.936 A:middle
in the term that
we're trying to search

00:27:37.936 --> 00:27:40.716 A:middle
for in the query parameter term.

00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:44.466 A:middle
In this case, the user
has typed in "The A Team."

00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:46.616 A:middle
Excuse me.

00:27:47.206 --> 00:27:54.616 A:middle
Now this query alone is going
to be - what you're going

00:27:54.616 --> 00:27:59.826 A:middle
to get is basically one of
Ed Sheeran's popular songs

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
from the past couple years,
which is called "The A Team,"


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
from the past couple years,
which is called "The A Team,"

00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:05.116 A:middle
and that's going to be very
popular, so that's going to be

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:05.976 A:middle
at the top of the list.

00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:08.636 A:middle
Following that, you're going
to see something like the

00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:12.006 A:middle
"The A-Team's" movie, which
came out a couple years ago,

00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:16.456 A:middle
and is second behind
the song content.

00:28:16.456 --> 00:28:21.206 A:middle
And following that, you're going
to get about 45 results for the

00:28:21.206 --> 00:28:23.496 A:middle
"The A-Team" TV show
from the '80's.

00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:25.236 A:middle
Now, "The A-Team"
show is awesome.

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.146 A:middle
Who doesn't like
the "The A-Team."

00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:26.626 A:middle
That's great.

00:28:27.026 --> 00:28:30.196 A:middle
But we're a music app so
we might not be interested

00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:32.036 A:middle
in getting TV show results.

00:28:32.636 --> 00:28:35.526 A:middle
Now the simple thing to do

00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:37.756 A:middle
in this case would
just be attach a limit.

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.516 A:middle
We can say, "Oh, well I'm only
interested in the music stuff.

00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:42.016 A:middle
The music stuff is
ranking highly,

00:28:42.326 --> 00:28:44.826 A:middle
so I'll put Limit equals 1 and
I only get one result back."

00:28:45.986 --> 00:28:48.796 A:middle
That's great, but what
if another sequel to the

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:52.246 A:middle
"The A-Team's" movie comes out
and suddenly that's highest.

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:56.956 A:middle
Our music app is suddenly
showing content for movies,

00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.356 A:middle
and that wouldn't be good.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.356 A:middle
and that wouldn't be good.

00:29:00.356 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
So that's one option.

00:29:02.296 --> 00:29:04.936 A:middle
There's a couple other
things we could do.

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:07.606 A:middle
We could say well, we're
only interested in searching

00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:11.146 A:middle
for the song term "The A
Team," or we're only interested

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:16.906 A:middle
in songs that are related to
the search term "The A Team."

00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:19.976 A:middle
But that's not really - that's
going to limit us a little bit,

00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:23.236 A:middle
because what if we want to
show albums, or what if we want

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:27.616 A:middle
to search on albums that
are called "The A Team."

00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:29.246 A:middle
There's probably
several of those.

00:29:30.286 --> 00:29:33.816 A:middle
So for our use case, this is
probably not such a great idea.

00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:40.106 A:middle
Instead, we need to find the
right thing to specify the type

00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:43.666 A:middle
of content we're interested
in, and here, it's media=music.

00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:44.536 A:middle
We're a music app.

00:29:44.786 --> 00:29:47.946 A:middle
We want people to be able
to search for artists

00:29:47.946 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
or albums or songs, whatever.

00:29:50.286 --> 00:29:52.286 A:middle
So we can specify media=music

00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:54.166 A:middle
and we get just the
results we're looking for.

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:58.606 A:middle
So we run this query and we
get the results we want back,

00:29:58.606 --> 00:29:58.976 A:middle
which is great.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:12.736 A:middle
Now, this is just one piece of
results, or one result back.

00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
Let's say our UI, we
might have an album focus,

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:19.586 A:middle
rather than on a specific song.

00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:21.376 A:middle
And let's say that
our UI we want

00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:25.936 A:middle
to know how much does the
content cost in the storefront.

00:30:26.186 --> 00:30:29.346 A:middle
And furthermore, we want
to show them all the songs

00:30:29.736 --> 00:30:31.446 A:middle
on that album in
that storefront.

00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:36.456 A:middle
Now, I like to say that
if you have a problem,

00:30:36.906 --> 00:30:40.556 A:middle
if no one else can help,
and if your problem relates

00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:42.516 A:middle
to content metadata
on the iTunes Store,

00:30:43.096 --> 00:30:46.346 A:middle
maybe you can hire
the Lookup API.

00:30:47.076 --> 00:30:51.126 A:middle
In this case, we have
figured out that our user is

00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:55.466 A:middle
in Great Britain, and so we
would just change the country

00:30:55.726 --> 00:31:00.356 A:middle
code in the URL to be GB, Great
Britain, and we're passing


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:55.726 --> 00:31:00.356 A:middle
code in the URL to be GB, Great
Britain, and we're passing

00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:03.656 A:middle
in the ID of the
collection itself.

00:31:03.796 --> 00:31:06.666 A:middle
Now the Lookup API has
a very simple model

00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:08.196 A:middle
for content on the store.

00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:10.896 A:middle
There are tracks,
which are individual,

00:31:11.116 --> 00:31:13.046 A:middle
indivisible pieces of content.

00:31:13.276 --> 00:31:17.786 A:middle
So this would be songs, books,
movies, TV episodes, apps.

00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:22.296 A:middle
There are collections,
which are albums,

00:31:22.486 --> 00:31:24.056 A:middle
TV seasons, that sort of thing.

00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
And there are artists.

00:31:25.946 --> 00:31:30.056 A:middle
These are musicians, actors, app
developers, that sort of thing.

00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:33.496 A:middle
Three levels, and you
can use the Lookup API

00:31:33.606 --> 00:31:35.116 A:middle
to navigate that hierarchy.

00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:41.426 A:middle
So we're passing in the
collection ID or the album ID

00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:45.596 A:middle
to the Lookup API, and we're
going to get results back to see

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:47.826 A:middle
if it's available for
sale in Great Britain.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:52.486 A:middle
What we're not going to see
is what tracks are available

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:53.646 A:middle
on that URL.

00:31:53.646 --> 00:31:58.716 A:middle
What we need to do in that
case is attach the entity

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:04.296 A:middle
that we're looking for, and the
entity=song will tell the Lookup


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:04.296 A:middle
that we're looking for, and the
entity=song will tell the Lookup

00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:07.036 A:middle
API, okay, give me back the
results that I asked for,

00:32:07.286 --> 00:32:11.806 A:middle
but also give me back the
songs that are on that album.

00:32:11.806 --> 00:32:15.716 A:middle
And here, we get the awesome
results back that you expect.

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.676 A:middle
So we get the album name, which
is "Plus," and the first track

00:32:19.676 --> 00:32:23.146 A:middle
on that album is the "The
A Team" and so on the rest

00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:25.306 A:middle
of the songs on that album.

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:29.576 A:middle
You can also go - navigate
up the content hierarchy,

00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:31.326 A:middle
so if you've got a song and
you want to know the artist,

00:32:31.326 --> 00:32:36.746 A:middle
you can pass in entity=artist
and track that that way.

00:32:36.936 --> 00:32:40.666 A:middle
So there's a lot you can
do with the Lookup API.

00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:42.406 A:middle
It's all up to date.

00:32:42.406 --> 00:32:44.276 A:middle
You might want to know
about price changes

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:45.226 A:middle
for particular things.

00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:49.336 A:middle
The Lookup API allows
you to do that.

00:32:49.526 --> 00:32:54.386 A:middle
Now, that said, you might
have slightly bigger needs

00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:55.336 A:middle
in terms of data.

00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:59.916 A:middle
And for that, we have the
Enterprise Partner Feeds,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:01.846 A:middle
or EPF as we commonly call them.

00:33:02.496 --> 00:33:05.986 A:middle
These are bulk metadata,

00:33:06.076 --> 00:33:09.676 A:middle
and it covers virtually
all iTunes Store content,

00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:15.056 A:middle
and this is very much for -
intended for big data needs.

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:17.926 A:middle
And when I say big
data, it's a lot.

00:33:17.926 --> 00:33:21.636 A:middle
It's something like if you
download the full data set

00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:24.016 A:middle
for this week, it's
going to be 10 gigabytes

00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:25.606 A:middle
of textual data compressed.

00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:28.916 A:middle
So it's not for the faint of
heart, but it can be very useful

00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:33.226 A:middle
if you're trying to
establish an understanding

00:33:33.226 --> 00:33:34.636 A:middle
of the entire iTunes universe.

00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:39.506 A:middle
Within the feeds
are multiple files,

00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:42.156 A:middle
and the files represent
database tables

00:33:42.156 --> 00:33:43.606 A:middle
in a relational database sense.

00:33:43.956 --> 00:33:45.056 A:middle
So there is for example,

00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:48.536 A:middle
an artist table representing
artists- you know musicians,

00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:49.466 A:middle
app developers and the like.

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:53.796 A:middle
There's an application
table for iPhone apps

00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:55.476 A:middle
and Mac apps, that
sort of thing.

00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:57.486 A:middle
And as you might expect
if you are familiar

00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:58.956 A:middle
with relational databases,

00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:01.786 A:middle
there's a relational
artist application table


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:01.786 A:middle
there's a relational
artist application table

00:34:02.186 --> 00:34:05.666 A:middle
that represents which
artists produced which apps.

00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:10.076 A:middle
So you can ingest this data
into a relational database

00:34:10.076 --> 00:34:14.716 A:middle
or other data store for analysis
and run your queries that way.

00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:18.576 A:middle
And again, it's aimed
at organizations

00:34:18.886 --> 00:34:21.295 A:middle
that have really
deep data needs.

00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:23.666 A:middle
There's a lot of data.

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:26.565 A:middle
There's pricing for
all countries

00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:31.045 A:middle
that the iTunes Store supports,
and analyzing that and dealing

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:33.286 A:middle
with the data, especially
on an ongoing basis,

00:34:33.286 --> 00:34:36.096 A:middle
can be really a huge effort.

00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:39.136 A:middle
Fortunately, we do have
an Importer script.

00:34:39.815 --> 00:34:45.795 A:middle
The script is available as a
Python app, and it's intended

00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:51.496 A:middle
to ingest a feed into a
MySQL database, but it's -

00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:54.466 A:middle
the sample code is
open, so if you'd like,

00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:57.276 A:middle
you can provide a different
back end and maybe write

00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:02.716 A:middle
to Hadoop HDFS or something like
that if your needs go that way.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:02.716 A:middle
to Hadoop HDFS or something like
that if your needs go that way.

00:35:03.906 --> 00:35:06.856 A:middle
So the Enterprise Partner
feeds - it's a great way

00:35:06.856 --> 00:35:11.086 A:middle
to get the whole content
database for iTunes.

00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:16.946 A:middle
You can do a lot with it,
but it takes some doing.

00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:19.496 A:middle
Slightly simpler
is the RSS feeds.

00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:25.346 A:middle
These are dynamic feeds for
kind of what's hot in a store.

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.366 A:middle
And by that I mean, you've
got a couple options.

00:35:28.366 --> 00:35:30.886 A:middle
You can see what's most
popular for each piece

00:35:30.886 --> 00:35:32.656 A:middle
of content and in each genre.

00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:34.746 A:middle
What's selling really
well right now?

00:35:35.776 --> 00:35:36.306 A:middle
What's new?

00:35:36.306 --> 00:35:38.236 A:middle
What's recently added?

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.596 A:middle
Whether this is, you
know, the hot new single

00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:46.416 A:middle
from today's artists or maybe a
piece of an album that has been

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:50.066 A:middle
out of the store for decades
and is just arriving now.

00:35:50.396 --> 00:35:52.526 A:middle
That's shows up in the New
and Recently added feeds.

00:35:52.596 --> 00:35:56.256 A:middle
You can see featured content
- what's actually showing

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:59.526 A:middle
up on the store right
now, what's a user see

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:03.216 A:middle
when they open iTunes to the
main page and check that out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:03.216 A:middle
when they open iTunes to the
main page and check that out.

00:36:03.216 --> 00:36:06.176 A:middle
And finally, you can
see customer reviews

00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:07.476 A:middle
for a particular
piece of content.

00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:08.616 A:middle
What are people saying about it?

00:36:08.616 --> 00:36:12.706 A:middle
There's - if you want to track
your own apps' performance,

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:16.256 A:middle
you can see recent customer
reviews using that RSS feed.

00:36:16.746 --> 00:36:20.506 A:middle
RSS is available in Atom format.

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:23.396 A:middle
That's pretty much the
standard for RSS these days.

00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:25.376 A:middle
It's also available in JSON.

00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:26.816 A:middle
If you don't want to
parse a bunch of XML,

00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:30.026 A:middle
you can get a JSON
format returned to you

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:31.836 A:middle
and ingest it that way.

00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:36.536 A:middle
So that's the advanced stuff.

00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.716 A:middle
There's all this and more
is very well documented

00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:42.076 A:middle
on the website, and
we'll have a URL for you

00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:46.086 A:middle
at the end of the session.

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:53.716 A:middle
Smart App Banners are a way for
you to cross-reference your app

00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:56.546 A:middle
from a website, and you've
probably seen this browsing the

00:36:56.546 --> 00:36:57.706 A:middle
web with the mobile Safari.

00:36:58.026 --> 00:37:01.216 A:middle
You link to a website, and
this little banner slides down


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.026 --> 00:37:01.216 A:middle
You link to a website, and
this little banner slides down

00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:04.756 A:middle
and allows you to download the
app if you haven't already,

00:37:05.186 --> 00:37:08.986 A:middle
or open it if you've got
it installed, or dismiss it

00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:10.526 A:middle
if you're actually not
interested in the app.

00:37:10.876 --> 00:37:13.936 A:middle
So from the user's perspective,
it's really powerful.

00:37:13.936 --> 00:37:17.506 A:middle
It's - if you want it, it's
there, and if you don't,

00:37:18.156 --> 00:37:21.216 A:middle
it gets out of the way.

00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:25.046 A:middle
What it does allow you,
the developer, to do,

00:37:25.246 --> 00:37:29.236 A:middle
is to show your content from
your website in a native,

00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:31.876 A:middle
custom experience that
your app can provide

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:33.266 A:middle
that mobile Safari maybe can't.

00:37:34.226 --> 00:37:39.056 A:middle
So this is really powerful
if you want to show or -

00:37:40.616 --> 00:37:42.286 A:middle
have people look at the content

00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:44.826 A:middle
on your website in
your custom app.

00:37:46.186 --> 00:37:49.436 A:middle
And again, if a user is not
interested, a simple tap

00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:51.746 A:middle
and it goes away, and
they're not bothered by it.

00:37:52.176 --> 00:37:53.176 A:middle
So how do we integrate
with that?

00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:55.316 A:middle
It's actually fairly simple.

00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:58.696 A:middle
You drop a simple metatag into
the head of your web page,

00:37:59.156 --> 00:38:02.426 A:middle
and the metatag has your
app ID defined in it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.156 --> 00:38:02.426 A:middle
and the metatag has your
app ID defined in it.

00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:03.446 A:middle
That's pretty obvious.

00:38:03.446 --> 00:38:04.816 A:middle
We've got to know
how to find it.

00:38:05.176 --> 00:38:07.516 A:middle
And when Mobile Safari
sees that,

00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:10.186 A:middle
it's going to fetch the
content, get the latest price

00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:13.896 A:middle
and show it to the user.

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.966 A:middle
You can also pass in
your affiliate data.

00:38:16.456 --> 00:38:19.036 A:middle
So here we've got our affiliate
token, which defines us

00:38:19.036 --> 00:38:22.526 A:middle
to the affiliate program, and
we're setting the campaign token

00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:25.596 A:middle
as Smart Banner so that we can
see how many people are actually

00:38:25.596 --> 00:38:27.456 A:middle
clicking on the Smart
Banner from our website.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:33.186 A:middle
Now the app argument is actually
a really important piece

00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:33.796 A:middle
of data here.

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
If we are running a news website

00:38:36.936 --> 00:38:38.496 A:middle
or a music recommendation
website,

00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:41.106 A:middle
and we're asking the user
to leave Mobile Safari,

00:38:41.106 --> 00:38:45.626 A:middle
leave all that context and
launch into this custom app,

00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:49.186 A:middle
we don't want to lose - we
don't want them to, you know,

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:51.026 A:middle
start at the home page
of our site again.

00:38:51.376 --> 00:38:53.896 A:middle
The app argument is
actually provided to the app

00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:58.636 A:middle
on a command line and you
can see the same content

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.126 A:middle
that the user was
looking at on the store.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.126 A:middle
that the user was
looking at on the store.

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:05.446 A:middle
So it's a way, you know,
it's easy, easy integration

00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:07.666 A:middle
without really interrupting
the flow of things.

00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:10.146 A:middle
So that's Smart App Banner.

00:39:10.146 --> 00:39:14.686 A:middle
If you've got a large website,
it's a very useful tool

00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:20.866 A:middle
for cross-referencing
your website and your app.

00:39:21.436 --> 00:39:26.366 A:middle
The StoreKit Product Sheet is a
brand new feature that we've got

00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:29.126 A:middle
and for the affiliate program.

00:39:29.126 --> 00:39:33.976 A:middle
It actually exists since
iTunes 6 and allows you

00:39:34.346 --> 00:39:38.756 A:middle
to show iTunes Store content
without actually leaving your -

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.506 A:middle
the workflow that
your user was in.

00:39:41.146 --> 00:39:43.156 A:middle
So for an example, we've
got here on Twitter,

00:39:43.856 --> 00:39:47.206 A:middle
the user sees a link to
the iTunes Store and taps

00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:52.916 A:middle
on this icon, and the
store sheet slides up

00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:56.486 A:middle
and allows the user to do
all the expected things

00:39:56.486 --> 00:39:57.696 A:middle
that you would do in the store.

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.956 A:middle
So you can read reviews.

00:39:58.956 --> 00:39:59.976 A:middle
You can look at screenshots.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:04.006 A:middle
You can buy it right
then and there.

00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:06.796 A:middle
Most importantly,
when they're done,

00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:10.356 A:middle
they can dismiss the store
- or the Store Sheet,

00:40:11.726 --> 00:40:16.546 A:middle
and they're right back in the
app on the page that they were

00:40:16.546 --> 00:40:19.326 A:middle
in before, so there's no
double tap to the home screen

00:40:19.326 --> 00:40:20.206 A:middle
and going back to your app.

00:40:20.526 --> 00:40:23.396 A:middle
It's all right in the same flow.

00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:27.236 A:middle
Now the Store Sheet, as I
said, has existed in iTunes 6,

00:40:27.536 --> 00:40:31.026 A:middle
but only recently have we added
it to the commission structure.

00:40:31.436 --> 00:40:35.266 A:middle
So that means if you
add affiliate data

00:40:35.456 --> 00:40:38.666 A:middle
to the Store Sheet, you're going
to get paid that same 7 percent

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.896 A:middle
over 24 hours that
you did before.

00:40:44.936 --> 00:40:47.736 A:middle
And to go over a demo of how
we can use the StoreKit Product

00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:50.536 A:middle
Sheet in our apps, I'm inviting
my friend Rick Rubenstein

00:40:50.536 --> 00:40:53.206 A:middle
up to show us how to use
Xcode and drop it in.

00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:54.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mark.

00:40:54.796 --> 00:40:56.686 A:middle
So I'm Rick Rubenstein.

00:40:56.686 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
I write tools and automation for
the iTunes store and App Store


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:56.686 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
I write tools and automation for
the iTunes store and App Store

00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:01.726 A:middle
and other related products.

00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.556 A:middle
And Mark asked me to
put together a quick app

00:41:04.606 --> 00:41:06.746 A:middle
to show how the StoreKit
product works,

00:41:07.106 --> 00:41:08.526 A:middle
out in the lobby
before the session.

00:41:10.786 --> 00:41:12.996 A:middle
Kidding, I wrote it a
little while before that.

00:41:12.996 --> 00:41:15.446 A:middle
So let me switch
over to iOS here.

00:41:17.356 --> 00:41:22.106 A:middle
So I'm going to fire up the
app that I wrote right now,

00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:24.636 A:middle
and then I'll explain how
it was built afterwards.

00:41:27.636 --> 00:41:31.016 A:middle
So here we have your typical
stick figure doing a juggling

00:41:31.016 --> 00:41:31.436 A:middle
trick app.

00:41:31.506 --> 00:41:33.046 A:middle
I'm sure you all have
several of these loaded

00:41:33.046 --> 00:41:34.186 A:middle
on your own iOS devices.

00:41:34.576 --> 00:41:39.126 A:middle
And if I'm a user, and I'm
mesmerized by this juggler,

00:41:39.126 --> 00:41:42.306 A:middle
I might say to myself, you
know, I would like some sort

00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:43.946 A:middle
of a juggling-related game.

00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:47.926 A:middle
Oh look, there's a button
right here in this very app

00:41:47.926 --> 00:41:50.936 A:middle
that will let me get
that content from,

00:41:50.936 --> 00:41:52.236 A:middle
in this case, the App Store.

00:41:53.216 --> 00:41:57.346 A:middle
So if I tap on that
link, it will bring

00:41:57.346 --> 00:42:00.676 A:middle
up the StoreKit Product
Sheet, just as Mark showed,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.346 --> 00:42:00.676 A:middle
up the StoreKit Product
Sheet, just as Mark showed,

00:42:00.676 --> 00:42:06.526 A:middle
and in the case, the StoreKit
Product Sheet is displaying a

00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:09.286 A:middle
juggling-themed ball app.

00:42:09.886 --> 00:42:13.236 A:middle
Now the key thing here is that
while it may look as if I'm

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:16.406 A:middle
in the App Store right now,

00:42:16.876 --> 00:42:20.756 A:middle
the Juggling dude app is still
running there in the background.

00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:24.296 A:middle
So if I had wanted to
when I brought that up,

00:42:24.556 --> 00:42:27.006 A:middle
I could've actually
decided to buy this app.

00:42:27.286 --> 00:42:29.046 A:middle
I'm not going to do that
right now because I'm cheap,

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:33.096 A:middle
but if I were an actual
customer, I might do that.

00:42:33.566 --> 00:42:35.106 A:middle
And then you, the affiliate,

00:42:35.406 --> 00:42:37.196 A:middle
would receive credit
for that purchase.

00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:39.726 A:middle
I'm going to bring
this up one more time.

00:42:40.156 --> 00:42:44.016 A:middle
Now if I had decided to click
on - to tap on the store link

00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:46.926 A:middle
in the upper right, then
the user would be taken

00:42:46.926 --> 00:42:49.206 A:middle
to the App Store.

00:42:49.616 --> 00:42:54.246 A:middle
That same content would
be displayed, and anything

00:42:54.246 --> 00:42:57.926 A:middle
that that user bought within
the 24-hour bounty window, you,

00:42:57.926 --> 00:42:59.456 A:middle
the affiliate, would
receive a commission

00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:00.836 A:middle
on all those purchases.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:00.836 A:middle
on all those purchases.

00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:02.996 A:middle
So I'm going to switch over now

00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:09.206 A:middle
and show you what
actually happened there.

00:43:09.436 --> 00:43:12.046 A:middle
So here we have the
new affiliate dashboard

00:43:12.116 --> 00:43:16.536 A:middle
that Mark showed before,
and this is live in Safari,

00:43:17.816 --> 00:43:20.376 A:middle
and you can see that
there are the clicks

00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:21.516 A:middle
that I made during the demo.

00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:23.746 A:middle
They've already showed
up, the taps that I made.

00:43:24.006 --> 00:43:26.646 A:middle
This bump here earlier is when
I was rehearsing beforehand.

00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:32.106 A:middle
And so this shows the near
real-time tracking of all

00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:34.426 A:middle
of the affiliate data.

00:43:34.966 --> 00:43:40.586 A:middle
So I'm going to put this
away and bring up Xcode

00:43:42.926 --> 00:43:44.396 A:middle
and show you exactly
how you can go

00:43:44.396 --> 00:43:46.816 A:middle
about putting the StoreKit
Product Sheet in your own apps.

00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:47.856 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:43:48.776 --> 00:43:55.966 A:middle
So the first thing you need
to make sure you do is link

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:59.156 A:middle
against the StoreKit framework.

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.706 A:middle
This is a public
framework that is available


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.706 A:middle
This is a public
framework that is available

00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:04.566 A:middle
to any iOS developer,
and it lets you interact

00:44:04.716 --> 00:44:07.486 A:middle
with the iTunes Store, the
App Store in various ways.

00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:10.156 A:middle
In this case, the way is by
the StoreKit Product Sheet.

00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:15.596 A:middle
So here we have the header
for our main ViewController,

00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:19.586 A:middle
and again, just showing here

00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:23.026 A:middle
that we are importing
the StoreKit framework

00:44:23.586 --> 00:44:25.746 A:middle
that lets us access the
StoreKit Product Sheet.

00:44:26.806 --> 00:44:29.116 A:middle
Sorry, this is all objective
so you haven't had a chance

00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:31.706 A:middle
to write it in Swift just yet.

00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:34.876 A:middle
So here we have the
implementation

00:44:35.876 --> 00:44:40.086 A:middle
for the ViewController, and this
is the key method right here.

00:44:40.086 --> 00:44:41.746 A:middle
This is the method
that I have defined

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:43.116 A:middle
on the ViewController class,

00:44:43.466 --> 00:44:48.936 A:middle
which I've called simply
Store Sheet for Product -

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:54.066 A:middle
takes three parameters, the
itunesId, the affiliateToken

00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:55.226 A:middle
and the campaignToken.

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:58.516 A:middle
Now this is the new
difference in iOS 8.

00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.616 A:middle
As Mark mentioned, the StoreKit
Product Sheet itself has been


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.616 A:middle
As Mark mentioned, the StoreKit
Product Sheet itself has been

00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:05.756 A:middle
available since iOS
6, but previously,

00:45:05.756 --> 00:45:07.876 A:middle
you could not include
the affiliate data.

00:45:08.116 --> 00:45:10.506 A:middle
Only one parameter was accepted,
which was the itunesId.

00:45:11.546 --> 00:45:13.076 A:middle
So now you can add
the affiliateToken.

00:45:13.076 --> 00:45:15.366 A:middle
That's your usual affiliate
token that identifies you.

00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:18.386 A:middle
And the campaignToken,
which as Mark mentioned,

00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:20.656 A:middle
can be any string up to
40 characters in length

00:45:21.046 --> 00:45:23.326 A:middle
that you can use to identify
your different campaigns,

00:45:23.366 --> 00:45:27.686 A:middle
group your data however
you want to analyze it.

00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:33.366 A:middle
So I take these three
parameters, and I put them

00:45:33.366 --> 00:45:35.436 A:middle
into a standard NSDictionary.

00:45:35.886 --> 00:45:41.386 A:middle
Move this so you
can see this better.

00:45:41.386 --> 00:45:42.306 A:middle
Simple dictionary.

00:45:42.736 --> 00:45:44.906 A:middle
These are symbolic
constants that are defined

00:45:44.906 --> 00:45:46.106 A:middle
in the StoreKit framework.

00:45:46.106 --> 00:45:52.986 A:middle
The SKStoreProductParameter
ITunesItemIdentifier is

00:45:53.196 --> 00:45:54.176 A:middle
the itunesId.

00:45:54.176 --> 00:45:56.746 A:middle
That's this one that you
passed in and the two new ones,

00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:58.576 A:middle
the
ProductParameterAffiliateToken

00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.866 A:middle
and the
ProductParameterCampaignToken.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.866 A:middle
and the
ProductParameterCampaignToken.

00:46:01.186 --> 00:46:02.206 A:middle
Those are optional.

00:46:02.206 --> 00:46:04.786 A:middle
You don't need to include them,
but since you are an affiliate,

00:46:04.786 --> 00:46:06.166 A:middle
you probably do want
to include them

00:46:06.326 --> 00:46:07.536 A:middle
so that you earn
your commissions.

00:46:08.206 --> 00:46:13.386 A:middle
So the next thing you need
to do is actually create

00:46:13.386 --> 00:46:14.156 A:middle
to the ViewController.

00:46:14.326 --> 00:46:18.586 A:middle
You do that using a standard
Objective-C, alloc init model,

00:46:18.966 --> 00:46:21.726 A:middle
which you're probably
familiar with, and you need

00:46:21.726 --> 00:46:23.976 A:middle
to set a delegate for it,
which will be called back

00:46:24.016 --> 00:46:25.986 A:middle
when it's time to
dismiss the sheet.

00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:28.776 A:middle
And in this case, we're
simply setting the delegate

00:46:28.896 --> 00:46:31.786 A:middle
to ourselves, the same
ViewController object

00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:32.416 A:middle
that we're using.

00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:36.846 A:middle
So here's the key
call right here.

00:46:37.426 --> 00:46:40.516 A:middle
We need to load the
product into the controller.

00:46:41.536 --> 00:46:43.486 A:middle
So this is the method

00:46:43.576 --> 00:46:47.566 A:middle
on the StoreKit View
Product Controller.

00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:49.386 A:middle
Load product with parameters.

00:46:49.926 --> 00:46:51.726 A:middle
Parameters is the
dictionary we just created

00:46:51.966 --> 00:46:54.506 A:middle
that contains again, the
iTunes ID, the affiliate token

00:46:54.506 --> 00:46:56.896 A:middle
and the campaign token.

00:46:57.306 --> 00:46:59.076 A:middle
It also takes a completion
block,

00:46:59.446 --> 00:47:02.146 A:middle
which is the standard
Objective-C block,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.446 --> 00:47:02.146 A:middle
which is the standard
Objective-C block,

00:47:03.616 --> 00:47:08.056 A:middle
which will return a
result, simply yes or no

00:47:08.056 --> 00:47:09.826 A:middle
as to whether it
successfully loaded.

00:47:10.206 --> 00:47:12.316 A:middle
And in the case that it
didn't successfully load

00:47:12.316 --> 00:47:16.106 A:middle
for some reason, say that you
somehow had an incorrect piece

00:47:16.106 --> 00:47:19.336 A:middle
of content that didn't
actually exist on the store,

00:47:19.806 --> 00:47:20.846 A:middle
there's an error parameter.

00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:24.986 A:middle
And in the block, we define
what we do in these two cases.

00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:26.466 A:middle
In this case, if
there's an error,

00:47:26.466 --> 00:47:27.786 A:middle
we're just logging it normally.

00:47:27.786 --> 00:47:29.116 A:middle
In an actual app, you
would probably want

00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
to display some sort of dialogue
or UI to the user saying

00:47:32.426 --> 00:47:34.406 A:middle
that this content for
whatever reason failed

00:47:34.406 --> 00:47:37.066 A:middle
to load in the sheet.

00:47:37.066 --> 00:47:38.506 A:middle
And if it successfully loaded,

00:47:38.886 --> 00:47:40.596 A:middle
here we're simply
logging that it loaded.

00:47:40.596 --> 00:47:42.246 A:middle
Normally you wouldn't
need to do anything

00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:43.976 A:middle
in that case, just go on.

00:47:44.246 --> 00:47:47.496 A:middle
So at this point, you
have loaded the product

00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:49.536 A:middle
into the sheet but you
haven't actually displayed it.

00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:51.436 A:middle
So that's what this
call is here.

00:47:52.506 --> 00:47:57.476 A:middle
So we call on ourself,
which is our ViewController,

00:47:58.656 --> 00:48:00.296 A:middle
present the sheetController.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:58.656 --> 00:48:00.296 A:middle
present the sheetController.

00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:03.716 A:middle
Animated, you normally
want a yes,

00:48:03.716 --> 00:48:06.266 A:middle
and that also takes
a completion block.

00:48:06.986 --> 00:48:08.776 A:middle
And in this case again,
we aren't doing anything

00:48:08.776 --> 00:48:10.126 A:middle
in particular in the
completion block.

00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:12.666 A:middle
Just for reference, we're
logging that we've completed.

00:48:13.836 --> 00:48:20.266 A:middle
One more important
method here is productView

00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:21.456 A:middle
ControllerDidFinish.

00:48:21.456 --> 00:48:22.816 A:middle
This is the callback method

00:48:23.516 --> 00:48:28.306 A:middle
that gets called whenever the
sheet action is complete either

00:48:28.306 --> 00:48:30.716 A:middle
by the user clicking cancel,
clicking outside of the sheet

00:48:30.996 --> 00:48:32.386 A:middle
or going elsewhere
from the sheet.

00:48:34.086 --> 00:48:36.866 A:middle
And this is where you
actually dismiss the sheet

00:48:37.316 --> 00:48:38.116 A:middle
to get it to go away.

00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:39.236 A:middle
Otherwise, it will remain up.

00:48:39.456 --> 00:48:43.226 A:middle
The cancel action won't
appear to have done anything.

00:48:43.606 --> 00:48:48.936 A:middle
And this is simply the IBAction,
the Interface Builder action

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:53.676 A:middle
that we tied to the button
that was in the top of the app

00:48:54.506 --> 00:48:58.196 A:middle
and simply in this case,
preloads it with the iTunesId

00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:01.196 A:middle
of that juggling pinball
app that I showed,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:01.196 A:middle
of that juggling pinball
app that I showed,

00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:03.746 A:middle
and the affiliateToken
and the campaignToken.

00:49:04.306 --> 00:49:07.176 A:middle
The code for getting the guy to
do the juggling trick is left

00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:08.396 A:middle
as an exercise for the viewer.

00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:12.286 A:middle
So that's the StoreKit
Product Sheet.

00:49:12.796 --> 00:49:13.976 A:middle
It's very simple to implement.

00:49:13.976 --> 00:49:16.286 A:middle
It's just a couple of calls
and it's pretty powerful

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.636 A:middle
in conjunction with
the affiliate program.

00:49:18.066 --> 00:49:18.626 A:middle
Thank you.

00:49:19.516 --> 00:49:23.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:49:24.066 --> 00:49:25.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Back to you, Mark.

00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:26.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:27.606 A:middle
Thanks very much, Rick.

00:49:27.636 --> 00:49:28.026 A:middle
That was awesome.

00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:30.736 A:middle
So like he said, StoreKit
Product Sheet, you can do a lot

00:49:30.736 --> 00:49:33.426 A:middle
with it, and best of
all, for your users,

00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:37.476 A:middle
it's very unintrusive,
so take a look.

00:49:38.926 --> 00:49:43.526 A:middle
Next up on our list of things
to talk about is iTunes Radio.

00:49:43.976 --> 00:49:45.516 A:middle
Now iTunes Radio
launched recently,

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:50.356 A:middle
and even more recently,
we have added it

00:49:50.486 --> 00:49:54.446 A:middle
to the affiliate program,
which means that if you link

00:49:54.646 --> 00:50:00.626 A:middle
to an iTunes Radio station, you
get credited for that referral.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:54.646 --> 00:50:00.626 A:middle
to an iTunes Radio station, you
get credited for that referral.

00:50:02.056 --> 00:50:04.126 A:middle
And again, it's very easy to do.

00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:07.566 A:middle
Here's another example
using our friend Ed Sheeran,

00:50:07.956 --> 00:50:11.236 A:middle
and we're in the Sound Hound
app, and they've got a link

00:50:11.436 --> 00:50:15.466 A:middle
down near the bottom of -
that links to iTunes Radio.

00:50:15.966 --> 00:50:19.306 A:middle
And when the user taps on that,
the radio station is going

00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:22.836 A:middle
to be created and added to
their stations, and the song

00:50:23.176 --> 00:50:25.436 A:middle
that the radio station
starts with begins to play.

00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:29.306 A:middle
So this is a great
way to tell your users

00:50:29.306 --> 00:50:33.546 A:middle
or to recommend a certain
set of content to your users.

00:50:33.816 --> 00:50:35.606 A:middle
Maybe they don't want to buy
it, but they want to listen

00:50:35.606 --> 00:50:39.436 A:middle
to music that's inspired by
a particular artist or song.

00:50:39.886 --> 00:50:44.116 A:middle
You can get them into the
iTunes Radio experience

00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:46.746 A:middle
and listening to
music immediately.

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:52.356 A:middle
Best of all, this is supported
with the affiliate program

00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:54.656 A:middle
with the same terms
as everything else.

00:50:54.706 --> 00:50:58.236 A:middle
So 7 percent over 24 hours,
and that applies not just

00:50:58.236 --> 00:51:00.806 A:middle
to purchases made within
the iTunes Radio app,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.236 --> 00:51:00.806 A:middle
to purchases made within
the iTunes Radio app,

00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:04.646 A:middle
but any other store on that same
device where the cookie exists.

00:51:04.866 --> 00:51:08.396 A:middle
So that means music, of
course, apps, books, movies,

00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:12.336 A:middle
all the rest, are all supported
under the affiliate program.

00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:17.346 A:middle
Now to construct a
link to iTunes Radio,

00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:22.206 A:middle
we've added some functionality
to the Search and Lookup APIs

00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:25.096 A:middle
so that the content result
that you see will have links

00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:26.446 A:middle
to the radio stations
themselves.

00:51:27.396 --> 00:51:31.496 A:middle
So here, we're looking for Ed
Sheeran, and in the result set

00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:33.796 A:middle
that we get back, we're
looking for an artist.

00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:39.706 A:middle
The JSON has a radio
station URL, and you can use

00:51:39.706 --> 00:51:44.726 A:middle
that special URL to launch into
the iTunes Radio application.

00:51:45.646 --> 00:51:48.186 A:middle
You would of course have to add
your affiliate data to this URL

00:51:48.186 --> 00:51:48.976 A:middle
as we've been discussing.

00:51:49.616 --> 00:51:51.566 A:middle
So that's iTunes Radio.

00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:56.266 A:middle
It's a great set of music
for users to listen to,

00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:59.576 A:middle
and you get a bonus
for any purchases made

00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:00.596 A:middle
after clicking that link.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:00.596 A:middle
after clicking that link.

00:52:01.866 --> 00:52:05.336 A:middle
We're going to end up talking
today about collections,

00:52:06.036 --> 00:52:09.756 A:middle
and collections are something
you might be familiar

00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:11.126 A:middle
with from previous talks.

00:52:11.126 --> 00:52:16.496 A:middle
It used to be called Web iMix,
but this is a dynamic playlist

00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:18.876 A:middle
that is defined entirely
by a URL,

00:52:18.876 --> 00:52:21.106 A:middle
and here's what it looks like.

00:52:21.716 --> 00:52:23.286 A:middle
This is a collection
we've defined

00:52:23.286 --> 00:52:26.776 A:middle
by creating a special URL,
and we've set the title.

00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:30.236 A:middle
We've set the description.

00:52:30.676 --> 00:52:32.836 A:middle
Now there's a limit on what
kind of text you can put

00:52:32.836 --> 00:52:35.996 A:middle
in the description,
but it's fairly broad.

00:52:36.906 --> 00:52:39.476 A:middle
And finally, we can
actually define the content

00:52:39.896 --> 00:52:41.716 A:middle
of the playlist itself.

00:52:42.086 --> 00:52:45.606 A:middle
So here we've got four
songs by Ed Sheeran,

00:52:46.226 --> 00:52:49.386 A:middle
and the user can buy each
of these individually

00:52:49.636 --> 00:52:53.686 A:middle
or tap a single click and
buy the whole thing at once.

00:52:55.556 --> 00:52:58.556 A:middle
So how do we do this?

00:52:58.606 --> 00:53:01.276 A:middle
The - to create a Collection

00:52:58.606 --> 00:53:01.276 A:middle
The - to create a Collection
Link you need set something

00:53:01.276 --> 00:53:02.066 A:middle
up beforehand.

00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:06.326 A:middle
What you need in addition to
the normal affiliate signup is

00:53:06.326 --> 00:53:10.446 A:middle
to get a special
collection account with us.

00:53:10.566 --> 00:53:14.426 A:middle
We will tell you a
special web developer ID

00:53:14.806 --> 00:53:18.436 A:middle
and a shared secret, and
the shared secret is used

00:53:18.436 --> 00:53:21.056 A:middle
to cryptographically
sign these URLs,

00:53:21.476 --> 00:53:24.366 A:middle
so we know who the
author is of that title,

00:53:24.366 --> 00:53:25.756 A:middle
and description and the content.

00:53:28.866 --> 00:53:33.086 A:middle
Collections support songs,
albums, movies, TV shows

00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:36.456 A:middle
and music videos, so you can
have kind of a wide-ranging set

00:53:36.456 --> 00:53:37.586 A:middle
of content that you link to,

00:53:38.026 --> 00:53:40.656 A:middle
and this could actually
be pretty high value.

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.826 A:middle
If you know your
user is interested

00:53:42.826 --> 00:53:46.886 A:middle
in six different movies,
and they're ready to buy,

00:53:46.936 --> 00:53:49.726 A:middle
they're ready to go, you can put
a single link in front of them

00:53:49.856 --> 00:53:52.186 A:middle
and they can buy six
movies with one tap.

00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:57.216 A:middle
That can mean a lot of money
in terms of commissions.

00:53:57.676 --> 00:54:02.476 A:middle
To get started with the
Collection system, you -

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:57.676 --> 00:54:02.476 A:middle
To get started with the
Collection system, you -

00:54:02.476 --> 00:54:04.316 A:middle
there's a bunch of
documentation available online,

00:54:04.976 --> 00:54:08.236 A:middle
but let's take a look at what
these links actually look like.

00:54:08.346 --> 00:54:09.836 A:middle
They're rather intimidating
at first,

00:54:09.866 --> 00:54:11.026 A:middle
but we can break
them down for you.

00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:15.906 A:middle
We start with the Prefix,
which - has a little bit

00:54:15.906 --> 00:54:17.236 A:middle
of history, viewWebIMix.

00:54:19.076 --> 00:54:21.586 A:middle
There's the title that we
defined, of course URL encoded.

00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:24.016 A:middle
The description is
also in there,

00:54:24.816 --> 00:54:28.466 A:middle
and the IDs that we
wanted, URL-encoded again

00:54:28.886 --> 00:54:31.436 A:middle
so that the link actually
works, are in there.

00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:34.726 A:middle
Additionally, we've
passed in a wdID.

00:54:34.726 --> 00:54:36.316 A:middle
That's the Web Developer ID.

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:39.616 A:middle
And we've signed - we've done
a little bit of cryptography

00:54:39.616 --> 00:54:41.336 A:middle
and we've added a
key to the URL,

00:54:41.396 --> 00:54:43.096 A:middle
and we put that into
the key parameter.

00:54:43.806 --> 00:54:47.326 A:middle
And finally, we've got our
affiliates hooking up at the top

00:54:47.786 --> 00:54:50.236 A:middle
because we want to
get a commission

00:54:50.236 --> 00:54:51.026 A:middle
on this link of course.

00:54:52.306 --> 00:54:55.176 A:middle
So this is a great way to
make things happen on the fly

00:54:55.176 --> 00:54:59.846 A:middle
if your user has a special set
of desires that you know about.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:00.066 --> 00:55:03.376 A:middle
You can put together a single
collection with this on the fly.

00:55:03.736 --> 00:55:05.106 A:middle
You don't need to
do - you don't need

00:55:05.106 --> 00:55:08.256 A:middle
to register a particular
collection beforehand.

00:55:08.526 --> 00:55:10.536 A:middle
Once you're signed up, you
can do this any time you want.

00:55:10.816 --> 00:55:13.626 A:middle
Now on the other hand,
maybe you don't want

00:55:13.626 --> 00:55:14.776 A:middle
to have the difficulty

00:55:14.776 --> 00:55:17.016 A:middle
of defining these
URLs programmatically.

00:55:17.376 --> 00:55:18.726 A:middle
For that, we have
Collection Builder,

00:55:19.386 --> 00:55:25.566 A:middle
and this is a really simple
UI to define the title

00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:27.186 A:middle
and description and the content.

00:55:27.606 --> 00:55:30.476 A:middle
And the Collection Builder,
if you pass in a wdID

00:55:30.476 --> 00:55:33.576 A:middle
and your shared secret,
will create the URL for you.

00:55:33.766 --> 00:55:37.206 A:middle
So if you've got maybe
a game and you want

00:55:37.206 --> 00:55:40.146 A:middle
to promote the soundtrack
to the game,

00:55:40.146 --> 00:55:42.666 A:middle
and maybe you've got a
comic iBook that kind

00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:45.036 A:middle
of expands the game's universe
- something like that -

00:55:45.286 --> 00:55:48.576 A:middle
you can define that very
easily via Collection Builder.

00:55:50.016 --> 00:55:51.866 A:middle
Once you've got your
title and description,

00:55:52.236 --> 00:55:55.076 A:middle
you can start searching
for additional content,

00:55:55.476 --> 00:56:01.246 A:middle
add that to your dynamic
playlist, and you hit go,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:55.476 --> 00:56:01.246 A:middle
add that to your dynamic
playlist, and you hit go,

00:56:01.276 --> 00:56:05.446 A:middle
and you get a collection
URL that you can paste

00:56:05.446 --> 00:56:08.736 A:middle
into your web page or into
your app, whatever you need.

00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:10.626 A:middle
So that's Collection Builder.

00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:16.486 A:middle
There's a lot of interesting
things you can do with that

00:56:16.486 --> 00:56:17.716 A:middle
with the right situation.

00:56:18.496 --> 00:56:23.556 A:middle
So to summarize, most
important thing to take away

00:56:23.556 --> 00:56:25.266 A:middle
with you right today is

00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:28.156 A:middle
that we've got one program
that works worldwide.

00:56:28.436 --> 00:56:31.876 A:middle
Sign up is trivially easy, and
once you do that, you're going

00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:35.596 A:middle
to be able to market your
content in 147 countries,

00:56:35.906 --> 00:56:37.266 A:middle
and that list is
growing as well.

00:56:38.556 --> 00:56:41.576 A:middle
We've got a simplified link
structure, so you don't have

00:56:41.756 --> 00:56:45.576 A:middle
to figure out what one
URL looks like to one user

00:56:45.956 --> 00:56:48.566 A:middle
and then present a
different URL to another user

00:56:48.566 --> 00:56:49.296 A:middle
in a different region.

00:56:50.196 --> 00:56:51.906 A:middle
That is a huge headache removed.

00:56:52.726 --> 00:56:55.696 A:middle
We've got a unified dashboard,
so we can see what's going

00:56:55.696 --> 00:56:59.046 A:middle
on at a glance across the
world, or we can drill

00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:02.236 A:middle
down into a particular country,
a particular content type.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:02.236 A:middle
down into a particular country,
a particular content type.

00:57:02.716 --> 00:57:05.946 A:middle
Really powerful, real
time, really great.

00:57:07.406 --> 00:57:09.106 A:middle
We've got a great new
commission structure:

00:57:09.296 --> 00:57:11.596 A:middle
7 percent over 24 hours.

00:57:11.626 --> 00:57:14.326 A:middle
That can mean a lot
to your bottom line.

00:57:14.716 --> 00:57:17.936 A:middle
We've added iTunes Radio and
the StoreKit Product Sheet

00:57:17.936 --> 00:57:20.626 A:middle
to the affiliate program so you
get credit - the same structure

00:57:20.626 --> 00:57:22.596 A:middle
as everything else
by using that.

00:57:23.516 --> 00:57:26.396 A:middle
And of course, we've got
a lot of tools and a lot

00:57:26.396 --> 00:57:28.166 A:middle
of documentation
available online.

00:57:28.496 --> 00:57:29.426 A:middle
So check it out.

00:57:30.856 --> 00:57:33.526 A:middle
The documentation - we
have a whole resource site

00:57:33.526 --> 00:57:35.266 A:middle
at affiliate.iTunes.apple.com.

00:57:35.616 --> 00:57:36.926 A:middle
Highly recommend
checking that out.

00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:39.206 A:middle
There's a support link
available too, and of course,

00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:41.316 A:middle
there's devforums if you
any questions that you want

00:57:41.316 --> 00:57:43.136 A:middle
to ask your fellow developers.

00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:47.816 A:middle
There's a related
session happening tomorrow

00:57:48.016 --> 00:57:49.526 A:middle
about using StoreKit.

00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:51.536 A:middle
It's called "Optimizing
In-App Purchases,"

00:57:51.956 --> 00:57:54.466 A:middle
and they'll be covering a bit

00:57:54.466 --> 00:57:55.876 A:middle
about the StoreKit
Product Sheet there.

00:57:55.876 --> 00:57:58.316 A:middle
And if you have any questions
about the affiliate program

00:57:58.316 --> 00:58:00.406 A:middle
or the StoreKit Product
Sheet, we've got a couple labs

00:57:58.316 --> 00:58:00.406 A:middle
or the StoreKit Product
Sheet, we've got a couple labs

00:58:00.406 --> 00:58:01.246 A:middle
in the next couple days.

00:58:01.646 --> 00:58:06.806 A:middle
We're going to be downstairs at
2 p.m. so feel free to come by,

00:58:06.806 --> 00:58:07.896 A:middle
say hello, ask some questions.

00:58:07.896 --> 00:58:08.746 A:middle
We'll be glad to help.

00:58:08.816 --> 00:58:11.086 A:middle
That's it for the
presentation today.

00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.976 A:middle
Thanks all for coming and have
a great rest of the conference.
