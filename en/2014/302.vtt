Welcome to "The New
iTunes Connect."

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.476 A:middle
I'm Dave Van Tassell,

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.046 A:middle
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.036 A:middle
We have a lot of great things
to talk to you about today.

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:30.316 A:middle
To do so, I'm going
to need the clicker

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.226 A:middle
over on this desk right here.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:35.246 A:middle
It all starts with a new design.

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.636 A:middle
We want to take you on a
little bit of a walkthrough,

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:39.806 A:middle
some of the new features
that we've added,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.606 A:middle
some of the new flows.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.366 A:middle
Second thing is app previews.

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.416 A:middle
It's a great chance for you to
upload a video 15 to 30 seconds,

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.946 A:middle
dynamic view of what
makes your app magical.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
App bundles - you can bundle
up to 10 apps together

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.856 A:middle
with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.

with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.946 A:middle
App analytics - we're
very excited about this.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:06.596 A:middle
This is the best end to end
view of your app with data

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.106 A:middle
that only Apple can provide.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.886 A:middle
And last, TestFlight
beta testing.

[ Applause ]

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.096 A:middle
We're very excited about this.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:26.846 A:middle
Give you a little
more insight and depth

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.736 A:middle
into what we have planned
for TestFlight beta testing.

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.396 A:middle
So we start with the Home page

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.996 A:middle
of iTunes Connect,
an all new design.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:39.096 A:middle
We have the same sections as
today, with great new icons.

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:42.406 A:middle
If you have any news or
announcements for you,

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.006 A:middle
like perhaps you haven't
signed the latest contract

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.086 A:middle
that released, that's going
to go right there on the top.

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:51.596 A:middle
But we came here to work
today, so let's jump

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.916 A:middle
into My Apps and
see what we have.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.016 A:middle
The first thing you're going

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.926 A:middle
to notice is it's
wall to wall apps.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.946 A:middle
We're trying to give it
as much space as we can

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.486 A:middle
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.486 A:middle
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:07.996 A:middle
at the same time giving each app
a little more space to breathe,

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.316 A:middle
the full name of the app, the
complete iTunes Connect status.

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:14.626 A:middle
Easier to tell the
difference between waiting

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.096 A:middle
for review and in review.

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
Also we've added a little badge
there to show the difference

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.336 A:middle
between iOS and Mac apps.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.796 A:middle
If you came to the My Apps page
to check on, perhaps the status

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.816 A:middle
of an app, to see if the "Hair
Salon" app has been approved

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.406 A:middle
and is ready to go, there at
the top we have an iSearch bar,

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.716 A:middle
type in "hair salon," and
all the hair salon apps float

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:38.196 A:middle
to the top.

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:40.436 A:middle
I see it's all green;
green is good.

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.606 A:middle
My app's been approved,
it's ready for sale,

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.296 A:middle
I'm off to go check
and see how it's doing.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.536 A:middle
We've also added some filtering.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.106 A:middle
You can see there in the
top right-hand corner,

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.306 A:middle
the search by status.

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.636 A:middle
You can filter - and see I
have 24 different statuses,

00:02:57.836 --> 00:02:59.226 A:middle
23 are ready for sale.

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.636 A:middle
I have one prepared for upload.

I have one prepared for upload.

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.746 A:middle
If I want to click on
one of these statuses,

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.236 A:middle
then I'll filter away
all the other apps

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.966 A:middle
and show just the apps with
this iTunes Connect status.

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:10.016 A:middle
Some of you like the list view;
we've improved that as well.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
More apps on one page, the
same search and filtering

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:18.236 A:middle
that we've provided on
the icon view also exists

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:18.976 A:middle
on this list view.

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.276 A:middle
You can sort by the different
column names, change that up.

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:26.656 A:middle
And what's great is if you leave
the My Apps page and come back,

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.076 A:middle
or if you sign out iTunes
Connect, when you come back

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.356 A:middle
to My Apps we'll take you
right back to the list view.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:36.166 A:middle
We're going to go back into the
icon view and jump into an app.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:40.156 A:middle
What we've done here is
combine the app pages

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:41.846 A:middle
and the version pages into one,

00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:44.016 A:middle
because at the top
we have the app icon,

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:48.216 A:middle
and going across we have
different tabs, we have pricing,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.356 A:middle
we have In-App Purchases,
manage your Game Center.

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.926 A:middle
We take you by default to the
version tab and to the ready

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:57.416 A:middle
for sale version of My App.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.276 A:middle

right there in front of me

and other metadata as it goes.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:05.266 A:middle
What we want to do is
create a new version.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.246 A:middle
So we click on the upper
right-hand corner there,

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.096 A:middle
it's the new version button,
and we're provided with a window

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.046 A:middle
to enter in our version number.

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.866 A:middle
You'll notice there's no "what's
new" text on this window.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.896 A:middle
This information is still
required, but we understand

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:23.656 A:middle
that you don't always have
all the marketing data ready

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:25.836 A:middle
when you want to take actions
like create a new version.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.186 A:middle
And in fact, we've added this
to the new app flow as well.

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.246 A:middle
When you create a new app,
all you need is a name,

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.016 A:middle
a bundle ID and a SKU.

You can come back when you're
ready to do those descriptions,

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.236 A:middle
those screenshots
and what have you.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:48.976 A:middle
All right, so we're going
to create this new version.

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:54.846 A:middle
It'll create a new sub-tab
there with the 1.0.2.

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:58.796 A:middle

We can see that the What's New

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.456 A:middle
in this version text
hasn't been filled in.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:05.406 A:middle
I can fill it in
now, either way.

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.086 A:middle
I keep scrolling down,
and I see the rest

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:10.556 A:middle
of my version information.

00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:13.226 A:middle
I can change that right
now, easy to edit.

I can save and come back later.

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:22.426 A:middle
But we came here today to
create the iPad version

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.456 A:middle
of this app, make it universal.

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:29.366 A:middle
So I'm going to click on the
iPad tab, and what I need

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.286 A:middle
for an iPad is new screenshots,

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:34.426 A:middle
that's really the only metadata
difference iPhones and iPads.

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:38.956 A:middle
And screenshots are great:
five snapshots of what's going

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:40.606 A:middle
on in my app, right now.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:45.796 A:middle
But we also want to give
a more dynamic experience.

00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:47.696 A:middle
We want to upload
an app preview.

What is it about my
app that's magical

that makes people
want to click on it?

00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:57.396 A:middle

click Play on your video.

we click edit poster frame,
and up pops the video itself

00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:37.586 A:middle
They don't want to be sold
to it; it's not an ad.

00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:40.856 A:middle
You can capture this
video straight

00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:43.606 A:middle
from iOS 8 onto OS X Yosemite.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:49.576 A:middle
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length,

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:54.066 A:middle
and we accept both H.264
and ProRes content.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.056 A:middle
And that's app previews.

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:04.176 A:middle
Now we move on to App Bundles.

00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:09.456 A:middle
App Bundles is a great
feature to bundle together apps

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:14.006 A:middle
of the same kind, giving
your customers and people

00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.496 A:middle
on the App Store just
one choice instead

00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:16.756 A:middle
of many on what to download.

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:20.836 A:middle
The first step if you want to
have an app bundle is, well,

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:23.566 A:middle
what apps do I put in my bundle?

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.746 A:middle
So, you have all the apps

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:26.546 A:middle
in your head whether it's iTunes
Connect, and you're trying

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:28.026 A:middle
to think about it, you got
to choose some of them.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:28.996 A:middle
You can have up to 10.

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:31.876 A:middle
In this case I'm going
to pick four of them

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:33.206 A:middle
and create an app bundle.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:34.406 A:middle
And this is great.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.466 A:middle
It offers more value for
the people on the App Store.

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:41.066 A:middle
It's a single install to get
all of your great apps at once.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:44.456 A:middle
And we've included in
this Complete my Bundle.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:47.696 A:middle
It's the same feature we
give for music and for TV,

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:50.146 A:middle
where if somebody's already
purchased one or more

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:53.906 A:middle
of the apps in your bundle, then
they'll get a discounted price

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:56.166 A:middle
to purchase the rest of your
bundle to encourage them

00:09:56.336 --> 00:09:58.476 A:middle
to get all of your apps.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.646 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:06.576 A:middle
So that was step one, selecting
what apps go in my bundle.

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:09.456 A:middle
The next thing we're going
to want is the metadata

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:10.606 A:middle
to show in the iTunes store.

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.546 A:middle
We're going to need
a bundle name,

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:13.416 A:middle
we're going to need
a description.

00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:16.006 A:middle
It's probably going to need
screenshots, app preview,

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:20.476 A:middle
got to select categories,
rating, marketing URLs,

00:10:20.476 --> 00:10:22.126 A:middle
privacy URLs, all
these different pieces.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.866 A:middle
Because we want to make this
as simple as possible for you,

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.516 A:middle
and we realize that we have a
lot of this information already.

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:33.346 A:middle
So it starts with information
that is specific to the bundle.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.146 A:middle
Each bundle will
need its own name;

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:37.296 A:middle
it'll need a description
about the bundle.

00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.716 A:middle
Obviously it has its own
price, has its own SKU

00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:46.436 A:middle
and a marketing URL so you can
market this bundle on its own.

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.526 A:middle
And then we have
this information

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:50.656 A:middle
that comes from the first app.

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.996 A:middle
It was that key app, the
first app for this bundle.

00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:57.826 A:middle
So the first screenshot
will come from that app,

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.716 A:middle
the first app preview
that you see

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.046 A:middle
on the App Store will
come from that app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.046 A:middle
on the App Store will
come from that app.

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:04.996 A:middle
The categories of
your bundle will match

00:11:05.046 --> 00:11:09.246 A:middle
that of the first app, and the
App Store contact information,

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:11.696 A:middle
App review information,
all of that will be pulled

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:15.706 A:middle
from the first app as well,
as well as the privacy URL.

00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:22.176 A:middle
The rest of the information from
your bundle will come from all

00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:23.086 A:middle
of the apps in the bundle.

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:27.816 A:middle
If you have three apps that are
4 plus, and one app is 12 plus,

00:11:28.046 --> 00:11:29.676 A:middle
your bundle will
be rated 12 plus.

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
If you want your bundle to be
made for kids, all of the apps

00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:35.886 A:middle
in the bundle must
be made for kids.

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.946 A:middle
The rest of the screenshots
and app previews will come

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.186 A:middle
from the other apps in your
bundle - and equal share

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.396 A:middle
for every app in your bundle.

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:49.096 A:middle
And for keywords we'll take
all of the keywords from all

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:51.316 A:middle
of the apps in the
bundle and apply those.

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.156 A:middle
You don't have to
re-enter any new keywords.

00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:58.416 A:middle
Let's take a look and see how
we do this in iTunes Connect.

00:11:58.536 --> 00:11:59.926 A:middle
We come back to the
My Apps page.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:03.996 A:middle
We click New App Bundle.

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.856 A:middle
The first thing we want to enter

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.006 A:middle
as our new app bundle
name, "Toca Toy Box."

00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:12.976 A:middle
We start selecting the apps.

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.266 A:middle
At this point I realize, OK,

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.446 A:middle
this first app is
important, it's key.

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:25.486 A:middle
So, I know which four I
want in my app bundle,

00:12:26.286 --> 00:12:29.586 A:middle
but I would like to make
this one that primary app.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.336 A:middle
Once I've selected my apps,

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:36.456 A:middle
I can now see I have my
screenshots have already been

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.336 A:middle
populated for me
from that first app.

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:43.586 A:middle
I can fill in the app bundle
description, the marketing URL.

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:46.926 A:middle
Privacy policy URL
has already been done.

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:49.506 A:middle
Let's scroll down further.

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:52.276 A:middle
I need to select a price tier.

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:56.466 A:middle
It needs to be a discounted
price tier, less, one tier less

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:58.816 A:middle
than the sum of all the apps in
the bundle - it is a discount -

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.346 A:middle
as well as give it a SKU.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.346 A:middle
as well as give it a SKU.

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:03.226 A:middle
Then the rest of the information
has already been filled in:

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:05.616 A:middle
categories, the rating.

00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.716 A:middle
I'm good to go, at
this point I'm done.

00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:09.926 A:middle
I've created my app bundle,
I'm ready to submit it.

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:13.226 A:middle
One thing to remember
with app bundles is

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.176 A:middle
that once they've been submitted

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:15.866 A:middle
to the App Store you
can't change the apps

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:17.516 A:middle
in a bundle; they're immutable.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:22.476 A:middle
If you want to make a
bundle with now five apps

00:13:22.476 --> 00:13:23.646 A:middle
or six apps instead
of this four,

00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:25.276 A:middle
then just create a
new bundle and submit

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:25.966 A:middle
that to the App Store.

00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:28.936 A:middle
Here's what it looks
like on the App Store.

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.426 A:middle
You can see your app icon.

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:32.426 A:middle
You can see all the
apps in the bundle.

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:36.676 A:middle
The app preview and
screenshots come down below.

00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:41.286 A:middle
You can have up to 10 paid
apps in an app bundle.

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.696 A:middle
You have to give it
that discounted price.

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:49.506 A:middle
The first preview and screenshot
come from that first app.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.266 A:middle
We're going to link
to all the other apps

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:53.006 A:middle
in your bundle right
there on the App Store.

00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:55.066 A:middle

people who have already
purchased one or more

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.706 A:middle

Really excited today to show
you what we've been up to.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
Before we get into it,

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:26.316 A:middle
let's talk about what it
takes to build a great app.

00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:28.716 A:middle
We're all here this week
to learn tips and tricks

00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:29.936 A:middle
on building a great app.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.866 A:middle
We know that it all
starts with a great idea.

00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:35.526 A:middle
Every app that's
in the store today

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.936 A:middle
that achieves great success
starts with a great idea,

00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:41.846 A:middle
and how do you capture that and
present that to your customers?

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.826 A:middle
You do that with
thoughtful design,

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.576 A:middle
pixel-perfect design,
intuitive design.

00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:49.326 A:middle
You focus on really
complete flows

00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:50.946 A:middle
that make sense to
your customers.

00:14:51.396 --> 00:14:55.126 A:middle
We write bug-free code, we
all here write bug-free code.

00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:57.436 A:middle
Worked on my device.

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.356 A:middle
We test, and we test,
and we test some more.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

We test, and we test,
and we test some more.

00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:04.626 A:middle
So, we have automated unit
tests, automated UI tests.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:05.356 A:middle
We're going to talk more

00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:07.466 A:middle
about our beta testing
service as well.

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.716 A:middle
This is a really
important part of writing

00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:11.506 A:middle
and creating a great app.

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:13.836 A:middle
Finally, we submit to the store.

00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:17.176 A:middle
These are all pieces,
developer responsibility

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.146 A:middle
that we're familiar with today,

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:21.506 A:middle
and Apple does a fantastic job
supporting you throughout this

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.686 A:middle
process, with great tools,
with Xcode, more great tools

00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:26.056 A:middle
and services we're
talking about today.

00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:29.646 A:middle
But we know that our job
is not done as developers.

00:15:29.776 --> 00:15:31.056 A:middle
Once we submit to the store,

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.116 A:middle
there's this whole new
set of responsibilities.

00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:34.416 A:middle
We're not all done.

00:15:35.876 --> 00:15:37.406 A:middle
And this is after launch.

00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:39.426 A:middle
And this is what App
Analytics is all about.

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:43.276 A:middle
These new responsibilities
can influence this chart.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.836 A:middle
Hopefully, if you have
apps in the store,

00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:47.226 A:middle
this chart is familiar to you.

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:50.136 A:middle
You have your downloads
over time, it's increasing,

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:53.546 A:middle
and you see points of
acceleration over time as well.

00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:55.796 A:middle
Let's talk about what it
takes to influence that,

00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:57.736 A:middle
and why App Analytics
is really important.

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.366 A:middle
So first, our App
Store presence.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.366 A:middle
So first, our App
Store presence.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.356 A:middle
We can see on this chart now I
have that orange dot and I see

00:16:04.356 --> 00:16:10.506 A:middle
that App Store presence really
can influence my downloads.

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:15.806 A:middle
App Store presence is your name,
your description, your keywords.

00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:17.386 A:middle
We have these App Bundles now.

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:19.706 A:middle
We also have our
App Store previews.

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.796 A:middle
These are great ways to get
your app to have more downloads,

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.556 A:middle
more customers, more
people using your app.

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:26.656 A:middle
Marketing.

00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:29.066 A:middle
Once you have a great app
you want to get the word out.

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.776 A:middle
As developers, we don't
just submit to the store,

00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.416 A:middle
we submit it to our
social networks,

00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.946 A:middle
we send it to our
friends and our family.

00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:37.676 A:middle
We create a home page,
potentially some newsletters.

00:16:38.056 --> 00:16:39.616 A:middle
Marketing's a really
important piece.

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.236 A:middle
New updates.

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:43.966 A:middle
When you're building an
application and submit it

00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:47.046 A:middle
to the store your
customers crave new content.

00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:54.706 A:middle
New levels, new ways to engage
existing customers and new ways

00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:55.876 A:middle
to attract more customers.

00:16:56.156 --> 00:17:00.046 A:middle
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:56.156 --> 00:17:00.046 A:middle
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go

00:17:00.046 --> 00:17:02.306 A:middle
through this constant
release and build cycle.

00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.126 A:middle
Next is advertising.

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.506 A:middle
Advertising and marketing
are often used

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:09.976 A:middle
in the same vocabulary,

00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:11.566 A:middle
but advertising's a
little bit different.

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:15.406 A:middle
As a developer you may choose
to pay for advertising,

00:17:15.406 --> 00:17:16.415 A:middle
and that's a big decision.

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:19.846 A:middle
You want to know if it was worth
the advertising investment,

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.606 A:middle
if you got a nice
return on that.

00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:24.846 A:middle
App Analytics is there to help
you inform those decisions.

00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:32.156 A:middle
All of these dots, all these
lines, you want to monitor,

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.916 A:middle
measure and see how
they're changing over time,

00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:37.636 A:middle
and App Analytics is there
to provide those answers.

00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.136 A:middle
And that is why we
use App Analytics.

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.186 A:middle
Because App Analytics
provides answers.

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:46.986 A:middle
It helps you answer questions
like, "How's my app doing?

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:51.586 A:middle
Are people returning to my app?"

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:53.606 A:middle
Are people converting on
your In-App Purchases?

00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:58.916 A:middle
App Analytics helps you make
good advertising decisions.

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:02.436 A:middle
And this is one I'm
really excited about.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:02.436 A:middle
And this is one I'm
really excited about.

00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:04.736 A:middle
App Analytics helps you
reveal missed opportunities.

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:06.746 A:middle
With App Analytics you can see

00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:09.576 A:middle
that your App Store presence
is great in the United States,

00:18:09.576 --> 00:18:12.156 A:middle
and a lot of customers
are looking at your app

00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:13.946 A:middle
in the United States
and actually turning

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:16.976 A:middle
into real customers as
opposed to potential customers.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.696 A:middle
The same may not be
the case in Germany.

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:24.446 A:middle
With App Analytics we can see
that the potential customers

00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.566 A:middle
in Germany can become
actual customers if we focus

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:30.366 A:middle
on our German App Store
presence, localization,

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:33.236 A:middle
really understanding the German
culture and understanding

00:18:33.236 --> 00:18:37.826 A:middle
that marketing to Germany may be
a completely different animal,

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.836 A:middle
and we can do that with
our App Store presence,

00:18:40.046 --> 00:18:42.256 A:middle
and App Analytics can
point out those areas.

00:18:43.436 --> 00:18:46.886 A:middle
Finally, after we launch, it's
all about building a better app,

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.626 A:middle
and App Analytics is there
to tell us and point us

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:50.776 A:middle
in the right direction
to do that.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.386 A:middle
That is why App Analytics
is important.

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:59.466 A:middle
So with that, how do we
look at this at Apple?

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.626 A:middle
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.626 A:middle
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.146 A:middle
in the service for
app developers?

00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:06.746 A:middle
We're focusing on this concept
of the customer lifecycle,

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:10.026 A:middle
and this involves
acquisition to engagement.

00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:11.826 A:middle
We want you as developers
to be covered

00:19:11.826 --> 00:19:13.556 A:middle
from the point your
app hits the store

00:19:13.556 --> 00:19:15.416 A:middle
to the point your
customers are using the app.

00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:17.656 A:middle
And let's look at that from
the customer's perspective.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:19.526 A:middle
And we start with
our first measure.

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.516 A:middle
Here is your App
Store product page.

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:24.586 A:middle
We have "Trip Guider," an app we
made up for this presentation.

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.756 A:middle
The first thing we see
is App Store views.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.876 A:middle
We're really excited that for
the first time Apple's providing

00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:33.826 A:middle
you developers with a view
of your App Store Views.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:34.956 A:middle
All - thank you.

00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:39.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:41.806 A:middle
This is data only
Apple can provide.

00:19:41.926 --> 00:19:44.466 A:middle
It comes straight from the
App Store to you developers.

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.436 A:middle
Next we have App
units and sales.

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:52.686 A:middle
This data here gets tracked any
time a potential customer turns

00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:53.916 A:middle
into an actual customer

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:56.296 A:middle
and touches your Buy button
inside your product page.

00:19:56.766 --> 00:19:58.986 A:middle
You have this data today
in Sales and Trends

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:01.866 A:middle
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:01.866 A:middle
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.166 A:middle
We're tying this data

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.086 A:middle
into a complete picture
with App Store views.

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:07.946 A:middle
For the first time you can
see your App Store views,

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:10.356 A:middle
and how that drops
for App units.

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:16.036 A:middle
Next, we've combined App
Store data, Billings data,

00:20:16.036 --> 00:20:17.846 A:middle
and now we have Device data.

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:19.306 A:middle
We have Installs.

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.916 A:middle
A customer purchases
your application

00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:25.026 A:middle
but they may install
it on multiple devices,

00:20:25.086 --> 00:20:28.686 A:middle
and this is why Installs and App
units are two different metrics.

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:33.376 A:middle
Once your customer installs the
application and starts engaging,

00:20:33.626 --> 00:20:36.286 A:middle
we have a new world
with device measures.

00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:39.236 A:middle
We have Sessions,
Active devices.

00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:40.856 A:middle
We have Retention.

00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:42.866 A:middle
We have this concept
of Stickiness as well.

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:45.246 A:middle
Stickiness is great:
It's a single measure

00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:48.376 A:middle
that you can track over time to
insure that you're both growing

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:49.836 A:middle
and retaining customers.

00:20:49.876 --> 00:20:52.536 A:middle
If there's one measure you want
to look at, it's stickiness.

00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:57.976 A:middle
Finally, if your application
has In-App Purchases,

00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:58.926 A:middle
we track that as well.

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:02.476 A:middle
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:02.476 A:middle
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle

00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:05.476 A:middle
from the point the user
became a real customer

00:21:05.986 --> 00:21:07.816 A:middle
to when they're converting
on Internet purchases.

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:09.786 A:middle
This concept of average sales,

00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:13.096 A:middle
if you're using any
business intelligence today,

00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:15.446 A:middle
you may be looking at
average revenue per user.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.006 A:middle
This is average sales.

00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:17.766 A:middle
We provide that.

00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:18.956 A:middle
This in combination

00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.026 A:middle
with stickiness can tell
you a really powerful story

00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:24.486 A:middle
of how your app's doing and how
your customers are performing.

00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:27.876 A:middle
So, that's the customer's
view of this.

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:29.476 A:middle
Let's look at your
view, the developer.

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.636 A:middle
We have our App Store views,
we have our App Units,

00:21:33.236 --> 00:21:35.406 A:middle
Active Devices, Retention,
In-App Purchases.

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:38.136 A:middle
This funnel starts to
drop, and that makes sense

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:40.706 A:middle
because not every
potential customer becomes an

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:41.496 A:middle
actual customer.

00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:46.586 A:middle
What does this look like when
we start to ask more questions?

00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:48.096 A:middle
How does this look by platform?

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:52.466 A:middle
We start to filter this data
by iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch.

00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:56.406 A:middle
We can see the composition of
our App Store views across all

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.436 A:middle
of the Apple platforms.

00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.616 A:middle
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.616 A:middle
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:04.736 A:middle
"Should I be localizing
for Germany?"

00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:07.226 A:middle
Here, I can see my
apps reviews in Europe.

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:10.876 A:middle
It's quite high, but my app
units in Europe, a little lower,

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.786 A:middle
and this makes sense as well,

00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:14.256 A:middle
and there's an opportunity
there.

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:17.596 A:middle
This is where analytics can help
you reveal missed opportunities.

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.166 A:middle
If we just localize our app,

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:21.746 A:middle
potentially we can
get more app units

00:22:22.026 --> 00:22:25.426 A:middle
and that will help us get more
active devices, more retention,

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:26.836 A:middle
more In-App Purchases.

00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:29.146 A:middle
Maybe it's that simple,
and we don't have

00:22:29.146 --> 00:22:31.236 A:middle
to release another
version of our app

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:32.896 A:middle
to get more downloads
in Germany.

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:36.136 A:middle
So this is great.

00:22:36.706 --> 00:22:38.426 A:middle
Let's talk about what
it actually looks like

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:40.496 A:middle
and show you guys what
we've been working on.

00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:41.356 A:middle
I think that's why we're here.

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:45.976 A:middle
App Analytics shows up as a
new feature inside the new

00:22:45.976 --> 00:22:46.686 A:middle
iTunes Connect.

00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:49.746 A:middle
It's here beside My Apps.

00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:52.326 A:middle
The first view that we see

00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:55.606 A:middle
when we click inside
Analytics is our App List.

00:22:55.856 --> 00:22:58.036 A:middle
This is the older view of
your entire mobile business.

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.586 A:middle
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.586 A:middle
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.

00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:03.416 A:middle
I can see all of my
other apps in my suite.

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.346 A:middle
I can see filters.

00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:09.526 A:middle
I can see the ability to
change my time, my date.

00:23:10.376 --> 00:23:11.476 A:middle
Let's look at these metrics.

00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:14.016 A:middle
So, here is the key
vitals for an application.

00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:16.016 A:middle
Going from the left
to the right,

00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:17.556 A:middle
I see that lifecycle again.

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.406 A:middle
It's consistent.

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.826 A:middle
Start with My App Store
views and then My App Units.

00:23:21.226 --> 00:23:24.026 A:middle
I see my Sessions and my Sales.

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:30.016 A:middle
See if they're rising,
falling in this period.

00:23:30.106 --> 00:23:32.336 A:middle
I hover over these, I get
tool tips telling me what the

00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:33.566 A:middle
previous period was as well.

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:35.496 A:middle
I can select one.

00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.176 A:middle
Selecting one of these brings us
into the heart of this product

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:39.306 A:middle
which is our Metrics Page.

00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:42.006 A:middle
The first thing you'll
notice is that great trend.

00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:43.716 A:middle
We can see how we're
doing over time

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.516 A:middle
and this situation we're
looking at, data from May.

00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:50.336 A:middle
I can see over May that my
application is increasing

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:51.926 A:middle
in App Store views,
which is awesome.

00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:54.156 A:middle
I can also change
my interval below.

00:23:54.156 --> 00:23:56.746 A:middle
I can change this from
Days to Weeks to Months.

00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.406 A:middle
Let's talk about
those measures again.

00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.946 A:middle
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.946 A:middle
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.

00:24:01.946 --> 00:24:04.186 A:middle
I have my Sales, my Store Data.

00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:07.006 A:middle
I have my Engagement
Data, my Device Data.

00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:09.866 A:middle
I can select any of these
and change the chart.

00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:13.406 A:middle
Let's look at breaking this
down by a particular platform.

00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:17.596 A:middle
I select View By and now I can
see how this actually looks

00:24:18.176 --> 00:24:20.306 A:middle
across all of the Apple devices.

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:24.576 A:middle
I can see my iPhone, my iPad,
my iPod touch, and it looks

00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:26.526 A:middle
like the trend is about
the same on all of them.

00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:27.996 A:middle
They're all performing
equally in this case.

00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:28.386 A:middle
It's great.

00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:31.726 A:middle
But a customer can't
have an iPhone

00:24:31.896 --> 00:24:34.306 A:middle
and an iPad at the same time.

00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:35.516 A:middle
They're not the same device.

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:36.556 A:middle
They're two different devices.

00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:38.856 A:middle
So, we look at that
as a stacked area.

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:42.966 A:middle
I go to Chart Type, I select
Stacked Area, like that.

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:47.436 A:middle
I can now see the composition
of iPhone, iPod, iPod touch,

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:50.106 A:middle
and the sum of these
will equal 100 percent

00:24:50.106 --> 00:24:51.436 A:middle
of whatever metric
I'm looking at.

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.676 A:middle
There's different chart types
for different scenarios,

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:59.326 A:middle
and looking at App Store Views,
here - Area looks the best.

00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
We'll choose the
sensible default based


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
We'll choose the
sensible default based

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.866 A:middle
on the measure you're
looking at.

00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:05.526 A:middle
Let's swap to another measure.

00:25:05.736 --> 00:25:06.846 A:middle
Look at App Store Units.

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:08.596 A:middle
Here, there's no issues here.

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:12.616 A:middle
Analytics is providing an
answer that my conversions

00:25:12.616 --> 00:25:16.416 A:middle
from page views to App Units
hasn't dropped drastically.

00:25:16.676 --> 00:25:19.056 A:middle
It's a little bit lower,
but the trend is the same,

00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:20.966 A:middle
and on both devices
it's the same.

00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:23.146 A:middle
So, not a lot of opportunity

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:26.096 A:middle
to improve my iPad
App Store presence

00:25:26.476 --> 00:25:28.216 A:middle
because it's performing
the same as my iPhone.

00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:29.486 A:middle
Maybe I improve them
all together.

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:33.026 A:middle
Let's go to another
measure In-App Purchases,

00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:37.256 A:middle
and this is where our team
decided that on May 15th,

00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:39.866 A:middle
we would lower the price
of In-App Purchases,

00:25:40.236 --> 00:25:42.806 A:middle
and as a result, we got
a lot more app purchases

00:25:42.806 --> 00:25:45.566 A:middle
that occurred, and we can
see that with App Analytics.

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:47.536 A:middle
We can see the spike there -

00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:49.516 A:middle
we can see that across
all platforms,

00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:52.946 A:middle
it performed much better
as a result of our change.

00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:57.786 A:middle
We also had intuition

00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:03.526 A:middle
customers more content,
and that would result

00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:05.886 A:middle
in more engagement,
more active devices.

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:10.136 A:middle
So with that, we select
In-App Purchases, Compare To,

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:15.706 A:middle
select Active Devices, and now
we see our Active Devices went

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:17.326 A:middle
up as did our In-App Purchases.

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:18.426 A:middle
I can see these layer on top

00:26:18.426 --> 00:26:21.306 A:middle
of each other telling
me the story that, "Yes,

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:25.616 A:middle
our changes to In-App Purchases
really did impact Active Devices

00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:26.006 A:middle
as well."

00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:28.566 A:middle
We've got more revenue
from our In-App Purchases,

00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:31.766 A:middle
and we've got more
retention and more engagement

00:26:31.766 --> 00:26:32.856 A:middle
from our Active Devices.

00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:38.146 A:middle
So, that's Metrics, and that's
the measures that we provide.

00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:40.196 A:middle
There's some questions
we haven't answered yet,

00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.456 A:middle
and we're going to
answer that with Sources.

00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:45.226 A:middle
So, what are Sources?

00:26:45.716 --> 00:26:48.826 A:middle
Sources are all about
how people find your app.

00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:51.996 A:middle
As developers, you work
really hard on your app,

00:26:51.996 --> 00:26:56.056 A:middle
your App Store presence, and
you have no idea right now how

00:26:56.056 --> 00:26:57.686 A:middle
people are getting to
your App Store page.

00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.296 A:middle
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.296 A:middle
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.

00:27:01.076 --> 00:27:02.656 A:middle
There's two types.

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:07.386 A:middle
We have websites, and
we have campaigns.

00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:08.726 A:middle
Websites are really simple.

00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:10.246 A:middle
It's a link to your
App Store page.

00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.756 A:middle
You're familiar with
these links today.

00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:14.646 A:middle
Any time you hand a link to
your friends, to your family,

00:27:14.646 --> 00:27:18.026 A:middle
to your marketing sites, that
link is now trapped in the form

00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:21.446 A:middle
of a website as a refer,
as a Source, and we can see

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:22.676 A:middle
that in App Analytics.

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:26.756 A:middle
And Campaigns are that same
link with the campaign ID.

00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:29.086 A:middle
This is a friendly
link - friendly name

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:30.366 A:middle
that you supply to the URL.

00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:32.076 A:middle
Let's talk about
what that looks like.

00:27:32.676 --> 00:27:33.366 A:middle
It's really simple.

00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:35.706 A:middle
This is the URL that
hopefully you're familiar with.

00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:39.006 A:middle
We add a Provider ID.

00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:41.946 A:middle
We get this Provider ID
inside iTunes Connect,

00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:44.576 A:middle
and then you add
your Campaign ID.

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.346 A:middle
Friendly Name, you want
it as friendly as possible

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:49.936 A:middle
because you're going to
view this name afterwards -

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:53.166 A:middle
we'll show you that in a second
- inside your Sources Lists.

00:27:54.316 --> 00:27:56.176 A:middle
If you're using iAd today

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:58.816 A:middle
to advertise your
application, this is automatic.

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:03.086 A:middle
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:03.086 A:middle
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names

00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:05.006 A:middle
for the purposes
of App Analytics.

00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:06.916 A:middle
It will all happen seamlessly.

00:28:07.176 --> 00:28:10.096 A:middle
Any campaign you create in iAd
will be automatically tracked

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:12.666 A:middle
and available inside
App Analytics

00:28:12.826 --> 00:28:14.546 A:middle
and you can really
see the effectiveness

00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:17.236 A:middle
of that inside App
Analytics without any effort.

00:28:17.286 --> 00:28:19.706 A:middle
So what does this look like?

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:21.636 A:middle
Come here, we select Sources

00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.946 A:middle
and get brought to
the Sources Lists.

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.086 A:middle
Here, I see my Top Websites.

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:29.146 A:middle
Beside that I can
see Top Campaigns.

00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:31.836 A:middle
I have the same key
vitals that I had

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.316 A:middle
on my application list as well.

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:36.876 A:middle
We're really trying to reinforce
the story of acquisition

00:28:36.876 --> 00:28:39.456 A:middle
to engagement and keep it
consistent for you guys.

00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:43.446 A:middle
I select Top Campaigns.

00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:45.276 A:middle
I get brought over to
my Top Campaigns List.

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:48.536 A:middle
These are a view of all those
friendly names that we set up.

00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:50.716 A:middle
Let's zoom in on
one of these here.

00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:52.296 A:middle
I can see "Spring Email Blast."

00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:53.286 A:middle
That was my friendly name.

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:56.756 A:middle
I see My App Store
views, my units, my sales,

00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:58.776 A:middle
and my sessions,
that same lifecycle.

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:00.516 A:middle
This is great.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:00.516 A:middle
This is great.

00:29:00.516 --> 00:29:03.896 A:middle
We select that, and we're
into this Source Details.

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:05.886 A:middle
We think that if
you're marketers,

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:06.916 A:middle
you're going to love this page.

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:07.926 A:middle
You're going to sit
on this page.

00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:09.346 A:middle
You're going to share
it with your colleagues.

00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:12.456 A:middle
We can see all of
those key measures.

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.316 A:middle
It's a nice visual.

00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:15.396 A:middle
We see it broken down
over time as well.

00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:17.616 A:middle
Every day has a bar
on these Key Measures.

00:29:17.866 --> 00:29:19.456 A:middle
We also see additional measures

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:21.826 A:middle
that you can only get
on the Metrics Page.

00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:26.936 A:middle
You can see this broken down by
different data types as well.

00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:29.476 A:middle
So, here we're looking for
App Store views by Region,

00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.466 A:middle
by Territory, by Platform.

00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:34.226 A:middle
Changing those dropdowns,
I can change the measure

00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:36.826 A:middle
that I'm looking at and see
exactly how this campaign is

00:29:36.826 --> 00:29:39.686 A:middle
performing, how this
website is performing,

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:43.146 A:middle
and what exactly the
customers are doing as well.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:47.146 A:middle
So that's Sources.

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.236 A:middle
We think that you're going
to love Sources today.

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:51.256 A:middle
You know that people are
downloading your app,

00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:52.096 A:middle
installing the app.

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:53.906 A:middle
What you don't know is
where they're coming from,

00:29:53.906 --> 00:29:55.496 A:middle
and we're solving that problem.

00:29:56.846 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
So, we've answered the question,
how are people doing in the app?

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?

00:30:02.016 --> 00:30:02.906 A:middle
Where are they coming from?

00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:06.656 A:middle
We haven't answered in
detail, "Are people returning

00:30:06.656 --> 00:30:07.936 A:middle
or are they retained?"

00:30:08.326 --> 00:30:10.156 A:middle
What does that side of
the lifecycle look like?

00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:11.966 A:middle
And we answer that
with retention.

00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:15.636 A:middle
Let's just do a quick education

00:30:15.636 --> 00:30:17.096 A:middle
on retention, why
it's important.

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:18.816 A:middle
This is obvious.

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.266 A:middle
One-hundred percent of your
customers are customers

00:30:21.266 --> 00:30:22.136 A:middle
on the purchased date.

00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:23.376 A:middle
It's really simple.

00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:29.796 A:middle
Moving along, 45 percent
are customers on Day 2,

00:30:30.426 --> 00:30:33.866 A:middle
35 percent on Day 7, and
20 percent on Day 30.

00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:35.816 A:middle
Hopefully these numbers
aren't scary,

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.836 A:middle
but there's an opportunity
there.

00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:40.596 A:middle
You can get them higher
and higher - focus on this,

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:42.916 A:middle
it's really important because
if you have no more customers

00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:46.906 A:middle
at Day 30 or 90, you're
really going to have to focus

00:30:46.906 --> 00:30:49.466 A:middle
on the next stop or
improving your content

00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:50.456 A:middle
in your marketing to get more.

00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:53.796 A:middle
How do we show this in the UI?

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:57.216 A:middle
Select retention, and I
can see my purchase date

00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:58.976 A:middle
on the left, May 23.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.866 A:middle
I can see my days
later on the right.

00:31:02.076 --> 00:31:06.746 A:middle
Here I'm looking at Day 7,
and there's a little story.

00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:10.786 A:middle
So of the active devices
that purchase on May 23,

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:14.786 A:middle
18 percent remained
active seven days later.

00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:16.226 A:middle
This is great - single view

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:18.886 A:middle
of how my retention
on May 23 was doing.

00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:22.436 A:middle
As developers, as
marketers, product managers,

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:24.386 A:middle
we want to look at this with all

00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.416 A:middle
of our purchase dates
stacked on top of each other.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.806 A:middle
So that's the view
that we're providing.

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:32.396 A:middle
The same on May 24th, and
now we show you the rest

00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:33.156 A:middle
of this matrix.

00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:35.946 A:middle
So, May 23rd to June 3rd,

00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:39.506 A:middle
I can see my retention
stacked a single quick view

00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:41.596 A:middle
of how my Day 7 retention is,

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:45.016 A:middle
and you don't have
to do anything.

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:45.886 A:middle
This is amazing.

00:31:46.046 --> 00:31:47.966 A:middle
So, we're providing -

00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:59.086 A:middle

What do you need to do?

00:32:00.946 --> 00:32:05.626 A:middle
Nothing. There's no SDK,
no third party code running

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:06.976 A:middle
in your apps, no
performance degradation.

You don't have to
write any new code.

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:18.326 A:middle
This is not an Apple provided
library that you have to embed

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:20.436 A:middle
in your app, and you don't
have to instantiate it,

00:32:20.436 --> 00:32:22.686 A:middle
initialize it, no
code is required,

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:25.116 A:middle
no app updates required.

00:32:25.186 --> 00:32:27.456 A:middle
You do not have to
recompile, re-sign,

00:32:27.456 --> 00:32:28.836 A:middle
resubmit your app to the store.

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.676 A:middle
You really have to do nothing
to take advantage of this.

00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:34.106 A:middle
We're doing this
because it's all built

00:32:34.106 --> 00:32:36.286 A:middle
into the App Store and iOS 8.

00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:40.346 A:middle
Everything from the store
metrics to the sales metrics,

00:32:40.346 --> 00:32:42.246 A:middle
to the device metrics,
this is all automatic

00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.386 A:middle
in the App Store in iOS 8.

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:48.146 A:middle
And what have we kept in
mind while doing this?

00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:52.326 A:middle
Privacy. So App Analytics has
been a really highly requested

00:32:52.326 --> 00:32:53.856 A:middle
feature of iTunes Connect.

00:32:54.346 --> 00:32:56.236 A:middle
We're excited to bring it to
you guys, and we're excited

00:32:56.236 --> 00:32:58.556 A:middle
to bring it to you with
privacy at the forefront.

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:09.836 A:middle
Apple is providing App Analytics
as a service to the developers,

building this product,

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:23.226 A:middle
as this product rolls out, the
privacy is at the forefront.

We're not making any
compromises in this area.

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:27.146 A:middle
We're really excited about that,

00:33:27.146 --> 00:33:29.286 A:middle
and we think that's
a really unique thing

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:29.996 A:middle
that we're offering.

00:33:32.246 --> 00:33:34.076 A:middle
Finally, maybe the
best news: It's free.

00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:35.976 A:middle
App Analytics is
completely free.

Hi, my name is Daniel Miao.

00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:10.626 A:middle
I'm a Software Engineer
on iTunes Connect.

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:14.186 A:middle
Now, most of you heard during
Tim's keynote on Monday

00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:16.206 A:middle
that we're announcing
TestFlight Beta Testing.

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:19.346 A:middle
Well we're very excited to
have this opportunity today

00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:21.696 A:middle
to bring you more details
about this great feature.

00:34:23.136 --> 00:34:24.696 A:middle
Now, before we get started,

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:29.196 A:middle
how many of you used
TestFlight in the past?

00:34:29.376 --> 00:34:33.496 A:middle
Great. Well whether you've
used TestFlight or not,

00:34:33.996 --> 00:34:35.456 A:middle
I'm sure we can all agree

00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:39.485 A:middle
that great beta testing
tools go a long way.

00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:47.206 A:middle
We'd all like to see less
of these, and more of these.

00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:51.576 A:middle
So before we get into the
details, let's talk a little bit

00:34:51.576 --> 00:34:53.866 A:middle
about the history of
beta distribution.

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.775 A:middle
In the beginning,

00:34:57.136 --> 00:35:02.486 A:middle
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.136 --> 00:35:02.486 A:middle
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.

00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.286 A:middle
Whenever you wanted to test
your app on your device,

00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:08.846 A:middle
you would connect your
device to your computer,

00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:11.476 A:middle
transfer your binary
over and test from there.

00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:15.696 A:middle
At some point you probably
decided it'd be helpful

00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.496 A:middle
to have others also take a look

00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.576 A:middle
at your app before you
publish it to the App Store.

00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:22.556 A:middle
So each time you
wanted to add a tester,

00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:25.196 A:middle
you would ask the tester
for the device UDID.

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:28.116 A:middle
You would go to the
developer portal,

00:35:28.156 --> 00:35:30.096 A:middle
set up provisioning profiles.

00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:34.346 A:middle
And then you would send
your tester the binary.

00:35:34.346 --> 00:35:36.896 A:middle
They would connect their
device to their computer,

00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:39.656 A:middle
transfer the binary over,
and they would start testing.

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:41.816 A:middle
Of course you would
have to do this

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:43.466 A:middle
for every single
one of your testers.

00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:47.436 A:middle
So, what do we do for
you during this period?

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:50.386 A:middle
How did we change your beta
distribution experience?

00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:54.916 A:middle
Well we went from this, to this.

00:35:54.916 --> 00:36:00.026 A:middle
We think we can do better.

We think we can do better.

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:02.846 A:middle
With the new TestFlight
Beta Testing platform,

00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:15.146 A:middle
you can distribute your apps
to not one, not 100, not 500,

00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:21.686 A:middle
but up to 1,000 testers.

00:36:27.056 --> 00:36:30.096 A:middle
Now these are testers,
not devices.

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:36.446 A:middle
In fact, each of your testers
can test on multiple devices.

00:36:39.996 --> 00:36:42.286 A:middle
Next, UDID and provisioning
profiles.

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:47.976 A:middle
You no longer need
to worry about these.

[ Applause ]

00:36:57.366 --> 00:36:59.986 A:middle
All you need to get a tester
started is an email address.

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.086 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.086 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.556 A:middle
about the two sides
of the new platform.

00:37:05.916 --> 00:37:07.576 A:middle
You start out in iTunes Connect.

00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:09.716 A:middle
As you work on your project,

00:37:09.716 --> 00:37:11.356 A:middle
you upload your builds
to iTunes Connect.

00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:15.156 A:middle
And from iTunes Connect you
can manage these builds,

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:20.946 A:middle
manage the testers, distribute
these builds to your testers,

00:37:21.566 --> 00:37:25.066 A:middle
and as they're testing,
you can come back

00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:27.246 A:middle
to get insight into
their activity.

00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:33.986 A:middle
Now once your testers receive
an invitation to TestFlight,

00:37:34.826 --> 00:37:40.056 A:middle
I mean to to test your app, they
download the TestFlight iOS app,

00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:43.196 A:middle
and from here they can
manage what apps they want,

00:37:43.196 --> 00:37:43.786 A:middle
they're testing.

00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:47.696 A:middle
They can perform one-tap
installs and updates,

00:37:47.736 --> 00:37:51.546 A:middle
and they can send you feedback.

00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:57.896 A:middle
So, while we were working on
these features, we discovered

00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:01.416 A:middle
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:01.416 A:middle
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,

00:38:02.226 --> 00:38:05.066 A:middle
everything from iterating
with your development team

00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:07.306 A:middle
to distributing to
a wider audience,

00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:10.766 A:middle
so we came up with
internal and beta testers.

00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:16.326 A:middle
Now internal testers are made
up of your iTunes Connect users.

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:21.756 A:middle
A beta tester is anyone
with an email address.

00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:26.586 A:middle
You can have up to 25
internal testers and up

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:30.196 A:middle
to 1,000 beta testers.

00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:35.406 A:middle
As you upload builds
to iTunes Connect,

00:38:35.526 --> 00:38:38.126 A:middle
your internal testers
will have access

00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:43.446 A:middle
to these builds right away, and
beta app review will be required

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.366 A:middle
to unlock your 1,000 testers.

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:48.736 A:middle
But while your build is in
review, you can continue

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:51.586 A:middle
to upload new builds, and your
internal testers can continue

00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:53.496 A:middle
to test, and you can continue

00:38:53.496 --> 00:38:55.606 A:middle
to manage your testers
in iTunes Connect.

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.496 A:middle
Finally, Sandbox Accounts.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.496 A:middle
Finally, Sandbox Accounts.

00:39:00.646 --> 00:39:04.626 A:middle
As each of your testers
signs into the iOS App

00:39:04.626 --> 00:39:09.176 A:middle
for the first time, they'll
automatically have a Sandbox

00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:11.046 A:middle
Account created for them.

00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:13.426 A:middle
What this means is that
you don't need to come

00:39:13.426 --> 00:39:15.556 A:middle
into iTunes Connect anymore
to create test accounts.

00:39:16.476 --> 00:39:18.526 A:middle
We want your testers to be
able to test all aspects

00:39:18.526 --> 00:39:21.296 A:middle
of your application
including in-app purchases.

00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:25.706 A:middle
So let's see what
this all looks like.

00:39:27.976 --> 00:39:31.246 A:middle
Here we are, we're back
on the version page

00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:35.376 A:middle
of the new iTunes Connect, and
you'll notice a Prerelease tab.

00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
If you click this, we'll
see a list of the builds

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:41.016 A:middle
that we uploaded in Xcode.

00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:44.746 A:middle
So let's say you want to
test build number 103.

00:39:45.996 --> 00:39:48.416 A:middle
In order to do this, we
first have to enter metadata

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.826 A:middle
for our testers so they
have something to see

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:51.916 A:middle
when they receive
their invitation.

00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:59.786 A:middle
So we click into this build, we
enter things like a description,

00:39:59.786 --> 00:40:03.086 A:middle
and we also tell the
tester what we like them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.786 --> 00:40:03.086 A:middle
and we also tell the
tester what we like them

00:40:03.086 --> 00:40:08.146 A:middle
to test specifically
on this build.

00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:14.346 A:middle
After we've had this information
inputted, we hit Save,

00:40:14.476 --> 00:40:16.186 A:middle
and we come back
to the Build List.

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:21.346 A:middle
Once we're on the Build
List, we come to the corner,

00:40:22.426 --> 00:40:25.356 A:middle
we click the Testing
Switch, turn on testing,

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.866 A:middle
and that build is now available
to our internal testers.

00:40:28.866 --> 00:40:33.626 A:middle
So let's say we want
to upload another build

00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:40.406 A:middle
to our internal testers, keep
entering, maybe upload one more.

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:44.856 A:middle
Now, we're confident that
105 is a build that we want

00:40:44.856 --> 00:40:47.816 A:middle
to distribute more broadly
to our beta testers.

00:40:48.216 --> 00:40:52.166 A:middle
In order to do this, we
click the Submit button next

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:57.386 A:middle
to the build, and after review,

00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:00.306 A:middle
this is now also available
to our beta testers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:00.306 A:middle
this is now also available
to our beta testers.

00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:04.396 A:middle
You'll notice here that
there's a 30-day expiration

00:41:04.396 --> 00:41:06.386 A:middle
on this build so we know
exactly when we need

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:08.436 A:middle
to upload the next
build for our testers.

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:14.416 A:middle
Now let's take a look at
managing beta testers.

00:41:18.856 --> 00:41:20.896 A:middle
Here we are on the
Beta Testers list.

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:25.046 A:middle
We see everybody that
we added or invited.

00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:26.836 A:middle
We see what they're doing.

00:41:27.476 --> 00:41:29.826 A:middle
We can see that some of our
testers have installed the app

00:41:29.826 --> 00:41:30.966 A:middle
and they're already testing.

00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:34.086 A:middle
Some of them have
accepted the invite

00:41:34.086 --> 00:41:35.536 A:middle
but haven't installed yet,

00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:39.776 A:middle
and some have not even
accepted the invitations yet.

00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:43.046 A:middle
For the ones who have installed,
we see the latest build

00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:43.806 A:middle
that they've installed.

00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:50.006 A:middle
And if we want to add another
tester, we come up here

00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:52.726 A:middle
to the top, we click
the Plus button,

00:41:53.296 --> 00:41:58.686 A:middle
add a few email addresses,
hit Submit

00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:02.036 A:middle
and those testers
are ready to go.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:02.036 A:middle
and those testers
are ready to go.

00:42:02.256 --> 00:42:03.536 A:middle
So that's iTunes Connect side.

00:42:04.236 --> 00:42:06.866 A:middle
Now let's take a look at the
tester experience in iOS.

00:42:07.346 --> 00:42:09.756 A:middle
Here we are on the device.

00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.696 A:middle
This is the "Mail" app,
and this is an invitation

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.316 A:middle
that we received
from a developer.

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:17.846 A:middle
We see the name of the app that
we've been invited to test,

00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:21.146 A:middle
and we see a link that
says, open in TestFlight.

00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:24.646 A:middle
So let's go ahead and tap that.

00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:26.826 A:middle
Here we are in the
TestFlight app;

00:42:27.446 --> 00:42:32.786 A:middle
from here we can install our
app, and once we've done that,

00:42:32.786 --> 00:42:35.766 A:middle
we can just start testing.

00:42:35.846 --> 00:42:38.426 A:middle
Few things to note here
is the Send Feedback link.

00:42:39.956 --> 00:42:43.666 A:middle
You, as a tester, can
tap this to send feedback

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.766 A:middle
to your developer via email.

00:42:47.036 --> 00:42:49.076 A:middle
There's also the What to
Test section, which we talked

00:42:49.076 --> 00:42:52.976 A:middle
about earlier, the developer
telling us what they like us

00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:56.976 A:middle
to test specifically
on the latest build.

00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:00.216 A:middle
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:00.216 A:middle
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,

00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:04.666 A:middle
this will take us
back to a list of apps

00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:05.766 A:middle
that we're actively testing.

00:43:05.826 --> 00:43:09.166 A:middle
From here we can open any of
these apps, we can take a look

00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.656 A:middle
at What to Test notes
and we can look

00:43:10.656 --> 00:43:11.716 A:middle
at the version we're testing.

00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:18.416 A:middle
Now let's go back to the
Home screen for a minute.

00:43:18.566 --> 00:43:20.446 A:middle
Here, we see the
app we've installed,

00:43:20.446 --> 00:43:24.066 A:middle
and we'll see a badge, a little
orange badge next to the name

00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:26.946 A:middle
of the app that we
just installed.

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:29.796 A:middle
This indicates that this app
is currently being tested;

00:43:29.796 --> 00:43:33.646 A:middle
it's a beta build of the app.

00:43:33.916 --> 00:43:35.216 A:middle
And oh, what's this?

00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:36.916 A:middle
We got a notification.

00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:40.076 A:middle
This is telling us that
there's a new build available

00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:40.776 A:middle
for us to test.

00:43:41.696 --> 00:43:45.916 A:middle
So if you tap that,
it'll take us back

00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:47.826 A:middle
into the app, into TestFlight.

00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:54.216 A:middle
From here we can update the
app, and we're on our way.

00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:59.546 A:middle
And that's TestFlight,
the iOS App.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:05.856 A:middle
So in summary, we can have
up to 1,000 testers for each

00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:09.446 A:middle
of our apps with beta testing.

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:12.676 A:middle
We no longer need to manage
UDID's or provisioning profiles.

00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:16.766 A:middle
We can perform one-tap
installs and updates.

00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.936 A:middle
Sandbox Accounts are
automatically created

00:44:24.386 --> 00:44:26.386 A:middle
for our testers to be able
to test, and our purchases,

00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:30.616 A:middle
and is all new TestFlight
for iOS.

00:44:30.746 --> 00:44:34.126 A:middle
And that's Beta Testing.

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:35.966 A:middle
Back to Dave.

00:44:36.516 --> 00:44:43.406 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:43.906 --> 00:44:45.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you Daniel.

00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:51.836 A:middle
We have a few things to wrap
up here before we conclude.

00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:55.366 A:middle
Every year we ask App
Review if you had a few tips

00:44:55.366 --> 00:44:57.016 A:middle
and tricks we can
give to developers

00:44:57.576 --> 00:44:59.846 A:middle
at a developers' conference,
what would they be?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:00.646 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
App Review does a great job.

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.116 A:middle
I looked right before
I got on stage.

00:45:04.186 --> 00:45:07.276 A:middle
Ninety-four percent of all
updates review within five days.

00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:09.306 A:middle
And here are some suggestions

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:13.476 A:middle
that can help get your
app through app review.

00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.836 A:middle
Number 1, app name
versus keywords:

00:45:17.186 --> 00:45:20.256 A:middle
Your app name is not place to
list all those different words

00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:23.086 A:middle
that you want people to search
on so they can find your app.

00:45:23.746 --> 00:45:27.086 A:middle
That's what keywords are for.

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:32.766 A:middle
IDFA, if you serve ads, then
ads must be present in your app.

00:45:34.996 --> 00:45:38.256 A:middle
The description and screenshots
must match your app -

00:45:38.686 --> 00:45:41.266 A:middle
and I would add to this -
App Preview will probably be

00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:42.076 A:middle
on this list next year.

00:45:43.556 --> 00:45:45.166 A:middle
When you're ready to
submit In-App Purchases

00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:47.606 A:middle
for review you need to
make sure that all aspects

00:45:47.606 --> 00:45:48.656 A:middle
of the In-App Purchase work.

00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:50.656 A:middle
If you need a service
up and running

00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:53.156 A:middle
so the auto renewables work,
that needs to be ready,

00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:56.696 A:middle
not when your In-App Purchase
is live on the App Store

00:45:56.696 --> 00:45:58.686 A:middle
but when you submit
it to App Review.

00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:01.636 A:middle
If your app gets
metadata rejected,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:01.636 A:middle
If your app gets
metadata rejected,

00:46:02.786 --> 00:46:05.026 A:middle
and you submit it again
without making a change

00:46:05.026 --> 00:46:09.366 A:middle
to that metadata, it will just
get rejected a second time.

00:46:09.546 --> 00:46:13.416 A:middle
I say that because they say it
happens - just a friendly note.

00:46:14.886 --> 00:46:17.826 A:middle
As always, make sure you have
rights for all the content,

00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.386 A:middle
the keywords in your app.

00:46:20.466 --> 00:46:23.426 A:middle
This would apply to screenshots,
app previews, anything.

00:46:23.966 --> 00:46:26.396 A:middle
And lastly, testing.

00:46:27.436 --> 00:46:30.426 A:middle
I'm very happy this
has lowered itself

00:46:30.426 --> 00:46:31.466 A:middle
down on the list this year.

00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:37.126 A:middle
One thing of note is that, if
you're building an iPhone app,

00:46:37.746 --> 00:46:39.836 A:middle
it needs to also
work on an iPad.

00:46:40.386 --> 00:46:44.846 A:middle
Not to be outdone, the Apps
Mission Team said, "Hey,

00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:48.636 A:middle
we have some suggestions, want
to help people some things

00:46:48.636 --> 00:46:52.916 A:middle
to think about before they
submit their app to App Review".

00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:55.426 A:middle
IDFA again - answers
these questions correctly

00:46:55.426 --> 00:46:56.176 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:46:56.826 --> 00:46:58.386 A:middle
If you serve ads using IDFA,

00:46:58.386 --> 00:47:01.686 A:middle
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.386 --> 00:47:01.686 A:middle
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.

00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.266 A:middle
We get a fair number
of apps delivered

00:47:04.266 --> 00:47:05.556 A:middle
but don't have all
the right icons.

00:47:06.546 --> 00:47:08.456 A:middle
Make sure all your
required icons are

00:47:08.456 --> 00:47:10.346 A:middle
in your project before
you submit.

00:47:11.676 --> 00:47:13.666 A:middle
Toolchains and bad signature:

00:47:14.076 --> 00:47:17.656 A:middle
These kinds of invalid binary
messages can all be solved

00:47:17.656 --> 00:47:20.956 A:middle
by making sure that you
upload and create your app

00:47:21.236 --> 00:47:23.526 A:middle
in the latest version of Xcode.

00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:26.696 A:middle
And Mac app sandboxing, if
you're going to send a Mac

00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.196 A:middle
out to the App Store, make
sure you check that box

00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:31.066 A:middle
in Xcode before doing so.

00:47:31.626 --> 00:47:35.466 A:middle
A little note about
iTunes Connect for iOS:

00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:38.696 A:middle
I hope many of you already
gotten the latest update;

00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:39.896 A:middle
we released it a few weeks ago.

00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:43.456 A:middle
This was our first foray
or step into the redesign.

00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:47.926 A:middle
Updated pages, sells and trends.

00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:51.156 A:middle
Take a look at your five
week, your two week,

00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:54.096 A:middle
your 26 weeks information.

00:47:54.646 --> 00:47:57.076 A:middle
New page view.

00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:59.656 A:middle
iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.376 A:middle
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.376 A:middle
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live

00:48:02.376 --> 00:48:03.006 A:middle
into the App Store.

00:48:06.836 --> 00:48:10.576 A:middle
So today we talked about the
new design for iTunes Connect;,

00:48:11.836 --> 00:48:17.096 A:middle
a nice new UI as well as
cleaner flows; app previews,

00:48:17.496 --> 00:48:20.616 A:middle
15 to 30 seconds
of dynamic video

00:48:21.286 --> 00:48:23.166 A:middle
so you can show what
makes your app magical.

00:48:23.716 --> 00:48:28.856 A:middle
App bundles: Bundle up to
10 of your apps together,

00:48:30.146 --> 00:48:33.156 A:middle
providing people in the
App Store with one install

00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:34.736 A:middle
to get all of these apps.

00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:39.676 A:middle
App Analytics - this is the
best end-to-end view of your app

00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.996 A:middle
with data that only
Apple can provide.

00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:44.476 A:middle
And TestFlight Beta Testing.

00:48:44.996 --> 00:48:47.856 A:middle
If you haven't been beta
testing your apps until now,

00:48:47.856 --> 00:48:51.056 A:middle
you have no reason not to.

00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.226 A:middle
Just like iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite,

00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.926 A:middle
these features will be
released later this fall.

00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:59.526 A:middle

00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.466 A:middle
There's a Contact Us
form on iTunes Connect -

00:49:04.016 --> 00:49:05.336 A:middle
this really is the best way

00:49:05.336 --> 00:49:07.246 A:middle
to get your questions
answered by the right person.

00:49:07.436 --> 00:49:08.526 A:middle
It can take a lot time

00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:10.616 A:middle
to navigate those
emails based off your

00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:12.346 A:middle
questions appropriately.

00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:15.466 A:middle
There's iTunes Connect
Dev Guide you can get

00:49:15.466 --> 00:49:19.366 A:middle
on developer.apple.com as
well as the dev forms -

00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:20.566 A:middle
lots of good information there.

00:49:22.056 --> 00:49:24.726 A:middle
We have some related
sessions later today:

00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:26.046 A:middle
"Optimizing In-App Purchases."

00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.006 A:middle
If you have any questions
on how exactly

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.956 A:middle
to use In-App Purchases,
check that out.

00:49:30.696 --> 00:49:32.186 A:middle
"What's New in iAd Workbench."

00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:37.226 A:middle
As Trystan mentioned, privacy
matters, so we have a session

00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:41.556 A:middle
on "User Privacy
in iOS and OS X."

00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:43.486 A:middle
Tomorrow, "Advanced
User Interfaces

00:49:43.486 --> 00:49:44.436 A:middle
With Collection Views."

00:49:44.776 --> 00:49:46.726 A:middle
This is a great session
where we'll talk about that

00:49:46.726 --> 00:49:50.146 A:middle
and show how we used it in
creating iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:53.036 A:middle
And the session I
mentioned earlier about

00:49:53.036 --> 00:49:54.216 A:middle
"Creating Great App Previews,"

00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:56.006 A:middle
again right before
the bash tomorrow.

00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:57.626 A:middle
I encourage you to check
that one out as well.

00:49:58.656 --> 00:49:59.766 A:middle
And with that, that's
all we have today,

00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:00.856 A:middle
I hope you have a great day
and rest of the conference.
