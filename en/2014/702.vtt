00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:11.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.736 A:middle
Welcome to session 702
Managing Apple Devices.

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.446 A:middle
Wow. I wasn't expecting
that enthusiastic

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:21.846 A:middle
of welcome this early
in the morning.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:24.636 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I
am very happy to be here

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.806 A:middle
with you even at this
ridiculously early hour

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:27.966 A:middle
for techies like me.

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.296 A:middle
Although for some of you, this
may be the middle of your day

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
if you work in schools
our otherwise have

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.976 A:middle
to wear a tie to work.

00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:37.726 A:middle
Many of us are far more likely
to see this hour at the end

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:40.276 A:middle
of a long night of coding than
at the beginning of our day.

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.766 A:middle
Now, I open by recognizing
our differences

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.886 A:middle
because this session's
content is intended

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.116 A:middle
for a diverse audience.

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:50.946 A:middle
From Indian vendors, who need to
learn how to take full advantage

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.926 A:middle
of the powerful device
management capabilities

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:58.206 A:middle
that we've built into iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite, to app developers

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.196 A:middle
who want to understand how their
apps may be used in schools

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.196 A:middle
who want to understand how their
apps may be used in schools

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:04.036 A:middle
and businesses, to
administrators who need

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:06.946 A:middle
to know what changes are coming
in the OS releases this year.

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.666 A:middle
When I stood before you here
last year, I was thrilled

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.176 A:middle
to announce 2 huge leaps forward
in managing Apple devices.

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.966 A:middle
In the addition of
managed distribution

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.016 A:middle
to our Volume Purchase
Program and the introduction

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:23.656 A:middle
of the Device Enrollment
Program which Craig highlighted

00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:25.846 A:middle
in the enterprise section
of yesterday's Keynote.

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:28.226 A:middle
It's hard to believe there
was an enterprise section

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:29.976 A:middle
at the Keynote, but it
was very exciting to see.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:36.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:40.116 A:middle
When we set out to create
the device in Roman program,

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
we did so after wondering, why
does it have to be painful to do

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.716 A:middle
that initial configuration

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.316 A:middle
of your devices before handing
them out to their users?

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.076 A:middle
And we started by
asking a simple question.

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:54.246 A:middle
Why can't it be as easy as
just un-boxing that device

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.626 A:middle
and handing that iPad or that
iPhone or that Mac to its user?

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.476 A:middle
And it turns out many of you
are asking the same question.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.476 A:middle
And it turns out many of you
are asking the same question.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.116 A:middle
And I'm very pleased to report
that our customers are just

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.856 A:middle
as thrilled by the
transformative nature

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.455 A:middle
of this new service
as we had hoped.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:12.666 A:middle
One noteworthy example is
Immaculata La Salle High School

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.496 A:middle
in Florida who believe
that we, indeed,

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.056 A:middle
turned this dream
into a reality.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:22.296 A:middle
And they proved it by completely
replacing their fleet of iPads

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:26.826 A:middle
with 600 new iPad Airs including
restoring all the student apps

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.756 A:middle
and data from iCloud
in 2.5 hours.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.016 A:middle
They made a wonderful video
showing just how they did it.

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:35.426 A:middle
And if you've never seen the
Device Enrollment Program

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.636 A:middle
in action, I highly
recommend checking it out.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.996 A:middle
So since we last met, we've
been very busy launching managed

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.336 A:middle
distribution last fall.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.356 A:middle
The Device Enrollment
Program a few months ago.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.806 A:middle
And we've also been busy adding
all these features to fill

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.576 A:middle
in the gaps and smooth
out the inconsistencies

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.296 A:middle
between iOS and OS X.

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
So that vendors, like some


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
So that vendors, like some

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.516 A:middle
of you creating device
management tools,

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.676 A:middle
and the administrators,
using those tools,

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.896 A:middle
have a much easier time managing
all their Apple devices.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.546 A:middle
This session is going to cover
the entire life cycle device

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.966 A:middle
management including both
new tools existing tools

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.386 A:middle
and technologies and
all the changes coming

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.716 A:middle
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.946 A:middle
And we'll show you how
they all come together

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:24.416 A:middle
to provide a great experience

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.936 A:middle
for both the administrators
and their end users.

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:31.056 A:middle
From enrolling devices in your
management solution of choice

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.226 A:middle
to distributing content to
all those devices to the day

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:38.136 A:middle
to day ongoing management
tasks that come

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.546 A:middle
up as time goes on
and needs change.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:45.056 A:middle
So let's dive right in and
talk about enrolling devices.

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:47.736 A:middle
Of course, we're going to
spend a fair amount of time

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:48.946 A:middle
on the device enrollment
program,

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:50.126 A:middle
the best way to do this.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.486 A:middle
I'll also talk about
Apple Configurator

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
as an alternative way
to enroll your devices.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.826 A:middle
You also need to be aware of
how to manage Activation Lock

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.596 A:middle
on supervised devices
and be thinking


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.596 A:middle
on supervised devices
and be thinking

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.086 A:middle
about that at enrollment time.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:06.376 A:middle
And then I'll conclude
with what's coming

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:08.056 A:middle
in this year's OS releases.

00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:10.826 A:middle
So before we go any
further, I want to make sure

00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:13.576 A:middle
that everyone understands what
the Device Enrollment Program is

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:14.226 A:middle
and is not.

00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:16.956 A:middle
So it relates, you know,
audience participation.

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.106 A:middle
Let's get going, although I
appreciate all the responses

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:22.756 A:middle
already, the Device Enrollment
Program is not a MDM server.

00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:23.816 A:middle
Come on, say it with me,

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:27.146 A:middle
Device Enrollment Program
is not an MDM server.

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:27.806 A:middle
Thank you.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:31.316 A:middle
Though you'll note they're both
3 letter acronyms, those of you

00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:33.726 A:middle
with eagle eyes with note
they're not the same 3 letters.

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.496 A:middle
In fact, the Device Enrollment
Program is the best way

00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:39.966 A:middle
to get your devices enrolled

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:41.966 A:middle
in whatever MDM solution
you're going to use.

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.926 A:middle
It's an easy button to get your
devices in your MDM server.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:50.276 A:middle
It's really 2 parts: A way
for administrators to specify

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:52.736 A:middle
which settings they want to use
when their devices are enrolled

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:53.916 A:middle
in their management solution.

00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:58.036 A:middle
And the integration
of the completion

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.436 A:middle
of that enrollment process
right into the normal set


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.436 A:middle
of that enrollment process
right into the normal set

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.656 A:middle
of assistant process
that the user will go

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.666 A:middle
through on both iOS and OS X.

00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:08.746 A:middle
As I mentioned, we
launched this in February

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:12.656 A:middle
with devices eligible that
are purchased via direct sales

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:15.826 A:middle
in the U.S. And we've heard all
of your feedback loud and clear

00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:17.326 A:middle
that you'd like to
see us expanded

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.716 A:middle
to additional countries
and channels.

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:21.266 A:middle
So I'm very pleased that,

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:23.546 A:middle
although we've only launched
this a few months ago,

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:26.946 A:middle
we've already expanded access
to our neighbors to the North.

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:28.946 A:middle
Any Canadians here?

00:05:30.256 --> 00:05:32.826 A:middle
I'm so sorry about the
Canadians, but, in fact,

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:34.806 A:middle
the Rangers knocked my Flyers
out in the first round;

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:36.476 A:middle
so get them next year.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.666 A:middle
We've also made a number
of other changes already

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.656 A:middle
since launch that I
wanted to point out.

00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:47.006 A:middle
Devices are now eligible
up to 3 years in the past

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:48.566 A:middle
if you've purchased
them up to 3 years ago.

00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:51.556 A:middle
And there's some enhancements
to the portal that allow you

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:54.736 A:middle
to set a default MDM server so
that any new device purchases

00:05:54.736 --> 00:05:57.066 A:middle
with automatically be
assigned to that MDM server

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.666 A:middle
without you needing to
take further action.

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.876 A:middle
You can also now see which
administrators assigned


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.876 A:middle
You can also now see which
administrators assigned

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.216 A:middle
which devices to
which MDM servers.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:08.756 A:middle
And another, coming soon,
expansion of eligibility is

00:06:08.756 --> 00:06:09.906 A:middle
that when devices that are

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:13.066 A:middle
in the Device Enrollment
Program are replaced by service,

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:15.796 A:middle
those devices will
soon be remain

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:18.876 A:middle
in the Device Enrollment Program
including, retroactively,

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.326 A:middle
devices that have been
replaced over the past 3 years.

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.826 A:middle
We think customers will
really appreciate that too.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:30.146 A:middle
So let's quickly recap exactly
how this service works before I

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.496 A:middle
go into details, especially
for the MDM vendors.

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:36.946 A:middle
Customer purchases devices,
that information is fed

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:38.246 A:middle
into the Device Enrollment
Program.

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:43.236 A:middle
When the customer provides
their account information

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.276 A:middle
to their MDM solution, the MDM
solution can download the device

00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:47.586 A:middle
information from the program.

00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:50.426 A:middle
The administrator can then
specify their settings

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.826 A:middle
and upload those to the program.

00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:55.896 A:middle
Then, when users open
the box and start walking

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:59.096 A:middle
through the setup assistant,
the device receives its settings

00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.766 A:middle
from the Device Enrollment
Program which tell it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.766 A:middle
from the Device Enrollment
Program which tell it

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:03.656 A:middle
to enroll with the MDM server.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.966 A:middle
And I also, again, want
to emphasize that once

00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:08.986 A:middle
that happens, Device Enrollment
Program has done its job.

00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
It's out of the picture,

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:12.736 A:middle
and your MDM solution is the
only thing that's talking

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:13.376 A:middle
to the devices.

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:19.356 A:middle
So we're going to talk about
3 topics a few moments here

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:22.566 A:middle
related to the Device
Enrollment Program and how best

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.586 A:middle
to integrate this into
your MDM solutions.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:30.706 A:middle
So the first concept is, where
should the ultimate repository

00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:33.336 A:middle
of the truth relating to
the program, the devices

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:34.836 A:middle
and the settings reside?

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
The device information
should really be

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.806 A:middle
in the Device Enrollment Program
and treat that as the truth.

00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:42.276 A:middle
You can always fetch
that information

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:43.936 A:middle
from the service
to your MDM server.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:47.396 A:middle
But the settings that the
administrator decides to apply

00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:48.786 A:middle
to certain groups of devices,

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:52.986 A:middle
your server should really treat
itself as the truth for that.

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.166 A:middle
It can always upload new
settings to the program.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:01.056 A:middle
One caveat here to keep in mind,
though, is what I explained

00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:01.056 A:middle
One caveat here to keep in mind,
though, is what I explained

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:03.046 A:middle
on the previous slide: Even

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:05.296 A:middle
if the administrator
changes the settings that are

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:07.546 A:middle
in the Device Enrollment
Program for a particular device

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:10.536 A:middle
or devices, those devices
will not see those settings

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:13.486 A:middle
until the next time that they go
through activation after wiping

00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:15.016 A:middle
and going back through
the setup assistant.

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.336 A:middle
So if the device is already
enrolled and you happen

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:18.956 A:middle
to change the setting to
say, Well, now I want it

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:21.016 A:middle
to be supervised,
that won't take effect

00:08:21.016 --> 00:08:24.886 A:middle
until the next time
the device is set up.

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:25.606 A:middle
All right.

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:28.676 A:middle
So disowning devices, you may be
thinking, what does that mean?

00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:30.506 A:middle
Well, this removing a device

00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:31.836 A:middle
from the Device Enrollment
Program.

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:33.236 A:middle
And I'm here to scare you.

00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:38.765 A:middle
Our recommendation is to
not implement this feature.

00:08:39.616 --> 00:08:40.316 A:middle
Why is that?

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.446 A:middle
Well, and if you're
going to break Rule No.

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.756 A:middle
1, you need to really,

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.356 A:middle
really how many "reallys"
did I put on there?

00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:48.976 A:middle
really make sure they
understand the consequences:

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:51.396 A:middle
That they will not be able
to undo this action and get

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:52.976 A:middle
that device back
into the program.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.786 A:middle
So, again, we recommend
following Rule 1.

00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:58.116 A:middle
All right.

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:01.696 A:middle
Our final topic is thinking
about the combinations of two


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:01.696 A:middle
Our final topic is thinking
about the combinations of two

00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:04.776 A:middle
of the specific enrollment
settings that you can configure

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.916 A:middle
for a device: Whether
it's supervised or not,

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.026 A:middle
and whether that MDM
enrollment can be removed or not

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.456 A:middle
by the user on the device.

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:15.776 A:middle
And there our own Profile
Manager has taken the approach

00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:17.566 A:middle
of not separating
these settings.

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:21.196 A:middle
That if you choose to supervise
a device, it automatically,

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:24.556 A:middle
the MDM enrollment is not
removable, that top right box.

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:27.636 A:middle
The bottom right
box is forbidden.

00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:30.016 A:middle
If you try to upload settings

00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:33.026 A:middle
where the device
is not supervised

00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:35.256 A:middle
and the MDM enrollment is
not removable by the user,

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.336 A:middle
the service will
reject those settings.

00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:40.596 A:middle
The lower left box
may be interesting,

00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:43.206 A:middle
again Profile Manager
doesn't well,

00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:44.806 A:middle
that's what profile manger does

00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:46.396 A:middle
if you don't check
the supervised box

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
that it's completely open.

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:51.606 A:middle
It's not supervised; end user
can undo the MDM enrollment.

00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:53.676 A:middle
Those 2 are really
the interesting ones.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.146 A:middle
The kind of half one in
the upper left is allowed,

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:58.456 A:middle
but probably not
super interesting

00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
to supervise a device
but still allow the user


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
to supervise a device
but still allow the user

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.066 A:middle
to un enroll from MDM.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.796 A:middle
So that's a couple notes about
the Device Enrollment Program.

00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.656 A:middle
Let's talk a bit about
Apple Configurator.

00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:13.936 A:middle
So again Apple Configurator
is also not an MDM server.

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:15.596 A:middle
I want to make sure
everyone's clear about that.

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:20.106 A:middle
But it is an alternative way
to install enrollment settings

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.356 A:middle
on a particular iOS
device over USB.

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.206 A:middle
As an alternative to using
Device Enrollment Program

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:25.776 A:middle
over the Air.

00:10:27.186 --> 00:10:29.276 A:middle
Once those settings have
been loaded to the device,

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:32.186 A:middle
the actual requests that
go to the MDM server

00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:34.716 A:middle
to complete the enrollment
are indistinguishable

00:10:34.716 --> 00:10:37.406 A:middle
from whether they were
done the settings got there

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:38.866 A:middle
over the Air or over USB.

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:42.456 A:middle
However, you can teach
your server to distinguish

00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:44.586 A:middle
between the 2 if
you check to see

00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:48.486 A:middle
if that particular device
that's enrolling is in the list

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.316 A:middle
that you've gotten from the
Device Enrollment Program.

00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:54.656 A:middle
Also, if a device has
already gotten its settings

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:56.056 A:middle
from the Device Enrollment
Program,

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.376 A:middle
Configurator will not
overwrite those settings.

00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.716 A:middle
One additional caveat is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.716 A:middle
One additional caveat is

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:04.156 A:middle
that delivering your enrollment
settings via the Device

00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:06.036 A:middle
Enrollment Program
is the only way

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:08.216 A:middle
that you can make your MDM
enrollment not removable

00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:08.896 A:middle
by the user.

00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:13.676 A:middle
Another recommendation and
one that we followed ourselves

00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:16.216 A:middle
in Profile Manager is that
it's probably a good idea

00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:17.916 A:middle
to offer administrators
the option

00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:22.606 A:middle
to disallow installing settings
over USB if you want to ensure

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:25.636 A:middle
that they only get your
institution's devices only get

00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:27.946 A:middle
the settings that
you specify via DEP.

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:32.046 A:middle
That would present a user
from using Configurator

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:36.436 A:middle
to install settings that allow
enrollment in your MDM server

00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:37.876 A:middle
without supervising for example.

00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:41.706 A:middle
Let's now talk a little bit

00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:43.186 A:middle
about Activation
Lock Management.

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:47.496 A:middle
So by default a supervised
device does not allow the user

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:50.786 A:middle
to enroll in or to
enable Activation Lock.

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:57.656 A:middle
But there is now a way that
we introduced in the spring

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:03.446 A:middle
that MDM can request a bypass
code that allows the MDM server


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:03.446 A:middle
that MDM can request a bypass
code that allows the MDM server

00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:06.226 A:middle
to later or the administrator
to later clear Activation Lock

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.016 A:middle
without needing the
user's password.

00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:12.066 A:middle
At that time, there's
also a MDM command

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:14.926 A:middle
that can tell the device, well,
okay, now you can allow the user

00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:16.076 A:middle
to enable Activation Lock.

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:18.716 A:middle
So you want to do all of
this at enrollment time.

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:21.446 A:middle
If, in fact, your institution
wants to use Activation Lock,

00:12:21.446 --> 00:12:22.946 A:middle
which is a great feature.

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:27.006 A:middle
We also recommend
that once you retrieve

00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:30.856 A:middle
that Activation Lock bypass
code that you provide access

00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:33.866 A:middle
to the administrator to in the
UI because it may be useful

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:35.586 A:middle
to maybe enter it
manually on a device

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
that for whatever reason
is not currently reachable

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:39.226 A:middle
by the MDM server.

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:44.416 A:middle
There are 3 new MDM commands
to retrieve the code,

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.356 A:middle
to then delete it
from the device

00:12:46.356 --> 00:12:48.766 A:middle
so that no one can
grab it off the device

00:12:48.766 --> 00:12:51.866 A:middle
if they get physical access
to it, and then, of course,

00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:54.936 A:middle
to enable or allow the device
to enable Activation Lock.

00:12:55.696 --> 00:12:56.656 A:middle
And we strongly recommend

00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:58.996 A:middle
that when you're completing
the MDM enrollment, that,

00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.816 A:middle
at that time, you
always retrieve


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.816 A:middle
at that time, you
always retrieve

00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:03.196 A:middle
and then clear the bypass
code from the device

00:13:03.536 --> 00:13:05.446 A:middle
because it's only
available for 15 days

00:13:05.446 --> 00:13:06.916 A:middle
after the device was supervised.

00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:10.756 A:middle
You should also save
that bypass code even

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.336 A:middle
if a particular device
is un-enrolled from MDM

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.796 A:middle
because Activation Lock
may still be enabled.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.166 A:middle
And you may still
need to clear it.

00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.646 A:middle
And the device can
later re enroll.

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:22.396 A:middle
And there won't be another
opportunity to get a bypass code

00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:25.376 A:middle
until the device is
wiped and re supervised.

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:30.596 A:middle
So those are the topics I
wanted to cover on enrolling.

00:13:30.596 --> 00:13:34.156 A:middle
But I'm also happy to tell you
that there's important change

00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:35.966 A:middle
in how the device responds

00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:39.206 A:middle
when the enrollment is being
completed in Setup Assistant.

00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:42.636 A:middle
And I know your servers
are all real excited.

00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:45.186 A:middle
The administrators have no
doubt specified lots of settings

00:13:45.186 --> 00:13:46.536 A:middle
and apps and all
sorts of things.

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.506 A:middle
They want to deliver to the
device as soon as it's enrolled;

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:51.136 A:middle
however, the device
isn't ready to respond

00:13:51.136 --> 00:13:53.526 A:middle
to all those requests while
the user is still completing

00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.286 A:middle
Setup Assistant.

00:13:54.846 --> 00:13:57.336 A:middle
So now when any of these
MDM commands are sent

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.006 A:middle
to the device while it is
still in the Setup Assistant,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.006 A:middle
to the device while it is
still in the Setup Assistant,

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.086 A:middle
it will return the
"not now" status.

00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:04.386 A:middle
So your server can know,
hey, device isn't ready.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:07.656 A:middle
I'm going to wait until
it returns success

00:14:07.656 --> 00:14:08.326 A:middle
for that enrollment.

00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:12.366 A:middle
And then you can start
completing your enrollment tasks

00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:14.856 A:middle
or configuration tasks.

00:14:15.136 --> 00:14:17.386 A:middle
So without further ado, I'd
like to show you how this works,

00:14:17.386 --> 00:14:20.336 A:middle
and I'm going to invite my
colleagues Jussi Pekka and Mark

00:14:20.336 --> 00:14:22.946 A:middle
up to show you a demo
of enrolling devices.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:26.726 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:27.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you, Todd.

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:31.396 A:middle
So here we have an out of box,
freshly delivered, new iPad.

00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:35.806 A:middle
Basically it was purchased by
the institution and it didn't go

00:14:35.806 --> 00:14:36.706 A:middle
through some boiler room.

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:38.276 A:middle
It was just handed
straight to the user

00:14:38.646 --> 00:14:41.526 A:middle
and our Profile Manager
server this is our MDM server

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
for this demo knows about
this device because the time

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:47.646 A:middle
between Device Enrollment
Program and Profile Manager

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.416 A:middle
and the device the purchase
was made through the channels.

00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:53.906 A:middle
So we know that this device is
configured for our services.

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.916 A:middle
So I'm going to walk
through the setup as usual.

00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:57.956 A:middle
I'm going to pick my language.

00:14:58.076 --> 00:14:59.586 A:middle
Go pick my country.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:00.876 A:middle
Connect to my network.

00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:03.566 A:middle
So at this point, the
device is now talking

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:04.576 A:middle
to the Apple Services

00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:07.336 A:middle
and obtaining its
activation information.

00:15:07.336 --> 00:15:10.866 A:middle
And as part of that information
is the notice that we are now

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:16.146 A:middle
in the DEP and we got prompted
for enrolling in the MDM server.

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:20.646 A:middle
So just in a second we are still
returning some information.

00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:24.206 A:middle
And now we are talking
to our server.

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:27.196 A:middle
So this is as far as DEP
has talked to the device.

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.556 A:middle
Now we're talking
to our MDM server.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:32.496 A:middle
And I can find more
information about our instance.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.776 A:middle
So if I need to know
what to do next,

00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:36.196 A:middle
I can call the ACME Help Desk.

00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:38.656 A:middle
And now I go to the next.

00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:42.646 A:middle
And you see that when I go
forward, I'm now prompted

00:15:42.646 --> 00:15:44.556 A:middle
for my user name and password.

00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:47.906 A:middle
And I cannot bypass this;
so I do have to enroll this.

00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:51.646 A:middle
So this device has been
configured to be supervised,

00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:53.956 A:middle
and the MDM profile
is mandatory.

00:15:54.176 --> 00:15:56.236 A:middle
So I have no way of
bypassing this step.

00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:59.856 A:middle
So I'll provide my log in
information and move on.

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:04.726 A:middle
And now we're downloading the
profiles from our MDM server.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:04.726 A:middle
And now we're downloading the
profiles from our MDM server.

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:09.576 A:middle
So, again the DEP phase has been
completed, and now we're talking

00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:11.206 A:middle
to our management server.

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:14.626 A:middle
And Mark has set some
screens to be bypassed here,

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:16.836 A:middle
so we're not seeing
registration and other pieces.

00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:19.956 A:middle
And while I complete my setup
logging into my iCloud account,

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.486 A:middle
I'll have Mark show you
the setup in the backside.

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yep. So Jussi is going to
finish setting up his iPad.

00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:27.396 A:middle
And I want to walk
you through how

00:16:27.396 --> 00:16:29.556 A:middle
in Profile Manager we've
implemented this UI

00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.676 A:middle
to support configuring
Device Enrollment Program.

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:34.706 A:middle
So on the left side
you see the devices

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:35.646 A:middle
that my server has retrieved

00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:37.516 A:middle
from the Device Enrollment
Program.

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.396 A:middle
My server is configured
to download these devices,

00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:42.856 A:middle
and then I have Jussi's
iPad selected here.

00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:44.536 A:middle
And you can see the
enrollment settings

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.846 A:middle
that I've got selected here.

00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:49.566 A:middle
Our first option is whether
to turn on this configuration

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:50.436 A:middle
for this device or not.

00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:52.356 A:middle
You can also put
these configurations

00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:53.776 A:middle
on device groups as well.

00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:54.756 A:middle
So you can get a
whole collection

00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.896 A:middle
of devices get the
same settings.

00:16:56.956 --> 00:16:58.556 A:middle
So we have this checked
on because we wanted

00:16:58.556 --> 00:16:59.456 A:middle
to send the settings down.

00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
The next option is whether


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
The next option is whether

00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:03.066 A:middle
or not the user is
allowed to skip enrollment.

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:06.715 A:middle
And, as you saw in the case of
Jussi's device, he's not allowed

00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:09.205 A:middle
to skip enrollment; he's going
to be prompted for credentials,

00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:10.486 A:middle
credentials for his
directory server.

00:17:11.276 --> 00:17:12.816 A:middle
Our next option is whether
or not we want to do

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.675 A:middle
over the air supervision
of the device.

00:17:15.106 --> 00:17:17.856 A:middle
Now, in addition to being
able to supervise the device,

00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:20.236 A:middle
when you supervise the device,
you also have the option

00:17:20.636 --> 00:17:22.205 A:middle
of locking the MDM Profile

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:23.756 A:middle
so it can't be removed
from the device.

00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:26.486 A:middle
In our case, we've combined
those into one option

00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:28.566 A:middle
because we think our customers,
whenever they supervise,

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.446 A:middle
they're going to want
to have locked MDM.

00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.696 A:middle
But if you're a third party MDM
developer, you can always break

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:36.446 A:middle
that out and have it
as a separate option.

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:41.276 A:middle
The next thing is whether or
not you want to allow pairing.

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
So I have that turned on
so the device can pair

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:45.226 A:middle
with another Mac if you want.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.016 A:middle
Next is to request
credentials for enrollment.

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:50.436 A:middle
You saw Jussi's device was
prompted for credentials.

00:17:50.806 --> 00:17:51.786 A:middle
And then there are
various things

00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:53.646 A:middle
that we can skip
during the setup show

00:17:53.646 --> 00:17:55.486 A:middle
or skip during the
Setup Assistant.

00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:58.276 A:middle
In our case, we have Apple
ID enabled because we want

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
to caption on, Jussi's
device will get Activation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
to caption on, Jussi's
device will get Activation

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:01.036 A:middle
Lock enabled.

00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:05.356 A:middle
So Jussi is finished actually
setting up his device.

00:18:05.716 --> 00:18:10.666 A:middle
So I am going to show
you, our security settings

00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:12.776 A:middle
for the device right now show

00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:14.356 A:middle
that Activation Lock
is not enabled.

00:18:14.356 --> 00:18:16.156 A:middle
But I do have the
Activation Lock bypass code.

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:18.086 A:middle
This what Profile
Manager grabbed

00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:19.456 A:middle
from the device when
it was enrolled.

00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:25.676 A:middle
If I update my info
now that he's done,

00:18:26.566 --> 00:18:27.606 A:middle
we'll see in a moment here

00:18:27.716 --> 00:18:29.486 A:middle
that Activation Lock is
going to change to yes.

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.056 A:middle
And find my iPhone is
enabled, is set to yes.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:37.586 A:middle
So when this device comes
back to me, I'll be able

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:39.036 A:middle
to run this clear
Activation Lock

00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:40.916 A:middle
if Activation Lock
is still enabled.

00:18:41.156 --> 00:18:43.246 A:middle
And I and clear that
and hand this device

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:44.106 A:middle
out to the next user.

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:45.456 A:middle
So back to Todd.

00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:46.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:18:46.746 --> 00:18:47.416 A:middle
Thank you, guys.

00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:52.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:53.056 --> 00:18:55.816 A:middle
So Jussi and Mark just
showed you how you can enroll

00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:58.186 A:middle
and supervise an iOS device
using the Device Enrollment

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.286 A:middle
Program and how to configure
the enrollment settings


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.286 A:middle
Program and how to configure
the enrollment settings

00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:03.096 A:middle
that were used using
Profile Manager.

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:05.666 A:middle
But, of course, that can be
done with any MDM solution

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.176 A:middle
that supports the Device
Enrollment Program.

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.216 A:middle
And we hope all of them do.

00:19:09.686 --> 00:19:11.986 A:middle
Mark showed you how Profile
Manager had retrieved the

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:13.446 A:middle
Activation Lock bypass code

00:19:13.446 --> 00:19:15.366 A:middle
as it completed enrollment
of that device.

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:20.966 A:middle
And then Profile Manager
actually automatically allows

00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:23.496 A:middle
or there's a setting, enrollment
setting which I don't know

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.856 A:middle
that Mark showed that the
administrator can choose

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:29.486 A:middle
to always automatically allow
Activation Lock once it's

00:19:29.486 --> 00:19:31.866 A:middle
retrieved, successfully
retrieved the bypass code.

00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:35.316 A:middle
So let's move on to the next
section of our talk and talk

00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:37.226 A:middle
about distributing
content to our devices.

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:39.226 A:middle
We're, of course, going to talk

00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:40.506 A:middle
about the Volume
Purchase Program

00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:41.556 A:middle
and managed distribution.

00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:45.366 A:middle
We'll talk a little bit about
managed apps and then conclude

00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:48.526 A:middle
with the significant
enhancements in iOS 8

00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:51.026 A:middle
and OS X Yosemite to
fill in some gaps here.

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:56.126 A:middle
So, again, to recap, managed
distribution allows the

00:19:56.126 --> 00:19:59.166 A:middle
administrator to buy
licenses instead of codes,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:03.206 A:middle
which can be revoked and
reallocated to a different user

00:20:03.466 --> 00:20:06.406 A:middle
for both apps and books.

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:10.956 A:middle
And we provided API so that
MDM solutions can integrate the

00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:12.986 A:middle
service into their solutions.

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:15.666 A:middle
And it's currently
available in 10 countries.

00:20:18.006 --> 00:20:20.696 A:middle
So, again a refresher of
exactly how this works:

00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:23.976 A:middle
The administrator can
purchase apps and books

00:20:23.976 --> 00:20:26.376 A:middle
in the VPP Portal, that
information is stored

00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:28.216 A:middle
in the iBookstore
and the App Store.

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.336 A:middle
When they provide their
account information

00:20:31.336 --> 00:20:34.366 A:middle
to their management solution,
it can download information

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.476 A:middle
about which apps and
books have been purchased

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:38.216 A:middle
and are available
for assignment.

00:20:39.296 --> 00:20:41.826 A:middle
It can send assignments
up to the iTunes Store

00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:45.656 A:middle
and credit a particular app
or book to a user account.

00:20:46.856 --> 00:20:48.806 A:middle
When the user configures
their Apple ID

00:20:48.806 --> 00:20:52.666 A:middle
on a particular Apple device,
they'll see those assignments

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:55.766 A:middle
in their purchase list and
can download the bits directly

00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:58.176 A:middle
from the store just as if they
had purchased them themselves.

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:02.196 A:middle
And, also, the administrator
can send MDM commands


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:02.196 A:middle
And, also, the administrator
can send MDM commands

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.746 A:middle
from the server to the devices
to say download this app

00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:07.686 A:middle
to make sure that it
is actually installed

00:21:07.686 --> 00:21:08.766 A:middle
on that particular device.

00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:13.836 A:middle
So, again, dive into a
number of topics related

00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
to the Volume Purchase Program
to give you some advice on how

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:18.926 A:middle
to best integrate this
program into your solutions.

00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:22.686 A:middle
Starting off again with where
should the different pieces

00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:24.576 A:middle
of truth reside?

00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:28.276 A:middle
And the VPP service itself
should really be the truth

00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.356 A:middle
for the status of
user enrollment,

00:21:30.396 --> 00:21:32.666 A:middle
whether a user has
accepted an invitation

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.666 A:middle
and associate the their
Apple ID with the VPP user,

00:21:36.756 --> 00:21:38.246 A:middle
which licenses have
been purchased,

00:21:38.246 --> 00:21:41.336 A:middle
as I showed on the previous
slide, as well as tracking

00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:44.276 A:middle
in irrevocable book
assignments that have been made.

00:21:44.946 --> 00:21:47.026 A:middle
You're MDM server should
actually be the truth

00:21:47.026 --> 00:21:50.046 A:middle
for everything else including
revocable app assignments.

00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:51.836 A:middle
And you might be
wondering why shouldn't

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:53.246 A:middle
that be in the VPP service?

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:56.506 A:middle
Well if your MDM solution
supports group assignments,

00:21:56.696 --> 00:21:59.006 A:middle
you'll need to keep that
information in your MDM server

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:01.286 A:middle
because there's no way to
store group information


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:01.286 A:middle
because there's no way to
store group information

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:02.526 A:middle
in the VPP service.

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.936 A:middle
So if you're going to be able to
reconstitute that, you're going

00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:06.766 A:middle
to need to have all that
within your database.

00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:10.396 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit
about account management.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:14.556 A:middle
When a particular administrator
provides their credentials,

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:18.126 A:middle
their VPP account to your
solution, and you want

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:19.346 A:middle
to establish that
initial connection

00:22:19.346 --> 00:22:22.546 A:middle
with the Volume Purchase
Program you're going to need

00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:24.306 A:middle
to check the client
context attribute.

00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:26.796 A:middle
And if it's empty that means

00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:29.106 A:middle
that no other server
has claimed this account

00:22:29.106 --> 00:22:30.156 A:middle
or is using this account.

00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:31.656 A:middle
And you should go
ahead and claim it

00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:35.766 A:middle
by providing the host name of
your server and a unique a GUID

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:38.426 A:middle
so that you'll be able to tell
whether your server is still the

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:39.066 A:middle
one managing.

00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:42.506 A:middle
If the client context
has a value

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:45.326 A:middle
and it doesn't match the GUID
that you have for that server,

00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.876 A:middle
some other server is
actually using that account.

00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:49.876 A:middle
And you're going to want
to alert the administrator

00:22:49.876 --> 00:22:52.936 A:middle
that some other server is
managing the licenses tied

00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:56.786 A:middle
to this account and ask them
to confirm that they, in fact,

00:22:56.786 --> 00:22:58.506 A:middle
want this server to
take over that account.

00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.356 A:middle
That may, in fact, be the right
thing if they're transitioning


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.356 A:middle
That may, in fact, be the right
thing if they're transitioning

00:23:01.356 --> 00:23:02.796 A:middle
from one server to the next.

00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:06.766 A:middle
And then further, whenever you
re establish the connection

00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:09.816 A:middle
to the service, you need to
check client context again

00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:12.826 A:middle
to make sure that your server is
still the one that's connected

00:23:12.826 --> 00:23:13.526 A:middle
to this account.

00:23:14.286 --> 00:23:16.416 A:middle
If it doesn't match
any longer, you, again,

00:23:16.466 --> 00:23:18.706 A:middle
need to stop making
requests to the service

00:23:18.926 --> 00:23:20.346 A:middle
and alert the administrator

00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:23.436 A:middle
that this other host name
has now claimed this account

00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:24.926 A:middle
so they can take
appropriate action.

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.146 A:middle
If I've mentioned
invitations already,

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:32.466 A:middle
that's part of bootstrapping
this program is

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:35.336 A:middle
that the administrator
needs it to invite each user

00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:39.116 A:middle
to link their Apple ID to
this particular VPP account

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.206 A:middle
so that licenses
can be assigned.

00:23:42.016 --> 00:23:45.386 A:middle
We strongly recommend that you
do this invitation via MDM.

00:23:46.016 --> 00:23:46.986 A:middle
You can easily send

00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:48.986 A:middle
that invitation via an
MDM command directly

00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:50.006 A:middle
to an enrolled device.

00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:52.526 A:middle
It's much more secure
and reliable.

00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:56.886 A:middle
Email is a fall back if you
have a user you need to invite

00:23:56.886 --> 00:23:58.636 A:middle
that doesn't currently
have an enrolled device.

00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.636 A:middle
But there's a concern that
you need to be aware of that


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.636 A:middle
But there's a concern that
you need to be aware of that

00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:05.616 A:middle
because the invitation URL,
there's an example on screen,

00:24:06.026 --> 00:24:08.356 A:middle
is for the apple.com domain.

00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:12.186 A:middle
Many mail servers will
treat an email coming

00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:15.986 A:middle
from your server's domain,
including a URL from apple.com

00:24:15.986 --> 00:24:18.136 A:middle
as a phishing attack and
they filter them out.

00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.526 A:middle
There are a number
of alternative ways

00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:21.506 A:middle
to avoid this problem.

00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:26.056 A:middle
You could create your invitation
email URL that brings the user,

00:24:26.056 --> 00:24:28.836 A:middle
first, back to your MDM
server before redirected them

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:29.936 A:middle
to the VPP URL.

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:33.456 A:middle
Or you could integrate the
invitation process right

00:24:33.456 --> 00:24:35.016 A:middle
into your user portal
if you have one.

00:24:35.566 --> 00:24:39.796 A:middle
Let's spend a few
moments talking, again,

00:24:39.796 --> 00:24:42.996 A:middle
about user IDs relating to
Volume Purchase Program.

00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:44.306 A:middle
I showed this slide last year.

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:49.616 A:middle
There are really 3 ideas of who
the user is from the perspective

00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:54.046 A:middle
of the MDM server, from the
perspective of the VPP service,

00:24:54.446 --> 00:24:56.296 A:middle
and the end user's Apple ID,

00:24:56.426 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
which your MDM server will never
see directly but will see a hash


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:56.426 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
which your MDM server will never
see directly but will see a hash

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.246 A:middle
of it to protect
the user's privacy.

00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:05.046 A:middle
Now, this is would be
very simple if we lived

00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:08.066 A:middle
in the ideal world
where each user had one

00:25:08.066 --> 00:25:11.376 A:middle
and only one Apple ID
associated with your VPP account

00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:13.276 A:middle
and would never change
that Apple ID.

00:25:13.276 --> 00:25:16.576 A:middle
In this case, there would be
a simple one to one mapping

00:25:16.616 --> 00:25:19.196 A:middle
between all 3 of these
representations of the user.

00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:22.126 A:middle
Sadly, as many of
you may be aware,

00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:23.496 A:middle
we don't live in an ideal world.

00:25:24.306 --> 00:25:28.236 A:middle
In the real world, multiple
VPP users can accept their

00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:30.266 A:middle
individual invitations
with the same Apple ID.

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:32.736 A:middle
And you need to be aware
of the implications

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:34.506 A:middle
of the sharing of Apple IDs.

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:38.786 A:middle
Specifically if you've
assigned a license to a user

00:25:38.786 --> 00:25:41.276 A:middle
that than is connected to
that particular Apple ID.

00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:43.606 A:middle
If you revoke that assignment,
it's going to revoke it

00:25:43.606 --> 00:25:47.156 A:middle
from every Apple every VPP
user sharing that Apple ID.

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:51.696 A:middle
Also, if you try to
assign an app or a book

00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:55.966 A:middle
to a VPP user that's
associated with an Apple ID

00:25:55.966 --> 00:25:59.276 A:middle
that already has that
app or book assigned,

00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:02.546 A:middle
that second assignment
will fail.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:02.546 A:middle
that second assignment
will fail.

00:26:02.546 --> 00:26:05.736 A:middle
Another issue in the real
world is that users can,

00:26:06.056 --> 00:26:08.606 A:middle
after accepting an
invitation with one Apple ID,

00:26:08.606 --> 00:26:12.016 A:middle
can disassociate from that Apple
ID and associate and accept

00:26:12.016 --> 00:26:13.786 A:middle
that invitation with
a different Apple ID.

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:16.956 A:middle
This becomes a problem if you've
assigned any irrevocable book

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:20.436 A:middle
licenses to that Apple,
that retired Apple ID.

00:26:20.436 --> 00:26:23.296 A:middle
And you'll have to keep track
and think about whether you want

00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:25.436 A:middle
to allocate another
irrevocable book license

00:26:25.436 --> 00:26:26.726 A:middle
to the new Apple ID or not.

00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
So the MDM server's
representation of the user,

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:34.686 A:middle
the client user ID string,

00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:37.076 A:middle
is something that's
under your control.

00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
And we strongly recommend
you pick a value

00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.926 A:middle
that will never change,
for example,

00:26:40.926 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
the user ID from your
directory services

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:45.056 A:middle
where you're getting your
user and group information.

00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:46.446 A:middle
You shouldn't choose something

00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:48.256 A:middle
like an email address
which can change.

00:26:48.746 --> 00:26:51.276 A:middle
And it's very simple.

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.246 A:middle
I had to have a slide with
some SQL on, I'm sorry.

00:26:53.246 --> 00:26:56.566 A:middle
It's very easy, then, to
look up which VPP account

00:26:56.566 --> 00:26:59.896 A:middle
that that particular MDM
user is associated with.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.606 --> 00:27:02.886 A:middle
Whether it's just registered
and you've sent the invitation

00:27:02.886 --> 00:27:05.746 A:middle
or actually associated, whether
the user has accepted it.

00:27:06.256 --> 00:27:10.576 A:middle
And, finally, the representation

00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:14.126 A:middle
of the user's Apple ID who's
accepted the invitation takes

00:27:14.126 --> 00:27:16.186 A:middle
the form of an iTunes
store ID hash.

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:18.216 A:middle
And you should track
this as soon

00:27:18.216 --> 00:27:20.136 A:middle
as a user has accepted
an invitation.

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:25.416 A:middle
New in iOS 8, there's now a
MDM query, not just in iOS 8,

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:29.386 A:middle
it's also in OS X Yosemite, a
query to get that hash value

00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:35.096 A:middle
so that you can know whether
the Apple ID that's configured

00:27:35.096 --> 00:27:36.966 A:middle
on a particular device changes.

00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.276 A:middle
You won't know exactly what the
Apple ID is but you'll be able

00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:40.836 A:middle
to tell if they've disassociated

00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:43.326 A:middle
and re-associated
with a different ID.

00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:46.726 A:middle
As I mentioned already on the
previous slide, you're going

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:50.866 A:middle
to want to track those retired
values if the user switches

00:27:50.866 --> 00:27:53.706 A:middle
to a different Apple ID,
again, so you can keep track

00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:55.456 A:middle
of any irrevocable
book assignments.

00:27:55.896 --> 00:28:01.196 A:middle
There's another new change
that will allow you MDM vendors


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:55.896 --> 00:28:01.196 A:middle
There's another new change
that will allow you MDM vendors

00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:03.766 A:middle
to provide a better user
experience in your tools

00:28:03.876 --> 00:28:07.696 A:middle
for users outside the U.S. that
we now report the country code

00:28:07.876 --> 00:28:10.726 A:middle
that the account is tied to
when you get your information

00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:13.476 A:middle
down from the service so that
you can fetch the proper app

00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:15.756 A:middle
metadata, artwork, description,

00:28:15.756 --> 00:28:18.546 A:middle
app name from the
correct iTunes Store.

00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
So managed apps is
not a new concept.

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.276 A:middle
We've had it for a
couple of iOS releases.

00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:30.626 A:middle
It's a way for enterprises
to keep better control

00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.926 A:middle
over the data and documents
tied to particular apps.

00:28:33.376 --> 00:28:36.026 A:middle
It works with both App
Store and enterprise apps.

00:28:36.906 --> 00:28:39.916 A:middle
The managed apps must
be installed via MDM

00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:42.296 A:middle
with the install
application command

00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:45.686 A:middle
and with the management
flag set on the app itself.

00:28:46.546 --> 00:28:49.286 A:middle
One limitation is that if the
user has already installed an

00:28:49.286 --> 00:28:51.596 A:middle
app, the MDM server
cannot convert it

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.926 A:middle
to manage retroactively.

00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:54.766 A:middle
However, the server
can, of course,

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:59.046 A:middle
detect that an app is unmanaged
and then alert the administrator

00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.766 A:middle
so they could take action
outside of MDM, if necessary,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.766 A:middle
so they could take action
outside of MDM, if necessary,

00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:05.306 A:middle
to have the user delete that app

00:29:05.306 --> 00:29:07.306 A:middle
and the MDM server
push it out again.

00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:13.576 A:middle
Managed apps work with Managed
Open In a new feature in iOS 7

00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:16.176 A:middle
to help, again, prevent
data leakage

00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:19.026 A:middle
from managed apps
to unmanaged apps.

00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:21.616 A:middle
So that if you have
a particular app

00:29:21.706 --> 00:29:25.156 A:middle
that has sensitive documents,
you can treat it as managed.

00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:28.216 A:middle
Turn on Managed Open In, and
then users will not be able

00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:30.256 A:middle
to open those documents
in other apps

00:29:30.256 --> 00:29:31.666 A:middle
like well, I won't name any.

00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:35.166 A:middle
So you might imagine, I
talked about filling gaps

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:37.646 A:middle
and eliminating inconsistencies.

00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:40.786 A:middle
We have managed apps so what
are we introducing in iOS 8?

00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:42.646 A:middle
Well, of course, managed books.

00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:46.326 A:middle
And just like managed
apps, managed books works

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:51.546 A:middle
with both iBookstore books where
you can, just like managed apps,

00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:55.446 A:middle
tell the device to download
a particular iBookstore book

00:29:55.446 --> 00:29:56.526 A:middle
and treat it as managed.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:59.096 A:middle
That that book must
be published,

00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:02.156 A:middle
purchased via VPP even
if the user has it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:02.156 A:middle
purchased via VPP even
if the user has it.

00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:07.126 A:middle
One difference between managed
books and managed apps is

00:30:07.126 --> 00:30:09.756 A:middle
that you can retroactively
manage books

00:30:09.756 --> 00:30:11.096 A:middle
in contrast to manage apps.

00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:12.436 A:middle
Even if the user
has it installed.

00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:15.566 A:middle
This is very useful
in schools to ensure

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:17.256 A:middle
that a particular
title is installed,

00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:19.226 A:middle
make sure the students
have all their work

00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:20.146 A:middle
and the dog didn't eat it.

00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:27.286 A:middle
Turning to enterprise books, you
can, just like enterprise apps,

00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:31.266 A:middle
can install the MDM
and remove PDFs, ePubs,

00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.496 A:middle
and iBooks Author books.

00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:36.746 A:middle
These documents or
these titles are stored

00:30:36.746 --> 00:30:38.736 A:middle
in a different location
than iBookstore books

00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
with Class C data protection.

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.176 A:middle
There are also a
number of restrictions

00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.096 A:middle
that we're introducing
in iOS 8 to, again,

00:30:45.096 --> 00:30:48.896 A:middle
give institutions
more confidence

00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:51.306 A:middle
that the sensitive
data will be protected

00:30:51.306 --> 00:30:53.526 A:middle
and not escape their control.

00:30:54.136 --> 00:30:57.496 A:middle
They can disable iCloud backups
of these enterprise books

00:30:58.136 --> 00:31:00.276 A:middle
so that they just stay on the
device where they're installed


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.136 --> 00:31:00.276 A:middle
so that they just stay on the
device where they're installed

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:04.006 A:middle
and also disable the
user's highlights and notes

00:31:04.006 --> 00:31:06.376 A:middle
on that title from being
synced to other devices.

00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:09.966 A:middle
For you MDM vendors out there,

00:31:09.966 --> 00:31:11.876 A:middle
it's going to be pretty straight
forward to implement this.

00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:14.606 A:middle
Just like there's an install
application MDM command,

00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:17.086 A:middle
there's now an Install
Media MDM command

00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:20.766 A:middle
where if it's a managed
iBookstore book,

00:31:20.766 --> 00:31:22.826 A:middle
you'll just specify
the iTunes store ID.

00:31:23.856 --> 00:31:26.946 A:middle
And if it's an enterprise
book, you'll specify a URL back

00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:28.596 A:middle
to your server to
download the bits.

00:31:29.696 --> 00:31:32.316 A:middle
You need to specify a persistent
ID that's under your control

00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:35.236 A:middle
so that you can uniquely
identify each enterprise book

00:31:35.236 --> 00:31:37.236 A:middle
that's being installed
and its kind

00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:40.106 A:middle
and then the matching
remove media command.

00:31:42.606 --> 00:31:44.256 A:middle
There are a few limitations.

00:31:45.026 --> 00:31:48.046 A:middle
Just like managed apps, is
requires the app installation

00:31:48.046 --> 00:31:49.116 A:middle
and the end enrollment, right,

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.696 A:middle
to be able to install
managed books.

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.666 A:middle
And managing iBookstore books
requires that you've, again,

00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:58.096 A:middle
purchased it via VPP and
that the App Store is enabled

00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
on the device that you're
pushing an enterprise book to.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
on the device that you're
pushing an enterprise book to.

00:32:02.336 --> 00:32:04.836 A:middle
Another distinction
between managed apps

00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:08.186 A:middle
and managed books is that the
MDM query to obtain the list

00:32:08.186 --> 00:32:11.136 A:middle
of installed books will
only show managed books

00:32:11.136 --> 00:32:13.406 A:middle
and not every book that's
installed by the user

00:32:13.526 --> 00:32:14.766 A:middle
to preserve user privacy.

00:32:15.786 --> 00:32:19.846 A:middle
And finally, again, to allow
the institutions to keep control

00:32:19.846 --> 00:32:21.806 A:middle
over these enterprise books
and their sensitive data,

00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:24.236 A:middle
enterprise books cannot
be synced off a device

00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:25.026 A:middle
using iTunes.

00:32:26.656 --> 00:32:29.066 A:middle
So turning from what's
new in iOS 8 to what's new

00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:31.046 A:middle
in OS X Yosemite, we're
going to fill another gap.

00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:34.826 A:middle
And we are, have
added the ability

00:32:34.826 --> 00:32:40.116 A:middle
to install non App Store
apps via MDM on OS X.

00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:40.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:43.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:47.226 A:middle
You can thank you Jussi
when he gets back up here.

00:32:47.316 --> 00:32:51.756 A:middle
So you can specify a signed flat
package containing an app via

00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:54.546 A:middle
this MDM command, the install
application MDM command

00:32:54.546 --> 00:32:58.366 A:middle
which is now supported on OS
X for non App Store books.

00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:02.006 A:middle
And, in fact, your MDM
solution can do the same thing


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:02.006 A:middle
And, in fact, your MDM
solution can do the same thing

00:33:02.006 --> 00:33:03.036 A:middle
that Profile Manager has done

00:33:03.036 --> 00:33:05.746 A:middle
that you can support the
administrator's providing you

00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:08.666 A:middle
with just a .app bundle
as long as you package it

00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:13.046 A:middle
up as a signed flat package and
send that over the MDM command.

00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:16.676 A:middle
So without any further ado,
instead of talking more

00:33:16.676 --> 00:33:19.026 A:middle
about this, I'd like to ask
Jussi and Mark to come back up

00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:20.496 A:middle
and show you installing

00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:23.046 A:middle
and removing enterprise
apps and books.

00:33:24.506 --> 00:33:24.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:33:24.926 --> 00:33:25.656 A:middle
Thank you, Todd.

00:33:26.416 --> 00:33:28.766 A:middle
And I'm just going to go
into my iBooks library.

00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:30.886 A:middle
So here we have some books
that we already downloaded.

00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
I've been a keen reader

00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:34.176 A:middle
of the Human Interface
Guidelines, apparently.

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:37.246 A:middle
And we just downloaded the
Swift book so we're going

00:33:37.246 --> 00:33:38.036 A:middle
to learn some new things.

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:41.406 A:middle
And Mark's now going to
push a PDF for the device.

00:33:41.816 --> 00:33:43.766 A:middle
So this is going to
be an enterprise book.

00:33:43.766 --> 00:33:47.976 A:middle
And this is will have
the same open rules

00:33:47.976 --> 00:33:51.496 A:middle
as any other managed
assets on the device.

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:53.696 A:middle
So we'll have data protection
between applications.

00:33:54.156 --> 00:33:58.186 A:middle
And we won't be able to
share the book anywhere else.

00:33:58.346 --> 00:34:01.596 A:middle
So this our fancy new PDF
that just got installed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.346 --> 00:34:01.596 A:middle
So this our fancy new PDF
that just got installed.

00:34:01.966 --> 00:34:04.986 A:middle
And now, since this is a
managed book controlled

00:34:04.986 --> 00:34:08.516 A:middle
by our MDM solution, Mark
can also remove the book.

00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:11.726 A:middle
So Mark can now remove the book

00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:13.706 A:middle
and it disappears
from our bookshelf.

00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:16.266 A:middle
So that's managing
books on iOS 8.

00:34:16.266 --> 00:34:17.146 A:middle
And we're.

00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:21.466 A:middle
Thank you.

00:34:22.676 --> 00:34:25.886 A:middle
And on iOS we've had the Apple
Teaching Store enterprise

00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:28.746 A:middle
application so that we have
our fancy new Swift application

00:34:28.746 --> 00:34:29.806 A:middle
here, ACME Hub.

00:34:30.226 --> 00:34:32.246 A:middle
But as Todd mentioned,
we also have support

00:34:32.246 --> 00:34:34.286 A:middle
for installing applications
on OS X.

00:34:34.676 --> 00:34:38.116 A:middle
So here we go into our
Launchpad and Mark is now going

00:34:38.116 --> 00:34:39.866 A:middle
to install our fancy ACME app

00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:43.356 A:middle
onto the OS X client
and no hands.

00:34:43.446 --> 00:34:46.045 A:middle
This is all installed
by the system.

00:34:46.426 --> 00:34:49.626 A:middle
So sparkles fly and the ACME
app landed on the system.

00:34:49.626 --> 00:34:53.936 A:middle
So over here's OS X using
the DEP app installation.

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:55.946 A:middle
So thank you, Mark.

00:34:55.946 --> 00:34:57.466 A:middle
And now back to Todd.

00:34:58.156 --> 00:34:58.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:34:58.686 --> 00:34:59.716 A:middle
Thank you very much, guys.

00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:01.426 A:middle
That app was written
using Swift, right?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:01.426 A:middle
That app was written
using Swift, right?

00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:02.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:35:03.156 --> 00:35:03.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; They stayed up all night.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:05.466 A:middle
All right.

00:35:05.746 --> 00:35:10.946 A:middle
So Mark and Jussi just showed
installing a PDF on iOS 8 device

00:35:10.946 --> 00:35:14.646 A:middle
and removing it as well as
installing an enterprise app

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:16.376 A:middle
on a Mac running OS X Yosemite.

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:20.196 A:middle
So let's proceed on to
our final section and talk

00:35:20.196 --> 00:35:22.146 A:middle
about ongoing management
of devices.

00:35:23.506 --> 00:35:26.076 A:middle
We're going to complete
the Activation Lock story

00:35:26.076 --> 00:35:27.956 A:middle
to show you, to talk
about how you use

00:35:27.956 --> 00:35:30.386 A:middle
that bypass code you
obtained at enrollment time.

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:33.636 A:middle
Talk a little bit about
integrating you're MDM solutions

00:35:33.636 --> 00:35:35.076 A:middle
with external data sources.

00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:39.486 A:middle
Talk about something new
called MDM service config.

00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:41.016 A:middle
We'll come on to that
in a few minutes.

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.286 A:middle
And, then again, conclude
with what's coming

00:35:43.286 --> 00:35:45.226 A:middle
in this year's OS releases.

00:35:46.906 --> 00:35:50.216 A:middle
So one thing to keep in mind
with Activation Lock is,

00:35:50.426 --> 00:35:53.216 A:middle
it's a little bit different
from some other services.

00:35:54.046 --> 00:35:55.916 A:middle
When you get the device
information query,

00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:57.576 A:middle
and Mark showed this
in Profile Manager

00:35:57.576 --> 00:35:59.876 A:middle
when he re fetched
the device information

00:35:59.876 --> 00:36:02.666 A:middle
and it reflected the change
and Activation Lock status.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.876 --> 00:36:02.666 A:middle
and it reflected the change
and Activation Lock status.

00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:05.116 A:middle
There's a key that tells you
whether the device thinks it's

00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:05.886 A:middle
Activation Locked.

00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:10.606 A:middle
And there's a request that
you send not to the device,

00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:13.756 A:middle
but to our activation server
to clear the Activation Lock

00:36:14.236 --> 00:36:16.336 A:middle
and specify the bypass
code that you have.

00:36:17.436 --> 00:36:19.696 A:middle
Now, because that request
doesn't go to the device,

00:36:20.736 --> 00:36:23.006 A:middle
the device isn't checking
with the activation server,

00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.926 A:middle
it's not going to know
that it's been cleared.

00:36:24.926 --> 00:36:26.536 A:middle
So it's going to
continue to report

00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:28.876 A:middle
that it's Activation
Locked to your MDM server.

00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:33.186 A:middle
Also, even after
you have cleared

00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:36.146 A:middle
on the activation server,
the user, if they log out of

00:36:36.146 --> 00:36:38.426 A:middle
or remove their Apple
ID and log in again,

00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:40.026 A:middle
that will re enable
Activation Lock.

00:36:40.476 --> 00:36:41.736 A:middle
So you want to definitely
keep hold

00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:43.496 A:middle
of that bypass code even
if you've cleared it.

00:36:43.796 --> 00:36:45.706 A:middle
This isn't going to,
in the real world,

00:36:45.706 --> 00:36:48.046 A:middle
going to usually be an issue
because typically you're going

00:36:48.046 --> 00:36:49.806 A:middle
to use this when you have
the device in your hands.

00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:52.406 A:middle
But you definitely want
to keep that bypass codes

00:36:52.406 --> 00:36:53.836 A:middle
because you might
need to use it again.

00:36:57.516 --> 00:36:57.886 A:middle
All right.

00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:01.296 A:middle
So one of the most important
external data sources


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:01.296 A:middle
So one of the most important
external data sources

00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:02.596 A:middle
that your MDM server
needs to integrate

00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:04.396 A:middle
with is directory services.

00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:05.746 A:middle
There are a number
of different ones

00:37:05.746 --> 00:37:07.986 A:middle
that your server
probably supports.

00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:11.506 A:middle
However, compared to
the database that's back

00:37:11.506 --> 00:37:12.616 A:middle
in your MDM solution,

00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:15.746 A:middle
most directory services
have some capabilities

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.996 A:middle
which make them limited
in this context.

00:37:19.146 --> 00:37:21.756 A:middle
Usually you can't get a full
enumeration of their contents.

00:37:22.336 --> 00:37:24.526 A:middle
And there's not an easy
way to discover the changes

00:37:24.526 --> 00:37:26.436 A:middle
from the last time you
fetched some subsection

00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:27.306 A:middle
of those contents.

00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:30.556 A:middle
They can be intermittently
available and slow.

00:37:31.156 --> 00:37:32.696 A:middle
So you're going to want
to need to mirror some

00:37:32.696 --> 00:37:34.606 A:middle
of the information
into your server.

00:37:34.996 --> 00:37:38.236 A:middle
In contrast, we've designed both
the Device Enrollment Program

00:37:38.236 --> 00:37:41.106 A:middle
service and the Volume Purchase
Program service to be simple

00:37:41.106 --> 00:37:43.996 A:middle
and efficient to mirror that
data into your MDM solution.

00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:46.946 A:middle
You can fully enumerate
the licenses for VPP

00:37:47.146 --> 00:37:49.316 A:middle
or the device list for the
Device Enrollment Program.

00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:51.806 A:middle
And it's easy to get the
changes from the last time

00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.056 A:middle
that you got the enumeration.

00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:55.436 A:middle
So you should definitely
mirror this information

00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:58.886 A:middle
down in your database and
not use those services

00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:01.816 A:middle
for live access.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:01.816 A:middle
for live access.

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:04.616 A:middle
Similarly, you're
going to want to mirror

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:06.386 A:middle
in the directory
services information

00:38:06.386 --> 00:38:08.296 A:middle
to get better performance
and reliability

00:38:08.296 --> 00:38:11.006 A:middle
and all the benefits
of your database.

00:38:11.526 --> 00:38:13.096 A:middle
But definitely leave
the authentication piece

00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:14.226 A:middle
in directory services.

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:16.086 A:middle
It's less frequently
used, and you need

00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:18.876 A:middle
to have a single source
of truth for that.

00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:20.196 A:middle
Also, you're not going to want

00:38:20.196 --> 00:38:21.946 A:middle
to mirror your entire
directory services

00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:23.306 A:middle
into your database, of course.

00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:26.256 A:middle
You want to just mirror in
records that are related to MDM.

00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:32.316 A:middle
Next, I want to talk about
a new concept that those

00:38:32.316 --> 00:38:34.426 A:middle
of you familiar with the
StoreBag from iTunes,

00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:36.466 A:middle
we could also call
this the URL bag.

00:38:37.676 --> 00:38:40.116 A:middle
It's something that would
make it much easier for tools

00:38:40.116 --> 00:38:42.586 A:middle
like Apple Configurator and
other device management tools

00:38:42.626 --> 00:38:46.686 A:middle
to just ask the MDM server what
information they can obtain

00:38:46.826 --> 00:38:47.746 A:middle
from it.

00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:51.866 A:middle
We specify this new
URI MDM service config

00:38:52.316 --> 00:38:57.096 A:middle
that any tool could then make
an unauthenticated HTTPS request

00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:01.616 A:middle
to your server and ask for it to
provide a UTF8 JSON encoded hash


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:01.616 A:middle
to your server and ask for it to
provide a UTF8 JSON encoded hash

00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:05.806 A:middle
for example, the URL for your
MDM server's Device Enrollment

00:39:05.806 --> 00:39:06.566 A:middle
Program enrollment.

00:39:07.356 --> 00:39:09.686 A:middle
This would allow a tool
like Apple Configurator

00:39:09.686 --> 00:39:12.576 A:middle
to make it much easier for
administrator to use it

00:39:12.576 --> 00:39:14.806 A:middle
to configure settings
because they wouldn't have

00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:16.596 A:middle
to type the entire
enrollment URL.

00:39:16.676 --> 00:39:19.186 A:middle
They'd only have to type
the domain of your server.

00:39:19.636 --> 00:39:22.176 A:middle
And it could then ask the
server what's your URL

00:39:22.176 --> 00:39:23.476 A:middle
and complete that for the user.

00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:26.396 A:middle
So we're going to
be implementing this

00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:28.826 A:middle
in Profile Manager and we strong
we would really like to see

00:39:28.826 --> 00:39:30.406 A:middle
that in your MDM
solutions as well.

00:39:31.856 --> 00:39:35.556 A:middle
So, again, let's turn to what's
coming new in iOS 8 in terms

00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:37.316 A:middle
of MDM commands and queries.

00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:38.756 A:middle
We've seen some of
these already.

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:42.136 A:middle
But it's now possible for
supervised devices to tell them

00:39:42.136 --> 00:39:44.076 A:middle
to set their device
name via MDM.

00:39:44.846 --> 00:39:47.426 A:middle
You can also clear the
restrictions passcode

00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.596 A:middle
in the user has themselves
configured

00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:53.126 A:middle
in the settings UI
restrictions and set a passcode.

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:56.616 A:middle
That would have prevented,
in the past the administrator

00:39:56.616 --> 00:39:58.216 A:middle
from overriding those
restrictions.

00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:02.046 A:middle
Now, you can send an MDM command
that removes those settings


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:02.046 A:middle
Now, you can send an MDM command
that removes those settings

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:05.426 A:middle
and allows the MDM server to
configure its own settings.

00:40:06.116 --> 00:40:07.556 A:middle
We've already seen
the new install

00:40:07.556 --> 00:40:11.306 A:middle
and remove media commands
as well as the query

00:40:11.306 --> 00:40:14.326 A:middle
that allows you to ask which
iTunes account is configured

00:40:14.326 --> 00:40:16.956 A:middle
on the device via the
iTunes Store ID hash.

00:40:17.486 --> 00:40:20.046 A:middle
But it's also now possible
to query the device to ask,

00:40:20.046 --> 00:40:21.946 A:middle
when did it last
back up to iCloud?

00:40:24.386 --> 00:40:26.646 A:middle
There are a number of new
payloads and additions

00:40:26.646 --> 00:40:28.346 A:middle
to existing payloads in iOS 8.

00:40:29.186 --> 00:40:31.106 A:middle
There's a new VPN
connection type.

00:40:32.376 --> 00:40:36.526 A:middle
We've added new plug in content
filters to expand on the built

00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:38.766 A:middle
in content filters that
we shipped in iOS 7.

00:40:40.136 --> 00:40:42.036 A:middle
There's a new payload,
called Managed Domains,

00:40:42.036 --> 00:40:43.686 A:middle
which we're going to show
you a little bit later

00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:46.976 A:middle
that you can have managed
email and web domains that work

00:40:46.976 --> 00:40:50.236 A:middle
in conjunction with managed apps
and books and managed open end

00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:53.846 A:middle
and help institutions
keep their data secure.

00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.366 A:middle
I think they actually mentioned,

00:40:57.416 --> 00:41:00.146 A:middle
Craig actually mentioned
the message S/MIME switch


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.416 --> 00:41:00.146 A:middle
Craig actually mentioned
the message S/MIME switch

00:41:00.146 --> 00:41:01.256 A:middle
in mail yesterday.

00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:03.316 A:middle
And it's possible to configure
whether that's available

00:41:03.316 --> 00:41:05.566 A:middle
to you user for both
email and exchange.

00:41:06.656 --> 00:41:09.616 A:middle
You can specify a certificate
in the single sign-on payload

00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:13.056 A:middle
that allows automatic refreshing
of the Kerberos credentials

00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:15.076 A:middle
without the user having
to take any action.

00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:17.556 A:middle
And there are a number
of new restrictions,

00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:20.536 A:middle
both for unsupervised devices,

00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:24.596 A:middle
the 5 at the top including
disabling the it's a really cool

00:41:24.596 --> 00:41:29.356 A:middle
feature Handoff, but that also
may worry certain institutions

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:32.646 A:middle
about data that they consider
sensitive transitioning

00:41:32.646 --> 00:41:36.126 A:middle
from a managed device to another
device outside of their control.

00:41:37.076 --> 00:41:39.346 A:middle
We also already saw
the restrictions

00:41:39.346 --> 00:41:40.626 A:middle
on enterprise books.

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:44.816 A:middle
And there are 2 new
supervised restrictions

00:41:45.516 --> 00:41:47.866 A:middle
that you can prevent the
user from erasing all content

00:41:47.866 --> 00:41:49.866 A:middle
and settings and wiping
the device and undoing all

00:41:49.866 --> 00:41:51.826 A:middle
that hard work you did
to configure that device.

00:41:52.606 --> 00:41:55.696 A:middle
As well as a pair
for the MDM command

00:41:55.696 --> 00:41:57.586 A:middle
that once you've
cleared the restrictions,

00:41:57.586 --> 00:41:58.966 A:middle
you can disable the user

00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:05.336 A:middle
from actually configuring them
using the device UI in settings.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:05.336 A:middle
from actually configuring them
using the device UI in settings.

00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:08.046 A:middle
Speaking of the device
UI in settings,

00:42:08.046 --> 00:42:10.036 A:middle
the iOS team has
done a lot of work

00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:12.496 A:middle
to dramatically improve
the end user experience

00:42:12.836 --> 00:42:15.696 A:middle
to see the effects
of an MDM enrollment

00:42:15.696 --> 00:42:17.816 A:middle
and any configuration profiles.

00:42:18.576 --> 00:42:22.586 A:middle
An MDM relationship is now
represented with a single item

00:42:23.046 --> 00:42:25.986 A:middle
that coalesces all the
profiles that are installed via

00:42:25.986 --> 00:42:29.576 A:middle
that MDM channel showing
all the settings, apps,

00:42:29.576 --> 00:42:32.036 A:middle
and books that have come down
via that MDM relationship

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.766 A:middle
with the most important
things likes accounts and apps

00:42:34.766 --> 00:42:36.426 A:middle
and books and restrictions
at the top.

00:42:37.286 --> 00:42:38.256 A:middle
What this also means is

00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:40.056 A:middle
that users cannot no
longer cherry pick

00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:41.696 A:middle
and remove individual profiles

00:42:41.696 --> 00:42:43.896 A:middle
that the MDM server has
delivered to the device

00:42:43.956 --> 00:42:45.386 A:middle
because they're just
not shown that way.

00:42:47.996 --> 00:42:49.736 A:middle
Another improvement
in the settings UI is

00:42:49.766 --> 00:42:52.216 A:middle
that if there are particular
features like the camera

00:42:52.216 --> 00:42:55.886 A:middle
or in the restrictions UI in
settings, it will indicate

00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:59.286 A:middle
to the user that this particular
feature has been disabled due

00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.606 A:middle
to a profile being installed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.606 A:middle
to a profile being installed.

00:43:01.536 --> 00:43:04.876 A:middle
So that they aren't confused
and need to come to Genius Bar

00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:06.286 A:middle
to ask them why their
camera's disabled.

00:43:08.426 --> 00:43:10.476 A:middle
It's also much easier to see
all the certificate details

00:43:10.476 --> 00:43:12.106 A:middle
that have been delivered
via MDM.

00:43:13.016 --> 00:43:16.396 A:middle
And finally provision profiles
no longer appear at all

00:43:16.396 --> 00:43:19.036 A:middle
in settings because it's handled
completely automatically.

00:43:19.426 --> 00:43:23.286 A:middle
The device will automatically
prune expired provision profiles

00:43:23.286 --> 00:43:23.976 A:middle
when they're no longer needed.

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:27.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:28.426 --> 00:43:29.696 A:middle
One less thing to worry about.

00:43:30.706 --> 00:43:35.006 A:middle
Turning to OS X Yosemite,
you'll see that we have support

00:43:35.006 --> 00:43:36.316 A:middle
for a number of the
new payloads.

00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:39.636 A:middle
I already talked about on
iOS 8 as well as the query

00:43:39.636 --> 00:43:42.956 A:middle
to determine which iTunes
account has been configured

00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:43.916 A:middle
on that particular Mac.

00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:48.596 A:middle
And we also have plugged another
gap in adding the command

00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:51.446 A:middle
that tells a Mac to
initiate AirPlay Mirroring

00:43:51.446 --> 00:43:52.406 A:middle
to a destination.

00:43:54.376 --> 00:43:56.356 A:middle
So without further ado,
I'm going to ask the guys

00:43:56.356 --> 00:43:59.156 A:middle
to come back up and show you a
few things that I just talked

00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:02.336 A:middle
about and completing
the device duty cycle.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:02.336 A:middle
about and completing
the device duty cycle.

00:44:03.086 --> 00:44:07.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we go to the settings and
we'll see what we have active

00:44:07.396 --> 00:44:10.226 A:middle
as manage settings
from our MDM server.

00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:14.376 A:middle
So you'll notice that you
don't have a profile setting

00:44:14.376 --> 00:44:15.266 A:middle
under general anymore.

00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:16.756 A:middle
This is called Device
Management.

00:44:17.026 --> 00:44:20.296 A:middle
If I just had regular
configuration profiles

00:44:20.296 --> 00:44:22.886 A:middle
installed, this tab
would be called Profiles.

00:44:23.126 --> 00:44:25.086 A:middle
If I have both Device
Management setting

00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:28.006 A:middle
and Profiles installed it will
be called Device Management

00:44:28.006 --> 00:44:28.536 A:middle
and Profiles.

00:44:29.016 --> 00:44:31.526 A:middle
So but since we only have the
MDM enrollment profile here,

00:44:31.976 --> 00:44:33.446 A:middle
I'm going to look into that.

00:44:33.446 --> 00:44:38.706 A:middle
And, as you notice, this now
a non-removable MDM profile.

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.646 A:middle
And you'll notice that
every single profile

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.286 A:middle
that the server has
pushed is now collated

00:44:44.316 --> 00:44:46.966 A:middle
into some sensical category.

00:44:46.966 --> 00:44:48.876 A:middle
So we have restrictions
so you can tell

00:44:49.206 --> 00:44:51.586 A:middle
which restrictions have been
configured by the server.

00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:56.196 A:middle
And we have applications that
have been installed here.

00:44:56.566 --> 00:44:58.786 A:middle
And we have also accounts
that have been configured.

00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:01.396 A:middle
So we don't show the
individual profiles


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:01.396 A:middle
So we don't show the
individual profiles

00:45:01.556 --> 00:45:02.846 A:middle
that actually configured this.

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.666 A:middle
We just collate all
this information

00:45:04.666 --> 00:45:07.406 A:middle
so that's it's more readily
accessible and discoverable.

00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.366 A:middle
And in more details,
as Todd mentioned,

00:45:10.366 --> 00:45:12.946 A:middle
we have better information
about certificates.

00:45:12.946 --> 00:45:16.556 A:middle
We can now actually see the full
signatures and how they keyed it

00:45:16.556 --> 00:45:18.296 A:middle
up so it's not just
like dot, dot, dot.

00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:21.836 A:middle
And you can also
have information

00:45:21.836 --> 00:45:23.766 A:middle
about other settings
that come down.

00:45:23.956 --> 00:45:25.746 A:middle
And here we have
managed domains.

00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:27.896 A:middle
So I'm going to show
you managed domains.

00:45:27.896 --> 00:45:29.836 A:middle
How those are working in mail.

00:45:30.196 --> 00:45:33.416 A:middle
So we are in ACME, Inc.

00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:34.886 A:middle
in acmeinc.private.

00:45:34.886 --> 00:45:37.766 A:middle
And as I'm going to
start composing an email,

00:45:38.156 --> 00:45:40.726 A:middle
I'm going to pick
mark@mdm.apple.com.

00:45:41.106 --> 00:45:43.116 A:middle
And this is now Mark's address.

00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:46.346 A:middle
This is not something that I
should probably be sending email

00:45:46.516 --> 00:45:48.266 A:middle
to so it's marked as red.

00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:51.476 A:middle
If I use a different address,

00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:55.656 A:middle
use my acme in private mail
that's marked as a valid email

00:45:55.906 --> 00:45:58.676 A:middle
that meets our email rules.

00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:00.736 A:middle
And this also applies
to my sending account


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:00.736 A:middle
And this also applies
to my sending account

00:46:00.736 --> 00:46:03.426 A:middle
so since I have configured
this device for iCloud,

00:46:03.426 --> 00:46:05.016 A:middle
I also have my iCloud account.

00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:08.566 A:middle
So my iCloud account
is also marked

00:46:08.826 --> 00:46:12.476 A:middle
as not something I should
be sending mail with.

00:46:12.716 --> 00:46:15.276 A:middle
So that's managed
domains inside mail.

00:46:17.526 --> 00:46:20.446 A:middle
And then we are basically
done with the device.

00:46:20.656 --> 00:46:22.686 A:middle
So now we can return
this device to service

00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.166 A:middle
so the next user is going
to grab this machine.

00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:26.656 A:middle
And what Mark's going to do,

00:46:26.656 --> 00:46:30.236 A:middle
he's going to issue an erase
command onto the device.

00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:34.196 A:middle
So basically the user has left
the company or has graduated

00:46:34.196 --> 00:46:36.966 A:middle
from the school and
magic happens now.

00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:39.086 A:middle
So we're going to unplug
this device and plug

00:46:39.136 --> 00:46:39.976 A:middle
to a different device.

00:46:41.216 --> 00:46:42.166 A:middle
So here we go.

00:46:42.716 --> 00:46:47.376 A:middle
And now we have just
received the same device

00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:49.846 A:middle
and we're back in
the home screen.

00:46:50.106 --> 00:46:52.866 A:middle
I'm going to as a new
user, I'm going to walk

00:46:52.866 --> 00:46:55.726 A:middle
through the setup screens
and configure this device.

00:46:55.726 --> 00:46:55.826 A:middle
So.

00:46:55.996 --> 00:46:59.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This a device that's come
back for the duty cycle.

00:46:59.496 --> 00:47:02.656 A:middle
And I've got the Activation Lock
bypass code for this device.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.496 --> 00:47:02.656 A:middle
And I've got the Activation Lock
bypass code for this device.

00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:04.896 A:middle
And so he's just
going to walk through,

00:47:04.896 --> 00:47:07.536 A:middle
go ahead, and set it up.

00:47:07.806 --> 00:47:11.116 A:middle
And when he encounters the fact
that it's locked, I'll be able

00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:12.596 A:middle
to clear it; and he'll be able

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:15.656 A:middle
to actually finish
activation and continue on.

00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:18.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So as soon
as the device talks

00:47:18.216 --> 00:47:20.986 A:middle
to the Apple services
again, I'm getting prompted

00:47:20.986 --> 00:47:24.666 A:middle
for some random Apple ID because
the previous user had enabled

00:47:24.666 --> 00:47:27.116 A:middle
iCloud even though this
was a supervised device,

00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:29.956 A:middle
we had allowed people
to use find my iPad

00:47:30.356 --> 00:47:33.236 A:middle
and now I have no idea what
this user's account is,

00:47:33.486 --> 00:47:37.946 A:middle
so Mark has just issued an
Activation Lock unlock command

00:47:38.046 --> 00:47:41.466 A:middle
from Profile Manager
and if I now go back

00:47:41.466 --> 00:47:46.976 A:middle
to the activation phase, now
I'm going to prompted to enroll

00:47:46.976 --> 00:47:50.586 A:middle
in my MDM server, again all
ACME help desk for an issue.

00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:53.836 A:middle
And my next user is now
going to get prompted

00:47:53.836 --> 00:47:56.866 A:middle
to enter their password,
and we're good to go.

00:47:57.126 --> 00:48:00.456 A:middle
So that's the duty cycle
of using iPads with MDM


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.126 --> 00:48:00.456 A:middle
So that's the duty cycle
of using iPads with MDM

00:48:00.456 --> 00:48:02.306 A:middle
and Device Enrollment Program.

00:48:02.306 --> 00:48:04.546 A:middle
So thank you, Mark,
and back to Todd.

00:48:04.836 --> 00:48:07.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So Jussi just gave you a
brief tour of the new easier

00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:11.736 A:middle
to understand user interface
in settings in iOS 8.

00:48:11.736 --> 00:48:15.376 A:middle
Make it easier for a user to
understand what the impacts

00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:17.436 A:middle
of that MDM relationship
is on their device.

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:20.926 A:middle
Showed you how managed
email domains work

00:48:21.206 --> 00:48:25.866 A:middle
to help users prevent data
leakage sending documents

00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:26.996 A:middle
to the wrong email addresses.

00:48:27.836 --> 00:48:30.976 A:middle
We also showed how to use the
Activation Lock bypass code

00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:33.906 A:middle
that we captured when enrolling
device to enable the device

00:48:33.906 --> 00:48:35.606 A:middle
to be wiped and returned
to service

00:48:35.886 --> 00:48:37.166 A:middle
by completing the duty cycle.

00:48:37.766 --> 00:48:39.266 A:middle
And, again, getting that device

00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:41.056 A:middle
through Device Enrollment
Program settings

00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:42.856 A:middle
to reenroll in your
MDM solution.

00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:46.086 A:middle
That brings us to the
end of our session.

00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:48.166 A:middle
I'd like to sum up for, again,

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:49.776 A:middle
the different audiences
for this session.

00:48:49.996 --> 00:48:51.116 A:middle
If you're an administrator,

00:48:51.466 --> 00:48:53.526 A:middle
you should use the Device
Enrollment Program if you want

00:48:53.526 --> 00:48:56.316 A:middle
to enroll your devices
wirelessly or Apple Configurator

00:48:56.316 --> 00:48:57.356 A:middle
if you want to do it wired.

00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.926 A:middle
You should use the Volume
Purchase Program managed


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.926 A:middle
You should use the Volume
Purchase Program managed

00:49:00.926 --> 00:49:02.916 A:middle
distribution and
managed apps and books

00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:04.836 A:middle
to distribute content
to your devices.

00:49:05.486 --> 00:49:07.106 A:middle
If you are a MDM
solution provider,

00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:09.366 A:middle
please support all
these services:

00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:11.906 A:middle
Device Enrollment Program,
Volume Purchase Program,

00:49:11.946 --> 00:49:14.306 A:middle
and Activation Lock
management as well

00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:16.136 A:middle
as all the new futures
we talked about today

00:49:16.266 --> 00:49:18.366 A:middle
in both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:20.286 A:middle
If you're an app developer,

00:49:20.836 --> 00:49:24.166 A:middle
for your enterprise we've got
this great new page that talks

00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:26.746 A:middle
about how you can use
iOS to the best effect

00:49:26.746 --> 00:49:29.016 A:middle
within your enterprise
doing in-house development.

00:49:30.306 --> 00:49:31.966 A:middle
We have a number of
resources, again,

00:49:31.966 --> 00:49:34.506 A:middle
for developers both
MDM and app developers.

00:49:34.706 --> 00:49:37.116 A:middle
Our documentation
of or MDM protocol,

00:49:37.116 --> 00:49:38.756 A:middle
the configuration
profile reference,

00:49:39.206 --> 00:49:40.596 A:middle
the developer forums for MDM.

00:49:40.596 --> 00:49:43.596 A:middle
And if there are any
administrators out there,

00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:46.976 A:middle
we've got documentation for
the Device Enrollment Program

00:49:47.106 --> 00:49:50.036 A:middle
and Apple Configurator and a
number of discussion boards

00:49:50.036 --> 00:49:52.436 A:middle
that are great places to ask
your questions and get help,

00:49:52.786 --> 00:49:54.646 A:middle
both from your fellow
administrators

00:49:54.646 --> 00:49:56.556 A:middle
and Apple representatives.

00:49:58.116 --> 00:50:01.466 A:middle
There are a number of additional
sessions this week including 2


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.116 --> 00:50:01.466 A:middle
There are a number of additional
sessions this week including 2

00:50:01.466 --> 00:50:03.826 A:middle
following this session right
here in Pacific Heights.

00:50:04.476 --> 00:50:07.896 A:middle
Some of our colleagues that help
make that great new UI in iOS

00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:09.526 A:middle
and implement a lot
of these features.

00:50:10.026 --> 00:50:12.306 A:middle
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention

00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:14.166 A:middle
and hope you have a
great rest of the show.

00:50:14.496 --> 00:50:14.856 A:middle
Thank you.
