00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:14.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Hello everybody.

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:16.315 A:middle
My name is Dave Wilson.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.986 A:middle
I'm on the iAd team and
I'm here to talk to you

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.556 A:middle
about optimizing your
earning power with iAd.

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.916 A:middle
For those of you who
don't know somehow,

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:29.276 A:middle
iAd is Apple's digital
advertising platform.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:31.466 A:middle
This is what's used --
you may have seen it

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.326 A:middle
in other apps you've
used on iOS.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:35.836 A:middle
If you use iTunes Radio at
all, the ads that you see

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.426 A:middle
in iTunes Radio are
driven by iAd.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:40.066 A:middle
So that's what iAd is.

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.646 A:middle
There's two parts to
this presentation.

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.946 A:middle
We're going to be talking
first about monetization;

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:48.126 A:middle
how you can use iAd
inside your apps

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:49.576 A:middle
to drive revenue for your apps.

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:52.936 A:middle
And the second part is
promotion; how you can use iAd

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.296 A:middle
to get more downloads of
your app to get more users

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:58.546 A:middle
of your app -- to get your app
out in everyone else's hands.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:01.986 A:middle
So let's start off
with monetization.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:01.986 A:middle
So let's start off
with monetization.

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:03.806 A:middle
I'm going to start off

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.826 A:middle
with a few different pieces
we're going to talk about here.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:07.966 A:middle
Talk about some developer
benefits;

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.626 A:middle
what iAd can do for you.

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:14.146 A:middle
Talk about some core concepts;
sort of an advertising 101.

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.186 A:middle
We'll talk about improving
performance; how you can sort

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.666 A:middle
of best use iAd and
get the most out of it.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:22.956 A:middle
We'll talk some details about
the actual code you have

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:24.706 A:middle
to write to integrate
iAd inside your app,

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.586 A:middle
which is fortunately
pretty simple.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.656 A:middle
We'll talk a little
bit about testing iAd

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.076 A:middle
and making sure your integration
is actually working before you

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:32.606 A:middle
get out in the app store
and then just get bugs

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:37.366 A:middle
So let's start off with
developer benefits.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:44.326 A:middle
First of all, iAd provides
rich, engaging ads.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:49.856 A:middle
This is a platform that
values great ads to go

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:51.986 A:middle
into the great apps
that you create.

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:55.506 A:middle
They're high production values.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:57.966 A:middle
There's rich media apps

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.776 A:middle
and there's rich media
ads involved here.

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:01.596 A:middle
These are things
that involve video.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:01.596 A:middle
These are things
that involve video.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.756 A:middle
They involve animations.

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:06.266 A:middle
They're immersive.

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:10.116 A:middle
These are sometimes entire
games presented inside ads.

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:11.926 A:middle
There was an Intel ad recently

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.866 A:middle
that was literally a game
once the users tapped on it.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:15.936 A:middle
This is the other things

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.336 A:middle
that your users are actually
interested in engaging on,

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.836 A:middle
interested in tapping on,
which is great for you

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.556 A:middle
as a potential advertising
publisher here.

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.806 A:middle
These are award-winning ads.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:30.946 A:middle
These are not just fly by
night, you know, one off apps --

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:33.376 A:middle
or ads with link tags
in them that are going

00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:34.596 A:middle
to annoy the heck
out of your users.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
These are carefully crafted ads

00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:39.286 A:middle
that actually look good
as part of your app.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.536 A:middle
Okay? In addition, Apple
is providing this SDK.

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:49.686 A:middle
As a result, the same care
that Apple takes with respect

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:53.966 A:middle
to privacy and power efficiency
on the rest of Apple's system,

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.436 A:middle
Apple invests in iAd as well.

00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:00.556 A:middle
That means that we take
care of all of the power


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:00.556 A:middle
That means that we take
care of all of the power

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:03.166 A:middle
and privacy considerations
for you

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.596 A:middle
so you don't have
to worry about them.

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:05.546 A:middle
You don't need to worry

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:07.876 A:middle
about obeying the limit
ad tracking switch.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:08.866 A:middle
You don't need to obey about --

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.716 A:middle
don't need to worry about
location permissions

00:03:11.896 --> 00:03:15.506 A:middle
or making sure that
your users' privacy

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.596 A:middle
and personal data is
protected properly.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.056 A:middle
In addition, because this
is an Apple-provided SDK,

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:26.556 A:middle
it's part of the iOS SDK.

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:27.606 A:middle
Integration is simple.

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:29.726 A:middle
There's nothing else to install.

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.036 A:middle
There are no static
libraries to include.

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.766 A:middle
There's no third-party
headers to drop

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.146 A:middle
into your project to
clutter things up.

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:36.606 A:middle
It's all there to begin with.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.136 A:middle
You can be up and
running with minimal code.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.756 A:middle
As we're going to see later,
it's about two lines of code

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.706 A:middle
to get banners in your app.

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:49.106 A:middle
In addition, along with the
rest of the code that other --

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:51.636 A:middle
along with the rest of the
SDK that Apple provides,

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:54.096 A:middle
there's great documentation
and great sample code available

00:03:54.096 --> 00:03:56.096 A:middle
to you on the websites.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:59.436 A:middle
iAd has global reach.

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:00.786 A:middle
We're in 14 countries now.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:00.786 A:middle
We're in 14 countries now.

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:02.486 A:middle
We're constantly expanding.

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:03.816 A:middle
This a larger list of countries

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:05.086 A:middle
than we showed up
here last year.

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:08.786 A:middle
And that means that you're
going to get ads in all

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:10.516 A:middle
of those countries
inside your app.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.186 A:middle
So as soon as you get your
app in all those countries,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.256 A:middle
you're going to be
able to get revenue

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:15.326 A:middle
in those countries as well.

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:20.906 A:middle
Just like the actual
app purchase

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:24.106 A:middle
and then in-app purchases as
well, you're going to get 70%

00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:27.196 A:middle
of the advertising revenue
from iAd inside your app.

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.996 A:middle
Apple takes its 30% share and
everything else goes to you

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.346 A:middle
from whatever we take
in from the advertisers

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:38.666 A:middle
who are producing these
ads to run inside your app.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.046 A:middle
It's very easy for you to
get into the iAd ecosystem.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:47.176 A:middle
There's an iAd contract on the
itunesconnect.apple.com site

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:47.926 A:middle
that you have to sign.

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:49.186 A:middle
That's pretty easy.

00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:51.726 A:middle
You integrate the iAd
framework; that's what the rest

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:52.896 A:middle
of this talk is going
to be about.

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.876 A:middle
And then, you submit
your app for review,

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:56.696 A:middle
and that's really
all you have to do.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
Okay. So that's sort of
what iAd can do for you.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.696 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
Okay. So that's sort of
what iAd can do for you.

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:03.956 A:middle
Let's talk about
some core concepts.

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.856 A:middle
These are some fundamental
basics of advertising

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.406 A:middle
and some terminology
that you're going to see,

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:12.966 A:middle
especially on the iTunes Connect
website once you've integrated

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:17.106 A:middle
iAd and are trying to track the
progress of you getting revenue

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:19.236 A:middle
from iAd inside your app.

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:23.186 A:middle
First of all, there's an
ad request and you're going

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:24.506 A:middle
to see this come up again.

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.906 A:middle
Later, you'll see
this in metrics.

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:27.036 A:middle
What is an ad request?

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:28.606 A:middle
It's a network request.

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:30.936 A:middle
It goes from the device,
through the iAd framework.

00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:34.206 A:middle
It's going to go out to the
iAd servers up in the cloud,

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:37.006 A:middle
and hopefully, ads will
come back down to you,

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.836 A:middle
assuming there are ads available
for your particular app

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:43.206 A:middle
in the current situation
of the user.

00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:46.526 A:middle
You know, again, if the user
is in a country we're not in,

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:48.986 A:middle
you're not going to be able to
get ads there, unfortunately.

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.616 A:middle
Once you've started
getting ads from the --

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:56.336 A:middle
if you get an ad request, you
want to look at your fill-rate.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:00.526 A:middle
This is the ratio of ads
delivered by the ad service


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:00.526 A:middle
This is the ratio of ads
delivered by the ad service

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:03.056 A:middle
to the number of requests that
you actually make to the server.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.796 A:middle
This is, again, going
to be determined

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:08.426 A:middle
by where your users are located,
what type of app you have,

00:06:08.426 --> 00:06:11.786 A:middle
how well your app has
done with iAd in the past.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:13.356 A:middle
And we'll get to that
in a little bit --

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:16.556 A:middle
a little later, as to how
that can be really important

00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:18.106 A:middle
in driving your fill-rate.

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:22.496 A:middle
Once you've gotten ads,
you've gotten your fill-rate

00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:23.906 A:middle
and you've shown
ads to the user,

00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:26.216 A:middle
there's a constant called
the tap-through rate.

00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:28.026 A:middle
This is the number of the ads

00:06:28.026 --> 00:06:30.266 A:middle
that your user has
actually tapped on

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:33.276 A:middle
and this does not
count accidental taps.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.716 A:middle
So if the tap -- if the
user just taps on it

00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:36.106 A:middle
and then closes it because
they didn't really mean,

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:37.256 A:middle
that doesn't count.

00:06:37.256 --> 00:06:40.606 A:middle
This is the number of taps
that the user actually meant

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:43.036 A:middle
to have happen relative
to the number

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.556 A:middle
of ads you displayed
to that user.

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:45.626 A:middle
This is something
you want to attempt

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:48.006 A:middle
to maximize inside your app.

00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:50.916 A:middle
Again, though, accidental
taps don't count.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:53.346 A:middle
So trying to play games
is not a good idea.

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:56.476 A:middle
Ad engagement.

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:01.386 A:middle
Obviously, you need
to display the ad.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:01.386 A:middle
Obviously, you need
to display the ad.

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:03.426 A:middle
If you're not displaying
the ad to the user,

00:07:03.426 --> 00:07:05.036 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many of them you request

00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:08.406 A:middle
from the server, you're not
going to get paid for them

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:10.046 A:middle
and you might as well
not have bothered.

00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:16.046 A:middle
Once you do that, make sure it's
actually fully visible as well.

00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:19.916 A:middle
The fact that it's onscreen and
only one pixel of it is showing

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:21.466 A:middle
because you've got it covered
up with something else,

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:22.936 A:middle
that doesn't really
count either.

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.756 A:middle
You want to make sure
that the ad is visible

00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:26.836 A:middle
for as long as possible.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.096 A:middle
Leave it onscreen.

00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:32.406 A:middle
Again, if it shows
up and it flashes

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:34.866 A:middle
for two seconds, no
one really saw it.

00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:35.516 A:middle
It doesn't matter.

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:37.746 A:middle
You want to make sure
that ads are onscreen.

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:40.096 A:middle
This is -- has two benefits.

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:41.996 A:middle
One, it's not distracting
to your user.

00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:44.236 A:middle
You're not annoying people
by flashing things on

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:46.376 A:middle
and offscreen all the time that
people really don't want to see.

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.916 A:middle
In addition, the user has
time to interact with it.

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:50.936 A:middle
They have time to see it.

00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:52.336 A:middle
They have time to
see its message.

00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:53.536 A:middle
They have time to say, hey.

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:55.826 A:middle
You know, I'd actually like to
tap on this and engage with it

00:07:55.826 --> 00:07:59.656 A:middle
and see what's going
on under the hood.

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
That leads into allow
interaction.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
That leads into allow
interaction.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:04.066 A:middle
It's really easy to
put something onscreen

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:05.506 A:middle
and accidentally cover it up,

00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:07.686 A:middle
especially accidentally
covering it up with something

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:09.066 A:middle
that blocks user interaction.

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:12.236 A:middle
If you put a banner onscreen,
you cover it up with something

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:14.746 A:middle
that is, say, a transparent view

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:17.256 A:middle
that does not allow user
interaction; the user can't tap

00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:18.086 A:middle
on the banner under the hood.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.506 A:middle
That's not a good
situation for the ad.

00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:22.056 A:middle
The user is going to
be trying to tap on it,

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:23.406 A:middle
nothing's going to happen.

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:25.736 A:middle
It's going to be
a bad experience.

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:28.446 A:middle
In addition, again,
you're not going

00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:30.576 A:middle
to get the revenue you're hoping
for in this sort of situation

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.515 A:middle
because the ad wasn't
really onscreen.

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:37.405 A:middle
Okay. So there's some
sort of core concepts.

00:08:37.405 --> 00:08:39.035 A:middle
Talk a little bit
about what you can do

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:40.746 A:middle
to improve the performance

00:08:40.746 --> 00:08:43.645 A:middle
of iAd once you've actually
integrated it inside your app.

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:46.836 A:middle
First of all, revenue
starts with your app.

00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:49.296 A:middle
If you don't have a great app,

00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:51.746 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many banners you show,

00:08:51.746 --> 00:08:53.176 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many ads you show.

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.406 A:middle
No one is using your app

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:55.806 A:middle
and you're not going
to make any money.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.096 A:middle
So the number one thing you
can do to drive revenue via ads


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.096 A:middle
So the number one thing you
can do to drive revenue via ads

00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:02.736 A:middle
in your app is to start
off with a great app.

00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:07.316 A:middle
And that's what the rest of WWDC
is about, but a couple of sort

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:08.556 A:middle
of small things we
can mention here.

00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:11.136 A:middle
First of all, app
engagement time.

00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:13.686 A:middle
If your -- if you
have an app that's --

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:18.126 A:middle
you're trying to drive
revenue by showing ads,

00:09:18.636 --> 00:09:20.936 A:middle
you need to make sure that your
have sufficient engagement time

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:23.096 A:middle
for your users to
actually do this.

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:26.256 A:middle
If it's a utility app that
the user is going to pull up,

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:28.606 A:middle
it's going to be onscreen
for about three seconds,

00:09:28.606 --> 00:09:30.396 A:middle
and then they're going
to close your app again,

00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:33.636 A:middle
that's not enough time to
actually show ads to the users

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:36.666 A:middle
and allow interaction and to get
interaction from those users.

00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.996 A:middle
So you need an app that
actually is going to be onscreen

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:43.756 A:middle
and that people are actually
going to engage with.

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:46.436 A:middle
Again, once you've done
that, you want to make sure

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:49.486 A:middle
that the ad is placed
carefully within that app.

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.396 A:middle
Think about what
the user is doing

00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:52.636 A:middle
on the various screens
of your app.

00:09:52.636 --> 00:09:56.046 A:middle
Make sure the ad is placed
appropriately within the app.

00:09:56.046 --> 00:09:58.486 A:middle
If you have a game,
for instance,

00:09:58.606 --> 00:10:01.866 A:middle
and the user is tapping and
swiping and slicing constantly,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.606 --> 00:10:01.866 A:middle
and the user is tapping and
swiping and slicing constantly,

00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:04.746 A:middle
maybe that's not a great place
for a banner where they're going

00:10:04.746 --> 00:10:05.976 A:middle
to be accidentally tapping.

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.956 A:middle
The ad will pop up over
the top of everything.

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:11.206 A:middle
You're going to be annoying
your users and you're going

00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:18.216 A:middle
to be harming your app more than
you're helping it with the ads.

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:21.556 A:middle
Okay? Pulling back into app
engagement time, user loyalty.

00:10:22.006 --> 00:10:24.246 A:middle
You need to come -- you
need your users to come back

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:26.446 A:middle
to the app repeatedly.

00:10:27.136 --> 00:10:28.656 A:middle
That's how you get
more screen time,

00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:30.766 A:middle
that's how you get more ad
time for those particular --

00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:33.446 A:middle
for showing ads to those users.

00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:37.396 A:middle
In addition, user loyalty
is what drives ad --

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:40.046 A:middle
or app engagement and
what drives app downloads.

00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:42.606 A:middle
The sort of network effects that
you may have heard of before.

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:45.406 A:middle
The more people are using
your app, the more they want

00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:47.146 A:middle
to use it, the more they're
going to tell their friends

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.286 A:middle
about using it, the more
downloads you're going to get.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.486 A:middle
Therefore, the more eyeballs
you're going to get looking

00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:52.966 A:middle
at ads within your app.

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:57.606 A:middle
Okay? I mentioned that
iAd is in 14 countries.

00:10:57.806 --> 00:11:00.846 A:middle
That means that your app should
be in 14 countries if you want


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.806 --> 00:11:00.846 A:middle
That means that your app should
be in 14 countries if you want

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:06.676 A:middle
to get as most -- the most
revenue from iAd as you can.

00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:09.336 A:middle
Market your app to the
countries where iAd actually is.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.016 A:middle
If you're -- if you've spent
the time to integrate iAd

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:14.556 A:middle
into your app, you want to make
sure that your app is in all

00:11:14.556 --> 00:11:18.346 A:middle
of the places that iAd is so you
have the largest reach possible

00:11:18.346 --> 00:11:21.136 A:middle
to potentially get the most
users possible for your app.

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:24.486 A:middle
A big part of that is
localizing your app.

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:27.326 A:middle
If the only thing you've done
is write your app in English

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:29.916 A:middle
and you're trying to get it
in all 14 of these countries,

00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:31.266 A:middle
you're going to have a
hard time in countries

00:11:31.466 --> 00:11:33.056 A:middle
where English has
a small presence.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.806 A:middle
Make sure you take the time to
localize your app appropriately

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:38.066 A:middle
to drive users in
those countries.

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:43.596 A:middle
And back into ad
placement a little bit,

00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:46.126 A:middle
because this is a piece I'm
going to keep coming back to,

00:11:46.126 --> 00:11:50.016 A:middle
ad placement is extraordinarily
important within your app.

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:54.046 A:middle
You will recognize high-use
areas inside your app

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.356 A:middle
and you want to make sure you
put banners inside those areas.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.056 A:middle
Those are the places where
users are going to be looking


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.056 A:middle
Those are the places where
users are going to be looking

00:12:00.056 --> 00:12:01.406 A:middle
at the screen for a
long period of time.

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:02.736 A:middle
They're going to
have the opportunity

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:03.726 A:middle
to see the app -- the ad.

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:04.896 A:middle
They're going to
have the opportunity

00:12:04.896 --> 00:12:06.176 A:middle
to engage with the ad.

00:12:06.656 --> 00:12:09.326 A:middle
At the same time,
as I mentioned,

00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:10.906 A:middle
avoid accidental taps.

00:12:10.906 --> 00:12:15.016 A:middle
Accidental taps are bad for your
user and they're bad for you.

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
They're going to annoy
your user and iAd doesn't

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:19.856 A:middle
like accidental taps either.

00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:23.096 A:middle
So you want to make sure that
you are using the framework

00:12:23.096 --> 00:12:24.966 A:middle
in a way that does
not encourage them.

00:12:24.966 --> 00:12:29.816 A:middle
Because your app will ultimately
end up being penalized for this.

00:12:29.926 --> 00:12:31.346 A:middle
User context is really
important.

00:12:32.556 --> 00:12:35.506 A:middle
You want to want advantage of
different types of ads based

00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:38.586 A:middle
on what the user is
doing at any given time.

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:41.526 A:middle
Say the user is on the
menu screen of your game.

00:12:41.526 --> 00:12:42.936 A:middle
Maybe that's a great
place to put a banner

00:12:42.936 --> 00:12:43.846 A:middle
at the bottom of the screen.

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:45.226 A:middle
They're looking at the menu.

00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:47.526 A:middle
Maybe they notice the app
-- or the ad at the bottom.

00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:48.886 A:middle
Maybe they tap on it
and engage with it.

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:52.526 A:middle
At the same time, if they tap
to go into the first level

00:12:52.526 --> 00:12:55.816 A:middle
of your game and you immediately
pop a full-fledged ad

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:58.506 A:middle
and interrupt their experience
once they've done their first

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:01.156 A:middle
action inside the game, that's
just going to annoy them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:01.156 A:middle
action inside the game, that's
just going to annoy them.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.376 A:middle
You're going to drive
users away.

00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:04.716 A:middle
Users aren't going to want
to engage with the ads.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.866 A:middle
That's what you want
to try to avoid.

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:10.106 A:middle
So be very careful about
where you're putting the ads

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:13.186 A:middle
within your app.

00:13:13.446 --> 00:13:16.766 A:middle
Once you've integrated iAd
and you can start looking

00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:19.206 A:middle
on the website, you'll
start getting reports

00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:20.006 A:middle
about your revenue.

00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:21.866 A:middle
One of the things
you're going to notice,

00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:24.126 A:middle
everyone always notices
this and brings this up,

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:26.136 A:middle
is that revenue will fluctuate.

00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:28.056 A:middle
This is perfectly natural.

00:13:28.676 --> 00:13:30.256 A:middle
Consumer spending is seasonal.

00:13:31.316 --> 00:13:33.466 A:middle
Advertiser spending
is also seasonal

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.216 A:middle
because consumer
spending is seasonal.

00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:37.986 A:middle
You need to be aware of
this and watch for it.

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.526 A:middle
You can also take
advantage of this.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.806 A:middle
Market your app accordingly.

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:47.106 A:middle
Start of summer, back to
school, holiday season;

00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:49.356 A:middle
these are the times
when users are going

00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:52.586 A:middle
out to get new devices, they're
going out to get new apps,

00:13:52.956 --> 00:13:56.396 A:middle
and advertisers are going out to
get eyeballs inside those apps.

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.036 A:middle
So that's when you
want to try and get --

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:05.226 A:middle
try and put all of your money
into pushing your app out there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:05.226 A:middle
try and put all of your money
into pushing your app out there.

00:14:05.426 --> 00:14:07.226 A:middle
Okay. We've talked about ads.

00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:08.426 A:middle
We've talked about impressions.

00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:09.766 A:middle
We've talked about
tap-through's.

00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:11.186 A:middle
We've talked about fill-rate.

00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:13.526 A:middle
This is a virtuous cycle.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.326 A:middle
Okay? You're going to
get ads to begin with.

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.606 A:middle
They're going to
lead to impressions.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.376 A:middle
Impressions are going to
lead to tap-through's.

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:21.706 A:middle
The more tap-through's you get,
the more ads you're going to get

00:14:21.706 --> 00:14:24.366 A:middle
from the ad server, the more
impressions you're going

00:14:26.776 --> 00:14:27.526 A:middle
to get Okay.

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:29.126 A:middle
So that's performance.

00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:31.526 A:middle
Now that we've done that, now we
can go into some actual details

00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:34.446 A:middle
about how you actually go about
integrating all of this stuff,

00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:35.646 A:middle
sort of the meat of this talk.

00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:39.016 A:middle
There's 4 ad formats.

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:41.386 A:middle
There's banner, there's
interstitial,

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:44.216 A:middle
there's medium rect,
and a pre-roll video ad.

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:46.366 A:middle
We'll talk about each
of these four in turn.

00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:49.276 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier,
you're going to want

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:51.816 A:middle
to choose the correct
ad for your app

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:53.456 A:middle
in the various contexts
within your app.

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:55.696 A:middle
So all four of these types

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:59.266 A:middle
of ads are important
for many, many apps.

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:02.706 A:middle
We'll start off with banner.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:02.706 A:middle
We'll start off with banner.

00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:05.676 A:middle
Okay? So what is a banner?

00:15:06.076 --> 00:15:08.576 A:middle
It's a slim device width view.

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:11.696 A:middle
It's placed at the
bottom of your content.

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:15.196 A:middle
It continuously loads ads.

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:19.716 A:middle
You may have used other iAd
SDKs or ad SDKs where you've got

00:15:19.716 --> 00:15:20.676 A:middle
to make a specific request.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:21.666 A:middle
This isn't that.

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:22.286 A:middle
You create a view.

00:15:22.286 --> 00:15:24.036 A:middle
It's going to show up at
the bottom of the page

00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:26.636 A:middle
and will continuously
load ads over time

00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:28.326 A:middle
as new ads are downloaded
from the ad server.

00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:31.806 A:middle
There's nothing you have
to do to manage that.

00:15:31.956 --> 00:15:34.246 A:middle
Once the user taps on it, it's
going to go into some sort

00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
of fullscreen ad
experience and supported

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:39.596 A:middle
on both iPhone and iPad.

00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:41.686 A:middle
It has been since
the beginning of iAd.

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:46.626 A:middle
Integrating banners
in your app is

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.236 A:middle
about the simplest
thing that you could do.

00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:49.996 A:middle
There's three steps of this.

00:15:49.996 --> 00:15:51.536 A:middle
You're going to link
the iAd framework.

00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:56.826 A:middle
You're going to import
the iAd header,

00:15:56.826 --> 00:15:58.116 A:middle
which is the first
line that popped there.

00:15:58.116 --> 00:16:00.056 A:middle
And you're going to configure
your view controller,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.116 --> 00:16:00.056 A:middle
And you're going to configure
your view controller,

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:02.626 A:middle
which involves setting the
.canDisplayBannerAds property

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:04.326 A:middle
to yes on your view controller.

00:16:05.316 --> 00:16:05.866 A:middle
That's it.

00:16:06.506 --> 00:16:09.186 A:middle
If you've done that, you've
got a banner inside your app.

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:12.046 A:middle
Okay? So what does
that look like?

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:13.526 A:middle
Okay. Loading an ad.

00:16:14.476 --> 00:16:15.316 A:middle
You've got your view.

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:18.336 A:middle
The moment you set the
.canDisplayBannerAds property

00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:20.466 A:middle
on it, we're going to do
something under the hood

00:16:20.466 --> 00:16:21.526 A:middle
to your view controller.

00:16:21.956 --> 00:16:25.186 A:middle
Your view is going to turn
into original content view.

00:16:25.186 --> 00:16:27.526 A:middle
We're going to move your view
over to original content view

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:29.746 A:middle
and we're going to take a
review on your view controller.

00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:31.616 A:middle
So it's very important
for you to remember

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.756 A:middle
if you're subsequently
attempting to access your view

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:35.786 A:middle
on that view controller.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:39.366 A:middle
We're then going to make a
request up the ad server.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:42.106 A:middle
It's going to come and hopefully
a banner is going to load.

00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:47.116 A:middle
And at that time, we're going
to move the banner onscreen

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:49.216 A:middle
and we're going to resize
your original content view

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.986 A:middle
appropriately and with
the appropriate animation

00:16:51.986 --> 00:16:52.956 A:middle
to move the thing onscreen

00:16:52.956 --> 00:16:57.866 A:middle
so the user can actually
look at it.

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.376 A:middle
Once it's been onscreen
for a while,

00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:01.116 A:middle
hopefully the user is going
to go ahead and tap on it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:01.116 A:middle
hopefully the user is going
to go ahead and tap on it.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:02.356 A:middle
And at that point,

00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:04.576 A:middle
the fullscreen ad
experience is going to pop up.

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:08.616 A:middle
When that happens, there are a
couple of things you need to do.

00:17:08.806 --> 00:17:11.976 A:middle
First of which is to pause
activity in -viewWillDisappear:.

00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:15.036 A:middle
Your app is probably doing
things in the background while

00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:16.246 A:middle
that banner is onscreen.

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.796 A:middle
When the user wants
to engage with the ad,

00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:20.376 A:middle
you want to get out of the way.

00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:22.116 A:middle
If you're playing music.

00:17:22.296 --> 00:17:24.165 A:middle
If you're running
a game simulation.

00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:26.445 A:middle
If you're doing anything else
that's potentially intensive

00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:28.956 A:middle
or distracting, you're
going to pause that activity

00:17:28.956 --> 00:17:31.266 A:middle
in -viewWillDisappear:
so that it gets

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:34.106 A:middle
out of the way of the ad.

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:36.756 A:middle
Eventually, the user will be
done interacting with the ad.

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:37.536 A:middle
They'll dismiss it.

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:38.826 A:middle
You'll get -vidDidAppear:.

00:17:39.366 --> 00:17:40.706 A:middle
Resume all that activity.

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:43.286 A:middle
Once the ad's gone, you want
to start the music up again.

00:17:43.286 --> 00:17:48.476 A:middle
You want to start your
game simulation, et cetera.

00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:51.496 A:middle
Eventually, say the user goes
out of network connectivity

00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:54.266 A:middle
or something, you may not
have an ad available anymore.

00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:58.296 A:middle
When that happens, the banner is
going to be moved off of screen.

00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:03.066 A:middle
The original content view
will resized and that --


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:03.066 A:middle
The original content view
will resized and that --

00:18:03.066 --> 00:18:04.166 A:middle
and you can, you know,

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.756 A:middle
wait until it hopefully
reloads again.

00:18:06.936 --> 00:18:09.416 A:middle
In addition to waiting for
the network connectivity

00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:11.826 A:middle
to just move the banner
back off of screen,

00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:13.976 A:middle
you can control the banner
visibility whenever you

00:18:13.976 --> 00:18:14.446 A:middle
would like.

00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:17.286 A:middle
If something happens within
your app that you would

00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:19.226 A:middle
like to move the banner
offscreen temporarily,

00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:20.316 A:middle
you can go ahead and so.

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:23.246 A:middle
Just go ahead and set
.canDisplayBannerAds to no.

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:26.366 A:middle
Just don't forget to
set it back to yes

00:18:26.446 --> 00:18:27.626 A:middle
when you want to re-enable it.

00:18:27.986 --> 00:18:30.676 A:middle
Make sure you put the ad back
onscreen whenever you actually

00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:33.076 A:middle
need to.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:34.606 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners.

00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:37.326 A:middle
Let's talk about interstitials
next, which is the sort

00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:39.836 A:middle
of second major type of
banner -- type of ad here.

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:41.956 A:middle
Very different than banners.

00:18:42.366 --> 00:18:44.436 A:middle
Rather than something
being permanently onscreen,

00:18:44.886 --> 00:18:46.866 A:middle
they're immediate
fullscreen display.

00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:49.096 A:middle
They immediately take
over the entire screen

00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:50.036 A:middle
when you want to present them.

00:18:50.036 --> 00:18:52.646 A:middle
The user is immediately
able to interact with them.

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:58.256 A:middle
Okay? They've been on iPad since
iOS 4.3 and they were introduced

00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:00.556 A:middle
on the phone in iOS 7 last year.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:00.556 A:middle
on the phone in iOS 7 last year.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:05.836 A:middle
There's two major ways to handle
interstitial presentation.

00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:07.566 A:middle
The first is automatic
presentation.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.416 A:middle
Just like banners, it's pretty
simple to configure here.

00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.766 A:middle
Rather than setting
.canDisplayBannerAds,

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:15.456 A:middle
you're going to set
.interstitialPresentationPolicy

00:19:15.736 --> 00:19:18.556 A:middle
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyAutomatic.

00:19:19.066 --> 00:19:21.286 A:middle
What that does is tell
the iAd framework, hey,

00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:25.946 A:middle
this is a great view controller
to show ads on and whenever you,

00:19:25.946 --> 00:19:28.026 A:middle
as the iAd framework,
think is a great time

00:19:28.026 --> 00:19:29.916 A:middle
to show ads, go ahead and do so.

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:33.236 A:middle
At the moment, that means
that we're going to show ads

00:19:33.596 --> 00:19:37.296 A:middle
when this view controller first
moves onscreen, when it appears.

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.786 A:middle
I'm going to take
that as an opportunity

00:19:38.786 --> 00:19:41.426 A:middle
to show an interstitial
ad if one is available.

00:19:42.236 --> 00:19:44.336 A:middle
So to do that, just take
your view controller,

00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:45.706 A:middle
push it onscreen, make it --

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.206 A:middle
push it into your
navigation stack,

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:48.696 A:middle
or however you want
to put it onscreen.

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:52.776 A:middle
That moves in and we're going
to pop an ad up over top of it.

00:19:53.086 --> 00:19:54.496 A:middle
When the user is
done interacting

00:19:54.496 --> 00:19:57.776 A:middle
with it, it'll come back off.

00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:59.716 A:middle
In addition to automatic
presentation,

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:01.236 A:middle
there's manual presentation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:01.236 A:middle
there's manual presentation.

00:20:01.236 --> 00:20:02.936 A:middle
Just set the presentation policy

00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:05.286 A:middle
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyManual

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:08.436 A:middle
and instead of us automatically
presenting it whenever the view

00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:10.396 A:middle
moves onscreen, you can call --

00:20:10.396 --> 00:20:12.976 A:middle
request interstitial ad
presentation to attempt

00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:15.096 A:middle
to display it whenever you
think it's an appropriate time

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
for an ad to pop up over
top of your content.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.446 A:middle
Next, preparing for
presentation.

00:20:25.446 --> 00:20:28.966 A:middle
Because interstitials don't
have something onscreen,

00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:31.046 A:middle
something sitting
there requesting ads,

00:20:31.046 --> 00:20:32.786 A:middle
attempting to display
things at all times,

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:35.506 A:middle
you want to notify the iAd
framework that you would

00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
like to present interstitials
in the future so we can go ahead

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:41.726 A:middle
and make an ad request and
have an interstitial waiting

00:20:41.726 --> 00:20:43.846 A:middle
for you when that time comes.

00:20:44.296 --> 00:20:46.496 A:middle
To do that, you're going to want

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:51.776 A:middle
to call UIViewController
prepareIntersteritalAds inside

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.296 A:middle
something early in
your app's life cycle.

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:55.776 A:middle
Application did finish launching

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:57.606 A:middle
with options is a
good opportunity here.

00:20:57.606 --> 00:20:59.456 A:middle
If you're doing a lot of
other work at that point,

00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:00.506 A:middle
maybe defer it a little bit.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:00.506 A:middle
maybe defer it a little bit.

00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:03.496 A:middle
But you want to call this
prior to your attempt

00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:05.926 A:middle
to present an interstitial
for the first time.

00:21:06.336 --> 00:21:08.966 A:middle
That gives the iAd
framework enough time to go

00:21:08.966 --> 00:21:12.056 A:middle
out to the network, request an
ad, and have everything ready

00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:14.846 A:middle
to present by the time you
want one to be presented.

00:21:14.846 --> 00:21:17.786 A:middle
That will prevent you from
missing ad opportunities.

00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:21.456 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners
and interstitials.

00:21:21.586 --> 00:21:24.346 A:middle
We're going to go from
here into a quick demo just

00:21:24.346 --> 00:21:26.506 A:middle
of the APIs I just went over.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:33.076 A:middle
So we'll switch over to
my demo machine here.

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:36.606 A:middle
What I'm going to start off
with here, I'll just draw

00:21:36.606 --> 00:21:40.976 A:middle
up my little app, is a very
simple master detail app here.

00:21:40.976 --> 00:21:43.396 A:middle
Just some news articles.

00:21:43.396 --> 00:21:45.776 A:middle
I can click on one of these
news articles and bring it up.

00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:49.646 A:middle
And what we'd like to do is
take this app and ad some ads

00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:51.106 A:middle
to it, monetize it with iAd.

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:54.126 A:middle
So if I can quit the
simulator again here.

00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:56.026 A:middle
What do we want to
do here first?

00:21:56.346 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
The first thing we're going to
do is ad a banner to the bottom


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.346 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
The first thing we're going to
do is ad a banner to the bottom

00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:03.136 A:middle
of the MasterViewController,
the bottom of that article list.

00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:05.346 A:middle
So inside our
MasterViewController here,

00:22:05.906 --> 00:22:09.046 A:middle
we're going to import
the iAd header.

00:22:09.886 --> 00:22:10.866 A:middle
Do that like this.

00:22:10.866 --> 00:22:14.346 A:middle
And then, inside, akakeFrom Nib,
all we're going to do is call --

00:22:14.346 --> 00:22:18.026 A:middle
set .canDisplayBannerAds to yes,

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:20.516 A:middle
and that's really
all we have to do.

00:22:21.036 --> 00:22:22.436 A:middle
Oh, one more thing.

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:26.806 A:middle
We need to go in here,
development phases,

00:22:26.806 --> 00:22:29.426 A:middle
and ensure that we link
against the iAd framework.

00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:36.036 A:middle
Make sure the APIs are actually
available to us so we go back

00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:38.096 A:middle
to MasterViewController here.

00:22:38.576 --> 00:22:39.406 A:middle
Go ahead and run.

00:22:45.066 --> 00:22:48.916 A:middle
And we'll see that with two
lines of code and one link,

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.766 A:middle
we have banners at the
bottom of our screen

00:22:51.176 --> 00:22:54.496 A:middle
that are automatically in
line with our view controller.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:58.586 A:middle
Now, we only set that on
the MasterViewController.

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.216 A:middle
That means that when we go into
an article, there's no ad there,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.216 A:middle
That means that when we go into
an article, there's no ad there,

00:23:01.216 --> 00:23:02.486 A:middle
which is a little
bit unfortunate.

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:05.346 A:middle
So the next thing we want
to do is take advantage

00:23:05.346 --> 00:23:08.316 A:middle
of the other type of ad that
we talked about, interstitials,

00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:11.366 A:middle
to present ad to the user prior

00:23:11.366 --> 00:23:13.346 A:middle
to them actually being
able to read the article.

00:23:13.386 --> 00:23:16.526 A:middle
So once they've tapped
on the article title,

00:23:16.846 --> 00:23:18.716 A:middle
we want to add the
popup over the top

00:23:18.716 --> 00:23:20.706 A:middle
of the screen before they
can actually see the article.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:24.236 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and quit this again.

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:29.826 A:middle
And this time, we're
going to, down here,

00:23:30.306 --> 00:23:32.816 A:middle
inside our prepareForSegue
function, we're just going

00:23:32.816 --> 00:23:34.986 A:middle
to set up the
DetailViewController

00:23:34.986 --> 00:23:36.836 A:middle
that shows the actual article.

00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:41.626 A:middle
We're going to grab this
destination.interstitial

00:23:41.626 --> 00:23:43.966 A:middle
PresentationPolicy
AD.interstitial

00:23:43.966 --> 00:23:46.596 A:middle
PresentationPolicy
Automatic so that we can say

00:23:46.596 --> 00:23:48.046 A:middle
that on this
DetailViewController,

00:23:48.046 --> 00:23:49.266 A:middle
the thing that's
showing the article,

00:23:49.656 --> 00:23:53.056 A:middle
we want the iAD framework
to manager presentation

00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:56.066 A:middle
of interstitial ads over
top of this view controller.

00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:00.596 A:middle
Once we've done that, that's
going to get interstitials shown


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:00.596 A:middle
Once we've done that, that's
going to get interstitials shown

00:24:00.596 --> 00:24:01.476 A:middle
over that view controller.

00:24:01.476 --> 00:24:04.576 A:middle
However, we want to make sure
that the iAD framework knows

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:05.236 A:middle
to go out and look

00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:07.146 A:middle
for interstitials
before the user taps

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:08.616 A:middle
on an article for
the first time.

00:24:08.966 --> 00:24:11.266 A:middle
So to do that, we're
going to go over here.

00:24:11.266 --> 00:24:13.056 A:middle
We're going to get to
our AppDelegate here

00:24:13.056 --> 00:24:16.416 A:middle
and we're just going to
grab UIViewController

00:24:16.936 --> 00:24:18.556 A:middle
prepareInterstitialAds.

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:22.196 A:middle
Make sure we import
the header as well.

00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:25.456 A:middle
That tells iAd, hey, go
prepare interstitial ads

00:24:25.456 --> 00:24:26.936 A:middle
so they're ready
for our user here.

00:24:26.936 --> 00:24:28.406 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and save this.

00:24:29.626 --> 00:24:31.936 A:middle
Run our demo again.

00:24:33.566 --> 00:24:36.016 A:middle
Once again, we've got
the article view here.

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.186 A:middle
We've got a banner loaded
at the bottom that happened.

00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:43.566 A:middle
Now, once the user taps on this,
the interstitial ad is going

00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:45.146 A:middle
to pop up over top
of the article.

00:24:45.306 --> 00:24:47.196 A:middle
Once the appropriate
time is expired,

00:24:47.196 --> 00:24:49.716 A:middle
the user is done interacting
with this, they can go ahead

00:24:49.716 --> 00:24:52.516 A:middle
and close that and the article
is behind and they can go ahead

00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:54.206 A:middle
and start reading their article.

00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:58.786 A:middle
So that's basically how easy
it is to integrate banners

00:24:58.786 --> 00:25:01.766 A:middle
and interstitials to your app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.786 --> 00:25:01.766 A:middle
and interstitials to your app.

00:25:02.916 --> 00:25:04.116 A:middle
So we'll go back to the slides.

00:25:04.116 --> 00:25:08.906 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners
and interstitials,

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:12.716 A:middle
which are the first two
major types of ads for iAd.

00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:15.576 A:middle
They were also the first two
types of ads that iAd had.

00:25:15.576 --> 00:25:17.276 A:middle
Those were the ones that were
sort of available pretty much

00:25:17.276 --> 00:25:18.396 A:middle
from the beginning of iAd.

00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:20.646 A:middle
There are a couple of
newer types that we've got.

00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:22.166 A:middle
The first new type, it's --

00:25:22.686 --> 00:25:23.706 A:middle
talking about banners

00:25:24.126 --> 00:25:25.926 A:middle
and interstitial a
little bit more, sorry.

00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:31.916 A:middle
First of all, use
.canDisplayBannerAds

00:25:32.026 --> 00:25:34.006 A:middle
and
.interstitialPresentationPolicy

00:25:34.086 --> 00:25:36.166 A:middle
on your controllers
as much as possible.

00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:39.096 A:middle
We talked about ad engagement.

00:25:39.096 --> 00:25:42.326 A:middle
We talked about the user having
the opportunity to see the ads,

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:45.556 A:middle
leaving them onscreen, the
user having the opportunity

00:25:45.556 --> 00:25:46.576 A:middle
to engage with the ads.

00:25:47.016 --> 00:25:51.846 A:middle
Setting these properties
is a big part of that.

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
In addition, remember to
use .originalContentView

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:56.306 A:middle
when you actually use
canDisplayBannerAds.

00:25:56.646 --> 00:25:59.706 A:middle
It's very important that once
you set canDisplayBannerAds,

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:02.376 A:middle
you realize that you have
given over control of view


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:02.376 A:middle
you realize that you have
given over control of view

00:26:02.376 --> 00:26:03.946 A:middle
to the iAd framework

00:26:04.426 --> 00:26:07.676 A:middle
and .originalContentView
is yours to continue using.

00:26:12.076 --> 00:26:14.206 A:middle
Pick the right transitions
for interstitials.

00:26:14.556 --> 00:26:17.426 A:middle
Think about what your user
is doing at any given time

00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:18.176 A:middle
when they're transitioning

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:19.596 A:middle
from view controller
to view controller.

00:26:19.986 --> 00:26:20.546 A:middle
And make sure

00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:23.506 A:middle
that .interstitialPresentation
PolicyAutomatic is set

00:26:23.736 --> 00:26:26.376 A:middle
on the appropriate view
controllers for an ad to show

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:28.086 A:middle
up when they first pop up.

00:26:28.136 --> 00:26:31.436 A:middle
For instance, in the news
demo that we just showed you,

00:26:32.656 --> 00:26:36.196 A:middle
having that show up on the
main article list is probably

00:26:36.196 --> 00:26:37.106 A:middle
not appropriate.

00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:39.046 A:middle
That would just be distracting
and annoying to users.

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:42.536 A:middle
Having it on the article view
controller, on the other hand,

00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.776 A:middle
just gives a gating
function to allowing the user

00:26:45.776 --> 00:26:47.766 A:middle
to actually use your content.

00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:49.946 A:middle
That's sort of the appropriate
use for the interstitial.

00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:55.046 A:middle
Be consistent throughout
your navigation stack

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:55.896 A:middle
in your use of these.

00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:59.816 A:middle
This is particularly important
for navigation controllers,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:02.106 A:middle
in particular deep
navigation controllers.

00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:05.576 A:middle
What I mean by this
is, in particular

00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:07.126 A:middle
with .canDisplayBannerAds,

00:27:07.696 --> 00:27:10.306 A:middle
if you have a deep navigation
hierarchy, you want to attempt

00:27:10.306 --> 00:27:13.256 A:middle
to set .canDisplayBannerAds on
as many of the view controllers

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:16.016 A:middle
that you're going to be pushing
into that hierarchy as possible

00:27:16.496 --> 00:27:18.806 A:middle
to ensure that the
ad remains onscreen

00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:21.566 A:middle
as the user navigates
throughout that hierarchy.

00:27:22.256 --> 00:27:24.426 A:middle
Otherwise, you have the
possibility of the ad popping

00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:25.956 A:middle
up onscreen for a second.

00:27:25.956 --> 00:27:28.776 A:middle
The user taps on something,
the ad goes back away.

00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:31.656 A:middle
They tapped to something
else, maybe the ad comes back.

00:27:32.036 --> 00:27:33.516 A:middle
That's distracting to your.

00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:35.706 A:middle
At the same time, it
doesn't allow the ad

00:27:35.706 --> 00:27:38.916 A:middle
to stay onscreen long
enough for the user

00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:43.506 A:middle
to actually engage with that ad.

00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:46.586 A:middle
Okay. So now, we're done talking
with banners and interstitials.

00:27:46.796 --> 00:27:49.576 A:middle
Let's talk about medium rect,
which is then next major type

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:52.106 A:middle
of ad that iAd provides to you.

00:27:52.106 --> 00:27:54.346 A:middle
What is a medium rect?

00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:58.056 A:middle
It is an International
Advertising Bureau medium

00:27:58.056 --> 00:27:59.896 A:middle
rectangle; it's a
standard ad type.

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:02.146 A:middle
It's positioned inline
with your content.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:02.146 A:middle
It's positioned inline
with your content.

00:28:02.956 --> 00:28:06.166 A:middle
It's a standardized size;
this is the same size

00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:08.026 A:middle
that you may have seen when
you're browsing the web.

00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:08.976 A:middle
You see this sort of square

00:28:08.976 --> 00:28:12.416 A:middle
or rectangular ads positioned
inline with the web content.

00:28:12.416 --> 00:28:14.136 A:middle
This is the same type
of ad that we've got.

00:28:14.196 --> 00:28:18.216 A:middle
Just like banners, they
automatically cycle over time.

00:28:18.856 --> 00:28:21.616 A:middle
So you put them onscreen,
new ads will be loaded

00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:23.456 A:middle
out of the iAd framework,
feels appropriate,

00:28:23.456 --> 00:28:25.306 A:middle
and will automatically
manage making a request

00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:26.526 A:middle
and putting ads in here for you.

00:28:26.526 --> 00:28:31.876 A:middle
And just like banners, there's
a fullscreen ad experience once

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.846 A:middle
the user taps on and
engages with this banner.

00:28:35.656 --> 00:28:41.466 A:middle
They were introduced in iOS 6
on iPads and happy to announce

00:28:41.546 --> 00:28:44.226 A:middle
that in iOS 8, we're adding
this to phone as well.

00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:51.066 A:middle
Okay. So what's the medium
rectangle lifecycle look like?

00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:56.466 A:middle
Because these banners are not
managed by the iAd framework,

00:28:56.466 --> 00:29:00.536 A:middle
you have to do a little bit
more work to put these onscreen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:56.466 --> 00:29:00.536 A:middle
you have to do a little bit
more work to put these onscreen.

00:29:00.996 --> 00:29:04.316 A:middle
Okay? You need to create
the banner explicitly rather

00:29:04.316 --> 00:29:06.176 A:middle
than just setting a property
on your view controller.

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:09.036 A:middle
You need to configure a
delegate, which is going

00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:10.826 A:middle
to allow us to tell you
when certain things happen

00:29:10.826 --> 00:29:12.766 A:middle
and we're going to get into the
code for this in the next slide.

00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:16.836 A:middle
Implement the delegate protocol
so you can actually take notice

00:29:16.836 --> 00:29:18.816 A:middle
of these events and move
the thing on and offscreen

00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:20.896 A:middle
as the banner loads and unloads.

00:29:21.066 --> 00:29:24.176 A:middle
You're going to show the banner

00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:26.016 A:middle
when you receive the
-bannerViewDidLoadAd:

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.836 A:middle
property -- or delegate
callback.

00:29:29.136 --> 00:29:30.556 A:middle
You're going to pause activity

00:29:30.556 --> 00:29:33.096 A:middle
in -bannerViewAction ShouldBegin
:willLeaveApplication:.

00:29:33.096 --> 00:29:36.746 A:middle
This is analogous to getting
the view will disappear message

00:29:36.856 --> 00:29:39.506 A:middle
from interstitials or banners.

00:29:39.956 --> 00:29:43.206 A:middle
And you want to resume activity
in -bannerViewActionDidFinish:,

00:29:43.266 --> 00:29:44.426 A:middle
analogous to view will appear.

00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:47.946 A:middle
You're going to hide the
banner in -bannerView:

00:29:47.946 --> 00:29:49.356 A:middle
didFailTo ReceiveAdWithError:.

00:29:49.356 --> 00:29:50.136 A:middle
This is important.

00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:53.446 A:middle
This indicates that your banner
no longer has an add loaded

00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:55.586 A:middle
and it should no longer be
taking up space onscreen.

00:29:55.586 --> 00:29:58.276 A:middle
So what does this look like?

00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:00.606 A:middle
First of all, creating a banner.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:00.606 A:middle
First of all, creating a banner.

00:30:01.456 --> 00:30:03.276 A:middle
You're going to import
the iAd header at the top.

00:30:03.406 --> 00:30:06.506 A:middle
You're going to implement
ADBanner ViewDelegate

00:30:06.506 --> 00:30:08.016 A:middle
on whatever object you would

00:30:08.016 --> 00:30:10.416 A:middle
like to actually be managing
this particular banner.

00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:13.336 A:middle
Then you're going to
create the banner view.

00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:15.456 A:middle
You can do that with
initWith AdType:

00:30:15.456 --> 00:30:18.826 A:middle
ADAdType MediumRectangle,
and then you're going

00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:19.576 A:middle
to set the delegate

00:30:19.636 --> 00:30:20.936 A:middle
to the object that's
implementing the

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:21.766 A:middle
delegate protocol.

00:30:22.376 --> 00:30:24.236 A:middle
So what does that delegate
protocol look like?

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:28.346 A:middle
Well, first how does a medium
rect actually load and unload?

00:30:28.346 --> 00:30:29.466 A:middle
It's going to start
out unloaded.

00:30:29.466 --> 00:30:30.936 A:middle
When you first create it
there's nothing in there.

00:30:30.936 --> 00:30:32.016 A:middle
We haven't made an ad request.

00:30:32.016 --> 00:30:33.316 A:middle
There's nothing to
put onscreen yet.

00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:35.786 A:middle
So don't put it onscreen
when you first create it.

00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
It's just going to
be a blank slide,

00:30:36.976 --> 00:30:40.436 A:middle
and we're going to
send you an error.

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:42.566 A:middle
Once you get a
bannerViewDidLoadAd that's your

00:30:42.566 --> 00:30:45.656 A:middle
cue that there is an ad
available inside your medium

00:30:45.656 --> 00:30:47.296 A:middle
rect, and you should
move it onscreen.

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:50.046 A:middle
You're going to leave
the banner onscreen

00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:51.176 A:middle
as long as it has an ad.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.816 A:middle
Remember, too, that this is
something that's supposed

00:30:53.816 --> 00:30:55.936 A:middle
to be positioned in-line
with your content.

00:30:55.986 --> 00:30:58.566 A:middle
When you move it onscreen, when
you leave it onscreen make sure

00:30:58.566 --> 00:31:00.666 A:middle
that it's within the
rest of your content.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.566 --> 00:31:00.666 A:middle
that it's within the
rest of your content.

00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:03.656 A:middle
If you have an article and you
put the medium rect onscreen

00:31:03.656 --> 00:31:05.446 A:middle
with the article text
should flow around it.

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:07.196 A:middle
It should be inside a
scroll view and scroll

00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:09.136 A:middle
with the rest of your content.

00:31:09.356 --> 00:31:12.536 A:middle
That's what this type
of ad is intended for.

00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:16.906 A:middle
You're going to move the
banner back offscreen

00:31:16.906 --> 00:31:19.036 A:middle
in bannerView:did
FailToReceive AdWithError.

00:31:19.156 --> 00:31:21.076 A:middle
Again, once you move
it offscreen it's your

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:24.786 A:middle
responsibility to reflow
your content to fill the hole

00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:28.856 A:middle
that was just left by the ad.

00:31:28.856 --> 00:31:30.376 A:middle
At that time it's going
to move offscreen.

00:31:30.486 --> 00:31:31.646 A:middle
You reflow up your content.

00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:35.956 A:middle
This is what banner loading and
unloading is going to look like.

00:31:35.956 --> 00:31:37.316 A:middle
You're going -- there's
two important delegate

00:31:37.316 --> 00:31:37.956 A:middle
callbacks here.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:40.686 A:middle
BannerView DidLoadAd in
which case you're just going

00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:43.936 A:middle
to put the banner onscreen,
re-handle all of your layout.

00:31:44.226 --> 00:31:46.376 A:middle
And bannerViewDidFail
ToReceiveAd WithError you're

00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:48.196 A:middle
going to remove it
from the super view.

00:31:48.256 --> 00:31:49.316 A:middle
You're going to do the converse.

00:31:49.316 --> 00:31:51.736 A:middle
You're going to, again,
layout, reflowing your content

00:31:51.736 --> 00:31:53.596 A:middle
around the hole that was
left by the banner view.

00:31:55.836 --> 00:31:57.796 A:middle
So some best practices
for medium rectangle.

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:00.676 A:middle
Again, this is great
for reflowable content.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:00.676 A:middle
Again, this is great
for reflowable content.

00:32:00.676 --> 00:32:02.266 A:middle
This is the sort of
thing that you're going

00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:05.776 A:middle
to put inside a scroll view
within the rest of your content

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:08.416 A:middle
that may scroll up and
down along the device,

00:32:08.566 --> 00:32:09.796 A:middle
may go on- and offscreen.

00:32:10.186 --> 00:32:13.136 A:middle
It's sort of static with
the rest of your content,

00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:15.436 A:middle
flows around it, fills a hole

00:32:15.436 --> 00:32:17.736 A:middle
with inside the space
on the screen.

00:32:19.796 --> 00:32:22.446 A:middle
It's got a fullscreen ad
on tap, remember that.

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:26.956 A:middle
Pay attention to the delegate
callbacks for willBeginAction,

00:32:27.246 --> 00:32:30.086 A:middle
didFinishAction so that you
can pause and resume activity.

00:32:31.966 --> 00:32:33.956 A:middle
Pause it in bannerViewActions
ShouldBegin.

00:32:35.416 --> 00:32:38.126 A:middle
And resume activity in
bannerView ActionDidFinish.

00:32:39.176 --> 00:32:40.476 A:middle
So that's medium rectangle.

00:32:40.476 --> 00:32:43.136 A:middle
A little bit more complicated
than the banner because you have

00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:44.466 A:middle
to manage positioning yourself,

00:32:44.466 --> 00:32:46.436 A:middle
but still fairly
simple to implement.

00:32:48.146 --> 00:32:51.466 A:middle
Okay, the fourth type of
ad that we're going to talk

00:32:51.466 --> 00:32:52.966 A:middle
about here is the pre-roll.

00:32:53.466 --> 00:32:56.396 A:middle
What is a pre-roll?

00:32:56.646 --> 00:33:00.326 A:middle
The video pre-roll is a short
video that plays between --


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:56.646 --> 00:33:00.326 A:middle
The video pre-roll is a short
video that plays between --

00:33:00.326 --> 00:33:02.646 A:middle
before your own media content.

00:33:03.116 --> 00:33:08.886 A:middle
It's fullscreen ad on tap just
like the other banner types.

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:10.546 A:middle
It was added in iOS 7.

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:15.566 A:middle
And in iOS 7 we added it
on MPMoviePlayerController.

00:33:15.996 --> 00:33:18.056 A:middle
And new in iOS 8
we're also adding it

00:33:18.056 --> 00:33:20.966 A:middle
on AVPlayer ViewController,
new AV kit APIs

00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:22.406 A:middle
that are introduced
here at WWDC.

00:33:23.456 --> 00:33:27.206 A:middle
This is available on both
iPhone and iPad, and has been

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:28.916 A:middle
since the initial introduction.

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:32.826 A:middle
I want to sort of circle back
to the very first bullet here,

00:33:32.826 --> 00:33:34.306 A:middle
the short video plays
before content.

00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:35.706 A:middle
This is really important.

00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:38.256 A:middle
This is not an
interstitial-style ad.

00:33:38.546 --> 00:33:41.036 A:middle
This is something to be
played before your content,

00:33:41.076 --> 00:33:41.976 A:middle
so you need to make sure

00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:44.606 A:middle
that you actually have a
video to play after it.

00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:47.916 A:middle
We don't want -- it's not
supported for you to attempt

00:33:47.916 --> 00:33:50.946 A:middle
to use this just to play a
random ad at a random time.

00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:52.986 A:middle
Make sure that you have
content to follow it,

00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:55.286 A:middle
that's what the API
is designed for.

00:33:57.496 --> 00:34:00.626 A:middle
So setting up and playback,
also fairly straightforward.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.496 --> 00:34:00.626 A:middle
So setting up and playback,
also fairly straightforward.

00:34:00.626 --> 00:34:01.476 A:middle
You're going to start off

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:03.636 A:middle
by linking the MediaPlayer
and iAd frameworks.

00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:05.856 A:middle
You're going to Import
Media and iAd headers.

00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:06.986 A:middle
You're going to create a player.

00:34:07.056 --> 00:34:09.406 A:middle
You're going to tell it to
play the pre-roll video,

00:34:09.406 --> 00:34:10.946 A:middle
and then you'll play
your content video.

00:34:11.366 --> 00:34:12.216 A:middle
Very straightforward.

00:34:12.496 --> 00:34:14.966 A:middle
Basically almost all
those except the iAd vids

00:34:14.966 --> 00:34:17.186 A:middle
and the play pre-roll
you already have to do

00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:18.536 A:middle
if you've got your own content.

00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:21.016 A:middle
This is just a few
tiny additional lines.

00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:22.846 A:middle
So what does that look like?

00:34:23.065 --> 00:34:25.686 A:middle
First Import MediaPlayer
and Import iAd.

00:34:26.146 --> 00:34:29.656 A:middle
You're going to create your
MPMoviePlayerController.

00:34:29.846 --> 00:34:30.076 A:middle
You're going

00:34:30.076 --> 00:34:31.985 A:middle
to initWithContentURL
as you already would.

00:34:31.985 --> 00:34:34.025 A:middle
You're going to add
that MoviePlayer

00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:36.396 A:middle
into your view hierarchy
so that it's onscreen.

00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:38.746 A:middle
Call layouts, you
redo your layout

00:34:38.746 --> 00:34:39.755 A:middle
for it once it's there as well.

00:34:40.226 --> 00:34:43.146 A:middle
And then you're going
to call playPrerollAd

00:34:43.146 --> 00:34:44.306 A:middle
WithCompletion Handler.

00:34:44.306 --> 00:34:45.576 A:middle
You're going to call
this instead

00:34:45.576 --> 00:34:47.056 A:middle
of immediately calling Play.

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:50.696 A:middle
This tells iAd, "Hey, try
to put a pre-roll video

00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:51.735 A:middle
in there if you've got one.

00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:53.376 A:middle
Play that first."

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:55.636 A:middle
This takes a completion handler.

00:34:55.636 --> 00:34:57.036 A:middle
It's going to return
an error possibly

00:34:57.036 --> 00:34:57.926 A:middle
if something went wrong.

00:34:58.616 --> 00:35:01.986 A:middle
Inside the completion handler is
your cue to start your content.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.616 --> 00:35:01.986 A:middle
Inside the completion handler is
your cue to start your content.

00:35:02.356 --> 00:35:05.026 A:middle
You want to make sure you don't
automatically play your content.

00:35:05.026 --> 00:35:06.216 A:middle
You want to pause your content

00:35:06.216 --> 00:35:08.256 A:middle
until this actually
begins playing,

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:11.126 A:middle
or until the pre-roll
finishes playing and you want

00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:14.306 A:middle
to begin your own content then.

00:35:14.306 --> 00:35:15.886 A:middle
For an AVKit it's
almost identical.

00:35:15.926 --> 00:35:18.236 A:middle
You're going to create an
AVPlayerViewController instead.

00:35:18.236 --> 00:35:19.846 A:middle
You're going to Import
the AVKit headers.

00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:22.156 A:middle
And you're going to call, again,

00:35:22.156 --> 00:35:23.696 A:middle
playPrerollAd
WithCompletionHandler.

00:35:23.696 --> 00:35:25.056 A:middle
It has identical semantics

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:26.986 A:middle
to the MPMediaPlayerController
ones.

00:35:27.456 --> 00:35:30.266 A:middle
Inside the completion handler
you're going to call player play

00:35:30.266 --> 00:35:33.056 A:middle
to start your own video
content afterward.

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:34.766 A:middle
This is new in iOS 8.

00:35:37.416 --> 00:35:40.536 A:middle
Just like interstitials, because
this is something that is going

00:35:40.536 --> 00:35:43.626 A:middle
to happen at some point and
you want to have iAd prepare it

00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:46.056 A:middle
for it you need to tell
the iAd framework, "Hey,

00:35:46.056 --> 00:35:48.586 A:middle
I'm going to want to play
pre-rolls in the future."

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.896 A:middle
That allows us to have
the opportunity to go

00:35:50.896 --> 00:35:54.656 A:middle
out to the ad server, grab ads,
and be ready for your request

00:35:54.656 --> 00:35:56.586 A:middle
to play pre-rolls so that
we can actually play one

00:35:56.586 --> 00:35:58.886 A:middle
when the user does
something that requires it.

00:35:59.506 --> 00:36:01.766 A:middle
To do that, just like
interstitials you don't want


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.506 --> 00:36:01.766 A:middle
To do that, just like
interstitials you don't want

00:36:01.766 --> 00:36:04.006 A:middle
to miss these early impressions,
so you're going to want

00:36:04.006 --> 00:36:05.346 A:middle
to start ad requests early

00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:07.746 A:middle
by calling
MPMoviePlayerController

00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:09.146 A:middle
preparePrerollAds.

00:36:09.406 --> 00:36:11.626 A:middle
Again, probably an
application did finish launching

00:36:11.626 --> 00:36:15.896 A:middle
with options or some other early
in your app's lifecycle period

00:36:16.106 --> 00:36:18.216 A:middle
so we haven't had an
opportunity to go get ads

00:36:18.216 --> 00:36:20.506 A:middle
for you before you
call the APIs.

00:36:21.136 --> 00:36:23.256 A:middle
If you're using AVKit
it's almost identical,

00:36:23.506 --> 00:36:26.286 A:middle
AVPlayerController
preparePrerollAds instead.

00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:30.656 A:middle
Going with best practices
for video then,

00:36:31.166 --> 00:36:34.886 A:middle
don't play content video
until the ad completes.

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:38.396 A:middle
If you've called playPrerollAd,

00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:42.156 A:middle
and then half a second later you
call Play before we've called

00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:45.296 A:middle
your completion handler
we're going to interrupt it.

00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:49.646 A:middle
You know notification handling
is a very common case for this.

00:36:49.646 --> 00:36:52.246 A:middle
This is going to interrupt
playing of the pre-roll ad.

00:36:52.246 --> 00:36:53.506 A:middle
It's going to immediately skip.

00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:54.646 A:middle
It's going to go
to your content.

00:36:54.766 --> 00:36:56.396 A:middle
And it's like the ad
never played except

00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:58.376 A:middle
that it's a poor user
experience for your user.

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:00.346 A:middle
You'd like to try to
avoid this when possible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:00.346 A:middle
You'd like to try to
avoid this when possible.

00:37:00.636 --> 00:37:02.366 A:middle
So make sure that you wait

00:37:02.366 --> 00:37:04.466 A:middle
until our completion handler
is called to call Play.

00:37:04.466 --> 00:37:07.616 A:middle
For notifications this
frequently means just recording

00:37:07.616 --> 00:37:09.126 A:middle
the fact that your
content is ready.

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:12.896 A:middle
If you're already calling Play
in these notifications instead

00:37:12.966 --> 00:37:16.626 A:middle
of just calling play
record that fact,

00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:18.116 A:middle
and inside the completion
handler check

00:37:18.116 --> 00:37:19.506 A:middle
for that fact, and
then call play.

00:37:20.856 --> 00:37:23.896 A:middle
Similarly defer UI
customization.

00:37:23.896 --> 00:37:26.636 A:middle
Many of you may be doing
UI customization on top

00:37:26.636 --> 00:37:28.846 A:middle
of the MediaPlayer controller
to present custom controls

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.486 A:middle
or present custom UI around it.

00:37:30.786 --> 00:37:32.286 A:middle
Wait to do that until

00:37:32.286 --> 00:37:33.956 A:middle
after we've called your
completion handler.

00:37:33.956 --> 00:37:37.306 A:middle
The pre-roll already has
custom UI, and you don't want

00:37:37.306 --> 00:37:40.586 A:middle
to interfere with that custom
UI with your own customization.

00:37:40.706 --> 00:37:43.496 A:middle
That's, again, going to
provide a very poor experience

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:44.266 A:middle
for your users.

00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:48.286 A:middle
Okay, so now that we've
got that let's go back

00:37:48.286 --> 00:37:49.356 A:middle
to our demo machine here.

00:37:49.356 --> 00:37:52.136 A:middle
I've got a quick demo
setting that up as well.

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:57.656 A:middle
Let's close -- yep -- that.

00:37:57.726 --> 00:38:03.446 A:middle
I can pull up quick little
demo of this as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.726 --> 00:38:03.446 A:middle
I can pull up quick little
demo of this as well.

00:38:05.106 --> 00:38:06.466 A:middle
Can run this.

00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:09.396 A:middle
This is a very simple
little app,

00:38:09.396 --> 00:38:13.636 A:middle
just provides a few quick
little video clips here.

00:38:13.636 --> 00:38:17.066 A:middle
I can click on one of these
and we've got a quick video.

00:38:17.446 --> 00:38:20.116 A:middle
Now what I'd like to do is now
that I've got this video content

00:38:20.116 --> 00:38:21.616 A:middle
that my user would
like to engage with I'd

00:38:21.616 --> 00:38:25.066 A:middle
like to monetize this by
playing a pre-roll ad prior

00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:27.476 A:middle
to the user actually being
able to view my clips.

00:38:27.966 --> 00:38:30.426 A:middle
So let's go ahead and quit
this and see what we have

00:38:30.426 --> 00:38:31.436 A:middle
to do to get that done.

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:35.456 A:middle
We can start off here --
the very first thing we need

00:38:35.456 --> 00:38:38.236 A:middle
to do is, as for interstitials,
we want to make sure

00:38:38.236 --> 00:38:39.016 A:middle
that we tell iAd, "Hey,

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:42.566 A:middle
I'm going to be playing pre-roll
ads, go fetch them early."

00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:44.806 A:middle
We'll start off in
our app delegate here,

00:38:47.056 --> 00:38:53.496 A:middle
and we will Import iAd, and
we'll Import the MediaPlayer

00:38:53.496 --> 00:38:55.776 A:middle
so we have the appropriate
classes for our APIs.

00:38:56.206 --> 00:38:59.656 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and
call preparePrerollAds

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:00.986 A:middle
on MPMoviePlayerController.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:00.986 A:middle
on MPMoviePlayerController.

00:39:01.956 --> 00:39:04.286 A:middle
Once we've done that we
need to actually go ahead

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:06.256 A:middle
and call preparePrerollAds,

00:39:06.256 --> 00:39:08.106 A:middle
so we'll go to our
View Controller here

00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:11.226 A:middle
which is doing the actual
display, and we're going

00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:14.666 A:middle
to scroll down to at the
bottom here collectionView

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:16.736 A:middle
didSelectItemAtIndexPath.

00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:19.296 A:middle
This is what happens when
the user actually taps on it.

00:39:19.596 --> 00:39:22.086 A:middle
At the moment all
we're doing is creating

00:39:22.086 --> 00:39:25.236 A:middle
MPMoviePlayerViewController,
setting the content URL,

00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:26.766 A:middle
and then calling
Present MoviePlayer

00:39:26.766 --> 00:39:28.216 A:middle
to have it start
playing automatically.

00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:30.996 A:middle
We want to sort of
interrupt that briefly,

00:39:30.996 --> 00:39:32.636 A:middle
and instead we're
going to go ahead

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:37.386 A:middle
and call playPrerollAd
WithCompletionHandler.

00:39:37.826 --> 00:39:39.816 A:middle
And again, inside the
completion handler to that,

00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:43.456 A:middle
that's where we're going to call
mpvController .moviePlayer play.

00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:48.766 A:middle
Go back up to the top here, and
ensure that we are importing iAd

00:39:48.766 --> 00:39:52.186 A:middle
as well, so we get the
iAd APIs available.

00:39:52.186 --> 00:39:54.266 A:middle
Go ahead and save that.

00:39:55.436 --> 00:39:56.386 A:middle
We can run again.

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:03.016 A:middle
No. This is what I
knew I was going to do.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:03.016 A:middle
No. This is what I
knew I was going to do.

00:40:03.706 --> 00:40:05.076 A:middle
Once again, we got
to go in here,

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:06.976 A:middle
make sure that the iAd
framework is linked.

00:40:14.046 --> 00:40:15.186 A:middle
Now we can run it.

00:40:16.286 --> 00:40:20.256 A:middle
Okay, and we got our ad up
-- our app up here again,

00:40:20.256 --> 00:40:22.156 A:middle
same quick little videos.

00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:24.506 A:middle
We can go ahead and click
on one of these now.

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:28.766 A:middle
And before the video content
actually plays you see

00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:32.366 A:middle
that we've got an iAd workbench
ad that comes up instead.

00:40:32.366 --> 00:40:36.236 A:middle
The user can view
this ad content.

00:40:36.236 --> 00:40:37.996 A:middle
Once they're done with it
they can decide to go ahead

00:40:37.996 --> 00:40:40.216 A:middle
and skip ahead of it, and
we go immediately back

00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:42.956 A:middle
to the video content
for the app itself.

00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:46.826 A:middle
And that's pretty much
all that's involved

00:40:46.826 --> 00:40:50.996 A:middle
in implementing pre-rolls once
you've already got MediaPlayer

00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:53.436 A:middle
content for that pre-roll
to play in front of.

00:40:54.546 --> 00:40:59.246 A:middle
Okay, so those are the
four different types of ads

00:40:59.246 --> 00:41:01.976 A:middle
that we have for integration
with iAd inside your app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.246 --> 00:41:01.976 A:middle
that we have for integration
with iAd inside your app.

00:41:02.486 --> 00:41:04.716 A:middle
Once you've started using
them let's talk a little bit

00:41:04.716 --> 00:41:05.356 A:middle
about testing.

00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:10.166 A:middle
First of all there are a
couple of things we add --

00:41:10.316 --> 00:41:13.226 A:middle
we've added to the developer
settings on the phone

00:41:13.286 --> 00:41:17.166 A:middle
to help you test the integration
of iAd within your app.

00:41:18.036 --> 00:41:20.246 A:middle
First, you can adjust
the fill rate.

00:41:20.816 --> 00:41:25.216 A:middle
This is inside the apps that you
have when you're testing them

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.896 A:middle
on the device you can adjust
how frequently you're going

00:41:27.896 --> 00:41:28.566 A:middle
to get ads.

00:41:28.566 --> 00:41:30.476 A:middle
This allows you to
test error conditions.

00:41:30.616 --> 00:41:32.836 A:middle
It allows you to test always
working conditions and make sure

00:41:32.836 --> 00:41:35.516 A:middle
that your app handles those
conditions appropriately.

00:41:36.746 --> 00:41:39.776 A:middle
In addition you can adjust
the refresh rate for things

00:41:39.776 --> 00:41:41.406 A:middle
like banners and medium rects.

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:42.876 A:middle
This is going to
adjust the frequency

00:41:42.876 --> 00:41:44.436 A:middle
with which new ads come in.

00:41:45.116 --> 00:41:49.036 A:middle
In addition, in combination with
the fill rate this allows you

00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:50.676 A:middle
to rapidly test error

00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:53.786 A:middle
and non-error conditions moving
things on- and offscreen.

00:41:57.676 --> 00:42:00.226 A:middle
Most importantly there's
a switch called Highlight


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.676 --> 00:42:00.226 A:middle
Most importantly there's
a switch called Highlight

00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:01.016 A:middle
Clipped Banners.

00:42:01.316 --> 00:42:04.996 A:middle
If you're using the
.canDisplayBannerAds this isn't

00:42:04.996 --> 00:42:06.216 A:middle
going to affect banners
very much,

00:42:06.216 --> 00:42:08.366 A:middle
but this is very
important for medium rect.

00:42:09.116 --> 00:42:12.486 A:middle
It's very easy to accident
occlude part of the medium rect

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.376 A:middle
with some other UI element.

00:42:14.426 --> 00:42:17.356 A:middle
If you do that that's a
part of the medium rect

00:42:17.356 --> 00:42:18.796 A:middle
that may not be seen
by your user.

00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:20.516 A:middle
It's a part of the
medium rect that you --

00:42:20.516 --> 00:42:23.156 A:middle
that the user may not be able
to tap on and interact with.

00:42:23.266 --> 00:42:25.336 A:middle
This will detect that.

00:42:25.926 --> 00:42:27.856 A:middle
You turn on the Highlight
Clipped Banners button.

00:42:27.856 --> 00:42:30.246 A:middle
We're going to provide
a green or a red overlay

00:42:30.556 --> 00:42:33.616 A:middle
over your medium rect, or
banners, or instructions

00:42:33.616 --> 00:42:37.006 A:middle
for that matter, that will show
when the user can actually tap

00:42:37.006 --> 00:42:38.406 A:middle
on all parts of this banner

00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:41.176 A:middle
when it is officially
onscreen and visible.

00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:43.136 A:middle
You want to make
sure that any banners

00:42:43.136 --> 00:42:45.426 A:middle
that you show inside your
app are always green.

00:42:45.426 --> 00:42:52.456 A:middle
Remember this only affects your
apps, your developer-mode apps

00:42:52.456 --> 00:42:55.696 A:middle
that you have run from xCode
and deployed onto your device.

00:42:55.696 --> 00:42:57.926 A:middle
So no, you can't just
fill right to zero

00:42:57.926 --> 00:43:00.276 A:middle
for all the other iAd-using
apps on your device.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.926 --> 00:43:00.276 A:middle
for all the other iAd-using
apps on your device.

00:43:00.276 --> 00:43:02.376 A:middle
This only affects
developer-mode apps.

00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:06.656 A:middle
Okay, so that's monetization.

00:43:06.656 --> 00:43:09.006 A:middle
That was sort of the first
major portion of the talk.

00:43:09.006 --> 00:43:11.226 A:middle
Let's talk next a little
bit about promotion.

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:13.946 A:middle
This is the other half
of the iAd ecosystem.

00:43:14.046 --> 00:43:18.986 A:middle
This is how you can use iAd to
drive downloads of your own app.

00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:21.606 A:middle
So there's three major parts

00:43:22.636 --> 00:43:24.856 A:middle
that we're going
to talk about here.

00:43:24.856 --> 00:43:27.716 A:middle
First I'm going to do a really
quick intro to iA Workbench.

00:43:27.716 --> 00:43:29.126 A:middle
There's another session
on that tomorrow

00:43:29.126 --> 00:43:30.156 A:middle
if you get more in detail.

00:43:30.156 --> 00:43:31.396 A:middle
So this is just a
quick overview.

00:43:31.886 --> 00:43:35.426 A:middle
And then there are two new APIs
that we're introducing in iOS 8,

00:43:35.576 --> 00:43:39.486 A:middle
one for app attribution and one
for app audience retargeting.

00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:42.406 A:middle
And we'll talk a little
bit about those new APIs.

00:43:42.406 --> 00:43:44.436 A:middle
Let's start off with
iAd Workbench.

00:43:45.596 --> 00:43:46.616 A:middle
What is iAd Workbench?

00:43:46.856 --> 00:43:48.806 A:middle
iAd Workbench is
iAd's self-servicing

00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:50.246 A:middle
advertising platform.

00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:53.306 A:middle
It's basically a Web
app on the apple.com,

00:43:53.306 --> 00:43:55.046 A:middle
iadworkbench.apple.com.

00:43:55.356 --> 00:43:59.506 A:middle
This is how you can manage
being an advertiser on iAd.

00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:02.136 A:middle
Okay, you can create mobile ads.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:02.136 A:middle
Okay, you can create mobile ads.

00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:03.726 A:middle
You can upload your own banners.

00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:05.196 A:middle
You can use built-in templates.

00:44:05.196 --> 00:44:10.026 A:middle
You can also use iProducer to
create your own iAd assets.

00:44:11.456 --> 00:44:14.526 A:middle
Once you've done that you can
use this to reach the users

00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:17.006 A:middle
who are most likely to
actually download your app.

00:44:17.436 --> 00:44:19.516 A:middle
iAd is an iOS advertising
platform.

00:44:19.516 --> 00:44:22.366 A:middle
You're going to reach a whole
bunch of users who are on iOS

00:44:22.366 --> 00:44:25.826 A:middle
who are already using apps on
iOS and who are, therefore,

00:44:25.826 --> 00:44:29.526 A:middle
highly likely to engage with the
ad that is advertising your app

00:44:29.526 --> 00:44:30.656 A:middle
and download your app.

00:44:30.806 --> 00:44:34.366 A:middle
You can also manage your
campaign performance here.

00:44:34.366 --> 00:44:35.036 A:middle
This is where you're going

00:44:35.036 --> 00:44:37.106 A:middle
to see how many people
have seen your ad,

00:44:37.106 --> 00:44:39.936 A:middle
how the campaign is doing,
tap-through rates, etcetera,

00:44:39.936 --> 00:44:41.836 A:middle
for your particular
advertising campaign.

00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:44.176 A:middle
So that's Workbench.

00:44:44.176 --> 00:44:44.656 A:middle
Again, there's going

00:44:44.656 --> 00:44:46.826 A:middle
to be another session
tomorrow go into more detail.

00:44:47.306 --> 00:44:50.106 A:middle
Next important part to
talk about is some new APIs

00:44:50.106 --> 00:44:52.166 A:middle
that we've got for
app attribution.

00:44:52.686 --> 00:44:54.796 A:middle
Okay, what is app attribution?

00:44:55.646 --> 00:44:58.806 A:middle
App attribution allows you to
track app downloads of your app

00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
that originated from iAd.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
that originated from iAd.

00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:04.186 A:middle
Okay, this is going to let
you measure the effectiveness

00:45:04.186 --> 00:45:06.606 A:middle
of your campaigns that you've
created in iAd Workbench

00:45:06.606 --> 00:45:09.246 A:middle
that you're running to
actually promote your app.

00:45:09.446 --> 00:45:16.106 A:middle
Okay, the APIs were available
in iOS 7 -- or iOS 7.1, rather.

00:45:16.586 --> 00:45:19.216 A:middle
And we've enhanced them a
little bit in iOS 8 as well.

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.736 A:middle
So there's a new one in iOS 8.

00:45:21.426 --> 00:45:23.396 A:middle
So what does the API
actually look like?

00:45:23.396 --> 00:45:24.166 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:45:24.296 --> 00:45:26.676 A:middle
Again, you're going
to Include iAd/iAd.h

00:45:26.676 --> 00:45:28.086 A:middle
as everything starts
with for iAd.

00:45:28.646 --> 00:45:32.316 A:middle
And then you're going to
call ADClient sharedClient.

00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:35.726 A:middle
And on that you're going to
call lookupAdConversionDetails.

00:45:36.026 --> 00:45:40.366 A:middle
Okay, inside that you can use
the two dates that are provided

00:45:40.366 --> 00:45:42.686 A:middle
with completion handler
to determine whether

00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:44.926 A:middle
or not this particular
installation

00:45:44.926 --> 00:45:46.826 A:middle
of the app was due to iAd.

00:45:46.826 --> 00:45:49.526 A:middle
Okay, these dates are going
to give you two things.

00:45:49.896 --> 00:45:52.266 A:middle
The first is the app
purchase date on the date

00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:54.836 A:middle
at which the user actually
made the purchase of this app.

00:45:55.496 --> 00:45:57.916 A:middle
And then the date
of the impression,

00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:01.616 A:middle
the date that the user saw and
interacted with the ad prior


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:01.616 A:middle
the date that the user saw and
interacted with the ad prior

00:46:01.616 --> 00:46:03.276 A:middle
to them purchasing the app.

00:46:03.776 --> 00:46:07.756 A:middle
Okay, if both of these dates
are there and true that's going

00:46:07.756 --> 00:46:09.046 A:middle
to indicate to you that as far

00:46:09.046 --> 00:46:11.876 A:middle
as iAd is concerned
this was a installation

00:46:11.876 --> 00:46:13.556 A:middle
of your app directly
attributable

00:46:13.556 --> 00:46:14.926 A:middle
to the user interacting with

00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:17.536 A:middle
and seeing an iAd
promoting your app.

00:46:22.616 --> 00:46:24.426 A:middle
It's very important to remember
that these dates are going

00:46:24.426 --> 00:46:27.946 A:middle
to be nil if they are
not attributed to iAd.

00:46:28.826 --> 00:46:31.936 A:middle
They'll also be nil if the user
has Limit Ad Tracking enabled.

00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:33.246 A:middle
So regardless of whether

00:46:33.246 --> 00:46:37.026 A:middle
or not this is an iAd-driven
installation the user has Limit

00:46:37.026 --> 00:46:39.626 A:middle
Ad Tracking enabled; they don't
want their ad browsing data

00:46:39.976 --> 00:46:42.816 A:middle
to be tracked or
shown to various apps.

00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:43.836 A:middle
These are going to be nil.

00:46:43.836 --> 00:46:45.646 A:middle
We're not going to give you
this information in those cases.

00:46:45.646 --> 00:46:47.576 A:middle
So you should be aware of that
if you're trying to use this

00:46:47.576 --> 00:46:48.716 A:middle
for any sort of analytics.

00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:52.546 A:middle
In addition you want
to avoid lookups

00:46:52.546 --> 00:46:53.926 A:middle
of this data on every launch.

00:46:53.926 --> 00:46:56.046 A:middle
It's probably very
tempting to add this

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:58.886 A:middle
to appDidFinishLaunching,
lookup your conversion details,

00:46:58.886 --> 00:47:00.456 A:middle
set some state flag,
and do something


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.886 --> 00:47:00.456 A:middle
set some state flag,
and do something

00:47:00.456 --> 00:47:01.806 A:middle
on every single launch
on the app.

00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:03.336 A:middle
Try to avoid doing that.

00:47:03.686 --> 00:47:06.136 A:middle
There is some cost to
actually doing this lookup.

00:47:06.466 --> 00:47:08.836 A:middle
You want to defer doing this
lookup until you actually need

00:47:08.836 --> 00:47:11.196 A:middle
to and then cache
the data afterward.

00:47:11.196 --> 00:47:14.356 A:middle
Okay, so that's app attribution.

00:47:14.356 --> 00:47:15.976 A:middle
The next thing we can talk

00:47:15.976 --> 00:47:18.876 A:middle
about is the app
audience retargeting APIs.

00:47:19.066 --> 00:47:20.856 A:middle
These are new APIs in iOS 8.

00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:24.986 A:middle
So what is app audience
retargeting to begin with?

00:47:25.186 --> 00:47:28.586 A:middle
Audience retargeting allows you
to group the users of your app,

00:47:28.666 --> 00:47:32.686 A:middle
that particular audience, into
various categories depending

00:47:32.686 --> 00:47:35.676 A:middle
on their activity within your
app, or things that you know

00:47:35.676 --> 00:47:37.766 A:middle
about them from their
use of your app.

00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:41.836 A:middle
This might be frequent
in-app purchases.

00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:45.116 A:middle
It might be a very high
usage rate relative

00:47:45.116 --> 00:47:46.426 A:middle
to other users within your app.

00:47:47.016 --> 00:47:49.976 A:middle
It might be dormant users, users
who used your app a while ago

00:47:49.976 --> 00:47:51.456 A:middle
but you haven't seen in a while.

00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:56.696 A:middle
You can then use this
information to target new ads

00:47:56.696 --> 00:48:01.086 A:middle
in iAd Workbench directly at
specific subgroups of your users


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:56.696 --> 00:48:01.086 A:middle
in iAd Workbench directly at
specific subgroups of your users

00:48:01.276 --> 00:48:06.476 A:middle
to reach specific audiences
within the users of your app.

00:48:06.726 --> 00:48:09.516 A:middle
Each group defines
what we call a segment.

00:48:09.896 --> 00:48:11.156 A:middle
That's terminology
that's going to come

00:48:11.156 --> 00:48:12.226 A:middle
up in the next couple of slides.

00:48:12.226 --> 00:48:13.126 A:middle
That's important to know.

00:48:13.466 --> 00:48:15.696 A:middle
A specific group of
your users is a --

00:48:15.806 --> 00:48:18.746 A:middle
with a specific name
is a segment.

00:48:21.356 --> 00:48:23.586 A:middle
So why would you
want to use this?

00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:25.756 A:middle
Let's say you're a
game app developer.

00:48:26.976 --> 00:48:29.266 A:middle
You want to promote the
new iAd version of your app

00:48:29.266 --> 00:48:31.006 A:middle
to all your iPhone users.

00:48:31.086 --> 00:48:34.306 A:middle
You want to go back and reach
those specific users and say,

00:48:34.306 --> 00:48:37.876 A:middle
"Hey, I've got a great
new iPad version of it.

00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:38.626 A:middle
Come try it again.

00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:40.946 A:middle
Come back to this app,
maybe re-download it."

00:48:42.666 --> 00:48:45.316 A:middle
If there's new features
that affect specific subsets

00:48:45.316 --> 00:48:49.056 A:middle
of your app you can use this
to reach those specific users.

00:48:49.436 --> 00:48:51.656 A:middle
That's going to ensure that
the ads you create are going

00:48:51.656 --> 00:48:53.786 A:middle
to reach precisely the
audience you're attempting

00:48:53.786 --> 00:48:58.426 A:middle
to target with those ads.

00:48:58.426 --> 00:49:00.536 A:middle
Similarly you can
reengage dormant users.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.426 --> 00:49:00.536 A:middle
Similarly you can
reengage dormant users.

00:49:00.536 --> 00:49:02.206 A:middle
If you've got users
that you haven't seen

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:05.296 A:middle
in a while you can craft a
message specifically designed

00:49:05.296 --> 00:49:07.206 A:middle
to try to pull those
people back into your app

00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:09.906 A:middle
to reengage those uses who
may not have used your app

00:49:09.906 --> 00:49:10.486 A:middle
in some time.

00:49:12.696 --> 00:49:15.336 A:middle
If you're a retail app
instead there's similar reasons

00:49:15.336 --> 00:49:16.106 A:middle
to use this.

00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:19.326 A:middle
It can remind users who may
have abandoned a shopping cart

00:49:19.326 --> 00:49:22.486 A:middle
in your app, segment those into
something, send them a message,

00:49:22.586 --> 00:49:24.296 A:middle
"Hey, you abandoned
your shopping cart.

00:49:24.296 --> 00:49:26.816 A:middle
Maybe you should come back
and reengage with this app.

00:49:26.846 --> 00:49:28.556 A:middle
Maybe you still want to
purchase those things."

00:49:29.346 --> 00:49:31.576 A:middle
If you've got loyal
customers maybe you want

00:49:31.576 --> 00:49:32.536 A:middle
to send them a special offer.

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.686 A:middle
Maybe you want to send them a
gift for being a loyal customer,

00:49:34.966 --> 00:49:36.666 A:middle
you can do that with
an ad as well.

00:49:36.666 --> 00:49:41.296 A:middle
You can retarget specific ads to
specific segments of your users.

00:49:41.956 --> 00:49:44.816 A:middle
If they've -- you
can group customers

00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:47.366 A:middle
into specific categories based
on their previous purchases.

00:49:47.366 --> 00:49:49.856 A:middle
You can promote sales based
on their previous purchases.

00:49:49.976 --> 00:49:53.146 A:middle
All these are done by segmenting
those users into specific groups

00:49:53.676 --> 00:49:56.486 A:middle
and recording that so
that you can reengage

00:49:56.486 --> 00:49:58.166 A:middle
with those users
with specific ads.

00:49:58.256 --> 00:49:59.976 A:middle
So how does this actually work?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:02.506 A:middle
First thing you're going
to do is you're going to go

00:50:02.506 --> 00:50:05.406 A:middle
on iAd Workbench, and you're
going to create segments.

00:50:05.646 --> 00:50:07.586 A:middle
And you're going to tell
iAd Workbench, "Hey,

00:50:07.586 --> 00:50:09.756 A:middle
I'm going to group these people
into 10 different segments.

00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:12.536 A:middle
Please give me some segment
identifiers to use for that."

00:50:12.816 --> 00:50:14.846 A:middle
It's important to notice that
you do not create segment --

00:50:14.846 --> 00:50:17.816 A:middle
specific segment identifiers;
iAd Workbench does instead,

00:50:17.816 --> 00:50:20.306 A:middle
and this is partially
for privacy reasons.

00:50:20.306 --> 00:50:22.656 A:middle
We manage the specific
segment identifiers.

00:50:23.556 --> 00:50:25.676 A:middle
Once you've done that
you're going to go ahead

00:50:25.676 --> 00:50:27.956 A:middle
and update your app and take
advantage of the new APIs,

00:50:27.956 --> 00:50:30.516 A:middle
so you can actually
associate specific segments

00:50:30.516 --> 00:50:31.936 A:middle
with specific users.

00:50:32.036 --> 00:50:33.136 A:middle
And that goes up to the server

00:50:33.136 --> 00:50:34.926 A:middle
so we can actually
record that information.

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.596 A:middle
Once that's done you go
back to iAd Workbench,

00:50:38.626 --> 00:50:41.376 A:middle
and you create your
new Workbench campaign

00:50:41.686 --> 00:50:45.466 A:middle
to retarget those customers
with some specific ad message.

00:50:46.046 --> 00:50:49.576 A:middle
Okay, so how do you
actually do this?

00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:51.216 A:middle
Actually very simple
on the client side.

00:50:51.646 --> 00:50:52.986 A:middle
You're going to Include iAd.

00:50:54.206 --> 00:50:56.386 A:middle
You're going to create
an array of segments,

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.646 A:middle
and these are segments --

00:50:57.806 --> 00:51:00.486 A:middle
the segment identifiers are
what you've already gotten


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:57.806 --> 00:51:00.486 A:middle
the segment identifiers are
what you've already gotten

00:51:00.486 --> 00:51:01.386 A:middle
from Workbench.

00:51:01.386 --> 00:51:03.476 A:middle
If you attempt to send
random segment identifiers

00:51:03.476 --> 00:51:05.506 A:middle
up to iAd we're just
going to ignore them,

00:51:05.506 --> 00:51:07.026 A:middle
so you want to make sure
you're using the ones

00:51:07.026 --> 00:51:09.696 A:middle
that you've already created
and set up inside Workbench.

00:51:10.036 --> 00:51:13.346 A:middle
So maybe you decided you know
Segment A is loyal users,

00:51:13.346 --> 00:51:15.816 A:middle
Segment B is frequent
purchases, and you want

00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:18.316 A:middle
to associate the current
user with those two segments.

00:51:18.316 --> 00:51:19.866 A:middle
And you go ahead and
create a segment array

00:51:19.866 --> 00:51:20.926 A:middle
with those segments in it.

00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:24.226 A:middle
And you're going to call
ADClient sharedClient,

00:51:24.226 --> 00:51:28.226 A:middle
addClientToSegments,
replaceExisting.

00:51:28.226 --> 00:51:31.496 A:middle
This is by default with
replaceExisting:NO going

00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:34.316 A:middle
to add these segments
to the current user.

00:51:34.316 --> 00:51:37.126 A:middle
If instead you'd like to
say, "Hey, these are all

00:51:37.126 --> 00:51:38.766 A:middle
of the segments I'd like
to associate the user,"

00:51:39.116 --> 00:51:41.386 A:middle
which might also allow
you to remove old segments

00:51:41.386 --> 00:51:44.306 A:middle
from the user, you can just
update that replaceExisting

00:51:44.306 --> 00:51:47.056 A:middle
to yes to just completely
replace the old set

00:51:47.226 --> 00:51:48.116 A:middle
with the new set.

00:51:50.456 --> 00:51:55.466 A:middle
Okay, so that's basically iAd
for promotion, the new APIs

00:51:55.466 --> 00:51:56.836 A:middle
that we've added in iOS 8.

00:51:57.346 --> 00:51:58.526 A:middle
So what did we learn?

00:52:00.406 --> 00:52:02.696 A:middle
First of all, there's some
best practices for using iAd.

00:52:02.996 --> 00:52:04.896 A:middle
There are four different types
of banners that we've talked --

00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:06.526 A:middle
four different types of ads
that we've talked about.

00:52:06.526 --> 00:52:07.116 A:middle
There's a banner.

00:52:07.586 --> 00:52:08.446 A:middle
There's an interstitial.

00:52:09.016 --> 00:52:09.956 A:middle
There's a medium rect.

00:52:10.196 --> 00:52:12.876 A:middle
And there's a pre-roll, and
they all have their place.

00:52:13.216 --> 00:52:15.936 A:middle
You want to take advantage
of the different ad formats

00:52:15.936 --> 00:52:19.086 A:middle
that we've given to you,
think about where they belong

00:52:19.086 --> 00:52:22.306 A:middle
in your app, and make sure
you use the appropriate ad

00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:23.706 A:middle
for the appropriate context.

00:52:24.086 --> 00:52:27.406 A:middle
As part of that consider the
user when you're placing ads.

00:52:27.976 --> 00:52:31.746 A:middle
Yes, ads are very valuable
for generating revenue

00:52:31.746 --> 00:52:34.216 A:middle
from your app, and iAd can
help a lot with doing that.

00:52:34.856 --> 00:52:39.596 A:middle
But great revenue and great apps
start with great users as well.

00:52:39.596 --> 00:52:41.566 A:middle
If you're going to
alienate all of your users

00:52:41.676 --> 00:52:46.216 A:middle
by poor ad placement, by poor ad
choice you're not actually going

00:52:46.216 --> 00:52:46.886 A:middle
to have a net win here.

00:52:47.196 --> 00:52:50.216 A:middle
You want to really make sure
you have a user-centric focus

00:52:50.426 --> 00:52:52.346 A:middle
to where you're picking
to put ads

00:52:52.346 --> 00:52:54.566 A:middle
and which type you're
choosing to put there.

00:52:56.916 --> 00:53:00.636 A:middle
In addition, there's
a cycle here

00:52:56.916 --> 00:53:00.636 A:middle
In addition, there's
a cycle here

00:53:00.636 --> 00:53:02.946 A:middle
between monetization
and promotion.

00:53:03.216 --> 00:53:06.496 A:middle
Okay, optimize your ad's
performance to begin --

00:53:06.496 --> 00:53:08.856 A:middle
your app's ad performance
to begin with, that's going

00:53:08.856 --> 00:53:10.066 A:middle
to generate revenue from it.

00:53:10.976 --> 00:53:12.856 A:middle
But don't forget to take
advantage of iAd Workbench

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.646 A:middle
and re-promote your app.

00:53:14.646 --> 00:53:17.976 A:middle
It's important to continue
to get new users for your app

00:53:17.976 --> 00:53:20.276 A:middle
if you want to continue to
get revenue from your app.

00:53:20.886 --> 00:53:22.096 A:middle
The two feed into each other.

00:53:22.096 --> 00:53:24.156 A:middle
You want to generate revenue;
you want to spend some

00:53:24.156 --> 00:53:26.876 A:middle
of your revenue to re-advertise
your app and acquire new users.

00:53:27.346 --> 00:53:32.026 A:middle
Okay, so those are some sort
of best practices for iAd.

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:36.296 A:middle
For more information beyond this
we've got Mark Malone is our iAd

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:37.546 A:middle
Technologies Evangelist.

00:53:37.546 --> 00:53:39.366 A:middle
You can reach him at
the email address above.

00:53:40.046 --> 00:53:42.996 A:middle
There's an iAd Programming
Guide online along

00:53:42.996 --> 00:53:45.896 A:middle
with the iOS STK
developer information.

00:53:46.646 --> 00:53:48.906 A:middle
There's some Apple developer
forums that we monitor.

00:53:48.906 --> 00:53:51.666 A:middle
If you've got questions,
you and other developers,

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:53.696 A:middle
and us will be monitoring
those to answer questions,

00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:54.526 A:middle
hopefully help you out.

00:53:54.526 --> 00:53:58.336 A:middle
There are a couple related
sessions here at WWCC.

00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:00.596 A:middle
Unfortunately you already
missed The New iTunes Connect

Unfortunately you already
missed The New iTunes Connect

00:54:00.596 --> 00:54:01.916 A:middle
which talked a little
bit about iAd.

00:54:02.116 --> 00:54:03.076 A:middle
That was yesterday.

00:54:03.296 --> 00:54:04.256 A:middle
You can watch the video.

00:54:04.656 --> 00:54:07.346 A:middle
Tomorrow morning at 9:00 in
Nob Hill there's What's New

00:54:07.346 --> 00:54:08.886 A:middle
in iAd Workbench
which is going to go

00:54:08.886 --> 00:54:11.546 A:middle
into a little bit more detail
about the app attribution

00:54:11.546 --> 00:54:13.456 A:middle
and the audience segment
retargeting that I talked

00:54:13.456 --> 00:54:15.286 A:middle
about at the end of
this presentation.

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:16.556 A:middle
And that's it.

00:54:16.826 --> 00:54:17.566 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:54:17.566 --> 00:54:19.000 A:middle
