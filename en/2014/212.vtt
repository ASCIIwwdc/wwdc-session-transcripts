00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:13.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.246 A:middle
Welcome to Storyboards
and Controllers on OS X.

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:21.236 A:middle
My name's Mike, and I work on
the Interface Builder team.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.976 A:middle
Today, I'd like to show you
how you can build your OS X

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:28.886 A:middle
applications faster and easier
using the all-new Storyboards

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:31.046 A:middle
in Xcode 6 and Yosemite.

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:34.156 A:middle
I'm also going to be joined
later by my colleague Raleigh

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:36.946 A:middle
from the AppKit team, who
will come up and take us

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:38.706 A:middle
under the hood of the
new controllers API

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.236 A:middle
that make Storyboards work.

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.936 A:middle
So just a quick show
of hands here,

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:47.856 A:middle
who is already building an app
today for iOS using Storyboards?

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:50.616 A:middle
Oh, awesome, cool.

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:54.306 A:middle
So you'll probably notice
a little bit of what I'm

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:56.636 A:middle
about to show you is going
to look pretty familiar.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:00.176 A:middle
So what are we going to see?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:00.176 A:middle
So what are we going to see?

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:03.936 A:middle
First, I'm going to start by
giving you a brief overview

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.385 A:middle
of how storyboards work.

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:08.966 A:middle
Then, I'm going to give a demo
showing how you can quickly

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.586 A:middle
connect the top-level
controllers

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:13.676 A:middle
and interface your app
together using Xcode 6.

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:16.816 A:middle
Hopefully, you'll see how
Storyboards can help you

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:20.036 A:middle
structure your app into modular
and reusable view controllers.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:22.396 A:middle
Then, Raleigh's going to come up

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.316 A:middle
and show us the view
controller API.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.836 A:middle
We'll see how all of the pieces
click together underneath the

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:30.916 A:middle
Storyboard scenes, and he'll
show you the best places to hook

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:31.766 A:middle
into the infrastructure.

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:35.496 A:middle
And finally, as a bonus,
he's going to show you how

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.386 A:middle
to use the new gesture
recognizers in OS X

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.966 A:middle
without having to write
an NS event tracking loop.

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:42.646 A:middle
All you have to do is just drag,

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.236 A:middle
connect to your target
in action.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.196 A:middle
They're so simple,
it's simply amazing.

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:53.646 A:middle
So in Xcode, Storyboards are a
great way to see all UI parts

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.346 A:middle
of your application laid out in
a way that's easy to understand.

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.866 A:middle
Take for example an
application like Pages.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:03.036 A:middle
We can decompose each of
the major pieces of the UI


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:03.036 A:middle
We can decompose each of
the major pieces of the UI

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.456 A:middle
into each major section
of functionality,

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.196 A:middle
like the window toolbar,

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.816 A:middle
the document area,
and the shape picker.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:12.106 A:middle
Each of these views has a
corresponding controller,

00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:17.436 A:middle
and we show that in the
storyboard as a scene.

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:20.916 A:middle
Each scene represents a view
and view controller pair.

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:24.076 A:middle
The lines connecting the
scenes, known as segues,

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:26.736 A:middle
show the relationships
between them.

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:30.076 A:middle
Some of these relationships
represent a containment

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.606 A:middle
of view controllers
inside of each other.

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:34.436 A:middle
Other segue lines
represent transitions

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:35.676 A:middle
between view controllers.

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:38.536 A:middle
But each one represents
a flow of data

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:43.706 A:middle
in some form within the app.

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:47.506 A:middle
In your code, view controllers
are where you, the developer,

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:50.046 A:middle
actually get your hands
into controlling both the UI

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:51.706 A:middle
and the underlying data model.

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:53.826 A:middle
Each top-level scene

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.066 A:middle
in a storyboard represents one
view controller in your code.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:02.096 A:middle
Each controller is a
reusable self-contained module


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:02.096 A:middle
Each controller is a
reusable self-contained module

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.776 A:middle
of user interface
and control logic.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.736 A:middle
Within that controller scene,

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.536 A:middle
you can do everything you
would normally do inside

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.426 A:middle
of a ZIB file, like
place the UI,

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:14.416 A:middle
set up auto layout constraints,
connect outlets and actions

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:17.966 A:middle
to their parent view controllers
and its represented object.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.296 A:middle
So how do these scenes actually
connect with each other?

00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:27.516 A:middle
Well, segues are really the
glue, or the connective tissues,

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:31.206 A:middle
between each of the major
blocks of your apps UI.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:33.406 A:middle
You may have noticed
that on iOS,

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:35.376 A:middle
segues usually represent
a transition

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:37.726 A:middle
between whole full-screen views.

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:40.726 A:middle
When we took a look
at the relationships

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:42.756 A:middle
between view controllers
on OS X, though,

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:46.546 A:middle
we noticed a somewhat different
relationship: containment.

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:49.376 A:middle
On OS X, most applications tend

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:51.626 A:middle
to group their views
together in the same window.

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:54.256 A:middle
There aren't many
transitions bringing views on-

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:57.296 A:middle
and off-screen because you
actually have the screen real

00:03:57.296 --> 00:03:59.366 A:middle
estate to show them all
inside the same window.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.486 A:middle
Some are grouped in splits
or sometimes hidden in tabs.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.486 A:middle
Some are grouped in splits
or sometimes hidden in tabs.

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:06.776 A:middle
That's not to say that we
don't have presentation segues

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.916 A:middle
on OS X as well.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:12.116 A:middle
We just have fewer of
them: at modal dialogues,

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
window modal sheets,
and popovers.

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.656 A:middle
Like the presentation
segues on iOS,

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:20.176 A:middle
in order to make these work
it's your responsibility

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.486 A:middle
to override the Prepare
for Segue method

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.526 A:middle
in your parent view controller.

00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:28.336 A:middle
From there, you can
take the passed in

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.976 A:middle
and a storyboard segue object,

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:33.516 A:middle
get the destination view
controller and configure it

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:35.056 A:middle
and set the represented object,

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.656 A:middle
or do any other initialization
you need,

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:39.256 A:middle
right before it's
presented up on screen.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.946 A:middle
So if there's one line of code
that is absolutely necessary

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:49.016 A:middle
and that you need to remember,
it's Prepare for Segue.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:52.816 A:middle
So at build time, each
storyboard scene is broken

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:54.966 A:middle
down into each of its
constituent parts.

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:57.596 A:middle
Views are separated
from view controllers,

00:04:57.956 --> 00:04:59.976 A:middle
windows are separated
from window controllers,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:03.296 A:middle
and the transition
segues are embedded inside

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:04.556 A:middle
of their parent controllers.

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:08.526 A:middle
This is done to make the process
of loading your user interface

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
as lazy as possible at runtime.

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.066 A:middle
Then, as a performance
optimization,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.776 A:middle
the container controllers
absorb all

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:18.646 A:middle
of their child controllers
together in the same unit.

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.456 A:middle
This is because all of
those controllers are going

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:23.486 A:middle
to be needed at the
initial load time

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:25.536 A:middle
of the top-level
container controller,

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:28.716 A:middle
and it's just more efficient
to unarchive one file.

00:05:29.636 --> 00:05:33.846 A:middle
Then, each unit is compiled
into a NIB file, and then all

00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:37.036 A:middle
of the NIBs are bundled together
inside of a .storyboardc bundle.

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:40.246 A:middle
Then, that bundle
is nestled inside

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:41.926 A:middle
of your Applications
Resources Directory,

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:45.036 A:middle
and then Up Your App
can go to the store.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:48.446 A:middle
So we've put a lot
of thought and work

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:49.776 A:middle
into the Storyboard Compiler

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.976 A:middle
to make sure you get the
most efficient loading

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.756 A:middle
at runtime while letting you use
the most flexible UI to be able

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:58.546 A:middle
to connect and rewire
the relationships

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.466 A:middle
between your controllers
on the canvas,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.466 A:middle
between your controllers
on the canvas,

00:06:00.906 --> 00:06:02.846 A:middle
all with the absolute
minimum of glue code.

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:06.456 A:middle
So let's see how this all works
over here on the demo machine.

00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:12.086 A:middle
So as our way of testing
storyboards and to make sure

00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:15.006 A:middle
that everything that we're
building is actually working,

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:18.396 A:middle
we started by rewriting an
old piece of sample code

00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:20.786 A:middle
that you may be familiar
with called Sketch.

00:06:21.906 --> 00:06:25.066 A:middle
In our storyboard based
Sketch: The Next Generation,

00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:28.176 A:middle
we're taking a classic
document based app

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:31.156 A:middle
and we're remodeling
much of the control logic

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.066 A:middle
into view controllers.

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:36.606 A:middle
So as you can see here, we
have the main storyboard

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:37.446 A:middle
of our application.

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.906 A:middle
It already has a number of
scenes that we've prepopulated

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:47.446 A:middle
with view controllers, and what
we want to do is to show a UI

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:52.756 A:middle
that has our canvas where you
can drop shapes and use gestures

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:55.656 A:middle
to manipulate them
and then have a split.

00:06:55.656 --> 00:06:58.746 A:middle
And on the other side of that
will be the inspector area

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.526 A:middle
where you can see the
different properties


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.526 A:middle
where you can see the
different properties

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:02.656 A:middle
of the currently selected shape.

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:07.496 A:middle
So to model this, I'm going to
use a split view controller,

00:07:08.576 --> 00:07:10.926 A:middle
and I'm just going to drag
that out into the canvas here.

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:14.226 A:middle
And it comes with two
view controllers already,

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:17.236 A:middle
which I don't really need
because I already have my canvas

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:23.606 A:middle
that I can just wire up
here and drag, connect

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:25.996 A:middle
and create a split
item out of that.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:29.026 A:middle
And then we want to wire
up the inspector as well.

00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:33.056 A:middle
And you can see here we
have like a little preview

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:35.656 A:middle
of what the canvas and
the inspector look like.

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.256 A:middle
And it's using the
auto layout constraints

00:07:38.346 --> 00:07:40.156 A:middle
that have already been
set in those views.

00:07:41.056 --> 00:07:42.296 A:middle
Also, to get this to show up,

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:44.826 A:middle
we want to take our
window controller

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:47.456 A:middle
and connect the new split
view controller and say

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:51.216 A:middle
that this is going to be the
windows content view controller.

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:55.376 A:middle
So looks like all of
our boxes have all

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:56.326 A:middle
of the lines connected to them.

00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:59.386 A:middle
Let's run this and
see what shows up.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:06.126 A:middle
So here is our application,
and as I resize it,

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.956 A:middle
you'll notice that, you know,

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.556 A:middle
we have a good enforced
minimum size

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.176 A:middle
from our auto layout
constraints,

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:17.856 A:middle
but the split is not
sticking kind of to the side

00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:18.826 A:middle
where we would want it.

00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:21.066 A:middle
As we resize the window it
just keeps getting bigger.

00:08:21.636 --> 00:08:23.386 A:middle
So I know what I
can do to fix this.

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:28.146 A:middle
I just have to go to the
split view controller

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:31.656 A:middle
and find the split view item
that corresponds to that.

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:36.966 A:middle
And I can set the holding
priority of the split

00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:39.145 A:middle
to be just a little bit
more than the default.

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.785 A:middle
And while we're here,
we might as well mark it

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:44.086 A:middle
as saying it can collapse
because, you know,

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:47.026 A:middle
we might not want to always
see the details of all

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.396 A:middle
of the shapes on canvas.

00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:53.926 A:middle
So let's run this
and see how it looks.

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:54.566 A:middle
All right.

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:57.396 A:middle
Now, as I drag this, we notice

00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.816 A:middle
that the split view edge is
actually hugging the side


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.816 A:middle
that the split view edge is
actually hugging the side

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:03.806 A:middle
of the window, as we want it,
so let's try and add a shape.

00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:10.866 A:middle
Oh, and it looks like we don't
have our Shape Add button hooked

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:14.806 A:middle
up, so I'm going to
create a new kind of segue.

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:20.876 A:middle
And I'm going to show the shape
picker controller as a popover.

00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:28.636 A:middle
And in order to make this work
though, there is one piece

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:32.156 A:middle
of code that we all have to
remember to implement in order

00:09:32.726 --> 00:09:36.366 A:middle
for these to work is
the Prepare for Segue.

00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:39.616 A:middle
So I'm actually going to
open up the Assistant Editor

00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:47.456 A:middle
and I should see the
canvas view controller.

00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:48.226 A:middle
Here we go.

00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:51.596 A:middle
And it looks like somebody has
already helpfully written the

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:53.686 A:middle
code for me, so I'm just
going to uncomment it here.

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:58.476 A:middle
And what it does is it takes
the destination view controller

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
out of the Passed In
and a storyboard segue.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
out of the Passed In
and a storyboard segue.

00:10:01.446 --> 00:10:05.706 A:middle
And what we're doing is we're
initializing it and saying

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:09.406 A:middle
that the shape container
is going to be the canvas,

00:10:09.406 --> 00:10:11.056 A:middle
which is ourself in this case.

00:10:11.056 --> 00:10:14.516 A:middle
The canvas is initiating the
segue and it's also going

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:17.386 A:middle
to be the destination where we
want to add new shapes to it.

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:19.286 A:middle
So let's build and run this.

00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:28.366 A:middle
And when we click on it, great.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:29.596 A:middle
So now we have a shape.

00:10:30.106 --> 00:10:34.146 A:middle
I can't seem to do
anything with it.

00:10:34.146 --> 00:10:38.226 A:middle
I can't move it, but I think
I'll leave that for Raleigh.

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:43.766 A:middle
But as one more little bonus
before I leave, I want to hook

00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:46.966 A:middle
up what is going to be
a Preferences window.

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:50.726 A:middle
And I just want to show you just
how easy this is 'cause this is

00:10:50.886 --> 00:10:52.046 A:middle
one of my favorite features.

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:55.306 A:middle
I just couldn't wait
to show you guys.

00:10:55.936 --> 00:10:58.716 A:middle
Right here we have
a TabViewController

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:01.546 A:middle
that has both a General
Pref pane


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:01.546 A:middle
that has both a General
Pref pane

00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:03.126 A:middle
and some keyboard shortcuts.

00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:05.876 A:middle
And what I can do
is I can wire this

00:11:05.876 --> 00:11:09.256 A:middle
up to the Preferences menu item.

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:12.306 A:middle
And just say for the sake
of demo we're just going

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.136 A:middle
to show this as a
modal dialogue.

00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:21.496 A:middle
And if I run this, you'll
notice that we have a sketch

00:11:22.226 --> 00:11:25.186 A:middle
with fully functional
preferences.

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:27.356 A:middle
And you notice the
nice new crossfade

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:28.606 A:middle
between these two views,

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:30.576 A:middle
which comes with the
TabViewController.

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:33.156 A:middle
But this doesn't look exactly

00:11:33.156 --> 00:11:34.876 A:middle
like Preferences windows
that you're used to.

00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:39.016 A:middle
One of the really cool
options that have been added

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:42.816 A:middle
to the TabViewController
is a new style that,

00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:46.286 A:middle
besides just tabs on
top or tabs on bottom,

00:11:46.716 --> 00:11:49.836 A:middle
we can actually say we
want toolbar style tabs.

00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:55.586 A:middle
And if we actually specify the
class of our view controllers --

00:11:56.036 --> 00:11:59.606 A:middle
in this case this is the General
Prefs pane view controller,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:04.626 A:middle
and then this one is the
keyboard shortcuts view

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:12.216 A:middle
controller -- we will find
within your document the images

00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:17.976 A:middle
that are named the same as the
class of the view controller.

00:12:18.486 --> 00:12:26.936 A:middle
So when we run this now, you'll
see a new Preferences window

00:12:27.606 --> 00:12:31.356 A:middle
that has the icons
and the titles

00:12:31.356 --> 00:12:34.566 A:middle
of the child view controllers.

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:39.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:44.556 A:middle
So let's switch back to slides.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.556 A:middle
So how easy was that?

00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:48.096 A:middle
Just by wiring up a few
segues on the canvas

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.096 A:middle
and overriding Prepare
for Segue,

00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:52.906 A:middle
we are able to plumb
together the view controllers

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.456 A:middle
into a fully functional
application.

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:57.876 A:middle
And that Preferences window
didn't even use a single line

00:12:57.876 --> 00:12:58.296 A:middle
of code.

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.536 A:middle
So now I'd like to
ask Raleigh to come up


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.536 A:middle
So now I'd like to
ask Raleigh to come up

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:04.216 A:middle
and show us how storyboards
actually works under the hood.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:05.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mike.

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:11.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:15.146 A:middle
Now that you've seen how
incredibly easy it is

00:13:15.686 --> 00:13:17.826 A:middle
to design your application
using storyboards

00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:21.146 A:middle
and to wire everything up,
I'm going to pop open the hood

00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:23.016 A:middle
and we're going to take a look
at the machinery underneath

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:24.766 A:middle
that drives this whole thing.

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:28.736 A:middle
We've got a lot to cover here.

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:31.596 A:middle
Just a little bit of API
with storyboards itself.

00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:33.926 A:middle
There's a lot of new API
with view controllers.

00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:35.316 A:middle
We're going to talk a little bit

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:38.996 A:middle
about how window controllers
fits in with our proliferation

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:40.316 A:middle
of view controllers
that we're now adding.

00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
And we'll wrap it up
with gesture recognizers

00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:47.906 A:middle
and how they really mesh really
nicely with view controllers

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:49.516 A:middle
and designing your application.

00:13:49.846 --> 00:13:50.606 A:middle
It's really awesome.

00:13:51.306 --> 00:13:53.136 A:middle
So let's dig right
in with storyboards.

00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:58.296 A:middle
Storyboards are a resource file
in your project like NIBs are.

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:02.536 A:middle
By default if you
do the checkbox


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:02.536 A:middle
By default if you
do the checkbox

00:14:02.536 --> 00:14:03.406 A:middle
when you create a new project,

00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:04.816 A:middle
you can start off
with a storyboard.

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.636 A:middle
Or if you just create a
storyboard in your project,

00:14:07.636 --> 00:14:11.016 A:middle
a new one in the settings of
your project for your target,

00:14:11.206 --> 00:14:13.476 A:middle
you could just right there
in the main interface set

00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:15.976 A:middle
which storyboard to use
as your main interface.

00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:19.526 A:middle
Or even a NIB file, if you
happen to be transitioning

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.656 A:middle
from an old project
to a new one,

00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:21.756 A:middle
and the right thing will happen.

00:14:22.786 --> 00:14:24.906 A:middle
If you find yourself
with the need to dig

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.426 A:middle
down into the Info.plist
and set the keys manually,

00:14:27.906 --> 00:14:29.766 A:middle
this is the
NSMainStoryboardFile.

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:32.726 A:middle
This is the key you need
to set in your Info.plist

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:33.946 A:middle
to bring up the storyboard.

00:14:36.636 --> 00:14:39.576 A:middle
When we load the initial
storyboard, it's going to go

00:14:39.576 --> 00:14:42.376 A:middle
through this path just like
you can use this API storyboard

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:45.576 A:middle
with name to load any storyboard
that you have in your resources,

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:46.946 A:middle
and you could load
it from a name.

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:49.136 A:middle
And then you'd need

00:14:49.136 --> 00:14:51.196 A:middle
to instantiate the
initial controller.

00:14:52.006 --> 00:14:53.606 A:middle
What's the initial
controller you might ask?

00:14:53.606 --> 00:14:56.866 A:middle
Well, that's the controller that
has the arrow pointing to it

00:14:56.866 --> 00:14:59.006 A:middle
without some beginning
part to it.

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.446 A:middle
This is the initial guy.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.446 A:middle
This is the initial guy.

00:15:00.736 --> 00:15:02.486 A:middle
There's always one of
them with your storyboard.

00:15:02.746 --> 00:15:04.236 A:middle
That's going to be the
initial controller,

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.876 A:middle
and it's generally the
one you want to load up.

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.896 A:middle
When we load your
main storyboard file,

00:15:08.946 --> 00:15:11.166 A:middle
we'll automatically instantiate
the initial controller

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:12.846 A:middle
and set it running
on your behalf.

00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:18.116 A:middle
Not every controller that you
have in your storyboard needs

00:15:18.116 --> 00:15:20.616 A:middle
to be wired back up to that
initial view controller.

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:23.466 A:middle
You can have some that just
stand alone all on their own

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:24.836 A:middle
and you can give
them an identifier.

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:27.506 A:middle
And you can access
them by asking

00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:30.086 A:middle
to instantiate the
controller with identifier.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.156 A:middle
We'll find it in the
storyboard with that name.

00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:34.946 A:middle
We'll instantiate, start doing
the wiring up and hand it back

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:37.106 A:middle
to you, then you can
take it from there.

00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:42.276 A:middle
So that's really all there is
with storyboards as far as API.

00:15:42.496 --> 00:15:45.076 A:middle
There's not much
there; they just work.

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:45.856 A:middle
It's really nice.

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:50.916 A:middle
With view controllers -- we'll
move on to view controllers --

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.806 A:middle
there's a ton of new API here.

00:15:53.806 --> 00:15:55.606 A:middle
There's so much new API in
view controllers that I've got

00:15:55.606 --> 00:15:56.926 A:middle
to break it down into sections.

00:15:56.926 --> 00:15:59.936 A:middle
So we'll talk about loading and
layout and the life cycle there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:02.606 A:middle
About containerships; we've
got some really nice new stuff

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
with containership.

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.546 A:middle
Triggered segues, as you saw

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:07.116 A:middle
with the Plus button
to do the popover.

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:10.086 A:middle
And we'll wrap it up with how
to do things completely manual

00:16:10.326 --> 00:16:11.776 A:middle
if you need to get
down to that level.

00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:17.066 A:middle
So we have a lot of new
properties in NSViewController

00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
for loading, display,
and layout.

00:16:18.726 --> 00:16:21.066 A:middle
All of these methods
here are new except

00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:22.696 A:middle
for View Loaded,
which is the top one.

00:16:23.236 --> 00:16:26.856 A:middle
And the way I want
to talk about them is

00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:28.926 A:middle
in the life cycle
and how they're used.

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:30.916 A:middle
You'll have your
view controller.

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:32.626 A:middle
It will get initted
and allocated.

00:16:33.286 --> 00:16:35.506 A:middle
And it doesn't have a view
yet because view controllers

00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:37.746 A:middle
like to lazily load their
views, so there's no view yet.

00:16:38.076 --> 00:16:40.246 A:middle
View loaded is going
to return no if you ask

00:16:40.246 --> 00:16:41.406 A:middle
for its property at this point.

00:16:43.286 --> 00:16:45.836 A:middle
Then load view is
going to get called.

00:16:46.326 --> 00:16:48.376 A:middle
This has generally been the
place where you've gone ahead

00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:52.536 A:middle
and subclassed NSViewController
and overrode load view just

00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:53.916 A:middle
to call supernormally.

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:57.966 A:middle
By default, AppKit will go
ahead and try and load the NIB

00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.806 A:middle
with the name that you gave it

00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:03.086 A:middle
if you initialized it
init with NIB name.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:03.086 A:middle
if you initialized it
init with NIB name.

00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:07.546 A:middle
But new on Yosemite is
AppKit will go ahead

00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:10.665 A:middle
and if your NIB name is
nil, will look for a NIB

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.536 A:middle
that has the same name
as your view controller

00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:15.455 A:middle
and automatically
load that NIB for you.

00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:17.906 A:middle
So now you don't have to
subclass your view controller

00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:19.336 A:middle
to get the right NIB loaded.

00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:23.806 A:middle
You just name your NIB file
the right thing and it'll do it

00:17:23.806 --> 00:17:24.526 A:middle
for you automatically.

00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:29.036 A:middle
During load view, set view
is going to get called

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:31.026 A:middle
and your view is finally
set on your view controller.

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:33.026 A:middle
View loaded will now return yes.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.336 A:middle
And then we return
from load view,

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:38.096 A:middle
but before we continue the
run load, before we go back

00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:40.026 A:middle
to giving control to you
and your application,

00:17:40.396 --> 00:17:43.576 A:middle
view did load is going to be
called on your view controller.

00:17:44.116 --> 00:17:46.576 A:middle
It is at this point now
instead of overriding load view,

00:17:46.726 --> 00:17:47.916 A:middle
you override view did load

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:51.416 A:middle
and you do your one-time
instantiation finalization stuff

00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.236 A:middle
that you need to do there.

00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:55.316 A:middle
So this is something that
you only want to do once

00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:57.956 A:middle
when the view is loaded and
you'll never need to do again

00:17:57.956 --> 00:18:00.336 A:middle
because your view is going
to be hanging around.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.956 --> 00:18:00.336 A:middle
because your view is going
to be hanging around.

00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:05.506 A:middle
Now you're going to go ahead
and put your view in a window,

00:18:05.506 --> 00:18:08.006 A:middle
get the window on screen
and we're going to go

00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:09.176 A:middle
through the life
cycle of the view.

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:14.566 A:middle
So before your view gets
in the window as you add it

00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:17.216 A:middle
into the window, we'll
call view will appear.

00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:19.066 A:middle
And there are a few other places

00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:20.396 A:middle
that view will appear
gets called.

00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:23.676 A:middle
Whenever the window is
becoming visible for example,

00:18:23.846 --> 00:18:25.056 A:middle
as you're ordering it front,

00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:27.896 A:middle
perhaps the user has
previously hidden the window

00:18:27.896 --> 00:18:30.696 A:middle
or minimized it and now
they're unminimizing the window.

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:32.016 A:middle
And so this is another case

00:18:32.016 --> 00:18:33.446 A:middle
where you'll get a
view will appear.

00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:35.816 A:middle
So you could do some really
interesting things here.

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:40.856 A:middle
For example, you might want
to set your highlight color.

00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:43.916 A:middle
So the first time that
your view is asked to draw,

00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:46.226 A:middle
it draws with the correct
highlight color for example.

00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:49.876 A:middle
The animation is
now going to occur

00:18:50.086 --> 00:18:51.526 A:middle
after you return from this.

00:18:51.876 --> 00:18:53.536 A:middle
The window will be
animated on screen.

00:18:53.536 --> 00:18:55.546 A:middle
If you're unhiding the view
or you're doing some kind

00:18:55.546 --> 00:18:57.446 A:middle
of transition, that
transition animation occurs.

00:18:58.016 --> 00:19:00.776 A:middle
When that completes and your
view is drawn at least once,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.016 --> 00:19:00.776 A:middle
When that completes and your
view is drawn at least once,

00:19:01.326 --> 00:19:03.196 A:middle
view did appear will be
called in the view controller.

00:19:03.586 --> 00:19:05.476 A:middle
And now you can wire up
things that you didn't want

00:19:05.476 --> 00:19:06.646 A:middle
to interfere with
that animation.

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:07.776 A:middle
And you only want it

00:19:07.776 --> 00:19:10.326 A:middle
to be visible while
the window is visible

00:19:10.326 --> 00:19:11.446 A:middle
and your view is displayed.

00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:13.886 A:middle
You might want to set
up, just as an example,

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:17.766 A:middle
some animation that's running
here that just runs constantly

00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:19.166 A:middle
but only once it's visible.

00:19:19.716 --> 00:19:24.996 A:middle
At this point, the user
interacts with your view,

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.556 A:middle
interacts with your
user interface.

00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:28.466 A:middle
You're going to update your
constraints on your view,

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:29.336 A:middle
you're going to dirty them.

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:31.266 A:middle
Your view controller
gets to participate

00:19:31.266 --> 00:19:33.616 A:middle
in updating the constraints
with Update View Constraints,

00:19:33.656 --> 00:19:35.666 A:middle
and you get informed of when
layout is going to happen

00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:37.336 A:middle
with the will layout and
after layout happened

00:19:37.336 --> 00:19:37.996 A:middle
if you did layout.

00:19:38.186 --> 00:19:41.276 A:middle
So you can participate in
this as you normally would

00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:43.996 A:middle
with auto layout, but
you get to do it now

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:45.016 A:middle
at the view controller level.

00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:47.506 A:middle
And at some point you're going

00:19:47.996 --> 00:19:49.266 A:middle
to remove the view
from the window.

00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:52.466 A:middle
Perhaps you've changed tabs and
now the view is being hidden

00:19:52.836 --> 00:19:54.986 A:middle
or you've hiding the window.

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:56.076 A:middle
The user is hiding the window,

00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.586 A:middle
or you're just outright
closing the window.

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:00.056 A:middle
In either of these cases
you will be preceded


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:00.056 A:middle
In either of these cases
you will be preceded

00:20:00.056 --> 00:20:01.326 A:middle
with a view will disappear.

00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:03.506 A:middle
That animation we started
in view did appear,

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:05.046 A:middle
this is where we
would want to stop it.

00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:08.326 A:middle
Then the animation
occurs and the view

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.846 A:middle
or the window disappears with
the appropriate animation

00:20:10.846 --> 00:20:13.066 A:middle
and will call you back
with a view did disappear,

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.736 A:middle
and now you can release
any kind of final resources

00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:19.526 A:middle
that you don't want to hang on
to as the window is not visible

00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:21.406 A:middle
or your view is no
longer part of the window.

00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:26.036 A:middle
Then the life cycle just
continues as you switch tabs

00:20:26.036 --> 00:20:28.906 A:middle
and the views come back and go
away and windows hide and show.

00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:30.506 A:middle
We just continue this cycle.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.886 A:middle
New in Yosemite,
NSViewController is now

00:20:36.886 --> 00:20:37.866 A:middle
in the responder chain.

00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:40.536 A:middle
Where if we would start
off with our canvas view,

00:20:40.536 --> 00:20:42.306 A:middle
as we had in our demo
application there,

00:20:43.296 --> 00:20:46.006 A:middle
an event is hit tested to
the canvas view and flows

00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:47.886 A:middle
up through the split
view to the window

00:20:47.886 --> 00:20:49.146 A:middle
and finally your
window controller.

00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:53.286 A:middle
Your view controllers,
our canvas view controller

00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:55.966 A:middle
and split view controller,
can now participate in this.

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:57.306 A:middle
And they're automatically wired

00:20:57.306 --> 00:20:59.846 A:middle
up in the responder chain
right after their view.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:02.336 A:middle
So you can now participate
in events

00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:04.096 A:middle
and more importantly
in action methods.

00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:07.916 A:middle
And action methods is where
it really comes in handy.

00:21:08.426 --> 00:21:10.706 A:middle
For example, cut,
copy, and paste.

00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:14.396 A:middle
In your menu bar, cut, copy, and
paste is wired up to the cut,

00:21:14.396 --> 00:21:16.496 A:middle
copy, and paste actions
to the first responder.

00:21:16.846 --> 00:21:18.716 A:middle
And that might be the
canvas view in this case.

00:21:19.316 --> 00:21:20.856 A:middle
Well, our canvas view
doesn't really do much.

00:21:20.856 --> 00:21:22.846 A:middle
Most of our logic is in
our canvas view controller.

00:21:23.476 --> 00:21:27.116 A:middle
And previously you would've
had to catch cut, copy,

00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:28.156 A:middle
and paste in your view

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:31.336 A:middle
and somehow get it
to your controller.

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:33.856 A:middle
And now that canvas
view controller is

00:21:33.856 --> 00:21:36.946 A:middle
in the responder chain, you
can put the copy method right

00:21:36.946 --> 00:21:38.056 A:middle
in your canvas view controller

00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:42.086 A:middle
and canvas view can be
totally oblivious to this.

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.376 A:middle
And it works out really nicely.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.766 A:middle
I do want to point out,
though, that we only wire

00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:48.586 A:middle
up view controllers
automatically

00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:51.506 A:middle
in the responder chain if
you're linked on or after 10/10.

00:21:51.506 --> 00:21:55.396 A:middle
So let's move forward and
talk about containment.

00:21:55.396 --> 00:21:57.406 A:middle
We've got some really exciting
things to do with containment.

00:21:58.356 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
View controllers can
now have children


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.356 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
View controllers can
now have children

00:22:00.296 --> 00:22:02.086 A:middle
and you can give
back to your parent.

00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:05.226 A:middle
And the best way to talk about
containment is with an example.

00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:07.556 A:middle
So let's start off with tab view
controller and let's dive deep

00:22:07.556 --> 00:22:09.256 A:middle
into tab view controller.

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
So NSTabViewController is
going to manage in NSTabView.

00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:16.596 A:middle
And it manages a couple of
other views, and I'll get

00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:19.166 A:middle
into details there, but mainly
it manages the tab view.

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.406 A:middle
It's going to lazily
load your tab views.

00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:24.496 A:middle
And this is one of
my favorite things.

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:29.086 A:middle
In a past life, I've had tab
views that had a fair number

00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:31.856 A:middle
of tabs and a lot of content
in each one of those tabs.

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:34.556 A:middle
And loading this NIB file
from disc took forever.

00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:37.196 A:middle
Now that we lazily
load the tab views,

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:39.326 A:middle
just the initial selected
tab is going to get loaded

00:22:39.326 --> 00:22:41.076 A:middle
when you first bring
up your interface.

00:22:41.196 --> 00:22:43.296 A:middle
And it is much more
responsive to the user

00:22:43.296 --> 00:22:47.416 A:middle
that way; I really love this.

00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:49.396 A:middle
It's now much easier

00:22:49.396 --> 00:22:52.156 A:middle
to customize your tabs
using a tab view controller,

00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:54.456 A:middle
and I'll get into specifics
about that in a little bit.

00:22:55.566 --> 00:22:58.396 A:middle
And as you saw in the
demo it's incredibly easy.

00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:02.046 A:middle
Without code, you could get a
nice preferences user interface


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:02.046 A:middle
Without code, you could get a
nice preferences user interface

00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:03.866 A:middle
style using a tab
view controller.

00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:07.076 A:middle
And I'll show you exactly how
you would do that in code.

00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:11.736 A:middle
And it's just as easy as Mike
did it in the demo in IB.

00:23:13.136 --> 00:23:17.576 A:middle
On Mavericks an NSTabView looks
like this: There's an NSTabView.

00:23:17.576 --> 00:23:19.716 A:middle
It manages a collection
of NSTabView items.

00:23:19.716 --> 00:23:21.406 A:middle
Those tab view items
each have a view

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:24.396 A:middle
and some additional
properties, such as the label.

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:26.226 A:middle
So we know what label
to put in the tab.

00:23:26.876 --> 00:23:28.726 A:middle
With tab view controller,

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:32.246 A:middle
logically things are
now laid out like this.

00:23:32.666 --> 00:23:34.196 A:middle
There's an NSTabViewController

00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:38.126 A:middle
and the tab view
controller owns an NSTabView

00:23:38.436 --> 00:23:40.916 A:middle
and manages the collection
of NSTabView items.

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:44.866 A:middle
NSTabView item now has a couple
of additional properties:

00:23:45.116 --> 00:23:47.686 A:middle
the image, which is kind of
fun so you can get an image

00:23:47.686 --> 00:23:50.166 A:middle
in there, and of course
the view controller.

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:52.796 A:middle
And it's the view controller
that now owns the view,

00:23:52.956 --> 00:24:00.506 A:middle
and it can lazily load the view
as you switch to those tabs.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:52.956 --> 00:24:00.506 A:middle
and it can lazily load the view
as you switch to those tabs.

00:24:00.616 --> 00:24:02.916 A:middle
Since NSTabViewController
manages a collection

00:24:02.916 --> 00:24:03.976 A:middle
of tab view items, you can

00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:06.426 A:middle
of course get the
tab view item array.

00:24:07.316 --> 00:24:10.066 A:middle
You can also find out what the
selected tab view item index is.

00:24:10.066 --> 00:24:12.826 A:middle
And this is KVO-compliant,
so you can observe this.

00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:15.706 A:middle
This is much easier to observe
the selected tab view item index

00:24:15.706 --> 00:24:20.546 A:middle
than it was previously to have
a delegate and have to respond

00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:21.436 A:middle
to all the delegate methods.

00:24:21.436 --> 00:24:22.626 A:middle
So you don't have
to do that anymore.

00:24:23.176 --> 00:24:27.386 A:middle
As with any sort of containment
API, there's the add, insert,

00:24:27.386 --> 00:24:28.666 A:middle
and remove tab view items.

00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:33.626 A:middle
And if you have a child view
controller that is in one

00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:36.436 A:middle
of the tabs, you can just ask
for the tab view item associated

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:38.846 A:middle
with it via tab view
item for view controller.

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:45.856 A:middle
NSTabViewItem also has this
really nifty class method on it,

00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:48.396 A:middle
Tab View Item With
View Controller.

00:24:48.736 --> 00:24:52.166 A:middle
So you could take any generic
view controller that you have

00:24:52.506 --> 00:24:54.966 A:middle
and you can create a
default tab view controller

00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:57.356 A:middle
for it using this method.

00:24:57.416 --> 00:25:01.506 A:middle
And what this does is it doesn't
just create a generic tab


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.416 --> 00:25:01.506 A:middle
And what this does is it doesn't
just create a generic tab

00:25:01.506 --> 00:25:01.956 A:middle
view item.

00:25:01.956 --> 00:25:05.476 A:middle
It tries to populate it with
the appropriate information

00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:07.156 A:middle
from the child view controller.

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:09.246 A:middle
For example, it will
take the title

00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:10.806 A:middle
of your child view
controller and set

00:25:10.806 --> 00:25:12.396 A:middle
that as the label of
the tab view item.

00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:14.936 A:middle
And we'll also take
it a step further.

00:25:14.936 --> 00:25:18.936 A:middle
As Mike showed in the demo,
we look at the class name

00:25:18.936 --> 00:25:21.586 A:middle
of the view controller and we
try and find imagery sources

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:24.176 A:middle
with that same name or we
prefer if it's the name

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:27.536 A:middle
with a dash tab view item
and we'll automatically set

00:25:27.536 --> 00:25:31.856 A:middle
that image as the image
as the NSTabView item.

00:25:32.426 --> 00:25:35.356 A:middle
So you can get the label and
the item just automatically

00:25:35.356 --> 00:25:35.686 A:middle
that way.

00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:40.576 A:middle
TabViewController has some
additional properties,

00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:41.536 A:middle
which are pretty interesting.

00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:43.816 A:middle
There's the tab style
as Mike showed you.

00:25:43.816 --> 00:25:48.066 A:middle
We have segmented control
on top and on bottom.

00:25:48.496 --> 00:25:50.976 A:middle
So the tabs are now drawn
with the segmented control.

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:52.886 A:middle
We'll touch on that a
little bit more real soon.

00:25:53.176 --> 00:25:54.706 A:middle
There's the toolbar style.

00:25:55.026 --> 00:25:57.126 A:middle
That's all you have to do.

00:25:57.126 --> 00:25:58.906 A:middle
You set the tab style
to toolbar.

00:25:59.336 --> 00:26:01.166 A:middle
The TabViewController
will create the toolbar


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.336 --> 00:26:01.166 A:middle
The TabViewController
will create the toolbar

00:26:01.166 --> 00:26:03.536 A:middle
on your behalf and
place it in the window

00:26:03.536 --> 00:26:05.166 A:middle
as the toolbar; you're done.

00:26:05.746 --> 00:26:08.386 A:middle
And then there's unspecified,
which is really interesting,

00:26:08.386 --> 00:26:11.266 A:middle
and I'll get to that a little
bit more in just a second.

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:15.416 A:middle
As I talked about, there
is a segmented control

00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:17.066 A:middle
that now displays the tabs.

00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:19.486 A:middle
You can get the segmented
control.

00:26:19.706 --> 00:26:22.126 A:middle
You can supply your own
segmented control subclass

00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:25.576 A:middle
if you want and draw them in
your subclass however you wish.

00:26:27.956 --> 00:26:32.086 A:middle
But if you set the tab
style to unspecified,

00:26:32.706 --> 00:26:35.196 A:middle
what you can do then is go

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:37.926 A:middle
and apply your own
layout constraints

00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:39.406 A:middle
to the segmented control

00:26:39.686 --> 00:26:42.786 A:middle
and have the segmented control
appear where you want it

00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:44.186 A:middle
to appear and do
the layout yourself.

00:26:45.126 --> 00:26:49.246 A:middle
So you have much more customized
ability with tab view controller

00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:50.266 A:middle
than you've had previously.

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:53.226 A:middle
There are some transition
options.

00:26:53.546 --> 00:26:56.436 A:middle
Automatically by default
we set it to crossfade.

00:26:56.436 --> 00:26:59.296 A:middle
Mike showed you this in
the demo as he changed tabs

00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
in our preferences UI.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
in our preferences UI.

00:27:00.776 --> 00:27:02.736 A:middle
It did this nice
little crossfade effect.

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:06.066 A:middle
You can set it to none
and have the old style

00:27:06.066 --> 00:27:06.956 A:middle
where it just switches.

00:27:07.316 --> 00:27:09.266 A:middle
We have various sliding
directions:

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:11.266 A:middle
up, down, left and right.

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:14.616 A:middle
You can combine directions
that are on different axes,

00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:16.356 A:middle
so you can combine
an up with a left,

00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:18.596 A:middle
but you can't combine
an up with a down.

00:27:18.596 --> 00:27:21.206 A:middle
That wouldn't actually
animate anything,

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.526 A:middle
so we don't let you do that.

00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:24.646 A:middle
I do really want to
point out, though,

00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:27.056 A:middle
slide forward and
slide backwards.

00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.666 A:middle
These are really important if
you're going to do any sort

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.376 A:middle
of horizontal sliding
because they work

00:27:32.726 --> 00:27:35.236 A:middle
in the appropriate direction
for your users language.

00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.736 A:middle
So they work correctly in
right to left languages.

00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:41.446 A:middle
They will go the right way and
they will go the correct way

00:27:41.446 --> 00:27:43.496 A:middle
for left to right
languages as well.

00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:46.176 A:middle
And you just let AppKit worry

00:27:46.176 --> 00:27:47.606 A:middle
about what the right
directions are

00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:49.276 A:middle
and we'll handle that for you.

00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:52.676 A:middle
As I mentioned,

00:27:52.676 --> 00:27:56.016 A:middle
NSTabViewController
manages the tab view item.

00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:58.716 A:middle
In NSTabView it owns a tab view.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:04.716 A:middle
So it's important that you let
NSTabViewController manage it

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:05.176 A:middle
for you.

00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:07.126 A:middle
You don't really need to
get to it and change it.

00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:10.236 A:middle
There are a few properties,
very few properties,

00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:12.906 A:middle
that you can modify directly
to get to the tab view.

00:28:13.976 --> 00:28:15.336 A:middle
If you find you really
need to do this,

00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:16.916 A:middle
look at the NSTabViewController
header.

00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:19.656 A:middle
It specifies exactly
what you can set,

00:28:20.026 --> 00:28:22.646 A:middle
but in general let's have
your controller manage it.

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.286 A:middle
I also want to point out here

00:28:24.286 --> 00:28:28.586 A:middle
that as NSTabViewController
is a subclass

00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:29.996 A:middle
of view controller,
it has a view.

00:28:29.996 --> 00:28:32.036 A:middle
The view is not the tab view.

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:35.786 A:middle
Tab view controller has a
view that contains a tab view

00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:38.916 A:middle
and a segmented control
and perhaps other views

00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:41.316 A:middle
as tab view controller
needs to manage it.

00:28:41.416 --> 00:28:46.436 A:middle
So let tab view controller
handle it for you.

00:28:46.636 --> 00:28:48.286 A:middle
When you are using
the toolbar style,

00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:53.006 A:middle
NSTabViewController is the
delegate of the toolbar.

00:28:53.386 --> 00:28:56.996 A:middle
And you might want to
override these methods.

00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.726 A:middle
Create a subclass of
NSTabViewController

00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:00.246 A:middle
and override these
delegate methods.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:00.246 A:middle
and override these
delegate methods.

00:29:02.026 --> 00:29:05.276 A:middle
Perhaps you want to do something
like add some additional items

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.496 A:middle
to the toolbar that aren't tabs.

00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:10.546 A:middle
For example, a search
field, right.

00:29:11.096 --> 00:29:13.076 A:middle
If you want a search field,
then your purpose is UI.

00:29:13.766 --> 00:29:15.756 A:middle
Search isn't a tab,
so you will need

00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:18.046 A:middle
to override these
toolbar delegate methods

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.456 A:middle
and insert the search
field yourself.

00:29:20.456 --> 00:29:23.536 A:middle
I do want to point out that
these have the nice NS required

00:29:23.536 --> 00:29:27.746 A:middle
Super attribute on them, so if
you do override these methods,

00:29:27.746 --> 00:29:29.966 A:middle
you must call Super, and
the compiler will help you

00:29:29.966 --> 00:29:31.046 A:middle
remember that.

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:33.866 A:middle
So that's tab view controller.

00:29:34.026 --> 00:29:35.466 A:middle
Let's take a look
at another example.

00:29:35.466 --> 00:29:37.696 A:middle
We're introducing split
view controller in Yosemite.

00:29:38.086 --> 00:29:41.376 A:middle
It manages it in a split view

00:29:41.796 --> 00:29:43.946 A:middle
and it does lazy
loading of views.

00:29:44.796 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
And it requires auto layout.

00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:50.826 A:middle
It does all of the managing of
the splits and how they move

00:29:50.826 --> 00:29:52.736 A:middle
with window resizing,
all view, auto layout.

00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:55.406 A:middle
It would just start adding
constraints to your window.

00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:58.436 A:middle
But we have all migrated
our apps forward

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:00.616 A:middle
to using auto layout, so that
won't be a problem, right?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:00.616 A:middle
to using auto layout, so that
won't be a problem, right?

00:30:04.926 --> 00:30:07.406 A:middle
So in a split view
controller today on Mavericks

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:12.136 A:middle
in a split view it
manages two or more views.

00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:13.636 A:middle
It has a divider in there.

00:30:14.386 --> 00:30:17.576 A:middle
And in a split view controller,
logically it's now laid

00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:19.736 A:middle
out like this, in a split
view controller owns.

00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:23.376 A:middle
And in a split view it manages a
collection of split view items.

00:30:23.576 --> 00:30:25.786 A:middle
Those items have some
nice new properties.

00:30:26.086 --> 00:30:29.696 A:middle
And a split view item is
a completely new class

00:30:29.696 --> 00:30:30.376 A:middle
in Yosemite.

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:32.696 A:middle
Of course it has
a view controller,

00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:34.046 A:middle
which will lazily load its view.

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:37.086 A:middle
And you can set property such
as collapse, can't collapse

00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:38.246 A:middle
and the holding priority.

00:30:38.476 --> 00:30:40.876 A:middle
Mike showed you how important
the holding priority is.

00:30:40.876 --> 00:30:46.326 A:middle
These were properties
that you used to have

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:48.946 A:middle
to override the delegate for
split view and be the delegate

00:30:48.946 --> 00:30:49.806 A:middle
for the split view controller.

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:50.866 A:middle
You don't need to
do that anymore.

00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:52.126 A:middle
You can just set
these properties right

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:53.706 A:middle
on the split view item.

00:30:53.766 --> 00:30:55.466 A:middle
So it's a lot easier
to do it that way.

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.476 A:middle
And of course you can create
a default split view item

00:30:58.476 --> 00:30:59.996 A:middle
if you have some
child view controller.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:01.706 --> 00:31:07.536 A:middle
Pro Tip: If you want to
animate a collapsible split,

00:31:08.006 --> 00:31:10.856 A:middle
you use the animator proxy
on the split view item.

00:31:10.856 --> 00:31:13.606 A:middle
So you see split view item
animator, set collapsed yes

00:31:13.606 --> 00:31:17.746 A:middle
or no, and the collapse or
expansion animation will happen

00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:19.836 A:middle
for you in a nice,
animated fashion.

00:31:22.256 --> 00:31:23.656 A:middle
Some additional properties.

00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:25.636 A:middle
Since we manage a
collection of split view items

00:31:25.636 --> 00:31:27.426 A:middle
of course you can get to
the split view items array.

00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:30.686 A:middle
The obligatory add and
certain remove split view item,

00:31:31.286 --> 00:31:34.246 A:middle
and if you have a child view
controller you can find its

00:31:34.246 --> 00:31:37.996 A:middle
associated split view item
by asking split view item

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:38.726 A:middle
for a view controller.

00:31:39.266 --> 00:31:44.706 A:middle
Now that we've taken a look
at a couple of examples

00:31:44.706 --> 00:31:47.086 A:middle
that we're doing in
AppKit, I want to point out

00:31:47.086 --> 00:31:49.416 A:middle
and stress the pattern
we're using here.

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:52.086 A:middle
And this is the pattern that
we think you should use as well

00:31:52.086 --> 00:31:54.286 A:middle
if you find the need to write
your own containment style

00:31:54.286 --> 00:31:55.106 A:middle
of view controllers.

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:57.986 A:middle
There's your containment
view controller that's going

00:31:57.986 --> 00:31:59.336 A:middle
to manage some collection
of items

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
so those items can have the
specific information associated


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
so those items can have the
specific information associated

00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:02.036 A:middle
with that.

00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:05.226 A:middle
The item will go ahead
and own a view controller

00:32:05.226 --> 00:32:07.196 A:middle
that will then be able
to lazily load the view.

00:32:07.646 --> 00:32:09.996 A:middle
If you're familiar with iOS,
this is a little different

00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:13.226 A:middle
than iOS, where iOS you
have to have a special type

00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:15.086 A:middle
of view controller
subclass that then may

00:32:15.086 --> 00:32:17.646 A:middle
or may not own a
special type of item.

00:32:18.296 --> 00:32:21.016 A:middle
We've inverted that
on OS X Yosemite,

00:32:21.016 --> 00:32:22.856 A:middle
and one of the reasons is

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:25.326 A:middle
that now your child view
controllers can be a lot

00:32:25.326 --> 00:32:26.096 A:middle
more generic.

00:32:26.496 --> 00:32:31.206 A:middle
And this is the pattern that
we're using on OS X Yosemite

00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:33.126 A:middle
and the pattern we
suggest you follow as well.

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:39.706 A:middle
There are some generic container
API with view controllers

00:32:39.706 --> 00:32:42.346 A:middle
that are exposed at the
NSViewController level.

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:45.576 A:middle
You can get an array of child
view controllers and add-ins

00:32:45.576 --> 00:32:47.016 A:middle
or remove child view
controllers.

00:32:48.136 --> 00:32:52.106 A:middle
But these APIs only manage
the collection itself.

00:32:52.506 --> 00:32:55.516 A:middle
It's up to the subclass to
know what to do with them.

00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:58.216 A:middle
Like tab view controller will
go ahead and create another tab,

00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.196 A:middle
but won't show the views
or load the views yet,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.196 A:middle
but won't show the views
or load the views yet,

00:33:00.386 --> 00:33:01.856 A:middle
where split view
controller will go ahead

00:33:01.856 --> 00:33:03.526 A:middle
and immediately add
it as another split.

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:06.936 A:middle
So it becomes important
to do the right thing

00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:08.326 A:middle
in your subclass there.

00:33:09.156 --> 00:33:13.466 A:middle
But now, with these generic
APIs, you can dig down and look

00:33:13.466 --> 00:33:15.006 A:middle
at the child view
controllers associated

00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:15.846 A:middle
with the view controller.

00:33:16.106 --> 00:33:18.436 A:middle
Or if you have a child view
controller, you can go back up

00:33:18.656 --> 00:33:21.966 A:middle
and find its parent and as a
child view controller you can

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:24.686 A:middle
just call on it, remove
from parent view controller,

00:33:24.916 --> 00:33:25.996 A:middle
and that's the easiest way

00:33:26.326 --> 00:33:30.236 A:middle
to take apart the
parent/child relationship there.

00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:35.586 A:middle
In view controller we have
this method transition

00:33:35.636 --> 00:33:37.186 A:middle
from view controller
to view controller,

00:33:37.566 --> 00:33:40.016 A:middle
which will do a nice animated
transition on your behalf.

00:33:40.266 --> 00:33:42.906 A:middle
This is what we have
with tab view controller

00:33:42.906 --> 00:33:44.326 A:middle
so it's the exact same options.

00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:47.666 A:middle
You can do none with a crossfade
or slide in various directions.

00:33:48.156 --> 00:33:51.586 A:middle
And that's containment
in view controllers.

00:33:54.596 --> 00:33:56.506 A:middle
There's another type
of relationship

00:33:56.506 --> 00:33:57.606 A:middle
with view controllers

00:33:57.606 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
and storyboards called
triggered segues.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.606 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
and storyboards called
triggered segues.

00:34:04.176 --> 00:34:06.916 A:middle
These triggered segues
perform a presentation.

00:34:06.976 --> 00:34:10.565 A:middle
And a presentation needs to have
an identifier so we can find it

00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:12.186 A:middle
in a storyboard if
needed manually.

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:15.156 A:middle
And it's to have some
source view controller.

00:34:15.496 --> 00:34:17.826 A:middle
For example, the
canvas view controller

00:34:17.826 --> 00:34:20.585 A:middle
in this case is our source
to do our shape picker popup.

00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:23.516 A:middle
A destination controller,
which is going

00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:27.045 A:middle
to be our shape picker
controller, and then a style.

00:34:27.255 --> 00:34:28.565 A:middle
And as we did in the demo,

00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:33.565 A:middle
the segue style was a
popover and this was a segue.

00:34:33.565 --> 00:34:35.366 A:middle
Depending on the style,

00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:37.206 A:middle
there might be some other
attributes you need to set up.

00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:40.696 A:middle
For example, with a popover you
need to set up the anchor view.

00:34:40.866 --> 00:34:43.315 A:middle
Since we had dragged it
directly from the Plus button,

00:34:43.636 --> 00:34:45.536 A:middle
the anchor view was
wired up automatically,

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:46.896 A:middle
but you could actually go in IB

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:48.916 A:middle
and set the anchor
view for the popover.

00:34:49.275 --> 00:34:52.436 A:middle
As Mike pointed out,
the one line of code

00:34:52.436 --> 00:34:55.025 A:middle
that you really need to write
in the source view controller --

00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:56.815 A:middle
so in this case our
canvas view controller --

00:34:56.896 --> 00:34:58.576 A:middle
in your source view
controller you need

00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
to override Prepare For Segue.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
to override Prepare For Segue.

00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:04.246 A:middle
From the segue you can get
the identifier, so if you have

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:06.896 A:middle
to deal with more than one
segue you can switch on that,

00:35:07.456 --> 00:35:11.166 A:middle
get the destination controller
and wire up anything that needs

00:35:11.166 --> 00:35:13.236 A:middle
to be wired up so that you
can have the proper lines

00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:16.206 A:middle
of communication or you can get
to the right model data objects

00:35:16.206 --> 00:35:19.376 A:middle
and show the UI with
the correct information.

00:35:19.886 --> 00:35:23.276 A:middle
Often, this is the
represented object

00:35:23.276 --> 00:35:25.376 A:middle
and you can just set the
destination controller

00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:26.836 A:middle
that represented object
to the right thing.

00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:31.966 A:middle
There are a couple of
additional segue APIs

00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:35.046 A:middle
that you might find
useful: shape perform segue

00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:36.226 A:middle
with identifier sender.

00:35:36.226 --> 00:35:40.016 A:middle
This will give you
a chance to step in

00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:43.306 A:middle
and dynamically prevent a segue
from performing if you need

00:35:43.306 --> 00:35:44.526 A:middle
to determine that pretty late.

00:35:44.966 --> 00:35:47.546 A:middle
And if you determine that
here, we will stop the segue

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:49.046 A:middle
from really getting
off the ground.

00:35:50.876 --> 00:35:53.866 A:middle
Then you can call perform
segue with identifier,

00:35:53.936 --> 00:35:58.766 A:middle
identifier sender and we will
find the segue in the storyboard

00:35:58.766 --> 00:36:02.906 A:middle
for you and call perform,
which will flow back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.766 --> 00:36:02.906 A:middle
for you and call perform,
which will flow back

00:36:03.096 --> 00:36:05.036 A:middle
through shape perform
segue with identifier

00:36:05.036 --> 00:36:07.826 A:middle
and of course call prepare
for segue and you could wire

00:36:07.826 --> 00:36:08.856 A:middle
up the represented object.

00:36:08.856 --> 00:36:13.016 A:middle
If you get nothing else out
of this whole talk today,

00:36:13.116 --> 00:36:18.206 A:middle
it's with your segues you need
to implement Prepare For Segue

00:36:18.206 --> 00:36:21.346 A:middle
in the source controller, wire
up your represented object

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:24.416 A:middle
or whatever pieces of
information that you need

00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:29.676 A:middle
to bridge between the two,
and then let the segue happen.

00:36:29.716 --> 00:36:33.296 A:middle
Using Interface Builder
to wire up your segues

00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:35.496 A:middle
and do it all visually,
it's the easiest way to go.

00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:36.656 A:middle
It's our recommended approach.

00:36:37.746 --> 00:36:39.366 A:middle
We can take apart the
engine a little bit more

00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:42.076 A:middle
and we could look at the
manual API that's going

00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:44.046 A:middle
on under the hood that you
can also call directly.

00:36:44.046 --> 00:36:45.886 A:middle
So we're going ahead and
we're exposing this API.

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.826 A:middle
You can ask source
view controller

00:36:48.826 --> 00:36:50.966 A:middle
to present some other
controller as a sheet,

00:36:51.446 --> 00:36:54.006 A:middle
as a modal window,
or as a popover.

00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:59.026 A:middle
And as the destination
controller, the sheet

00:36:59.026 --> 00:37:00.826 A:middle
or the modal window,
the controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.026 --> 00:37:00.826 A:middle
or the modal window,
the controller

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:04.156 A:middle
that is being presented,
you dismiss yourself

00:37:04.156 --> 00:37:05.576 A:middle
by calling dismiss controller

00:37:05.846 --> 00:37:10.126 A:middle
and AppKit will do whatever the
appropriate thing to do there is

00:37:10.126 --> 00:37:12.556 A:middle
and dismiss the controller
for you.

00:37:12.996 --> 00:37:14.576 A:middle
This is incredibly powerful

00:37:14.576 --> 00:37:16.906 A:middle
because it allows your
destination controllers

00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:19.316 A:middle
to be a lot more
modular and reusable.

00:37:19.976 --> 00:37:25.626 A:middle
For example, when Mike and I
were first doing this project

00:37:25.626 --> 00:37:27.276 A:middle
in IB, it was like,
"Oh," you know,

00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:28.286 A:middle
"sheet's the first
thing in there.

00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:30.536 A:middle
We need to have our picker
come down as a sheet."

00:37:31.046 --> 00:37:33.476 A:middle
And we wired up present
view controller

00:37:33.476 --> 00:37:35.526 A:middle
as sheet, and that was easy.

00:37:35.526 --> 00:37:40.346 A:middle
Then we said, "No, no, it'll
look much nicer as a popover.

00:37:40.346 --> 00:37:40.986 A:middle
That'd be cool, yeah."

00:37:41.806 --> 00:37:44.796 A:middle
So the only thing we had to
change was the segue type

00:37:44.866 --> 00:37:46.986 A:middle
to present it as a popover.

00:37:46.986 --> 00:37:49.806 A:middle
Our destination controller just
calls it dismiss controller.

00:37:49.806 --> 00:37:52.666 A:middle
It didn't need to know
how to dismiss a popover

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:54.916 A:middle
or that dismissing a sheet

00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:57.516 A:middle
in raw code is actually
dramatically different.

00:37:57.916 --> 00:38:00.256 A:middle
Just go ahead and let
NSViewController handle


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.916 --> 00:38:00.256 A:middle
Just go ahead and let
NSViewController handle

00:38:00.256 --> 00:38:02.676 A:middle
that on your behalf and it'll
do the appropriate thing.

00:38:03.216 --> 00:38:08.826 A:middle
We can actually go yet
one more level deeper,

00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:12.336 A:middle
and there's at the
lowest level present view

00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:13.716 A:middle
controller animator.

00:38:13.856 --> 00:38:17.766 A:middle
And there is a view controller
presentation animator protocol,

00:38:17.886 --> 00:38:21.136 A:middle
and we're publishing
this as well in Yosemite.

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:24.296 A:middle
So you can create your own
presentation animator object,

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:26.946 A:middle
implement the protocol, which
is just these two methods,

00:38:27.486 --> 00:38:30.016 A:middle
animate presentation of view
controller from view controller.

00:38:30.606 --> 00:38:34.396 A:middle
So when you do a presentation,
we will take the instance

00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:37.516 A:middle
of your animator object,
called animate presentation

00:38:37.516 --> 00:38:38.896 A:middle
of view controller
from view controller,

00:38:39.196 --> 00:38:41.516 A:middle
and then you can handle the
animation however you want.

00:38:41.916 --> 00:38:46.306 A:middle
Once the user is finished and
dismiss controller is called,

00:38:46.306 --> 00:38:48.226 A:middle
it will bubble up
to the right place.

00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:50.856 A:middle
We will take that same
instance that we had before.

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:51.586 A:middle
We've stashed it.

00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:53.326 A:middle
We will call animate dismissal.

00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:55.916 A:middle
The animate dismissal view
controller from view controller.

00:38:56.256 --> 00:38:59.076 A:middle
You're now responsible for doing
any dismissal animation however

00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:04.136 A:middle
you see fit, and once we return
from that we will go ahead


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:04.136 A:middle
you see fit, and once we return
from that we will go ahead

00:39:04.296 --> 00:39:05.996 A:middle
and release the animator object.

00:39:08.816 --> 00:39:10.086 A:middle
So that's view controllers.

00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:12.136 A:middle
There's a lot of new
API in view controllers.

00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:14.056 A:middle
It's really powerful.

00:39:14.286 --> 00:39:16.456 A:middle
We can't wait to see what
you are going to do with it.

00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:17.696 A:middle
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:39:18.766 --> 00:39:19.636 A:middle
So let's move forward and talk

00:39:19.636 --> 00:39:22.256 A:middle
about window controllers a
little bit and how they fit

00:39:22.256 --> 00:39:26.206 A:middle
in with this large
collection of view controllers

00:39:26.206 --> 00:39:27.886 A:middle
that we're going to be
adding to our applications.

00:39:29.256 --> 00:39:30.496 A:middle
So let's just look at some

00:39:30.496 --> 00:39:32.196 A:middle
of the new API we have
in window controller.

00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:33.096 A:middle
There's just a little bit.

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:36.486 A:middle
Namely, there is a
content view controller,

00:39:36.776 --> 00:39:38.076 A:middle
and this is a requirement.

00:39:38.486 --> 00:39:40.876 A:middle
And when you're wiring up your
storyboard, you need to set

00:39:40.876 --> 00:39:43.776 A:middle
up a content view controller
to your window controller.

00:39:44.606 --> 00:39:48.146 A:middle
NSWindow also has a content view
controller property that's new

00:39:48.146 --> 00:39:48.476 A:middle
on it.

00:39:48.936 --> 00:39:51.576 A:middle
And what happens is when window
controller lazily loads the

00:39:51.576 --> 00:39:54.326 A:middle
window, it sets the windows
content view controller

00:39:54.326 --> 00:39:55.796 A:middle
to be the content
view controller

00:39:56.456 --> 00:39:58.966 A:middle
that the window controller
has associated with it.

00:39:59.466 --> 00:40:02.276 A:middle
Of course, like view controller,
you can also get the storyboard


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.466 --> 00:40:02.276 A:middle
Of course, like view controller,
you can also get the storyboard

00:40:02.276 --> 00:40:03.536 A:middle
that loaded the window
controller,

00:40:03.536 --> 00:40:04.906 A:middle
if one loaded the
window controller,

00:40:04.906 --> 00:40:08.256 A:middle
or it will return nil if your
window controller wasn't loaded

00:40:08.256 --> 00:40:09.106 A:middle
from a storyboard.

00:40:09.926 --> 00:40:11.966 A:middle
And of course window
controllers,

00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:14.066 A:middle
like view controllers,
can be presented

00:40:14.256 --> 00:40:15.886 A:middle
and you can call
dismiss controller

00:40:15.886 --> 00:40:18.376 A:middle
on the window controller and
the right dismissal will happen.

00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:25.006 A:middle
NSWindowController also
implements the segue protocol

00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:29.866 A:middle
so that it can prepare for
segue and you can override that.

00:40:30.256 --> 00:40:32.736 A:middle
You can ask it to perform
a segue with an identifier,

00:40:33.186 --> 00:40:35.806 A:middle
and you can of course
override Should Perform Segue

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:40.266 A:middle
to do dynamic suppression
in rare instances.

00:40:43.116 --> 00:40:46.546 A:middle
But what really does a window
controller responsible for now?

00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:48.336 A:middle
Because we have these
view controllers

00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:50.866 A:middle
and all your logic is leveling
way down in view controller.

00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:53.516 A:middle
So your window controller
should just manage the window,

00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:55.536 A:middle
you know, things like
should I really close

00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:56.766 A:middle
when the Close button
was pressed?

00:40:57.206 --> 00:40:59.016 A:middle
Manage the titlebar
and the toolbar,

00:40:59.016 --> 00:41:01.606 A:middle
make sure that has the
appropriate look there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.016 --> 00:41:01.606 A:middle
make sure that has the
appropriate look there.

00:41:02.956 --> 00:41:04.476 A:middle
Manage the content
view controller.

00:41:04.476 --> 00:41:05.926 A:middle
We're going to have a
content in the window,

00:41:05.926 --> 00:41:10.666 A:middle
the window controller's going
to go ahead and manage that.

00:41:10.796 --> 00:41:13.846 A:middle
Window controllers over
time has become a place

00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:16.106 A:middle
where you put a lot
of view logic.

00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:21.406 A:middle
It was a convenient place to
put view logic for various parts

00:41:21.406 --> 00:41:22.936 A:middle
of your user interface.

00:41:23.366 --> 00:41:25.476 A:middle
But now that we have
view controllers

00:41:25.476 --> 00:41:27.866 A:middle
and a specified parent/child
relationship

00:41:27.866 --> 00:41:30.726 A:middle
and a hierarchy here with
segues, you can move all

00:41:30.726 --> 00:41:34.406 A:middle
of that unrelated logic
down to their appropriate

00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:35.246 A:middle
view controllers.

00:41:35.346 --> 00:41:36.876 A:middle
And now you have
a few controllers

00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:38.646 A:middle
which are reusable modules,

00:41:39.046 --> 00:41:41.716 A:middle
and they're more cohesive,
independent modules.

00:41:42.016 --> 00:41:46.576 A:middle
And you don't have unrelated
code in your window controller

00:41:46.576 --> 00:41:47.496 A:middle
that you don't need anymore.

00:41:47.496 --> 00:41:49.186 A:middle
So your window controller
is a lot smaller

00:41:49.536 --> 00:41:51.086 A:middle
and is a lot more
readable and maintainable.

00:41:51.246 --> 00:41:54.396 A:middle
So that's window controllers.

00:41:54.726 --> 00:41:57.896 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit
about gesture recognizers.

00:41:58.176 --> 00:41:59.956 A:middle
I'm really excited about
gesture recognizers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.146 --> 00:42:04.906 A:middle
I'm an event guy at heart, so I
like to play around with events.

00:42:05.566 --> 00:42:09.776 A:middle
So we're introducing gesture
recognizers to OS X Yosemite.

00:42:09.776 --> 00:42:15.856 A:middle
The API is nearly identical
to what it is on iOS.

00:42:16.486 --> 00:42:17.396 A:middle
They're a lot of fun.

00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:21.386 A:middle
But when you're looking
at it on the desktop,

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.476 A:middle
most gestures aren't
determined the same way

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.566 A:middle
that they are on iOS.

00:42:26.566 --> 00:42:28.326 A:middle
On iOS, you have to
look at the raw touches

00:42:28.326 --> 00:42:29.596 A:middle
and figure out what that means.

00:42:29.636 --> 00:42:33.136 A:middle
If you do a pinch gesture
on the trackpad on OS X,

00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:36.686 A:middle
the trackpad itself recognizes
that as a magnification

00:42:36.816 --> 00:42:38.506 A:middle
and it sends magnification
events.

00:42:38.506 --> 00:42:40.506 A:middle
So you don't have
to figure that out.

00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:44.366 A:middle
But not everything
that we can recognize

00:42:44.366 --> 00:42:48.456 A:middle
as a gesture is prerecognized
for us at the lower levels.

00:42:49.216 --> 00:42:51.286 A:middle
For example, what is a click?

00:42:52.506 --> 00:42:54.946 A:middle
You press on the
trackpad, which is going

00:42:54.946 --> 00:42:57.846 A:middle
to emulate a mouse event,
or you press a mouse button,

00:42:57.846 --> 00:43:00.746 A:middle
you get a mouse down event
followed by a mouse up event


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:57.846 --> 00:43:00.746 A:middle
you get a mouse down event
followed by a mouse up event

00:43:00.746 --> 00:43:02.126 A:middle
without any drags in between.

00:43:02.456 --> 00:43:05.476 A:middle
So this is some different
events, and we can look

00:43:05.476 --> 00:43:08.376 A:middle
at them all together
and combine them for you

00:43:08.376 --> 00:43:09.476 A:middle
and go, "Oh, that's a click."

00:43:09.866 --> 00:43:11.026 A:middle
So we can recognize a click.

00:43:12.036 --> 00:43:14.636 A:middle
We can recognize that
independently and differently

00:43:14.636 --> 00:43:17.476 A:middle
than something that's a
click, a drag, and a release;

00:43:17.726 --> 00:43:18.666 A:middle
that's something else.

00:43:19.956 --> 00:43:22.526 A:middle
NSGestureRecognizer
is really good

00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:24.896 A:middle
in helping you disambiguate
user input.

00:43:25.456 --> 00:43:29.996 A:middle
How good? Well, this is code
that you might've had to write

00:43:29.996 --> 00:43:31.476 A:middle
if you had to figure
it out yourself.

00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:37.386 A:middle
This is seven tracking
loops deep of [inaudible].

00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:41.186 A:middle
And what this code is
trying to do is figure

00:43:41.186 --> 00:43:43.716 A:middle
out is this a click,
a double click,

00:43:43.716 --> 00:43:45.106 A:middle
a triple click, or a drag?

00:43:45.106 --> 00:43:46.696 A:middle
And it's trying to
sort all of this out

00:43:46.696 --> 00:43:49.256 A:middle
and all the logic that's
associated with it.

00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:51.336 A:middle
Gesture recognizers
clean this all up

00:43:51.926 --> 00:43:54.826 A:middle
and make it much more simpler
to disambiguate the user input,

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.906 A:middle
gives you hooks to tap
into there when you need

00:43:56.906 --> 00:44:00.476 A:middle
to add some custom logic, and
it's much easier to maintain.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:56.906 --> 00:44:00.476 A:middle
to add some custom logic, and
it's much easier to maintain.

00:44:03.096 --> 00:44:05.906 A:middle
Gesture recognizers are a really
good fit for view controllers.

00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:09.406 A:middle
You really don't want to
have to override mouse

00:44:09.406 --> 00:44:10.796 A:middle
down in your view controller.

00:44:10.796 --> 00:44:12.586 A:middle
That's not something your
view controller should really

00:44:12.586 --> 00:44:13.706 A:middle
be doing.

00:44:13.706 --> 00:44:16.296 A:middle
And when you go to read your
code in your view controller,

00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:17.906 A:middle
you're going to see mouse down
and you're going to have to try

00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:20.216 A:middle
and figure out with
comments or by really looking

00:44:20.216 --> 00:44:23.866 A:middle
at the code what is this
mouse down trying to do.

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:25.926 A:middle
View controllers have
a target action pair.

00:44:26.286 --> 00:44:28.846 A:middle
It will recognize the full
click or the full drag for you,

00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:30.626 A:middle
and now you can wire
that up to an action

00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:31.526 A:middle
in your view controller.

00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:32.626 A:middle
So instead of having mouse

00:44:32.626 --> 00:44:36.666 A:middle
down you have Select
or you have Drag.

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:38.896 A:middle
And it's now obvious
in your code.

00:44:38.896 --> 00:44:40.686 A:middle
It's much more readable
on what to do

00:44:41.026 --> 00:44:42.636 A:middle
and it's partitioned out better.

00:44:43.036 --> 00:44:44.186 A:middle
Much more maintainable code.

00:44:45.656 --> 00:44:47.776 A:middle
Here's an example of
using gesture recognizers

00:44:47.776 --> 00:44:48.756 A:middle
in place with code.

00:44:49.626 --> 00:44:51.866 A:middle
This is alloc initting
a magnification

00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:52.736 A:middle
gesture recognizer.

00:44:52.736 --> 00:44:54.346 A:middle
You init the target
in the action.

00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:57.816 A:middle
I want to point out a slight
difference here from iOS.

00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:00.236 A:middle
On OS X, all of our controls


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:00.236 A:middle
On OS X, all of our controls

00:45:00.236 --> 00:45:02.586 A:middle
and our menus have a
single target action pair.

00:45:02.806 --> 00:45:03.916 A:middle
That's the pair down we use.

00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:05.316 A:middle
That's the pair down
we're continuing to use

00:45:05.316 --> 00:45:06.626 A:middle
with NSGestureRecognizer.

00:45:06.936 --> 00:45:08.426 A:middle
That's a little bit
different than iOS.

00:45:09.486 --> 00:45:12.496 A:middle
Once you have your gesture
recognize alloc initted,

00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:15.526 A:middle
you go ahead and
set it on some view.

00:45:15.736 --> 00:45:17.566 A:middle
Gesture recognizers need
to be attached to a view

00:45:17.566 --> 00:45:18.826 A:middle
and recognized for that view.

00:45:19.906 --> 00:45:22.066 A:middle
Optionally, you may
need to set the delegate

00:45:22.066 --> 00:45:24.376 A:middle
of your gesture recognizer
to your view controller.

00:45:24.376 --> 00:45:26.076 A:middle
Perhaps you need to
set up some more logic

00:45:26.076 --> 00:45:27.526 A:middle
to help disambiguate
some things.

00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:32.166 A:middle
Then you implement your action
method, Magnify in this case.

00:45:32.346 --> 00:45:33.776 A:middle
The sender of the
action method is going

00:45:33.776 --> 00:45:34.936 A:middle
to be the gesture recognizer.

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.976 A:middle
And you'll probably want
to switch off the state.

00:45:38.716 --> 00:45:42.566 A:middle
So for Magnify you'll look
at it started, it began,

00:45:42.566 --> 00:45:43.856 A:middle
you set up some initial state.

00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:46.326 A:middle
You do your magnification
during the changes,

00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:48.376 A:middle
and when it finally
ends, you go ahead

00:45:48.376 --> 00:45:52.096 A:middle
and you commit your
changes to your data model.

00:45:52.366 --> 00:45:54.476 A:middle
That way, with this
commit, when you do undo,

00:45:54.476 --> 00:45:55.986 A:middle
you'll just get one undo instead

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.486 A:middle
of just part of the
magnification.

00:45:58.296 --> 00:46:01.626 A:middle
Something like a click,
there is another state


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:58.296 --> 00:46:01.626 A:middle
Something like a click,
there is another state

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:03.416 A:middle
which is just recognized.

00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:06.016 A:middle
So if there's not a recognizer
that goes through begin, change,

00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:10.356 A:middle
ended because it's just a
single collection like a click,

00:46:10.356 --> 00:46:12.776 A:middle
you could just check
the recognize state.

00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:16.206 A:middle
The gesture recognizer
that we're exposing

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:20.186 A:middle
in Yosemite are the
Click gesture recognizer.

00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:21.956 A:middle
This is a mouse down and up.

00:46:21.956 --> 00:46:25.206 A:middle
You can set which button
to recognize or even chord

00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:26.376 A:middle
of buttons to recognize.

00:46:26.966 --> 00:46:28.596 A:middle
There's the pan gesture
recognizer,

00:46:29.116 --> 00:46:32.776 A:middle
which is a mouse button
down, drag and release.

00:46:33.476 --> 00:46:38.446 A:middle
And this is very similar to the
pan gesture recognizer on iOS,

00:46:38.486 --> 00:46:41.336 A:middle
but on iOS, it's a
touch, move and release.

00:46:41.676 --> 00:46:42.576 A:middle
And the equivalent of that

00:46:42.576 --> 00:46:44.126 A:middle
on the desktop is
obviously the mouse:

00:46:44.666 --> 00:46:45.906 A:middle
mouse down, move, release.

00:46:46.296 --> 00:46:47.696 A:middle
And just like click
gesture recognizer,

00:46:47.696 --> 00:46:52.376 A:middle
you can set which button to
recognize or chord of buttons.

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:54.236 A:middle
There's a press gesture
recognizer,

00:46:54.236 --> 00:46:55.966 A:middle
which is holding
the mouse button

00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:57.796 A:middle
down with a time component.

00:46:58.396 --> 00:47:01.296 A:middle
So a long press is another
way that we've said it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.396 --> 00:47:01.296 A:middle
So a long press is another
way that we've said it,

00:47:01.656 --> 00:47:03.126 A:middle
but an NS Press Gesture
Recognizer,

00:47:03.686 --> 00:47:04.816 A:middle
click with the time component.

00:47:05.306 --> 00:47:08.296 A:middle
And then we have
magnification gesture recognizer

00:47:08.296 --> 00:47:09.686 A:middle
and rotation gesture recognizer.

00:47:10.116 --> 00:47:12.676 A:middle
I mentioned earlier
that magnification

00:47:12.676 --> 00:47:14.876 A:middle
and rotation are
already recognized for us

00:47:14.876 --> 00:47:16.466 A:middle
at the hardware level.

00:47:17.076 --> 00:47:20.856 A:middle
And that's true, but they can
still be bundled up inside

00:47:20.856 --> 00:47:25.386 A:middle
of gesture recognizer so that
you can get this nice target

00:47:25.886 --> 00:47:31.016 A:middle
action association with it and
it continues to fit in the model

00:47:31.016 --> 00:47:33.406 A:middle
with these other gesture
recognizers in your application

00:47:33.406 --> 00:47:37.156 A:middle
so you have a consistent use
of gestures inside your app.

00:47:37.596 --> 00:47:40.136 A:middle
And of course you can
also set the magnification

00:47:40.136 --> 00:47:43.106 A:middle
and rotation gesture
recognizers to work

00:47:43.666 --> 00:47:46.656 A:middle
at the same time simultaneously,
or you can have them where, no,

00:47:46.656 --> 00:47:48.746 A:middle
I only want to recognize
magnifications

00:47:48.746 --> 00:47:50.406 A:middle
or rotations one at a time.

00:47:50.906 --> 00:47:53.496 A:middle
So you can wire those up
with your various properties.

00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:58.616 A:middle
I do want to make one quick
aside on magnification

00:47:58.616 --> 00:47:59.996 A:middle
and rotation gestures.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:03.266 A:middle
The raw event, the magnification
and rotation events,

00:48:03.436 --> 00:48:05.956 A:middle
we've added the phase
property to those events,

00:48:06.196 --> 00:48:09.646 A:middle
so the events also
have a begin, changed,

00:48:09.646 --> 00:48:11.556 A:middle
and ended phases
associated with them.

00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:13.506 A:middle
So if you're looking
at the raw events,

00:48:13.506 --> 00:48:16.686 A:middle
you can determine there
are phases right there.

00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:20.286 A:middle
Event flow is really important
with gesture recognizers.

00:48:20.766 --> 00:48:24.876 A:middle
Let's look at mouse
press for an example.

00:48:24.876 --> 00:48:27.666 A:middle
In Mavericks it would work
like this: Mouse press goes

00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:29.306 A:middle
through NS Application
send event,

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.286 A:middle
and if it doesn't
get consumed there,

00:48:31.706 --> 00:48:32.816 A:middle
send event will send it off

00:48:32.816 --> 00:48:34.606 A:middle
to the event observers,
if there are any.

00:48:34.606 --> 00:48:37.616 A:middle
If the event observers don't
consume it, it will flow back

00:48:37.616 --> 00:48:40.286 A:middle
up to send event and send
event will send it off

00:48:40.286 --> 00:48:41.286 A:middle
to the appropriate window.

00:48:42.706 --> 00:48:45.006 A:middle
That window send event
method is called.

00:48:45.006 --> 00:48:47.556 A:middle
It looks at the event and
figures out via hit testing

00:48:47.556 --> 00:48:48.706 A:middle
which view to send it to.

00:48:49.036 --> 00:48:50.646 A:middle
That view gets a
mouse down message.

00:48:51.016 --> 00:48:53.966 A:middle
If the view doesn't
consume the mouse down,

00:48:54.066 --> 00:48:56.556 A:middle
it bubbles up through the
responder chain as normal,

00:48:56.896 --> 00:48:58.526 A:middle
and whereas normal now

00:48:58.526 --> 00:49:02.636 A:middle
in Yosemite includes
your view controllers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.526 --> 00:49:02.636 A:middle
in Yosemite includes
your view controllers.

00:49:03.136 --> 00:49:07.266 A:middle
And gesture recognizers
are here.

00:49:07.536 --> 00:49:10.846 A:middle
Once the event is sent to the
window, NS Windows Send Event,

00:49:10.986 --> 00:49:12.936 A:middle
it will do the gesture
recognizing.

00:49:13.296 --> 00:49:15.546 A:middle
You might notice we have some
dashed arrows now instead

00:49:15.546 --> 00:49:17.286 A:middle
of solid arrows, and the reason

00:49:17.286 --> 00:49:19.746 A:middle
for that is gesture
recognizers might delay events.

00:49:20.696 --> 00:49:23.566 A:middle
Gesture recognizers
will take a pan,

00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:24.886 A:middle
for example, which is a drag.

00:49:25.406 --> 00:49:28.226 A:middle
You'll do a mouse down and
it goes, well, I'm not sure

00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:30.166 A:middle
if they're dragging yet or
not and we don't want any

00:49:30.166 --> 00:49:32.856 A:middle
of your other code
to start trying to go

00:49:32.856 --> 00:49:35.596 A:middle
into a tracking loop or do
anything with the down yet.

00:49:35.596 --> 00:49:37.846 A:middle
We want to wait till we know
for sure if it's a drag or not.

00:49:38.496 --> 00:49:40.926 A:middle
And so your gesture
recognizers can delay events.

00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:44.636 A:middle
And if they end up not consuming
them, then they will continue

00:49:44.636 --> 00:49:46.106 A:middle
to flow through the
system as normal.

00:49:46.186 --> 00:49:49.186 A:middle
What's really important
for you to understand

00:49:49.186 --> 00:49:51.256 A:middle
as developers here,
send event is a place

00:49:51.256 --> 00:49:53.976 A:middle
that is often overridden.

00:49:54.226 --> 00:49:57.176 A:middle
If you do override send event
in NS Application or NS Window,

00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.666 A:middle
if you consume events

00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:01.116 A:middle
that gesture recognizers have
already started to process


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:01.116 A:middle
that gesture recognizers have
already started to process

00:50:01.116 --> 00:50:04.036 A:middle
in that sequence, you could
really confuse your gesture

00:50:04.036 --> 00:50:07.766 A:middle
recognizer and then your app
will not work right at all.

00:50:08.146 --> 00:50:10.536 A:middle
So you need to be careful
about that and think about that

00:50:10.536 --> 00:50:11.886 A:middle
when you're using
gesture recognizers.

00:50:12.226 --> 00:50:14.176 A:middle
This also goes for
event observers.

00:50:14.176 --> 00:50:15.366 A:middle
If you add an event observer,

00:50:15.536 --> 00:50:17.986 A:middle
it can consume the events before
the gesture recognizer gets

00:50:17.986 --> 00:50:18.276 A:middle
to them.

00:50:18.556 --> 00:50:21.786 A:middle
And the gesture recognizer
really needs to have all of them

00:50:21.786 --> 00:50:22.996 A:middle
that belong in a
sequence together.

00:50:25.396 --> 00:50:27.796 A:middle
If you want to subclass
gesture recognizer you can.

00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:28.686 A:middle
We fully support that.

00:50:28.686 --> 00:50:31.416 A:middle
Check out the
nsgesturerecognizer.h file.

00:50:31.766 --> 00:50:34.726 A:middle
There's an NS subclass
use category.

00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:36.406 A:middle
This is where we've
put our category

00:50:36.406 --> 00:50:40.206 A:middle
for the additional methods that
subclassers need to worry about.

00:50:40.706 --> 00:50:44.146 A:middle
And you can write a subclass
and recognize a drag wiggle

00:50:44.146 --> 00:50:46.466 A:middle
as whatever you want
to recognize it to be.

00:50:46.516 --> 00:50:49.586 A:middle
I'm not going to go
into details here,

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:52.216 A:middle
so if you want more information,
please come see me at one

00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:54.436 A:middle
of the labs, and I will be
more than happy to talk to you

00:50:54.436 --> 00:50:55.436 A:middle
about gesture recognizers.

00:50:58.786 --> 00:51:01.626 A:middle
So let's put this all together
a little bit, and let's go back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.786 --> 00:51:01.626 A:middle
So let's put this all together
a little bit, and let's go back

00:51:01.626 --> 00:51:05.006 A:middle
to our demo and let's
get that shape to move.

00:51:05.776 --> 00:51:09.896 A:middle
Mike couldn't get the shape
to move, but I think I can.

00:51:10.096 --> 00:51:14.156 A:middle
OK, so we'll run this
again real quick,

00:51:14.386 --> 00:51:17.656 A:middle
make sure we're all right back
in the same spot that we were.

00:51:18.376 --> 00:51:22.106 A:middle
We've added a shape and sure
enough we can't get it to move.

00:51:23.486 --> 00:51:38.016 A:middle
Well, I know that in the canvas
view controller I wrote a select

00:51:38.016 --> 00:51:39.406 A:middle
action method here and a drag

00:51:39.406 --> 00:51:41.476 A:middle
with gesture recognizer
action method here.

00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:45.786 A:middle
So I know that this
stuff exists.

00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:47.646 A:middle
They should be getting
called, so we'll need to figure

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:48.656 A:middle
out why they're not
getting called.

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:52.266 A:middle
And it's, you know, just like I
showed before, you just switch

00:51:52.266 --> 00:51:53.986 A:middle
on the state and you do
what you need to do there.

00:51:54.526 --> 00:51:59.876 A:middle
So let's go back into
our Storyboard and look

00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:01.626 A:middle
at our canvas view controller,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:01.626 A:middle
at our canvas view controller,

00:52:02.226 --> 00:52:04.796 A:middle
and there's the canvas
view controller.

00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:06.266 A:middle
My gesture recognizers
aren't there,

00:52:06.266 --> 00:52:07.596 A:middle
so let's go ahead and add some.

00:52:08.436 --> 00:52:11.066 A:middle
We'll quickly add a
pan gesture recognizer,

00:52:11.186 --> 00:52:16.346 A:middle
and we'll wire the pan gesture
recognizer up to the drag.

00:52:17.126 --> 00:52:22.346 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and add a
magnify gesture recognizer.

00:52:23.626 --> 00:52:24.416 A:middle
There you go.

00:52:26.596 --> 00:52:27.396 A:middle
There we are.

00:52:28.736 --> 00:52:33.236 A:middle
We'll add that and wire
that up to magnify.

00:52:34.276 --> 00:52:36.946 A:middle
And now it should be quite
obvious what code is going

00:52:36.946 --> 00:52:37.576 A:middle
to get run.

00:52:39.016 --> 00:52:45.586 A:middle
We run our app, add a shape,
and now we can drag it.

00:52:45.586 --> 00:52:47.946 A:middle
And we can do a pinch
and resize the shape

00:52:48.326 --> 00:52:49.866 A:middle
and we can add another one.

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.886 A:middle
And they work independently
of each other.

00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:54.476 A:middle
And there we go.

View controllers
backing storyboards,

00:53:08.046 --> 00:53:10.106 A:middle
super-easy to design
your applications now.

00:53:10.866 --> 00:53:13.916 A:middle
Window controllers can
just control your window,

00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:17.606 A:middle
but they also have some nice new
API to work with storyboards.

00:53:18.336 --> 00:53:22.606 A:middle
Wire up your gestures
with gesture recognizers.

00:53:22.956 --> 00:53:24.836 A:middle
It's easier than ever,
it's a lot of fun.

00:53:24.886 --> 00:53:27.476 A:middle
Everything here is really great.

00:53:27.476 --> 00:53:28.796 A:middle
Can't wait to see
what you do with it.

For more information
you could see Jake.

00:53:31.866 --> 00:53:34.606 A:middle
He's over here up in the
front with a nice shirt.

00:53:35.956 --> 00:53:40.416 A:middle
Last night somebody
commented on his shoes,

00:53:40.416 --> 00:53:42.656 A:middle
so I figured I'd comment
on his shirt today.

00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:46.596 A:middle
Check out the "What's New
in OS X" documentation.

00:53:46.906 --> 00:53:50.606 A:middle
We're working like crazy
on the documentation

00:53:50.606 --> 00:53:52.646 A:middle
for View Controller, so
that is going to be coming.

00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.406 A:middle
It's going to be really nice.

00:53:55.676 --> 00:53:58.456 A:middle
Some related sessions,
check out the "What's New

00:53:58.456 --> 00:53:59.216 A:middle
in Interface Builder."

"Creating Modern Cocoa
Apps" on Thursday.

00:54:05.996 --> 00:54:08.756 A:middle
If you're just new to
writing apps on Mac OS X,

00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:11.356 A:middle
modern Cocoa apps will cover
view controllers a little bit,

00:54:11.486 --> 00:54:13.886 A:middle
but they'll cover a lot
of other technologies

00:54:13.886 --> 00:54:16.256 A:middle
that you should be also
implementing in your application

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.376 A:middle
as an OS X application.

00:54:18.896 --> 00:54:21.566 A:middle
So thank you.

00:54:21.566 --> 00:54:22.546 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of
the conference.
