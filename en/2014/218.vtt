[ Applause ]

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:17.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:18.106 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:21.286 A:middle
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.556 A:middle
of Apple's User Experience
Evangelists.

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:28.366 A:middle
Now this session is
not about monetizing.

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:33.846 A:middle
It's about having a great
experience with in-app purchases

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.716 A:middle
because a great experience
is what's going

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:39.966 A:middle
to keep people coming back
to your app or game time

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.836 A:middle
and time and time again.

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:45.616 A:middle
Think about the last time you
had a really fantastic meal

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.726 A:middle
at a great restaurant.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.666 A:middle
So it's a place you always
want to come back to, right?

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:54.376 A:middle
So this is the bigger
picture of what it takes

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.066 A:middle
to have a great experience
with in-app purchases

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
and today's session is all
based on the assumption


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
and today's session is all
based on the assumption

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
that you already have a
really amazing app or game.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:09.636 A:middle
Your app meets the
needs of your audience.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.566 A:middle
It's got a really
intuitive interface design.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.636 A:middle
It's been executed really well.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.326 A:middle
For game, it's just fun to play.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.046 A:middle
And there's really
no design secrets

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.546 A:middle
or shortcuts around this one.

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:23.746 A:middle
But I know that you guys
all have it handled.

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:27.316 A:middle
So we don't have to dwell
on this for too long.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.606 A:middle
Now, if you're using the
freemium or the paymium model

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.456 A:middle
with in-app purchases,
it's so important

00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:37.756 A:middle
that people can enjoy your app
or game without buying anything.

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.866 A:middle
I mean, I think most of us
have had the experience.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.746 A:middle
You get a new app from the
App Store and you download it

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.846 A:middle
and you launch it only to find

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:47.516 A:middle
that you can't do
anything with it.

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:49.476 A:middle
That's frustrating.

00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:51.326 A:middle
You need to make it
a purchase in order

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.866 A:middle
to get some utility out of it.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:57.086 A:middle
It would be like if you bought
a mixer for your kitchen

00:01:57.086 --> 00:01:59.316 A:middle
and it didn't come
with any attachments.

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.166 A:middle
You couldn't mix anything.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.166 A:middle
You couldn't mix anything.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.626 A:middle
That would be really
disappointing.

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:07.546 A:middle
And that's why mixers come
with a basic attachment

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:10.776 A:middle
that you can use to mix and
see how great the mixer is.

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:14.986 A:middle
And then you buy some additional
attachments for specialty tasks

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:17.796 A:middle
like making bread or
some kind of pastry.

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:21.146 A:middle
And that's what you want
to achieve with your apps.

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:24.586 A:middle
You want to let people really
enjoy the functionality

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:28.466 A:middle
and the utility, the
quality of your app,

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.666 A:middle
and then you offer
them advantages

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:34.676 A:middle
or additional functionality,
some advanced features.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:38.226 A:middle
And when you offer those
things, you want to make sure

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:39.766 A:middle
that you make buying easy.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:43.996 A:middle
And I know this probably sounds
obvious but I'm not just talking

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.986 A:middle
about sending the
transaction to the App Store

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.056 A:middle
and getting a response back.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:50.686 A:middle
You want to make sure
that the decision

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:52.906 A:middle
to buy something is really easy

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.816 A:middle
for the people coming
to your app or game.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.896 A:middle
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.896 A:middle
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.456 A:middle
and a lot of it is
outside of your control.

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:08.066 A:middle
But as app developers, you
want to eliminate any obstacle

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:09.306 A:middle
to making that decision

00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:11.356 A:middle
to purchase something
inside of your app.

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:14.976 A:middle
Make it easy as possible
because that decision

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:19.136 A:middle
to buy is a fleeting moment
and there's many traps.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.346 A:middle
So one of the best
things that you can do is

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:25.926 A:middle
to integrate your merchandise
into the experience.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.626 A:middle
I mean, people aren't
going to buy things

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.206 A:middle
if they don't know
what you're offering,

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:31.456 A:middle
if they can't see them.

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:34.146 A:middle
I talk to a lot of developers

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.476 A:middle
who create a really great store
section inside of their app

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.426 A:middle
or game and then they're
really disappointed

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:40.716 A:middle
because no one's going there.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:42.146 A:middle
They're not buying anything.

00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:44.546 A:middle
That's because people don't
know what you're offering.

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:47.046 A:middle
It's kind of like the
difference of if I said,

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.026 A:middle
"Do you want to buy something?"

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:51.936 A:middle
Or if I said, "How would you

00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:53.656 A:middle
like a really great
drawing tool?"

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:58.126 A:middle
And that's what you want to
help explain with your app

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
by putting the merchandise
out on display,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
by putting the merchandise
out on display,

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:02.876 A:middle
integrating it into
the experience.

00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:06.366 A:middle
But when you're doing
that, I'm not suggesting

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.906 A:middle
that you become a pushy
salesperson about it.

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:12.606 A:middle
Nobody wants this guy following
them around saying, "Hey,

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:13.676 A:middle
you want to buy something?

00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:14.706 A:middle
Hey, hey, hey.

00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:15.546 A:middle
You want to buy something?

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.606 A:middle
Do you want to buy something?

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:17.555 A:middle
Do you want to buy something?"

00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:20.296 A:middle
Every minute, and that's
what you're risking

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.276 A:middle
if you're flashing a lot
of alerts or notifications

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:26.486 A:middle
or crazy animations to try and
entice people into that store.

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:29.876 A:middle
It's really about timing.

00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:32.676 A:middle
And with some apps, it's

00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:35.956 A:middle
about offering the right
thing at the right time.

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:39.476 A:middle
Like at a restaurant, when the
waiter brings you the dessert

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:40.556 A:middle
menu at the end of the meal.

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.796 A:middle
I mean, you might not
even want dessert, right,

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:45.706 A:middle
but it doesn't feel pushy
that they offered it.

00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:50.116 A:middle
It would feel pushy if they
offered it to you before you sat

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.766 A:middle
down and while you're
eating your appetizer.

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.136 A:middle
So you want to think about
what's the right moment

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.486 A:middle
to offer something
to someone and do

00:04:58.486 --> 00:04:59.896 A:middle
that in a way that's
really thoughtful.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.196 A:middle
Now with other apps, it's
about the presentation.

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:08.376 A:middle
You want to think about a
really great window display

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.206 A:middle
for a store.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.636 A:middle
I happen to be very partial

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.516 A:middle
to the Apple Retail
window displays.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:15.736 A:middle
I'm sure that will come as
no surprise to you guys.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:18.616 A:middle
Now they do a great job

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:21.306 A:middle
of showing off the
merchandise and drawing you in.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:23.596 A:middle
It makes you want to find
out more about the products.

00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:24.776 A:middle
It's really intriguing.

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.976 A:middle
And that's what you
want to think

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:28.586 A:middle
about with your app
or your game.

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.216 A:middle
You want to integrate
the merchandise in a way

00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:32.756 A:middle
that feels really natural.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:36.736 A:middle
This is Paper by Fifty Three.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.586 A:middle
It's an Apple Design Award
winner from years ago

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.906 A:middle
that is still a fantastic
example

00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:45.396 A:middle
of integrating in-app
purchases into their experience.

00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:49.806 A:middle
If you haven't used it, the app
is designed to capture ideas

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:52.596 A:middle
through sketches and
diagrams and notes.

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:55.656 A:middle
And like that mixer
in your kitchen,

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:58.246 A:middle
they give you some basic
drawing tools for free,

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
your pen and your eraser.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
your pen and your eraser.

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:02.946 A:middle
And you can see from
this example

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.386 A:middle
that you can do tons with it.

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:06.446 A:middle
But there might be an occasion

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.306 A:middle
when you need a more advanced
drawing tool or a different kind

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.746 A:middle
of line or texture and so that's
why they leave these empty spots

00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:16.226 A:middle
here where the advanced
drawing tools should go.

00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:19.626 A:middle
And that's like that
window display in the store.

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.606 A:middle
It's putting them
out for you to see.

00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:24.026 A:middle
There's no question
what's available.

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:27.536 A:middle
What they didn't do
is hide everything

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:30.936 A:middle
in an arts supply store or
tuck it in a pencil case

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
that then you have to go push
open to see what's available.

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:35.186 A:middle
That's creating friction.

00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:38.356 A:middle
That's expecting the
player, or your audience

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.836 A:middle
to do work, to see what's there.

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:44.956 A:middle
And another thing that
they didn't do is trick you

00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:47.106 A:middle
into thinking that you
already owned all these tools.

00:06:47.826 --> 00:06:50.486 A:middle
Because if you could see them
all but then when you tapped

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.666 A:middle
on one to use it, it
told you that you need

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.006 A:middle
to pay money just
to test out a brush?

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.696 A:middle
Well, that would
be disappointing.

00:06:57.056 --> 00:06:58.916 A:middle
That's not a great experience.

00:06:58.916 --> 00:06:59.926 A:middle
It's a frustrating one.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:05.016 A:middle
And that's why this design
is so elegant and so great.

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.876 A:middle
It's informative
but it's not pushy.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:13.346 A:middle
Now next up, let's look at that
timing I mentioned earlier,

00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.176 A:middle
a totally different kind of
app, Bloomberg Businessweek.

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.716 A:middle
And this is a business
publication

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:20.936 A:middle
that has regular
updates, new content.

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:25.366 A:middle
And without a subscription, you
can still browse, read several

00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:27.856 A:middle
of the articles,
browse all the headlines

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.146 A:middle
and the introductory sentences.

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.696 A:middle
Now if you tap on something
that requires a subscription,

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.396 A:middle
they bring up the
subscription options.

00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:39.606 A:middle
It's like the dessert menu.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:42.466 A:middle
You're interested in
reading some of their content

00:07:42.906 --> 00:07:47.686 A:middle
so here's the information about
subscription so you can get it.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:51.776 A:middle
They're presenting it right
at that perfect moment.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
They're making it easy for
you to get the subscription.

00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:01.206 A:middle
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:01.206 A:middle
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here

00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:05.066 A:middle
in the corner of every
screen and that's great too.

00:08:05.746 --> 00:08:07.506 A:middle
But having that in addition

00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:10.226 A:middle
to the integrated message
helps them reach more people.

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:13.616 A:middle
So I'm not saying you
can't have a store section.

00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:15.936 A:middle
You just don't want to
make it the only place

00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.336 A:middle
that people can find
what you're offering.

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:23.036 A:middle
Now this also works for games.

00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:25.456 A:middle
I don't know how many of
you have played "Smash Hit".

00:08:25.556 --> 00:08:29.266 A:middle
It's a really fun arcade game
that involves smashing things

00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:33.086 A:middle
as you might have guessed, very
satisfying after a long day.

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:37.106 A:middle
The way that it works is
that it's an arcade game

00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:39.046 A:middle
and the more accurate you
are at smashing things,

00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:39.956 A:middle
the further you're going to get.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.316 A:middle
You progress through the
checkpoints unlocking them.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
And they also offer a premium
version and they've a great way

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:47.686 A:middle
of illustrating exactly what

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.886 A:middle
that advanced feature
does for you.

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:52.056 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:53.316 A:middle
So here we are.

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.766 A:middle
Let's start from checkpoint 2,

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:56.976 A:middle
maybe I can get a little
bit further this time.

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.626 A:middle
[ Music ]


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[ Music ]

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:03.186 A:middle
Oh, but this requires
the premium version

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:03.976 A:middle
and I'm not ready to buy it.

00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:07.696 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.626 A:middle
Pretty compelling, right?

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:13.006 A:middle
I mean, if you had any doubt
about what that advantage is

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:15.046 A:middle
that they're offering,
that spells it

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:16.186 A:middle
out for you right away.

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.296 A:middle
Now I don't know how
many of you notice

00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:21.336 A:middle
that there's also this
Get Premium button here

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:22.126 A:middle
in the corner.

00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:26.626 A:middle
And if you did, would
you have guessed

00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:28.196 A:middle
that that's what the
premium version meant?

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.866 A:middle
I mean, some of you might
have tapped on it to find out

00:09:31.866 --> 00:09:33.486 A:middle
and some of you may not have.

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.696 A:middle
And they have the details
here about what you get.

00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:38.936 A:middle
But having this in addition

00:09:38.936 --> 00:09:42.936 A:middle
to that integrated message
is just much more effective

00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:46.816 A:middle
at explaining what the feature
does for you and offering it

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.966 A:middle
to you at the time
that you can use it.

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:54.016 A:middle
Just remember, don't
be this guy.

00:09:54.936 --> 00:09:58.636 A:middle
Nobody wants someone pushing
in your face pestering you.

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:02.776 A:middle
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:02.776 A:middle
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.

00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
But thoughtful integration
of the merchandise will.

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:11.916 A:middle
Now another challenge is to
help people understand the value

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:13.026 A:middle
of what you're offering.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:16.076 A:middle
And if you walked
into a clothing store,

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:17.596 A:middle
this is easy to figure out.

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:21.256 A:middle
You can touch the merchandise,
feel what the fabric feels like.

00:10:21.926 --> 00:10:25.076 A:middle
Does it feel luxurious or
does it feel kind of cheap?

00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:26.846 A:middle
Is it well made?

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.186 A:middle
Are the seams are falling apart?

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:30.626 A:middle
Most importantly,
does it fit you?

00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:31.656 A:middle
Does it look good?

00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:33.026 A:middle
Is it going to suit
your purposes?

00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.166 A:middle
So letting people try

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:39.656 A:middle
out merchandise before they buy
it is a really effective way

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:42.636 A:middle
of helping them understand
the quality and the value

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:45.256 A:middle
and the utility of
what you're offering.

00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:48.906 A:middle
I mean, you wouldn't buy
a car without taking it

00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:50.676 A:middle
for a test drive first, right?

00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:52.546 A:middle
It's the same principle.

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:55.796 A:middle
Letting people use it will
be the best way for them

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:57.716 A:middle
to understand how
awesome they are.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.466 A:middle
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.466 A:middle
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.

00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:05.906 A:middle
In addition to providing
a lot of samples

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:08.086 A:middle
of what the tools
are capable of,

00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.726 A:middle
they put together an
entire journal made

00:11:10.726 --> 00:11:13.466 A:middle
by their staff showing
off the different tools

00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.456 A:middle
and their capabilities.

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:17.526 A:middle
And then of course, they
let you use the tools,

00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:18.966 A:middle
the basic tools for free.

00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:22.846 A:middle
And if you haven't used
this app, I can tell you

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:25.326 A:middle
that the tools respond
beautifully to your finger.

00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:29.566 A:middle
Now me telling you that
isn't nearly as effective

00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:33.466 A:middle
as you actually using the app
and so that's why when you go

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.376 A:middle
to find out about these
advanced drawing tools,

00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:36.926 A:middle
they let you test
them out right there.

00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:40.806 A:middle
You've got these sketch pads
along with detailed information

00:11:40.806 --> 00:11:44.976 A:middle
and testing them out is how
you can determine the quality

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:45.776 A:middle
and the utility.

00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:47.826 A:middle
What kind of texture
do they provide?

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:50.146 A:middle
How do they react to your
finger when you're drawing?

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:51.966 A:middle
Which one is going to be right

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:53.246 A:middle
for what you're trying
to achieve?

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.336 A:middle
And each of those sketch
pads has drawings already

00:11:57.336 --> 00:11:58.206 A:middle
in progress.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.276 A:middle
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.276 A:middle
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you

00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
down certain roads to show
you how well the car handles?

00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:07.046 A:middle
Paper by Fifty Three is
setting up the sketchpads

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:09.146 A:middle
to show you the optimal uses

00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:11.376 A:middle
or some suggested
uses for those tools.

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:13.366 A:middle
This one's great at watercolors.

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.376 A:middle
They've set up a
watercolor drawing for you

00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:19.286 A:middle
so then you can jump in and add
on or try your own drawings.

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:24.016 A:middle
And it might seem obvious
to take this approach

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.196 A:middle
with drawing tools but
I promise it will work

00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.136 A:middle
for almost any kind
of virtual good.

00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:31.746 A:middle
Here's a really different
example and that's Line.

00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:34.256 A:middle
So it's a popular messaging app.

00:12:34.256 --> 00:12:37.486 A:middle
You can send and receive
messages for free.

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.836 A:middle
Now one of the things
that differentiates Line

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:44.516 A:middle
from its competitors
is the vast array

00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.476 A:middle
of stickers that they offer.

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:49.276 A:middle
Stickers are kind of
like really crazy Emoji.

00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:52.386 A:middle
You can include them in your
messages and send them back

00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:54.046 A:middle
and forth to your friends.

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:56.146 A:middle
It gives your text
messages a whole new life.

00:12:57.436 --> 00:12:59.866 A:middle
Now Line gives you a
very generous selection

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.036 A:middle
of these stickers for
free so you can try them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.036 A:middle
of these stickers for
free so you can try them

00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:05.106 A:middle
out plus the ability
to earn stickers

00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:06.256 A:middle
without paying anything.

00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:09.556 A:middle
So all you have to do is
add Hello Kitty as a friend

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:10.986 A:middle
and then you get
Hello Kitty stickers.

00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:13.506 A:middle
And some people love
Hello Kitty stickers.

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:20.156 A:middle
And using them really helps you
understand how great they are.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.066 A:middle
Now another thing that
they offer are themes.

00:13:24.686 --> 00:13:27.226 A:middle
And when I first investigated
themes, I'll be honest,

00:13:27.226 --> 00:13:30.106 A:middle
I had no idea what to expect
and I thought, "Oh great,

00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:31.106 A:middle
there's some free ones.

00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:32.516 A:middle
Let me try out the Brown Bear."

00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:34.786 A:middle
Let's see what happens here.

00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.906 A:middle
So when you choose
the Brown Bear theme,

00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:41.916 A:middle
instead of getting the
standard UI, you get bears!

00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:45.236 A:middle
Hurray! Everywhere,
all over the place.

00:13:45.406 --> 00:13:47.606 A:middle
Even the tab bar
icons are bears.

00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:52.636 A:middle
Now, sure they could have put a
description of what a theme is

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:55.286 A:middle
or even a screenshot but that
wouldn't have been nearly

00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:58.706 A:middle
as effective at conveying what
happens when you use the themes.

00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:02.766 A:middle
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:02.766 A:middle
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way

00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:05.606 A:middle
to really understand
what they're all about.

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:09.306 A:middle
And this works for publications.

00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:11.226 A:middle
Does anyone have any
question about where

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.676 A:middle
to get the free preview
content on the screen?

00:14:14.056 --> 00:14:16.496 A:middle
They've made it really
easy for everybody.

00:14:17.896 --> 00:14:21.196 A:middle
"Esquire Magazine" wants
to make sure that you know

00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:22.476 A:middle
that reading their content

00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:25.346 A:middle
on an iPad is the best
experience possible.

00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:28.846 A:middle
And so they give you free
content to check out.

00:14:28.846 --> 00:14:32.766 A:middle
It's got videos, interactivity
and this is the equivalent

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:36.076 A:middle
to standing in line at the store
and flipping through a magazine

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:38.906 A:middle
or going to a comics store
and checking out the artwork.

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:42.356 A:middle
It helps you to really know
whether the reading experience

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:44.366 A:middle
is going to be good and
whether the content's going

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:46.466 A:middle
to be something that
you're interested in.

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.956 A:middle
And again, this also
works for games.

00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
Now, I'm pretty sure
that everyone

00:14:53.566 --> 00:14:56.556 A:middle
in this room has played Candy
Crush Saga at some point

00:14:56.906 --> 00:14:59.506 A:middle
but for the 2 of you who
haven't, it's a puzzle game.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:05.256 A:middle
And they've done okay with
in-app purchases, you know.

00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:07.296 A:middle
So what they do at the
beginning of every level is

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.936 A:middle
that they offer you
these boosters.

00:15:08.936 --> 00:15:13.516 A:middle
And these boosters give you a
leg up on completing the task

00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:15.746 A:middle
and they've become much
more valuable the harder the

00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:16.436 A:middle
puzzle is.

00:15:17.526 --> 00:15:19.856 A:middle
And if you've never used one,
you can just ignore them,

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:23.316 A:middle
go for that big pink play button
and you're into a puzzle game.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.326 A:middle
So that's why they introduced
the Daily Booster Wheel.

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:32.666 A:middle
Every day you can come and get
one of their boosters for free.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:37.306 A:middle
So there is nothing standing in
the way of you trying them out.

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:39.386 A:middle
And once you try them out,

00:15:39.386 --> 00:15:41.656 A:middle
you really know what a
difference that they can make.

00:15:42.326 --> 00:15:46.596 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
offering a test drive.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.066 A:middle
Letting someone really
experience that merchandise,

00:15:50.246 --> 00:15:53.226 A:middle
trying it out before they
buy it, is the best way

00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:57.386 A:middle
to communicate the value and
the usefulness and the quality.

00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:01.036 A:middle
And that's why it's going
to make the decision


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:01.036 A:middle
And that's why it's going
to make the decision

00:16:01.036 --> 00:16:06.056 A:middle
to buy something
easier on people.

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:09.186 A:middle
Now, another way to reduce
the friction to buying is

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:10.366 A:middle
to stick with your theme.

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:14.836 A:middle
It's really important that
every screen in your app

00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:16.556 A:middle
or your game is cohesive.

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:18.196 A:middle
And you want to carry

00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:20.486 A:middle
that visual design
all the way through.

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:22.986 A:middle
That interaction model
needs to be consistent.

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:26.826 A:middle
And you want to put as
much effort and time

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:29.866 A:middle
into designing these screens
as you do anything else

00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:33.176 A:middle
in your app or your game.

00:16:33.176 --> 00:16:36.806 A:middle
So this is Ruzzle Adventure
and it's got hundreds of levels

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:39.366 A:middle
of puzzle games and all
these various theme worlds.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:43.086 A:middle
You start out in the
forest and you work

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.126 A:middle
through the different
puzzles in the forest

00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:46.476 A:middle
to get to other lands.

00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:51.386 A:middle
Now, every aspect of the
forest looks like the forest.

00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:54.456 A:middle
They've got -- it doesn't matter
the objective of the game.

00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:58.086 A:middle
You can see the forest details
creeping in at every corner.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:03.446 A:middle
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:03.446 A:middle
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:06.685 A:middle
which you can use to
then buy advantages

00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:08.935 A:middle
for the different
levels, powerful boosts.

00:17:09.836 --> 00:17:12.476 A:middle
And you can earn the in-app
currency as you're playing

00:17:12.846 --> 00:17:15.996 A:middle
but you can also, of course,
make an in-app purchase

00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
for their in-app currency.

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:20.506 A:middle
So imagine you're up against
Chief Smartypants here

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:21.506 A:middle
and he's tough.

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.996 A:middle
So it might be worth
getting some in-app currency

00:17:25.406 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
so that you can -- so that you
go buy some in-app currency

00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:31.256 A:middle
so you can get some
of those boosters.

00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:32.786 A:middle
So imagine you're excited.

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:34.366 A:middle
You want to beat
Chief Smartypants.

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:36.726 A:middle
But the next screen
you saw was this.

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:39.306 A:middle
It would be terrible, right?

00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:42.886 A:middle
I mean, suddenly there's
an entirely different UI

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:44.426 A:middle
that you have to understand.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.216 A:middle
You got to think about it.

00:17:46.216 --> 00:17:47.866 A:middle
It's really sterile-looking.

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.436 A:middle
It's not very well laid out.

00:17:50.766 --> 00:17:52.476 A:middle
It takes you right
out of the experience.

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:53.816 A:middle
You're not in the
forest anymore.

00:17:54.936 --> 00:17:56.296 A:middle
And that creates friction.

00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:58.156 A:middle
It makes you feel
more like work.

00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.786 A:middle
That's making it
harder to buy something.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.786 A:middle
That's making it
harder to buy something.

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:04.996 A:middle
Now thankfully, Ruzzle
Adventure does not do that.

00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:08.806 A:middle
They have a nice forest
theme purchasing experience

00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:11.656 A:middle
and all the visual design
and interaction is consistent

00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:14.686 A:middle
with everything else
in the game.

00:18:15.936 --> 00:18:19.436 A:middle
So make sure that you
maintain the world of your game

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:22.226 A:middle
or the look of your app
on every single screen

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.956 A:middle
and with every single control.

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:27.436 A:middle
Because when you suddenly
snatch people out of that world

00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:31.246 A:middle
and they have to deal with a
new interface or a new look,

00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:32.596 A:middle
it's going to feel like work.

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:34.196 A:middle
It's going to be hard.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.696 A:middle
And buying, we want
it to be easy, right?

00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:41.676 A:middle
Now just a word of warning
while you are busy sticking

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:44.156 A:middle
with your theme,
don't take it so far

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.046 A:middle
that language becomes confusing.

00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:47.666 A:middle
You want to make sure

00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:50.176 A:middle
that people can really
understand exactly what they're

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:51.336 A:middle
going to be getting
for their money.

00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:53.066 A:middle
You use clear language.

00:18:54.506 --> 00:18:57.226 A:middle
Now have you guys ever seen a
description for an apartment

00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:00.046 A:middle
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:00.046 A:middle
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?

00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:02.836 A:middle
And then you show up
and it's, you know,

00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:03.876 A:middle
it looks more like this.

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:07.436 A:middle
I think we've all
had that experience.

00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:11.696 A:middle
Now with any purchase, it's
so important to be honest.

00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:14.826 A:middle
There is really a fine line
between trying to be positive

00:19:14.826 --> 00:19:16.746 A:middle
about something,
highlighting the features

00:19:16.836 --> 00:19:19.076 A:middle
and really being
overly optimistic

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.156 A:middle
about what you're selling.

00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:23.666 A:middle
Nobody wants to be disappointed

00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:26.636 A:middle
when they see what the
merchandise actually is.

00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:30.306 A:middle
And especially when you're
coming to subscriptions

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:34.396 A:middle
or recurring content, you want
to be as specific as possible.

00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:37.206 A:middle
Set people's expectations
correctly.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.956 A:middle
When are they going
to get new content?

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.216 A:middle
How much content are they
getting for the price?

00:19:42.946 --> 00:19:46.436 A:middle
And if you just saw something
like this, you don't know.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.896 A:middle
Is it expensive or
is it a bargain?

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.026 A:middle
I mean, if it's 12
issues in a year,

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.566 A:middle
that's less than
a dollar an issue.

00:19:54.356 --> 00:19:55.946 A:middle
That's pretty reasonable, right?

00:19:55.946 --> 00:19:59.596 A:middle
But if it's only two
issues, well, I don't know.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.096 --> 00:20:03.116 A:middle
Is that content really
worth that much money to me

00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:05.566 A:middle
and see now, I'm off
thinking about whether

00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:08.146 A:middle
or not this is a purchase
I want to make instead

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:11.466 A:middle
of quickly coming to a decision,
getting the new content

00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:12.766 A:middle
and going off to enjoy it

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:14.816 A:middle
because that's what I've
come to an app to do.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.756 A:middle
I've come to enjoy content.

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:19.226 A:middle
I've come to an app to
help me achieve something.

00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:23.296 A:middle
Jamie Oliver does a much
better job with this.

00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:27.456 A:middle
He's a famous chef and
he has a recipes app.

00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:30.646 A:middle
And you'll see here that
here they let you know

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.206 A:middle
that new content is coming

00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:35.286 A:middle
on the second Wednesday
of every month.

00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:38.156 A:middle
Crystal clear, very specific.

00:20:38.336 --> 00:20:41.456 A:middle
I know exactly when
to expect things.

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:45.926 A:middle
FitStar is a personal
training application

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:49.536 A:middle
and they have a number of
workouts and they're tailored

00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:53.366 A:middle
to your goals and also
your actual performance.

00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:57.856 A:middle
Now their subscription screen
gives you detailed outlines

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:58.746 A:middle
of all the programs.

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:02.276 A:middle
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:02.276 A:middle
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:03.396 A:middle
Do you want something short?

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.536 A:middle
Do you want something long?

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:08.956 A:middle
They are offering both of
those, the advantages of them.

00:21:08.956 --> 00:21:11.596 A:middle
Are you interested in fat
burning or are you trying

00:21:11.596 --> 00:21:12.556 A:middle
to do strength training?

00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:17.126 A:middle
They've even pointed out which
one is recommended for me based

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.946 A:middle
on a couple of questions
I answered earlier.

00:21:19.506 --> 00:21:23.186 A:middle
And when you're ready to
buy that subscription,

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:27.486 A:middle
that screen is so clear about
exactly what you're going

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.606 A:middle
to be getting, all
of the programs,

00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:31.346 A:middle
unlimited free style moves.

00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:34.546 A:middle
And they've even highlighted
the annual subscription

00:21:34.936 --> 00:21:37.206 A:middle
with a discount.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.356 A:middle
They've made it so easy
just through the use

00:21:40.356 --> 00:21:42.956 A:middle
of clear language for
me to make a decision

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:44.046 A:middle
about buying something.

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:47.446 A:middle
And now I really understand
what I'm getting for my money

00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:49.386 A:middle
and I can appreciate it.

00:21:49.946 --> 00:21:53.346 A:middle
Now another way that
you can make this clear

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.876 A:middle
to your audience is to
do the math for them.

00:21:57.106 --> 00:21:58.766 A:middle
I don't like doing math.

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.036 A:middle
That's not fun for me.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.036 A:middle
That's not fun for me.

00:22:00.246 --> 00:22:01.176 A:middle
Don't make me do the math.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.866 A:middle
It's your job as the app
developer to make it easy

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.196 A:middle
on people to make a decision.

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.016 A:middle
So quick, which one of
these is the best value?

00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:14.456 A:middle
I mean, I'm sure some of you can
really quickly calculate this

00:22:14.456 --> 00:22:16.226 A:middle
but most people are
not going to want to.

00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:18.016 A:middle
It's this one, by the way.

00:22:18.996 --> 00:22:22.966 A:middle
And so that's why you really
want to help people understand

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:26.266 A:middle
which is going to be the
most cost effective for them.

00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:27.916 A:middle
This is Lovoo.

00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:31.406 A:middle
It's a dating application and
they offer tons of utility

00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:32.766 A:middle
without a subscription.

00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:36.636 A:middle
You can fill out a
profile, message users.

00:22:36.636 --> 00:22:39.126 A:middle
There's lots of ways to
browse potential suitors,

00:22:39.536 --> 00:22:40.076 A:middle
including this.

00:22:40.076 --> 00:22:41.216 A:middle
This is a radar screen.

00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:42.276 A:middle
That's what you're seeing here.

00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:46.256 A:middle
You can see all the people,
all potential dates around me.

00:22:46.796 --> 00:22:50.876 A:middle
And of course, they have some
premium features that'll help

00:22:50.876 --> 00:22:52.356 A:middle
you get more exposure to people.

00:22:53.196 --> 00:22:57.286 A:middle
And here is how they explain
the subscription options.

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:01.956 A:middle
It's called pennies
a day to find love.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:01.956 A:middle
It's called pennies
a day to find love.

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:04.116 A:middle
Pennies a day to find love!

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.826 A:middle
Who can afford pennies
a day for love?

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.856 A:middle
Now, there's no guesswork here.

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:12.696 A:middle
I know exactly which
subscription is going

00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:14.496 A:middle
to be the lowest cost per day.

00:23:14.806 --> 00:23:15.916 A:middle
But it's really important.

00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:17.756 A:middle
If you're going to
take it to this level,

00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:19.846 A:middle
make sure that you're
still calling

00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:22.286 A:middle
out the total purchase
price because again,

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:24.826 A:middle
we want to be honest and
clear with our language.

00:23:25.306 --> 00:23:28.016 A:middle
People are going to want to
know what they expect to pay.

00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:30.256 A:middle
Don't make them do the
math in reverse, right?

00:23:30.256 --> 00:23:34.796 A:middle
Now, if your app is available
worldwide, I want to make sure

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.516 A:middle
that you localize your currency

00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:38.776 A:middle
because that's a huge
roadblock if you don't.

00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:44.456 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
doing the math for people.

00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:49.746 A:middle
It can be so helpful in
making that decision quickly.

00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:53.816 A:middle
Now, another thing that's really
helpful is showing fewer things.

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.176 A:middle
It's about quality,
not about quantity.

00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.806 A:middle
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.806 A:middle
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:03.236 A:middle
And I don't know how
many of you have heard

00:24:03.236 --> 00:24:04.866 A:middle
of the paradox of choice.

00:24:05.056 --> 00:24:08.176 A:middle
It essentially means that the
more choices that you have,

00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:10.236 A:middle
the harder it is
to make a decision.

00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:13.666 A:middle
And in fact, when
you've too many choices,

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.506 A:middle
that choice overload,
it stresses you out.

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:17.816 A:middle
And what you, people wind

00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:20.276 A:middle
up doing is avoiding making
a decision altogether.

00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:24.236 A:middle
And you want people to make a
decision to purchase something.

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:29.026 A:middle
It's kind of like if you've
ever gone on to make a recipe

00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:30.916 A:middle
and it calls for apples.

00:24:31.316 --> 00:24:34.326 A:middle
Maybe you're making apple
pie and so you got your list.

00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:36.786 A:middle
You go to the grocery store and
then you're faced with this.

00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:39.056 A:middle
Well, what kind of apples?

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:42.806 A:middle
Is it Golden Delicious
or Red Delicious

00:24:42.806 --> 00:24:45.346 A:middle
or Fuji or Pink Lady or oh!

00:24:45.856 --> 00:24:46.536 A:middle
It's too much!

00:24:46.806 --> 00:24:47.756 A:middle
It's overwhelming!

00:24:48.016 --> 00:24:49.196 A:middle
Too many apples!

00:24:49.746 --> 00:24:53.006 A:middle
And this will result in you just
abandoning that pie altogether.

00:24:53.006 --> 00:24:56.736 A:middle
You want to avoid that
reaction in your app.

00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going

00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:04.396 A:middle
to result in people avoiding the
purchase decision altogether.

00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:07.206 A:middle
So here is Match.

00:25:07.926 --> 00:25:09.976 A:middle
It's a different
dating application.

00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:12.996 A:middle
Again, loads of utility
without subscription.

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.696 A:middle
More than letting you
test-drive the app.

00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:17.876 A:middle
They're practically
giving you an entire car.

00:25:18.326 --> 00:25:21.436 A:middle
You can fill out your profile,
message people, a million ways

00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.826 A:middle
of browsing including
recommended partners.

00:25:24.726 --> 00:25:28.466 A:middle
They do offer some premium
features though and one

00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:30.676 A:middle
of the things is
seeing who's viewed me.

00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:34.366 A:middle
So tapping on that
viewed me button brings

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.836 A:middle
up their subscription choices.

00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:38.016 A:middle
So they're offering
me that information

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:40.206 A:middle
at the time that I need it.

00:25:40.436 --> 00:25:43.236 A:middle
Now look, I've got
3 easy choices here.

00:25:43.866 --> 00:25:48.016 A:middle
They've even highlighted
the one with the best value.

00:25:48.016 --> 00:25:50.506 A:middle
3 choices is an easy
decision to make.

00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:55.496 A:middle
I don't have to scroll through
a long list of options or page

00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:56.926 A:middle
through screen after screen

00:25:56.926 --> 00:25:58.786 A:middle
with different subscription
numbers on it.

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.696 A:middle
Then I have to remember
them in my head


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.696 A:middle
Then I have to remember
them in my head

00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:01.856 A:middle
and try and figure it out.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:02.806 A:middle
That makes it hard.

00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:06.056 A:middle
Buying things shouldn't be hard.

00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:11.626 A:middle
So fewer things all on one
screen, no paging, no scrolling.

00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:18.066 A:middle
People want to be able to see
all their options at once.

00:26:19.386 --> 00:26:23.046 A:middle
Now, if someone's ready to
make that decision to buy,

00:26:23.046 --> 00:26:25.736 A:middle
they're ready to press that
buy button, you really want

00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:28.386 A:middle
to execute on it as
efficiently as possible.

00:26:28.946 --> 00:26:31.236 A:middle
I mean, have you ever gone
to get a cup of coffee

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:34.436 A:middle
and then you're faced with
a long, slow-moving line?

00:26:34.436 --> 00:26:36.066 A:middle
And so, you're just
like, "Forget it."

00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:40.216 A:middle
That's what you don't want to
happen in your app or game.

00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:44.946 A:middle
Minimizing both the time and the
number of steps that it takes

00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:48.666 A:middle
to make a purchase keeps people
really engaged in your app,

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:50.786 A:middle
not thinking about that
purchasing process.

00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:55.106 A:middle
So this is Supernauts.

00:26:55.106 --> 00:26:58.426 A:middle
It's a builder game that
takes place in space.

00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:02.006 A:middle
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:02.006 A:middle
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon

00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:03.756 A:middle
because you're probably going
to want to play it after this.

00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:06.336 A:middle
Now right now, I'm
in the process

00:27:06.336 --> 00:27:08.216 A:middle
of repairing my tiki hut.

00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:10.866 A:middle
As you can see, it's a little
pathetic at the moment.

00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:14.306 A:middle
I want to add some more
timber but this is going

00:27:14.306 --> 00:27:17.106 A:middle
to cost me 8 diamonds.

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.596 A:middle
Now, I only have 1.

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:24.816 A:middle
So what happens when I
press that green button?

00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:28.106 A:middle
I can get some gems right here.

00:27:28.206 --> 00:27:29.636 A:middle
I don't have to go anywhere.

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:34.656 A:middle
I can stay right in that
moment of tiki hut repair.

00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:38.486 A:middle
So in addition to clearly
stating what I'm going to get,

00:27:38.926 --> 00:27:43.616 A:middle
200 gems for $4.99, they're also
reminding me why I'm seeing this

00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:44.466 A:middle
in the first place.

00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:46.736 A:middle
I need 7 more.

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:47.446 A:middle
I only have 1.

00:27:47.446 --> 00:27:48.076 A:middle
I needed 8.

00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:50.706 A:middle
And they've even
selected the package

00:27:50.706 --> 00:27:53.036 A:middle
of gems that's closest
to what I needed.

00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:56.886 A:middle
It happens that this is the
smallest package of gems

00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:58.926 A:middle
but then I can make a
decision really quickly.

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:02.066 A:middle
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:02.066 A:middle
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,

00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:03.986 A:middle
it has many more options in it.

00:28:04.876 --> 00:28:08.406 A:middle
But taking me away from my
tiki hut is more disruptive

00:28:08.406 --> 00:28:11.926 A:middle
than letting me just stay
put, stay focused on building

00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:14.406 A:middle
because building is
what I came here to do.

00:28:15.596 --> 00:28:17.716 A:middle
You never want to
distract a game player

00:28:17.716 --> 00:28:18.966 A:middle
from playing the game.

00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.476 A:middle
That's the fun part.

00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:23.116 A:middle
Distracting them makes
it easier for them

00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:24.486 A:middle
to just walk away entirely.

00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:30.406 A:middle
Similarly, Candy Crush Saga
handles this really well also.

00:28:31.446 --> 00:28:34.286 A:middle
You have those boosters at
the beginning of every level

00:28:35.126 --> 00:28:37.746 A:middle
and you have the option of
purchasing them right here.

00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:40.706 A:middle
They're not shipping
me off to a candy store

00:28:40.706 --> 00:28:42.736 A:middle
with a million different
things to choose from.

00:28:42.986 --> 00:28:44.936 A:middle
It's just, "Would you
like this booster?

00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:45.796 A:middle
Here's the price.

00:28:45.926 --> 00:28:47.246 A:middle
Buy it. Back in the game."

00:28:47.586 --> 00:28:52.536 A:middle
Fast and efficient, right at
the moment when I can use it.

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:56.916 A:middle
Now another thing to think about
is preloading images and data

00:28:56.916 --> 00:28:58.276 A:middle
so it's there when
people need it.

00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.

00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:02.726 A:middle
It's another kind of
match-3 puzzle game.

00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:05.276 A:middle
Now you earn coins
as you're playing

00:29:05.336 --> 00:29:07.636 A:middle
and then you use the
coins to buy rare gems

00:29:07.706 --> 00:29:10.746 A:middle
which then help you to do
better on the various puzzles.

00:29:11.766 --> 00:29:13.976 A:middle
Now every day, you can
also get some free coins

00:29:14.426 --> 00:29:15.876 A:middle
from this daily wheel.

00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:20.466 A:middle
Now you get 1 free spin
per day but of course,

00:29:20.466 --> 00:29:23.476 A:middle
you can buy some more
spins, if you like.

00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:25.706 A:middle
And the wheel's pretty generous.

00:29:26.196 --> 00:29:27.626 A:middle
So imagine that you're excited

00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:29.006 A:middle
and you're like,
"Okay, you know what?

00:29:29.006 --> 00:29:31.016 A:middle
I'm doing really good on
the tournament this week.

00:29:31.016 --> 00:29:32.286 A:middle
I want to beat my friends.

00:29:32.836 --> 00:29:35.206 A:middle
Let me go get some more
spins and see what happens."

00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.126 A:middle
Well, what if you're
faced with this?

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:40.566 A:middle
People don't like waiting.

00:29:40.566 --> 00:29:42.516 A:middle
That's like that long
line at the coffee store.

00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:44.946 A:middle
You risk them not
sticking around.

00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:50.006 A:middle
Now thankfully, Bejeweled
Blitz doesn't do this.

00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:51.716 A:middle
They load everything
immediately.

00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:56.206 A:middle
What you want to do is to be
aware of what people are likely

00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:58.976 A:middle
to purchase based on where
they are in your app or game.

00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:02.776 A:middle
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:02.776 A:middle
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it

00:30:03.186 --> 00:30:06.076 A:middle
so that the data and the images
are available should someone

00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.036 A:middle
need it.

00:30:07.326 --> 00:30:09.516 A:middle
So this screen is
only accessible

00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:11.136 A:middle
from that wheel screen.

00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:14.326 A:middle
So this is a perfect opportunity
to preload those images

00:30:14.706 --> 00:30:15.796 A:middle
so then they'll be available.

00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:20.056 A:middle
The images and data will be
there when people seek it out.

00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:24.536 A:middle
And 1 final tip is you should
cache artwork appropriately

00:30:25.016 --> 00:30:27.286 A:middle
so it's not going to have
to load every single time

00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:28.886 A:middle
if it doesn't need to.

00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:32.206 A:middle
Now after lunch in this
room, we have a great session

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:35.466 A:middle
about optimizing in-app
purchases with StoreKit

00:30:35.676 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
so I highly recommend you come
back after lunch and check it

00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:41.356 A:middle
out because there's
a lot of great tips

00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:43.476 A:middle
for avoiding common pitfalls.

00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:49.296 A:middle
Now finally, what you can do to
make the buying process easier

00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:51.446 A:middle
on people is to inspire people.

00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:54.206 A:middle
Someone may not want something

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:56.846 A:middle
because they don't know what
the possibility of it is.

00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.036 A:middle
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.036 A:middle
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them

00:31:01.116 --> 00:31:05.236 A:middle
or what they could
achieve with them.

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:08.126 A:middle
Now, I'm not saying that
you want to turn everything

00:31:08.126 --> 00:31:09.736 A:middle
into an advertising experience.

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:11.286 A:middle
Again, we're not
trying to be pushy.

00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:12.506 A:middle
But there's a lot of ways

00:31:12.506 --> 00:31:16.686 A:middle
that you can really naturally
illustrate how things can

00:31:16.686 --> 00:31:18.636 A:middle
be used.

00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:21.836 A:middle
Paper by Fifty Three
does this beautifully.

00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:25.606 A:middle
They've got this sample
journal that the staff has made

00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:28.506 A:middle
that shows off not only what
the tools are capable of

00:31:28.876 --> 00:31:30.986 A:middle
but also different ways
they could be used.

00:31:31.636 --> 00:31:34.616 A:middle
You know, maybe you
want a wireframe with it

00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:36.496 A:middle
or maybe you want to
make some artwork.

00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:41.726 A:middle
Now another thing they do
well is give suggestive titles

00:31:41.726 --> 00:31:42.646 A:middle
to the blank journals.

00:31:43.706 --> 00:31:46.786 A:middle
Maybe you hadn't considered
sketching or journaling

00:31:46.786 --> 00:31:48.396 A:middle
with this app but
now you're going to.

00:31:48.396 --> 00:31:52.646 A:middle
And they also have a
gallery of artwork created

00:31:52.646 --> 00:31:55.176 A:middle
by people using the
app, regular people.

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:58.306 A:middle
And this gallery
shows off the variety

00:31:58.306 --> 00:32:02.146 A:middle
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

00:31:58.306 --> 00:32:02.146 A:middle
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

00:32:02.876 --> 00:32:05.336 A:middle
and also how the
app can be used.

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:09.116 A:middle
I mean, you can make
some amazing artwork

00:32:09.116 --> 00:32:11.786 A:middle
but you also might want to use
it for architectural renderings.

00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:16.686 A:middle
And if that doesn't get you
inspired, maybe the idea

00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:19.516 A:middle
of having your work featured
here is very exciting.

00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:24.026 A:middle
So you've just got a plethora
of ways that you can use the app

00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:26.616 A:middle
and see what the
tools are capable of.

00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:32.516 A:middle
Now again, with games, and with
Supernauts does this very well,

00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:35.846 A:middle
it's kind of a different
approach with the same idea.

00:32:36.796 --> 00:32:40.016 A:middle
So after you learn the basic
game play with Supernauts,

00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:43.546 A:middle
they reward you for visiting
other people's worlds.

00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:46.456 A:middle
Now like I said, this is a
builder game so you're working

00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:48.526 A:middle
on building up your property.

00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:52.046 A:middle
And seeing how creative other
people have been is super

00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:53.996 A:middle
inspiring for your own place.

00:32:55.446 --> 00:32:57.756 A:middle
Now this is how you
start off, pretty basic.

00:32:57.836 --> 00:32:59.866 A:middle
In the first 15 minutes,
you're going

00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:01.796 A:middle
to get some real basic
structures going.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:01.796 A:middle
to get some real basic
structures going.

00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:04.886 A:middle
And after a couple of hours,
you might wind up with something

00:33:04.886 --> 00:33:09.096 A:middle
like this or something
like my tiki hut.

00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:12.046 A:middle
And when you get through a
couple of hours, you think,

00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:13.206 A:middle
"Okay, I know what's going on.

00:33:13.776 --> 00:33:15.306 A:middle
I have an idea of
what's possible."

00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:17.696 A:middle
But it's only when you go

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:21.146 A:middle
to visit other people's worlds
do you really get a sense

00:33:21.716 --> 00:33:24.276 A:middle
for what's coming, for
what can be created.

00:33:27.406 --> 00:33:28.846 A:middle
So check these out.

00:33:28.846 --> 00:33:30.336 A:middle
These are all real players.

00:33:31.056 --> 00:33:34.686 A:middle
This is not the Supernauts
crew who created these.

00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:37.006 A:middle
Amazing, right?

00:33:37.236 --> 00:33:40.976 A:middle
I mean, my tiki hut is
super lame by comparison.

00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:44.566 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:46.936 A:middle
And now I'm excited.

00:33:46.936 --> 00:33:51.726 A:middle
Now I want to go in and add a
dragon or you know, a rainbow

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:54.216 A:middle
or a flag or messages
to my friends.

00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:55.836 A:middle
I mean, it makes,
it gets you excited

00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:57.856 A:middle
about spending more
time building things.

00:33:58.206 --> 00:33:59.386 A:middle
You make something really cool

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:02.106 A:middle
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:02.106 A:middle
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.

00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:07.146 A:middle
So as you're thinking about how

00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:09.646 A:middle
to make the buying
process easier,

00:34:10.795 --> 00:34:14.376 A:middle
make sure that people can see
what's available with no effort.

00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:18.686 A:middle
Help people understand the
value of what you're offering.

00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:20.735 A:middle
Give them that test
drive experience.

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.556 A:middle
And then when it comes
to the transaction,

00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:29.286 A:middle
make sure that you can process
on it fast and efficient.

00:34:29.286 --> 00:34:31.636 A:middle
And don't forget to
get people excited

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.696 A:middle
about what you're offering.

00:34:33.226 --> 00:34:36.065 A:middle
But the story doesn't end here.

00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.886 A:middle
Your job is not over
just getting them

00:34:37.886 --> 00:34:39.076 A:middle
to push the buy button.

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:41.266 A:middle
There's a lot of things
that need to happen

00:34:41.396 --> 00:34:44.716 A:middle
to complete the transaction
in order to have it continue

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:46.505 A:middle
to be a really great experience.

00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:51.916 A:middle
The first of which is a new
feature coming in the fall

00:34:51.996 --> 00:34:54.235 A:middle
and Tim touched on
this very briefly,

00:34:54.556 --> 00:34:57.045 A:middle
but I'd like to spend a little
more time because this is going

00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:01.126 A:middle
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:01.126 A:middle
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.

00:35:01.126 --> 00:35:05.186 A:middle
So in the fall, you'll be able
to associate up to 6 people

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:06.556 A:middle
in the household as a family.

00:35:07.176 --> 00:35:08.666 A:middle
And as part of this, we're going

00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:10.986 A:middle
to have a new parental
control called Ask to Buy.

00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:14.556 A:middle
And if it's enabled, this
means that a parent is going

00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:18.076 A:middle
to approve or decline any
purchases that a child makes.

00:35:19.036 --> 00:35:20.836 A:middle
So it's basically the
equivalent of this.

00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:23.046 A:middle
"Can I have it?

00:35:23.046 --> 00:35:24.166 A:middle
Please, please, please?"

00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:27.306 A:middle
But it's all going to
happen through your devices.

00:35:28.256 --> 00:35:29.386 A:middle
So here's how it works.

00:35:30.106 --> 00:35:34.606 A:middle
Today, when your app sends a
request to purchase something,

00:35:35.756 --> 00:35:37.986 A:middle
you're going to get a
response right back.

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.456 A:middle
That purchased or failed.

00:35:40.456 --> 00:35:46.686 A:middle
Now with Ask to Buy, we're going
to check with the parent first

00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:48.036 A:middle
if Ask to Buy is enabled.

00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:50.156 A:middle
So you're going to send
the request for purchasing.

00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:51.916 A:middle
The child's going to
ask for something.

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:54.336 A:middle
And then the App Store is
going to check with the parent.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.356 A:middle
So what does that mean to you?

00:35:57.986 --> 00:35:59.926 A:middle
During this time, you're going

00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:01.966 A:middle
to get a response
back of deferred.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:01.966 A:middle
to get a response
back of deferred.

00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:08.216 A:middle
And then once the parent
accepts or declines the request,

00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:11.686 A:middle
that's when the App Store will
let you know whether it's been

00:36:11.686 --> 00:36:12.686 A:middle
purchased or failed.

00:36:13.976 --> 00:36:18.636 A:middle
And this deferred state can last
for up to 24 hours while waiting

00:36:18.636 --> 00:36:19.916 A:middle
for a response from the parent.

00:36:20.206 --> 00:36:22.816 A:middle
And if there's no
response within 24 hours,

00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:25.886 A:middle
it's going to default to failed
and the child can request again.

00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:29.876 A:middle
So what does this mean
from a design perspective?

00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:34.046 A:middle
Well, if you have
modal situations

00:36:34.256 --> 00:36:37.206 A:middle
where people are doing
purchasing, you need to shift

00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:39.226 A:middle
over to an asynchronous model.

00:36:39.786 --> 00:36:43.566 A:middle
Let's say your game offers
boosters at the beginning

00:36:43.566 --> 00:36:46.156 A:middle
of a level and a child
makes a request to buy one.

00:36:46.716 --> 00:36:50.516 A:middle
You don't want that child stuck
there waiting for up to 24 hours

00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:52.616 A:middle
to hear whether they
can have a booster

00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:53.786 A:middle
for the next level, right?

00:36:54.116 --> 00:36:56.486 A:middle
I can guarantee you, they're not
going to stick around that long.

00:36:57.746 --> 00:36:59.206 A:middle
So what can you do?

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best

00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.766 A:middle
for your app or your game.

00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:07.036 A:middle
The important thing is that
you let people keep using

00:37:07.036 --> 00:37:08.926 A:middle
and enjoying your
app during this time.

00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:11.876 A:middle
So if a child's requested
a booster,

00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:14.746 A:middle
well you send the request
off for the parent to approve

00:37:15.146 --> 00:37:17.406 A:middle
but then you could let
them play other levels

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:19.466 A:middle
or maybe they continue
playing the level

00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:22.746 A:middle
but without the booster and
when that approval comes in,

00:37:22.746 --> 00:37:25.536 A:middle
you bank it and let them
use it at a different time.

00:37:26.676 --> 00:37:29.746 A:middle
Another thing that you want to
think about is giving some sort

00:37:29.746 --> 00:37:32.116 A:middle
of feedback inside
of the application

00:37:32.466 --> 00:37:35.506 A:middle
so that the child remembers
that something is pending,

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:37.466 A:middle
that they've already
asked Mom and Dad.

00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:41.846 A:middle
And so that you could update
the label on the button

00:37:41.846 --> 00:37:46.426 A:middle
to say something else or in the
App Store, we show a message

00:37:46.476 --> 00:37:48.926 A:middle
to help the child remember
that it's actually pending.

00:37:50.036 --> 00:37:53.266 A:middle
So if any people using
your app are under 18,

00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:55.956 A:middle
you need to start
preparing for this now.

00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:59.676 A:middle
That deferred state is
entirely new and you need

00:37:59.676 --> 00:38:01.416 A:middle
to make sure you're
handling it well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.676 --> 00:38:01.416 A:middle
to make sure you're
handling it well.

00:38:01.796 --> 00:38:05.156 A:middle
Make sure people can still
continue to use your app

00:38:05.206 --> 00:38:07.906 A:middle
or your game while that
deferred state is happening.

00:38:08.446 --> 00:38:14.436 A:middle
And you want to make sure
that if a response is pending,

00:38:14.436 --> 00:38:15.906 A:middle
that they have some
feedback there.

00:38:17.366 --> 00:38:20.586 A:middle
It's really important to note
that this isn't just iOS 8.

00:38:20.586 --> 00:38:24.056 A:middle
So don't think that waiting to
update your app or game is going

00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:25.956 A:middle
to get you out of this
because it's not going to.

00:38:26.916 --> 00:38:30.646 A:middle
The ability to create families
is what's coming with iOS 8

00:38:31.426 --> 00:38:34.566 A:middle
but this Ask to Buy
permission is going to apply

00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:38.876 A:middle
to older versions of
iOS, Mac OS and Apple TV,

00:38:39.826 --> 00:38:42.836 A:middle
so start preparing now.

00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:45.366 A:middle
Now, whether or not a
transaction completes

00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:49.386 A:middle
immediately or up to 24
hours later, you always want

00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:52.026 A:middle
to confirm that that
transaction is completed.

00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:52.626 A:middle
Let people know.

00:38:53.936 --> 00:38:57.736 A:middle
So at a minimum, help people
find whatever they just bought.

00:38:57.736 --> 00:38:59.916 A:middle
Let them know that
it's available for use.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.896 --> 00:39:03.806 A:middle
An example that you guys
probably see all the time is the

00:39:03.806 --> 00:39:04.666 A:middle
App Store.

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:08.016 A:middle
So as soon as you confirm
payment for an application,

00:39:08.496 --> 00:39:10.566 A:middle
you see that the app
starts to download.

00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:12.816 A:middle
You get that feedback that
something's happening.

00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:14.756 A:middle
Nothing's gone wrong.

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:17.096 A:middle
Your merchandise is
being transferred to you.

00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:21.606 A:middle
And then you can open that app
directly from the App Store.

00:39:21.606 --> 00:39:22.566 A:middle
You don't have to go digging

00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:25.176 A:middle
around all your home screens
filled with apps to find it.

00:39:25.476 --> 00:39:29.656 A:middle
You can just start playing
3's right there for hours.

00:39:30.586 --> 00:39:33.706 A:middle
Now, another thing to think
about is if you have a game

00:39:33.706 --> 00:39:36.066 A:middle
or a children's app,
something really fun,

00:39:36.216 --> 00:39:37.936 A:middle
you can make this
a fun experience

00:39:37.936 --> 00:39:39.856 A:middle
by using sound and animation.

00:39:40.766 --> 00:39:42.076 A:middle
So this is Heads Up!

00:39:42.476 --> 00:39:45.666 A:middle
It's a game that's really
popular with Ellen DeGeneres.

00:39:45.956 --> 00:39:48.286 A:middle
She plays it on her
TV show all the time.

00:39:48.706 --> 00:39:49.956 A:middle
It's a little bit like Charades.

00:39:49.956 --> 00:39:53.226 A:middle
It's designed to play it with
real people in real life.

00:39:54.426 --> 00:39:57.576 A:middle
Each of this deck of theme cards
are topics that you then act

00:39:57.576 --> 00:39:58.976 A:middle
out for your friends
and try and guess.

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.266 A:middle
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.266 A:middle
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.886 A:middle
to get going to start playing.

00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:08.986 A:middle
But then they also offer
a ton of other theme packs

00:40:08.986 --> 00:40:10.386 A:middle
to enhance the experience.

00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:13.486 A:middle
So check out what happens
when you buy one of these.

00:40:13.736 --> 00:40:14.976 A:middle
I happen to be into
the 80's one.

00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:24.181 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:40:24.346 --> 00:40:26.786 A:middle
So you get that sound
and that animation

00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:28.576 A:middle
that lets you know
something has happened.

00:40:28.806 --> 00:40:31.476 A:middle
The purchase has gone through
and then they animate back

00:40:31.476 --> 00:40:34.416 A:middle
up to the top so you can
see where your cards are

00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:39.146 A:middle
and start playing right away.

00:40:39.986 --> 00:40:45.306 A:middle
Now confirming that the
transaction is completed is

00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:47.156 A:middle
especially important
with Ask to Buy

00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:50.846 A:middle
because your customer may
not be at the same place

00:40:50.846 --> 00:40:53.056 A:middle
where they were when they
requested the transaction,

00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:53.406 A:middle
right?

00:40:54.036 --> 00:40:56.496 A:middle
So if you had a comic app

00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:59.116 A:middle
and say the child is
browsing all the comics

00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:02.686 A:middle
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:02.686 A:middle
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting

00:41:02.686 --> 00:41:06.746 A:middle
for Mom or Dad to accept it,
well then they go and read one

00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:07.806 A:middle
of the issues they already have.

00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:12.426 A:middle
So you need to think about if
that transaction completes,

00:41:13.276 --> 00:41:15.866 A:middle
how are you going to let
people know if it completes

00:41:15.866 --> 00:41:17.706 A:middle
at a later time how you're
going to let people know

00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:23.566 A:middle
where their merchandise
is and how to find it.

00:41:23.836 --> 00:41:27.146 A:middle
Now no one wants to see
Error Code 128, right?

00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:29.676 A:middle
It's confusing.

00:41:29.676 --> 00:41:33.196 A:middle
It's frustrating to someone and
it can be a little alarming.

00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:37.216 A:middle
So you want to know your error
codes and present information

00:41:37.216 --> 00:41:38.696 A:middle
in a way that's going
to be meaningful

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.326 A:middle
to the people using your apps.

00:41:41.736 --> 00:41:43.836 A:middle
Not all errors may
require a response.

00:41:44.246 --> 00:41:46.056 A:middle
You don't have to tell
your people everything.

00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:50.256 A:middle
Now if someone did
cancel a transaction,

00:41:50.256 --> 00:41:51.896 A:middle
let's say that you're
using an app or game,

00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.116 A:middle
you change your mind
about something.

00:41:53.116 --> 00:41:53.836 A:middle
You cancel it.

00:41:54.506 --> 00:41:55.706 A:middle
Is this what you want to see?

00:41:56.356 --> 00:41:57.356 A:middle
This doesn't make sense.

00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
You may not need to
notify people at all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
You may not need to
notify people at all

00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:02.426 A:middle
or you may just want to
make this a little more

00:42:02.636 --> 00:42:03.426 A:middle
customer friendly.

00:42:04.086 --> 00:42:07.816 A:middle
So the best experience,
of course,

00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:09.726 A:middle
is to avoid errors entirely.

00:42:09.726 --> 00:42:11.616 A:middle
So again, this afternoon's
session

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:15.216 A:middle
on optimizing StoreKit is going
to have a ton of technical tips

00:42:15.676 --> 00:42:18.546 A:middle
about avoiding errors and
all those common pitfalls.

00:42:19.046 --> 00:42:25.246 A:middle
Now another thing that I see
sometimes is that people tend

00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:26.926 A:middle
to over ask for purchases.

00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.486 A:middle
You want to let folks
get some enjoyment

00:42:30.586 --> 00:42:33.006 A:middle
out of what they just bought
before you start asking them

00:42:33.006 --> 00:42:33.916 A:middle
to buy something again.

00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:36.456 A:middle
Again, don't be this guy.

00:42:37.936 --> 00:42:41.276 A:middle
It's like at Christmas,
so you unwrap the toy

00:42:41.276 --> 00:42:44.446 A:middle
and you're all excited
and then you realize, "Oh,

00:42:44.446 --> 00:42:46.506 A:middle
it didn't come with
any batteries!"

00:42:47.706 --> 00:42:49.186 A:middle
It's disappointing right?

00:42:49.186 --> 00:42:50.656 A:middle
I mean, you just took something

00:42:50.656 --> 00:42:53.426 A:middle
that was a really joyous
occasion and turned it

00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:55.546 A:middle
into a frustrating
experience for people.

00:42:56.186 --> 00:42:58.686 A:middle
So make sure that when
someone buys something,

00:42:58.686 --> 00:43:00.366 A:middle
they can use what
they just bought.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.686 --> 00:43:00.366 A:middle
they can use what
they just bought.

00:43:00.906 --> 00:43:02.606 A:middle
Give them that satisfaction.

00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:05.276 A:middle
They shouldn't have to
make a subsequent purchase

00:43:05.326 --> 00:43:06.976 A:middle
in order to enjoy it.

00:43:09.376 --> 00:43:13.096 A:middle
And then like I said
earlier, less is more.

00:43:13.646 --> 00:43:16.056 A:middle
You want to prioritize
the remaining purchases.

00:43:16.606 --> 00:43:20.076 A:middle
Help people focus on what's
still available to them.

00:43:20.076 --> 00:43:22.956 A:middle
If there's things they
can't buy, do prioritize

00:43:22.956 --> 00:43:26.086 A:middle
that in the UI, especially
with nonconsumables.

00:43:26.206 --> 00:43:28.346 A:middle
There is no need to keep
showing people something

00:43:28.346 --> 00:43:29.236 A:middle
that they've already bought.

00:43:29.436 --> 00:43:31.726 A:middle
They already own it.

00:43:32.136 --> 00:43:35.356 A:middle
Now in some cases, it may
not make sense to hide items

00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:36.576 A:middle
that have already been purchased

00:43:36.866 --> 00:43:42.636 A:middle
but just don't let them
be the star of the show.

00:43:43.056 --> 00:43:45.956 A:middle
And I think you're all aware
that it's very important

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:48.336 A:middle
that you let people
restore their purchases

00:43:48.336 --> 00:43:50.406 A:middle
that they've made previously.

00:43:50.606 --> 00:43:52.776 A:middle
They could have made
it on another device

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:57.036 A:middle
or they got a new piece of
hardware and it's important

00:43:57.036 --> 00:43:58.616 A:middle
that they can retrieve what
they've already bought.

00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:03.436 A:middle
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:03.436 A:middle
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.

00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:05.276 A:middle
If you already have
a subscription,

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:08.276 A:middle
well here's where to go to
start that restore process.

00:44:10.076 --> 00:44:11.456 A:middle
But they took it
one step further.

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:15.636 A:middle
So if you were to tap on one
of these subscription options,

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:18.376 A:middle
you get the confirmation
to subscribe just

00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:19.306 A:middle
like you would expect.

00:44:20.246 --> 00:44:24.916 A:middle
But if you hit Cancel, they ask
if you're already a subscriber.

00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:29.156 A:middle
And that's because there's
basically 2 reasons why you

00:44:29.156 --> 00:44:31.426 A:middle
might cancel subscription
confirmation.

00:44:32.126 --> 00:44:35.846 A:middle
One is if you changed your mind
about subscribing, of course.

00:44:36.126 --> 00:44:38.686 A:middle
And that's a much bigger
problem for them to tackle.

00:44:39.546 --> 00:44:42.006 A:middle
But the other is if you
already had a subscription.

00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:46.946 A:middle
So in this case, they're
helping get you back on track.

00:44:47.266 --> 00:44:49.306 A:middle
Now you all know it's
an App Store requirement

00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:51.766 A:middle
to make restoring available.

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.596 A:middle
But a great experience
is going to make it easy.

00:44:54.596 --> 00:44:59.146 A:middle
All right, so one last
tip in this section.

00:44:59.486 --> 00:45:01.516 A:middle
And this is about notifications.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.486 --> 00:45:01.516 A:middle
And this is about notifications.

00:45:02.206 --> 00:45:05.746 A:middle
You want to use them
thoughtfully and this applies

00:45:05.746 --> 00:45:09.086 A:middle
to push notifications as
well as local notifications.

00:45:10.506 --> 00:45:13.036 A:middle
Now you're not going to have
to notify children about Ask

00:45:13.226 --> 00:45:16.026 A:middle
to Buy, purchases completing
because the App Store is going

00:45:16.026 --> 00:45:17.006 A:middle
to handle that for you.

00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:20.746 A:middle
But you do want to use
notifications to let people know

00:45:20.746 --> 00:45:24.436 A:middle
about new content for
a subscription or maybe

00:45:24.436 --> 00:45:26.376 A:middle
in those dating apps,
they could let me know

00:45:26.376 --> 00:45:28.656 A:middle
if I have new recommended
matches.

00:45:29.826 --> 00:45:33.196 A:middle
Circa does a great job
with their notifications.

00:45:33.616 --> 00:45:36.336 A:middle
They serve up bite-sized
news articles

00:45:36.336 --> 00:45:38.566 A:middle
and they give you
updates as it's happening.

00:45:39.366 --> 00:45:42.436 A:middle
Now they're only going to send
notification if it's an article

00:45:42.436 --> 00:45:45.446 A:middle
that I explicitly followed
or if it's something

00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:46.986 A:middle
that they consider
breaking news.

00:45:47.946 --> 00:45:49.916 A:middle
And they're very choosy

00:45:50.336 --> 00:45:52.076 A:middle
about what they consider
breaking news.

00:45:52.506 --> 00:45:54.906 A:middle
Now this is not breaking news.

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:56.486 A:middle
This is what I followed earlier.

00:45:57.166 --> 00:46:00.006 A:middle
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:57.166 --> 00:46:00.006 A:middle
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly

00:46:00.006 --> 00:46:01.956 A:middle
to the article so you
can read all about it.

00:46:02.306 --> 00:46:05.096 A:middle
So they've made it really easy
for me to return to the content.

00:46:05.156 --> 00:46:10.186 A:middle
So you want to be really
thoughtful about the kind

00:46:10.506 --> 00:46:13.126 A:middle
and the number of notifications
that you're sending

00:46:13.506 --> 00:46:15.856 A:middle
because too many
notifications is just going

00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:17.106 A:middle
to annoy everybody.

00:46:17.656 --> 00:46:20.406 A:middle
And not only do you risk them
turning off notifications

00:46:20.406 --> 00:46:23.566 A:middle
entirely, they might just
wind up deleting your app,

00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:25.456 A:middle
if they get tired of
all the notifications.

00:46:26.426 --> 00:46:28.806 A:middle
That's not the experience
that we're after, right?

00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:30.876 A:middle
You want thoughtful
notifications

00:46:30.936 --> 00:46:32.896 A:middle
that will keep people
coming back

00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:35.566 A:middle
and make the app
feel more valuable

00:46:35.566 --> 00:46:40.236 A:middle
because suddenly there's
new content there.

00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:43.116 A:middle
Okay, so make sure that
you consider these things

00:46:43.986 --> 00:46:46.156 A:middle
after your customer's
pressed the buy button.

00:46:46.386 --> 00:46:48.766 A:middle
Completing the transaction
is super important.

00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:53.266 A:middle
Which brings us to the
final sort of stage

00:46:53.266 --> 00:46:55.296 A:middle
of a great experience
with in-app purchases

00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:58.256 A:middle
and that's measuring
and refining.

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:02.046 A:middle
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:02.046 A:middle
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,

00:47:02.476 --> 00:47:05.056 A:middle
you want to measure the
success and quite frankly,

00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:07.126 A:middle
the failures of what you tried.

00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:09.676 A:middle
See how that has
an effect on things

00:47:10.056 --> 00:47:12.546 A:middle
and then make changes
based on those.

00:47:13.586 --> 00:47:16.276 A:middle
I mean, that all the things
that I mentioned today are going

00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:19.096 A:middle
to work for all product
types and all audiences.

00:47:19.816 --> 00:47:22.816 A:middle
So the more that you really fine
tune your approach, the better,

00:47:23.256 --> 00:47:26.036 A:middle
the more effective
it's going to be.

00:47:26.036 --> 00:47:28.756 A:middle
So here are some questions
that you can ask yourself

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.706 A:middle
about the changes that you made

00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:32.846 A:middle
to help determine whether
they were successful.

00:47:33.756 --> 00:47:36.646 A:middle
So when were the changes
made and what were they?

00:47:37.096 --> 00:47:40.246 A:middle
Super important, you want
to make a detailed note

00:47:40.246 --> 00:47:43.196 A:middle
about exactly when you made
changes and all the things

00:47:43.196 --> 00:47:44.616 A:middle
that you updated so
you have something

00:47:44.616 --> 00:47:45.776 A:middle
to measure against later.

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:50.856 A:middle
You also want to think about
how has the number of changes,

00:47:51.096 --> 00:47:52.866 A:middle
how has the number
of purchases changed?

00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:55.426 A:middle
Hopefully they've
gone up, right?

00:47:57.426 --> 00:48:00.626 A:middle
And are different things being
purchased from different places


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.426 --> 00:48:00.626 A:middle
And are different things being
purchased from different places

00:48:00.626 --> 00:48:03.646 A:middle
in the application as a result
of integrating your merchandise?

00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:05.966 A:middle
Are you selling higher
value items?

00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:10.686 A:middle
And what's the average
revenue per device?

00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:13.116 A:middle
And this is going to be
really easy to see in the fall

00:48:13.116 --> 00:48:15.646 A:middle
with the new iTunes Connect
because we have a ton

00:48:15.646 --> 00:48:18.786 A:middle
of app analytics coming
for you all for free.

00:48:18.786 --> 00:48:20.896 A:middle
And this helps you learn whether

00:48:20.896 --> 00:48:23.016 A:middle
or not a marketing
campaign was worth it.

00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:26.466 A:middle
If you invested a certain
amount of money per device

00:48:26.796 --> 00:48:29.426 A:middle
and you're not seeing that
revenue come back in, well,

00:48:29.596 --> 00:48:32.976 A:middle
that campaign's not going to
be a good investment for you.

00:48:33.666 --> 00:48:35.716 A:middle
And finally, keep an eye out.

00:48:35.806 --> 00:48:38.126 A:middle
Are people returning
more frequently?

00:48:38.876 --> 00:48:41.406 A:middle
Because if they are,
that's an indication

00:48:41.406 --> 00:48:44.826 A:middle
that you have a really great
experience, that the quality

00:48:44.826 --> 00:48:48.306 A:middle
of the experience has gone up.

00:48:49.146 --> 00:48:53.216 A:middle
So I hope that you guys
will take at least one

00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:56.676 A:middle
of the design tips that I gave
you today and implement it

00:48:56.676 --> 00:49:00.606 A:middle
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

00:48:56.676 --> 00:49:00.606 A:middle
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:01.806 A:middle
overall experience.

00:49:02.396 --> 00:49:03.106 A:middle
Because I think you're going

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.076 A:middle
to be really happy
with the results.

00:49:05.796 --> 00:49:08.726 A:middle
And I would like to
hear how it goes.

00:49:08.806 --> 00:49:10.026 A:middle
This is my email address.

00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:12.016 A:middle
So let me know.

00:49:12.476 --> 00:49:13.616 A:middle
Let me know what you changed.

00:49:13.616 --> 00:49:16.276 A:middle
Let me know the effects that
it's having on your sales.

00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:20.026 A:middle
And if you would like more
design advice, we have tons

00:49:20.026 --> 00:49:24.256 A:middle
of it at Designing Great Apps
up at developer.apple.com.

00:49:24.946 --> 00:49:26.726 A:middle
And if you don't all have a copy

00:49:26.726 --> 00:49:28.526 A:middle
of the Human Interface
Guidelines,

00:49:28.726 --> 00:49:31.276 A:middle
it's a great resource,
a lot of good tips.

00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.216 A:middle
It's available on
the iBooks Store now.

00:49:34.236 --> 00:49:38.216 A:middle
So here are all the related
sessions you might want to see.

00:49:38.626 --> 00:49:41.076 A:middle
Ingredients of Great Games
was yesterday and that talks

00:49:41.076 --> 00:49:44.316 A:middle
about how to have a really
great gaming experience.

00:49:44.766 --> 00:49:47.556 A:middle
And so the video should
be available online

00:49:47.556 --> 00:49:48.436 A:middle
and you can watch it.

00:49:48.976 --> 00:49:51.646 A:middle
And just before the session
was the new iTunes Connect

00:49:52.196 --> 00:49:54.626 A:middle
which had all the information
about app analytics.

00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:57.806 A:middle
So look for that video
to be out later today.

00:49:58.196 --> 00:50:02.086 A:middle
And then we have our Optimizing

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.196 --> 00:50:02.086 A:middle
And then we have our Optimizing
In-App Purchases later today

00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:04.876 A:middle
in this room, tons of
great technical tips.

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:10.606 A:middle
And there's a prototyping
session tomorrow morning that's

00:50:10.606 --> 00:50:13.426 A:middle
going to tell you all about
how to quickly iterate and test

00:50:13.426 --> 00:50:16.756 A:middle
out the value and it's a great
session to figure out how

00:50:16.756 --> 00:50:19.286 A:middle
to quickly test things
out that you might want

00:50:19.286 --> 00:50:21.026 A:middle
to integrate into your app.

00:50:21.416 --> 00:50:24.396 A:middle
And finally, on Friday, come

00:50:24.496 --> 00:50:27.216 A:middle

Purchases with Receipts

00:50:27.686 --> 00:50:30.356 A:middle
because you're offering
really valuable things

00:50:30.466 --> 00:50:32.136 A:middle
and we only want you
to be giving them

00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:33.276 A:middle
to people who've paid for them.

00:50:33.476 --> 00:50:37.866 A:middle
So it's going to be a very
detailed technical heavy session

00:50:38.076 --> 00:50:39.086 A:middle
that you'll want to check out.

00:50:39.976 --> 00:50:41.426 A:middle
