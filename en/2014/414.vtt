[ Silence ]

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:18.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:19.236 A:middle
All right.

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:20.346 A:middle
You're happy to see me.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:20.776 A:middle
That's good.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:24.996 A:middle
My name's Will Turner and with
my colleague, Brooke Callahan,

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:28.376 A:middle
we'll be talking to you
about testing in Xcode 6.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.286 A:middle
And let's get started.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.066 A:middle
So we're going to cover
several topics today.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.996 A:middle
To start off, to just
kind of motivate this.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.866 A:middle
Think about the benefits
of testing.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.626 A:middle
Why should we bother
in the first place?

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.166 A:middle
Then we'll get into what it
takes to add test to a project.

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:47.226 A:middle
Maybe you have old projects
that don't have tests.

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:52.386 A:middle
And then we'll talk about
some new features in Xcode 6

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:55.136 A:middle
which allow you to test
asynchronous systems

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
and then also testing
features that allow you

00:00:57.636 --> 00:00:59.866 A:middle
to catch performance
regressions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:06.876 A:middle
So why should we test?

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:10.336 A:middle
Obviously, every time moment
we spend developing is an

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.596 A:middle
investment of a resource.

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:14.216 A:middle
Our resource is time
and our colleagues

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:16.866 A:middle
for maintaining the code
base that we create.

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:18.706 A:middle
So the obvious thing

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:21.106 A:middle
about testing is it
helps you find bugs

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.476 A:middle
and there's many classes of
bugs that you find with testing.

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:26.996 A:middle
They are regressions so cases

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:30.036 A:middle
where you've shipped your
product, you make a code change,

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:33.236 A:middle
add a feature and in the
process something breaks

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:36.356 A:middle
and now your 1.1
or 1.2 has a bug

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:37.796 A:middle
and your customers are unhappy.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.476 A:middle
We hate regressions.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:41.506 A:middle
Tests are a fantastic way

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.936 A:middle
to ensure your code ships
without regressions.

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:47.246 A:middle
There's also bugs where
performance changes.

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.016 A:middle
You make a change in your code

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:51.326 A:middle
and now suddenly something
is taking a lot more time

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.856 A:middle
to execute and maybe that's only
on some devices and not others.

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:57.806 A:middle
So tests again can
be a great way

00:01:57.876 --> 00:01:59.546 A:middle
to catch performance
regressions.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:04.036 A:middle
The other sort of less talked
about and less obvious benefit

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:06.836 A:middle
of testing is that it
codifies the requirements

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.776 A:middle
of your project.

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.696 A:middle
So especially if you're
sharing code with engineers,

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:16.136 A:middle
you create classes as classes
have APIs and a lot of times

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:18.666 A:middle
because Objective-C and
Swift are great languages

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:23.786 A:middle
for expressing the API,
semantics of the API,

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.866 A:middle
they're self-documenting.

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.656 A:middle
We think, okay, our job is done.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.486 A:middle
But in truth, they
don't really account

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:32.276 A:middle
for all the possible
permutations

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:34.076 A:middle
of inputs to those functions.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:35.666 A:middle
So if you write tests,

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:39.616 A:middle
those tests help codify the
requirements of those APIs.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:41.066 A:middle
So another engineer
can come along.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:43.066 A:middle
They can make code
changes in that area

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.646 A:middle
and the tests helps them
understand what the expected

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:46.576 A:middle
behavior is.

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:51.956 A:middle
So to get started with
tests, you may have a project

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:53.816 A:middle
that doesn't have test already.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:55.886 A:middle
So you want to add
test to that project

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.856 A:middle
and then the obvious
thing to do is make sure

00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.456 A:middle
that those tests pass.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:02.986 A:middle
Alternatively, you may
start with a new project.

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.756 A:middle
And in that case, you have the
option of a different workflow

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:08.916 A:middle
where you create tests first.

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.996 A:middle
And then you write code
that passes those tests

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:15.416 A:middle
and that's sometimes referred
to as test-driven development.

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:19.376 A:middle
So now you're set up.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:20.126 A:middle
You've got your test.

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:20.996 A:middle
They're passing.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.136 A:middle
You can go into a workflow
that we talked about.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.876 A:middle
We consider continuous
integration workflow.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:27.656 A:middle
And you start off
in a green state

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:31.316 A:middle
where everything is working
and you're making code changes.

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:33.246 A:middle
You're adding features,
fixing bugs.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:37.396 A:middle
And at some point, one of these
code changes introduces a bug.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.706 A:middle
And so now, your
continuous integration

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:42.206 A:middle
because you've written
tests identifies that bug

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:45.696 A:middle
and you know right away, right
after that first code change,

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:47.646 A:middle
you know that the bug
has been introduced.

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.706 A:middle
So then you can take the
necessary steps to fix the bug

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.476 A:middle
and return to a green state.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.476 A:middle
And what you really like,

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:56.816 A:middle
I think is a green state
represents known quality.

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:00.476 A:middle
And having tests and having
continuous integration ensures


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:00.476 A:middle
And having tests and having
continuous integration ensures

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:03.696 A:middle
that your projects
remain in a known state

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
of quality all the time.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.186 A:middle
So to get started, let's talk

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.036 A:middle
about how testing
works in Xcode.

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:15.236 A:middle
Xcode ships with a
framework called XCTest

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:17.766 A:middle
and this is framework
for testing.

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:20.586 A:middle
It provides a set of APIs
that lets you create tests,

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:24.256 A:middle
run the tests, express
expectations,

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:25.406 A:middle
passes and failures.

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:29.736 A:middle
It all starts with the
base class XCTestCase.

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:33.476 A:middle
And to create test,
you subclass XCTestCase

00:04:33.596 --> 00:04:35.416 A:middle
and then you add test methods.

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.536 A:middle
And these test methods
follow a naming convention.

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.116 A:middle
They return void.

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:44.456 A:middle
They're prefixed with the
word, "test" in lowercase

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.626 A:middle
and they take no parameters.

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:50.586 A:middle
The remainder of the method
name is at your discretion.

00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:56.576 A:middle
It should be sort of a name that
conveys the purpose of the test.

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.016 A:middle
Inside these test methods,

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:01.996 A:middle
you can use assertion APIs we
provide to report failures.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:01.996 A:middle
you can use assertion APIs we
provide to report failures.

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:07.536 A:middle
For example, XCTAssertEqual
compares two scalar values

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:10.586 A:middle
and if they don't match,
it outputs a string

00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:14.256 A:middle
and reports a failure
to the test harness.

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:19.106 A:middle
So in Xcode, we manage
a lot of different parts

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:20.626 A:middle
of our projects through targets.

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:22.776 A:middle
And we have test targets
for managing tests.

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:25.556 A:middle
Test targets build bundles

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:29.436 A:middle
and these bundles contain
the compiled test code

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.486 A:middle
and also resources that you
would want to use in the test.

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:34.816 A:middle
Maybe you have data files
that drive your tests.

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
These go in your test bundle
but you don't really want

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.316 A:middle
to ship those with
your application.

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:40.166 A:middle
You go and ship them with --

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:41.616 A:middle
though you don't want
to ship them at all.

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:43.336 A:middle
You want them to be
with your test bundle.

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:48.076 A:middle
So these are -- test targets
are automatically included

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:49.056 A:middle
in new projects.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:51.206 A:middle
If I go today and I
create a new application,

00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
you'll see there's a test target
and a test class already there

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.256 A:middle
to start me off, get me right
in test from the beginning.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:03.716 A:middle
You can also add test
targets to existing projects.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:07.216 A:middle
And this may be something
you want to do to a project

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.976 A:middle
that hasn't a test or it
also be a step you take

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:13.796 A:middle
to help organize your
tests because you can have

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:17.316 A:middle
as many test targets as you
want and it's useful sometimes

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:20.116 A:middle
that you will run just this
test target or that test target

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:21.726 A:middle
or you can run them
all together.

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:28.666 A:middle
So let's think about a
moment about how tests run.

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:31.176 A:middle
Because they are bundles,
these are not executables

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:32.666 A:middle
that can be launched themselves.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.046 A:middle
So instead, we need to host
them in an executable process.

00:06:38.796 --> 00:06:41.456 A:middle
Generally, we inject
these into your apps.

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.386 A:middle
So your test can be written
against your application

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
and it can access all the code
in your application which means

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.216 A:middle
when we run the test, we run it

00:06:49.216 --> 00:06:51.106 A:middle
in the context of
your application.

00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:54.686 A:middle
Alternatively, you can run them

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:59.126 A:middle
in a hosting process
that's provided by Xcode.

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:02.036 A:middle
Resources for tests,
as I mentioned before,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:02.036 A:middle
Resources for tests,
as I mentioned before,

00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:04.026 A:middle
are not in the main bundle.

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:05.256 A:middle
They're in your test bundle.

00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:09.666 A:middle
So when you go to load them,
don't use NSBundle mainBundle.

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:11.246 A:middle
This is something
that trips people up.

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:14.146 A:middle
I think a lot of us just kind
of have NSBundle mainBundle

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.956 A:middle
on autocomplete in our heads.

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:20.496 A:middle
But instead, we want to
use NSBundle bundleForClass

00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:22.216 A:middle
and pass your test class.

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:25.146 A:middle
That ensures that you're
going into the test bundle

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:26.516 A:middle
to locate that resource.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:33.276 A:middle
So running tests, Xcode lets you
run tests in a number of ways.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.706 A:middle
The simplest way is Command-U

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:38.356 A:middle
and this takes your active
scheme and runs the tests

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:40.056 A:middle
that are associated
with that scheme.

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:45.786 A:middle
You also have buttons and the
Source Editor's got it next

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:49.656 A:middle
to the test method that lets you
run just that test or the class

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.256 A:middle
and all of the tests
in that class.

00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:55.366 A:middle
So you have a similar set of
buttons in the Test Navigator.

00:07:55.996 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
And you can also run tests using
xcodebuild so if you have a set


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:55.996 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
And you can also run tests using
xcodebuild so if you have a set

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:02.696 A:middle
of scripts that you've used
to create your own kind

00:08:02.696 --> 00:08:05.646 A:middle
of automation setup,
you can use xcodebuild.

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:10.576 A:middle
And you pass at the test action
and you pass your project.

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:13.476 A:middle
Tell it which scheme
-- this is essential

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:15.516 A:middle
because your project
may have many schemes --

00:08:16.256 --> 00:08:17.866 A:middle
and the destination.

00:08:18.146 --> 00:08:20.366 A:middle
And you can have multiple
destinations so if you want

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:23.806 A:middle
to run on multiple devices,
you can pass these all

00:08:23.806 --> 00:08:29.636 A:middle
with distinct -destination flags
and xcodebuild will run them.

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:32.326 A:middle
When your tests are done,
where do you see the results?

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
Again, there's a
number of places

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.586 A:middle
where we display the
results of the tests.

00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:37.726 A:middle
The first is at Test Navigator.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:42.916 A:middle
We will see a green checkmark
or red icon indicating failure.

00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:45.496 A:middle
Also in the Issue Navigator.

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:49.486 A:middle
If you hit a test failure,
you'll see not only the failure

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:52.016 A:middle
but the reason it failed and
so if you've used our search

00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:55.366 A:middle
in macros, this is where you'll
see that error string that says,

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:57.896 A:middle
you know, 50 was
not equal to zero

00:08:57.896 --> 00:09:00.256 A:middle
or whatever the assertion
you were testing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.896 --> 00:09:00.256 A:middle
or whatever the assertion
you were testing.

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:04.266 A:middle
They also show in the
Source Editor's gutter

00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:08.146 A:middle
and then finally, most
useful is the Test Reports

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:12.436 A:middle
where we show all the tests that
have run and the logs associated

00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:14.756 A:middle
with them and some
additional data that we'll get

00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:16.056 A:middle
to later in the presentation.

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:19.276 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:23.006 A:middle
See what it looks like to add
tests to an existing project.

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:28.486 A:middle
Let's take a look at how
this is put together.

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:32.156 A:middle
To simplify this for the demo,
I've tweaked it a little bit

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:33.736 A:middle
from the sample code
that's online.

00:09:33.896 --> 00:09:40.086 A:middle
But basically the guts of this
app is this NSOperation subclass

00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:42.286 A:middle
that parses the XML data.

00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:48.426 A:middle
And NSOperation, as you know, is
designed to provide concurrency

00:09:48.476 --> 00:09:51.496 A:middle
and be run in the background.

00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:54.096 A:middle
This class has a Delegate
that it calls back

00:09:54.286 --> 00:09:56.676 A:middle
with certain events
when parsing is done,

00:09:56.676 --> 00:09:58.606 A:middle
when it's parsed a
certain number of objects

00:09:58.606 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
or if it encounters
any kind of error.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:06.026 A:middle
So we have this property
here, parsedEarthquakes

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
and that's something you can
access safely at any time

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:12.146 A:middle
to see the array of
parsedEarthquake objects.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:15.896 A:middle
So I'd like to write
a test that validates

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:18.636 A:middle
that this parsed
operation behaves correctly.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.546 A:middle
So let's start clean.

00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:28.556 A:middle
We have -- not a
clean slate here.

00:10:33.596 --> 00:10:40.716 A:middle
We're going to reset
this a little bit

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:46.056 A:middle
so you can see what it
looks like to add test

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:47.096 A:middle
to an existing project.

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:52.806 A:middle
So we have our project
and at this point,

00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:53.776 A:middle
there's no test target.

00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:57.636 A:middle
So to add a test, I'm going
to go to the file menu

00:10:58.206 --> 00:10:59.776 A:middle
and will select a new target.

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:04.706 A:middle
I'm going to select under
other CoCotest testing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:04.706 A:middle
I'm going to select under
other CoCotest testing.

00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:08.066 A:middle
And I'm going to
name this target.

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:12.866 A:middle
I'm going to call it
two just to be safe.

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:15.996 A:middle
And now we've noticed
a few things.

00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:17.606 A:middle
We see a new group here.

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:21.976 A:middle
Inside of that, we see
a template test file

00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:26.886 A:middle
and if we look at the
scheme, we'll also notice

00:11:27.316 --> 00:11:32.306 A:middle
that under the test action, we
have this one that I removed

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:34.596 A:middle
but more importantly,
we have this new one

00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:37.696 A:middle
that just got added.

00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:40.826 A:middle
So there's a few
template methods in here.

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:44.016 A:middle
I'm just going to remove
these so we can start clean

00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:45.126 A:middle
and build our test out.

00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:47.736 A:middle
So the first thing, to recap,

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.386 A:middle
what I want to do
is write a test

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:50.966 A:middle
for this operation subclass.

00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:53.716 A:middle
So I'm going to import
the header

00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:56.336 A:middle
so that I can access the APIs.

00:11:56.336 --> 00:12:01.056 A:middle
The next thing to do is I'm
going to add a test method.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:56.336 --> 00:12:01.056 A:middle
The next thing to do is I'm
going to add a test method.

00:12:01.796 --> 00:12:03.576 A:middle
And just to reiterate
from earlier,

00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:05.056 A:middle
this method returns void.

00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:10.356 A:middle
It is prefixed with test and
there are no other parameters.

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:13.916 A:middle
The rest of the name is just
a name that I've come up with

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:18.916 A:middle
that to me represents
what this test is for.

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:21.676 A:middle
Now, I like to sometimes
go through

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:23.596 A:middle
and outline the steps
I'm going to take

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:25.586 A:middle
as comments before
I write the code.

00:12:25.586 --> 00:12:26.976 A:middle
It helps me organize
my thoughts.

00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:30.736 A:middle
So just hear the summary of
what the test is going to do.

00:12:31.276 --> 00:12:35.346 A:middle
We're going to get a URL to
a resource and that's going

00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
to be a resource of XML
data that's in the bundle.

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.146 A:middle
We're going to load
that into memory.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:44.306 A:middle
We're going to create the parse
operation then we'll run the

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.716 A:middle
operation directly.

00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:48.986 A:middle
And finally, we'll check
the number of earthquakes

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.066 A:middle
and see if it's correct.

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:53.846 A:middle
So if I'm going to get a
resource to the bundle,

00:12:53.846 --> 00:12:55.646 A:middle
I need to add the file.

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:59.196 A:middle
Well, I've had this
file here that is,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:10.676 A:middle
let's see, I'm going
to copy this file

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.096 A:middle
into my project as a resource.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.716 A:middle
I'll copy it in.

00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:21.286 A:middle
And this is just some data
that I downloaded in advance

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:23.716 A:middle
because I want to take the
network out of the equation

00:13:23.716 --> 00:13:24.696 A:middle
when I write my tests.

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.576 A:middle
There's nothing wrong
with testing the network

00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:29.986 A:middle
but in general if you keep your
tests simpler, when they fail,

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.896 A:middle
it'll be easier to figure
out why they failed.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:33.996 A:middle
So in this test,
I'm not interested

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:35.416 A:middle
in validating if
the network works.

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:37.296 A:middle
I'm validating the
parsing works.

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:42.386 A:middle
So by having this in my bundle,
I eliminate that as a concern.

00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:47.726 A:middle
So to get the URL, I'm
going to go into the bundle

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:52.976 A:middle
and get a resource URL
and then the next thing

00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:56.746 A:middle
that I do is just load
that as an NSData.

00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:00.256 A:middle
The next step is to
create the parse operation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:00.256 A:middle
The next step is to
create the parse operation.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:04.246 A:middle
So that is the class that
we are trying to test here.

00:14:04.246 --> 00:14:07.626 A:middle
I'm going to create it with
this data and I'm not going

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:10.036 A:middle
to set a Delegate because in
this test, I don't need to.

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:13.666 A:middle
The next thing is to run
the operation directly.

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:16.396 A:middle
Now, we know that
NSOperation is designed

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:17.496 A:middle
to be run in the background.

00:14:17.786 --> 00:14:20.556 A:middle
But operations allow you
to invoke them directly

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:22.816 A:middle
and synchronously by
just calling start.

00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:25.846 A:middle
That means when we call
start, it's going to run

00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:28.526 A:middle
and when we return,
it's finished running.

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:33.146 A:middle
So at that point, I can
check the results and see

00:14:33.496 --> 00:14:35.206 A:middle
if they are what I expected.

00:14:35.836 --> 00:14:38.206 A:middle
Now, I have zero here.

00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:42.056 A:middle
I actually know that there
is more than zero but I'd

00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:44.296 A:middle
like to run this and let
you see what a failure looks

00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:45.886 A:middle
like before we go any further.

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:49.666 A:middle
So I'm hitting Command-U
to run the test.

00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:55.526 A:middle
It ran quickly and you can
see here's this message,

00:14:55.646 --> 00:15:01.286 A:middle
parse operation zero failed,
55 is not equal to zero.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:55.646 --> 00:15:01.286 A:middle
parse operation zero failed,
55 is not equal to zero.

00:15:01.286 --> 00:15:05.866 A:middle
Okay, so there are 55
earthquakes in there.

00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:08.966 A:middle
So let's run this again.

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:12.736 A:middle
And now we've passed our test.

00:15:12.736 --> 00:15:15.866 A:middle
And again you see that
same pass indicator there

00:15:15.866 --> 00:15:21.396 A:middle
in the Test Navigator and we
see it here in the Test Log

00:15:22.216 --> 00:15:24.016 A:middle
that we parsed and succeeded.

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:27.466 A:middle
So that's what it takes
to add test to a project.

00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:29.956 A:middle
We created a new test
target and then we go in

00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:31.126 A:middle
and we added the test code.

00:15:31.126 --> 00:15:34.166 A:middle
We create test methods
and we used the assertions

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.236 A:middle
to validate the state
that we expect.

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:39.056 A:middle
So I'm going to switch
back to slides now.

00:15:40.426 --> 00:15:43.696 A:middle
Okay, so let's get on to
what's new in Xcode 6.

00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:46.616 A:middle
We have new APIs and
improvements to our tools.

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:50.706 A:middle
So the first thing I want

00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:54.826 A:middle
to mention is we've added
some improvements that help

00:15:54.826 --> 00:15:56.376 A:middle
with the compatibility story.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.856 A:middle
And I'll get into more detail
but this basically means

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:03.656 A:middle
which versions of our OS
you can target using XCTest.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:03.656 A:middle
which versions of our OS
you can target using XCTest.

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
We've also added instruments
integration for tests

00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:10.656 A:middle
and Brooke will talk to you
more about that later on.

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:15.386 A:middle
Finally, we've got new APIs
and as I mentioned earlier,

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:17.816 A:middle
these are both for
asynchronous testing

00:16:17.816 --> 00:16:19.266 A:middle
and for performance testing.

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:24.226 A:middle
So first, XCTest on
older iOS versions.

00:16:24.896 --> 00:16:27.096 A:middle
Originally XCTest
shipped and it was part

00:16:27.096 --> 00:16:28.746 A:middle
of the iOS release itself.

00:16:29.066 --> 00:16:31.936 A:middle
So it meant when we shipped
it, you could only run it

00:16:32.206 --> 00:16:34.496 A:middle
on versions of iOS that had it.

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:35.816 A:middle
We've changed now.

00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:38.696 A:middle
Now we're shipping
XCTest with Xcode itself.

00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:42.416 A:middle
So this means that as we
add new features to XCTest,

00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:45.066 A:middle
you don't have to worry about
whether or not they're going

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:46.946 A:middle
to be available where
you're running your tests

00:16:46.946 --> 00:16:48.436 A:middle
because you're always
going to be testing

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:50.336 A:middle
with the current version
that's in the Xcode.

00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:56.656 A:middle
And this also means that we can
target older versions of iOS.

00:16:56.656 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
So anywhere that Xcode supports,
XCTest will also support.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:56.656 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
So anywhere that Xcode supports,
XCTest will also support.

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:03.376 A:middle
And this means iOS 6 and later.

00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:12.046 A:middle
So that's probably a good
time to just mention OCUnit

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:16.336 A:middle
which is the legacy technology
that XCTest was derived from.

00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:21.086 A:middle
In Xcode 5.1, we
deprecated OCUnit.

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:23.116 A:middle
We're not adding new features

00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:28.606 A:middle
and we really think the time
is now to move to XCTest

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:32.076 A:middle
because we've added new features
to it, integration is better

00:17:32.466 --> 00:17:37.136 A:middle
and OCUnit is no longer where
we're focusing our energies.

00:17:39.566 --> 00:17:42.626 A:middle
If you have existing targets
that you want to switch

00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:45.646 A:middle
from XCTest, we recommend
you use a migrator

00:17:45.646 --> 00:17:46.976 A:middle
in Xcode to do so.

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:50.356 A:middle
The reason for this
and also to do this,

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:51.846 A:middle
you just go to the Edit menu

00:17:51.846 --> 00:17:54.656 A:middle
and select Refactor,
Convert to XCTest.

00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:58.106 A:middle
And it will update the
project settings and also all

00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:00.506 A:middle
of your test classes
will get updated.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:00.506 A:middle
of your test classes
will get updated.

00:18:02.256 --> 00:18:04.406 A:middle
The reason for this is
some of the build settings

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:07.246 A:middle
that are associated with
this are not accessible

00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:08.306 A:middle
in the Xcode UI.

00:18:08.706 --> 00:18:11.426 A:middle
So some people in
the past have tried

00:18:11.426 --> 00:18:14.776 A:middle
to do the migration manually
and you know, you end up --

00:18:14.776 --> 00:18:17.596 A:middle
you're not able to
do it 100% by hand.

00:18:18.136 --> 00:18:20.886 A:middle
If you are, if you really
do want to do it yourself,

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:25.016 A:middle
there's a different way which is
just to create a new test target

00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.696 A:middle
which is guaranteed to have
exactly the right settings

00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:30.386 A:middle
and just move your existing
tests into it manually.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:35.606 A:middle
So now, let's talk about
Asynchronous Testing,

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:38.216 A:middle
one of our new APIs in Xcode 6.

00:18:39.376 --> 00:18:40.356 A:middle
So more and more APIs

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:43.436 A:middle
on our platform themselves
are asynchronous.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:46.566 A:middle
They have block invocations
when they're done

00:18:46.896 --> 00:18:48.696 A:middle
that may get run in
different queues.

00:18:49.236 --> 00:18:50.616 A:middle
They have Delegate callbacks

00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:52.636 A:middle
that may be deferred
by the [inaudible].

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.956 A:middle
They may make network requests

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:57.706 A:middle
which we absolutely know should
be handled asynchronously.

00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:00.506 A:middle
Or they're doing
background processing


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:00.506 A:middle
Or they're doing
background processing

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.206 A:middle
like our NSOperation here.

00:19:03.026 --> 00:19:04.986 A:middle
So this creates a challenge

00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:08.416 A:middle
because tests themselves
run synchronously.

00:19:08.886 --> 00:19:12.186 A:middle
And so, to help you with
that, we've added APIs

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:16.486 A:middle
that will allow you to create
asynchronous control flow

00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:19.336 A:middle
that manages asynchronous
activities.

00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:23.476 A:middle
And we do this what we
call expectation objects

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:27.056 A:middle
and these describe events
in your test that you expect

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:29.846 A:middle
to happen at some
point in the future,

00:19:30.146 --> 00:19:31.456 A:middle
hopefully not too distant.

00:19:32.646 --> 00:19:38.176 A:middle
With these objects, XCTest
has an API that would wait

00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:39.416 A:middle
for them to be fulfilled.

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:42.286 A:middle
And that takes a timeout

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.466 A:middle
and a completion handler
that's called either

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:48.256 A:middle
when the timeout hits or when
all the events are fulfilled.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.186 A:middle
And you can be waiting

00:19:49.186 --> 00:19:52.336 A:middle
on multiple asynchronous
events at the same time.

00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:55.286 A:middle
So let's look at a code example.

00:19:56.266 --> 00:20:00.956 A:middle
UIDocument, as you may know, has
a open with completion handler.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:56.266 --> 00:20:00.956 A:middle
UIDocument, as you may know, has
a open with completion handler.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:03.666 A:middle
There's an asynchronous
opening and that's great

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:06.466 A:middle
because if a large document
might take a little bit of time

00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.466 A:middle
to open and you don't want

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:11.416 A:middle
to stall the user's interactive
experience while you're waiting

00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:11.806 A:middle
for that.

00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:14.166 A:middle
So let's write a test for that.

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.256 A:middle
The first thing I do is
I create an expectation.

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:20.006 A:middle
And these expectation
creation methods take a string

00:20:20.006 --> 00:20:22.486 A:middle
which is simply a
description for your benefit.

00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:24.706 A:middle
It tells you if we
had a timeout,

00:20:25.556 --> 00:20:27.476 A:middle
it tells you what
we were waiting for.

00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:29.726 A:middle
And so the more descriptive
you make that,

00:20:29.836 --> 00:20:33.046 A:middle
the easier your life will be.

00:20:33.756 --> 00:20:36.846 A:middle
Then we create a document
which I'm not showing here.

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:38.846 A:middle
And we call the
openwithCompletionHandler.

00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:41.076 A:middle
And you notice I haven't filled
out the CompletionHandler.

00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:42.926 A:middle
It's just an empty
block at this point.

00:20:44.356 --> 00:20:45.476 A:middle
We'll get back to
it in a moment.

00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:48.476 A:middle
And then finally, I
call waitForExpectations

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:49.896 A:middle
with a 5-second timeout.

00:20:50.276 --> 00:20:54.296 A:middle
Probably a little on the long
side but just to be safe here.

00:20:54.736 --> 00:20:57.046 A:middle
So what we have now
is asynchronous flow.

00:20:57.046 --> 00:21:00.616 A:middle
We have create expectation,
set up the document,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.046 --> 00:21:00.616 A:middle
We have create expectation,
set up the document,

00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:03.386 A:middle
open it and then wait.

00:21:03.736 --> 00:21:05.636 A:middle
And this is asynchronous
flow within the test.

00:21:05.856 --> 00:21:10.156 A:middle
Asynchronously later, that
block will be called back.

00:21:10.156 --> 00:21:12.136 A:middle
Inside the handler, I'm
going to do two things.

00:21:12.136 --> 00:21:13.666 A:middle
I'm going to use
one of our asserts

00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:16.546 A:middle
to validate this
opening was successful.

00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:20.896 A:middle
On top of that, I'm going
to call expectation fulfill

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:23.946 A:middle
which will cause the
waitForExpectations to return

00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:24.816 A:middle
because now all

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.626 A:middle
of the expectations I have
created have been fulfilled.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:32.716 A:middle
So let's see what that
looks like if we add

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:34.976 A:middle
that to our seismic XML tests.

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:49.606 A:middle
Okay, so we go back to our test.

00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:50.756 A:middle
It's right here.

00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:57.066 A:middle
And the first thing we do is I'm
going to just rename this to,

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.516 A:middle
let's say,
ParsingInTheBackground


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.356 --> 00:22:06.926 A:middle
because that's closer to our
actual real-world usage anyway.

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:10.106 A:middle
So the first part of
the test stays the same.

00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:10.776 A:middle
We're still going to use

00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
that same resource file,
load it into memory.

00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:19.116 A:middle
Now before we create our parse
operation, we'll need to --

00:22:19.116 --> 00:22:21.066 A:middle
this is where things are
going to change a little bit.

00:22:21.196 --> 00:22:26.656 A:middle
So if you think about
it, we have here,

00:22:26.656 --> 00:22:28.646 A:middle
we're running the parse
operation directly.

00:22:29.256 --> 00:22:34.126 A:middle
Instead of that, let's run
it in an OperationQueue.

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:37.376 A:middle
So that looks like
create an OperationQueue

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.406 A:middle
and add the operation to it.

00:22:39.406 --> 00:22:42.056 A:middle
And that means the
operation is going

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.856 A:middle
to start running
immediately but it's going

00:22:43.856 --> 00:22:45.276 A:middle
to do so in the background.

00:22:46.336 --> 00:22:48.146 A:middle
Now if I leave the test as is,

00:22:48.876 --> 00:22:51.326 A:middle
because that running is
happening in the background

00:22:52.136 --> 00:22:54.046 A:middle
and our tests are
just continuing on,

00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:55.386 A:middle
it's not stopping or waiting.

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:56.776 A:middle
It's just ready to go.

00:22:57.256 --> 00:23:00.606 A:middle
If we run this test now,
what we're going to see is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.256 --> 00:23:00.606 A:middle
If we run this test now,
what we're going to see is

00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:02.186 A:middle
that we failed because
at the point

00:23:02.186 --> 00:23:05.066 A:middle
where we're evaluating
this, parsing isn't done.

00:23:05.226 --> 00:23:06.686 A:middle
It's off in the background
somewhere

00:23:06.686 --> 00:23:09.086 A:middle
and we don't know
whether it's finished yet.

00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:12.746 A:middle
So what we want to
do is wait for it

00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:15.896 A:middle
to be finished before we check.

00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:18.796 A:middle
And I'm just using a
2-second timeout here.

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:22.126 A:middle
These timeouts are
largely at your discretion.

00:23:22.446 --> 00:23:26.226 A:middle
If you make them really, really
small then you may have cases

00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:28.146 A:middle
where something takes
a little longer to run

00:23:28.146 --> 00:23:30.546 A:middle
and you get a failure
that's not really a failure.

00:23:30.856 --> 00:23:34.936 A:middle
So those are just kind
of at your discretion.

00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:39.276 A:middle
So now, we can wait
but before we wait,

00:23:39.276 --> 00:23:41.216 A:middle
we also need an expectation

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:43.126 A:middle
that describes what
we're waiting for.

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:46.496 A:middle
So think about the operation.

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:47.546 A:middle
How do we know it's done?

00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
Well, it has this Delegate
API with callbacks.

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:51.816 A:middle
So let's look at what
those were like again.

00:23:52.126 --> 00:23:56.826 A:middle
So ParseOperation, the Delegate
callbacks, we have DidParse,

00:23:57.586 --> 00:23:59.886 A:middle
DidFinish, DidFailWithError.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:02.646 A:middle
Well, DidFinish looks
like exactly what I want.

00:24:02.826 --> 00:24:07.076 A:middle
So going back into my test, if
I'm going to be the Delegate,

00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:10.856 A:middle
I need my test itself to conform
to the Delegate Protocol.

00:24:11.346 --> 00:24:16.036 A:middle
And then I need to implement
the DidFinish method.

00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:20.896 A:middle
Now inside that, I'm going
to operate on some kind

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:22.986 A:middle
of expectation and report
that it's fulfilled.

00:24:22.986 --> 00:24:26.456 A:middle
But since we're here and we're
not in the same context here,

00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:30.066 A:middle
we'll need to track that
operation as a property.

00:24:30.066 --> 00:24:35.886 A:middle
So we'll just add an expectation
property to our test.

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:39.246 A:middle
We'll set it up before we
create the ParseOperation.

00:24:39.586 --> 00:24:41.636 A:middle
So we've created
our expectation.

00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:43.926 A:middle
"Parsing finished" is what
we're calling it here.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:50.486 A:middle
And then inside our
operation, we will fulfill it.

00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:51.616 A:middle
So let's just run this.

00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:53.216 A:middle
Now, secret.

00:24:53.216 --> 00:24:55.546 A:middle
This is actually going to fail
because I've left something

00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:58.586 A:middle
out intentionally but I want
you to see what failure looks

00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.676 A:middle
like when we hit a timeout.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.676 A:middle
like when we hit a timeout.

00:25:00.926 --> 00:25:04.836 A:middle
And asynchronous wait failed.

00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:06.736 A:middle
Exceeded timeout of 2 seconds

00:25:06.736 --> 00:25:09.626 A:middle
with unfulfilled
expectations "parsing finished".

00:25:09.856 --> 00:25:12.696 A:middle
So we never fulfilled
our expectation.

00:25:12.826 --> 00:25:14.746 A:middle
Well, the reason
is pretty simple.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:18.276 A:middle
I forgot actually to say that
this object is the delegate.

00:25:19.176 --> 00:25:22.366 A:middle
So once we hook that
up, we run again.

00:25:23.136 --> 00:25:26.706 A:middle
This time, everything passes
because we get the callback,

00:25:26.706 --> 00:25:31.316 A:middle
we fulfill the expectation, we
unwind from the wait and then

00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:34.406 A:middle
when we evaluate the number of
parsed earthquakes, it's 55.

00:25:35.376 --> 00:25:39.736 A:middle
So just walking through this
again, we used an expectation

00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:41.956 A:middle
to describe a future event.

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:46.286 A:middle
We wait for the expectation
here.

00:25:46.286 --> 00:25:50.076 A:middle
And then when that event
occurs, which in this case is

00:25:50.076 --> 00:25:52.946 A:middle
in a delegate callback that
could be inside a block handler

00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:55.276 A:middle
or some other context,
we fulfill it.

00:25:55.716 --> 00:25:57.256 A:middle
That causes wait to return.

00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:01.046 A:middle
So this allows us to handle
an asynchronous activity

00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:01.046 A:middle
So this allows us to handle
an asynchronous activity

00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:02.636 A:middle
in a synchronous fashion.

00:26:03.426 --> 00:26:04.576 A:middle
It's fine for testing.

00:26:05.216 --> 00:26:07.176 A:middle
I wouldn't recommend you
do this on the main thread

00:26:07.176 --> 00:26:08.286 A:middle
of your application
code [laughter].

00:26:09.086 --> 00:26:12.266 A:middle
Okay, so let's switch back.

00:26:13.256 --> 00:26:19.426 A:middle
So that's what it looks like
to write an asynchronous test

00:26:19.796 --> 00:26:21.946 A:middle
with the new APIs in Xcode 6.

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:26.916 A:middle
Now, Brooke's going to talk to
you about performance testing.

00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:30.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:31.246 --> 00:26:32.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Will.

00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:35.696 A:middle
So it can be easy to introduce
performance regressions

00:26:35.696 --> 00:26:36.166 A:middle
in your code.

00:26:37.176 --> 00:26:40.536 A:middle
And historically, finding these
issues can be time consuming

00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
and expensive because you need

00:26:41.676 --> 00:26:44.756 A:middle
to manually use your
application to find them.

00:26:44.866 --> 00:26:46.156 A:middle
Now Apple has some great tools

00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:47.836 A:middle
for investigating
performance issues.

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:51.596 A:middle
And performance testing
is just a way to tell you

00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:52.776 A:middle
when to do that investigation.

00:26:56.416 --> 00:26:59.516 A:middle
So we'll look at some
new APIs that we've added

00:26:59.516 --> 00:27:02.386 A:middle
to help you measure performance
and detect regressions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.516 --> 00:27:02.386 A:middle
to help you measure performance
and detect regressions.

00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:05.826 A:middle
We'll also see how
the measurements

00:27:05.826 --> 00:27:08.346 A:middle
that these APIs make
to our surface

00:27:08.346 --> 00:27:12.796 A:middle
and Xcode UI including
those test failures due

00:27:12.796 --> 00:27:13.766 A:middle
to regressions.

00:27:14.626 --> 00:27:18.086 A:middle
And now that Xcode is going to
be reporting performance issues

00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:21.466 A:middle
as failures, it ought to
give you an easy way to do

00:27:21.466 --> 00:27:23.676 A:middle
that investigation so you
can now profile your test

00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:24.346 A:middle
with Instruments.

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:29.896 A:middle
The easiest way to do this is
to use the new measureBlock API.

00:27:30.246 --> 00:27:31.416 A:middle
This takes a block of code

00:27:31.936 --> 00:27:36.716 A:middle
and runs it 10 times measuring
the duration each time

00:27:37.976 --> 00:27:39.336 A:middle
and showing the results
in Xcode.

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:48.486 A:middle
So for example, I've got a
test here that I'm writing

00:27:48.486 --> 00:27:50.976 A:middle
that I want to measure
the performance

00:27:50.976 --> 00:27:51.816 A:middle
of using a fileHandle.

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:53.836 A:middle
So I'll call self measureBlock

00:27:54.936 --> 00:27:55.996 A:middle
and then the code
I want to measure.

00:27:56.376 --> 00:27:58.356 A:middle
It's creating a fileHandle,
using it

00:27:58.356 --> 00:27:59.546 A:middle
and then closing the fileHandle.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:04.296 --> 00:28:06.816 A:middle
Now that I've got this test,
I'm going to want to profile it

00:28:07.316 --> 00:28:09.086 A:middle
in the case that Xcode tells
me something went wrong.

00:28:10.176 --> 00:28:13.246 A:middle
And you can do this from Xcode
Source Editor or Test Navigator

00:28:13.736 --> 00:28:15.076 A:middle
from their context menus.

00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:23.946 A:middle
And there's also a Command for
this under the Product menu.

00:28:24.326 --> 00:28:27.756 A:middle
It's important to keep in mind
that when you profile your test,

00:28:28.046 --> 00:28:29.916 A:middle
this uses settings from
the Scheme Profile Action.

00:28:32.226 --> 00:28:34.946 A:middle
The most obvious
difference here is

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.656 A:middle
that when you're just
running your test

00:28:36.856 --> 00:28:38.856 A:middle
that it uses a Debug
configuration by default.

00:28:39.226 --> 00:28:41.316 A:middle
But Profiling will use
a Release configuration

00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:43.686 A:middle
and there may be some
difference in behavior there.

00:28:44.626 --> 00:28:47.856 A:middle
Let's take a look at the demo.

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:50.466 A:middle
So here, I have a Mac
version of the project

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.296 A:middle
that Will showed you earlier.

00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:54.016 A:middle
And I've already got
a couple of tests

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:55.616 A:middle
that used the measureBlock API.

00:28:55.616 --> 00:28:56.926 A:middle
I'm just going to
run my test now.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:07.766 A:middle
So I don't know if you can see
this, but Xcode is telling me

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:11.146 A:middle
that this test is doing 4000%
worse than it did before.

00:29:11.676 --> 00:29:13.876 A:middle
So that's not so great.

00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:19.456 A:middle
So how am I going to figure
out what's gone wrong here?

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:22.046 A:middle
I could look at the test
itself to see, you know,

00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:24.016 A:middle
is there anything obvious
that the test is doing wrong?

00:29:24.016 --> 00:29:27.396 A:middle
Well, it appears to be loading
its file from the test bundle.

00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:33.026 A:middle
Parsing it and then validating
that the earthquakes are right.

00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:34.816 A:middle
I could look and see if
there are any local changes

00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.496 A:middle
in my project?

00:29:36.906 --> 00:29:37.466 A:middle
No, there aren't.

00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:40.886 A:middle
I could look and see
how this test compares

00:29:40.886 --> 00:29:42.296 A:middle
to all the other
tests in my project.

00:29:43.086 --> 00:29:45.346 A:middle
And actually, this one's
doing a little bit --

00:29:45.346 --> 00:29:48.716 A:middle
this one's doing bad but the
other one's doing a lot better.

00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:52.556 A:middle
So it looks like I'm just
going to have to profile it.

00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:55.176 A:middle
And I can do that by
right-clicking on this button

00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:56.936 A:middle
in the Source Editor
and selecting Profile

00:29:58.116 --> 00:30:03.446 A:middle
or I can also do that from the
Test Navigator by right-clicking


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.116 --> 00:30:03.446 A:middle
or I can also do that from the
Test Navigator by right-clicking

00:30:03.446 --> 00:30:05.976 A:middle
on my test and selecting
Profile.

00:30:10.736 --> 00:30:12.886 A:middle
I'll select Time
Profile from Instruments

00:30:13.776 --> 00:30:14.886 A:middle
and I'll click Record.

00:30:15.646 --> 00:30:21.086 A:middle
Now, Instruments has
launched my application

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.436 A:middle
and it's run my tests
and it's done.

00:30:23.506 --> 00:30:26.166 A:middle
So I'll zoom in a bit
so you can see this.

00:30:27.036 --> 00:30:32.726 A:middle
I'm just going to invert the
call tree and expand this.

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
And from here, I can see
my test is being called.

00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:42.526 A:middle
XCTest is eventually calling
the block that I've given it

00:30:43.346 --> 00:30:44.866 A:middle
and it's calling this
validateProperties

00:30:44.866 --> 00:30:46.596 A:middle
which is calling some
really expensive function.

00:30:46.716 --> 00:30:48.256 A:middle
Well, it's finding
out what I want.

00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:51.346 A:middle
So let's look into that.

00:30:51.606 --> 00:30:53.616 A:middle
I'm going to right-click
on validateProperties

00:30:53.616 --> 00:30:58.866 A:middle
and use Reveal on
Xcode and zoom out.

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:00.196 A:middle
Yeah, yeah.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:00.196 A:middle
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:00.196 --> 00:31:01.056 A:middle
It is expensive.

00:31:01.086 --> 00:31:04.416 A:middle
Okay, so let's just
get rid of this.

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:07.736 A:middle
I'm just going to delete
that and run my test again.

00:31:11.676 --> 00:31:13.556 A:middle
And it [inaudible], great.

00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:17.686 A:middle
So what you've just seen is you
can use a new measureBlock API

00:31:18.056 --> 00:31:20.506 A:middle
to measure performance
and detect regressions.

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:23.526 A:middle
You can view these results
in the Source Editor

00:31:23.526 --> 00:31:26.506 A:middle
and the Test Report and you
can also Profile your test

00:31:27.126 --> 00:31:27.786 A:middle
with Instruments.

00:31:28.236 --> 00:31:30.646 A:middle
So you've just gotten a taste

00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:32.746 A:middle
of how Performance
Testing works with Xcode.

00:31:32.746 --> 00:31:34.496 A:middle
Now let's go into details.

00:31:34.666 --> 00:31:36.106 A:middle
First of all, setting Baselines.

00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:40.026 A:middle
For XCTest to report a test as
failing due to a regression,

00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:41.916 A:middle
it needs a fixed point
to compare against.

00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:43.536 A:middle
And the Baselines
lets us do that.

00:31:44.116 --> 00:31:47.336 A:middle
And the Standard Deviation,

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.336 A:middle
XCTest should only report
performance regression

00:31:51.336 --> 00:31:52.726 A:middle
when something's
actually gotten worse.

00:31:53.866 --> 00:31:57.096 A:middle
XCTest uses Standard Deviation
to determine the spread

00:31:57.096 --> 00:31:59.266 A:middle
of the measurements, to tell
us how reliable they are.

00:31:59.976 --> 00:32:03.056 A:middle
And finally, measuring
precisely.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.976 --> 00:32:03.056 A:middle
And finally, measuring
precisely.

00:32:03.356 --> 00:32:04.396 A:middle
We have some additional APIs

00:32:04.396 --> 00:32:06.576 A:middle
that let you be even
more precise

00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:07.566 A:middle
about what you want to measure.

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:11.426 A:middle
So let's look at the Baselines.

00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:13.816 A:middle
The Baseline is the
Average from a previous run

00:32:13.816 --> 00:32:16.306 A:middle
that you've specifically
selected for comparison.

00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:20.606 A:middle
Once you've set a Baseline,
XCTest will use this

00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:21.856 A:middle
to detect regressions.

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:27.906 A:middle
It will fail a test if the
new Average has increased

00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:29.746 A:middle
from the Baseline
Average by 10% or more

00:32:30.736 --> 00:32:32.586 A:middle
and it will ignore
regressions of less

00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:33.436 A:middle
than a tenth of a second.

00:32:34.016 --> 00:32:36.346 A:middle
This is to eliminate a
source of false positives.

00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:41.496 A:middle
The Baselines are stored in the
source where you commit them

00:32:41.496 --> 00:32:43.946 A:middle
to your repository and show
them on routine numbers.

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.966 A:middle
And they're stored per
device configuration.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:50.946 A:middle
So when I run tests on my
iPhone 5S, they're going

00:32:50.946 --> 00:32:52.296 A:middle
to be using the same Baselines

00:32:52.576 --> 00:32:57.166 A:middle
that when Will runs the same
test on his iPhone 5S are used.

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:01.676 A:middle
But at the same time, if
I were to run these tests


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:01.676 A:middle
But at the same time, if
I were to run these tests

00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:05.996 A:middle
in a simulated iPhone 5S, it
would not use those Baselines

00:33:05.996 --> 00:33:07.676 A:middle
because that would be a
different device configuration.

00:33:11.476 --> 00:33:14.526 A:middle
So let's talk about how you
set the Baselines with Xcode.

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:18.326 A:middle
The first time I run a test,
I'm going to see an annotation

00:33:18.326 --> 00:33:21.316 A:middle
like this with this gray
diamond with a white dot

00:33:21.316 --> 00:33:23.656 A:middle
on it telling me there's
no Baseline for the test.

00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:27.806 A:middle
And that lets me know that it
didn't do any comparison at all

00:33:28.036 --> 00:33:30.236 A:middle
and it's just showing
me the average

00:33:30.506 --> 00:33:34.136 A:middle
that the time that
the test took.

00:33:34.526 --> 00:33:35.856 A:middle
If I click on that annotation,

00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:37.996 A:middle
I'll get the performance
result to pop over.

00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:39.316 A:middle
And I can get this
from the Source Editor

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:40.506 A:middle
or from the new Test Report.

00:33:41.406 --> 00:33:43.516 A:middle
From here I can see the
current average from the test

00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:46.106 A:middle
and I can also see how the
individual measurements

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:48.056 A:middle
that were taken differ
from that average.

00:33:48.456 --> 00:33:49.366 A:middle
So here I can see

00:33:50.176 --> 00:33:53.266 A:middle
that measurement number
8 was the longest one.

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:58.096 A:middle
Now when I'm running too,
I can click Set Baseline

00:33:58.176 --> 00:34:01.636 A:middle
and Xcode will use, will
copy the current average


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.176 --> 00:34:01.636 A:middle
and Xcode will use, will
copy the current average

00:34:01.796 --> 00:34:02.456 A:middle
to the Baseline.

00:34:02.936 --> 00:34:13.755 A:middle
And if I need to set this
again, I can click Edit

00:34:14.505 --> 00:34:18.286 A:middle
and either accept the new
current average or type

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:20.266 A:middle
in whatever I want
as the Baseline

00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:24.866 A:middle
and I can also edit the maximum
Standard Deviation from here.

00:34:25.376 --> 00:34:28.706 A:middle
In order to set the Baseline,
the next time I run my test,

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:31.866 A:middle
I'll see a different annotation
with this gray diamond

00:34:31.866 --> 00:34:33.186 A:middle
with the checkmark in it.

00:34:33.186 --> 00:34:36.466 A:middle
And it's telling me that
this test is doing 4% worse

00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:38.096 A:middle
than the Baseline that
it's compared against.

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:44.985 A:middle
If the test were to do a lot
worse, the test would fail

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:48.376 A:middle
and I'd get an annotation like
this telling me that, you know,

00:34:48.596 --> 00:34:50.346 A:middle
it's 68% worse in this case.

00:34:50.866 --> 00:34:56.866 A:middle
And I can also see these results
from that new Test Report.

00:34:57.446 --> 00:34:59.546 A:middle
Also from the Test Report,
I can get the performances

00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:02.756 A:middle
that will pop over by
clicking under the time call


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:02.756 A:middle
that will pop over by
clicking under the time call

00:35:02.866 --> 00:35:03.646 A:middle
on those measurements.

00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:10.316 A:middle
If you want to get the
raw values that Xcode gets

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:11.576 A:middle
from XCTest, those are available

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.136 A:middle
on the logs tab of
the Test Report.

00:35:14.606 --> 00:35:19.826 A:middle
So let's talk about how XCTest
uses the Baseline Average.

00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:24.166 A:middle
Here I have a dataset
from one run of a test.

00:35:24.796 --> 00:35:27.426 A:middle
There are 10 measurements for
the 10 indications of the block.

00:35:28.146 --> 00:35:31.016 A:middle
And they're all -- it comes
around that 1-second mark

00:35:31.936 --> 00:35:33.096 A:middle
with a 1-second average.

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:38.806 A:middle
I'll set the Baseline for my
test which fixes that in place.

00:35:39.506 --> 00:35:42.856 A:middle
Now the next time I run my
test, if I were to get a dataset

00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:45.946 A:middle
like this, the average would
be 1 second at 1.5 seconds

00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:50.786 A:middle
and the test would fail because
that 1.5 seconds is well outside

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:52.666 A:middle
the balance of the
allowed 10% regression.

00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:55.816 A:middle
So XCTest is going
to fail the test

00:35:56.386 --> 00:35:59.686 A:middle
if the new average has increased
from the Baseline by more

00:35:59.686 --> 00:36:02.106 A:middle
than 10% but it's going
to ignore regressions less


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.686 --> 00:36:02.106 A:middle
than 10% but it's going
to ignore regressions less

00:36:02.106 --> 00:36:03.126 A:middle
than a tenth of a second.

00:36:05.126 --> 00:36:06.776 A:middle
But is the average enough?

00:36:06.776 --> 00:36:10.376 A:middle
Let's look at that
same dataset again.

00:36:11.406 --> 00:36:14.196 A:middle
All the values come through on 1
second with a 1-second average.

00:36:16.276 --> 00:36:19.246 A:middle
If I were to run this test again
and get a dataset like this,

00:36:20.486 --> 00:36:21.506 A:middle
it hasn't really regressed.

00:36:21.506 --> 00:36:23.786 A:middle
The average is still 1 second
but there's some values

00:36:23.876 --> 00:36:26.376 A:middle
over 1.5 seconds and
some under 0.5 second.

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:30.946 A:middle
So it isn't a true regression
in terms of the average

00:36:30.986 --> 00:36:32.276 A:middle
but something's gotten worse.

00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:35.116 A:middle
There is something that if I
were to get a dataset like this,

00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.196 A:middle
I want it investigated.

00:36:36.926 --> 00:36:40.996 A:middle
So the average just doesn't
tell the whole story.

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:43.196 A:middle
And XCTest is going to
use the Standard Deviation

00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:45.636 A:middle
to indicate the spread
of the measurements.

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:51.116 A:middle
If we look at that first
dataset one more time,

00:36:51.766 --> 00:36:53.356 A:middle
we see that the Standard
Deviation is set

00:36:53.356 --> 00:36:55.576 A:middle
for these numbers tightly
[inaudible] around 1 second

00:36:55.576 --> 00:36:58.476 A:middle
at 6% while the Standard
Deviation

00:36:59.026 --> 00:37:02.266 A:middle
for the much more
spread-out dataset is 40%.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.026 --> 00:37:02.266 A:middle
for the much more
spread-out dataset is 40%.

00:37:02.886 --> 00:37:06.896 A:middle
And the way XCTest is
going to use this is

00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:13.446 A:middle
if the Standard Deviation for
the new dataset is more than 10%

00:37:13.446 --> 00:37:15.636 A:middle
of the current average,
which you can adjust

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:18.666 A:middle
from that popover, it will fail.

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:20.786 A:middle
But again, just like
the average,

00:37:21.556 --> 00:37:23.786 A:middle
it will ignore Standard
Deviation of less than a tenth

00:37:23.786 --> 00:37:28.806 A:middle
of a second, again, to
avoid false positives.

00:37:29.166 --> 00:37:31.946 A:middle
So what causes excessive
Standard Deviation?

00:37:33.466 --> 00:37:37.126 A:middle
Well, one thing is if the
body you're measuring is doing

00:37:37.126 --> 00:37:41.556 A:middle
network I/O or file I/O, that
tends to vary pretty wildly.

00:37:42.256 --> 00:37:48.796 A:middle
Another thing that can cause
high Standard Deviation is

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:51.976 A:middle
if the block just isn't trying
to do the same work each time.

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:55.626 A:middle
So for example, if the block
that's being measured does some

00:37:55.626 --> 00:37:58.946 A:middle
-- sets up some expensive global
state the first time through

00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:02.586 A:middle
and then never again or the
block might just be affected


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:02.586 A:middle
and then never again or the
block might just be affected

00:38:02.586 --> 00:38:03.866 A:middle
by an uninitialized variables.

00:38:04.856 --> 00:38:07.046 A:middle
And lastly, another thing

00:38:07.096 --> 00:38:10.686 A:middle
that can cause high
Standard Deviation is

00:38:10.686 --> 00:38:12.666 A:middle
if the system is just
busy with other processes

00:38:12.846 --> 00:38:17.596 A:middle
and short-running tests are
especially sensitive to this.

00:38:17.826 --> 00:38:21.166 A:middle
So how does XCTest
detect issues?

00:38:22.036 --> 00:38:24.646 A:middle
First of all, if there's no
Baseline Average, it's done.

00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:27.416 A:middle
It's not going to try and do any
analysis of the measurements.

00:38:28.216 --> 00:38:31.096 A:middle
If there is a Baseline Average,
first it will check to see

00:38:31.096 --> 00:38:33.866 A:middle
if that Standard Deviation is
more than a tenth of a second

00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:37.076 A:middle
and more than 10% of
the current average.

00:38:37.216 --> 00:38:39.476 A:middle
If it is, it'll fail for that.

00:38:39.476 --> 00:38:43.736 A:middle
Otherwise, it'll check to see if
the average is increased by more

00:38:43.736 --> 00:38:47.826 A:middle
than a tenth of a second and
more than 10% of the Baseline.

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:49.876 A:middle
And if it is, it'll
fail for that.

00:38:50.446 --> 00:38:52.346 A:middle
And otherwise, it'll pass.

00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:56.786 A:middle
So how can we minimize
Standard Deviation?

00:38:56.786 --> 00:39:00.156 A:middle
Well, one way is to only measure
the code that's important


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:56.786 --> 00:39:00.156 A:middle
Well, one way is to only measure
the code that's important

00:39:00.156 --> 00:39:00.286 A:middle
to you.

00:39:01.626 --> 00:39:04.596 A:middle
So let's look at how we can do
that with that previous example.

00:39:05.206 --> 00:39:08.926 A:middle
Here, this test is doing
the work of setting

00:39:08.926 --> 00:39:10.496 A:middle
up a FileHandle using it

00:39:10.496 --> 00:39:13.396 A:middle
and then closing the FileHandle
each time we run the block.

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:16.376 A:middle
But if I only want
to measure the time

00:39:16.376 --> 00:39:21.476 A:middle
of using the FileHandle, what I
might do is just move the set up

00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:23.346 A:middle
and tear down work
outside of the block.

00:39:24.286 --> 00:39:25.256 A:middle
But what if I can't do that?

00:39:25.936 --> 00:39:27.456 A:middle
Sometimes, the work
that you want

00:39:27.456 --> 00:39:29.876 A:middle
to measure requires some
set of work that needs

00:39:29.876 --> 00:39:31.646 A:middle
to be done each time
before the measurement.

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:34.206 A:middle
And for that, we have
some additional APIs;

00:39:35.066 --> 00:39:37.886 A:middle
measureMetrics automatically
start measuring with a block.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:39.716 A:middle
You can use this to
measure just part

00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:41.436 A:middle
of the block that's
being called.

00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:47.836 A:middle
This API expects an array
of metrics to measure

00:39:48.706 --> 00:39:50.686 A:middle
and currently only
time is supported.

00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:54.866 A:middle
We'll also need two more APIs,

00:39:54.866 --> 00:39:56.396 A:middle
startMeasuring and
stopMeasuring.

00:39:56.676 --> 00:39:58.206 A:middle
You can use these to
isolate what the part

00:39:58.206 --> 00:39:58.976 A:middle
of the block you
want to measure.

00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:02.826 A:middle
You can call these once
per block invocation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:02.826 A:middle
You can call these once
per block invocation.

00:40:04.256 --> 00:40:05.806 A:middle
And if you're going to
call startMeasuring,

00:40:05.806 --> 00:40:08.486 A:middle
you need to pass NO for
automatically startMeasuring.

00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:13.856 A:middle
So let's see how that would
work with our previous example.

00:40:15.736 --> 00:40:18.376 A:middle
First, we'd change the method

00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:22.456 A:middle
to call it measureMetrics
passing time as a metric and NO

00:40:22.456 --> 00:40:23.656 A:middle
for automatically
startMeasuring.

00:40:25.176 --> 00:40:27.926 A:middle
It calls startMeasuring right
before you use FileHandle

00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:29.486 A:middle
and stopMeasuring
immediately afterwards.

00:40:30.376 --> 00:40:33.066 A:middle
So now this block is
doing the work of setting

00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:35.726 A:middle
up the FileHandle and
turning it down each time

00:40:35.726 --> 00:40:38.816 A:middle
but it's only actually
measuring the duration spent

00:40:38.816 --> 00:40:39.716 A:middle
in UseFileHandle.

00:40:40.326 --> 00:40:43.906 A:middle
So let's look at
this in practice.

00:40:44.586 --> 00:40:46.626 A:middle
So despite the name of this
project, I'm actually thinking

00:40:46.626 --> 00:40:50.686 A:middle
about adding a JSON parser
to it and I've got a test

00:40:50.686 --> 00:40:55.886 A:middle
that I'm running here that's
loading this file from the web

00:40:57.296 --> 00:40:59.846 A:middle
and parsing it with
NSJSONSerialization.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.866 --> 00:41:02.366 A:middle
I think I'll actually
like to turn this

00:41:02.366 --> 00:41:05.666 A:middle
into a performance test
just for my own sake.

00:41:06.236 --> 00:41:11.016 A:middle
And I'll do that now
by calling measureBlock

00:41:11.846 --> 00:41:15.726 A:middle
and then pasting in the code.

00:41:15.936 --> 00:41:18.026 A:middle
And I'll click to run my test.

00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:27.186 A:middle
So here we can see that it took,
it says on average 1.91 seconds

00:41:27.416 --> 00:41:29.576 A:middle
with 114% Standard Deviation

00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:34.716 A:middle
and it's telling me there's no
Baseline Average for this test.

00:41:35.246 --> 00:41:37.056 A:middle
Well, that's not bad but I know

00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:38.586 A:middle
that since it's doing
this expensive work

00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:41.256 A:middle
of loading this file
from the web each time,

00:41:41.256 --> 00:41:42.436 A:middle
I actually don't
want to measure that.

00:41:42.436 --> 00:41:44.756 A:middle
I just want to measure the time
spent in NSJSONSerialization.

00:41:45.446 --> 00:41:47.236 A:middle
So what I'll do is
I'll delete this

00:41:47.326 --> 00:41:50.426 A:middle
and call measure
time measureMetrics

00:41:50.996 --> 00:41:54.816 A:middle
which is passing time
as my metric and NO

00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:55.896 A:middle
for automaticallyStartMeasuring.

00:41:57.366 --> 00:42:02.296 A:middle
Then all I need to do is call
startMeasuring right before


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:57.366 --> 00:42:02.296 A:middle
Then all I need to do is call
startMeasuring right before

00:42:02.396 --> 00:42:09.716 A:middle
NSJSONSerialization
and I can run my test.

00:42:09.896 --> 00:42:13.376 A:middle
Great! So previously, it
was taking 1.91 seconds

00:42:13.686 --> 00:42:15.486 A:middle
and now it appears to be
taking no time at all.

00:42:15.486 --> 00:42:19.356 A:middle
So that's pretty
good [laughter].

00:42:19.666 --> 00:42:26.256 A:middle
I wish all my APIs
were that quick.

00:42:28.076 --> 00:42:31.356 A:middle
But I actually want this to
measure something, you know,

00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:35.036 A:middle
something that Xcode will
report, something significant

00:42:35.036 --> 00:42:36.526 A:middle
so what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:42:36.526 --> 00:42:38.516 A:middle
to change this to
use a larger file.

00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:40.906 A:middle
So we actually get
some values here.

00:42:48.046 --> 00:42:49.276 A:middle
And it's not going to
take a little bit longer

00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:52.146 A:middle
because what it's actually
doing is it's going to --

00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:56.536 A:middle
you're calling this block
10 times, loading the file

00:42:56.536 --> 00:42:59.986 A:middle
from the web each time
and then parsing it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:05.336 A:middle
So now the test is taking,
it looks like 1.21 seconds

00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:09.996 A:middle
and it's got a very low Standard
Deviation which is pretty good.

00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:14.016 A:middle
So I'm going to click to
set this as my new Baseline

00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:18.336 A:middle
and since that seemed to take
a little while, I'm just going

00:43:18.766 --> 00:43:20.236 A:middle
to move this out of the block.

00:43:20.626 --> 00:43:23.896 A:middle
Since the data that it's
loading is actually immutable,

00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:24.866 A:middle
I don't need to do
this every time.

00:43:24.866 --> 00:43:26.916 A:middle
So I'm just going
to do that once

00:43:27.376 --> 00:43:28.636 A:middle
when the test initially starts.

00:43:29.386 --> 00:43:30.596 A:middle
I'll click through
on my test again.

00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:38.206 A:middle
And still got a result
around the same ballpark

00:43:38.206 --> 00:43:40.096 A:middle
and still got a pretty
reasonable Standard Deviation.

00:43:40.656 --> 00:43:42.766 A:middle
Well, now that I'm not
actually doing any work before

00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:44.046 A:middle
startMeasuring, I
don't need all this.

00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:47.206 A:middle
So I'm just going to delete that

00:43:47.406 --> 00:43:49.866 A:middle
and change this back
to call measureBlock.

00:43:50.476 --> 00:43:55.676 A:middle
I'll run it again.

00:43:55.676 --> 00:43:58.796 A:middle
And I should get similar results
and yeah, it looks like I do.

00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:02.276 A:middle
So the last thing I'd
like to do with this is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:02.276 A:middle
So the last thing I'd
like to do with this is

00:44:02.276 --> 00:44:03.226 A:middle
like Will showed us earlier.

00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
We kind of want our test
to be self-contained.

00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:09.906 A:middle
We don't want it to be
loading files from the network.

00:44:09.906 --> 00:44:11.226 A:middle
So I'm just going to change this

00:44:11.226 --> 00:44:14.016 A:middle
since I've actually
already got a copy

00:44:14.136 --> 00:44:15.326 A:middle
of this file in my project.

00:44:15.326 --> 00:44:17.876 A:middle
I'm going to use
NSBundle bundleForClass

00:44:17.986 --> 00:44:21.846 A:middle
to load this all-month
file from my test project.

00:44:23.066 --> 00:44:23.806 A:middle
I'll run it again.

00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:28.826 A:middle
And here we go.

00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:31.656 A:middle
So now I've got a new
performance test that's

00:44:31.656 --> 00:44:34.316 A:middle
measuring the time that
it takes to run this

00:44:34.386 --> 00:44:37.936 A:middle
and if something were
to change, I find out.

00:44:39.036 --> 00:44:44.416 A:middle
The last thing I want to do is
I want to connect my changes.

00:44:44.416 --> 00:44:46.886 A:middle
So here we can see the
changes that I've made so far.

00:44:46.886 --> 00:44:48.756 A:middle
I got rid of that really
expensive function.

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:52.806 A:middle
I changed my test to
be a performance test

00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:56.256 A:middle
and we can also see the
Baseline that I've added here.

00:44:57.036 --> 00:44:58.196 A:middle
So I don't think you
can tell from this,

00:44:58.256 --> 00:45:00.446 A:middle
but this is actually a file
that's stored inside the project


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:58.256 --> 00:45:00.446 A:middle
but this is actually a file
that's stored inside the project

00:45:00.446 --> 00:45:00.976 A:middle
bundle itself.

00:45:08.296 --> 00:45:09.346 A:middle
So I'll connect that.

00:45:09.806 --> 00:45:13.936 A:middle
And now it's saved there
for the next time I need it,

00:45:14.966 --> 00:45:15.936 A:middle
the next time I need it, okay.

00:45:16.516 --> 00:45:23.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:23.706 --> 00:45:24.586 A:middle
So what you've just seen is

00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:26.896 A:middle
that you can use the
new measureBlock APIs

00:45:26.946 --> 00:45:28.996 A:middle
to measure performance
in detect regressions.

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:32.526 A:middle
You can tell Xcode
what the Baseline is

00:45:32.526 --> 00:45:36.466 A:middle
to specify what constitutes
a regression for your test.

00:45:36.846 --> 00:45:41.806 A:middle
And it will -- XCTest will use a
Standard Deviation to inform you

00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:43.056 A:middle
of the spread of
the measurements.

00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:46.746 A:middle
And finally, when
something does go wrong,

00:45:46.836 --> 00:45:48.766 A:middle
you can always use Instruments
to profile your test.

00:45:49.526 --> 00:45:50.856 A:middle
Now I'd like to invite
Will back up.

00:45:51.516 --> 00:45:54.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:55.396 --> 00:45:56.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay great.

00:45:56.076 --> 00:45:59.486 A:middle
So just to kind of go back
through everything we've talked

00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:02.776 A:middle
about today, we started off
with thinking about, you know,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:02.776 A:middle
about today, we started off
with thinking about, you know,

00:46:02.906 --> 00:46:04.336 A:middle
why should we test
in the first place?

00:46:04.406 --> 00:46:05.346 A:middle
What are the benefits?

00:46:05.876 --> 00:46:08.546 A:middle
You know, it helps us
identify bugs before we ship.

00:46:08.546 --> 00:46:13.096 A:middle
It also helps us to describe and
really think about the impact

00:46:13.096 --> 00:46:15.226 A:middle
of the APIs we're
presenting in our project.

00:46:16.376 --> 00:46:19.626 A:middle
And then we talked about how
do you add tests and also how

00:46:19.626 --> 00:46:23.526 A:middle
to organize test into targets in
your project, the test methods,

00:46:23.976 --> 00:46:26.496 A:middle
loading resources
from the test bundle

00:46:26.866 --> 00:46:29.586 A:middle
and using the assertions
inside your test.

00:46:29.926 --> 00:46:33.066 A:middle
And then we talked about the
new asynchronous testing API

00:46:33.496 --> 00:46:37.296 A:middle
which allows you to get a
synchronous control flow

00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:39.696 A:middle
around asynchronous tasks.

00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:43.686 A:middle
And then Brooke took you
through performance testing

00:46:43.946 --> 00:46:46.846 A:middle
and also the instruments
integration

00:46:47.206 --> 00:46:49.146 A:middle
that lets you profile your test.

00:46:49.146 --> 00:46:50.856 A:middle
And that's a really
powerful feature

00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:54.786 A:middle
because your test code is going
to be executing critical paths

00:46:54.786 --> 00:46:58.006 A:middle
in your project and then
to easily be able to hop

00:46:58.006 --> 00:47:01.496 A:middle
in Instruments and
analyze time profiles


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.006 --> 00:47:01.496 A:middle
in Instruments and
analyze time profiles

00:47:01.496 --> 00:47:03.946 A:middle
or object alloc profiles.

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:07.246 A:middle
It's a really great
tool for you to have.

00:47:07.246 --> 00:47:11.596 A:middle
And if you have questions,
we encourage you

00:47:11.596 --> 00:47:14.286 A:middle
to contact Dave DeLong,
our Tools Evangelist

00:47:14.856 --> 00:47:17.546 A:middle
and there's a few
related sessions.

00:47:17.546 --> 00:47:18.646 A:middle
You know, early on, I talked

00:47:18.646 --> 00:47:20.896 A:middle
about this continuous
integration workflow

00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:25.116 A:middle
and XCTest combined with the
Xcode server makes that possible

00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:28.476 A:middle
where you can set up a
server that will on commit

00:47:28.476 --> 00:47:31.946 A:middle
or schedules, check out your
code, and run all of your tests

00:47:31.946 --> 00:47:33.086 A:middle
and report the results.

00:47:33.706 --> 00:47:36.706 A:middle
So there's a session on that
later this afternoon right here

00:47:36.706 --> 00:47:37.206 A:middle
in this room.

00:47:37.206 --> 00:47:38.186 A:middle
And that's it.

00:47:38.186 --> 00:47:38.976 A:middle
Thanks a lot, folks.

00:47:39.516 --> 00:47:47.130 A:middle
