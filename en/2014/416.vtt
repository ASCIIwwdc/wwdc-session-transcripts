00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:18.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:18.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:23.836 A:middle
Welcome to what they tell me is
Session 416, Modern Frameworks.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:28.246 A:middle
Today I'm going to be talking a
lot about mostly the mechanics

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:31.016 A:middle
of setting up modern
frameworks on iOS,

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:34.466 A:middle
some of the API design
principles that we use at Apple

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.086 A:middle
and that we recommend
that you guys use.

00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:39.866 A:middle
If you were here for Andy and
Collin's talk just before this,

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:42.236 A:middle
they really delved into a lot

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:46.606 A:middle
of the deep architectural
components of how

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:47.726 A:middle
to build your application.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.376 A:middle
I'm going to cover some
of the higher level stuff

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:53.076 A:middle
and then we'll go through a
quick tour of Xcode and talk

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
about how some of these things
get build directly into your app

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.476 A:middle
and just some of the mechanics
of getting all of that set up.

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:05.556 A:middle
So, how many of you have
actually used static libraries


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:05.556 A:middle
So, how many of you have
actually used static libraries

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.986 A:middle
in your application that
you get from a third party?

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:09.826 A:middle
That's everyone.

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:11.786 A:middle
Okay. If you're doing
it without one

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:14.166 A:middle
of those things you're probably
using the target management

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.206 A:middle
mechanisms in Xcode.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:17.846 A:middle
Right? You download a
bunch of Source Code files,

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:21.206 A:middle
you put them someplace on your
drive, you hope you remember

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.306 A:middle
where you left them, and you're
messing around with this,

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.006 A:middle
and you're shifting things
in and out of targets,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:28.936 A:middle
you may be even taking
them wholesale

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:30.886 A:middle
and dumping them directly
into your application

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:33.376 A:middle
so now you've got six or
seven copies across all

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:34.876 A:middle
of the applications
you're working on.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:36.366 A:middle
Things like that.

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:41.246 A:middle
The next step up from this
is the Static Library, right?

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.586 A:middle
The Cocoa Touch Static Library.

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:46.526 A:middle
It's a .a, you still
have to put it someplace.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.386 A:middle
You're probably checking
it into your sources.

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.866 A:middle
The .a is separate
from the header,

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.586 A:middle
so you need to put
the header someplace.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.286 A:middle
You can't carry assets along
with it so you don't get

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.366 A:middle
to do things like have
a bunch of nice pictures

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.976 A:middle
or customized controls
and things


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.976 A:middle
or customized controls
and things

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:03.256 A:middle
like that in your application.

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:07.116 A:middle
So, this is good but not great.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:11.276 A:middle
In iOS 8 -- so actually let
me back up for a second,

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:13.586 A:middle
OS X developers,
you guys are here?

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:14.586 A:middle
All six of you?

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:23.386 A:middle
No? Okay. How many of you have
actually shipped a framework?

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:24.956 A:middle
Wow, okay, a good number.

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:27.486 A:middle
Great. iOS users you
can do it now, too.

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:28.976 A:middle
There are some restrictions,
though.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:34.316 A:middle
So we'll talk about that.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.916 A:middle
One of the reasons that you're
going to use frameworks is

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.036 A:middle
to be able to package
absolutely everything

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:41.416 A:middle
up that you need
as a single unit.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:43.666 A:middle
Right? So this is going
to include headers,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.126 A:middle
it's going to include
images, asset catalogs.

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:46.956 A:middle
You name it, throw it

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:49.026 A:middle
in the framework it goes
along as a single unit.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:50.626 A:middle
You'll be able to put
those frameworks someplace

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:52.726 A:middle
on your drive, keep
track of them.

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:54.276 A:middle
Xcode will take care
of moving those things

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.036 A:middle
into the right place on
your application builds.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:58.116 A:middle
Right? There are a lot
of really neat features

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:00.676 A:middle
that have been built in for
iOS 8, especially in the face


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:00.676 A:middle
that have been built in for
iOS 8, especially in the face

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:04.196 A:middle
of the some of the new features,
to be able to make the workflow

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:06.956 A:middle
for frameworks really
effective for your iOS 8 apps.

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.736 A:middle
Why do you want to
use frameworks?

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:14.226 A:middle
Well, all of the packaging
stuff is really nice,

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:16.656 A:middle
but all of the features that are

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:19.496 A:middle
in iOS 8 take advantage
of frameworks.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:22.346 A:middle
So the first thing you probably
want to try using is live views,

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:24.166 A:middle
they're the live rendering of
views in Interface Builder.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:28.246 A:middle
So if you're putting your
things into a framework all

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:29.226 A:middle
of that custom-rendering,

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:30.816 A:middle
all of that custom-drawing
becomes available

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:33.436 A:middle
to Interface Builder for
use directly in Xcode

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:36.606 A:middle
as you're editing your
NIBs and your storyboards.

00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:39.216 A:middle
I guess that shows my age,

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:40.356 A:middle
they're all storyboards
now, right?

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:42.926 A:middle
It's not NIBs anymore.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:47.076 A:middle
If you're using extensions,
right, you're going to want

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:49.496 A:middle
to use frameworks because you're
going to be able to share a code

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.276 A:middle
between the extension and the
application without having

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.756 A:middle
to duplicate stuff
in each place.

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.396 A:middle
Right? So you won't be
putting things in the target

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.006 A:middle
for the extension and the target
for the app, you'll put it

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.366 A:middle
in the framework
and link the two


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.366 A:middle
in the framework
and link the two

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:03.816 A:middle
against the framework itself.

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.216 A:middle
If you write multiple
applications

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:09.806 A:middle
and you're using either a third
party framework you're getting

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.226 A:middle
from someplace else or you
have a bunch of your own tried

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:15.376 A:middle
and true tested code that you
like, all of your categories

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:18.156 A:middle
on NS string -- because, you
know, who does that, but, okay,

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:20.176 A:middle
categories on a NS string,
and things like that.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.866 A:middle
If you're sharing code between
multiple applications you're

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:23.896 A:middle
going to want to use frameworks.

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:25.456 A:middle
And obviously also
if you're going

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.366 A:middle
to be publishing a framework, so
if you're going to be making all

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:31.286 A:middle
of your code available as a
framework, you're going to want

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.776 A:middle
to be able to package that up
in a single distributable thing

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:36.366 A:middle
that everybody can download and
use and you can version those.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.426 A:middle
So, let's talk a little
bit about getting set up.

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:43.686 A:middle
Xcode makes it really easy
to create a new framework.

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:48.156 A:middle
There's a new template right
inside of the new file dialogue

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:51.306 A:middle
or the new project dialogue
that says Cocoa Touch Framework.

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.116 A:middle
Right? So you can
just go click on that,

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:54.846 A:middle
click on the Cocoa
Touch Framework,

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:56.396 A:middle
it's going to walk you
through the same form,

00:04:56.816 --> 00:04:58.446 A:middle
give it a bundle ID,
things like that.

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.726 A:middle
Save it someplace,
you're off to the races.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.726 A:middle
Save it someplace,
you're off to the races.

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:02.926 A:middle
This also works if you
have an existing project

00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:04.186 A:middle
and you create a
new target and one

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:08.446 A:middle
of the new target templates is
a Cocoa Touch Framework, right.

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:12.266 A:middle
So what goes in it?

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:14.136 A:middle
Once you decide you're
going to use Frameworks,

00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:18.026 A:middle
what are you going
to put in there?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.346 A:middle
If you're using live views, if
you're interested in frameworks

00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:24.676 A:middle
for live views, you're going to
want to put the views in there,

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:27.466 A:middle
and the controls, and
anything else that goes along

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:29.036 A:middle
with giving your app
that custom appearance.

00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:31.696 A:middle
Right, so these are going
to be all the assets,

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:34.596 A:middle
in the views it'll be all the
drawing code, the controls,

00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:36.186 A:middle
again, it'll be assets,
things like that.

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.086 A:middle
They all go in the framework.

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:42.116 A:middle
That way, now, when you link it
for using with your application

00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:46.016 A:middle
or giving it out to all of your
friends and neighbors and trying

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.996 A:middle
to use it within Xcode for IB,

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:52.736 A:middle
all that stuff just
starts to work.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.446 A:middle
What goes in if you're
using extensions?

00:05:55.026 --> 00:05:56.386 A:middle
Well you're going to put
all of the same stuff

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.406 A:middle
that you would've put in
for live views, the views

00:05:58.406 --> 00:05:59.636 A:middle
and controls and the
custom appearance

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:01.836 A:middle
because your extension
probably has all of that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:01.836 A:middle
because your extension
probably has all of that.

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:04.506 A:middle
You're also going
to put in things

00:06:04.506 --> 00:06:07.416 A:middle
like view controller
classes, right?

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:09.266 A:middle
The custom view controllers
that you're writing and you want

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.226 A:middle
to make available as
API to everyone else

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:14.836 A:middle
or to your extension and to your
application, those are going

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:15.546 A:middle
to go in there, as well.

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:18.186 A:middle
You're probably also going
to put the service API

00:06:18.186 --> 00:06:19.256 A:middle
that you're using down there.

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:21.386 A:middle
So if you're doing network
code, things like that,

00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:22.806 A:middle
all of that stuff's
going to go down there.

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:28.976 A:middle
Resources, again, assets,
configuration files

00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:31.906 A:middle
that might be particular to
your service go down there.

00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.456 A:middle
Anything that goes in common

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:36.256 A:middle
to your extension
in your application.

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.096 A:middle
So, that's also true
if you're going

00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:42.026 A:middle
to be using framework contents
between multiple applications.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.116 A:middle
Right? So you've two or three
applications in the store,

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:46.086 A:middle
your users are going to go ahead

00:06:46.086 --> 00:06:47.936 A:middle
and download those
applications from the store.

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:51.536 A:middle
You're going to want to put
all of the stuff in common.

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:53.326 A:middle
Right? The idea here
is you want to be able

00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:55.316 A:middle
to change the Source Code
once, build a new version

00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:56.916 A:middle
of your framework,
make it available

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.156 A:middle
to all your applications
on your machines so that

00:06:59.156 --> 00:06:59.786 A:middle
when you ship them off

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.716 A:middle
to the store all those
changes get picked up.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.716 A:middle
to the store all those
changes get picked up.

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:04.566 A:middle
And when you're publishing
frameworks,

00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:05.926 A:middle
again, it's the same thing.

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:10.476 A:middle
So, really what you're
going to wind

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:13.586 A:middle
up doing is refactoring
your application using a lot

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:15.756 A:middle
of the architectural things that
Andy and Collin were talking

00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:18.796 A:middle
about in the previous
hour, pulling those

00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:21.926 A:middle
into an organizational
unit, like the framework,

00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:26.246 A:middle
in order make your
development a lot easier.

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:31.796 A:middle
The app right now, if you're
using extensions, for instance,

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:34.976 A:middle
you've got an application,
it's going to have two parts.

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.316 A:middle
It's going to have the
app and the extension.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.016 A:middle
That nifty little building
brick there is the extension.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:44.286 A:middle
Right, so they sit next to each
other inside the application

00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:46.016 A:middle
bundle, you can think
of the extension

00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:47.696 A:middle
as basically a little
tiny application.

00:07:47.996 --> 00:07:48.586 A:middle
All right?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.866 A:middle
You've got a bunch of
Source Code in there

00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:56.026 A:middle
and it probably shares some
Source Code and Swift files,

00:07:56.026 --> 00:07:57.536 A:middle
maybe some Objective-C files.

00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:01.626 A:middle
Those things are all going to
be part of the target, right?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:01.626 A:middle
Those things are all going to
be part of the target, right?

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:04.316 A:middle
Rather than have the
object code generated

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
by those things getting
duplicated into each

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:10.836 A:middle
of those targets, what you'll
do is just pull the common stuff

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:14.026 A:middle
down into the framework
and link the application

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.996 A:middle
and the extension
against the framework.

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:22.206 A:middle
How do you decide what goes
down there as far as code goes?

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:25.026 A:middle
If it looks like it's showing
up more than once in a target

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:27.776 A:middle
or more than once in your
application, it probably goes

00:08:27.776 --> 00:08:29.726 A:middle
in a framework, right.

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:31.416 A:middle
We do this at Apple.

00:08:31.916 --> 00:08:33.385 A:middle
We look across all
the applications

00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:34.206 A:middle
that we're developing.

00:08:34.566 --> 00:08:35.716 A:middle
We start seeing patterns.

00:08:36.376 --> 00:08:38.035 A:middle
We start seeing things that
are repeating themselves.

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.176 A:middle
So we take those patterns, we
pull them down in the framework.

00:08:40.176 --> 00:08:43.246 A:middle
They either go from the apps in
the UIKit or they go in the apps

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:46.256 A:middle
in the AppKit on OS X, or they
go down in the foundation,

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:48.286 A:middle
or they wind up going
down into Core OS.

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:49.756 A:middle
There are lots of
different places

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:52.226 A:middle
where we start pulling
common code up out of apps

00:08:52.756 --> 00:08:55.306 A:middle
and make sure that they
wind up at the right level

00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:57.426 A:middle
of abstraction for
use everywhere else.

00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:02.226 A:middle
Right? So, a really good
technique in terms of separating


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:02.226 A:middle
Right? So, a really good
technique in terms of separating

00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:03.096 A:middle
out everything that you're doing

00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:05.776 A:middle
in your applications is
doing the same thing.

00:09:06.236 --> 00:09:08.776 A:middle
Figure out what's in common,
put it in the framework,

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:11.056 A:middle
use the framework as
the unit of distribution

00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:12.896 A:middle
for pulling all that
stuff together.

00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:15.266 A:middle
Frameworks are API.

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:20.136 A:middle
You heard Andy and Collin talk
a little bit about it yes --

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:21.486 A:middle
yesterday -- earlier today.

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:25.906 A:middle
Identifying the
responsibilities,

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:28.356 A:middle
figuring out who should be
doing what within your classes.

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.916 A:middle
Right? Some guy on the
internet wrote a thing

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:33.096 A:middle
about being ruthless with
your objects and making sure

00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:34.426 A:middle
that there are these
clean, bright lines

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:37.786 A:middle
between where those
responsibilities go.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.956 A:middle
It is a great technique
and it will make a lot

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.406 A:middle
of your development easier
to take the same kinds

00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:47.276 A:middle
of framework approach to
developing your application

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.056 A:middle
because now you get
really separable code.

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:51.196 A:middle
You get easily testable
code, you get very,

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:52.986 A:middle
very good abstraction layers.

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:56.016 A:middle
Once you've decided you're
going to be offering frameworks

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:58.356 A:middle
to your application or to
anyone else, you're going

00:09:58.356 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
to publish a framework as API
for your service, you know,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.356 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
to publish a framework as API
for your service, you know,

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:03.086 A:middle
providing all those
UI view controllers

00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:04.106 A:middle
that go along with it.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.736 A:middle
The keyword there is it's API.

00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:11.476 A:middle
The key thing is to make sure
that you get the API right.

00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:17.726 A:middle
We spend weeks arguing about
things on mailing lists at Apple

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.066 A:middle
about how to develop the API,

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:20.616 A:middle
what the architecture
should look like,

00:10:20.616 --> 00:10:23.716 A:middle
what things should be
named, all of that stuff.

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:27.316 A:middle
There is some Cocoa guidelines
that we use, I'm going to run

00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:28.356 A:middle
through some of them here.

00:10:28.606 --> 00:10:31.426 A:middle
One of them is that it's
much better to be clear

00:10:31.426 --> 00:10:32.476 A:middle
than it is to be brief.

00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
Right? So, a method like this
in Objective-C, insert:at:

00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:40.126 A:middle
is very brief, it's very terse.

00:10:40.586 --> 00:10:43.146 A:middle
What are you inserting?

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:48.536 A:middle
What is the at that
you're inserting it to?

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:49.466 A:middle
Don't do this.

00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:52.376 A:middle
It's not clear enough,
it's not specific enough,

00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:54.956 A:middle
it doesn't help you,
because, you know,

00:10:54.956 --> 00:10:57.006 A:middle
we all write this code,
what, once, twice.

00:10:57.606 --> 00:10:59.346 A:middle
We're going to read
it thousands of times.

00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:01.326 A:middle
I'm going to hand a
whole bunch of code off


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:01.326 A:middle
I'm going to hand a
whole bunch of code off

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.296 A:middle
to some kid who's younger and
smarter than I am and he's going

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.576 A:middle
to have to figure
out what I was doing.

00:11:05.676 --> 00:11:08.686 A:middle
Right? So, be clear,
express your intent.

00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:11.786 A:middle
insertObject:atIndex:, right?

00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.056 A:middle
What are you inserting?

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:14.756 A:middle
Some object.

00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:15.596 A:middle
Where is it going?

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:16.496 A:middle
At an index.

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:19.496 A:middle
Right? Now you've got a
very specific guarantee.

00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:22.116 A:middle
You've got a readable
chunk of code.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:26.746 A:middle
This is the kind of thing that
we will literally spend a week

00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:29.646 A:middle
in email arguing
about to get right.

00:11:30.746 --> 00:11:33.636 A:middle
API design is like a
contact sport at our company.

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:36.896 A:middle
So, if you're not really
throwing some elbows

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.956 A:middle
in the mailing list with
your friends and neighbors

00:11:39.046 --> 00:11:42.156 A:middle
in doing API you're probably
just not having enough fun

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:42.886 A:middle
with it.

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:45.876 A:middle
So, do this.

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:47.446 A:middle
Be really specific.

00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:50.556 A:middle
Don't abbreviate, right?

00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:52.546 A:middle
Don't' make your selectors
look like line noise.

00:11:52.956 --> 00:11:58.116 A:middle
All right -- setBkgndColor:
We have code completion,

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:00.316 A:middle
it fills it out for you, you
can get a couple of keystrokes


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:00.316 A:middle
it fills it out for you, you
can get a couple of keystrokes

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.106 A:middle
into it and it'll
tell you, oh, look,

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:05.086 A:middle
you know, setBackgroundColor:.

00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:12.066 A:middle
Right? It's long, it tells
you exactly what's going on.

00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:15.896 A:middle
Do that. Don't be ambiguous.

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:17.256 A:middle
Right? There are a lot of words

00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:20.106 A:middle
that can be used as
a verb or a noun.

00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:23.316 A:middle
Here's one of the ones that I
actually proposes and managed

00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:27.356 A:middle
to get by and now
regret, displayName:.

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:29.916 A:middle
Right? You see this in a
couple of places, I think it's

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:30.976 A:middle
on NSFileManager these days.

00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:32.786 A:middle
We try not to do this anymore.

00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:34.246 A:middle
Is display a noun or a verb?

00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:38.526 A:middle
Am I telling this thing to
show the name to somebody

00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:41.656 A:middle
or is it a name intended
for display?

00:12:42.106 --> 00:12:44.676 A:middle
Right? What we do these days

00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:49.416 A:middle
in the Kit mostly is anything
that's intended for the display

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:51.966 A:middle
to the user is a localized name.

00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:54.016 A:middle
Even if you're getting
as input from the user.

00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:56.346 A:middle
Because if you're getting
it as input from the user,

00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:58.616 A:middle
it's pretty much as localized
as it's going to get.

00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:00.626 A:middle
Right? It's coming from that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:00.626 A:middle
Right? It's coming from that.

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:04.186 A:middle
If you're showing it to the user
and it's in your strings files

00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:05.816 A:middle
and things like that,
it's the localized name,

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:09.146 A:middle
it's coming out of the bundle
system to have the localization.

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:11.716 A:middle
Right, so our intent
was to be able to say,

00:13:12.046 --> 00:13:13.936 A:middle
we want to show the users
something in their language.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.436 A:middle
It's for display.

00:13:17.056 --> 00:13:20.016 A:middle
And then everybody went, well,
why -- I'm calling displayName,

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:20.926 A:middle
why isn't this drawing?

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:23.696 A:middle
Oops, yeah, let's not do that.

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:26.256 A:middle
So, be clear.

00:13:28.296 --> 00:13:32.326 A:middle
Also, don't take advantage
of some of the things

00:13:32.326 --> 00:13:34.376 A:middle
that Objective-C in
this case lets you do.

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:37.436 A:middle
For instance, you could
declare sendAction like this.

00:13:38.546 --> 00:13:41.616 A:middle
And you don't necessarily have
to give names to the parameters.

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:46.766 A:middle
So this produces a call site
that looks like sendAction::,

00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:51.896 A:middle
you know, sendAction: --
Selector,:object, :flag.

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:55.186 A:middle
It's not specific enough, what's
the object intended to be?

00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:57.016 A:middle
What does that flag
actually mean?

00:13:58.226 --> 00:14:01.066 A:middle
Right? Fill the whole
selector out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.226 --> 00:14:01.066 A:middle
Right? Fill the whole
selector out.

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:05.036 A:middle
sendAction, toObject,
forAllCells, YES or NO.

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.176 A:middle
Right, that flag could
have been anything.

00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:09.736 A:middle
It could have been animated,
it could have been, you know,

00:14:10.556 --> 00:14:12.276 A:middle
stop transmitting the message

00:14:12.276 --> 00:14:14.056 A:middle
after you find a
hit or keep going.

00:14:14.846 --> 00:14:16.956 A:middle
Those kinds of things
have to be spelled out.

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
Again, you're going to write it
once, somebody's going to come

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:22.416 A:middle
by later and curse your
name because they have

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:24.636 A:middle
to read it 1000 times
after that.

00:14:25.306 --> 00:14:29.566 A:middle
Don't be that guy.

00:14:29.566 --> 00:14:30.736 A:middle
Do this. Swift, though,

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.866 A:middle
brings us some really
interesting opportunities

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:37.796 A:middle
to be clear, to be expressive
and still try maintain some

00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:39.736 A:middle
of the terseness and the
less typing and things

00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:40.846 A:middle
like that that we'd like to do.

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:42.906 A:middle
And some of the things that
I'm doing to talk about as far

00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:47.906 A:middle
as Swift goes are a little
bit different because, for us,

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:49.766 A:middle
we're still trying to
figure out what some

00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:51.926 A:middle
of the really good
API idioms mean

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:53.526 A:middle
and we're really not
sure what it means

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:56.776 A:middle
to have a language idiom
for a language that has had

00:14:56.776 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
about 200 native speakers
for less than a year.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:56.776 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
about 200 native speakers
for less than a year.

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:03.726 A:middle
So, trying to figure out sort of
what some of this stuff is going

00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:06.016 A:middle
to wind up looking like is
a little bit of a challenge.

00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:07.756 A:middle
This is actually a great
opportunity for all of you

00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:10.676 A:middle
to be able to provide us
feedback with Swift in terms

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:13.786 A:middle
of what the API looks like
and how your experiences

00:15:13.786 --> 00:15:17.456 A:middle
in using it both as a native
language and through the mix

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:20.236 A:middle
and match bits with
Cocoa and Cocoa Touch,

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.976 A:middle
and let us know exactly
what you'd like to see

00:15:23.036 --> 00:15:25.806 A:middle
and what makes it easy to use
Swift with all of these things,

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:26.666 A:middle
versus what makes it feel

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:28.066 A:middle
like there's a little
bit of friction there.

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:30.376 A:middle
All right, so please make sure

00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.346 A:middle
that you're filing
those [inaudible]

00:15:31.346 --> 00:15:32.406 A:middle
on how you'd like it to work.

00:15:33.226 --> 00:15:37.346 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at a
Swift function, or I pulled this

00:15:37.346 --> 00:15:40.666 A:middle
out of the examples in the book
but I'm going to sort of work

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:43.666 A:middle
through those and then we'll
extend it to something else.

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:46.376 A:middle
So containsCharacter string:
String character: Character.

00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:50.636 A:middle
So a Swift function
has named parameters,

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:52.876 A:middle
in this case these names
are the variable names

00:15:52.876 --> 00:15:54.776 A:middle
that you'll use inside
a function

00:15:55.886 --> 00:15:59.226 A:middle
to describe the variables.

00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:01.126 A:middle
Right, so this produces a call
site that looks like this,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:01.126 A:middle
Right, so this produces a call
site that looks like this,

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.806 A:middle
containsCharacter"Buddy", "u".

00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:05.286 A:middle
Right, there's a string,
there's a character.

00:16:05.326 --> 00:16:08.426 A:middle
If you tack a little
hash mark in front of it,

00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
this is not a social media
construct, you don't get to find

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:12.926 A:middle
out what's trending in
your code [laughter],

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
although that might an
interesting question.

00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:21.396 A:middle
Right? How often do you use
hashtag character in your code?

00:16:21.576 --> 00:16:25.396 A:middle
This allows you to be able
to use a named parameter

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:27.776 A:middle
at the call site and be
specific about what it is.

00:16:27.776 --> 00:16:29.326 A:middle
This produces a call site
that looks like this.

00:16:29.326 --> 00:16:31.686 A:middle
containsCharacterstring:
character:.

00:16:32.876 --> 00:16:37.816 A:middle
Java code -- you've got method
overloading, you can wind

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:40.846 A:middle
up with a method that's one word

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:43.796 A:middle
and it has 19 different
sets of parameters.

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:46.366 A:middle
Some of them have, you know,
four arguments, six arguments,

00:16:46.366 --> 00:16:47.926 A:middle
12 arguments, nine arguments.

00:16:47.926 --> 00:16:49.656 A:middle
Some of them are the same,
some of them are different.

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:51.676 A:middle
What arguments are they?

00:16:51.986 --> 00:16:54.186 A:middle
These named parameters are a
great way to be able to actually

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:57.496 A:middle
to tell at the call sites which
ones you're using along the way.

00:16:57.856 --> 00:16:58.906 A:middle
It's a way to be expressive.

00:16:58.906 --> 00:16:59.986 A:middle
It's a way to be specific.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:06.366 A:middle
Right? One of the really nifty
things about Swift is the mix

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:10.086 A:middle
and match feature, being able to
take code that already exists,

00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:13.195 A:middle
you've already got a
ton of Objective-C code.

00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:15.856 A:middle
In terms of practical terms and
shipping applications and things

00:17:15.856 --> 00:17:17.576 A:middle
like that, you'd be nuts
to throw that away and try

00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:19.016 A:middle
to do it all over
again in Swift.

00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:22.566 A:middle
It'd be fun if you had the
time but you probably don't,

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:24.346 A:middle
you're trying to ship, right?

00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:26.726 A:middle
Mix and match lets you
do things like this.

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:31.526 A:middle
This is the Popover
presentation API from UIKit.

00:17:31.896 --> 00:17:37.676 A:middle
It gets converted into something
that looks vaguely like this

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:40.556 A:middle
by the mix and match
system for Swift.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:45.846 A:middle
Right? So, got a function,
presentPopoverFromtRect rect:

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:47.576 A:middle
view: arrowDirections: animated:

00:17:48.186 --> 00:17:53.366 A:middle
That produces a call site
that looks like this.

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:55.376 A:middle
Okay, again, not
specific enough,

00:17:56.356 --> 00:17:59.986 A:middle
not a really good description
of what's happening, right?

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:01.126 A:middle
What's .Any there?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:01.126 A:middle
What's .Any there?

00:18:01.126 --> 00:18:01.656 A:middle
I have no idea.

00:18:01.656 --> 00:18:02.586 A:middle
What does true mean?

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:05.696 A:middle
I mean someRect and someView
are at least descriptive enough,

00:18:05.696 --> 00:18:06.836 A:middle
but that doesn't really help me

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.456 A:middle
out if those aren't
my variable names.

00:18:08.866 --> 00:18:11.396 A:middle
Right? If we re-declare --

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:13.576 A:middle
oh, and then we've got
presentFromBarButtonItem

00:18:13.576 --> 00:18:15.406 A:middle
and that just throws the
other wrench into it.

00:18:15.806 --> 00:18:16.426 A:middle
Right? Which is okay.

00:18:16.426 --> 00:18:18.616 A:middle
Well, now I got barButtonItem,
but arrowDirections

00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:19.676 A:middle
and animated are still there.

00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:22.716 A:middle
We can be more specific
about these things.

00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:24.986 A:middle
We can take advantage
of function overloading,

00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:26.176 A:middle
method overloading, and say,

00:18:26.176 --> 00:18:28.186 A:middle
let's call them both
presentPopover, what the heck?

00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
All right, but now we've got
this really neat way to be able

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:35.266 A:middle
to separate out the
other API from, you know,

00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:40.986 A:middle
Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, and
make these two different.

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.516 A:middle
So what do we have here?

00:18:42.516 --> 00:18:44.286 A:middle
I've got fromRect rect.

00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:47.936 A:middle
Right? So fromRect is going to
wind up being the external name

00:18:47.936 --> 00:18:50.226 A:middle
that you use at the
call site, rect is going

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:51.666 A:middle
to be the variable
inside the method,

00:18:52.826 --> 00:18:54.536 A:middle
the implementation
variable that you're using.

00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:55.326 A:middle
It's the parameter that --

00:18:55.326 --> 00:18:56.256 A:middle
it's the name that you use

00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:58.366 A:middle
for the parameter
that gets passed in.

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:00.676 A:middle
inView view and then the
hash marks there again,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:00.676 A:middle
inView view and then the
hash marks there again,

00:19:01.296 --> 00:19:05.536 A:middle
that makes it possible
to use the same name

00:19:05.536 --> 00:19:07.136 A:middle
as the external name,
as the internal name.

00:19:07.136 --> 00:19:09.106 A:middle
Those produce call sites
that look like this.

00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:12.106 A:middle
Right? So now I've got
presentPopover fromRect, inView,

00:19:12.106 --> 00:19:14.116 A:middle
ArrowDirections,
Animated, and presentPopover

00:19:14.116 --> 00:19:16.696 A:middle
from BarButtonItem,
arrowDirections, animated.

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:19.336 A:middle
Great, I can tell the different
between them, that's awesome.

00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:24.456 A:middle
That's a lot of typing.

00:19:24.576 --> 00:19:27.496 A:middle
Co-completions nice but that's
still a bunch of typing.

00:19:28.296 --> 00:19:30.356 A:middle
Swift has some really
nice features

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:33.616 A:middle
for default arguments
in your API.

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:36.146 A:middle
So let's go back and take a look

00:19:36.146 --> 00:19:37.736 A:middle
at just the presentPopover
method.

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:41.926 A:middle
Okay? If we re-declare
it like this,

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:46.956 A:middle
what we've got is
UIPopoverArrowDirection is the

00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:49.066 A:middle
type, and .Any there
is the default value.

00:19:50.236 --> 00:19:51.616 A:middle
Right? Swift, when it
goes through the mix

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:55.396 A:middle
and match bits takes the common
pre-fix off of the ENUM's

00:19:55.396 --> 00:19:59.196 A:middle
for the options and makes
them the shortened version

00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
at the end, which is
one really nice thing


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
at the end, which is
one really nice thing

00:20:00.626 --> 00:20:01.886 A:middle
about when we went back through

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.836 A:middle
and started normalizing
all the ENUM's again

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:06.016 A:middle
and the common prefixes
allowed us to do this.

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:11.446 A:middle
So, .Any as passed into a
popoverArrowDirection type is

00:20:11.986 --> 00:20:15.876 A:middle
that particular entry out
of the NS ENUM argument.

00:20:15.876 --> 00:20:18.896 A:middle
And Bool gets true there
is a way to say that YES,

00:20:19.036 --> 00:20:21.436 A:middle
if there's no argument
presented we want to be able

00:20:21.436 --> 00:20:23.596 A:middle
to have this thing
be true all the time.

00:20:24.366 --> 00:20:27.586 A:middle
So that turns these call
sites, which are nice,

00:20:27.696 --> 00:20:32.756 A:middle
they're descriptive,
into these call sites.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:37.226 A:middle
Right? One of the
patterns that you see

00:20:37.226 --> 00:20:39.926 A:middle
in foundation is you'll
see a really long method,

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:42.356 A:middle
it'll have probably, I don't
know, anywhere between six,

00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:44.136 A:middle
and eight to 12 arguments.

00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:47.156 A:middle
And then you'll see versions
of that that are shorter.

00:20:47.156 --> 00:20:49.216 A:middle
Generally you'll see
that the end arguments

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:51.276 A:middle
of an Objective-C [inaudible]
starting to get peeled off.

00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:53.006 A:middle
Those shorter versions
are calling

00:20:53.006 --> 00:20:55.176 A:middle
into the longer version
with default values.

00:20:55.836 --> 00:20:57.976 A:middle
Right? Those are all generally
one line implementations

00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:01.056 A:middle
that call back out to the big
guy with all the switches on it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:01.056 A:middle
that call back out to the big
guy with all the switches on it.

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:04.066 A:middle
Right? This is a way
that you can provide all

00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:05.356 A:middle
of those switches without having

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.766 A:middle
to provide all those
methods all the time.

00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:08.766 A:middle
Put in the same default values.

00:21:09.656 --> 00:21:12.606 A:middle
Right? This provides you with
some really good opportunities

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:15.836 A:middle
to be able to clean up your
code, be really clear in Swift,

00:21:15.836 --> 00:21:21.026 A:middle
and doing this in Swift,
talking to Objective-C API's,

00:21:21.426 --> 00:21:25.106 A:middle
you can start really
thinning down the API surface

00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:26.766 A:middle
so you don't have
tons and tons and tons

00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:28.016 A:middle
of methods to keep track of.

00:21:28.626 --> 00:21:30.586 A:middle
You've got one place to
do these implementations

00:21:30.976 --> 00:21:34.536 A:middle
and the default value's
just go in the right place.

00:21:34.716 --> 00:21:36.646 A:middle
There's really good
documentation online,

00:21:36.646 --> 00:21:39.826 A:middle
the "Coding Guidelines for
Cocoa" at developer.apple.com.

00:21:39.926 --> 00:21:44.236 A:middle
If you just go to
developer.apple.com, log in,

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:48.186 A:middle
search for this document, it's
the same coding guidelines

00:21:48.186 --> 00:21:50.896 A:middle
that we have up on our
internal wiki for how

00:21:50.896 --> 00:21:52.356 A:middle
to get started with
developing API.

00:21:52.356 --> 00:21:56.106 A:middle
All right, so the rules that
we're trying to put down there,

00:21:56.596 --> 00:21:58.236 A:middle
they're the same things
that we use at Apple.

00:21:58.706 --> 00:22:03.346 A:middle
So another good reason to
go and look at these is all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.706 --> 00:22:03.346 A:middle
So another good reason to
go and look at these is all

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:05.266 A:middle
of the Objective-C API
that you're going to write,

00:22:06.046 --> 00:22:07.966 A:middle
if you're not just going
to chuck it over and go

00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:13.306 A:middle
for Swift entirely, all of
that API will work well and fit

00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:15.496 A:middle
in with the idioms
that we already have

00:22:15.636 --> 00:22:17.846 A:middle
for our existing
Cocoa frameworks.

00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:20.106 A:middle
The other document you
probably want to read

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.896 A:middle
that I'm sure you've
all downloaded already,

00:22:22.836 --> 00:22:24.146 A:middle
"The Swift Programming
Language."

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.196 A:middle
I wouldn't be surprised if all

00:22:25.196 --> 00:22:26.936 A:middle
of you suddenly have
more experience with it

00:22:26.936 --> 00:22:28.996 A:middle
than I do by this point.

00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:32.096 A:middle
It's available on iBooks,
it's also available online

00:22:32.096 --> 00:22:33.316 A:middle
at developer.apple.com.

00:22:33.316 --> 00:22:36.626 A:middle
It's got all of the
information about Swift in it

00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:38.836 A:middle
and they do make some
API recommendations

00:22:38.836 --> 00:22:39.596 A:middle
in there as well.

00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:43.326 A:middle
Again, we're all sort of
just figuring this out.

00:22:44.316 --> 00:22:47.616 A:middle
So, if there's something
that you see that makes a lot

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:50.266 A:middle
of sense, great, call that out,
tell us because we'll make sure

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:51.246 A:middle
that we try to keep it.

00:22:51.646 --> 00:22:53.386 A:middle
If there's something you
see that you don't like

00:22:53.386 --> 00:22:56.956 A:middle
or that you'd like to make
suggestions of, send them in.

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:59.616 A:middle
Take advantage of
bugreport.apple.com,

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
get the radars in on Swift


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
get the radars in on Swift

00:23:00.816 --> 00:23:02.926 A:middle
because this is really your
opportunity to have a lot

00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:05.526 A:middle
of influence on how all
of this stuff develops.

00:23:06.036 --> 00:23:09.606 A:middle
If you're publishing a
framework, whether it's

00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:13.726 A:middle
for your own applications, or
whether it's for other people

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:16.466 A:middle
to use in their own
applications, you're going

00:23:16.466 --> 00:23:17.376 A:middle
to run into a problem.

00:23:17.946 --> 00:23:18.996 A:middle
This is a problem that we run

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:21.866 A:middle
into every time we release a new
version of the operating system

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:23.276 A:middle
and that's framework version.

00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:27.956 A:middle
Right? So your user has gone

00:23:27.956 --> 00:23:29.376 A:middle
and downloaded a
whole bunch of apps.

00:23:29.656 --> 00:23:31.576 A:middle
Darn them.

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:32.686 A:middle
Well, I mean, good for you guys.

00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:35.136 A:middle
They should download
all of your apps.

00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:39.106 A:middle
All of those applications, let's
say, used the latest version

00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:42.776 A:middle
of this new framework that just
came out and its version 1.

00:23:43.386 --> 00:23:47.116 A:middle
So for a while at least
you're in good shape.

00:23:47.116 --> 00:23:49.006 A:middle
Everybody's got the
same code running,

00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:51.166 A:middle
if an application
sends information

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:54.066 A:middle
to another one via an extension
or via the open URL call,

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:58.426 A:middle
things like that, hey, all
of the objects work together.

00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:00.376 A:middle
No problem, right?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:00.376 A:middle
No problem, right?

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:01.316 A:middle
Awesome.

00:24:03.306 --> 00:24:07.006 A:middle
And then, you come out with a
new version of the framework

00:24:07.486 --> 00:24:13.216 A:middle
and some applications update to
it and some applications don't.

00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:16.706 A:middle
Or some of the applications just
got developed and then abandoned

00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:17.666 A:middle
and they'll never update.

00:24:18.106 --> 00:24:21.246 A:middle
Right? So some applications
on the user's device are going

00:24:21.246 --> 00:24:24.446 A:middle
to be Version 2, the blue ones,

00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:26.066 A:middle
some versions are
going to be Version 1.

00:24:26.566 --> 00:24:29.356 A:middle
And now suddenly I'm
trying to send an object

00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:31.616 A:middle
to that other application
from a Version 2 framework

00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:33.866 A:middle
to a Version 1 framework or
from a Version 1 framework

00:24:33.866 --> 00:24:34.796 A:middle
to a Version 2 framework.

00:24:36.076 --> 00:24:37.186 A:middle
Not everything's the same.

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:39.896 A:middle
Those objects have
grown new capabilities,

00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:40.986 A:middle
the data that you're
passing back

00:24:40.986 --> 00:24:42.546 A:middle
and forth may have
new keys in it.

00:24:43.796 --> 00:24:45.796 A:middle
Right? One of the things that
you're going to have to do

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:46.506 A:middle
if you are going

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:49.346 A:middle
to be publishing a
framework is be very careful

00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:50.556 A:middle
about the versioning.

00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:55.466 A:middle
So, a number of things that
you can do about dealing

00:24:55.466 --> 00:24:56.546 A:middle
with framework versions.

00:24:57.156 --> 00:24:58.916 A:middle
First, you're going to have

00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.466 A:middle
to put a framework
version in there anyway.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.466 A:middle
to put a framework
version in there anyway.

00:25:01.456 --> 00:25:04.656 A:middle
The framework mechanism
when you create a new target

00:25:04.656 --> 00:25:06.916 A:middle
or when you create a new
project for a framework,

00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:08.456 A:middle
that goes in the
info [inaudible],

00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:11.166 A:middle
there's a short version string,
keep track of that, use that.

00:25:11.436 --> 00:25:13.206 A:middle
That's information that you
can use in order to figure

00:25:13.206 --> 00:25:14.806 A:middle
out what's happening,
what version

00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:15.936 A:middle
of the framework were
you linked against,

00:25:15.936 --> 00:25:18.076 A:middle
what version is the
data coming from?

00:25:18.076 --> 00:25:20.006 A:middle
You can send that data to
something else to say, hey,

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
I'm a Version 1 thing,
I'm a Version 2 thing.

00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:25.816 A:middle
The other thing you should
do probably is take advantage

00:25:25.816 --> 00:25:28.996 A:middle
of keyed archiving or keyed
archiving-like behavior.

00:25:29.726 --> 00:25:31.866 A:middle
Right? So if you are doing
key-value stuff as part

00:25:31.866 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
of your archiving or part of
your document format make sure

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:38.216 A:middle
that your key-value pair
meanings are consistent.

00:25:39.326 --> 00:25:41.856 A:middle
Right? Don't suddenly
for a Version 1 key

00:25:41.856 --> 00:25:43.156 A:middle
that might be background color,

00:25:44.096 --> 00:25:46.166 A:middle
don't suddenly make
zero mean white instead

00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:47.406 A:middle
of black in Version 2.

00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:51.166 A:middle
Because then suddenly the
user's going to come along

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:52.786 A:middle
and you're going to get sent
some data and they're going

00:25:52.786 --> 00:25:54.416 A:middle
to say, "Wow, this is
completely rendered wrong.

00:25:54.506 --> 00:25:54.956 A:middle
What happened?"

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:59.346 A:middle
Right? So once you've committed
to what a key-value pair means

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:03.056 A:middle
or what a relationship between
two key-value pairs mean inside


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:03.056 A:middle
or what a relationship between
two key-value pairs mean inside

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.696 A:middle
those archives that you're
sending back and forth

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.226 A:middle
of different versions of
yourself, you really kind

00:26:07.226 --> 00:26:07.976 A:middle
of have to stick with it.

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.676 A:middle
Right? We do this at Apple also.

00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:13.716 A:middle
There's this whole set of keys
that have sort of come along

00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:17.626 A:middle
to make sure that when we open
up archives from older versions

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:19.566 A:middle
of the system that we can
continue to read that data.

00:26:19.566 --> 00:26:23.946 A:middle
You do get lots of interesting
opportunities at read

00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:25.586 A:middle
and write time to be
able to deal with that.

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:28.636 A:middle
So, one is missing keys should
return 'nil' or the equivalent.

00:26:28.636 --> 00:26:31.236 A:middle
In the face of getting back
'nil' you probably want

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:31.996 A:middle
to do something sane.

00:26:33.406 --> 00:26:35.606 A:middle
Right? If you're looking for
a key and it's not there,

00:26:36.106 --> 00:26:38.276 A:middle
maybe that's a great opportunity
for some default value

00:26:38.276 --> 00:26:40.776 A:middle
to get injected in at the
time that you're on archive.

00:26:41.356 --> 00:26:43.326 A:middle
Right? And that's
really the opportunity

00:26:43.326 --> 00:26:44.106 A:middle
to be able to do that.

00:26:44.106 --> 00:26:47.386 A:middle
Because the encoding and the
decoding are your chances

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:49.086 A:middle
to get at that interface.

00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:51.346 A:middle
When you're writing that data
out, you're going to be writing

00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:53.336 A:middle
that data out for
consumption by somebody else.

00:26:53.336 --> 00:26:55.666 A:middle
When you're consuming that data
you kind of have to look at it

00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:58.366 A:middle
and go, well, I'm not
really sure where this comes

00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
from so I should at
least be wary of it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
from so I should at
least be wary of it.

00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:04.256 A:middle
Right? If you're encoding
things and you know

00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:06.596 A:middle
that there's a bug back there
that you need to fix back

00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:07.796 A:middle
in Version 1 and you can do it

00:27:07.796 --> 00:27:10.686 A:middle
by encoding something
different, you might do that.

00:27:10.686 --> 00:27:11.866 A:middle
If you're looking at situations

00:27:11.866 --> 00:27:15.666 A:middle
where you're pulling new keys
in, the old code isn't going

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:17.326 A:middle
to go looking for those
new keys, so it's going

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:19.096 A:middle
to ignore those things,
you're probably pretty safe.

00:27:20.136 --> 00:27:23.216 A:middle
The new stuff you want to
make sure you're not stomping

00:27:23.216 --> 00:27:25.096 A:middle
on old keys, you're
not interfering

00:27:25.096 --> 00:27:26.656 A:middle
with the relationships
between keys.

00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:29.546 A:middle
When you encode and decode
that's your interface.

00:27:29.786 --> 00:27:32.336 A:middle
I know I'm writing out
four something that's going

00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:34.826 A:middle
to pick us up and I don't know
what version it's going to be.

00:27:34.826 --> 00:27:37.476 A:middle
Or, I'm getting data
back in I have no idea

00:27:37.476 --> 00:27:38.106 A:middle
where it's coming from.

00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:41.936 A:middle
Right? Make sure your
keys are unique, right?

00:27:41.936 --> 00:27:43.706 A:middle
If somebody's sub-classing
your stuff

00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:45.586 A:middle
and they're sending stuff back
and forth but they're depending

00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:46.966 A:middle
on your framework, you won't

00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:49.646 A:middle
to actually stomp
on their name space.

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:54.746 A:middle
Right? So the keys, even though
we're getting some name spacing

00:27:54.746 --> 00:27:56.616 A:middle
behavior in Swift, the
keys in these kinds

00:27:56.616 --> 00:27:58.686 A:middle
of things aren't
name spaced at all.

00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So make sure they're unique.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So make sure they're unique.

00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.916 A:middle
Use the prefixes, if you want

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:05.046 A:middle
to be really defensive use your
bundle ID, prefix it there.

00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:10.476 A:middle
One of the ways you can also
mention this, I didn't put it

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:12.676 A:middle
on the slide, one of the ways
you can also work with this is

00:28:12.676 --> 00:28:14.236 A:middle
by conforming to
NS secure coding.

00:28:14.966 --> 00:28:16.576 A:middle
Right? Secure coding
will make sure

00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:19.996 A:middle
that you're only getting the
objects out of the archive

00:28:19.996 --> 00:28:21.316 A:middle
that you're expecting
to be there.

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:24.626 A:middle
Also, start looking for
feature availability.

00:28:25.566 --> 00:28:29.276 A:middle
Right? Classes respond to
selectors for a reason.

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:30.266 A:middle
If you're in some code

00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:32.336 A:middle
and you're using somebody else's
framework you want to make sure

00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:34.456 A:middle
that your code is going
to keep functioning

00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:35.456 A:middle
if something gets updated.

00:28:36.286 --> 00:28:37.726 A:middle
Check to see if it
respondsToSelector.

00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:39.506 A:middle
Check NSClassFromString.

00:28:39.506 --> 00:28:43.696 A:middle
Do those things in order to make
sure that when you're working

00:28:43.696 --> 00:28:46.366 A:middle
with all of this
stuff you don't wind

00:28:46.366 --> 00:28:48.826 A:middle
up accidently pantsing the
user and killing their app

00:28:48.856 --> 00:28:53.316 A:middle
because of sending a message
to a string or a variable

00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:56.276 A:middle
that doesn't respond to that
message except in Version 2.

00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:59.946 A:middle
Okay, this is all
awesome, great.

00:29:01.386 --> 00:29:04.856 A:middle
How does all this work?

00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:07.256 A:middle
Pretty well actually.

00:29:08.536 --> 00:29:12.456 A:middle
If you follow me on
the social networks

00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:15.506 A:middle
of the day you probably
know that I had a dog.

00:29:16.876 --> 00:29:17.886 A:middle
This is my dog.

00:29:19.436 --> 00:29:20.206 A:middle
This is Buddy.

00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:24.646 A:middle
He's got a 60-pound bark
and a 30-pound body.

00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:27.326 A:middle
He's about this tall.

00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:30.666 A:middle
And he's cute, and I post
a lot of pictures of my dog

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:33.396 A:middle
because I can't really post
anything about work [laughter].

00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:40.936 A:middle
So, a lot of people
like to say, "Hey,

00:29:40.936 --> 00:29:42.556 A:middle
Chris, your dog is awesome."

00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:45.546 A:middle
You know, "Can I
borrow your dog?"

00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:46.836 A:middle
"I'd love to meet your dog."

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.166 A:middle
"Your dog would be a
great part of my life."

00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.726 A:middle
I'm not giving away
my dog, sorry.

00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:52.146 A:middle
You can't have him.

00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:56.296 A:middle
But I am pleased to talk a
little bit about a prototype

00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:57.796 A:middle
that I've been working on.

00:29:58.376 --> 00:30:04.186 A:middle
It's called Budstagram
and it's a way


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.376 --> 00:30:04.186 A:middle
It's called Budstagram
and it's a way

00:30:04.186 --> 00:30:05.366 A:middle
that you can take your pictures

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.786 A:middle
and put my dog into
them [laughter].

00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:07.373 A:middle
So --

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:13.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:14.316 --> 00:30:16.536 A:middle
What we'll do is I'm
going to take a quick tour

00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:21.546 A:middle
through Xcode both on -- for
what I've done so far with this

00:30:21.546 --> 00:30:25.456 A:middle
and just to walk through the
initial setup of an extension

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:26.986 A:middle
and an application
and a framework.

00:30:27.646 --> 00:30:29.816 A:middle
But you're going to be able
to do this kind of thing.

00:30:29.816 --> 00:30:33.096 A:middle
The idea is -- but this is
a terrible picture isn't it?

00:30:33.096 --> 00:30:34.366 A:middle
This is a beach in Corsica.

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:35.856 A:middle
I went on a biking
trip a while back.

00:30:36.806 --> 00:30:38.016 A:middle
Our ride wound up here.

00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:39.706 A:middle
It was absolutely gorgeous.

00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:41.406 A:middle
We were going to try and
stay a couple of days

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.566 A:middle
but they weren't
going to let us do it.

00:30:42.566 --> 00:30:44.566 A:middle
But this is a great picture
but I really missed Buddy.

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:47.106 A:middle
I'd been gone about
10 days by this point

00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:49.836 A:middle
and it's a great
picture but now,

00:30:50.506 --> 00:30:52.966 A:middle
now it's an even better
picture having been photo bombed

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:54.026 A:middle
by my dog.

00:30:54.746 --> 00:30:54.846 A:middle
So --

00:30:55.516 --> 00:30:57.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:58.276 --> 00:31:00.486 A:middle
We're going to take a
look at three things.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.276 --> 00:31:00.486 A:middle
We're going to take a
look at three things.

00:31:01.196 --> 00:31:04.556 A:middle
Budstagram, the application,
is sort of the icon

00:31:04.556 --> 00:31:06.516 A:middle
that the user sees,
it's the place

00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:07.236 A:middle
that they're going to start.

00:31:07.236 --> 00:31:11.106 A:middle
Right? It's going to allow
posting and editing of photos,

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:16.066 A:middle
and as long as there's a picture
of Buddy in there it'll post.

00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:18.416 A:middle
We'd like to allow some
comments on existing photos,

00:31:18.516 --> 00:31:20.146 A:middle
sort of a feed kind
of mechanism.

00:31:20.576 --> 00:31:24.266 A:middle
You may have seen apps like this
before somewhere, I'm not sure.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:27.106 A:middle
And we're going to have it
share a posting view controller

00:31:27.106 --> 00:31:27.946 A:middle
with the extension.

00:31:28.266 --> 00:31:29.426 A:middle
Right? We want to
share that code

00:31:29.426 --> 00:31:31.496 A:middle
so it winds up in both places.

00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:34.876 A:middle
The extension is going to allow
posting and editing of photos

00:31:34.876 --> 00:31:36.766 A:middle
within other apps,
but it's not going

00:31:36.766 --> 00:31:38.356 A:middle
to allow comments
on existing photos.

00:31:38.356 --> 00:31:39.796 A:middle
We're not going to put
the feed in the extension.

00:31:39.796 --> 00:31:41.146 A:middle
That's the business
of the application.

00:31:41.396 --> 00:31:43.266 A:middle
And that's actually one
thing about this architecture

00:31:43.266 --> 00:31:44.686 A:middle
in the frameworks and stuff
like that that you want

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:45.626 A:middle
to be really careful about.

00:31:46.276 --> 00:31:47.486 A:middle
Right? You don't want to wind

00:31:47.486 --> 00:31:50.356 A:middle
up with your entire application
suddenly living in the framework

00:31:50.416 --> 00:31:52.806 A:middle
because not all of your
applications can be appropriate

00:31:52.806 --> 00:31:53.996 A:middle
for the extension or not all

00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:56.356 A:middle
of your applications can be
appropriate for publishing

00:31:56.356 --> 00:31:57.416 A:middle
as a third party framework.

00:31:57.526 --> 00:31:59.566 A:middle
There's the things that
are common to your service

00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.346 A:middle
and there are things that
make your app unique.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.346 A:middle
and there are things that
make your app unique.

00:32:02.736 --> 00:32:05.296 A:middle
Right? So you want to try and
keep those two things separate.

00:32:06.276 --> 00:32:08.746 A:middle
And it's going to share
the posting view controller

00:32:08.746 --> 00:32:09.876 A:middle
with the application obviously.

00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:12.116 A:middle
The framework is going

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:14.106 A:middle
to contain the shared
posting view controller

00:32:14.386 --> 00:32:16.386 A:middle
and the shared networking code

00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:17.756 A:middle
for posting and things
like that.

00:32:17.756 --> 00:32:18.546 A:middle
And the model code.

00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:21.436 A:middle
Right? All the stuff that
makes up the common things

00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:23.376 A:middle
that the extension needs
to know to be able to deal

00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:26.116 A:middle
with the objects that the
applications also deal with.

00:32:26.606 --> 00:32:29.626 A:middle
So we have the Budstagram
application here.

00:32:30.506 --> 00:32:33.386 A:middle
And if I tap on it,
there's Bud in Corsica,

00:32:33.386 --> 00:32:37.026 A:middle
this is the feed here,
and if we were going

00:32:37.026 --> 00:32:38.316 A:middle
to post something
here, this is a picture

00:32:38.316 --> 00:32:39.946 A:middle
of my parents' backyard

00:32:39.946 --> 00:32:44.276 A:middle
in Connecticut looking very
New England in the fall

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:45.946 A:middle
and it's very pretty and
I can't bring Bud there

00:32:45.946 --> 00:32:46.906 A:middle
because he doesn't like to fly.

00:32:48.176 --> 00:32:49.536 A:middle
We've got this app,
we've got the extension,

00:32:49.536 --> 00:32:50.236 A:middle
they work together.

00:32:50.236 --> 00:32:52.466 A:middle
You're going to be able to
take data from the extension,

00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:55.136 A:middle
throw it into the application
and the code that you're going

00:32:55.136 --> 00:32:57.146 A:middle
to share between the
two, you're only going

00:32:57.146 --> 00:32:59.306 A:middle
to use in the framework.

00:32:59.356 --> 00:33:02.396 A:middle
So you don't have to be
jocking targets, you don't have


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.356 --> 00:33:02.396 A:middle
So you don't have to be
jocking targets, you don't have

00:33:02.396 --> 00:33:04.126 A:middle
to be shuffling stuff
around, things like that.

00:33:04.126 --> 00:33:05.666 A:middle
So, let's take a look at Xcode.

00:33:06.576 --> 00:33:08.636 A:middle
So let's take a look
at a new Xcode project.

00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:12.406 A:middle
I'm going to start from scratch
here mostly to give you sort

00:33:12.406 --> 00:33:15.206 A:middle
of an orientation before I start
jumping around in Budstagram

00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:16.066 A:middle
to show you what I did.

00:33:16.066 --> 00:33:20.416 A:middle
So, what we've got here
is the start of, say,

00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:22.676 A:middle
a tabbed application or
a page-based application.

00:33:22.676 --> 00:33:25.196 A:middle
Let's go with the single
view application here just

00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:26.196 A:middle
for the basics.

00:33:26.336 --> 00:33:30.066 A:middle
We'll call this framework
example

00:33:30.066 --> 00:33:31.836 A:middle
because I'm not particularly
creative.

00:33:33.196 --> 00:33:36.106 A:middle
And we've got a language
choice here, I'm going to stick

00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:39.026 A:middle
with Objective-C for a
minute and we'll just --

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:44.896 A:middle
oh, I am not an organization
unto myself, so we'll call

00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:47.316 A:middle
that Apple, Incorporated.

00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:49.286 A:middle
Desktop will create this.

00:33:49.996 --> 00:33:52.416 A:middle
So we've got here now
is just an application.

00:33:53.396 --> 00:33:57.506 A:middle
Right? And there's some
different things here,

00:33:57.506 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
there's some build settings, and
build phases, and all this stuff


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.506 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
there's some build settings, and
build phases, and all this stuff

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:01.176 A:middle
that you're familiar with.

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:04.396 A:middle
You'll see the link binary
with libraries bit here.

00:34:05.046 --> 00:34:07.346 A:middle
And if you were just going

00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:08.775 A:middle
to have an application
this would be fine,

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:11.596 A:middle
you'd work with this and
you'd put all of your code in

00:34:11.596 --> 00:34:13.956 A:middle
and your tabs and you'd work
with your targets and things

00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:15.866 A:middle
like that, but we're
actually going to go ahead

00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:17.036 A:middle
and create a new target here.

00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:19.976 A:middle
And we'll create a new
framework and library target,

00:34:19.976 --> 00:34:20.996 A:middle
a Cocoa Touch Framework.

00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:28.886 A:middle
We'll call this --
let's call it Budstakit.

00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:30.406 A:middle
And you'll see two
new things here.

00:34:30.406 --> 00:34:33.426 A:middle
It says here the project is
the framework example here,

00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:36.186 A:middle
and embed in application
framework example.

00:34:36.186 --> 00:34:41.616 A:middle
So, we're creating this new
framework and Xcode's also going

00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:44.036 A:middle
to set it up so that when
a framework builds and then

00:34:44.036 --> 00:34:46.146 A:middle
when you go and archive
it all that stuff winds

00:34:46.146 --> 00:34:47.016 A:middle
up in the right place.

00:34:48.005 --> 00:34:49.056 A:middle
So we can do Finish here.

00:34:49.716 --> 00:34:53.146 A:middle
And now we've got the link
binary with libraries there.

00:34:53.146 --> 00:34:54.856 A:middle
Budstakit framework is required.

00:34:56.376 --> 00:34:58.886 A:middle
And let's go ahead and actually
create the extension here too

00:34:58.886 --> 00:34:59.546 A:middle
while we're at it.

00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
So here's an application
extension.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
So here's an application
extension.

00:35:01.636 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
We'll use a share extension.

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:12.596 A:middle
Okay, and this'll be the
BudstaPosting extension.

00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:20.836 A:middle
Okay. So now we've got
BudstaKit, BudstaPosting.

00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:27.096 A:middle
The BudstaPosting bits have the
share view controller in here,

00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:29.526 A:middle
and a storyboard for that.

00:35:29.976 --> 00:35:31.486 A:middle
Let's see.

00:35:32.036 --> 00:35:36.786 A:middle
We pause for station
identification.

00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:40.986 A:middle
So there's nothing in
BudstaKit right now.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.366 A:middle
There's nothing in the --

00:35:42.366 --> 00:35:45.086 A:middle
there's this sort of empty
share view controller in here.

00:35:45.086 --> 00:35:47.266 A:middle
And we've got this
ViewController

00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:50.276 A:middle
for the framework example
for the application.

00:35:50.816 --> 00:35:54.056 A:middle
One of the things that I
mentioned before was I wanted

00:35:54.056 --> 00:35:56.746 A:middle
to be able to have the share
view controller be part

00:35:56.746 --> 00:35:57.606 A:middle
of the framework.

00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:59.216 A:middle
Right? Because I
want to use that both

00:35:59.216 --> 00:36:03.816 A:middle
in Budstagram itself
and in the extension.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.216 --> 00:36:03.816 A:middle
in Budstagram itself
and in the extension.

00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:06.046 A:middle
BudstaPosting is the extension.

00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:09.926 A:middle
All of this stuff,
if we go look,

00:36:09.926 --> 00:36:11.726 A:middle
let's take a quick look
at the Finder here.

00:36:12.306 --> 00:36:18.016 A:middle
Actually, if we go look in the
framework example folder, right,

00:36:18.766 --> 00:36:22.606 A:middle
Xcodes are organizing all
the code in directories here,

00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:26.866 A:middle
but the directory -- obviously
directory hierarchy is not

00:36:26.866 --> 00:36:30.016 A:middle
necessarily reflected in how
Xcode shows that in its files

00:36:31.276 --> 00:36:31.746 A:middle
and groups thing here.

00:36:31.746 --> 00:36:40.606 A:middle
But we're going to just move
these guys up into here.

00:36:42.106 --> 00:36:44.666 A:middle
So I'm just making the
share view controller part

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:46.666 A:middle
of the BudstaKit group,
it's not actually moved

00:36:46.666 --> 00:36:50.316 A:middle
out of the directory that
it's in behind the scenes.

00:36:50.356 --> 00:36:53.176 A:middle
But, you know, if you feel like
you want to do that go ahead

00:36:53.176 --> 00:36:54.756 A:middle
and move it with your
version controller system

00:36:54.756 --> 00:36:56.226 A:middle
over into the right spot.

00:36:56.596 --> 00:36:58.926 A:middle
Here in the BudstaKit header
I'm going to go ahead and,

00:36:59.126 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
it says here, in this header,

00:36:59.126 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
it says here, in this header,

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.736 A:middle
you should import all
the public headers

00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:03.456 A:middle
of your framework
using statements

00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:05.256 A:middle
like import BudstaKit
PublicHeader.

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:14.906 A:middle
So let's do import
BudstaKit ShareViewController.

00:37:15.436 --> 00:37:17.996 A:middle
Hello code completion.

00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:22.956 A:middle
And then we need to make
sure that we change these

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:24.176 A:middle
to be part of the right targets.

00:37:24.176 --> 00:37:27.456 A:middle
Over here on the right-hand side
ShareViewController.m is part

00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:29.756 A:middle
of the BudstaPosting target, we
actually want to make it part

00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:30.816 A:middle
of the BudstaKit target.

00:37:30.816 --> 00:37:32.776 A:middle
And the thing that
you're going to do

00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:33.946 A:middle
with the frameworks is different

00:37:33.946 --> 00:37:35.846 A:middle
than what you've probably
been doing before,

00:37:35.846 --> 00:37:38.476 A:middle
is within a framework
there are some designations

00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:39.916 A:middle
for what a header means.

00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:42.306 A:middle
So, you're actually going
to wind up adding the header

00:37:42.606 --> 00:37:44.266 A:middle
to be part of the
target of the framework,

00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:46.586 A:middle
which isn't necessarily
something you've really

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:47.136 A:middle
done before.

00:37:47.136 --> 00:37:49.186 A:middle
Right? Usually you use
the headers, the .m's,

00:37:49.186 --> 00:37:50.666 A:middle
or the .s's are part
of the framework --

00:37:51.006 --> 00:37:53.746 A:middle
or the target, the headers are
just loose, they never wind

00:37:53.746 --> 00:37:54.476 A:middle
up getting distributed.

00:37:54.676 --> 00:37:56.506 A:middle
So since this is a framework
and you're going to hand it

00:37:56.506 --> 00:37:57.656 A:middle
out to people, you're
going to be handing it

00:37:57.656 --> 00:37:59.276 A:middle
out to other developers on
your team, you're going to want

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.796 A:middle
to tell us whether this
thing is a project header,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.796 A:middle
to tell us whether this
thing is a project header,

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:03.706 A:middle
a private header,
or a public header.

00:38:04.806 --> 00:38:07.966 A:middle
Right? So the project header
means that only things

00:38:07.966 --> 00:38:09.036 A:middle
within the project can see it.

00:38:09.976 --> 00:38:11.136 A:middle
The private header goes --

00:38:11.136 --> 00:38:12.676 A:middle
anything that's marked
as a private header goes

00:38:12.676 --> 00:38:15.416 A:middle
into a private header's
directory inside the framework

00:38:15.866 --> 00:38:17.176 A:middle
when that framework gets built.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:22.686 A:middle
Right? The public portion of it
is obviously the public headers,

00:38:22.776 --> 00:38:25.196 A:middle
it's the headers that are just
in the headers directory there.

00:38:25.196 --> 00:38:27.996 A:middle
I'm going to make
this a public header.

00:38:27.996 --> 00:38:30.656 A:middle
You might use private
headers because just

00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:33.346 A:middle
like us you've got SPI that
you don't want people to use

00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:36.096 A:middle
but it's really handy to be
able to use it internally

00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:37.686 A:middle
or across two projects,

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:40.256 A:middle
and maybe that SPI is something
you want to publish later

00:38:40.256 --> 00:38:43.416 A:middle
but it's not quite bulletproof
enough to be able to be API now.

00:38:43.796 --> 00:38:45.026 A:middle
You'll put that in
a private header.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.976 A:middle
If you publish your
framework, don't forget

00:38:47.976 --> 00:38:50.666 A:middle
to remove the private headers
directory from the framework,

00:38:51.266 --> 00:38:55.386 A:middle
because then everybody
can grope all over it.

00:38:56.326 --> 00:39:00.546 A:middle
So, and then down here in the
BudstaPosting thing, well,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:56.326 --> 00:39:00.546 A:middle
So, and then down here in the
BudstaPosting thing, well,

00:39:00.546 --> 00:39:01.946 A:middle
we're going to have
to edit the target.

00:39:02.086 --> 00:39:06.056 A:middle
So, let's go back up to
this framework example here,

00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:08.876 A:middle
and if I look at BudstaKit,

00:39:08.876 --> 00:39:11.296 A:middle
BudstaKit is linking
with no libraries.

00:39:11.296 --> 00:39:13.426 A:middle
The framework example is
linking with BudstaKit.

00:39:13.606 --> 00:39:16.946 A:middle
I need to make BudstaPosting
link with BudstaKit,

00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:20.496 A:middle
so what I can do is just drag
this guy here -- no, okay.

00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:24.066 A:middle
We'll pick a plus, we'll choose
BudstaKit from the project,

00:39:24.926 --> 00:39:27.456 A:middle
and now all of those
things will link together.

00:39:27.456 --> 00:39:30.276 A:middle
So now ShareViewController
is now part of the framework.

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:35.746 A:middle
Since BudstaPosting the
extension links the framework

00:39:35.746 --> 00:39:37.246 A:middle
and the app links the
framework they can both

00:39:37.246 --> 00:39:38.866 A:middle
use ShareViewController.

00:39:38.866 --> 00:39:41.556 A:middle
Let's go ahead and build
that for the simulator.

00:39:42.126 --> 00:39:45.086 A:middle
And then let's take
a quick look here

00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:46.636 A:middle
at what actually got produced.

00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:49.186 A:middle
So, if we go look at -- I moved
my build directory up here

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:51.026 A:middle
on the desktop so it
would be easier to find.

00:39:51.626 --> 00:39:54.756 A:middle
And if we go look in products
here, we've got a couple

00:39:54.756 --> 00:39:55.756 A:middle
of different products based

00:39:55.756 --> 00:39:59.296 A:middle
on our target configuration
and our target.

00:39:59.516 --> 00:40:02.776 A:middle
Here's sort of everything
spread out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.516 --> 00:40:02.776 A:middle
Here's sort of everything
spread out.

00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:04.656 A:middle
Right? So here's
BudstaKit.framework.

00:40:04.656 --> 00:40:05.696 A:middle
Here's the app.

00:40:06.126 --> 00:40:08.866 A:middle
Here's my Budstagram application
that I was building earlier.

00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:12.336 A:middle
Let's look at framework example.

00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:15.546 A:middle
Inside that is now a couple
of different directories.

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:18.356 A:middle
This frameworks directory has
the BudstaKit framework inside

00:40:18.356 --> 00:40:21.776 A:middle
of it and let's get
all old school

00:40:21.776 --> 00:40:22.976 A:middle
and go look in the
terminal here.

00:40:32.256 --> 00:40:33.556 A:middle
The old tricks are the best.

00:40:33.936 --> 00:40:36.756 A:middle
And the BudstaKit framework
has inside it this headers

00:40:36.756 --> 00:40:39.766 A:middle
directory, and a module.

00:40:40.666 --> 00:40:44.516 A:middle
Modules are generated for use
with Swift and for the module

00:40:44.516 --> 00:40:46.166 A:middle
at import directive
for Objective-C.

00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:47.966 A:middle
There's some nifty things
that go along with that.

00:40:47.966 --> 00:40:49.296 A:middle
But those are things
that you should read

00:40:49.296 --> 00:40:50.626 A:middle
about in the Xcode
documentation.

00:40:50.756 --> 00:40:54.496 A:middle
So, the framework is built
into the application,

00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:58.146 A:middle
that's actually one thing to
be aware of is you're going

00:40:58.146 --> 00:41:00.686 A:middle
to have multiple copies of the
frameworks on disk at a time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.146 --> 00:41:00.686 A:middle
to have multiple copies of the
frameworks on disk at a time.

00:41:00.686 --> 00:41:03.816 A:middle
We're not sharing frameworks
across sandbox boundaries.

00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:06.656 A:middle
Right? Things inside the same
sandbox could access the same

00:41:06.656 --> 00:41:09.526 A:middle
framework, but we're not
letting you use the framework

00:41:09.526 --> 00:41:11.376 A:middle
out of some other
application installed even

00:41:11.376 --> 00:41:12.046 A:middle
if it's one of your own.

00:41:12.046 --> 00:41:14.886 A:middle
All right, so all of these
things get imbedded directly

00:41:14.886 --> 00:41:15.576 A:middle
in the application.

00:41:15.576 --> 00:41:20.006 A:middle
So your apps are still
completely stand-alone items.

00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:25.496 A:middle
So, let's go back to this
and take a quick look here.

00:41:25.956 --> 00:41:32.076 A:middle
Because the extension is its own
little application some things

00:41:32.076 --> 00:41:33.226 A:middle
you need to be aware
of are things

00:41:33.226 --> 00:41:35.326 A:middle
like NSBundleMainBundle
isn't going

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.556 A:middle
to work exactly the
way you think.

00:41:36.636 --> 00:41:38.196 A:middle
So you're going to have
to go look for assets

00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:43.496 A:middle
by bundle identifier
using the bundle API.

00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:45.576 A:middle
No that isn't a bug
I ran into myself

00:41:45.576 --> 00:41:48.706 A:middle
that I introduced,
why do you ask?

00:41:49.256 --> 00:41:54.826 A:middle
So, and the ShareViewController
has the standard extension stuff

00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:56.986 A:middle
here for things like
isContentValid, didSelect.

00:41:56.986 --> 00:42:00.916 A:middle
These are peculiar to
the ShareViewController


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:56.986 --> 00:42:00.916 A:middle
These are peculiar to
the ShareViewController

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:03.506 A:middle
but there are other API on
all the other extensions

00:42:03.506 --> 00:42:04.856 A:middle
that are specific
to those as well.

00:42:05.546 --> 00:42:07.896 A:middle
So let's actually take a look
and see how I sort of divided

00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:10.196 A:middle
up BudstaKit and Budstagram.

00:42:11.286 --> 00:42:18.626 A:middle
So, there are a lot of
really similar things here

00:42:18.626 --> 00:42:21.116 A:middle
to the way everything
got broken down.

00:42:22.216 --> 00:42:26.736 A:middle
Not really tall enough to
point up there but you'll see

00:42:26.736 --> 00:42:30.066 A:middle
that we've got the
feed view controller

00:42:30.066 --> 00:42:32.516 A:middle
and a posting view controller,
which are the two things

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:35.396 A:middle
that you saw in the tab
view in the demo earlier,

00:42:35.816 --> 00:42:38.816 A:middle
and then the main storyboard
contains those two things.

00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:40.726 A:middle
And then there's a bunch
of model code that's

00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:43.446 A:middle
down in BudstaKit, and
BudstaKit has all of the stuff

00:42:43.806 --> 00:42:46.646 A:middle
like the public umbrella header.

00:42:47.516 --> 00:42:50.736 A:middle
Right? So just like you just
type importUIKit.h you should

00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:51.856 A:middle
setting your umbrella header

00:42:51.856 --> 00:42:53.166 A:middle
in your framework to
do the same thing.

00:42:53.166 --> 00:42:57.846 A:middle
Put all your public API in there
so you'll import BudstaKit.h.

00:42:58.086 --> 00:43:00.266 A:middle
Or at list I hope
you will someday.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.086 --> 00:43:00.266 A:middle
Or at list I hope
you will someday.

00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:03.036 A:middle
And then also, all of the model
codes down there, so the thing

00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:04.416 A:middle
that manages a post is there.

00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:06.786 A:middle
And the post view
that displays a post

00:43:06.786 --> 00:43:10.876 A:middle
with the dog resizable there

00:43:10.876 --> 00:43:12.346 A:middle
and the ShareViewController
and things like that.

00:43:12.346 --> 00:43:14.096 A:middle
And then down here in
the Budstagram poster,

00:43:14.096 --> 00:43:15.016 A:middle
again, it's the same thing.

00:43:15.016 --> 00:43:17.046 A:middle
It's just the main
interface storyboard,

00:43:17.046 --> 00:43:19.066 A:middle
the empty storyboard, which
says when you call up one

00:43:19.066 --> 00:43:21.666 A:middle
of these things this is the
storyboard to launch into.

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:25.516 A:middle
Right now in the
extension that's it, right?

00:43:25.516 --> 00:43:27.876 A:middle
There's other logic that
lives in the framework

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:30.366 A:middle
that does all the other
work, the sending of the data

00:43:30.366 --> 00:43:33.506 A:middle
and the manipulation of the
photo and things like that.

00:43:34.546 --> 00:43:36.856 A:middle
So making sure that you're
pulling all of these things

00:43:36.856 --> 00:43:40.936 A:middle
down into the right place
is very, very, important.

00:43:41.836 --> 00:43:44.296 A:middle
Most of those 13 years I've
spent doing frameworks I've

00:43:44.296 --> 00:43:46.406 A:middle
worked for a lot of really
talented frameworks developers,

00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:51.276 A:middle
a lot of this stuff is
tremendously hard-won lessons

00:43:51.276 --> 00:43:52.466 A:middle
from shipping software.

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:57.046 A:middle
Right? Being clear,
being explicit,

00:43:57.806 --> 00:44:01.136 A:middle
having the right amount of
API, having expressive API,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:57.806 --> 00:44:01.136 A:middle
having the right amount of
API, having expressive API,

00:44:01.716 --> 00:44:04.086 A:middle
distributing things in the
right way, being careful

00:44:04.086 --> 00:44:06.406 A:middle
of your versions, making
sure that you're working

00:44:06.406 --> 00:44:09.986 A:middle
with data safely, getting
the right abstractions.

00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:13.786 A:middle
Right? All of those things make
our lives much, much easier.

00:44:13.786 --> 00:44:16.136 A:middle
Taking that frameworks approach
even to the applications.

00:44:16.136 --> 00:44:19.726 A:middle
If you look at most of our
applications, on the books,

00:44:20.536 --> 00:44:21.926 A:middle
you know, Maps has MapKit.

00:44:23.216 --> 00:44:26.036 A:middle
Right? On iOS 8,
Health has HealthKit.

00:44:27.326 --> 00:44:31.446 A:middle
Right? All of the things that
make the app function and useful

00:44:31.446 --> 00:44:32.796 A:middle
to the user live in the app.

00:44:32.876 --> 00:44:35.896 A:middle
All of the heavy lifting,
all of the shared code,

00:44:35.896 --> 00:44:38.006 A:middle
all of the interfaces that
allow the things to work

00:44:38.006 --> 00:44:40.206 A:middle
with your app go in
those frameworks.

00:44:40.616 --> 00:44:42.856 A:middle
Right? It's a great
separation for us,

00:44:42.856 --> 00:44:44.666 A:middle
it's what helps us
ship software,

00:44:45.076 --> 00:44:47.216 A:middle
it can be a great
separation for you as well.

00:44:47.586 --> 00:44:50.206 A:middle
There are some related
sessions that happened earlier

00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:51.706 A:middle
in the week and there's
one tomorrow.

00:44:51.706 --> 00:44:54.306 A:middle
Creating Extensions
for iOS and OS X,

00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:57.206 A:middle
Parts 1 and 2 were earlier.

00:44:57.516 --> 00:45:00.696 A:middle
Go watch those for breaking
up things into the extensions

00:44:57.516 --> 00:45:00.696 A:middle
Go watch those for breaking
up things into the extensions

00:45:00.696 --> 00:45:02.586 A:middle
and into the mechanics
of setting extensions up.

00:45:03.296 --> 00:45:05.646 A:middle
Right? And then apply some of
the stuff that you got here

00:45:05.646 --> 00:45:07.706 A:middle
or some of the stuff
that you got from Andy

00:45:07.706 --> 00:45:09.356 A:middle
and Collin's talk previously,

00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:12.216 A:middle
in the previous hour,
to all of that.

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.776 A:middle
And then sharing code
between iOS and OS X.

00:45:14.996 --> 00:45:19.366 A:middle
A lot of you work on
both platforms and a lot

00:45:19.366 --> 00:45:22.336 A:middle
of the model code and things
like that is actually shareable.

00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:25.856 A:middle
And much of the extensions
API was developed specifically

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.376 A:middle
with an eye to being
able to write

00:45:27.686 --> 00:45:31.916 A:middle
as much cross-platform code
as possible with as little

00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:34.026 A:middle
of the #ifs for target
OS as we could manage.

00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:37.116 A:middle
Right? So you will be
able to do a fair amount

00:45:37.116 --> 00:45:39.996 A:middle
of code sharing even for
extensions in iOS and OS X.

00:45:40.126 --> 00:45:42.836 A:middle
That's right here tomorrow
morning at 9:00 am.

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:43.996 A:middle
Bright and early.

00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:47.746 A:middle
Okay? So, please have an
absolutely fantastic remainder

00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:47.956 A:middle
of the week.

00:45:47.956 --> 00:45:48.246 A:middle
Enjoy the bash.

00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:48.976 A:middle
Thank you, very much.

00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:54.730 A:middle
