thank you for joining us.

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:33.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for coming
to spend time with us

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:34.486 A:middle
at the end of this long day.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:39.266 A:middle
It's for many of you who
were out there last night

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.416 A:middle
when I was leaving the
student event and putting

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.876 A:middle
out your chairs, it got real
cool on the sidewalk, I'm sure,

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.776 A:middle
and you spent a whole long
night waiting for this day,

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.106 A:middle
and you've been here,
and now you've joined us

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.206 A:middle
to celebrate some
excellent apps.

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And we are here
to award excellence

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.386 A:middle
in innovation on
both iOS and OS X.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.386 A:middle
And every year it gets
more and more difficult


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.386 A:middle
And every year it gets
more and more difficult

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:02.346 A:middle
to pick our design winners

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.906 A:middle
because there are
so many great apps.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:10.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So many of you, we
shared a statistic this morning

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:12.246 A:middle
that 70 percent of
the audience here

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:14.336 A:middle
at WWDC are new to the show.

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:16.296 A:middle
And so many of you
have never been

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:17.726 A:middle
to this show, the design awards.

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:19.846 A:middle
And so we thought
we'd take a moment

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.786 A:middle
to explain how we
pick the winners.

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:26.676 A:middle
We judge the winning apps
using sort of three major --

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.956 A:middle
we judge the winning apps
in three major areas.

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.396 A:middle
The first is around design.

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:35.736 A:middle
So for design, we look
at apps that are --

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.226 A:middle
we're looking for apps
that are easy to use.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.406 A:middle
Apps that are familiar.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.336 A:middle
That are consistent within
themselves, but consistent

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
within the operating
system as well.

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:48.166 A:middle
They have a great game loop,
so really excellent game play.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.846 A:middle
They're intuitive
and understandable

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:53.486 A:middle
and immediately useable by the
people who they were built for.

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:57.966 A:middle
And then we look at apps
in the technology --

00:01:58.116 --> 00:01:59.906 A:middle
we judge apps around technology.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:04.196 A:middle
So we're evaluating the
apps on their use of iOS

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:07.386 A:middle
or OS X frameworks to
do really cool stuff

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:10.076 A:middle
or to add really
valuable functionality.

00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:15.096 A:middle
Or we're also looking at whether
the app launches quickly.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:16.496 A:middle
Is it responsive?

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:20.496 A:middle
Does it take, you know, does it
work the way you would expect it

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:21.026 A:middle
to work?

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:23.976 A:middle
And is there smooth scrolling?

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:27.446 A:middle
We look at whether or not the
app runs on the latest OSs,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.216 A:middle
whether it takes advantage
of the newest hardware.

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:34.136 A:middle
And takes advantage of
things like M7 or A7 on iOS

00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:37.426 A:middle
or multicore or other
technologies

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:38.946 A:middle
and hardware technologies
on OS X.

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:43.506 A:middle
And then thirdly, we're
looking at apps from the point

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:44.576 A:middle
of view of innovation.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:48.976 A:middle
And innovation really is that
spark of brilliance, right,

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:53.796 A:middle
that uniqueness, the clever
implementation of something

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:56.556 A:middle
that you wouldn't have
expected in the first place,

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:59.456 A:middle
but then when you see it,
you're blown away by it.

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:02.946 A:middle
And there's just so many ways
to talk about innovation,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:02.946 A:middle
And there's just so many ways
to talk about innovation,

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:06.376 A:middle
but really it comes down to
the implementation of something

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:10.716 A:middle
that is just so fresh
and so compelling

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:12.286 A:middle
and done in a unique way.

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:15.456 A:middle
So those three areas are
how we judge the apps.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:18.876 A:middle
There's so many more things
we look at, but in a nutshell,

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:21.636 A:middle
they're grouped in
those three areas.

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:24.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So let's talk
about the prizes

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.676 A:middle
that our award winners
will be given to take home.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.746 A:middle
It's pretty much one of every
piece of hardware that we make.

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.906 A:middle
A Mac Pro with a cinema display.

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.246 A:middle
A 27-inch iMac.

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:34.726 A:middle
An Apple TV.

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:36.146 A:middle
A MacBook Air.

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:37.166 A:middle
A MacBook Pro.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.586 A:middle
An iPad. And an iPod touch.

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:41.716 A:middle

&gt;&gt; And, last but not least,

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:50.566 A:middle
probably the most coveted
part of the award is:

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:54.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get to take home
one of these 88 trophy cubes

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:59.206 A:middle
and these are, you know,
statically they detect touch,

on the top just like the
back of your MacBook Pro,

and we hope that
you're going to continue

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:12.156 A:middle
to produce some incredible apps

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:14.846 A:middle
that put the more
veteran developers who are

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:18.016 A:middle
in the audience, you know, give
them a run for the money, right?

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:19.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Like these apps,
who have been.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:20.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Like some of these apps.

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:22.996 A:middle
These were student
winners that we highlighted

00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:25.706 A:middle
in previous years, that
we demoed here on stage.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.036 A:middle
Some of them maybe have
changed names or what have you,

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.606 A:middle
but they were great
apps written by students

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:31.916 A:middle
over the past three years.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.626 A:middle

to our first winner.

is "PanoPerfect"

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.726 A:middle
"PanoPerfect" is a
fun and simple way

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:17.646 A:middle
to share beautiful
panoramic photos.

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:21.936 A:middle
These are two former high school
students that attended WWDC

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:25.616 A:middle
in 2012 on student
scholarships and built this app

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:28.986 A:middle
when they were inspired by our
'06 announcement of panoramics.

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:30.216 A:middle
And John's going to show us now.

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great story,
sitting in the keynote,

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:35.946 A:middle
watching something, and then
deciding to write an app.

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:39.156 A:middle
I think that's a great story.

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:43.206 A:middle
So "PanoPerfect" is
this app that allows you

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:49.166 A:middle
to view panoramic photos, and
it's there's just a community

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:50.976 A:middle
of people who love panoramas

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:54.326 A:middle
that are submitting
photos into the app.

00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:56.156 A:middle
So it's a familiar interface.

00:06:56.156 --> 00:06:57.686 A:middle

these guys are using UI kit
dynamics and image effects

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:05.156 A:middle
for blurs on some of the UI,
which we'll get to in a moment.

00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:07.436 A:middle
So this is the explorer,
this is kind

00:07:07.436 --> 00:07:09.106 A:middle
of a curated set of panoramas.

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:11.716 A:middle
If we go to nearby
they're using core location

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:12.696 A:middle
to determine where you are.

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:17.236 A:middle
And we're going to go in here,
hopefully, and load some panos.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:20.196 A:middle
Yeah, here's some
panos that are nearby.

00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:22.926 A:middle
A couple of them posted by
the creators of the app.

00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:25.406 A:middle
But let's just go into
this one: We double tap,

00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:28.766 A:middle
you can favorite it, you can
like it, you can comment on it.

00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:32.476 A:middle
And then you can double tap
and just go in and gesture

00:07:32.476 --> 00:07:36.156 A:middle
through the UI to go and
look at the entire panorama.

00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
And they're doing low res
thumbnails in the feed

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:44.026 A:middle
that you see here,
and then they're going

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:47.296 A:middle
to the high res full
panoramas when you go and look

00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:50.476 A:middle
into the individual image.

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:54.696 A:middle
So super cool app that
really was created

00:07:54.696 --> 00:07:59.546 A:middle
to address the experience that
at the time there was no support

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.106 A:middle
for panoramic images in a lot
of social networking apps.

really tremendous content.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:52.406 A:middle
And the creators of this
next app saw all of that,

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.536 A:middle
saw the growth that was going
on and also saw a specific need

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:58.106 A:middle
that they wanted to
step up to and solve.

00:08:58.106 --> 00:09:00.186 A:middle
So our winner does that.

a look at this app.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:01.456 A:middle
So I'm not going to get into
sinister, you know, situation,

00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:04.836 A:middle
get into that whole game
play, but these folks worked

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:07.616 A:middle
with folks from Sesame Workshop

00:10:08.136 --> 00:10:10.496 A:middle
and created some really
great artwork in the app.

00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:14.116 A:middle
The app is focused on teaching
children basic addition,

00:10:14.556 --> 00:10:17.396 A:middle
and for a lot of kids
this is a real struggle.

00:10:17.706 --> 00:10:20.966 A:middle
And so this developer set
out to solve this problem.

00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:22.566 A:middle
So we're going to
get into the app -

00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:24.986 A:middle
we'll skip over the narrative
at the beginning here.

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:28.056 A:middle
This is pretty straightforward
stuff.

00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:29.706 A:middle
So most of you are going
to get the answers right

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:31.396 A:middle
without even using the app.

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:36.816 A:middle
But the key here is that the app
is teaching children addition,

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:40.896 A:middle
and when you're first learning
addition, you just, you know,

00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:43.196 A:middle
the first thing you do is you
count on fingers, you just kind

00:10:43.196 --> 00:10:45.666 A:middle
of like 1, 2, 3, you count
them off individually.

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.556 A:middle
And so the app lets you do that.

00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:52.126 A:middle
And so I can just tap,
you know, I got 5,

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.556 A:middle
I got some feedback in the UI.

00:10:53.556 --> 00:10:57.686 A:middle
I move the slider bar with
the tactile fields to 5,

00:10:57.766 --> 00:11:00.656 A:middle
and I get confirmation that it's
the right answer, or I don't,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.766 --> 00:11:00.656 A:middle
and I get confirmation that it's
the right answer, or I don't,

00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:01.526 A:middle
it was the wrong answer.

00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:05.766 A:middle
I can also do count on, which is
a second kind of addition tool.

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.946 A:middle
So once the child has
learned to basically count

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:10.186 A:middle
through the numbers,
you know, the numbers,

00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:13.376 A:middle
then they can start moving on
to different kinds of addition

00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:15.596 A:middle
where they're going
to take a big number

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:17.276 A:middle
and add some smaller
numbers to it.

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.666 A:middle
So in this case, the child's
going to start to learn

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:24.676 A:middle
that you can start with 3 and
then do 1 more and get 4, right?

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:26.816 A:middle
There we go.

00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:29.286 A:middle
And the app continues to
go on and teach all kinds

00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:32.436 A:middle
of other tools and techniques
for learning, addition.

00:11:32.656 --> 00:11:35.126 A:middle
Another one is doubles,
where you basically start off

00:11:35.126 --> 00:11:38.936 A:middle
with say, you know, 3 and 4 is
7, and so first it shows you

00:11:38.936 --> 00:11:42.656 A:middle
that you can cut the 4 into a
3 and you get 3, 3, and 1 is 7.

00:11:43.146 --> 00:11:44.986 A:middle
The app is full of these
kinds of techniques

00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:46.866 A:middle
that take advantage
of iOS technologies

00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:50.676 A:middle
to do a really great experience
with large text, great colors,

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:53.936 A:middle
and an experience I think that
is really going to resonate

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:54.846 A:middle
with little, little kids.

00:11:55.336 --> 00:11:56.396 A:middle
So congratulations.

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:57.236 A:middle
Extremely well done.

00:11:57.596 --> 00:11:58.176 A:middle

so many games on the App Store.

looking through the best games

one was the one that needed

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:39.706 A:middle
to be a winner, and there are
many that needed to be a winner.

00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:42.316 A:middle
Unfortunately we can only
award so many tonight.

00:12:42.316 --> 00:12:45.856 A:middle
But one of the types of gaming
- one of the types of games

00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:48.486 A:middle
on the App Store that is super
popular that everybody loves,

00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:53.426 A:middle
that originated in the
'80s, is the platformer.

00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:56.576 A:middle
And in the platformer
game, it's a genre,

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:59.106 A:middle
what you're doing is you're
basically, you know, running

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:04.156 A:middle
and jumping, moving and jumping,
to avoid obstacles and get coins

and jumping, moving and jumping,
to avoid obstacles and get coins

and save people and get

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:07.536 A:middle
whatever you're getting.

00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:11.236 A:middle
And the whole point is to not
fall off the platform, right?

00:13:11.766 --> 00:13:14.766 A:middle
And the way you fall off the
platform is you get, you know,

00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:17.226 A:middle
speared, or some
obstacle hits you,

00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:18.876 A:middle
or something falls
on you or whatever.

00:13:18.876 --> 00:13:21.726 A:middle
But the point is that the
platform is a pretty loose term,

00:13:21.726 --> 00:13:23.246 A:middle
but you're moving
across this thing,

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
and it just goes
on and on and on.

00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:29.026 A:middle

has created, I think,

00:13:29.026 --> 00:13:31.786 A:middle

to uncover the truth

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:37.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, I'm not going
to go to the snow-capped peaks

00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:38.976 A:middle
or underwater or
anything like that.

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:41.006 A:middle
I'm going to show you
the basic game play

00:14:41.426 --> 00:14:44.316 A:middle
so that you get a sense
for what's going on.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:45.416 A:middle
If I can get the volume brought

00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:47.666 A:middle
down a little bit,
that would be great.

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:52.576 A:middle
All right, so "Leo's Fortune,"
you've got about 25 levels

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
or more that you can just swipe

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.816 A:middle
through in a very
familiar user interface.

00:14:57.176 --> 00:14:59.476 A:middle

1 because I want to point

00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:02.936 A:middle
out something that is such a
great example of their attention

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:02.936 A:middle
out something that is such a
great example of their attention

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:04.216 A:middle
to detail and the way

00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:05.756 A:middle
that they've done
things in this game.

00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:07.446 A:middle
So I'm going to start
the tutorial.

00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:09.756 A:middle
And this is really sort

00:15:09.756 --> 00:15:11.546 A:middle
of the onboarding
experience for the app.

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:14.016 A:middle
And there are so many apps
nowadays that are needing

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:17.936 A:middle
to do this, they want to get
you up, you know, into the app,

00:15:18.526 --> 00:15:21.126 A:middle
and help you understand
how to use the app.

00:15:21.316 --> 00:15:23.466 A:middle
And, you know, you don't
need something that's very,

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.286 A:middle
you know, that's super intense.

00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:28.776 A:middle
But to do this well
takes a lot of design

00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:29.996 A:middle
and I think a lot of thinking.

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:31.086 A:middle
And so I want to show you.

00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:32.666 A:middle
So the game starts
off like this,

00:15:33.116 --> 00:15:35.616 A:middle
and the first thing you're told
is where to place your thumbs.

00:15:35.886 --> 00:15:38.436 A:middle
And in order to do that,
you're immediately learning how

00:15:38.496 --> 00:15:39.996 A:middle
to hold the iPad
to play the game.

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:42.436 A:middle
So I'm going to put my left
thumb here, my right thumb here,

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:45.516 A:middle
and now the game starts to work,
and it's got these coach marks.

00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:48.096 A:middle
So I'm going to move the left
thumb, and we're going to start

00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:50.656 A:middle
to collect coins with Leo here.

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.626 A:middle
Okay, so here's the
platformer experience, right?

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:57.816 A:middle
You're driving along on this
so-called platform, and boom,

00:15:57.816 --> 00:15:59.306 A:middle
I'm stuck, I can't
get over this thing.

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.436 A:middle
But this onboarding experience
has these ghosting images,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.436 A:middle
But this onboarding experience
has these ghosting images,

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:05.066 A:middle
and they tell me that if
I move my right thumb up,

00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:08.836 A:middle
I can inflate Leo and
move him up and down.

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:12.316 A:middle
And now I'm dealing with
an obstacle in this case.

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:17.286 A:middle
Let's keep going.

00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:19.886 A:middle
I'm down there, no
problem, I can go back up.

00:16:19.886 --> 00:16:21.736 A:middle
I can inflate, nope, sorry.

00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:23.916 A:middle
Oh come on.

00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:26.826 A:middle
This is the problem
with these demos, right?

00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:31.416 A:middle
Okay, here we go, we land
on there, boom, ta-da,

00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:32.706 A:middle
here we are, we're
driving around.

00:16:32.706 --> 00:16:35.736 A:middle
And notice just the
effects in the background.

00:16:35.736 --> 00:16:39.556 A:middle
There's this perspective going
on, you've got petals flying

00:16:39.556 --> 00:16:42.696 A:middle
through the air, on other
levels there's rain falling,

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:46.156 A:middle
there's all kinds of stuff
happening in the distance.

00:16:46.156 --> 00:16:49.446 A:middle
And here, you're dealing
with this obstacle,

00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:51.706 A:middle
and the game is full of
these kinds of obstacles,

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:54.636 A:middle
where Leo has to solve - he
has to do something in one spot

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.426 A:middle
to open a door or
some kind of a bridge.

00:16:57.676 --> 00:16:59.726 A:middle
In this case, if I landed

inflate him, flip this around,

00:17:02.686 --> 00:17:05.276 A:middle
and then move along
and keep jumping.

And this is just a real
quick view of what's going

00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:10.586 A:middle
on in this game, but we
just thought they did

00:17:10.586 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
such a good job, for example,
with this kind of an S curve,

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:16.866 A:middle
which is really hard to
get, you know, to do well.

00:17:17.386 --> 00:17:19.306 A:middle

And then here again, this
onboarding experience,

00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:27.606 A:middle
but I'm actually playing it.

00:17:27.786 --> 00:17:32.036 A:middle
And you see that I'm supposed
to jump this guy, right, boom.

00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:34.386 A:middle
And then now I'm moving along.

the first level.

we just we love this game.

that I've learned over time and
other people have learned is

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:19.406 A:middle
that if you can capture some
of the things that are going on

00:18:19.406 --> 00:18:24.756 A:middle
and take a moment to record
an idea, a thought, a memory -

00:18:25.346 --> 00:18:27.996 A:middle
or something happens and it
triggers a thought and you want

00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:32.836 A:middle
to capture it - that that
exercise of writing things

00:18:32.836 --> 00:18:36.426 A:middle
down for a moment, to just
capturing these little bits

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:39.006 A:middle
of information throughout

00:18:39.096 --> 00:18:40.796 A:middle

But we thought we'd award it
for the Mac and show it off

00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:08.226 A:middle
on the Mac, because so many of
us are so busy as developers,

00:20:08.726 --> 00:20:10.586 A:middle
on our Macs every day
- we're writing code,

00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:14.106 A:middle
we're spending time in Xcode
or we're doing, you know,

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:16.176 A:middle
using various tools, you
could be in a spreadsheet,

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:18.366 A:middle
you could be writing
some sort of a document.

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:21.106 A:middle
But along the way,
something might happen -

00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:22.796 A:middle
you might get a phone
call, a thought pops

00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:24.556 A:middle
into mind, an email arrives.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:27.176 A:middle
And you might want
to record an idea

00:20:27.176 --> 00:20:28.476 A:middle
or put something quickly down,

00:20:28.476 --> 00:20:30.016 A:middle
which is a big part
of journaling.

these little nuggets.

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:37.866 A:middle
And so "Day One" just
builds a little menu extra

00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:40.346 A:middle
that you can type in and
put some sort of entry in,

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:43.516 A:middle
and that'll go straight into the

to your work.

earlier, so I can take this
picture, drop it into here,

00:21:20.006 --> 00:21:22.516 A:middle
and "Day One"'s going to either
take the date from the picture

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.126 A:middle
or just say leave
it unchanged based

00:21:24.126 --> 00:21:25.876 A:middle
on the date I'm answering
this journal entry.

00:21:26.356 --> 00:21:29.556 A:middle
And then I say I'm done, I
can tag it with various tags

00:21:29.556 --> 00:21:31.956 A:middle
that are in the system,
I can add a location,

00:21:31.956 --> 00:21:33.356 A:middle
they've got maps integration,

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:35.366 A:middle
so I could say use current
location if I'd like.

00:21:36.016 --> 00:21:39.266 A:middle
And I'm done, and there's the
entry in there, and I can look

And if you've not

00:24:36.686 --> 00:24:39.256 A:middle
you need to see it
from the start.

00:24:39.636 --> 00:24:42.686 A:middle
So the basic point of the game
is, you know, as Shaan said,

00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:46.656 A:middle
you gesture and you draw
this little line to knock

00:24:46.726 --> 00:24:49.586 A:middle
out the colored dots, and
when you get to a level

00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:51.636 A:middle
where there are black dots,
you want to avoid those.

00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:53.236 A:middle
But, you know, at
the first level,

00:24:53.236 --> 00:24:56.886 A:middle
you're just starting off
here with this gesture.

00:24:57.586 --> 00:25:00.896 A:middle

as I'm playing here,

And you know, notice
as I'm playing here,

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:03.966 A:middle
that there is nothing
extra onscreen,

00:25:03.966 --> 00:25:06.746 A:middle
it's just the dots,
it's just my gesture.

00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:10.586 A:middle
And the gesture, the rendering
of the gesture is almost

00:25:10.586 --> 00:25:15.056 A:middle
like calligraphy, I mean,
it has a flair to it,

00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:19.746 A:middle
it's representative of the speed
of my stroke, the exact timing,

00:25:20.126 --> 00:25:22.336 A:middle
the length and everything.

00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:23.496 A:middle
So let me get rid
of these three.

00:25:24.326 --> 00:25:25.456 A:middle
So those are easy levels.

00:25:25.456 --> 00:25:28.826 A:middle
Let me jump up to level 8 here

00:25:28.826 --> 00:25:30.076 A:middle
for a moment, which
is kind of fun.

00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:33.016 A:middle
So here I've got an
instance where I've got

00:25:33.016 --> 00:25:35.306 A:middle
to avoid the black dots
but get the white ones -

00:25:35.386 --> 00:25:36.486 A:middle
or get the colored ones.

00:25:36.486 --> 00:25:39.466 A:middle
And to do that I've got to
figure out what gesture to do

00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:41.786 A:middle
that will repeat
across the screen

00:25:41.786 --> 00:25:43.386 A:middle
to remove these colored dots.

00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:46.236 A:middle
Now, the other thing that's
super cool about this app is

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:49.776 A:middle
that it leverages audio

00:26:05.246 --> 00:26:06.696 A:middle
You know, so here
I'm messing up.

00:26:06.696 --> 00:26:07.986 A:middle
Let me try to do it right.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:14.486 A:middle
Not quite, not quite, not quite.

00:26:15.046 --> 00:26:18.186 A:middle
And the thing about this
game is it's like that.

00:26:18.186 --> 00:26:20.526 A:middle
You're like "Oh blast," and
the sound just gives you this

00:26:20.636 --> 00:26:21.866 A:middle
great feedback.

00:26:21.866 --> 00:26:24.216 A:middle
One last try.

00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:29.536 A:middle
No, come on, John.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:33.276 A:middle
Okay, I give up.

00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:36.386 A:middle
That's the problem
with these demos.

00:26:36.736 --> 00:26:39.086 A:middle
Yeah, we love this game
for the minimalist design,

00:26:39.136 --> 00:26:43.106 A:middle
the great integration with the
touch, you know, system of iOS,

00:26:43.106 --> 00:26:47.956 A:middle
just that expression of
just a great engagement,

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:51.736 A:middle
this great expression of the
game in a very simplistic way

00:26:51.906 --> 00:26:53.556 A:middle
with no extra adornment.

00:26:53.556 --> 00:26:56.276 A:middle

we're all, you know,

00:27:16.226 --> 00:27:18.296 A:middle
at the conference this
week, and we're crazy busy.

00:27:18.296 --> 00:27:21.136 A:middle
You've got 100 and what is
it, 10 sessions to attend,

00:27:21.136 --> 00:27:24.696 A:middle
and so this is just a great
example of how busy we are.

00:27:24.696 --> 00:27:27.846 A:middle
If we're not at a conference,
you guys are writing code,

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:30.606 A:middle
you're going to school,
you're doing life.

00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:34.806 A:middle

you know that it's hard to keep

00:27:34.806 --> 00:27:37.146 A:middle
on top of all of the
things that are going

00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:38.276 A:middle
on in the world around us.

Whether it's in our industry,
whether it's not in our industry

us, whether it's sports

or world news or what have you.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:51.016 A:middle
And so, you know, it's not
for a lack of news sources,

00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:53.256 A:middle
it's just that there's so
much news coming at us.

00:27:54.616 --> 00:27:59.136 A:middle
And it's often hard to pick
a quality source of news.

in, in the length that
you want it to be in.

it's even hard

00:28:11.696 --> 00:28:13.536 A:middle

This app gets you in

It delivers definitive
summaries of all the important

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:17.766 A:middle
and need-to-know news of the
day in two beautiful digests.

00:29:18.806 --> 00:29:21.226 A:middle

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.676 A:middle
as algorithmically generated
to ensure high quality

00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:26.076 A:middle
and keep you informed of all
the key headlines of the day.

00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:31.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's take a quick
look at "Yahoo!

00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:32.036 A:middle
News Digest."

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:36.606 A:middle
So what you get is these
two digests of news

00:29:36.606 --> 00:29:39.816 A:middle
with about eight stories in
them in the morning at 8 a.m.

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:43.926 A:middle
and at 6 p.m. in the
evening, and that's it.

00:29:44.286 --> 00:29:47.186 A:middle
And so this is one of my
go-to news apps all the time.

00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:50.276 A:middle
I wait for these digests to
arrive, and once they arrive,

00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:54.976 A:middle
you can just scroll through
this really simple UI,

00:29:55.756 --> 00:29:58.166 A:middle
that lists the stories, the
top stories, of the day.

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:01.886 A:middle
And what they've done really
well is they've, you know,

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:01.886 A:middle
And what they've done really
well is they've, you know,

00:30:01.886 --> 00:30:05.386 A:middle
done this automatic collection
of information and aggregation

00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:07.856 A:middle
and all the work that they do
behind the scenes [inaudible],

00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:10.606 A:middle
but then they're doing human
curation of the content

00:30:10.926 --> 00:30:12.256 A:middle
in addition with their editors.

00:30:12.256 --> 00:30:15.036 A:middle
And so the content that you get,

00:30:15.066 --> 00:30:19.106 A:middle
the news stories are
extremely high quality.

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:22.006 A:middle
So here we are, we're
moving through this list,

00:30:22.006 --> 00:30:23.816 A:middle
and you see a political story,

00:30:23.816 --> 00:30:26.806 A:middle
there's a U.S. news
story, technology, world.

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
Below each of these story
headlines you've got these

00:30:31.126 --> 00:30:34.596 A:middle
little atoms, these little
circles, and you can tap them

00:30:34.596 --> 00:30:36.596 A:middle
to get the legend of
what each of these mean,

00:30:36.816 --> 00:30:38.976 A:middle
but basically they're telling
you how much information there

00:30:38.976 --> 00:30:40.366 A:middle
is available for
one of the stories.

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.636 A:middle
So let's go into the story
about Apple - hey, why not?

00:30:43.636 --> 00:30:46.716 A:middle
And you know, the first
time you use it, it says,

00:30:46.716 --> 00:30:49.746 A:middle
how to use the app, and so you
can swipe just right to left

00:30:50.286 --> 00:30:53.496 A:middle
around the stories, or
go back into a story

00:30:53.496 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
and read it in more detail.

00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:58.666 A:middle
And I find that these are,
you know, if I just take

00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:01.206 A:middle
about 10 minutes to plow
through this digest,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:01.206 A:middle
about 10 minutes to plow
through this digest,

00:31:01.206 --> 00:31:04.696 A:middle
I've got some great information
about the latest headlines.

00:31:05.076 --> 00:31:07.566 A:middle
And so you get these great
call-outs, you're moving

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:09.316 A:middle
through the stories,
that's pretty much it.

00:31:09.316 --> 00:31:10.216 A:middle
It's well laid out.

00:31:10.216 --> 00:31:13.586 A:middle
At the bottom you're getting
extra information like photos

00:31:13.586 --> 00:31:15.536 A:middle
that might be associated with
this story, that are coming

00:31:15.536 --> 00:31:16.756 A:middle
from really good sources.

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.926 A:middle
There might be a
topic breakdown.

00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:21.376 A:middle
There might be a video that
loads very, very quickly

00:31:21.376 --> 00:31:23.866 A:middle
that it's a quick
summary of the story.

00:31:24.026 --> 00:31:27.116 A:middle
There's maps integration,
if it's appropriate.

00:31:27.116 --> 00:31:30.186 A:middle
And then you can go
through some top tweets

00:31:30.786 --> 00:31:34.246 A:middle
or other social networking
posts that apply to this story.

00:31:35.166 --> 00:31:38.366 A:middle
And so that's how each of
the stories is laid out,

00:31:38.606 --> 00:31:41.606 A:middle
and so you just flip through
them one by one, and read them,

00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:43.706 A:middle
some really great
visual effects and kind

00:31:43.706 --> 00:31:45.426 A:middle
of a playful UI in the app.

00:31:46.256 --> 00:31:48.906 A:middle
Another example of playful
UI is the share button.

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:50.836 A:middle
These guys kind of pop up from
the bottom and then they kind

00:31:50.836 --> 00:31:52.246 A:middle
of bounce and go away.

00:31:52.686 --> 00:31:56.396 A:middle
So really great experience,
and then when you're done,

00:31:56.776 --> 00:31:59.296 A:middle

00:32:00.566 --> 00:32:04.406 A:middle
I love what they've done at
the very end because you read

00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:05.956 A:middle
through this and the
news is really great,

00:32:05.956 --> 00:32:07.706 A:middle
but they've done a
great job of kind

00:32:07.706 --> 00:32:11.096 A:middle
of just gamifying this a little
bit by giving you feedback

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:13.596 A:middle
on how many of the stories they
just sent you that you read.

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:15.736 A:middle
And so while we just
swiped through them now,

00:32:15.736 --> 00:32:18.236 A:middle
it doesn't mean we read them,
but in theory you've read them,

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.026 A:middle
and at the end you
just get told, hey,

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:21.016 A:middle
you've read seven of nine.

00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:25.446 A:middle
And I just find that kind
of a cool bit of feedback.

that we're looking

end of day digest.

But we can tap the
top right-hand corner,

00:32:34.316 --> 00:32:37.146 A:middle
see the next digest
is coming in 11 hours.

00:32:37.146 --> 00:32:38.766 A:middle
If I tap the center of
the screen, it says,

00:32:38.766 --> 00:32:40.406 A:middle
"Patience is a virtue."

00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:42.736 A:middle
I loved that the
first time I saw that.

00:32:42.736 --> 00:32:44.886 A:middle
And I can go back
across the last week

00:32:45.206 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
and pick one maybe a
digest that I hadn't read,

00:32:48.496 --> 00:32:52.656 A:middle
so I'll pick a morning digest,
and here the news comes in

00:32:52.656 --> 00:32:54.306 A:middle
and it's the white background.

00:32:54.826 --> 00:32:57.906 A:middle

00:35:16.426 --> 00:35:17.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm totally addicted
to this game.

00:35:17.856 --> 00:35:18.776 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:21.996 A:middle
I personally am addicted
to this game.

00:35:22.706 --> 00:35:24.786 A:middle
"Threes!" is a tiny puzzle
that will grow on you.

00:35:24.786 --> 00:35:27.166 A:middle
It's an engaging number-matching
puzzle that you'll learn

00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.816 A:middle
in a minute but play endlessly.

00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:30.936 A:middle
With an endearing
cast of characters

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:32.266 A:middle
and an enchanting soundtrack,

00:35:32.566 --> 00:35:34.696 A:middle
it's been broadly
imitated but never equaled.

00:35:35.246 --> 00:35:35.506 A:middle
John.

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:37.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so true.

00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:41.766 A:middle
So, you know, most of you have
probably played this way more

00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:47.426 A:middle
than I have, by your
response when we awarded them.

00:35:47.936 --> 00:35:52.256 A:middle
But, you know, talk about
personality, you know,

00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:53.846 A:middle
this game has got
attitude, right.

00:35:53.846 --> 00:35:57.146 A:middle
So the longer I talk the more
annoyed they're going to get

00:35:57.146 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
because these tiles are
individual characters.

00:35:57.146 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
because these tiles are
individual characters.

00:36:00.486 --> 00:36:03.596 A:middle
And we can find out
who they are.

00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:04.546 A:middle
This is Trin.

00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:06.716 A:middle
We can tap on Thumbert, right.

00:36:06.946 --> 00:36:11.346 A:middle
Each of these guys
has got character.

00:36:11.766 --> 00:36:13.616 A:middle
I love Treycee.

00:36:13.616 --> 00:36:16.456 A:middle
Hey. And you can see on
the front of these tiles

00:36:16.456 --> 00:36:18.726 A:middle
that they're, you know,
there's two eyes, there's a nose

00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:22.496 A:middle
or a mouth, the tiles
are constantly, you know,

00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:26.736 A:middle
they're blinking, they're
doing things with their face,

00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:28.416 A:middle
they're connecting
up with each other.

00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:30.956 A:middle
So the game is, you know,
you're doing ones and twos

00:36:30.956 --> 00:36:34.076 A:middle
to create threes and then you
can combine threes together.

00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:36.126 A:middle
So let's start to move here.

00:36:36.126 --> 00:36:37.366 A:middle
We've got to start playing here.

00:36:37.836 --> 00:36:42.066 A:middle
So we can combine one and
two with three, threes,

00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:46.316 A:middle
combining the sixes,
right, threes here, right.

00:36:47.256 --> 00:36:56.506 A:middle
And as you play, you get
this really great experience,

00:36:56.666 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
you know, these tiles talking
to you, and I love this.

you know, these tiles talking
to you, and I love this.

00:37:00.436 --> 00:37:03.986 A:middle
And this is I think what
puts this game over the top

00:37:03.986 --> 00:37:05.996 A:middle
and helps it stand
out from the crowd.

00:37:05.996 --> 00:37:08.566 A:middle
I mean, it's not just
a tile sorting game -

00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:14.276 A:middle
the personality is this extra
layer, you know, brilliant layer

00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:15.846 A:middle
on top of the technology.

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:18.766 A:middle
So this is why we picked
this game as a winner.

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:22.176 A:middle
It's just great game play, very
engaging, great technology use

00:37:22.176 --> 00:37:23.726 A:middle
and excellent personality.

00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:26.406 A:middle

a creative professional,

00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:47.436 A:middle
the Mac has, you
know, the chances are,

00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:49.176 A:middle
the Mac has been
your tool of choice.

00:37:49.836 --> 00:37:52.926 A:middle

whether professional
or consumer, you know,

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:58.856 A:middle
in the creative space, it's
pretty much always been the case

00:37:58.896 --> 00:38:04.006 A:middle
that the best apps are first
on the Mac or they're Mac only.

And our winner our next winner
stays in this tradition and we'd

00:38:10.796 --> 00:38:13.036 A:middle
like to award an
ADA tonight to --

00:38:13.606 --> 00:38:15.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; "Cinemagraph Pro"
by Flixel Photos.

[ Music and Applause ]

00:38:39.566 --> 00:38:40.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:43.826 A:middle
"Cinemagraph Pro" is
a professional tool

00:38:43.826 --> 00:38:45.756 A:middle
that allows you to
create living photos.

00:38:46.166 --> 00:38:49.036 A:middle
With its unique live masking
technology, it allows artists

00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:51.016 A:middle
to preview their
images in real time

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:53.776 A:middle
and it creates ultrahigh
definition output

00:38:53.776 --> 00:38:54.746 A:middle
of your hybrid photos.

00:38:54.746 --> 00:39:02.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, so first
thing is, you know,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:54.746 --> 00:39:02.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, so first
thing is, you know,

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:05.856 A:middle
we all know how compelling video
is, and we see video on the Web

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:08.776 A:middle
for advertisements or for,
you know, merchandising

00:39:08.776 --> 00:39:10.366 A:middle
or in catalogs or whatever,

00:39:10.736 --> 00:39:13.646 A:middle
for things that we might be
interested in that we want

00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:15.856 A:middle
to know about, and
video is really great.

00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:19.306 A:middle
But the problem with video is
it's hard to make and it's,

00:39:19.306 --> 00:39:21.246 A:middle
you know, got a big footprint,

00:39:21.246 --> 00:39:24.236 A:middle
it's got to be brought
down, it takes bandwidth.

00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:27.806 A:middle
And so, you know, there's
a better way to do this,

00:39:27.806 --> 00:39:28.936 A:middle
as far as these guys
are concerned,

00:39:28.936 --> 00:39:30.646 A:middle
they built this tool
that's optimized

00:39:30.696 --> 00:39:34.546 A:middle
to create something they're
calling Flixels or Cinemagraphs,

00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:37.536 A:middle
which are basically living
images that are a combination

00:39:37.536 --> 00:39:39.216 A:middle
of a photo and a video.

00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:42.776 A:middle
And they benefit from being
a whole lot more lightweight

00:39:43.256 --> 00:39:46.926 A:middle
than video and a lot more
interesting and compelling

00:39:47.126 --> 00:39:49.586 A:middle
than photos, just still photos.

00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:53.796 A:middle
So what I want to do
here is show you first

00:39:53.796 --> 00:39:56.456 A:middle
of all just an animated gif --

00:39:56.556 --> 00:40:00.176 A:middle
gif, sorry, animated gif that
I'm going to create in a moment,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:56.556 --> 00:40:00.176 A:middle
gif, sorry, animated gif that
I'm going to create in a moment,

00:40:00.676 --> 00:40:03.646 A:middle
and now this is sort of an
old file format on the Web,

00:40:03.646 --> 00:40:04.706 A:middle
but it's still prevalent.

00:40:04.706 --> 00:40:07.616 A:middle
And to create one of
these is difficult

00:40:07.616 --> 00:40:09.706 A:middle
to do what we're going
to do in a minute.

00:40:09.706 --> 00:40:11.226 A:middle
And so here's an animated gif.

00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:12.706 A:middle
And we're going to
end up with that,

00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:16.476 A:middle
and that started
with this raw video.

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:22.166 A:middle
So this is just video taken
in a subway in New York.

00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:24.356 A:middle
And we're going to start
with that and quickly

00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:27.706 A:middle
in like three steps
create the animated gif

00:40:27.706 --> 00:40:28.586 A:middle
and create a Flixel.

00:40:28.586 --> 00:40:32.606 A:middle
So let me switch over
to "Cinemagraph Pro."

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:38.356 A:middle
Now, what you do is you open up
the raw video that you've got,

00:40:38.356 --> 00:40:40.936 A:middle
and in this case we've got
somebody walking by on the left,

00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:43.486 A:middle
we've got the train
coming in here.

00:40:43.486 --> 00:40:45.396 A:middle
If you just look to the
left of the escalator,

00:40:45.396 --> 00:40:48.096 A:middle
you'll see as this loops,
the train's pulling in,

00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:50.526 A:middle
and there's the light,
and it stops, right.

00:40:50.526 --> 00:40:51.516 A:middle
So it's a very short clip.

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:53.866 A:middle
But we don't want any of
those noise on the side,

00:40:53.866 --> 00:40:55.656 A:middle
we don't want any of the
reflection from the lights

00:40:55.656 --> 00:40:58.106 A:middle
and different things that are
in the station on the walls.

00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:01.166 A:middle
And so we start in the top
left corner we choose trim,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:01.166 A:middle
And so we start in the top
left corner we choose trim,

00:41:02.006 --> 00:41:04.616 A:middle
we pull in the trim, and
we figure out exactly,

00:41:04.616 --> 00:41:07.736 A:middle
you notice the lady on the left,
we decide where we want her

00:41:07.736 --> 00:41:10.416 A:middle
to freeze in the image
that we're going to create

00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:12.406 A:middle
or in the Cinemagraph that
we're going to create,

00:41:12.406 --> 00:41:14.526 A:middle
and we stop it there with
the left side of the trim.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.916 A:middle
The right side of the trim,
I'm just going to pull in here

00:41:17.916 --> 00:41:20.026 A:middle
and adjust just slightly
so I get the light

00:41:20.116 --> 00:41:21.496 A:middle
from the train coming
in to the left

00:41:21.496 --> 00:41:23.146 A:middle
of the escalator
there, you see that?

00:41:23.476 --> 00:41:24.436 A:middle
It's in there.

00:41:24.436 --> 00:41:26.626 A:middle
So that's just pulling
it in for the right side.

00:41:26.626 --> 00:41:28.926 A:middle
And then next is where
the magic happens.

00:41:28.926 --> 00:41:29.906 A:middle
I'm going to go to
the mask tool,

00:41:29.906 --> 00:41:32.806 A:middle
it's a little bit too big here,
so I'm going to adjust its size.

00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:38.556 A:middle
Go down and I'm going to
mask the portion of the image

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:40.526 A:middle
that of the video
that I want to keep,

00:41:40.526 --> 00:41:44.336 A:middle
everything else now becomes
basically masked out.

00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:48.336 A:middle
And then I'm going to go to loop
and decide what kind of a loop,

00:41:48.336 --> 00:41:50.516 A:middle
I've got several types
of loops that I can do.

00:41:50.646 --> 00:41:51.856 A:middle
I'll just stick with repeat.

00:41:52.356 --> 00:41:55.416 A:middle
I'm going to, you know, leave
the speed the way it is.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.716 A:middle
Leave the lay the way it is.

00:41:57.716 --> 00:41:58.926 A:middle
And just increase crossfade.

00:41:58.926 --> 00:42:01.136 A:middle
Crossfade is what happens
when the video ends


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.926 --> 00:42:01.136 A:middle
Crossfade is what happens
when the video ends

00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:03.216 A:middle
and then it loops
back to the beginning.

00:42:03.716 --> 00:42:05.176 A:middle
So we'll just make
that smooth so it looks

00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:07.056 A:middle
like a continuous
movement of the escalator.

00:42:07.446 --> 00:42:11.256 A:middle
And lastly, we'll go to look
quickly at adjustments -

00:42:11.256 --> 00:42:14.806 A:middle
I can adjust all kinds of
the attributes on this video.

00:42:14.806 --> 00:42:17.416 A:middle
But I'll just go to the
canned effects that are here,

00:42:17.696 --> 00:42:20.416 A:middle
and you can see that you can
apply these super quickly

00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:23.066 A:middle
to this image.

00:42:23.896 --> 00:42:27.016 A:middle
And so let's grab black
and white cold sun,

00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:30.726 A:middle
and then we'll do a
render, and we can save it

00:42:30.726 --> 00:42:35.586 A:middle
out as [inaudible] or pro
res 422, so we'll do that,

00:42:36.586 --> 00:42:37.886 A:middle
save it to the desktop.

00:42:38.136 --> 00:42:39.786 A:middle
Let's call it demo.

00:42:40.186 --> 00:42:45.376 A:middle
And what it's creating now is
it's creating this Flixel file,

00:42:45.376 --> 00:42:49.716 A:middle
this cinemagraph that the folks
at "Cinemagraph Pro" sorry

00:42:49.716 --> 00:42:52.526 A:middle
at Flixel can host on
their servers for you,

00:42:52.806 --> 00:42:55.306 A:middle
and it's super lightweight,
comes down,

00:42:55.306 --> 00:43:00.286 A:middle
works with every browser, and
gives you that exact experience.

works with every browser, and
gives you that exact experience.

00:43:00.596 --> 00:43:04.376 A:middle
And so the end result is
basically this, you know,

00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:07.516 A:middle
you can see that the woman
on the left is frozen,

00:43:07.516 --> 00:43:09.106 A:middle
everything about
the scene is frozen,

00:43:09.206 --> 00:43:10.946 A:middle
except the one piece
that we want.

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:12.976 A:middle
We did this in three
simple steps.

00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:19.546 A:middle
This app is brand new on the Mac
App Store, it's super gorgeous,

00:43:19.546 --> 00:43:21.026 A:middle
it's really streamlined.

00:43:21.026 --> 00:43:24.726 A:middle
It does one thing extremely
well, saving you 30 steps

00:43:24.726 --> 00:43:28.666 A:middle
in other tools, and they
have a really great model

00:43:28.666 --> 00:43:30.946 A:middle

that if an app has it,

And quickly here we're
going to get to a video,

you don't have to tap

00:52:47.396 --> 00:52:49.516 A:middle
to start playing the
video, it just does

00:52:50.086 --> 00:52:54.096 A:middle
as it pulls the majority
of it onscreen, right.

and families are creating them,
individuals are creating them.

00:53:11.766 --> 00:53:16.336 A:middle
So one of the things about this
app is it lets you create one

00:53:16.336 --> 00:53:20.876 A:middle
of these books or these
stories sorry super easily.

00:53:20.876 --> 00:53:22.746 A:middle
So you just tap the
create button.

00:53:22.746 --> 00:53:24.716 A:middle
We're going to add
from the photo library.

00:53:24.756 --> 00:53:30.626 A:middle
Let's say we went to the lake,
we import these 14 images,

00:53:31.036 --> 00:53:34.676 A:middle
and immediately they're
laid out in the format

00:53:34.676 --> 00:53:36.466 A:middle
that the app provides.

00:53:36.466 --> 00:53:45.286 A:middle
So let's say, you know, trip
to the lake, great memories,

00:53:45.796 --> 00:53:49.946 A:middle
and we say done on that.

down in the basic view,

00:53:54.196 --> 00:53:56.466 A:middle
which is thumbnail view, but
it's like I want to do more

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.956 A:middle
than this, I want to
make something compelling

I saw a moment ago.

of the cyclist is pretty cool.

00:54:05.016 --> 00:54:07.786 A:middle
So we just tap and
drag, make that larger.

00:54:07.956 --> 00:54:10.876 A:middle
This one of her on the
tree stump is pretty cool,

00:54:10.876 --> 00:54:12.296 A:middle
so we can just tap
and drag that.

00:54:12.296 --> 00:54:16.806 A:middle
We can double tap and you know,
and crop it in the way we want.

00:54:17.376 --> 00:54:19.646 A:middle
Go around, make something
really big, like this,

00:54:19.646 --> 00:54:21.476 A:middle
everything else moves
out of the way.

00:54:21.696 --> 00:54:23.516 A:middle
Great feedback through
animation.

00:54:23.936 --> 00:54:26.536 A:middle
And you just go on and on,
and you can add the texts,

00:54:26.536 --> 00:54:27.876 A:middle
you can create the
breaks you want,

00:54:27.876 --> 00:54:31.446 A:middle
and then you can publish this
out to the Storehouse community.

00:54:31.636 --> 00:54:34.626 A:middle
And if people are following you,
they're going to see your story.

00:54:34.626 --> 00:54:36.986 A:middle
In this case I'm just going
to save it as a draft.

00:54:37.506 --> 00:54:40.766 A:middle
But this is just such a
compelling app, just to browse

00:54:40.766 --> 00:54:44.166 A:middle
through these stories and
see what people are posting.

00:54:44.166 --> 00:54:47.656 A:middle
And they are far more
significant and more meaningful

00:54:47.656 --> 00:54:50.896 A:middle
and more emotionally charged
than just something small

00:54:50.896 --> 00:54:51.796 A:middle
that we put out to the world

00:54:51.796 --> 00:54:53.476 A:middle
which is equally valuable
but very different.

00:54:53.676 --> 00:54:56.166 A:middle

of iOS technologies.

is just stunning.

One of the first things
you'll notice in the app, too,

just this ambient music that's

01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:39.596 A:middle
such a big challenge.

01:01:39.706 --> 01:01:44.326 A:middle
But when you can pull
them off, it's amazing,

01:01:44.846 --> 01:01:48.436 A:middle
and it's definitely
something that's worth noting,

01:01:48.436 --> 01:01:50.276 A:middle
it's a definitely
notable moment.

01:01:50.806 --> 01:01:54.566 A:middle
And so our next winner
is just an incredible app

01:01:55.026 --> 01:02:00.746 A:middle
that was definitely a big
idea I think for them.

01:01:55.026 --> 01:02:00.746 A:middle
that was definitely a big
idea I think for them.

01:02:00.746 --> 01:02:04.016 A:middle
And they set out to do
something fantastic,

01:02:04.586 --> 01:02:06.316 A:middle
and I think they achieved that.

01:02:07.066 --> 01:02:09.406 A:middle

this afternoon goes

01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:12.406 A:middle

[ Music and Applause ]

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:57.116 A:middle
"Monument Valley" is
a surreal exploration

01:02:57.186 --> 01:02:58.796 A:middle
through fantastical
architectures

01:02:58.796 --> 01:03:00.136 A:middle

Guide the silent Princess Ida
through mysterious monuments,

01:03:03.936 --> 01:03:06.866 A:middle
uncovering hidden paths and
unfolding optical illusions

01:03:07.156 --> 01:03:09.346 A:middle
to outsmart the enigmatic
crow people.

01:03:13.996 --> 01:03:16.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This is such an awesome game.

01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:19.356 A:middle
And I don't know where
the idea came from,

01:03:19.676 --> 01:03:23.146 A:middle
we'll have to hear the
story someday, but it is -

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:26.026 A:middle
they just set out to
do something so big

01:03:26.026 --> 01:03:27.636 A:middle
and the result is amazing.

01:03:27.706 --> 01:03:30.536 A:middle
So what you're doing is you're
taking this little Princess Ida

01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:33.066 A:middle
and you've got to get her to
the top of these, you know,

01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:34.316 A:middle
to the top of the scenes.

01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:35.936 A:middle
In this case the top
of the tower there.

01:03:35.936 --> 01:03:40.016 A:middle
But we're looking at this
very Escheresque 3-D model,

01:03:40.246 --> 01:03:41.726 A:middle
and a lot of things
don't line up.

01:03:42.066 --> 01:03:44.876 A:middle
Anyway, so we'll
figure it out as we go.

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:48.576 A:middle
No. 1, you know, you can
interact with objects onscreen.

01:03:48.576 --> 01:03:50.566 A:middle
So this one's pretty
straightforward - let's just tap

01:03:50.566 --> 01:03:51.756 A:middle
and tell her where to go.

01:03:52.466 --> 01:03:55.156 A:middle
She's going to go up here,
we're going to put her up here.

01:03:55.156 --> 01:03:56.676 A:middle
But now, now what do we do?

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:01.716 A:middle
But you get these hints onscreen
that so you can turn this

But you get these hints onscreen
that so you can turn this

01:04:02.246 --> 01:04:06.156 A:middle
and so we'll walk around here,
we're going to walk her around,

01:04:06.256 --> 01:04:09.266 A:middle
flip this around, and now
she's got to go and step

01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:11.276 A:middle
on this special platform,
which is now going

01:04:11.276 --> 01:04:13.236 A:middle
to deconstruct things.

01:04:13.746 --> 01:04:16.346 A:middle
But you know, when you
look at this, okay,

01:04:16.346 --> 01:04:17.326 A:middle
now where's she going to go?

01:04:17.326 --> 01:04:19.966 A:middle
She can't climb that
center pole.

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:22.646 A:middle
She can't you know,
what are we going to do?

01:04:22.646 --> 01:04:28.586 A:middle
But what's just so cool about
this app is that once you start

01:04:28.586 --> 01:04:30.126 A:middle
to interact with these objects,

01:04:30.796 --> 01:04:34.486 A:middle
you realize like look what's
going on here, you didn't think

01:04:34.486 --> 01:04:36.946 A:middle
that that top bar
was the same height

01:04:36.946 --> 01:04:38.226 A:middle
as the other walkway, right.

01:04:38.766 --> 01:04:40.286 A:middle
But as you start to
rotate it around,

01:04:40.286 --> 01:04:46.356 A:middle
they've just done this great job
of showing what you're doing.

01:04:51.046 --> 01:04:52.686 A:middle
You know, it's like that
you know, those stairs

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:55.316 A:middle
that just never end, right,
it's exactly that experience.

01:04:55.786 --> 01:04:58.486 A:middle
So here you turn around,
now she's going to get

01:04:58.486 --> 01:05:00.926 A:middle
to the final destination, right.

to the final destination, right.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:04.376 A:middle
And so she gets there, we
get this path that appears,

01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:07.086 A:middle
and now we get onto
this next level.

01:05:07.086 --> 01:05:10.076 A:middle
So she's going to
walk around here.

01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:13.166 A:middle
And this just goes
on and on and on.

01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:17.286 A:middle
And it's just so awesome,
because in this level here,

01:05:17.286 --> 01:05:20.366 A:middle
she suddenly learns to
walk sideways and walk

01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:21.276 A:middle
on different surfaces.

01:05:21.276 --> 01:05:24.096 A:middle
So here she's going up here.

01:05:24.156 --> 01:05:25.926 A:middle
We're going to walk
her around here.

01:05:27.236 --> 01:05:29.246 A:middle
And just listen to this
soundtrack that's going

01:05:29.246 --> 01:05:30.086 A:middle
on behind the scenes.

01:05:30.086 --> 01:05:33.266 A:middle
Now you're like what is
happening here, right?

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:36.636 A:middle
But if we turn let's see -
can I remember how to do this?

01:05:37.386 --> 01:05:39.876 A:middle
Well, let's just end the
demo there because - oh,

01:05:39.876 --> 01:05:41.316 A:middle
I know what to do, I know
what to do, that's right.

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:44.446 A:middle
I want to get to the backside of
this thing, no I can't do that.

01:05:44.446 --> 01:05:47.426 A:middle
I can't remember, it's okay,
you've got to play the game.

01:05:47.946 --> 01:05:49.776 A:middle
