00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. Welcome to
Swift Playgrounds.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:16.315 A:middle
I'm Rick Ballard and with
me today is my colleague

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:17.086 A:middle
Connor Wakamo.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:18.956 A:middle
We're both Engineers
in the Xcode Team

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.136 A:middle
and we've been working hard
to bring Playgrounds to life.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:24.496 A:middle
We introduced Playgrounds
to the world Monday morning

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.606 A:middle
and you saw a little bit more

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.766 A:middle
about them Monday
afternoon and yesterday.

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.216 A:middle
Well, today we're going to
go into a lot more depth.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.626 A:middle
We're going to start out today
with some conceptual background,

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:36.916 A:middle
what Playgrounds actually are
and what you can use them for.

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:39.236 A:middle
And then we'll show you examples
of how to use Playgrounds

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:42.196 A:middle
for learning, exploration,
and visualization

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:43.296 A:middle
of the results of your code.

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:46.836 A:middle
We'll show you how you can
use your own custom resources

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:49.526 A:middle
with your Playgrounds,
and how to use Playgrounds

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.346 A:middle
for algorithm development
and development

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:52.946 A:middle
of other separable
pieces of code.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.046 A:middle
We'll introduce the
XCPlayground framework

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.516 A:middle
which includes some
really powerful utilities

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.276 A:middle
that you can use to
enhance your Playgrounds.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.276 A:middle
that you can use to
enhance your Playgrounds.

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:03.376 A:middle
And we'll show you how you can
develop your own Custom Quick

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.906 A:middle
Looks, so that you can visualize
your own classes the same way

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:09.466 A:middle
you visualize the classes
that come with the frameworks.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.996 A:middle
Next, we'll show
you a great demo

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:15.046 A:middle
of how awesome Playgrounds are
for developing custom views

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:17.136 A:middle
and in any other kind
of custom drawing

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
and we'll show you how you can
use your own asynchronous code

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.116 A:middle
with Playgrounds.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.026 A:middle
Finally, we'll finish up
today with a little bit

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:26.136 A:middle
about the limitations that
Playgrounds have today.

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:29.936 A:middle
So what exactly are Playgrounds?

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:33.716 A:middle
Playgrounds are a new type of
document introduced in Xcode 6

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:36.516 A:middle
and they're actually a file
wrapper containing a few

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:37.306 A:middle
useful things.

00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:39.546 A:middle
First of all is your Swift code.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:42.516 A:middle
The code that would be
run and the result are,

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.436 A:middle
and generate results to display
automatically every time you

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:46.526 A:middle
edit your Playground file.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.016 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds also
can contain a folder

00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:52.946 A:middle
of embedded resources which
are made available to your code

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:55.526 A:middle
or your Playground can
reference resources elsewhere

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:57.046 A:middle
on your system you
want to make available.

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
Finally, your Playground
can contain a timeline full


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
Finally, your Playground
can contain a timeline full

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:03.716 A:middle
of timeline items that
provide useful visualization

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:06.266 A:middle
of your results beyond what
you see in the sidebar.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.756 A:middle
When you first open
a Playground,

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.616 A:middle
we show the Playground Editor
with your Swift code on the left

00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:15.836 A:middle
and the results sidebar on
the right showing the result

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.526 A:middle
of every expression
in your code.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:21.986 A:middle
Every time you edit your source,
we rerun your Playground source

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:25.266 A:middle
from the top to the bottom
and present the new results

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:27.106 A:middle
from that run in the sidebar.

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:29.606 A:middle
This is the basic editor mode.

00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:33.516 A:middle
But if you go into the assistant
editor mode we'll show the

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.866 A:middle
Timeline Assistant by
default which allows you

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.906 A:middle
to visualize your
results in more detail.

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
For example, you can
display the value history

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.156 A:middle
from a line in your code.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:44.516 A:middle
In this case, since
it's a numeric value,

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.266 A:middle
we'll draw a graph of
that value over time

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:49.806 A:middle
since it was iterated
multiple times in a loop.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.316 A:middle
If you're looking for console
output like that from Print Man,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.356 A:middle
you'll also find that in
the Timeline Assistant.

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.296 A:middle
There are a couple
other useful things you,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:02:59.296 A:middle
I want to call out here.

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
In the lower right hand
corner, there's a time-stepper.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
In the lower right hand
corner, there's a time-stepper.

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
And this controls how long your
Playground will continue to run

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.426 A:middle
after the top of a
source is finished

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:10.676 A:middle
if you're using live views
or indefinite execution.

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:13.346 A:middle
And I'll explain what both of
those are a little later on.

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:18.266 A:middle
There's also a slider which
allows you to go back in time

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.916 A:middle
and view results in the
timeline from a specific point

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:22.286 A:middle
in your Playground execution.

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:25.426 A:middle
So here, you can see we're
viewing a numeric result

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:27.296 A:middle
from partway through the
Playground execution.

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:30.056 A:middle
But you'll find this is
very useful with live views

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:32.356 A:middle
as it allows you to scrub
back through the recording

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:35.086 A:middle
of that view and see exactly
what your animation was doing

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:36.356 A:middle
at a specific point in time.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.766 A:middle
So that's what Playgrounds are.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.106 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about
what you can use them for.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.066 A:middle
We think your first great use

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.656 A:middle
of Playgrounds is
going to be learning.

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:48.406 A:middle
We've introduced a brand new
language for you to learn

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.966 A:middle
and we think the best way to
get started is just to open

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
up a Playground and
dive in and play around.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:58.496 A:middle
Our documentation also includes
a special interactive Playground

00:03:58.496 --> 00:03:59.696 A:middle
called the Swift Tour.

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:02.436 A:middle
This allows you to
see documentation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:02.436 A:middle
This allows you to
see documentation

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:05.856 A:middle
and Playground Editor side
by side in the same editor.

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:08.396 A:middle
So you can read about how
to do something and try it

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:10.306 A:middle
out right there without
leaving the editor.

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:14.696 A:middle
Finally, we think Playgrounds
are a fantastic way for people

00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:16.426 A:middle
to learn how to program
in the first place.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.826 A:middle
Beginners don't have to learn
how to configure a project

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.906 A:middle
and target and build
and run and debug.

00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:24.456 A:middle
They can just type code
into a Playground Editor

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.006 A:middle
and immediately see the results.

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:28.766 A:middle
So if you know anyone who
wants to learn how to program,

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:31.256 A:middle
we encourage you to suggest
trying it in a Playground.

00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:33.146 A:middle
We think Playgrounds
are also going to be

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:35.066 A:middle
in indispensable
tool in your toolbox

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:36.836 A:middle
for everyday code development.

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:39.026 A:middle
If you're developing
an algorithm

00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:40.686 A:middle
or any other separable
chunk of code,

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:42.976 A:middle
you should consider
starting it on a Playground,

00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:45.226 A:middle
working on it there until
you have it how you want it,

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:47.916 A:middle
and then dragging that
code into your project

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:49.496 A:middle
for use in your application.

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:53.266 A:middle
Any sort of drawing code
you want to do is also great

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.796 A:middle
in a Playground because you
can immediately see the visual

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.606 A:middle
result of what your
code is doing.

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.346 A:middle
And every time you
change your code,

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
you can immediately see how
that affects the visual result.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
you can immediately see how
that affects the visual result.

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
Finally, processing code like
value transformers or a sequence

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:08.826 A:middle
of image filters are
great in Playgrounds

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:11.496 A:middle
because you can visualize
the result at every step

00:05:11.496 --> 00:05:12.916 A:middle
of the transformation process.

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:15.086 A:middle
And when you change
something, you can see how

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.466 A:middle
that change ripples
through all your results.

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:19.236 A:middle
We think you'll find

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:22.206 A:middle
that Playgrounds are fertile
ground for experimentation.

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:24.556 A:middle
And in particular,
any time you're trying

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.966 A:middle
to learn some new
API, you should try it

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.496 A:middle
out on a Playground because you
can immediately see how it works

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.706 A:middle
and what results it gives you.

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:34.146 A:middle
You don't need a project, you
don't need to build and run.

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
You just open up even a
standalone Playground document,

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.796 A:middle
type in your code,
and see what happens.

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:42.666 A:middle
I'm sure all of you
have many a time gone

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:45.646 A:middle
to create a new project from
the application template,

00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:48.216 A:middle
and gone to find
applicationDidFinishLaunching,

00:05:48.216 --> 00:05:50.346 A:middle
just to put a line of
code and to try some API.

00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
Oh, and then you probably
have to NSLog it too

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.116 A:middle
so you can see what happened.

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:55.786 A:middle
You don't have to
do that anymore.

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:58.236 A:middle
Now you can just open
up a Playground and try

00:05:58.236 --> 00:05:59.616 A:middle
out the API you want to try.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.126 A:middle
In fact, we'd recommend you
consider keeping a Playground

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:05.076 A:middle
in your doc at all
times for quick access.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:06.056 A:middle
So anytime you want

00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:08.066 A:middle
to try something it's right
there at your fingertips.

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:12.196 A:middle
So with all that said, let's
dive in and take a look

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.306 A:middle
in an actual Playground.

00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:16.186 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to invite
my colleague Connor up on stage.

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:17.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Rick.

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:19.076 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:06:19.216 --> 00:06:20.016 A:middle
My name is Connor.

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:21.926 A:middle
I'm an Engineer on
the Xcode Team.

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:24.156 A:middle
And today I'll be talking to
you about how you can work

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:26.436 A:middle
with Playgrounds as well
as some of the things

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:28.496 A:middle
which we think Playgrounds
will be really great for.

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:30.906 A:middle
Now, Rick has already
covered many

00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
of the basic concepts
behind Playgrounds.

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:35.176 A:middle
And so I think really the best
way to show you how to work

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:36.616 A:middle
with Playgrounds
is actually just

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:37.976 A:middle
by jumping straight into a demo.

00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:39.426 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and do that.

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:42.356 A:middle
So here I am at the demo
machine and I'm just going

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.096 A:middle
to go ahead and launch Xcode.

00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:48.796 A:middle
Now you'll notice here
that on the Welcome window

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:51.446 A:middle
for Xcode we've added this
brand new "Get started

00:06:51.446 --> 00:06:52.506 A:middle
with a Playground" button.

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:54.866 A:middle
It's that way we want to
make it really easy for you

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:55.976 A:middle
to just get started with one.

00:06:56.236 --> 00:06:57.316 A:middle
So I'll just click on that.

00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:00.106 A:middle
We'll create a Playground
and I'll just give it a name


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:00.106 A:middle
We'll create a Playground
and I'll just give it a name

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
and a place to save it.

00:07:01.036 --> 00:07:02.626 A:middle
So "MyPlayground"
is fine and putting

00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:03.826 A:middle
on the desktop is fine as well.

00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:08.136 A:middle
So let's say create, and then we
have here our Playground itself.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.446 A:middle
So, you notice that
we're importing Cocoa,

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:12.566 A:middle
so we have full access
to the Cocoa APIs.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:15.626 A:middle
And then we are also
creating a string

00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:17.666 A:middle
and we're assigning
the value, "Hello,

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:21.106 A:middle
Playground" to that string.

00:07:21.436 --> 00:07:24.446 A:middle
You'll notice that in the result
sidebar we're seeing the result

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:24.746 A:middle
of that.

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.246 A:middle
So in this case we're seeing
the string, "Hello, Playground".

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:30.106 A:middle
So OK. So that's kind
of the basic idea.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.946 A:middle
Let's try something
with numbers.

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:37.576 A:middle
So let's say, for i in 0 to
10, let's just say, i times i.

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:41.016 A:middle
You see there that
we execute the code

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:43.756 A:middle
and we're getting an
indicator in the result sidebar

00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:45.696 A:middle
that we've executed
that code 10 times.

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:48.526 A:middle
So, OK, let's try
bumping that up to 100.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:50.746 A:middle
We'll let it run
and we'll see there

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.296 A:middle
that we immediately
get an indication

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:54.316 A:middle
that this code has
executed 100 times.

00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.156 A:middle
Now, knowing that is
very useful information

00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.426 A:middle
but sometimes you actually
want to see the value there.

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.066 A:middle
And we have support
for that as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.066 A:middle
And we have support
for that as well.

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
So OK, I'll just hover over
this result, and you'll see

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:06.216 A:middle
that we're highlighting
the line of code

00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:07.966 A:middle
with which it is associated.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.006 A:middle
And we're also showing
this button here.

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:12.106 A:middle
That's called the
Value History button.

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:13.636 A:middle
And if I go ahead
and click on it,

00:08:13.996 --> 00:08:16.726 A:middle
we'll open up the assistant
editor into the timeline mode.

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:19.836 A:middle
This is the place where you can
see results over time as well

00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:21.476 A:middle
as a place for you to
store results which you

00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:22.566 A:middle
like to see persistently.

00:08:22.966 --> 00:08:26.386 A:middle
So in this case, we're showing
the graph for i times i.

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:28.516 A:middle
And we've seen this, you know,
this nice little curve here.

00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:33.525 A:middle
So OK, so that's kind of the
basics of using the timeline

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:35.456 A:middle
and calculating numbers.

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.346 A:middle
Let's try something a
little bit more interesting.

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:40.256 A:middle
Let's go ahead and do
something with AppKit.

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:41.936 A:middle
So let's first start
up by creating a color.

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:46.526 A:middle
So you let color equals
NSColor.blueColor.

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:49.496 A:middle
You'll see there that
we're now showing

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:52.286 A:middle
in the result sidebar a color
swatch indicating what the color

00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:54.986 A:middle
is as well as indicators
of all of the components

00:08:55.086 --> 00:08:55.986 A:middle
which make up that color.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.826 A:middle
So I can, you know,
take this color

00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:00.466 A:middle
and let's create another
attributed string using it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:00.466 A:middle
and let's create another
attributed string using it.

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:05.016 A:middle
So let's say, let attrStr
equals NSAttributedString.

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:09.436 A:middle
And we'll pass it in the string
in an attributes dictionary.

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:11.116 A:middle
So we'll use the
string we already have

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.386 A:middle
and we'll create a dictionary.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:17.656 A:middle
So we'll say
NSForegroundColorAttributeName

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:19.006 A:middle
and we'll pass it
the color we have.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:22.576 A:middle
And then I'll say,
NSFontAttributeName,

00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:24.126 A:middle
I'll just pass it a font.

00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:26.496 A:middle
So I'll say, NSFont,
systemFontOfSize

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:28.636 A:middle
and then let's go to something
fairly big, so I'll just put

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.126 A:middle
in 42, see what that looks like.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:32.636 A:middle
So, OK. So here, you notice

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:34.066 A:middle
that we're getting a
result for this as well.

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:36.676 A:middle
You're seeing that we're showing
the plain text representation

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.616 A:middle
of this, as well as
an icon indicating

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:40.696 A:middle
that it is an attributed string.

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:42.606 A:middle
Now, that's great.

00:09:42.606 --> 00:09:44.216 A:middle
You know, we know that
this code is executed.

00:09:44.746 --> 00:09:46.636 A:middle
But I really want to see what
the actual value is there.

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:48.676 A:middle
See how the attributed
string looks itself

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:50.226 A:middle
and we support that as well.

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:53.006 A:middle
So I can just hover over
the result and in addition

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:54.296 A:middle
to the Value History button,

00:09:54.596 --> 00:09:56.006 A:middle
you'll see that we have
a Quick Look button.

00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:59.376 A:middle
And so if I go ahead and click
on that we'll show a Quick Look

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:02.786 A:middle
of that value to show you
the full representation of it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:02.786 A:middle
of that value to show you
the full representation of it

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:04.616 A:middle
as it was created in
the Playground source.

00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:08.016 A:middle
So, OK, that's colors
and strings.

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:09.306 A:middle
Let's try something with images.

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:10.316 A:middle
Let's actually start

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:11.866 A:middle
up by creating an
array of image names.

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:14.736 A:middle
So I'll say, let
imageNames equals,

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.536 A:middle
we'll put in an array there
and, I know it's something to do

00:10:17.536 --> 00:10:20.426 A:middle
with like NSImageNameUser
or accounts

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:21.436 A:middle
or something in that line.

00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:24.226 A:middle
So I'm just going to create
an array with imageNames

00:10:24.226 --> 00:10:27.516 A:middle
that I think it could
be, the ImageNameUser,

00:10:28.676 --> 00:10:34.346 A:middle
NameUserAccounts,
NSImageNameUserGroup.

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:37.906 A:middle
It's OK. We run the
code and you notice

00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:39.536 A:middle
that we now have an
array of strings.

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:42.386 A:middle
We actually want to
see an array of images

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:43.576 A:middle
and that's very easy to do.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:44.506 A:middle
I can just say something like,

00:10:44.996 --> 00:10:47.686 A:middle
let images equals
imageNames.map.

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:51.796 A:middle
I'll pass it a trailing closure
to just say, NSImage named,

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:54.736 A:middle
pass it the positional
argument $0.

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:57.646 A:middle
And you'll notice there that
we're now seeing that this line

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.186 A:middle
of code executed 4 times.

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:01.336 A:middle
And so, basically
we can see that,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:01.336 A:middle
And so, basically
we can see that,

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:02.766 A:middle
you know, OK, that makes sense.

00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:04.866 A:middle
We're executing this
line of code 3 times

00:11:04.866 --> 00:11:06.136 A:middle
for the trailing closure itself.

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:09.066 A:middle
Then we're executing it once
for the assignment to images.

00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:12.286 A:middle
Actually, I only want to
see the images array itself

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:14.516 A:middle
and we have a nice little trick
for doing that in a Playground.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:16.736 A:middle
You just go ahead and put
the thing that you want

00:11:16.736 --> 00:11:18.146 A:middle
to see on a line by itself.

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:20.886 A:middle
So there you see, you know,
we've put images there,

00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:24.626 A:middle
we rerun the code, and we're
seeing the images array.

00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:27.336 A:middle
I can Quick Look that and
I can see, "Oh, you know,

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:28.646 A:middle
here's the image that
I'm looking for."

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:32.126 A:middle
And so, I'll just get
that image and say,

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:35.666 A:middle
let image equals images at 0.

00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:36.386 A:middle
We'll rerun it.

00:11:36.386 --> 00:11:38.696 A:middle
I'll Quick Look to make sure
it's OK and in fact, yeah,

00:11:38.696 --> 00:11:39.696 A:middle
that's the one that
I'm looking for.

00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:43.066 A:middle
Let's go ahead and put
this into an image view.

00:11:43.386 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
So I'll say, let
imageView equal NSImageView.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.106 A:middle
We'll pass our self a
frame, so let's say NSRect.

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:54.246 A:middle
We'll say 0 for the origin

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:55.566 A:middle
because we don't
really care about that.

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:58.656 A:middle
Then we'll also say 512
by 512 for the size.

00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:01.546 A:middle
Now I'm going to go ahead
and put this ImageView


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:01.546 A:middle
Now I'm going to go ahead
and put this ImageView

00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:02.536 A:middle
on its own line as well.

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.796 A:middle
So I can show this
result in the timeline.

00:12:06.756 --> 00:12:08.886 A:middle
And this is a neat little
way of building something up.

00:12:08.926 --> 00:12:12.036 A:middle
You take the, you start
creating the object

00:12:12.536 --> 00:12:15.276 A:middle
and then you put another line
where we show it as a result.

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:17.156 A:middle
Anyway, I can add some
code in between there

00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:18.926 A:middle
to see how it builds
up over time.

00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:20.676 A:middle
So you see here that
we're starting

00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:22.186 A:middle
out with just this empty
imageView, you know,

00:12:22.186 --> 00:12:23.386 A:middle
we're not seeing any
interesting there.

00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:26.226 A:middle
So let's go ahead add our
image to the imageView.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:29.866 A:middle
So let's say, imageView.image
equals image.

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:33.686 A:middle
And we'll re-execute and
we'll see here now that we're

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:34.886 A:middle
in fact showing the image there

00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:36.566 A:middle
but it's not filling
the full imageView.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:37.616 A:middle
It's not doing what we expect.

00:12:37.616 --> 00:12:40.606 A:middle
That's because we haven't set up
the image scaling appropriately.

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.116 A:middle
So we'll set that as well.

00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:49.866 A:middle
Say imageScaling equals
ImageScaleProportionally

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:54.396 A:middle
UpOrDown. And we'll
re-execute and now you'll see

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:56.916 A:middle
that we're seeing the image
at full size in the imageView.

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:57.966 A:middle
We're seeing what we expect.

00:12:58.756 --> 00:12:59.546 A:middle
And it's OK.

00:12:59.626 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
That's how you can work
with system resources.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.626 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
That's how you can work
with system resources.

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:04.166 A:middle
But I'm sure you have many
resources of your own that you'd

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.356 A:middle
like to use in Playgrounds
as well.

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:06.636 A:middle
And we support that too.

00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:08.836 A:middle
So I'm just going to
go ahead and I'm going

00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:10.586 A:middle
to show the final inspector.

00:13:11.136 --> 00:13:14.896 A:middle
It will slide in on the
right hand of my Playground.

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:16.576 A:middle
And you'll notice
here that we're,

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:18.826 A:middle
we have this new section
called Playground Settings

00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:21.316 A:middle
which is shown whenever you're
viewing a Playground document.

00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:23.006 A:middle
You can select the platform

00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:24.886 A:middle
against which the
Playground should execute.

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:26.756 A:middle
And, you know, OS X is
what we're doing right now.

00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:27.916 A:middle
But we also support iOS.

00:13:28.726 --> 00:13:31.116 A:middle
And you can select a
path for resources.

00:13:31.596 --> 00:13:33.566 A:middle
This defaults to none
but you can select one

00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:35.406 A:middle
if you have resources
that you're interested in.

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:39.196 A:middle
In this case, I'm just going to
say I have a folder of resources

00:13:39.196 --> 00:13:40.736 A:middle
on my desktop so I'm
just going to say,

00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:42.806 A:middle
let's use the Absolute
Path option.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.176 A:middle
I can then go ahead
and choose that.

00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:48.916 A:middle
So let's say here's my resources
folder, I'll choose that.

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:53.466 A:middle
And then once I made that choice
I'm actually going to go ahead

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:55.686 A:middle
and hide the Utilities area.

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:59.976 A:middle
And to access the images
themselves, I just use,

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:02.446 A:middle
you know, NSBundle API, you
know, the resources show


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:02.446 A:middle
you know, NSBundle API, you
know, the resources show

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:03.946 A:middle
up as resources for
the main bundle.

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:08.776 A:middle
So I can say something like "let
myImage equals NSImage, named".

00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:10.866 A:middle
I have an image in
here that's just called

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.406 A:middle
"Xcode" so let's grab that.

00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:16.006 A:middle
We'll re-execute
and you'll notice

00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:18.136 A:middle
that now we're getting
the image result here.

00:14:18.536 --> 00:14:20.806 A:middle
And click, click to confirm
that it's what I think it is.

00:14:20.806 --> 00:14:23.076 A:middle
And in fact, it is, we're
seeing the Xcode icon there.

00:14:23.076 --> 00:14:24.886 A:middle
And now I'm just going to have

00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:26.886 A:middle
that imageView show
the Xcode icon instead.

00:14:27.056 --> 00:14:30.806 A:middle
So, I'll say, "imageView.image
equals myImage".

00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:34.846 A:middle
We'll re-execute and now
you're seeing this new result,

00:14:34.846 --> 00:14:36.166 A:middle
let's add it to the
timeline as well.

00:14:37.036 --> 00:14:39.556 A:middle
So you can see here that
we have what we expected.

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:41.796 A:middle
The Xcode icon is showing
up in our imageView.

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:43.596 A:middle
You'll probably also notice

00:14:43.626 --> 00:14:45.476 A:middle
that we're still seeing
the older version here

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:47.906 A:middle
with the user icon
in the imageView.

00:14:48.356 --> 00:14:51.276 A:middle
And that's because Playgrounds
actually capture results

00:14:51.276 --> 00:14:52.706 A:middle
on every single line
of execution.

00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:54.806 A:middle
So you can do these
kinds of comparisons.

00:14:55.066 --> 00:14:57.006 A:middle
So like for instance, you know,
let's look at the imageView

00:14:57.006 --> 00:14:57.856 A:middle
when we first create it.

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:58.626 A:middle
And it's empty.

00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:01.836 A:middle
Then I added the
user icon to there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:01.836 A:middle
Then I added the
user icon to there.

00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:03.656 A:middle
And so, we see that
earlier version that we saw

00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:05.296 A:middle
where it's small in the center.

00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:08.056 A:middle
Then I set the image
scaling appropriately

00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:09.916 A:middle
and it's now filling
full image view.

00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:12.786 A:middle
Finally, I updated it to
use myImage and we're seeing

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.266 A:middle
that it's showing
the Xcode icon.

00:15:14.556 --> 00:15:16.476 A:middle
And that's great, so that you
don't have, you know, go back

00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:18.196 A:middle
and see what happened
at a particular point.

00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:20.796 A:middle
We're capturing the data for
you as your Playground executes.

00:15:20.856 --> 00:15:24.066 A:middle
So I think that about covers
the basics, so let's go back

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:26.576 A:middle
to slides and talk a little
bit more about Playgrounds.

00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:29.126 A:middle
So one of the key ideas
that you saw there is

00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:31.066 A:middle
that Playgrounds will
automatically execute.

00:15:31.436 --> 00:15:33.536 A:middle
You just type in some code
and you'll see the results

00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:34.586 A:middle
in a sidebar on the right.

00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:38.576 A:middle
Additionally, you saw that
we can add a value history

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:39.346 A:middle
to the timeline.

00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:42.296 A:middle
So here we have a line of
code which executed 100 times.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:43.916 A:middle
And if I hover over that result,

00:15:44.196 --> 00:15:45.436 A:middle
you'll see this Value
History button.

00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:48.046 A:middle
If I click it, we'll switch
into the assistant editor

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.146 A:middle
and we'll show that as
a history of that value.

00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:54.236 A:middle
Additionally, many values in
the Playground have Quick Looks.

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:54.946 A:middle
All right.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:56.786 A:middle
So in this case we have
an attributed string.

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:59.196 A:middle
We don't see the full
representation of the sidebar,

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.416 A:middle
just kind of the
plain text of it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.416 A:middle
just kind of the
plain text of it.

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.356 A:middle
But if I click on the
Quick Look button,

00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:04.666 A:middle
we'll see the attributed
string as it was created

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:05.756 A:middle
in the Playground source.

00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:08.366 A:middle
We support many different types

00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:09.596 A:middle
for Quick Looks in
the Playground.

00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:14.356 A:middle
We support colors, strings --
both plain text and attributed.

00:16:15.326 --> 00:16:18.016 A:middle
We can show images, views,

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:20.526 A:middle
in this case we'll capture
a snapshot of the view

00:16:20.526 --> 00:16:21.976 A:middle
at that point in time.

00:16:22.426 --> 00:16:24.066 A:middle
We can show arrays
and dictionaries

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:26.446 A:middle
as we'll show a structured
version of the array

00:16:26.446 --> 00:16:28.046 A:middle
or dictionary, ah,
like you might see

00:16:28.046 --> 00:16:29.336 A:middle
in the variables
view on the debugger.

00:16:30.676 --> 00:16:32.526 A:middle
We can show points,
rects, and sizes.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:34.666 A:middle
We'll kind of create a graphical
representation of those.

00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:38.966 A:middle
We can show Bézier paths, so
both NSBezierPath on the Mac

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:41.466 A:middle
and UIBezierPath on iOS.

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:45.546 A:middle
We can show URLs, for this we'll
take the plain text of the URL

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.186 A:middle
and show it in the sidebar.

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:48.396 A:middle
But if you Quick Look, it
will show you a web view

00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:49.696 A:middle
with the contents of that URL.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:52.266 A:middle
And finally, for types

00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:54.196 A:middle
if we don't have a native
Quick Look representation,

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:57.626 A:middle
we can usually get a
structured view of it, again,

00:16:57.626 --> 00:16:59.756 A:middle
like you would see in the
variables view in the debugger.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:02.686 A:middle
So here I have an
object of a class

00:17:02.686 --> 00:17:03.886 A:middle
that I created in
the Playground.

00:17:04.336 --> 00:17:06.586 A:middle
And it is, it has a
couple of properties,

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:08.226 A:middle
a foo property and
a bar property.

00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:10.106 A:middle
And you're seeing the
values of those at that line

00:17:10.106 --> 00:17:11.266 A:middle
of code when it executed.

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:15.086 A:middle
In this demo, I also showed
you how you can use your own

00:17:15.086 --> 00:17:16.346 A:middle
resources with Playgrounds.

00:17:16.516 --> 00:17:17.766 A:middle
And this is actually
fairly easy.

00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:20.606 A:middle
So you just go ahead and
show the file inspector.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:24.236 A:middle
You select a location
for Playground resources.

00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:25.626 A:middle
And for this we have
three options.

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:29.266 A:middle
We've got an Absolute Path
option which basically says,

00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:31.166 A:middle
"OK, I've got this folder
of resources somewhere

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:32.826 A:middle
on my computer and
I'd like to show it

00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:34.226 A:middle
and use it with the Playground."

00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:38.346 A:middle
We have a Relative to
Playground path option.

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:39.816 A:middle
And this is really great

00:17:39.816 --> 00:17:41.606 A:middle
if you're checking your
Playground into SCM.

00:17:41.606 --> 00:17:44.006 A:middle
Because you can say, "Oh, you
know, here's this Playground

00:17:44.006 --> 00:17:46.086 A:middle
and here's this folder of
resources that's next to it,

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:48.546 A:middle
I can set this up and then when
you use other people to check

00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:52.486 A:middle
out your repository, then it
will automatically be able

00:17:52.486 --> 00:17:54.046 A:middle
to use the Playground
with its resources."

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:57.696 A:middle
Finally, we support an
Inside Playground option.

00:17:57.696 --> 00:17:58.956 A:middle
And this is great
if you're sharing

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
in ways other than via SCM.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
in ways other than via SCM.

00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:03.796 A:middle
Because you can just say, "I
want to store my resources

00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:06.286 A:middle
in my Playground" and you can
email that out to other people

00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.466 A:middle
and see, when they open
it, they'll be able

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.246 A:middle
to see those resources
immediately.

00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:14.506 A:middle
Once you have made
the selection,

00:18:14.776 --> 00:18:17.406 A:middle
to access these resources
in your Playground source,

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:18.966 A:middle
you just use things like,

00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:21.706 A:middle
NSBundle.pathForResource
ofType and NSImage named.

00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
The resources just show
up as the resources

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:26.766 A:middle
for the main bundle during
Playground execution.

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:31.816 A:middle
So, now that we have the
basics out of the way,

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.016 A:middle
I think I'd like to start
talking to you about some

00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:35.836 A:middle
of the use cases for
which Playgrounds would be

00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:36.256 A:middle
really great.

00:18:36.626 --> 00:18:38.746 A:middle
And the first of these
is Experimentation.

00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:42.026 A:middle
I'm sure that all of you
out there have a folder

00:18:42.026 --> 00:18:43.656 A:middle
on your computer which
looks something like this.

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:46.046 A:middle
It's just a bunch of
Xcode projects created

00:18:46.046 --> 00:18:49.056 A:middle
from the template that are,
you know, maybe 1 or 2 changes

00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:51.376 A:middle
to see how something works
or to test out an idea.

00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:54.016 A:middle
It's actually isn't
that easy of a process.

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:55.216 A:middle
You know, you have to
do many different --

00:18:55.216 --> 00:18:58.676 A:middle
you have to first choose the
right project template then find

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
the right file in that project
to edit which may be easy


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
the right file in that project
to edit which may be easy

00:19:01.706 --> 00:19:03.646 A:middle
or maybe not depending on
which template you chose.

00:19:04.356 --> 00:19:06.666 A:middle
You'd have to do what you're
trying to do in the first place,

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:07.636 A:middle
and that's write some code.

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:10.016 A:middle
Once you've written
something, you then have

00:19:10.056 --> 00:19:11.156 A:middle
to build your project.

00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:13.756 A:middle
You then run whatever you built.

00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:15.936 A:middle
And for iOS that may
involve deploying

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:17.306 A:middle
to a simulator or to a device.

00:19:18.476 --> 00:19:20.356 A:middle
And if you didn't get it right
the first time, you'd then have

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:22.556 A:middle
to redo this, stop in
the debugger and step

00:19:22.556 --> 00:19:25.416 A:middle
through your code to figure out
where things are going wrong.

00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:27.726 A:middle
We think Playgrounds can
handle this a whole lot better.

00:19:28.056 --> 00:19:29.896 A:middle
That's because there's
really only 2 steps.

00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:31.596 A:middle
You would just, say, get started

00:19:31.596 --> 00:19:33.856 A:middle
with a Playground
and write your code.

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:35.806 A:middle
Once you start writing
your code,

00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:38.326 A:middle
we'll automatically execute it
for you and show you the results

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:40.516 A:middle
in the sidebar so you can see
where things are going wrong.

00:19:40.926 --> 00:19:44.296 A:middle
So now, I think I'd
like to show you a demo

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:45.136 A:middle
of what this looks like.

00:19:45.136 --> 00:19:46.516 A:middle
So let's go back to
the demo machine.

00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:47.396 A:middle
So here I am.

00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:49.576 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
just launch Xcode again.

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:53.166 A:middle
And this time I'm going to
create an iOS-based Playground.

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:59.686 A:middle
So I'll say, File, New File,
and I'll say, iOS Playground.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:02.356 A:middle
And I want to actually test

00:20:02.356 --> 00:20:04.846 A:middle
out how the UITableViewCell
style API works.

00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:07.206 A:middle
So, I'm just going to call
and create this Playground

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.296 A:middle
and call it TestTableViewCell.

00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:13.376 A:middle
Save it to the desktop, and OK.

00:20:13.376 --> 00:20:15.066 A:middle
So, here we have
our iOS Playground.

00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:18.796 A:middle
It's, you know, importing UIKit,
but otherwise, it's the same,

00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:20.776 A:middle
we're just creating a string
and assigning it to a variable.

00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:24.766 A:middle
So, if I want to use a
UITableViewCell style,

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.486 A:middle
I need a UITableViewCell.

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:29.256 A:middle
And the best way to show
that is with a UITableView.

00:20:29.656 --> 00:20:31.226 A:middle
In order to get those cells

00:20:31.226 --> 00:20:33.266 A:middle
into my UITableView,
I need a data source.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.626 A:middle
So, let's just go ahead and
implement a data source.

00:20:36.096 --> 00:20:38.926 A:middle
So I'll say "class DataSource".

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:42.766 A:middle
We'll inherit from
NSObject and we'll conform

00:20:42.766 --> 00:20:45.756 A:middle
to the UITableViewDataSource
protocol.

00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:50.046 A:middle
Notice now that we're getting
an issue here and that's

00:20:50.046 --> 00:20:52.256 A:middle
because the DataSource we've
created does not actually

00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:54.036 A:middle
conform to
UITableViewDataSource.

00:20:54.606 --> 00:20:55.806 A:middle
And, you know, that's expected.

00:20:55.806 --> 00:20:57.386 A:middle
We haven't actually
implemented any methods yet.

00:20:58.196 --> 00:21:01.106 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to
jump to the declaration


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.196 --> 00:21:01.106 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to
jump to the declaration

00:21:01.106 --> 00:21:04.216 A:middle
of UITableViewDataSource by
command-option-clicking on it.

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.766 A:middle
We see that we then open
the assistant editor.

00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:09.486 A:middle
And instead of showing
you UITableView.h,

00:21:09.706 --> 00:21:13.576 A:middle
we're going to show you a
Swift version of that header.

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.246 A:middle
So, in this case, we're seeing,
you know, here's our protocol.

00:21:16.486 --> 00:21:18.926 A:middle
We're seeing that we need to
implement these two methods.

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:22.226 A:middle
And so, OK, I'm just going to
take this one, this first one

00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:25.226 A:middle
to tell the TableView the
number of rows per section.

00:21:25.226 --> 00:21:27.636 A:middle
I'm going to copy
and paste it in here.

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:31.616 A:middle
And then I'm just going to start
things out, return 1 from this.

00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:34.676 A:middle
So, OK. So that's
the number of rows.

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:38.976 A:middle
Let's also provide the cell.

00:21:39.196 --> 00:21:42.086 A:middle
And OK, let's just go ahead
and create our UITableViewCell.

00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:45.966 A:middle
Let's say let cell
equals UITableViewCell.

00:21:47.026 --> 00:21:48.746 A:middle
I need to fix this typo.

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:54.596 A:middle
Here, we'll say the style, we'll
just say the default style.

00:21:55.136 --> 00:21:56.646 A:middle
And then for the
reuseIdentifier,

00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:59.256 A:middle
we aren't actually going
to be reusing these cells

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
so we can just pass
nil for this parameter.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
so we can just pass
nil for this parameter.

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:03.986 A:middle
And OK, so there
we have our cell.

00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:05.706 A:middle
Let's go ahead and configure it.

00:22:06.086 --> 00:22:11.816 A:middle
So, I can say something like
cell.textLabel.text equals Text.

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:14.376 A:middle
OK. So that's the text label.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.436 A:middle
We'll see what that looks like.

00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:18.926 A:middle
UITableViewCell may also
have a detail text label.

00:22:18.976 --> 00:22:20.426 A:middle
But that's not guaranteed
to be the case.

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:22.396 A:middle
So I'm going to explicitly
handle the fact

00:22:22.396 --> 00:22:23.136 A:middle
that it's an optional.

00:22:23.296 --> 00:22:24.316 A:middle
So, I can say something like

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:30.156 A:middle
"if let detailTextLabel
equals cell.DetailTextLabel".

00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:34.846 A:middle
And so, if the code inside
of this "if" executes,

00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:36.716 A:middle
then we'll know that we
have a detailTextLabel.

00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:37.796 A:middle
So, I can say something like,

00:22:38.366 --> 00:22:43.516 A:middle
detailTextLabel.text
equals Detail Text,

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:45.186 A:middle
and we know that this is safe.

00:22:45.186 --> 00:22:47.866 A:middle
We're not going to accidentally
try to assign a property to nil.

00:22:48.336 --> 00:22:50.646 A:middle
So now that we've configured
our UITableViewCell,

00:22:50.646 --> 00:22:51.916 A:middle
I can just go ahead
and return that.

00:22:52.536 --> 00:22:55.966 A:middle
You can see now that we
no longer have an issue

00:22:56.036 --> 00:22:56.846 A:middle
in our Playground.

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:59.366 A:middle
But we're also not getting
any results in the sidebar.

00:22:59.406 --> 00:23:01.806 A:middle
That's because we haven't
actually instantiated our


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.406 --> 00:23:01.806 A:middle
That's because we haven't
actually instantiated our

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:02.466 A:middle
data source.

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:06.466 A:middle
So, I'll just say something like
DataSource equals DataSource

00:23:07.086 --> 00:23:09.896 A:middle
and then I can, you know,
I'll just create a TableView

00:23:09.936 --> 00:23:11.746 A:middle
and tell it to use
our DataSource.

00:23:13.026 --> 00:23:15.986 A:middle
So, let tableView
equals UITableView.

00:23:16.546 --> 00:23:20.296 A:middle
We'll pass it a frame
so, CGRect.

00:23:21.236 --> 00:23:23.326 A:middle
Again, we don't care
about the origin.

00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:25.436 A:middle
I'll pass 320 for the width,

00:23:25.436 --> 00:23:27.166 A:middle
and for the height we just
need enough to be able

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:29.556 A:middle
to show all the cells
we care about.

00:23:29.556 --> 00:23:30.786 A:middle
So, I'll just say
something like 240.

00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:33.336 A:middle
Finally, we'll pass
a style of Plain.

00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:37.026 A:middle
We'll then tell the tableView
to use our DataSource.

00:23:37.546 --> 00:23:42.036 A:middle
And then, we will tell the
tableView to reload data.

00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:44.996 A:middle
Let that Playground execute.

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:49.616 A:middle
And once it's finished
executing, we'll be able

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:51.336 A:middle
to see the tableView
we've created.

00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.376 A:middle
So, I'm going to just go ahead
and add this to the timeline.

00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:56.286 A:middle
We can see here that we've
created our tableView, you know,

00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:57.566 A:middle
we're seeing the
cell that we want,

00:23:57.766 --> 00:23:58.786 A:middle
with the text that we want.

00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.556 A:middle
So, OK. So that, you know,
gets us up and running.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.556 A:middle
So, OK. So that, you know,
gets us up and running.

00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:04.456 A:middle
But actually I want
to see the styles

00:24:04.516 --> 00:24:05.966 A:middle
for all the styles that we have.

00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:08.856 A:middle
So, I'm going to jump
back to the declaration

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:10.306 A:middle
of UITableViewCell style.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:12.766 A:middle
And you can see here
that there are 4 options.

00:24:12.856 --> 00:24:16.036 A:middle
So I'm going to change this
1 to a 4, so if 4 rows.

00:24:16.186 --> 00:24:18.386 A:middle
Instead of always
passing the default style,

00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:20.206 A:middle
I'm going to conditionalize
it based on the row

00:24:20.206 --> 00:24:21.056 A:middle
that we're currently at.

00:24:21.666 --> 00:24:25.126 A:middle
So, I'll say let row
equals IndexPath.row.

00:24:25.126 --> 00:24:29.146 A:middle
And I'll say something
like let style equals

00:24:29.146 --> 00:24:33.306 A:middle
UITableViewCellStyle.fromRaw.

00:24:34.376 --> 00:24:35.116 A:middle
I'll pass the row.

00:24:35.836 --> 00:24:40.606 A:middle
This fromRaw will convert the
UITable, the raw row integer

00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:42.896 A:middle
into a UITableViewCell
style optional.

00:24:43.456 --> 00:24:46.506 A:middle
And we confirm that by using
quick help and we can say that,

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:48.456 A:middle
"Oh, yes in fact, this
style is an optional

00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:49.716 A:middle
UITableViewCell style."

00:24:50.206 --> 00:24:51.526 A:middle
If we were to pass
this directly here,

00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:55.716 A:middle
we would get an error
as you can see here.

00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:58.376 A:middle
We need to explicitly handle
the fact that this could be nil.

00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:02.136 A:middle
You know, the UITableViewCell
initializer doesn't expect that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:02.136 A:middle
You know, the UITableViewCell
initializer doesn't expect that.

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.606 A:middle
So, let's go ahead
and check that.

00:25:04.606 --> 00:25:07.306 A:middle
So we'll say, if we have
a style, let's unwrap it,

00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:09.796 A:middle
otherwise you just
use the default style.

00:25:10.846 --> 00:25:12.636 A:middle
It's OK. Now that
we've handled that,

00:25:13.026 --> 00:25:15.626 A:middle
let the Playground
re-execute and let's jump back

00:25:15.626 --> 00:25:16.936 A:middle
to the timeline using
the jump bar.

00:25:17.496 --> 00:25:20.836 A:middle
And once it's re-executed,
we'll notice here

00:25:20.836 --> 00:25:24.976 A:middle
that we're now seeing all the
different UITableViewCell styles

00:25:25.036 --> 00:25:25.786 A:middle
in our tableView.

00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:27.916 A:middle
And so now, I have a Playground
which I can, you know,

00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:29.956 A:middle
share with my co-workers or
just keep it as a reference

00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:32.216 A:middle
for myself to see what
each UITableViewCell style

00:25:32.216 --> 00:25:32.606 A:middle
looks like.

00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:34.346 A:middle
Let's go back to slides now.

00:25:34.556 --> 00:25:36.916 A:middle
So that showed you how
great Playgrounds are

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:37.916 A:middle
for experimentation.

00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:39.686 A:middle
You just get started
with an idea,

00:25:39.946 --> 00:25:41.606 A:middle
write some code, and
see how it works.

00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:44.356 A:middle
And now I'd like to invite
Rick back on stage to talk

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:46.326 A:middle
about another great idea
we have for Playgrounds

00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:47.946 A:middle
and that's Algorithm
Development.

00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:48.386 A:middle
Rick?

00:25:49.056 --> 00:25:51.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Connor.

00:25:51.786 --> 00:25:55.586 A:middle
Developing algorithms and any
other separable pieces of code

00:25:55.586 --> 00:25:57.386 A:middle
in a Playground is
a great way to go.

00:25:57.596 --> 00:26:00.136 A:middle
And so to show you that, I'm
going to dive right into a demo.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.596 --> 00:26:00.136 A:middle
And so to show you that, I'm
going to dive right into a demo.

00:26:00.356 --> 00:26:03.456 A:middle
So what we're going to do today
is implement insertion sort,

00:26:03.456 --> 00:26:04.796 A:middle
a fairly straightforward sort.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:07.246 A:middle
We're going to create a brand
new Playground to do that.

00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:09.716 A:middle
So I'll just say get
started with a Playground,

00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:12.086 A:middle
and we'll call the
Playground InsertionSort

00:26:13.456 --> 00:26:14.486 A:middle
and save it on the desktop.

00:26:15.636 --> 00:26:17.486 A:middle
If you're not familiar
with insertion sort,

00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:19.886 A:middle
imagine that you have a hand of
cards and you want to put them

00:26:19.886 --> 00:26:21.916 A:middle
in order with the
lowest values in the left

00:26:22.176 --> 00:26:23.536 A:middle
and the highest values
on the right.

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:26.216 A:middle
One way you might do that
is, start with the second

00:26:26.216 --> 00:26:29.076 A:middle
to leftmost card and compare
its value to the leftmost card.

00:26:29.486 --> 00:26:31.256 A:middle
If it's less, you'd
swap the position

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.376 A:middle
of the two cards in your hand.

00:26:33.106 --> 00:26:35.406 A:middle
You'd then look at the third
to leftmost card and compare it

00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:36.556 A:middle
to the second to leftmost.

00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:39.596 A:middle
If it's less, you'd swap it,
compare it to the leftmost card,

00:26:39.836 --> 00:26:43.136 A:middle
swap it if needed, and go
on doing this for every card

00:26:43.136 --> 00:26:45.646 A:middle
in your hand until every
card had reached the correct,

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:46.376 A:middle
sorted position.

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:48.306 A:middle
When you're done, your
hand will be in order.

00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:51.756 A:middle
So, let's implement
that in a Playground.

00:26:52.016 --> 00:26:53.606 A:middle
To start with, we
need some random data

00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:54.586 A:middle
that we're going to sort.

00:26:55.006 --> 00:26:56.836 A:middle
So, I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going

00:26:56.836 --> 00:26:58.346 A:middle
to declare an array of data.

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:00.506 A:middle
I'm going to use var
because this needs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:00.506 A:middle
I'm going to use var
because this needs

00:27:00.506 --> 00:27:03.126 A:middle
to be a mutable array, so I
can add to it and sort it.

00:27:03.126 --> 00:27:06.786 A:middle
And we'll just make an empty
array of ints to start with.

00:27:07.156 --> 00:27:09.926 A:middle
And I could say for
i in 0 through 20,

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:11.506 A:middle
because maybe I want
20 data points.

00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:14.436 A:middle
I can say data.append
to add a new element.

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:17.776 A:middle
And let's use the
arc4random function

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:19.116 A:middle
to generate a random number.

00:27:19.616 --> 00:27:21.376 A:middle
That doesn't return a
Swift Int, so we're going

00:27:21.376 --> 00:27:23.286 A:middle
to cast it explicitly
to a Swift Int.

00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:27.536 A:middle
And we'll modulus it by 100 to
get a number between 0 and 99.

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:29.646 A:middle
So if I look at data here,

00:27:29.986 --> 00:27:31.776 A:middle
you can see I have a
result here on the right.

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:35.396 A:middle
Here's an array of what look
like pretty random numbers.

00:27:35.796 --> 00:27:37.966 A:middle
You'll also notice if I edit
the Playground source again it

00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:40.626 A:middle
reruns and I get a different
array of random numbers.

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:42.716 A:middle
Ah, OK, so that's great.

00:27:43.176 --> 00:27:46.156 A:middle
Well, it's nice to be able
to generate random data

00:27:46.156 --> 00:27:47.636 A:middle
but I probably don't
want it to change

00:27:47.636 --> 00:27:49.296 A:middle
on me every time I edit
the Playground source

00:27:49.296 --> 00:27:51.276 A:middle
because that might make it
hard to develop my algorithm.

00:27:51.276 --> 00:27:54.866 A:middle
So, let's grab this random
data and use it every time.

00:27:55.516 --> 00:27:57.806 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to
click over the result sidebar

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:02.836 A:middle
and use command-A to select
this data, command-C to copy it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:02.836 A:middle
and use command-A to select
this data, command-C to copy it,

00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:06.156 A:middle
and then I'm just going to paste
this in here as array literal.

00:28:06.286 --> 00:28:09.186 A:middle
And now I can work off the
same random data every time.

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:12.496 A:middle
OK. So, let's start
implementing our algorithm.

00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:14.386 A:middle
The first thing we
need is a function

00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:16.926 A:middle
to swap two points
of data in our array.

00:28:17.206 --> 00:28:19.176 A:middle
There actually is a
built-in function called swap

00:28:19.176 --> 00:28:19.826 A:middle
for this already.

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:22.186 A:middle
But for the sake of argument,
we'll implement it ourselves.

00:28:22.296 --> 00:28:23.596 A:middle
So, I'm going to say func.

00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:25.136 A:middle
I'll call mine exchange.

00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:29.376 A:middle
You know, we're going to make
this a generic because, well,

00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:30.526 A:middle
we have an array of ints.

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:34.016 A:middle
Our insertion sort should
be able to work on any type.

00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:37.006 A:middle
So, any type at least as
long as it's comparable.

00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:39.296 A:middle
One element can be
compared as greater

00:28:39.296 --> 00:28:40.346 A:middle
than or less than another.

00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:43.036 A:middle
So, we'll mostly work on
comparable types here,

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:45.046 A:middle
the exchange function
can work on any type

00:28:45.086 --> 00:28:46.396 A:middle
because we just are
swapping types.

00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:48.816 A:middle
So this is an exchange
using a type D.

00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:55.336 A:middle
And it's going to take an
array of T and two indexes

00:28:55.956 --> 00:28:58.206 A:middle
which we're going to
exchange in the array.

00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:02.066 A:middle
So, the simplest way to exchange
these objects is to assign one


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:02.066 A:middle
So, the simplest way to exchange
these objects is to assign one

00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:04.636 A:middle
to a temporary variable,
assign the second to the first,

00:29:04.636 --> 00:29:06.726 A:middle
and assign the temporary
variable to the second.

00:29:06.796 --> 00:29:09.866 A:middle
So, we can say let
temp equals data of i.

00:29:09.866 --> 00:29:13.226 A:middle
Data of i equals data of j.

00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:15.786 A:middle
And data of j equals temp.

00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:18.776 A:middle
OK. I think we've
implemented this correctly

00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:20.266 A:middle
but let's try it and find out.

00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:23.606 A:middle
I can say exchange,
pass my data array

00:29:24.286 --> 00:29:27.246 A:middle
and we'll say exchange the 0th
element with the second element.

00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:29.526 A:middle
And then we'll take a look
at our array when we're done.

00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:34.006 A:middle
So, before, element 0 was
12, and element 2 was 15,

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:37.126 A:middle
now element 0 is 15
and element 2 is 12.

00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:39.346 A:middle
So, it looks like
exchange works properly.

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:43.666 A:middle
OK. The next thing we need is
a function to, given an index,

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:45.176 A:middle
look at the data
point of that index,

00:29:45.486 --> 00:29:48.486 A:middle
compare it to the data point
to its left; if it's less,

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:51.096 A:middle
exchange them and keep
comparing and exchanging

00:29:51.096 --> 00:29:53.316 A:middle
until it reaches the correct
position in the array.

00:29:53.956 --> 00:29:56.796 A:middle
So, let's call this
function swapLeft.

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:00.936 A:middle
Again, it's a generic
but this time we need


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:00.936 A:middle
Again, it's a generic
but this time we need

00:30:00.936 --> 00:30:01.956 A:middle
to actually do a comparison.

00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:06.546 A:middle
So, we're going to say our type
D is comparable and we're going

00:30:06.546 --> 00:30:11.086 A:middle
to pass an array of T and an
index of the data point we want

00:30:11.086 --> 00:30:12.196 A:middle
to start swapping left.

00:30:13.236 --> 00:30:15.726 A:middle
OK. So, let's implement
this, we're going to start

00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:18.006 A:middle
with our index and go
back to position 1,

00:30:18.376 --> 00:30:20.946 A:middle
not 0 because there's nothing
to the left of 0 to swap.

00:30:20.946 --> 00:30:24.136 A:middle
So, I'm going to say
for i in, and, you know,

00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:26.366 A:middle
I could do a range
from 1 to index

00:30:26.716 --> 00:30:28.596 A:middle
but what I really
want is index to 1.

00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:32.716 A:middle
So I'm going to reverse
the range with reverse 1.

00:30:33.126 --> 00:30:35.686 A:middle
3 dots makes it a
fully closed range

00:30:35.686 --> 00:30:37.586 A:middle
which means it will go
all the way to index.

00:30:38.056 --> 00:30:41.116 A:middle
So, since I'm reversing this, it
goes from index and ends at 1.

00:30:42.256 --> 00:30:44.936 A:middle
And for each of these data
points, I'm just going to say

00:30:44.936 --> 00:30:49.476 A:middle
if data of i is less
than data of i minus 1,

00:30:51.796 --> 00:30:56.616 A:middle
exchange data i and i minus 1.

00:30:57.266 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
OK. If it's not less
than data of i minus 1,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.266 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
OK. If it's not less
than data of i minus 1,

00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:02.046 A:middle
it must have reached the
correct sort of position

00:31:02.046 --> 00:31:03.406 A:middle
in the array, so
we can stop there.

00:31:03.786 --> 00:31:05.286 A:middle
So, let's say else break.

00:31:06.526 --> 00:31:08.236 A:middle
OK. Let's try this function out.

00:31:08.696 --> 00:31:13.716 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
say swapLeft, pass data,

00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:17.396 A:middle
and let's pass element
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:19.206 A:middle
Let's pass element 6 left.

00:31:19.506 --> 00:31:23.666 A:middle
Oops! And look at our data.

00:31:23.666 --> 00:31:25.596 A:middle
And you can see the 0
has moved all the way

00:31:25.596 --> 00:31:27.956 A:middle
from the 6th position to
the beginning of the array

00:31:27.956 --> 00:31:29.546 A:middle
and everything's been
moved to the right.

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:31.776 A:middle
So it looks like this
function is working great too.

00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:35.516 A:middle
OK. The last thing we need is
to actually implement the sort,

00:31:35.596 --> 00:31:36.666 A:middle
so this should be pretty simple.

00:31:36.976 --> 00:31:38.506 A:middle
We'll call our function isort,

00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:41.566 A:middle
works again on type
T that is comparable.

00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:43.946 A:middle
And we can just pass
an array of T

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:45.406 A:middle
and it will sort
the whole array.

00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:49.426 A:middle
To do this, I'm just going to
say for i in 1 (we're starting

00:31:49.426 --> 00:31:52.016 A:middle
at 1 because there's nothing
to the left of 0 to sort to)

00:31:52.826 --> 00:32:01.476 A:middle
to data.count, swapLeft,
data and i.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:52.826 --> 00:32:01.476 A:middle
to data.count, swapLeft,
data and i.

00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:06.606 A:middle
So, let's try it
out, isort data.

00:32:06.796 --> 00:32:08.646 A:middle
And we'll look our data
array when we're done.

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:11.286 A:middle
And you can see it did a whole
bunch of assignments up here.

00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:14.476 A:middle
And now here's our
final array and it looks

00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:15.816 A:middle
like this is in sorted order.

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:18.156 A:middle
So, we've correctly
implemented insertion sort.

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:21.556 A:middle
So, this is great for a simple
algorithm like insertion sort.

00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:22.356 A:middle
That wasn't too hard.

00:32:22.656 --> 00:32:24.786 A:middle
But you know if I was doing
something more complicated,

00:32:24.966 --> 00:32:26.806 A:middle
it might be nice to
have more visibility

00:32:26.806 --> 00:32:28.456 A:middle
into exactly what's
going on here.

00:32:28.716 --> 00:32:31.076 A:middle
So, let's look at how we
might visualize our results

00:32:31.076 --> 00:32:31.866 A:middle
in more detail.

00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:35.456 A:middle
Well to start out with, let's
draw a graph of the results

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:37.106 A:middle
of the data at the beginning.

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:40.036 A:middle
To do that, I'm just going to
say for x in data (to iterate

00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:42.836 A:middle
through every data point)
and just print out x.

00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:46.346 A:middle
And so, you'll see there
are 20 data points here.

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:47.866 A:middle
So this line executed 20 times.

00:32:48.176 --> 00:32:50.156 A:middle
And if I click on the
Value History button,

00:32:51.106 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
I get a nice graph here showing
my data at the beginning and,

00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:55.736 A:middle
boy, that does look random.

00:32:56.456 --> 00:33:00.506 A:middle
OK. So, now I want
to try to print


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:56.456 --> 00:33:00.506 A:middle
OK. So, now I want
to try to print

00:33:00.506 --> 00:33:03.136 A:middle
out another graph every
time swapLeft is called,

00:33:03.136 --> 00:33:05.196 A:middle
so I can see what's
happening to the graph

00:33:05.456 --> 00:33:07.176 A:middle
over iterations of swapLeft.

00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:09.596 A:middle
And I could put this
"for" statement in the end

00:33:09.596 --> 00:33:12.096 A:middle
of swapLeft again and
show the Value History.

00:33:12.486 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
But again, in Value History
Timeline item for given,

00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:18.036 A:middle
a line is going to show all
the data from that line.

00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:19.886 A:middle
So, each time swapLeft
is called,

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:22.606 A:middle
its data would be
appended to the same graph.

00:33:22.896 --> 00:33:23.736 A:middle
That's not what I want.

00:33:23.736 --> 00:33:25.476 A:middle
I want a new graph,
every time it's called.

00:33:25.886 --> 00:33:28.406 A:middle
So to do that, we're going to
need a new tool in our toolbox.

00:33:28.576 --> 00:33:30.576 A:middle
I'm going to go back to
slides and show you that.

00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:33.096 A:middle
With Playgrounds, we're
shipping a new framework called

00:33:33.096 --> 00:33:36.156 A:middle
XCPlayground and it contains
some very useful utilities

00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:37.766 A:middle
for enhancing your Playgrounds.

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:42.136 A:middle
Right now, we have API for
manually capturing values

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:45.566 A:middle
to display in timeline items,
showing your views live

00:33:46.006 --> 00:33:48.496 A:middle
and extending execution
for asynchronous code.

00:33:49.536 --> 00:33:51.076 A:middle
Right now, we're
going to use the API

00:33:51.076 --> 00:33:52.826 A:middle
for manually capturing values.

00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:56.436 A:middle
That API is called
XCPCaptureValue.

00:33:56.976 --> 00:34:00.006 A:middle
It's a function that takes an
identifier, which is a string,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:56.976 --> 00:34:00.006 A:middle
It's a function that takes an
identifier, which is a string,

00:34:00.416 --> 00:34:02.156 A:middle
and your value, which
is of any type.

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:06.286 A:middle
When you pass it -- your value
-- it will take that value

00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:08.206 A:middle
and put it in a timeline
item for you.

00:34:08.826 --> 00:34:12.996 A:middle
So, the identifier that you pass
it identifies what timeline item

00:34:12.996 --> 00:34:14.545 A:middle
you want that value to go to.

00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:17.186 A:middle
If you call this function
on different lines

00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:18.786 A:middle
but pass the same identifier,

00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:20.735 A:middle
the values from those
different lines will go

00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.076 A:middle
to the same timeline item.

00:34:22.676 --> 00:34:25.775 A:middle
Conversely, and what we want
here, if you have one line

00:34:25.775 --> 00:34:28.786 A:middle
that calls XCPCaptureValue
but it's called multiple times

00:34:28.786 --> 00:34:29.886 A:middle
with different identifiers

00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:31.556 A:middle
and it passes those
different identifiers,

00:34:31.876 --> 00:34:34.396 A:middle
that one line can generate
multiple different timeline

00:34:34.396 --> 00:34:36.045 A:middle
items (or grabs, in our case).

00:34:36.735 --> 00:34:40.005 A:middle
That identifier is also shown
as the name of the timeline item

00:34:40.005 --> 00:34:42.156 A:middle
so you can easily see
what data is what.

00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:45.436 A:middle
The value pass can be
anything, because it's a generic

00:34:45.696 --> 00:34:48.126 A:middle
but it helps if it's a type
of value that we know how

00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:49.255 A:middle
to Quick Look appropriately.

00:34:50.076 --> 00:34:51.716 A:middle
So, let's go back
and give this a shot.

00:34:51.746 --> 00:34:54.606 A:middle
So to start out with, I
need to import XCPlayground

00:34:54.606 --> 00:34:59.946 A:middle
to make this API available
and I'm going to go ahead

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.186 A:middle
and define a new function.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.186 A:middle
and define a new function.

00:35:02.586 --> 00:35:04.506 A:middle
I'll call it visualize
and it's a generic.

00:35:04.856 --> 00:35:09.776 A:middle
And it will take an array of
type T and I'm going to use this

00:35:09.776 --> 00:35:11.806 A:middle
"for" loop in it, so
I'll just indent that

00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:12.796 A:middle
and close the function.

00:35:13.516 --> 00:35:15.726 A:middle
But instead of just
printing out x, what we want

00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:16.946 A:middle
to do is capture that value.

00:35:16.946 --> 00:35:18.836 A:middle
So, I'll call XCPCaptureValue.

00:35:19.456 --> 00:35:21.826 A:middle
I need an identifier, so
let's add one to our function.

00:35:21.826 --> 00:35:26.616 A:middle
So, identifier is a
string and we could pass

00:35:26.616 --> 00:35:30.466 A:middle
that identifier,
and our value is x.

00:35:31.386 --> 00:35:34.656 A:middle
OK. So let's try this function
out and visualize the data

00:35:34.656 --> 00:35:38.026 A:middle
at the start of our sort
and we'll label it Start

00:35:38.026 --> 00:35:39.976 A:middle
as the identifier just
so we know what's what.

00:35:39.976 --> 00:35:44.196 A:middle
And here you can see it ran and
here's our data at the start.

00:35:44.196 --> 00:35:45.946 A:middle
So that's a good start.

00:35:46.866 --> 00:35:49.316 A:middle
So now, we're going to go
ahead and visualize our data

00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:51.356 A:middle
after every iteration
of swapLeft.

00:35:51.356 --> 00:35:55.106 A:middle
So, I can call visualize,
I'll pass data as it is

00:35:55.106 --> 00:35:56.496 A:middle
after this iteration
of swapLeft.

00:35:56.946 --> 00:36:00.736 A:middle
And for our identifier, let's
label it after the iteration,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.946 --> 00:36:00.736 A:middle
And for our identifier, let's
label it after the iteration,

00:36:01.056 --> 00:36:02.906 A:middle
the number of times
that swapLeft is called,

00:36:03.816 --> 00:36:05.716 A:middle
which is the index parameter.

00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:08.556 A:middle
And so, I'm going
to let this run now.

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.326 A:middle
And you can see that it's
generated multiple graphs

00:36:11.606 --> 00:36:14.036 A:middle
labeled after the
iteration that we're on.

00:36:14.316 --> 00:36:15.976 A:middle
So, now we can just
scroll through here

00:36:15.976 --> 00:36:20.456 A:middle
and see what's happening to our
data over time as swapLeft runs

00:36:20.496 --> 00:36:21.906 A:middle
and the sort completes.

00:36:22.036 --> 00:36:24.706 A:middle
You can see it looks like our
data is getting sorted piece

00:36:24.706 --> 00:36:25.326 A:middle
by piece.

00:36:26.366 --> 00:36:28.876 A:middle
And so, at the end, we
have a nicely-sorted array.

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:32.606 A:middle
So there, we can easily
visualize exactly what's going

00:36:32.606 --> 00:36:33.656 A:middle
on with our algorithm.

00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:35.746 A:middle
We think you'll find
this very, very useful.

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:39.886 A:middle
OK. Let's move on
to another example.

00:36:39.886 --> 00:36:42.606 A:middle
I've got a heap Playground
I made here earlier.

00:36:43.136 --> 00:36:45.346 A:middle
And it's got this
HeapGrapher class at the top

00:36:45.346 --> 00:36:46.416 A:middle
which I'll explain in a moment.

00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:49.756 A:middle
But the meat of this class
is my heap class which,

00:36:49.886 --> 00:36:52.356 A:middle
if you're not familiar with
a heap, a heap is a type

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:55.176 A:middle
of balanced binary
tree where the value

00:36:55.176 --> 00:36:57.416 A:middle
of every node is
greater than or equal

00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
to the value of its children.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:00.286 --> 00:37:02.526 A:middle
Heaps are often used to
implement priority queues,

00:37:02.526 --> 00:37:03.616 A:middle
because it's very efficient

00:37:03.616 --> 00:37:05.606 A:middle
to remove the highest
priority item, that's the top

00:37:05.606 --> 00:37:08.466 A:middle
of the tree, and it's also
efficient to insert new items

00:37:08.466 --> 00:37:10.776 A:middle
into the correct position of
the tree for their priority.

00:37:11.906 --> 00:37:14.706 A:middle
We're implementing our heap
with an underlying array

00:37:14.706 --> 00:37:16.046 A:middle
to represent the tree.

00:37:16.286 --> 00:37:20.386 A:middle
And in our array, the tree
noted index i has children

00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:23.576 A:middle
at indexes i times 2
and i times 2 plus 1.

00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:25.746 A:middle
So you can see down here

00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
at the bottom we've
got some random data

00:37:27.756 --> 00:37:28.906 A:middle
that we seeded ourselves with.

00:37:29.386 --> 00:37:31.756 A:middle
And we've created a new
heap with that data.

00:37:31.756 --> 00:37:35.036 A:middle
And we "heapified the heap,"
which is to say, put that data

00:37:35.036 --> 00:37:36.696 A:middle
into correctly heap-sorted
order.

00:37:37.786 --> 00:37:39.876 A:middle
On the right, in
the results sidebar,

00:37:40.206 --> 00:37:42.236 A:middle
you can see our default
treatment

00:37:42.236 --> 00:37:44.816 A:middle
of this custom class is to
show the name of the class

00:37:44.866 --> 00:37:45.956 A:middle
and show its properties.

00:37:45.956 --> 00:37:47.866 A:middle
In this case, it has
one property which is

00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:50.996 A:middle
that heap array and here it
is before it's been heapified,

00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:52.136 A:middle
when it's not a correct heap.

00:37:52.856 --> 00:37:54.536 A:middle
And here it is after
it's been heapified,

00:37:54.536 --> 00:37:56.146 A:middle
when it's purportedly
a correct heap.

00:37:56.456 --> 00:37:59.206 A:middle
But you know, it's really
hard to tell looking

00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
at this array whether
that's a correct heap.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
at this array whether
that's a correct heap.

00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:03.726 A:middle
This array represents
a tree and, you know,

00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:05.666 A:middle
not so good at visualizing,
"Hh, well, here's I,

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:07.806 A:middle
and here's i times 2,
and yeah, that's less..."

00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:11.016 A:middle
Wouldn't it be much better if
I could just visualize this

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:13.746 A:middle
as a tree everywhere
my heap is referenced

00:38:13.746 --> 00:38:14.716 A:middle
to my Playground source?

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:16.626 A:middle
So let's see how to do that.

00:38:17.286 --> 00:38:19.366 A:middle
In order to visualize
my own custom class,

00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:22.026 A:middle
we're going to implement
Custom Quick Look Support

00:38:22.176 --> 00:38:23.146 A:middle
for this class.

00:38:23.446 --> 00:38:27.706 A:middle
Our Custom Quick Look Support
allows you to add Quick Looks

00:38:27.936 --> 00:38:31.436 A:middle
for subclasses of
NSObject only (right now).

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:35.486 A:middle
And to do it, you implement
the debugQuickLookObject method

00:38:36.086 --> 00:38:37.466 A:middle
which takes no parameters

00:38:37.706 --> 00:38:39.716 A:middle
and returns any object
as an optional.

00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:42.806 A:middle
And you're going to return
the value that you want

00:38:42.806 --> 00:38:44.796 A:middle
to represent your
object as its Quick Look.

00:38:45.676 --> 00:38:49.526 A:middle
So, right now, that
value (the values

00:38:49.526 --> 00:38:53.726 A:middle
that we support here) are
colors, strings (both plain

00:38:53.726 --> 00:38:57.516 A:middle
and attributed),
images, and Bézier paths.

00:38:57.516 --> 00:39:00.256 A:middle
So, for your Custom Quick Looks
you can use any of these types.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.516 --> 00:39:00.256 A:middle
So, for your Custom Quick Looks
you can use any of these types.

00:39:01.196 --> 00:39:04.076 A:middle
So, let's try it out.

00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:07.716 A:middle
OK. So I mentioned before I
had a little HeapGrapher class

00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:08.246 A:middle
that I wrote.

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.626 A:middle
That's a little class that knows
how to take an array and draw it

00:39:10.626 --> 00:39:11.916 A:middle
as a tree, so we're
going to use that.

00:39:12.426 --> 00:39:15.736 A:middle
We'll implement our
debugQuickLookObject method.

00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:20.996 A:middle
It takes any, or returns
any object as an optional

00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:25.726 A:middle
and we're just going to create
one of our HeapGraphers.

00:39:25.846 --> 00:39:30.696 A:middle
And this HeapGrapher knows
how to generate an NSImage

00:39:30.696 --> 00:39:33.256 A:middle
which is one of the Custom Quick
Look types, supported types.

00:39:33.356 --> 00:39:35.556 A:middle
So, we're just going to
return the image it generates

00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:39.066 A:middle
with g.graphHeap and
pass self.heaparray.

00:39:40.376 --> 00:39:42.536 A:middle
And now, when this runs, instead

00:39:42.536 --> 00:39:44.916 A:middle
of showing the default
representation for our class,

00:39:45.206 --> 00:39:47.536 A:middle
it shows our custom Quick
Look representation,

00:39:47.536 --> 00:39:48.286 A:middle
which is an image.

00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:50.176 A:middle
And so when I click
the Quick Look button,

00:39:50.486 --> 00:39:53.786 A:middle
you can see here it's
drawing my heap as a tree.

00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:56.346 A:middle
This is before it's been
heapified when you can see,

00:39:56.346 --> 00:39:59.096 A:middle
for example, 78 is less than 89.

00:39:59.096 --> 00:39:59.976 A:middle
So this is not a correct heap.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:03.776 A:middle
But if I Quick Look it
after it's been heapified,

00:40:04.066 --> 00:40:07.976 A:middle
I can now go, oh great, 91
is greater than 86 and 89,

00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:12.176 A:middle
86 is greater than 84 and
79, and so on and so forth,

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:14.576 A:middle
and I can really
easily visually verify

00:40:14.776 --> 00:40:15.926 A:middle
that this is a correct heap.

00:40:16.136 --> 00:40:19.666 A:middle
So that's how you can Quick Look
your own classes in Playgrounds

00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:21.406 A:middle
and we think you'll
find that very useful.

00:40:21.406 --> 00:40:22.026 A:middle
All right.

00:40:22.116 --> 00:40:24.796 A:middle
Next, we'd like to move on to
showing you how great it is

00:40:24.796 --> 00:40:26.366 A:middle
to do Custom View Development

00:40:26.366 --> 00:40:28.476 A:middle
and other drawing
development in Playground.

00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.656 A:middle
And to do that, I'm going
to hand it over to Connor.

00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:31.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Rick.

00:40:32.206 --> 00:40:36.396 A:middle
Another great use case we
think Playgrounds will be used

00:40:36.396 --> 00:40:37.846 A:middle
for is Custom View Development.

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:40.536 A:middle
And that's because you can
just start writing some code

00:40:40.716 --> 00:40:43.366 A:middle
and see the actual view
as it's being drawn

00:40:43.366 --> 00:40:45.106 A:middle
and as you're starting to
build up your drawing code.

00:40:45.426 --> 00:40:47.536 A:middle
So for this I have a goal.

00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:49.206 A:middle
I want to take this
Playground icon

00:40:49.206 --> 00:40:50.386 A:middle
and add some animation to it.

00:40:50.936 --> 00:40:52.756 A:middle
The icon that we
have is really great.

00:40:52.876 --> 00:40:54.746 A:middle
It conveys the playfulness
of Playgrounds.

00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.556 A:middle
But unlike Playgrounds
themselves, it's static.

00:40:57.616 --> 00:40:59.476 A:middle
There's nothing dynamic
about it.

00:40:59.906 --> 00:41:02.336 A:middle
And so, I'm going to try
to add animation to this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.906 --> 00:41:02.336 A:middle
And so, I'm going to try
to add animation to this.

00:41:02.476 --> 00:41:04.026 A:middle
And what better way
to do it than when

00:41:04.026 --> 00:41:04.996 A:middle
in a Playground itself?

00:41:05.076 --> 00:41:06.916 A:middle
So, let's jump over to the demo.

00:41:07.616 --> 00:41:11.016 A:middle
So OK, here I'm going to go
ahead and open up a Playground

00:41:11.016 --> 00:41:11.826 A:middle
that I've already started.

00:41:12.376 --> 00:41:16.686 A:middle
So, OK. So here we've
got a Playground.

00:41:16.686 --> 00:41:19.576 A:middle
We've got our subclass of NSView
called PlaygroundIconView.

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:22.416 A:middle
It has a few layers.

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:26.636 A:middle
It's got these three instance,
er, these three instance methods

00:41:26.636 --> 00:41:28.506 A:middle
which actually do the
setup of those layers.

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.066 A:middle
You see that they're
unimplemented right now

00:41:30.066 --> 00:41:31.346 A:middle
and we'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:41:31.766 --> 00:41:36.266 A:middle
I also have an extension of
NSColor which defines a couple

00:41:36.266 --> 00:41:38.506 A:middle
of colors for the
Playground icon itself.

00:41:39.016 --> 00:41:43.956 A:middle
I then have a helper function
to convert an NSBezierPath

00:41:44.306 --> 00:41:46.596 A:middle
to a CGPath for use
with CAShapeLayer.

00:41:47.256 --> 00:41:49.616 A:middle
Finally, I just go ahead
and create an instance

00:41:49.616 --> 00:41:50.786 A:middle
of my PlaygroundIconView.

00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:52.646 A:middle
And then, I put it
on a separate line

00:41:52.646 --> 00:41:53.936 A:middle
so I can add some stuff later.

00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:57.026 A:middle
Let's go ahead and show
that in the timeline.

00:41:58.306 --> 00:41:59.566 A:middle
So, OK. So you'll see now

00:41:59.566 --> 00:42:01.246 A:middle
that we've just got
ourselves an empty view here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.566 --> 00:42:01.246 A:middle
that we've just got
ourselves an empty view here.

00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:05.636 A:middle
So yes, we have an
empty view here.

00:42:06.986 --> 00:42:08.736 A:middle
We actually just
now need to go ahead

00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:10.536 A:middle
and implement these
setup functions.

00:42:11.026 --> 00:42:12.716 A:middle
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:42:13.126 --> 00:42:14.616 A:middle
So we'll start out
by creating the path

00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:15.986 A:middle
for the background layer.

00:42:19.516 --> 00:42:22.026 A:middle
So you can see here we're
creating NSBezierPath

00:42:22.026 --> 00:42:24.006 A:middle
and we can Quick Look it to
make sure it looks right.

00:42:24.006 --> 00:42:25.766 A:middle
And in fact, yeah,
that looks more or less

00:42:25.766 --> 00:42:26.936 A:middle
like the Playground icon.

00:42:27.496 --> 00:42:29.326 A:middle
So let's tell, let's
setup our layer.

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:33.456 A:middle
So OK, now we're
setting up the layer.

00:42:33.866 --> 00:42:35.296 A:middle
You can see here in the timeline

00:42:35.296 --> 00:42:38.236 A:middle
that we're now drawing the
layer where, you know...

00:42:38.236 --> 00:42:40.016 A:middle
We have the background, we've
got the little border there,

00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:41.806 A:middle
and so, OK, we've got
our background set up.

00:42:42.546 --> 00:42:45.476 A:middle
Let's also do the seesaw base
and we'll do the same thing.

00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:49.556 A:middle
We'll create a path for that.

00:42:49.556 --> 00:42:51.506 A:middle
And we'll let it execute
and we'll see here,

00:42:51.506 --> 00:42:52.676 A:middle
let's Quick Look, make sure...

00:42:52.846 --> 00:42:54.426 A:middle
Yeah, that looks more or
less like the little base

00:42:54.466 --> 00:42:56.446 A:middle
that we have for the
play- ...for the seesaw.

00:42:57.266 --> 00:42:59.406 A:middle
So let's set up the
layer itself as well.

00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:02.656 A:middle
And there, we just
make that change


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:02.656 A:middle
And there, we just
make that change

00:43:02.656 --> 00:43:04.686 A:middle
and immediately get the feedback
of seeing what that looks

00:43:04.686 --> 00:43:06.046 A:middle
like when drawn in our view.

00:43:06.606 --> 00:43:08.796 A:middle
Let's also do the seesaw layer.

00:43:08.876 --> 00:43:10.436 A:middle
I've got some code here
to set that up as well.

00:43:11.376 --> 00:43:14.346 A:middle
You see here that we're just,
you know, have a closure

00:43:14.346 --> 00:43:15.966 A:middle
which will create the
child layer itself.

00:43:15.966 --> 00:43:19.626 A:middle
We then create a couple
of layers for the children

00:43:19.626 --> 00:43:23.366 A:middle
on each side of the seesaw, and
then we set up the bench itself

00:43:23.366 --> 00:43:25.646 A:middle
and then add those layers
to our seesaw layer.

00:43:26.016 --> 00:43:28.806 A:middle
So, OK. So now we've
got ourselves something

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.546 A:middle
that looks kind of like
the Playground icon.

00:43:31.056 --> 00:43:33.426 A:middle
But like the icon itself,
it's not animating.

00:43:33.666 --> 00:43:35.446 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
add support for animation

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.546 A:middle
to our PlaygroundIconView.

00:43:37.296 --> 00:43:40.476 A:middle
I have a snippet
for that as well.

00:43:40.586 --> 00:43:42.186 A:middle
And so, let's walk
through what this is doing.

00:43:43.016 --> 00:43:46.006 A:middle
I define a constant for the
maximum angle of the seesaw.

00:43:46.066 --> 00:43:47.546 A:middle
I've, you know, worked
through this and I think pi

00:43:47.546 --> 00:43:48.636 A:middle
over 12 is about right.

00:43:49.136 --> 00:43:52.456 A:middle
I also have a property for the
current angle of the seesaw

00:43:52.456 --> 00:43:54.096 A:middle
after any pending
animation is finished.

00:43:54.586 --> 00:43:57.756 A:middle
And then have a property
which determines whether

00:43:57.756 --> 00:43:58.856 A:middle
or not it should be animating.

00:43:58.896 --> 00:44:01.356 A:middle
It starts out as false
but we have this code here


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.896 --> 00:44:01.356 A:middle
It starts out as false
but we have this code here

00:44:01.356 --> 00:44:03.946 A:middle
which executes whenever
this is set to say, "Well,

00:44:03.946 --> 00:44:06.576 A:middle
if the animation state
has changed and we're told

00:44:06.576 --> 00:44:08.706 A:middle
to animate, then just
start animating depending

00:44:08.706 --> 00:44:10.766 A:middle
on the current angle
of the seesaw."

00:44:11.626 --> 00:44:12.986 A:middle
I then have this helper method

00:44:13.046 --> 00:44:15.666 A:middle
for actually performing
the animation itself.

00:44:15.666 --> 00:44:18.386 A:middle
So we just, you know, go ahead
and create a CABasicAnimation,

00:44:18.386 --> 00:44:20.976 A:middle
set a couple of values,
set our timing function

00:44:20.976 --> 00:44:23.096 A:middle
to match what a seesaw
would actually look like.

00:44:23.096 --> 00:44:26.186 A:middle
Set the duration to what
was passed in which defaults

00:44:26.186 --> 00:44:29.296 A:middle
to 1-1/2 seconds, but can
be customized depending

00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:30.816 A:middle
on the angle of the seesaw.

00:44:31.356 --> 00:44:34.596 A:middle
We then add the animation
to our seesaw layer.

00:44:35.156 --> 00:44:37.696 A:middle
We set the underlying transform
property of that seesaw layer,

00:44:37.696 --> 00:44:40.156 A:middle
so that once the animation
completes it looks correct.

00:44:40.756 --> 00:44:42.466 A:middle
And then we update our
current seesaw angle

00:44:42.466 --> 00:44:43.466 A:middle
property accordingly.

00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:47.416 A:middle
Finally, we have, uh, we
implement the "animationDidStop,

00:44:47.416 --> 00:44:48.846 A:middle
finished" delegate callback.

00:44:48.846 --> 00:44:50.906 A:middle
Or basically say
that if we finished

00:44:50.906 --> 00:44:52.556 A:middle
and we're still supposed
to still be animating,

00:44:52.906 --> 00:44:54.886 A:middle
then just go ahead and
animate to the opposite angle

00:44:54.886 --> 00:44:57.336 A:middle
of what we currently are at.

00:44:57.336 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
So, OK. Let's go ahead and tell
this view to start animating.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.336 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
So, OK. Let's go ahead and tell
this view to start animating.

00:45:04.766 --> 00:45:07.646 A:middle
So we'll do that and you'll
notice that after it reruns,

00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.326 A:middle
we seeing the view update
it's look, you know,

00:45:10.326 --> 00:45:12.336 A:middle
so we see that it
tilted over to the side.

00:45:12.336 --> 00:45:14.206 A:middle
We're not seeing the
animation itself.

00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:15.876 A:middle
And for that, we're
going to need some help

00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.166 A:middle
from the XCPlayground framework.

00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:18.476 A:middle
So, let's switch back the slides

00:45:18.536 --> 00:45:19.396 A:middle
to see what that
could look like.

00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:21.646 A:middle
So the second piece
of functionality

00:45:21.646 --> 00:45:24.056 A:middle
which the XCPlayground framework
provides is the ability

00:45:24.056 --> 00:45:25.776 A:middle
to show live views
in the timeline.

00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:29.336 A:middle
And you do that by calling
this XCPShowView function.

00:45:29.646 --> 00:45:32.186 A:middle
It takes an identifier and the
view that you want to show.

00:45:32.716 --> 00:45:34.996 A:middle
After calling it, we'll show the
view live while the Playground

00:45:34.996 --> 00:45:36.956 A:middle
executes and then
we'll record frames

00:45:36.956 --> 00:45:38.016 A:middle
as the Playground executes

00:45:38.086 --> 00:45:40.606 A:middle
so you can play them back
once execution finishes.

00:45:41.216 --> 00:45:44.606 A:middle
The identifier you pass to this
function must be unique inside

00:45:44.606 --> 00:45:45.276 A:middle
of the Playground.

00:45:45.556 --> 00:45:46.686 A:middle
That's because this
is how we refer

00:45:46.686 --> 00:45:48.486 A:middle
to the live view
internally in Xcode.

00:45:48.906 --> 00:45:51.356 A:middle
And it is also what
we'd show as the title

00:45:51.356 --> 00:45:52.816 A:middle
for the live view
in the timeline.

00:45:54.056 --> 00:45:56.306 A:middle
The view pass must also
not have a superview.

00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:58.926 A:middle
This is because we will add
it to our own view hierarchy

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.086 A:middle
and it would generally not
produce the results you're


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.086 A:middle
and it would generally not
produce the results you're

00:46:01.086 --> 00:46:01.596 A:middle
looking for.

00:46:02.976 --> 00:46:05.426 A:middle
So with this in our toolbox,
let's jump back to the demo

00:46:05.426 --> 00:46:06.246 A:middle
and see how it's used.

00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:08.906 A:middle
So I'm going to go
ahead and just go ahead

00:46:08.906 --> 00:46:10.116 A:middle
and import XCPlayground.

00:46:10.676 --> 00:46:15.976 A:middle
And then down here, instead
of just having this view item,

00:46:15.976 --> 00:46:17.626 A:middle
I'm going to remove
that from the timeline.

00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:21.646 A:middle
I'm going to say
something like XCPShowView

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.296 A:middle
and pass an identifier.

00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:25.136 A:middle
It can be anything as
long as it's unique.

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:28.916 A:middle
So I'll say Playground
Icon View.

00:46:29.326 --> 00:46:30.966 A:middle
And then I'll pass the
view that we've created.

00:46:32.296 --> 00:46:33.786 A:middle
So, we'll just let
that re-execute.

00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:35.616 A:middle
And you see there
that in the timeline,

00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:37.836 A:middle
we're showing the view
live as it's animating.

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:41.556 A:middle
You-all also probably noticed
this little timeout field

00:46:41.556 --> 00:46:41.946 A:middle
down here.

00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:44.666 A:middle
And that lets us specify
the amount of time

00:46:44.666 --> 00:46:46.526 A:middle
which we'll let the
Playground continue executing

00:46:46.526 --> 00:46:48.906 A:middle
after we reach the end of
execution of the top of a code.

00:46:49.746 --> 00:46:52.476 A:middle
Now, it defaults to 30 seconds
but I'm going to adjust this

00:46:52.516 --> 00:46:54.166 A:middle
down since I know my
animation only takes

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:55.536 A:middle
about a second and a half.

00:46:55.536 --> 00:46:57.886 A:middle
So I'll do 10 seconds to
get a few times around.

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:00.886 A:middle
After we edit that,
we'll rerun it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:00.886 A:middle
After we edit that,
we'll rerun it.

00:47:01.506 --> 00:47:03.366 A:middle
And so that's great, you
know, we see it running there.

00:47:03.526 --> 00:47:06.516 A:middle
And I'd like to show how you
can integrate XCPShowView

00:47:06.516 --> 00:47:09.186 A:middle
with the XCPCaptureValue
API we mentioned earlier.

00:47:10.346 --> 00:47:13.526 A:middle
And so, what I'm going to do,
I'm going to capture the angle

00:47:13.526 --> 00:47:15.566 A:middle
of the seesaw, or
of the left edge

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.516 A:middle
of the seesaw as
we're animating.

00:47:19.766 --> 00:47:22.346 A:middle
So here, I'm just going
to say XCPCaptureValue.

00:47:23.226 --> 00:47:28.086 A:middle
I'll pass Left Seesaw
Position and I'll just pass 0

00:47:28.086 --> 00:47:29.626 A:middle
because we know at
this point that it's,

00:47:29.686 --> 00:47:31.326 A:middle
you know, it's flat on there.

00:47:32.436 --> 00:47:34.266 A:middle
Then you can take this and
I'm going to put it in our

00:47:34.266 --> 00:47:36.016 A:middle
"animationDidStop,
finished" callback.

00:47:36.126 --> 00:47:40.356 A:middle
Now I'm going to just pass the
negative currentSeesawAngle.

00:47:41.366 --> 00:47:43.296 A:middle
That's just because that's
what we need to do in order

00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:45.806 A:middle
to get the left position
of the seesaw.

00:47:45.906 --> 00:47:47.756 A:middle
That is how the angle works
out for the transform.

00:47:48.216 --> 00:47:50.716 A:middle
So you see here that
as we're executing,

00:47:50.716 --> 00:47:52.616 A:middle
we're getting the graph kind
of building up over time.

00:47:53.046 --> 00:47:54.646 A:middle
And then once execution
finishes,

00:47:54.776 --> 00:47:56.476 A:middle
the graph will snap
back into place and kind

00:47:56.476 --> 00:47:59.166 A:middle
of show you the best view of
the data that it collected.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:00.196 --> 00:48:02.606 A:middle
It's OK. You probably
also noticed this slider

00:48:02.606 --> 00:48:03.276 A:middle
became active.

00:48:03.746 --> 00:48:05.296 A:middle
And so, I can just go
ahead and take that

00:48:05.296 --> 00:48:06.786 A:middle
and drag it through here.

00:48:07.206 --> 00:48:09.596 A:middle
And you'll notice that we're
updating the graph at the bottom

00:48:09.596 --> 00:48:11.656 A:middle
but we're also showing you
the animation, you know,

00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:12.936 A:middle
as it went through in time.

00:48:13.006 --> 00:48:15.296 A:middle
So this is, you know, a
fairly basic animation

00:48:15.296 --> 00:48:17.296 A:middle
and it's doing what we
expected but, you know,

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:19.086 A:middle
if you had something
more complex and you want

00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:21.056 A:middle
to just kind of take a look
at just a small portion

00:48:21.056 --> 00:48:23.066 A:middle
of your animation, you
could do that as well.

00:48:23.666 --> 00:48:25.486 A:middle
And I can also do
something like, you know,

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:26.996 A:middle
click on one of these points.

00:48:26.996 --> 00:48:27.726 A:middle
So I can click there.

00:48:27.726 --> 00:48:30.066 A:middle
We can see it, you know, that
the two things are in sync.

00:48:30.066 --> 00:48:30.656 A:middle
I click there.

00:48:30.656 --> 00:48:31.516 A:middle
It updates the point.

00:48:31.516 --> 00:48:34.256 A:middle
I can use the arrow keys to
go through the graph's points

00:48:34.256 --> 00:48:35.596 A:middle
and see that, OK,
yeah, you know,

00:48:35.596 --> 00:48:38.296 A:middle
we're doing what
we expect it to do.

00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:41.056 A:middle
And so, that's how you can
show live views in the timeline

00:48:41.306 --> 00:48:42.916 A:middle
with the XCPlayground framework.

00:48:43.246 --> 00:48:44.206 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides now.

00:48:44.846 --> 00:48:45.696 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk to you

00:48:45.696 --> 00:48:47.256 A:middle
about how you can
use asynchronous code

00:48:47.256 --> 00:48:48.016 A:middle
in your Playgrounds.

00:48:48.146 --> 00:48:49.976 A:middle
You got a little taste of
this in the demo before.

00:48:49.976 --> 00:48:51.726 A:middle
But I'd like to go into a
little bit more detail now.

00:48:53.076 --> 00:48:54.306 A:middle
The third piece of functionality

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:57.076 A:middle
which the XCPlayground framework
provides is the ability

00:48:57.076 --> 00:48:58.316 A:middle
to extend execution.

00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.086 A:middle
By default, execution terminates
once all top-level code


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.086 A:middle
By default, execution terminates
once all top-level code

00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:02.836 A:middle
has executed.

00:49:03.336 --> 00:49:05.256 A:middle
XCPlayground, though,
provides API

00:49:05.426 --> 00:49:07.006 A:middle
for extending execution
indefinitely.

00:49:07.226 --> 00:49:09.186 A:middle
That's this
XCPSetExecutionShould

00:49:09.186 --> 00:49:10.546 A:middle
ContinueIndefinitely function.

00:49:10.976 --> 00:49:13.456 A:middle
You should know that this is
actually not quite indefinite.

00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:17.306 A:middle
The execution time is controlled
by the timeline's timeout

00:49:17.306 --> 00:49:18.906 A:middle
which defaults to 30 seconds.

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:22.786 A:middle
Additionally, execution
will be terminated

00:49:22.786 --> 00:49:24.686 A:middle
if you edit the Playground
while it's running.

00:49:25.056 --> 00:49:27.716 A:middle
This is so that we can show
you up to date results rather

00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:29.776 A:middle
than let, leaving you a
stale results while we wait

00:49:29.776 --> 00:49:31.346 A:middle
for an earlier execution
to finish.

00:49:32.746 --> 00:49:34.786 A:middle
Additionally, as you saw
on the last demo, you know,

00:49:34.786 --> 00:49:35.956 A:middle
we didn't actually
call this function,

00:49:35.956 --> 00:49:38.236 A:middle
but we saw that execution
continued

00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:40.636 A:middle
after we reached the
end of top-level code.

00:49:41.156 --> 00:49:43.166 A:middle
That's because XCPShowView
implicitly

00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:45.106 A:middle
calls XCPSetExecutionShould

00:49:45.106 --> 00:49:46.126 A:middle
ContinueIndefinitely.

00:49:46.326 --> 00:49:48.786 A:middle
You should just think
about this as if nothing

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:50.356 A:middle
in the Playground
source has told Xcode

00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:51.836 A:middle
that the Playground
used to stay alive,

00:49:52.296 --> 00:49:54.636 A:middle
then the Playground will stop
executing once we reach the end

00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:55.786 A:middle
of top-level code.

00:49:56.336 --> 00:49:58.146 A:middle
So now, I'd like to show you
a quick demo of what it's

00:49:58.146 --> 00:49:59.856 A:middle
like to use asynchronous
code in Playgrounds.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:00.076 --> 00:50:02.826 A:middle
So here I am back here
and I have a Playground

00:50:02.826 --> 00:50:04.596 A:middle
which uses asynchronous code.

00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:07.886 A:middle
We create, uh, we have
our session delegate

00:50:07.986 --> 00:50:09.666 A:middle
which is an
NSURLSessionDelegate.

00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:11.206 A:middle
It has a few callbacks.

00:50:11.686 --> 00:50:13.146 A:middle
And then we also just, you know,

00:50:13.496 --> 00:50:14.626 A:middle
create an instance
of our delegate.

00:50:14.626 --> 00:50:16.356 A:middle
We created an NSURLSession.

00:50:17.036 --> 00:50:20.476 A:middle
And then create a data task
to download the contents

00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:21.546 A:middle
of the Apple home page.

00:50:21.826 --> 00:50:23.886 A:middle
We then tell the
data task to resume.

00:50:24.736 --> 00:50:25.576 A:middle
And you noticed that, you know,

00:50:25.576 --> 00:50:27.006 A:middle
the Playground itself
has executed

00:50:27.486 --> 00:50:29.506 A:middle
but we're not receiving
any results up here.

00:50:29.636 --> 00:50:31.846 A:middle
And if I open up the
assistant editor, you'll notice

00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:36.246 A:middle
that we haven't received any
console output even though they

00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:39.276 A:middle
were clearly logging here that
we've received some bytes.

00:50:40.826 --> 00:50:41.956 A:middle
And this is because nothing

00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:43.796 A:middle
in the Playground has
told the Playground

00:50:43.796 --> 00:50:45.066 A:middle
that it should continue
executing.

00:50:45.536 --> 00:50:49.686 A:middle
So we call task.resume, we
resume the task and then as soon

00:50:49.686 --> 00:50:51.656 A:middle
as that finishes, we hit
the end of top-level code

00:50:51.996 --> 00:50:53.746 A:middle
and the Playground
just stops executing.

00:50:54.106 --> 00:50:57.226 A:middle
Let's go ahead and say
import XCPlayground.

00:50:58.226 --> 00:51:00.716 A:middle
And then we can say
XCPSetExecution


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.226 --> 00:51:00.716 A:middle
And then we can say
XCPSetExecution

00:51:00.716 --> 00:51:04.676 A:middle
ShouldContinue,
XCPSetExecutionShould

00:51:04.676 --> 00:51:05.716 A:middle
ContinueIndefinitely.

00:51:05.886 --> 00:51:08.346 A:middle
This takes a Bool but
that defaults to true,

00:51:08.486 --> 00:51:10.196 A:middle
so you typically don't need
to pass anything there.

00:51:10.196 --> 00:51:11.136 A:middle
And I won't do that here.

00:51:11.956 --> 00:51:13.976 A:middle
You'll now notice that, you
know, we were receiving results

00:51:13.976 --> 00:51:15.936 A:middle
from here and we're also
seeing the console output

00:51:15.936 --> 00:51:17.776 A:middle
that we expect in the timeline.

00:51:18.496 --> 00:51:20.696 A:middle
So OK, that's how you
use asynchronous code

00:51:20.696 --> 00:51:21.256 A:middle
in Playgrounds.

00:51:21.446 --> 00:51:22.356 A:middle
Let's go back to slides now.

00:51:23.066 --> 00:51:25.096 A:middle
There are a few alternatives
but we really think

00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:28.306 A:middle
that you should typically
use XCPSetExecutionShould

00:51:28.306 --> 00:51:29.696 A:middle
ContinueIndefinitely
when you're trying

00:51:29.696 --> 00:51:31.476 A:middle
to use asynchronous
code in Playgrounds.

00:51:31.606 --> 00:51:33.316 A:middle
If that won't work
for you though,

00:51:33.316 --> 00:51:34.816 A:middle
you can use other
methods for waiting

00:51:34.816 --> 00:51:36.566 A:middle
for asynchronous
operations to finish.

00:51:37.036 --> 00:51:39.086 A:middle
Basically, you just need to make
sure you don't reach the end

00:51:39.086 --> 00:51:41.166 A:middle
of top-level code before
your operation completes.

00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.376 A:middle
Before we leave today, I'd like
to talk to you a little bit

00:51:44.376 --> 00:51:46.456 A:middle
about some of the limitations
we have with Playgrounds.

00:51:47.696 --> 00:51:49.616 A:middle
First off, you should
not use performance, uh,

00:51:49.616 --> 00:51:51.386 A:middle
Playgrounds for any
performance testing.

00:51:51.756 --> 00:51:53.356 A:middle
That's because the
logging of results

00:51:53.356 --> 00:51:55.506 A:middle
in the Playground will
generally dominate the runtime,

00:51:55.746 --> 00:51:57.076 A:middle
not your actual code.

00:51:57.556 --> 00:51:59.806 A:middle
This means that the performance
will be dependent on the number

00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:02.506 A:middle
of lines of code executed,
not the actual performance


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:02.506 A:middle
of lines of code executed,
not the actual performance

00:52:02.506 --> 00:52:04.036 A:middle
of whatever it is
you are developing.

00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:06.456 A:middle
And that's not necessarily
what you'd expect.

00:52:07.706 --> 00:52:10.306 A:middle
Instead we'd suggest that
you use the XCTest framework

00:52:10.606 --> 00:52:12.386 A:middle
to create performance
tests in a test bundle

00:52:12.386 --> 00:52:14.276 A:middle
where you can get
more accurate results.

00:52:15.126 --> 00:52:17.556 A:middle
We have a session later this
week called Testing in Xcode 6

00:52:17.556 --> 00:52:18.956 A:middle
which will go into
this in more detail.

00:52:21.006 --> 00:52:23.186 A:middle
There are few more
limitations with Playgrounds.

00:52:23.606 --> 00:52:24.866 A:middle
Playgrounds cannot
be used for things

00:52:24.866 --> 00:52:27.036 A:middle
which require user interaction.

00:52:27.636 --> 00:52:29.526 A:middle
So we have great support
for showing live views

00:52:29.776 --> 00:52:31.646 A:middle
but you can only see them,
you can't touch them.

00:52:31.646 --> 00:52:35.236 A:middle
We also do not support using
Playgrounds for anything

00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:36.726 A:middle
which require custom
entitlements.

00:52:38.016 --> 00:52:40.206 A:middle
For iOS Playgrounds, we
only support executing

00:52:40.206 --> 00:52:41.146 A:middle
against the simulator.

00:52:41.406 --> 00:52:44.186 A:middle
So anything which requires a
device will not be supported

00:52:44.186 --> 00:52:44.896 A:middle
with Playgrounds.

00:52:46.046 --> 00:52:48.556 A:middle
And finally, we do not
support using your own app

00:52:48.556 --> 00:52:50.956 A:middle
or framework code in a
Playground unless it's something

00:52:50.956 --> 00:52:53.026 A:middle
that you can just copy and paste
into the Playground source.

00:52:53.416 --> 00:52:55.806 A:middle
Basically, you can only use
things in the standard library,

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.036 A:middle
in the SDK, or that's in the
Playground source itself.

00:52:59.516 --> 00:53:02.826 A:middle
You can get around some of these
limitations by using the REPL.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.516 --> 00:53:02.826 A:middle
You can get around some of these
limitations by using the REPL.

00:53:03.456 --> 00:53:05.766 A:middle
The REPL is the command
line interface to Swift

00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:09.216 A:middle
and it works this way because
the REPL can actually execute

00:53:09.216 --> 00:53:10.166 A:middle
in your own process.

00:53:10.416 --> 00:53:13.216 A:middle
You just stop at a breakpoint,
and then at the LLDB prompt,

00:53:13.216 --> 00:53:15.926 A:middle
you execute the REPL command
and you'll just be dropped

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.316 A:middle
down right into the Swift REPL.

00:53:18.606 --> 00:53:21.186 A:middle
Playgrounds though provide a
richer experience than the REPL.

00:53:21.236 --> 00:53:23.286 A:middle
And that's because we will
automatically execute your code

00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:24.106 A:middle
from a known state.

00:53:24.456 --> 00:53:27.666 A:middle
That means, you know, you make a
single edit to a line and then,

00:53:27.666 --> 00:53:29.096 A:middle
you know, we just
rerun it from 0.

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.716 A:middle
Whereas with the REPL, if
you wanted to make an edit

00:53:31.716 --> 00:53:33.926 A:middle
to something earlier in the
source that you had entered,

00:53:33.926 --> 00:53:35.366 A:middle
you have to, you know,
get the process back

00:53:35.366 --> 00:53:37.776 A:middle
into the state then, you
know, reenter the REPL,

00:53:37.776 --> 00:53:39.706 A:middle
retype everything
making that one change

00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:41.046 A:middle
to see how it affects things.

00:53:41.976 --> 00:53:43.856 A:middle
Playgrounds also supports some
of these higher level futures

00:53:43.856 --> 00:53:47.256 A:middle
like Quick Looks and a timeline
which we do not support, uh,

00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:48.486 A:middle
which the REPL does not support.

00:53:49.796 --> 00:53:51.726 A:middle
If you'd like to learn
more about the REPL,

00:53:51.806 --> 00:53:55.066 A:middle
you can go to the Introduction
to LLDB and the Swift REPL talk.

00:53:55.426 --> 00:53:58.166 A:middle
And we'll go into much more
detail about how the REPL works.

00:53:58.736 --> 00:54:02.786 A:middle
In summary, we think Playgrounds
are a great way to play


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:58.736 --> 00:54:02.786 A:middle
In summary, we think Playgrounds
are a great way to play

00:54:02.786 --> 00:54:05.346 A:middle
with Swift, with Cocoa
and with Cocoa Touch.

00:54:05.846 --> 00:54:07.906 A:middle
We think you can use them
for things like learning,

00:54:07.986 --> 00:54:11.336 A:middle
exploration and visualization
and frankly probably tons

00:54:11.336 --> 00:54:12.906 A:middle
of things which we haven't
even thought of yet.

00:54:13.716 --> 00:54:16.316 A:middle
The XCPlayground
framework provides APIs

00:54:16.316 --> 00:54:18.376 A:middle
for using your Playgrounds
for more advanced things.

00:54:18.446 --> 00:54:20.906 A:middle
So you can do things like
manually capture values

00:54:20.906 --> 00:54:22.546 A:middle
with the XCPCaptureValue API.

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:26.696 A:middle
You can show live views in the
timeline by calling XCPShowView.

00:54:27.186 --> 00:54:29.046 A:middle
And then you can
also extend execution

00:54:29.046 --> 00:54:32.206 A:middle
for asynchronous operations
with the XCPSetExecutionShould

00:54:32.206 --> 00:54:33.656 A:middle
ContinueIndefinitely function.

00:54:34.656 --> 00:54:36.616 A:middle
Finally, we'd really like to
just encourage you to go out

00:54:36.616 --> 00:54:37.576 A:middle
and give Playgrounds a try.

00:54:37.576 --> 00:54:39.516 A:middle
I think, you know,
they're really approachable

00:54:39.756 --> 00:54:41.026 A:middle
and if you just sit
down with them

00:54:41.026 --> 00:54:42.796 A:middle
for a little bit you'll
find a number of great ways

00:54:42.796 --> 00:54:44.736 A:middle
to integrate them into
your development process.

00:54:46.066 --> 00:54:48.586 A:middle
For more information, you can
contact our Developer Tools

00:54:48.586 --> 00:54:49.686 A:middle
Evangelist, Dave DeLong.

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.466 A:middle
We also have some
information about Playgrounds

00:54:51.466 --> 00:54:53.286 A:middle
in the Source Editor
Help for Xcode 6.

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:55.316 A:middle
You can also ask
questions about Playgrounds

00:54:55.316 --> 00:54:56.896 A:middle
on the Apple Developer Forums.

00:54:57.526 --> 00:55:01.146 A:middle
We have several related
sessions about Swift this week.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:57.526 --> 00:55:01.146 A:middle
We have several related
sessions about Swift this week.

00:55:01.146 --> 00:55:04.846 A:middle
So there was an Introduction
to Swift session yesterday,

00:55:04.916 --> 00:55:06.016 A:middle
which you can catch
on the video.

00:55:06.016 --> 00:55:08.906 A:middle
We also have an Intermediate
Swift session later

00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:09.626 A:middle
this afternoon.

00:55:10.156 --> 00:55:12.946 A:middle
