00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:12.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody.

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:14.886 A:middle
I'm Chris Espinosa from Apple.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:16.406 A:middle
We're going to have
a lot of fun today.

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.476 A:middle
We're talking about
kids and apps.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:22.186 A:middle
Going to cover a few things,
going to talk about the history

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:24.856 A:middle
of Apple and kids, how
we got where we are.

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.306 A:middle
Some recent regulatory
activity worldwide

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.116 A:middle
and in the U.S. that's
going to affect you

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:32.966 A:middle
if you're vending apps
that are addressed to kids,

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:38.036 A:middle
some new programs we've had in
the last year for Apple I.Ds

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.486 A:middle
for kids under 13, both the
Student Apple ID program

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:43.726 A:middle
and Family Sharing that
was introduced on Monday,

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.256 A:middle
talk about your responsibilities
if you're selling apps

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:51.086 A:middle
that are directed at kids, some
best practices for doing that

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:54.066 A:middle
and then a brief view about what
to do about other countries,

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:57.196 A:middle
but first of all
a little history,

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:59.736 A:middle
Apple and kids go way back.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:02.116 A:middle
I personally know this,
because I was a kid

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:06.486 A:middle
when I started working at
Apple on the Apple II in 1977.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.916 A:middle
One of our first programs
was called Kids Can't Wait.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:13.316 A:middle
We've been getting
computers in front of kids

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:17.636 A:middle
for almost 40 years from the
Apple II through the iMac.

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:21.296 A:middle
We had a huge influx of
kids into the ecosystem

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:24.796 A:middle
with the iPod, the most
popular music playback device

00:01:24.796 --> 00:01:26.046 A:middle
in the history of man.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
And now we've got a huge
number of kids both in homes

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:32.976 A:middle
and in the schools using
our mobile devices.

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.216 A:middle
Now, it was great
when we started out,

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:38.006 A:middle
because it was a
fairly simple model.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:40.876 A:middle
Parents would buy a device
that was pretty expensive.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.586 A:middle
They would buy some
software at a store.

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:46.356 A:middle
They would put it
on their device

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.966 A:middle
and their kids would use it
in their home or classroom

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.216 A:middle
and that was pretty easy
and it was pretty safe,

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:53.856 A:middle
but it's a different world now.

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:57.416 A:middle
It's different for kids and
it's different for parents too.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
Kids are beset by a
world on the internet


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
Kids are beset by a
world on the internet

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.976 A:middle
where there are millions
of strangers

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:05.606 A:middle
out there they can have
instantaneous contact

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:08.406 A:middle
with both other kids
and grownups.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.936 A:middle
And there's also billions
of dollars of marketing

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:16.236 A:middle
and merchandising that are aimed
at those kids and that's why

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.136 A:middle
around the world
people are working

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.196 A:middle
on legislation to protect kids.

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:24.926 A:middle
Now, we've been doing some
things gradually through OS X

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:29.336 A:middle
and through iOS to give
parents and kids some protection

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.356 A:middle
in the use of technology.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:35.396 A:middle
The parental controls that
have been in OS X forever

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:43.976 A:middle
and the restrictions on iOS will
really help parents configure

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:47.246 A:middle
the device to work the way they
want it to work with their kids

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:50.006 A:middle
and as app developers you're
kind of accustomed to this.

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.126 A:middle
Sometimes as in the
previous session when you go

00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:57.196 A:middle
to use a restricted data class
it just won't be available,

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:00.036 A:middle
because there's been a parental
control set on that device.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:00.036 A:middle
because there's been a parental
control set on that device.

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:03.446 A:middle
So, you're accustomed to dealing
with that as app developers.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:07.986 A:middle
And then when we start
putting networked capabilities

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
in the hands of users we're
making some accommodations

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.286 A:middle
to do things that are
specifically directed for kids,

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:18.606 A:middle
Game Center for example.

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:21.636 A:middle
We knew that a lot of kids
would be using Game Center

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:22.946 A:middle
on their parent's devices

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
and so we let them have
their own handles regardless

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:26.506 A:middle
of their age.

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:28.686 A:middle
They're more or less anonymous.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:31.036 A:middle
We don't collect
personal information.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.666 A:middle
We don't allow chat
for Game Center handles

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.956 A:middle
for kids under 13.

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.456 A:middle
There is no ads.

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.856 A:middle
It's generic screen names.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:39.786 A:middle
There's no image sharing.

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:43.066 A:middle
The chat messages they can
use are canned messages only,

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.196 A:middle
not freeform chat.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:47.656 A:middle
So, we've created some you
know little cul-de-sacs

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.486 A:middle
of functionality
for kids under 13.

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.686 A:middle
There is a new kid's
category in the App Store

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:56.666 A:middle
that you may have heard about.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.556 A:middle
You can go in the App
Store guidelines or go

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:00.016 A:middle
to the App Store
sessions or labs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:00.016 A:middle
to the App Store
sessions or labs

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:01.506 A:middle
and learn a little
bit more about these.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:04.916 A:middle
If you're targeting your
apps to sell to the parents

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
of young kids who are going
to use them there's a couple

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.196 A:middle
of things you need to do
to get into that category.

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.786 A:middle
You have to have a
privacy policy on your page

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:18.055 A:middle
and you've got to link to that
privacy policy on your app page.

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:21.666 A:middle
You cannot have behavioral
oriented advertising.

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.566 A:middle
You can have contextual
advertising,

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:27.036 A:middle
but not behavioral oriented
advertising the tracks your kid.

00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:31.606 A:middle
You can do no tracking
across sites or across apps.

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:34.926 A:middle
The contextual ads must
be appropriate for kids

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:37.426 A:middle
and you've got to
have a parental gate

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.146 A:middle
on your app before you
get out of the app to go

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:44.846 A:middle
to In-App Purchases back to the
App Store or to any online site.

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:48.146 A:middle
So again, little
cul-de-sacs of functionality

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:50.776 A:middle
to accommodate kids
using our technology.

00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:56.046 A:middle
But there is a lot going on
in the world and a lot going

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:00.676 A:middle
on in the United States about
what technology companies,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:00.676 A:middle
on in the United States about
what technology companies,

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:03.516 A:middle
internet companies in
general have to do about kids

00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:07.606 A:middle
to give parents the safety
and control they want.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:09.856 A:middle
Generally it's about
being sensitive

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:12.556 A:middle
to the needs of parents
and kids.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:15.646 A:middle
But, some areas that
we've gotten scrutiny

00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:19.866 A:middle
and you may have gotten scrutiny
including not being clear

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.596 A:middle
about the total cost of an app.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.496 A:middle
A free app that may
cost hundreds of dollars

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
in In-App Purchases in order

00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:30.136 A:middle
to have a good play
experience is going

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:32.236 A:middle
to be considered a
little out of line.

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:33.586 A:middle
You may need to look at that.

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:36.186 A:middle
Aggressive exhortations to buy

00:05:36.186 --> 00:05:39.226 A:middle
where you are constantly
bombarded with the urge

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:42.246 A:middle
to spend money, that's not
going to be okay for some

00:05:42.246 --> 00:05:44.436 A:middle
of the regulatory
agencies and you may have

00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:45.836 A:middle
to be careful about
some of these.

00:05:46.236 --> 00:05:49.086 A:middle
You're responsible for
local law compliance.

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:51.546 A:middle
There are some principles
that you can follow.

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.256 A:middle
The British Government
has put some together.

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:54.646 A:middle
There's a link on this website.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.246 A:middle
You can go back to
the tape and read it.

00:05:56.526 --> 00:05:58.936 A:middle
There's some general principles
about dealing with kids

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:03.066 A:middle
in websites and in apps that are
really, really good to follow.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:03.066 A:middle
in websites and in apps that are
really, really good to follow.

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:06.976 A:middle
Now, at this point I want to
go off script a little bit.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:13.226 A:middle
I want you on a lot of these
slides to be thinking I'm going

00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:14.846 A:middle
to call my lawyer, okay.

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:16.646 A:middle
So, we're going to take
a practice right now.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.556 A:middle
I want you to just
think to yourself I want

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:22.196 A:middle
to call my lawyer,
one, two, three.

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:24.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I want to call my lawyer.

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:25.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, that was good.

00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:26.756 A:middle
That wasn't just
thinking to yourself.

00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:27.376 A:middle
That was allowed.

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:28.856 A:middle
I want to hear that.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.576 A:middle
Maybe we could up the volume

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:32.806 A:middle
on that a little bit
so one, two, three.

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:34.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:36.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's pretty good.

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:40.636 A:middle
Now, in the room next door I
have been told there's going

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:43.356 A:middle
to be some loud music playing
that may disturb our session.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:46.746 A:middle
And my lawyer on this
project is in that room.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:51.566 A:middle
I want her to hear this okay,
so loud enough for Russian Hill

00:06:51.566 --> 00:06:53.756 A:middle
to hear, one, two, three.

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:55.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:06:55.886 --> 00:06:56.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Aw, that's awesome people.

00:06:56.956 --> 00:06:57.636 A:middle
Okay, thanks.

00:06:57.636 --> 00:06:58.266 A:middle
Remember that.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:06:59.196 A:middle
We're going to do that later.

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
The thing that's going
to affect you most

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:07.176 A:middle
as developers is the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:09.426 A:middle
of 2000, okay.

00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:12.756 A:middle
This was originally
written to focus

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:15.356 A:middle
on websites and online services.

00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:19.106 A:middle
It applies to sites
that are directed at

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:24.196 A:middle
or have actual knowledge
of use by kids under age 13

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:25.816 A:middle
and it restricts you

00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:28.086 A:middle
from collecting identifying
information

00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:29.936 A:middle
without parental consent.

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:33.586 A:middle
Pretty straightforward as
it goes as it was in 2000,

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.996 A:middle
but a lot has happened
since 2000.

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:38.096 A:middle
The way the law was
originally written was

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:40.246 A:middle
that you couldn't collect
the first or last name,

00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:43.836 A:middle
the email address or phone
number, any physical address,

00:07:43.836 --> 00:07:47.196 A:middle
street name or the name of a
city or a town, social security,

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:50.986 A:middle
user identifier, any screen
name that would have a way

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:55.206 A:middle
of contacting the kid or
information that combines

00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:56.276 A:middle
with any of those above.

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:59.556 A:middle
And it defined an
acceptable mechanism

00:07:59.836 --> 00:08:01.896 A:middle
to get parental consent.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

to get parental consent.

00:08:01.896 --> 00:08:07.476 A:middle
Well, last year in 2013,
the Federal Trade Commission

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:10.466 A:middle
in the United States revised
that act to clarify it,

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.686 A:middle
expand it a little bit and these
are the things you'll really

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:14.896 A:middle
need to careful about.

00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:17.876 A:middle
They clarified that everything
that applied to websites

00:08:17.876 --> 00:08:19.676 A:middle
in 2000 applies to mobile too.

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:23.056 A:middle
So, all of your apps
are affected.

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:26.016 A:middle
They expanded the definition
of personal information

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.166 A:middle
that requires parental consent
according the new capabilities

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.446 A:middle
of mobile devices.

00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:36.296 A:middle
So, any photo or video or sound
recording that your app makes

00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:41.606 A:middle
that could include the
child's own image is subject

00:08:41.716 --> 00:08:43.486 A:middle
to the COPPA regulations okay,

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.226 A:middle
very important for
you to know that.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.996 A:middle
Geolocation that can isolate
the kid's location to a city

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:52.926 A:middle
or town subject to COPPA
regulations, any screen name

00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:54.956 A:middle
or identifier that can
be used for contact,

00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:58.056 A:middle
that's pretty much the same
or a persistent identifier

00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:00.746 A:middle
that identifies them
across sites or services.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:00.746 A:middle
that identifies them
across sites or services.

00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:05.186 A:middle
If you're using this information
solely within your app

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.806 A:middle
and solely for internal
functionality

00:09:07.806 --> 00:09:09.906 A:middle
to your app, that's okay.

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:13.146 A:middle
But, if it goes up on a website,
if it goes outside your app,

00:09:13.146 --> 00:09:15.156 A:middle
if you're using it
for purposes other

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:18.506 A:middle
than just making your app
work then you're subject

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:19.706 A:middle
to the requirements

00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:22.916 A:middle
of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act.

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:27.866 A:middle
And there are some requirements
of that and we're going

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:29.176 A:middle
to go into that later.

00:09:29.876 --> 00:09:32.986 A:middle
Now, kids under 13
who are subject

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:35.316 A:middle
to the COPPA law have Apple IDs.

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:36.566 A:middle
They have it in two ways.

00:09:37.436 --> 00:09:39.746 A:middle
The first is an Apple
ID for Students Program

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:41.606 A:middle
and this is what we
rolled out last year.

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:45.666 A:middle
It's a program that gets
verified parental consent

00:09:45.666 --> 00:09:48.466 A:middle
through the COPPA law
through schools, okay.

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:51.266 A:middle
We've rolled it out in several
large school districts starting

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:52.826 A:middle
last year and going
into this year

00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:57.646 A:middle
and they're full-fledged Apple
IDs for iCloud and iTunes.

00:09:57.646 --> 00:09:59.926 A:middle
They're not these
Game Center accounts.

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:01.016 A:middle
They're not kid accounts.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:01.016 A:middle
They're not kid accounts.

00:10:01.046 --> 00:10:02.076 A:middle
They're not junior accounts.

00:10:02.446 --> 00:10:03.956 A:middle
They really are full
accounts, okay.

00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:07.486 A:middle
There are a couple of little
things we've applied to them.

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:10.566 A:middle
Students do not receive
marketing materials from Apple.

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.476 A:middle
That box is implicitly checked

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:14.026 A:middle
to not receive marketing
materials

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:17.686 A:middle
and the limit ad tracking
switch is automatically set

00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:19.556 A:middle
for accounts for kids under 13.

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:23.656 A:middle
Now, this is really only
for you know a few tens

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
of thousands of kids now.

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.416 A:middle
And of course, we're
going to expand

00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:28.436 A:middle
that in more school districts.

00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:31.326 A:middle
But, what we announced
Monday is much bigger

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:33.156 A:middle
and that's Family Sharing.

00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:38.376 A:middle
Family Sharing is a method to
get verifiable parental consent

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:43.166 A:middle
under the COPPA law for any
family in the U.S. and in fact,

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:47.236 A:middle
we're using the same
mechanism worldwide for parents

00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:50.206 A:middle
to create Apple IDs
for young kids.

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:54.076 A:middle
It integrates with the Ask
to Buy feature that you saw

00:10:54.076 --> 00:10:57.776 A:middle
on Monday so that parents
can see and approve

00:10:57.776 --> 00:10:59.666 A:middle
of purchases by their kids.

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:03.006 A:middle
Once again, just like the
student IDs they're full-fledged


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:03.006 A:middle
Once again, just like the
student IDs they're full-fledged

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:05.666 A:middle
Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.706 A:middle
The same switches are set, no
marketing and no ad tracking

00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:11.236 A:middle
and the verified
parental consent is set

00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.426 A:middle
up by a special mechanism.

00:11:12.426 --> 00:11:16.316 A:middle
So it's a way for us to get
the parents to create accounts

00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:20.146 A:middle
for kids under 13 and then
bring them into the family,

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:22.346 A:middle
let them share existing
purchases

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:23.546 A:middle
and make new purchases.

00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:25.916 A:middle
Let me walk you a little bit

00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:28.146 A:middle
through how the whole Family
Sharing program works,

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.886 A:middle
because that'll give you
a good background for it.

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:33.906 A:middle
You start with the person
who has a payment method

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:38.436 A:middle
and an Apple ID who decides
to be a family organizer.

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:40.856 A:middle
And the family organizer can add

00:11:40.856 --> 00:11:45.576 A:middle
or invite other existing
accounts into the family

00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:47.726 A:middle
and share their payment method

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:51.776 A:middle
and share their existing
purchases with them.

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:55.986 A:middle
They can also create new
accounts for kids under 13

00:11:56.986 --> 00:11:58.276 A:middle
and create a family circle.

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
That can be up to
six accounts total.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
That can be up to
six accounts total.

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:03.476 A:middle
And the requirement is
that during the life

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:05.206 A:middle
of the family all
the accounts have

00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:08.656 A:middle
to use the family
organizer's payment method

00:12:08.656 --> 00:12:10.756 A:middle
or credit card, okay.

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:14.696 A:middle
The way Purchase Sharing works
is that you have this bucket

00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
of purchases that you've made
and that is made available

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:20.596 A:middle
to everybody in your family.

00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:24.596 A:middle
They can see all of your
movies, books and apps that--

00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:26.216 A:middle
and songs that you
have purchased.

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.846 A:middle
They can pick one out of your
purchases and re-download it

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:32.706 A:middle
to their device as if it was
in their purchase history.

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:34.236 A:middle
It's not their title now.

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:35.836 A:middle
It doesn't show up in
their purchase history.

00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:37.746 A:middle
It's still yours and then

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:41.056 A:middle
if you leave the family they
lose the rights to that title.

00:12:41.676 --> 00:12:45.126 A:middle
And then the Ask to Buy
capability is really cool.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:49.126 A:middle
If one of your family members
has the Ask to Buy switch turned

00:12:49.126 --> 00:12:51.566 A:middle
on and is shopping in any
of the stores and wants

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:55.006 A:middle
to purchase something at time

00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:59.406 A:middle
of purchase request a
notification is sent

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:03.366 A:middle
to the organizer and other
parents in the family saying


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:03.366 A:middle
to the organizer and other
parents in the family saying

00:13:03.536 --> 00:13:05.466 A:middle
that this person wants
to buy this product

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:06.776 A:middle
with a link to the product page.

00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:09.126 A:middle
And the organizer
and the parents

00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:13.846 A:middle
or guardians get the option to
approve or deny that request

00:13:15.196 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
and on approval they
complete that purchase.

00:13:18.996 --> 00:13:22.486 A:middle
Now, this is going to affect the
way your In-App Purchases work,

00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:26.236 A:middle
because there may be a
long time between the time

00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:29.276 A:middle
when the user taps the in
app purchase buy button

00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:33.396 A:middle
and when the parent
actually sees it, taps okay,

00:13:33.716 --> 00:13:35.706 A:middle
the request comes back
and they get to buy that.

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:39.516 A:middle
Go back and look at James
Wilson's optimizing StoreKit

00:13:39.516 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
transaction session.

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
There was one given yesterday

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:44.076 A:middle
and he's reprising
it tomorrow morning.

00:13:44.446 --> 00:13:46.706 A:middle
See that. He's got some
great tips for how to deal

00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:49.486 A:middle
with that in your app.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.536 A:middle
So, given all of that what
does this mean to you?

00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:55.206 A:middle
What does regulatory
environment mean to you?

00:13:55.206 --> 00:13:57.706 A:middle
What do the new under
13 accounts mean to you?

00:13:57.966 --> 00:14:01.606 A:middle
What is Ask to Buy and
Family Sharing mean to you?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.966 --> 00:14:01.606 A:middle
What is Ask to Buy and
Family Sharing mean to you?

00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:05.736 A:middle
And at this time I
want you to say--

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:08.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:14:08.746 --> 00:14:10.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh come on, come on,
come on, one, two, three.

00:14:10.586 --> 00:14:12.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:16.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Okay, only your lawyer
can tell you what this means

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:19.536 A:middle
to you in the context of
your app and your company.

00:14:19.996 --> 00:14:21.626 A:middle
But, the thing you got
to know is that kids

00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:25.006 A:middle
under 13 may be buying,
selling, buying,

00:14:25.006 --> 00:14:26.896 A:middle
sharing and using your apps.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:32.106 A:middle
So, you've got to tell whether
your apps are directed at kids

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:36.966 A:middle
under 13 or whether you have
specific knowledge that kids

00:14:36.966 --> 00:14:38.336 A:middle
under 13 are using your apps.

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:42.176 A:middle
If you've got a general-purpose
app like a word processor

00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:45.526 A:middle
or a to do list reminder
you're not targeted at kids.

00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:47.946 A:middle
You're not in the kid's
section of the store.

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:52.206 A:middle
You don't ask their age
anywhere, you're probably okay

00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:55.616 A:middle
under the COPPA law, which only
affects things that are directed

00:14:55.616 --> 00:14:59.146 A:middle
at or you have actual
knowledge of the user's age.

00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:01.936 A:middle
Again, you have to consult
your lawyer in order


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:01.936 A:middle
Again, you have to consult
your lawyer in order

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:05.006 A:middle
to know whether you do or do
not follow-- fall under the law.

00:15:05.466 --> 00:15:08.586 A:middle
But, typically if you have a
general purpose app you don't

00:15:08.586 --> 00:15:10.776 A:middle
market to kids, you're
not in the kid's section,

00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.196 A:middle
you don't know the age then
you don't have to worry

00:15:14.196 --> 00:15:16.676 A:middle
about COPPA conformance
specifically.

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:22.056 A:middle
But, if your app is directed
at kids, which it probably is

00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:26.246 A:middle
if you're in this room, you
have some implementation choices

00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:30.756 A:middle
to either avoid requirements
for conformance with COPPA

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:33.156 A:middle
or to conform with
the COPPA law.

00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:35.126 A:middle
And there three basic
approaches and I'm going

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:36.316 A:middle
to walk you through them now.

00:15:36.796 --> 00:15:39.416 A:middle
You can either avoid
doing the things

00:15:39.416 --> 00:15:41.106 A:middle
that subject you to
COPPA regulation.

00:15:41.276 --> 00:15:42.236 A:middle
Just stay out of it.

00:15:42.396 --> 00:15:44.646 A:middle
Do not collect personally
identifying information.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.896 A:middle
It's a great alternative
or you can choose

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:51.036 A:middle
to collect the information
of how old the user is

00:15:51.396 --> 00:15:55.226 A:middle
and present a forked experience,
different experiences for kids

00:15:55.226 --> 00:16:00.976 A:middle
over 13 and under 13, disable
the personally identifying


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:55.226 --> 00:16:00.976 A:middle
over 13 and under 13, disable
the personally identifying

00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:03.756 A:middle
information experience
for the kids under 13.

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:05.896 A:middle
That's a viable choice.

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.346 A:middle
That's a good choice
for you to make.

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:13.326 A:middle
Or you can if you're all about
that information, if you're all

00:16:13.326 --> 00:16:15.536 A:middle
about video, if you're all
about chat, if you're all

00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:19.836 A:middle
about sharing stuff, you really
need to address kids under 13

00:16:19.936 --> 00:16:23.236 A:middle
with the full features of
your application then you have

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:27.046 A:middle
to get verifiable parental
consent of the use--

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:30.796 A:middle
from the user's parents before
you can proceed with the app

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:32.716 A:middle
and we'll lead you through
some steps to do that.

00:16:34.996 --> 00:16:39.146 A:middle
So, let's look at the first
alternative, avoid it.

00:16:40.106 --> 00:16:42.996 A:middle
This is pretty easy
for most apps.

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:45.836 A:middle
Don't collect personally
identifying information.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.476 A:middle
Don't show behaviorally
targeted ads,

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:49.886 A:middle
although contextual
ads are fine.

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:52.006 A:middle
Don't support photos.

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.426 A:middle
Don't support voice recording.

00:16:54.836 --> 00:16:56.526 A:middle
Don't support social networking.

00:16:56.986 --> 00:16:59.136 A:middle
Don't support finding
your location.

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
Don't support your
own push notifications


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
Don't support your
own push notifications

00:17:02.546 --> 00:17:04.646 A:middle
or any other COPPA
regulated functionality.

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:07.506 A:middle
You can go a long way
actually without doing those

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:09.846 A:middle
if that's what your app is
about, if it's a simple game

00:17:09.846 --> 00:17:11.486 A:middle
or a general purpose
application.

00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:15.796 A:middle
Ask to Buy does not make
you COPPA compliant.

00:17:15.796 --> 00:17:18.006 A:middle
Getting the parental
permission to purchase

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:22.066 A:middle
and download the game is
not COPPA compliant parental

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:23.796 A:middle
notification and consent

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.246 A:middle
to collect personally
identifying information.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:29.186 A:middle
So, just because the kid bought
your game through Ask to Buy

00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:30.726 A:middle
that doesn't let
you off the hook.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:34.486 A:middle
If you limit yourself to
what Game Center does you're

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:38.526 A:middle
generally good, but you got to
check your app and make sure

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:40.216 A:middle
that you're not doing
any of these things.

00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:44.936 A:middle
If you saw the previous
presentation then you know

00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:47.426 A:middle
that there are some
protected data classes

00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:50.196 A:middle
in both platforms, iOS and OS X.

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:53.886 A:middle
If you look at those protected
data classes this gives you a

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:56.166 A:middle
really good idea of
whether you're going

00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:58.346 A:middle
to be generally compliant
with COPPA or not.

00:17:58.576 --> 00:18:03.866 A:middle
If you're using location or
contacts or photos or microphone


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.576 --> 00:18:03.866 A:middle
If you're using location or
contacts or photos or microphone

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:06.956 A:middle
or the worldwide
or camera or social

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:12.326 A:middle
or HealthKit you are subject to
COPPA regulations and you need

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:13.926 A:middle
to be careful about
that, even Bluetooth,

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.266 A:middle
because Bluetooth has
a persistent identifier

00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:20.346 A:middle
that can be tracked across
devices and across locales

00:18:20.346 --> 00:18:23.626 A:middle
and so even use of Bluetooth
makes you subject to COPPA.

00:18:24.156 --> 00:18:27.266 A:middle
So, let me show you some demos

00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:32.946 A:middle
of some applications
that are PII free.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:40.916 A:middle
This one is called Bonsai Slice.

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:45.716 A:middle
It's a game where you
swack things with swords.

00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:47.576 A:middle
Again, you start it up.

00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:51.306 A:middle
There's not much to do
except tap to begin.

00:18:52.926 --> 00:18:57.016 A:middle
There's no particular login
or identification of yourself

00:18:57.016 --> 00:19:00.976 A:middle
or any setup and you can just
go right into playing the game.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.016 --> 00:19:00.976 A:middle
or any setup and you can just
go right into playing the game.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:06.046 A:middle
[ Game sounds ]

00:19:06.546 --> 00:19:08.926 A:middle
So, there we go.

00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:16.276 A:middle
I think that's enough
game demo for that.

00:19:17.546 --> 00:19:19.446 A:middle
So, that is the first approach,

00:19:19.446 --> 00:19:22.306 A:middle
which is just don't do
it and you'll be fine.

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:24.056 A:middle
So, if you've got a
general purpose app

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:25.666 A:middle
or you've got a kid oriented app

00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:28.316 A:middle
that doesn't collect any
personally identifying

00:19:28.316 --> 00:19:29.746 A:middle
information you're fine.

00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:30.316 A:middle
You're in the clear.

00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:35.006 A:middle
The second approach is
to have an age screen

00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:38.356 A:middle
so you can tell whether
your user is under 13.

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:42.356 A:middle
And then if they're over 13 you
can collect PII and if they're

00:19:42.356 --> 00:19:45.996 A:middle
under 13 you just turn
off those features, okay.

00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:48.536 A:middle
It's pretty straightforward
to do.

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.906 A:middle
One of the interesting
things is well,

00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:53.316 A:middle
isn't their age personally
identifying information

00:19:53.316 --> 00:19:54.676 A:middle
and the answer is no.

00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:55.256 A:middle
That's not.

00:19:55.346 --> 00:19:58.316 A:middle
You can ask their age and
you can record their age

00:19:58.486 --> 00:19:59.956 A:middle
so you don't have
to ask every time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
If fact, we recommend that
what you do is you ask

00:20:03.656 --> 00:20:04.596 A:middle
on first launch.

00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:07.036 A:middle
You record the age

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:11.466 A:middle
in per account iCloud
preferences store.

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:14.806 A:middle
And so when that user is logged
into iCloud, because you're

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:17.586 A:middle
under 13 users are all
going to be iCloud users.

00:20:18.246 --> 00:20:22.816 A:middle
Anytime your app launches and
you read that recorded age

00:20:22.816 --> 00:20:27.176 A:middle
of over or under 13 from their
per app iCloud preferences you

00:20:27.176 --> 00:20:29.996 A:middle
know whether this user's under
13 or not and you don't have

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.716 A:middle
to ask again and
you can continue

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:32.726 A:middle
to tailor the preference--

00:20:32.926 --> 00:20:34.896 A:middle
continue to tailor
the experience

00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:36.746 A:middle
for that under 13 user.

00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:42.156 A:middle
If they're under 13
you can't just exit.

00:20:42.546 --> 00:20:44.256 A:middle
That's not appropriate.

00:20:44.626 --> 00:20:47.536 A:middle
That is, have an app that
people can buy or download

00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:49.426 A:middle
and then have them
input their age

00:20:49.426 --> 00:20:51.156 A:middle
and then tell them,
oh you're too young.

00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:53.786 A:middle
Your app will be rejected
from the store if you do that.

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:57.236 A:middle
If you have an age gate and
you have different behaviors

00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:59.636 A:middle
for above and under 13 you have

00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:04.176 A:middle
to have a pretty unified
valuable experience


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:04.176 A:middle
to have a pretty unified
valuable experience

00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:05.006 A:middle
for under 13.

00:21:05.006 --> 00:21:07.196 A:middle
You can't just quit and
you can't have a really,

00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:08.696 A:middle
really crippled version
of the app.

00:21:08.696 --> 00:21:09.676 A:middle
It's got to be useful.

00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:10.446 A:middle
It's got to be fun.

00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:12.756 A:middle
But, you can omit
certain features

00:21:12.756 --> 00:21:15.346 A:middle
like you know like chat.

00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:18.746 A:middle
You can have chat in the over
13 and not have chat in the

00:21:18.746 --> 00:21:22.366 A:middle
under 13 as part of your
gameplay, for example.

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:25.506 A:middle
Once again, you should be
thinking one, two, three.

00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:27.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:21:27.346 --> 00:21:28.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:31.816 A:middle
And you might want to
have a parental gate too.

00:21:31.816 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
Parental gates are something
we recommend for applications

00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:37.846 A:middle
that are in the kid's store
where you know there is the

00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:39.646 A:middle
under 13s where you
got to do one thing.

00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:44.576 A:middle
There's 13 through you know
grownups where you can anything.

00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:50.166 A:middle
And then over grownups
for terms and conditions

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:51.596 A:middle
for buying additional stuff

00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:52.956 A:middle
or if you're a parent
you might want

00:21:52.956 --> 00:21:54.676 A:middle
to have a special
control for that.

00:21:55.116 --> 00:22:00.926 A:middle
So, I'm going to go through
some of the apps that do that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:55.116 --> 00:22:00.926 A:middle
So, I'm going to go through
some of the apps that do that.

00:22:01.006 --> 00:22:06.626 A:middle
This is Toca Town, another great
immersive environment for kids.

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:09.836 A:middle
You can tell from the start
that this is targeted at kids

00:22:10.026 --> 00:22:12.226 A:middle
and it's likely to
have kids under 13.

00:22:12.486 --> 00:22:15.246 A:middle
So, it's the kind of thing
that would be subject.

00:22:15.596 --> 00:22:18.676 A:middle
And it's got a parental
age screen.

00:22:18.866 --> 00:22:21.856 A:middle
If you see the for parents
way up here in the corner,

00:22:22.526 --> 00:22:24.636 A:middle
when you tap that they ask you

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:28.056 A:middle
with a very simple challenge
what year were you born in.

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:36.156 A:middle
And that's-- this is asking
you for both under or over 13

00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:39.066 A:middle
or also for parental
information.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.496 A:middle
If you enter a date
that is old enough

00:22:41.816 --> 00:22:47.026 A:middle
to be a parent then you can
go to the license agreement.

00:22:47.026 --> 00:22:48.776 A:middle
You can go to additional
purchases.

00:22:48.776 --> 00:22:51.846 A:middle
You can go to off app websites.

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:54.656 A:middle
This is the kind of thing
that is required to be

00:22:54.656 --> 00:22:56.926 A:middle
in the App Store in
the kid's section.

00:22:57.416 --> 00:23:03.506 A:middle
And finally here's Fraggle
Rock from Jim Henson.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.416 --> 00:23:03.506 A:middle
And finally here's Fraggle
Rock from Jim Henson.

00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:05.746 A:middle
This is just another mechanism

00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:08.046 A:middle
that you can use to
ask the kid's age.

00:23:08.576 --> 00:23:10.356 A:middle
You start up, there's info.

00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:12.896 A:middle
It's the same kind of thing.

00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:15.506 A:middle
This is parental info
yet they're asking

00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:20.746 A:middle
for the full parental,
full age information here,

00:23:20.976 --> 00:23:22.246 A:middle
month, day, year.

00:23:22.626 --> 00:23:24.906 A:middle
So, you can have
a just the year.

00:23:25.106 --> 00:23:28.076 A:middle
You can have it just the age or
you can have a full birthdate.

00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:30.856 A:middle
Any one of those input
methods is sufficient

00:23:31.186 --> 00:23:35.606 A:middle
to ask whether the kid
is over or under 13.

00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:39.726 A:middle
Now, remember that that is only

00:23:39.966 --> 00:23:42.706 A:middle
for verifying whether
you can collect PII

00:23:43.066 --> 00:23:44.096 A:middle
or cannot collect PII.

00:23:45.406 --> 00:23:48.196 A:middle
Knowing the, knowing
that a parent has--

00:23:48.196 --> 00:23:50.776 A:middle
knowing that the age is
sufficiently old enough

00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:53.816 A:middle
to be a parent is
really not enough

00:23:53.956 --> 00:23:55.546 A:middle
for verified parental consent.

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:57.546 A:middle
That's our third category.

00:23:58.466 --> 00:24:03.896 A:middle
You can instead of having an
application that doesn't apply


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.466 --> 00:24:03.896 A:middle
You can instead of having an
application that doesn't apply

00:24:03.896 --> 00:24:05.126 A:middle
or having an application

00:24:05.126 --> 00:24:08.166 A:middle
where you have forked behaviors
you can have an application

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:12.456 A:middle
that always uses the camera,
always uses the microphone,

00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.856 A:middle
always uses chat and
social networking,

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.906 A:middle
uses location services,
goes the whole way.

00:24:18.216 --> 00:24:20.486 A:middle
You can do that for
kids of all ages

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:24.306 A:middle
if you have verified
parental consent.

00:24:24.306 --> 00:24:28.496 A:middle
And that turns out to be kind of
hard to do, because parents have

00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:32.826 A:middle
to consent explicitly
for your app.

00:24:33.286 --> 00:24:36.796 A:middle
Parental consent that Apple
has received for the kids

00:24:36.796 --> 00:24:40.096 A:middle
to use the device, we
cannot delegate that to you,

00:24:40.186 --> 00:24:41.886 A:middle
because we don't know
what your app is doing.

00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:46.296 A:middle
You must ask the parent to
have an explicit consent to use

00:24:46.296 --> 00:24:51.766 A:middle
that app for that kit and that's
a lot of work on your part.

00:24:51.766 --> 00:24:53.936 A:middle
It's the same rule, you know
if you've got a website,

00:24:53.936 --> 00:24:57.106 A:middle
if you've been dealing
with this under the--

00:24:57.106 --> 00:24:59.586 A:middle
since 2000 on a website
it's the same rules.

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:02.306 A:middle
So, it's pretty easy if
you've already got a website.

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:02.306 A:middle
So, it's pretty easy if
you've already got a website.

00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:07.576 A:middle
In fact, many apps just simply
direct the kids to the website

00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:10.126 A:middle
to go through the COPPA
process before they can proceed.

00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:12.416 A:middle
There are several
ways to do this.

00:25:12.576 --> 00:25:13.996 A:middle
You can pick the one
that's right for you,

00:25:14.366 --> 00:25:15.316 A:middle
talk to your lawyer about it.

00:25:15.796 --> 00:25:19.336 A:middle
And a simple parental gate of
the kind that you need to be

00:25:19.336 --> 00:25:22.806 A:middle
in app-- kids section of the
App Store that is not sufficient

00:25:23.136 --> 00:25:25.586 A:middle
for COPPA verifiable
parental consent.

00:25:27.396 --> 00:25:29.386 A:middle
Once you get verifiable,

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:32.336 A:middle
verified parental
consent it's not over.

00:25:32.506 --> 00:25:37.336 A:middle
Some of the requirements of
collecting PII are that you have

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:42.566 A:middle
to display that PII and
allow parents to review it

00:25:42.566 --> 00:25:44.206 A:middle
and delete it on demand.

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:46.466 A:middle
You, the parents need to be able

00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:48.396 A:middle
to stop the collection
going forward.

00:25:48.806 --> 00:25:52.076 A:middle
You have to keep that
information reasonably secure

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:53.806 A:middle
to be able to demonstrate
to the FTC

00:25:53.806 --> 00:25:56.396 A:middle
that you are keeping
it secure and you need

00:25:56.396 --> 00:25:59.006 A:middle
to delete the information
when you no longer need it.

00:25:59.006 --> 00:26:01.616 A:middle
You can't amass vast data bases


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.006 --> 00:26:01.616 A:middle
You can't amass vast data bases

00:26:01.876 --> 00:26:03.466 A:middle
of private information
about kids.

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:07.106 A:middle
Now I don't have a
lot of good examples

00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:13.926 A:middle
of what on-device verified
parental consent is mainly

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.996 A:middle
because this is kind
of new and not a lot

00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:18.056 A:middle
of apps are doing this.

00:26:18.336 --> 00:26:21.936 A:middle
The traditional way of doing it
if you just look at a website

00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:25.096 A:middle
like Neopets this is
the traditional way

00:26:25.096 --> 00:26:29.476 A:middle
of getting verified parental
consent is a webpage with a lot

00:26:29.476 --> 00:26:35.276 A:middle
of legal contract and then
a form that you print.

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:42.326 A:middle
Please print legibly and then
you fax it in to the company.

00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:45.386 A:middle
This is what websites
traditionally do before you

00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:46.246 A:middle
create an account.

00:26:46.836 --> 00:26:49.426 A:middle
And in the app world,
for example,

00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:52.926 A:middle
there is the great
family app called life 360

00:26:53.276 --> 00:26:57.206 A:middle
which is a great way for parents
to communicate with their kids.

00:26:57.206 --> 00:26:58.466 A:middle
It sets up chat.

00:26:58.466 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
It sets up location services.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.466 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
It sets up location services.

00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:06.976 A:middle
It is a fully featured family
management app and it's going

00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:11.346 A:middle
to have kids under 13
and what they do is you--

00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:13.816 A:middle
they send you to the
app to create accounts

00:27:14.356 --> 00:27:17.066 A:middle
and they send you to the
website to create accounts.

00:27:17.306 --> 00:27:22.496 A:middle
And the website just has a
PDF that you fill in, you sign

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:24.716 A:middle
and you mail or fax
in to the company,

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.736 A:middle
because that's the
state of the art.

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:30.016 A:middle
We can do better than this and
we want to do better than this.

00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:32.376 A:middle
We really want to give
parents a great way

00:27:32.786 --> 00:27:35.936 A:middle
of delivering verifiable
parental consent

00:27:35.936 --> 00:27:38.596 A:middle
in a way that's acceptable to
the Federal Trade Commission.

00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:40.926 A:middle
Here's an example of
a good start at it.

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:42.126 A:middle
Here's an app called DIY.

00:27:42.206 --> 00:27:46.806 A:middle
When you start it takes you

00:27:46.806 --> 00:27:51.406 A:middle
through some setup
screens of what it does.

00:27:52.496 --> 00:27:57.076 A:middle
You pick an avatar and
then it has an age slider

00:27:57.076 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
and this is kind of like
the age slider that you saw


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.076 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
and this is kind of like
the age slider that you saw

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:03.216 A:middle
in the previous category for
deciding whether to turn on

00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:05.476 A:middle
or turn off capabilities.

00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:08.326 A:middle
And notice that if I'm 14

00:28:08.846 --> 00:28:13.596 A:middle
and I pick a nickname then I
can enter my email and password

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:16.126 A:middle
to create an account;
very straightforward.

00:28:18.186 --> 00:28:26.376 A:middle
But, if I set an age under 13
notice that interfaces change.

00:28:26.376 --> 00:28:29.496 A:middle
It doesn't ask me for
my password and email.

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:31.856 A:middle
It asks for my parents email

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:36.416 A:middle
and it sends my parents
an invitation

00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:39.686 A:middle
that they must approve before I
can go further with an account

00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:42.296 A:middle
and that does the email,

00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:44.736 A:middle
that does the parental
consent process that they have

00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:45.886 A:middle
to review the agreement.

00:28:45.886 --> 00:28:46.766 A:middle
They have to sign it.

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:47.746 A:middle
They have to send it in.

00:28:48.066 --> 00:28:49.116 A:middle
That's what you need to do

00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:50.906 A:middle
under the COPPA law
in order to do that.

00:28:51.636 --> 00:28:56.096 A:middle
So, those are the ways
that you can get verified

00:28:56.096 --> 00:28:57.026 A:middle
parental consent.

00:28:57.346 --> 00:29:03.036 A:middle
Now this applies primarily in
the United States of America


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.346 --> 00:29:03.036 A:middle
Now this applies primarily in
the United States of America

00:29:03.246 --> 00:29:06.286 A:middle
and the territories that are
subject to the COPPA law.

00:29:06.816 --> 00:29:09.476 A:middle
That is not your whole market.

00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:11.906 A:middle
And the good news is
that in most of the rest

00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:15.106 A:middle
of the world there
aren't laws like COPPA.

00:29:15.436 --> 00:29:17.476 A:middle
But, they're coming and many

00:29:17.476 --> 00:29:20.036 A:middle
of them will be modeled
on the U.S. law.

00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.176 A:middle
And the implementation
method we've chosen

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:25.296 A:middle
which is probably
a good idea for you

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:28.536 A:middle
to follow is what we're
doing in the U.S. we're going

00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:32.136 A:middle
to deploy everywhere because
it shows respect for kids.

00:29:32.426 --> 00:29:35.646 A:middle
It shows restraint on our
parts and it makes us adaptable

00:29:35.646 --> 00:29:39.746 A:middle
and flexible for whatever
other countries may adopt.

00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.006 A:middle
The most important
thing for you is

00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:47.936 A:middle
that ages I've been talking
about, 13 to be a kid and 18

00:29:47.936 --> 00:29:51.196 A:middle
to be able to sign a legal
contract, don't take those

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:54.726 A:middle
as hard coded values, because
they're different worldwide.

00:29:55.446 --> 00:29:59.736 A:middle
The age that COPPA applies to
in the United States is 13.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:02.576 A:middle
But other countries
have ages where are--

00:30:02.576 --> 00:30:07.156 A:middle
children's private information
is protected and that varies all

00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:11.076 A:middle
around the world from 13
up to 16 years of age.

00:30:11.286 --> 00:30:14.016 A:middle
Similarly the age at
which you can agree

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:17.616 A:middle
to a legal contract is 18,

00:30:18.106 --> 00:30:23.226 A:middle
but in other countries
it may be 19, 20 or 21.

00:30:23.226 --> 00:30:25.906 A:middle
You should tailor these
on a per country basis.

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:30.916 A:middle
Instead of hard coding 13 or
18 you can check your region

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:35.726 A:middle
at runtime using StoreKit,
just use the products response

00:30:35.726 --> 00:30:38.476 A:middle
to a products request with
your bundle identifier,

00:30:38.796 --> 00:30:42.736 A:middle
get the products response and
look at the price locale field.

00:30:42.736 --> 00:30:45.146 A:middle
And that will tell you
the locale of the store

00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:47.106 A:middle
from which your product
was bought.

00:30:47.306 --> 00:30:49.996 A:middle
And then if there are
regulations that apply

00:30:49.996 --> 00:30:53.676 A:middle
in that locale you can make
decisions on what age is based

00:30:53.676 --> 00:30:57.416 A:middle
on that locale rather than hard
coding the numbers 13 or 18.

00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:02.576 A:middle
Okay, I wonder what
you're thinking now.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:02.576 A:middle
Okay, I wonder what
you're thinking now.

00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.786 A:middle
Hmm, maybe it might be--

00:31:05.186 --> 00:31:07.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:08.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:11.026 A:middle
It's an awesome opportunity.

00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:17.276 A:middle
These are families and parents
who are loyal Apple customers

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:21.136 A:middle
and they are going to love
being able to share apps

00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:25.646 A:middle
with their kids, to watch what
apps their kids are buying

00:31:25.976 --> 00:31:28.976 A:middle
to let the kids shop in
the store by themselves

00:31:28.976 --> 00:31:30.496 A:middle
with some degree of safety;

00:31:30.676 --> 00:31:32.486 A:middle
they're going to
love this feature.

00:31:32.796 --> 00:31:36.666 A:middle
They are going-- this is really,
really going to increase the use

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.946 A:middle
of our devices among kids.

00:31:39.146 --> 00:31:42.586 A:middle
We want to make sure that
that's safe and that's legal.

00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:46.726 A:middle
If you're writing apps
for kids you should apply

00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:50.586 A:middle
to all applicable statutes
in all of the areas

00:31:50.866 --> 00:31:54.176 A:middle
where you sell your apps and
that means you need a lawyer.

00:31:54.806 --> 00:31:58.926 A:middle
Don't collect personal
information, ID, pictures,

00:31:58.926 --> 00:32:02.026 A:middle
sounds or locations at
all if you can avoid it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.926 --> 00:32:02.026 A:middle
sounds or locations at
all if you can avoid it

00:32:02.286 --> 00:32:04.126 A:middle
and then you'll avoid
a lot of hassle.

00:32:04.636 --> 00:32:07.526 A:middle
If that's what your app is
about then you can choose either

00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:11.206 A:middle
to have a forked experience
based on asking the kid's age

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:15.046 A:middle
and at that point you might
as well fork for younger kids,

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:18.566 A:middle
older kids and parents in
order to be in the app store.

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:20.296 A:middle
That's a really,
really good idea.

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:25.276 A:middle
Or if you really
need kids under 13

00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:28.846 A:middle
and you need personally
identifiable information,

00:32:29.106 --> 00:32:33.406 A:middle
then what you need to do is
go the FTC codified verifiable

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.386 A:middle
parental consent process.

00:32:35.696 --> 00:32:37.616 A:middle
Get the parent's
signature on a piece

00:32:37.616 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
of paper before you
can allow the kid,

00:32:39.986 --> 00:32:41.376 A:middle
before you can allow your app

00:32:41.676 --> 00:32:44.086 A:middle
to collect personally
identifying information

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:44.936 A:middle
from the kid.

00:32:45.376 --> 00:32:48.626 A:middle
Do the same thing worldwide,
it'll be a lot more convenient

00:32:48.626 --> 00:32:51.306 A:middle
and it'll be a lot more
consistent and prepare you

00:32:51.306 --> 00:32:52.936 A:middle
for what's going to
happen in the future.

00:32:53.846 --> 00:32:55.796 A:middle
Here's some resources
that you can deal with.

00:32:56.366 --> 00:33:00.886 A:middle
There's a Safe Harbor Program
where there are organizations


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:56.366 --> 00:33:00.886 A:middle
There's a Safe Harbor Program
where there are organizations

00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:06.796 A:middle
that you can go to, to
let them help you set

00:33:06.796 --> 00:33:07.996 A:middle
up accounts for kids.

00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:10.426 A:middle
Federal Trade Commission
has a whole list

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:12.216 A:middle
of these safe harbor
organizations.

00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
It's a really, really good
place to go to talk to people,

00:33:18.276 --> 00:33:20.866 A:middle
consult with them and use some

00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:22.606 A:middle
of their services
to be safe for kids.

00:33:23.026 --> 00:33:25.386 A:middle
Another good organization
is Moms with Apps.

00:33:25.386 --> 00:33:27.976 A:middle
Moms with Apps has a lot
of expertise in this area.

00:33:28.446 --> 00:33:31.566 A:middle
And you can go to the Moms
with Apps websites to see some

00:33:31.566 --> 00:33:33.956 A:middle
of examples of apps
that deal with kids

00:33:33.956 --> 00:33:35.366 A:middle
in a really, really
great manner.

00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:40.506 A:middle
There's always our Technology
Evangelist, Paul Danbold

00:33:40.976 --> 00:33:42.986 A:middle
and developer forums; lots

00:33:42.986 --> 00:33:44.846 A:middle
of developer forums
on apps for kids.

00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:47.376 A:middle
Related sessions,
since it's late

00:33:47.376 --> 00:33:49.406 A:middle
in the week there aren't
too many coming up.

00:33:49.406 --> 00:33:51.326 A:middle
The session right
before this on Security

00:33:51.326 --> 00:33:54.246 A:middle
and Privacy is a really good
one to go back to the films on.

00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:59.546 A:middle
Also to the Designing a Great
In-App Purchase Experience

00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:00.816 A:middle
that Rachel Roth gave.

00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:00.816 A:middle
that Rachel Roth gave.

00:34:00.816 --> 00:34:02.596 A:middle
That is a heck of
a presentation.

00:34:02.596 --> 00:34:04.526 A:middle
You ought to go to
the tape and see that.

00:34:04.956 --> 00:34:06.886 A:middle
And then Optimizing
In-App Purchases,

00:34:06.886 --> 00:34:09.886 A:middle
that's the one I mentioned with
James Wilson telling you how

00:34:09.886 --> 00:34:13.516 A:middle
to handle the scenario where a
kid asks for an in-app purchase,

00:34:13.856 --> 00:34:17.766 A:middle
asks to buy his own and
their parent is going

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:20.126 A:middle
to be two hours before
they click the switch

00:34:20.126 --> 00:34:23.306 A:middle
and let the kid get those coins
that they needed in the game.

00:34:23.306 --> 00:34:25.176 A:middle
I really appreciate
you being here today.

00:34:25.176 --> 00:34:27.466 A:middle
I hope you develop
great apps for kids.

00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:30.266 A:middle
We want to have a lot of
apps for kids available

00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:34.376 A:middle
for Family Sharing when Family
Sharing opens up, when iOS 8

00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:38.025 A:middle
and OS X Yosemite are available.

00:34:38.025 --> 00:34:40.116 A:middle
And I really look forward
to seeing you in the store.

00:34:40.196 --> 00:34:41.275 A:middle
Thank you very much everybody.

00:34:42.016 --> 00:34:44.000 A:middle
