&gt;&gt; Good morning everybody.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.916 A:middle
Welcome to Prototyping.

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:19.516 A:middle
I'm Jeff Bernstein.

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:22.496 A:middle
I brought along Linda
Dong, Julian Missig

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.716 A:middle
and Mark Hauenstein
from the team.

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:26.346 A:middle
So who is this session
for today?

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:29.026 A:middle
Well, it's for developers
at companies.

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:31.646 A:middle
Show of hands.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:32.286 A:middle
Excellent.

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:33.456 A:middle
To be expected.

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:35.226 A:middle
Solo developers.

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:37.196 A:middle
All right.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.386 A:middle
People who don't
code at all, anyone?

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:42.936 A:middle
All right, great.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:43.976 A:middle
Very brave of you.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:48.446 A:middle
And designers, designers?

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:50.746 A:middle
Yeah, all right.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.166 A:middle
And management types?

00:00:57.406 --> 00:00:58.646 A:middle
Sort out you guys, yeah.

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:05.706 A:middle
So our plan today: We're going
to design and prototype an app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:05.706 A:middle
So our plan today: We're going
to design and prototype an app.

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:08.366 A:middle
We're going to go through
the steps we would go

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.556 A:middle
through to try something out.

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:12.276 A:middle
And we're going to
show a variety

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:13.776 A:middle
of different prototyping
methods.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.186 A:middle
All of this is going
to be with a focus

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:21.246 A:middle
on prototyping an experience,
not trying out an API or testing

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.036 A:middle
out some kind of
technical feasibility.

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:26.206 A:middle
So who are we?

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:29.736 A:middle
Who are we to come here and
tell you how to make your apps?

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.506 A:middle
Oh we're a small
secret team at Apple.

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:34.936 A:middle
We work across all
of Apple's products.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:39.066 A:middle
We explore what new
interfaces mean to our devices,

operating system
and applications.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.186 A:middle
And we do this by making
interactive prototypes every

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:51.066 A:middle
day, sometimes 24 hours a day.

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.146 A:middle
So today, you're all very lucky.

00:01:54.716 --> 00:02:01.416 A:middle

you today a world-changing,

Find the top toast in town.

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:42.006 A:middle
Go and get some toast.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.416 A:middle
Share the toast with
your friends.

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:44.736 A:middle
Take a picture.

00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:49.456 A:middle
Share it with your
friends and loved ones.

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:06.876 A:middle
So go and get it.

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:09.476 A:middle
Except it's not.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.166 A:middle
None of this is real.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:13.656 A:middle
It's just a prototype.

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:17.776 A:middle
So why? Why would
we go to the trouble

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:21.556 A:middle
of creating this
beautiful, world-changing,

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
disruptive application
that is completely fake?

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:29.126 A:middle
Well, this is the picture
in most people's head.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.906 A:middle
I have an idea.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:42.006 A:middle
Then, I build my application,
and then, step three, profit.

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:49.326 A:middle
Except, what I see frequently
is that people have an idea,

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:51.526 A:middle
they build their application,

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.226 A:middle
and somehow they're
disappointed by the result.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.506 A:middle
Maybe the experience isn't
what you've hoped for.

00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
Maybe it just doesn't
resonate with your customers.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
Maybe it just doesn't
resonate with your customers.

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.596 A:middle
And building applications
are difficult.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:05.566 A:middle
You guys know this.

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:07.246 A:middle
It takes time.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:14.576 A:middle
It takes money, people,
sleep, heartache.

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:16.656 A:middle
And frankly, it's
a lot of typing.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:19.986 A:middle
So, that's a lot of
work for something

00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:22.386 A:middle
that you're not happy
with in the end.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:26.156 A:middle
So instead of going
from an idea directly

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:33.136 A:middle
to building your application,
we're going to go from an idea

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.846 A:middle
to a prototype, and then
build our application.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:40.476 A:middle
And it's best if we can do
that over and over again.

00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:43.366 A:middle
The more prototypes we
can put between our idea

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:47.616 A:middle
and our application, the better
the result is going to be.

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:51.636 A:middle
And the way that we do this is
by beginning with something fake

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:54.476 A:middle
and then gradually
adding elements

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:56.426 A:middle
that are more real
along the way,

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:58.346 A:middle
sprinkling it with
interactivity.

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.956 A:middle
So there are two
important reasons


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.956 A:middle
So there are two
important reasons

00:05:01.956 --> 00:05:04.866 A:middle
to prototype I want everybody to
keep in mind throughout today.

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:09.686 A:middle
Number one is to test
ideas, to save time

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.326 A:middle
and money building the right
things for your application.

00:05:12.806 --> 00:05:17.636 A:middle
And number two is to get new
ideas, to make the experience

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:22.206 A:middle
of your app even
better in the end.

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:23.926 A:middle
So how do we do this?

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.826 A:middle
It's actually really simple.

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:34.066 A:middle
Make fake apps, show people
and learn from their feedback.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:41.126 A:middle
Again, make fake
apps, show people

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
and learn from their feedback.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:49.236 A:middle
Do that over, and over, and
over again until the experience

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:50.526 A:middle
of your app feels great.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:55.046 A:middle
So how do we make fake apps?

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:55.726 A:middle
What does that mean?

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:59.536 A:middle
Well, we want to ask ourselves
three questions before we begin.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:03.266 A:middle
The first one is what
needs to be more real?

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:05.136 A:middle
Everything else is
going to be fake,

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:07.156 A:middle
but what one element
are we trying

00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:09.446 A:middle
to explore and get feedback on?

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:12.676 A:middle
The second question
is what can we fake?

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:14.106 A:middle
And that's everything else.

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.716 A:middle
Everything else will pretty
much just be a picture.

00:06:17.256 --> 00:06:21.776 A:middle
The third important question
is where will they use it?

00:06:22.156 --> 00:06:24.786 A:middle
We want to make sure that
if we're making a prototype,

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:29.416 A:middle
it's something that we can try
out on the device in the place

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.626 A:middle
where people will be using it.

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:36.976 A:middle
So, we've made a fake app; now
it's time to show it to people;

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:40.766 A:middle
we want to ask them three
questions as we're showing them.

00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:45.016 A:middle
Do you know how to do
this one particular thing

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:46.176 A:middle
that we have prototyped?

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:49.856 A:middle
Is it easy to do that thing?

00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:54.006 A:middle
And in general, how can
we make this better?

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:57.116 A:middle
We want to solicit
kind of freeform input

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:58.706 A:middle
on how we can improve our app.

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.866 A:middle
You'd be surprised what
interesting things people have


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.866 A:middle
You'd be surprised what
interesting things people have

00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:03.186 A:middle
to say.

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.146 A:middle
So who do we show
our fake apps to?

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:09.046 A:middle
Makes sense, the
people your app is for.

00:07:09.686 --> 00:07:12.046 A:middle
So, if your app isn't
for engineers,

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:16.046 A:middle
go and find some people
who are not engineers.

00:07:16.046 --> 00:07:19.576 A:middle
Don't argue, defend or dismiss.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:22.276 A:middle
You're not there to
debate the pros and cons

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:23.826 A:middle
of what you've prototyped.

00:07:24.126 --> 00:07:28.906 A:middle
You're there to get information
from people and learn from them.

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:30.366 A:middle
So we've showed some people.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.716 A:middle
We've probably taken some notes.

00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:32.246 A:middle
We've probed.

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:33.356 A:middle
We've asked a few questions.

00:07:33.876 --> 00:07:39.076 A:middle
Now we ask ourselves three
questions about what to do next.

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
What's working in
what we showed them?

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.016 A:middle
What's not working?

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:44.476 A:middle
What did people did
not understand?

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:47.636 A:middle
What did they stumble over
or was confusing in some way?

00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:50.836 A:middle
And what other ideas
does this give us

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:53.246 A:middle
about what we might
want to do next?

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:58.596 A:middle
So again, make, show and
learn, and we do this over

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
and over again until
the experience


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
and over again until
the experience

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:01.676 A:middle
of our product is great.

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:03.846 A:middle
Now today, we're going to do

00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:05.236 A:middle
that in a few different
ways for you guys.

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:07.546 A:middle
We're going to prototype
with pictures,

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
just drawing for the device.

00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:12.286 A:middle
Then we're going to
prototype with animation,

00:08:12.456 --> 00:08:14.156 A:middle
so we can see how
different screens

00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:15.336 A:middle
that we've drawn work together.

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:18.656 A:middle
And then we're going to
prototype with interaction,

00:08:18.656 --> 00:08:20.866 A:middle
so we can see how the
entire experience feels

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:22.066 A:middle
in our hand on the device.

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:25.976 A:middle
Now to prototype with
pictures, we're actually going

00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:26.616 A:middle
to do it in Keynote today.

00:08:27.526 --> 00:08:29.456 A:middle
Keynote is fast, easy
and cheap and a lot

00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:31.166 A:middle
of you probably already
have it on your computer.

00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:34.155 A:middle
But in practice, you can
use anything that can chop

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:36.976 A:middle
up pictures and draw
a few basic shapes.

00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:40.765 A:middle
For animation, we're actually
also going to prototype

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:43.275 A:middle
with Keynote, which is a
surprisingly sophisticated

00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:44.076 A:middle
animation tool.

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:46.626 A:middle
But you can use anything
that can move pictures

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:47.956 A:middle
around on the screen over time.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.046 A:middle
And to prototype
our interactions,

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.456 A:middle
we're actually going to use
-objective-C and Core Animation.

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:57.456 A:middle
That's what we use frequently
to prototype concepts.

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:00.556 A:middle
And it's actually
easier than you think

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:00.556 A:middle
And it's actually
easier than you think

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:02.066 A:middle
if you're not a developer.

00:09:02.616 --> 00:09:04.736 A:middle
If you are a developer,
you're going to see us use it

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:09.106 A:middle
in a slightly different way
than you might be used to.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:12.136 A:middle
So, I'd like to recap
for you the key features

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:15.746 A:middle
of "Toast Modern," our
beautiful, world-changing,

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:18.006 A:middle
disruptive application.

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:21.646 A:middle
We want to find toast
to eat near me,

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:27.146 A:middle
want to find the top toast to
eat, post toast, rate toast,

00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:29.066 A:middle
and review and discuss toast

00:09:29.556 --> 00:09:31.036 A:middle
with my fellow toast
aficionados.

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:33.426 A:middle
These are a lot of
toast features.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.856 A:middle
So, we're actually just going
to pare it down to talking

00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:39.596 A:middle
about the first two,
finding top toast to eat,

00:09:40.406 --> 00:09:42.246 A:middle
and finding toast
to eat near me.

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:44.396 A:middle
To begin the prototyping
process,

00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:46.546 A:middle
I'd like to ask Linda
Dong to come to the stage.

00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:54.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:55.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Jeff.

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:57.186 A:middle
Good morning.

00:09:57.826 --> 00:10:01.826 A:middle
So, to figure out how finding
toast in our app is going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.826 --> 00:10:01.826 A:middle
So, to figure out how finding
toast in our app is going

00:10:01.826 --> 00:10:05.476 A:middle
to work, we're going to
begin by making pictures.

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:10.626 A:middle
So here we start off by drawing
just a ton of different sketches

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:13.696 A:middle
to quickly get down all
the ideas in our heads

00:10:14.116 --> 00:10:17.426 A:middle
for ways we can show nearby
as well as top-rated toast.

00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:21.946 A:middle
Now, on our team, we always
start from hand drawn concepts.

00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:25.536 A:middle
I'm going to really emphasize
that you guys all do it too

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:27.596 A:middle
if you're not already
doing this.

00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:30.826 A:middle
There's just no faster
or cheaper way

00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:34.226 A:middle
to get ideas flowing,
to explore a whole slew

00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:35.996 A:middle
of directions than
through drawing.

00:10:36.926 --> 00:10:38.236 A:middle
And drawing is fun.

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:40.276 A:middle
Like who doesn't want
to dream of a ton

00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.336 A:middle
of crazy disposable ideas.

00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:44.056 A:middle
Not you guys, right?

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.716 A:middle
And keep in mind.

00:10:46.716 --> 00:10:48.536 A:middle
You don't have to be
an artist to do this.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:51.296 A:middle
Maybe your drawings
look more like this.

00:10:53.346 --> 00:10:55.836 A:middle
Whatever. I mean
don't go showing this

00:10:55.836 --> 00:11:00.086 A:middle
to like board meetings or
anything, but the point remains


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:55.836 --> 00:11:00.086 A:middle
to like board meetings or
anything, but the point remains

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.206 A:middle
that we're trying to emphasize

00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:05.086 A:middle
that you should not
start prototyping

00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:06.376 A:middle
from just a single idea.

00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:10.456 A:middle
You want to explore and
understand the whole space

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:14.086 A:middle
in order to figure out the
best direction for your app.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:19.156 A:middle
So when we were comparing all
of our ideas, there were four

00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:22.606 A:middle
that stood out as really
compelling: this list,

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:25.926 A:middle
grid, map, and gallery.

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.646 A:middle
So why did we choose these four?

00:11:29.196 --> 00:11:31.876 A:middle
Well, not only do
they convey our type

00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:34.626 A:middle
of information really well.

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.636 A:middle
They also, unlike some
of the other ideas,

00:11:38.016 --> 00:11:40.756 A:middle
aren't overly complex
or too elaborate.

00:11:41.336 --> 00:11:42.746 A:middle
We want to start simple.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:47.906 A:middle
Also, they represent
four distinct directions

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.956 A:middle
that our app can take as opposed

00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:52.436 A:middle
to being variations
of a single idea.

00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:56.796 A:middle
And great, isn't this awesome
that we found all of this

00:11:56.796 --> 00:11:59.466 A:middle
out super quick on paper
before devoting a lot

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:02.456 A:middle
of time exploring
just one concept.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:02.456 A:middle
of time exploring
just one concept.

00:12:02.946 --> 00:12:08.116 A:middle
And so, I've got my sketches
and it's no big deal now.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.786 A:middle
They're just sketches, so I can
just throw away all the other

00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:13.526 A:middle
ideas that didn't
work out to just focus

00:12:13.526 --> 00:12:16.106 A:middle
on making these four more real.

00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:20.436 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to
turn them into some fake apps.

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:24.526 A:middle
So, the first question we're
going to ask ourselves is,

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:25.976 A:middle
what needs to be more real?

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:27.886 A:middle
Why are we making
these fake apps?

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:29.096 A:middle
What's our goal?

00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:31.446 A:middle
So right now we just
have drawings.

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:34.166 A:middle
So before we even think
about touching any code,

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:38.006 A:middle
we're going to determine
how these ideas will look

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.976 A:middle
on the screen in our hands.

00:12:41.076 --> 00:12:44.106 A:middle
Second question we're going to
ask ourselves: What can we fake?

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:45.956 A:middle
What shortcuts can we take?

00:12:46.696 --> 00:12:49.726 A:middle
Well, we can fake pretty
much all the content.

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:54.456 A:middle
We don't need a database of
toast photographs or locations,

00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:56.776 A:middle
we can make up filler
text and we're going

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.986 A:middle
to use temporary icons.

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:01.676 A:middle
And lastly, where
will we use it?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:01.676 A:middle
And lastly, where
will we use it?

00:13:02.106 --> 00:13:03.636 A:middle
Well, we're going
to put these screens

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:06.846 A:middle
on an actual iPhone
and use them outside.

00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:11.526 A:middle
So, we're going to start
off with the sketch

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.926 A:middle
of a toast list view
sorted by rating.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:17.366 A:middle
Now, before we dive straight
into translating this

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:19.156 A:middle
to the screen, we're
going to see

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:22.136 A:middle
if we can save ourselves some
time by borrowing elements

00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:24.646 A:middle
from existing iOS apps.

00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:28.516 A:middle
And just from browsing
on my phone, I've noticed

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:31.966 A:middle
that the music app actually
has a really similar structure

00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:33.286 A:middle
to our sketch.

00:13:33.636 --> 00:13:38.096 A:middle
So let's use this as a way
to kind of lay out our idea.

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:41.676 A:middle
And the way we're going to
do that is we're just going

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:45.426 A:middle
to take a snapshot of
the screen from our phone

00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:48.256 A:middle
and import it into
Keynote for Mac.

00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:53.146 A:middle
Now, we on our team use
Keynote really frequently

00:13:53.146 --> 00:13:55.416 A:middle
to make super quick
prototypes because it has a ton

00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:58.676 A:middle
of really useful tools that
make aligning photographs

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.216 A:middle
and images really easy.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.216 A:middle
and images really easy.

00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:04.576 A:middle
But you guys should be using
whatever image editing tool

00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:05.926 A:middle
you're most comfortable in.

00:14:06.506 --> 00:14:08.846 A:middle
So if you've done this type
of stuff before, maybe you're

00:14:08.846 --> 00:14:11.056 A:middle
in Photoshop or Pixelmator
or Sketch.

00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:15.326 A:middle
If you're a developer who's
never done image editing before,

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:19.346 A:middle
a great place to start
off is Preview for Mac.

00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:21.566 A:middle
So we've got our screenshot.

00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:22.576 A:middle
What do we do next?

00:14:23.306 --> 00:14:27.506 A:middle
Well, we want to block off the
main areas of the UI in order

00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:30.136 A:middle
to create ourselves a
type of template to drop

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:31.426 A:middle
in our own content into.

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:35.206 A:middle
So the way we're going to do
that in Keynote is actually open

00:14:35.286 --> 00:14:39.276 A:middle
up the Shape Menu and drop
in just a ton of boxes

00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:43.586 A:middle
to block off the navigation
bar, all the photographs,

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:47.676 A:middle
the borders and the background.

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:51.286 A:middle
So great, now we have a basic
structure to work off of.

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:55.766 A:middle
Next up is to get
that navigation bar

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:56.776 A:middle
to be the right color.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
So to do that in Keynote,
you open up the Color Picker,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
So to do that in Keynote,
you open up the Color Picker,

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:04.396 A:middle
and using that magnifying
glass tool, sample the color

00:15:04.396 --> 00:15:06.526 A:middle
of the status bar above it.

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:09.096 A:middle
And now we've got ourselves
a blank navigation bar.

00:15:09.806 --> 00:15:11.626 A:middle
Now, that was really
simple, right?

00:15:11.826 --> 00:15:14.166 A:middle
Well, that's because
we're using a screenshot.

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:18.836 A:middle
So, you don't need to know exact
pixel dimensions or even colors

00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:21.476 A:middle
of UI elements in order
to re-create them,

00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:23.546 A:middle
which saves us a ton of time.

00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:27.846 A:middle
And so, the next thing I want to
do is just add in some content.

00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:30.116 A:middle
And in particular, some images.

00:15:30.986 --> 00:15:34.856 A:middle
So, here's some photographs
I took this morning

00:15:34.856 --> 00:15:39.126 A:middle
on my daily toast excursion,
and I'm just going to put

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:40.136 A:middle
in this good looking one.

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:43.866 A:middle
And now that I'm looking at
that photograph, I'm thinking,

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:46.946 A:middle
maybe instead of just a
plain square thumbnail,

00:15:47.256 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
we could do something cool where
we crop the image to a circle

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.426 A:middle
so all you can see is
the plate and the toast.

00:15:54.706 --> 00:15:57.846 A:middle
And so, luckily for us,
Keynote actually has a great set

00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:01.006 A:middle
of options to be able to
mask an image to any shape.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:01.006 A:middle
of options to be able to
mask an image to any shape.

00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:03.776 A:middle
So, we're going to
choose the Oval Mask here,

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:08.476 A:middle
and now we've got a perfectly
cropped plate of toast

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:12.666 A:middle
that we can - yes, thank
you guy - that we can put

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:16.326 A:middle
into our placeholder, and
we're just going to repeat

00:16:16.326 --> 00:16:18.586 A:middle
that same process
for other images.

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:23.166 A:middle
Now, notice, we're just using
the same three images over

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:25.646 A:middle
and over again, and that's
because we don't want

00:16:25.646 --> 00:16:28.206 A:middle
to spend more time than
necessary creating content.

00:16:28.746 --> 00:16:32.256 A:middle
Three pictures of toast for all
of your screens, totally fine.

00:16:33.396 --> 00:16:36.636 A:middle
And so, once these images are
in place, now we can get rid

00:16:36.636 --> 00:16:37.416 A:middle
of those placeholders.

00:16:37.946 --> 00:16:40.596 A:middle
And right off the bat, I'm
sure you're noticing this,

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:43.176 A:middle
you can't see the plates of
toast on that background.

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.036 A:middle
So, how do we fix that?

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:46.766 A:middle
Do we add borders?

00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:48.246 A:middle
Do we add drop shadows?

00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:50.096 A:middle
Do we change the
background image?

00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:52.336 A:middle
Like what are the
parameters that we use?

00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:53.876 A:middle
Well, hold on.

00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:56.786 A:middle
Those are all visual
design decisions

00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:59.976 A:middle
that we can make further down
the line if we even decide

00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:01.676 A:middle
to go with this direction.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:01.676 A:middle
to go with this direction.

00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:04.376 A:middle
For now, we're going to
do something super basic

00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:09.106 A:middle
and just add in a simple
one pixel border around all

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:11.226 A:middle
of our images, and done.

00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:13.925 A:middle
We're - it's already
more visible.

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:15.786 A:middle
We can worry about the
details of it later.

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:19.236 A:middle
And so now I've got
my images of toast.

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:20.306 A:middle
I want to label them.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:23.266 A:middle
And so to help us out with that,
we're actually going to take

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:25.076 A:middle
that white box we were
using as a background

00:17:25.576 --> 00:17:26.656 A:middle
and make it transparent.

00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:29.236 A:middle
So, this way the music app
is now peeking through,

00:17:29.236 --> 00:17:33.856 A:middle
and we can see how the labels
in that screen are laid

00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:40.196 A:middle
out in order to help us lay
out and size our own text.

00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:42.516 A:middle
And now notice, these
locations don't exist.

00:17:43.186 --> 00:17:45.986 A:middle
You can't get toast with
goat butter and trout on it.

00:17:46.436 --> 00:17:47.366 A:middle
That's not a thing.

00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:50.716 A:middle
We're just faking text
because it's quick

00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:52.866 A:middle
and we don't have
to worry about it.

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.536 A:middle
So, cool, this is actually
really coming together.

00:17:56.546 --> 00:18:00.976 A:middle
We just can up the opacity
of the background again


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:56.546 --> 00:18:00.976 A:middle
We just can up the opacity
of the background again

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:03.706 A:middle
and make some little
tweaks and adjustments

00:18:03.706 --> 00:18:05.676 A:middle
so that the layout works
for our composition.

00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:09.936 A:middle
So, the only thing that's
missing right now is ratings.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.086 A:middle
And so, for this, I'm
actually going to go

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:16.496 A:middle
into the Special Characters
menu, which some of you guys may

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:18.786 A:middle
or may not be already
familiar with.

00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:24.286 A:middle
So here, we actually get a giant
list of pre-existing symbols

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:26.786 A:middle
and characters that
we could repurpose

00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:28.996 A:middle
as icons for our layout.

00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:34.276 A:middle
So, I found myself a really
nice star symbol that I want

00:18:34.276 --> 00:18:35.846 A:middle
to use to represent ratings.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:39.956 A:middle
I'm just going to drop a ton of
those in, align them together,

00:18:39.956 --> 00:18:42.416 A:middle
and we've got some
ratings, awesome.

00:18:43.476 --> 00:18:46.136 A:middle
Now, I think this
looks pretty OK,

00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:49.526 A:middle
but I think those stars
could really use a tint color

00:18:49.526 --> 00:18:51.336 A:middle
because I want to make
them look active later.

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:56.406 A:middle
So, what particular color
you use now doesn't matter.

00:18:57.516 --> 00:19:01.016 A:middle
So, we're just going to go into
Keynotes default color palette


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.516 --> 00:19:01.016 A:middle
So, we're just going to go into
Keynotes default color palette

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:04.056 A:middle
and choose a color
that makes sense.

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:07.046 A:middle
So, here I chose orange
because it's the toastiest color

00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:08.466 A:middle
of the rainbow.

00:19:09.726 --> 00:19:11.696 A:middle
Great, now I've got
some orange stars

00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:13.566 A:middle
and they look more
active already.

00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:16.376 A:middle
And I really like that
color so I'm actually going

00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:18.626 A:middle
to change the borders around
my image to be the same color.

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:21.506 A:middle
And now we've got a
nice relationship going

00:19:21.506 --> 00:19:24.956 A:middle
between the picture of the toast
and its rating through color.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:29.726 A:middle
And so, last but not least,
I'm going to add a control

00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:33.946 A:middle
to the top right-hand side of
this app so that someone can add

00:19:34.136 --> 00:19:36.266 A:middle
in a new photograph
of a piece of toast.

00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:43.386 A:middle
And here, we could get all fancy
with custom shapes, and masking,

00:19:43.386 --> 00:19:45.876 A:middle
and doing all sorts
of intricate stuff.

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:49.896 A:middle
But remember we only care about
temporary icons right now.

00:19:50.676 --> 00:19:54.436 A:middle
So instead, we are literally
going to add in a text box,

00:19:55.996 --> 00:20:00.356 A:middle
type in the plus symbol, and
now you've designed an icon


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:55.996 --> 00:20:00.356 A:middle
type in the plus symbol, and
now you've designed an icon

00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:01.276 A:middle
in five seconds.

00:20:01.396 --> 00:20:02.386 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:20:05.096 --> 00:20:06.716 A:middle
All right, yeah,
plus signs, cool.

00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:10.876 A:middle
And last but not least,
just scribble on a title

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.196 A:middle
for your screen,
and there you go.

00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:18.986 A:middle
One freshly baked screen
ready to be tested.

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:23.366 A:middle
Now, one thing to really keep in
mind when you're making screens

00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:27.816 A:middle
on any program is to remember
to zoom out to the physical size

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:31.686 A:middle
of the device that your
screen is going to live on.

00:20:31.956 --> 00:20:35.806 A:middle
It's really easy to get caught
up working at a zoom level

00:20:36.346 --> 00:20:39.406 A:middle
where everything is big,
and clear, and legible.

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:43.526 A:middle
So, remember, every time
you added a new element

00:20:43.526 --> 00:20:47.746 A:middle
onto the screen, to zoom out,
and check if that piece of text

00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:52.006 A:middle
or that picture is both
readable, legible, and tappable,

00:20:52.366 --> 00:20:53.916 A:middle
and catch that early on.

00:20:54.526 --> 00:20:58.786 A:middle
So, now we've got
one screen ready.

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:01.446 A:middle
And that screen took us
about 10 minutes to make.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:01.446 A:middle
And that screen took us
about 10 minutes to make.

00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:06.406 A:middle
If we were to have
worried too much

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:09.496 A:middle
about all the visual nuances
that the screen could have,

00:21:10.046 --> 00:21:11.516 A:middle
we would be here
for the next hour

00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:13.456 A:middle
and this would be a
really boring presentation.

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:15.996 A:middle
Instead, we took shortcuts.

00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:19.936 A:middle
And that's fine because
these aren't going

00:21:19.936 --> 00:21:21.106 A:middle
to be our final screens.

00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:24.616 A:middle
And so, I'm going to rinse
and repeat that process

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.456 A:middle
of screenshotting,
masking, arranging objects,

00:21:28.626 --> 00:21:31.036 A:middle
and adding basic content
to the rest of our ideas,

00:21:31.736 --> 00:21:35.186 A:middle
like our GridView idea, which
looks like the camera roll.

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:39.406 A:middle
And in practice, it's like,
ah, kind of too much toast.

00:21:39.406 --> 00:21:43.466 A:middle
That's a lot of toast
to look at.

00:21:43.466 --> 00:21:46.596 A:middle
Or our map idea which
- I don't know,

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:47.776 A:middle
that looks pretty interesting.

00:21:47.776 --> 00:21:51.606 A:middle
I think that would be
really fun to play with.

00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:53.926 A:middle
Or our gallery weather app idea,

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
which just like looks
really cool.

00:21:58.176 --> 00:22:00.726 A:middle
And so, now I've
got my four screens,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.176 --> 00:22:00.726 A:middle
And so, now I've
got my four screens,

00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:03.316 A:middle
and again they're not going
to be our final designs.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:08.036 A:middle
There're many places where
we could refine the visual

00:22:08.716 --> 00:22:14.846 A:middle
appearance and/or the
styling of all of the screens.

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:18.596 A:middle
But we're not going to
do that because it's OK,

00:22:18.596 --> 00:22:20.646 A:middle
because we didn't make
these applications

00:22:20.646 --> 00:22:22.226 A:middle
to become gorgeous hero shots.

00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:24.156 A:middle
We made them so that
we could test

00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:26.826 A:middle
out how successful
each concept will be.

00:22:27.956 --> 00:22:30.226 A:middle
That way when we
do devote our time

00:22:30.296 --> 00:22:34.156 A:middle
and effort polishing the
visuals of our final screen,

00:22:34.456 --> 00:22:37.016 A:middle
we'll know we're doing
it to the right idea.

00:22:37.626 --> 00:22:39.916 A:middle
And so, what's next?

00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:43.216 A:middle
Well, we have our screens,
we're going to drop them

00:22:43.216 --> 00:22:46.386 A:middle
onto an iPhone and give
them to people to test out.

00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:49.196 A:middle
So, the way we're going to do
that is we're going to go back

00:22:49.196 --> 00:22:52.556 A:middle
into Keynote and export our
presentation into images,

00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:54.166 A:middle
and specifically PNGs.

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:57.406 A:middle
And then use whatever
method you want

00:22:57.406 --> 00:22:59.296 A:middle
to get those images
onto your phone.

00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:03.176 A:middle
So that might be Photo
Stream, the new iCloud drive,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:03.176 A:middle
So that might be Photo
Stream, the new iCloud drive,

00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:05.866 A:middle
or you can just email
them to yourself.

00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:10.126 A:middle
And then once you've
got them on your phone,

00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:13.206 A:middle
give them to your friends,
give them to your coworkers,

00:23:13.616 --> 00:23:17.346 A:middle
give them to a variety of
people and just observe them

00:23:17.486 --> 00:23:19.356 A:middle
like looking at the
screens for right now.

00:23:20.546 --> 00:23:23.046 A:middle
See if they can even figure
out what this app does.

00:23:24.326 --> 00:23:26.616 A:middle
See if it reads differently
indoors as opposed

00:23:26.616 --> 00:23:28.466 A:middle
to outdoors - it probably will.

00:23:29.806 --> 00:23:32.306 A:middle
And then once you've just
observed them for a little bit,

00:23:33.586 --> 00:23:38.156 A:middle
you want to ask them three
questions: "Do you know how

00:23:38.156 --> 00:23:39.826 A:middle
to find top-rated toast?"

00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:41.206 A:middle
"What about nearby toast?"

00:23:41.206 --> 00:23:45.696 A:middle
And the feedback that we
got was, "Yeah, ratings,

00:23:46.066 --> 00:23:48.276 A:middle
the star icons make
it really obvious how

00:23:48.276 --> 00:23:49.426 A:middle
to find top-rated toast.

00:23:50.186 --> 00:23:53.196 A:middle
But, nearby toast is
really hard to figure

00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:54.546 A:middle
out if it's not laid
out on a map."

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:57.876 A:middle
So, that's really useful
information for you to have

00:23:57.876 --> 00:23:59.826 A:middle
in order to make
iterations of your screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.716 A:middle
Second thing you want to ask,

00:24:03.186 --> 00:24:04.736 A:middle
"Is it easy to browse
through toast?"

00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:10.746 A:middle
And it seems that, yeah people
are having a pretty easy time

00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:13.506 A:middle
reading through all the
screens except for of course

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:15.166 A:middle
that grid view that no one likes

00:24:15.256 --> 00:24:16.356 A:middle
because it's hurting
the retinas.

00:24:17.026 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
And then lastly: "How
can we make this better?"

00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:21.696 A:middle
"How can we improve?"

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:26.026 A:middle
And maybe we just got the
consensus that, you know,

00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:28.666 A:middle
you guys should really go
through the list and the Mappy,

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.406 A:middle
that seems to really
resonate with people.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.096 A:middle
We should probably
refine the interactions

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:34.416 A:middle
of those two screens more.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:38.296 A:middle
And so, to tell you how
to do that with animation,

00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:40.956 A:middle
I'm actually going to invite
Julian Missig on to the stage.

00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:45.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:46.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Linda.

00:24:46.516 --> 00:24:49.456 A:middle
Now, that we've gathered
some of this feedback,

00:24:49.456 --> 00:24:51.656 A:middle
I'm going to take you
through another spin

00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:53.246 A:middle
around this prototyping cycle.

00:24:54.316 --> 00:24:58.176 A:middle
So, we should take a step
back and learn from some

00:24:58.176 --> 00:25:00.726 A:middle
of the feedback we got.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.176 --> 00:25:00.726 A:middle
of the feedback we got.

00:25:00.926 --> 00:25:01.956 A:middle
What's working so far?

00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:05.366 A:middle
Well, we have a variety
of methods

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:06.946 A:middle
of organizing this information.

00:25:07.496 --> 00:25:12.576 A:middle
We have lists and
galleries, grids, maps.

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:19.026 A:middle
We don't yet have one best way
to find and discover toast.

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:20.576 A:middle
We have a couple of them.

00:25:21.746 --> 00:25:26.426 A:middle
Sometimes, people seem to prefer
to look for toast by rating.

00:25:26.746 --> 00:25:28.786 A:middle
And sometimes, they just want
to find the closest toast.

00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:32.206 A:middle
So perhaps, our app
could let people choose.

00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:37.566 A:middle
Sometimes, people could
search for toast by rating,

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:40.406 A:middle
and sometimes they could
look for it on a map.

00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:44.656 A:middle
So we'd like to make
a prototype to try

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:46.606 A:middle
to understand how
this could work.

00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:50.826 A:middle
The thing that we
want to make more real

00:25:51.096 --> 00:25:56.216 A:middle
in this prototype is the
connection between a screen

00:25:56.216 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
that has top toast and a
screen that has a map on it


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:56.216 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
that has top toast and a
screen that has a map on it

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:02.476 A:middle
because our app is going to
have both of these things in it

00:26:02.476 --> 00:26:04.766 A:middle
at some point in time.

00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:09.146 A:middle
We don't yet need to make
fully interactive screens.

00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:11.566 A:middle
We don't need to be able to
tap on each piece of toast.

00:26:11.566 --> 00:26:12.976 A:middle
We don't need to scroll
through these lists.

00:26:13.496 --> 00:26:14.516 A:middle
We actually don't even need

00:26:14.516 --> 00:26:16.866 A:middle
to have final designs
for these screens.

00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:19.616 A:middle
Because, if we're
doing things correctly,

00:26:19.616 --> 00:26:22.976 A:middle
we're probably actually going
to go back and redraw some

00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:24.996 A:middle
of these screens based
upon what we've learned.

00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:29.976 A:middle
As we make a more
realistic prototype,

00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:33.326 A:middle
we should also make our
context a little bit more real.

00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:37.076 A:middle
So in this case, this is not
the part of the app where we're

00:26:37.266 --> 00:26:38.816 A:middle
in a restaurant taking pictures.

00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:42.326 A:middle
We're still trying to find
the restaurant we will be at.

00:26:43.176 --> 00:26:48.516 A:middle
So, I'm probably walking around
on a busy sidewalk starting

00:26:48.516 --> 00:26:51.246 A:middle
to get really hungry looking
for a piece of toast to eat.

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:53.536 A:middle
I'm going to be kind of
distracted, not paying a lot

00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:54.616 A:middle
of attention to my phone.

00:26:55.406 --> 00:26:58.086 A:middle
This means that I'm not going
to spend a lot of time trying

00:26:58.086 --> 00:27:01.496 A:middle
to figure out how this app
works and navigate through it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.086 --> 00:27:01.496 A:middle
to figure out how this app
works and navigate through it.

00:27:01.496 --> 00:27:03.176 A:middle
I'm just looking for
those restaurants.

00:27:04.156 --> 00:27:06.356 A:middle
As I was mentioning before,
the thing that we want

00:27:06.356 --> 00:27:09.336 A:middle
to make more realistic in this
prototype is the connection

00:27:09.676 --> 00:27:12.006 A:middle
or relationship between
two difference screens.

00:27:12.656 --> 00:27:17.606 A:middle
At one point in time, this
app is going to have a screen

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:19.916 A:middle
that will have Top
Toast, the ratings.

00:27:20.606 --> 00:27:23.756 A:middle
At another point in time,
this app will have a screen

00:27:23.756 --> 00:27:25.546 A:middle
that will have Nearby
Toast or a map.

00:27:26.636 --> 00:27:29.406 A:middle
So this app is going to
be changing over time

00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:30.936 A:middle
between these two screens.

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:34.276 A:middle
And a change over time
is an animation, right?

00:27:35.876 --> 00:27:38.786 A:middle
Now, there are variety of tools

00:27:38.786 --> 00:27:40.726 A:middle
that you can use
to make animations.

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:44.796 A:middle
If you're a designer, you
might be familiar with tools

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:47.656 A:middle
such as Motion, AfterEffects,
or Quartz Composer.

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:52.946 A:middle
If you're a developer, you
might use tools such as HTML,

00:27:52.996 --> 00:27:54.956 A:middle
CSS animations or Processing.

00:27:55.506 --> 00:28:00.116 A:middle
Either way, we think you
might be able to use tools


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:55.506 --> 00:28:00.116 A:middle
Either way, we think you
might be able to use tools

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:03.316 A:middle
such as Hype, iAd
Producer or Keynote.

00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:07.766 A:middle
As Jeff mentioned earlier,

00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:09.706 A:middle
we're going to be building
these animations in Keynote.

00:28:11.026 --> 00:28:13.146 A:middle
We can actually run
Keynote on our iPhone

00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:16.776 A:middle
and see the animations
live there.

00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:19.296 A:middle
We can make modifications
rapidly back on our Mac

00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:21.256 A:middle
and see those changes
reflected on our iPhone.

00:28:21.626 --> 00:28:22.656 A:middle
It's really quick,
and it's a tool

00:28:22.656 --> 00:28:24.146 A:middle
that we use a lot in our team.

00:28:24.726 --> 00:28:29.226 A:middle
So, we're just going
to open up Keynote,

00:28:29.996 --> 00:28:34.086 A:middle
and we will grab the two
slides that we made earlier

00:28:34.586 --> 00:28:37.566 A:middle
and drop them in as the only
two slides in our presentation.

00:28:39.056 --> 00:28:43.756 A:middle
We will go over to the Animate
palette and choose a transition.

00:28:44.246 --> 00:28:47.156 A:middle
Here, we'll just choose
Move In from Bottom to Top.

00:28:47.156 --> 00:28:50.706 A:middle
Let's just see what
that looks like.

00:28:54.276 --> 00:28:58.726 A:middle
So, this slide in from bottom
to top is perhaps like some

00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:01.176 A:middle
of the sheet animations
that iOS has


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:01.176 A:middle
of the sheet animations
that iOS has

00:29:01.176 --> 00:29:03.066 A:middle
where it's some temporary
information laid

00:29:03.066 --> 00:29:04.506 A:middle
on top of other information.

00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:07.366 A:middle
Maybe let's move
out horizontally.

00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:12.276 A:middle
Well this looks a lot like
the navigate back animation.

00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:14.086 A:middle
You're going back up the
navigation hierarchy.

00:29:14.576 --> 00:29:17.946 A:middle
Maybe we could flip it over.

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:22.186 A:middle
Maybe this is some
kind of setting

00:29:22.186 --> 00:29:24.436 A:middle
or information behind
that other screen.

00:29:25.016 --> 00:29:28.176 A:middle
The thing that I'm trying
to get across here is

00:29:28.176 --> 00:29:32.196 A:middle
that any animation you choose
is communicating something

00:29:32.196 --> 00:29:33.286 A:middle
about the relationship

00:29:33.286 --> 00:29:35.156 A:middle
that these screens
have with one another.

00:29:36.306 --> 00:29:38.906 A:middle
Even if it's no animation
at all, if it's just a pop,

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:43.456 A:middle
that's something that shows
almost no relationship

00:29:43.456 --> 00:29:44.306 A:middle
between the screens.

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:45.736 A:middle
They're just being
replaced by one another.

00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:49.966 A:middle
But in this case, that's not
really what's going on here.

00:29:49.966 --> 00:29:54.486 A:middle
What we have is two different
views of the same information.

00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:56.976 A:middle
Perhaps those three
restaurants that are

00:29:56.976 --> 00:29:59.806 A:middle
in the map are three
restaurants from that list.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.226 --> 00:30:02.736 A:middle
So that's something we want to
communicate as we transition

00:30:02.736 --> 00:30:03.706 A:middle
between these screens.

00:30:04.246 --> 00:30:08.936 A:middle
Now, before we get a little
bit further within Keynote,

00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:12.056 A:middle
I just like to explain something
about two different types

00:30:12.336 --> 00:30:14.266 A:middle
of animation within Keynote.

00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:18.926 A:middle
The first is called
a build animation.

00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
These are animations
that happen on objects

00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.616 A:middle
or shapes within a slide.

00:30:25.236 --> 00:30:27.156 A:middle
You can build in a shape,

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:29.656 A:middle
perform some actions
on it, build it out.

00:30:30.576 --> 00:30:32.596 A:middle
You can use the Build
Order palette to set

00:30:32.596 --> 00:30:34.606 A:middle
up a pretty sophisticated
sequence

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:37.166 A:middle
of build animations
all within a slide.

00:30:37.726 --> 00:30:42.406 A:middle
But there's another type of
animation called a transition.

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:45.606 A:middle
And the transition
is an animation

00:30:45.606 --> 00:30:47.166 A:middle
that happens between two slides.

00:30:47.556 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
Those were the animations we
were just playing with now.

00:30:50.976 --> 00:30:52.546 A:middle
There's a particular kind

00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:56.296 A:middle
of transition called Magic
Move that's really interesting

00:30:56.296 --> 00:30:58.616 A:middle
for our purposes.

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:03.096 A:middle
What Magic Move does, is it
tries to identify objects


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:03.096 A:middle
What Magic Move does, is it
tries to identify objects

00:31:03.096 --> 00:31:06.166 A:middle
or shapes that are the
same on the two slides

00:31:07.266 --> 00:31:12.286 A:middle
and it will create an
interpolation of the position,

00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:15.156 A:middle
sizing, opacity and other
properties of those shapes.

00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:22.186 A:middle
So for example, if Magic Move
identifies the three circles

00:31:22.186 --> 00:31:23.926 A:middle
as the same on these two slides,

00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:28.696 A:middle
it might produce an
animation like this.

00:31:29.146 --> 00:31:30.736 A:middle
Now if you're familiar
with animation tools,

00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:33.766 A:middle
you might recognize, we're
starting to use these slides

00:31:33.976 --> 00:31:36.866 A:middle
as if they are key frames
in a larger animation.

00:31:37.426 --> 00:31:41.286 A:middle
That makes it a lot
easier to sequence out

00:31:41.286 --> 00:31:43.566 A:middle
and separate the different
steps of our animation.

00:31:44.126 --> 00:31:47.416 A:middle
So we're going to
go back to Keynote

00:31:47.416 --> 00:31:51.206 A:middle
and choose the Animate palette.

00:31:51.206 --> 00:31:55.806 A:middle
Now that you know about
Keynote's two types

00:31:55.806 --> 00:31:57.506 A:middle
of animation, I'll just
note here real quick,

00:31:58.276 --> 00:31:59.816 A:middle
if you have a shape selected,

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:02.486 A:middle
the Animate palette will
show you Build animations.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:02.486 A:middle
the Animate palette will
show you Build animations.

00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:06.606 A:middle
If you have no shape selected,
if it's just the slide,

00:32:07.036 --> 00:32:09.206 A:middle
that's when you'll get
these transition animations

00:32:09.206 --> 00:32:10.186 A:middle
that we're using today.

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:13.126 A:middle
We're going to change the
transition to Magic Move.

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:18.026 A:middle
And without changing anything
at all about those two slides

00:32:18.076 --> 00:32:20.566 A:middle
that we've dropped in, let's
see what Magic Move gives us.

00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:27.506 A:middle
So you can see there's
already a lot more interesting

00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:29.516 A:middle
than the transitions we
were playing with earlier.

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:35.906 A:middle
Because we built these slides in
Keynote and use the same images

00:32:36.036 --> 00:32:37.456 A:middle
on both the lists and the map,

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:41.286 A:middle
the Magic Move transition
moved those images over,

00:32:41.286 --> 00:32:42.196 A:middle
and we can start to see

00:32:42.196 --> 00:32:44.476 A:middle
that maybe those restaurants are
the same on those two screens.

00:32:44.476 --> 00:32:46.226 A:middle
Maybe that's an interesting
way to do this transition.

00:32:46.786 --> 00:32:49.916 A:middle
But there are a couple of
things that we can make better.

00:32:50.856 --> 00:32:53.836 A:middle
The first thing that I noticed
was that, within our prototype,

00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:56.996 A:middle
we don't really even
have a fake way to get

00:32:56.996 --> 00:32:58.166 A:middle
between these two screens.

00:32:58.366 --> 00:33:01.296 A:middle
So to make it a little bit more
realistic so that we can kind


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.366 --> 00:33:01.296 A:middle
So to make it a little bit more
realistic so that we can kind

00:33:01.296 --> 00:33:04.396 A:middle
of imagine how you would
navigate between these screens,

00:33:04.836 --> 00:33:06.576 A:middle
we'll just drop in
a tab bar for now.

00:33:07.196 --> 00:33:09.026 A:middle
And this tab bar, similar

00:33:09.026 --> 00:33:12.176 A:middle
to the things Linda was showing
you earlier, is just a rectangle

00:33:13.346 --> 00:33:15.626 A:middle
from the Shapes tool in Keynote.

00:33:16.136 --> 00:33:19.036 A:middle
The star could be from
the special characters,

00:33:19.036 --> 00:33:21.636 A:middle
the star shape, and
that little map icon,

00:33:21.996 --> 00:33:23.616 A:middle
that's just using the Line tool

00:33:23.616 --> 00:33:26.976 A:middle
to draw a quick little
placeholder.

00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:30.156 A:middle
These don't need
to be perfect just

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:31.276 A:middle
yet because we don't even know

00:33:31.336 --> 00:33:33.806 A:middle
if this is the direction
we're going to take.

00:33:35.336 --> 00:33:41.006 A:middle
I also noticed how
the list faded out.

00:33:41.866 --> 00:33:45.266 A:middle
We had white for a while,
and then the map faded in.

00:33:46.086 --> 00:33:50.466 A:middle
This is because what Magic Move
is doing is fading out shapes

00:33:50.606 --> 00:33:54.026 A:middle
that won't exist first for the
first half of the animation.

00:33:54.506 --> 00:33:57.956 A:middle
And then after that
midpoint, the second half

00:33:57.956 --> 00:34:00.646 A:middle
of the animation is
fading in new shapes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.956 --> 00:34:00.646 A:middle
of the animation is
fading in new shapes.

00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:04.126 A:middle
So we can get around
that by making sure

00:34:04.126 --> 00:34:06.086 A:middle
that our shapes exist
on both slides.

00:34:07.056 --> 00:34:11.176 A:middle
So I'm going to copy that
map image that I want to fade

00:34:11.176 --> 00:34:13.646 A:middle
in throughout the entire
duration of the animation.

00:34:14.136 --> 00:34:16.476 A:middle
I'm going to copy that
from the second slide,

00:34:17.085 --> 00:34:18.766 A:middle
paste it on that first slide,

00:34:19.366 --> 00:34:23.846 A:middle
move it all the way behind all
the other shapes, and then,

00:34:23.846 --> 00:34:26.406 A:middle
just for fun, I'm going to
make it a little bit larger

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.176 A:middle
than it is on the second slide.

00:34:28.746 --> 00:34:32.446 A:middle
So, what the Magic Move
animation will give us will be

00:34:32.446 --> 00:34:34.235 A:middle
maybe a little bit of
a perspective shift

00:34:34.235 --> 00:34:37.025 A:middle
as the map is shrinking
as it's fading in.

00:34:38.266 --> 00:34:39.315 A:middle
Let's see what that looks like.

00:34:39.815 --> 00:34:45.246 A:middle
It's pretty neat.

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:49.136 A:middle
But there are a couple
of other things we can do

00:34:49.136 --> 00:34:50.315 A:middle
to make this even better.

00:34:50.876 --> 00:34:54.116 A:middle
Because right now, we're not
writing any code, so we can try

00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:59.076 A:middle
out some- maybe over-the-top
animations and take them

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:01.566 A:middle
out later, pare it down
to just what it needs.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:01.566 A:middle
out later, pare it down
to just what it needs.

00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:06.476 A:middle
But for now, it's so
little work to explore a lot

00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:07.696 A:middle
of interesting alternatives

00:35:07.696 --> 00:35:10.246 A:middle
that we should just try
everything we think we

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:10.766 A:middle
might try.

00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:16.476 A:middle
In this example here,
I am looking

00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:18.936 A:middle
at the title of those
two slides.

00:35:19.686 --> 00:35:22.196 A:middle
The title was another
one where we faded

00:35:22.196 --> 00:35:26.406 A:middle
out that Top Toast title and
then faded in Nearby Toast.

00:35:26.406 --> 00:35:27.476 A:middle
Then it faded through gray.

00:35:28.446 --> 00:35:31.136 A:middle
But I didn't really
like how that looked.

00:35:31.486 --> 00:35:34.236 A:middle
So, I'm going to copy
the Top Toast label

00:35:34.236 --> 00:35:35.056 A:middle
from the first slide.

00:35:35.056 --> 00:35:36.326 A:middle
Paste it on the second slide.

00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:38.366 A:middle
Do vice versa so that both

00:35:38.366 --> 00:35:39.816 A:middle
of those labels exist
on those slides.

00:35:39.816 --> 00:35:43.196 A:middle
I'm going to shift the
one that should be fading

00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:45.686 A:middle
out horizontally
off to one side,

00:35:46.066 --> 00:35:48.256 A:middle
drop its opacity down to zero.

00:35:48.476 --> 00:35:50.596 A:middle
Here I have it a little bit
higher just so you can see it.

00:35:51.136 --> 00:35:55.796 A:middle
But the effect that it will give
is the title will be fading in

00:35:56.096 --> 00:35:58.206 A:middle
and sliding horizontally
at the same time

00:35:58.826 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
as the other one is fading out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.826 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
as the other one is fading out.

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:03.306 A:middle
I also wanted to do something

00:36:03.306 --> 00:36:06.036 A:middle
about those restaurant
names in the list.

00:36:07.176 --> 00:36:09.436 A:middle
I didn't like that they
just faded out in place.

00:36:10.296 --> 00:36:13.546 A:middle
So I copied those restaurant
names from the first slide,

00:36:14.276 --> 00:36:17.636 A:middle
that list; pasted them on
the second slide, the map;

00:36:18.336 --> 00:36:20.596 A:middle
and I shift them way off
of the side of the screen.

00:36:20.786 --> 00:36:22.826 A:middle
It'll drop their
opacity a little bit.

00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:24.796 A:middle
So look on a slide out.

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.156 A:middle
Now, a little bit
of a pro tip here.

00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:30.016 A:middle
If you stagger them
horizontally a little bit,

00:36:31.096 --> 00:36:34.096 A:middle
the animation speeds will
be a little bit different

00:36:34.246 --> 00:36:35.036 A:middle
for each item.

00:36:35.786 --> 00:36:39.166 A:middle
So they will feel like
distinct items, not like part

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:41.996 A:middle
of one sheet sliding away,
because these are distinct items

00:36:41.996 --> 00:36:44.186 A:middle
in a list and we'd
like to reinforce that.

00:36:47.096 --> 00:36:51.496 A:middle
Finally, once I've built up both
of these slides to the point

00:36:51.496 --> 00:36:55.356 A:middle
where I'm pretty happy with
them, I will have an animation

00:36:55.356 --> 00:36:56.256 A:middle
from the list to the map.

00:36:57.076 --> 00:36:59.996 A:middle
But to get an animation from
the map back to the list,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:04.686 A:middle
all I have to do is duplicate
that first slide, that list,

00:37:05.326 --> 00:37:07.596 A:middle
and place it at the
end as a third slide.

00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:11.456 A:middle
And now, without doing any extra
work, I have an animation back

00:37:11.456 --> 00:37:12.416 A:middle
in the other direction.

00:37:12.776 --> 00:37:14.576 A:middle
It's important to test
out both directions,

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:17.646 A:middle
and it really didn't
take much to do this.

00:37:18.996 --> 00:37:24.216 A:middle
So let's see what we
have after we've built

00:37:24.216 --> 00:37:25.036 A:middle
up all that animation.

00:37:25.596 --> 00:37:28.406 A:middle
In the back.

00:37:28.406 --> 00:37:32.046 A:middle
And I'll show it to
you a little slower

00:37:32.046 --> 00:37:33.166 A:middle
so you can see some
of the details.

00:37:33.166 --> 00:37:36.306 A:middle
Maybe this isn't as slow as we
would have it in the real app.

00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:42.876 A:middle
We did all of this without
having to write any code.

00:37:43.996 --> 00:37:46.646 A:middle
And you can see how - maybe some
of it is a little over the top.

00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:46.976 A:middle
Thank you.

Maybe some of it is a
little over the top.

00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:57.626 A:middle
But it's so much easier to
pare down and take away things

00:37:57.626 --> 00:37:59.136 A:middle
when you don't have
to throw away code.

00:37:59.326 --> 00:38:00.696 A:middle
It's just moving shapes around.

00:38:01.286 --> 00:38:03.136 A:middle
That's a really great way to try

00:38:03.136 --> 00:38:05.116 A:middle
out some really sophisticated
animations.

00:38:05.636 --> 00:38:11.356 A:middle
We also really like this
very graphical gallery view

00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:13.746 A:middle
that Linda called out
as pretty cool earlier.

00:38:13.886 --> 00:38:15.966 A:middle
I wanted to see how
it would work

00:38:16.446 --> 00:38:19.636 A:middle
if we have these angled plates
of toast and we zoom in on one

00:38:19.636 --> 00:38:20.956 A:middle
of them just to see
a detail view.

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:25.836 A:middle
And then back out.

00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:27.046 A:middle
When we tap the Back button.

00:38:27.626 --> 00:38:28.976 A:middle
And I'll show this to you
again a little slower.

So how did we build
this animation?

00:38:44.216 --> 00:38:46.436 A:middle
Well, it really was
not all that different

00:38:46.436 --> 00:38:48.546 A:middle
from the process I
showed you earlier.

00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:52.306 A:middle
That one piece of toast
that we zoom in on?

00:38:53.366 --> 00:38:57.206 A:middle
That's an angled image
behind all the other shapes.

00:38:58.716 --> 00:39:01.606 A:middle
The other pieces of
toast are similar images

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.716 --> 00:39:01.606 A:middle
The other pieces of
toast are similar images

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:03.396 A:middle
but they're masked
out and on top.

00:39:04.766 --> 00:39:06.646 A:middle
That navigation bar
that slides in?

00:39:06.786 --> 00:39:08.066 A:middle
That's a black rectangle

00:39:08.066 --> 00:39:10.476 A:middle
that we've shifted off
the top of the screen.

00:39:10.546 --> 00:39:13.586 A:middle
So, we shifted it off a little
ways up there so it slides

00:39:13.586 --> 00:39:15.166 A:middle
in a little bit later
in the animation.

00:39:15.706 --> 00:39:19.186 A:middle
And that detail view
of the toast?

00:39:19.756 --> 00:39:22.636 A:middle
That's that same toast
image rotated back straight,

00:39:22.636 --> 00:39:25.106 A:middle
made a bit larger.

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:29.756 A:middle
The other pieces of toast
are just shifted off the top

00:39:29.756 --> 00:39:30.616 A:middle
and bottom of the screen.

00:39:31.176 --> 00:39:32.396 A:middle
That's really all
there is to it.

00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:34.586 A:middle
It's moving some
images and shapes

00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:36.246 A:middle
around until you
get an animation

00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:38.406 A:middle
that feels pretty good.

00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.736 A:middle
So now that we've built
these animations in Keynote,

00:39:44.736 --> 00:39:48.226 A:middle
we're going to launch Keynote
on our iPod touch here.

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:52.246 A:middle
And either through iCloud
or email, however you prefer

00:39:52.246 --> 00:39:56.476 A:middle
to get them across, actually
open that same presentation

00:39:57.366 --> 00:40:01.336 A:middle
in our hand on the device to
get a sense for how it feels.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:57.366 --> 00:40:01.336 A:middle
in our hand on the device to
get a sense for how it feels.

00:40:03.046 --> 00:40:09.296 A:middle
We can hand it to someone
and see what they try to do.

00:40:09.536 --> 00:40:15.476 A:middle
Now, here you'll notice that
we're tapping on what seem

00:40:15.476 --> 00:40:16.606 A:middle
like interactive elements.

00:40:17.016 --> 00:40:18.556 A:middle
Those aren't actually
interactive.

00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:24.006 A:middle
It just so happens that you
can tap anywhere on the screen

00:40:24.066 --> 00:40:25.366 A:middle
to advance a sliding Keynote.

00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:28.346 A:middle
So you can kind of pretend that
the interactive elements work.

00:40:28.346 --> 00:40:30.126 A:middle
Of course, if you
tap anywhere else,

00:40:30.126 --> 00:40:31.516 A:middle
it's still going to
advance the slide.

00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:36.356 A:middle
Or you can still get a sense
for where people are trying

00:40:36.356 --> 00:40:38.506 A:middle
to interact with your
screens and animations

00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:40.596 A:middle
and what they expect to happen.

00:40:41.136 --> 00:40:45.966 A:middle
We can do a similar
thing with the tab bar.

00:40:57.946 --> 00:41:02.996 A:middle
And after we show people and
let them express what they think


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.946 --> 00:41:02.996 A:middle
And after we show people and
let them express what they think

00:41:03.266 --> 00:41:05.146 A:middle
these animations and
these screens are about,

00:41:05.656 --> 00:41:07.576 A:middle
we can ask them a couple
of questions to try

00:41:07.576 --> 00:41:09.166 A:middle
to get specific feedback.

00:41:11.296 --> 00:41:15.006 A:middle
So we ask if they know
how to find nearby toast.

00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:17.696 A:middle
Well, they were able to find
toast although they didn't

00:41:17.696 --> 00:41:19.216 A:middle
understand our placeholder
icons.

00:41:19.746 --> 00:41:22.806 A:middle
But that's fine because we knew
those icons were placeholders,

00:41:23.076 --> 00:41:26.666 A:middle
and if we decide to go in this
direction, we can refine them.

00:41:28.256 --> 00:41:30.846 A:middle
When we ask if it
was easy to switch

00:41:30.886 --> 00:41:32.016 A:middle
between these two screens,

00:41:33.566 --> 00:41:35.896 A:middle
certainly they were
able to use a tab bar.

00:41:35.896 --> 00:41:36.846 A:middle
They've seen those before.

00:41:36.846 --> 00:41:39.046 A:middle
They could tap at the
bottom and switch screens.

00:41:40.756 --> 00:41:44.626 A:middle
But when we asked, how
could we make this better?

00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:48.506 A:middle
That's where we got some
really interesting feedback.

00:41:49.276 --> 00:41:51.926 A:middle
Someone suggested they
might want to be able

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:56.216 A:middle
to see restaurant names while
they're looking at the map.

00:41:56.216 --> 00:41:58.026 A:middle
Another person suggested
they'd like to be able

00:41:58.026 --> 00:41:59.956 A:middle
to see the map while they're
looking at the ratings.

their own calculations

of highest-rated
but closest toast.

00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:09.866 A:middle

interesting bits of feedback,

00:42:10.256 --> 00:42:12.326 A:middle
and I think I'm going
to invite Mark

explore these interactively.

Let's have a look at
what we've learned

00:42:25.056 --> 00:42:26.166 A:middle
from the feedback so far.

00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:28.296 A:middle
What's working?

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:32.586 A:middle
The transitions between the
map and the list feel great.

do some really cool animations

single line of code.

What's not working?

of the information about toast.

So what other ideas
does this give us?

00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:55.026 A:middle

the map and the list

Is this really a good idea?

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:23.526 A:middle
If you think about it,
the map is only half

00:43:23.526 --> 00:43:26.196 A:middle
of its original size;
so is the list.

00:43:26.596 --> 00:43:28.036 A:middle
We have to pan the map more.

00:43:28.036 --> 00:43:30.336 A:middle
We have to scroll the
list more in order

00:43:30.336 --> 00:43:32.796 A:middle
to access the same
number of information.

00:43:36.456 --> 00:43:38.466 A:middle
To figure out whether
it's a right thing,

00:43:38.466 --> 00:43:39.646 A:middle
we need to really try it out,

00:43:39.926 --> 00:43:41.996 A:middle
and that's why we create
an interactive prototype.

00:43:42.756 --> 00:43:44.986 A:middle
We make another fake app.

00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:48.456 A:middle
And we start off by asking
what needs to be more real?

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:52.256 A:middle
Finding nearby toast on the
map needs to be more real,

00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:56.076 A:middle
and scanning the list for the
best toast should be more real.

00:43:56.286 --> 00:43:59.726 A:middle
We want to be able to pan
the map and scroll the list.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:00.536 --> 00:44:01.806 A:middle
Now, what can we fake?

00:44:02.266 --> 00:44:05.756 A:middle
What can we do to speed up our
process of making the prototype?

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:11.276 A:middle
We can fake the map and
the list by making -

00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:16.986 A:middle
using draggable images, but
more to - more about that later.

00:44:17.206 --> 00:44:18.596 A:middle
And where will we use our app?

00:44:18.596 --> 00:44:22.386 A:middle
Let's keep that in our mind
while we are creating our

00:44:22.386 --> 00:44:22.816 A:middle
fake app.

00:44:23.386 --> 00:44:27.076 A:middle
And of course in our case,
it's when we walk the streets

00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:30.916 A:middle
of San Francisco trying to
find the hippest toast in town.

00:44:32.056 --> 00:44:33.886 A:middle
Now making fake apps
is really easy.

00:44:34.836 --> 00:44:36.816 A:middle
We are following one
principal guideline.

00:44:38.226 --> 00:44:40.626 A:middle
That is, to make pictures
move in response to touches.

00:44:41.616 --> 00:44:45.246 A:middle
And one more thing, is to
make pictures move in response

00:44:45.246 --> 00:44:50.576 A:middle
to touches on the device
that you are prototyping for.

00:44:50.786 --> 00:44:54.176 A:middle
Use whatever you want
that can do this.

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:56.946 A:middle
If you are from a
web background,

00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:59.876 A:middle
you could use HTML,
CSS, a bit of jQuery.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:01.046 --> 00:45:04.056 A:middle
If you're a game developer
who happens to use Unity 3D,

00:45:04.526 --> 00:45:07.366 A:middle
it's another great program
to make some pictures move

00:45:07.366 --> 00:45:10.416 A:middle
around in response to touches.

00:45:10.586 --> 00:45:12.666 A:middle
Or, you could use Swift.

00:45:13.936 --> 00:45:15.566 A:middle
We are super excited
about Swift.

00:45:16.326 --> 00:45:18.686 A:middle
But today, we're going
to use Core Animation

00:45:18.976 --> 00:45:20.876 A:middle
and Xcode with Objective-C.

00:45:21.876 --> 00:45:23.776 A:middle
This is because that's
what we've been using

00:45:23.776 --> 00:45:25.416 A:middle
in our prototyping group so far.

00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:30.346 A:middle
Quick word about writing
code for our prototype:

00:45:31.306 --> 00:45:33.646 A:middle
It's different from
writing code for a real app.

00:45:33.646 --> 00:45:36.476 A:middle
The idea is not to engineer it,

00:45:36.866 --> 00:45:38.736 A:middle
just hack it together
as quick as you can.

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:42.476 A:middle
It doesn't have to be good
code or reusable code.

00:45:43.566 --> 00:45:46.226 A:middle
Because the idea is that
you make your prototype

00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:48.766 A:middle
to make a better decision
about whether you really want

00:45:48.766 --> 00:45:54.746 A:middle
to spend the time
engineering the real thing.

00:45:54.966 --> 00:45:58.876 A:middle
We generally use three steps to
build an interactive prototype.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:00.126 --> 00:46:02.716 A:middle
First step: Put the
picture on the device.

00:46:03.786 --> 00:46:06.406 A:middle
Once you have a picture on the
device, it's a good indicator

00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:10.026 A:middle
that you have got your
workflow sorted out.

00:46:10.296 --> 00:46:11.836 A:middle
Second step: Break
up the picture.

00:46:13.066 --> 00:46:16.026 A:middle
You want to prepare the picture
so you can apply interaction

00:46:16.366 --> 00:46:18.026 A:middle
to selected areas on the screen.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:22.856 A:middle
And third step: Move the
pictures when you touch them.

00:46:23.456 --> 00:46:25.486 A:middle
This is all about
implementing the interaction.

00:46:25.486 --> 00:46:26.146 A:middle
All right.

00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:31.086 A:middle
First step: Get the
picture on the device.

00:46:31.946 --> 00:46:33.986 A:middle
We create our picture
in Keynote.

00:46:34.846 --> 00:46:36.876 A:middle
And the one thing we have
to consider is that we work

00:46:37.266 --> 00:46:39.766 A:middle
to the actual pixel
dimensions of the device.

00:46:40.716 --> 00:46:44.216 A:middle
We export our slides
as a PNG and save it

00:46:44.216 --> 00:46:49.026 A:middle
into the folder structure
of our Xcode project.

00:46:49.126 --> 00:46:50.876 A:middle
Now it's time to write
a little bit of code.

00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:53.556 A:middle
And what you see here
is the setup function

00:46:53.556 --> 00:46:54.786 A:middle
in a classical screen.

00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:58.606 A:middle
Now, another class that you
will see a lot, in our case,

00:46:58.606 --> 00:46:59.566 A:middle
is a class called Layer.

00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:02.676 A:middle
And for those of you who
know about coordination,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:02.676 A:middle
And for those of you who
know about coordination,

00:47:03.176 --> 00:47:06.116 A:middle
it simply just inherits
from UIImageView.

00:47:06.436 --> 00:47:09.106 A:middle
So it also has got all the
functionality of UIView.

00:47:09.846 --> 00:47:13.116 A:middle
All we did is add a little
bit of convenience functions

00:47:13.866 --> 00:47:16.376 A:middle
to make our lives easier
to position a layer

00:47:16.986 --> 00:47:18.876 A:middle
and to load an image
into that layer.

00:47:19.516 --> 00:47:23.936 A:middle
So by default, we have
a Layer called screen.

00:47:24.256 --> 00:47:26.586 A:middle
It stretches across the
whole of the physical screen.

00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:30.226 A:middle
And so to get our
picture onto our screen,

00:47:30.366 --> 00:47:32.836 A:middle
we create another
Layer called picture

00:47:34.316 --> 00:47:36.856 A:middle
and we load our image into it.

00:47:38.176 --> 00:47:39.346 A:middle
That's it.

00:47:40.196 --> 00:47:44.466 A:middle
We press Play in
Xcode and here it is.

00:47:45.816 --> 00:47:47.066 A:middle
Our first Fake App.

00:47:48.336 --> 00:47:49.796 A:middle
Looks pretty real
already doesn't it?

00:47:50.516 --> 00:47:53.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:47:54.186 --> 00:47:54.766 A:middle
Thanks. All right.

00:47:54.766 --> 00:47:55.936 A:middle
Let's get to our second step.

00:47:56.866 --> 00:47:58.066 A:middle
We want to break up the picture.

00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:03.446 A:middle
In our case, we break it up into
a navigation bar into an image


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:03.446 A:middle
In our case, we break it up into
a navigation bar into an image

00:48:03.446 --> 00:48:06.556 A:middle
of a list and an image of a map.

00:48:06.756 --> 00:48:07.836 A:middle
Let's start with the list.

00:48:09.146 --> 00:48:10.186 A:middle
I use Keynote again.

00:48:11.126 --> 00:48:13.616 A:middle
And Linda showed how you can
really quickly create a fake

00:48:13.616 --> 00:48:14.516 A:middle
image of a list.

00:48:14.986 --> 00:48:18.976 A:middle
Now this time we want to apply
some interaction to the image.

00:48:19.256 --> 00:48:22.226 A:middle
We want to be able to scroll
the image up and down.

00:48:22.226 --> 00:48:24.636 A:middle
So let's make sure
that it's much longer

00:48:24.636 --> 00:48:26.986 A:middle
than the screen height
of our device.

00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:34.506 A:middle
Next thing, we want to
create a fake image of a map.

00:48:35.806 --> 00:48:36.746 A:middle
Where do I get it from?

00:48:37.596 --> 00:48:40.336 A:middle
We improvise a little bit.

00:48:40.536 --> 00:48:41.956 A:middle
I've got the OS X Maps App.

00:48:41.956 --> 00:48:42.986 A:middle
I open it up.

00:48:43.056 --> 00:48:43.916 A:middle
Make it full screen.

00:48:43.916 --> 00:48:44.646 A:middle
Take a screenshot.

00:48:45.146 --> 00:48:46.156 A:middle
Put it in to Keynote.

00:48:46.376 --> 00:48:46.996 A:middle
And there it is.

00:48:48.206 --> 00:48:51.066 A:middle
We also want to display a
few shared toasts on the map.

00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:56.096 A:middle
So, let's sprinkle a few
icons onto my toast map.

00:48:57.116 --> 00:48:58.886 A:middle
Just kind of in an
artisanal way.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:00.026 --> 00:49:02.946 A:middle
No need to be precise or work
with latitude, longitude values.

00:49:03.706 --> 00:49:04.536 A:middle
Just get it done.

00:49:05.846 --> 00:49:07.286 A:middle
Again, make sure
it's large enough

00:49:07.286 --> 00:49:09.886 A:middle
so we can implement some
direct behavior on it.

00:49:10.706 --> 00:49:13.936 A:middle
And fast forward, here we have
our three discrete images.

00:49:14.526 --> 00:49:17.566 A:middle
Now it's time to
rearrange the images

00:49:17.566 --> 00:49:19.006 A:middle
so they become one screen again.

00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:24.016 A:middle
Same type of code,
create a Layer called Map,

00:49:24.016 --> 00:49:26.236 A:middle
load my map image, position
it a little roughly.

00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:31.276 A:middle
Create another list layer -
or a Layer called List rather.

00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:34.666 A:middle
And this time, I'm going
to position it roughly

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:36.996 A:middle
down half of the screen height.

00:49:37.746 --> 00:49:40.306 A:middle
And I realize actually, OK,
it already masks my map.

00:49:41.786 --> 00:49:43.776 A:middle
And so does the Navigation
bar at the top.

00:49:44.826 --> 00:49:47.876 A:middle
Cool, we are ready to go.

00:49:48.126 --> 00:49:51.346 A:middle
Let's make some pictures
move when you touch them.

00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:55.686 A:middle
Now I want to talk to you
about the drag image behavior.

00:49:56.836 --> 00:50:02.976 A:middle
What happens is, you hit the
map, a touchdown event happens.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:56.836 --> 00:50:02.976 A:middle
What happens is, you hit the
map, a touchdown event happens.

00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:05.736 A:middle
Then you move your finger

00:50:05.896 --> 00:50:09.736 A:middle
and you get a series
of TouchMove events.

00:50:10.176 --> 00:50:11.446 A:middle
And on each TouchMove events,

00:50:11.636 --> 00:50:14.456 A:middle
we are actually moving the
underlying image with it.

00:50:15.656 --> 00:50:17.556 A:middle
And the last event
is a TouchUp event.

00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:19.346 A:middle
I lift off my finger.

00:50:20.006 --> 00:50:26.816 A:middle
Now in order to make that
image move, we essentially go

00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:29.516 A:middle
into each-- well, within
each TouchMove event,

00:50:29.936 --> 00:50:32.086 A:middle
we can deduct the
data translation

00:50:32.086 --> 00:50:33.776 A:middle
between the previous
touch position

00:50:34.136 --> 00:50:35.366 A:middle
and the current touch position,

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:38.016 A:middle
and that's what we
used to move the image.

00:50:39.516 --> 00:50:42.186 A:middle
It probably becomes
more clear in code.

00:50:43.596 --> 00:50:45.866 A:middle
So, this is a bit of -
this is the code block

00:50:45.966 --> 00:50:48.786 A:middle
that gets called every time
a TouchMove event happens

00:50:48.786 --> 00:50:50.366 A:middle
on our Map layer.

00:50:52.076 --> 00:50:55.396 A:middle
What we do there is we
get our touch object.

00:50:55.736 --> 00:50:58.246 A:middle
From there, we can retrieve
the current touch position

00:50:58.246 --> 00:50:59.646 A:middle
and the previous touch position.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:00.146 --> 00:51:03.116 A:middle
And we calculate our delta

00:51:03.116 --> 00:51:06.156 A:middle
by subtracting the
previous touch position

00:51:06.156 --> 00:51:11.106 A:middle
from the current touch position
and add it to our map position.

00:51:11.466 --> 00:51:13.086 A:middle
And we do the same
thing for the list.

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:15.736 A:middle
But in this case, we only
apply the translation

00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:20.146 A:middle
to the y-coordinate because
we are just going up and down.

00:51:20.346 --> 00:51:21.596 A:middle
Quick look at how it looks like.

00:51:22.526 --> 00:51:27.736 A:middle
Cool, we can drag the map,
and we can scroll the list.

00:51:28.826 --> 00:51:29.976 A:middle
Now, we have cheated a bit here.

00:51:30.496 --> 00:51:31.766 A:middle
You can see a little
bit of inertia,

00:51:31.766 --> 00:51:33.926 A:middle
and we're also constraining
some movement

00:51:34.276 --> 00:51:35.606 A:middle
with some bit of
a spring behavior.

00:51:36.256 --> 00:51:37.666 A:middle
If you're interested in that,

00:51:37.806 --> 00:51:42.536 A:middle
you can download our Xcode
project after this session.

00:51:42.696 --> 00:51:43.376 A:middle
Let's move on.

00:51:43.376 --> 00:51:50.216 A:middle
I want to divert a little bit
to the part of our prototype

00:51:50.656 --> 00:51:52.156 A:middle
where we can share a toast.

00:51:53.066 --> 00:51:54.856 A:middle
So the idea is that you take
a picture of your toast,

00:51:54.856 --> 00:51:55.446 A:middle
you add a little bit

00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:57.546 A:middle
of information, and
then you post it.

00:51:58.096 --> 00:52:00.826 A:middle
First thing is I
need a camera view.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.096 --> 00:52:00.826 A:middle
First thing is I
need a camera view.

00:52:01.386 --> 00:52:05.876 A:middle
For now, I'll just hide it at
the lower edge of the screen.

00:52:06.346 --> 00:52:07.356 A:middle
And now, I need a button.

00:52:08.116 --> 00:52:11.516 A:middle
But I realized Linda already
created a lovely Plus button

00:52:11.746 --> 00:52:12.816 A:middle
in my navigation bar.

00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:17.586 A:middle
So what I do is, I
hook up a TouchUp event

00:52:17.586 --> 00:52:19.066 A:middle
onto my Navigation bar.

00:52:19.426 --> 00:52:21.576 A:middle
And so, when you tap
that Plus button,

00:52:22.146 --> 00:52:23.676 A:middle
it will trigger this
line of code

00:52:23.756 --> 00:52:25.626 A:middle
which animates the
camera image back in.

00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:29.816 A:middle
And this is just an example
of how your code doesn't have

00:52:29.816 --> 00:52:33.006 A:middle
to be beautiful, but you can
just hack things together

00:52:33.006 --> 00:52:34.306 A:middle
with what you've
got on the screen.

00:52:34.306 --> 00:52:37.396 A:middle
Here it is.

00:52:37.606 --> 00:52:41.586 A:middle
Tap the Plus button, you
see the camera image.

00:52:42.766 --> 00:52:45.166 A:middle
Now, you saw probably that
there was a live camera preview.

00:52:46.346 --> 00:52:49.276 A:middle
We added that to add a
little bit of realness to it.

00:52:49.506 --> 00:52:50.336 A:middle
But that's where we stop.

00:52:50.856 --> 00:52:53.376 A:middle
When you press or tap
the Shutter button,

00:52:53.726 --> 00:52:56.006 A:middle
we switch to a fake
image of a toast.

00:52:56.486 --> 00:52:59.846 A:middle
And that's what we
continue with.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:00.206 --> 00:53:06.086 A:middle
You add a few information
about your toast and post it.

00:53:08.026 --> 00:53:10.906 A:middle
Now how did we do the
keyboard typing sequence?

00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:15.396 A:middle
Probably already gave it away.

00:53:16.906 --> 00:53:19.976 A:middle
Of course, we just used
a sequence of images.

00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:22.031 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:53:22.046 --> 00:53:24.836 A:middle
I didn't bother about using
any dynamic text fields

00:53:24.946 --> 00:53:26.606 A:middle
or a keyboard sliding in.

00:53:27.866 --> 00:53:30.716 A:middle
I did all of these images just
from one slide in Keynote.

00:53:31.816 --> 00:53:34.146 A:middle
And this brings us back actually
to what we're actually doing.

00:53:34.976 --> 00:53:38.686 A:middle
So, we're creating a prototype
by making pictures move

00:53:38.686 --> 00:53:39.906 A:middle
in response to touches.

00:53:40.346 --> 00:53:45.236 A:middle
And we're doing this to help
us make better decisions

00:53:45.236 --> 00:53:47.686 A:middle
about whether we really
want to pursue an idea.

00:53:48.946 --> 00:53:52.346 A:middle
And part of this
decision making process is

00:53:52.846 --> 00:53:54.406 A:middle
to show your prototype
to people.

00:53:54.986 --> 00:53:58.386 A:middle
And if it's an interactive
prototype, it's really important

00:53:58.386 --> 00:54:00.196 A:middle
that you let people
try it out with

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:58.386 --> 00:54:00.196 A:middle
that you let people
try it out with

00:54:00.196 --> 00:54:01.896 A:middle
as little explanation
as possible.

00:54:02.296 --> 00:54:03.996 A:middle
The first impressions
are really important.

00:54:04.426 --> 00:54:08.416 A:middle
Look at where people are
struggling with the interactions

00:54:08.416 --> 00:54:12.326 A:middle
that you created, and also
look at what delights them.

00:54:13.456 --> 00:54:15.896 A:middle
And ask some questions
like, "Do you know how

00:54:15.896 --> 00:54:17.976 A:middle
to find nearby toast
or top toast?"

00:54:19.106 --> 00:54:22.766 A:middle
So value your feedback
is one which is critical.

00:54:23.256 --> 00:54:25.106 A:middle
"Is the toast on the map
and the list the same?"

00:54:25.836 --> 00:54:27.736 A:middle
This is something we
didn't really think

00:54:27.736 --> 00:54:31.316 A:middle
about when we had our genius
idea of putting the map

00:54:31.316 --> 00:54:33.146 A:middle
and the list onto one screen.

00:54:33.906 --> 00:54:36.606 A:middle
Something we should resolve
before we build the real thing.

00:54:37.016 --> 00:54:39.976 A:middle
"Is it easy to explore toasts?"

00:54:40.516 --> 00:54:41.486 A:middle
is another good question.

00:54:42.986 --> 00:54:46.186 A:middle
And ask for suggestions, "How
can we make this better?"

00:54:47.056 --> 00:54:49.736 A:middle
"I wish I could sort a toast
in a few more different ways."

00:54:49.736 --> 00:54:51.626 A:middle
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:54:51.776 --> 00:54:55.946 A:middle
Not everyone wants to spend $4
or more for a slice of bread.

00:54:57.316 --> 00:54:59.476 A:middle
By this, I want to
reintroduce Jeff

00:54:59.606 --> 00:55:02.666 A:middle

session and conclude it.

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:03.046 A:middle
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mark.

[ Applause ]

00:55:09.046 --> 00:55:10.526 A:middle
So, we learned some
very important things

00:55:10.526 --> 00:55:13.986 A:middle
from Mark's interactive
prototype.

00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:16.866 A:middle
Quick recap.

00:55:17.246 --> 00:55:18.056 A:middle
Drew a bunch of pictures,

00:55:19.326 --> 00:55:21.746 A:middle
then we saw how the pictures
worked together using some

00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:25.086 A:middle
animations, and then we built
an interactive prototype.

00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:27.636 A:middle
So, we could see how the
whole thing worked together

00:55:27.636 --> 00:55:28.176 A:middle
in our hand.

00:55:28.176 --> 00:55:31.666 A:middle
Now, a couple of quick
comparisons to hit this home.

00:55:32.406 --> 00:55:35.086 A:middle
This screen on the right
takes a lot of real code.

00:55:35.856 --> 00:55:38.776 A:middle
For our prototype, all we did
was move a picture around in 2D

00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:39.966 A:middle
and move a list up and down.

00:55:40.356 --> 00:55:41.206 A:middle
That was really quick.

00:55:42.076 --> 00:55:44.926 A:middle
This grid view of toast
would've taken a whole bunch

00:55:44.926 --> 00:55:45.806 A:middle
of real code.

00:55:45.896 --> 00:55:48.776 A:middle
For our prototype, we
just made a quick drawing,

00:55:49.086 --> 00:55:51.806 A:middle
which was enough to realize
that this concept sucked.

00:55:53.056 --> 00:55:55.016 A:middle
What have we learned today?

00:55:55.526 --> 00:55:57.726 A:middle
Well, we prototyped with
pictures, and we learned how

00:55:57.726 --> 00:56:00.186 A:middle
to take screenshots, mask
them and rearrange them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:57.726 --> 00:56:00.186 A:middle
to take screenshots, mask
them and rearrange them

00:56:00.376 --> 00:56:01.846 A:middle
so we can make a lot
of different options.

00:56:02.176 --> 00:56:06.266 A:middle
We prototyped with
animations, and we learned how

00:56:06.266 --> 00:56:09.126 A:middle
to animate pictures using
Magic Move and Keynote

00:56:09.476 --> 00:56:11.566 A:middle
so we could see how different
screens work together.

00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:15.646 A:middle
And, we prototyped
with interactions,

00:56:15.826 --> 00:56:18.876 A:middle
and we made pictures move on the
screen in response to touches

00:56:19.346 --> 00:56:21.276 A:middle
so we could see how the
whole thing felt together.

00:56:22.556 --> 00:56:23.366 A:middle
Why do we do this?

00:56:23.666 --> 00:56:25.126 A:middle
Two reasons, hope
that you'll remember.

00:56:25.576 --> 00:56:29.196 A:middle
Number one is to test ideas, and
number two is to get new ideas.

00:56:29.536 --> 00:56:30.706 A:middle
And how do we do it?

00:56:30.786 --> 00:56:32.386 A:middle
This one I really hope
you guys remember.

00:56:33.046 --> 00:56:37.686 A:middle
Make fake apps, show people
and learn from their feedback.

00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:41.996 A:middle
And do that over and over
again until the experience

00:56:41.996 --> 00:56:43.536 A:middle
of your app feels great.

00:56:44.086 --> 00:56:47.896 A:middle
So here's what I want all
of you to go and do now.

If you're a developer
at a company,

I want you to tell
your management

00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:54.466 A:middle
that prototyping
saves time and money

00:56:54.746 --> 00:56:57.966 A:middle
by helping you build
the right things.

I want you to draw, animate

If you're a solo developer,
I want you to draw, animate

00:57:01.816 --> 00:57:04.186 A:middle
and hack before you go
and build something.

And if you can't
code it all - again,

00:57:07.516 --> 00:57:10.746 A:middle
thank you for coming
- draw and animate.

00:57:10.746 --> 00:57:14.116 A:middle
You don't need code yet, but the
person next to you might be able

00:57:14.116 --> 00:57:14.936 A:middle
to help you with that part.

00:57:16.346 --> 00:57:19.736 A:middle
Designers, don't just draw
pictures, also make animated

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:22.406 A:middle
and interactive things to
fully understand your designs.

00:57:23.726 --> 00:57:27.266 A:middle
And our management types,
please, go and make time

00:57:27.266 --> 00:57:29.676 A:middle
for your designers and
engineers to prototype.
