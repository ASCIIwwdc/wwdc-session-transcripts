00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:16.000 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:16.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.166 A:middle
Thanks for coming
out this morning.

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:21.626 A:middle
And welcome to another
installment

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:23.746 A:middle
of the UIScrollView
Session here today.

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.886 A:middle
We've talked a few
times in previous years

00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:29.566 A:middle
about things related to event
handling in UIScrollView.

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:34.656 A:middle
But we want to take a little bit
more time to go deeper into some

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.236 A:middle
of the details of
event handling on iOS.

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.536 A:middle
How it interacts
with UIScrollView.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.416 A:middle
How UIScrollView uses it.

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:44.106 A:middle
And how you can do interesting
things once you know more

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.546 A:middle
about it in your own apps.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.696 A:middle
So before we get
too much into that,

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.266 A:middle
I want to take a brief
walk down the history

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.016 A:middle
of touch handling
in UIScrollView.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:55.936 A:middle
So we'll start out by
going all the way back

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.326 A:middle
to the beginning
of time in 2008.

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:05.126 A:middle
With the introduction of iPhone
OS 2.0 and the first public SDK.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:05.126 A:middle
With the introduction of iPhone
OS 2.0 and the first public SDK.

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.526 A:middle
Where US ScrollView was
built entirely on top

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.476 A:middle
of the UITouch API
with touchesBegan,

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:12.796 A:middle
moved, ended, and cancelled.

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.546 A:middle
And it was built in the same way

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.096 A:middle
that you would have
written any other bit

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:19.096 A:middle
of code using those
UITouch APIs.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.086 A:middle
And it had a few
limitations that all

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.186 A:middle
of you folks were trying to work

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:26.536 A:middle
around by subclassing
UIScrollView

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.326 A:middle
and overriding those
touch methods.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.786 A:middle
And it was difficult to
do some of these things

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.146 A:middle
because you didn't necessarily
know how the internals

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:34.686 A:middle
of UIScrollView itself worked.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:36.766 A:middle
And so there were
attempts to add things

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.546 A:middle
like Nested ScrollView Support.

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.366 A:middle
Putting one ScrollView
inside another.

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:44.106 A:middle
And this was much harder than
it probably should have been,

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:48.796 A:middle
so a year later, in 2009, we
had a big update to UIScrollView

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:53.236 A:middle
that changed pretty much
everything about how it looked

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.596 A:middle
at touches and used
those touches.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:57.676 A:middle
And right out of the
box it added support

00:01:57.676 --> 00:01:59.556 A:middle
for nesting one ScrollView
inside another

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.656 A:middle
so that you didn't have to do
any of that work or subclassing

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.656 A:middle
so that you didn't have to do
any of that work or subclassing

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.546 A:middle
or understanding internals
in order to make that happen.

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:07.716 A:middle
And then later that
year we introduced the

00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:11.626 A:middle
UIGestureRecognizer API which
really exposed the internals

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:13.966 A:middle
of how UIScrollView had
started doing these things,

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.756 A:middle
and let you add that
kind of support

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.256 A:middle
into other views
in your own apps.

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:23.406 A:middle
Then in 2010, with iOS 4.0 there
was another fairly big update

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:26.506 A:middle
with the release of the
iPhone 4 and retina displays.

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:29.476 A:middle
Now the interesting thing
that happened here is

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:33.156 A:middle
that because each dimension
of the screen doubled

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:36.136 A:middle
in pixel density, it meant
that there was more precision

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:37.846 A:middle
that you could get when
positioning elements.

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:40.456 A:middle
Now for most things you
still position things

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.356 A:middle
on point boundaries,
so that you could run

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:45.656 A:middle
across different iOS devices
that were either 1X or 2X.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:48.366 A:middle
But US ScrollView added
support for scrolling

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:50.516 A:middle
at half point boundaries
so that it could scroll

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:52.336 A:middle
to individual pixel granularity.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.096 A:middle
Which gave a much, much
smoother scrolling experience.

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:58.826 A:middle
A year later with iOS
5, we added support

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:01.266 A:middle
for exposing those
gesture recognizers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:01.266 A:middle
for exposing those
gesture recognizers

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.356 A:middle
that we had previously
updated and used

00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.416 A:middle
to add these more advanced
scrolling techniques

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.316 A:middle
onto UIScrollView.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:11.006 A:middle
And once these gestures were
exposed, it made it a lot easier

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.296 A:middle
to interact with the
ScrollView in your own apps.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.016 A:middle
So you could do things like
get the pan gesture recognizer

00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:18.056 A:middle
and set up failure
requirements against it,

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:19.676 A:middle
or do all kinds of
things like that.

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:21.356 A:middle
And if you go back to
previous years' sessions,

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
you can see a number of
places where we've talked

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:24.526 A:middle
about how you can do
that sort of thing.

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.976 A:middle
So a lot of interesting things
became possible once you had

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:30.146 A:middle
access to the gesture
recognizers themselves.

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.986 A:middle
But in 2012 with iOS 6,

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:38.416 A:middle
there was another fairly large
internal update to UIScrollView

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:40.536 A:middle
that added support
for resting touches.

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:44.086 A:middle
And so what I mean by this
is that in previous years,

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
prior to iOS 6, if you put a
finger down on a UIScrollView ,

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:49.946 A:middle
that was the finger the
ScrollView was going

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:50.966 A:middle
to track for scrolling.

00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:53.756 A:middle
So if you did something like
grab an iPad around the edge,

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.536 A:middle
and your thumb happened to land
on a ScrollView, you would try

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:58.426 A:middle
and scroll with another finger
and nothing would happen

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:00.166 A:middle
because it was tracking
that first finger.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:00.166 A:middle
because it was tracking
that first finger.

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.886 A:middle
Now with iOS 6 we started
looking at all of the touches

00:04:03.886 --> 00:04:05.386 A:middle
that were anywhere
in the ScrollView

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:07.006 A:middle
and only paying attention
to the ones

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:08.846 A:middle
that were actually
moving at any given time.

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.246 A:middle
So even if you had a touch
sitting there resting

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:12.826 A:middle
and not going anywhere,
it didn't prevent you

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.296 A:middle
from scrolling, and you
could still interact

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.236 A:middle
with other fingers.

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:18.565 A:middle
So that was a really big
and interesting update,

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:20.266 A:middle
and we'll see some
ways that we are going

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:21.606 A:middle
to take advantage
of that later today.

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:24.966 A:middle
And finally last year with
iOS 7, we added support

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
for dismissing the
keyboard using UIScrollView.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:28.486 A:middle
And there was a new property

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:30.156 A:middle
that you may have noticed
was added last year

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.856 A:middle
that lets you decide whether
or not scrolling a scroll view

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.806 A:middle
and having a finger intersect
the keyboard will push it

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:36.646 A:middle
down off the screen.

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:39.006 A:middle
So over the years,

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:42.116 A:middle
the UIScrollView API has
remained fairly stable.

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:44.336 A:middle
There haven't been a lot
of changes in the API.

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.776 A:middle
But under the covers
there have been a lot

00:04:46.776 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
of internal touch
handling changes

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.626 A:middle
that have added all
sorts of new things

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:53.386 A:middle
that you can do once
you know about how some

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:54.786 A:middle
of these internals
of the ScrollView

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:56.286 A:middle
and touch handling on iOS work.

00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:59.656 A:middle
So we're going to take
a look at three areas

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:00.506 A:middle
of touch handling today.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:00.506 A:middle
of touch handling today.

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:03.396 A:middle
And then we're going to
talk about three things

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.916 A:middle
that you can do once you
know about these bits

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.306 A:middle
of touch handling information.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:11.616 A:middle
So three techniques based on
three areas of touch handling.

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.296 A:middle
And those types of touch
handling things we'll talk

00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:16.806 A:middle
about -- well first off we're
going to start with Hit Testing.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.976 A:middle
Because Hit Testing is
the most fundamental part

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:20.216 A:middle
of handling touches on iOS.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.186 A:middle
When a finger comes down on
the screen, what got hit?

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:24.896 A:middle
And what element are you
trying to interact with?

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:27.616 A:middle
So we'll look a little bit
more deeply at how it works,

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:30.426 A:middle
and ways that you can adjust
things during Hit Testing

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:31.746 A:middle
to get interesting behaviors.

00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:34.356 A:middle
Then we'll spend
some time talking

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:35.726 A:middle
about UIGestureRecognizer.

00:05:36.156 --> 00:05:38.076 A:middle
Now this is something we've
talked about many times

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.956 A:middle
in the past in various
different sessions.

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:41.846 A:middle
But we have some
new, interesting ways

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:43.306 A:middle
that you can use
Gesture Recognizers,

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:45.796 A:middle
along with your ScrollViews
that will give you some ideas

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:47.346 A:middle
about things you
can do in your apps.

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.536 A:middle
So we'll get to that
later today.

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:51.136 A:middle
And then we're going to
talk about touch delivery.

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:54.006 A:middle
So the way that touches
flow through the system.

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.106 A:middle
Get delivered to views.

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:56.796 A:middle
Interact with Gesture
Recognizers.

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.846 A:middle
And how you can take
advantage of that information

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:01.946 A:middle
in other interesting ways once
we get to our three techniques.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:01.946 A:middle
in other interesting ways once
we get to our three techniques.

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:04.566 A:middle
So how about those
three techniques?

00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:07.166 A:middle
We're going to talk about
transparent overlays.

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:09.846 A:middle
Putting content on top
of your other content

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:12.226 A:middle
and making sure you can still
interact with everything

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:14.026 A:middle
and things don't end
up behaving strangely.

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:17.136 A:middle
We'll talk about
dragging while scrolling.

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:19.736 A:middle
This is something that I
actually find pretty exciting

00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:22.226 A:middle
and think is a really cool thing
you can do with ScrollViews.

00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:25.116 A:middle
So you can have content
in your ScrollView

00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:26.986 A:middle
that you interact with,
say something that you want

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.176 A:middle
to pick up and drag around.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:30.736 A:middle
But often you might
want to then be able

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:32.626 A:middle
to continue scrolling
with another finger.

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:35.476 A:middle
And I mentioned before that we
have this resting touch support,

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:37.016 A:middle
and ideas about how
you can interact

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:38.416 A:middle
with multiple fingers
on the ScrollView.

00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:41.386 A:middle
So we'll look at how you can use
that information to add support

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:43.876 A:middle
for dragging content while
also scrolling the ScrollView.

00:06:44.426 --> 00:06:47.136 A:middle
And then finally
we'll end by talking

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:48.536 A:middle
about highlighting objects.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:52.496 A:middle
Which may not seem at first
like a really key part,

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.356 A:middle
but part of the reason
it doesn't seem so key

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.006 A:middle
and interesting is because it
just often does the right thing

00:06:58.006 --> 00:06:58.986 A:middle
and you don't think about it.

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:01.346 A:middle
And so in places
where it doesn't,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:01.346 A:middle
And so in places
where it doesn't,

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:02.956 A:middle
you end up seeing
some jarring effects.

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.876 A:middle
And we'll talk about
how that happens

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:06.386 A:middle
and how we can go
about fixing it.

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:08.886 A:middle
And look at some internal
implementation ideas

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.166 A:middle
of how ScrollView has
taken Gesture Recognizers

00:07:11.636 --> 00:07:13.386 A:middle
to do interesting
things with highlights.

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:18.726 A:middle
So three areas of touch
handling and three techniques.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.736 A:middle
So let's get started with
transparent overlays.

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:24.366 A:middle
Of course if we're going to
put things on top of things,

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
that's probably going
to involve some sort

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:27.196 A:middle
of information about
Hit Testing.

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:28.396 A:middle
So we'll get into that.

00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:31.756 A:middle
But before we do, I just
want to give you a quick idea

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:34.626 A:middle
of the kind of thing I'm talking
about and where we use this sort

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:36.396 A:middle
of technique in iOS ourselves.

00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:40.116 A:middle
So let's take a look at the home
screen, where we added spotlight

00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:41.956 A:middle
in iOS 7 up at the
top of the screen.

00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:45.056 A:middle
And you can drag a finger down
and pull Spotlight down in

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:46.196 A:middle
from the top of the screen.

00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:49.176 A:middle
Believe it or not, this
is actually done using

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:50.016 A:middle
a UIScrollView.

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:54.016 A:middle
It's really more of a
transparent overlay ScrollView.

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.846 A:middle
It doesn't really
draw anything itself.

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.506 A:middle
But it's an interesting
technique, and we'll take a look

00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:00.296 A:middle
at how we can use
this in our own apps.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:00.296 A:middle
at how we can use
this in our own apps.

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:03.126 A:middle
So before I get too much into
the details of how it works

00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:04.816 A:middle
or take you through slides
or anything, we're just going

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:06.496 A:middle
to have Eliza come
up and do a demo

00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:08.856 A:middle
to show you what
we're going to build.

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:15.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:18.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. All right.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:20.826 A:middle
So I've got a little app here
that I've started building.

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:22.336 A:middle
It doesn't do very much yet.

00:08:22.686 --> 00:08:26.446 A:middle
It draws a bunch of dots in a
canvas, and soon we're going

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:28.216 A:middle
to add support for
dragging them around.

00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:31.496 A:middle
But for now, the
dots highlight --

00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:34.426 A:middle
I hope you can see that
-- in touchesBegan.

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:36.196 A:middle
And then they un-highlight
in Touches Ended

00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:37.076 A:middle
and Touches Cancelled.

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:42.986 A:middle
So the first thing that I want
to do here is add a drawer

00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:44.566 A:middle
that you can pull
down over the top

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.546 A:middle
by panning anywhere
in the canvas.

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.656 A:middle
And so in order to do
that we're going to need

00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:53.586 A:middle
to add a ScrollView that
covers the entire canvas.

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:56.816 A:middle
So I'm going to switch
over to the code,

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.956 A:middle
and you can see this
is pretty much it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:02.586 A:middle
I've got a little DotView class

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:07.386 A:middle
that can make a random
DotView that's a random color.

00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:11.656 A:middle
And I've got a canvasView
that has 25 dots added to it

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:14.276 A:middle
and they're arranged
randomly in the view.

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is add a ScrollView.

00:09:18.436 --> 00:09:20.106 A:middle
And I'm also going
to add a drawerView.

00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:22.686 A:middle
And what we're going to do is
take advantage of the new API

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:26.026 A:middle
that was added in iOS
8, UIVisualEffectsView,

00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:27.966 A:middle
which allows you to
create blurry content

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:29.156 A:middle
in your applications.

00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:31.346 A:middle
And so since this drawer
is going to cover part

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:34.296 A:middle
of the screen, we'll get a sense
of depth by making it blurry.

00:09:35.566 --> 00:09:38.886 A:middle
So go ahead and make these guys.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:43.246 A:middle
So our ScrollView gets
added to the view.

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:48.356 A:middle
The drawerView is going to be a
UIVisualEffectView initialized

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:48.976 A:middle
with an effect.

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:53.396 A:middle
The effect I want is a dark
blur, so I'm going to ask

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:56.186 A:middle
for a UIBlurEffect
effectWithStyle

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:57.816 A:middle
BlurEffectStyleDark.

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:02.106 A:middle
I need to choose a
frame for my drawerView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:02.106 A:middle
I need to choose a
frame for my drawerView.

00:10:02.106 --> 00:10:04.196 A:middle
I'm going to make it
the width of the screen

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:07.476 A:middle
and 650 points tall --
because that looked good

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:08.086 A:middle
when I tried it out.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.896 A:middle
And I'm going to add it to
the ScrollView as a subview.

00:10:11.876 --> 00:10:14.416 A:middle
Okay. One more thing we need

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:17.766 A:middle
to do is tell the ScrollView
how big its content is.

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:21.706 A:middle
So I'm going to make a
content size which is the width

00:10:21.876 --> 00:10:24.546 A:middle
of the screen, but the height

00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:26.616 A:middle
of my bounds plus the
drawerViews frame.

00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:28.466 A:middle
And that will give
us enough room

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:30.746 A:middle
to scroll the drawerView
entirely off the screen

00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.016 A:middle
at the top.

00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:35.896 A:middle
And finally I'm going to set
a starting content offset

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:38.656 A:middle
to make the app launch with
the drawerView scrolled off

00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:39.086 A:middle
the screen.

00:10:40.036 --> 00:10:41.686 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and run it.

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:43.256 A:middle
All right.

00:10:43.256 --> 00:10:44.206 A:middle
So we've got our dots.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:47.996 A:middle
And now if I scroll I
get a blurry drawer.

00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:52.066 A:middle
Cool. Unfortunately I've
broken touch handling.

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:54.246 A:middle
So if I now scroll
the drawer away

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:56.516 A:middle
and I try to tap on these dots.

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:58.786 A:middle
I'm tapping; nothing's
happening.

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
So the reason for that might be
apparent if you think about it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
So the reason for that might be
apparent if you think about it.

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:05.046 A:middle
I've taken a big,
screen-sized UIScrollView

00:11:05.046 --> 00:11:06.236 A:middle
and I've plunked it down on top.

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.646 A:middle
So of course it's
blocking touch delivery

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:10.026 A:middle
to the content underneath.

00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:12.166 A:middle
Touches are going
to the ScrollView

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:13.666 A:middle
and that's what's
allowing me to pan.

00:11:13.926 --> 00:11:15.356 A:middle
All right.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.336 A:middle
So to fix it, what can we do?

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:21.506 A:middle
One thing you might consider
doing is turning off user

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:22.826 A:middle
interaction on the ScrollView.

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:25.666 A:middle
That's generally a pretty good
way of getting touches to pass

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:28.356 A:middle
through a user interface
element that you've added.

00:11:29.116 --> 00:11:32.046 A:middle
So let's try that.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:34.106 A:middle
ScrollView set
userIinteractionEnabled.

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:35.666 A:middle
No. Run it again.

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:41.026 A:middle
And now excellent touches
are now going to my dots

00:11:41.026 --> 00:11:44.056 A:middle
as they were before,
but if I try to scroll,

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:45.526 A:middle
of course nothing happens.

00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:46.616 A:middle
So why not?

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.896 A:middle
Well obviously I've
disabled user interaction

00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:51.036 A:middle
on the ScrollView
so it can't scroll.

00:11:51.436 --> 00:11:52.976 A:middle
All right so that's no good.

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:58.716 A:middle
So the way we're going
to actually fix this --

00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:00.516 A:middle
at least the way we're
going to start to fix it --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:00.516 A:middle
at least the way we're
going to start to fix it --

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:03.256 A:middle
is to use a technique
that Josh and I introduced

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
in a session two years
ago on open GL content,

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.226 A:middle
and it works here as well.

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:11.086 A:middle
You can take the
ScrollView's pan gesture --

00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:13.816 A:middle
which is exposed as a
property that you can access.

00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:18.136 A:middle
And you can move it onto another
view in order to restore panning

00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:20.976 A:middle
in a situation where the
ScrollView isn't suitable

00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:23.076 A:middle
to being the view that's
getting the touches.

00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:26.126 A:middle
So we're going to use that
technique here and we're going

00:12:26.126 --> 00:12:29.186 A:middle
to actually move the
ScrollView's pan gesture

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:33.316 A:middle
recognizer onto my
view controllers view.

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.796 A:middle
So onto the ScrollView's
superview.

00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:37.976 A:middle
This way the ScrollView
can continue

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:39.746 A:middle
to have its user
interaction disabled,

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:40.926 A:middle
but the panning will
be restored.

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:48.606 A:middle
So I've got touches
going to the dots.

00:12:48.866 --> 00:12:51.416 A:middle
And now I also have
panning working.

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:53.396 A:middle
So now it's kind
of starting to look

00:12:53.396 --> 00:12:56.536 A:middle
like we've got this overlaid
behavior the way we want it.

00:12:56.536 --> 00:12:59.596 A:middle
Let me go ahead and add some
additional dots in the drawer --

00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:03.086 A:middle
because we need something
in the drawer.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:03.086 A:middle
because we need something
in the drawer.

00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:06.636 A:middle
So I'm going to say add
20 dots to the drawerView.

00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:08.256 A:middle
Notice that when I do this I ask

00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.316 A:middle
for the drawerView's
content view.

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:14.496 A:middle
This is because the drawerView
is a UIVisualEffectsView.

00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:18.346 A:middle
And UIVisualEffectViews are
doing a lot of work in order

00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:19.456 A:middle
to make that blur happen.

00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:22.576 A:middle
And in order to avoid
and interfering with it,

00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:23.796 A:middle
you add additional content

00:13:23.826 --> 00:13:25.526 A:middle
into this content
view that they expose.

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:31.046 A:middle
And then in order to
differentiate the drawer

00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:33.336 A:middle
from the canvass, I'm going

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:36.026 A:middle
to arrange the dots
neatly in the drawerView.

00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:38.816 A:middle
All right so can run this.

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:40.526 A:middle
Pull the drawer down.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.336 A:middle
I've got my neatly
arranged dots.

00:13:43.526 --> 00:13:46.176 A:middle
I can interact with the
dots in the canvass,

00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:50.186 A:middle
but I can't interact with
the dots in the drawer.

00:13:50.186 --> 00:13:53.476 A:middle
And in fact moreover, if you
look through the drawer at this

00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:56.346 A:middle
like orange and blue guy here,
you can see that I can interact

00:13:56.346 --> 00:13:58.296 A:middle
with the dots that are
behind the drawer still.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.976 A:middle
All right so now why
is that happening?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.976 A:middle
All right so now why
is that happening?

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:05.296 A:middle
Well, I disabled user
interaction on the ScrollView

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:08.186 A:middle
and the drawerView and the
dots are in the ScrollView.

00:14:08.456 --> 00:14:11.636 A:middle
So touches are passing right
through the ScrollView,

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:14.046 A:middle
the drawerView, the dots
to the content behind it.

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:14.986 A:middle
Which is not what we want.

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:20.046 A:middle
So in this case, disabling
user interaction was kind

00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:21.076 A:middle
of too big a hammer.

00:14:21.176 --> 00:14:24.346 A:middle
It got most of the behavior
that we wanted, but now as soon

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:25.836 A:middle
as we want to interact
with something

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:28.096 A:middle
in that view hierarchy we can't.

00:14:28.146 --> 00:14:30.106 A:middle
So I'm going to turn
it back over to Josh

00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:32.906 A:middle
to explain a finer grain
technique that we can use

00:14:33.246 --> 00:14:34.786 A:middle
to get the behavior
that we want here.

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:41.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:42.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.446 A:middle
So we're getting closer.

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:46.046 A:middle
But as Eliza was mentioning,

00:14:46.046 --> 00:14:48.646 A:middle
we've just gone a little bit
too far with this disabling

00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:50.616 A:middle
of user interaction
on the ScrollView.

00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:53.146 A:middle
It got part of what we
wanted, but it went beyond

00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:54.426 A:middle
and did a little bit too much.

00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:58.096 A:middle
So to start figuring out how we
can be a little bit more precise

00:14:58.096 --> 00:14:59.926 A:middle
in what we're trying to
do, we have to take a look

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:01.166 A:middle
at how hitTesting works.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:01.166 A:middle
at how hitTesting works.

00:15:01.846 --> 00:15:04.206 A:middle
That is going to be using
the method hitTest:withEvent.

00:15:04.646 --> 00:15:07.696 A:middle
HitTest:withEvent is
the method that's used

00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:09.866 A:middle
when a new touch comes
down on screen to figure

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:11.996 A:middle
out what we should
deliver the touch to,

00:15:12.236 --> 00:15:14.776 A:middle
and what gesture recognizers
should end up being involved

00:15:14.776 --> 00:15:15.946 A:middle
in looking at that touch.

00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:19.296 A:middle
So before we look at how
we're going to use it,

00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:21.466 A:middle
let's talk a little
bit more specifically

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:23.046 A:middle
about what exactly it does.

00:15:23.846 --> 00:15:26.026 A:middle
And I want to do that by going
through and writing a little bit

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:29.006 A:middle
of pseudo code to just show you
the order of things it does,

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:30.096 A:middle
and how it goes about doing it.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.416 A:middle
So here I've got a swift
version of hitTest:withEvent.

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:39.676 A:middle
This is our, of course,
function syntax right there.

00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:41.596 A:middle
So the first thing

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:44.386 A:middle
that hitTest:withEvent does
is it checks to see whether

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:46.326 A:middle
or not the point being
passed in that you're trying

00:15:46.326 --> 00:15:48.566 A:middle
to hitTest is actually
within the view or not.

00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:51.816 A:middle
And it does that by
checking to see is this point

00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:53.366 A:middle
within my views bounds?

00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:56.416 A:middle
So if it is, than we're
going to do some other stuff.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.156 A:middle
If it's not, we just return nil.

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:00.926 A:middle
If the view finds that the point
it's being asked about isn't

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:00.926 A:middle
If the view finds that the point
it's being asked about isn't

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:03.446 A:middle
in its bounds, it
returns nil to indicate

00:16:03.446 --> 00:16:06.726 A:middle
that it's not interested
in this touch.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:07.666 A:middle
That point.

00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:14.696 A:middle
So then the next thing it
has to do is return itself

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:17.056 A:middle
if it actually was
in the bounds.

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.316 A:middle
So by default, if it
was in the bounds we

00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:20.756 A:middle
at least hit the view itself.

00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:22.886 A:middle
And that's where we were
running into trouble

00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.936 A:middle
with that transparent part
right at the beginning.

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:27.586 A:middle
Even though we weren't hitting
any subviews of the ScrollView

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.106 A:middle
and there was no content
there, as long as the touch was

00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:32.576 A:middle
within the ScrollView's
bounds, the ScrollView was going

00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.986 A:middle
to return itself as
the thing that got hit.

00:16:35.896 --> 00:16:38.806 A:middle
Now of course you can also
hitTest into subviews of a view.

00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:41.866 A:middle
So once we've decided that it's
actually within our bounds,

00:16:41.866 --> 00:16:44.296 A:middle
we're going to iterate through
all of our subviews and see

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:45.036 A:middle
if it's in any of them.

00:16:45.036 --> 00:16:47.646 A:middle
So we're going to go
through and add an inner loop

00:16:47.646 --> 00:16:49.446 A:middle
where we walk all
over our subviews.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:53.106 A:middle
Now importantly here we're going
to do this from back to front.

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.906 A:middle
Because if you think
about how rendering works,

00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:57.996 A:middle
we render the first subview
and then the next one

00:16:57.996 --> 00:17:00.006 A:middle
and then the next one, all
the way through to the end

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.996 --> 00:17:00.006 A:middle
and then the next one, all
the way through to the end

00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:01.066 A:middle
of the list of subviews.

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:03.716 A:middle
And so whatever one rendered
last, is visually on top.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.066 A:middle
So we want to perform the
hitTest in reverse order

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:08.165 A:middle
so that we would hit
the one on top first.

00:17:09.156 --> 00:17:11.096 A:middle
So we iterate backwards
through the subview list.

00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:15.616 A:middle
And ask each of our subviews
whether or not it got hit.

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:19.215 A:middle
So we call hitTest:withEvent
recursively on those subviews.

00:17:20.096 --> 00:17:22.516 A:middle
Now if one of them does return
something other than nil,

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:24.996 A:middle
we're just going to return
whatever it returned,

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.986 A:middle
and then that will
break the recursion.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:31.176 A:middle
So the first subview that were
to hit something, it would end

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.596 A:middle
up being returned as
the thing that got hit.

00:17:32.596 --> 00:17:35.336 A:middle
So that's pretty much
all there is to it.

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:36.266 A:middle
It's pretty straight forward.

00:17:36.936 --> 00:17:41.076 A:middle
I've also got a version
here in Objective C in case

00:17:41.076 --> 00:17:44.966 A:middle
that big difference was
too big of a difference.

00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:49.066 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:52.476 A:middle
So now let's take a look at
our sample app and figure

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:55.156 A:middle
out exactly how we can use this
information to get the behavior

00:17:55.156 --> 00:17:55.866 A:middle
that we're looking for.

00:17:56.546 --> 00:17:57.456 A:middle
Now first off we're going to go

00:17:57.456 --> 00:18:00.396 A:middle
and re-enable user
interaction on the ScrollView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.456 --> 00:18:00.396 A:middle
and re-enable user
interaction on the ScrollView.

00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:03.256 A:middle
Because we decided that that
was just not the right approach.

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:04.156 A:middle
It was too big of a hammer.

00:18:04.476 --> 00:18:05.896 A:middle
So everything we're going
to talk about right now,

00:18:05.896 --> 00:18:08.446 A:middle
we're going to assume that we've
turned user interaction back on,

00:18:09.036 --> 00:18:09.996 A:middle
and go back from there.

00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:12.836 A:middle
So let's start out by
looking at our view hierarchy.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.016 A:middle
We've got that
UIViewController's view.

00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:16.236 A:middle
It's the root view
in our hierarchy.

00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:19.296 A:middle
And then to that Eliza
added a dot view --

00:18:19.296 --> 00:18:21.156 A:middle
a container view that
has all the dots in it.

00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:23.736 A:middle
So we've got a direct
subview of the view controller

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:24.676 A:middle
that has all the dots.

00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:27.886 A:middle
Now that view has a
sibling, another subview

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:28.946 A:middle
of that view controller.

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:31.786 A:middle
And that's the UIScrollView.

00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:33.246 A:middle
So those are siblings.

00:18:33.316 --> 00:18:35.576 A:middle
But the UIScrollView is the
second in the subview order.

00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:37.856 A:middle
As we just talked in
hitTest, it's the one

00:18:37.856 --> 00:18:39.076 A:middle
that will get hitTested first.

00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:41.906 A:middle
And then we have a
subview with a ScrollView,

00:18:41.906 --> 00:18:42.846 A:middle
which is our drawerView.

00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:44.046 A:middle
That's inside the ScrollView.

00:18:45.076 --> 00:18:47.756 A:middle
So now let's take a look at
how touches flow through during

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:49.966 A:middle
that hitTest between all
these different views.

00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:52.326 A:middle
And to do so it will be a little
easier if we can see them all

00:18:52.326 --> 00:18:53.586 A:middle
at once, so I'm just
going to split it

00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:55.406 A:middle
out so we can take a look
at it as the touch comes

00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:56.446 A:middle
down and see what happens.

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:00.256 A:middle
Now first of all I'm going
to remove that DotView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:00.256 A:middle
Now first of all I'm going
to remove that DotView.

00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:01.926 A:middle
Because as we already mentioned,

00:19:01.926 --> 00:19:03.986 A:middle
as we're hitTesting we're
going from back to front.

00:19:04.196 --> 00:19:07.186 A:middle
And whichever one gets hit first
and returns something will end

00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:09.916 A:middle
up ending the recursion
and we won't iterate

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:10.796 A:middle
through the other subviews.

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:14.056 A:middle
So as it starts, we're never
going to even get touches going

00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:15.086 A:middle
to that DotView at all.

00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:16.886 A:middle
So let's look at it
without that first.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:20.826 A:middle
Now let's say a touch comes
down in the drawer area,

00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:22.246 A:middle
let's see what happens.

00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:23.696 A:middle
So a touch comes down up there.

00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:26.356 A:middle
We start out at the rootView
-- the view controllers view.

00:19:26.356 --> 00:19:29.186 A:middle
And then we work our way
through its subviews and we find

00:19:29.186 --> 00:19:30.886 A:middle
that this ScrollView is
going to hit something,

00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:32.386 A:middle
and it works through
its subviews.

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.836 A:middle
We find that the drawerView
is going to hit something.

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:37.546 A:middle
And then there's probably a
dot in there; or maybe not.

00:19:37.546 --> 00:19:38.636 A:middle
So -- but we're at
least going to end

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.836 A:middle
up returning the
drawerView; maybe the DotView.

00:19:40.976 --> 00:19:42.966 A:middle
So that part already
works; that was easy.

00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:44.106 A:middle
There was no problem there.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:47.316 A:middle
So now the issue came up when
we were in that transparent area

00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:48.736 A:middle
of the ScrollView,
that was farther down.

00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:50.846 A:middle
So a touch comes
down, down there.

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:53.846 A:middle
We start with a viewController.

00:19:53.846 --> 00:19:55.066 A:middle
Looks through its subviews.

00:19:55.426 --> 00:19:56.486 A:middle
Finds the ScrollView.

00:19:56.886 --> 00:19:58.706 A:middle
And even though there's
no content visually there,

00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.476 A:middle
it's in the bounds.

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
So it returns itself.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
So it returns itself.

00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:03.126 A:middle
And so that's the
place where we have

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:04.286 A:middle
to do something to fix this.

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.296 A:middle
And the fix actually
is pretty similar

00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:08.216 A:middle
to what I've just said there.

00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
It returns itself.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.076 A:middle
That's the only place where
this ScrollView is going

00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:13.916 A:middle
to return itself from
hitTest:withEvent.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:15.876 A:middle
In the other case where
things were working,

00:20:15.876 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
it was returning
one of its subviews.

00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:20.586 A:middle
So we can do something
where we're taking advantage

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.146 A:middle
of only the case where
ScrollView's returning itself.

00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:25.846 A:middle
Instead of returning itself,
we want to return nil.

00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:28.726 A:middle
Which will cause that superview
-- the view controllers view --

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:30.576 A:middle
to move on and look
through the other views

00:20:30.576 --> 00:20:32.076 A:middle
that are subviews of itself.

00:20:32.656 --> 00:20:33.856 A:middle
And that would allow
us to instead

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:36.786 A:middle
of hitting the ScrollView,
hit either the DotView or one

00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:38.896 A:middle
of the dots that are
in the DotView instead.

00:20:40.476 --> 00:20:42.556 A:middle
So what we can do is we
can subclass UIScrollView

00:20:43.026 --> 00:20:44.256 A:middle
and override hitTest:withEvent.

00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:48.236 A:middle
Of course once we've overridden
it, we just actually most

00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:50.036 A:middle
of the time want the
default behavior.

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:53.656 A:middle
So we'll call super and hang on
to the result that we get there.

00:20:54.256 --> 00:20:58.806 A:middle
If the thing that the superclass
implementation returned was the

00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.636 A:middle
ScrollView itself,
that means that we're

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.636 A:middle
ScrollView itself,
that means that we're

00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:01.756 A:middle
in that transparent area.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:03.716 A:middle
So in that case we'll
return nil.

00:21:03.716 --> 00:21:05.206 A:middle
Which will cause that
UIViewController --

00:21:05.206 --> 00:21:07.876 A:middle
the outer view -- to
continue through the subviews

00:21:07.876 --> 00:21:09.456 A:middle
and find the dots and
hit something in there.

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:11.666 A:middle
So a pretty straight
forward fix.

00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:14.126 A:middle
Eliza's going to come up now
and make that change to our app

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:14.786 A:middle
and see how we're doing.

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:23.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:27.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. So I've started
to add this class here.

00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:29.246 A:middle
New subclass of UIScrollView.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.696 A:middle
I've called it
OverlayScrollView.

00:21:31.596 --> 00:21:34.606 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
add that to the project.

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:37.596 A:middle
First thing I'm going
to do is just get rid

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:39.366 A:middle
of the implementation
that was provided.

00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:44.086 A:middle
So what we want to do
here is, as Josh said,

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:45.666 A:middle
override hitTest:withEvent.

00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:49.496 A:middle
This is really the only point
of this UIScrollView subclass is

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:51.896 A:middle
to not return itself
from hitTesting.

00:21:52.616 --> 00:21:56.676 A:middle
So we're going to call
superHitTest:withEvent.

00:21:56.826 --> 00:22:00.326 A:middle
And in most of the cases
will return the view

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.826 --> 00:22:00.326 A:middle
And in most of the cases
will return the view

00:22:00.806 --> 00:22:02.806 A:middle
that was returned from
the super-implementation.

00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:06.636 A:middle
But if the super-implementation
returned the ScrollView,

00:22:06.956 --> 00:22:09.566 A:middle
that means that we were -- that
the touch came down in an area

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:11.646 A:middle
of the ScrollView that didn't
have any other content.

00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:14.026 A:middle
And in that case we want
to allow the touch to pass

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.636 A:middle
through the ScrollView and go

00:22:15.636 --> 00:22:18.466 A:middle
on to the other siblings
of the ScrollView.

00:22:18.786 --> 00:22:20.196 A:middle
So we'll return nil
in that case.

00:22:20.676 --> 00:22:22.096 A:middle
And that's pretty much it.

00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:23.086 A:middle
So we need to go back

00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:27.066 A:middle
to the view controller
and import that file.

00:22:27.706 --> 00:22:32.296 A:middle
And then here where I'm
creating my ScrollView,

00:22:32.296 --> 00:22:34.046 A:middle
instead of creating
a UIScrollView ,

00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:36.336 A:middle
I'm going to just create
an overlay ScrollView.

00:22:36.686 --> 00:22:42.046 A:middle
And I need to remember to stop
disabling user interaction,

00:22:42.046 --> 00:22:45.846 A:middle
because we no longer
need such a big hammer

00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:47.146 A:middle
to get this effect that we want.

00:22:47.746 --> 00:22:49.646 A:middle
So I can run this.

00:22:49.866 --> 00:22:53.866 A:middle
And even though user
interaction is now re-enabled,

00:22:53.976 --> 00:22:56.316 A:middle
I can still touch these dots.

00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:58.776 A:middle
So that's the effect
of returning nil

00:22:58.776 --> 00:22:59.666 A:middle
from hitTest:withEvent.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.186 --> 00:23:02.266 A:middle
And then I can still
pull down the drawer.

00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:05.926 A:middle
And now I can actually touch
the dots that are in the drawer

00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:07.666 A:middle
and I can no longer touch

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:10.216 A:middle
through the drawer
to the dots behind.

00:23:10.276 --> 00:23:12.926 A:middle
So -- all right, so we finally
pretty much have this working

00:23:12.926 --> 00:23:13.936 A:middle
the way that we want.

00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:20.986 A:middle
One thing to note, I'm still
adding the ScrollView's pan

00:23:20.986 --> 00:23:23.346 A:middle
gesture recognizer
to the super-view.

00:23:23.726 --> 00:23:27.286 A:middle
I need to do that even though
I've re-enabled user interaction

00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:30.546 A:middle
because the transparent part

00:23:30.546 --> 00:23:32.416 A:middle
of the ScrollView is
no longer hitTesting.

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:36.266 A:middle
And the ScrollView's pan
will not get any touches

00:23:36.486 --> 00:23:39.116 A:middle
that don't hitTest to
the view that it's on.

00:23:39.426 --> 00:23:42.686 A:middle
So in order to allow scrolling
in the transparent region,

00:23:42.896 --> 00:23:44.756 A:middle
I still actually need
to use this technique

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.086 A:middle
of moving the pan gesture
onto the super view.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.716 A:middle
Otherwise you'd be able
to scroll in the drawer,

00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:52.856 A:middle
which is getting hitTest, but
you wouldn't be able to scroll

00:23:52.856 --> 00:23:54.186 A:middle
in the other parts
of the ScrollView.

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:55.786 A:middle
All right.

00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:58.936 A:middle
So with that all done,
I'm going to change gears,

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:01.906 A:middle
and let's add dragging
to this application.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:01.906 A:middle
and let's add dragging
to this application.

00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:04.406 A:middle
So we're going to make it so
that these dots can be picked

00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:07.916 A:middle
up using a long-press gesture
recognizer and dragged around.

00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:12.306 A:middle
So here where I add the dots
to the view, for every dot

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:16.516 A:middle
that I add, I'm going to make
a UILongPressGestureRecognizer.

00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:19.676 A:middle
I'm going to initialize it
with myself as the target

00:24:19.676 --> 00:24:21.386 A:middle
and the selectorHandle
LongPress --

00:24:21.386 --> 00:24:22.936 A:middle
which I'll implement
in just a moment.

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:25.816 A:middle
And I'll add that gesture
recognizer to the dot.

00:24:25.816 --> 00:24:26.926 A:middle
So I'm going to end
up with a lot

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:28.296 A:middle
of long press gesture
recognizers.

00:24:28.296 --> 00:24:30.486 A:middle
One per dot.

00:24:30.686 --> 00:24:33.416 A:middle
And here's my handleLong
PressMethod.

00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:37.396 A:middle
So before I even do anything in
response to these long presses,

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:39.866 A:middle
I want to show you a bug
that I just introduced

00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:42.356 A:middle
by adding the long press at all.

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:47.046 A:middle
So if I run this, and
I touch down on a dot

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:48.756 A:middle
and leave my finger down,

00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:51.266 A:middle
the dot un-highlights
after a brief moment.

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:54.766 A:middle
Even though I didn't actually
lift my finger in this case.

00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:58.746 A:middle
So the reason that that is
happening is that by default,

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.996 A:middle
UIGestureRecognizers
cancel touches

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.996 A:middle
UIGestureRecognizers
cancel touches

00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:04.416 A:middle
in their view once
they've recognized.

00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:06.586 A:middle
That's the default behavior
of a UIGestureRecognizer

00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.086 A:middle
and it's often what you want.

00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:10.916 A:middle
In this case it's
not what we want

00:25:10.956 --> 00:25:12.246 A:middle
because we actually
want the dots

00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:14.616 A:middle
to stay highlighted while
they're being dragged around.

00:25:14.706 --> 00:25:21.596 A:middle
So I can fix that here by
telling each long press gesture

00:25:21.676 --> 00:25:23.436 A:middle
that it does not cancel
touches in its view.

00:25:24.716 --> 00:25:24.926 A:middle
All right.

00:25:24.926 --> 00:25:25.696 A:middle
So now let's go ahead

00:25:25.696 --> 00:25:27.806 A:middle
and implement this
handleLongPress method.

00:25:28.196 --> 00:25:30.186 A:middle
We're going to get the
dot that was pressed

00:25:30.436 --> 00:25:32.196 A:middle
by asking the gesture
for its view.

00:25:32.196 --> 00:25:35.586 A:middle
And now we're going to do
what may be a familiar switch

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:36.886 A:middle
statement that you tend to do

00:25:36.886 --> 00:25:40.926 A:middle
in UIGestureRecognizer
Target methods.

00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:44.696 A:middle
We're going to switch all of
the different possible states

00:25:44.816 --> 00:25:48.466 A:middle
that this gesture can be in,
and we're going to grab the dot

00:25:48.466 --> 00:25:50.416 A:middle
if the gesture just began.

00:25:50.786 --> 00:25:52.696 A:middle
If the gesture changed,
we're going to move the dot.

00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:54.426 A:middle
And if it ended or
was cancelled,

00:25:54.426 --> 00:25:55.596 A:middle
we're going to drop the dot.

00:25:55.906 --> 00:25:57.976 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and implement
all of those methods now.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:02.696 --> 00:26:03.246 A:middle
All right.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:09.186 A:middle
So from my years as a
springboard engineer,

00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:12.746 A:middle
I know that when you want to
make something look grabbed,

00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:14.596 A:middle
you set a scale transform on it

00:26:14.596 --> 00:26:15.696 A:middle
to make it look a
little bit bigger.

00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:18.516 A:middle
And you lower its alpha
to make it look a little

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:19.706 A:middle
bit transparent.

00:26:19.706 --> 00:26:21.636 A:middle
That way it actually
appears to have changed

00:26:21.636 --> 00:26:23.076 A:middle
when it starts getting grabbed.

00:26:24.436 --> 00:26:26.666 A:middle
And when you want to make
it stop looking grabbed,

00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:28.376 A:middle
you do the same thing
in reverse.

00:26:29.306 --> 00:26:30.426 A:middle
Transform back to identity.

00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:31.236 A:middle
Alpha back to one.

00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:34.906 A:middle
So the other thing
that you want to do

00:26:34.906 --> 00:26:40.296 A:middle
when grabbing an element is pull
it to the front of everything.

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:43.076 A:middle
So that as the user drags it
around, it passes over all

00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:44.066 A:middle
of the rest of the content.

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:46.306 A:middle
So these dots may have been
grabbed out of the drawer

00:26:46.306 --> 00:26:47.936 A:middle
or they may have been
grabbed out of the canvas.

00:26:47.936 --> 00:26:50.286 A:middle
What we're going to do
is re-parent the one

00:26:50.286 --> 00:26:54.066 A:middle
that was grabbed and move it
into the view controllers view

00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:56.876 A:middle
at the end of the subview
list so that it passes

00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:58.146 A:middle
over all of the other content.

00:26:58.586 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
So I'm going to actually
do that before grabbing it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.586 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
So I'm going to actually
do that before grabbing it.

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:04.056 A:middle
I'm going to add it as
a subview of my view.

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:09.266 A:middle
Now any time that you re-parent
a view, you need to watch

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:11.996 A:middle
out for the possibility
that the origin

00:27:11.996 --> 00:27:14.416 A:middle
of the new view is not the same
as the origin of the old view.

00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:15.846 A:middle
And so it's positioned --

00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:20.046 A:middle
the center that it had in
the old view may not result

00:27:20.046 --> 00:27:21.456 A:middle
in the same position
on the screen

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:22.716 A:middle
as the center in the new view.

00:27:23.036 --> 00:27:25.446 A:middle
So we need to do a little
bit of point conversion here

00:27:25.446 --> 00:27:26.776 A:middle
to make sure that the
dot doesn't appear

00:27:26.776 --> 00:27:29.206 A:middle
to change locations
when it was re-parented.

00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:32.596 A:middle
By setting it center
to the result

00:27:32.596 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
of converting its old
center from its superview.

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:41.036 A:middle
So we're going to convert
that point to the view.

00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:43.706 A:middle
And then we're going to add
it as a subview of the view.

00:27:44.536 --> 00:27:45.066 A:middle
All right.

00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:47.186 A:middle
And then when the dot moves --

00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:50.156 A:middle
well so there it's
actually pretty simple.

00:27:50.156 --> 00:27:52.546 A:middle
What we want to do is keep the
dot under the user's finger.

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:56.526 A:middle
We know that the dot is in
my view -- that's superview.

00:27:56.576 --> 00:27:59.486 A:middle
So we can simply set its center

00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:01.406 A:middle
to be the gestures
location in that view.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:01.406 A:middle
to be the gestures
location in that view.

00:28:01.406 --> 00:28:02.786 A:middle
All right.

00:28:03.286 --> 00:28:06.246 A:middle
Now there's one little
caveat here.

00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:09.246 A:middle
If you saw one of our sessions
from a couple years ago,

00:28:09.576 --> 00:28:13.426 A:middle
you'll maybe remember that
we've done a technique like this

00:28:13.426 --> 00:28:14.946 A:middle
where you pick something
up and drag it around.

00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:19.376 A:middle
And it has the potential bug
that when you start moving,

00:28:19.646 --> 00:28:22.636 A:middle
the element that was
grabbed jumps a little bit.

00:28:22.736 --> 00:28:25.046 A:middle
That's because if you
see what I'm doing here,

00:28:25.126 --> 00:28:27.866 A:middle
I'm adding the --
I'm moving the dot

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:29.786 A:middle
so that its center
is under the touch.

00:28:30.336 --> 00:28:32.436 A:middle
Every frame as the user
moves their finger,

00:28:32.436 --> 00:28:34.436 A:middle
I'm putting the center of
the dot under their finger.

00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:38.216 A:middle
However, the user may have
picked the dot up from the edge.

00:28:38.546 --> 00:28:39.926 A:middle
They may not have picked
it up from the center.

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:42.346 A:middle
So the first time they
move their finger,

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:43.946 A:middle
it will jump under their finger.

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:48.006 A:middle
So in order to prevent that kind
of jarring jump, what I'm going

00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:49.826 A:middle
to do in this case --
which is a little different

00:28:49.826 --> 00:28:51.626 A:middle
from how we solve
this in the past --

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:55.136 A:middle
I'm just going to actually
call move dot with gesture

00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:56.886 A:middle
in that grab animation.

00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:59.936 A:middle
So that the first time
that the user grabs

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.046 --> 00:29:03.106 A:middle
and the dot gets picked
up, it also just animates

00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:04.756 A:middle
so that its center is
under their finger.

00:29:04.756 --> 00:29:07.356 A:middle
And that way we won't
have a jarring effect

00:29:07.356 --> 00:29:08.626 A:middle
when they start to
move their finger.

00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:14.826 A:middle
Finally, when the dot gets
dropped, we need to figure

00:29:14.826 --> 00:29:16.696 A:middle
out are we going to put
it down in the drawer?

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:18.316 A:middle
Or are we going to put
it down in the canvas.

00:29:18.806 --> 00:29:23.806 A:middle
So I'm going to find out from
the gesture what is the location

00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:24.706 A:middle
in the drawer view.

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:29.256 A:middle
And if the drawer view's
bounds contains that location,

00:29:29.256 --> 00:29:31.126 A:middle
that means that the
dot has been dragged

00:29:31.126 --> 00:29:32.396 A:middle
so that it's over the drawer.

00:29:33.326 --> 00:29:36.396 A:middle
And I will at that
point add the dot

00:29:36.396 --> 00:29:37.656 A:middle
to the drawer view's
content view.

00:29:38.876 --> 00:29:41.176 A:middle
Otherwise, I'll add it as
a subview of my canvas.

00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:45.296 A:middle
And I need to do that same
point conversion in reverse.

00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:49.976 A:middle
Move the dot center, so that
it's the result of converting

00:29:50.296 --> 00:29:54.896 A:middle
from my view that it was in
before to its new superview.

00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:57.976 A:middle
So that way it will appear
to stay in the same location.

00:29:58.386 --> 00:30:00.526 A:middle
And now we should be good to go.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.386 --> 00:30:00.526 A:middle
And now we should be good to go.

00:30:01.146 --> 00:30:03.426 A:middle
So I can pick one
of these guys up.

00:30:03.936 --> 00:30:05.706 A:middle
As you saw it animated nicely

00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:08.876 A:middle
under where my mouse
was pointing.

00:30:09.256 --> 00:30:10.066 A:middle
Drag it around.

00:30:10.506 --> 00:30:13.446 A:middle
I can do the same in the drawer.

00:30:14.096 --> 00:30:14.506 A:middle
Pick it up.

00:30:14.996 --> 00:30:15.666 A:middle
Drag it around.

00:30:15.696 --> 00:30:16.426 A:middle
Put it down.

00:30:16.736 --> 00:30:17.516 A:middle
Pick one up here.

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:19.566 A:middle
So I can move these
guys all around

00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:20.686 A:middle
and it seems to be working.

00:30:21.146 --> 00:30:23.326 A:middle
The drawer is getting
a little messy.

00:30:23.686 --> 00:30:26.406 A:middle
This offends me slightly
so I'm going to fix it

00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:29.716 A:middle
by just asking the dots to
arrange themselves neatly

00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:32.526 A:middle
with nifty animation in
the drawer at the moment

00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:33.276 A:middle
that they get picked up.

00:30:33.586 --> 00:30:36.616 A:middle
And I'm going to do the same
thing when we put them down.

00:30:37.976 --> 00:30:41.396 A:middle
So now when I pick
one up they do that.

00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:42.456 A:middle
Whoo!

00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:43.486 A:middle
Thanks.

00:30:44.516 --> 00:30:48.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.066 A:middle
Okay so this is pretty
much working as we want.

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:52.896 A:middle
But it would be cool
if you could pick a dot

00:30:52.896 --> 00:30:55.916 A:middle
up with one finger, and
then scroll the drawer

00:30:56.026 --> 00:30:57.356 A:middle
to either bring it
down or push it back

00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:58.526 A:middle
up again with another finger.

00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:02.326 A:middle
I'm going to switch over
to an actual iPad here

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:02.326 A:middle
I'm going to switch over
to an actual iPad here

00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:03.526 A:middle
where I've got this running.

00:31:04.106 --> 00:31:07.196 A:middle
So that we can do a
multi-touch thing.

00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:10.046 A:middle
So here's the very same
app running on an iPad.

00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:13.056 A:middle
The one difference is that I've
modified it so that you can see

00:31:13.056 --> 00:31:14.396 A:middle
where the user's
touch comes down.

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:15.916 A:middle
So that little white
dot that's moving

00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.096 A:middle
around is where my finger is.

00:31:17.516 --> 00:31:20.246 A:middle
So you can see that
I can pick up a dot.

00:31:20.246 --> 00:31:23.466 A:middle
And I can actually even
pick up more than one dot.

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:26.306 A:middle
This you get for free, just
because we've got a bunch

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:28.406 A:middle
of long press gesture
recognizers, I can move them all

00:31:28.406 --> 00:31:29.316 A:middle
around at the same time.

00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:32.376 A:middle
But if I put down
another finger and attempt

00:31:32.506 --> 00:31:35.906 A:middle
to scroll the ScrollView,
nothing happens.

00:31:36.196 --> 00:31:38.326 A:middle
So let's try to fix that.

00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:41.376 A:middle
We went to be able to
simultaneously be dragging one

00:31:41.376 --> 00:31:42.086 A:middle
of these dots around

00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:44.266 A:middle
and scrolling the ScrollView
with another finger.

00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:47.616 A:middle
All right, so why
isn't that working?

00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:53.386 A:middle
So I could have fingers on
the different ones of the dots

00:31:53.386 --> 00:31:55.216 A:middle
and interact with
those at the same time

00:31:55.216 --> 00:31:56.876 A:middle
because those views
are siblings.

00:31:57.306 --> 00:31:59.806 A:middle
And so their gesture recognizers
don't interact with one another.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.426 --> 00:32:03.536 A:middle
However, the dots are
a subview of the view

00:32:03.536 --> 00:32:05.036 A:middle
that has the pan
gesture recognizers.

00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:07.876 A:middle
So the long press gestures

00:32:07.876 --> 00:32:09.646 A:middle
and the pan gesture
recognizer do interact.

00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:13.696 A:middle
And by default, the behavior
of gesture recognizers

00:32:13.696 --> 00:32:16.196 A:middle
that interact is to
be mutually exclusive.

00:32:16.556 --> 00:32:19.856 A:middle
So once I've already picked
up a dot, I can no longer make

00:32:19.856 --> 00:32:21.216 A:middle
that pan gesture recognized.

00:32:21.546 --> 00:32:24.776 A:middle
But we can easily
tell these gestures

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.926 A:middle
that they can recognize
simultaneously.

00:32:26.926 --> 00:32:28.356 A:middle
And the way we do that is

00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:32.276 A:middle
by becoming the long press
gesture recognizers delegate.

00:32:33.086 --> 00:32:37.756 A:middle
So we'll say that we conform to
UIGesture RecognizerDelegate.

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:41.056 A:middle
And when we add the
long presses,

00:32:41.056 --> 00:32:43.596 A:middle
we'll make ourselves the
delegate of all of them.

00:32:44.056 --> 00:32:49.576 A:middle
And then we'll implement
a single delegate method.

00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:52.806 A:middle
Gesture recognizers should
recognize simultaneously

00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:53.986 A:middle
with gesture recognizer.

00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.726 A:middle
And in this case, just

00:32:55.726 --> 00:32:57.286 A:middle
as a shortcut I'm
going to return yes.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:58.896 A:middle
I can do that safely here

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:00.206 A:middle
because this is a
pretty small app,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:00.206 A:middle
because this is a
pretty small app,

00:33:00.206 --> 00:33:01.836 A:middle
and I know that the only
gesture that I'm going

00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:04.466 A:middle
to be asked this question about
is the ScrollViews pan gesture.

00:33:04.936 --> 00:33:07.226 A:middle
In your own applications you
should be much more specific

00:33:07.226 --> 00:33:09.796 A:middle
here because it would be
an easy source of bugs

00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:13.016 A:middle
to just return yes willy-nilly
to any gesture recognizer

00:33:13.016 --> 00:33:15.086 A:middle
that you're asked about.

00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:18.846 A:middle
So once we've done that,
I'm not going to build it

00:33:18.846 --> 00:33:21.306 A:middle
because I've actually got an
already built copy over here.

00:33:22.446 --> 00:33:26.476 A:middle
So this is a result of having
made exactly those changes.

00:33:26.846 --> 00:33:29.216 A:middle
And let me switch over.

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:30.976 A:middle
All right.

00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:40.256 A:middle
So now I can scroll while
one of these guys is grabbed.

00:33:40.516 --> 00:33:43.256 A:middle
But you can see there's
actually a pretty bad bug here.

00:33:43.536 --> 00:33:47.006 A:middle
If I try to scroll
this down I can.

00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:52.186 A:middle
But I can also scroll it using
the very same touch that's

00:33:52.186 --> 00:33:53.276 A:middle
dragging one of the dots.

00:33:53.276 --> 00:33:55.606 A:middle
Which is clearly not the
behavior that I want at all.

00:33:55.606 --> 00:33:57.766 A:middle
All right so now why
is that happening?

00:33:58.146 --> 00:34:03.076 A:middle
Well I was asked, can the pan
gesture recognize simultaneously

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.146 --> 00:34:03.076 A:middle
Well I was asked, can the pan
gesture recognize simultaneously

00:34:03.076 --> 00:34:04.616 A:middle
with the long press
gesture, and I said yes.

00:34:05.286 --> 00:34:07.006 A:middle
So they're recognizing
simultaneously.

00:34:07.006 --> 00:34:10.416 A:middle
The very same touch
is having the effect

00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:12.826 A:middle
of recognizing with
both gestures.

00:34:13.606 --> 00:34:16.416 A:middle
So that we do not want to do.

00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:19.156 A:middle
And I'm going to bring
Josh back on stage to talk

00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:21.226 A:middle
about how we can fix that
last little problem here.

00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:24.341 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:24.985 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:26.876 A:middle
Well we're getting pretty close.

00:34:26.876 --> 00:34:28.346 A:middle
We can almost do
what I really want,

00:34:28.346 --> 00:34:29.366 A:middle
to be able to drag these dots

00:34:29.366 --> 00:34:33.556 A:middle
around while also scrolling
this drawer on and off.

00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.525 A:middle
So let's figure out
that last little bit

00:34:35.525 --> 00:34:37.775 A:middle
of how we can make sure that
these gestures recognize,

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.766 A:middle
using the touches that we
actually expect them to.

00:34:40.436 --> 00:34:43.065 A:middle
Let's look first again
at the view hierarchy

00:34:43.065 --> 00:34:44.846 A:middle
and where all this stuff is
set up, just to make sure

00:34:44.846 --> 00:34:46.076 A:middle
that we're all on the same page

00:34:46.076 --> 00:34:47.906 A:middle
about how this is
currently interacting.

00:34:48.616 --> 00:34:50.376 A:middle
So we've got that outer view.

00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:51.366 A:middle
And we've got our ScrollView.

00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:52.496 A:middle
And we've got our
drawerView here.

00:34:52.496 --> 00:34:55.716 A:middle
Now of course the long
presses that are on the dots --

00:34:55.716 --> 00:34:58.546 A:middle
let's look at the ones first
that are up on the drawerView.

00:34:58.956 --> 00:35:00.796 A:middle
They're on subviews of
the drawerView actually.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.956 --> 00:35:00.796 A:middle
They're on subviews of
the drawerView actually.

00:35:00.796 --> 00:35:02.756 A:middle
They're each attached
to the individual dots.

00:35:03.636 --> 00:35:05.696 A:middle
And then we've got the
pan gesture recognizer

00:35:05.696 --> 00:35:06.446 A:middle
from the ScrollView.

00:35:06.826 --> 00:35:07.956 A:middle
Had we not done anything else,

00:35:07.956 --> 00:35:09.506 A:middle
it would have been
on the ScrollView.

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:11.866 A:middle
But we took it and we
moved it up and put it

00:35:11.866 --> 00:35:15.306 A:middle
on that outer containing
UIViewControllerView.

00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:15.936 A:middle
So it's out there.

00:35:17.116 --> 00:35:19.196 A:middle
So now when a touch comes
down inside that drawer,

00:35:19.476 --> 00:35:20.516 A:middle
it's going to be seen by both.

00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:23.056 A:middle
It will be seen by any of
the long press gestures

00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:24.226 A:middle
that it's interacting with.

00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:25.616 A:middle
So if it's on a dot,
it will be seen

00:35:25.616 --> 00:35:26.766 A:middle
by the long press on that dot.

00:35:27.766 --> 00:35:30.946 A:middle
And it will also be seen by the
outer UIPanGestureRecognizer,

00:35:31.076 --> 00:35:31.916 A:middle
from the UIScrollView .

00:35:32.736 --> 00:35:33.896 A:middle
Now that's where
we're getting this bug

00:35:33.896 --> 00:35:35.036 A:middle
that Eliza was talking about.

00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:37.326 A:middle
How do we fix this?

00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:39.986 A:middle
We need them both to be able
to recognize at the same time.

00:35:40.366 --> 00:35:43.526 A:middle
Because we want one touch in
a dot to be able to move it,

00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.986 A:middle
while another touch
outside doesn't.

00:35:45.366 --> 00:35:46.976 A:middle
And we already know that
those gestures are going

00:35:46.976 --> 00:35:47.976 A:middle
to interact with one another.

00:35:47.976 --> 00:35:49.946 A:middle
So we definitely
need to allow them

00:35:49.946 --> 00:35:51.216 A:middle
to recognize simultaneously.

00:35:52.236 --> 00:35:53.086 A:middle
So we can't change that.

00:35:54.346 --> 00:35:58.286 A:middle
We want to do something
when the long press starts,

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:01.476 A:middle
to prevent the pan from
recognizing with that touch.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:01.476 A:middle
to prevent the pan from
recognizing with that touch.

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:03.906 A:middle
We want to allow the
long press to continue

00:36:03.906 --> 00:36:04.876 A:middle
so we can drag the dot.

00:36:05.556 --> 00:36:07.036 A:middle
But we just want
to stop the pan.

00:36:07.636 --> 00:36:11.006 A:middle
But we don't want to stop
it from panning at all,

00:36:11.006 --> 00:36:12.256 A:middle
just form panning
with that touch.

00:36:12.966 --> 00:36:15.566 A:middle
So we can actually take
advantage of the fact

00:36:16.086 --> 00:36:18.466 A:middle
that there's this
special side behavior

00:36:18.536 --> 00:36:21.796 A:middle
of disabling a gesture
recognizer which causes it

00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:23.106 A:middle
to stop looking at any touches

00:36:23.106 --> 00:36:24.096 A:middle
that it was currently
looking at.

00:36:25.076 --> 00:36:27.446 A:middle
So when the long
press recognizes,

00:36:27.446 --> 00:36:28.736 A:middle
we can just get the pan gesture

00:36:29.026 --> 00:36:30.726 A:middle
and set its enabled
state to false.

00:36:31.746 --> 00:36:34.066 A:middle
By setting it to false, it's
going to tell it to stop looking

00:36:34.066 --> 00:36:35.786 A:middle
at any touches it was
currently considering,

00:36:36.366 --> 00:36:37.796 A:middle
and reset itself basically.

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:39.846 A:middle
So it will no longer
consider that touch.

00:36:40.366 --> 00:36:43.476 A:middle
The long press will still be
able to continue considering it,

00:36:43.476 --> 00:36:45.626 A:middle
because we didn't disable
the long press, just the pan.

00:36:46.656 --> 00:36:49.056 A:middle
But of course if we did that,
than you wouldn't be able to pan

00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:51.586 A:middle
with another touch
because we disable the pan.

00:36:52.456 --> 00:36:54.086 A:middle
We can actually just
go right around

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:55.226 A:middle
and turn it right back on,

00:36:55.676 --> 00:36:57.396 A:middle
and it will still have
stopped looking at the touch

00:36:57.396 --> 00:36:59.346 A:middle
that it was looking at, but
it will now be able to look

00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:00.566 A:middle
at new touches that come down.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:00.566 A:middle
at new touches that come down.

00:37:01.566 --> 00:37:02.756 A:middle
So actually it turns
out this is going

00:37:02.756 --> 00:37:04.256 A:middle
to be really, really
easy to fix.

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:06.576 A:middle
And Eliza's going to come
back and do it really quickly

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:07.586 A:middle
and see where that leaves us.

00:37:08.516 --> 00:37:15.656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:16.156 --> 00:37:16.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:37:16.396 --> 00:37:18.696 A:middle
So this is going to be the
fastest demo in history.

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:21.036 A:middle
All I need to do
is at the moment

00:37:21.036 --> 00:37:26.096 A:middle
when I'm grabbing the dot,
I just need to disable

00:37:26.096 --> 00:37:29.716 A:middle
and then re-enable the
ScrollView's pan gesture.

00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:31.666 A:middle
So disabling it will cause it

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:33.646 A:middle
to just stop tracking all
the touches it was tracking,

00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:34.676 A:middle
including the long press.

00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:37.646 A:middle
And re-enabling it will
allow it to be ready

00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:40.196 A:middle
to track new touches
that might start.

00:37:41.036 --> 00:37:43.896 A:middle
So I will switch back over here.

00:37:44.456 --> 00:37:49.606 A:middle
And launch the third
version of this.

00:37:49.606 --> 00:37:53.486 A:middle
So the third version here
we can now pick up a dot.

00:37:53.926 --> 00:37:56.286 A:middle
We can simultaneously
scroll the ScrollView.

00:37:56.606 --> 00:38:01.596 A:middle
But the dot itself no longer
scrolls the ScrollView.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:56.606 --> 00:38:01.596 A:middle
But the dot itself no longer
scrolls the ScrollView.

00:38:01.596 --> 00:38:03.216 A:middle
So now I can do all the
things I wanted to do.

00:38:03.216 --> 00:38:05.136 A:middle
I can grab several dots at once.

00:38:06.136 --> 00:38:07.126 A:middle
Put them in the ScrollView.

00:38:07.126 --> 00:38:09.826 A:middle
Grab several of them out of
there; pull them over here.

00:38:10.136 --> 00:38:13.586 A:middle
So this is pretty much
working exactly as we wanted.

00:38:13.676 --> 00:38:16.616 A:middle
Now there's a little --
there's a few elements of polish

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:18.596 A:middle
that have to do with the way

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:20.706 A:middle
that these dots highlight
themselves.

00:38:20.706 --> 00:38:24.326 A:middle
And I want to try to draw your
attention to a little problem

00:38:24.816 --> 00:38:27.716 A:middle
that may not be immediately
apparent.

00:38:27.716 --> 00:38:32.096 A:middle
So I'm going to put my
finger down to start a pan

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:33.966 A:middle
in that blue dot near the top.

00:38:35.276 --> 00:38:38.096 A:middle
Did you see that it momentarily
highlighted, and then sort

00:38:38.096 --> 00:38:39.346 A:middle
of blinked back off again?

00:38:39.556 --> 00:38:43.516 A:middle
I'll do it on another one --
the orange one here, just to --

00:38:43.626 --> 00:38:46.526 A:middle
so pans that start
in the dot cause it

00:38:46.526 --> 00:38:48.386 A:middle
to momentarily receive
touches again,

00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:49.746 A:middle
which causes it to
be highlighted.

00:38:50.166 --> 00:38:53.756 A:middle
But then as the pan recognizes,
it cancels touches in its view.

00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:56.636 A:middle
And so touchesCancelled
gets delivered to the dot.

00:38:56.636 --> 00:38:59.296 A:middle
And so you see this
momentary flash of highlighted

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:00.716 A:middle
as you start scrolling.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:00.716 A:middle
as you start scrolling.

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:03.166 A:middle
But now notice that the
same thing does not happen

00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:04.826 A:middle
with the dots that
are in the drawer.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:10.056 A:middle
So when I start panning here,
I don't get that flash of --

00:39:10.216 --> 00:39:14.186 A:middle
oh actually -- well I guess
I'm doing it too slowly

00:39:14.766 --> 00:39:15.106 A:middle
[chuckles] sorry.

00:39:15.106 --> 00:39:17.526 A:middle
Let me do it a bit
faster to see the effect.

00:39:17.526 --> 00:39:18.246 A:middle
It's very subtle.

00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:22.596 A:middle
But for the most part,
pans don't cause that flash

00:39:22.596 --> 00:39:24.096 A:middle
of highlighting in
the drawer view.

00:39:24.096 --> 00:39:26.396 A:middle
If you're really
deliberate about it,

00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:29.396 A:middle
I guess you can get
them to do it.

00:39:29.396 --> 00:39:32.996 A:middle
So the reason for the difference
is that these dots here

00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:36.406 A:middle
in the drawer are
in a ScrollView.

00:39:36.736 --> 00:39:39.816 A:middle
And by default, ScrollView
actually has behavior

00:39:40.096 --> 00:39:42.216 A:middle
that delays the delivery
of touches

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:46.736 A:middle
to its subviews while it's
checking whether a pan

00:39:46.736 --> 00:39:47.306 A:middle
is starting.

00:39:48.116 --> 00:39:49.856 A:middle
And you can really
see the effect of this

00:39:49.856 --> 00:39:52.016 A:middle
if you use UITableViews in iOS.

00:39:52.496 --> 00:39:55.076 A:middle
You'll see that if you basically
start scrolling pretty quickly

00:39:55.076 --> 00:39:58.336 A:middle
in a UITableView, you don't see
a flash of highlight on the cell

00:39:58.336 --> 00:39:59.826 A:middle
that you happen to touch.

00:39:59.826 --> 00:40:04.486 A:middle
And so you avoid this kind of
experience of flashing happening

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.826 --> 00:40:04.486 A:middle
And so you avoid this kind of
experience of flashing happening

00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:05.456 A:middle
as you start scrolling.

00:40:05.796 --> 00:40:08.796 A:middle
So I'm going to bring
Josh back on stage

00:40:09.066 --> 00:40:12.176 A:middle
to explain how that's
accomplished in UIScrollView

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:15.106 A:middle
and how we can get the very
same effect for these dots

00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:15.856 A:middle
that are not in a ScrollView.

00:40:16.516 --> 00:40:22.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:23.306 --> 00:40:23.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:25.126 A:middle
So I promised at the
beginning that we were going

00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:26.366 A:middle
to talk about some polish.

00:40:26.366 --> 00:40:28.466 A:middle
And look at some internal
implementation ideas

00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:30.996 A:middle
of how UIScrollView accomplishes
this sort of behavior.

00:40:31.526 --> 00:40:32.226 A:middle
So let's go do that.

00:40:32.966 --> 00:40:35.396 A:middle
But before we do, I just
want to get a quick video

00:40:35.396 --> 00:40:36.426 A:middle
of what Eliza mentioned there,

00:40:36.426 --> 00:40:38.656 A:middle
of when you're scrolling
in a UITableView.

00:40:39.156 --> 00:40:42.566 A:middle
So if I go and scroll this
view here, you're going to find

00:40:42.566 --> 00:40:44.776 A:middle
that we don't end
up seeing flashes,

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.726 A:middle
as she said we wouldn't.

00:40:46.726 --> 00:40:48.146 A:middle
It scrolls smoothly.

00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:50.056 A:middle
There's no flash of
any cells highlighting,

00:40:50.056 --> 00:40:51.416 A:middle
no matter where I
put my finger down,

00:40:51.746 --> 00:40:53.296 A:middle
as long as I start
scrolling pretty quickly.

00:40:54.466 --> 00:40:56.616 A:middle
Now if I put my finger
down and leave it there

00:40:56.616 --> 00:40:58.226 A:middle
for a little while,
then we're going to go

00:40:58.226 --> 00:40:59.966 A:middle
and highlight whatever cell
you put your finger in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.566 --> 00:41:02.506 A:middle
So that's exactly the same kind
of thing that we're talking

00:41:02.506 --> 00:41:03.646 A:middle
about here in these dots.

00:41:03.936 --> 00:41:06.356 A:middle
But applied really everywhere
that you see a UITableView.

00:41:06.946 --> 00:41:09.626 A:middle
So this behavior,
as Eliza mentioned,

00:41:09.626 --> 00:41:12.936 A:middle
is accomplished using a
property on UIScrollView.

00:41:13.316 --> 00:41:14.606 A:middle
So if you're in a
ScrollView you're getting

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:15.336 A:middle
this automatically.

00:41:15.666 --> 00:41:17.766 A:middle
That property is called
delaysContentTouches.

00:41:18.846 --> 00:41:20.306 A:middle
Now you can turn this
off if you wanted.

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:22.136 A:middle
If for some reason in
your ScrollView you want

00:41:22.136 --> 00:41:24.416 A:middle
to make touches go through
immediately with no delay,

00:41:24.976 --> 00:41:27.196 A:middle
but by default you get a short
delay before they're delivered

00:41:27.196 --> 00:41:28.496 A:middle
to any view in the ScrollView.

00:41:30.236 --> 00:41:32.286 A:middle
Now in the case that we're
looking here with these dots,

00:41:32.966 --> 00:41:35.326 A:middle
we don't actually have all
the dots in a ScrollView,

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.466 A:middle
so we're not getting
that behavior

00:41:36.466 --> 00:41:37.926 A:middle
on the ones that aren't.

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:40.836 A:middle
To understand how the
ScrollView is getting this,

00:41:40.836 --> 00:41:43.576 A:middle
it helps to look at all
of the gesture recognizers

00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:44.796 A:middle
that are attached
to the ScrollView.

00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:47.656 A:middle
So the ScrollView has a
pan gesture recognizer.

00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:48.206 A:middle
We know that.

00:41:48.376 --> 00:41:52.036 A:middle
We already took it and used it
this session in order to move it

00:41:52.036 --> 00:41:53.036 A:middle
out onto that outer view.

00:41:53.846 --> 00:41:55.936 A:middle
Of course it also has a
pinch gesture recognizer.

00:41:55.936 --> 00:41:58.116 A:middle
So if you're using zooming
in your UIScrollView,

00:41:58.296 --> 00:42:00.236 A:middle
there will be a
UIPinchgestureRecognizer

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.296 --> 00:42:00.236 A:middle
there will be a
UIPinchgestureRecognizer

00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
on the ScrollView as well.

00:42:02.006 --> 00:42:03.946 A:middle
But there's actually a third
one that you may not know about.

00:42:04.366 --> 00:42:05.766 A:middle
It's actually there if you look

00:42:05.766 --> 00:42:08.456 A:middle
at the gesture recognizer
array on the ScrollView.

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:12.996 A:middle
But it's not particularly useful
to know about in most cases,

00:42:12.996 --> 00:42:14.616 A:middle
other than to understand
how these things work.

00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:17.676 A:middle
And that third one is a touch
delay gesture recognizer.

00:42:17.836 --> 00:42:21.826 A:middle
So this gesture recognizer's
sole purpose in life is to sit

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:22.686 A:middle
around and fail [chuckles].

00:42:22.766 --> 00:42:28.496 A:middle
So I feel a little bad
for it, but it's there.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.836 A:middle
It never recognizes.

00:42:30.186 --> 00:42:33.406 A:middle
It's there just as a way
to delay touch delivery

00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:34.606 A:middle
to the views in this ScrollView.

00:42:34.606 --> 00:42:37.426 A:middle
And the way that it does
that is by taking advantage

00:42:37.426 --> 00:42:38.686 A:middle
of a property that exists

00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:41.466 A:middle
on UIGestureRecognizer
called delaysTouchesBegan.

00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:44.516 A:middle
Now this is no by default,
because when you set it

00:42:44.516 --> 00:42:46.336 A:middle
to yes it can introduce
big delays

00:42:46.336 --> 00:42:47.576 A:middle
in touch delivery
throughout your app.

00:42:48.076 --> 00:42:50.806 A:middle
So most gesture recognizers
do not want this property set

00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:51.416 A:middle
to yes.

00:42:51.816 --> 00:42:55.166 A:middle
Because what it does is delays
delivery of touchesBegan --

00:42:55.166 --> 00:42:57.306 A:middle
the entire touch sequence
actually the began

00:42:57.306 --> 00:42:58.846 A:middle
and all subsequent events,

00:42:59.546 --> 00:43:03.386 A:middle
until that gesture recognizer
either recognizes or fails.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.546 --> 00:43:03.386 A:middle
until that gesture recognizer
either recognizes or fails.

00:43:04.856 --> 00:43:06.506 A:middle
So we can use it
to delay delivery

00:43:06.506 --> 00:43:09.736 A:middle
of the entire touch sequence
to some view that's attached

00:43:09.736 --> 00:43:12.576 A:middle
to whatever view the gesture
recognizer is attached to.

00:43:13.256 --> 00:43:15.216 A:middle
So if we look at a
timeline of how this works,

00:43:15.216 --> 00:43:16.836 A:middle
then we can see why
this makes sense

00:43:16.836 --> 00:43:18.036 A:middle
and how it does what it does.

00:43:18.836 --> 00:43:21.126 A:middle
So when a touch comes
down, the touch gets --

00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:23.136 A:middle
it's going to begin;
it comes down.

00:43:23.546 --> 00:43:25.436 A:middle
Let's look at what
happens to the pan gesture.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:26.806 A:middle
The touch delay gesture.

00:43:26.806 --> 00:43:29.876 A:middle
And the view that the
touch was hitTested to.

00:43:30.616 --> 00:43:33.666 A:middle
So at this point the touch
delay gesture is going

00:43:33.666 --> 00:43:34.396 A:middle
to start a timer.

00:43:35.006 --> 00:43:36.676 A:middle
It's a pretty short timer
because we don't want

00:43:36.726 --> 00:43:38.566 A:middle
to add big delays to
delivery of the touch.

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:43.606 A:middle
Let's say .15 seconds just as
a number that I might pick out.

00:43:44.366 --> 00:43:47.146 A:middle
Now if you leave your finger
down for some period of time,

00:43:47.606 --> 00:43:52.466 A:middle
until this timer fires, than the
delay gesture is going to fail.

00:43:52.466 --> 00:43:53.636 A:middle
It will set its state to failed.

00:43:54.136 --> 00:43:56.316 A:middle
And once it does, because it
was the only thing delaying

00:43:56.316 --> 00:43:59.436 A:middle
that touch, the UI view at that
point that it was hitTested to,

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.756 A:middle
we'll see touches
begin with event,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.756 A:middle
we'll see touches
begin with event,

00:44:00.756 --> 00:44:01.666 A:middle
and the touch will be delivered.

00:44:03.016 --> 00:44:05.496 A:middle
Now if things progress
and the user decides

00:44:05.496 --> 00:44:06.946 A:middle
to move their finger
a little bit,

00:44:07.256 --> 00:44:09.136 A:middle
maybe the pan gesture
starts to recognize.

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.456 A:middle
And at that point
the view is going

00:44:11.456 --> 00:44:12.586 A:middle
to get touchesCancelled
with event.

00:44:12.806 --> 00:44:14.436 A:middle
So that's where the
highlight will get removed.

00:44:15.656 --> 00:44:18.176 A:middle
The delay gesture
has already failed,

00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:19.306 A:middle
so nothing new is
happening there.

00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.086 A:middle
So that's the case where
you leave your finger

00:44:22.086 --> 00:44:22.896 A:middle
down long enough.

00:44:23.166 --> 00:44:25.086 A:middle
But the interesting case is
when you scroll really quickly.

00:44:25.426 --> 00:44:26.956 A:middle
So let's look at what
happens in that case.

00:44:27.776 --> 00:44:30.026 A:middle
Again we put the -- the
user puts their finger down.

00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:32.746 A:middle
The delay gesture
starts a short timer.

00:44:33.616 --> 00:44:35.136 A:middle
And the view still
hasn't seen anything

00:44:35.136 --> 00:44:36.876 A:middle
because that delay
gesture exists

00:44:36.876 --> 00:44:38.246 A:middle
and has delays touches begin.

00:44:39.416 --> 00:44:41.276 A:middle
Now if the user at this
point starts scrolling,

00:44:41.276 --> 00:44:43.236 A:middle
and the pan gesture recognizes,

00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:46.476 A:middle
then the pan gesture would
have cancelled that touch.

00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:48.926 A:middle
But because we never
delivered it yet --

00:44:48.926 --> 00:44:50.956 A:middle
it was still being delayed
by that delay gesture,

00:44:51.306 --> 00:44:53.376 A:middle
we don't ever actually
deliver it to the view at all.

00:44:53.726 --> 00:44:55.926 A:middle
As far as the view is concerned,
the touch never happened.

00:44:56.416 --> 00:44:57.846 A:middle
The pan gesture recognizes.

00:44:58.156 --> 00:44:59.256 A:middle
The touch would have
been cancelled,

00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.406 A:middle
but we never delivered began.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.406 A:middle
but we never delivered began.

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:02.396 A:middle
So it would be kind of silly
to deliver began cancelled.

00:45:02.906 --> 00:45:05.276 A:middle
So we just don't deliver it.

00:45:05.326 --> 00:45:07.166 A:middle
And that causes us
to never highlight.

00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:08.396 A:middle
And never flash a highlight.

00:45:08.396 --> 00:45:10.436 A:middle
And we get exactly the
behavior that we're looking for.

00:45:11.046 --> 00:45:14.406 A:middle
Now there's nothing
particularly magical

00:45:14.406 --> 00:45:16.146 A:middle
about this touch delay
gesture recognizer.

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.376 A:middle
And we can write one ourselves

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:19.586 A:middle
that does pretty much the
exact same thing that the one

00:45:19.586 --> 00:45:22.556 A:middle
on UIScrollView does, so that
we can use that in situations

00:45:22.556 --> 00:45:24.016 A:middle
where we're not using
a UIScrollView .

00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:25.886 A:middle
Of course there are
no situations

00:45:25.886 --> 00:45:27.376 A:middle
where you should not
use the UIScrollView,

00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.236 A:middle
but let's imagine
that there might be.

00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:33.736 A:middle
[Laughter] So we can do that by
subclassing UIGestureRecognizer

00:45:34.116 --> 00:45:36.636 A:middle
and over-rising -- over-riding
its designated initializer

00:45:36.996 --> 00:45:38.226 A:middle
with target action.

00:45:38.676 --> 00:45:39.436 A:middle
And of course what we do

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:42.296 A:middle
in there is set
delaysTouchesBegan to yes.

00:45:42.326 --> 00:45:44.106 A:middle
Because as I mentioned,
that's no by default.

00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:46.536 A:middle
So that most gesture
recognizers aren't doing that.

00:45:47.896 --> 00:45:50.106 A:middle
Then as with all
UIGestureRecognizer subclasses,

00:45:50.106 --> 00:45:51.836 A:middle
we're going to override
some of the touch methods.

00:45:52.236 --> 00:45:55.076 A:middle
So we'll do touchesBegan, ended,
and cancelled in this case.

00:45:55.396 --> 00:45:56.726 A:middle
Because for this
gesture recognizer,

00:45:56.726 --> 00:45:58.876 A:middle
we don't actually care if the
touch ever moves anywhere.

00:45:59.196 --> 00:46:01.156 A:middle
We're not trying
to deal with that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.196 --> 00:46:01.156 A:middle
We're not trying
to deal with that.

00:46:01.156 --> 00:46:02.876 A:middle
We just care when it comes
down and when it comes up.

00:46:04.006 --> 00:46:06.956 A:middle
So we'll override touchesBegan
and start a timer --

00:46:07.126 --> 00:46:08.606 A:middle
we mentioned there's going
to be that short timer,

00:46:08.606 --> 00:46:09.426 A:middle
so we'll start that there.

00:46:09.426 --> 00:46:12.036 A:middle
And then in touchesEnded
and touchesCancelled,

00:46:12.446 --> 00:46:13.596 A:middle
we want to set our
state to failed.

00:46:14.096 --> 00:46:16.096 A:middle
Now the reason we
want to do that is

00:46:16.096 --> 00:46:18.886 A:middle
because if the user taps
quickly we want that touch

00:46:18.886 --> 00:46:20.936 A:middle
to get delivered immediately
when the touch comes up.

00:46:21.176 --> 00:46:23.616 A:middle
We don't want to wait until
this timer has expired in order

00:46:23.616 --> 00:46:25.836 A:middle
to deliver the touch, or
you'll introduce extra delay

00:46:25.836 --> 00:46:27.566 A:middle
that you don't mean to
when it's not necessary.

00:46:28.126 --> 00:46:30.696 A:middle
So if the touch ends
or it gets cancelled,

00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:32.186 A:middle
we're going to set
the state to failed.

00:46:32.226 --> 00:46:34.106 A:middle
And that will allow
that touch to go through

00:46:34.106 --> 00:46:36.696 A:middle
and get delivered to the view.

00:46:36.906 --> 00:46:38.626 A:middle
Now of course we said
we're setting a timer,

00:46:38.626 --> 00:46:40.206 A:middle
so we have to implement
some timer method.

00:46:40.586 --> 00:46:42.356 A:middle
Let's say that we've got some
function that gets called.

00:46:42.786 --> 00:46:45.706 A:middle
What we're going to do in there
is also set our state to failed.

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:48.406 A:middle
If our timer passes;
this gesture fails,

00:46:48.466 --> 00:46:49.926 A:middle
that will allow the
touch to get delivered.

00:46:50.966 --> 00:46:52.396 A:middle
And then finally, the last thing

00:46:52.396 --> 00:46:55.566 A:middle
that gesture recognizers should
do is override the reset method.

00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:57.966 A:middle
Which is where you go about
putting yourself back in shape

00:46:57.966 --> 00:47:00.726 A:middle
to be ready for another
instance of trying to recognize.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:57.966 --> 00:47:00.726 A:middle
to be ready for another
instance of trying to recognize.

00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:03.136 A:middle
And so in there we're just
going to clear the timer.

00:47:03.136 --> 00:47:04.486 A:middle
Reset it. And get
everything back

00:47:04.486 --> 00:47:06.006 A:middle
into a good state
to start over again.

00:47:06.646 --> 00:47:08.576 A:middle
So pretty small gesture
recognizer.

00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:10.296 A:middle
It's never going to
try and recognize,

00:47:10.296 --> 00:47:11.296 A:middle
which is kind of unique.

00:47:11.296 --> 00:47:14.006 A:middle
There's not a lot of gesture
recognizers that never try

00:47:14.006 --> 00:47:14.876 A:middle
to recognize anything.

00:47:15.356 --> 00:47:16.486 A:middle
But it gets us an
interesting effect.

00:47:16.486 --> 00:47:18.726 A:middle
And Eliza's going to come
back up and build it for us.

00:47:19.516 --> 00:47:26.706 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:27.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:47:27.576 --> 00:47:29.706 A:middle
So I'm adding another
class here.

00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:32.396 A:middle
TouchDelayGestureRecognizer,
which is going to be a subclass

00:47:32.396 --> 00:47:34.396 A:middle
of UIGesture Recognizer.

00:47:34.396 --> 00:47:37.846 A:middle
So we're going to -- it's going

00:47:37.946 --> 00:47:40.436 A:middle
to have a really
simple implementation

00:47:40.436 --> 00:47:41.416 A:middle
like Josh described.

00:47:41.956 --> 00:47:45.286 A:middle
The first thing we need to do --
oops -- is import the subclass.

00:47:45.286 --> 00:47:48.136 A:middle
But we should do that
in the right place.

00:47:48.576 --> 00:47:53.706 A:middle
And then we're going to
override initWithTarget action,

00:47:54.136 --> 00:47:54.896 A:middle
called super.

00:47:54.896 --> 00:47:59.396 A:middle
And then do one thing
which is to set touches --

00:47:59.596 --> 00:48:01.076 A:middle
delaysTouchesBegan to yes.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.596 --> 00:48:01.076 A:middle
delaysTouchesBegan to yes.

00:48:01.586 --> 00:48:04.276 A:middle
As Josh mentioned, the only
purpose for this thing is

00:48:04.276 --> 00:48:06.036 A:middle
to delay touches to its view.

00:48:06.566 --> 00:48:09.486 A:middle
So we need the
delaysTouchesBegan flag on.

00:48:10.026 --> 00:48:11.566 A:middle
And then -- sorry.

00:48:11.626 --> 00:48:17.276 A:middle
One step ahead of myself.

00:48:17.576 --> 00:48:24.016 A:middle
We need a timer in the --
as an Ivar of this guy.

00:48:24.016 --> 00:48:28.206 A:middle
And then we're going to set
that timer in touchesBegan.

00:48:28.926 --> 00:48:30.416 A:middle
So we'll schedule it.

00:48:31.196 --> 00:48:33.986 A:middle
Give it an interval
of .15 seconds.

00:48:33.986 --> 00:48:36.936 A:middle
And then when the
timer fires we're going

00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:39.646 A:middle
to just call this fail method
that I'm about to write.

00:48:40.706 --> 00:48:44.986 A:middle
And in the fail method we
will simply set our state

00:48:45.146 --> 00:48:47.086 A:middle
to
UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed.

00:48:47.676 --> 00:48:52.986 A:middle
In touchesEnded and
touchesCancelled,

00:48:52.986 --> 00:48:55.586 A:middle
we're also just going to fail.

00:48:55.796 --> 00:48:58.776 A:middle
And finally, when
we're told to reset,

00:48:59.076 --> 00:49:01.106 A:middle
we're going to just get rid
of that timer; clear it out.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.076 --> 00:49:01.106 A:middle
we're going to just get rid
of that timer; clear it out.

00:49:01.726 --> 00:49:03.896 A:middle
And be ready to go again the
next time a touch comes down.

00:49:05.156 --> 00:49:09.346 A:middle
So I'm going to go back over
to the ViewController now.

00:49:09.866 --> 00:49:12.106 A:middle
And we're going to
import this file.

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:20.956 A:middle
And then I'm just going to make
one of these guys and I'm going

00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:23.156 A:middle
to add it to the canvasView.

00:49:23.386 --> 00:49:27.126 A:middle
Now notice that I'm passing it
a nil target and a nil action.

00:49:27.126 --> 00:49:28.866 A:middle
It's an unusual thing to see

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:30.306 A:middle
when you make a gesture
recognizer,

00:49:30.576 --> 00:49:32.896 A:middle
but this thing never
recognizes, so there's no point

00:49:32.896 --> 00:49:34.076 A:middle
in giving it a target
or an action.

00:49:34.076 --> 00:49:35.626 A:middle
If I did, than they
would never be invoked.

00:49:36.186 --> 00:49:39.156 A:middle
So it's really just the
existence of this thing,

00:49:39.156 --> 00:49:41.286 A:middle
and the fact that it's attached
to a view that it's going

00:49:41.356 --> 00:49:43.246 A:middle
to have the effect that we want.

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:45.626 A:middle
I'm going to add it to my
canvasView so that the dots

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:47.956 A:middle
in the canvas get
this same behavior

00:49:48.206 --> 00:49:50.006 A:middle
as the dots in the ScrollView.

00:49:50.686 --> 00:49:52.476 A:middle
So go ahead and run this.

00:49:53.026 --> 00:49:57.276 A:middle
And now if I start a pan
in one of these dots --

00:49:57.276 --> 00:50:01.216 A:middle
if I do it slowly enough, than
you can see a highlight --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:57.276 --> 00:50:01.216 A:middle
if I do it slowly enough, than
you can see a highlight --

00:50:01.216 --> 00:50:01.996 A:middle
oops I picked that one up.

00:50:02.196 --> 00:50:03.216 A:middle
But if you do it fast enough,

00:50:03.216 --> 00:50:05.266 A:middle
you'll see that there's
no longer a flash

00:50:05.776 --> 00:50:07.256 A:middle
as I start scrolling.

00:50:07.256 --> 00:50:11.546 A:middle
And so we're getting
exactly the same behavior

00:50:11.546 --> 00:50:12.696 A:middle
that we have in the ScrollView.

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:16.856 A:middle
So we're going to show
you one more thing.

00:50:17.126 --> 00:50:19.626 A:middle
Another sort of small
element of polish

00:50:19.956 --> 00:50:21.316 A:middle
that we can add to
this application.

00:50:21.576 --> 00:50:23.896 A:middle
And I want to show
you the problem first.

00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:27.056 A:middle
Notice that some of these
dots here are extremely small.

00:50:27.376 --> 00:50:31.386 A:middle
In fact I think I'm generating
their radius' randomly,

00:50:31.386 --> 00:50:34.586 A:middle
but they are as small
as a radius of 10.

00:50:34.856 --> 00:50:36.776 A:middle
Which makes the whole
thing only 20 points wide.

00:50:37.436 --> 00:50:40.766 A:middle
In general it's pretty difficult
to hit a view with you finger

00:50:40.766 --> 00:50:44.276 A:middle
if it's less than 44
points wide or tall.

00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:47.456 A:middle
So although it's very easy
for me to pick these things

00:50:47.456 --> 00:50:48.906 A:middle
up in the simulator
using my mouse,

00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:50.836 A:middle
it would be quite
difficult to hit them

00:50:51.076 --> 00:50:52.046 A:middle
if I were using my finger.

00:50:52.206 --> 00:50:56.246 A:middle
So we want to show you a
technique that we can use

00:50:56.576 --> 00:51:01.266 A:middle
to make very small user
interface elements hittable.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:56.576 --> 00:51:01.266 A:middle
to make very small user
interface elements hittable.

00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:03.146 A:middle
And so I'm going to bring
Josh back up on stage

00:51:03.246 --> 00:51:04.776 A:middle
to explain how we
can accomplish that.

00:51:05.516 --> 00:51:10.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:51:11.076 --> 00:51:11.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:51:11.346 --> 00:51:13.936 A:middle
So we promised three
sections and three techniques.

00:51:13.976 --> 00:51:16.896 A:middle
But we've got a little bonus
extra bit here at the end.

00:51:17.926 --> 00:51:19.576 A:middle
We're still going to talk
about hitTesting though.

00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:22.296 A:middle
So it's still within the
three areas of touch handling

00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:24.556 A:middle
that I promised so we
haven't strayed that far

00:51:24.556 --> 00:51:25.916 A:middle
from my original statement.

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.416 A:middle
As Eliza mentioned,
what we're trying

00:51:28.416 --> 00:51:31.016 A:middle
to do here is enforce a
minimum hit target size.

00:51:31.466 --> 00:51:34.196 A:middle
Now she mentioned 44 and
threw that number out.

00:51:34.196 --> 00:51:35.596 A:middle
The reason that she
mentioned that is

00:51:35.596 --> 00:51:36.706 A:middle
because it's a common number

00:51:36.706 --> 00:51:38.266 A:middle
that you'll find
throughout UIKit.

00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:41.256 A:middle
If you look at the default
bar heights for things

00:51:41.256 --> 00:51:44.626 A:middle
like tool bars; or the default
row heights for tableView cells,

00:51:44.946 --> 00:51:47.486 A:middle
44 is a common number that
you're going to find come up.

00:51:47.926 --> 00:51:49.316 A:middle
It's a good rule of
thumb of something

00:51:49.316 --> 00:51:51.046 A:middle
that if you start
getting smaller than this,

00:51:51.046 --> 00:51:53.456 A:middle
it's hard to hit this thing.

00:51:53.696 --> 00:51:55.806 A:middle
So to figure out how
we're going to go

00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:58.136 A:middle
and resolve this situation,
we're going to go back and look

00:51:58.136 --> 00:51:59.286 A:middle
at hitTest:withEvent again.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:00.106 --> 00:52:01.306 A:middle
Now there's a couple
ways you could do it.

00:52:01.306 --> 00:52:02.636 A:middle
You could just make
your view bigger.

00:52:02.636 --> 00:52:04.176 A:middle
That would obviously
make it hittable.

00:52:04.546 --> 00:52:06.556 A:middle
But in the case of
what Eliza's looking

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:09.296 A:middle
at in our sample app right now,
if we made the view bigger,

00:52:09.296 --> 00:52:11.576 A:middle
that would actually make
the circle draw bigger.

00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:14.526 A:middle
Because she's drawing it
based on the size of the view.

00:52:15.026 --> 00:52:17.556 A:middle
So if we were going to
fix the hitTesting problem

00:52:17.556 --> 00:52:19.836 A:middle
by changing the view size, then
we'd have to go refactor a bunch

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:21.796 A:middle
of other stuff and change
the way we draw the view

00:52:21.796 --> 00:52:22.596 A:middle
to account for that.

00:52:22.596 --> 00:52:24.636 A:middle
And that could end up
making things more complex.

00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:25.976 A:middle
And a bigger change
than we really mean.

00:52:27.006 --> 00:52:28.266 A:middle
So let's go back and
look with our hitTest

00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:30.216 A:middle
with event method again
and see if there's anything

00:52:30.216 --> 00:52:31.326 A:middle
in here that might help us.

00:52:32.656 --> 00:52:34.346 A:middle
Well if we focus in on
this part that I mentioned

00:52:34.346 --> 00:52:37.086 A:middle
at the beginning, we've got
one check right off the bat

00:52:37.126 --> 00:52:39.306 A:middle
that says, is the point
inside our bounds?

00:52:40.026 --> 00:52:41.786 A:middle
Now I wrote this in
some pseudo code here,

00:52:41.786 --> 00:52:44.456 A:middle
so it's not exactly
clear what that means.

00:52:44.776 --> 00:52:46.596 A:middle
So let's expand it out
to what it really does.

00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:49.796 A:middle
It's going to go and call
a method called pointInside

00:52:49.796 --> 00:52:52.486 A:middle
withEvent on the view that's
being asked to hitTest itself.

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:54.976 A:middle
Now the reason that that's
interesting to know is

00:52:54.976 --> 00:52:56.966 A:middle
because it means there's
another override point

00:52:56.966 --> 00:52:58.996 A:middle
where you can change the
behavior of hitTest:withEvent

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.026 A:middle
without changing hitTest itself.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.026 A:middle
without changing hitTest itself.

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:03.986 A:middle
So we can actually
go and override

00:53:04.016 --> 00:53:06.006 A:middle
that method independently
of hitTest with Event

00:53:06.336 --> 00:53:09.216 A:middle
and change what it means for a
point to be with inside of view.

00:53:10.406 --> 00:53:12.036 A:middle
So by default, as I
mentioned what it's going

00:53:12.036 --> 00:53:14.166 A:middle
to do is just check
its own bounds and see

00:53:14.166 --> 00:53:15.366 A:middle
if the point is with inside it.

00:53:15.416 --> 00:53:18.266 A:middle
So we'll call
CGRectContainsPoint bounds,

00:53:18.266 --> 00:53:20.046 A:middle
and the point that
we were checking on.

00:53:20.696 --> 00:53:22.376 A:middle
But we can make this
do whatever we want.

00:53:22.696 --> 00:53:24.726 A:middle
So if we want the view to
behave as if it's bigger

00:53:24.726 --> 00:53:26.976 A:middle
without actually changing its
bounds and making it bigger,

00:53:27.246 --> 00:53:29.456 A:middle
we can subclass and override
pointInside withEvent.

00:53:29.486 --> 00:53:31.566 A:middle
And change the check to do
anything we think is right

00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:33.186 A:middle
for our view that
we're interested in.

00:53:33.946 --> 00:53:36.476 A:middle
So another short section, but
Eliza's going to come right back

00:53:36.476 --> 00:53:38.676 A:middle
up and go ahead and fix
that last bug for us.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:44.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:53:45.316 --> 00:53:45.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:53:45.996 --> 00:53:49.046 A:middle
So here I am in my
DotView subclass.

00:53:49.046 --> 00:53:51.056 A:middle
So I had mentioned that
had written this class.

00:53:51.126 --> 00:53:53.476 A:middle
Pretty much all I do
here is make these dots.

00:53:53.576 --> 00:53:55.046 A:middle
Give them a bunch of
random properties.

00:53:55.286 --> 00:53:57.486 A:middle
Set their corner radius so
that they look like circles.

00:53:57.846 --> 00:54:01.516 A:middle
And what I'm going to do now
below this code that deals

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:57.846 --> 00:54:01.516 A:middle
And what I'm going to do now
below this code that deals

00:54:01.516 --> 00:54:03.866 A:middle
with touches beginning,
ending, and being cancelled,

00:54:03.866 --> 00:54:08.176 A:middle
is I'm going to override
point inside with event.

00:54:08.176 --> 00:54:09.186 A:middle
And I'm going to have to --

00:54:09.236 --> 00:54:11.516 A:middle
I'm going to figure out
whether this dot is a dot

00:54:11.606 --> 00:54:13.876 A:middle
that should get an
expanded touch region.

00:54:14.656 --> 00:54:18.116 A:middle
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is I'm going

00:54:18.116 --> 00:54:21.196 A:middle
to compute what I want to
consider my bounds to be

00:54:21.246 --> 00:54:23.016 A:middle
for the sake of touch handling.

00:54:23.376 --> 00:54:25.546 A:middle
The touch bounds by
default will just start

00:54:25.546 --> 00:54:27.316 A:middle
out with our real bounds.

00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:31.376 A:middle
But if this dot is one whose
radius is small enough --

00:54:31.376 --> 00:54:35.166 A:middle
and I'm going to pick
this 44 points wide idea.

00:54:35.916 --> 00:54:41.616 A:middle
So if the radius is less
than 22 then I'm going

00:54:41.616 --> 00:54:45.166 A:middle
to calculate an expansion --
an amount by which I'm going

00:54:45.166 --> 00:54:47.996 A:middle
to expand my bounds for
the sake of touch handling

00:54:48.416 --> 00:54:52.326 A:middle
as the difference, to get it so
that every dot acts as if it's

00:54:52.326 --> 00:54:54.676 A:middle
at least 44 points
wide when touched.

00:54:54.676 --> 00:54:59.906 A:middle
And then I'm going to use
this handy CGRectInset method

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:00.226 --> 00:55:01.966 A:middle
to expand the touch bounds.

00:55:02.406 --> 00:55:05.056 A:middle
Notice that I'm passing
negative the expansion.

00:55:05.296 --> 00:55:08.006 A:middle
That's because CGRectInset
takes a rectangle

00:55:08.006 --> 00:55:09.296 A:middle
and moves its edges in.

00:55:09.536 --> 00:55:11.426 A:middle
In this case we want
to move the edges out.

00:55:11.426 --> 00:55:12.416 A:middle
So I'm going to do it

00:55:12.416 --> 00:55:15.106 A:middle
by negative the amount
that we computed.

00:55:15.106 --> 00:55:20.946 A:middle
And then finally I'll just
return whether my newly computed

00:55:20.946 --> 00:55:22.786 A:middle
touchBounds contains that point.

00:55:23.726 --> 00:55:26.026 A:middle
So this will have no
effect on large dots,

00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:28.276 A:middle
but it will expand the
touch region for small ones.

00:55:28.856 --> 00:55:30.786 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead
and run this again.

00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:33.876 A:middle
And now -- all right.

00:55:33.876 --> 00:55:36.256 A:middle
So I've got my mouse here and
I'm going to touch outside

00:55:36.256 --> 00:55:38.886 A:middle
of this big dot, and you
can see nothing happens.

00:55:39.096 --> 00:55:40.326 A:middle
The big dot highlights only

00:55:40.606 --> 00:55:42.176 A:middle
when you actually
touch in its bounds.

00:55:42.516 --> 00:55:44.886 A:middle
But for this tiny
dot over here --

00:55:45.706 --> 00:55:46.476 A:middle
let's see, I'll move it up here.

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.556 A:middle
For this tiny dot
I can touch outside

00:55:48.556 --> 00:55:50.096 A:middle
of its bounds and it highlights.

00:55:50.486 --> 00:55:52.656 A:middle
So this looks a little
strange on the simulator

00:55:52.656 --> 00:55:55.536 A:middle
because you have a
high-precision pointing device.

00:55:55.896 --> 00:55:58.296 A:middle
But on a device you
actually really don't notice

00:55:58.766 --> 00:56:00.176 A:middle
that anything is weird.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:58.766 --> 00:56:00.176 A:middle
that anything is weird.

00:56:00.176 --> 00:56:02.376 A:middle
It just feels like you
can pick these guys up.

00:56:03.196 --> 00:56:08.826 A:middle
So that's pointInside overriding
the bounds that's touchable.

in that nice hat today,
he's ready to answer all

00:56:29.546 --> 00:56:31.016 A:middle
of your questions, if
you have anything else

00:56:31.016 --> 00:56:32.726 A:middle
that you want to
know after this.

00:56:33.006 --> 00:56:35.266 A:middle
