[ Applause ]

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:13.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning and welcome.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:15.756 A:middle
My name is Dan Omachi.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.066 A:middle
I work in Apple's
GPU software group

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.276 A:middle
on the OpenGL ES framework.

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.056 A:middle
I also work very closely
with our GPU driver engineers

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.956 A:middle
on improving performance
and implementing features

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:28.146 A:middle
on our graphics hardware.

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:31.446 A:middle
And today I'm going to
talk to you about Advances

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:36.796 A:middle
in OpenGL ES on iOS 7.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.046 A:middle
Apple offers a number
of rendering API's

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.396 A:middle
that are highly optimized
for a variety

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:47.866 A:middle
of specific rendering scenarios
- Core Graphics, Core Animation,

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.956 A:middle
and now Sprite Kit
are among those.

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:54.656 A:middle
They do a ton for you,
and they do it very well.

00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:58.986 A:middle
OpenGL ES, however, offers
the most direct access

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.006 A:middle
to graphics hardware.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.196 A:middle
This enables a lot
of flexibility

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:06.606 A:middle
to create custom effects
and bring something new

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:08.866 A:middle
and innovative into
your rendering.

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:13.836 A:middle
Now, this flexibility can
be a challenge to master.

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.526 A:middle
It's a low-level library,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
and there can be some
stumbling blocks,

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
but if you can utilize
the API to its fullest,

00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:27.866 A:middle
you can bring some
really wild custom effects

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:32.026 A:middle
that people are amazed
by and love.

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:33.606 A:middle
This can make the difference

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:36.686 A:middle
between shipping
a good application

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:40.846 A:middle
that a few people download and
maybe play with for a few days,

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:45.166 A:middle
and something great that people
talk about, use day to day,

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.766 A:middle
and download in droves.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.266 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
So what am I going to
be talking about today?

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.886 A:middle
First, there are a
number of new features

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:57.296 A:middle
in the OpenGL ES API on iOS7.

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.956 A:middle
The first feature I'll
talk about is instancing,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.996 A:middle
and we support two
new extensions

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.036 A:middle
to implement that feature.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:10.175 A:middle
We're also now supporting
texturing in the vertex shader.

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.676 A:middle
I'll talk about why you
might want to do that

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
and how it can be done.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:18.296 A:middle
We're also now supporting
sRGB texture formats,

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:22.756 A:middle
an alternate color
space that you can use.

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:27.196 A:middle
I'll also talk in detail about
how you can utilize the API

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.636 A:middle
and really optimize
it for your needs.

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:33.086 A:middle
I'll give you an
in-depth understanding

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:37.136 A:middle
of the GPU pipeline, which
should give you some insight

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:40.606 A:middle
into the feedback that
our GPU tools provide.

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:42.981 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:45.056 A:middle
But before I get
into any of that,

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:46.356 A:middle
I just want to touch briefly

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.986 A:middle
on a very important
topic: power efficiency.

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.016 A:middle
So rendering requires power.

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:57.786 A:middle
All the GPU's on iOS
are power efficient.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:02.326 A:middle
However, there's still
considerable needed

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:06.086 A:middle
to put vertices into the
pipe and spit out pixels.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:10.596 A:middle
The easiest thing that
your application can do

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:14.826 A:middle
to conserve power is to manage
your frame rate appropriately.

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:18.206 A:middle
You can use the CADisplayLink
API to sync to the display.

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:21.316 A:middle
The display refreshes
60 times a second.

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:24.206 A:middle
So that's really the maximum
frame rate you could possibly

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:28.236 A:middle
achieve, but in many
cases, it really makes sense

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:32.706 A:middle
to just limit your frame rate to
a steady 30 frames per second.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.896 A:middle
You can achieve some
smooth animations,

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:39.856 A:middle
and you're conserving way more
power than rendering at 60.

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.866 A:middle
Additionally, it's not
necessary to render at all

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
if there's no animation
or movement in your scene.

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:49.206 A:middle
You don't have to submit
vertices to the pipe

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:53.236 A:middle
and have pixels produced
if you're just going

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:55.906 A:middle
to show the same thing
you showed a sixtieth

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.966 A:middle
of a second ago or a
thirtieth of a second ago.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:01.686 A:middle
Just blit what's already in
your buffers to the front

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:03.746 A:middle
or don't even blit at all

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.026 A:middle
because nothing's
going to change.

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:10.136 A:middle
This is particularly important
with the multi-layered iOS 7 UI

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.886 A:middle
where there's a lot of
compositing is going on.

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:15.936 A:middle
The UI can skip this compositing
if nothing has changed

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.706 A:middle
in the layer, thereby
saving some power

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:20.906 A:middle
in the compositing operation.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:24.546 A:middle
[Pause] Alright.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:28.626 A:middle
I just wanted to
touch on that briefly.

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:31.506 A:middle
Now I would really like to
get onto the meat of our talk

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:32.506 A:middle
and some of the new features.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.186 A:middle
The first of which
is instancing.

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:38.366 A:middle
If you're familiar at all with
the types of games that are

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:39.926 A:middle
on the App Store, you'll know

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:43.146 A:middle
that the Tower Defense
genre is quite popular.

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.376 A:middle
In these games, you've got
hundreds of enemies trying

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:47.636 A:middle
to storm your fortress.

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:52.466 A:middle
The interesting thing about this
rendering is these enemies often

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:55.186 A:middle
share the same vertex data
and use the same models.

00:04:55.186 --> 00:04:56.556 A:middle
They may be doing
something different.

00:04:56.906 --> 00:04:58.306 A:middle
Some may be running.

00:04:58.306 --> 00:04:59.736 A:middle
Some may be attacking you,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
but it's still the
same base vertex data.

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:05.266 A:middle
Also, maybe you've
seen an adventure game

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:06.526 A:middle
where your hero's running

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:09.406 A:middle
through a forest that's
densely populated.

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:10.856 A:middle
It's got trees all about .

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:14.616 A:middle
You've got trees in different
orientations with branches

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:17.486 A:middle
in different configurations,
but, again,

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:19.176 A:middle
all using the same vertex data.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.426 A:middle
They look distinct, however.

00:05:22.516 --> 00:05:25.876 A:middle
This type of rendering
is a prime candidate

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:27.916 A:middle
for optimization
with instancing.

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:31.626 A:middle
[Pause] Let me start
with a simple example.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:35.126 A:middle
I've got a gear model, and I'd
like to render it 100 times

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.996 A:middle
on the screen as you see here.

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:42.426 A:middle
Without instancing, what I
would do before iOS 7 is,

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:44.416 A:middle
I would create a for
loop, and in this case,

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:47.816 A:middle
I'm going down the width of
the screen via the X axis,

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.806 A:middle
and then within that loop,

00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:53.386 A:middle
I'm going up the
screen on the Y axis.

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:57.966 A:middle
For each iteration, I'm setting
a uniform with the position

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:00.526 A:middle
of my gear, and then
drawing that gear.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:01.746 --> 00:06:06.076 A:middle
That's 100 uniform sets and 100
draw calls, and as you may know,

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:10.336 A:middle
draw calls consume
a lot of CPU cycles.

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:13.766 A:middle
So it would be great if we
could trim that down a bit.

00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:16.796 A:middle
[Pause] Jere's what
instancing does.

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:20.426 A:middle
It allows you to draw
the same model many,

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:22.866 A:middle
many times in a single
draw call.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:28.606 A:middle
Each instance of that model
can have different parameters.

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:32.286 A:middle
You can have different
positions for each model,

00:06:32.356 --> 00:06:36.336 A:middle
a different matrix for each
model, or a different set

00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:37.306 A:middle
of texture coordinates.

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.656 A:middle
Even though it's the
same vertex data,

00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:42.846 A:middle
these models can look
significantly different.

00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:47.626 A:middle
So there are two forms of
instancing that we're shipping

00:06:47.796 --> 00:06:51.466 A:middle
on iOS 7, the first of which
is using an extension called

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:55.266 A:middle
APPLE-instanced-arrays,
and this allows you

00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:57.386 A:middle
to send these instance
parameters

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:59.626 A:middle
down via another vertex array.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:04.046 A:middle
The second form is
Shader Instance ID,

00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:08.346 A:middle
and we support this via an
extension APPLE-draw-instance,

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:11.616 A:middle
and the way this works is
there's a new built-in ID

00:07:11.616 --> 00:07:14.216 A:middle
variable in the vertex
shader that gets incremented

00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:18.056 A:middle
for each instance drawn within
the draw call that you made.

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:22.396 A:middle
[Pause] Let me talk about
the first method here:

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:23.536 A:middle
instanced arrays.

00:07:24.406 --> 00:07:27.696 A:middle
We're introducing a new call
glVertexAttribDivisorAPPLE,

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:30.956 A:middle
which indicates the
attribute array that is going

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:32.616 A:middle
to supply the instance data.

00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:36.046 A:middle
It also indicates the
number of instances

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:40.006 A:middle
to draw before you advanced to
the next element in this array.

00:07:40.436 --> 00:07:46.056 A:middle
You could, for example
have ten instances

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:49.926 A:middle
that use the same
parameter and then move

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:53.916 A:middle
on to the next parameter,
but the most common case is

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:56.206 A:middle
to send a unique parameter

00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:59.706 A:middle
down to each instance
inside your draw call.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:02.256 A:middle
Now we're introducing
two new draw calls

00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
to use this form of instancing.

00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:07.466 A:middle
This includes
glDrawArraysInstancedAPPLE

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:09.126 A:middle
and
glDrawElementsInstancedAPPLE,

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:12.716 A:middle
and these work exactly the
same as the usual glDrawArrays

00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:15.856 A:middle
and glDrawElements, but
there's an extra parameter

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:17.346 A:middle
which indicates the number

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:21.116 A:middle
of instances you
would like to draw.

00:08:21.316 --> 00:08:22.936 A:middle
Alright. Here's our example.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:27.136 A:middle
We've got three vertex
arrays that have model data,

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.976 A:middle
the first of which is the
position, the second normal,

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:35.275 A:middle
and the third is vertex colors,
and we have an extra array

00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:36.816 A:middle
that I'll get to in a minute.

00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:40.895 A:middle
We set up our arrays the
same as we usually do.

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:43.926 A:middle
We use glVertexAttribDivisor
pointer

00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:46.636 A:middle
to specify the location
of the array.

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:50.396 A:middle
It also specifies
things like the type,

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:52.666 A:middle
whether it's unsigned
byte, float, etc.,

00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:56.956 A:middle
whether the elements in it are
normalized or unnormalized,

00:08:56.956 --> 00:09:01.736 A:middle
and the number of scalars or
number of values per element.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:07.206 A:middle
We do this for our per vertex
position here, and, again,

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:12.256 A:middle
for our normal, and then a third
time for our vertex colors.

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:17.006 A:middle
Now we also do the same
thing for this other array,

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:21.726 A:middle
the instance positions, and,
additionally, we make a call

00:09:22.116 --> 00:09:24.376 A:middle
to glVertexAttribDivisor.

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:30.486 A:middle
The first argument here
specifies it's attribute number

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:34.976 A:middle
three that has our per
instance attribute data.

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:37.296 A:middle
These are the per
instance parameters

00:09:37.296 --> 00:09:38.496 A:middle
that we'd like send to OpenGL.

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.066 A:middle
The second argument
here indicates

00:09:41.066 --> 00:09:44.816 A:middle
that each instance
will get its own value.

00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:50.236 A:middle
Alright. We've done the set up.

00:09:50.376 --> 00:09:51.296 A:middle
We're ready to draw.

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:56.846 A:middle
This K argument here: this
indicates the size of our model,

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.566 A:middle
the number of vertices
in our model.

00:09:58.956 --> 00:10:00.776 A:middle
It's the same as
in glDrawArrarys.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:08.486 A:middle
The second or last argument
here, N, is the number

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:10.116 A:middle
of instances we would
like to draw,

00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:13.886 A:middle
and since each instance
is getting a unique value,

00:10:14.306 --> 00:10:17.886 A:middle
we're setting it to the
same value as the number

00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:19.606 A:middle
of elements inside
this instance array.

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:24.726 A:middle
Alright. We're ready
to submit our vertices

00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:28.456 A:middle
to the vertex shader,
and here's what happens.

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:34.826 A:middle
That instance element gets set
the vertex shader, and it's used

00:10:34.826 --> 00:10:37.546 A:middle
for all of the vertices inside

00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:40.346 A:middle
of the vertex array
containing our model.

00:10:41.586 --> 00:10:44.556 A:middle
The second instance is
drawn, in the same draw call,

00:10:44.556 --> 00:10:49.736 A:middle
and we set the second
value here,

00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:52.426 A:middle
and all of the vertices inside

00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:54.686 A:middle
of the model are
submitted to vertex shader.

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:59.836 A:middle
They all use that same value
throughout the entire array.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:04.626 A:middle
And we go through all of
instances in our instance array,

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:08.286 A:middle
and all of them get a unique
instance value, and we submit

00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:11.036 A:middle
for every element inside
that instance array all

00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:12.416 A:middle
of the vertices in our model.

00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:18.466 A:middle
Here's the API set
up...just going over again.

00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:24.056 A:middle
As we usually do, we
call glVertxAttribPointer

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:27.506 A:middle
to indicate how we've
set up our model data.

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:31.996 A:middle
We also call
glVertexAttribPointer

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:37.246 A:middle
for this instance array
and glVertexAttribDivisor.

00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:43.546 A:middle
We're indicating that attribute
three is our instance array,

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:46.926 A:middle
and we're iterating one
element for each instance.

00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:49.436 A:middle
Finally, we're ready to draw.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:54.856 A:middle
We call glDrawArraysInstanced
with the value 100

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:57.266 A:middle
since e're going to
render 100 gears.

00:11:58.606 --> 00:11:59.576 A:middle
Here's the vertex shader.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:05.636 A:middle
As usual, we've got attributes
for our per vertex model data.

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
Here we've got position
and normal.

00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:12.906 A:middle
And another attribute which will
contain our per instance data.

00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:15.056 A:middle
Per instance position.

00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:15.966 A:middle
Not per vertex.

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:16.926 A:middle
Per instance.

00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:21.396 A:middle
And we do a simple add
of that instance position

00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:24.006 A:middle
to the vertex position.

00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:27.486 A:middle
We're displacing all the
vertices by this constant value,

00:12:27.486 --> 00:12:30.136 A:middle
or at least it's constant
throughout that instance.

00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:37.876 A:middle
And, finally, we will transform
our model space position

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:42.046 A:middle
into clip space by transforming

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:45.576 A:middle
with our model view
projection matrix and output

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:47.866 A:middle
to the built-in gl-Position
variable.

00:12:48.176 --> 00:12:51.816 A:middle
We also will do any other
per vertex processing

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:54.136 A:middle
such as maybe computing
color via lighting

00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:57.146 A:middle
or generating texture
coordinates, etc. Alright.

00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:01.596 A:middle
Here's the second method.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:05.716 A:middle
This is using the
instance ID parameter.

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:09.856 A:middle
We've built in this
gl-InstanceIDAPPLE variable

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:10.836 A:middle
inside the vertex shader,

00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:14.076 A:middle
and it gets incremented
once for each instance.

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:17.996 A:middle
You can use this ID
in a number of ways.

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:22.086 A:middle
You can calculate a unique
info for each instance.

00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:25.596 A:middle
You can use the standard
math functions that available

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.976 A:middle
in the vertex shader to
figure out unique details

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:31.426 A:middle
of that instance, or you
can use it as an index

00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:34.826 A:middle
into a uniform array or
a texture, and I'll talk

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:36.986 A:middle
about texturing in a vertex
shader in just a minute.

00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:41.776 A:middle
This method also uses the
same glDrawArraysInstanced

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:45.316 A:middle
or glDrawElementsIntanced
as the previous method.

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:50.636 A:middle
Here's how this works: We call
glDrawArraysInstancedAPPLE,

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:55.616 A:middle
and the instance ID is
set inside the shader,

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:58.466 A:middle
and it's the same value
for all the vertices.

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.996 A:middle
It's incremented for
the next instance,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:02.266 --> 00:14:08.476 A:middle
and we submit all the vertices
using the value of one.

00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:11.726 A:middle
Finally, we iterate through
the entire number of instances

00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:14.206 A:middle
until we get to the
Nth instance,

00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:18.626 A:middle
and we submit all the vertices
for each instance value.

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:21.826 A:middle
And we can reference
that gl-InstanceID

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:22.836 A:middle
within our vertex shader.

00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:27.356 A:middle
And here's what that looks like.

00:14:27.856 --> 00:14:31.756 A:middle
We use this gl-InstanceIDAPPLE
variable,

00:14:31.756 --> 00:14:34.946 A:middle
and it's actually
an integer value,

00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:36.476 A:middle
but we don't have integer math

00:14:36.526 --> 00:14:39.006 A:middle
in the OpenGL ES 100
shading language.

00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:41.656 A:middle
So the first thing we need
to do is cast it to a float

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:46.156 A:middle
so that we can use our floating
point math operations on it.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:51.066 A:middle
And now we perform
a modulo of ten,

00:14:51.386 --> 00:14:54.916 A:middle
which will give us the x
position, and we multiply it

00:14:54.916 --> 00:14:59.046 A:middle
by a gear size, then
we divide by ten

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
to give us the y position.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:01.376 --> 00:15:05.426 A:middle
Now we have an instance
position, which we can add

00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:09.476 A:middle
to our vertex and output
to this temp position.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:12.076 A:middle
And like the other method,

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:15.856 A:middle
we will do our model view
projection matrix multiply,

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:19.116 A:middle
which will put our
position into clip space

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:21.326 A:middle
and give us a position
that we can output.

00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:21.796 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:25.776 A:middle
So that was instancing.

00:15:27.696 --> 00:15:30.996 A:middle
The next feature is
vertex texture sampling.

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:33.346 A:middle
Why would you want a
texture in the vertex shader?

00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:34.726 A:middle
It's not like you can see an
image [in the vertex stage],

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:35.006 A:middle
right?

00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:38.326 A:middle
Well, there are a
number of uses for this.

00:15:39.416 --> 00:15:43.256 A:middle
The first and most obvious
is displacement mapping.

00:15:43.256 --> 00:15:46.306 A:middle
You can put an image
in memory and fetch it

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:48.496 A:middle
in the vertex shader,
and if you've got a mesh,

00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:53.846 A:middle
you can take the values from
that texture and displace

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:57.056 A:middle
that mesh with the
values in the texture.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:00.776 A:middle
You can also use it as an
alternative to uniforms.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:05.916 A:middle
Uniforms have a much smaller
data store whereas textures has

00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.496 A:middle
a very large data store
that you can now access

00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:09.466 A:middle
in the vertex shader.

00:16:10.676 --> 00:16:12.146 A:middle
Here's a height mapping example.

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:15.636 A:middle
On the left, we've got our
grey scale height map image,

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:18.806 A:middle
and on the right, we've
got the results of that.

00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:21.686 A:middle
And here's how we
implemented it.

00:16:22.896 --> 00:16:26.586 A:middle
First, we've got an x and
z position that we've sent

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:28.656 A:middle
down via a vertex array.

00:16:29.816 --> 00:16:30.866 A:middle
Just X and Z.

00:16:30.926 --> 00:16:35.606 A:middle
No Y here, and we have
a height map sampler.

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.906 A:middle
Now this looks exactly like it
would in the fragment shader.

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:40.286 A:middle
This, however, is
a vertex shader,

00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:47.826 A:middle
and this height map is a
reference to a texture.

00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:51.676 A:middle
Now we sample from that texture
and get our Y value from it.

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:54.976 A:middle
Now, it splats the Y value

00:16:54.976 --> 00:16:58.136 A:middle
across all four components
of temp position.

00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:03.046 A:middle
And so we overwrite
the X and Z values

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:03.046 --> 00:17:04.826 A:middle
with the X and Z positions.

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:07.886 A:middle
Now we have X, Y, and Z
inside of our temp position.

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:12.246 A:middle
The Y we just happened to
have gotten from the texture.

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:17.425 A:middle
And as with our other shaders,
we can transform to clip space

00:17:17.476 --> 00:17:19.096 A:middle
and output to gl-Position.

00:17:19.096 --> 00:17:19.526 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:23.415 A:middle
Alright. That's a
pretty simple example

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:26.156 A:middle
of how you might use
vertex texturing.

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:30.236 A:middle
As I mentioned, the more
interesting way you can use this

00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:33.526 A:middle
is to store just about
any kind of generic data

00:17:33.526 --> 00:17:35.756 A:middle
into a texture for
shader access.

00:17:36.246 --> 00:17:39.466 A:middle
It's really just a very large
store of random access memory.

00:17:40.116 --> 00:17:41.966 A:middle
Read-only random
access memory, that is.

00:17:42.906 --> 00:17:45.756 A:middle
Data normally passed in via
a glUniform can be passed

00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:46.546 A:middle
in via a texture.

00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:49.776 A:middle
There are a number
of advantages here.

00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:52.626 A:middle
It's a really, a
much larger store.

00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:56.756 A:middle
We support 4K by 4K textures
on most iOS 7 hardware.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:01.416 A:middle
Whereas uniform arrays are
limited to 128 uniform,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:02.226 --> 00:18:06.506 A:middle
that's four values per uniform,

00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:09.306 A:middle
there's way more storage
inside of a texture.

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:14.146 A:middle
This also enables potentially
less API calls to set the data.

00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:17.896 A:middle
If you load your
texture at app startup,

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:20.946 A:middle
and you have all these values
inside this large data store,

00:18:21.236 --> 00:18:25.316 A:middle
you can just bind the texture,
and it's set up for you to draw.

00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:28.166 A:middle
You don't have to load
a bunch of values to set

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:29.926 A:middle
up for your draw call.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:32.716 A:middle
There's a bit more
variety and types

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:35.946 A:middle
that you can use whereas
uniforms only allow you

00:18:35.946 --> 00:18:37.966 A:middle
to use 32-bit floats.

00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:42.116 A:middle
You can use unsigned byte,
half float, and float.

00:18:42.116 --> 00:18:45.716 A:middle
Any of the texture
types that you can use,

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.756 A:middle
you can use for vertex
texture sampling.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:54.116 A:middle
You can choose the appropriate
type for the data that you'd

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:56.386 A:middle
like to consume in your shader.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.246 A:middle
You can use filtering
with the texture.

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.486 A:middle
Anything you can do
with the texture,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.486 --> 00:19:03.766 A:middle
you can do with a vertex
texture, and filtering is kind

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:06.026 A:middle
of nice because you can average
sequential values that are

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:09.926 A:middle
in your texture,
and with wrapping,

00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:12.056 A:middle
you can actually
average the last value

00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:14.426 A:middle
in your texture with
the first value.

00:19:14.886 --> 00:19:17.776 A:middle
So you can do a wraparound
of averaging.

00:19:18.436 --> 00:19:20.396 A:middle
And because you can
render to a texture,

00:19:20.936 --> 00:19:23.026 A:middle
you can have the
GPU produce data.

00:19:23.586 --> 00:19:27.066 A:middle
Instead of just loading it
in from CPU generated values,

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.426 A:middle
you can render to the
texture and then consume

00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:30.796 A:middle
that data in the vertex shader.

00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:33.326 A:middle
[Pause] Now I'd like
to show you a demo

00:19:33.836 --> 00:19:36.186 A:middle
with some of these features.

00:19:36.906 --> 00:19:42.516 A:middle
Here we have 15,000 asteroids
rotating about this planet,

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.896 A:middle
and this is using what
we call immediate mode.

00:19:47.156 --> 00:19:51.686 A:middle
There is a draw call
for each asteroid here.

00:19:51.686 --> 00:19:54.726 A:middle
So that's over 15,000
draw calls.

00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:58.436 A:middle
Now we're running at
17 frames per second,

00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.086 A:middle
maybe 18 in some case.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.086 --> 00:20:03.406 A:middle
That's alright, I guess.

00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:07.466 A:middle
The real problem here is

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:10.006 A:middle
that we're consuming
a lot of CPU cycles.

00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:12.866 A:middle
We're really leaving
nothing for the app so that

00:20:12.866 --> 00:20:15.666 A:middle
if you've got some logic
there, the frame rate's going

00:20:15.846 --> 00:20:17.756 A:middle
to slow down even more.

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:21.646 A:middle
So what we like to do is
offload this to the GPU.

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:27.446 A:middle
Here we have the
first improvement,

00:20:28.076 --> 00:20:31.186 A:middle
which is using instance
ID, the built-in variable

00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:32.416 A:middle
within our vertex shader.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.896 A:middle
Now what's cool about this
is we're actually rotating

00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:37.366 A:middle
or spinning each asteroid.

00:20:37.776 --> 00:20:40.106 A:middle
They all have unique
values, and,

00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:41.946 A:middle
obviously, unique positions.

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:47.466 A:middle
And here's another mode
that we've implemented.

00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:50.976 A:middle
This uses the
glVertexAttribDivisor method,

00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:54.206 A:middle
and we're getting even a
slightly better frame rate here.

00:20:55.676 --> 00:21:00.006 A:middle
This is due to our pre-computing
all of the rotations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.006 --> 00:21:02.686 A:middle
and position of values
outside the shader,

00:21:02.686 --> 00:21:03.916 A:middle
and we're just passing them in.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:06.496 A:middle
We're not actually doing
much computation inside

00:21:06.496 --> 00:21:07.426 A:middle
of our vertex shader.

00:21:07.926 --> 00:21:10.016 A:middle
What's cool to note
about this is

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:12.736 A:middle
that a few years ago
we presented this

00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:17.536 A:middle
on a Mac Pro with, I
don't know how many cores

00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:19.266 A:middle
and a beefy desktop GPU.

00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:23.536 A:middle
This is really pretty nice
that we are now showing this

00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:25.626 A:middle
to you on an iOS device.

00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:25.786 A:middle
[ Pause ]

[ Applause ]

00:21:25.946 --> 00:21:26.106 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:21:26.106 --> 00:21:35.466 A:middle
Let me talk about some
implementation details here.

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:39.836 A:middle
With that second mode
using the instance ID,

00:21:40.176 --> 00:21:43.716 A:middle
we calculate the transformation
matrix in the vertex shader.

00:21:44.046 --> 00:21:48.526 A:middle
First, we figure out a spin
value by doing a modulo

00:21:48.526 --> 00:21:51.616 A:middle
of our instance ID, and this
gives us some spin value

00:21:51.616 --> 00:21:54.996 A:middle
in radians and we can then use
the cosine and sine functions

00:21:55.246 --> 00:21:56.976 A:middle
to build a rotation matrix.

00:21:57.426 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
We then apply a translation
matrix

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:04.276 A:middle
that gives us the
position of the asteroid.

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:09.186 A:middle
We also use the instance
ID variable to figure

00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
out the positions, and
then we create this matrix.

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:16.576 A:middle
Now the matrix calculations
are done per vertex.

00:22:16.966 --> 00:22:20.846 A:middle
So even though this
matrix will be the same

00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:23.396 A:middle
for the entire asteroid,
which is about 30

00:22:23.396 --> 00:22:28.086 A:middle
to 60 vertices (I think
it's maybe a little bit

00:22:28.086 --> 00:22:30.236 A:middle
on the lower end)
but that's 30 times

00:22:30.236 --> 00:22:33.486 A:middle
that we're calculating this
transformation matrix, at least.

00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:39.216 A:middle
What we'd really like to do is
just create this matrix once per

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:41.576 A:middle
instance, not per vertex.

00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:46.666 A:middle
This is what the instance
arrays method does.

00:22:47.206 --> 00:22:49.976 A:middle
We actually calculate
this matrix array up front

00:22:49.976 --> 00:22:52.396 A:middle
at app startup, or
all these matrices

00:22:52.396 --> 00:22:53.346 A:middle
up front at app startup.

00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:56.026 A:middle
We calculate positions
and rotations.

00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:59.706 A:middle
We stuff that into a
vertex array, and then set

00:22:59.706 --> 00:23:03.306 A:middle
up the vertex array with the
glVertexAttribDivisor call,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:06.226 A:middle
and pass the parameters
down for each asteroid,

00:23:07.446 --> 00:23:08.956 A:middle
not for each vertex.

00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:13.616 A:middle
There are a couple of
advantages and disadvantages

00:23:13.836 --> 00:23:16.866 A:middle
to each of these methods.

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:19.916 A:middle
Using the instance ID method,
we're not using any memory

00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:21.476 A:middle
or really very little memory

00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:23.266 A:middle
because we're doing
all the calculation

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:26.146 A:middle
as needed on the GPU.

00:23:26.586 --> 00:23:29.086 A:middle
Another advantage is
that you're using the GPU

00:23:29.086 --> 00:23:30.526 A:middle
as another computation device.

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:34.626 A:middle
If you're not GPU bound, and
you need the CPU for a lot

00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:38.016 A:middle
of cycles, well, then
this may be the way to go.

00:23:38.956 --> 00:23:42.046 A:middle
But in general you may,
if you have a number

00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:46.616 A:middle
of instances using the GPU, you
could potentially overload it

00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:50.806 A:middle
with computation, which would
really slow it down if you need

00:23:50.806 --> 00:23:51.946 A:middle
to do other computations.

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:55.146 A:middle
So what we've got here
is a different method

00:23:55.146 --> 00:23:57.096 A:middle
where we use instance array.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:24:01.166 A:middle
Instance arrays is generally
faster than computing on the GPU

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:01.446 --> 00:24:03.776 A:middle
since you can save
cycles on the GPU.

00:24:04.246 --> 00:24:09.836 A:middle
There's a lot more flexibility
and types over uniforms.

00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:16.346 A:middle
You can use any type that
a vertex array can use,

00:24:16.346 --> 00:24:20.396 A:middle
including bytes, unsigned
bytes, floats, half floats,

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:26.416 A:middle
etc. Now there's a third method
that I didn't demonstrate,

00:24:26.416 --> 00:24:29.706 A:middle
but this would be to
use the instance ID

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:32.006 A:middle
as an index into a texture.

00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:33.566 A:middle
So instead of passing parameters

00:24:33.566 --> 00:24:38.036 A:middle
down via a vertex attribute
array, you stuff them

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:41.776 A:middle
into a texture and then fetch
using the instance ID variable

00:24:42.736 --> 00:24:46.456 A:middle
to get the location, the
position, and the rotation.

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:48.586 A:middle
Now, as I mentioned before,

00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:52.056 A:middle
the textures are just this large
storage of random access memory.

00:24:53.106 --> 00:24:54.556 A:middle
It's often logically simpler
[to store data in a texture],

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:58.766 A:middle
since you've got a 2D array,
to put tables or any other sort

00:24:58.766 --> 00:25:00.286 A:middle
of data inside of a texture.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.286 --> 00:25:04.096 A:middle
So this is really cool
for bone matrices,

00:25:04.096 --> 00:25:09.246 A:middle
you can use the first row for
the arm matrix, the second row

00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:11.166 A:middle
for the other arm
matrix, the third row

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.176 A:middle
for the leg matrix,
head, and so on.

00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:17.126 A:middle
So it's actually a lot
easier to use a texture

00:25:17.576 --> 00:25:19.356 A:middle
for your bone matrix parameters.

00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:21.621 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:25:21.886 --> 00:25:24.936 A:middle
So here's a summary
of instancing

00:25:24.936 --> 00:25:26.456 A:middle
and vertex texture sampling.

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:29.536 A:middle
Instancing allows you
to draw many models

00:25:29.536 --> 00:25:32.086 A:middle
of the single draw call, which
is particularly important

00:25:32.086 --> 00:25:35.476 A:middle
because draw calls consume
a number of CPU cycles,

00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:38.636 A:middle
and even though it's the same
model that you're drawing,

00:25:39.156 --> 00:25:41.376 A:middle
they can look distinct
since you are passing

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:43.626 A:middle
down different parameters
for each instance.

00:25:44.316 --> 00:25:47.006 A:middle
Vertex texture sampling:
just think of it

00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:51.366 A:middle
as a large data store for
random access read-only memory

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:52.036 A:middle
in the vertex shader.

00:25:52.606 --> 00:25:54.276 A:middle
You can use it with
the instance ID

00:25:54.276 --> 00:25:56.706 A:middle
to fetch per instance
parameters.

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:02.616 A:middle
These extensions and these
features are supported

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[ Pause ]

00:26:07.576 --> 00:26:13.836 A:middle
OK. Let's move on to the third
feature in iOS 7 on OpenGLES.

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:20.276 A:middle
sRGB is an alternate
caller space,

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.996 A:middle
which is more perceptually
correct.

00:26:23.996 --> 00:26:26.046 A:middle
It matches the gamma
curve of displays.

00:26:26.476 --> 00:26:32.266 A:middle
If you're looking at blacks and
greys and whites, what you'd see

00:26:32.266 --> 00:26:36.766 A:middle
with the usual color space
is that you'd move from black

00:26:37.136 --> 00:26:41.706 A:middle
to grey much more quickly
than from grey to white,

00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:43.066 A:middle
which effectively means

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:46.476 A:middle
that your brighter colors
are weighted more heavily

00:26:46.546 --> 00:26:49.656 A:middle
when you're doing averaging
or mixing of colors.

00:26:50.076 --> 00:26:52.876 A:middle
So it's not a linear
distribution.

00:26:53.326 --> 00:26:55.196 A:middle
There's weight on
some of the values.

00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:58.226 A:middle
aRGB compensates for this

00:26:58.226 --> 00:27:00.346 A:middle
by basically applying
an inverse curve

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.346 --> 00:27:02.986 A:middle
so that the darker colors
get a little bit more weight

00:27:02.986 --> 00:27:07.036 A:middle
than usual, and this allows
you to have a linear mixing

00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:10.186 A:middle
when your image is
presented on the display.

00:27:12.576 --> 00:27:14.526 A:middle
Here's some API details.

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:19.196 A:middle
There are two external formats
that you would put your data in.

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:23.156 A:middle
This is sRGB8 and sRGB8-Alpha.

00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:27.206 A:middle
There is an internal
format, SRGB 8 alpha 8,

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:31.986 A:middle
and four compressed internal
formats that you can read

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:34.916 A:middle
from that support
this sRGB color space.

00:27:36.206 --> 00:27:40.396 A:middle
Now the non-compressed
format here is renderable.

00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:44.376 A:middle
This allows you to do linear
blending or color calculations

00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:48.046 A:middle
in the shaders and have them
come up in a linear fashion.

00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:54.336 A:middle
You need to check for the
GL-EXT-sRGB extension string

00:27:54.836 --> 00:27:55.866 A:middle
because this is supported

00:27:55.866 --> 00:28:00.636 A:middle
on all iOS 7 devices
except for the iPhone 4.

This is a great new feature.

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:06.516 A:middle
It's perceptually correct.

00:28:07.266 --> 00:28:09.466 A:middle
However, you don't want
to just turn this on.

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:12.746 A:middle
You'll start getting some
things that may not look right.

00:28:13.886 --> 00:28:15.926 A:middle
You need to author
your textures for it.

00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:19.866 A:middle
You need your artists to keep
the SRGB color space in mind

00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:22.306 A:middle
so that when they're
actually presented,

00:28:22.376 --> 00:28:24.456 A:middle
they look as you
intended them to.

00:28:24.456 --> 00:28:29.626 A:middle
And you should only use these
SRGB textures for color data.

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:32.556 A:middle
Lot of people encode normal maps

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:36.076 A:middle
or just use an alpha
map perhaps.

00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:38.126 A:middle
You shouldn't even
use this for alpha.

00:28:38.126 --> 00:28:41.066 A:middle
Alpha is often thought
of as going with RGB,

00:28:41.266 --> 00:28:44.846 A:middle
but alpha should use
its own linear space.

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:53.266 A:middle
Alright. So a lot of great new
features in the OpenGL ES API,

00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:59.596 A:middle
but you really need to have a
rock solid foundation before you

00:28:59.596 --> 00:29:01.896 A:middle
start adding to your
rendering engines.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:08.046 A:middle
And, fortunately, Apple provides
a slew of excellent GPU tools

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:10.136 A:middle
to help you build
this foundation.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.206 A:middle
The first tool I'd like to talk

00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:15.206 A:middle
about the OpenGLES
frame debugger.

00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:20.826 A:middle
It allows you to capture a
frame of rendering and debug it

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:22.786 A:middle
and play with it and
experiment with it.

00:29:23.566 --> 00:29:26.876 A:middle
Now, there are a ton of
widgets here that I'll

00:29:27.086 --> 00:29:30.346 A:middle
and I'll just go
over a few of them.

00:29:30.556 --> 00:29:32.806 A:middle
The first thing I'd like to
point out is the scrubber bar.

00:29:33.046 --> 00:29:35.176 A:middle
So you've captured a
frame of rendering,

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.776 A:middle
and the scrubber bar
allows you to position

00:29:38.106 --> 00:29:41.696 A:middle
on a particular call
through your frame.

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:47.406 A:middle
You can stop at a draw call or
a bind or a uniform set, etc.,

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.806 A:middle
and you can see what
has just been rendered.

00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:54.546 A:middle
You can see your scene at
it gets built up not only

00:29:54.546 --> 00:29:56.476 A:middle
in the color buffer,
which is on the left,

00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:58.656 A:middle
but also the depth
buffer on the right,

00:29:58.876 --> 00:30:00.736 A:middle
and whatever you've
just rendered,

you've made, shows up in green.

[ Pause ]

00:30:10.296 --> 00:30:13.816 A:middle
You can also examine all of
the contents of context state

00:30:13.816 --> 00:30:15.996 A:middle
at a particular call
inside that frame.

00:30:16.476 --> 00:30:18.236 A:middle
You can see everything
in the context,

00:30:18.236 --> 00:30:20.546 A:middle
the whole state vector
of OpenGL ES.

00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:23.786 A:middle
Everything that's bound,
the programs, textures,

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:26.686 A:middle
etc. Your blend state,
your depth state,

00:30:26.896 --> 00:30:28.076 A:middle
whatever state you'd like.

00:30:28.796 --> 00:30:30.496 A:middle
If you think something
may be going wrong

00:30:30.496 --> 00:30:34.146 A:middle
with the state vector, you
can search in there for it.

00:30:34.816 --> 00:30:39.616 A:middle
But what's even nicer
is that in Xcode 5,

00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:43.966 A:middle
you can now view the
information that pertains

00:30:43.966 --> 00:30:46.476 A:middle
to the particular call
that you're stopped on.

00:30:47.386 --> 00:30:50.356 A:middle
Instead of looking through
all of the context state,

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:53.886 A:middle
you can look at what's really
useful to you at the moment.

00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:58.546 A:middle
Here, I am stopped at
a glUseProgram call.

that pertains to
that GLSL program.

00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:06.076 A:middle
All the uniforms
and their values,

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:11.336 A:middle

00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:30.616 A:middle
You also have an object viewer.

You can view any of the
objects in the OpenGL context.

00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:36.836 A:middle
You can view textures,
vertex buffer objects,

00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:39.696 A:middle
and I think the most
powerful feature here,

00:31:39.696 --> 00:31:43.806 A:middle
the most powerful object
viewer is your shader viewer.

00:31:43.806 --> 00:31:46.866 A:middle

shaders and edit your shader

00:31:46.866 --> 00:31:49.706 A:middle
within it, and hit

on the lower left-hand corner,

00:31:51.306 --> 00:31:53.256 A:middle
which will compile your
shader immediately,

00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:57.526 A:middle
apply it to your scene, and then
you can see how it has changed

compiler error.

00:32:23.396 --> 00:32:28.006 A:middle
of the OpenGL ES frame debugger
is the OpenGL issues navigator.

00:32:28.496 --> 00:32:32.026 A:middle
Here we point out a number
of things that you could do

00:32:32.026 --> 00:32:33.696 A:middle
to improve your rendering.

00:32:33.696 --> 00:32:36.626 A:middle
There's also some
information about things

00:32:36.626 --> 00:32:40.466 A:middle
that may cause rendering
errors, but more importantly,

00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:41.506 A:middle
there is a lot of information

00:32:41.506 --> 00:32:46.526 A:middle
about how you can
improve your performance.

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:50.786 A:middle
Also in Xcode 5, we have the
performance analysis page,

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.286 A:middle
which allows you
to hit this button

00:32:53.286 --> 00:32:57.446 A:middle
in the upper right-hand

as to what you might
like to do next.

do is add a glGetError call

after every single OpenGL call
to stomp out these errors,

00:33:32.756 --> 00:33:37.856 A:middle
Figure out if your OpenGL call
produced some sort of some error

because you sent in
some bad arguments

low-power GPUs,

that you would find on the Mac.

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:22.986 A:middle
There are a number
of optimizations

00:36:23.346 --> 00:36:27.506 A:middle
to reduce the processing load,
which increase performance

Now the architecture
depends heavily on caches

00:36:38.026 --> 00:36:39.416 A:middle
because large transfers

00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:43.616 A:middle

down the pipeline.

transform them into clip space,

and fragment processing,
we defer all of that work

00:38:28.246 --> 00:38:31.016 A:middle
until you call
presentRenderbuffer

00:38:31.246 --> 00:38:34.466 A:middle
or somehow change the
render buffer another way,

00:38:34.466 --> 00:38:38.596 A:middle
by either binding a render
buffer or changing an attachment

00:38:38.706 --> 00:38:40.236 A:middle
to a frame buffer object.

00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:43.686 A:middle
Let's say now we call
presentRenderbuffer.

00:38:44.306 --> 00:38:48.966 A:middle
This, and only now is when
we move to the next stage

00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:56.436 A:middle
of the pipeline, which
is the tiling processor.

00:38:56.466 --> 00:38:58.616 A:middle
Every render buffer
is split into tiles.

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:03.986 A:middle
This allows rasterization
and fragment shading to occur

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:03.986 --> 00:39:07.586 A:middle
on the GPU in little tile-sized
pieces of embedded memory.

00:39:08.236 --> 00:39:11.326 A:middle
We can't push the entire
frame buffer onto the GPU;

00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:12.946 A:middle
that's just way too large.

00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:16.386 A:middle
So we just split up this render
buffer into much smaller tiles,

00:39:16.626 --> 00:39:18.676 A:middle
and then we can render
to those one by one.

00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:24.816 A:middle
Here's what the tile processor
does: It works in groups

00:39:24.816 --> 00:39:26.746 A:middle
of triangles, and it figures

00:39:26.746 --> 00:39:29.186 A:middle
out where the triangles
would be rendered here.

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:30.666 A:middle
Which tile they'll go to.

00:39:31.906 --> 00:39:35.356 A:middle
The larger triangles, which
intersect multiple tiles,

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:37.796 A:middle
may be binned into
these multiple tiles.

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:53.216 A:middle
Here's the first issue
that you could run across -

00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:56.446 A:middle
logical buffer load, and
here's what this means.

00:39:59.176 --> 00:40:02.606 A:middle
The rasterizer uses tile size
embedded memory, as I said.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:06.006 A:middle
Now if there is data already
in this render buffer,

00:40:06.376 --> 00:40:08.636 A:middle
the GPU needs to load
it from unified memory

00:40:08.676 --> 00:40:10.176 A:middle
because you're going
to write on top of it.

00:40:11.346 --> 00:40:13.566 A:middle
This is pretty costly, OK.

00:40:13.566 --> 00:40:16.286 A:middle
We need to reach out
across the bus, pull it in.

00:40:17.606 --> 00:40:20.086 A:middle
Same for the depth buffer:
if there is data in it,

00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:22.846 A:middle
we also need to pull it
in from unified memory.

00:40:27.026 --> 00:40:29.666 A:middle
Fortunately, you
guys can avoid this.

00:40:30.716 --> 00:40:33.016 A:middle
Loading tiles is called
a logical buffer load,

00:40:33.416 --> 00:40:36.586 A:middle
and you can avoid such
a logical buffer load

00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:38.766 A:middle
if you call glClear
before your rendering.

00:40:39.716 --> 00:40:43.246 A:middle
The driver knows that there is
nothing important out in memory

00:40:43.536 --> 00:40:44.736 A:middle
since you're clearing the buffer

00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:47.416 A:middle
so in can just start
rendering to this tile memory.

00:40:47.986 --> 00:40:49.646 A:middle
Great. No load necessary.

00:40:50.096 --> 00:40:52.526 A:middle

Logical buffer loads can happen
in some less obvious ways.

00:40:58.226 --> 00:41:02.516 A:middle
For instance, if we render to a
texture, render to a new buffer

WEBVTT

and then render

00:41:04.086 --> 00:41:05.306 A:middle
to that first texture again.

00:41:05.556 --> 00:41:07.296 A:middle
Here's what happens: we
render to our texture.

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:09.626 A:middle
Now we want to render
to a new texture.

00:41:09.626 --> 00:41:11.446 A:middle
We clear it, and render to that.

00:41:11.646 --> 00:41:16.296 A:middle
Great. Now we would like to
render to our first texture.

00:41:17.056 --> 00:41:18.626 A:middle
Well, logical buffer load.

00:41:19.806 --> 00:41:26.496 A:middle
Need to load both the color
buffer and depth buffer.

00:41:26.626 --> 00:41:34.046 A:middle
Developers should avoid frequent
switching of render buffers.

Don't just say, "hey, you know,

I've finished a pretty
good amount of rendering.

The GPU reads the triangles

00:42:01.806 --> 00:42:04.406 A:middle
and it computes the X

00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:07.236 A:middle
and the Z value,
the depth value.

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.996 A:middle
The fragment shader
is not yet run.

00:42:11.626 --> 00:42:14.436 A:middle
Positions and depth
are calculated only.

00:42:16.676 --> 00:42:20.866 A:middle
This allows an optimization
called hidden surface removal.

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:23.816 A:middle
Now let's say we
submit a triangle,

00:42:23.816 --> 00:42:26.856 A:middle
and it's partially obscured
by another triangle.

00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:29.066 A:middle
Well, a portion of that
triangle is hidden.

00:42:29.066 --> 00:42:31.196 A:middle
W e don't need to run
the fragment shader

00:42:31.436 --> 00:42:32.676 A:middle
on that hidden portion.

00:42:32.986 --> 00:42:36.326 A:middle
That saves us from
fragment shader processing.

00:42:37.036 --> 00:42:38.586 A:middle
We can reject those fragments.

00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:42.726 A:middle
Now this is why we
deferred all the rendering

It's really costly

00:43:08.696 --> 00:43:10.376 A:middle
like implementing an alpha test,

but it defeats the hidden

00:43:14.086 --> 00:43:16.266 A:middle
We submit a triangle

00:47:35.006 --> 00:47:36.796 A:middle
It's worth adding more vertices

Also, we've seen that transfers
between the unified memory

00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:49.706 A:middle
and the GPU are expensive, and
the best things that you can do

00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:52.426 A:middle
to avoid them is to call glClear

00:47:52.426 --> 00:47:53.966 A:middle
to avoid the logical
buffer loads

00:47:54.086 --> 00:47:56.416 A:middle
so that the GPU can just
simply start rendering.

and I want to point
those out to you now.

00:48:21.736 --> 00:48:23.686 A:middle
The first is dependent
texture sampling.

00:48:24.316 --> 00:48:26.756 A:middle
Now this happens if you
calculate a texture coordinate

00:48:27.086 --> 00:48:31.446 A:middle
in the fragment shader and
then sample from that texture

00:48:31.446 --> 00:48:34.226 A:middle
with the texture function.

00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:40.096 A:middle
Here I've got our texture
sampler and two varyings here,

00:48:41.346 --> 00:48:45.196 A:middle
and the first thing I do is
I add these values together

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:49.556 A:middle
to produce a coordinate offset
cord, and I use this offset cord

00:48:49.556 --> 00:48:50.796 A:middle
in the texture function.

00:48:50.796 --> 00:48:54.936 A:middle
Because it's a result of two
previously-calculated varyings,

00:48:55.646 --> 00:48:59.706 A:middle
we now are making
a dependent fetch

00:48:59.706 --> 00:49:02.096 A:middle

a much less obvious example

00:49:07.706 --> 00:49:09.016 A:middle
of a dependent texture read.

00:49:09.376 --> 00:49:14.406 A:middle
Some developers get clever, and
they think, "hey, you know what,

00:49:14.406 --> 00:49:17.226 A:middle
I've got two textures
I want to sample from,

00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:20.596 A:middle
and I only need two scalars

00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:24.626 A:middle
to get a 2D texture
for each texture.

00:49:24.696 --> 00:49:28.596 A:middle
What I'm going to do is pack
them into a single vec4.

00:49:28.656 --> 00:49:31.236 A:middle
So I've got an S and
T texture coordinate

00:49:31.236 --> 00:49:33.456 A:middle
in the first two components
of the vec 4 and another S

00:49:33.456 --> 00:49:34.416 A:middle
and T texture coordinate

00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.676 A:middle
in the second two
components of the vec4.

00:49:36.986 --> 00:49:42.196 A:middle
And then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use the first two

00:49:42.196 --> 00:49:47.646 A:middle
as the first texture coordinate,
make the first texture fetch

00:49:47.646 --> 00:49:51.116 A:middle
with the X and Y and then
a second one with Z and W."

00:49:51.116 --> 00:49:53.796 A:middle
Now these are actually
both dependent reads.

00:49:54.096 --> 00:49:56.796 A:middle
Because what happens is the
texture coordinates need

00:49:56.796 --> 00:50:01.076 A:middle

You don't actually see it,

00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:06.946 A:middle

calculation being done

00:50:07.186 --> 00:50:13.396 A:middle
which makes these
dependent texture read.

Here's why it's bad.

00:50:14.576 --> 00:50:18.196 A:middle
There's a high latency to sample
a texture in unified memory.

00:50:18.936 --> 00:50:21.016 A:middle
Now we avoid this latency

00:50:21.016 --> 00:50:23.356 A:middle
when you're not doing a
dependent texture read

00:50:23.546 --> 00:50:25.236 A:middle
because the rasterizer
says, "Hey,

00:50:25.666 --> 00:50:31.066 A:middle
this triangle uses a texture
in this fragment shader,

00:50:31.066 --> 00:50:32.296 A:middle
and we've already
got the coordinates.

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:35.536 A:middle
So let's signal out to a memory
and pull that data back in,

00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:36.856 A:middle
and soon as we start

00:50:37.186 --> 00:50:39.716 A:middle
that fragment shader,
we'll have the data."

00:50:40.226 --> 00:50:44.156 A:middle
We can't do that if you're
calculating the texture

00:50:46.496 --> 00:50:47.556 A:middle
The shader stalls.

00:50:48.016 --> 00:50:50.236 A:middle
It waits for the data
to come back to it.

00:50:51.016 --> 00:50:53.786 A:middle
So minimize your
dependent texture samples.

00:50:54.526 --> 00:50:55.756 A:middle

that devious shader here.

We've now split that
vec4 into two vec2's.

two separate variables.

Here we've got our varying and

it varies,

it becomes a little bit
difficult for the GPU to manage

00:51:46.806 --> 00:51:51.126 A:middle
because we now test, and the
outcome of that test in the

00:51:51.126 --> 00:51:54.296 A:middle
if statement is dependent
upon the test.

Here's why it's difficult.

00:51:56.676 --> 00:51:58.866 A:middle

We need a special
branch mode for execution

this adds a bit more latency

A branch on a uniform does
not incur that same overhead

that uses both a
dependent texture sample

that while state setting
looks inexpensive,

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:17.126 A:middle
if you make a bind
call or an enable call

00:53:17.126 --> 00:53:20.976 A:middle
or use the new program, and
you profile that or add timers

00:53:20.976 --> 00:53:23.376 A:middle
around it, it doesn't
look like much time,

00:53:23.956 --> 00:53:25.576 A:middle
but that's because
a lot of that time,

00:53:25.576 --> 00:53:28.226 A:middle
a lot of the work is
deferred until draw.

The more state you
set before a draw,

the more expensive
that draw becomes.

Keep the state vector

don't set it in OpenGL

Also a more elegant algorithm
is to use state sorting,

00:54:23.066 --> 00:54:26.656 A:middle

number of state sets.

in the draw are appropriate for
the state that has been set,

Now that's four binds, four
draws, and each draw needs

00:56:40.806 --> 00:56:42.786 A:middle
You can scale your
texture coordinates based

00:56:42.786 --> 00:56:47.486 A:middle
on this property list, enabling
you to render your 3D models

00:56:47.486 --> 00:56:49.936 A:middle
with this texture atlas
that has been produced.

00:56:50.436 --> 00:56:54.956 A:middle
This texture atlas
tool comes with Xcode.

00:56:55.023 --> 00:56:58.306 A:middle
For more information, you
can talk to Alan Schaffer,

00:56:58.306 --> 00:57:00.816 A:middle
our graphics and games
technologies evangelist,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:01.226 --> 00:57:03.086 A:middle
and there's some
excellent documentation

00:57:03.436 --> 00:57:05.056 A:middle
on our developer site.

00:57:05.146 --> 00:57:08.926 A:middle
You can also contact the
community via the developer

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.626 A:middle
forum, and there are
some engineers that lurk

00:57:11.626 --> 00:57:12.676 A:middle
on those forums as well.

00:57:12.676 --> 00:57:16.776 A:middle
So you can get your questions
answered in a lot of detail.

00:57:16.876 --> 00:57:20.416 A:middle
There are a couple
of related sessions.

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:22.626 A:middle
There were 2 Sprite Kit sessions
that happened yesterday,

00:57:22.626 --> 00:57:25.556 A:middle
but you can catch
the video of them.

00:57:25.556 --> 00:57:28.216 A:middle
And the Sprite Kit sessions
talked a little bit more

00:57:28.216 --> 00:57:32.376 A:middle
in detail about their
texture atlas tool.

00:57:32.496 --> 00:57:34.816 A:middle
Later on in the afternoon
there is

00:57:34.816 --> 00:57:37.426 A:middle
"What's new in OpenGL for OS X."

00:57:37.776 --> 00:57:40.406 A:middle
OpenGL ES is derived
from its big brother

00:57:40.406 --> 00:57:41.596 A:middle
on the desktop world.

00:57:41.886 --> 00:57:44.176 A:middle
So you can get a bigger picture

00:57:44.176 --> 00:57:47.106 A:middle
of what's happening
in 3D graphics there.

00:57:47.173 --> 00:57:50.026 A:middle
In summary, you want to reduce
your draw call overhead,

00:57:50.406 --> 00:57:52.146 A:middle
use the techniques
including instancing

00:57:52.146 --> 00:57:54.146 A:middle
and texture atlases to do that.

00:57:54.806 --> 00:57:56.526 A:middle
Consider the GPU's operation

00:57:57.026 --> 00:57:58.886 A:middle
when you're architecting
your rendering engine

00:57:59.196 --> 00:58:01.546 A:middle
and in your performance
investigations.

00:58:01.946 --> 00:58:04.226 A:middle
The GPU tools really
help greatly

00:58:04.226 --> 00:58:07.376 A:middle
in this effort while the
tile-based deferred rendering

00:58:07.376 --> 00:58:10.226 A:middle
architecture has some
special considerations

00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:11.846 A:middle
that you want to think about.

00:58:12.076 --> 00:58:15.186 A:middle
Thank you very much.
