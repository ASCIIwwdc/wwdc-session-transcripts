are the best place to discover

Our stores are filled with
our colleagues who work

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.856 A:middle
at our stores because
they're passionate

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.696 A:middle
about how Apple technology
can enrich people's lives.

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.896 A:middle
Our stores had become
integral parts

of the communities
that they serve.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:23.376 A:middle

pick their local Apple Store

as the destination for
their annual field trip.

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:30.536 A:middle
And millions of customers
come to our stores

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.486 A:middle
for personal training so that
they can learn to get the most

00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:34.756 A:middle
out of their Apple products.

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:39.086 A:middle
We now have 407 stores

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.876 A:middle
It's in a 100 year old building.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:57.206 A:middle
It was originally one of the
first theaters in Berlin.

Now, we're going to
start by sharing some

of the technology
under the hood.

00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.596 A:middle
As we have these cars go
through a few formations,

00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:17.556 A:middle
realize that each of them is
completely driving themselves

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:20.746 A:middle
and our app is coordinating
the entire experience

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:21.846 A:middle
over Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:25.036 A:middle
The cars can control their speed
and they steer on the track

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.746 A:middle
by doing the same computations
your brain does when you drive.

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.376 A:middle
They sense where they're
located and they react

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:32.626 A:middle
to their surroundings
all in real time.

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:37.606 A:middle
This red car, he's
our hero, Aidan.

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.546 A:middle
We designed him and
all the other cars

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:40.776 A:middle
to be incredibly smart.

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.496 A:middle
Five hundred times per
second, they're running logic

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.896 A:middle
to sense a track, their position
on it, adjusting their steering

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:48.936 A:middle
and speed and communicating
back and forth

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:50.216 A:middle
with our AI engine
on that iPhone.

through the pack,

our app knows everything
that's happening in real time.

00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:09.676 A:middle

And just to be clear, none

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:35.436 A:middle
All we're doing is defining
a new objective for each car

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:36.776 A:middle
and they'd figure out the rest.

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:41.016 A:middle
Here, Aiden, he's using the
exact same logic he was using

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:43.616 A:middle
before, sensing where he is
and reacting to the other cars

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:44.606 A:middle

With Anki Drive, we
use this technology

This is double what it
was just five years ago.

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:08.476 A:middle
We announced the new iMac at
the end of last year and it went

00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:11.166 A:middle
on to become the number
one desktop in the US.

00:15:12.136 --> 00:15:16.066 A:middle
And the MacBook has
continued to define the future

00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:19.516 A:middle
of the notebook and is the
number one notebook in the US.

00:15:20.716 --> 00:15:24.006 A:middle
In fact, the Mac business
has outpaced the PC business

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.646 A:middle
for several years now.

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:28.106 A:middle
And if you look at
the last five years,

00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:32.136 A:middle
the average annual growth
rate isn't even close.

00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:35.946 A:middle
And if you look at the total
growth over that period of time,

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:39.116 A:middle
the Mac is at a 100 percent

00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle

Now, we have lots of innovation
for the Mac last year and one

00:16:10.956 --> 00:16:14.196 A:middle
of those was announced
here with Mountain Lion.

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:18.046 A:middle
Mountain Lion of course is
our latest release of OS X.

00:16:18.766 --> 00:16:21.316 A:middle
We shipped 28 million copies

00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:25.226 A:middle
since we announced it making
it the best selling release

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:25.656 A:middle
of all time.

00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:30.266 A:middle

impressive is that 35 percent

latest version of using--

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:36.056 A:middle
are using Mountain Lion.

Windows 8 which is kind

to talk to you

about what we're
doing with OS X.

Good morning, let's
talk about OS X.

00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:21.336 A:middle
Our latest release,
Mountain Lion, is the ninth

00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:25.336 A:middle
of our big cat-named releases
in just over a decade.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:29.016 A:middle
As we turn our attention
now toward the 10th,

00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:30.736 A:middle
we've hit a real issue.

00:17:31.686 --> 00:17:37.346 A:middle
We do not want to be the
first software in history

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:42.536 A:middle
to be delayed due to a
dwindling supply of cats.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:47.876 A:middle
Now, fortunately, we do have
a creative group at Apple

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:49.456 A:middle
and we can think out of the box.

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:52.926 A:middle
And so, we thought, may be
we could take this lion thing

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:53.936 A:middle
in a different direction.

00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:57.926 A:middle

to you today OS X Sea Lion.

That could be a bit

In fact, we're really excited
about the future of the Mac

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:17.856 A:middle
and we want a set of names
that are going to carry us

And, you know, the answer really
was really obviously to us.

00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:28.876 A:middle
It's those places that
inspire us here in California,

on extending battery life

It has great new apps and
enhancements for every Mac user,

to really appeal
to our power users.

about just three

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:25.516 A:middle
of them right now
starting with Finder Tabs.

Sounds like you guys you know
how this is going to work.

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
So, you of course can
work in the Finder

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:37.716 A:middle
with multiple windows.

00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:39.146 A:middle
It's a very powerful tool.

00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:42.406 A:middle
But now you can draw all those
windows together in tabs.

00:19:42.696 --> 00:19:46.616 A:middle
And each tab can have its own
location, its own view mode.

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:47.766 A:middle
It's a really powerful tool.

00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:50.636 A:middle
You can actually drag
contents and hover across tabs.

00:19:51.076 --> 00:19:53.126 A:middle
And of course, now that we
have Tabs in the Finder,

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:56.066 A:middle
it's also a great app
to take full screen.

00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:59.386 A:middle
Next, Tagging.

tagging to the Mac.

00:20:08.026 --> 00:20:10.346 A:middle
So now, when you
save a document,

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:12.906 A:middle
in addition to providing
its location

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:14.676 A:middle
and name, you can tag it.

00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:17.786 A:middle
And when you do, it will appear
right in the Finder sidebar.

00:20:17.786 --> 00:20:21.486 A:middle
And in fact, you can tag
things wherever they are,

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.906 A:middle
whether they're in iCloud
or on a local file share,

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:27.906 A:middle
and all those will be brought
together and appear in Finder.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:32.936 A:middle
And, tags are great for really
powerful search as well.

00:20:33.956 --> 00:20:35.336 A:middle
Next-- yeah.

00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:37.716 A:middle
Next, Multiple Displays.

00:20:37.926 --> 00:20:38.206 A:middle
Really, all right.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:48.426 A:middle

giving you all the free multiple

display here.

00:20:49.106 --> 00:20:50.636 A:middle
This is software.

00:20:51.096 --> 00:20:54.796 A:middle
So, with multiple
displays in the Mac,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.186 A:middle
it's always been a powerful
way to spread out your work.

00:20:57.186 --> 00:21:01.146 A:middle

You can summon your DOC

full screen on one display,

00:21:09.156 --> 00:21:11.156 A:middle
it doesn't mess with your

When you pan your spaces,
you can do it independently

AirPlay-connected HDTV,

00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:37.736 A:middle
it acts as a full power
separate display as well and I'd

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:39.626 A:middle

these to you now.

00:21:47.996 --> 00:21:50.236 A:middle
and we're going to
start with the Finder.

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:54.626 A:middle
So, here's Finder environment,
I got a lot going on,

00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:56.846 A:middle
a lot of windows, a lot
of different locations.

00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:58.856 A:middle
I'm going to go up
here to the Window Menu

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.316 A:middle
and let's merge all my windows.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
Just like that, they
hop into a set of tabs.

00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:07.936 A:middle
Now, of course, these tabs
at different locations,

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:10.686 A:middle
different view settings for
each to those locations.

00:22:11.346 --> 00:22:13.466 A:middle
Creating a tab is
just as you'd expect.

00:22:13.576 --> 00:22:14.486 A:middle
Just click Plus.

00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:18.056 A:middle
I can select another location
like AirDrop, may be another

00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:20.306 A:middle
for this Work File Share.

00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:21.426 A:middle
I'm going right here.

00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:25.446 A:middle
And now that I have multiple
tabs, it's a really great way

00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:27.136 A:middle
to actually work
and copy documents.

00:22:27.136 --> 00:22:29.346 A:middle
If I want to copy this field
report, I can just hover

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:34.366 A:middle
over the AirDrop tab, drop it
just like that, really nice.

00:22:35.006 --> 00:22:40.526 A:middle
And, of course, I can now
take Finder full screen.

00:22:41.636 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
Next, let's take
a look at tagging.

00:22:43.976 --> 00:22:44.906 A:middle
This is really cool.

00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:46.716 A:middle
So as I go to save a document,

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:50.136 A:middle
you know as I can give it a name
like, let's say, Project Plan.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.486 A:middle
And in addition to its
location, in this case,

00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:55.036 A:middle
I'm going to save it in
iCloud, I can also give it a tag

00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:56.326 A:middle
from any of the tags
I've made up.

00:22:56.326 --> 00:22:59.066 A:middle
So I'm going to call
this document Important.

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
Looks pretty important to me.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:04.196 A:middle
And we'll go here into
the Finder and you see

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.676 A:middle
in the Finder sidebar,
I have an Important tag

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:08.026 A:middle
and I see all these documents.

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
They're from different
locations,

00:23:09.216 --> 00:23:12.596 A:middle
different applications, all
drawn together in sidebar.

00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:14.046 A:middle
We have other tags.

00:23:14.046 --> 00:23:16.836 A:middle
I've given things for things
that are draft and in review.

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:18.146 A:middle
Now, of course with tags,

00:23:18.226 --> 00:23:20.666 A:middle
I can assign multiple
tags to the same document.

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:21.936 A:middle
That's part of the
power of tags.

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:25.256 A:middle
So I go here and I'm going to
say this one is also in review.

00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:27.966 A:middle
And you notice, as I sign
that tag, it now appears

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:29.336 A:middle
in that location as well.

00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:33.046 A:middle
And if I want to assign a
totally new tag, I want to make

00:23:33.046 --> 00:23:35.506 A:middle
up a tag on the fly, you
can just type it right here.

00:23:35.506 --> 00:23:37.256 A:middle
This is a website
project I'm working on.

00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:39.026 A:middle
It's says Create
New Tag Website.

00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:42.106 A:middle
And just like that,
I've created a new tag

00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:44.846 A:middle
and you can see it right
here in the Finder.

00:23:45.456 --> 00:23:47.716 A:middle
I can give that tag
a color of course.

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:51.606 A:middle
And now that I have that
tag, I can also assign tags

00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:54.836 A:middle
by just dragging things in
to the Tagger and the Finder.

00:23:55.026 --> 00:23:58.526 A:middle
So different assets from my
website, just drag them in

00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:00.076 A:middle
and they're tagged like that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
And tags are great
for searching.

00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.486 A:middle
So if I start typing,
let's say, Important,

00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:08.126 A:middle
it can find all documents
that are important.

00:24:08.216 --> 00:24:10.476 A:middle
Let's go to All My Files,
we'll find all documents,

00:24:10.476 --> 00:24:14.416 A:middle
they're both important
and that are in review.

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:18.506 A:middle
Just like that, I found exactly
what I'm looking for with tags.

00:24:19.516 --> 00:24:24.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:25.326 --> 00:24:27.476 A:middle
Next, let's take a look
at Multiple Displays.

00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:29.676 A:middle
I'm going to open up some
other kind of windows

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:31.136 A:middle
that I'm often working with.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:35.086 A:middle
We'll open iPhoto here, may
be a keynote presentation.

00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:37.426 A:middle
And I actually have a
second display connected

00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:38.446 A:middle
to this MacBook Pro.

00:24:38.446 --> 00:24:40.726 A:middle
Let's show that up
there on display now.

00:24:40.726 --> 00:24:42.576 A:middle
Of course with multiple
displays,

00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:46.456 A:middle
I can just move windows across
displays like you'd expect.

00:24:47.046 --> 00:24:50.306 A:middle
But now, I can get up at my
Menu bar in the second display.

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:51.646 A:middle
If I go down to the bottom,

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:54.136 A:middle
I can summon the
DOC just like that.

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:57.226 A:middle
If I want to open an app on the
second display, I can just open

00:24:57.226 --> 00:24:59.826 A:middle
that on the DOC here
and here is iTunes.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:03.436 A:middle
Take this app full
screen just like that.

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:06.876 A:middle
And as I swipe spaces,
just right back there.

00:25:06.876 --> 00:25:09.836 A:middle
Just on that display, let's take
a keynote full screen as well.

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:13.236 A:middle
I'm going to go back to
my first display here.

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:15.956 A:middle
Let's even take iPhoto
full screen.

00:25:15.956 --> 00:25:17.546 A:middle
So now, I have different
full screen apps

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:18.696 A:middle
on my different displays.

00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:20.316 A:middle
This is actually really
fantastic way to work.

00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:23.996 A:middle
Go in here into Favorite Travels
and I can now drag assets

00:25:23.996 --> 00:25:27.896 A:middle
across my full screen apps
like that, super cool.

00:25:28.266 --> 00:25:30.996 A:middle
And, Mission Control has
just been super charged

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:31.916 A:middle
for multiple displays.

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:34.586 A:middle
So, I'm going to go now
into Mission Control

00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:37.626 A:middle
and we see my different
full screen spaces

00:25:37.886 --> 00:25:40.706 A:middle
and desktops across
applications.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:43.266 A:middle
I can drag a window from
one display to another.

00:25:43.266 --> 00:25:47.156 A:middle
I can also go and drag
a full screen app right

00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:50.266 A:middle
across displays, bring
Preview open, and now I have

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:52.376 A:middle
that full screen on
this display as well.

00:25:53.516 --> 00:25:57.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:02.366 A:middle
Finally, I actually have
an Apple TV around here.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:03.486 A:middle
Let's bring that into place.

00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:05.196 A:middle
So here's my Apple TV.

00:26:05.486 --> 00:26:08.046 A:middle
Now, this is pretty
over the top.

00:26:08.046 --> 00:26:11.816 A:middle
So I can actually go
here into AirPlay.

00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:13.856 A:middle
I'm going to connect
to this Apple TV.

00:26:14.846 --> 00:26:18.856 A:middle
So now, it's a full
power display as well.

00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:21.616 A:middle
You can see I have my
Menu bar and my DOC.

00:26:22.336 --> 00:26:25.096 A:middle
I can go over here
and get my DOC here.

00:26:25.716 --> 00:26:28.806 A:middle
And, I can go into
Mission Control, even,

00:26:28.946 --> 00:26:33.046 A:middle
and I can go get a window
across that other display.

00:26:34.476 --> 00:26:35.886 A:middle
We'll just drag Keynote
over here,

00:26:36.656 --> 00:26:40.186 A:middle
right on to my Apple
TV, and open it up.

00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:42.916 A:middle
There it is, full
displays in Mavericks.

[ Applause ]

00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:50.826 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk

00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:54.406 A:middle
about some advanced
technologies in Mavericks.

00:26:55.206 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
You know, our power users are
increasingly doing their work

00:26:58.476 --> 00:26:59.276 A:middle
on the go.

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
They want great responsiveness

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:03.226 A:middle
but they also want
great battery life.

00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:06.626 A:middle
And in Mavericks, we've
introduced a whole host

00:27:06.626 --> 00:27:09.146 A:middle
of technologies to
address that challenge.

00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.086 A:middle
Things like Compressed Memory

00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.716 A:middle
that make sure you have
memory available very quickly

00:27:13.716 --> 00:27:14.816 A:middle
when apps demand it.

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:16.766 A:middle
Technologies like App Nap

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:19.436 A:middle
that actually makes sure
we're directing power only

00:27:19.436 --> 00:27:20.456 A:middle
to those applications

00:27:20.596 --> 00:27:22.086 A:middle
where you're really
benefiting from it.

00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:25.656 A:middle
System-wide Core Animation
Accelerated Scrolling

00:27:25.656 --> 00:27:28.936 A:middle
and OpenGL 4 for super
responsive graphics.

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:30.966 A:middle
And, a topic I want to go

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:33.966 A:middle
into in a bit more detail
now, Timer Coalescing.

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:38.446 A:middle
So you know, when you look at
battery life on your computer,

00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:41.316 A:middle
the real factor that software
has the most influence

00:27:41.316 --> 00:27:44.596 A:middle
over is CPU activity
and its draw on power.

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.736 A:middle
And if you look at what
your system is doing

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:50.466 A:middle
at any given time, what
you'll see as you look

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:53.876 A:middle
under the hood is not a smooth
line, but actually hundreds

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:56.396 A:middle
of interrupts occurring per
second where the system is going

00:27:56.396 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
from a power-efficient
sleep state up to a state

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
of high power use and back down.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:05.326 A:middle
And all of those transitions
actually consume a lot of power.

00:28:05.856 --> 00:28:09.396 A:middle
Well in Mavericks, we
intelligently align all

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:12.076 A:middle
of that work, reducing those
numbers of transitions.

00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:15.506 A:middle
This, in combination with
technologies like App Nap

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:20.476 A:middle
and other power optimizations,
reduce CPU utilization activity

00:28:20.476 --> 00:28:23.666 A:middle
for these kinds of
scenarios up to 72 percent.

00:28:24.176 --> 00:28:24.976 A:middle
It's pretty awesome.

00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:31.666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:34.076 A:middle
Next, let's talk about
Compressed Memory.

00:28:34.876 --> 00:28:37.256 A:middle
Nothing affects the
performance of your Mac,

00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:39.406 A:middle
the responsiveness more of
a Mac, that's under load

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:42.466 A:middle
than its ability to provide
free memory to an app.

00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:45.146 A:middle
Now, typically, when you
look at your app runtime,

00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:46.836 A:middle
all your memory is inactive.

00:28:46.836 --> 00:28:49.726 A:middle
In fact, a subset of your
memory is actively being used

00:28:50.116 --> 00:28:52.156 A:middle
and others is memory
we have to keep around

00:28:52.326 --> 00:28:53.806 A:middle
but isn't being used by the app.

00:28:54.206 --> 00:28:57.956 A:middle
Well, now if you open a
document, your system is going

00:28:57.956 --> 00:29:00.926 A:middle
to need to get free memory
and it does that in the past

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:03.866 A:middle
by writing those inactive
bits of memory out to disk,

00:29:03.866 --> 00:29:05.106 A:middle
and that's a slow process.

00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:07.956 A:middle
Now, with Compressed Memory,

00:29:08.076 --> 00:29:11.526 A:middle
we're able to rapidly compress
the inactive memory making free

00:29:11.526 --> 00:29:13.786 A:middle
space available almost
instantaneously

00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:14.636 A:middle
to the application.

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:17.856 A:middle
This can have great
effects on responsiveness

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:18.876 A:middle
of systems under load.

00:29:19.296 --> 00:29:21.886 A:middle
You see, 1.4X kinds
of improvements,

00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:24.596 A:middle
even on fast SSD
systems for activities

00:29:24.736 --> 00:29:27.616 A:middle
like opening new documents
or reactivate an application,

00:29:27.976 --> 00:29:32.086 A:middle
and up to 1.5X improvement for
waking a system from standby,

00:29:32.886 --> 00:29:36.386 A:middle
these are just two of
many improvements to power

00:29:36.386 --> 00:29:38.106 A:middle
and performance in Mavericks.

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:40.716 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Safari.

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
In the last decade of life,
Safari is focused not just

00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:48.336 A:middle
on providing the easiest to use

00:29:48.336 --> 00:29:50.226 A:middle
and most elegant
browsing experience,

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:52.486 A:middle
but also the most innovative.

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:55.616 A:middle
These are the kinds
of innovations

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:58.236 A:middle
that Safari has brought,
private browsing,

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:00.896 A:middle
blocking of third party
cookies for privacy,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:01.256 --> 00:30:03.656 A:middle
making the web easier to read
with features like Reading List,

00:30:03.746 --> 00:30:08.186 A:middle
and the HTML5 audio and
video tag, all Safari-firsts.

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:10.326 A:middle
And the engine in
Safari, WebKit,

00:30:10.326 --> 00:30:14.246 A:middle
is used by over 1.5
billion devices.

00:30:15.156 --> 00:30:18.456 A:middle
Well in Mountain Lion, we're
making Safari even better.

00:30:19.126 --> 00:30:22.236 A:middle
We have a great clean new
homepage with top sites.

00:30:22.596 --> 00:30:27.066 A:middle
From there, you can get at great
sidebar where you have access

00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:29.916 A:middle
to all of your bookmarks
and you can browse right

00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:30.856 A:middle
from your bookmarks.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:34.726 A:middle
And in that sidebar, we
also have Reading List

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:37.216 A:middle
where now you can
continuously scroll

00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:39.776 A:middle
through your articles moving
from article to article

00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:40.886 A:middle
without ever having to click.

00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:46.556 A:middle
And a great new feature called
Shared Links where you see all

00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:48.566 A:middle
of the links shared by
people you're following

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:49.806 A:middle
on Twitter and LinkedIn.

00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:51.196 A:middle
You can browse them right here.

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:55.966 A:middle
Now in addition to these
end-user improvements,

00:30:56.116 --> 00:30:59.776 A:middle
there's also a lot going on
under the hood, big improvements

00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:03.286 A:middle
to JavaScript, a full
process-per-tab architecture,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:05.066 A:middle
and memory efficiency
improvements

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:08.396 A:middle
with the shared memory resource
cache, and a whole bunch

00:31:08.426 --> 00:31:10.476 A:middle
of big power savings as well.

00:31:11.016 --> 00:31:11.846 A:middle
When you look at the effects

00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:13.466 A:middle
of these changes,
it's pretty profound.

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:16.906 A:middle
If you take a synthetic
benchmark like SunSpider,

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:20.276 A:middle
you see how Safari fairs
against the competition.

00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:22.576 A:middle
But, you know, researchers
have started to look

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:26.626 A:middle
at more real world JavaScript
by sampling the JavaScript

00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:27.876 A:middle
that actually occurs on sites

00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:31.226 A:middle
like the Google homepage,
Facebook, Amazon.com.

00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:33.996 A:middle
And when you look at Safari's
performance on a benchmark

00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:38.196 A:middle
like that, JSBench, the
results are really incredible.

00:31:39.516 --> 00:31:45.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:49.376 A:middle
Safari is also awesome when
it comes now to memory usage,

00:31:49.706 --> 00:31:51.856 A:middle
using way less memory
than the other browsers

00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:54.456 A:middle
which means more memory for
you to browse with more tabs

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:55.766 A:middle
and do more on your system.

00:31:56.266 --> 00:31:59.536 A:middle
And when it comes to energy
use, it's not even closed.

00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:03.026 A:middle
Safari uses way less
energy than Chrome.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:05.986 A:middle
And when you compare to
Firefox, it's just kind of sad.

00:32:07.376 --> 00:32:08.296 A:middle
So that's Safari.

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.546 A:middle
I'd love to give
you a demo of some

00:32:10.546 --> 00:32:12.756 A:middle
of our advanced technologies
in Safari right now.

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:21.966 A:middle
So, let's start with
responsiveness

00:32:21.966 --> 00:32:24.106 A:middle
and I'm going to
go now into mail.

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:28.466 A:middle
And so here, we have a mailbox
with about 100,000 messages

00:32:28.466 --> 00:32:33.306 A:middle
in your inbox and I just want
to show you how you scroll now

00:32:33.306 --> 00:32:34.566 A:middle
with that accelerated scrolling.

00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:37.846 A:middle
Perfectly smooth,
incredibly fast,

00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.936 A:middle
almost 60 frames a
second whenever you do it,

00:32:40.936 --> 00:32:41.986 A:middle
it's just epic.

00:32:41.986 --> 00:32:44.976 A:middle
And when you look
here at scrolling

00:32:44.976 --> 00:32:47.416 A:middle
through a conversation,
this is a conversation

00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:48.936 A:middle
with 26 messages in it.

00:32:49.606 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
Again, just super glassy
smooth, super fast,

00:32:54.386 --> 00:32:55.696 A:middle
it's really, really nice.

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:57.726 A:middle
Let's take a look
at that in Safari.

00:32:58.096 --> 00:33:00.466 A:middle
In Safari, we've
improved scrolling

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.506 --> 00:33:04.086 A:middle
for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:08.946 A:middle
for retina displays so now, it's
just super fast, super smooth.

00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:10.956 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at power.

00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:13.286 A:middle
Yeah, there's a fan of
smooth scrolling right there

00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:13.736 A:middle
in the front.

00:33:16.486 --> 00:33:18.296 A:middle
I'm a fan of smooth
scrolling as well.

00:33:18.616 --> 00:33:21.046 A:middle
So let's take a look at power
use, so you have a power meter

00:33:21.046 --> 00:33:23.196 A:middle
up here that's showing
CPU activity in Safari

00:33:23.196 --> 00:33:25.306 A:middle
and you notice right
now, it's quite low

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:26.726 A:middle
because we're not
doing anything.

00:33:26.936 --> 00:33:30.356 A:middle
But let's go into a website
that's going to use a lot

00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:32.626 A:middle
of power and you notice
the power meter shoot right

00:33:32.626 --> 00:33:35.646 A:middle
up because we're doing a lot of
animation here using all the CPU

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.286 A:middle
and that's OK, that's
what the CPUs for,

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:38.846 A:middle
it's doing something
cool for me right here.

00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:41.286 A:middle
But very often, you'll have
something like this happening

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:43.996 A:middle
in an add off in the corner,
you've covered this window up

00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:46.206 A:middle
and yet, it's still
draining your battery life,

00:33:46.386 --> 00:33:47.366 A:middle
you don't even realized it.

00:33:47.886 --> 00:33:51.586 A:middle
Well now, with this technology
we call AppNap, we keep track

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.116 A:middle
of what's going on and what
things you actually to see

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:55.726 A:middle
to decide where to direct power.

00:33:56.186 --> 00:33:59.886 A:middle
So watch what happens when I
bring up this iTunes window

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:02.326 A:middle
over the Safari window,
the power drops right down

00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:10.766 A:middle
and that's extending
your battery life.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:16.396 A:middle
But of course, that
thing is still running,

00:34:16.396 --> 00:34:19.726 A:middle
it's still available to me so if
I pull it aside, there it goes,

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.386 A:middle
you can see everything
happening right now.

00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:25.196 A:middle
The power goes up, cover back
up, power goes right back down,

00:34:25.326 --> 00:34:30.795 A:middle
it's really going to
help your battery life.

00:34:31.326 --> 00:34:35.346 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at
the new Safari top sites.

00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:37.856 A:middle
Really clean, really nice.

00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:39.246 A:middle
We'll bring out the new sidebar.

00:34:39.386 --> 00:34:40.946 A:middle
You see I have all
my bookmarks here.

00:34:41.306 --> 00:34:43.456 A:middle
I have my bookmark
folders as well.

00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:46.366 A:middle
If I want to bring a side
over for my bookmarks

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:48.576 A:middle
in the top sites, I can
just drag it out like this.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:49.525 A:middle
It's really nice.

00:34:49.666 --> 00:34:52.186 A:middle
I can open it up, animates in.

00:34:52.536 --> 00:34:57.796 A:middle
From the side bar, we also have
access to our shared links.

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:01.216 A:middle
You see sites that I'm following
here on Twitter and LinkedIn

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:01.476 --> 00:35:03.996 A:middle
and click on a site-- a
link that's been shared.

00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:07.686 A:middle
It loads it up, I can
even retweet it right here

00:35:07.686 --> 00:35:08.646 A:middle
if I-- if I wish.

00:35:08.826 --> 00:35:10.626 A:middle
And we now have one-click
bookmarking

00:35:10.626 --> 00:35:12.446 A:middle
so I'll just click this plus
and it's going to hop right

00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:14.276 A:middle
in to my Reading
List right there.

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:16.186 A:middle
Let's go take a look
at my Reading List.

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:19.826 A:middle
See all the articles I've
added here to my Reading List?

00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
I want you to watch how
scrolling works because now,

00:35:23.156 --> 00:35:25.166 A:middle
when I scroll and I'm
reading through one article,

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.746 A:middle
I read this, this is great,
I'm really enjoying it.

00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:30.036 A:middle
Get to the bottom,
there's the next article.

00:35:30.036 --> 00:35:32.926 A:middle
I can just scroll right
through to the next article just

00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:33.376 A:middle
like that.

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:40.106 A:middle
Awesome. We also have a
beautiful new look for Reader.

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:43.476 A:middle
Here is Reader and I'm
going to bring up my--

00:35:43.546 --> 00:35:46.526 A:middle
I can actually close
up my sidebar here.

00:35:47.056 --> 00:35:49.896 A:middle
And now, as I scroll reading
and I just want to read

00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:52.466 A:middle
from one article to the
next, it's just like that.

00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:57.166 A:middle
Super clean and super nice and
that's Safari in Mavericks.

00:35:57.166 --> 00:35:57.966 A:middle

So, we have some
more improvements

00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:08.336 A:middle
that I think are going to really
help you with your browsing

00:36:08.336 --> 00:36:11.586 A:middle
and one of them is
iCloud Keychain, yeah.

00:36:14.516 --> 00:36:17.246 A:middle
You know, to really
be secure these days,

00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:20.896 A:middle
you want to have a different
complex password for every site

00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:23.396 A:middle
where you have a log in
but this inevitably brings

00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:25.716 A:middle
up the question,
"what's my password?"

00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:28.516 A:middle
and these solutions
are not recommended.

00:36:29.526 --> 00:36:30.676 A:middle
There is a better way.

00:36:30.946 --> 00:36:34.356 A:middle
With iCloud Keychain, we can
remember your website logins,

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.706 A:middle
your credit card numbers,
even your Wi-Fi networks

00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:44.126 A:middle
and they're always encrypted,
synced across all of your system

00:36:44.126 --> 00:36:45.466 A:middle
so they are always
available to you.

00:36:45.886 --> 00:36:48.106 A:middle
Now, when you go to
sign up for a website,

00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:51.706 A:middle
you can of course enter your own
password and we'll remember it

00:36:51.706 --> 00:36:56.136 A:middle
but as well, Safari can auto
suggest a password for you.

00:36:56.946 --> 00:36:59.856 A:middle
You don't have to remember that
but it'll enter it in for you

00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
and then sync it across
all of your systems

00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.616 A:middle
and login for you from then on.

iCloud Keychain is great
for your shopping as well.

00:37:14.456 --> 00:37:18.916 A:middle
When you come to a credit card
field, you can suggest any

00:37:18.916 --> 00:37:21.626 A:middle
of your remembered
credit cards, select one

00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:24.476 A:middle
and it'll just enter it in
for you just like that along

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:25.526 A:middle
with your expiration date.

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:27.766 A:middle
But you have to remember
your own security code,

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:29.446 A:middle
that's what makes
it secure after all

00:37:30.636 --> 00:37:31.976 A:middle
and that's iCloud Keychain.

Next, some improvements
to Notifications.

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:45.636 A:middle
So now, with Notifications on
the Mac, if you're a Californian

00:37:45.636 --> 00:37:48.186 A:middle
like me, you'll often get
this kind of notification,

00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:50.816 A:middle
"Hey want to go surf
these 30 foot waves?"

00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:53.896 A:middle
And you response, surely is
to mouse over the notification

00:37:53.896 --> 00:37:56.736 A:middle
and immediately right there,
reply, "Yeah sure I'm going

00:37:56.736 --> 00:37:57.796 A:middle
to surf that 30 foot wave."

00:37:58.016 --> 00:38:01.456 A:middle
You can reply right inside the
Notification and you can do this

for things like email

00:38:02.626 --> 00:38:04.776 A:middle
and quickly delete email
you might not want to deal

00:38:04.776 --> 00:38:06.576 A:middle
with without even
having to go to Mail.

00:38:07.376 --> 00:38:09.936 A:middle
If you get a FaceTime call,
you can response saying,

00:38:09.936 --> 00:38:11.866 A:middle
"Hey I'm going to call
you later," or remind

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:13.336 A:middle
without having to
pick up the call.

00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:14.496 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:17.616 A:middle
We also handle a new
kind of notification.

00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:21.676 A:middle
So if you have an app today
that sends push notifications

00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:24.686 A:middle

maybe Breaking News, news

when you wake it up, it

on your Calendar if you wish

00:39:39.526 --> 00:39:42.306 A:middle
and we have a great new
inspector that's even aware

00:39:42.576 --> 00:39:46.116 A:middle
of things like location,
travel time and weather.

00:39:46.846 --> 00:39:48.556 A:middle

The Maps team has been making
great improvements to the data

00:40:03.596 --> 00:40:05.656 A:middle
and Maps and Mac users
are going to benefit

00:40:05.656 --> 00:40:07.676 A:middle
because we have this
fantastic new Maps app.

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:11.466 A:middle
Of course, with your street

You can get turn by turn

00:40:23.506 --> 00:40:26.246 A:middle
when I have a route that
I've set up on my Mac

00:40:26.596 --> 00:40:30.096 A:middle
and now it's time to go, you
can just click right up here

00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:32.436 A:middle
and send it right to my iPhone

00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:34.456 A:middle
where it will appear
right on my lock screen.

00:40:46.006 --> 00:40:48.186 A:middle
We're also providing
a developer SDK

00:40:48.186 --> 00:40:50.176 A:middle
so you can add mapping
functionality

00:40:50.176 --> 00:40:51.526 A:middle
to your apps as well.

00:40:51.526 --> 00:40:51.906 A:middle

on your Mac as well.

00:41:19.486 --> 00:41:21.486 A:middle
It's a great environment
for reading.

00:41:21.676 --> 00:41:23.816 A:middle
It's also a great
environment for taking notes

00:41:24.326 --> 00:41:28.546 A:middle
and it supports iBooks

00:41:28.546 --> 00:41:31.216 A:middle

So here we are in
Paris, you can just zoom

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:48.776 A:middle
in a place in Paris there.

and fluid bringing in
points of location.

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:57.466 A:middle
I can pan around the map
to find a nice location,

00:41:58.146 --> 00:42:00.826 A:middle
maybe the Eiffel

Let's go in to look
at that flyover data.

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:12.066 A:middle
As we can see the Eiffel Tower,
we can go in to tilt it over,

00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:14.886 A:middle
that's the Eiffel
Tower right there.

00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:19.966 A:middle
The flyover data is just
beautiful and of course,

00:42:20.076 --> 00:42:25.196 A:middle
I can even rotate around Paris.

00:42:25.196 --> 00:42:28.916 A:middle
Look, you can even see through
the Eiffel Tower as it rotates

00:42:28.916 --> 00:42:30.076 A:middle
into the area of the city below.

00:42:30.076 --> 00:42:32.926 A:middle
The data is just gorgeous,
the new flyover data.

00:42:33.196 --> 00:42:35.396 A:middle
It's really amazing on
your big Mac display.

00:42:36.046 --> 00:42:38.646 A:middle
Of course, we support great
search for points of interest

00:42:38.646 --> 00:42:40.136 A:middle
so if I want to go
to lunch, maybe at --

00:42:40.136 --> 00:42:41.476 A:middle
I'm told this is Guy Savoy.

00:42:42.456 --> 00:42:46.746 A:middle
We'll go to Guy Savoy, they
have this great info cards

00:42:47.676 --> 00:42:50.096 A:middle
with reviews, photos.

00:42:51.036 --> 00:42:54.166 A:middle
I can add a site to my
Bookmarks just like this

00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:57.756 A:middle
and it's now synced
across all my devices

00:42:57.756 --> 00:43:00.236 A:middle

I can, of course,
get directions.

It has continuous scrolling and
what's really amazing is even

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:34.036 A:middle
without the stitching,

It doesn't fall off
without the stitching.

I don't know how we did it.

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:42.756 A:middle
It's engineering.

00:43:43.896 --> 00:43:47.736 A:middle
It's really great for
creating events so if I go

00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:49.456 A:middle
and create an event like
this, let's say I'm going

00:43:49.456 --> 00:43:53.216 A:middle
to have lunch and I'm going to
type in what I want for lunch,

I'm going to say I want pizza.

for that location so I know

if I need to bring a jacket.

00:44:11.096 --> 00:44:13.876 A:middle
to tell me what the
travel time is expected

00:44:13.876 --> 00:44:16.786 A:middle
from my last location
so I can decide

00:44:16.786 --> 00:44:17.756 A:middle
if I want to drive or walk.

I'm going to say I want to walk

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.836 A:middle

time right to my Calendar

schedule anything there.

00:48:01.726 --> 00:48:03.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, good morning everyone.

00:48:03.056 --> 00:48:08.796 A:middle
I'd like to talk to you
about the MacBook Air.

00:48:09.516 --> 00:48:12.736 A:middle
The MacBook Air answer
the question in this age

00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:15.846 A:middle
of the iPad, what is the
future of the notebook?

00:48:16.416 --> 00:48:19.096 A:middle
The MacBook Air really
gave us a direction

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.816 A:middle
of where the notebook can go,

00:48:20.816 --> 00:48:23.856 A:middle
and it's really become
everyone's ultimate

00:48:24.246 --> 00:48:26.046 A:middle
everyday notebook.

00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:28.776 A:middle
And that's why we're really
pleased to tell you today

00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:32.656 A:middle
that we've updated an entirely
new line of MacBook Air.

00:48:32.656 --> 00:48:36.296 A:middle
And these new MacBook Airs
deliver the most important

00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:37.736 A:middle
feature we always want

00:48:38.076 --> 00:48:42.696 A:middle
in a portable device,
all day battery life.

00:48:42.696 --> 00:48:42.866 A:middle
Yes.

00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:47.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:49.686 A:middle
And the MacBook Air is based

00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:52.926 A:middle
on a new 4th Generation
Intel Core Processor,

00:48:53.286 --> 00:48:55.486 A:middle
otherwise known as Haswell ULT.

00:48:55.486 --> 00:48:59.366 A:middle
And if you don't know Haswell
ULT, it's a great processor

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:01.506 A:middle
for incredible power savings.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:01.736 --> 00:49:03.996 A:middle
There's more energy-efficient
CPUs,

00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:06.316 A:middle
there's twice the
graphics execution units

00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:08.796 A:middle
so we can run them actually
to slower clock speed

00:49:08.796 --> 00:49:12.466 A:middle
to save energy and still
deliver the 40 percent faster

00:49:12.466 --> 00:49:13.506 A:middle
graphics performance.

00:49:14.046 --> 00:49:15.776 A:middle
And the Apple engineers
have worked together

00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:19.436 A:middle
with the Intel engineers on
some great low power state

00:49:19.436 --> 00:49:21.636 A:middle
so we can do things
like wake in one second

00:49:21.886 --> 00:49:24.406 A:middle
or standby for up to 30 days.

00:49:24.946 --> 00:49:26.896 A:middle
But the biggest benefit
is battery life

00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:29.666 A:middle
so here is the current
generation MacBook Air,

00:49:29.956 --> 00:49:31.536 A:middle
11 inch and 13 inch.

00:49:31.876 --> 00:49:35.266 A:middle
The 11 inch is now going to go
from 5 hours of battery life

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:43.866 A:middle
up to an incredible 9
hours of battery life.

00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:46.436 A:middle
And if you like that,
the 13 inch goes from 7

00:49:46.436 --> 00:49:51.306 A:middle
to 12 hours of battery life.

00:49:51.306 --> 00:49:54.266 A:middle
Yes, true, all day
battery life and it helps

00:49:54.266 --> 00:49:55.676 A:middle
across your entire system.

00:49:56.016 --> 00:49:58.716 A:middle
For example, if you like
watching movies from iTunes,

00:49:58.716 --> 00:50:01.976 A:middle
up to 10 hours, you can watch
almost the entire Trilogy

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:01.976 --> 00:50:03.966 A:middle
of Lord of the Rings,
it's amazing.

00:50:04.116 --> 00:50:07.376 A:middle
And of course, MacBook Air
is based entirely on Flash.

00:50:07.636 --> 00:50:10.286 A:middle
Flash is faster, up
to 45 percent faster

00:50:10.286 --> 00:50:13.466 A:middle
than the previous version
and Wi-Fi is faster too,

00:50:13.466 --> 00:50:16.126 A:middle
now 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking.

00:50:18.496 --> 00:50:21.536 A:middle
Now, ac gets you up to
three times the performance

00:50:21.536 --> 00:50:24.216 A:middle
of 802.11n at the same distance.

00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:27.186 A:middle
But the way to get that of
course is you want your MacBook

00:50:27.186 --> 00:50:31.816 A:middle
Air to talk to a Wi-Fi base
station that supports 802.11ac.

00:50:32.036 --> 00:50:33.366 A:middle
So, we're really happy to along

00:50:33.366 --> 00:50:37.156 A:middle
with MacBook Air announce some
new AirPort Base Stations,

00:50:37.486 --> 00:50:41.636 A:middle
entirely new designs, they're
actually a very small base,

00:50:41.636 --> 00:50:44.726 A:middle
just 4 inches square but
extruded 6 and a half inches

00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:46.906 A:middle
to get wider range
from those antennas.

00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:50.556 A:middle
So there's a new AirPort
Extreme that does 802.11ac.

00:50:50.676 --> 00:50:52.696 A:middle
There's also room in
there for a hard drive

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:55.076 A:middle
so you have a new AirPort
Time Capsule as well

00:50:55.076 --> 00:50:57.116 A:middle
and these are great
base stations.

00:50:57.426 --> 00:50:58.746 A:middle
They're incredibly powerful,

00:50:58.746 --> 00:51:00.266 A:middle
they have a lot of
cool features.

I'll just point out one,

00:51:01.426 --> 00:51:03.576 A:middle
beamforming, it even
sounds cool.

00:51:03.826 --> 00:51:08.456 A:middle
Beamforming can send more energy
directly to an 802.11ac device

00:51:08.716 --> 00:51:10.536 A:middle
to enhance the throughput
and performance.

00:51:10.976 --> 00:51:12.406 A:middle
So, these are great
base stations.

00:51:13.516 --> 00:51:16.566 A:middle
The MacBook Air comes in
11 inch and 13 inches sizes

00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:19.016 A:middle
and the value is even
greater than before.

00:51:19.016 --> 00:51:20.816 A:middle
The 11 inch starts at 999

00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:23.856 A:middle
with 128 gigabytes
that's twice the storage

00:51:24.046 --> 00:51:25.586 A:middle
at the same price as before.

00:51:25.586 --> 00:51:29.676 A:middle
And the 13 inch with
128 gigs starts at 1099,

00:51:29.676 --> 00:51:32.156 A:middle
that's 100 dollars less
expensive than before.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:35.316 A:middle

00:52:10.466 --> 00:52:15.576 A:middle
They're faster graphics, longer
battery life, better value,

00:52:15.656 --> 00:52:18.376 A:middle
faster Wi-Fi, incredible

of the same old desktop
idea that everyone has had.

00:53:11.176 --> 00:53:12.456 A:middle
Like with MacBook Air,

00:53:12.766 --> 00:53:15.526 A:middle
our engineering team has spent
quite a bit of time thinking

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:19.856 A:middle
about the technology available
today and what could be possible

00:53:19.856 --> 00:53:21.936 A:middle
for the future of a Pro desktop.

00:53:21.936 --> 00:53:24.526 A:middle
What would be a new
formed factor, new design,

00:53:24.526 --> 00:53:27.666 A:middle
new capabilities for
another 10 years?

00:53:28.856 --> 00:53:30.186 A:middle
And the engineering
team has come

00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:34.746 A:middle
up with something truly
revolutionary, truly radical

00:53:35.666 --> 00:53:37.316 A:middle

We'll, I'm going to go
a little over the top

00:53:40.386 --> 00:53:43.996 A:middle
and give it a grand introduction

00:53:44.446 --> 00:53:47.596 A:middle
that is unlike any introduction

of this Machine,
you can be this guy.

00:58:12.166 --> 00:58:15.136 A:middle
It is a Mac unlike
any we've ever made.

00:58:15.136 --> 00:58:18.886 A:middle
It delivers so much more
performance, capabilities

00:58:18.886 --> 00:58:20.896 A:middle
and expansion than
anything we've made

00:58:21.506 --> 00:58:23.476 A:middle
and here it is alongside
the previous generation.

[ Applause ]

00:58:29.676 --> 00:58:31.126 A:middle
The team has packed all

00:58:31.126 --> 00:58:35.086 A:middle
of its capability inside
one eighth the volume

00:58:35.086 --> 00:58:36.156 A:middle
of the previous generation.

00:58:36.626 --> 00:58:37.876 A:middle
The one thing everyone loved

00:58:37.876 --> 00:58:40.336 A:middle
about the old generation Mac
Pro is those handles on the top

00:58:40.336 --> 00:58:43.576 A:middle
so you can move it around
to get access to the I/O.

00:58:43.806 --> 00:58:47.916 A:middle
Well, the entire top of the new
generation Mac Pro is a handle.

00:58:48.116 --> 00:58:50.616 A:middle
Just put your hand in it,
you can spin it around,

00:58:51.056 --> 00:58:52.546 A:middle
get access to the I/O.

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:55.316 A:middle
It's all organized
beautifully on the back for you.

00:58:55.646 --> 00:59:01.106 A:middle
There is audio, four USB 3,
six FireWire 2 being driven

by three FireWire 2

00:59:04.326 --> 00:59:05.976 A:middle
who use this stuff know
what I'm talking about.

00:59:06.456 --> 00:59:10.836 A:middle
It's gigabit Ethernet, HDMI
out and it has a motion sensor

00:59:10.836 --> 00:59:12.966 A:middle
so when you turn
it, it even lights

00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.386 A:middle
up to show you where the I/O is.

00:59:21.566 --> 00:59:24.146 A:middle
It is a stunning product.

00:59:24.246 --> 00:59:28.496 A:middle
This is without doubt the
future of the Pro desktop.

00:59:29.396 --> 00:59:31.466 A:middle
It is coming later this year.

00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:33.106 A:middle
I did say this is a sneak peek.

00:59:33.666 --> 00:59:36.456 A:middle
It is designed by brilliant
engineers in California

00:59:36.456 --> 00:59:38.866 A:middle
and assembled here in the USA.

01:00:21.726 --> 01:00:24.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You're going to love
the Mac Pro, it's killer.

01:00:25.346 --> 01:00:27.976 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
talk about iCloud.

01:00:28.556 --> 01:00:34.416 A:middle
We've now passed 300 million
iCloud accounts making iCloud

01:00:34.416 --> 01:00:37.386 A:middle
the fastest growing
Cloud service ever.

01:00:38.646 --> 01:00:43.896 A:middle
Now, by comparison, it
took Facebook five years

01:00:43.896 --> 01:00:45.136 A:middle
to reach this many accounts.

01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:50.036 A:middle
One of the most popular features
of iCloud is iTunes in the Cloud

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:52.946 A:middle
which makes all of your
purchase content available

01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:54.126 A:middle
on all of your devices.

01:00:54.796 --> 01:00:58.676 A:middle
We now have 300 million users
of this feature and they read

01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:02.946 A:middle
out of their content
35 billion times.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:04.026 --> 01:01:08.216 A:middle
Now, the back-end infrastructure
of iCloud allows us

01:01:08.216 --> 01:01:11.456 A:middle
to provide Cloud services
across many of our products

01:01:12.326 --> 01:01:15.396 A:middle
like Game Center, our
social gaming network now

01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:18.136 A:middle
with over 240 million users.

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.176 A:middle
Sixty of the top 100 games

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:24.496 A:middle
on the App Store integrate
Game Center support right

01:01:24.496 --> 01:01:25.286 A:middle
in their game.

01:01:26.556 --> 01:01:30.776 A:middle
iCloud is also --
has incredible scale

01:01:31.586 --> 01:01:35.106 A:middle
like sending 800
billion iMessages,

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:40.796 A:middle
or a mind-boggling 7.4
trillion push notifications.

01:01:44.516 --> 01:01:48.776 A:middle
iCloud allows us to seamlessly
integrate Cloud services

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:50.476 A:middle
into so many of our products

01:01:50.556 --> 01:01:54.786 A:middle
across Apple in both
OS X and iOS.

01:01:56.316 --> 01:02:01.636 A:middle
Today, we want to share with
you how we're deeply integrating

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

iCloud into the next
version of iWork.

01:02:05.776 --> 01:02:08.596 A:middle
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Roger Rosner

01:02:08.596 --> 01:02:09.596 A:middle
up to the stage.

01:02:10.306 --> 01:02:10.646 A:middle

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:20.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Hi, let me tell
you a little bit about iWork.

01:02:21.216 --> 01:02:23.426 A:middle
iWork is pages, numbers,
and keynote.

01:02:23.896 --> 01:02:26.766 A:middle
And we think it's the best way
to create beautiful documents,

01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.416 A:middle
spreadsheets and presentations.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.716 A:middle
Of course, iWork was born on
the Mac and it has full support

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:36.166 A:middle
for the awesome feature set
of Mac OS X and Mac hardware.

01:02:37.036 --> 01:02:40.416 A:middle
We also have amazingly powerful
and fully multi-touch versions

01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:43.766 A:middle
of these apps on the
iPad and on the iPhone.

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:46.996 A:middle
We think our multi-touch
apps are the most powerful

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.666 A:middle
productivity apps ever
created for a mobile device.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:53.386 A:middle
And later this year, we're going
to have awesome new releases

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.326 A:middle
of both our Mac and
our iOS suites.

01:02:57.236 --> 01:03:00.996 A:middle
But today, I want to
introduce the newest member

01:03:00.996 --> 01:03:06.006 A:middle
of the iWork family,
introducing iWork for iCloud.

01:03:07.086 --> 01:03:10.726 A:middle
iWork for iCloud lets you
create beautiful documents right

01:03:10.726 --> 01:03:13.836 A:middle
in a browser on a
Mac or on a PC.

01:03:13.936 --> 01:03:16.476 A:middle
And rather than talk about it,

01:03:16.606 --> 01:03:17.946 A:middle
let's just jump right
into a demo.

01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:28.746 A:middle
All right, I'm going to fire
up Safari on my Mac here

01:03:29.496 --> 01:03:32.216 A:middle
and go straight to
my iCloud homepage

01:03:32.216 --> 01:03:36.166 A:middle
where you see three new app
icons, and I click on Pages.

01:03:36.786 --> 01:03:41.326 A:middle
And here is all the documents
I've been working on, on my Mac

01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:43.236 A:middle
or my iPad and saved in iCloud.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:46.596 A:middle
I can create a new document by
clicking Plus and I have a bunch

01:03:46.596 --> 01:03:48.306 A:middle
of beautiful Apple-designed
templates.

01:03:48.306 --> 01:03:51.896 A:middle
But let's just open a
document we were working on.

01:03:55.846 --> 01:03:58.866 A:middle
And as you can see, it's a
beautiful Pages document,

great fonts, graphics,
images, page layouts.

01:04:04.626 --> 01:04:08.886 A:middle
This is all happening in
a web browser of course.

01:04:10.006 --> 01:04:11.586 A:middle
So I can just click
here and type.

01:04:12.346 --> 01:04:17.296 A:middle
And over here, I have all
the formatting controls

01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:19.336 A:middle
in our new context-sensitive
format panel.

01:04:19.336 --> 01:04:23.926 A:middle
So I'll just select some
text, go up to my Styles,

01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:29.666 A:middle
choose a text style, select
some more text, choose another.

01:04:30.426 --> 01:04:33.036 A:middle
I can click on some images.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.296 A:middle
And you see, my controls
now show me Image Controls.

01:04:36.296 --> 01:04:39.836 A:middle
I can click on a bunch of
styles, choose that one.

01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:43.656 A:middle
Now, of course, Pages has always
been great at handling graphics.

01:04:43.786 --> 01:04:45.426 A:middle
So, how do I add graphics?

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:48.346 A:middle
Well, I drag one
in from my desktop,

01:04:49.336 --> 01:04:52.466 A:middle
drop it in there

Now, we know we live
in a world full

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:05.526 A:middle
of Microsoft Office documents,
so how do we work with Office?

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:09.066 A:middle
Well I have a Word document
here, and I'm just going to drag

01:05:09.066 --> 01:05:10.776 A:middle
that in from my desktop and drop

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:12.696 A:middle
that in the Pages
for iCloud window.

01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:14.246 A:middle

in it, great charts,
great tables and graphics.

01:05:50.056 --> 01:05:51.596 A:middle
Here on the last
sheet, we have a table

Let's go in there and make
that mask a little bit tighter

01:08:21.746 --> 01:08:23.086 A:middle

That is iWork for iCloud.

Now, we know, in a lot of cases,

01:08:42.176 --> 01:08:43.876 A:middle

experiences are made

01:08:43.876 --> 01:08:45.156 A:middle
with native app technologies.

01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:47.345 A:middle
But I think you can
see with iWork

01:08:47.345 --> 01:08:49.636 A:middle
for iCloud you can do some
pretty great stuff on the web.

and we're proud of it,

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:16.866 A:middle
people are using our

This recent study from Experian
showed that iPhone users use

01:10:24.936 --> 01:10:30.516 A:middle
of iPhone 50 percent more than
Android users use their phone.

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:34.486 A:middle
Now this is incredible
but may be not surprising.

01:10:34.486 --> 01:10:43.026 A:middle
And if you look at mobile web
share, it's not even close.

01:10:43.556 --> 01:10:47.716 A:middle
iOS is two and a
half times Android.

And if you look at iPads
compared to all other tablets,

01:10:53.076 --> 01:10:54.456 A:middle
it's not even comparable.

01:10:55.326 --> 01:10:57.966 A:middle

As an example, just like
iOS customers buy more

01:11:06.556 --> 01:11:11.646 A:middle
of your incredible apps,
they evidently also buy a lot

01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:14.426 A:middle
of everything else according
to a recent IBM survey.

01:11:15.536 --> 01:11:19.456 A:middle
Both iPhone and iPad
customers were responsible

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:22.696 A:middle
for materially more
mobile shopping traffic

doesn't surprise you

most important to us.

literally off the charts.

that they're very satisfied
and really look at the detail

01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:23.966 A:middle
which I'm sometimes known to
do, you would see that iOS blows

20 points better

that we provide amazing

Now, that's in stark contrast
to the world of Android.

01:13:10.106 --> 01:13:14.646 A:middle
And by the way, this is the
most ideal state of Android.

01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:17.686 A:middle
It only includes us version

01:13:19.476 --> 01:13:21.986 A:middle
So it doesn't things
like Kindles and Nooks.

But even then, it's
a pretty bleak story.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:31.826 A:middle

system that was released
in 2010.

And if you look at the customers
of each operating system

01:20:19.721 --> 01:20:21.721 A:middle
[Laughter]

01:20:21.856 --> 01:20:22.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This-- thank you.

01:20:22.966 --> 01:20:28.256 A:middle
This major effort, this
major effort is only possible

01:20:29.696 --> 01:20:33.276 A:middle
because of the incredible
collaboration between Johnny

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:36.776 A:middle
and his amazing design
team and Craig

01:20:36.776 --> 01:20:39.366 A:middle
and his incredible
engineering team.

01:20:40.676 --> 01:20:45.056 A:middle
Without further ado, I'd like
to invite Craig, back up,

01:20:45.056 --> 01:20:50.256 A:middle
to take you through iOS
7, the biggest change

01:20:50.256 --> 01:20:52.806 A:middle
to iOS since the iPhone.

01:20:53.086 --> 01:20:53.376 A:middle
Craig.

01:21:04.516 --> 01:21:08.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, on behalf of all of
the engineers and designers

01:21:08.606 --> 01:21:12.306 A:middle
who worked so hard to
make today a reality,

01:21:12.686 --> 01:21:16.406 A:middle
I'm absolutely thrilled at this
opportunity to show you iOS 7.

01:21:16.926 --> 01:21:17.746 A:middle
Let's take a look.

01:21:19.806 --> 01:21:20.786 A:middle
It's unbelievable.

01:21:21.216 --> 01:21:22.576 A:middle
It's just gorgeous.

01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:27.916 A:middle
From the typography on this
lock screen to the vitality

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:31.916 A:middle
of the background of an
animation, to the home screen

01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:37.016 A:middle
with these icons, it looks so
great, it just look fantastic.

01:21:37.016 --> 01:21:41.906 A:middle
And, you know, a lot of us have
our own wallpaper, you know,

01:21:41.906 --> 01:21:43.396 A:middle
I mean like pictures
of our family there.

01:21:43.396 --> 01:21:46.886 A:middle
And now that liveliness
actually carries

01:21:46.946 --> 01:21:50.306 A:middle
through to the home screen,
because as you move the device

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:52.986 A:middle
on your hand it actually
tracks your motion.

01:21:54.406 --> 01:21:57.066 A:middle
And as parallax that-- but you
can see the behind the icons.

01:21:57.326 --> 01:21:59.776 A:middle
It's really incredible
and it carries

01:21:59.776 --> 01:22:02.006 A:middle
over across the system,
this liveliness.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:22:02.006 --> 01:22:04.366 A:middle
I mean just take a look
at something like weather,

01:22:05.576 --> 01:22:08.246 A:middle
with emotion conveys this
information and where the edge

01:22:08.246 --> 01:22:11.156 A:middle
to edge design just takes
advantage of every pixel

01:22:11.856 --> 01:22:12.976 A:middle
on that retina display.

01:22:13.576 --> 01:22:14.406 A:middle
It's so nice.

01:22:15.816 --> 01:22:19.176 A:middle
It's great for apps you use
everyday, like messages,

01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:25.876 A:middle
your calendar, your
email is gorgeous.

01:22:27.106 --> 01:22:29.326 A:middle
Your friends never
looked more attractive.

01:22:32.986 --> 01:22:35.236 A:middle
And Game Center, we
just completely ran

01:22:35.236 --> 01:22:36.156 A:middle
out of green felt.

01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:44.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:22:45.046 --> 01:22:45.996 A:middle
And wood as well.

01:22:45.996 --> 01:22:47.666 A:middle
This has got to be good
for the environment.

01:22:49.156 --> 01:22:50.466 A:middle
The clocks look great.

01:22:50.926 --> 01:22:53.906 A:middle
And even apps like
Stocks and Compass,

01:22:53.906 --> 01:22:56.906 A:middle
but they just have this look of
precision, a sense of purpose.

01:22:57.396 --> 01:23:00.676 A:middle
The best way to appreciate
iOS 7 is to see it live.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:23:01.096 --> 01:23:02.746 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a demo right now.

01:23:03.516 --> 01:23:08.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:23:09.146 --> 01:23:12.666 A:middle
So let's take our first
live look at iOS 7.

01:23:12.846 --> 01:23:13.476 A:middle
Here it is.

01:23:13.476 --> 01:23:16.316 A:middle
You can see how the
device actually response

01:23:16.316 --> 01:23:17.586 A:middle
to the motion in my hand.

01:23:18.646 --> 01:23:20.696 A:middle
Just slide out the lock screen.

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:21.316 A:middle
You see how it slides in.

01:23:21.316 --> 01:23:22.336 A:middle
And I want you now to look away

01:23:22.336 --> 01:23:24.586 A:middle
for a moment while I
type in my password.

01:23:24.626 --> 01:23:25.886 A:middle
OK, you can look again.

01:23:26.806 --> 01:23:28.176 A:middle
OK, don't tell anyone
about that.

01:23:28.876 --> 01:23:29.056 A:middle
All right.

01:23:29.156 --> 01:23:33.286 A:middle
So here we are on the
gorgeous new home screen.

01:23:33.286 --> 01:23:34.196 A:middle
Let's go into Weather.

01:23:35.476 --> 01:23:37.546 A:middle
You see in Weather, it's
a little cloudy today.

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:41.126 A:middle
I can actually tap here, the
degrees get more information

01:23:41.126 --> 01:23:45.646 A:middle
like humidity and rain,
swipe through some locations,

01:23:47.086 --> 01:23:50.866 A:middle
clear in Sydney, kind
of hot in Phoenix.

01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:56.406 A:middle
Here in a big thunder mountain,
it's looking little rough.

01:23:56.966 --> 01:23:58.886 A:middle
We've got some thunder brewing.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:24:00.116 --> 01:24:06.816 A:middle
Oh, yeah. [applause] Some heavy
snow here on the North Pole

01:24:08.066 --> 01:24:11.926 A:middle
and tropical storm here
in Gilligan's Island,

01:24:11.926 --> 01:24:13.816 A:middle
I hope they got off that island.

01:24:14.206 --> 01:24:18.116 A:middle
So, and it's no functional
than ever.

01:24:18.116 --> 01:24:22.336 A:middle
If you pinch, you get
this gorgeous overview

01:24:22.586 --> 01:24:23.416 A:middle
of all your cities.

01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:28.346 A:middle
Even with the time, so
it's a world clock as well.

01:24:29.176 --> 01:24:30.416 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the Calendar.

01:24:32.866 --> 01:24:36.406 A:middle
So clean, swipe from
days to day like this,

01:24:37.086 --> 01:24:39.736 A:middle
turn it into landscape,
see your whole week

01:24:39.736 --> 01:24:41.966 A:middle
at a glance, got
a big week ahead.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:47.176 A:middle
Zoom out. Scroll easily
through your months,

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:50.106 A:middle
we even go all the
way out to the year.

01:24:50.106 --> 01:24:52.016 A:middle
Let's take a look at Messages.

01:24:52.016 --> 01:24:56.696 A:middle
You know, so we scroll,
we have this great sort

01:24:56.696 --> 01:24:57.646 A:middle
of playful motion.

01:24:57.646 --> 01:25:01.626 A:middle
The bubbles, spring
up the keyboard,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:02.046 --> 01:25:03.906 A:middle
lets you slide contents
of the keyboard.

01:25:03.906 --> 01:25:06.636 A:middle
You see the layering in
transparency, it gives you

01:25:06.636 --> 01:25:07.846 A:middle
that sense of context.

01:25:08.666 --> 01:25:10.996 A:middle
There's this gesture now from
the left edge of the device,

01:25:10.996 --> 01:25:12.746 A:middle
it's great for using
the device at one hand.

01:25:12.746 --> 01:25:15.376 A:middle
If I want to just go back, I
can just swipe from the edge

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:19.826 A:middle
of the display, pull back
like that, move in and out.

01:25:20.956 --> 01:25:21.956 A:middle
So clean and natural.

01:25:21.956 --> 01:25:24.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at folders,

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:26.326 A:middle
and it go here into
my Games folder.

01:25:26.326 --> 01:25:29.106 A:middle
I can have multiple pages,

01:25:29.966 --> 01:25:35.926 A:middle
stored under these
items not folders.

01:25:35.926 --> 01:25:36.176 A:middle
It's awesome.

01:25:36.766 --> 01:25:38.316 A:middle
Take a look at Game Center.

01:25:39.026 --> 01:25:47.496 A:middle
Some of those good
looking friends.

01:25:47.496 --> 01:25:49.866 A:middle
Let's take a look at Mail.

01:25:50.606 --> 01:25:55.506 A:middle
And the type is just so clean
and you drill into a message.

01:25:55.686 --> 01:25:57.666 A:middle
Look at how you get
this full screen edge

01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:59.466 A:middle
to edge photos, it's
really great.

01:25:59.466 --> 01:26:00.886 A:middle
And that gesture from moving in

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:26:00.886 --> 01:26:02.136 A:middle
and out works here
too, of course.

01:26:02.586 --> 01:26:05.396 A:middle
Just move between
messages, just like this.

01:26:05.396 --> 01:26:06.126 A:middle
It's so great.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:09.016 A:middle
And if you just slide
across in any item,

01:26:09.046 --> 01:26:11.886 A:middle
you can get at the
Trash and More Options

01:26:12.196 --> 01:26:13.926 A:middle
as well right here in Mail.

01:26:14.996 --> 01:26:17.256 A:middle
Finally, let's take a look
at Notification Center.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:19.656 A:middle
Same as always, we can
just swipe out from the top

01:26:19.656 --> 01:26:21.726 A:middle
of the device, comes
down with a nice thud,

01:26:21.726 --> 01:26:24.486 A:middle
you can see all notifications,
just might miss once.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.296 A:middle
And we've just great
new Today view.

01:26:26.296 --> 01:26:29.666 A:middle
So you can see you friends'
birthdays current look

01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:35.366 A:middle
at the weather, your upcoming
invitations, your calendar,

01:26:35.596 --> 01:26:39.706 A:middle
your stocks, and even a
quickly look at tomorrow.

01:26:40.156 --> 01:26:41.216 A:middle
You know, it's really great

01:26:41.216 --> 01:26:45.136 A:middle
as for the first time ever
Notification Center is now

01:26:45.136 --> 01:26:47.586 A:middle
available from the
lock screen as well.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.316 A:middle
You don't even have
to unlock your device.

01:26:51.846 --> 01:26:55.626 A:middle
[applause] So that's
a quick look at iOS 7.

01:26:56.146 --> 01:27:01.026 A:middle
It's a comprehensive end-to-end
redesign of the user experience.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:01.846 --> 01:27:04.416 A:middle
Installing iOS 7
on your phone is

01:27:04.416 --> 01:27:06.176 A:middle
like getting an entirely
new phone,

01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:08.556 A:middle
but when you already
know how to use,

01:27:09.046 --> 01:27:12.826 A:middle
when it's so much more beautiful
and functional than ever before.

01:27:14.456 --> 01:27:16.966 A:middle
But iOS 7 is actually
more than that.

01:27:17.536 --> 01:27:20.266 A:middle
It's also a major
feature release as well.

01:27:20.266 --> 01:27:23.346 A:middle
I have 10 features I want
to talk to you about today,

01:27:23.766 --> 01:27:26.226 A:middle
starting with Control Center.

01:27:27.646 --> 01:27:29.036 A:middle
Control Center is
something that's

01:27:29.356 --> 01:27:31.396 A:middle
so simple and yet so essential.

01:27:31.926 --> 01:27:34.036 A:middle
You have those switches
that you just want to get

01:27:34.036 --> 01:27:35.816 A:middle
to really quickly
from wherever you are.

01:27:35.906 --> 01:27:38.966 A:middle
Well, now, with Control Center,
swipe up from that bottom

01:27:38.966 --> 01:27:41.376 A:middle
of the device and
there they are.

01:27:42.516 --> 01:27:46.476 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:50.646 A:middle
Turn on Airplane Mode, adjust
your brightness, play a song,

01:27:51.476 --> 01:27:57.096 A:middle
even get at a flashlight,
and available from anywhere,

01:27:57.096 --> 01:27:58.306 A:middle
including your lock screen.

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.286 A:middle
So if you wake up in the middle
of the night and you need

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:28:00.286 --> 01:28:02.876 A:middle
to find something, your
flashlight's right there.

01:28:03.586 --> 01:28:05.126 A:middle
And that's Control Center.

01:28:05.846 --> 01:28:08.636 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about Multitasking.

01:28:09.686 --> 01:28:12.976 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 has always been built

01:28:12.976 --> 01:28:16.266 A:middle
on the industrial strength
foundations of OS X.

01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:20.876 A:middle
It's had intrinsic powerful
multitasking capabilities.

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.156 A:middle
But we had to be careful
about how we'd exposed these

01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:26.266 A:middle
to applications because we want
to preserve great battery life.

01:28:27.246 --> 01:28:31.696 A:middle
Now on iOS 4 we did add
support for select kinds

01:28:31.696 --> 01:28:33.536 A:middle
of applications to
do multitasking.

01:28:33.596 --> 01:28:37.216 A:middle
Things like plain music in the
background or receiving a voice

01:28:37.216 --> 01:28:40.246 A:middle
over IP call, or your
app is in the background.

01:28:40.806 --> 01:28:44.026 A:middle
Well, now, in iOS 7, I'm pleased
to announce that we're going

01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:48.976 A:middle
to have multitasking for all
apps with great battery life.

01:28:49.516 --> 01:28:55.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:28:55.576 --> 01:28:56.466 A:middle
So, how does it work?

01:28:57.386 --> 01:28:58.836 A:middle
Well, imagine you have an app

01:28:59.136 --> 01:29:01.436 A:middle
that you're using
constantly throughout the day,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:03.986 A:middle
a social networking app or
something and you're checking

01:29:03.986 --> 01:29:07.176 A:middle
in all of the time, what iOS
7 has noticed is that pattern

01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:08.816 A:middle
of use and is going
to provide that app

01:29:08.816 --> 01:29:11.866 A:middle
with frequent background
activity to stay up to date.

01:29:11.866 --> 01:29:15.226 A:middle
And there's even other app you
used, maybe that you just check

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:17.786 A:middle
in on in the morning or
breakfast, maybe at night

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:20.356 A:middle
after work, well iOS
7 notices that too.

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.646 A:middle
And it's going to give that
app background cycles just

01:29:23.646 --> 01:29:25.836 A:middle
in time to-- it's up to
date for when you need it.

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:29.716 A:middle
Now, in addition to this
intelligence scheduling,

01:29:30.176 --> 01:29:32.746 A:middle
iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates.

01:29:33.106 --> 01:29:36.146 A:middle
The average user wakes their
device dozens of time a day

01:29:36.146 --> 01:29:37.696 A:middle
and those provide
great opportunities

01:29:37.896 --> 01:29:39.216 A:middle
when the system's
already powered

01:29:39.216 --> 01:29:41.316 A:middle
up to update apps
on the background.

01:29:42.066 --> 01:29:44.616 A:middle
It also adapts intelligently
the network conditions.

01:29:45.056 --> 01:29:46.856 A:middle
So if it's in-- you
have good coverage,

01:29:47.096 --> 01:29:48.466 A:middle
it's a great time to fetch.

01:29:49.286 --> 01:29:52.586 A:middle
And it coalesces updates
across multiple applications.

01:29:52.586 --> 01:29:54.396 A:middle
So once you have those
radios powered up,

01:29:54.396 --> 01:29:57.156 A:middle
lets multiple applications
take advantage of it

01:29:57.156 --> 01:29:58.366 A:middle
for their background updates.

01:29:58.806 --> 01:30:03.206 A:middle
And, finally, iOS 7 response to
push notifications as a trigger

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:03.206 --> 01:30:05.956 A:middle
to give that application
time in the background.

01:30:06.046 --> 01:30:07.136 A:middle
So when you follow
that notification,

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:08.516 A:middle
the app will already
be up to date.

01:30:09.516 --> 01:30:14.786 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:18.536 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 also has a great
new user interface for moving

01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.846 A:middle
between all the things you
have going on on your phone.

01:30:21.366 --> 01:30:25.446 A:middle
Now, you could double click and
move into Notifications Center

01:30:25.446 --> 01:30:27.586 A:middle
and just swipe between
your running applications,

01:30:27.706 --> 01:30:32.236 A:middle
tap and move right in and
that is multitasking in iOS 7.

Next, let's talk about Safari.

01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:45.496 A:middle
Safari is the most popular
mobile browser in the world.

01:30:46.166 --> 01:30:48.386 A:middle
And in iOS 7 we're
making it even better.

01:30:49.726 --> 01:30:52.836 A:middle
Has a great new full
screen look,

01:30:53.446 --> 01:30:54.926 A:middle
really focused on your content.

01:30:55.586 --> 01:30:57.586 A:middle
If you pull down
or tap at the top,

01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:59.616 A:middle
you can now get a
smart search field.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

From that search field, you can
get it one tap access to all

01:31:04.756 --> 01:31:09.026 A:middle
of your favorites as well
as do search and access URLs

01:31:09.436 --> 01:31:12.756 A:middle
and there's a great new
interface for your tabs.

01:31:13.566 --> 01:31:16.496 A:middle
In addition to all of this,
it has parental controls

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:20.166 A:middle
and integration with the same
iCloud Keychain you saw earlier

01:31:20.746 --> 01:31:21.506 A:middle
with Mavericks.

01:31:22.126 --> 01:31:24.896 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a demo of Safari now.

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.916 A:middle
Let's take a look.

OK, head on in to Safari.

01:31:39.106 --> 01:31:40.536 A:middle
So here we are in Safari.

01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:42.306 A:middle
I'm going to just
zoom in on this page.

01:31:42.306 --> 01:31:47.406 A:middle
I want you to watch as I scroll,
all the controls just recede

01:31:47.406 --> 01:31:49.756 A:middle
and now you have that full
screen for your content.

01:31:50.606 --> 01:31:52.626 A:middle
We've really improved the way
you navigate now in Safari.

01:31:52.626 --> 01:31:56.876 A:middle
I'm just going to tap in here
to link to a detailed story.

01:31:57.006 --> 01:31:59.446 A:middle
I mean you can even zoom
in of course on this page.

01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:02.456 A:middle
And that same gesture you saw
earlier for going back well

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

of course that works
in Safari as well.

01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:05.956 A:middle
So I just swiped in from
the edge of the display

01:32:05.956 --> 01:32:08.326 A:middle
and I can navigate
back and forth

01:32:08.326 --> 01:32:11.526 A:middle
through my browser
history just like that.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.126 A:middle
It's such a fantastic
way to browse.

01:32:15.026 --> 01:32:17.136 A:middle
Next, let's look at that
unified search field.

01:32:17.136 --> 01:32:18.636 A:middle
I'm just going to tap
up here at the top.

01:32:19.116 --> 01:32:22.066 A:middle
You see I have one tap
access to all my favorites.

01:32:22.176 --> 01:32:23.786 A:middle
It's really convenient
but I'm going to type

01:32:23.786 --> 01:32:25.846 A:middle
in this case so I'll type DIS.

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:30.146 A:middle
And you notice, I have
a top URL hit as well

01:32:30.146 --> 01:32:33.266 A:middle
as Google Search suggestions as
well available all right here.

01:32:34.336 --> 01:32:36.236 A:middle
We've really improved
bookmarking as well.

01:32:36.236 --> 01:32:38.046 A:middle
I use this bookmark
control down at the bottom.

01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:41.496 A:middle
I see my bookmark
folders, all my bookmarks.

01:32:41.926 --> 01:32:42.866 A:middle
We also have shared links.

01:32:42.866 --> 01:32:46.076 A:middle
You can see stories posted by
people you follow on Twitter.

01:32:46.546 --> 01:32:48.046 A:middle
And my Reading List.

01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:50.776 A:middle
And, now, just like you
saw on Mavericks on iOS,

01:32:50.776 --> 01:32:53.276 A:middle
you can scroll continuously
from article to article

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:54.756 A:middle
without coming back to the list.

01:32:55.016 --> 01:32:55.876 A:middle
It's really awesome.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:59.206 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at tabs.

You can see what you left open
on your other devices as well.

01:33:21.106 --> 01:33:25.576 A:middle
And tabs, they're
really nice to use.

01:33:25.576 --> 01:33:28.556 A:middle
You can just tap,
sweep into a tab,

01:33:28.746 --> 01:33:32.246 A:middle
back out, back in, back out.

01:33:32.426 --> 01:33:33.386 A:middle
It's just fantastic.

01:33:33.386 --> 01:33:35.856 A:middle
If you want to reorder your
tabs, just tap and hold,

01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:37.556 A:middle
just rearrange them like this.

01:33:37.786 --> 01:33:40.556 A:middle
And if you're done with
the tab, just swipe it off

01:33:40.556 --> 01:33:42.406 A:middle
to the side and it goes away.

you bring up the Share Sheet
and your friends that are all

to your square cropped

to live photo filters from
some gorgeous black and whites,

01:36:54.986 --> 01:36:58.106 A:middle
to some classic color
filters as well.

01:37:04.706 --> 01:37:08.406 A:middle
You know for many users this is
what their photo organization

01:37:08.566 --> 01:37:10.436 A:middle

We've all been there
but, you know,

01:37:14.406 --> 01:37:15.966 A:middle
it doesn't have to be this way.

01:37:17.666 --> 01:37:19.926 A:middle
There's great information
in those photos.

01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:22.926 A:middle
iOS knows where you took the
photos and when you took them

01:37:22.926 --> 01:37:26.186 A:middle
and that provides inherent
structure that we can use

01:37:26.186 --> 01:37:27.746 A:middle
to organize those photos.

01:37:27.896 --> 01:37:31.036 A:middle
And now in photos
in iOS 7, we do.

01:37:31.406 --> 01:37:33.036 A:middle
We organize them into moments.

01:37:33.166 --> 01:37:35.276 A:middle

a demo of that right now.

organize these photos explicitly

intelligently together

into collections.

01:38:25.746 --> 01:38:27.816 A:middle
So see here how that
multiple day trip

01:38:27.816 --> 01:38:30.556 A:middle
around San Francisco is
collected-- sorry about that,

01:38:30.556 --> 01:38:32.466 A:middle
I've got a little
excited there, into--

01:38:32.466 --> 01:38:34.756 A:middle
it's a very exciting interface

01:38:34.756 --> 01:38:38.396 A:middle
into a multi-day trip
in San Francisco.

01:38:38.516 --> 01:38:40.936 A:middle
And that time at home and
around the school, well,

01:38:40.936 --> 01:38:44.026 A:middle
that's one moment-- that's
one collection as well.

01:38:44.466 --> 01:38:46.226 A:middle
It's a really great way
to browse your photos.

01:38:46.566 --> 01:38:50.316 A:middle
You can even go all the
way out to the year level.

01:38:51.716 --> 01:38:53.696 A:middle
Look across your whole
photo collection.

01:39:01.276 --> 01:39:04.196 A:middle
And look how we pull out the
interesting places that you went

01:39:04.196 --> 01:39:08.966 A:middle
in that year like 2011 was
Colorado and Hawaii, 2012,

01:39:09.266 --> 01:39:10.346 A:middle
went to South America.

01:39:10.346 --> 01:39:11.666 A:middle
You may not remember
when you did it

01:39:11.666 --> 01:39:13.946 A:middle
but iOS does and
it's right there.

01:39:14.736 --> 01:39:18.456 A:middle
And, you know, with this retina
display you can even can make

01:39:18.456 --> 01:39:20.516 A:middle
out patterns of photos in
one different occasions

01:39:20.516 --> 01:39:22.736 A:middle
or in a course we found like
we had the urge that we wanted

01:39:22.736 --> 01:39:24.206 A:middle
to just tap in right from here.

01:39:24.516 --> 01:39:26.576 A:middle
And so now in fact you can.

01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:28.776 A:middle
You can just tap and scrub

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:32.356 A:middle
and find the photo you're
looking for just like that.

01:39:32.356 --> 01:39:33.876 A:middle
It's really just amazing.

01:39:33.876 --> 01:39:36.866 A:middle
So I can just pick a photo
here whichever one I want.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:39.876 A:middle
It's kind of cute and
now we can edit it

01:39:39.876 --> 01:39:41.106 A:middle
because we have photo filters.

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:42.506 A:middle
So I can go into
the filters here,

01:39:42.886 --> 01:39:47.086 A:middle
I can try different color
effects, and if I find one I

01:39:47.086 --> 01:39:49.036 A:middle
like maybe a nice
black and white,

01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:50.496 A:middle
you can do it just like that.

01:39:50.726 --> 01:39:52.586 A:middle
I'll apply it and
save that photo away.

01:39:53.266 --> 01:39:54.316 A:middle
We also have great new ways

01:39:54.356 --> 01:39:56.486 A:middle
to share your photos
in the Photos apps.

01:39:56.486 --> 01:39:56.976 A:middle
Let's bring up sharing.

01:39:58.436 --> 01:40:01.626 A:middle
We have AirDrop right here if
any of you were running iOS 7,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:40:01.626 --> 01:40:03.076 A:middle
I'd see you, it looks
like it didn't leak,

01:40:03.076 --> 01:40:03.876 A:middle
so that's good you're not

01:40:03.876 --> 01:40:06.416 A:middle
in there right now,
but you have AirDrop.

01:40:06.546 --> 01:40:08.776 A:middle
You have access to other
photos, you can share them

01:40:08.776 --> 01:40:10.826 A:middle
from right here,
just really handy.

01:40:11.456 --> 01:40:14.056 A:middle
Great photo sharing option
is iCloud photo sharing,

01:40:14.056 --> 01:40:15.196 A:middle
I'm going to tap on that now.

01:40:15.366 --> 01:40:16.676 A:middle
It's going to iCloud
photo sharing.

01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:19.686 A:middle
And from here, I can
select the Photo Streams

01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:20.786 A:middle
that I want to share too.

01:40:21.066 --> 01:40:23.376 A:middle
So I'm on family photos now,
but I'm going to drill in

01:40:23.816 --> 01:40:26.506 A:middle
and I can see other Photo
Streams I've set up.

01:40:26.506 --> 01:40:30.536 A:middle
And now, other people can share
into my Photo Stream as well.

01:40:30.536 --> 01:40:31.796 A:middle
So these are shared
Photo Streams.

01:40:32.516 --> 01:40:36.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:40:37.416 --> 01:40:42.506 A:middle
I'll just select a Photo Stream
here and type a little message.

01:40:43.796 --> 01:40:44.726 A:middle
We'll post that photo.

01:40:44.726 --> 01:40:46.826 A:middle
So it made it really
easy to share

01:40:46.966 --> 01:40:49.016 A:middle
and we've also made it a
really great experience

01:40:49.366 --> 01:40:51.636 A:middle
to experience the photos
you and others have shared

01:40:51.636 --> 01:40:53.146 A:middle
with this new shared
tab at the bottom.

01:40:53.146 --> 01:40:54.246 A:middle
So I'm going to go in here.

01:40:54.246 --> 01:40:56.346 A:middle
I could see my photo
with a comment.

01:40:56.646 --> 01:40:58.606 A:middle
I can see the comments
of other people

01:40:58.606 --> 01:41:00.226 A:middle
and the photos that
they've shared.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:41:00.666 --> 01:41:06.086 A:middle
And now, we even support sharing
video via iCloud photo sharing.

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.836 A:middle
And we have a great way to just
browse those shared photos.

01:41:11.836 --> 01:41:13.606 A:middle
I'll just tilt the
device into landscape.

01:41:14.076 --> 01:41:15.546 A:middle
I can scroll through
it like this.

01:41:16.666 --> 01:41:18.466 A:middle
And just look how
beautiful that is.

01:41:18.846 --> 01:41:20.776 A:middle
What a great way to
experience your photos.

01:41:20.956 --> 01:41:24.136 A:middle
So that's the new
photos App in iOS 7.

01:41:25.516 --> 01:41:32.386 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:35.826 A:middle
So integration with internet
services is a huge part

01:41:35.826 --> 01:41:40.716 A:middle
of the experience of iOS and
never more so than in iOS 7.

01:41:41.196 --> 01:41:43.246 A:middle
So to take you through
some of those features,

01:41:43.346 --> 01:41:45.216 A:middle
I'd like to bring up Eddy Cue.

01:41:45.736 --> 01:41:46.166 A:middle
Eddy. [Applause]

01:41:50.076 --> 01:41:50.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great job, Craig.

01:41:50.576 --> 01:41:50.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:41:52.836 --> 01:41:54.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, it's great
to be here.

01:41:54.746 --> 01:41:56.146 A:middle
So let's talk about Siri.

01:41:56.636 --> 01:42:00.706 A:middle
The first thing is Siri has
a gorgeous new interface.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:42:01.236 --> 01:42:04.706 A:middle
Now as I speak, you'll see a
sound wave across the bottom

01:42:05.816 --> 01:42:08.916 A:middle
and you get the result to a
beautiful, gorgeous, clean way.

01:42:09.986 --> 01:42:13.776 A:middle
But Siri is always been a lot
about your-- the voice of Siri.

01:42:13.776 --> 01:42:15.416 A:middle
And we've got an all new voice.

01:42:16.046 --> 01:42:16.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, Eddy.

01:42:16.936 --> 01:42:17.846 A:middle
What can I do for you?

01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:20.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And you can also
choose a male voice.

01:42:21.376 --> 01:42:21.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, Eddy.

01:42:22.166 --> 01:42:23.016 A:middle
What can I do for you?

01:42:23.906 --> 01:42:25.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And we've got high
quality-- thank you.

01:42:27.246 --> 01:42:29.326 A:middle
We've also got high
quality female

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:31.806 A:middle
and male voices for French.

01:42:32.516 --> 01:42:34.546 A:middle
[Foreign Language]

01:42:35.046 --> 01:42:35.826 A:middle
As well as German.

01:42:36.296 --> 01:42:38.016 A:middle
[Foreign Language]
And we're going

01:42:38.016 --> 01:42:39.836 A:middle
to be adding other
languages over time.

01:42:40.236 --> 01:42:43.486 A:middle
Now Siri is also getting a
lot smarter and knows how

01:42:43.486 --> 01:42:44.966 A:middle
to control more of your device.

01:42:44.966 --> 01:42:50.046 A:middle
So you could say, play my last
voice mail or turn on Bluetooth

01:42:50.766 --> 01:42:52.156 A:middle
or increase my brightness.

01:42:53.516 --> 01:42:58.906 A:middle

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.956 A:middle

lot more questions

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:43:02.396 --> 01:43:05.816 A:middle
because we've integrated some
new services like Twitter,

01:43:05.816 --> 01:43:08.916 A:middle
so you can see what people are
saying or what's happening.

01:43:09.806 --> 01:43:12.616 A:middle
We've integrated the
world's largest Encyclopedia

01:43:12.706 --> 01:43:13.626 A:middle
and Wikipedia.

01:43:14.396 --> 01:43:17.576 A:middle
And we've even integrated
web search results

01:43:17.576 --> 01:43:19.736 A:middle
from Bing right inside of Siri.

01:43:20.726 --> 01:43:22.446 A:middle
And it's great for photos too.

01:43:24.006 --> 01:43:27.936 A:middle
And that is some of the new
features of Siri in iOS 7.

01:43:29.076 --> 01:43:31.586 A:middle
Now Siri is also a big
part of our next feature.

01:43:31.586 --> 01:43:35.006 A:middle
iOS in the car.

[ Applause ]

01:43:40.766 --> 01:43:45.746 A:middle
Now 95 percent of the cars being
sold today have integrated music

playback and control
from an iOS device,

01:43:48.006 --> 01:43:50.456 A:middle
but we want to take
this integration

01:43:50.456 --> 01:43:52.156 A:middle
to a whole another level.

01:43:53.496 --> 01:43:57.736 A:middle
What if you could get iOS
on the screen that is built

01:43:57.736 --> 01:44:02.086 A:middle
into your car so that you can
make phone calls, play music,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:44:02.506 --> 01:44:06.856 A:middle
go to maps, get your iMessages
right on the screen in your car

01:44:07.166 --> 01:44:09.346 A:middle
or Eyes Free using Siri.

01:44:10.056 --> 01:44:12.326 A:middle
So now, when you
make a phone call,

01:44:12.326 --> 01:44:15.206 A:middle
it's going to look something
like this, call John Appleseed,

01:44:15.746 --> 01:44:26.336 A:middle
or play get lucky, or go
to maps, get directions,

01:44:28.126 --> 01:44:30.676 A:middle
or even get your
iMessages read to you

01:44:30.676 --> 01:44:33.826 A:middle
and you can dictate a
response all Eyes Free.

[ Applause ]

01:44:40.956 --> 01:44:44.186 A:middle
Now, all of these car
manufacturers are introducing

01:44:44.386 --> 01:44:48.716 A:middle
iOS integration in 2014 and I
know which one I want to buy.

01:44:51.876 --> 01:44:53.486 A:middle
And that's iOS in the car.

01:44:54.136 --> 01:44:55.886 A:middle
Next, the App Store.

01:44:57.036 --> 01:44:58.796 A:middle

We've added a new feature where
you can look for apps based

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:08.426 A:middle
on your age range,
kid's categories,

01:45:08.526 --> 01:45:11.286 A:middle
parents are going to love this.

and here are the
apps I would see.

discover new apps.

It's really great.

because everyday, you
see something like this.

the best music player

songs on your device,

and you get our beautiful

you get all of your movies and

of featured stations that our

Let's go and see what
else is on this station.

And a great thing is I can
always modify the station,

01:49:31.046 --> 01:49:33.886 A:middle
I can just tap the star, and
I could say play more songs

01:49:33.886 --> 01:49:37.816 A:middle
like this, or never play this
song, or add it to my wish list.

01:49:37.816 --> 01:49:42.476 A:middle
Now, I like this so let's play
some more songs like this.

01:49:42.476 --> 01:49:45.156 A:middle
Now, another great feature of
iTunes Radio is it keeps track

it all to iPad as well.

Now, there's more to iOS 7
than we had time to talk to you

01:51:19.516 --> 01:51:20.886 A:middle
about in depth here today.

01:51:21.466 --> 01:51:23.626 A:middle
Things like FaceTime audio

01:51:23.696 --> 01:51:26.946 A:middle
where you now can do audio
only high quality audio calls

01:51:26.946 --> 01:51:29.746 A:middle
over Wi-Fi on any iOS device.

01:51:29.746 --> 01:51:36.386 A:middle
Notification syncs so if
you dismissed a notification

01:51:36.386 --> 01:51:38.326 A:middle
on one device, you don't have to
deal with it over and over again

01:51:38.326 --> 01:51:39.156 A:middle
on your other devices.

01:51:39.156 --> 01:51:44.916 A:middle

who just won't let go phone
FaceTime and message blocking.

in the audience are you?

01:52:05.206 --> 01:52:08.026 A:middle
So, in addition to all of these
is one feature I want to talk

01:52:08.026 --> 01:52:11.196 A:middle
about in a little bit more
detail which is activation lock.

01:52:11.996 --> 01:52:16.636 A:middle
So hundreds of millions of
us use to Find My iPhone

01:52:16.916 --> 01:52:19.886 A:middle
to find their phone when
it's just lost in the couch

01:52:19.886 --> 01:52:23.276 A:middle
or maybe left at Starbucks,
but also when it's been stolen.

01:52:24.556 --> 01:52:27.726 A:middle
And now, with activation
lock, if a thief tries

01:52:27.756 --> 01:52:30.216 A:middle
to turn off Find My iPhone

01:52:30.846 --> 01:52:35.166 A:middle
or if they even wipe the device
entirely, they will not be able

01:52:35.256 --> 01:52:38.676 A:middle
to reactivate it because they
don't know your iPod user

01:52:38.736 --> 01:52:39.626 A:middle
name activation.
