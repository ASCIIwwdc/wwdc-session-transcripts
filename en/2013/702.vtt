[ Silence ]

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:11.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:12.846 A:middle
Everyone hear me?

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:16.966 A:middle
All right, welcome to
Efficient Design with XPC.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.866 A:middle
Thanks for choosing Russian
Hill for your post-lunch siesta.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:21.276 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.856 A:middle
So on the agenda for today, this
a talk that's going to focus

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:29.586 A:middle
on performance and the two
dimensions of that are going

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:32.555 A:middle
to be architectural
design and implementation.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.926 A:middle
And towards those ends,

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.386 A:middle
we're going to be covering
some new features in XPC

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:38.856 A:middle
and cover some more advanced

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:41.426 A:middle
and more efficient usage
patterns beyond some

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:43.866 A:middle
of the basics that you might
have been exposed to over time.

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:50.216 A:middle
So last time we gave a talk
on XPC, it was WWDC 2011.

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:53.006 A:middle
So, let's do a short recap.

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:59.136 A:middle
XPC is combined service
bootstrapping and IPC.

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:02.416 A:middle
So, everything relating to
getting a service up and running

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:05.596 A:middle
and talking to it,
exchanging messages,

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:08.156 A:middle
it's all in the same library.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.316 A:middle
And this enables you to
easily factor your app

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:16.086 A:middle
into different services so that
one service can be responsible

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.976 A:middle
for, say, network communication,

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:19.886 A:middle
they can have additional
privilege levels,

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:20.536 A:middle
things like that.

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:23.686 A:middle
And they are all deployed
within the App Bundle

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:25.146 A:middle
and they never leave
the App Bundle.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.226 A:middle
So why would you use this?

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:31.156 A:middle
Well, separate address basis
provide some key benefits.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:33.686 A:middle
The first big one
is Fault Isolation.

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:36.236 A:middle
So if you have a piece of code
that's going to be running

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:38.956 A:middle
in your app, let's say it's
dealing with untrusted data

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.306 A:middle
and you don't necessarily
want bugs in your parser

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:43.016 A:middle
to bring down the entire app.

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.356 A:middle
Putting in another process means

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:47.716 A:middle
that if you do encounter
a bug parsing some

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:52.536 A:middle
of that untrusted data,
you'll end up crashing, say,

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:55.186 A:middle
the service but the main
app is free to try again

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:57.146 A:middle
or display some UI
to the user saying,

00:01:57.146 --> 00:01:58.276 A:middle
"Sorry, I couldn't do this."

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:01.236 A:middle
And also, on the other
side of this coin,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:03.726 A:middle
you'll have a different
set of privilege levels

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:06.016 A:middle
for that same-- for
that service.

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
So your app might have a set
of entitlements for example

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:11.566 A:middle
that allow it to,
say, talk to iCloud

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.536 A:middle
or read the contacts database
but the service that's working

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
with untrusted data doesn't
necessarily need all of that.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.836 A:middle
So, even if there is a
bug in a parser to exploit

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:24.596 A:middle
to get random code
running, code running

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:28.396 A:middle
in that process will not be able
to really do a whole lot that,

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:29.996 A:middle
say, the main app
would be able to do.

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:32.876 A:middle
And this allows you to
design with the principle

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.636 A:middle
of least required
privilege in mind.

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:38.796 A:middle
And we also provide a
completely managed lifecycle

00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:39.956 A:middle
for all these services.

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:44.086 A:middle
So, you don't have to worry
about spawning them yourself

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.396 A:middle
or setting up an idle exit
timer so that they exit

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:49.066 A:middle
in an appropriate time.

00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:51.026 A:middle
We completely manage
all of it for you

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.086 A:middle
and there's a lot less
boilerplate for you to write.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.996 A:middle
So we have two ways that
XPC is kind of exported

00:02:57.996 --> 00:02:58.956 A:middle
to you, the developer.

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.476 A:middle
The main one is Bundled
Services.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:03.676 A:middle
These are the things that
we were just talking about.

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:04.826 A:middle
They ship in the app.

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:06.036 A:middle
They never leave there.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:07.516 A:middle
They're completely--
they're meant

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:10.366 A:middle
to be basically stateless
on-demand helpers that come

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:13.346 A:middle
up to do something, maybe a
service, few more request,

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:16.066 A:middle
and can then be reclaimed
by the system later.

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.296 A:middle
And that's part of that
fully managed lifecycle.

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:21.296 A:middle
And this is the supported
way on the App Store

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:25.876 A:middle
to have multiple processes
running in your application.

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:31.646 A:middle
We also support launchd services
so that you can XPC to talk

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:33.466 A:middle
to a launchd job that
you put on the system.

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:36.976 A:middle
But this requires an additional
step for installation.

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:38.516 A:middle
You have to have
the launchd plist

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:41.516 A:middle
in either Library LaunchDaemons
or Library LaunchAgents.

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:43.926 A:middle
And so the App Store
does not like that.

00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:45.676 A:middle
We want everything to
stay in the bundle.

00:03:45.806 --> 00:03:47.096 A:middle
So you can actually
use this part

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.296 A:middle
of the technology on the Store.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.766 A:middle
But if you have a Gatekeeper
app or you're a sysadmin,

00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:53.276 A:middle
it's still useful for you.

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:57.856 A:middle
So all of this means a little
more boilerplate code for you

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.336 A:middle
to write, but you do get
additional capabilities.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:02.256 A:middle
You can run as root for one,

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:04.146 A:middle
which is not allowed
for App Store apps.

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:06.736 A:middle
And you can also run
your code independent

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:08.916 A:middle
of the lifecycle
of an application.

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:11.116 A:middle
So if you just have some
background piece of work

00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:16.116 A:middle
that needs to happen every so
often, you can use XPC to talk

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:17.636 A:middle
to it, initiate it,
and get it running.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:21.896 A:middle
So here's what we provide today.

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.176 A:middle
All of this is built
on top of libobjc

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:26.996 A:middle
which is the Objective
C runtime.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:31.616 A:middle
So-- and XPC is very
heavily built on libdispatch,

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:32.806 A:middle
and both of those kinds

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:37.186 A:middle
of objects are actually objc
objects in Mountain Lion

00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:40.576 A:middle
and later so they can
participate in ARC.

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:46.496 A:middle
And then way up in a space
somewhere is NSXPC connection

00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:47.916 A:middle
which was introduced
in Mountain Lion.

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:52.896 A:middle
And that's a really nice set of
Cocoa APIs that aren't just kind

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.766 A:middle
of like square bracket
wrappers for XPC.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:59.186 A:middle
They enable a lot of very
powerful Cocoa programing idioms

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:02.366 A:middle
that we just really can't do
down at the libSystem Layer

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:04.086 A:middle
where the C Library exits.

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:08.486 A:middle
So let's get started by
talking about architecture.

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:12.776 A:middle
So here are our architectural
goals with XPC.

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:16.226 A:middle
The first one we want is to
avoid long running processes.

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:17.656 A:middle
These are things
that just kind of sit

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:19.056 A:middle
around on the system forever.

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:20.996 A:middle
They might be listening
for an event.

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:22.366 A:middle
They might be doing
periodic work.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.066 A:middle
But we would much rather that
they launch on-demand and exit

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:28.106 A:middle
when they're not needed so that
there's no risk of them, say,

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:29.326 A:middle
going crazy and starting

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:31.086 A:middle
to consume resources
in the background.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
We also want to be able to
adapt to changes on the system.

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
So, the system's resource
availability is changing all the

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
time when the user opens an app,
new sets of services come up.

00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:44.956 A:middle
The user might log in,
more users log out.

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:48.866 A:middle
This means that memory, CPU
and Joules are all things

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:52.006 A:middle
that are being shared across the
system and we want to be able

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:55.196 A:middle
to say you-- you know,
you're part of a--

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.806 A:middle
you're part of a collective
and we need to divvy

00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:58.946 A:middle
out these resources fairly.

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:02.246 A:middle
And finally, we want
things to initialize lazily.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:04.526 A:middle
So this goes with
the on-demand theme.

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:08.586 A:middle
In other words, don't do work
unless the user has actually

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:12.176 A:middle
done something where you need
to initialize all of that.

00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:15.316 A:middle
So, you know, be as
on-demand as possible.

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
So the support list in Lion,

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:24.066 A:middle
we have the technology called
XPC Events and this is kind

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:27.776 A:middle
of a-- it's using XPC but
without actually having,

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.486 A:middle
say, an app messaging you.

00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:32.066 A:middle
It's more like the system
is a source of demand.

00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:35.476 A:middle
And some of those demand
sources are IOKit events.

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:37.316 A:middle
So, you can have a launchd job

00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:39.046 A:middle
that will kick off
whenever changes

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.896 A:middle
in the IO Registry happen.

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:43.996 A:middle
And we support BSD
Notifications.

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:47.146 A:middle
So if you're familiar with
Notify APIs in libSystem,

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:50.566 A:middle
you can just post a notification
and a launchd job kicks off.

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:53.756 A:middle
In Mountain Lion, we
all-- sorry, in Sea Lion--

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
sorry, in [laughter] Mavericks,

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:01.206 A:middle
we also introduced CF
Distributed Notifications.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:04.096 A:middle
So if that's your preferred
way to post a notification

00:07:04.096 --> 00:07:05.366 A:middle
and kick a job off on-demand,

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.126 A:middle
that is now supported
by XPC Events.

00:07:09.506 --> 00:07:12.526 A:middle
And-- so, this technology
is really only available

00:07:12.526 --> 00:07:14.586 A:middle
to launchd services
because you need

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:16.266 A:middle
to specify it in your plist.

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:17.506 A:middle
So here's how that works.

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:20.676 A:middle
So in your launchd plist, you
have this Launch Events Key

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:23.626 A:middle
and you're going to specify
"These are the kinds of events

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:24.976 A:middle
that I want launch
be on-demand."

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:28.356 A:middle
In this case, we're going to
talk about IOKit Matching.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.696 A:middle
So here we have a dictionary

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.676 A:middle
of all the IOKit
Events that I want.

00:07:32.816 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
In this case, it's just the one.

00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:37.826 A:middle
And this is, you know, my
company's device was attached.

00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:40.166 A:middle
And in this case, it's
just a matching dictionary.

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:43.526 A:middle
So you're going to have the
product ID, the vendor ID

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.816 A:middle
and the provider class all
in that matching dictionary

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.796 A:middle
and XPC will implicitly install
this matching dictionary,

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.076 A:middle
listen for it on your behalf,

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:55.316 A:middle
and kick you off
when this happens.

00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:57.576 A:middle
And for Legacy reasons, you have

00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:01.216 A:middle
to add this IOMatchLaunchStream
key and set it to true,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.486 A:middle
just do that, I won't
explain why.

00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:07.676 A:middle
And once these events
are posted,

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:08.826 A:middle
they need to be consumed.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:12.456 A:middle
And you consume them by setting
a handler and this is a lot

00:08:12.456 --> 00:08:14.736 A:middle
like a handler on
an XPC Connection.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:18.126 A:middle
So you just call this XPC set
of Event Stream Handler API.

00:08:18.836 --> 00:08:22.976 A:middle
And the first argument is that
com.apple.iokit.matching name

00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:25.826 A:middle
which says, "This is the
handler for the IOKit Events."

00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:28.756 A:middle
And then it takes a
dispatch queue and a block.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:31.266 A:middle
And the block gets
invoked on that queue.

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.785 A:middle
And then once that
block has been invoked,

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:35.106 A:middle
the event has been consumed.

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:38.546 A:middle
And this event is treated
like an IPC message.

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:41.086 A:middle
So if you don't consume
the event, say,

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:43.576 A:middle
by not setting a handler,
after you'll exit,

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:45.796 A:middle
you'll be relaunched
to process it.

00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:49.766 A:middle
In the case of the IOKit
Notification system,

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:54.956 A:middle
each notification has a
payload that allows you

00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:59.296 A:middle
to extract the registry ID of
the thing of the node that fired

00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:00.916 A:middle
and then you can reconstruct it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:04.966 A:middle
and turn it into
an IO service T.

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:09.136 A:middle
So we've taken this
idea of things

00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:11.306 A:middle
that can launch you
on-demand and extended it

00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:13.306 A:middle
to Centralized Task Scheduling.

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:15.836 A:middle
And you interact
with this technology

00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:18.446 A:middle
through the XPC Activity APIs.

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:21.066 A:middle
And what this let's you
do is schedule things kind

00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:22.786 A:middle
of on an opportunistic basis.

00:09:23.536 --> 00:09:26.616 A:middle
If you have some piece of work,
let's say it's a network fetch

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
or doing some random
housekeeping, you might not want

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:30.606 A:middle
to have it happen now.

00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:32.586 A:middle
You just want it to
happen at some point.

00:09:32.586 --> 00:09:33.996 A:middle
You don't really care when.

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:36.756 A:middle
And you'd rather
just the system--

00:09:37.036 --> 00:09:38.226 A:middle
leave it up to the system

00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:40.356 A:middle
and let the system
determine when a good time is.

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:44.786 A:middle
And the idea here is to minimize
the disruption of this work

00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:46.366 A:middle
to the user experience.

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:49.026 A:middle
So if the user is not
using the machine,

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:51.856 A:middle
that might be a good
time to do some activity

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:54.826 A:middle
that synchronizes a bunch
IO to disk for example.

00:09:55.176 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
And this allows us to more
efficiently utilize the battery

00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:00.786 A:middle
because we can take
certain tasks

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.786 --> 00:10:02.766 A:middle
that have similar
characteristics like, say,

00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:06.056 A:middle
run every 15 minutes, and
run all of those tasks

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.766 A:middle
on the same 15-minute interval
rather than letting them run

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:12.966 A:middle
on their own kind of
15-minute intervals.

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.916 A:middle
And this is new in Mavericks.

00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:17.176 A:middle
So we have two basic
activity types.

00:10:17.176 --> 00:10:18.686 A:middle
There's maintenance and utility.

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:20.766 A:middle
Maintenance and stuff
like garbage collection.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:23.346 A:middle
Let's say, you periodically
write some files out to disk

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:25.946 A:middle
and you don't really need
to keep track of them.

00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:28.286 A:middle
These tasks are going
to be interrupted

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.606 A:middle
when the user starts
using the machine.

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:31.846 A:middle
And they're going
to be kicked off

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:33.696 A:middle
when the user is basically idle.

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:36.896 A:middle
We also have a utility
type which is stuff

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:38.116 A:middle
like fetching network data.

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:41.626 A:middle
So this task is more directly
important to the user.

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:45.176 A:middle
So we're only going to interrupt
it when resources become scarce.

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:50.806 A:middle
So the criteria by which
you can specify an activity

00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:54.786 A:middle
to kick off are things like
being on or off AC power.

00:10:55.066 --> 00:10:57.026 A:middle
Whether the battery level
is at a certain percentage,

00:10:57.026 --> 00:10:58.556 A:middle
whether the hard
disk is spinning

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:00.116 A:middle
and whether the screen
is asleep.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:03.086 A:middle
So we can actually do your
work while the user is, say,

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.246 A:middle
not using the machine but
it's plugged in to AC power.

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:08.196 A:middle
That might be a great
time to do some--

00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:11.246 A:middle
any kind of indexing task that
your app might need to do.

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:16.016 A:middle
And this is available to
launchd and XPC services.

00:11:17.986 --> 00:11:19.426 A:middle
And what's really neat here is

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:21.546 A:middle
that it'll persist
across launches.

00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:25.476 A:middle
So, we can interrupt an
ongoing activity that you have

00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:28.766 A:middle
and then exit your process

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.546 A:middle
because it's not a good
time to do the activity.

00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:33.556 A:middle
But then when a good time to do
the activity does come along,

00:11:33.556 --> 00:11:37.626 A:middle
we'll launch you
on-demand to keep going

00:11:37.626 --> 00:11:39.506 A:middle
and potentially complete
that task.

00:11:39.506 --> 00:11:41.566 A:middle
And everything just kind of
picks up where it left off.

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:46.266 A:middle
So here's how you would just
create a basic activity.

00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:49.686 A:middle
In this case, the activity
criteria are specified

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:52.886 A:middle
in an XPC dictionary and
we're going to set a few keys.

00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:54.846 A:middle
In this case, we
have an interval.

00:11:54.846 --> 00:11:56.206 A:middle
So we have a desired interval

00:11:56.206 --> 00:11:58.106 A:middle
of every five minutes
this thing should go.

00:11:58.566 --> 00:12:02.656 A:middle
And the grace periods, you know,
we have a 10-minute slack time.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:04.956 A:middle
So it's like we'd like every
five minutes but it's okay

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.626 A:middle
to kind of play with
that up to 10 minutes.

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:11.636 A:middle
And then we're going to set
this XPC Activity Handler.

00:12:11.956 --> 00:12:15.146 A:middle
So you just name your
activity, give the criteria

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:16.236 A:middle
and then a Handler Block.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:22.396 A:middle
And the Handler Block delivers
the activity object that's being

00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:24.966 A:middle
invoked to you so
that you can figure

00:12:24.966 --> 00:12:27.786 A:middle
out which activity you're
dealing with, if you have many

00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:30.876 A:middle
of them, and where to pick
up after you left off.

00:12:31.306 --> 00:12:34.106 A:middle
So right now, we've
been invoked.

00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:37.696 A:middle
So we're going to get some
piece of data from somewhere

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:40.576 A:middle
and then we're going to set
the activity state to continue.

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:43.146 A:middle
And that just means that,
you know, yes, we're going.

00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:46.356 A:middle
And then, as the
activity is going,

00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:51.216 A:middle
we're going to dispatch Async to
the main queue to update a view.

00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:53.966 A:middle
And then once that block
completes, we say, "Hey,

00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:55.286 A:middle
now this activity is done

00:12:55.286 --> 00:12:56.516 A:middle
and you don't have
to do it anymore."

00:12:56.856 --> 00:12:59.456 A:middle
But if that block never gets
invoked for whatever reason,

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:03.346 A:middle
let's-- and then let's say the
app is killed before it can be

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:03.346 --> 00:13:06.526 A:middle
invoked, we'll bring you back
and then you'll be invoked

00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:07.646 A:middle
with this Handler Block again

00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:08.806 A:middle
and you'll get another
opportunity

00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:10.146 A:middle
to try completing that task.

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:13.946 A:middle
So that's what we
have architecturally.

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:17.436 A:middle
This is how to-- this helps
you design more efficient apps

00:13:17.436 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
that play better on the system.

00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:23.306 A:middle
So, let's dive into the actual
ways you can use the APIs better

00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:24.986 A:middle
to get more efficient
performance.

00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:28.146 A:middle
Let's start by covering what we
have a service lifecycle now.

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:30.696 A:middle
So right now, we have
an app and we have one

00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:32.786 A:middle
of its services there
on the right.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:36.666 A:middle
The app is going to send some
messages to that service.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:38.426 A:middle
The service gets
launched on-demand

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:39.976 A:middle
and it starts doing stuff.

00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:42.936 A:middle
While it's doing this
stuff, it's protected

00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:45.936 A:middle
from sudden termination
which means that the system

00:13:46.006 --> 00:13:49.726 A:middle
under Memory Refresher won't
see that this is something

00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:50.616 A:middle
that can be reclaimed.

00:13:51.136 --> 00:13:54.416 A:middle
But, as the replies for all
those message got sent back,

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.656 A:middle
you saw that that green
bubble kind of faded away

00:13:58.126 --> 00:14:01.006 A:middle
and that means that as soon
as the last one goes away

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:03.436 A:middle
or as soon as the last reply is
delivered, the system is free

00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:04.816 A:middle
to reclaim that service again.

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:09.176 A:middle
So we have the service
launched on-demand.

00:14:09.386 --> 00:14:11.976 A:middle
The system stops it as needed.

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:14.336 A:middle
These conditions can
be Memory Refresher

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:17.696 A:middle
or idleness and lack of use.

00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:23.156 A:middle
And we will also tear everything
down when the app quits.

00:14:23.256 --> 00:14:25.726 A:middle
So, Sudden Termination
as it applies

00:14:25.726 --> 00:14:28.796 A:middle
to XPC is automatically handled.

00:14:29.106 --> 00:14:32.426 A:middle
So since XPC knows when
you're receiving a message

00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:35.006 A:middle
or sending a reply to a
message, we can disable

00:14:35.236 --> 00:14:36.746 A:middle
and enable Sudden Termination

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:38.996 A:middle
as we see those events
coming and going.

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:41.366 A:middle
So in this case,
we get a message

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:43.976 A:middle
and then we immediately disable
Sudden Termination for you.

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.566 A:middle
And then when we see
that you've replied

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:47.566 A:middle
to that message,
we'll re-enable it.

00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:49.696 A:middle
And as soon as all your
replies have been sent,

00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:51.256 A:middle
you're killable by
the system again.

00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:53.916 A:middle
So we've taken the same
idea and applied it

00:14:53.986 --> 00:14:55.786 A:middle
to something called
Importance Boosting

00:14:55.786 --> 00:14:57.156 A:middle
which is new to Mavericks.

00:14:57.686 --> 00:15:01.086 A:middle
And this is the default behavior
now for bundled services.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.646 A:middle
And what happens is that they
are background by default.

00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:07.246 A:middle
So whatever the service does
will by default not interfere

00:15:07.246 --> 00:15:09.496 A:middle
with any UIApplications
that might be running.

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:12.866 A:middle
But, if the UIApplication
does message that service,

00:15:13.076 --> 00:15:15.596 A:middle
the service's priority
gets promoted temporarily

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:16.816 A:middle
to handle that request.

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.166 A:middle
And the idea here is
with everything else is

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.446 A:middle
to minimize the disruption of
your work to the user experience

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:25.016 A:middle
if it's not directly aiding it.

00:15:25.076 --> 00:15:26.556 A:middle
So here's how that
lifecycle works.

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:30.166 A:middle
It's very similar to how the
transactional lifecycle was

00:15:30.166 --> 00:15:30.946 A:middle
managed before.

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:34.836 A:middle
So the app comes up, sends
some messages to the service,

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:37.526 A:middle
and then the service
gets launched on-demand,

00:15:37.526 --> 00:15:40.886 A:middle
and now it's protected but now
it's boosted for that entire--

00:15:41.176 --> 00:15:42.556 A:middle
for all three of those messages.

00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:46.306 A:middle
And then once those messages get
sent, then the boost goes away.

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:50.096 A:middle
And then any work after that
point, any work the service does

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:53.216 A:middle
on its own behalf like, say,
from a timer or something

00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:56.146 A:middle
like that does not
interfere with the app.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.436 A:middle
The app will win any
resource contention fights.

00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:03.366 A:middle
So that's bundled XPC
services by default.

00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:06.436 A:middle
But if you have a launchd job,
you can also opt into this.

00:16:06.436 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
And we have a new plist key
called Process Type in Mavericks

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:15.406 A:middle
that you can use on your launchd
job to opt into this behavior.

00:16:15.656 --> 00:16:16.666 A:middle
And once you've opted in,

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:20.446 A:middle
it all just works
basically transparently

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.836 A:middle
because through the same
mechanisms that we use

00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.796 A:middle
for tracking, sudden
termination.

00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:29.856 A:middle
We also have some other values
for that Process Type key.

00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:32.906 A:middle
Adaptive is the one we
would prefer that you use

00:16:32.906 --> 00:16:35.166 A:middle
because it means that you'll
only contend with apps

00:16:35.426 --> 00:16:36.926 A:middle
when you're doing
work on their behalf.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.696 A:middle
And this is useful when
you have a launchd job

00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:40.746 A:middle
that your app communicates with.

00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:46.656 A:middle
If the launchd job never really
needs to steal resources away

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:49.216 A:middle
from apps on the system, you
can set it to background.

00:16:49.596 --> 00:16:52.606 A:middle
And this is useful if you
have a launchd job that's part

00:16:52.606 --> 00:16:55.986 A:middle
of the app but doesn't-- the app
doesn't really have a dependency

00:16:55.986 --> 00:16:57.356 A:middle
on anything that the job does.

00:16:57.356 --> 00:17:01.226 A:middle
So it's not supposed to update
its UI in response to something

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:02.566 A:middle
that that launchd job is doing.

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:04.455 A:middle
We also have this
Interactive key.

00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:08.846 A:middle
We'd rather that you simply
not use it because it will mean

00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:10.415 A:middle
that your service,
whatever it does,

00:17:10.415 --> 00:17:12.626 A:middle
can always potentially
steal resources away

00:17:12.626 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
from an application

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:16.486 A:middle
and potentially results
in a stuttering UI.

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.925 A:middle
And then there's a
Standard which is the same

00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:20.476 A:middle
as just not specifying
something.

00:17:20.476 --> 00:17:22.306 A:middle
So if you really just
want to have this key

00:17:22.306 --> 00:17:28.465 A:middle
in your plist, use that value.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.706 A:middle
So, we do a manner of
Automated Boost Tracking,

00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:33.446 A:middle
but you might want to
persist your boosts.

00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:36.966 A:middle
So you might have a work that
is going on outside the scope

00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:39.086 A:middle
of what XPC can know about.

00:17:40.116 --> 00:17:42.926 A:middle
So when you get a message,

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:45.396 A:middle
by the time you've gotten
the boosting message,

00:17:45.426 --> 00:17:47.096 A:middle
we've already applied
this boost to you.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:50.676 A:middle
And-- so if you want to persist
it, the first thing you're going

00:17:50.676 --> 00:17:52.226 A:middle
to do is create a
reply of that message.

00:17:52.266 --> 00:17:55.316 A:middle
And that means that the boost's
lifetime goes from the message

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
that you received into
that reply object.

00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:01.206 A:middle
And then we're going to do
some work asynchronously.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:03.296 A:middle
Since we're using
ARC in this example,

00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.906 A:middle
the reply object is
captured and retained.

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:08.706 A:middle
And therefore, the
boost stays alive

00:18:09.196 --> 00:18:12.756 A:middle
until that reply object
goes out of scope at the end

00:18:12.756 --> 00:18:15.626 A:middle
of this block and then
the message gets dropped--

00:18:15.626 --> 00:18:19.656 A:middle
sorry, and then you
send the reply

00:18:19.656 --> 00:18:21.556 A:middle
with XPC Connection
Send Message,

00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:24.926 A:middle
and then the runtime
asynchronously sends the reply

00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:25.746 A:middle
behind the scenes.

00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:28.636 A:middle
And then when its final
reference gets dropped,

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:31.126 A:middle
the reply-- when the reply
message gets de-allocated,

00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:33.046 A:middle
you'll end up dropping
your boost.

00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:36.076 A:middle
There's another pattern
where you might want

00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:40.806 A:middle
to say send multiple
replies to a single request

00:18:41.606 --> 00:18:44.436 A:middle
and also maintain the
boost for that duration

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
but the API only
directly allows you

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:47.956 A:middle
to send one reply to a message.

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:50.056 A:middle
Well we've got a--
there's a usage pattern

00:18:50.056 --> 00:18:53.666 A:middle
where you can actually do
this using multiple replies.

00:18:53.776 --> 00:18:56.306 A:middle
And you do that by having
an anonymous connection.

00:18:56.786 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
And to create that
connection, you just give Null

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.556 A:middle
as the first parameter
to XPC Connection Create.

00:19:03.616 --> 00:19:06.406 A:middle
So once we've created this,
we're going to send it

00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:09.146 A:middle
to the other side to the
service in a message.

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.886 A:middle
And it's just like sending
any other key or value.

00:19:12.156 --> 00:19:14.376 A:middle
We're just going to send
the anonymous connection

00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:17.666 A:middle
in a message key to
the key back channel.

00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:21.246 A:middle
And-- so once we've sent the
message, the other side gets it.

00:19:22.716 --> 00:19:26.936 A:middle
And then we're going
to setup our end points

00:19:27.016 --> 00:19:29.436 A:middle
to receive the replies
from that other side.

00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:32.206 A:middle
So once we've created
the connection,

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:34.836 A:middle
we're going to set an event
handler on it and this is going

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:37.996 A:middle
to be a similar kind of
event handler to the one

00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:41.056 A:middle
that you will set
for launchd's job

00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:44.046 A:middle
when you use XPC Connection
Create with MockService.

00:19:44.426 --> 00:19:47.666 A:middle
In this case, we're going
to say expect five replies

00:19:48.076 --> 00:19:50.736 A:middle
and we're going to expect--

00:19:50.926 --> 00:19:53.756 A:middle
or each invocation of this
event handler is going

00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:55.216 A:middle
to deliver a connection to me.

00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:57.096 A:middle
In this case, I'm only
ever going to get one

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:59.196 A:middle
because I've only ever
sent it to one person.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.676 --> 00:20:03.766 A:middle
So, once I get the new
connection in that handler,

00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.976 A:middle
then I set the message
handler on that connection.

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
And that handler gets invoked
whenever there's a new reply

00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:14.546 A:middle
to send to-- to be given to me
and I'm just going to do stuff

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.816 A:middle
with that message and then

00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:18.926 A:middle
that function will tell
me, "Yes, I'm done now."

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.406 A:middle
And if that's the case, we
just cancel the connection.

00:20:23.616 --> 00:20:27.216 A:middle
So on the other side, when it
receives the message containing

00:20:27.216 --> 00:20:30.386 A:middle
that anonymous connection,
it's going to extract it

00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:32.406 A:middle
with XPC Dictionary
Create Connection.

00:20:32.406 --> 00:20:35.806 A:middle
And then it just sets an event
handler on it and resumes it.

00:20:36.016 --> 00:20:38.536 A:middle
So this is only-- it's
only ever going to be used

00:20:38.536 --> 00:20:39.636 A:middle
for sending a message.

00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:42.066 A:middle
So we have an event handler

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:45.496 A:middle
that all it does is just
cancel the connect ion.

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:47.496 A:middle
And we need to have
some sort of reference

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.206 A:middle
to the connection in that block.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:52.196 A:middle
Otherwise, there will be
an implicit cancellation

00:20:52.406 --> 00:20:55.336 A:middle
of the connection
because ARC will see

00:20:55.336 --> 00:20:56.956 A:middle
that the variable
has gone out of scope

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:58.266 A:middle
in not referenced from anywhere.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:01.716 --> 00:21:04.966 A:middle
So here's the interesting
part where the server is going

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:08.796 A:middle
to send back however many
replies to the client it wants.

00:21:09.066 --> 00:21:13.106 A:middle
In this case, we're just going
to dispatch apply five things

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.126 A:middle
on a concurrent dispatch queue.

00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:18.576 A:middle
And then we're going to send
them all to that connection

00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:22.616 A:middle
that we got out of the message
the same way we would send

00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:24.766 A:middle
to any normal connection
that we created with, say,

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.216 A:middle
XPC Connection Create.

00:21:26.306 --> 00:21:27.146 A:middle
So we'll do stuff.

00:21:27.146 --> 00:21:28.226 A:middle
We'll populate the message.

00:21:28.226 --> 00:21:34.136 A:middle
And then we just send the
reply or the iterate of reply

00:21:34.136 --> 00:21:36.126 A:middle
over to the backchannel
connection.

00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:39.376 A:middle
And ARC will capture
that reply--

00:21:39.376 --> 00:21:41.826 A:middle
sorry, ARC will capture
that message object

00:21:41.876 --> 00:21:43.416 A:middle
in all five of these blocks.

00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:45.626 A:middle
So when the last of
them runs and gets--

00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:49.566 A:middle
and goes away, the message will
have its last reference released

00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:50.796 A:middle
and then your boost drops.

00:21:51.366 --> 00:21:57.136 A:middle
So we've also made some
changes to how large chunks

00:21:57.136 --> 00:21:58.356 A:middle
of data are handled in XPC.

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:02.596 A:middle
The runtime recognizes
very large data objects.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:06.516 A:middle
And when it sees one of these,
it goes down a fast path

00:22:06.516 --> 00:22:09.446 A:middle
to avoid copying
as much as it can.

00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:11.676 A:middle
So what this means to you is

00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:15.566 A:middle
that there is now a path
you can take to make sure

00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:18.286 A:middle
that when you give XPC
a large buffer of data

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:20.986 A:middle
that it is never
copied from the time

00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:23.476 A:middle
that you created data
object out of it to the time

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:27.026 A:middle
that the other guy receives it,
and it's completely copyless.

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:32.396 A:middle
So, how this works is that
we deal with the VM Object

00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:35.526 A:middle
that backs your large buffer
and then we just share it

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:37.976 A:middle
as a copy-on-write
shared memory.

00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:40.726 A:middle
And this is a page
granular allocation.

00:22:41.176 --> 00:22:45.826 A:middle
So, you can't really share--
since we use VM memory sharing

00:22:45.826 --> 00:22:48.396 A:middle
to do this, you can't really
share less than a page

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:50.916 A:middle
and you can't share, say,
one and a half pages.

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:54.756 A:middle
So it has to be a page-aligned
allocation that you own.

00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:59.006 A:middle
So a VM allocation that you've
actually taken ownership of

00:22:59.006 --> 00:23:01.596 A:middle
and created and know
the characteristics of.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:01.676 --> 00:23:03.946 A:middle
And here's why that
part is important.

00:23:04.266 --> 00:23:07.836 A:middle
So let's say we have a process
that wants to share some memory.

00:23:07.836 --> 00:23:10.916 A:middle
And let's say that this
memory-- you got it from malloc.

00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:15.426 A:middle
Malloc might have taken this
little chunk of memory denoted

00:23:15.496 --> 00:23:19.346 A:middle
by the green in that address
range and put it on a page

00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:21.366 A:middle
and then it gives out
that pointer to you.

00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:24.806 A:middle
Now, let's say that you
take that pointer and put it

00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:28.316 A:middle
in an IPC message to share
it to the other side.

00:23:28.716 --> 00:23:32.456 A:middle
The VM isn't going to just
share that green region there.

00:23:32.626 --> 00:23:35.716 A:middle
The VM is going to share
everything on that page.

00:23:35.716 --> 00:23:37.806 A:middle
And what this means is
that if you do this,

00:23:37.806 --> 00:23:41.816 A:middle
it will end up leaking random
heap data to the other side.

00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:47.166 A:middle
And since XPC-- one of
XPC's primary advantages is

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:50.306 A:middle
implementing a more secure
architecture, this would kind

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:55.286 A:middle
of defeat the purpose of that
since arbitrary code executing

00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:58.226 A:middle
in the other process would
have access to your heap data

00:23:58.226 --> 00:23:59.636 A:middle
or at least a part of it.

00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:01.076 A:middle
And there might be
a password in there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:03.346 A:middle
There could be any
number of little gems

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:07.536 A:middle
for a security attacker
to take advantage of.

00:24:08.206 --> 00:24:12.486 A:middle
So, now that we've covered how
you would safely share a piece

00:24:12.486 --> 00:24:18.426 A:middle
of data, let's dive into the
nuts and bolts of how you do it

00:24:18.426 --> 00:24:19.786 A:middle
or how you this with XPC.

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:21.256 A:middle
The first step you're going

00:24:21.256 --> 00:24:23.346 A:middle
to do is create a
dispatch data object.

00:24:23.846 --> 00:24:28.486 A:middle
And there's a new destructor to
dispatch data that you specify

00:24:28.486 --> 00:24:30.046 A:middle
which is the MUNMAP Destructor.

00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:33.606 A:middle
And, this tells dispatch
that, "Hey, this was allocated

00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:36.406 A:middle
with either MMAP or
MockVM Allocate."

00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:40.856 A:middle
So, you can use this-- you can
use the appropriate destructor

00:24:40.856 --> 00:24:41.406 A:middle
to free it.

00:24:41.826 --> 00:24:44.196 A:middle
And, once you have that
dispatch data object,

00:24:44.326 --> 00:24:46.196 A:middle
you wrap it in an XPC data.

00:24:46.406 --> 00:24:48.986 A:middle
And since we're dealing
with objects in this case,

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:52.396 A:middle
we're not copying
that buffer locally.

00:24:52.396 --> 00:24:54.676 A:middle
So, you're transferring
ownership of that large buffer

00:24:54.706 --> 00:24:57.156 A:middle
into the dispatch
and XPC subsystems.

00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:00.856 A:middle
So here's how you do it in code.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.856 --> 00:25:02.816 A:middle
So we create that
dispatch data object

00:25:02.816 --> 00:25:04.806 A:middle
with the MUNMAP Destructor.

00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:09.906 A:middle
And we give it a buffer
that points to a large chunk

00:25:09.906 --> 00:25:14.236 A:middle
of memory that we've allocated
using MMAP or MockVM Allocate,

00:25:14.236 --> 00:25:15.166 A:middle
the two are equivalent.

00:25:15.766 --> 00:25:16.916 A:middle
And we just tell it the size.

00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:20.296 A:middle
And the target queue for
the destructor to run on.

00:25:20.296 --> 00:25:21.526 A:middle
In this case, it
doesn't really matter.

00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:25.026 A:middle
So we just use Dispatch
Target Queue Default.

00:25:25.316 --> 00:25:26.656 A:middle
Once we have that data object,

00:25:26.656 --> 00:25:29.716 A:middle
we give it to XPC Data
Create with Dispatch Data.

00:25:29.766 --> 00:25:32.676 A:middle
And then we just send
the XPC data object

00:25:32.676 --> 00:25:36.096 A:middle
in the message we've
completely avoided any copies

00:25:36.096 --> 00:25:38.356 A:middle
of that really large
memory region,

00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:40.416 A:middle
so it's been transferred
much more efficiently.

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:50.216 A:middle
So this isn't just available
to the low level C APIs.

00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:54.816 A:middle
Also doable from the NSXPC
data-- NSXPC connection layer.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:58.716 A:middle
And this is now because
in Mavericks,

00:25:58.986 --> 00:26:01.916 A:middle
dispatch data is toll
free bridge with NSData.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:05.776 A:middle
So you can create a dispatch
data object and just cast it

00:26:05.776 --> 00:26:08.996 A:middle
to NSData safely to insert it

00:26:08.996 --> 00:26:10.786 A:middle
into whatever Cocoa
object graph you want.

00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:13.046 A:middle
There are some constraints
around this behavior

00:26:13.336 --> 00:26:15.346 A:middle
and that subclasses
are not going

00:26:15.346 --> 00:26:16.776 A:middle
to be toll free bridged here.

00:26:16.776 --> 00:26:18.366 A:middle
So if you subclassed NSData,

00:26:18.366 --> 00:26:21.066 A:middle
that's not safely
interchangeable with dispatch.

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:23.666 A:middle
And you can't have
created this data objects

00:26:23.766 --> 00:26:25.296 A:middle
with No Copy method.

00:26:25.866 --> 00:26:27.636 A:middle
And when you did
create this object,

00:26:27.756 --> 00:26:31.036 A:middle
any of those following
deallocators will work.

00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:35.266 A:middle
They just basically say it's a
piece of-- it's a VM allocation.

00:26:39.016 --> 00:26:43.496 A:middle
So also new-ish in our
last big cat release,

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:45.926 A:middle
we implemented a
message receive path

00:26:45.926 --> 00:26:48.066 A:middle
and since we didn't
have a talk last year,

00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:49.546 A:middle
we'll talk about it now.

00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:51.296 A:middle
Basically, this is
now a much faster.

00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:54.336 A:middle
When XPC receives a message,
it doesn't actually have

00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:56.666 A:middle
to create an entire
objects graph

00:26:56.666 --> 00:26:57.906 A:middle
out of that message upfront.

00:26:58.276 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
So the act of receiving
a message

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:03.376 A:middle
in prior releases would end
up creating this big storm

00:27:03.376 --> 00:27:06.376 A:middle
of allocations and copies while
we unserialized everything.

00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:08.586 A:middle
Now, we just deal with
the message directly

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:09.706 A:middle
in a serialized form.

00:27:10.026 --> 00:27:12.606 A:middle
And this let's you drain
messages really quickly,

00:27:13.626 --> 00:27:16.626 A:middle
you know, and just start
processing stuff asynchronously

00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:18.846 A:middle
as fast as you can.

00:27:19.806 --> 00:27:22.166 A:middle
So there are certain kinds
of messages that we do this--

00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:23.456 A:middle
that we don't do this for.

00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:26.516 A:middle
Mainly, those messages
are things

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:28.036 A:middle
that contain out-of-line types.

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:30.276 A:middle
So if you have like
a file descriptor

00:27:30.276 --> 00:27:32.796 A:middle
or a shared memory region
inside of the message,

00:27:33.126 --> 00:27:34.696 A:middle
then we'll unpack
it all upfront.

00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:37.326 A:middle
This isn't too bad
because the assumption is

00:27:37.326 --> 00:27:39.526 A:middle
that if you're sending one of
these objects in a message,

00:27:39.766 --> 00:27:43.996 A:middle
it's probably to avoid
larger data transfers anyway.

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.586 A:middle
So, the cost of unpacking,
it is pretty trivial.

00:27:46.586 --> 00:27:48.346 A:middle
And you're not going to
send a whole ton of them.

00:27:48.346 --> 00:27:50.946 A:middle
So, they won't be too
damaging to your throughput.

00:27:53.066 --> 00:27:55.546 A:middle
You can also take-- there's also
things you can do that will wind

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:57.636 A:middle
up forcing the slow path.

00:27:57.636 --> 00:28:00.136 A:middle
So, for example, if you
get one of these messages

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:00.246 --> 00:28:03.476 A:middle
and then you start-- and then
you say you want to copy it,

00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:06.556 A:middle
we have to actually unpack
the entire thing in order

00:28:06.556 --> 00:28:08.516 A:middle
to create a copy of it.

00:28:08.516 --> 00:28:12.426 A:middle
Similarly, if you use the
XPC Dictionary Apply Routine,

00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:16.046 A:middle
we have to unpack
an XPC object T

00:28:16.306 --> 00:28:19.396 A:middle
for every key value
pair in that dictionary.

00:28:19.686 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
So, that will wind up forcing
a full unpack of everything.

00:28:26.516 --> 00:28:29.756 A:middle
And same thing there,
XPC Dictionary Get Value,

00:28:29.756 --> 00:28:33.956 A:middle
it returns an XPC object that
you can retain independently.

00:28:33.956 --> 00:28:37.406 A:middle
So that will actually unpack
the entire value associated

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:38.136 A:middle
with that key.

00:28:38.486 --> 00:28:39.326 A:middle
And so, what that means is

00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:41.876 A:middle
that if you have a
nested container inside

00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:43.756 A:middle
of that message object,

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:47.166 A:middle
then we'll unpack the
entirety of that container.

00:28:47.736 --> 00:28:51.706 A:middle
And then finally, if you modify
the dictionary, which is safe,

00:28:51.706 --> 00:28:54.166 A:middle
you're totally allowed to do
that, but if you modify it,

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:56.836 A:middle
we have to unpack everything
to get it into a form

00:28:57.076 --> 00:28:58.256 A:middle
where it's safely mutable.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:01.356 --> 00:29:02.756 A:middle
So that's we have
new in the runtime.

00:29:02.756 --> 00:29:08.016 A:middle
I wanted to also cover
the issue of timeouts

00:29:08.016 --> 00:29:12.756 A:middle
because there's a
lot of disagreement

00:29:12.756 --> 00:29:15.896 A:middle
over the best policy here
with local machine IPC.

00:29:15.986 --> 00:29:20.496 A:middle
You might have noticed that the
XPC APIs don't actually have any

00:29:20.496 --> 00:29:23.456 A:middle
support for timeouts, and
this is very intentional.

00:29:24.456 --> 00:29:29.136 A:middle
They're just really not needed
in most cases of the API usage

00:29:30.056 --> 00:29:32.686 A:middle
because local machine--

00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:34.746 A:middle
so two processes talking
on the same machine

00:29:34.746 --> 00:29:36.076 A:middle
and two processes talking

00:29:36.076 --> 00:29:38.806 A:middle
on two different machines
are actually different.

00:29:38.916 --> 00:29:42.226 A:middle
So as software engineers
and as computer scientists,

00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:45.726 A:middle
we all like to try and
consolidate two problem spaces.

00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:47.886 A:middle
This is one area
where they're separate

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.036 A:middle
and they really should be.

00:29:49.036 --> 00:29:52.706 A:middle
And the key differentiator here
is that the kernel is not flaky.

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:54.086 A:middle
It's not like the network.

00:29:54.086 --> 00:29:56.246 A:middle
It doesn't just kind
of like come and go.

00:29:56.726 --> 00:29:58.056 A:middle
It's your transport medium

00:29:58.056 --> 00:30:01.396 A:middle
and it can actually make a
guarantee for message delivery.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:02.046 --> 00:30:05.276 A:middle
So once you have this guarantee,
there's really no reason

00:30:05.606 --> 00:30:09.216 A:middle
that the remote server process
shouldn't always be responsive.

00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:10.546 A:middle
So here's an example.

00:30:11.596 --> 00:30:16.386 A:middle
Well, here's an example of
kind of the bad side of, say,

00:30:16.386 --> 00:30:19.466 A:middle
using a timeout in one of
the send and reply routines.

00:30:19.806 --> 00:30:23.806 A:middle
It will confuse the
expectations of the client side.

00:30:24.126 --> 00:30:28.136 A:middle
So, for example, if the server
end is doing a network operation

00:30:28.136 --> 00:30:33.196 A:middle
on your behalf, you might want
to attach a timeout to the reply

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:36.006 A:middle
on the client side so that
the client says, "Well,

00:30:36.006 --> 00:30:38.686 A:middle
if I don't get a reply-- it
is a networking operation,

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:41.466 A:middle
so if I don't get a
reply within 10 seconds,

00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:42.906 A:middle
then that's a timeout."

00:30:43.296 --> 00:30:47.626 A:middle
But what that does is it
confuses the network operation

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:50.386 A:middle
timing out and the server
process having a bug.

00:30:50.736 --> 00:30:54.736 A:middle
So, it might be that the network
operation would've succeeded

00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:57.566 A:middle
but there's a deadlock in your
server or there are some sort--

00:30:57.566 --> 00:31:00.016 A:middle
or there's kind of
mismanagement of resources

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.016 --> 00:31:02.606 A:middle
that prevented the server from
sending the reply in time.

00:31:02.996 --> 00:31:05.126 A:middle
But those two conditions
are going to be expressed

00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:08.496 A:middle
to the client identically and
you as a developer might end

00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:11.416 A:middle
up shipping the app with a bug

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:12.806 A:middle
that you didn't actually
know existed.

00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:18.766 A:middle
So, how would we
optimally handle this case?

00:31:18.766 --> 00:31:21.536 A:middle
Well, it's not that the network
operations shouldn't have

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.186 A:middle
the timeout.

00:31:22.286 --> 00:31:25.216 A:middle
That's just kind of a reality
of network programming.

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:28.546 A:middle
But you don't want the client
side to manage that timeout.

00:31:28.546 --> 00:31:29.776 A:middle
You want it to be managed

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:32.506 A:middle
on the thing that's actually
doing the network operation.

00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:36.516 A:middle
So the server sets up
whatever socket it needs to do

00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:38.886 A:middle
that operation, attaches
the timeout

00:31:38.886 --> 00:31:41.736 A:middle
that it thinks is appropriate
and then if that's--

00:31:41.736 --> 00:31:45.406 A:middle
if the server sees that the
request has taken too long,

00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.326 A:middle
then that means it can return--

00:31:47.326 --> 00:31:49.866 A:middle
it will return a message
to the client that just has

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:51.836 A:middle
like an E-timed out
error in there.

00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:54.756 A:middle
And so, the client
knows that, you know,

00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:56.476 A:middle
the server should
always be responsive

00:31:56.806 --> 00:31:59.446 A:middle
and if it didn't respond to me
then that means I have a bug

00:31:59.446 --> 00:32:00.436 A:middle
and I should investigate.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:06.046 A:middle
That being said, there
are cases where IPC--

00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:09.596 A:middle
local machine IPC timeouts
are actually appropriate,

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:12.646 A:middle
but they're not really
terribly common.

00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:16.276 A:middle
Usually, those cases derive
from, say, hard deadlines.

00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:19.446 A:middle
And this is also when transit
time makes a difference.

00:32:19.446 --> 00:32:22.786 A:middle
So the time it takes to send
the message to the other side

00:32:22.786 --> 00:32:24.606 A:middle
and for the other side
to send the reply back,

00:32:25.246 --> 00:32:27.616 A:middle
if that actually
matters in your use case,

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:29.706 A:middle
you might have a legitimate need

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:31.536 A:middle
for a timeout on
the client side.

00:32:31.986 --> 00:32:35.656 A:middle
And usually, this will be some
sort of realtime application

00:32:35.896 --> 00:32:38.476 A:middle
where your timeout isn't
just completely arbitrary.

00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:40.296 A:middle
It's not, you know, 10 seconds

00:32:40.296 --> 00:32:42.076 A:middle
or my favorite number
or whatever.

00:32:42.326 --> 00:32:45.366 A:middle
It's actually derived from
a desired throughput rate.

00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:48.306 A:middle
So if you're measuring
things like frames per second

00:32:48.626 --> 00:32:54.186 A:middle
or samples of audio process per
second, then timeouts are needed

00:32:54.366 --> 00:32:56.676 A:middle
so that you can know that
an operation won't complete.

00:32:56.756 --> 00:32:59.646 A:middle
And if it can't complete
in that amount of time

00:32:59.746 --> 00:33:02.406 A:middle
that you've given it,
there's really no need

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:02.566 --> 00:33:04.696 A:middle
to keep waiting for it.

00:33:04.696 --> 00:33:05.786 A:middle
You can just move on.

00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:10.456 A:middle
But like I said, these are
not exactly common use cases.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:14.756 A:middle
So we don't really have
support in the API for timeouts.

00:33:15.096 --> 00:33:18.436 A:middle
You can also-- but using
the asynchronous APIs,

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.676 A:middle
you can implement your own.

00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:24.766 A:middle
And I'm sure a lot of you
have figured that out.

00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:28.116 A:middle
So, let's also talk a
little bit about debugging

00:33:28.116 --> 00:33:33.096 A:middle
and what we've got in
Mavericks for debugger support.

00:33:34.236 --> 00:33:39.706 A:middle
The first big one is that Xcode
now transparently supports

00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:41.376 A:middle
debugging XPC services.

00:33:41.846 --> 00:33:45.466 A:middle
So, you can just take a
service, set a breakpoint

00:33:45.466 --> 00:33:47.546 A:middle
on the file that's associate--

00:33:47.606 --> 00:33:49.916 A:middle
in a source file that
your service uses,

00:33:50.036 --> 00:33:51.356 A:middle
and then you can run your app.

00:33:51.356 --> 00:33:54.216 A:middle
And then if your app takes
a code path where it talks

00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:56.406 A:middle
to the service and
launches it on-demand,

00:33:56.876 --> 00:33:59.956 A:middle
then those breakpoints that
you set will be honored.

00:33:59.956 --> 00:34:03.056 A:middle
You don't actually have
to do any other work.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:04.976 A:middle
[applause] Yeah.

00:34:05.386 --> 00:34:10.516 A:middle
So, it's important to note
that this functionality relies

00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:13.896 A:middle
on enhancements to
the host that we made.

00:34:14.196 --> 00:34:19.096 A:middle
So, it's only available
on Mavericks or later.

00:34:19.446 --> 00:34:20.426 A:middle
So, yeah, it just works.

00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:23.746 A:middle
And also nice, there's a
copy files destination now

00:34:23.746 --> 00:34:27.005 A:middle
for the XPC services
subdirectory in your app.

00:34:27.005 --> 00:34:29.076 A:middle
So, you don't have to
select wrapper directory

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:31.096 A:middle
and then specify XPC
services anymore.

00:34:31.826 --> 00:34:37.446 A:middle
We also have a tool for
debugging, importance boosting,

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:38.686 A:middle
and leaking of boosts.

00:34:38.686 --> 00:34:41.755 A:middle
So if you're running into leak
boost, there's this iptrace tool

00:34:41.755 --> 00:34:46.005 A:middle
that will tell you why you were
boosted and who boosted you.

00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:51.866 A:middle
So in terms of debugging,
just debugging tips, a lot--

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:57.126 A:middle
what a lot of people run into
is they will set everything up

00:34:57.126 --> 00:34:58.686 A:middle
and they'll run their
app the first time.

00:34:58.686 --> 00:35:01.776 A:middle
And then, immediately, when they
try and talk to their service,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:01.776 --> 00:35:03.736 A:middle
they get a connection
invalid right away.

00:35:03.736 --> 00:35:05.776 A:middle
That almost always indicates

00:35:05.856 --> 00:35:08.226 A:middle
that there's been a
configuration error.

00:35:08.226 --> 00:35:10.536 A:middle
You know, the service
isn't in the right place

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:12.636 A:middle
or the bundle isn't
structured properly.

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:16.746 A:middle
But when you see this, just a
couple of things to make sure,

00:35:16.746 --> 00:35:19.876 A:middle
make sure that the service is
a dependency of the app target.

00:35:19.876 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
So when the app gets
run, the service should--

00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:24.326 A:middle
sorry, when the app gets built,

00:35:24.616 --> 00:35:26.636 A:middle
the service should also
get built before it.

00:35:26.636 --> 00:35:29.666 A:middle
And then that service
product should be

00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:32.646 A:middle
in the copy files build phase
of your app so that it winds

00:35:32.646 --> 00:35:37.386 A:middle
up in Contents XPC
services inside the app.

00:35:37.386 --> 00:35:39.676 A:middle
And then the other
easy mistake to make is

00:35:39.676 --> 00:35:42.856 A:middle
that you might just be using
the wrong service identifier.

00:35:43.116 --> 00:35:45.966 A:middle
So the one-- the name of the
service that you want to connect

00:35:45.966 --> 00:35:50.326 A:middle
to is the CFBundleIdentifier
for that service bundle.

00:35:50.376 --> 00:35:53.016 A:middle
And sometimes that's
easy to confuse

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:57.036 A:middle
because when you view
the info plist in Xcode,

00:35:57.036 --> 00:36:00.136 A:middle
it will actually be-- it
will have dollar, you know,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:00.176 --> 00:36:03.246 A:middle
product identifier that gets
filled in at build time.

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:06.066 A:middle
So, you want to make
sure that you're using--

00:36:06.066 --> 00:36:08.236 A:middle
you're identifying your
service consistently.

00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:13.466 A:middle
XPC is also defensive.

00:36:13.706 --> 00:36:14.956 A:middle
It's really easily offended.

00:36:15.316 --> 00:36:17.046 A:middle
And this is also intentional.

00:36:17.406 --> 00:36:23.346 A:middle
So, we do our best to detect
noticeable cases of API misuse

00:36:23.416 --> 00:36:27.216 A:middle
and then we abort the
process with that back trace

00:36:27.316 --> 00:36:31.426 A:middle
so that you can fix the bug
before actually deploying

00:36:31.426 --> 00:36:31.796 A:middle
your app.

00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:37.016 A:middle
And so, we'll do this when,
you know, we detect conditions

00:36:37.016 --> 00:36:39.406 A:middle
that will almost certainly
lead to data corruption

00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:41.646 A:middle
or where data corruption
has clearly happened.

00:36:42.376 --> 00:36:44.686 A:middle
Things like underflowing
the retain count,

00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:48.566 A:middle
if you're still using manual
retain/release on XPC objects

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:52.426 A:middle
and just other examples
of obvious API misuse.

00:36:52.806 --> 00:36:57.226 A:middle
A lot of this is detailed
in the XPC Abort Man Page

00:36:57.226 --> 00:36:58.446 A:middle
which is in section three.

00:36:58.846 --> 00:37:01.036 A:middle
And you'll-- the
tell-tale sign for this is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:01.036 --> 00:37:04.356 A:middle
that you'll see an illegal
instruction being issued

00:37:04.356 --> 00:37:06.576 A:middle
and you're process
will terminate.

00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:15.676 A:middle
So, in the case where you
got crash report that--

00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:18.156 A:middle
where this has happened,
you'll see stuff

00:37:18.156 --> 00:37:21.416 A:middle
in the applications specific
information telling you why

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:23.216 A:middle
this-- why the process
was aborted.

00:37:24.516 --> 00:37:28.306 A:middle
But you might be attached to the
service or the app with LLDB.

00:37:28.706 --> 00:37:30.756 A:middle
In which case, you're not
going to get a crash report.

00:37:30.756 --> 00:37:31.116 A:middle
You're not going

00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:33.066 A:middle
to get applications
specific information.

00:37:33.176 --> 00:37:39.116 A:middle
But we provide a debugger
specific API called xpc debugger

00:37:39.116 --> 00:37:42.456 A:middle
api misuse info that you can
call from within the debugger

00:37:42.456 --> 00:37:45.216 A:middle
and that will-- the result
of that will be a pointer

00:37:45.216 --> 00:37:48.406 A:middle
to the string that
we would've printed

00:37:48.406 --> 00:37:51.726 A:middle
in the application specific
information of the crash report.

00:37:52.496 --> 00:37:54.646 A:middle
So here's what it would
look like in a crash report.

00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:57.436 A:middle
You just have the application,
specific information

00:37:57.436 --> 00:38:00.396 A:middle
and it says API MISUSE:
Over-release of an object.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:04.086 A:middle
So in this case, we called
XPC release more times

00:38:04.086 --> 00:38:05.596 A:middle
that we have references
to the object.

00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:10.386 A:middle
In LLDB, you'll probably
see something

00:38:10.386 --> 00:38:13.266 A:middle
like Program received
EXC BAD INSTRUCTION

00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:16.586 A:middle
which is the Mock exception in
this case but it maps to SIGILL.

00:38:17.086 --> 00:38:21.376 A:middle
And then from the LLDB
command line, we just do a p

00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:25.836 A:middle
and then call that debugger
API that I mentioned before

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:29.016 A:middle
and then it will print the
string that's associated

00:38:29.116 --> 00:38:31.406 A:middle
that that API would've returned.

00:38:34.776 --> 00:38:38.306 A:middle
And if you're hounding
your syslog looking

00:38:38.306 --> 00:38:40.146 A:middle
for every little thing that's
happening on the system,

00:38:40.426 --> 00:38:42.046 A:middle
you might have seen a
message that looks like this.

00:38:42.046 --> 00:38:44.996 A:middle
This is what it looks
like in Mavericks.

00:38:45.596 --> 00:38:47.956 A:middle
In previous releases, the part

00:38:48.096 --> 00:38:50.846 A:middle
where it says assertion
failed says bug.

00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:58.516 A:middle
This is cryptic and--
to file a bug

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:01.806 A:middle
because we now how
to make sense of it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:02.136 --> 00:39:05.196 A:middle
If you're curious, it's just
the program counter offset

00:39:05.536 --> 00:39:09.626 A:middle
from the beginning of the
libxpc image in the process

00:39:10.066 --> 00:39:13.676 A:middle
where we encountered some weird
error that we didn't expect

00:39:13.676 --> 00:39:16.566 A:middle
and that last part is the
error code that we encountered.

00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:18.896 A:middle
Like I said, we know
how to make sense of it.

00:39:18.896 --> 00:39:22.486 A:middle
If you see of these, file
a bug with that log line

00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:24.366 A:middle
and any other relevant
contextual information

00:39:24.366 --> 00:39:27.126 A:middle
that you have and we'll look
into it and hopefully fix it.

00:39:27.206 --> 00:39:32.046 A:middle
So, that's pretty much
of what we've got.

00:39:32.046 --> 00:39:34.956 A:middle
So for more information on
any of these technologies,

00:39:34.986 --> 00:39:38.686 A:middle
Paul Danbold is the Core
OS Technology Evangelist.

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:41.976 A:middle
The documentation for
XPC, we have a full suite

00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:43.716 A:middle
of man pages in section three.

00:39:44.166 --> 00:39:47.176 A:middle
I'm sure there are some
great man page viewer apps

00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:49.386 A:middle
on the store if you don't like
viewing them in the terminal.

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:50.666 A:middle
But I encourage you to read them

00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:53.186 A:middle
because they're very
well put together.

00:39:53.546 --> 00:39:54.736 A:middle
And we also have a full set

00:39:54.736 --> 00:39:58.436 A:middle
of HeaderDoc inside the
actual headers of XPC.

00:39:58.436 --> 00:40:01.936 A:middle
So, look in User
Include XPC and then all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:05.186 A:middle
of those public interfaces
are documented with HeaderDoc.

00:40:05.926 --> 00:40:08.546 A:middle
And then the Daemons and
Services Programming Guide

00:40:08.546 --> 00:40:13.296 A:middle
which is on the developer
documentation website covers

00:40:13.466 --> 00:40:16.596 A:middle
when you would want to use a
launch daemon and the lifecycle

00:40:16.596 --> 00:40:18.766 A:middle
of XPC services and
all that fun stuff.

00:40:18.946 --> 00:40:22.866 A:middle
And if none of these resources
can answer your specific

00:40:22.866 --> 00:40:26.306 A:middle
question or you still have
questions about things

00:40:26.306 --> 00:40:28.756 A:middle
that aren't covered there,
there's always the Dev Forums

00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:29.906 A:middle
where you can just ask us

00:40:29.906 --> 00:40:33.566 A:middle
and we occasionally check
the Dev Forums as engineers

00:40:33.566 --> 00:40:37.276 A:middle
and if we can answer
you, we will.

00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:43.516 A:middle
Relatedly, the debugging
support for XPC and Xcode

00:40:43.516 --> 00:40:46.856 A:middle
that I mentioned is going to
be demoed in the Debugging

00:40:46.856 --> 00:40:51.136 A:middle
with Xcode session and that's
in Pac Heights tomorrow at 2:00.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:54.436 A:middle
There's also a session later
today which also cover some

00:40:54.436 --> 00:40:56.486 A:middle
of the architectural
things that we talked

00:40:56.486 --> 00:40:59.646 A:middle
about like XPC activities,
centralized tasks scheduling,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:02.446 A:middle
and making more efficient apps.

00:41:02.686 --> 00:41:04.546 A:middle
And that's Building
Efficient OS X Apps.

00:41:04.546 --> 00:41:06.036 A:middle
That's in Nob Hill later today.

00:41:06.036 --> 00:41:07.126 A:middle
And that's it.

00:41:07.126 --> 00:41:08.486 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of
the conference.
