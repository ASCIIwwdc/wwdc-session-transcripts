&gt;&gt; Welcome.

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:41.066 A:middle
We have a great -- great

This is a non-technical session
so you can just relax and enjoy

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:55.056 A:middle
as we celebrate some
really cool apps.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.106 A:middle

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.766 A:middle
in design and innovation
on iOS and OS X.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:08.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Each year finding the
best apps becomes more

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:09.276 A:middle
and more challenging.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There are more developers,
more apps, more technologies,

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:17.626 A:middle
more ideas, more
innovation every day.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Before we began, we
want to acknowledge you,

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:23.236 A:middle
the developers who've
worked so hard to make all

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:27.406 A:middle
of the amazing iOS and OS
X apps that people love

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:28.626 A:middle
and that have changed
our culture.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; They've changed the way that
we work, the way that we play,

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:34.946 A:middle
and the way that we connect.

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.886 A:middle
And we just -- we just want
to take a moment to thank you

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.866 A:middle
for your hard work and anybody
else who's watching this event

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.976 A:middle

Awards and we have changed
the way that we judge things,

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:06.856 A:middle
but we still look for many of
the same qualities in apps.

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.205 A:middle
We look for apps
that are attractive

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.206 A:middle
and have strong visual design.

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:14.106 A:middle
We look for apps that
have intuitive interaction

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:15.906 A:middle
or really great gameplay.

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:19.076 A:middle
We look for apps that have
great attention to detail.

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:22.186 A:middle
And we look for apps with
high production value.

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:26.206 A:middle
We also look for apps
that are high performance,

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.946 A:middle
that are super responsive,
and give immediate feedback.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:33.066 A:middle
We look for apps that have
deep system integration

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.526 A:middle
and that take advantage of all
relevant Apple technologies.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
And finally, we look for
apps that are unique,

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:44.626 A:middle
apps that bring an innovation
or new approach to something,

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.446 A:middle
or they bring innovative
gameplay in a way

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:48.726 A:middle
that we've never seen before.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.156 A:middle
And these are the
kinds of things --

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.306 A:middle
well-designed, state-of-the-art,
and innovative --

00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:58.446 A:middle
these are the attributes
that bring people back again

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.166 A:middle
and again and again
to great apps.

receive an amazing set

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:11.216 A:middle
of prizes: The 13-inch
MacBook Air, an Apple TV,

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:16.026 A:middle
a 27-inch iMac, 15-inch MacBook

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:21.236 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.196 A:middle

new people here at the AD --

at WWDC this year, and at the
ceremony I bet you didn't knows

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.666 A:middle
that these cubes light
up when you touch them.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.836 A:middle
They are touch sensitive and
the Apple logo glows just

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.916 A:middle
like the back of your
MacBook Pro screen.

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:01.176 A:middle

all the work, yeah.

benefit from this anyway.

medium, long-term tasks.

00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:22.716 A:middle
These guys put it together
probably 'cause they're not

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.996 A:middle
that good with that and they
are procrastinators themselves.

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:27.716 A:middle
But we thought this
was such a great app

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.146 A:middle
by a couple of students.

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:31.546 A:middle
It uses numerous
iOS technologies,

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.516 A:middle
integrates with Facebook
and Twitter

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.966 A:middle
so that you can share tasks
with other students that are

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:38.546 A:middle
in your class or in your year.

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:40.986 A:middle
It looks great on
Retina display,

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:43.176 A:middle
and is totally optimized
for iPhone 5.

these guys to put together,

and they had no idea that
they were doing this for us.

But these are self-taught
iOS developers.

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:47.146 A:middle
They put a prototype for this
app together in a weekend,

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:50.316 A:middle
and it creates a mosaic
across multiple screens;

00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:53.716 A:middle
so you select an image, and
then it uses core animation,

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:55.886 A:middle
device motion, and gestures

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:59.396 A:middle
to determine the devices'
relative location to each other

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:01.986 A:middle
and which determine which
part of the image it draws.

now they're going to swipe

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.656 A:middle
And I think that they're
going to love adding this

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:13.506 A:middle
to their display of ADAs.

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:18.956 A:middle
But, you know, Coda 1, five
years ago or six years ago

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:23.696 A:middle
in 2007, won and ADA, and we
at the time thought it was just

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:24.876 A:middle
such an incredible app.

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:29.136 A:middle
And we felt that these
guys deserved a new ADA

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:33.515 A:middle
because Coda 2, it's been
six years in the oven,

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.746 A:middle
and it is just -- it
is so much stronger

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:38.905 A:middle
and it's a majoring
update to the app

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:40.025 A:middle
that they had previously.

00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:41.166 A:middle
And you know what?

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.916 A:middle
More than anything else, we felt

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:45.076 A:middle
that this app was
a shining example

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:49.116 A:middle
of what a great Mac app is
supposed to look like and behave

00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:50.536 A:middle
like and be built like.

00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.606 A:middle
And it's a highly flexible
IDE for web development

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:59.556 A:middle
with very customizable UI;
it has an extensive use of --

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:02.356 A:middle
extensive support for plug-ins
so they can add on a lot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:02.356 --> 00:09:05.936 A:middle
of extra functionality; and they
support endless web development

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:11.486 A:middle
technologies and languages --
ActionScript, ASP, CFML, CSS,

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:14.856 A:middle
HTML, Java, JavaScript,
and the list goes on.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:20.476 A:middle
This app is deeply integrated
with OS X, and the guys

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:21.916 A:middle
at Panic know how to do this.

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.386 A:middle
Many of you probably
consult with them

00:09:24.386 --> 00:09:26.136 A:middle
for assistance --
technical assistance.

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:29.796 A:middle
The app is built on AppKit,
as are most OS X apps,

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:31.746 A:middle
but they do everything
the right way.

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:35.546 A:middle
They're built on core animation,
iCloud, Notification Center;

00:09:35.546 --> 00:09:37.076 A:middle
they use QuickLook;
they're integrated

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.526 A:middle
with AirPlay and more.

00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:41.086 A:middle
And probably the coolest

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:45.366 A:middle
and most innovative feature
is AirPlay, which is tied

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:47.456 A:middle
to Diet Coda on the iPad

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:48.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; AirPreview.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:49.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; AirPreview, sorry.

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:52.986 A:middle
It allows you to
dynamically preview the work

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:54.856 A:middle
that you're doing, the
code that you're making,

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:56.566 A:middle
you can preview that
on the iPad.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:59.796 A:middle

It's just got this great
attention to detail.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:57.436 A:middle

it's across multiple

rewrote this client.

more technologies on Mac OS X

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:27.316 A:middle

&gt;&gt; How you doing?

00:25:18.626 --> 00:25:19.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Congrats you.

00:25:19.256 --> 00:25:19.596 A:middle
Are you Louis?

00:25:19.716 --> 00:25:20.986 A:middle
We're going to start with you.

00:25:21.456 --> 00:25:25.446 A:middle
These three did some pretty
impressive work and we'd

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:26.576 A:middle
like to tell you about them now.

00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:27.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Stand here.

00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's start with
Louis Harboe,

00:25:29.636 --> 00:25:30.776 A:middle
in the middle here I believe.

00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:33.496 A:middle
Louis is 17 years old and
attends the University

00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:35.056 A:middle
of Chicago's Laboratory
High School.

00:25:35.566 --> 00:25:39.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Louis began developing
on iOS in the seventh grade,

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:42.656 A:middle
and he's already collaborated
on several apps in the App Store

00:25:42.656 --> 00:25:43.676 A:middle
that have been featured in the

00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:45.526 A:middle
"Chicago Sun-Times"
and on "Cult of Mac."

00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:48.726 A:middle
His WWDC Scholarship App,
which you're seeing here

00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:51.426 A:middle
on screen scrolling through it,
is called "My Adventure book,"

00:25:51.866 --> 00:25:55.086 A:middle
and it presents a scrolling
list of photos and videos

00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:58.196 A:middle
that tell the story or
provide details about his apps,

00:25:58.496 --> 00:26:01.936 A:middle
his education, his experiences,
his friends, his family,

00:26:01.936 --> 00:26:04.966 A:middle
and etc. You tap on each
one of these, they expand

00:26:04.966 --> 00:26:06.066 A:middle
and provide more detail.

00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:09.736 A:middle
And Louis also interned
at Square recently here

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.636 A:middle
in San Francisco, and this tab,

00:26:11.676 --> 00:26:13.746 A:middle
this little photo right
there, tells you that.

00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:17.026 A:middle
So pretty amazing stuff
for four days of work.

00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:17.976 A:middle
Congratulations, Louis.

[ Applause ]

00:26:25.246 --> 00:26:27.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Next, let's look at
Bryan Keller's work.

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:30.176 A:middle
Brian's 19 years old, attends
Marist College in New York,

00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
and is studying computer
science.

00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:36.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So Bryan is really extremely
passionate about programming

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:39.816 A:middle
and he's got an app in the App
Store today called "Augmentative

00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:41.136 A:middle
and Alternative Communication."

00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:44.236 A:middle
And he believes that
technology should be intuitive

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:44.906 A:middle
and approachable.

00:26:44.906 --> 00:26:48.276 A:middle
And the app that you're seeing
right here is just named

00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:48.976 A:middle
"Bryan Keller."

00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:50.726 A:middle
It's not available in the App
Store -- none of theirs is --

00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:55.046 A:middle
but it presents a word cloud
that could be tapped and zoomed

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:59.166 A:middle
to reveal details about his
apps, his family, his life,

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.006 A:middle
his school, his sports,
and his interests.

00:27:01.006 --> 00:27:03.966 A:middle
And we picked it because it
had hockey I think is one

00:27:03.966 --> 00:27:04.896 A:middle
of the words, right?

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:05.826 A:middle
No. Kidding.

00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:06.976 A:middle
We picked up it because
we liked it.

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:09.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So that's Bryan's app.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:09.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good job.

00:27:17.046 --> 00:27:18.876 A:middle
And finally, Puck Meerburg.

00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:20.616 A:middle
Puck is 13 years old.

00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:23.856 A:middle
He's from Delft in the
Netherlands, and he loves

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.146 A:middle
to code, as you will see.

00:27:26.426 --> 00:27:29.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So pay close attention
here, okay.

00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:32.756 A:middle
Puck learned HTML, PHP, and
JavaScript when he was six,

00:27:33.016 --> 00:27:37.136 A:middle
all right; he's been recognized
as the Internet Hero of 2011

00:27:37.136 --> 00:27:40.496 A:middle
by the VNN, a Dutch television
network; he's presented

00:27:40.496 --> 00:27:45.206 A:middle
at TEDx Amsterdam when he was
11; and he's released ten apps

00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:46.786 A:middle
on the App Store already

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:51.366 A:middle
that have been downloaded
200,000 times.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:52.986 A:middle

it uses UIKit, Core Animation,

00:28:06.316 --> 00:28:09.176 A:middle
Multi-Touch, Core Graphics to
present a comprehensive resume

00:28:09.176 --> 00:28:10.356 A:middle
of his life and interests.

00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:12.026 A:middle
And each section is different.

00:28:12.026 --> 00:28:12.876 A:middle

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:14.686 A:middle
on these clouds,
dragging them around.

00:28:14.686 --> 00:28:15.536 A:middle
They're just kind of floating

00:28:15.536 --> 00:28:17.496 A:middle
around telling you
what he dreams of doing

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:18.746 A:middle
and where he plans to be.

All right.

00:28:22.686 --> 00:28:23.906 A:middle

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:27.176 A:middle
to highlight these three
students for amazing work.

I will say, too,
