00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:10.426 A:middle
[ Silence ]

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:11.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:16.386 A:middle
[applause] Before
we get started,

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:19.326 A:middle
I'd like to do a
small, informal survey.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.076 A:middle
How many of you are
new Apple developers?

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:27.776 A:middle
Please clap your hands.

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:28.466 A:middle
[applause] Excellent.

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:32.536 A:middle
Welcome. And how many
of you have made an app

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.746 A:middle
for iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch?

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:36.626 A:middle
Please clap your hands.

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:42.086 A:middle
[applause] It sounds
like about all of you.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:44.756 A:middle
OK. And how many of those

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:47.456 A:middle
that have made apps have
brought those same apps

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.146 A:middle
over to OS X, to the Mac?

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:52.666 A:middle
[applause] Sounds
like a few of you.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.636 A:middle
But it sounds like we're all
in the right place today.

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:56.906 A:middle
Did you know that in
the last quarter alone,

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.976 A:middle
Apple sold nearly
4 million Macs?

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.606 A:middle
Yeah, and we want your apps to
be in every single one of them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:04.696 A:middle
And we're here to show
you how to do that.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.806 A:middle
Now, after you leave
here today, you're going

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:09.666 A:middle
to be ready to do three things.

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:16.176 A:middle
Number one, number one, yeah,
that's all right, you're going

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.366 A:middle
to be able to rethink
your iOS app in terms

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.766 A:middle
of a Mac, in terms of OS X.

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:25.886 A:middle
Two, you're going
to be able to--

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.116 A:middle
you're going to be ready
to restructure your code,

00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:30.396 A:middle
just cleanly separate
your model from your view

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.516 A:middle
and your controller so that you
can maximize your code reuse.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.076 A:middle
And number 3 is easy.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.616 A:middle
You're going to be ready
to just get started.

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:40.236 A:middle
So let's talk about your design.

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:45.026 A:middle
Many of you may be thinking,
"OK, so I have my iOS app

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:47.206 A:middle
and I'm going to bring it
over to OS X and I'm going

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.336 A:middle
to leave everything the same

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:49.976 A:middle
because that's going
to be pretty easy."

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:52.896 A:middle
I'm going to discourage
you from doing that.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.996 A:middle
Your users are going to love
it if you embrace the things

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:56.976 A:middle
that make the Mac great.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:01:59.896 A:middle
So what makes the Mac
different form iOS?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:04.006 A:middle
Well, for one thing,
screen size.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:10.476 A:middle
If you think about it, your
iPhone is on a 4-inch display

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:13.136 A:middle
if you have an iPhone 5,
or if you have an iPad,

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:14.306 A:middle
it's on a 10-inch display.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:17.746 A:middle
But our Macs go from
an 11-inch Macbook Air

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:20.056 A:middle
to a 27-inch Thunderbolt
Display.

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:24.466 A:middle
And your users could
have multiple displays.

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:26.386 A:middle
So, that's something
to think about.

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:30.596 A:middle
And then on top of that,
your content is going to be

00:02:30.596 --> 00:02:31.976 A:middle
on a window that's resizable.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:37.536 A:middle
So, who knows how big your
content will be for the user

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:38.576 A:middle
at any one point in time.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:41.956 A:middle
So, I'm going to encourage
you to use Auto Layout

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.356 A:middle
because that's going to
solve a lot of your issues

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:47.416 A:middle
with these different
display sizes.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.006 A:middle
OK. Let's talk about
input devices.

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.576 A:middle
On iOS, your primary input
device is your finger

00:02:55.016 --> 00:03:00.616 A:middle
and as such, we've given
you guidance to use controls

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
and buttons that are
44 points by 44 points.

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.936 A:middle
Now, in OS X, your input
devices are a trackpad or mouse,

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:11.726 A:middle
and are much more precise.

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:15.126 A:middle
So you don't want to make your
controls unnecessarily large

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:16.216 A:middle
on OS X.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:17.796 A:middle
It's going to look-- well,

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.966 A:middle
it looks out of place
so keep that in mind.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.246 A:middle
What about other things?

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:24.146 A:middle
What are some other things
that make the Mac different?

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:30.226 A:middle
Well, for one thing, the Mac's
got menus and keyboard shortcuts

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:32.156 A:middle
and these aren't just any menus.

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:35.006 A:middle
Mac users are going to
be expecting to see File,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.816 A:middle
Edit, and the Window menu.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.586 A:middle
And they're going
to be able to--

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:42.916 A:middle
they're expecting to see the
standard keyboard shortcuts

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.316 A:middle
for those menus.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
Like for instance,
Cut, Copy, and Paste.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:50.956 A:middle
And they're going to expect
to see Undo and Redo support.

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:53.576 A:middle
You may have it in your
iOS apps but you may not.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:55.766 A:middle
But on the Mac, if
it's appropriate,

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:58.846 A:middle
please use that because your
Mac users will expect it.

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:03.426 A:middle
They're going to expect to be
able to drag files and texts

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:07.596 A:middle
and images into, out of, and
between windows in your apps.

00:04:08.846 --> 00:04:11.666 A:middle
Quick Look is a technology
on OS X that allows users

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:15.556 A:middle
to see the contents of your file
without opening it in your app.

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:18.616 A:middle
And we've handled many
of the common cases

00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:20.706 A:middle
like for PDF, and texts, images.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.826 A:middle
But if you're using
a custom file format,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:25.946 A:middle
if you're making a custom
file format in your app,

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:30.996 A:middle
it'll be great if you added a
Quick Look plugin to allow users

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:34.566 A:middle
to see the contents of your
file without opening your app.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.896 A:middle
That would really
make them happy.

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:40.756 A:middle
Similarly, Spotlight, that's
the technology that allows users

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:42.776 A:middle
to search the contents
of your file.

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.656 A:middle
So if you have a
custom file format,

00:04:45.596 --> 00:04:48.406 A:middle
consider making a
custom Spotlight indexer

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:51.036 A:middle
so that users can search
the contents of your file.

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:54.286 A:middle
So then, we've talked
about design a little bit.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.416 A:middle
Let's talk about your code.

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.836 A:middle
Now the good news is that
you can leverage a lot

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:03.216 A:middle
of existing knowledge that
you already know from iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:05.096 A:middle
For instance, the
design patterns,

00:05:05.586 --> 00:05:09.376 A:middle
the Model-View-Controller,
the Target-Action pattern,

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:14.596 A:middle
the Responder Chain Delegation,
all of those patterns work

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.746 A:middle
on iOS just like
they do in OS X.

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:20.536 A:middle
A new development
environment, Xcode,

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:24.946 A:middle
with its built-in user Interface
Editor and Static Analyzer,

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:29.526 A:middle
its profiling tools,
and all the things

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:32.416 A:middle
like the source control tools
that you get from Xcode,

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
all of those are available
on OS X as well as an iOS

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.666 A:middle
because you're using the
same development tool, Xcode.

00:05:39.396 --> 00:05:44.926 A:middle
The languages, C, Objective-C,
C++, and many of the frameworks

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:47.526 A:middle
like Core Foundation
and Foundation are going

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:51.106 A:middle
to be the same on iOS
as they are in OS X.

00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:53.946 A:middle
The resources, your images,

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.636 A:middle
some of your images might be
different because you're going

00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:59.486 A:middle
to be resizing them to
make them smaller perhaps,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:01.626 A:middle
but some of them
will be the same.

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:02.846 A:middle
You'll be able to
use those again.

00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:06.006 A:middle
And then, also the
image technologies,

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:09.736 A:middle
this week we're talking about
asset catalogues, Xcode,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.136 A:middle
the Xcode talked about
that and that's one

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:15.636 A:middle
of the things that's
available on both OS X and iOS

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:19.206 A:middle
and you can use that for this,
and also the naming conventions.

00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:22.576 A:middle
If you're doing a Retna Mac,
you're going to add at 2X

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:26.206 A:middle
to your file names just
like you do on iOS.

00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:29.216 A:middle
And localizations,
a lot of your--

00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:31.456 A:middle
most of your strings are
going to be exactly the same

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:33.416 A:middle
and the technologies used

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.006 A:middle
to localize are going
to be the same.

00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:37.916 A:middle
So you're going to use NS
localized string method

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:41.866 A:middle
to make sure that your
localizations work.

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:45.096 A:middle
So, I've outlined some of
the things that are the same.

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:45.836 A:middle
So what's different?

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:49.156 A:middle
Well, let's take a deeper
look at the technology stack.

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:54.816 A:middle
So here's a big table
and that has a lot

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:57.506 A:middle
of the frameworks
on iOS and OS X.

00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:59.266 A:middle
There's a couple of things
I'd like you to notice.

00:06:59.266 --> 00:07:01.966 A:middle
Number one is that a
lot of the frameworks

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:04.976 A:middle
on iOS are the exact
same as they are in OS X.

00:07:04.976 --> 00:07:09.486 A:middle
And this is actually just
a small subset of all

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:11.076 A:middle
of the frameworks that
we have available.

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:12.316 A:middle
I only did one slide here.

00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:13.936 A:middle
Actually, I did two.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:17.046 A:middle
We'll look at the other one
in a second, but, anyway.

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:19.846 A:middle
The-- but yeah, so keep in mind
that most of the frameworks--

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.406 A:middle
a lot of the frameworks
are going to be the same.

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:24.086 A:middle
Now, there are some that are
different and of the ones

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:25.266 A:middle
that are different,
most of the ones

00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:28.416 A:middle
that are different are going to
be subsets of the OS X version.

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:30.986 A:middle
So you get to keep your code
the same because you're going

00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:35.446 A:middle
to be using the subset
part on iOS.

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:37.736 A:middle
So when you move to OS X, you
can even use some new features.

00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:43.016 A:middle
The last thing I would like to
point out, most of you are going

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:48.586 A:middle
to be spending a lot of time
in UIKit and the news is

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:51.366 A:middle
that UIKit does not
exist on OS X.

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:54.126 A:middle
But the good news is
that we have AppKit.

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:56.836 A:middle
And actually, UIKit
was inspired by AppKit.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:57.556 A:middle
That's right.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.806 A:middle
That means that a lot of the
things will feel very familiar.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:04.816 A:middle
And we're going to talk about
some of the differences and ways

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:06.016 A:middle
that you can cope with those.

00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:08.866 A:middle
And then one more slide on
technology, I want to talk

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.666 A:middle
about games briefly
because some of you--

00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:12.556 A:middle
many of you may be making games.

00:08:13.036 --> 00:08:15.316 A:middle
If you're making games
for OS X, the good--

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:16.446 A:middle
there's some great news.

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:19.056 A:middle
One thing is we have OpenGL,
Game Center, and SpriteKit.

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:24.236 A:middle
And if you're making a Mac 2D
game, really take advantage

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:27.446 A:middle
of SpriteKit if you can
because that's going to do most

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:28.496 A:middle
of the heavy lifting for you.

00:08:28.496 --> 00:08:30.216 A:middle
That's already cross-platform

00:08:30.216 --> 00:08:32.056 A:middle
and so you'll have an
app that works on both.

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:36.135 A:middle
So, now that we've talked
a little bit about that,

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:38.785 A:middle
let's go into design patterns.

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.446 A:middle
Someone recognize that,

00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:43.606 A:middle
that's the Model-View-Controller
design pattern,

00:08:44.346 --> 00:08:46.086 A:middle
and hopefully you're
using that in your apps.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.036 A:middle
If you're not,

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:50.326 A:middle
Model-View-Controller is a
software architecture pattern

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.346 A:middle
that separates the
representation of information

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:54.816 A:middle
from the user's interaction
with it.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:58.116 A:middle
And the model, we're
going to talk about first,

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:02.736 A:middle
is only supposed to be used
for your data structures,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:04.896 A:middle
your business rules and logic.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.516 A:middle
And if you cleanly
separate it out that way,

00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:09.126 A:middle
you're going to get
some benefits.

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:12.816 A:middle
Almost all of your model
code is going to be reusable.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:17.026 A:middle
Why? Because the frameworks
underneath the model

00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:18.886 A:middle
are cross-platform.

00:09:19.346 --> 00:09:21.686 A:middle
So what that means,
if you have some code

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:25.616 A:middle
and here's some iOS code,
that's-- it's going to--

00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:29.906 A:middle
in it an array, a beautiful
array with ten elements

00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:34.966 A:middle
and we're going to add a string
to it, in this case, WWDC 2013.

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:37.186 A:middle
Your OS X code is going
to look like this.

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:39.126 A:middle
It's the same, right?

00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:40.856 A:middle
That's great.

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:42.056 A:middle
So you don't have to
do any work there.

00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:44.216 A:middle
So cleanly separate your model.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.836 A:middle
Now, one thing to
keep in mind is

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:49.816 A:middle
that your model code may be
making an assumption that's not

00:09:49.816 --> 00:09:54.816 A:middle
true on the Mac which is
Macs are 64 bit and iOS,

00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:57.456 A:middle
your iOS code may not
be ready to handle that.

00:09:57.456 --> 00:09:59.006 A:middle
So how do you-- what
do you for that?

00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:01.926 A:middle
Well, it's really easy.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.416 A:middle
Adapt NSInteger and NSUInterger.

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:06.756 A:middle
Those are variably sized
integers that are going

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:08.726 A:middle
to give you 64 bit
on the hardware

00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:11.746 A:middle
and we'll give you 32
bits when you need it.

00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:14.346 A:middle
So, that's perfect.

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:17.816 A:middle
Now what if you really do need
a 32 bit integer and not 64 bit?

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:19.066 A:middle
Like for instance,
if you're doing

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:22.906 A:middle
about binary file format that's
already specified and you want

00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:26.686 A:middle
to make sure that it is
right, well, we recommend

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:29.366 A:middle
that you use uint
32 t and its cousins

00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:31.756 A:middle
and that's got you
taken care of.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.336 A:middle
So what about platform
specific code?

00:10:36.096 --> 00:10:39.766 A:middle
So if I'm writing iOS only code
and there may be some times

00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:41.856 A:middle
that you do that, you're going

00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:45.976 A:middle
to use the preprocessor
macro #if TARGET OS IPHONE.

00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:49.316 A:middle
And if you're doing
Mac only code,

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:55.886 A:middle
you would use #if TARGET OS
MAC and not TARGET OS IPHONE.

00:10:57.096 --> 00:10:59.856 A:middle
OK. So now that we've
talked about the model,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:00.956 A:middle
let's go on to the view.

00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:05.506 A:middle
The view is any output
representation of your data

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:08.126 A:middle
and it's also where you're
user interface lives.

00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:12.416 A:middle
So, a big part of the user
interface are the built-in

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
control set.

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:17.556 A:middle
So what does it look
like on OS X?

00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:20.326 A:middle
Well here's kind of an
idea of the landscape.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.566 A:middle
We have a lot of controls
on iOS a ton of controls,

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:25.046 A:middle
even more controls on OS X.

00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:28.306 A:middle
And they overlap and there are
a lot of controls in common

00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:29.446 A:middle
but there are some
that are different.

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:31.726 A:middle
So, you'll need to
look at alternatives

00:11:31.726 --> 00:11:33.326 A:middle
in some cases between the two.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:37.926 A:middle
One of the most used controls
on iOS is the TableView,

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:41.926 A:middle
and good news, there's
a TableView on OS X.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.486 A:middle
So, it's called NSTableView.

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:48.886 A:middle
If you're noticing a pattern,
it's just a coincidence

00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:51.946 A:middle
but all the UIs and
actually, yeah.

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:55.076 A:middle
So, there's some
similarities between the two.

00:11:55.076 --> 00:11:57.946 A:middle
They both use data
sources as their delegates.

00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:02.886 A:middle
They both encourage the use
of reusable cells that's going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:02.886 --> 00:12:04.076 A:middle
to maximize your performance.

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:08.906 A:middle
And they both animate insertion,
deletion, and moving of cells.

00:12:08.906 --> 00:12:10.686 A:middle
So, that's great.

00:12:11.276 --> 00:12:12.616 A:middle
There are some differences too.

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:14.656 A:middle
One of the things
that's different is

00:12:14.656 --> 00:12:16.926 A:middle
that NSTableView actually
has two different variants,

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:19.326 A:middle
that's for legacy reasons.

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:21.536 A:middle
You want to use the
view-based variant.

00:12:21.646 --> 00:12:23.046 A:middle
That's most similar to iOS.

00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:26.066 A:middle
The other one NSCell and
I'm done talking about that.

00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:30.086 A:middle
It's an NScell-based
variant but don't use that.

00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:33.006 A:middle
OK. The other thing to keep
in mind is that you're going

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:34.106 A:middle
to get multiple columns.

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:35.506 A:middle
So, yay, that's cool.

00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:40.256 A:middle
And lastly, is this really
the right control for you?

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:41.096 A:middle
It may be.

00:12:41.576 --> 00:12:45.636 A:middle
If you're doing tabular data
then it's the right control

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:47.216 A:middle
for iOS and OS X.

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.026 A:middle
But if you're doing
something else,

00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:52.016 A:middle
then it might be the
right control for iOS

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:53.656 A:middle
but maybe not for OS X.

00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:55.326 A:middle
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:12:56.206 --> 00:13:00.336 A:middle
So here on your left, you're
going to see a TableView

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:04.716 A:middle
that the user selecting a region
out of a whole list of regions.

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:07.436 A:middle
In this case, they've
selected United States.

00:13:07.906 --> 00:13:10.966 A:middle
On OS X, the appropriate control

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:13.236 A:middle
to use here would
be a popup menu.

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.186 A:middle
So, think about that.

00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:19.636 A:middle
Now, one thing about that
is that you can make those

00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:23.136 A:middle
with NSPopupBotton or just drag
them out from Interface Builder.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.396 A:middle
That's probably the
easier way to go.

00:13:25.496 --> 00:13:26.546 A:middle
So what about something else?

00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:27.656 A:middle
OK. So let's look at this one.

00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:30.986 A:middle
OK. So, here's a TableView

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:32.786 A:middle
where it has it broken
up into sections.

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:34.606 A:middle
So this first section, again,
you're selecting an item

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.346 A:middle
out of-- in this
case, just two items.

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.976 A:middle
So, on OS X, we'd recommend
using a radio-button

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.056 A:middle
matrix instead.

00:13:42.946 --> 00:13:47.546 A:middle
And on OS X-- sorry, on
iOS, we have a on-off switch

00:13:47.946 --> 00:13:51.616 A:middle
in your TableView, and
that would be best suited

00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:52.696 A:middle
for a checkbox.

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:55.246 A:middle
And if-- one thing else
I'd like to point out.

00:13:55.246 --> 00:13:57.676 A:middle
This window here can be
made with a StackView

00:13:57.756 --> 00:13:59.806 A:middle
which will make your
job a lot easier.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.016 --> 00:14:00.856 A:middle
So check out that.

00:14:01.286 --> 00:14:04.506 A:middle
NSStackView, it's a new
technology for Mavericks.

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:08.436 A:middle
OK. So, what if I want
to do a custom view

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:11.556 A:middle
like making a custom button
or that kind of things?

00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:13.426 A:middle
In a lot of cases,
you're going to want

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:15.926 A:middle
to overwrite UIView or NSView.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.226 A:middle
So, what if-- so
what's the differences?

00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:19.816 A:middle
While they both receive
and handle events,

00:14:20.716 --> 00:14:24.996 A:middle
they're both responsible for
drawing, but there's a couple

00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:26.416 A:middle
of differences so
let's go in those.

00:14:27.026 --> 00:14:29.676 A:middle
The UIView's origin
is in the upper left

00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:32.466 A:middle
and the NSView's origin
is in the lower left.

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:36.236 A:middle
Before you despair, we'll have
some information on how to fix

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:38.156 A:middle
that or accommodate for that.

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:43.526 A:middle
The UIView always has a layer, a
Core Animation layer backing it,

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:45.896 A:middle
and that has some
interesting benefits.

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:47.836 A:middle
On NSView, you can have
a Core Animation layer

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:48.806 A:middle
but you have to opt-in to that.

00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:53.756 A:middle
And then, subviews can draw
outside their bounds on UIView

00:14:53.756 --> 00:14:56.006 A:middle
but they're clip to
their bounds for NSView.

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
So let's talk about origins.

00:14:57.456 --> 00:14:59.336 A:middle
I promised to show
you how to do that.

00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:00.416 A:middle
Here's what it looks like.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:04.366 A:middle
In UIView, you've got your upper
left origin, NSView, lower left,

00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:07.076 A:middle
you're just going to overwrite
isFlipped and return yes.

00:15:07.786 --> 00:15:08.836 A:middle
And what does that give you?

00:15:09.306 --> 00:15:11.066 A:middle
Well, that.

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:15.096 A:middle
So, there are some controls

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:19.596 A:middle
that are actually already have
the origin flipped for you

00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:25.126 A:middle
in advance, so be aware, and
they are NSButton, NSScrollView,

00:15:25.176 --> 00:15:27.706 A:middle
NSSPlitView, NSTabView,
and NSTableView.

00:15:28.026 --> 00:15:29.706 A:middle
So, what about layer
backed views?

00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:33.806 A:middle
So we have the Core
Animation layers on UIView.

00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:35.096 A:middle
What are the benefits?

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:36.516 A:middle
Why would we want to opt-in?

00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:38.736 A:middle
Well, we'd get smoother
animation.

00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:40.936 A:middle
And if you want to do
anything with CAFilters,

00:15:41.276 --> 00:15:43.546 A:middle
then that's the right
choice for you.

00:15:43.886 --> 00:15:46.086 A:middle
CAFfilters are pretty cool

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:48.486 A:middle
and if you watched
the SpriteKit Talk,

00:15:48.486 --> 00:15:49.576 A:middle
then you know a little
bit about that.

00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:53.716 A:middle
The downsides are that
there a lot more--

00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:55.566 A:middle
they can be more
resource extensive.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.756 A:middle
So, we urge you to test.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:01.216 A:middle
Try it out, see if it works
better, see if it fits

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:04.456 A:middle
in within the resources you
want to use, and then pick one.

00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:07.376 A:middle
So what about layer
backed views?

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:08.106 A:middle
I had-- sorry.

00:16:08.106 --> 00:16:10.666 A:middle
So we have layer backed views, I
told you what the benefits are,

00:16:10.666 --> 00:16:13.396 A:middle
and the UIViews are
automatically

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:15.146 A:middle
and you have to opt-in
on NSViews.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.866 A:middle
So, how do you opt-in?

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:21.106 A:middle
Well, in code, you would
call setWantsLayer, yes.

00:16:22.066 --> 00:16:23.416 A:middle
But you can also do an Xcode.

00:16:24.236 --> 00:16:28.756 A:middle
And so in Xcode, you go into the
Interface Builder portion of it

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:32.036 A:middle
and you would-- in the inspector
on the right, you're going

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:38.106 A:middle
to pick the last tab, that
one there, and then you click

00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:39.776 A:middle
on the little checkbox
next to your View

00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:41.326 A:middle
and that would make
it layer backed.

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:46.456 A:middle
OK. So for iOS, your animation
code might look like this.

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:48.406 A:middle
So it's-- you do an
animateWithDuration,

00:16:49.236 --> 00:16:52.376 A:middle
you pass it a time,
and then you're going

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:53.436 A:middle
to give it an animation block.

00:16:53.436 --> 00:16:56.026 A:middle
Here we're setting the frame so
we're going to animate the frame

00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:57.266 A:middle
and then I'm closing the block.

00:16:57.526 --> 00:16:59.886 A:middle
On OS X, we're going to
use animation proxies.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:03.186 A:middle
The codes look very
familiar but it's going

00:17:03.186 --> 00:17:04.336 A:middle
to be slightly different.

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:07.945 A:middle
So, instead of changing the
frame on the view directly,

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.246 A:middle
you're going to do
something like this

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:14.256 A:middle
where you call this
animator proxy in the middle

00:17:14.256 --> 00:17:15.576 A:middle
and that's going to make sure

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.705 A:middle
that your view gets
its frame set

00:17:18.326 --> 00:17:20.925 A:middle
and also that it will animate.

00:17:22.506 --> 00:17:24.705 A:middle
Now, we do also have
some additional--

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.215 A:middle
if you notice here that the--

00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:27.726 A:middle
we're not setting the
time of the animation

00:17:27.726 --> 00:17:31.056 A:middle
that has an implicit duration
and there's some more details

00:17:31.056 --> 00:17:32.666 A:middle
on that that you
can learn about.

00:17:33.146 --> 00:17:37.476 A:middle
And we'll have references
to that at the end.

00:17:38.286 --> 00:17:40.176 A:middle
So, what about events?

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:45.486 A:middle
So you have on iOS these gesture
recognizers and they're great.

00:17:46.256 --> 00:17:48.086 A:middle
So, you have the
UIGestureRecognizer

00:17:48.086 --> 00:17:50.906 A:middle
and its subclasses and it makes
it really easy to handle events.

00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:54.386 A:middle
On OS X, you can handle all
those same events but we--

00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.386 A:middle
there's no such thing as
an NSGestureRecognizer.

00:17:56.386 --> 00:17:57.186 A:middle
So how do you do it?

00:17:57.296 --> 00:17:59.456 A:middle
So here's a
TapGestureRecognizer.

00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:02.936 A:middle
And TapGestureRecognizer,
the idea here it's a lot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:04.656 A:middle
of times you use for
a simple interactions

00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:05.656 A:middle
like a simple touch.

00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:09.766 A:middle
So, on OS X, you'd be-- it
would be a simple click.

00:18:10.226 --> 00:18:13.906 A:middle
And so, you would
overwrite the mouseUp event

00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:16.006 A:middle
and handle your click there.

00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:19.016 A:middle
So, pretty easy, and you
could do mouseDown as well

00:18:19.016 --> 00:18:22.636 A:middle
but we recommend mouseUp because
it's more what the user expects.

00:18:23.126 --> 00:18:25.566 A:middle
So they can cancel the event.

00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:27.216 A:middle
OK. So what about long press?

00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:30.526 A:middle
Well, for long press,
you could do this.

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:33.746 A:middle
It's kind of complicated but it
all just run through real quick.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:37.756 A:middle
You set up a timer and
half a second timer that's

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:41.716 A:middle
to mimic the way that the
default long press recognizer

00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:42.076 A:middle
set up.

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.826 A:middle
And then you're going
to do something.

00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:45.766 A:middle
You've set up the
selector to do something,

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:46.706 A:middle
that's the bottom method.

00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:51.146 A:middle
And then in your mouseUp event,
you can invalidate that timer.

00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:53.946 A:middle
So, like for instance that they
mouseUp before the half second

00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:55.236 A:middle
was over then it would stop it.

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.806 A:middle
So, you'd be effectively
doing a long press there.

00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:01.116 A:middle
But 99 percent of the
time, you're going to want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:02.536 A:middle
to use a Right Click instead

00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.236 A:middle
because the long press is not
really going to be familiar

00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:10.686 A:middle
with a-- for the OS X crowd,
and so, use the right click.

00:19:11.286 --> 00:19:13.686 A:middle
And you're going to want
to show a menu probably.

00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:17.186 A:middle
So to help you with
that, we have a method

00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:19.666 A:middle
that you can overwrite which is
menuForEvent and that's going

00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:22.076 A:middle
to get called if you
right click on something

00:19:22.076 --> 00:19:23.596 A:middle
or if you control click on it,

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:26.496 A:middle
any kind of contextual
click, will give you this.

00:19:27.446 --> 00:19:30.306 A:middle
And with this, you're
going to pass back the menu

00:19:30.596 --> 00:19:31.916 A:middle
which is going to
handle the interaction.

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:33.806 A:middle
So what about dragging?

00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:37.396 A:middle
Well, one thing you
could do is you could set

00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:38.866 A:middle
up the mouseDown
event and you're going

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:43.716 A:middle
to record your drag start
location and your mouseDragged,

00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:46.886 A:middle
you're going to do-- you're
going to move the view and then

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:48.466 A:middle
in the mouseUp event
you'd clean up.

00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:50.856 A:middle
And that works really
well especially it will--

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:54.266 A:middle
I should say that works really
well if you're inside of a View.

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:56.086 A:middle
So if you're moving
something within a View,

00:19:56.886 --> 00:19:58.066 A:middle
then that works great.

00:19:58.066 --> 00:20:00.346 A:middle
So-- and that's kind of
what you're used to in iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:03.586 A:middle
But what if you wanted to do
something really fancy like,

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:07.206 A:middle
say drag something from
one window to another

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.946 A:middle
or perhaps one application
to another.

00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:09.786 A:middle
How would you do that?

00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.416 A:middle
Well, it's pretty simple.

00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:12.056 A:middle
I'll show you how to do it.

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:15.886 A:middle
So you're going to use this
for mouseDown or mouseDragged

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:19.046 A:middle
and then you're going
to set up a pasteboard

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:21.736 A:middle
and in your pasteboard,
you're going

00:20:21.736 --> 00:20:23.986 A:middle
to clear the current pasteboard
and then you're going to pass

00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:25.826 A:middle
in the element that
you want to have--

00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:29.786 A:middle
actually, the model behind
what you want to have dragged.

00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:32.776 A:middle
In this example, we're dragging
an image, so we're going

00:20:32.776 --> 00:20:35.376 A:middle
to just pass in one
element array,

00:20:35.846 --> 00:20:39.686 A:middle
that's the new array syntax-,
and, pass in that image.

00:20:39.816 --> 00:20:43.806 A:middle
And then we're going
to call this bad boy.

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:49.626 A:middle
drawImage at offset event
pasteboard source slideBack.

00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:51.536 A:middle
OK. So what is all that stuff.

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:55.526 A:middle
So, first thing is the dragImage

00:20:55.606 --> 00:20:57.466 A:middle
and that's the image
underneath the mouse pointer

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:58.126 A:middle
as you're dragging.

00:20:58.626 --> 00:20:59.926 A:middle
The second thing you're going

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.176 A:middle
to pass is the location,
the start location.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:02.686 --> 00:21:05.016 A:middle
And the dragOffset
actually is ignored

00:21:05.016 --> 00:21:07.816 A:middle
so let's not talk
about that anymore.

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:12.806 A:middle
The event is the mouseDown
event that you've been passed in

00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:15.736 A:middle
or mouseDragged event
and only use this

00:21:15.736 --> 00:21:17.206 A:middle
with mouseDown and mouseDragged.

00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:19.816 A:middle
The documentation-- by the
way, if there's anything here

00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:21.956 A:middle
that I'm saying, go look
at the documentations,

00:21:21.956 --> 00:21:22.646 A:middle
it's got all the stuff.

00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:24.456 A:middle
But I'm just pointing you
in the right direction here.

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:28.196 A:middle
Pasteboard, so the pasteboard
is what you just set up there,

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:30.116 A:middle
the source is self
and then slideBack.

00:21:30.116 --> 00:21:34.006 A:middle
That's when if the user cancels
than whether it slides back

00:21:34.006 --> 00:21:35.476 A:middle
in the place, cool
animation there.

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.756 A:middle
So, that's-- you can
put yes or no there.

00:21:38.366 --> 00:21:40.526 A:middle
OK. So, now that we've
talked about the view,

00:21:41.236 --> 00:21:42.566 A:middle
let's take a look
at the controller.

00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:46.346 A:middle
Now, the controller is the part

00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:50.126 A:middle
of your Model-View-Controller
system that handles user input.

00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:54.816 A:middle
And it's going to mediate that
input and send it to commands

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:56.226 A:middle
for the Model or View to handle.

00:21:56.906 --> 00:21:59.656 A:middle
So, what do we do--
what are some tips

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:00.746 A:middle
for migrating the controller?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:04.696 A:middle
First off, this is the common
mistake, UIViewController.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.196 A:middle
There is an NSViewController

00:22:06.196 --> 00:22:07.656 A:middle
but it's probably not
what you're looking for.

00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:10.406 A:middle
You probably want to use
NSWindowController instead

00:22:10.406 --> 00:22:12.666 A:middle
which is a lot more similar
to the UIVIewController.

00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:15.276 A:middle
So, look there if you want that.

00:22:16.046 --> 00:22:19.466 A:middle
And a lot of you may be using
or I would say almost all

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:22.286 A:middle
of you are using
UINavigationControllers.

00:22:22.816 --> 00:22:25.306 A:middle
There is no such thing as
an NSNavigationController.

00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:28.116 A:middle
And the reason-- let me think
about that for a second.

00:22:28.506 --> 00:22:30.846 A:middle
UINavigationController,
what does it do?

00:22:31.286 --> 00:22:33.756 A:middle
Well, it allows you to
navigate between lots

00:22:33.756 --> 00:22:36.496 A:middle
of different TableViews that are
stacked on top of each other.

00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:37.916 A:middle
And why do we stack them
on top of each other?

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.216 A:middle
Because we have a 4-inch screen.

00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:41.626 A:middle
So, we don't really
need that on OS X.

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:44.286 A:middle
In any case, it doesn't exist
on OS X so you're going to have

00:22:44.286 --> 00:22:45.206 A:middle
to find some alternative.

00:22:45.866 --> 00:22:47.716 A:middle
But it's not the right
interaction anyway.

00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:51.896 A:middle
So, the next thing that I
will point out is Bindings.

00:22:51.896 --> 00:22:54.446 A:middle
Bindings is going to really help
you out here with controllers

00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:58.796 A:middle
because bindings is a way
on OS X that you can wire

00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:03.466 A:middle
up your user interface
without using any code inside

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:04.286 A:middle
of Interface Builder.

00:23:04.286 --> 00:23:05.016 A:middle
So that's pretty cool.

00:23:06.096 --> 00:23:10.026 A:middle
OK. Next, NSDocument,
NSDocument is amazing.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.996 A:middle
It allows you to do some really
cool stuff and it's going

00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:16.586 A:middle
to really reduce the
amount of controller code

00:23:16.586 --> 00:23:17.206 A:middle
that you have to write.

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:21.416 A:middle
And you may be thinking,
"NSDocument, that sounds like--

00:23:21.506 --> 00:23:23.096 A:middle
is that similar to UIDocument?"

00:23:23.096 --> 00:23:24.076 A:middle
Well, yes it is.

00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:27.436 A:middle
In fact, they have a
lot of similarities.

00:23:27.776 --> 00:23:30.456 A:middle
Both of them are responsible
for saving and loading,

00:23:31.506 --> 00:23:35.176 A:middle
both of them will give you undo
support very, very cheaply,

00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:38.016 A:middle
and both of them are
your tickets to iCloud.

00:23:38.526 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
So if you want to get to
iCloud, adopt UIDocument

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:44.956 A:middle
or NSDocument or both really.

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:48.636 A:middle
And-- but there's
some differences

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.396 A:middle
between NSDocument
and UIDocument.

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:53.656 A:middle
NSDocument has some extras,
some real nice things

00:23:53.656 --> 00:23:55.416 A:middle
that you should take
advantage of.

00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:58.236 A:middle
You'll get for free
really most of them.

00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:59.586 A:middle
One of them is that
you're going to get--

00:23:59.586 --> 00:24:01.806 A:middle
if you set up a document-based
app on OS X, you're going

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.236 A:middle
to get a File, Edit, and
Windows menu for free

00:24:04.666 --> 00:24:08.136 A:middle
and they're almost entirely work
without any code on your part.

00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:11.806 A:middle
You're going to get open
panels and save sheets.

00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:17.016 A:middle
And, you know, when you quit
your app and you haven't saved,

00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:18.566 A:middle
you get that little
dialogue that comes down,

00:24:18.566 --> 00:24:20.396 A:middle
that's for free, you'll
get that, unless you turn

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:22.376 A:middle
on auto save and then,
you don't really need it.

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:25.946 A:middle
But if you turn on auto
save, you get versions.

00:24:26.346 --> 00:24:30.116 A:middle
Yes, you're going to get this
cool UI, a time machine UI right

00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:34.026 A:middle
within your app, that allows
you to compare one version

00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:35.136 A:middle
of your file with another one.

00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:36.286 A:middle
So that's really cool.

00:24:36.286 --> 00:24:39.326 A:middle
And there's a really a lot
more that NSDocument can do.

00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:42.936 A:middle
So, check out the
documentation for NSDocuments.

00:24:43.926 --> 00:24:46.956 A:middle
OK. So, I'm going to
bring Dan Schimpf on stage

00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.956 A:middle
and we've been talking a lot
in abstract and he's going

00:24:48.956 --> 00:24:52.176 A:middle
to show you an iOS
app that we're going

00:24:52.176 --> 00:24:53.246 A:middle
to bring to OS X in a second.

00:24:53.376 --> 00:24:55.086 A:middle
So, take it away, Dan.

00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:57.541 A:middle
[applause]

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, good morning.

00:24:59.996 --> 00:25:02.476 A:middle
OK. I'm going to show you--
I'm first going to start off

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:06.566 A:middle
with my awesome iOS application
that I'm working on some

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:08.816 A:middle
into the store, and it's a
simple graphics application.

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:13.356 A:middle
And what we can do here is
just tap and make a few shapes.

00:25:15.646 --> 00:25:18.876 A:middle
So, I can also change
what size I want to make

00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:20.446 A:middle
or what shape I'm going to make.

00:25:20.706 --> 00:25:22.856 A:middle
I can drag-- even drag it
around and put that around top

00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:25.836 A:middle
of there, like do
three whole shapes.

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:32.776 A:middle
You can even change the
color, sure, let's do that.

00:25:33.326 --> 00:25:35.616 A:middle
So now I have a nice little
picture of a house with my--

00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:37.326 A:middle
this is what my house
looks like.

00:25:37.826 --> 00:25:40.456 A:middle
OK. So, that's just a demo.

00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:43.136 A:middle
That's my brand new application
but I'm thinking I want

00:25:43.136 --> 00:25:44.776 A:middle
to bring this application
to OS X.

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:49.316 A:middle
So, I'm going to open the
project here and let's just go

00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
through some of the code.

00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.696 A:middle
So, as you can see I've
already separated my code

00:25:53.696 --> 00:25:56.206 A:middle
out into a Model
View and Controller.

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:58.656 A:middle
So this is my document model.

00:25:58.986 --> 00:26:01.996 A:middle
Don't need to go through a whole
lot of this right now but it--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:04.066 A:middle
but the important thing
is that a lot of it--

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:06.306 A:middle
this is all things that
are cross-platform.

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:10.536 A:middle
It imports foundation, things
that are on both platforms.

00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:14.666 A:middle
And the view side, I have the
document view itself, the thing,

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:17.876 A:middle
the canvas, and then I have
the shape view which is--

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:20.166 A:middle
stand for each of
these individual shapes

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.076 A:middle
that I can drag around.

00:26:21.606 --> 00:26:22.926 A:middle
And then on the controller side,

00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:27.306 A:middle
I have a standard controller
hierarchy, an app delegate,

00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:29.196 A:middle
and then I have adopted
UIDocument because I want

00:26:29.306 --> 00:26:31.826 A:middle
to bring this to iPod and win
an Apple design award next year.

00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:35.176 A:middle
And then I've got a view
controller for the view

00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:37.286 A:middle
that I see and then
two controllers

00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:40.646 A:middle
for the things that pop up.

00:26:40.896 --> 00:26:42.256 A:middle
So, this is all pretty standard.

00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:45.386 A:middle
And now I want to start
on bringing this to OS X.

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:46.576 A:middle
So what's the first thing I do?

00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:49.906 A:middle
Well, the first thing I'm going
to do is just make a new target.

00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.486 A:middle
So I'm going to make
an OS X application,

00:26:54.026 --> 00:26:55.236 A:middle
so the Cocoa application.

00:26:56.426 --> 00:26:59.296 A:middle
I'm going to make
this shape heart OS X.

00:26:59.406 --> 00:27:00.986 A:middle
You don't have to call it--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:03.176 A:middle
if you don't have the OS X
at the end, I'm just going

00:27:03.426 --> 00:27:06.666 A:middle
to say OS X just so there's
no confusion during this demo.

00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:09.046 A:middle
And I'm also going to make a
document-based application.

00:27:11.856 --> 00:27:15.556 A:middle
So, you can see this is
made a target for me.

00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:18.796 A:middle
And also because I know this is
a heavy graphics application,

00:27:18.796 --> 00:27:20.026 A:middle
I'm also going to
add a framework.

00:27:20.026 --> 00:27:25.926 A:middle
I can search the courts
framework and it knows

00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:27.356 A:middle
that this is an OS X
target so it's going

00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:30.356 A:middle
to only give me the OS
X version of courts.

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:34.716 A:middle
OK. So now, I have
this basic app

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:38.786 A:middle
and because I've separated my
model cleanly, I can select all

00:27:38.786 --> 00:27:43.166 A:middle
of the model classes and just
simply add them into my--

00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:46.316 A:middle
excuse me, add them
to my OS X target.

00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:50.956 A:middle
Now, if I switch to my OS X
target, I can actually build

00:27:51.266 --> 00:27:53.446 A:middle
and run and see what it gets me.

00:27:53.676 --> 00:27:57.406 A:middle
So here we have-- this
is what you get for free.

00:27:57.526 --> 00:27:59.326 A:middle
You get a whole-- you have
windows, you can make--

00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:00.276 A:middle
I can make many of them,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:01.276 --> 00:28:05.396 A:middle
I got all of the menu bar
items that actually work.

00:28:05.396 --> 00:28:08.186 A:middle
And I probably don't
want to shift

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:11.706 A:middle
with my document contents there
but it's a good starting point

00:28:11.706 --> 00:28:16.026 A:middle
that you get for free and then
you can adapt it from there.

00:28:16.026 --> 00:28:18.466 A:middle
So I'm going to hand
it back to Cortis,

00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:19.616 A:middle
he's going to talk
more about that part.

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:21.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dan.

00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:23.576 A:middle
So, awesome.

00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:27.226 A:middle
So we have this app and it
does some really cool things

00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:28.406 A:middle
like your documents here.

00:28:28.786 --> 00:28:31.686 A:middle
But we don't-- we're going
to have-- where's our colors?

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:33.066 A:middle
Where's our little shapes?

00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:34.286 A:middle
So let's talk about--

00:28:34.286 --> 00:28:36.976 A:middle
we're going to talk about
some migration strategies.

00:28:37.396 --> 00:28:40.076 A:middle
They're going to help you move
over your view and controller

00:28:40.076 --> 00:28:42.246 A:middle
because we've only moved
over the model at this point.

00:28:43.026 --> 00:28:46.126 A:middle
Now keep in mind, this is kind
of a tool box of approaches.

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:47.766 A:middle
We're going to give you a
bunch of different approaches.

00:28:48.216 --> 00:28:52.056 A:middle
You know your code so you should
decide what's the right approach

00:28:52.056 --> 00:28:53.086 A:middle
for which situation.

00:28:53.276 --> 00:28:55.946 A:middle
And your apps may
use several of these.

00:28:56.836 --> 00:29:02.126 A:middle
And so to help with this, we're
going to talk about it in terms

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:03.766 A:middle
of a particular example.

00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:06.656 A:middle
In this case, we're going to
talk about it in terms of color.

00:29:07.786 --> 00:29:11.416 A:middle
Now, on iOS, you may all
be familiar with UIColor.

00:29:11.586 --> 00:29:15.456 A:middle
It's a relatively simple class,
it allows you to create colors

00:29:15.816 --> 00:29:18.136 A:middle
with red, green, blue,
and alpha, and allows you

00:29:18.136 --> 00:29:20.236 A:middle
to set them on the
current context.

00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:25.166 A:middle
Now, it turns out that there's
another class on OS X called,

00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:29.216 A:middle
surprisingly enough,
NSColor, and it allows you

00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:31.766 A:middle
to create a color with red,
green, blue, and alpha and set

00:29:31.766 --> 00:29:32.836 A:middle
in on the current context.

00:29:32.836 --> 00:29:34.496 A:middle
Now, NSColor does
some other cool things

00:29:34.496 --> 00:29:36.626 A:middle
like it will allow you to
set up seem like cake colors

00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
and patterns, color spaces.

00:29:39.056 --> 00:29:41.666 A:middle
But for now, let's just
focus on those two things.

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:48.836 A:middle
OK. So, if were overwriting
code that we're using UIColor,

00:29:48.836 --> 00:29:49.896 A:middle
I might do something like this.

00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:52.986 A:middle
UIColor redColor, that's going
to make a new color for me,

00:29:53.426 --> 00:29:56.516 A:middle
and then your color,
aColor that set.

00:29:56.846 --> 00:29:58.436 A:middle
So that's going to set
on the current context.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.176 A:middle
Pretty simple.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:04.786 A:middle
On OS X it might look like this
and the only difference here is

00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:08.696 A:middle
that we have a different class
name in place of the UIColor.

00:30:09.476 --> 00:30:12.266 A:middle
Now, this is what we're going to
call the mirrored code strategy

00:30:13.206 --> 00:30:16.766 A:middle
and for purposes of talking
about it, I don't know

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:18.586 A:middle
if it's really officially
called that

00:30:19.126 --> 00:30:20.306 A:middle
but we're going to call that.

00:30:20.306 --> 00:30:23.566 A:middle
Now, just to show you a little
bit more what that might look

00:30:23.566 --> 00:30:26.386 A:middle
like in a more complicated case,
let's look at this next one.

00:30:26.726 --> 00:30:28.036 A:middle
This is not with colors.

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:31.886 A:middle
There's a fair bit of code so
let me explain what it's doing.

00:30:31.886 --> 00:30:35.806 A:middle
It says to create a new
view, it's going to center it

00:30:35.806 --> 00:30:37.396 A:middle
on its parent view
and then it's going

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:40.516 A:middle
to insert it underneath all of
the other views on that view.

00:30:40.896 --> 00:30:43.306 A:middle
OK. So this first
bit of code is going

00:30:43.306 --> 00:30:45.596 A:middle
to compute the new
origin, the new X and Y.

00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:48.656 A:middle
And we did that with a little
bit of math and it turns

00:30:48.656 --> 00:30:51.066 A:middle
out that the math for OS
X is going to be the same.

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:53.116 A:middle
So that part of the
code is the same.

00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:55.966 A:middle
And then we're going to
create the view itself.

00:30:56.216 --> 00:31:00.396 A:middle
We'll make the frame, the
CGRect frame, and we're going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:01.786 A:middle
to create it with initWithFrame.

00:31:02.746 --> 00:31:05.526 A:middle
And if you notice, the
OS X code is very similar

00:31:05.526 --> 00:31:06.926 A:middle
but there's a couple of changes.

00:31:06.926 --> 00:31:09.456 A:middle
One is that we're using an
NSRect instead of CGRect,

00:31:10.356 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
and we also are using an NSView
instead of a UIView, so--

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.196 A:middle
but very similar at this point.

00:31:17.196 --> 00:31:18.776 A:middle
And then for this last bit,

00:31:19.136 --> 00:31:21.596 A:middle
we're going to insert it
underneath all the other views

00:31:21.726 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
on that view.

00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:25.076 A:middle
So this is subview, so
all of the other subviews.

00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:28.906 A:middle
I'm going to use
insertSubview atIndex on iOS.

00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:33.166 A:middle
On OS X, we don't actually
have that API so in that case,

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:35.246 A:middle
we're going to have
to call addSubview,

00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:36.596 A:middle
positioned, relativeTo.

00:31:37.066 --> 00:31:39.836 A:middle
And so what that does is it--
we're going to add the subview

00:31:40.656 --> 00:31:43.056 A:middle
which is the one that we just
made, and then we're going

00:31:43.056 --> 00:31:45.576 A:middle
to position it with
NSWindowBelow

00:31:45.846 --> 00:31:47.356 A:middle
and that's we below something.

00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:50.406 A:middle
And since we're passing
nil for our relativeTo,

00:31:50.406 --> 00:31:51.616 A:middle
it's going to be
below everything.

00:31:51.616 --> 00:31:53.386 A:middle
So it does the same
thing as the iOS code.

00:31:53.876 --> 00:31:56.276 A:middle
OK. So that's the
mirrored code strategy.

00:31:56.766 --> 00:31:57.896 A:middle
What are some of the benefits?

00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.346 A:middle
Well, it's going to give
us a lot of flexibility.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:02.706 A:middle
So we're going to
have things on iOS,

00:32:02.706 --> 00:32:04.856 A:middle
we're going to write our
code completely different

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:05.666 A:middle
on iOS from OS X.

00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:07.286 A:middle
In fact it can give you
something completely different.

00:32:07.326 --> 00:32:12.786 A:middle
So that's kind of cool but
it has some downsides, right?

00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:17.686 A:middle
If there's code duplication
there which means

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.786 A:middle
that whenever we want to change
something on the iOS side,

00:32:20.786 --> 00:32:23.116 A:middle
let' say add a feature
or fix a bug,

00:32:24.036 --> 00:32:26.376 A:middle
it's going to require a
change on the OS X side.

00:32:26.776 --> 00:32:29.226 A:middle
So there's greater maintenance
cost but greater testing cost.

00:32:29.226 --> 00:32:30.586 A:middle
So when do we use this strategy?

00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:31.506 A:middle
Is it ever appropriate?

00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:34.436 A:middle
The answer is yes, it is,
sometimes appropriate.

00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:37.406 A:middle
When you're using heavily
platform dependent code,

00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:39.596 A:middle
when there's stuff that's
really just very different

00:32:39.596 --> 00:32:42.006 A:middle
between the two, then this
might be the right approach.

00:32:42.336 --> 00:32:44.346 A:middle
But there are some other
approaches that we can take.

00:32:44.626 --> 00:32:47.296 A:middle
So let's take a look at those.

00:32:47.296 --> 00:32:50.876 A:middle
One thing that we can do is
that, it turns out that UIKit

00:32:51.366 --> 00:32:54.266 A:middle
and AppKit are actually built
upon a common framework.

00:32:54.826 --> 00:32:56.706 A:middle
And so, we can drop down
to that lower framework.

00:32:57.266 --> 00:33:00.406 A:middle
And it turns out that
that will give us code

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:02.656 A:middle
that is cross-platform
out of the box.

00:33:02.656 --> 00:33:03.916 A:middle
Let's look at some code.

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:06.726 A:middle
Here we're dropping down
to the Core Image framework

00:33:06.726 --> 00:33:10.706 A:middle
and it turns out that Core
Image has a CIColor there

00:33:11.896 --> 00:33:14.436 A:middle
and CIColor has a color
with red, green, blue,

00:33:14.436 --> 00:33:15.896 A:middle
alpha so we can create
a red color.

00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:19.106 A:middle
And in this case, we're
actually going to--

00:33:19.216 --> 00:33:20.586 A:middle
we're not setting on
the current context.

00:33:20.586 --> 00:33:22.296 A:middle
We're creating an image with
that color because that's one

00:33:22.296 --> 00:33:24.356 A:middle
of the things that Core
Image would want to do.

00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:27.186 A:middle
And so, that's the code
there for doing that.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:30.556 A:middle
Now, some benefits
to using this--

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.656 A:middle
since lower level
frameworks are cross-platform,

00:33:33.936 --> 00:33:38.026 A:middle
we're going to get-- we're going
to maximize our code reuse.

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:41.416 A:middle
It's very robust and there's
a lot less maintenance

00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:43.706 A:middle
because we only have one
set of code to deal with

00:33:43.706 --> 00:33:46.056 A:middle
and with the interface
is common so all

00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:48.116 A:middle
of our code calling this
is going to be the same.

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.116 A:middle
There are some downsides.

00:33:50.686 --> 00:33:53.636 A:middle
For one thing, it's going to
require that you rewrite a bunch

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:56.826 A:middle
of your code and
perhaps most importantly,

00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.776 A:middle
and I want to stress
this, you're losing a lot

00:33:58.776 --> 00:34:01.096 A:middle
of functionality by dropping
to the low level framework.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:01.096 --> 00:34:04.236 A:middle
There's a reason why
we're making NSColor

00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:06.656 A:middle
and UIColor available.

00:34:07.076 --> 00:34:09.176 A:middle
And it's not just to
like duplicate work.

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:11.985 A:middle
So, because, you know,

00:34:12.076 --> 00:34:14.315 A:middle
and CIColor doesn't
handle color spaces,

00:34:14.315 --> 00:34:16.606 A:middle
it won't do CMYK color,
it won't do patterns.

00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:18.436 A:middle
So, these are all things
that you're going to lose.

00:34:18.436 --> 00:34:19.826 A:middle
If you ever think that
you're going to need that,

00:34:19.826 --> 00:34:22.626 A:middle
then probably not
the right strategy.

00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:23.726 A:middle
So when do you use this?

00:34:24.016 --> 00:34:26.226 A:middle
It's when the lower level
framework provides the needed

00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:28.936 A:middle
functionality that you needed,
for now and in the future.

00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:31.856 A:middle
So look at it and say "Hey,
is this appropriate match?"

00:34:32.295 --> 00:34:35.255 A:middle
And if it's not, then let's
look at some other strategies.

00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:38.896 A:middle
OK. So, from software
engineering, if any of you took

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:40.746 A:middle
that in college,
you may be familiar

00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:42.005 A:middle
with the adapter pattern.

00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:45.226 A:middle
The idea here is that we
have some common source

00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:46.886 A:middle
and it's already targeting iOS.

00:34:47.956 --> 00:34:52.686 A:middle
And the code is already
written so we don't really have

00:34:52.686 --> 00:34:53.585 A:middle
to do anything on iOS.

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:57.396 A:middle
But what if we made the OS
X code work the same way?

00:34:57.396 --> 00:34:59.136 A:middle
So we could stick
an adapter in there

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
and that would give us the same
interface for iOS and OS X.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:06.446 A:middle
And let me just modify
this slightly.

00:35:06.446 --> 00:35:07.026 A:middle
We're going to stick--

00:35:07.026 --> 00:35:08.676 A:middle
we're going to make this
a little bit different.

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:11.166 A:middle
I want to make that
adapter actually

00:35:11.166 --> 00:35:12.846 A:middle
across both iOS and OS X?

00:35:12.846 --> 00:35:15.586 A:middle
So if we do this, it will take
a little bit of extra code

00:35:15.586 --> 00:35:19.516 A:middle
but it means that our iOS
code-- sorry, the iOS framework

00:35:19.516 --> 00:35:23.606 A:middle
and the OS X framework can
change and it doesn't matter

00:35:23.606 --> 00:35:26.766 A:middle
because our code, our adapter
code can stay the same.

00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:29.316 A:middle
And so, the code that's calling
it doesn't need to change.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:33.596 A:middle
And so, we can just
change the implementation.

00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:35.506 A:middle
So that's actually
a nice approach.

00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:38.126 A:middle
And it would look
like this in code.

00:35:38.746 --> 00:35:40.966 A:middle
Perhaps, this is
a very simplified,

00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:42.356 A:middle
just the header file
version of it

00:35:42.686 --> 00:35:45.476 A:middle
and without all the interfaces

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:47.896 A:middle
that you would need
for various things.

00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:48.896 A:middle
But this gives you an idea.

00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:52.856 A:middle
We created class
called XPlatformColor

00:35:53.336 --> 00:35:56.236 A:middle
and we'd base it off of
NSObject, and underneath

00:35:56.236 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
that class, we'll place a
UIColor as the underlying color.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:04.406 A:middle
And so, whenever we need to
do something on the color,

00:36:04.406 --> 00:36:07.486 A:middle
we'd actually call through
to iOS to do that for us

00:36:07.486 --> 00:36:10.936 A:middle
so we wouldn't have to
duplicate that code.

00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:13.146 A:middle
And on OS X, we could put
this in a separate file.

00:36:13.146 --> 00:36:14.666 A:middle
In this case, we're
putting it in on one slide

00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:16.186 A:middle
so we use the condition--

00:36:16.186 --> 00:36:20.266 A:middle
the cross-platform macros
that we talked about earlier.

00:36:20.816 --> 00:36:24.466 A:middle
But in this case, we're
going to base XPlatformColor

00:36:24.466 --> 00:36:26.166 A:middle
on the underlying
color of NSColor.

00:36:26.886 --> 00:36:28.846 A:middle
So that's what that
would look like.

00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:30.246 A:middle
So what are the benefits
of that?

00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:31.316 A:middle
And so you're going to have to--

00:36:31.316 --> 00:36:35.076 A:middle
by the way, this is doing
some hand waving on the rest

00:36:35.076 --> 00:36:37.586 A:middle
of the interface because you're
going to have things like color

00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:39.766 A:middle
with red, green, blue, alpha
perhaps, or a red color

00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:41.646 A:middle
or whatever you want to
have as your interface.

00:36:41.646 --> 00:36:42.386 A:middle
You can choose, right?

00:36:42.386 --> 00:36:43.786 A:middle
This is your class
that you're making.

00:36:44.366 --> 00:36:46.186 A:middle
So what are the benefits
of that?

00:36:46.186 --> 00:36:48.086 A:middle
Well, one thing, you're
going to be flexible again,

00:36:48.776 --> 00:36:50.446 A:middle
a lot more flexible
than mirrored code.

00:36:50.446 --> 00:36:53.326 A:middle
You're going to maximize
your code reuse.

00:36:53.326 --> 00:36:56.396 A:middle
This is a lot more reuse
than mirrored code.

00:36:57.316 --> 00:36:57.816 A:middle
Why is that?

00:36:57.816 --> 00:36:59.126 A:middle
Because your interface
is the same.

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:00.996 A:middle
So any place that you need
to color, you're going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:00.996 --> 00:37:01.956 A:middle
to call XPlatformColor.

00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:04.516 A:middle
And all of your platform
specific stuff is hidden

00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:07.016 A:middle
underneath an implementation
of the XPlatformColor code.

00:37:07.096 --> 00:37:08.136 A:middle
So that's nice.

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:10.646 A:middle
It's a simplified interface
because you're making it.

00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:12.806 A:middle
It's tailor-made for
you, so that's great.

00:37:12.806 --> 00:37:16.596 A:middle
And it requires less maintenance
because, again, you're--

00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:19.656 A:middle
you have a common interface and
unlike mirrored code where you,

00:37:19.656 --> 00:37:22.146 A:middle
you know, you want to change
something, you had to change

00:37:22.146 --> 00:37:23.466 A:middle
in all different places.

00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:24.636 A:middle
So that's great.

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:27.516 A:middle
The downsides are, it
has some downsides,

00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:30.026 A:middle
it's a lot of additional
code that you got to write.

00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:36.106 A:middle
So-- and so, there's going to
be another strategy we can talk

00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:38.346 A:middle
about next that has a little
bit less code, so, anyway.

00:37:38.576 --> 00:37:39.436 A:middle
When do you use this?

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:42.106 A:middle
Well, you use this
when you're dealing

00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:45.416 A:middle
with an underlying API that's
significantly different

00:37:46.196 --> 00:37:47.516 A:middle
between iOS and OS X.

00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:49.016 A:middle
And this is a great
pattern for that.

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.806 A:middle
OK. So, this is a
great strategy.

00:37:50.806 --> 00:37:52.346 A:middle
What about another strategy?

00:37:52.346 --> 00:37:55.896 A:middle
OK. So here's one that we can
take advantage of in some cases

00:37:55.896 --> 00:37:59.336 A:middle
and that is the adapter
pattern using #define.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:02.576 A:middle
Now, #define is the
pre-processor macro

00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:05.676 A:middle
that in this case is, what
we're going to do is we're going

00:38:05.676 --> 00:38:08.926 A:middle
to substitute every occurrence
of XPlatformColor with UIColor.

00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:11.086 A:middle
And we're doing that before
the compiler ever gets to it.

00:38:11.386 --> 00:38:14.726 A:middle
So this happens before
compile time and that's going

00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:16.906 A:middle
to have some cool
advantages for that.

00:38:16.906 --> 00:38:20.096 A:middle
And for OS X, we would
substitute that with NSColor.

00:38:20.096 --> 00:38:22.316 A:middle
So every time we
see XPlatformColor,

00:38:22.316 --> 00:38:23.666 A:middle
it's an automatically
insert that.

00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:28.576 A:middle
Now, what does that do for us
and what is it not do to us?

00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:29.366 A:middle
There's a couple of things.

00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:32.406 A:middle
For one thing, there's
almost no new code to write.

00:38:32.406 --> 00:38:33.616 A:middle
You saw it there, that's it.

00:38:34.156 --> 00:38:36.216 A:middle
OK. So, that's nice.

00:38:36.516 --> 00:38:38.586 A:middle
It's going to give you
compile time air checking.

00:38:38.586 --> 00:38:42.006 A:middle
So because it's doing it before
the compiler ever gets to it,

00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:45.546 A:middle
it will tell you if you're using
it wrong, the compiler will.

00:38:45.946 --> 00:38:48.846 A:middle
So if you're using a selector
that's not appropriate,

00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:50.126 A:middle
it's going to tell you that.

00:38:50.546 --> 00:38:56.166 A:middle
Now, there's some downsides
and the first one is key.

00:38:56.276 --> 00:38:57.266 A:middle
Everyone pay attention.

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:59.546 A:middle
This is only for
supported classes.

00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:00.766 A:middle
Let me say that again.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.766 --> 00:39:02.446 A:middle
Only for supported classes.

00:39:02.446 --> 00:39:03.496 A:middle
So what are those classes?

00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:11.136 A:middle
UIColor and NSColor, UIFont and
NSFont, UIImage and NSImage,

00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:14.086 A:middle
and UIBezierPath
and NSBezierPath.

00:39:14.086 --> 00:39:17.806 A:middle
If you have a class that is
not in this set of four pairs

00:39:18.376 --> 00:39:20.736 A:middle
and you want to use the
strategy, please don't.

00:39:22.856 --> 00:39:24.616 A:middle
You will have undefined results.

00:39:24.706 --> 00:39:28.196 A:middle
So-- and the other thing to
keep in mind is that even

00:39:28.196 --> 00:39:31.116 A:middle
for these classes, it's
got limited API coverage.

00:39:31.116 --> 00:39:33.186 A:middle
So just because we're doing
this #define it doesn't mean

00:39:33.186 --> 00:39:35.646 A:middle
that we magically
get CMYK on UIColor.

00:39:35.986 --> 00:39:37.446 A:middle
We don't. It doesn't
happen that way.

00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:41.336 A:middle
So-- but the compiler
will warn you if you try

00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:42.516 A:middle
to use it so, that's good.

00:39:42.516 --> 00:39:46.336 A:middle
It will say, "Hey,
you-- this is an error."

00:39:46.336 --> 00:39:46.866 A:middle
So, anyway.

00:39:46.866 --> 00:39:50.366 A:middle
The other thing to
keep in mind is that,

00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:53.676 A:middle
if you're doing cross-platform
work which you obviously are

00:39:53.676 --> 00:39:55.606 A:middle
because you're in this talk
and that's what this is about,

00:39:56.086 --> 00:39:58.916 A:middle
and you're doing
archiving of your things,

00:39:58.916 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
it's going to require
some custom archiving.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:01.046 --> 00:40:03.326 A:middle
because if you archive,
what ultimately ends

00:40:03.326 --> 00:40:05.066 A:middle
up being a UIColor
and you try to bring

00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:08.276 A:middle
that into OS X using
iCloud, that is going to say,

00:40:08.276 --> 00:40:10.836 A:middle
"I don't know UIColor is,"
and it's going to barf on you.

00:40:10.836 --> 00:40:12.176 A:middle
So, you're going to have

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:14.146 A:middle
to write some custom
archiving code for that.

00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:15.066 A:middle
And that's pretty easy.

00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:16.996 A:middle
What you just want to do is
you want to save it in the way

00:40:16.996 --> 00:40:18.566 A:middle
that both platforms
can recognize.

00:40:19.056 --> 00:40:23.256 A:middle
So, migration testing
is my next slide.

00:40:23.766 --> 00:40:26.486 A:middle
And one thing to keep in mind
is all of the stuff means

00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:28.456 A:middle
that if you're code
compiles, it doesn't mean--

00:40:28.456 --> 00:40:29.536 A:middle
necessarily mean it's correct.

00:40:30.006 --> 00:40:30.996 A:middle
So please test.

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.356 A:middle
Unit tests are good,
very, very good.

00:40:34.356 --> 00:40:35.076 A:middle
You should use them.

00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:39.056 A:middle
Xcode has some cool things in
it, Xcode 5 for doing that.

00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:41.686 A:middle
Manual testing is important too
because there are some things

00:40:41.686 --> 00:40:43.346 A:middle
that you probably can't
cover in a unit test.

00:40:43.596 --> 00:40:45.086 A:middle
Don't forget to send
it to your users.

00:40:45.086 --> 00:40:47.356 A:middle
They have different system
configurations and they're going

00:40:47.356 --> 00:40:48.826 A:middle
to use the software
differently than you.

00:40:49.256 --> 00:40:50.576 A:middle
So, do beta testing.

00:40:50.576 --> 00:40:54.526 A:middle
That's why there's reason why
we have the provisioning profile

00:40:54.526 --> 00:40:56.176 A:middle
so you can send out your
apps to those people.

00:40:57.206 --> 00:41:01.076 A:middle
And testing plans, you know,
if you have a testing plan,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:01.346 --> 00:41:03.236 A:middle
then it means that every
single time that you come

00:41:03.236 --> 00:41:05.226 A:middle
out with a release and
you follow that plan,

00:41:05.226 --> 00:41:08.946 A:middle
it's going to mean that your
software is a lot more--

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:10.796 A:middle
well, at least it's
tested, right?

00:41:11.196 --> 00:41:17.346 A:middle
Now, I stress this because the
number one reason why apps get

00:41:17.346 --> 00:41:19.996 A:middle
rejected from the app
store at least initially is

00:41:19.996 --> 00:41:22.406 A:middle
because they crash
during the review process.

00:41:22.406 --> 00:41:24.826 A:middle
So you don't want your app to be
one of those because it's going

00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:26.366 A:middle
to take more time
to get it reviewed.

00:41:26.366 --> 00:41:29.276 A:middle
And that's actually good
news because if it crashes

00:41:29.276 --> 00:41:30.826 A:middle
for the reviewers
then it's not going

00:41:30.826 --> 00:41:32.576 A:middle
to be crashing for your users.

00:41:32.576 --> 00:41:34.756 A:middle
That may even worse if it
didn't-- so do your testing.

00:41:35.376 --> 00:41:38.296 A:middle
Anyway, I'm going to bring Dan
back on stage and he's going

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:39.686 A:middle
to show you how we've
implemented some

00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:42.936 A:middle
of these strategies to
bring the iOS app to OS X.

00:41:42.936 --> 00:41:43.356 A:middle
Thanks Dan.

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:47.646 A:middle
[applause]

00:41:48.146 --> 00:41:48.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cortis.

00:41:49.336 --> 00:41:51.506 A:middle
I've been hard at work while
Cortis has been talking

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:55.276 A:middle
and now I have a new final
copy of my application.

00:41:55.976 --> 00:41:57.876 A:middle
So here we are, this
is an untitled document

00:41:58.306 --> 00:42:00.536 A:middle
and you see instead of
the toolbar at the bottom,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.536 --> 00:42:03.106 A:middle
I have a toolbar on the
top that has selectors

00:42:03.106 --> 00:42:05.916 A:middle
for the different shapes and
the Stroke and Fill colors.

00:42:06.126 --> 00:42:07.446 A:middle
So-- but the same
things applies.

00:42:07.446 --> 00:42:09.536 A:middle
I click, I can create things.

00:42:09.996 --> 00:42:13.556 A:middle
I can even create a new
document and I can even--

00:42:13.556 --> 00:42:15.906 A:middle
I can use that to make the
same shape that I did before.

00:42:16.386 --> 00:42:18.006 A:middle
I can drag it.

00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:22.366 A:middle
All right, two documents here.

00:42:22.586 --> 00:42:24.206 A:middle
And I can change my Fill color.

00:42:24.206 --> 00:42:28.146 A:middle
Let's do, I'm going to make the
same [inaudible], a nice purple,

00:42:28.336 --> 00:42:29.206 A:middle
it could be different planet.

00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:31.776 A:middle
OK. So then here we have
[laughter] roughly the same

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:33.686 A:middle
document here.

00:42:33.686 --> 00:42:39.036 A:middle
And I can give this a name, see,

00:42:39.576 --> 00:42:44.416 A:middle
"My House," saved
on the desktop.

00:42:44.606 --> 00:42:46.876 A:middle
So let's say-- OK
and I saved it.

00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:49.416 A:middle
I have made some other
changes by mistake.

00:42:49.836 --> 00:42:51.076 A:middle
Let's say-- oh, and
now I kind of want

00:42:51.076 --> 00:42:54.676 A:middle
to see what, versions
in the past.

00:42:54.676 --> 00:42:58.626 A:middle
So I can use Browser Versions
and then this is entirely

00:42:58.626 --> 00:43:00.966 A:middle
for free just by do-- but
by dotting in this document.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:04.256 A:middle
And I can go-- oh, this is
the one I actually wanted us

00:43:04.256 --> 00:43:04.696 A:middle
to save.

00:43:05.376 --> 00:43:09.356 A:middle
Now, this is-- that's
how it works.

00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:13.306 A:middle
OK. So let's go back
and look at the code.

00:43:13.306 --> 00:43:17.386 A:middle
OK. So, I've re-organized
my code a bit.

00:43:17.816 --> 00:43:19.876 A:middle
I have-- I've broken
all the common code out

00:43:19.876 --> 00:43:22.666 A:middle
and take the common source
and I have as different spots

00:43:22.706 --> 00:43:24.096 A:middle
for iOS and the macro source.

00:43:24.816 --> 00:43:27.196 A:middle
So in my common source,
we have all the model bits

00:43:27.646 --> 00:43:28.196 A:middle
and I was [inaudible].

00:43:28.196 --> 00:43:30.086 A:middle
We had already done some--

00:43:30.086 --> 00:43:31.926 A:middle
a little bit of work
that like of--

00:43:31.926 --> 00:43:33.926 A:middle
well of course, I was talking
about what the platform color.

00:43:33.926 --> 00:43:38.246 A:middle
So here we have our platform
color and I can show you,

00:43:38.246 --> 00:43:39.466 A:middle
let's see, well, on a shape.

00:43:42.536 --> 00:43:43.706 A:middle
The shape has all these things.

00:43:43.706 --> 00:43:45.996 A:middle
It also has a Fill
Color and a Stroke Color

00:43:45.996 --> 00:43:47.826 A:middle
and it's using this
platform color.

00:43:48.846 --> 00:43:51.766 A:middle
And again, like what
Cortis is talking about,

00:43:52.126 --> 00:43:52.926 A:middle
let's see, let's go down.

00:43:52.926 --> 00:43:54.406 A:middle
This is about-- this
my archiving code.

00:43:54.406 --> 00:43:56.896 A:middle
This is when I-- how I
init in from the archive.

00:43:57.336 --> 00:43:59.736 A:middle
Let's hide this to
easier to see.

00:43:59.736 --> 00:44:03.796 A:middle
So you can see, I'm
using-- when I encode it,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:04.556 --> 00:44:07.796 A:middle
I'm actually using a CIColor
to archive it to a file

00:44:07.796 --> 00:44:10.126 A:middle
because that's something
that exist on both platforms.

00:44:10.336 --> 00:44:14.966 A:middle
So that's something I can use
to make a consistent archive

00:44:14.966 --> 00:44:17.066 A:middle
so I can open the same
document on both sides.

00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:21.246 A:middle
So if the models are the same,

00:44:21.246 --> 00:44:23.146 A:middle
what is the controller
level look like?

00:44:23.336 --> 00:44:25.106 A:middle
So on the view side,
it looks very similar.

00:44:25.106 --> 00:44:27.986 A:middle
I've got a Document
View that respond--

00:44:27.986 --> 00:44:29.156 A:middle
that corresponds to the canvas.

00:44:29.676 --> 00:44:31.776 A:middle
I've got a Shape View that
corresponds to each shape

00:44:32.046 --> 00:44:34.536 A:middle
and these are both
subclasses of NSView.

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:39.766 A:middle
And then on the controller
side, I've got a single document

00:44:39.766 --> 00:44:40.636 A:middle
because there's some--

00:44:40.906 --> 00:44:43.556 A:middle
the document can serve as the
controller for the whole thing

00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:45.456 A:middle
because there are not other
screens that could show up.

00:44:46.476 --> 00:44:50.976 A:middle
And the document really
only has support for--

00:44:51.086 --> 00:44:54.936 A:middle
really only need to do things
like it has some undo support.

00:44:54.936 --> 00:45:00.736 A:middle
And then it does-- this
is the data, same code.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:00.736 --> 00:45:03.386 A:middle
So this takes the archiving
and then it reads it.

00:45:04.146 --> 00:45:06.956 A:middle
So I can build this and
I'm back to my same data

00:45:07.126 --> 00:45:11.236 A:middle
and I should mention that I
can also do keyboard shortcuts.

00:45:11.236 --> 00:45:14.686 A:middle
So if I can do Command-Z,
see the Edit Menu Flash

00:45:14.686 --> 00:45:16.186 A:middle
and those shapes go away.

00:45:16.186 --> 00:45:18.486 A:middle
I can also go back
up here, do the redo.

00:45:18.486 --> 00:45:19.736 A:middle
This is all again for free just

00:45:19.736 --> 00:45:21.606 A:middle
by using NSUndoManager,
my model.

00:45:22.396 --> 00:45:24.086 A:middle
And I can use keyboard
equivalence.

00:45:24.186 --> 00:45:25.786 A:middle
These are custom
things that I set up.

00:45:25.786 --> 00:45:28.686 A:middle
I can use keyboard
equivalence to change the shape.

00:45:28.816 --> 00:45:31.086 A:middle
And these are things that
our users are going to expect

00:45:31.086 --> 00:45:32.126 A:middle
when they come to
your application.

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:35.586 A:middle
So I'm going to hand it back
over to Cortis to finish up.

00:45:35.996 --> 00:45:36.266 A:middle
Thank you.

00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:38.411 A:middle
[applause]

00:45:38.556 --> 00:45:39.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Dan.

00:45:39.216 --> 00:45:40.386 A:middle
That is some amazing work.

00:45:40.966 --> 00:45:42.766 A:middle
He's a fast coder isn't he?

00:45:42.766 --> 00:45:46.906 A:middle
OK. So, like I said before,
there's three things I'd

00:45:46.906 --> 00:45:49.136 A:middle
like you to take home today.

00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:52.726 A:middle
Number one is I want you
to rethink your iOS apps

00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:55.256 A:middle
in terms of OS X apps, OK?

00:45:55.426 --> 00:45:57.116 A:middle
So there are some changes that
you'll need to make there.

00:45:57.326 --> 00:45:59.806 A:middle
Number two, restructure
your code

00:45:59.806 --> 00:46:02.366 A:middle
so that your model is cleanly
separated from your view

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:02.366 --> 00:46:03.066 A:middle
and you're controller.

00:46:03.066 --> 00:46:04.746 A:middle
That way, you'll be
able to take advantage

00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:07.736 A:middle
of the maximum code
reuse possible.

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:10.326 A:middle
And three, just get started.

00:46:10.526 --> 00:46:12.356 A:middle
You know, your customers
are going to love it

00:46:12.356 --> 00:46:14.346 A:middle
that you have an
OS X app especially

00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:16.806 A:middle
if you integrate your iOS
and OS X app experience.

00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:17.636 A:middle
So that's going to be great.

00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:19.256 A:middle
If you want more information,

00:46:19.256 --> 00:46:21.366 A:middle
please take contact
Jake Behrens.

00:46:21.786 --> 00:46:22.416 A:middle
He's awesome.

00:46:22.416 --> 00:46:24.736 A:middle
He will answer your
emails maybe.

00:46:25.226 --> 00:46:25.726 A:middle
I think he will.

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:27.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; He will.

00:46:27.716 --> 00:46:28.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; He will, he says.

00:46:28.806 --> 00:46:33.376 A:middle
OK. Documentation, go
to AppKit documentation

00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:36.006 A:middle
at developer.apple.com/mac.

00:46:36.256 --> 00:46:39.646 A:middle
For the User Interface
Guidelines, this is important

00:46:39.646 --> 00:46:41.786 A:middle
because this is going to show
you how to make a great Mac app.

00:46:42.126 --> 00:46:43.606 A:middle
So go to that one.

00:46:43.606 --> 00:46:45.856 A:middle
That's developer.apple.com/ue.

00:46:46.256 --> 00:46:48.946 A:middle
The Developer Forums, a great
place to talk to developers.

00:46:49.736 --> 00:46:51.106 A:middle
We've got real developers there.

00:46:51.176 --> 00:46:55.026 A:middle
We haven't put Siri to work yet
there but real Apple developers.

00:46:56.656 --> 00:46:58.676 A:middle
Some great talks to look at.

00:46:58.946 --> 00:47:01.916 A:middle
So we have taken control
of Auto Layout in Xcode 5.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:02.316 --> 00:47:03.516 A:middle
If you want to know
how to do X--

00:47:03.516 --> 00:47:05.346 A:middle
Auto Layout, that's
a great one to go to.

00:47:05.346 --> 00:47:07.636 A:middle
There are lots of also
talks from previous years

00:47:07.636 --> 00:47:08.886 A:middle
that you're going to have access

00:47:08.916 --> 00:47:11.916 A:middle
to on your WWDC app
for Auto Layout.

00:47:12.096 --> 00:47:14.346 A:middle
Introduction to SpriteKit, I
made a plug for it earlier.

00:47:14.346 --> 00:47:16.256 A:middle
That's going to be great
if you're doing any kind

00:47:16.256 --> 00:47:18.156 A:middle
of cross-platform 2D Game.

00:47:18.876 --> 00:47:21.246 A:middle
Best practices for Cocoa
Animation, that's a great place

00:47:21.246 --> 00:47:23.376 A:middle
to go to for information
on NSStackView

00:47:23.766 --> 00:47:27.496 A:middle
for core animation
changes and for things

00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:28.916 A:middle
about auto layout as well.

00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:29.656 A:middle
And we'll give you a few--

00:47:29.836 --> 00:47:31.316 A:middle
things about animation
and auto layout.

00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:33.126 A:middle
And then Introducing TextKit,
and then we haven't talked

00:47:33.126 --> 00:47:34.726 A:middle
about that at all
in this session

00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:37.026 A:middle
but if you've attended some
of the earlier sessions,

00:47:37.026 --> 00:47:38.316 A:middle
you'll probably be
quite pleased.

00:47:38.316 --> 00:47:39.386 A:middle
But we didn't really
talk about that

00:47:39.386 --> 00:47:41.996 A:middle
but the TextKit is
actually implemented

00:47:41.996 --> 00:47:46.256 A:middle
on the same fundamentals
as the OS X Cocoa Text.

00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:52.096 A:middle
So, all of the things that you
can do is Cocoa Text or sorry,

00:47:52.096 --> 00:47:54.866 A:middle
in TextKit that you've
learned about, you can also do

00:47:54.866 --> 00:47:56.596 A:middle
in Cocoa Text and your code
is going to be the same.

00:47:56.596 --> 00:47:59.606 A:middle
So, your NSLayout Managers
and your NSText Storage,

00:47:59.606 --> 00:48:01.126 A:middle
all of that is on OS X

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:01.236 --> 00:48:02.816 A:middle
and you're code can
be largely the same.

00:48:03.246 --> 00:48:03.996 A:middle
Thank for coming.

00:48:03.996 --> 00:48:05.236 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of your show.

00:48:05.626 --> 00:48:07.626 A:middle
[Applause]

00:48:08.016 --> 00:48:13.026 A:middle
