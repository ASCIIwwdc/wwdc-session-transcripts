&gt;&gt; Howard Miller: Okay welcome

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:16.085 A:middle
to the WWDC 2013
AirPrint Session.

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:16.936 A:middle
I'm Howard Miller.

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:19.206 A:middle
I manage everything
that's related to AirPrint.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.006 A:middle
How many people here
are iOS developers?

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:23.346 A:middle
Show of hands, alright.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:25.136 A:middle
How many of your
apps already print?

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.746 A:middle
A few of you, okay.

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:30.246 A:middle
If they don't print, by
the time you leave today,

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.776 A:middle
your app should be printing via
what we tell you here or the lab

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.306 A:middle
that immediately follows this.

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:39.006 A:middle
Today's agenda, I'm going
to talk about AirPrint,

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.206 A:middle
the success that we've had
in AirPrint and the market.

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:43.126 A:middle
We're going to focus
a little bit

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.356 A:middle
on AirPrint in the Enterprise.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.916 A:middle
We've got a lot of new printers
that have come to market

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:51.536 A:middle
that I think will solve a
lot of enterprise issues.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:53.336 A:middle
And then we're going
to spend the majority

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:57.896 A:middle
of today's session helping you
and your app be able to print.

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:01.056 A:middle
So let's start with the
printing architecture.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:02.796 A:middle
Apple has a long tradition.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.736 A:middle
We invented desktop
publishing back in the 80's

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:07.636 A:middle
with the Introduction
to PostScript,

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:10.396 A:middle
the original LaserWriter,
partnership with Adobe.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.746 A:middle
With Mac OS X we brought

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.356 A:middle
in a full featured rich printing
system, two sets of API's,

00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:18.736 A:middle
high level API's for
your applications,

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:20.936 A:middle
some low level cups API's.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:24.176 A:middle
We've built in the most robust
printing system in the world,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:25.876 A:middle
the common Unix Printing System.

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:28.726 A:middle
And as you know there's a
myriad of printer drivers

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:31.646 A:middle
that are available to talk to
tens of thousands of printers.

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:37.006 A:middle
We adapted this system to
eliminate the need for drivers.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.616 A:middle
We built a new printing
standard,

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:43.236 A:middle
which we call AirPrint,
which well,

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.696 A:middle
you know marketing
called it AirPrint.

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:48.556 A:middle
It does work on wireless but
it also works on Ethernet

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
and starting next year it
will work on USB as well.

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:56.926 A:middle
This provided a very rich and
complete printing system though

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.336 A:middle
because of its history may
be a little bit complicated

00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:00.946 A:middle
for application developers.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:07.856 A:middle
So what we have done is for
iOS we've brought over the best

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:13.126 A:middle
of the printing system, we've
put a thin layer of API's

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:16.226 A:middle
that get to the essence of
what your app needs to do

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:17.696 A:middle
to print and to print well.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:22.196 A:middle
So with a minimum amount of
code, maybe 10 lines of code

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:25.756 A:middle
if you already have predefined
content such as PDF or JPEG,

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:30.006 A:middle
you can get desktop quality
output from your application.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:33.396 A:middle
Okay if you want to do a little
bit more we still have the full

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.226 A:middle
richness and powerful
printing system underlying you

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:40.066 A:middle
and you can get desktop
quality output and all the level

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:41.396 A:middle
of control that you would expect

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:44.226 A:middle
from your application
using the AirPrint API's.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.536 A:middle
So let's talk a little
bit about the technology.

00:02:47.536 --> 00:02:51.546 A:middle
When we came to iOS the goal
was pretty straight forward,

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:55.326 A:middle
what is the best that
we can do for the user?

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:59.586 A:middle
Printing has been a pain, it's
been a pain since the dawn

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:02.116 A:middle
of time when they were
carving them on stone tablets

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:03.316 A:middle
and putting them in pyramids.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.156 A:middle
Printing is hard and it
doesn't have to be hard.

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:09.846 A:middle
So our goal is to have
the best quality output

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:13.236 A:middle
with the least amount of
friction for the end user.

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:16.466 A:middle
And to that end we've
completely eliminated drivers,

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:21.026 A:middle
no software to install, there's
no setup, there's no settings,

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:24.786 A:middle
there's no tweaking,
the right thing happens.

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.836 A:middle
You get full quality
output and now

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:28.986 A:middle
for you application
developers we ask you

00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:30.166 A:middle
to be a partner in this.

00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:32.896 A:middle
So for example, if your
app is a photo app,

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:37.206 A:middle
when you print your photo, it's
nice, that's sort of required,

00:03:37.206 --> 00:03:39.666 A:middle
that you tell the printing
system, yes it is my intent

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:41.256 A:middle
to be printing a color photo.

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:45.366 A:middle
That will let us optimize the
printing path and the settings

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:48.846 A:middle
in the printer so the user will
get the full quality output,

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
full bleed, edge to edge,
correctly matched with color,

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:55.466 A:middle
pulled from the right tray
without having to pick anything.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:00.466 A:middle
AirPrint was released
in iOS 4.2 so iOS 4.2

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:01.646 A:middle
and later will support that.

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:08.696 A:middle
It's also on OS X starting in
10.7, became our default in 10.8

00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:10.456 A:middle
and continues in Mavericks.

00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:14.006 A:middle
If a customer comes across an
AirPrint printer it will just

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.745 A:middle
appear in their print
dialogue on either platform,

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.086 A:middle
they pick it and they print.

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:20.116 A:middle
It's all standards based.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:23.366 A:middle
Of course we put some Apple
secret sauce on top of that.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:27.236 A:middle
But yet everything that we've
done is available under license

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:30.026 A:middle
at no cost to all
printer manufactures

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:32.716 A:middle
and starting last year
server manufacturers.

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.496 A:middle
So we have a few
printer manufacturers

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.076 A:middle
that have adopted AirPrint.

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:41.306 A:middle
Just this week you saw
announcements from Xerox

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:45.006 A:middle
and Kyocera, both
bringing midsize business

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:48.076 A:middle
and enterprise class printers
to market with AirPrint in them.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:51.186 A:middle
You'll notice all of your
favorite vendors probably are

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.066 A:middle
on this slide.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.886 A:middle
We have a list of licensees,
some of which I will talk

00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:58.196 A:middle
about as we go through
today's presentation.

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:01.806 A:middle
This list of licensees that
I show you have printers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.816 A:middle
that have AirPrint
and are currently

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:05.636 A:middle
with Apple under certification.

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:11.256 A:middle
If you want to know is your
printer an AirPrint printer,

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:13.966 A:middle
we have this AirPrint basics
knowledge base article

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.276 A:middle
which turned out to become one

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:18.546 A:middle
of the 10 most popular
knowledge base articles

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
in Apple's history, this
has the definitive list.

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:25.146 A:middle
For a printer to be on this
list, first the vendor has

00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:27.326 A:middle
to have a license,
second they have

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.166 A:middle
to have provided working
functional prototypes to Apple

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:32.506 A:middle
when we run a complete
certification sweep.

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:35.726 A:middle
So this is a pretty good
definitive source if you want

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:36.766 A:middle
to find out what's there.

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:43.976 A:middle
So new printers for 2013
so we're going to start

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.476 A:middle
with a couple of my favorites.

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.896 A:middle
Roll fed printers,
there's a myriad

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.896 A:middle
of roll fed printers
in the industry.

00:05:49.896 --> 00:05:50.966 A:middle
You see them everywhere.

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:52.776 A:middle
We have, and we'll
demonstrate it later,

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
this is a Brother
Label Roll fed printer.

00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:57.656 A:middle
It will come to market
later this year.

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:00.266 A:middle
Actually it's a firmware
update for an existing printer.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.786 --> 00:06:02.086 A:middle
Awesome printer and we're going

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:03.886 A:middle
to demo it live with
some demo code.

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
I hold in my hand this which
is an iPhone 5 panorama.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.956 A:middle
This was taken recently
and this has been printed

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:17.096 A:middle
on a printer from ZINK.

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:20.416 A:middle
For those who know ZINK,
ZINK stands for zero ink.

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:24.276 A:middle
Their patented technology lets
the customer just buy paper

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:26.356 A:middle
and always have ink available.

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:29.666 A:middle
This roll fed is 2
inches by 9 inches.

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:32.136 A:middle
It's a beautiful
California scene.

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:39.426 A:middle
And for those in the
back who can't see it,

00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:42.666 A:middle
we have a slightly
larger version.

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:46.686 A:middle
This one is 160 some
odd inches by 36 inches.

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:49.476 A:middle
This has been printed
using AirPrint off

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:52.796 A:middle
of shipping HP Designjet T520.

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:56.136 A:middle
That roll fed printer came out
earlier this year with AirPrint

00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:59.606 A:middle
and HP's bringing AirPrint to
many other Designjet printers.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
Okay thank you guys.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:08.636 A:middle
I mentioned the enterprise
class, laser printers,

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:10.476 A:middle
one of the preeminent printers

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:13.016 A:middle
in the enterprise
space has been Lexmark.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.186 A:middle
Lexmark makes a wide
array of laser printers.

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:20.856 A:middle
Every printer sold by
Lexmark is AirPrint certified,

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:22.216 A:middle
AirPrint enabled today.

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:24.666 A:middle
They also have enterprise
classes on some

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:28.066 A:middle
of their printers where you set
your printer up in your shop,

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.386 A:middle
you connect it to your
active directory server,

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:33.766 A:middle
that printer will
then present itself

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:39.636 A:middle
to iOS users supporting
users in groups, IPPS,

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:43.226 A:middle
using TLS for security so
encrypted data channels.

00:07:43.556 --> 00:07:45.846 A:middle
You get all the functionality,
all the capability

00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:48.096 A:middle
and all the security
that you would expect

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:50.106 A:middle
in an enterprise class printer.

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:52.436 A:middle
So those are available
from Lexmark.

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:56.946 A:middle
Many of the other vendors, HP,
the Ricoh and the Ricoh family,

00:07:56.946 --> 00:07:59.916 A:middle
I mentioned Kyocera and Xerox,
there's a lot of printers made

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:01.646 A:middle
for the Enterprise class.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:03.866 A:middle
Label printers, I
mentioned Brother already,

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.236 A:middle
Dye Sub printers, again I
don't have big ones of these

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:11.896 A:middle
so you won't be able to
see them in the back,

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:16.606 A:middle
but these printers are off of a
Cannon Selphy Dye-sub Printer,

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:19.386 A:middle
also in certification and
will also be available later

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:19.906 A:middle
this year.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:23.166 A:middle
I think this will be the must
have Christmas peripheral

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.036 A:middle
because straight
from your iPhone

00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:29.276 A:middle
with two clicks you
get production quality,

00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:33.145 A:middle
color photos, there's tabs on
it so it comes out borderless,

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.395 A:middle
right from your iPhone.

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:40.496 A:middle
And then we will see later
this year our first round

00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:42.296 A:middle
of certified servers.

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.576 A:middle
Yes, these will be the first
AirPrint certified servers

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:46.146 A:middle
in the world.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:49.826 A:middle
The first one we expect will
probably be from Lexmark.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.026 A:middle
They're bringing their
Enterprise class print

00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:55.736 A:middle
and release capability and
the full server capability

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:56.446 A:middle
for printing.

00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:58.656 A:middle
They're going to add
AirPrint right on top of that

00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:00.536 A:middle
and you'll be able
to print to all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:02.976 A:middle
of their printers plus
other third party printers.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:07.816 A:middle
So let me drill down just a
little bit into the Enterprise,

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:09.136 A:middle
I think I've talked about this.

00:09:10.136 --> 00:09:12.766 A:middle
AirPrint itself uses
Bonjour for discovery

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:14.386 A:middle
which works great in the home.

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:15.416 A:middle
We're a small network.

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:17.376 A:middle
You see the printers there
immediately available

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:18.666 A:middle
so you pick it and you print.

00:09:19.696 --> 00:09:23.346 A:middle
AirPrint from the beginning
is also supported static DNS

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:24.666 A:middle
entries for printers.

00:09:24.706 --> 00:09:27.716 A:middle
So you can define all of
your AirPrint printers

00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:30.396 A:middle
and your DNS server and for
whatever search domain your

00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:33.976 A:middle
users using they will get a list
of printers that are available

00:09:33.976 --> 00:09:35.246 A:middle
and reachable so you can print

00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:37.546 A:middle
across the internet
with AirPrint today.

00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:43.686 A:middle
New in iOS 7 we've added
iOS profile support

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:48.346 A:middle
so from the Apple Configuration
Utility and it's all documented

00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:51.806 A:middle
so hopefully third party
utilities that create profiles,

00:09:51.806 --> 00:09:54.466 A:middle
you'll be able to
define AirPrint printers

00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:56.746 A:middle
and your users will be
able to print to them

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:58.136 A:middle
from any place in the world.

00:09:58.706 --> 00:10:04.086 A:middle
AirPrint natively supports
IPPS which secure IPP with TLS

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:06.976 A:middle
and we support users in groups.

00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:12.566 A:middle
We've also added some higher
end features to laser printers.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.526 A:middle
In Mavericks you will find

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:17.856 A:middle
that if an AirPrint printer
is selected we support all the

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:21.296 A:middle
finishing options that one
would expect, fold, staple,

00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:24.736 A:middle
three hole punch, jog, output.

00:10:25.046 --> 00:10:26.516 A:middle
If you have a server,

00:10:27.246 --> 00:10:29.056 A:middle
this Lexmark server
I'm talking about,

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:30.796 A:middle
and servers from
other manufacturers,

00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:33.386 A:middle
print and release will
become a standard feature.

00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:36.276 A:middle
You can print from your
phone, go to your printer,

00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:39.286 A:middle
type in your code or put
your badge on the printer,

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.906 A:middle
see your print jobs and
release them at the printer.

00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:45.706 A:middle
And there's also native
support for quotas now built in.

00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:51.326 A:middle
So let's talk about
OS X printing.

00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:54.356 A:middle
We have all these great
features in AirPrint

00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:57.136 A:middle
and if you're an OS X
developer there's a few things

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:58.016 A:middle
that you need to know,

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:00.046 A:middle
well really you don't
need to know anything.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:02.156 A:middle
All of these changes are
immediately available

00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:02.916 A:middle
to the user.

00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:08.036 A:middle
There's no new API's, there's no
new code changes at all in OS X.

00:11:09.106 --> 00:11:12.386 A:middle
iOS, which hopefully is
why most everybody is here,

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:16.666 A:middle
we have created what we think
is a really simple way to print

00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.566 A:middle
but to get really great
quality out there.

00:11:19.276 --> 00:11:21.296 A:middle
So I've got just a couple
things I want to mention.

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:25.596 A:middle
On other platforms it's
acceptable to just sort

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:27.756 A:middle
of screen scrape and
drop that to the printer.

00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:29.996 A:middle
On our platform that's
not what we are about.

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:34.006 A:middle
We want full quality,
desktop quality output.

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:39.036 A:middle
We want you to use the space
that you would have available

00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:41.996 A:middle
on paper and bring the
information to bear

00:11:41.996 --> 00:11:46.366 A:middle
that a customer would want to
see on an 8 1/2 by 11 piece

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.346 A:middle
of paper or even larger.

00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:51.556 A:middle
It's not about a little
screen at that point.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.326 A:middle
It's about what the
user is going to need

00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:55.086 A:middle
when they get themselves
to paper.

00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:57.456 A:middle
So you should be able
to enhance your content.

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:01.966 A:middle
You should be able to draw
everything at print time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:05.566 A:middle
in high quality and you should
be able to use the real estate.

00:12:05.566 --> 00:12:08.266 A:middle
So the example that I
always like to use is Maps.

00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:10.156 A:middle
And you've seen this
on an iPhone 5.

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:10.946 A:middle
It's gorgeous.

00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:14.006 A:middle
It's got a bunch of exciting
features, turn right,

00:12:14.006 --> 00:12:16.546 A:middle
turn navigation and they've
even fixed a lot of it

00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:17.896 A:middle
so it takes you to
the right place.

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:21.576 A:middle
On the iPad there's
more real estate.

00:12:21.576 --> 00:12:22.496 A:middle
You get more maps.

00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:25.156 A:middle
There's more interesting
things that they could bring.

00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:29.666 A:middle
But when you go to paper, you
don't have the phone telling you

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.356 A:middle
to turn by turn and you
have a lot more pixels

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:34.656 A:middle
to bring to bear.

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:38.286 A:middle
So on paper they show you
the same view so you can see

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.546 A:middle
where you're going but
they also give you the turn

00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:41.726 A:middle
by turn on the side.

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:46.496 A:middle
There is example after
example of this, web browsers

00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:47.886 A:middle
where you see all kinds of stuff

00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:50.526 A:middle
but when you print you get
the article of interest,

00:12:50.526 --> 00:12:53.786 A:middle
receipt point of sale
programs where it's an entry

00:12:54.376 --> 00:12:56.386 A:middle
for buying stuff on the iPad

00:12:56.386 --> 00:12:59.846 A:middle
but when you hit print you
actually get an itemized receipt

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
with the address of the
return procedures printed

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:02.876 A:middle
on the bottom.

00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:08.366 A:middle
So we expect your apps to look
at print as a larger output form

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:11.556 A:middle
and a static output form, the
thing that somebody's going

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.936 A:middle
to fold up and put in their
pocket or put in their binder.

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:16.616 A:middle
Take advantage of that space.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:22.776 A:middle
Okay so for printing we have
two ways for you to print,

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:23.656 A:middle
I kind of mentioned this.

00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:25.846 A:middle
If you already have
pre-formed content,

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.836 A:middle
a JPEG or any other image
format supported on the platform

00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:34.566 A:middle
or PDF, 10 lines of code,
we'll take care of the rest.

00:13:35.146 --> 00:13:39.506 A:middle
You'll tell us what your intent
is for the category of output

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:42.146 A:middle
of photo or general
document or some others

00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:44.206 A:middle
and we will make all
the right settings

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:46.536 A:middle
and get the right
output for the user.

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:50.196 A:middle
If you don't already have a PDF
it's a long way around the horn

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:53.006 A:middle
to go and create a PDF to hand
it to the printing system.

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:56.266 A:middle
So in those situations
we'd like your app

00:13:56.916 --> 00:13:59.466 A:middle
to do fine grain
drawing at print time.

00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:02.516 A:middle
And we have a couple of
different classes that are set

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:06.286 A:middle
up that will make this
structured and simple for you.

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:08.826 A:middle
And to show you all
those details I'm going

00:14:08.826 --> 00:14:10.646 A:middle
to bring up Todd Ritland.

00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:13.896 A:middle
And he is going to
go through the API's

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:18.416 A:middle
and give us a demo showing you
how to make your app print.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:19.576 A:middle
Thank you, Todd.

00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:24.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:24.576 --> 00:14:26.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Todd Ritland: I'm Todd
Ritland, AirPrint Engineer.

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:28.496 A:middle
So let's talk about some
iOS printing stuff here.

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:31.506 A:middle
So first I'm going to talk
about picking what to print.

00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:33.896 A:middle
We're going to go over the API.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.926 A:middle
We'll talk about your
different UI options for ways

00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:38.606 A:middle
to present the printing UI.

00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:41.066 A:middle
We'll talk about some
new types of printers

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:43.836 A:middle
like Howard mentioned, roll
fed and label printers,

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.136 A:middle
and we'll do a demo
roll fed sample app.

00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:50.056 A:middle
So first it's important
to keep in mind

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.456 A:middle
that iOS printing is easy.

00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:54.876 A:middle
It was designed to be really
easy for users with a simple UI

00:14:55.126 --> 00:14:58.406 A:middle
and it's actually really pretty
simple for you as a developer

00:14:58.406 --> 00:14:59.766 A:middle
to add printing to your app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:02.266 A:middle
But first the most
important part

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:04.416 A:middle
of printing is providing
really good content,

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.206 A:middle
as Howard mentioned.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:10.956 A:middle
The best apps provide useful,
attractive, high quality output.

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:14.716 A:middle
It's best to think of this as
like high end graphic design.

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:18.066 A:middle
I recommend kind of
designing your output first

00:15:18.446 --> 00:15:21.396 A:middle
and then using the classes to
actually make it happen instead

00:15:21.396 --> 00:15:23.346 A:middle
of approaching it
the other way around.

00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:25.486 A:middle
As Howard mentioned,
what looks good

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:28.056 A:middle
on screen doesn't always
look good on paper.

00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:30.536 A:middle
Make use of the dynamic
printing system.

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.736 A:middle
The paper size can
actually be anything.

00:15:33.076 --> 00:15:34.066 A:middle
A lot of people don't realize

00:15:34.106 --> 00:15:37.246 A:middle
but there are two major
paper sizes in the world

00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:42.106 A:middle
for documents, A4, which is
taller and thinner then letter,

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:44.346 A:middle
and letter, what we use
in the United States.

00:15:44.766 --> 00:15:46.876 A:middle
The iOS printing system will
figure out the correct one

00:15:46.876 --> 00:15:49.606 A:middle
to use and your app needs to be
dynamic about the way it lays

00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:51.076 A:middle
out its content to best fit.

00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:53.576 A:middle
If you're expecting US
letter and you get A4

00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:56.946 A:middle
which is narrower you might
get your content clipped off

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:59.406 A:middle
on the sides and you have
a huge market of people

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:00.846 A:middle
that their output is
not going to look right.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:03.686 A:middle
Printers also have
paper size sensors.

00:16:03.686 --> 00:16:05.596 A:middle
A lot of new printers, all
future AirPrint printers,

00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:07.096 A:middle
will have paper size sensors

00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:09.796 A:middle
so whatever the user actually
has loaded in the printer,

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:14.376 A:middle
iOS will dynamically figure that
out and pass it on to the app

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:16.326 A:middle
so the best apps are
dynamic about the way

00:16:16.326 --> 00:16:17.246 A:middle
that they load up their content.

00:16:17.946 --> 00:16:20.166 A:middle
Printer hardware margins
also vary quite a bit.

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:23.046 A:middle
A lot of Inkjets that do
duplexing need a bunch of space

00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
at the bottom to
hold on to the page

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:27.956 A:middle
so you might have a really big
margin at the bottom or margins

00:16:27.956 --> 00:16:30.476 A:middle
on the left and right and top
can be any number of things

00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:33.356 A:middle
so apps that are
dynamic make sure

00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:34.756 A:middle
that their content
won't get clipped.

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:37.436 A:middle
So for all these
reasons it's best not

00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.936 A:middle
to just produce a fixed
sized PDF and hand it

00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:40.796 A:middle
to the printing system.

00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:42.956 A:middle
We've built classes
for you to be dynamic.

00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:47.056 A:middle
So a really good example of
this is Bloomberg for iPad.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.456 A:middle
So here we're looking
at an article

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.446 A:middle
about the new spaceship
campus at Apple.

00:16:51.446 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
And if you print this out,
this is the output you get.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:57.166 A:middle
We have a nice title at the top.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.526 A:middle
It has the Bloomberg logo.

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:02.696 A:middle
There's you know the picture
has a caption, we have footers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:04.675 A:middle
at the bottom that tell
us what page we're on

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:06.346 A:middle
and nice margins on the side.

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:09.566 A:middle
And if the user actually
has US legal,

00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:11.576 A:middle
which is a taller paper
loaded in the printer,

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.695 A:middle
the Bloomberg app will
be dynamic about things

00:17:14.695 --> 00:17:16.376 A:middle
and it will make
the content larger.

00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:19.435 A:middle
In this case we can print the
whole thing in just one page.

00:17:22.336 --> 00:17:24.256 A:middle
So we'll go over some
of the API's here.

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:28.455 A:middle
The basic steps are first
your app will get the printer

00:17:28.455 --> 00:17:30.436 A:middle
controller or the
activity controller

00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:31.536 A:middle
if you're using the share sheet.

00:17:32.766 --> 00:17:35.596 A:middle
You'll set up the attributes
for the job like the type of job

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:36.986 A:middle
that it is, the job name.

00:17:37.736 --> 00:17:40.576 A:middle
You'll provide content and
then you'll present the UI.

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:44.806 A:middle
At this point iOS will
present the user interface.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:45.946 A:middle
The user can select the printer.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:47.736 A:middle
iOS will communicate
with the printer,

00:17:47.736 --> 00:17:49.466 A:middle
figure out all the
relevant information.

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:52.366 A:middle
The daemon will take
over managing the jobs.

00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:53.516 A:middle
The user can cancel it.

00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:56.496 A:middle
If it's a print release job
we'll hold on to the job.

00:17:56.496 --> 00:17:57.926 A:middle
You know all these
things you don't have

00:17:57.926 --> 00:17:59.336 A:middle
to manage in your app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:02.896 A:middle
So here's the basic
classes that we'll be using.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.346 A:middle
I'll just briefly go over them
now and then we'll go on to some

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:06.236 A:middle
of these in more detail.

00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:09.856 A:middle
First we have UIPrintInfo
which is basically what you use

00:18:09.856 --> 00:18:13.116 A:middle
to put those attributes for
the job like orientation,

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:14.556 A:middle
the job name, the type of job.

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:18.956 A:middle
UIPrintPaper, just
basically represents the paper

00:18:18.956 --> 00:18:19.466 A:middle
at the printer.

00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:22.736 A:middle
We have a print formatter
which formats content

00:18:22.796 --> 00:18:24.116 A:middle
to be put onto the page.

00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:27.486 A:middle
Print page renderer which
lets you take full control

00:18:27.486 --> 00:18:28.086 A:middle
over the drawing.

00:18:28.526 --> 00:18:32.376 A:middle
For the UI we have
UIPrintInteractionController

00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:35.736 A:middle
which is the main printing
UI and UIActivityController

00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.356 A:middle
which is the share
sheet, essentially.

00:18:40.506 --> 00:18:42.256 A:middle
So first let's talk
about UIPrintIinfo.

00:18:44.076 --> 00:18:45.716 A:middle
First you'll set the job name.

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:47.656 A:middle
Now this is really important.

00:18:47.776 --> 00:18:50.076 A:middle
It's shown in the
UI print center

00:18:50.076 --> 00:18:51.396 A:middle
when the user's managing
the job.

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:54.266 A:middle
It also gets shown on the front
panel of a lot of printers.

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:58.446 A:middle
This is the way the user is
going to identify your job.

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:02.126 A:middle
Howard mentioned servers, for
print and release situations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:04.856 A:middle
and stuff, users will
be identifying their job

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:08.256 A:middle
by the job name so it needs to
be really specific and something

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:11.516 A:middle
that the user would
actually be able to find.

00:19:11.556 --> 00:19:13.596 A:middle
Next a really important
one is output type.

00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:16.596 A:middle
This is how you'll tell the
printing system the type

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:17.736 A:middle
of content you're printing.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:20.806 A:middle
We'll change the
default paper size.

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:23.306 A:middle
We'll pick a correct
print quality mode.

00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:25.396 A:middle
And we'll show the
appropriate UI based

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:27.076 A:middle
on the content that you tell us.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.676 A:middle
So we have four of these.

00:19:29.066 --> 00:19:31.926 A:middle
The first one is just
a general document.

00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:33.676 A:middle
Safari is an example of this.

00:19:33.676 --> 00:19:35.426 A:middle
It's just mixed text
and graphics.

00:19:35.756 --> 00:19:40.106 A:middle
We'll choose a document
size like A4 or letter,

00:19:40.106 --> 00:19:41.016 A:middle
depending on the region.

00:19:41.396 --> 00:19:44.206 A:middle
Duplex control will be
allowed and page range control,

00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:45.566 A:middle
things you would
expect from a document.

00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:47.776 A:middle
And we choose normal quality.

00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:52.976 A:middle
Next a very similar one
is document Grayscale.

00:19:53.596 --> 00:19:55.886 A:middle
This is monochrome
text and graphics.

00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:58.996 A:middle
Now you can choose this
and we'll optimize things

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:01.096 A:middle
so that the data over
the network is lower.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:01.396 --> 00:20:04.036 A:middle
We'll tell the printer to print
it using just its black ink

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.696 A:middle
so it can save the
user some ink.

00:20:06.826 --> 00:20:08.226 A:middle
And just like the
previous example,

00:20:08.386 --> 00:20:09.806 A:middle
duplex and page range
is allowed.

00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:11.916 A:middle
Next we have photo.

00:20:12.616 --> 00:20:14.616 A:middle
This is you know
printing photos.

00:20:14.616 --> 00:20:17.266 A:middle
Users want high quality,
borderless

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:19.126 A:middle
and when we show the
UI, when you tell us

00:20:19.126 --> 00:20:22.016 A:middle
that you're printing a photo,
we won't show the duplex control

00:20:22.016 --> 00:20:24.926 A:middle
or page range because these
don't make sense for a photo.

00:20:25.796 --> 00:20:29.816 A:middle
And new in iOS 7 we have
UIPrintInfoOutputPhotoGrayscale.

00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:31.916 A:middle
So similar to the last one

00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:35.296 A:middle
where we have photo paper sizes
we'll choose the photo tray,

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:37.106 A:middle
if the printer has
one, borderless,

00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:39.346 A:middle
but we'll actually tell
the printer to print this

00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:40.746 A:middle
in high quality Grayscale.

00:20:40.966 --> 00:20:44.336 A:middle
Some printers that are like high
end Cannon printers have a bunch

00:20:44.336 --> 00:20:47.626 A:middle
of gray inks and really
excellent gray quality printing

00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:49.026 A:middle
and we'll tell the
printer to use

00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:53.606 A:middle
that if you choose
this output type.

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:55.006 A:middle
Okay so that's UIPrintInfo.

00:20:56.486 --> 00:20:58.136 A:middle
Next we'll go over UIPrintPaper.

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:03.506 A:middle
It's basically just the size
of the page at the printer

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:06.796 A:middle
and then inside of that we
have the printable area.

00:21:07.536 --> 00:21:10.726 A:middle
This is the size minus the
hardware margins of the printer,

00:21:10.726 --> 00:21:12.536 A:middle
the area where the
printer can't print

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:14.796 A:middle
because you know it
can't shoot its laser

00:21:14.796 --> 00:21:16.506 A:middle
or the print head
can't move towards it.

00:21:18.396 --> 00:21:21.346 A:middle
Next we'll talk about
providing content.

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.366 A:middle
As Howard mentioned, there's
basically two types of printing,

00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:26.976 A:middle
you either have items like PDF's
and images that already exist

00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:29.526 A:middle
or you're going to be creating
your pages dynamically.

00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:32.246 A:middle
If you're creating pages
dynamically you'll use these

00:21:32.246 --> 00:21:34.426 A:middle
formatters and renderer
classes that I've mentioned.

00:21:35.246 --> 00:21:37.136 A:middle
If you already have
content like PDF and images,

00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:39.876 A:middle
you don't use these things.

00:21:40.016 --> 00:21:42.776 A:middle
So the easy example
is printing items.

00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:45.966 A:middle
It could be a single item or
you can actually send an array

00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:48.266 A:middle
of items like an array
of photos for example

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.966 A:middle
that the user selects
in a bunch of photos.

00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:54.906 A:middle
This could be JPEG's or any
image type that iOS understands.

00:21:55.886 --> 00:21:59.746 A:middle
These can be in the form of
NSURL's, file URL on disk

00:21:59.746 --> 00:22:03.646 A:middle
or elsewhere, it could be in
memory in the form of NSData

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:04.146 --> 00:22:08.166 A:middle
or a UIImage or CI image
or it could be something

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:12.446 A:middle
in the photo library in the form
of an ALAsset or ALAssetURL.

00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:14.266 A:middle
If you provide an
array of items,

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.386 A:middle
each one will be a separate job.

00:22:15.916 --> 00:22:19.986 A:middle
So here's all the code that
you would need to print a PDF.

00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:23.486 A:middle
First we'll ask the
UIPrintInteractionController

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:25.206 A:middle
if it can print the URL.

00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:28.586 A:middle
This is a method that gets
the URL to a PDF file.

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:31.936 A:middle
Examples when it wouldn't
be able to print it are

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:34.106 A:middle
if the PDF had password
protection

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:35.906 A:middle
or if it was malformed
in some way

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:37.526 A:middle
and the
UIPrinterActionController

00:22:37.526 --> 00:22:39.956 A:middle
actually can tell you
if it can be printed.

00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:43.206 A:middle
Next we'll grab the shared
UIPrinterInteractionController.

00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:45.286 A:middle
It's a shared object so
you don't initialize it.

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:46.346 A:middle
You just grab the shared one.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.346 A:middle
We'll set the printing
item property

00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:51.596 A:middle
to be the URL of our PDF file.

00:22:53.386 --> 00:22:54.926 A:middle
We'll set up a UIPrintInfo.

00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:56.406 A:middle
Those are the attributes
for the job

00:22:57.356 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
so we'll initialize
the UIPrintInfo.

00:22:59.176 --> 00:23:02.386 A:middle
We'll set the output type
to be output general.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:02.526 --> 00:23:05.566 A:middle
This makes sense for PDF because
PDF typically have, you know,

00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:08.736 A:middle
photos in them or other
color content plus text.

00:23:09.076 --> 00:23:11.286 A:middle
We'll set the job name
to be name of the file.

00:23:11.966 --> 00:23:14.626 A:middle
And then we'll set the
controllers print info property

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.916 A:middle
to be the print info
we just created.

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:20.896 A:middle
We'll tell the controller to
turn on the page range control.

00:23:21.436 --> 00:23:23.576 A:middle
By default it doesn't show
the page range control.

00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:26.216 A:middle
But when our user's printing
a PDF they're probably going

00:23:26.216 --> 00:23:29.516 A:middle
to want to be able to choose a
page range inside of the page,

00:23:29.896 --> 00:23:33.246 A:middle
I mean inside of the PDF
and then we'll just present.

00:23:34.026 --> 00:23:36.226 A:middle
So that's all that it
takes to print a PDF.

00:23:36.226 --> 00:23:39.386 A:middle
At this point the iOS will take
control of everything else.

00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:42.416 A:middle
If the printer has a bunch of
trays and we actually notice

00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:44.936 A:middle
that the PDF file matches
exactly one of those trays

00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:48.996 A:middle
like say it's an 11 by 17 PDF,
we'll choose the right tray,

00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:50.776 A:middle
everything will just
happen magically.

00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:51.956 A:middle
[ laughter ]

00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:56.826 A:middle
Okay so formatters, if you're
actually formatting content

00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:58.426 A:middle
or rendering content
dynamically,

00:23:58.426 --> 00:24:00.116 A:middle
formatters are the first
thing to get to know.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:02.706 A:middle
Now what exactly is a formatter?

00:24:03.506 --> 00:24:08.216 A:middle
Formatter basically takes
some data in your app

00:24:08.216 --> 00:24:12.076 A:middle
and some rectangle on a printed
page and it figures out how

00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:13.326 A:middle
to format that for printing.

00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:16.776 A:middle
That's just in the
abstract sense here.

00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:20.996 A:middle
So an example of this
would be string of text,

00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:22.446 A:middle
we use a simple text formatter.

00:24:22.446 --> 00:24:25.806 A:middle
The simple text formatter
will just take that string,

00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:29.046 A:middle
it will figure out how best
to put it into the rectangle

00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:32.206 A:middle
and it will format it.

00:24:32.826 --> 00:24:36.566 A:middle
It will figure out the
line breaks, line spacing,

00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:39.106 A:middle
you can set font,
color, things like that.

00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:42.146 A:middle
Now all of this text doesn't
actually fit in this rectangle

00:24:42.596 --> 00:24:44.276 A:middle
so a formatter knows
that it needs

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:45.846 A:middle
to continue on to the next page.

00:24:48.016 --> 00:24:49.656 A:middle
So you can use a
formatter directly

00:24:49.656 --> 00:24:51.546 A:middle
if all you're doing is
formatting the content.

00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:54.116 A:middle
You can use it with
UIPrintInteractionController

00:24:54.596 --> 00:24:56.856 A:middle
or you can add it to the
array of activity items

00:24:56.966 --> 00:24:58.116 A:middle
if you're using the share sheet.

00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:02.586 A:middle
You can also use formatters
as a helper in a full renderer

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:02.656 --> 00:25:03.676 A:middle
and we'll go over that later.

00:25:04.326 --> 00:25:07.356 A:middle
For plain text, as I
mentioned you can use

00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:11.266 A:middle
UISimpleTextFormatter, you
can specify font, color,

00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:14.036 A:middle
alignment like center,
left, justified.

00:25:14.216 --> 00:25:18.016 A:middle
For HTML we have a really
handy markup text formatter

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:21.266 A:middle
and that knows how to
layout your HTML according

00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:23.066 A:middle
to all the HTML rules on a page.

00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:29.756 A:middle
So by default a formatter
uses the printable rect inside

00:25:29.756 --> 00:25:32.046 A:middle
of the page which is the
area that's printable

00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:34.666 A:middle
but some printers have
really small margins,

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.926 A:middle
some printers can print you
know up to 1/10 of an inch

00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:40.316 A:middle
to the edge of the page and
so that's not probably ideal

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.636 A:middle
so that's why we
have content insets.

00:25:43.806 --> 00:25:47.016 A:middle
You can specify area
inside the printable rect,

00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:48.156 A:middle
left, right and top.

00:25:49.526 --> 00:25:51.956 A:middle
Upper page renderer will just
keep rendering the content

00:25:52.546 --> 00:25:54.036 A:middle
until it uses up all the content

00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:56.306 A:middle
so the bottom content
inside is ignored.

00:25:56.796 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
So here's an easy example
of using a formatter

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:04.076 A:middle
to print some HTML text.

00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:06.486 A:middle
Here we just create our
UIMarkupTextFormatter.

00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:09.676 A:middle
We're initializing
it with the HTML text

00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:11.246 A:middle
that was provided
into this method.

00:26:12.216 --> 00:26:14.016 A:middle
And then we set the
URIPrinterAction

00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:16.926 A:middle
ControllersPrintFormatter
property to be our formatter.

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.766 A:middle
So this is all that it takes

00:26:19.806 --> 00:26:21.976 A:middle
to print some HTML
text onto a page.

00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:27.786 A:middle
And we set up our UIPrintInfo,
general, job name and so

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:32.756 A:middle
on and then we present.

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:35.516 A:middle
Now all of viewers actually
have print formatters so a lot

00:26:35.516 --> 00:26:37.726 A:middle
of times you don't need to
create a formatter yourself.

00:26:38.336 --> 00:26:40.726 A:middle
In this case we have
a web view in our app.

00:26:41.086 --> 00:26:44.136 A:middle
Instead of initializing our own
print formatter we can just grab

00:26:44.216 --> 00:26:46.486 A:middle
the view print formatter
from our web view.

00:26:47.586 --> 00:26:49.876 A:middle
Another view that this is
really useful for is a map view,

00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:52.606 A:middle
if you need to format map
content to put onto a page,

00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:54.426 A:middle
you can just grab the
ViewPrintFormatter

00:26:54.426 --> 00:26:55.196 A:middle
from the map view.

00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:59.616 A:middle
Okay so that's formatters.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:02.086 A:middle
Next, page renderers.

00:27:04.376 --> 00:27:06.036 A:middle
Now renderers you can use,

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.796 A:middle
they're completely
control content.

00:27:07.796 --> 00:27:09.826 A:middle
This is total custom printing.

00:27:11.316 --> 00:27:12.566 A:middle
What is a renderer
exactly though?

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:14.856 A:middle
Here's our renderer class.

00:27:15.456 --> 00:27:17.546 A:middle
It needs to know the number
of pages it's going to print.

00:27:17.926 --> 00:27:22.216 A:middle
And then the system basically
asks it to draw each page.

00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:27.356 A:middle
It says you know draw first
page and it goes and draws.

00:27:28.676 --> 00:27:30.996 A:middle
It can use any of the
screen drawing methods,

00:27:30.996 --> 00:27:32.126 A:middle
you know it can use cores.

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:33.776 A:middle
If you want to have
find viewing control

00:27:33.776 --> 00:27:35.956 A:middle
over text you can use core text.

00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:38.616 A:middle
Basically anything you
print to screen you can use.

00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:42.276 A:middle
So we have full drawing control.

00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:45.666 A:middle
It will calculate the page count
and then draw the page contents.

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:49.256 A:middle
The class also has capability
to add space for headers

00:27:49.256 --> 00:27:51.536 A:middle
and footers and for
more information

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:53.986 A:middle
on that you can take a look
at the developer documentation

00:27:54.626 --> 00:27:58.036 A:middle
or come to our lab later
and you can add formatters.

00:27:58.516 --> 00:28:01.276 A:middle
Now what does a renderer
with a formatter look like?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:02.316 --> 00:28:03.516 A:middle
Well here we have
our render object.

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:05.576 A:middle
It's told to draw a page.

00:28:05.856 --> 00:28:09.486 A:middle
In this case it's just
drawing some accents at the top

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.426 A:middle
and bottom of the page.

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.026 A:middle
Then the area in the middle
we want to put some text.

00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:17.996 A:middle
So the render has a
simple text formatter.

00:28:18.676 --> 00:28:22.056 A:middle
Once it's done drawing the
outside part it will use the UI

00:28:22.056 --> 00:28:25.616 A:middle
simple text formatter to draw
our Gettysburg Address here.

00:28:26.126 --> 00:28:28.556 A:middle
So you can see how you can kind

00:28:28.556 --> 00:28:29.786 A:middle
of combine these
things together.

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.956 A:middle
You can think of
the renderer as kind

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:34.216 A:middle
of the captain that's
controlling everything.

00:28:34.216 --> 00:28:36.996 A:middle
It can kind of draw
using any method possible

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:39.466 A:middle
and a renderer is just one of
those tools that it can use.

00:28:41.196 --> 00:28:43.326 A:middle
So you'll subclass
UIPrintPageRenderer.

00:28:44.586 --> 00:28:46.506 A:middle
At a minimum you'll
override number of pages

00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:49.086 A:middle
and drop content
for page and index.

00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:52.356 A:middle
You can also override
draw header for content,

00:28:52.826 --> 00:28:55.286 A:middle
draw header for page and
index and draw footer for page

00:28:55.286 --> 00:28:56.546 A:middle
and index and some other things.

00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:58.526 A:middle
So you'll set, if you're using

00:28:58.526 --> 00:28:59.776 A:middle
with a print interaction
controller,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.266 --> 00:29:02.146 A:middle
you'll set the print
page renderer property

00:29:02.146 --> 00:29:05.306 A:middle
to be the instantiated
object that you just created

00:29:05.306 --> 00:29:06.836 A:middle
of your custom print
page renderer.

00:29:07.676 --> 00:29:10.236 A:middle
Or you can add that object
to the array of items

00:29:10.236 --> 00:29:12.856 A:middle
when you are creating a
UIActivityViewController

00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:13.986 A:middle
when you're doing
the view share sheet.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.446 A:middle
To use formatters you'll
actually create your formatter

00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:19.986 A:middle
object and then you'll
call add, print formatter,

00:29:19.986 --> 00:29:22.056 A:middle
starting at page index.

00:29:22.156 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
Formatters can start
at any page.

00:29:26.076 --> 00:29:28.246 A:middle
Now showing UI, we have a
couple different options

00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:29.196 A:middle
for showing UPrintUI.

00:29:30.016 --> 00:29:31.916 A:middle
As I've mentioned we have
printing from the share sheet.

00:29:32.576 --> 00:29:35.466 A:middle
This is probably where most
people I think expect printing.

00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:40.226 A:middle
This is where it appears in
most of the built in iOS apps.

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:41.486 A:middle
And you also get other things

00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:43.326 A:middle
like AirDrop, a cool
new feature.

00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:46.846 A:middle
So to add printing
to a share sheet,

00:29:47.436 --> 00:29:48.636 A:middle
if you're sharing something

00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:52.756 A:middle
like in this case we're sharing
our URL text and UI will figure

00:29:52.756 --> 00:29:54.746 A:middle
out all the different sharing
items that should be shown.

00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:57.956 A:middle
But if the user is sharing a
web page and they're printing,

00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:01.126 A:middle
they're probably going to want
the actual web page printed out.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:05.116 A:middle
So here we're actually adding a
renderer to our activity items

00:30:05.606 --> 00:30:07.056 A:middle
and we can add our print info

00:30:07.056 --> 00:30:10.736 A:middle
which has our job
name and output type.

00:30:10.736 --> 00:30:14.346 A:middle
So we just create
that array and we set,

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:18.076 A:middle
when we create our
UIActivityViewController we just

00:30:18.076 --> 00:30:19.696 A:middle
set the activity items
to be those items

00:30:20.156 --> 00:30:24.506 A:middle
and present using
standard present methods.

00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:28.666 A:middle
Now if you're printing using
a print button that goes right

00:30:28.666 --> 00:30:29.426 A:middle
into the printing UI,

00:30:30.216 --> 00:30:32.426 A:middle
that's when you'll be using
UIPrintInteractionController.

00:30:32.826 --> 00:30:34.926 A:middle
On iPhone you just imply
call presentAnimated:

00:30:34.926 --> 00:30:36.256 A:middle
completionHandler on iPad.

00:30:36.256 --> 00:30:40.336 A:middle
It will be a pop over so you'll
be calling presentFromRect

00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:41.686 A:middle
or presentFromBarButtonItem.

00:30:42.136 --> 00:30:48.296 A:middle
Now if you're printing as a
menu item, in this case pages,

00:30:49.656 --> 00:30:53.046 A:middle
we have an embedded printing
control inside of your control,

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:55.876 A:middle
you'll set your class
as a delegate

00:30:55.876 --> 00:30:58.046 A:middle
for the shared
UIPrinterActionController.

00:30:58.686 --> 00:31:01.426 A:middle
Your class will implement
printInteractionController

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:01.486 --> 00:31:02.536 A:middle
ParentViewController.

00:31:03.196 --> 00:31:05.456 A:middle
The printer action controller
will call this to figure

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:07.416 A:middle
out what its parent
view controller is.

00:31:07.986 --> 00:31:11.376 A:middle
Then when the user taps print
you'll call presentAnimated:

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:12.416 A:middle
CompletionHandler.

00:31:13.506 --> 00:31:16.306 A:middle
And if your parent view is the
UINavigationController it will

00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:19.036 A:middle
get a push, and that is what
the case is I'm showing here,

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:22.626 A:middle
if it's a ViewControl it will
get a modal presentation.

00:31:23.656 --> 00:31:26.216 A:middle
You'll have access to the
object but just don't peek at it

00:31:26.216 --> 00:31:28.296 A:middle
because everything
inside of it is subject

00:31:28.296 --> 00:31:29.416 A:middle
to change at any time.

00:31:30.786 --> 00:31:34.906 A:middle
If you need control over paper
size like pages, for example,

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:36.356 A:middle
at the document center gap

00:31:36.356 --> 00:31:39.296 A:middle
where the user is designing
their layout with the page

00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:42.176 A:middle
in mind, we also have
capabilities to do that

00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:43.996 A:middle
and so first you'll
design your UI

00:31:43.996 --> 00:31:46.086 A:middle
for the user to select the page.

00:31:46.086 --> 00:31:48.866 A:middle
And you'll use the
delegate method,

00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:50.946 A:middle
print interaction
controller choose paper.

00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:54.676 A:middle
There'll be an array of papers
that get passed into this

00:31:54.676 --> 00:31:58.036 A:middle
and your delegate is responsible
for picking the one to use.

00:31:59.146 --> 00:32:01.316 A:middle
This gets called after the
user has selected the printer,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:02.126 --> 00:32:03.696 A:middle
iOS communicates with
the printer to figure

00:32:03.696 --> 00:32:05.196 A:middle
out what sizes are available

00:32:05.196 --> 00:32:10.166 A:middle
and then some printers
have paper size sensors,

00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:12.186 A:middle
like I mentioned, that can
tell the types of papers

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:12.846 A:middle
that are at the printer.

00:32:13.496 --> 00:32:14.386 A:middle
The array that gets passed

00:32:14.386 --> 00:32:17.186 A:middle
to your app will actually be
those papers that are available

00:32:17.186 --> 00:32:18.356 A:middle
at the printer in that case.

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:20.156 A:middle
So this array of
papers that gets passed

00:32:20.156 --> 00:32:21.826 A:middle
to you could be a lot
of different things

00:32:21.826 --> 00:32:23.946 A:middle
but you'll be responsible
for selecting it.

00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:25.506 A:middle
So here's an example of that.

00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:27.366 A:middle
Here we're just creating
a paper size,

00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:30.516 A:middle
CGSize that's just
basically 8 1/2 by 11.

00:32:31.476 --> 00:32:35.656 A:middle
We'll use UIPrintPaper's
best paper for page size method

00:32:35.656 --> 00:32:38.226 A:middle
so we provided this as
a great way for matching

00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:40.626 A:middle
because paper matching is
actually pretty complicated

00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:42.846 A:middle
if you want to find the closest
match so we've provided this

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:44.466 A:middle
for you and we recommend
that you use this.

00:32:44.556 --> 00:32:48.156 A:middle
Next we have roll paper, this
is what Howard mentioned,

00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:49.536 A:middle
and this is new in iOS 7.

00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:52.036 A:middle
Basically you'll use
the delegate method,

00:32:52.576 --> 00:32:54.786 A:middle
print interaction controller,
cut length for paper.

00:32:55.126 --> 00:32:57.826 A:middle
So this works pretty
similarly to the choose paper

00:32:57.826 --> 00:33:00.746 A:middle
but in this case you're
passed in a UIPrintPaper.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:01.706 --> 00:33:04.296 A:middle
Once the user selected a
printer that has a roll loaded,

00:33:04.296 --> 00:33:07.436 A:middle
the UIPrintPaper
will have the width,

00:33:07.436 --> 00:33:10.626 A:middle
will be the roll width, and
the height will be the maximum

00:33:10.626 --> 00:33:12.626 A:middle
height that's possible
on this roll printer.

00:33:13.236 --> 00:33:15.626 A:middle
So by default if your app
doesn't implement this cut

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:18.316 A:middle
length for paper and the
user chooses a roll printer,

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:20.966 A:middle
the default length will be
proportional to the height.

00:33:21.016 --> 00:33:22.916 A:middle
So if you normally would
be printing US letter,

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:25.656 A:middle
we'll choose a paper size
proportional to US letter

00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:28.626 A:middle
or if you have a photo,
4 by 6 or something,

00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:30.906 A:middle
we'll choose a size that's
proportional to that.

00:33:31.546 --> 00:33:34.816 A:middle
So here's an example of telling
the printer system how long

00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:35.176 A:middle
to cut.

00:33:35.176 --> 00:33:38.186 A:middle
In this case all we're doing
is returning 2 times the width.

00:33:41.866 --> 00:33:43.386 A:middle
So next we'll go
over the demo here.

00:33:43.386 --> 00:33:44.786 A:middle
This is what our UI's
going to look like.

00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:46.646 A:middle
And I have bad news.

00:33:47.616 --> 00:33:50.226 A:middle
I did not win the Apple
design award for this UI.

00:33:50.226 --> 00:33:50.566 A:middle
[ laughter ]

00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:52.256 A:middle
It's pretty simple.

00:33:52.256 --> 00:33:55.676 A:middle
It's just like a text field
and a couple different ways

00:33:55.676 --> 00:33:57.496 A:middle
for the user to select
the font and the color.

00:33:59.006 --> 00:34:01.636 A:middle
And then when user
selects a roll printer,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:01.636 --> 00:34:03.476 A:middle
we'll be printing a
banner so it will come

00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:05.306 A:middle
out as a banner printed
across the roll.

00:34:05.666 --> 00:34:07.216 A:middle
So how are we going to do this?

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:12.275 A:middle
We'll have our string of
text, here's our roll of paper

00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:13.716 A:middle
that we just found
at the printer.

00:34:15.126 --> 00:34:17.315 A:middle
We'll tell the printing
system that we're going

00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:18.706 A:middle
to be doing a landscape job

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:20.866 A:middle
so that we print the
text along the roll.

00:34:20.866 --> 00:34:24.196 A:middle
We're going to use a UI
simple text formatter

00:34:24.196 --> 00:34:27.266 A:middle
to format the text with
the font the user selected.

00:34:27.266 --> 00:34:29.956 A:middle
We're going to figure out
how big we can make it.

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:35.466 A:middle
We'll calculate that total size
and we'll return a cut length.

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:39.306 A:middle
And I'll show that demo now.

00:34:39.585 --> 00:34:45.176 A:middle
Okay so here we have our
print banner project.

00:34:45.456 --> 00:34:47.795 A:middle
So this is available in
the prerelease section

00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:49.576 A:middle
of the developer documentation

00:34:49.576 --> 00:34:51.126 A:middle
so it's been available
this week.

00:34:53.565 --> 00:34:56.976 A:middle
So basically everything that's
going on in this app happens

00:34:56.976 --> 00:34:57.886 A:middle
in the view controller.

00:34:58.456 --> 00:35:02.816 A:middle
We have some pretty
boiler plate things

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:05.826 A:middle
that are just finding the
font that the user selected

00:35:05.826 --> 00:35:08.776 A:middle
and finding a color that
the user selected in the UI.

00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:11.236 A:middle
Here's our print method.

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:14.466 A:middle
First we're grabbing the shared
UIPrintInteractionController.

00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:18.356 A:middle
We're setting the controller's
delegate to be ourselves

00:35:18.486 --> 00:35:20.986 A:middle
because we want to be called
for cut length for paper.

00:35:22.986 --> 00:35:24.946 A:middle
We setup a completion handler

00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:27.186 A:middle
which just basically logs an
error if something goes wrong.

00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:31.686 A:middle
Here we're setting our printInfo
output type to be general

00:35:31.686 --> 00:35:34.196 A:middle
because the user can
select any number of colors

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:35.286 A:middle
so it's not Grayscale.

00:35:36.876 --> 00:35:39.226 A:middle
Here we're setting the
orientation to be landscape

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:40.506 A:middle
so we're printing
along the roll.

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:43.686 A:middle
Here we're setting the job name

00:35:43.886 --> 00:35:47.096 A:middle
to be just whatever the user
has entered into the text field

00:35:47.196 --> 00:35:50.006 A:middle
and then we set the
printInfo on the controller.

00:35:52.576 --> 00:35:54.526 A:middle
Next we create our
simple text formatter.

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:57.056 A:middle
We're initializing it with
the text from the text field.

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:02.176 A:middle
We set the text formatters color
to be the users chosen color

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:02.686 --> 00:36:04.606 A:middle
and the font to be
the users chosen font.

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:08.636 A:middle
We set the controller
print formatter property

00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:11.316 A:middle
to be our simple text
formatter we created

00:36:11.316 --> 00:36:13.966 A:middle
and then we just present the UI.

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.186 A:middle
Now when the user selects
the printer it has a roll.

00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:20.816 A:middle
This delegate will be
called cut length for paper

00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:23.746 A:middle
with the UIPrintPaper
representing the roll.

00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:28.796 A:middle
Here we're just calculating
the size

00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:31.226 A:middle
of our text based
on the default font.

00:36:33.336 --> 00:36:35.566 A:middle
We'll do a simple calculation
to figure out how big

00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:37.566 A:middle
that we can actually
make it on the page.

00:36:38.106 --> 00:36:42.226 A:middle
And we'll create a new
font based on that size

00:36:42.226 --> 00:36:43.086 A:middle
that we just calculated.

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:49.086 A:middle
Here we're finding how big our
final text size is going to be

00:36:49.086 --> 00:36:52.326 A:middle
with that font that we
calculated using just a size

00:36:52.326 --> 00:36:53.086 A:middle
with attributes.

00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:58.526 A:middle
And we set our simple text
formatters font to be the font

00:36:58.526 --> 00:37:00.536 A:middle
that we just calculated
with the size we calculated.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:05.866 A:middle
Now next we actually have
to figure out the margins.

00:37:05.996 --> 00:37:08.336 A:middle
So we figured out how wide
our text is going to be

00:37:08.446 --> 00:37:10.576 A:middle
but if we just returned

00:37:10.576 --> 00:37:13.796 A:middle
that length we wouldn't be
accounting for the margins.

00:37:14.296 --> 00:37:17.456 A:middle
Even roll printers can have
margins on top, bottom,

00:37:17.456 --> 00:37:20.146 A:middle
left and right so we need
to add in our margins.

00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:25.536 A:middle
To figure out margins we just
subtract our printable rect

00:37:25.536 --> 00:37:28.686 A:middle
from our paper size so that
gives us margins on both sides.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:33.776 A:middle
So we'll return the width
of our text plus the length

00:37:33.776 --> 00:37:37.086 A:middle
of these margins and plus
some small padding factor

00:37:37.176 --> 00:37:38.606 A:middle
to make sure things fit.

00:37:40.506 --> 00:37:41.246 A:middle
So we'll run this

00:37:41.246 --> 00:37:49.996 A:middle
in the simulator here
and here's our UI.

00:37:50.476 --> 00:37:51.186 A:middle
I'll choose script.

00:37:52.606 --> 00:37:53.696 A:middle
We'll enter some text in here.

00:37:54.196 --> 00:38:01.266 A:middle

00:38:04.896 --> 00:38:05.536 A:middle
[laughter] This is true.

00:38:06.116 --> 00:38:09.176 A:middle
So next, what are we
going to print this on?

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:11.696 A:middle
Well we ship a really great tool

00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:14.366 A:middle
with Xcode that's
a printer simulator

00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:16.056 A:middle
so as you're developing
your app you don't have

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:17.016 A:middle
to be wasting paper.

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:18.886 A:middle
To get to this simulator,

00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:21.366 A:middle
from the iOS simulator
we can just go file,

00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:27.416 A:middle
open printer simulator or we
can, from Xcodes developer menu,

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:32.126 A:middle
we can choose open developer
tool, that's available here too.

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:38.656 A:middle
So the printer simulator has
a bunch of simulated printers.

00:38:38.656 --> 00:38:41.706 A:middle
We have different
types, color lasers,

00:38:41.706 --> 00:38:43.266 A:middle
Inkjets, two sided printers.

00:38:44.356 --> 00:38:46.476 A:middle
New in the latest
Xcode, Xcode 5,

00:38:47.616 --> 00:38:49.446 A:middle
we have a 36 inch roll printer

00:38:49.976 --> 00:38:51.506 A:middle
and we have a simulated
label printer.

00:38:54.446 --> 00:38:56.656 A:middle
Now roll printers
always detect the size

00:38:56.656 --> 00:38:57.646 A:middle
of the roll that's loaded.

00:38:57.646 --> 00:38:58.776 A:middle
You always know the size.

00:38:59.496 --> 00:39:02.106 A:middle
So how do we set a size
with our simulated printer?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:03.586 --> 00:39:06.476 A:middle
Well we have this load
paper button here in the UI.

00:39:07.236 --> 00:39:10.486 A:middle
We can tap that and
here we get a view

00:39:10.486 --> 00:39:12.126 A:middle
of all the different
simulated printers

00:39:12.126 --> 00:39:13.556 A:middle
and which size is
loaded in each.

00:39:14.616 --> 00:39:16.206 A:middle
We'll go to the simulated
label printer

00:39:16.816 --> 00:39:19.036 A:middle
and actually load a 2
inch roll so we're going

00:39:19.036 --> 00:39:20.416 A:middle
to print a 2 inch roll banner.

00:39:22.476 --> 00:39:23.266 A:middle
Click okay.

00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:26.186 A:middle
We'll choose the label printer.

00:39:31.276 --> 00:39:32.636 A:middle
And there we have our output

00:39:32.786 --> 00:39:36.146 A:middle
so it's been formatted
correctly and spans the roll.

00:39:36.536 --> 00:39:43.486 A:middle
Now we're dynamic here,
we're dynamic here

00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:44.816 A:middle
so we can choose
a different font.

00:39:45.176 --> 00:39:48.306 A:middle
We can go in, load a 4
inch roll if we want,

00:39:51.906 --> 00:39:55.096 A:middle
print that same content
to the label printer

00:39:55.096 --> 00:39:56.106 A:middle
and then fills the roll.

00:39:56.106 --> 00:40:00.876 A:middle
Now as Howard mentioned we have
an actual real printer here.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:04.486 A:middle
We'll go ahead and choose that.

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:08.786 A:middle
We'll print that out.

00:40:08.786 --> 00:40:11.186 A:middle
So Brother makes really
great, very reliable printers

00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:12.336 A:middle

Howard mentioned,

00:40:12.336 --> 00:40:15.006 A:middle
will actually be getting
an AirPrint upgrade later

00:40:15.006 --> 00:40:15.556 A:middle
this year.

00:40:15.556 --> 00:40:16.386 A:middle
It's shipping right now.

00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:18.616 A:middle
It takes a little
bit of time for it

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.036 A:middle
to get warmed up
here as it prints.

00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:24.846 A:middle
It's a thermal printer so the
array needs to get warmed up.

00:40:24.846 --> 00:40:26.036 A:middle
We haven't printed to
it in quite a while.

00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:27.766 A:middle
And here we go.

00:40:27.766 --> 00:40:29.276 A:middle
[ Noise ]

00:40:29.276 --> 00:40:38.706 A:middle
And so there we have it, so
there's our printed roll.

00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:48.706 A:middle
So I hope we've shown
you that printing

00:40:48.706 --> 00:40:50.006 A:middle
in your app is really easy.

00:40:51.026 --> 00:40:53.896 A:middle
Printing items like PDF's
and images can be really just

00:40:53.896 --> 00:40:55.156 A:middle
like 10 lines of code.

00:40:55.856 --> 00:40:57.376 A:middle
We provide formatters
and renderers

00:40:57.376 --> 00:40:58.796 A:middle
to give you full
control of printing

00:40:58.796 --> 00:41:00.046 A:middle
so you can make beautiful
output.
