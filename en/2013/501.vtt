00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:10.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:11.866 A:middle
Thank you for coming.

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.046 A:middle
My name is Jacques
Gasselin and I'm the manager

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.406 A:middle
of Game Technologies
Team here at Apple.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.356 A:middle
Today, I'm talking
about Game Controllers.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:28.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:29.156 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:29.396 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:29.676 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:29.926 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:31.856 A:middle
So, as you heard
yesterday, in the state

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:35.436 A:middle
of the union just I'll
mention we have a lot

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:36.366 A:middle
of games in our platform.

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.746 A:middle
It's immensely successful.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.276 A:middle
We have games that capture
your imagination, we have games

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.406 A:middle
that you play on the go
or at home in the couch

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:48.926 A:middle
and games interact
with the user.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:51.876 A:middle
They give you an experience

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.446 A:middle
and that's what this is
all about, interaction.

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:58.206 A:middle
Game controllers will allow you

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:00.886 A:middle
to give the users
another experience,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:03.156 A:middle
another way to interact
with your game content

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
and that I think
is very important.

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:12.236 A:middle
But you won't just have game
controllers we still have the

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.396 A:middle
existing mechanics on the phone.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.456 A:middle
So, touch is fantastic
and a flexible way

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:21.696 A:middle
for giving the users ways to
provide actions through tapping,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.666 A:middle
tilting when motion, swiping

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:27.006 A:middle
or touching direct
locations from the screen.

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.216 A:middle
Game controllers on the
other hand are fantastic

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:31.366 A:middle
for directional inputs.

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:35.416 A:middle
And with our precious sensitive
buttons they give you an option

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:39.396 A:middle
to provide gameplay mechanics
such as picking a ball

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:42.316 A:middle
or throwing a ball maybe
executing a special maneuver

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.196 A:middle
in a flight simulator

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.706 A:middle
or whatever else you
guys come up with.

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:52.586 A:middle
So, when we bring this two
together you have an amazing

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.886 A:middle
opportunity to thrill your users

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:57.666 A:middle
and give them an even
better experience

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.516 A:middle
and perhaps bringing
games to the next level.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
So, we have two parts.

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.566 A:middle
There's a hardware
specification by the MFi program

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:11.456 A:middle
which makes sure that
hardware is consistent

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
so you're users know
what they're going to get

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.216 A:middle
and they know that what
they've purchased is going

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.256 A:middle
to work with your content.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.606 A:middle
There's also a software
framework

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:24.326 A:middle
which is what you will be
interacting with in order

00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:28.006 A:middle
to read inputs from this
controllers and this ensures

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.036 A:middle
that with the hardware
specification

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:32.176 A:middle
and the software
specification you know

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:35.436 A:middle
that the controller you have
testing with is going to work

00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.696 A:middle
with the controller that
you use or is using.

00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:42.036 A:middle
And this is obviously
for iOS and OS X.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:46.086 A:middle
So, to talk about the
actual controllers

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.866 A:middle
and MFi specification I'd like
to invite Edwin Foo up on stage.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.966 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:02.436 A:middle
Good afternoon everybody.

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:07.776 A:middle
I'm Edwin from our accessories
engineering team and I'm really,

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:10.716 A:middle
really excited to
be up here talking--

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:13.306 A:middle
to talk to you of today
about the hardware component

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:15.476 A:middle
of this feature that
worse in conjunction

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:16.566 A:middle
with the software component

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.906 A:middle
that Jacques' team
has worked so hard on.

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:21.256 A:middle
And it's-- in our
opinion I think we--

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:23.686 A:middle
it's a really good thing that we
have brought this two together

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:26.246 A:middle
just like we do for our own
products this [inaudible]

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:27.656 A:middle
of hardware and software.

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:30.496 A:middle
And so, for the next few
minutes I'm going to share

00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:35.176 A:middle
with you game developers in the
audience what you'll be able

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:37.856 A:middle
to expect from MFi
game controllers.

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
So, to start off with,
when we sat down I thought

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.596 A:middle
about the hardware
specification controllers.

00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:46.986 A:middle
We had two goals in line.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:51.746 A:middle
First, we wanted to make sure
that your users will be able

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:55.366 A:middle
to go out there and buy any MFi
game controller with this badge

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:58.516 A:middle
on it what the-- behind
me on this screen here.

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:02.426 A:middle
And buy with confidence
knowing that it will work

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:06.046 A:middle
with all your games and
quite frankly all games

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.606 A:middle
on the App Store that work with
the game controller framework.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.956 A:middle
They was-- we don't want there
to be any ambiguity about this.

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:16.966 A:middle
And in turn, what this does
is it enables you the game

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:20.286 A:middle
developers to focus on making
great games and not have

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:22.316 A:middle
to worry about dealing
with all the differences

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:25.456 A:middle
between the controllers
and how do I code to deal

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:29.336 A:middle
with idiosyncrasies of
controller A from company A

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.416 A:middle
and controller B from company B.

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
We want this to be a
benefit to you too.

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle
And for those of you in the
audience we have a closet full

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:38.666 A:middle
of controllers that you
bought throughout the years

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:39.826 A:middle
to test with your games.

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:41.576 A:middle
Well, you don't need
that anymore.

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:44.356 A:middle
You only need to buy
one MFi controller,

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
get your game working
with it and go publish.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:52.976 A:middle
So, what will you
be able to expect

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:54.536 A:middle
from MFi and game controllers?

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:58.246 A:middle
Well, it all starts with
consistent control layouts.

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:01.866 A:middle
We've defined three
which I'll be going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:03.996 A:middle
into in the next
couple of slides.

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:06.916 A:middle
But these layouts
are all the same.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:08.106 A:middle
You will not-- they
have to worry

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:10.086 A:middle
about whether controls
are missing a button

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.346 A:middle
that you need for
a game to work.

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.756 A:middle
The controllers will
be transport agnostic.

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:18.626 A:middle
So, they may use both wired
and wireless creativity options

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:22.856 A:middle
but they will still report
changes in control of state

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:27.256 A:middle
and button state to your game
at a consistent and fast rates.

00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:32.546 A:middle
All the buttons on MFi game
controllers will be pressure

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:34.936 A:middle
sensitive, every single one.

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:38.826 A:middle
And because we have
this ability in the--

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:41.526 A:middle
through via the MFi
program to set a standard

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:44.316 A:middle
for both mechanical, electrical

00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:46.836 A:middle
and firmware requirements
all the buttons will have a

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:51.496 A:middle
consistent mechanical feel and
this maybe important to some

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:52.456 A:middle
of you in the audience as well.

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:57.516 A:middle
That-- but that's not all,
we also know that thumbsticks

00:05:57.516 --> 00:06:01.246 A:middle
and D-pads have they're
definitely been a topic

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:03.686 A:middle
that were-- has required a lot
of time in the past when working

00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:07.096 A:middle
on games mainly because not
all of them are created equal.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:10.526 A:middle
Some of them drift, some of them
have dead zones, varying sizes,

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:14.926 A:middle
some of them won't-- can't even
let you actually use the entire

00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:17.646 A:middle
area when you roll
your finger around.

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:21.746 A:middle
You won't need to worry that
with MFi game controllers.

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:24.516 A:middle
You can depend on and
trust that the controllers

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:28.846 A:middle
that you see here on these
controllers will work

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.346 A:middle
consistently in a
game regardless

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:33.626 A:middle
of whatever code
password you may take.

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:38.186 A:middle
And-- but of course, we will
still see a lot of variation

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:40.966 A:middle
in terms of industrial design
and color choices and that sort

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
of thing and that's perfectly
fine we want to see that,

00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:45.876 A:middle
we want-- I'm sure your users
will appreciate having those

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:51.826 A:middle
options as well, but the
core behavior and the way

00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:54.166 A:middle
that this controllers work is
something that you can trust

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.176 A:middle
and depend on to be consistent.

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:57.546 A:middle
So, let's talk about the
first controller type.

00:06:57.586 --> 00:07:02.346 A:middle
What you see here is a
form-fitting standard gamepad.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:05.016 A:middle
So, let me explain the
terminology a little bit.

00:07:05.426 --> 00:07:06.806 A:middle
By forfeiting what I mean is

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:09.756 A:middle
that the gamepad physically
in cases the device.

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:11.806 A:middle
So, forfeiting is a
fancy word for case.

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:15.766 A:middle
The key takeaway here though
for our US game developer is

00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:18.686 A:middle
that it means that the user
can still touch the screen.

00:07:19.386 --> 00:07:21.546 A:middle
And there was API and the
game controller framework

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
for your game to check
and know for certain

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:26.526 A:middle
that yes the user can't
still touch the screen.

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.626 A:middle
Therefore, you can take
advantage of that if you

00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:34.086 A:middle
like to create this hybrid
experience of Multi-Touch

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:37.246 A:middle
and tackle buttons
on controllers

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:39.406 A:middle
that Jacques just spoke about.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:45.846 A:middle
The standard gamepad has a one
directional pad in the left,

00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:50.356 A:middle
it will always be on the
left 1 ABXY face button group

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:51.806 A:middle
that will always be on the right

00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:54.356 A:middle
and will always have
these color designs with.

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:59.276 A:middle
And one row shoulder
buttons L and R.

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:02.006 A:middle
You also see a little
pause button there

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:03.816 A:middle
which will be present in
all three controller types

00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:06.876 A:middle
but that will be spoken about
in detail a little bit later

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:07.326 A:middle
in this session.

00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:13.116 A:middle
From the form-fitting
standard gamepad we go

00:08:13.116 --> 00:08:15.016 A:middle
to the form-fitting
extended gamepad.

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:22.076 A:middle
And that adds two Thumbsticks
on either side and an extra set

00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:24.896 A:middle
of triggers right below the
left and right shoulder buttons.

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:28.996 A:middle
And you can see there that the
labeling changes as well from L

00:08:28.996 --> 00:08:31.906 A:middle
and R to L1, L2 and R1, R2.

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:36.756 A:middle
You can depend on that, all of
them will be labeled this way.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:39.426 A:middle
So, as you point out that just

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.806 A:middle
because the extended
gamepad exist does not mean

00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:44.676 A:middle
that you have to take
advantage of all the controls.

00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:48.566 A:middle
This is something that you as
a game designer get to pick.

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.206 A:middle
And we fully expect that
there will be some games

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:54.986 A:middle
that when hooked up to an
extended gamepad don't use the

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:56.606 A:middle
extra controls, that's
perfectly OK.

00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:04.846 A:middle
Last but not least is the
standalone extended gamepad.

00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:09.186 A:middle
And standalone means that it
is not attached to the device.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.816 A:middle
That's it, it doesn't
have to be complicated.

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:13.816 A:middle
The important thing here is

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:16.436 A:middle
that all standalone
gamepads are extended.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.126 A:middle
They will have the thumbsticks

00:09:18.406 --> 00:09:19.836 A:middle
and they will all
have the triggers.

00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:21.416 A:middle
So, remember that.

00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:23.626 A:middle
And also keep in mind

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
that standalone gamepads will
have the player ID indicators

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.846 A:middle
as you can see there are a
little four dots in the middle.

00:09:31.846 --> 00:09:34.176 A:middle
And again, later
in the session one

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:36.066 A:middle
of the colleagues will be
explaining how to take advantage

00:09:36.066 --> 00:09:39.066 A:middle
of those for your game.

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:40.486 A:middle
So, let's recap.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:43.166 A:middle
There are three controller types

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:47.496 A:middle
for MFi game controllers
starting with the standard,

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:52.036 A:middle
form-fitting gamepad, the
extended form-fitting gamepad

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:56.166 A:middle
and the extended
standalone gamepad.

00:09:57.256 --> 00:09:58.296 A:middle
All right.

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
So, some of you in the audience
may actually be interested

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.466 A:middle
in making MFi game controllers.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:05.086 A:middle
And if so, this is
the slide for you.

00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:09.426 A:middle
As Jacques explained earlier and
as you heard during the state

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:13.606 A:middle
of the union address MFi
game controllers will need

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:16.846 A:middle
manufacturers to
join the MFi program.

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:17.946 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:21.826 A:middle
Go to the URL you see here
on the slide, sign up here

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:23.166 A:middle
with your company information.

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:26.876 A:middle
And, you know, and
then you'll be hearing

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.466 A:middle
from our presenter fairly soon.

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:33.656 A:middle
Access to the MFi program
grants technical information

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:35.066 A:middle
such as the specification

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.516 A:middle
that we have put together
concerning MFi game controllers.

00:10:38.256 --> 00:10:41.406 A:middle
Hardware components such as the
lightning connector that some

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:43.706 A:middle
of you may choose to use
in your game controller.

00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:48.136 A:middle
Test tools, technical
support and last

00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:51.866 A:middle
but not least certification
procedures that you

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:54.616 A:middle
as a controller manufacturer
will use when it comes time

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:56.676 A:middle
to get ready to bring
your product to market.

00:10:57.666 --> 00:11:01.066 A:middle
Once your product passes
certification then you will get

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:05.856 A:middle
to-- go to market and use
those logos compatibility icons

00:11:05.856 --> 00:11:08.786 A:middle
that all of the mutual
customers know how to recognize.

00:11:11.536 --> 00:11:16.736 A:middle
So, now I'm pretty sure or
I guess you can take a guess

00:11:16.736 --> 00:11:19.596 A:middle
that the varying questions
everyone in mind at this point

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.426 A:middle
in time is when will see
MFi game controllers?

00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:26.556 A:middle
Well, I can help you
answer that right now.

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:28.766 A:middle
We have already been
working with key partners.

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:32.326 A:middle
You can see two of them on
the slide Logitech and Moga

00:11:32.946 --> 00:11:35.136 A:middle
and they-- let me assure you

00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:38.526 A:middle
that they are working very
diligently to bring controllers

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.556 A:middle
to market later this fall.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.496 A:middle
In fact, in the [inaudible]
downstairs

00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:46.886 A:middle
as what's previously
mentioned you will find

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:50.986 A:middle
that there are some prototype
Logitech controllers already

00:11:50.986 --> 00:11:52.856 A:middle
out there for you--
for you game developers

00:11:52.856 --> 00:11:53.556 A:middle
to start working with.

00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:58.006 A:middle
So, you can't say that we're
slowing you down on this.

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
You know, get started
they're right there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:04.976 A:middle
And quite frankly we can't
wait to see what all of you

00:12:05.336 --> 00:12:06.336 A:middle
in the audience come up with.

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:09.086 A:middle
We're' really excited and hope
that you'll be willing to walk

00:12:09.086 --> 00:12:09.946 A:middle
down this road with us.

00:12:10.906 --> 00:12:12.616 A:middle
And so at this point,
I want to hand things

00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:15.376 A:middle
over to my colleague JJ so
he can talk to you about how

00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:16.176 A:middle
to connect the controllers.

00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:16.976 A:middle
Thanks everyone.

00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:24.996 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:26.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Edwin.

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:29.186 A:middle
So, let's talk about the
software and how you're going

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:31.496 A:middle
to be interacting with the
game controller framework.

00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:36.266 A:middle
What I'm going to be talking
to you about is an overview

00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:39.096 A:middle
of a commonly used class in
the game controller framework.

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:43.006 A:middle
And then we're talking about how
to handle controllers connecting

00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:44.746 A:middle
and disconnecting
from your devices.

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.576 A:middle
Now, this is a reality
players are going to connect

00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:50.076 A:middle
and disconnect controllers
in your game and you're going

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.506 A:middle
to want to handle
those appropriately.

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:56.776 A:middle
I'm also going to talk about
how to read controller inputs.

00:12:57.006 --> 00:13:00.376 A:middle
So, once your game knows which
controller or controllers it has

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.566 --> 00:13:03.486 A:middle
to access how do you actually
read what the thumbsitck

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:04.056 A:middle
position is?

00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:05.856 A:middle
How do you read what
player is pushing

00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:08.726 A:middle
as far as face buttons goes?

00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:11.906 A:middle
I'm also going to talk about
other important controls

00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:14.396 A:middle
on the controls like
the pause button

00:13:14.976 --> 00:13:18.636 A:middle
and the player indicator LEDs
and what your responsibilities

00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:21.376 A:middle
as game developers are with
regards to these controls.

00:13:22.716 --> 00:13:23.856 A:middle
And lastly, we're going to wrap

00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:26.076 A:middle
up by talking about
best practices.

00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:29.526 A:middle
How to take all this
technical information and think

00:13:29.526 --> 00:13:32.166 A:middle
about all this new
capabilities afforded to you

00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:35.066 A:middle
so that you can integrate
game controllers in a away

00:13:35.066 --> 00:13:36.416 A:middle
that makes your games
really special.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.236 A:middle
[ Pause ]

00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
So, the central class
you're going

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:44.716 A:middle
to be using a lot is
called GCController.

00:13:45.046 --> 00:13:47.016 A:middle
You're going to be using this
to connect to controllers

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:51.636 A:middle
and instances of this class
represent a connected controller

00:13:51.636 --> 00:13:52.356 A:middle
to your device.

00:13:53.336 --> 00:13:54.716 A:middle
Now, this is the same class

00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:57.826 A:middle
for all three supported
controller types.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.816 --> 00:14:03.066 A:middle
GCController has a
lot of capabilities.

00:14:03.746 --> 00:14:05.566 A:middle
It allows you to
find controllers.

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.876 A:middle
So, we have methods
so that you can query

00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:10.376 A:middle
which controllers are currently
connected to my device.

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:13.126 A:middle
Sometimes you might
want to be notified

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.736 A:middle
as controllers are
connected and disconnected

00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:17.746 A:middle
and we have ways for
you to know that.

00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:22.666 A:middle
And there's also ways for you
to discover wireless controllers

00:14:22.666 --> 00:14:24.516 A:middle
that haven't been used
with this device before.

00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:30.836 A:middle
GCController also
provides you ways

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:33.776 A:middle
to read the inputs
off of the device.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.696 A:middle
So, again, how you know where
the D-pad is being pressed,

00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:39.776 A:middle
thumbsticks, triggers and so on.

00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:43.306 A:middle
And lastly, it gives
you information

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:45.166 A:middle
about the controller whether

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:46.856 A:middle
or not it's a form-fitting
controller.

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.946 A:middle
The vendor who manufactured
this controller perhaps to show

00:14:50.946 --> 00:14:54.306 A:middle
in a player facing UI like
in a team picker dialogue.

00:14:54.976 --> 00:15:00.076 A:middle
And also gives you the player
index which is surfaced

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:03.906 A:middle
in the physical controller
via the player indicator LEDs.

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:08.936 A:middle
So, let's talk about
connecting and disconnecting.

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:13.516 A:middle
We have a class method called
controllers on GCController

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:15.646 A:middle
and this gives you an array

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:17.416 A:middle
of the currently
connected controllers.

00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:21.456 A:middle
The array instances or the
array elements are instances

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:22.896 A:middle
of type GCController.

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:26.906 A:middle
And if there are no currently
connected controllers then this

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:28.066 A:middle
array will return empty.

00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:33.466 A:middle
Now, the beauty of this is that
controllers as they're connected

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:36.976 A:middle
and disconnected this
method automatically update

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:37.966 A:middle
that information for you.

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:39.956 A:middle
So, you can be guaranteed

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:43.706 A:middle
that whenever you call this
method you have a current idea

00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:45.316 A:middle
of which controllers
are connected.

00:15:45.556 --> 00:15:49.476 A:middle
Let's look at a code example.

00:15:49.886 --> 00:15:51.626 A:middle
A lot of games will choose

00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:55.406 A:middle
to have a central method that's
called throughout their game

00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:57.976 A:middle
and it resolves new
controllers that come in.

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.966 A:middle
And in this example
we're calling

00:15:59.966 --> 00:16:01.736 A:middle
that method set up controllers.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:04.186 A:middle
The first thing we
do at the top of set

00:16:04.186 --> 00:16:06.996 A:middle
up controllers is we call
the controllers class method.

00:16:07.036 --> 00:16:09.506 A:middle
And we take all the currently
connected controllers

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:12.146 A:middle
and we cache them into our
controller array property.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:17.496 A:middle
Then based on whether or not
we have controllers we can

00:16:17.496 --> 00:16:18.006 A:middle
take action.

00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:21.406 A:middle
Keep this method in
mind set up controllers.

00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:28.676 A:middle
I'm going to be referring to it
throughout the rest of the talk.

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:30.426 A:middle
Sometimes you don't want to be--

00:16:31.026 --> 00:16:32.016 A:middle
sometimes you don't want

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:34.586 A:middle
to necessarily ask what
controllers are currently

00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:37.086 A:middle
connected right now rather
you want to be notified

00:16:37.086 --> 00:16:39.296 A:middle
when a controller
connects and disconnects.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.836 A:middle
And we provide capabilities for
you to get notified of that.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:46.756 A:middle
Using NSNotificationCenter
you can add observers

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:50.576 A:middle
when called GCController
did connect notification.

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:54.106 A:middle
This is for obviously detecting
when controllers connect.

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:57.476 A:middle
Similarly, to be notified

00:16:57.476 --> 00:17:01.066 A:middle
when a controller disconnects
we have GCController did

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:02.446 A:middle
disconnect notification.

00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:05.185 A:middle
You'll notice in this example,

00:17:05.846 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
the selector we've chosen is
our set up controller's method

00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:10.386 A:middle
that you saw on the
previous screen.

00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:13.776 A:middle
So, as controllers are connected
and disconnected we're going

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:15.606 A:middle
to be funneling back
into that method.

00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:24.636 A:middle
Now, some controllers are going
to be wireless and these types

00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:26.646 A:middle
of controllers need
to be discovered

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:29.416 A:middle
and paired before the
first time they're used

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.616 A:middle
with a particular device.

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.366 A:middle
These generally only
needs to happen once.

00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:38.246 A:middle
Once the user has paired
a wireless controller

00:17:38.316 --> 00:17:41.816 A:middle
with the device then after
that the controller will

00:17:41.816 --> 00:17:43.996 A:middle
automatically be recognized
and we don't need to go

00:17:44.066 --> 00:17:46.486 A:middle
through this discovery
paring process again.

00:17:48.266 --> 00:17:51.536 A:middle
So, as game developers you
can afford a convenience

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:53.346 A:middle
to your players and allow them

00:17:53.346 --> 00:17:54.746 A:middle
to do this rate within
your game.

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:57.026 A:middle
This is great for players

00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:59.656 A:middle
who have just unboxed their
brand new controller and go

00:17:59.656 --> 00:18:01.966 A:middle
to your game first
and don't have to--

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.646 A:middle
or rather they can
jump into the game

00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:05.826 A:middle
without having to
leave your game.

00:18:06.426 --> 00:18:10.346 A:middle
So, you can just initiate
this discovery process

00:18:10.516 --> 00:18:13.526 A:middle
with the method that we call
start wireless controller

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:15.256 A:middle
discovery with completion
handler.

00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:19.026 A:middle
When you call this
wireless discovery kicks off

00:18:19.026 --> 00:18:21.906 A:middle
asynchronously and it doesn't
block you're able to go

00:18:21.906 --> 00:18:24.966 A:middle
about your business and your
app can remain responsive.

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:29.706 A:middle
And whenever the discovery
process finishes your supplied

00:18:29.706 --> 00:18:31.016 A:middle
completion handler is called.

00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:34.506 A:middle
And it's called in one
of three situations.

00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:37.756 A:middle
One, either all the controllers
have been discovered.

00:18:39.206 --> 00:18:44.646 A:middle
Two, the discovery process
has timed-out or three,

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:48.436 A:middle
you've explicitly told it to
stop early, and if you decide

00:18:48.436 --> 00:18:51.656 A:middle
to do that you can do so via
the stop wireless controller

00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:52.496 A:middle
discovery method.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:55.956 A:middle
Now, you're going
to want to use this

00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:57.816 A:middle
in conjunction with
notifications.

00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:03.276 A:middle
So, as you kickoff the wireless
discovery process the discovery

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:05.296 A:middle
is happening asynchronously
in the background

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:08.706 A:middle
and while that's happening and
controllers are being discovered

00:19:08.706 --> 00:19:11.146 A:middle
and paired notifications fire.

00:19:11.246 --> 00:19:13.396 A:middle
And so, if you set up the
notifications that I showed you

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:16.166 A:middle
on the previous slide that
will be happened automatically.

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.996 A:middle
So, you can see we're
building this in layers.

00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:23.006 A:middle
Let's look at a code example.

00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:26.316 A:middle
In this example, we've
arbitrarily chosen

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:29.836 A:middle
that the user-- we're going
to allow the user the ability

00:19:29.866 --> 00:19:31.936 A:middle
to start the wireless
discovery themselves.

00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:33.656 A:middle
So, maybe the user hits a button

00:19:33.656 --> 00:19:36.806 A:middle
in your interface say the
first thing we do is start

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
up a spinner so that
the user knows

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:40.616 A:middle
that they're input
action has been accepted

00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:43.326 A:middle
and we kickoff the start
wireless controller discovery

00:19:43.326 --> 00:19:44.676 A:middle
with completion handler method.

00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:47.436 A:middle
Now, again, this
happens asynchronously,

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:50.556 A:middle
and whenever it returns
we can take action

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.446 A:middle
and the first thing we're doing

00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:53.076 A:middle
in this case is we're
stopping our spinner.

00:19:54.046 --> 00:19:56.296 A:middle
Since we're affording
the users the ability

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.346 A:middle
to start this process themselves
we should also provide them a

00:19:59.346 --> 00:20:00.906 A:middle
way to cancel it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:04.826 A:middle
And you do that again
by calling stop wireless

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:05.726 A:middle
controller discovery.

00:20:06.876 --> 00:20:09.276 A:middle
You'll note that this method
doesn't take a completion

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:12.686 A:middle
handler because when this is
called the completion handler

00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:15.016 A:middle
in the start method
above is called for you.

00:20:15.926 --> 00:20:18.746 A:middle
And it's safe to call stop
wireless controller discovery

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:21.706 A:middle
even if your start wireless
controller discovery handler has

00:20:21.706 --> 00:20:22.236 A:middle
already called.

00:20:26.656 --> 00:20:28.786 A:middle
Now, I have a few
caveats to mention

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:31.146 A:middle
to you regarding
connecting and disconnecting.

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:37.446 A:middle
Controllers take time to be
recognized on app start up.

00:20:38.316 --> 00:20:39.566 A:middle
Now, the framework does this

00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:41.806 A:middle
for you asynchronously
and automatically.

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:44.616 A:middle
But one of the side effects is

00:20:44.616 --> 00:20:47.486 A:middle
that the controllers
class method is going

00:20:47.486 --> 00:20:51.086 A:middle
to be empty inside of
application did finish launching

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:53.726 A:middle
for options with options.

00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:58.646 A:middle
But this is OK, if you setup
your notifications there

00:20:59.006 --> 00:21:01.666 A:middle
for controllers connecting
and disconnecting inside

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.066 A:middle
of application did
finish launching

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:05.186 A:middle
with options you're
guaranteed not

00:21:05.186 --> 00:21:07.026 A:middle
to miss any connections
and disconnections.

00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:10.956 A:middle
Now, we recognize there
are some games out there

00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:15.546 A:middle
who might have large engines
or a lot of art assets to load.

00:21:15.546 --> 00:21:18.686 A:middle
And their not ready
to start listening

00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:21.106 A:middle
for controller notifications
inside

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:23.176 A:middle
of application did finish
launching with options.

00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:24.566 A:middle
And that's OK.

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:28.126 A:middle
You can call-- you can setup
your notifications whenever make

00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:29.156 A:middle
sense for your game.

00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:33.036 A:middle
Just make sure right before that
you call the controllers array

00:21:33.336 --> 00:21:34.766 A:middle
so you capture any controllers

00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:36.846 A:middle
which may have already
been connected.

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.866 A:middle
All right, so now we have
controllers that are connected

00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:46.486 A:middle
and we're ready to read the
input off of those controllers.

00:21:47.886 --> 00:21:50.296 A:middle
Now, you recall we have
three supported physical

00:21:50.296 --> 00:21:51.276 A:middle
controller types.

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:53.816 A:middle
And the way these are mapped

00:21:53.816 --> 00:21:57.066 A:middle
in the software are via
what we call profiles.

00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:02.136 A:middle
So, the standard gamepad has
a standard gamepad profile.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:09.626 A:middle
And the two extended gamepads
share a single profile

00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:12.036 A:middle
that we call he extended
gamepad profile.

00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:16.796 A:middle
Now, the standard gamepad
profile that's why the standard

00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:18.946 A:middle
gamepad has four face buttons,

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.466 A:middle
two shoulder buttons
and a D-pad.

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:23.286 A:middle
And the way these are mapped

00:22:23.286 --> 00:22:26.086 A:middle
in the software are via
properties on the gamepad.

00:22:26.816 --> 00:22:30.326 A:middle
So, you have button A,
button B, button X, button Y.

00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:34.406 A:middle
Left shoulder, right
shoulder and D-pad.

00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:39.396 A:middle
Now, the standard gamepad
profile is a property called

00:22:39.496 --> 00:22:41.776 A:middle
gamepad on controllers.

00:22:42.216 --> 00:22:43.866 A:middle
You can see that listed
up in the subheading.

00:22:43.866 --> 00:22:50.106 A:middle
Moving on to the extended
gamepads you will recall these

00:22:50.106 --> 00:22:53.466 A:middle
add two thumbsticks
and two triggers on top

00:22:53.466 --> 00:22:55.286 A:middle
of the standard gamepad.

00:22:55.896 --> 00:23:01.366 A:middle
And here highlighted in yellow
you can see the extra properties

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:01.366 --> 00:23:03.156 A:middle
on the extended gamepad profile.

00:23:03.766 --> 00:23:08.906 A:middle
Now, the standard gamepad
is going to be supported

00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:11.036 A:middle
by all controllers regardless

00:23:11.336 --> 00:23:13.026 A:middle
of whether it's a
standard controller

00:23:13.296 --> 00:23:14.446 A:middle
or an extended controller.

00:23:14.806 --> 00:23:18.756 A:middle
So, you as software developers
are guaranteed that as long

00:23:18.756 --> 00:23:20.636 A:middle
as your controller supports,

00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:24.086 A:middle
as long as your code supports
the standard gamepad all the

00:23:24.086 --> 00:23:27.586 A:middle
controllers that are used
with games will work.

00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:32.296 A:middle
With extended gamepads not every
controller will support the

00:23:32.296 --> 00:23:36.576 A:middle
extended gamepad profile namely
the standard gamepad obliviously

00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:37.656 A:middle
doesn't have thumbsticks.

00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:38.786 A:middle
It doesn't have triggers.

00:23:39.296 --> 00:23:40.556 A:middle
So, check this property,

00:23:40.556 --> 00:23:43.456 A:middle
check the extended gamepad
property on controllers.

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:45.096 A:middle
If it's new hat means

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:46.926 A:middle
that extended gamepads
are not supported.

00:23:47.026 --> 00:23:52.056 A:middle
I'd like to bring your attention
to the fact that thumbsticks

00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:55.306 A:middle
and D-pads while being two
totally physically separate

00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:58.816 A:middle
devices share a control
type direction pad.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:03.276 A:middle
Similarly, the triggers
and the face buttons

00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:06.266 A:middle
and the shoulder buttons all
share a button input type.

00:24:07.126 --> 00:24:10.006 A:middle
So, let's dive into these
various element types.

00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:14.346 A:middle
Buttons are represented
in our framework

00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:16.956 A:middle
by a class called
GCControllerButtonInput.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.806 A:middle
And they are treated

00:24:18.806 --> 00:24:21.666 A:middle
in the classic digital sense
whether they're pressed or not

00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:24.316 A:middle
with a bullion in the
framework called Pressed.

00:24:25.436 --> 00:24:28.276 A:middle
If this is true the button is
pressed, if not its not pressed.

00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:32.346 A:middle
But since our buttons are also
pressure sensitive you have the

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:36.666 A:middle
option of reading a value
property which returns a float.

00:24:36.916 --> 00:24:39.676 A:middle
This tells you how much force
that button is being pressed

00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.836 A:middle
with at the current moment.

00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:44.416 A:middle
And this is a float
normalized between zero and one.

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:49.646 A:middle
All right, let's talk about
GCControllerDirectionPad.

00:24:50.036 --> 00:24:53.246 A:middle
Again, this is shared across
multiple physical inputs

00:24:53.426 --> 00:24:55.936 A:middle
such as the D-pad
and the thumbstick.

00:24:56.066 --> 00:25:00.116 A:middle
And we give you options as
game developers to use these

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.116 --> 00:25:01.516 A:middle
in a way that suits your game.

00:25:02.236 --> 00:25:05.896 A:middle
So, you can read them as four
buttons up, down, left and right

00:25:06.956 --> 00:25:09.906 A:middle
or you can read them as two
axis, the xAxis and the yAxis.

00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:17.806 A:middle
If we look at the axis type
GCControllerAxisInput you will

00:25:17.806 --> 00:25:19.666 A:middle
note that it has
a value property.

00:25:20.356 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
And this tracks the
movement along that axis.

00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:27.136 A:middle
It's normalized from negative
one on one end to positive one

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:29.866 A:middle
on the other end
with zero in between.

00:25:30.786 --> 00:25:32.526 A:middle
Now, the hardware
spec guarantees

00:25:32.526 --> 00:25:36.916 A:middle
that any non-zero value is the
player intentionally moving the

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:38.706 A:middle
D-pad or the thumbstick away

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:40.046 A:middle
from the neutral
resting position.

00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.886 A:middle
So, for those of you in
the audience who are used

00:25:42.886 --> 00:25:44.426 A:middle
to programming your
own dead zones

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:46.636 A:middle
for controllers don't
do that here.

00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:49.786 A:middle
The hardware spec guarantees
a consistent dead zone

00:25:50.196 --> 00:25:51.526 A:middle
and if you add your
own dead zone

00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:54.696 A:middle
on top you're compromising the
crispiness of the controls.

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:59.736 A:middle
All right.

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how do
we actually read the values off

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:04.226 A:middle
of these controller inputs.

00:26:04.556 --> 00:26:06.986 A:middle
The first and probably most
common way that you're going

00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:08.466 A:middle
to be doing this is via Polling.

00:26:09.196 --> 00:26:11.856 A:middle
Polling allows you to find
out what the current value

00:26:11.856 --> 00:26:14.136 A:middle
of that controller
input is right now.

00:26:14.576 --> 00:26:18.526 A:middle
Using conjunction with polling
every game loop you can track

00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:21.136 A:middle
the movement of various
controller inputs

00:26:21.136 --> 00:26:23.116 A:middle
across various frames
of your game,

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:24.726 A:middle
things like thumbstick position.

00:26:25.156 --> 00:26:28.226 A:middle
Now, sometimes you don't want

00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:30.266 A:middle
to know what the current
value is right now.

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:32.656 A:middle
You want to be notified
when the value changes.

00:26:33.786 --> 00:26:38.396 A:middle
And to be notified of this you
can use value change call backs.

00:26:39.876 --> 00:26:42.346 A:middle
So, you can use this in
scenarios where you want

00:26:42.346 --> 00:26:45.196 A:middle
to be notified when the player
starts polling the right trigger

00:26:45.196 --> 00:26:45.816 A:middle
for instance.

00:26:46.076 --> 00:26:47.616 A:middle
Setup a value change call back

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:51.146 A:middle
and you'll be notified
when that happens.

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:54.736 A:middle
Lastly you can take snapshots
and snapshots are ways

00:26:54.736 --> 00:26:58.206 A:middle
of capturing the entire
controller state in one object.

00:26:59.736 --> 00:27:01.996 A:middle
You can use this for
a lot of useful things

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:04.166 A:middle
like recording button input.

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:08.056 A:middle
You can compare current
controller state this frame

00:27:08.056 --> 00:27:09.406 A:middle
to a previous frame.

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:11.216 A:middle
You can record input to send

00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:14.536 A:middle
across the wire to--
to record to a file.

00:27:14.536 --> 00:27:18.556 A:middle
Now, let's look at
some examples.

00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:21.296 A:middle
For polling like I said
you're typically going

00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:23.236 A:middle
to be doing this each
game loop iteration

00:27:23.996 --> 00:27:25.266 A:middle
and it's really just a simple

00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:27.766 A:middle
as reading the properties
off of the profiles.

00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:31.806 A:middle
So, in this first example
we have the standard gamepad

00:27:31.866 --> 00:27:33.126 A:middle
profile on the controller

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:36.386 A:middle
and from there we're showing
you two different ways

00:27:36.386 --> 00:27:38.126 A:middle
to read the states
of the Y button.

00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:42.516 A:middle
Next, we show an example

00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:45.996 A:middle
from the extended gamepad
profile three different ways

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:48.596 A:middle
on how to read the Y
axis thumbstick value.

00:27:49.256 --> 00:27:50.726 A:middle
You can treat it as a Y axis

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:56.526 A:middle
or you can read it
as the up button.

00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:59.966 A:middle
Now, here's a polling example
in context of game code.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:00.726 --> 00:28:01.896 A:middle
We've got our update method.

00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:03.926 A:middle
This is what's called
one each game loop.

00:28:04.856 --> 00:28:07.236 A:middle
And within there we grab the
profile off the controller,

00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:08.906 A:middle
the extended gamepad
in this case.

00:28:10.266 --> 00:28:13.406 A:middle
And all the while the right
trigger is being pressed we're

00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:14.576 A:middle
going to firing lasers.

00:28:15.626 --> 00:28:18.306 A:middle
While the left trigger is
being pressed we're going

00:28:18.306 --> 00:28:19.206 A:middle
to launch missiles.

00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:24.336 A:middle
And lastly, we're going to apply
thrust to our spaceship based

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:28.006 A:middle
on the current value of the
thumbsticks Y axis value.

00:28:33.356 --> 00:28:36.916 A:middle
Now, value change
handlers are accomplished

00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:38.096 A:middle
by passing in a block.

00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:40.696 A:middle
So, you choose which
controller element you want

00:28:40.696 --> 00:28:42.416 A:middle
to be notified when it changes.

00:28:42.606 --> 00:28:46.046 A:middle
And you also pass a block
of code that runs whenever

00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:47.926 A:middle
that value does happen
to change.

00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:51.116 A:middle
The framework is constantly
updating the profiles

00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:53.226 A:middle
on the main thread
at sixty hertz.

00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:57.586 A:middle
And we'll notify any value
change handlers you have setup.

00:28:58.186 --> 00:29:01.256 A:middle
Now, handlers can be
registered on specific elements

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:01.466 --> 00:29:02.896 A:middle
such as individual buttons.

00:29:03.886 --> 00:29:06.136 A:middle
They can be registered on
collections of elements

00:29:06.316 --> 00:29:10.506 A:middle
such as the D-pad or thumbsticks
or they can be registered

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:12.766 A:middle
on the entire controller
profile itself.

00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:14.486 A:middle
So, you can be notified
when anything

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
on the controller changes.

00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:17.576 A:middle
Here's an example.

00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:20.946 A:middle
So, again we grab the
profile off of the controller.

00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:24.216 A:middle
And this is an alternate way

00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:26.786 A:middle
of firing our lasers whenever
the right trigger is pressed.

00:29:27.176 --> 00:29:28.076 A:middle
So, we get a value--

00:29:28.076 --> 00:29:32.106 A:middle
value change handler which calls
us whenever the right trigger's

00:29:32.106 --> 00:29:33.046 A:middle
position changes.

00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:36.556 A:middle
When it does we check if
the button is pressed and if

00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:37.896 A:middle
so we fire our lasers.

00:29:37.896 --> 00:29:41.646 A:middle
Let's look at another example.

00:29:41.966 --> 00:29:48.016 A:middle
You can share a single handler
among several-- several inputs.

00:29:48.516 --> 00:29:50.806 A:middle
So, in this case we're
implementing a touch any button

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:51.386 A:middle
to continue.

00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:53.636 A:middle
We grab the profile.

00:29:53.636 --> 00:29:57.536 A:middle
We setup our handler which we're
calling myFaceButtonsHandler.

00:29:58.266 --> 00:30:00.896 A:middle
And then we assign
that handler to each

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
of the four face buttons.

00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:06.506 A:middle
When any of them are
pressed the code runs

00:30:06.506 --> 00:30:10.696 A:middle
and we dismiss the
UI in this case.

00:30:10.886 --> 00:30:13.706 A:middle
Lastly, an example on how to
setup value change handlers

00:30:13.706 --> 00:30:14.956 A:middle
on collections of elements.

00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:21.016 A:middle
In this case whenever the
right thumbstick is moved we

00:30:21.016 --> 00:30:22.156 A:middle
get notified.

00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:24.076 A:middle
This is good for situation
where you might want

00:30:24.076 --> 00:30:26.526 A:middle
to say move the right
thumbstick to look around

00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:31.656 A:middle
and be notified when
that happens.

00:30:31.656 --> 00:30:35.226 A:middle
Now, value change handlers are
called in a hierarchical order

00:30:35.886 --> 00:30:39.466 A:middle
from individual elements
through the collections and on,

00:30:39.466 --> 00:30:41.126 A:middle
up into the controller itself.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:44.656 A:middle
So, example of a
D-pad being pressed.

00:30:46.116 --> 00:30:47.606 A:middle
First the framework checks

00:30:47.606 --> 00:30:49.486 A:middle
if there are any
value change handlers

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:51.566 A:middle
on the four face buttons--

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:53.716 A:middle
or sorry, the four buttons
that represent the D-pad.

00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:55.866 A:middle
If so those are called.

00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:59.386 A:middle
Then it goes through the
two axis on the D-pad.

00:30:59.746 --> 00:31:01.496 A:middle
If you have setup
value change handlers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:01.496 --> 00:31:03.446 A:middle
for those they are
called as well.

00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:07.076 A:middle
Then it calls the value change
handler on the D-pad itself

00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:09.336 A:middle
if you've assigned
one and lastly

00:31:09.336 --> 00:31:10.616 A:middle
on to the controller profile.

00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:15.416 A:middle
All right.

00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:16.846 A:middle
Let's talk about snapshots now.

00:31:17.236 --> 00:31:21.266 A:middle
Snapshots allow us to collect
the entire current controller's

00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:22.906 A:middle
state in one object.

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:27.536 A:middle
And we allow you to
move the data from to

00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:30.536 A:middle
and from NSData Objects
very easily via methods

00:31:30.536 --> 00:31:31.716 A:middle
that I'll show you in a moment.

00:31:32.476 --> 00:31:34.476 A:middle
And once you have an
NSData Representation

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.876 A:middle
of the snapshot you can do
whatever you want with it.

00:31:36.876 --> 00:31:37.946 A:middle
You can start to file.

00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:39.186 A:middle
You can start to URL.

00:31:39.526 --> 00:31:41.036 A:middle
You can unpack it after that.

00:31:42.196 --> 00:31:44.616 A:middle
Snapshots are also
mutable so in addition

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:49.096 A:middle
to recording a controller input
you can retrieve controller

00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:51.516 A:middle
input and assign it
back into a snapshot.

00:31:52.056 --> 00:31:55.516 A:middle
Now, you're going to want to
use snapshots in conjunction

00:31:55.516 --> 00:31:57.886 A:middle
with polling or value
change handlers.

00:31:58.326 --> 00:31:59.546 A:middle
So, in your main game loop

00:31:59.546 --> 00:32:02.336 A:middle
as your polling you could be
collecting snapshots each frame

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:05.906 A:middle
or inside your value change
handlers you could be collecting

00:32:05.906 --> 00:32:06.906 A:middle
snapshots as well.

00:32:07.846 --> 00:32:11.486 A:middle
This is great for recording
controller input, for sending it

00:32:11.486 --> 00:32:14.206 A:middle
over a network, for various
debugging activities.

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:17.486 A:middle
Let's look at us a controller--
or sorry, a snapshot example.

00:32:18.226 --> 00:32:20.426 A:middle
So, in this example we're
going to take a snapshot

00:32:20.426 --> 00:32:21.866 A:middle
and write it to a file.

00:32:22.896 --> 00:32:25.816 A:middle
To do that we call the
save snapshot method

00:32:26.246 --> 00:32:27.656 A:middle
on the gamepad profile.

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:31.716 A:middle
This gives us our snapshot
object GCGamepadSnapshot.

00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:36.706 A:middle
Then we use a method on
GCGamepadSnapshot called--

00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:38.846 A:middle
or a property called
snapshotData

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:43.436 A:middle
and that gives us the NSData
representation of the snapshot

00:32:43.436 --> 00:32:46.726 A:middle
and then using NSData we
can go ahead and write

00:32:46.726 --> 00:32:48.296 A:middle
that snapshot to a file.

00:32:49.456 --> 00:32:51.156 A:middle
Let's look at an example
going to the other way.

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:54.656 A:middle
So, in this case we provide
a file and we use NSData

00:32:54.656 --> 00:32:56.416 A:middle
to retrieve that file.

00:32:56.986 --> 00:33:01.306 A:middle
And then we go ahead and
initialize a snapshot object

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:01.426 --> 00:33:04.686 A:middle
with that using our
initWithSnapshotData method.

00:33:07.716 --> 00:33:10.336 A:middle
And now I think its
time for a demo.

00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:14.346 A:middle
So, I'd to call Jacques back up
on stage and Tomash from Crytek.

00:33:15.176 --> 00:33:18.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:18.936 --> 00:33:22.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:26.536 A:middle
This is a demo of
integrating controllers based

00:33:26.536 --> 00:33:29.656 A:middle
on all upcoming games
called the Collectibles

00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:31.566 A:middle
which will be released
later this year.

00:33:34.116 --> 00:33:37.666 A:middle
The framework integration
was easy.

00:33:37.926 --> 00:33:44.846 A:middle
There was no need to adjust
to dead zones or drifting.

00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:46.226 A:middle
It just works.

00:33:46.376 --> 00:33:48.716 A:middle
So, today I would like
to talk about design.

00:33:49.456 --> 00:33:55.076 A:middle
We have a great touch base
navigation and cover bionics.

00:33:55.636 --> 00:33:59.106 A:middle
And it was a fun challenge to
extend them to controllers.

00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:01.366 A:middle
Let's take the navigation first.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:02.966 --> 00:34:05.876 A:middle
With touch controls the player
can either move the characters

00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:12.255 A:middle
individually by throwing a bat
or as a squad by double tapping.

00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:17.866 A:middle
For controllers we
take the solution

00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:25.636 A:middle
to extend squad movement with
D-pad based direct control.

00:34:26.985 --> 00:34:31.835 A:middle
To find the cover with touch
controlled the player have

00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:41.766 A:middle
to draw a path for controllers
we created a slightly

00:34:41.826 --> 00:34:42.966 A:middle
different dynamic.

00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:47.106 A:middle
The players can choose
from four directions

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.936 A:middle
and the system automatically
send the characters

00:34:51.096 --> 00:34:55.206 A:middle
to the best possible
cover in that area.

00:34:56.896 --> 00:35:00.876 A:middle
In complicated situations the
player can still use the touch

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:00.876 --> 00:35:04.046 A:middle
control and move individual
characters to cover.

00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:11.096 A:middle
And I think we should call
in the-- the gun ship.

00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:14.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.

00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:19.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yup. This is a great example

00:35:19.316 --> 00:35:23.526 A:middle
where the user can
simultaneously use the

00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:25.876 A:middle
controller and the
touch control.

00:35:26.286 --> 00:35:31.026 A:middle
Use the D-pad to move
the gun ship target

00:35:31.026 --> 00:35:33.456 A:middle
and in the same time
use the touch screen

00:35:33.676 --> 00:35:34.916 A:middle
to navigate the characters.

00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:43.246 A:middle
In this demo the controller
joins the touch control

00:35:43.646 --> 00:35:45.626 A:middle
and they fit together naturally.

00:35:45.866 --> 00:35:46.756 A:middle
I hope you like that.

00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:51.956 A:middle
I have to know-- know that
this was only a technical

00:35:51.956 --> 00:35:54.696 A:middle
demonstration with some
nice graphics and only

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:58.556 A:middle
with two game mechanics from all
upcoming game, the Collectibles.

00:36:06.966 --> 00:36:07.626 A:middle
under the hood here.

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:11.986 A:middle
So, here we have a very
simplistic view of a gamepad.

00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:14.486 A:middle
So, you see the D-pad on
the left, the face buttons

00:36:14.486 --> 00:36:16.606 A:middle
on the right with
the correct colors

00:36:17.066 --> 00:36:18.456 A:middle
and the two shoulder buttons.

00:36:18.716 --> 00:36:22.716 A:middle
So, as I press the D-pad you
notice I can detect the four

00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:25.146 A:middle
cardinal and the four
inter cardinal directions.

00:36:25.146 --> 00:36:27.746 A:middle
I can also just take
the pressure right now.

00:36:27.746 --> 00:36:29.866 A:middle
So, you I' pushing the
left as hard as I can.

00:36:29.866 --> 00:36:31.686 A:middle
I can also push it less hard.

00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:35.886 A:middle
So, you there's a float
value between zero and one

00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:37.136 A:middle
for the direction I'm pushing.

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:41.026 A:middle
This actually allows
you to get 360 degrees

00:36:41.416 --> 00:36:42.846 A:middle
of analog input on the D-pad.

00:36:44.106 --> 00:36:45.536 A:middle
The same applies to face buttons

00:36:45.706 --> 00:36:48.926 A:middle
so as I press A you
notice first it's pressed

00:36:48.926 --> 00:36:51.986 A:middle
and I can press it harder
enlarging the circle there is,

00:36:52.756 --> 00:36:55.426 A:middle
B the same, X and Y

00:36:56.386 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
and of course the shoulder
buttons too, right and left.

00:37:00.756 --> 00:37:03.946 A:middle
And that's how easy that is.

00:37:04.546 --> 00:37:04.886 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:37:08.336 --> 00:37:10.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, let's talk about
a few additional controls,

00:37:11.086 --> 00:37:13.796 A:middle
the pause button and the
player indicator LED's.

00:37:14.886 --> 00:37:18.086 A:middle
Now, the hardware
spec guarantees

00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:20.146 A:middle
that every controller
has a pause button.

00:37:20.436 --> 00:37:25.596 A:middle
And if your game supports game
controllers you must support

00:37:26.366 --> 00:37:30.366 A:middle
or you must handle the
pause button being pressed.

00:37:30.366 --> 00:37:32.446 A:middle
And you're going to want
to treat this as a toggle.

00:37:32.506 --> 00:37:35.526 A:middle
Go from pause to unpause
and unpause back to paused.

00:37:36.766 --> 00:37:39.166 A:middle
Consider your UI
state, some situations

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:41.436 A:middle
in your game it maybe
appropriate to do nothing.

00:37:41.436 --> 00:37:45.156 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:37:45.156 --> 00:37:47.516 A:middle
So, were back inside of our
setup controllers method

00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:49.856 A:middle
and its really as
simple as this,

00:37:50.476 --> 00:37:52.696 A:middle
whenever you have a controller
that your game is going to use,

00:37:53.516 --> 00:37:55.466 A:middle
use the controller
paused handler,

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.836 A:middle
set that up in this case
whenever the controllers pause

00:37:59.836 --> 00:38:00.666 A:middle
button is pressed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.936 --> 00:38:06.966 A:middle
This block is run and we toggle
the pause state of the game.

00:38:07.146 --> 00:38:08.296 A:middle
Also controllers are going

00:38:08.296 --> 00:38:10.516 A:middle
to have player indicator
LED's on them.

00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:13.316 A:middle
And it's your job
to assign these.

00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:15.506 A:middle
These communicates
to your player

00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:18.506 A:middle
that your game has recognized
the controller and is using it.

00:38:18.556 --> 00:38:21.826 A:middle
And in the case of multi
controller games we will give

00:38:21.826 --> 00:38:23.116 A:middle
the player an indication as to

00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:24.846 A:middle
which player they
are in your game.

00:38:26.676 --> 00:38:31.226 A:middle
These LED's are persistent and
so as a controller disconnects

00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:34.896 A:middle
and reconnects its going to
maintain the same player index.

00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:41.176 A:middle
Now, the player index property
on a controller is what you use

00:38:41.176 --> 00:38:42.786 A:middle
to set the player
indicator LED's.

00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:47.296 A:middle
We have a constant called
GCControllerPlayerIndexUnset.

00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:50.016 A:middle
And in this example
were checking

00:38:50.016 --> 00:38:52.326 A:middle
if the indexes indeed
unset and if

00:38:52.326 --> 00:38:54.136 A:middle
so assigning it to player one.

00:38:55.306 --> 00:38:57.316 A:middle
You'll notice we have a
zero based index game.

00:38:57.876 --> 00:39:02.346 A:middle
In a multiple controller
game you might check if any

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:02.346 --> 00:39:05.146 A:middle
of the currently connected
controllers are unset and if

00:39:05.216 --> 00:39:08.536 A:middle
so display a UI to the player
so that they can choose

00:39:08.796 --> 00:39:10.786 A:middle
which players go on
which teams for instance.

00:39:13.296 --> 00:39:13.846 A:middle
All right.

00:39:13.846 --> 00:39:16.736 A:middle
Now, that you have all the
technical information let's take

00:39:16.736 --> 00:39:20.586 A:middle
a step back and talk about best
practices following these you're

00:39:20.586 --> 00:39:22.886 A:middle
going to be able to integrate
game controllers in a way

00:39:22.886 --> 00:39:24.686 A:middle
that really makes
sense and works

00:39:24.686 --> 00:39:25.766 A:middle
with the player's intentions.

00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:28.666 A:middle
So, first of all just

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.416 A:middle
to reiterate games cannot
require a controller.

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:34.806 A:middle
Game controllers are
optional for players.

00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:38.356 A:middle
You're going to want
to focus your efforts

00:39:38.356 --> 00:39:41.016 A:middle
on the native controls
of the system.

00:39:41.306 --> 00:39:43.636 A:middle
So, that means touch
and motion on iOS

00:39:43.636 --> 00:39:45.786 A:middle
and keyboard and mouse on OS X.

00:39:45.786 --> 00:39:49.026 A:middle
And this is so that you
can reach a hundred percent

00:39:49.026 --> 00:39:50.456 A:middle
of the players who
play your game.

00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:55.206 A:middle
For the players who buy a
gamepad controller you can offer

00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:58.066 A:middle
them the enhanced experience
that you're going to create.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:03.526 A:middle
Also, follow standard
gameplay conventions.

00:40:03.926 --> 00:40:08.136 A:middle
So, the face buttons A and B you
can use those and we recommend

00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:10.826 A:middle
that you use them as the
A button being your action

00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:14.416 A:middle
or confirmation button and the B
button being your cancel button.

00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:17.906 A:middle
Now, when talking
about connecting

00:40:17.906 --> 00:40:21.686 A:middle
and disconnecting think of this
from the player's perspective.

00:40:22.056 --> 00:40:24.286 A:middle
There's player intent
behind each

00:40:24.286 --> 00:40:26.056 A:middle
of these notifications
that you get.

00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:29.956 A:middle
When you have a connected
event the player has plugged

00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:33.646 A:middle
in their controller into the
game, or into your device

00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.916 A:middle
and they want to play
with the controller.

00:40:36.536 --> 00:40:40.686 A:middle
And so, in that case off
load some of the native input

00:40:41.206 --> 00:40:43.636 A:middle
on to the controller
wherever appropriate.

00:40:45.146 --> 00:40:47.636 A:middle
Also eliminate the
player indicator LED's

00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:49.206 A:middle
so that the player knows

00:40:49.206 --> 00:40:51.136 A:middle
that the game has
recognized the controllers

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:52.226 A:middle
and is ready to use them.

00:40:52.806 --> 00:40:56.446 A:middle
And lastly, a lot of games have

00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:58.866 A:middle
on screen overlays
like a pause button.

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:01.426 A:middle
This is entirely appropriate
for a touch base game.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:04.796 A:middle
But with a controller connected
the controller already has a

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:08.596 A:middle
pause button so you can
offload that on screen element

00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:10.556 A:middle
to the controller freeing

00:41:10.556 --> 00:41:12.716 A:middle
up additional real
estate on your screen.

00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:16.646 A:middle
Similarly when disconnecting the
player is saying I don't want

00:41:16.646 --> 00:41:18.526 A:middle
to use this controller
any longer at the moment

00:41:19.126 --> 00:41:21.546 A:middle
or maybe there is elements
or maybe there's reasons

00:41:21.546 --> 00:41:23.946 A:middle
out of their control why this
controller happen to disconnect.

00:41:24.726 --> 00:41:27.196 A:middle
In either case, pause
the gameplay

00:41:27.196 --> 00:41:28.416 A:middle
if you're engaged in gameplay.

00:41:29.156 --> 00:41:33.666 A:middle
Also, return to regular controls
'cause the game has no guarantee

00:41:33.666 --> 00:41:35.516 A:middle
that the player is
going to return back

00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:37.266 A:middle
with controller based controls.

00:41:41.336 --> 00:41:43.876 A:middle
And lastly, think
through your input

00:41:44.606 --> 00:41:49.666 A:middle
so as Jacques mentioned touch
controls allow you amazing

00:41:49.666 --> 00:41:52.866 A:middle
abilities to directly manipulate
your onscreen objects.

00:41:53.696 --> 00:41:56.156 A:middle
And controllers are
great for other tasks

00:41:56.516 --> 00:42:01.316 A:middle
like precise inputs filling the
tactile feedback of the buttons

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:01.316 --> 00:42:03.056 A:middle
in the controllers
against your fingers.

00:42:03.946 --> 00:42:05.716 A:middle
Repeatability of actions.

00:42:06.236 --> 00:42:10.756 A:middle
And there's real magic we think
in marrying these two together.

00:42:11.256 --> 00:42:13.646 A:middle
And as game designers
you have to think

00:42:13.646 --> 00:42:17.586 A:middle
about what game mechanics make
most sense with touch and motion

00:42:17.746 --> 00:42:20.306 A:middle
and which ones makes
most sense to use

00:42:20.306 --> 00:42:21.786 A:middle
as physical controller inputs.

00:42:23.016 --> 00:42:27.626 A:middle

There's some upcoming
sessions you're going

to want to be aware of.

00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:36.446 A:middle
Sprite Kit is an
amazing new framework

00:42:36.446 --> 00:42:38.126 A:middle
for creating sprite based games.

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:40.416 A:middle
We have two sessions tomorrow

00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:43.206 A:middle
