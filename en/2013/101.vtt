The epic ecosystem continues to
thrive for hundreds of millions

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:11.106 A:middle
of users enjoying their
iPhones, iPads and Macs.

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.966 A:middle
This morning, we had
several great announcements

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.696 A:middle
that will make our
users even happier.

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:21.506 A:middle
Starting of course with
iOS 7, the big theme

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:23.936 A:middle
of iOS 7 is its beautiful
new look.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:27.116 A:middle
And it also contains
features like control center

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:29.916 A:middle
and multi-tasking
UI and AirDrop.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:35.156 A:middle
OS X Mavericks is a
very compelling mix

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.196 A:middle
of infrastructure improvements
that lower power consumption,

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:39.396 A:middle
increase responsiveness.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.106 A:middle
Together, let's [inaudible]
user features

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:44.616 A:middle
like margin monitor
support and file tagging

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:47.386 A:middle
and of course our new maps
and iBooks applications.

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:50.826 A:middle
Now, what we didn't
tell you this morning is

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:53.216 A:middle
that we also have big news
on our developer tools.

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.656 A:middle
In addition to our
operating systems,

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:57.646 A:middle
we're also announcing
a major new version

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.976 A:middle
of Xcode today, version 5.

[ Applause ]

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.756 A:middle
The most important purpose
of Xcode 5 is of course

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:14.516 A:middle
to let you take advantage
of all the new APIs in iOS 7

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.776 A:middle
and OS X Mavericks, so
that you can get the most

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:17.976 A:middle
out of these operating systems.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:20.966 A:middle
But it also contains
features that will allow you

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.026 A:middle
to create higher quality apps
with a really strong-focus

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.366 A:middle
on testing and debugging.

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:28.596 A:middle
And all of this gets
surfaced in a fresh new look

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:30.506 A:middle
that simplifies the
Xcode experience.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:32.586 A:middle
This is the new Xcode 5.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:35.516 A:middle
Everything is more
compact and clear.

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:39.736 A:middle
With fewer distractions from
your source code, you're going

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.326 A:middle
to see quite a bit about the new
Xcode 5 throughout this session.

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.036 A:middle
But for now, I'm going to focus
a little more on our agenda

00:03:45.036 --> 00:03:46.276 A:middle
with platform ecosystem.

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.046 A:middle
One of the major forces

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.656 A:middle
that prepares our
platforms is the continued

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:56.266 A:middle
and growing success
of our app stores.

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
Just recently, we
crossed this amazing mark

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.016 A:middle
of over 50 billion
app downloads.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.976 A:middle
And the rate of downloads
start accelerating

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.406 A:middle
because they're constantly
working

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.226 A:middle
on improving our app
store experience.

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:11.026 A:middle
This year, we're making
it easier for users

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.756 A:middle
to discover new apps through
our apps [inaudible] feature

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:16.636 A:middle
which crowd-sources relevant
apps that you might want

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.065 A:middle
to use based on your location.

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.156 A:middle
So for example, you can
find apps that's specific

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.466 A:middle
to a shopping mall
you're entering,

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.086 A:middle
or a sports event you're
attending or an area

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
that you're visiting
as a tourist.

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:31.526 A:middle
You're also significantly
improving our volume purchase

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
program which allows
companies and schools

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.646 A:middle
to initiate mass purchases
of app licenses for both iOS

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.796 A:middle
and Mac and to distribute
those licenses to their users

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:42.496 A:middle
with the help of MDM service.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:46.716 A:middle
And for you developers, we're
improving our purchase receipts.

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:50.136 A:middle
We're now encrypting through
receipts on both platforms,

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.256 A:middle
and via extending the data, you
can access from these receipts.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:56.806 A:middle
The concrete example that is
really useful is if you're

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.336 A:middle
in the process of
moving your app

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.666 A:middle
from a paid app to be a premium.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.106 A:middle
In which case, you can
validate with the receipts

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:05.486 A:middle
which users have already
paid in full for these apps

00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:08.156 A:middle
and credit them [inaudible]
app purchases you might want

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:08.926 A:middle
to offer for free.

[ Applause ]

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.686 A:middle
So taking it all together,
they are making improvements

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.696 A:middle
for our end users
for enterprises

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.386 A:middle
and schools and for developers.

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.516 A:middle
And all these features
work together

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:27.696 A:middle
to make the app store
experience even more compelling

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:28.786 A:middle
that we're adding

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.906 A:middle
to the business opportunities
they offer to you

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:31.966 A:middle
as third-party developers.

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.956 A:middle
I'd also like to give you a
very brief update on iCloud.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.316 A:middle
iCloud provides a
set of services

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:41.896 A:middle
that integrate seamlessly
with applications

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:45.366 A:middle
so that users can access
their documents, their media,

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:48.106 A:middle
and their app data from any
device they choose to work on.

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:52.106 A:middle
And it's a huge success
for hundreds

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
of millions of users worldwide.

00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:57.896 A:middle
iCloud also offers a
set of developer APIs

00:05:57.896 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
that users can use to integrate
these services with your apps.

Now, we understand that there
is one specific area that many

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:06.976 A:middle
of you have struggled
to get to work right.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:10.636 A:middle
And that is our documents in
the Cloud API with core data.

00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:14.166 A:middle
So this is an area
that we have decided

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.036 A:middle
to not implement any new
features this year but instead

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:19.636 A:middle
to focus on reliability
and quality.

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.956 A:middle
We have fixed a ton of
perks in this space.

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.516 A:middle

easier for you

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.736 A:middle
to interact with
this technology.

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:36.266 A:middle
We're adding specific iCloud
debugging tools to Xcode 5.

[ Applause ]

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:44.226 A:middle
You'll be able to use
the key-value store

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.486 A:middle
and the Document API from the
simulator for better testing.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:52.136 A:middle
And in case your users -- in
case if users ever need a way

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:54.736 A:middle
to reset their Cloud data, we
would give them a way to do just

00:06:54.806 --> 00:06:57.066 A:middle
that later this year
on icloud.com.

00:06:57.146 --> 00:07:00.226 A:middle

brief update on iCloud.

we're going to take a look

at how our new products
impact your apps.

00:07:18.106 --> 00:07:19.766 A:middle

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:23.066 A:middle
to the table this morning
in the keynote for end users

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:25.266 A:middle
and at this session, they're
going to focus on what they --

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:27.116 A:middle
what this all means
for you as developers.

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:29.916 A:middle
We're going to start
with iOS 7, and for that,

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.656 A:middle

We've been working for
quite a while on iOS 7

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:46.316 A:middle
and I'm really excited to
tell you a bit about it today.

00:07:46.316 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
We've got a lot of new
things for you here.

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:51.906 A:middle
Just for fun, we took a
look and counted the number

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:54.356 A:middle
of new symbols in our
public frameworks.

00:07:54.916 --> 00:08:00.936 A:middle

classes, 679 new methods

and 917 new properties.

00:08:04.746 --> 00:08:07.096 A:middle
Wow! All right, we'll take
that for what it's worth.

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:08.966 A:middle
But the bottom-line here
is that we've got a lot

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:12.406 A:middle
of new things for
you to dig into.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
Right now though, I want to
talk about just one thing.

00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:21.446 A:middle
The new user interface,
the visual changes

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:23.916 A:middle
that we've made are of course
the most obvious difference.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.906 A:middle
But it goes much
deeper than that.

00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:27.616 A:middle
This is not just a facelift.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.646 A:middle
We broke down all
of our applications

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:34.166 A:middle
and reassembled them,
focusing first on the content

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:36.346 A:middle
and then building the
chrome around that.

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:40.626 A:middle
The result is a fundamental
change to our user experience

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:43.265 A:middle
that will affect
all applications.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.126 A:middle
This is not something
that we undertook lightly.

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.036 A:middle
We took a very serious and
measured approach to this.

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.796 A:middle
And there are three big ideas at
the heart of our redesigned UI.

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:57.776 A:middle
The first of these,
clarity is all

00:08:57.776 --> 00:08:59.346 A:middle
about showing what's relevant.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:03.256 A:middle
It means presenting data to
users in a way that makes sense.

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:06.936 A:middle
Providing features which
are self-explanatory

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:09.796 A:middle
and discoverable and
providing a consistent

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:13.566 A:middle
and cohesive user experience
across your applications.

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:17.916 A:middle
Deference can be
summed up simply

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.166 A:middle
as getting the chrome
out of the way.

00:09:21.286 --> 00:09:24.046 A:middle
Your users care about their
content, their videos,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:25.606 A:middle
their messages, their music.

00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:27.776 A:middle
The user interface
should not compete

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
with that for their attention.

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.986 A:middle
This is perhaps the
most radical change

00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:33.366 A:middle
that we've made in the new UI.

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:36.336 A:middle
And I think that
new understated look

00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:39.886 A:middle
of iOS 7 will really allow the
personality of your applications

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:42.656 A:middle
to shine through far
more than ever before.

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:47.676 A:middle
Now, although we've
simplified the user interface,

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:50.286 A:middle
that doesn't mean
that it's static.

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
iOS 7 has tremendous vitality

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:55.096 A:middle
through the use of
depth and motion.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:59.866 A:middle
Parallax blurs and translucency
take the place of gradients

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.946 A:middle
and shadows and cut-lines in
defining your content areas.

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:06.296 A:middle
And sophisticated animations
make this perhaps the most

00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:09.216 A:middle
lifelike of the any
iOS release yet.

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:12.426 A:middle
Take a look at the
use of Parallax

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.476 A:middle
on the home screen here.

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:16.906 A:middle
Notice how the background
appears behind the application

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
icons and the badge
appears to float above it.

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.166 A:middle
So what does this mean for you?

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.696 A:middle
There are four things that
you need to pay attention to.

00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:29.456 A:middle
The first of these are changes

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:31.236 A:middle
to the way your content
is laid out.

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
We have some new metrics on
our system controls and buttons

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:39.146 A:middle
and pickers have a new look
and a new behavior about them.

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:41.636 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a quick demo now.

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:44.196 A:middle
I'm going to walk through
some of the applications

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:46.596 A:middle
that Craig showed you this
morning, and just point

00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
out some things that we think
you should pay attention to.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.986 A:middle
Let's go into photos here.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:02.936 A:middle
And right away, you can
see some differences.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:11.316 A:middle
Let's try this one
and there we go.

00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:15.226 A:middle
Okay, let's go into photos here.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:18.146 A:middle
Right away, you can see
some big differences.

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.616 A:middle
Take a look at the bars
at the top and the bottom.

00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:22.856 A:middle
Gone are the gradients
and the shadows

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:25.986 A:middle
and we've got a much more
muted understated look.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:29.666 A:middle
If I drill into some content
here and start scrolling,

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.996 A:middle
take a look closely at the
bars at the top and the bottom.

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:36.346 A:middle
You can see some of your
content just sort of hinting

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.276 A:middle
through the bar there.

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:40.106 A:middle
The bars are partially
translucent

00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:43.726 A:middle
and we put a heavy blur on them
so that the text on the buttons

00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:45.606 A:middle
on your bars remain legible.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:48.816 A:middle
If you take a look at the
buttons in the navigation bar,

00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:51.336 A:middle
the Back button on the left and
the Select button on the right,

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.596 A:middle
you'll notice also that they
don't have any borders anymore.

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:58.166 A:middle
Let me select a couple of
photos here and have a look

00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.166 A:middle
at the buttons at the bottom.

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:01.266 A:middle
They too have no boarders.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:01.406 --> 00:12:03.826 A:middle
And in fact, you'll notice
that we're starting to use text

00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:06.836 A:middle
in place of icons in some
place for greater clarity.

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:09.566 A:middle
Now this is not something
special to photos.

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:11.976 A:middle
We actually made this change
throughout the system.

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:15.836 A:middle
Let's go into mail now, and
we'll see here a message

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:16.856 A:middle
that I was reading earlier.

00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:20.096 A:middle
As I scroll up, you can
see the content showing

00:12:20.096 --> 00:12:21.116 A:middle
through the bars as well.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.726 A:middle
And here too the
buttons have no borders.

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:27.136 A:middle
Now, this begs a very important
question, how is the user meant

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:27.906 A:middle
to know what to tap on?

00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:31.946 A:middle
Well, we're using color in place
of borders to indicate things

00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:34.746 A:middle
that are tappable or can
otherwise be interacted with.

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:37.666 A:middle
In the case of mail
here, the color is blue

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.176 A:middle
but every application
has its own personality.

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.216 A:middle
And so you can tailor
the tint color

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:43.906 A:middle
to your application's theme.

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.396 A:middle
Let's go back up to
the message list.

00:12:46.396 --> 00:12:48.056 A:middle
There's one more thing
I want to show you here.

00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:51.506 A:middle
I'm going to swipe on a message
and tap the More button to bring

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:53.966 A:middle
up the action sheet, and
take a look at the buttons

00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:55.446 A:middle
up in the navigation bar now.

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:57.546 A:middle
You'll notice that
they've lost their color

00:12:58.246 --> 00:12:59.876 A:middle
because of course
I can't tap on them

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:01.116 A:middle
because the action sheet is up.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.526 A:middle
If I just missed the action
sheet, the color goes away.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:07.666 A:middle
And this is not just a
simple dimming effect.

00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:10.996 A:middle
We're actually desaturating the
tint color of the control there.

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:12.856 A:middle
What's happening
under the covers is

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:16.136 A:middle
that UIKit is changing the tint
color on the inactive controls

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:17.906 A:middle
and posting a notification.

00:13:18.436 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
You can listen for that
notification in your app

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:23.526 A:middle
so that you can update the color
of your controls accordingly.

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:26.706 A:middle
And I have a small
confession to make.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.776 A:middle
My eyes aren't what they used
to be and I'm having a bit

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:31.456 A:middle
of trouble reading
the text in mail here.

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:34.336 A:middle
So, I want to show you a
new text-sizing feature

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:35.896 A:middle
that we've added to iOS 7.

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:38.346 A:middle
I'm going to switch
into settings here

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:40.166 A:middle
and you can see right here.

00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:43.096 A:middle
This is a great example of the
new group style Table View.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:46.106 A:middle
This is the case where we've
changed some of the metrics.

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:49.156 A:middle
You'll notice the cells are
now going edge-to-edge instead

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:51.346 A:middle
of being inset into
rounded racks.

00:13:52.496 --> 00:13:55.386 A:middle
Let's drill into general
and text size and you'll see

00:13:55.386 --> 00:13:56.566 A:middle
that I've got a slider here.

00:13:56.736 --> 00:14:00.466 A:middle
I can drag it to the left to
make text smaller or drag it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.006 A:middle
to the right to make text
larger in applications

00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:04.256 A:middle
which adopted this feature.

00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:07.066 A:middle
I'm going to leave it on the
right in the largest setting

00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:09.566 A:middle
and switch back through
multi-tasking to mail.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.176 A:middle
And you can see that mail is
now using a much larger font

00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:15.936 A:middle
and it's also adapted to
the layout of the cells

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.886 A:middle
to accommodate the larger text.

00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:20.856 A:middle
This is a place where I think
Auto Layout Constraints are

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:23.886 A:middle
really going to help you in your
application with this feature.

00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:26.976 A:middle
Now, I'm having so
much fun up here

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:29.256 A:middle
that I worry the session
may go a little bit late.

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:31.556 A:middle
Let's check the calendar
and see if that's going

00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
to cause any problems.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.886 A:middle
Sure enough, we've got the
Apple Design Awards coming

00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:36.776 A:middle
up a little bit later.

00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:38.646 A:middle
We better do something
about that.

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:43.556 A:middle
I'm going to tap into the awards
event and edit it and I'm going

00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:46.036 A:middle
to tap on the start time here
to push it back a little.

00:14:46.696 --> 00:14:48.386 A:middle
Notice how the picker slides

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:50.466 A:middle
or notice how the
Table View slides open

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:51.686 A:middle
to reveal the new picker.

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:55.306 A:middle
Once I've changed the time to
push it back or we don't need

00:14:55.306 --> 00:14:57.146 A:middle
to go to 6, I think
5 will be fine.

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
I'm going to tap the Start
Time to accept my action

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:04.466 A:middle
and the Table View slides
closed to hide the picker.

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:07.566 A:middle
This is a new way of using
pickers which will take a bit

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:09.286 A:middle
of work in your code to adopt it

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:11.896 A:middle
but I think the result
is a much lighter weight,

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.556 A:middle
easier to use control.

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:16.296 A:middle
Okay, let's go back
to the slides now.

00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:18.946 A:middle
I want to recap briefly some

00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:20.226 A:middle
of the things we've
just talked about.

00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:27.586 A:middle
So first, your content
needs to go full screen now.

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:30.736 A:middle
We've always had
translucent bars in UIKit.

00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:34.606 A:middle
The difference now is that
all bars are translucent all

00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:34.996 A:middle
the time.

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:39.566 A:middle
If your content is in the scroll
view, we can dynamically resize

00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:43.336 A:middle
that and set the content
insets appropriately for you.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:45.626 A:middle
If your content isn't
in a scroll view,

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:47.836 A:middle
you'll have to do a
little bit of work

00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:49.286 A:middle
to adopt for the new layout.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:55.106 A:middle
Buttons have no borders anymore
whether you're using a UIButton

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:58.056 A:middle
with a now horribly misnamed
bordered bar button item.

00:15:58.476 --> 00:15:59.446 A:middle
The borders are gone.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:05.556 A:middle
And we're using tint
color to indicate things

00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:07.836 A:middle
that can now be interacted
with or tapped on.

00:16:08.356 --> 00:16:12.596 A:middle
Group style Table Views and
some of our new controls or some

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.256 A:middle
of our controls have
new metrics.

00:16:14.826 --> 00:16:17.926 A:middle
Now, we tried very hard to
minimize the number of places

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:19.866 A:middle
where we did this because
we're fully cognizant

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:22.996 A:middle
of the impact this will have in
the layout of our application.

00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:25.026 A:middle
Those places where we did do it,

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.526 A:middle
we felt were absolutely
essential

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:28.626 A:middle
to the goals of the
redesigned UI.

00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:33.696 A:middle
And finally, a new way
of using pickers in line.

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:38.926 A:middle
So those are some of the things
that have change in UIKit.

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:41.736 A:middle
The thing to bear in
mind is the vast majority

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.096 A:middle
of the kit remains the same.

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:46.566 A:middle
I'd like to talk a little
bit now about some new things

00:16:46.566 --> 00:16:48.276 A:middle
that we've added to help you

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:51.396 A:middle
in your applications adopt
the new principles of design.

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:54.716 A:middle
Let's start with typography.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:59.676 A:middle
Retina devices permit this
incredible quality of text.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:02.806 A:middle
What's been missing are some
of the more advanced ideas

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:06.816 A:middle
in typography that come from
the printed publishing world.

00:17:07.976 --> 00:17:11.215 A:middle
The first of these are kerning
and ligatures which we turned

00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:15.136 A:middle
on by default in text throughout
the system whether using UIKit

00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:16.326 A:middle
or WebKit.

00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
Now, for those of you wondering
what kerning and ligatures mean,

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:25.455 A:middle
kerning is when two letters
overlap each other such as the T

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:27.136 A:middle
and the R at the
start of truffle.

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:31.296 A:middle
And ligatures tie letters
together such as the F, F,

00:17:31.296 --> 00:17:32.776 A:middle
and L at the end of the word.

00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:36.846 A:middle
This might strike some of you
as a rather esoteric point.

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:39.006 A:middle
But it's one of those
little details that we

00:17:39.006 --> 00:17:40.636 A:middle
at Apple find so important.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:44.306 A:middle
I think the result is text
that's much more legible

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.306 A:middle
and frankly more beautiful.

00:17:47.356 --> 00:17:49.636 A:middle
We even support some of
the more extreme cases

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.636 A:middle
out there such as Zapfino.

00:17:52.186 --> 00:17:55.646 A:middle
Another thing that
we've added is a new way

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.106 A:middle
of working with the system font.

00:17:57.706 --> 00:18:00.846 A:middle
Instead of a single
one-type-fits-all system font,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:01.176 --> 00:18:03.866 A:middle
we've introduced a family of
fonts that are being chosen

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:06.166 A:middle
by our designers to work
well with each other.

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:09.616 A:middle
We looked at text across
all of our applications

00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:11.836 A:middle
and classified them
into a series

00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:14.376 A:middle
of usage categories or styles.

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:17.866 A:middle
And for each of those styles,
we chose a specific font

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:21.256 A:middle
and size relative to each other.

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:24.266 A:middle
Now typically, if you wanted
to present more information

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.216 A:middle
on the line or make
text more readable,

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:28.106 A:middle
you would just scale
the font down

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:29.686 A:middle
or scale it up appropriately.

00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:33.716 A:middle
The problem with that is that it
can leave text very hard to read

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:36.526 A:middle
at the smaller sizes or
your letters can be big

00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:38.466 A:middle
and blocky at the larger sizes.

00:18:38.816 --> 00:18:41.446 A:middle
So, we're introducing a
new way of sizing text.

00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:43.886 A:middle
You saw me demonstrate
this in mail just now.

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:47.526 A:middle
We actually changed the
stroke width and the character

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:51.286 A:middle
in the line spacing of text
at each of the relative sizes.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:55.776 A:middle
There's a new API on UIKit
that were turned use --

00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:59.496 A:middle
the specific font to use
for a given size and style.

00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
And WebKit makes
this available to you

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.746 A:middle
through the use of
CSS font values.

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.966 A:middle
We're calling this dynamic type.

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:10.996 A:middle
It's a very -- we think it's
a very advanced typography,

00:19:11.186 --> 00:19:13.186 A:middle
set of typography features
that we're giving to you

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:14.636 A:middle
in a mobile operating system.

00:19:14.996 --> 00:19:16.006 A:middle
We think it's pretty cool.

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:20.256 A:middle
Another thing that
we've added is Text Kit.

00:19:21.336 --> 00:19:24.836 A:middle
Text Kit is an advanced text
and layout rendering engine.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.556 A:middle
It's a great compliment
to WebKit for those times

00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:32.156 A:middle
where you want to use code to
control the layout of your text.

00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.896 A:middle
We took the Cocoa Text
technology from OS X

00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:39.666 A:middle
and brought it to iOS in the
form of a new set of APIs.

00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:41.516 A:middle
Those of you who are familiar

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:44.796 A:middle
with Cocoa Text will have
no problem using these APIs.

00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:46.996 A:middle
For the most part,
they're the same.

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.016 A:middle
And that's it for text.

00:19:50.726 --> 00:19:53.206 A:middle
Let's talk about animations now.

00:19:53.576 --> 00:19:56.906 A:middle
There are generally three ways
that we sort of group animations

00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:57.916 A:middle
when we talk about them.

00:19:58.536 --> 00:20:00.376 A:middle
Transitions are canned
animations

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:02.376 A:middle
between your view
controllers, for example.

00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:07.406 A:middle
Motion effects tie animations
to the movement of the device.

00:20:07.836 --> 00:20:11.306 A:middle
And dynamics are animations
that interact with the user.

00:20:12.176 --> 00:20:13.276 A:middle
Let's dig into these a little.

00:20:14.706 --> 00:20:17.206 A:middle
So out of the box, we
write a standard set

00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:18.856 A:middle
of view controller transitions.

00:20:18.856 --> 00:20:20.346 A:middle
Your view slide up
from the bottom

00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
when you present them
modally or from right to left

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:25.206 A:middle
when you push them on to
a navigation controller.

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
Well, we're opening
that up to you now

00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:30.646 A:middle
so that you can define your own
animations for a transition.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.286 A:middle
If you want to flip your
view around when you push it

00:20:33.286 --> 00:20:35.486 A:middle
on to a navigation
controller, for example.

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:39.196 A:middle
We're also making it easy for
you to tie your animations

00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:43.406 A:middle
to the system transition so that
you can animate alongside one

00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:45.776 A:middle
of the system transitions
or kick off a set

00:20:45.776 --> 00:20:49.726 A:middle
of animations at the end.

00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:52.346 A:middle
UI motion effects.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:56.836 A:middle
So as I said before,
motion effects tie movement

00:20:56.936 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
of the device to
changes in your UI.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
You're familiar with
core motion.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:05.026 A:middle
Well we took that and packaged
it up in an easy to use API,

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:07.346 A:middle
that we're calling
UIMotionEffects.

00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:10.056 A:middle
We take the event
string from core motion

00:21:10.056 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
and we crunch the numbers and
convert that into a series

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.286 A:middle
of perspective changes.

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.826 A:middle
We then feature those
perspective changes

00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:19.226 A:middle
so that you can adapt
your UI accordingly.

00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.726 A:middle
This is how we implement
the Parallax effect

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:25.056 A:middle
on the Home screen and
the new tab UI in Safari.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:31.226 A:middle
And finally, I'd like to talk
a bit about UIKit dynamics.

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:35.236 A:middle
I asked one of my engineers for
a succinct description of this,

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:37.196 A:middle
and he's a smart guy, a doctor.

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:38.386 A:middle
And this is what he told me.

00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.106 A:middle
I had to think about this
one for a little bit.

00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:43.476 A:middle
And I think I can sum it up
a little more simply for you.

00:21:44.196 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
We built a physics
engine into UIKit.

00:21:48.856 --> 00:21:51.976 A:middle
So the idea is that the
physics engine deals in terms

00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:55.166 A:middle
of real world type behaviors
-- collisions, gravity,

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.346 A:middle
forces, that kind of thing.

00:21:57.586 --> 00:22:00.886 A:middle
You associate a set of behaviors
with using your hierarchy.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:04.216 A:middle
And as the physics engine
runs, it updates properties

00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:06.906 A:middle
on your views and changing
that frame orientation.

00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:10.546 A:middle
Conversely, if you change
properties on your view, say,

00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:13.436 A:middle
in response to the user
swiping across the screen,

00:22:13.976 --> 00:22:16.996 A:middle
we feed those back into the
physics engine and it runs

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:19.416 A:middle
until -- I'm sorry, it runs

00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:21.046 A:middle
until it come back
to an equilibrium.

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:24.546 A:middle
This is a super powerful
system that lets you --

00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:27.986 A:middle
makes it very easy to compose
sophisticated interactions

00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:28.716 A:middle
with users.

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:31.056 A:middle
That's what we call
UIKitDynamics.

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:35.546 A:middle
Let's talk about
images a little bit.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.776 A:middle
In the beginning, it
was really simple.

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:41.916 A:middle
You created your image, you gave
it a name, and you looked it up.

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:46.186 A:middle
Well then we added iPad
and we needed a way

00:22:46.186 --> 00:22:49.106 A:middle
of differentiating your iPad
art from your iPhone art.

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:52.396 A:middle
And so we came up with a clever
way of mangling the filename.

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:56.886 A:middle
Well then we added Retina
iPhones and we need a new way

00:22:56.886 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
of differentiating your iPhone
high-res art from your 1x art.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:04.126 A:middle
And then we added
Retina iPad, so frankly,

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:05.756 A:middle
it all just start
getting out of control.

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:08.666 A:middle
We were running out of ways
of mangling your filenames.

00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
With iOS 7, we are
ending the insanity.

[ Applause ]

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:23.916 A:middle
We've got a great new UI in
Xcode that makes it really easy

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:24.966 A:middle
to manage your images.

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:28.106 A:middle
You can tell at a glance if
you're missing some Retina art,

00:23:28.186 --> 00:23:30.946 A:middle
and we've integrated
this tightly with UIKit.

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
You still look up your
images the same way

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.816 A:middle
that you've been
doing it for years,

00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:36.676 A:middle
and it's a little
bit faster to boot.

00:23:36.926 --> 00:23:40.316 A:middle
I'd like to invite Max Drukman
on stage now to give you a demo

00:23:40.316 --> 00:23:42.936 A:middle
of this and some other cool
new features in Xcode 5.

Welcome to Xcode 5.

of keeping your content
front and center.

You'll see a lot more of
Xcode 5 in this session,

00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:07.436 A:middle
but for right now, I'm
going to talk to you

00:24:07.436 --> 00:24:11.506 A:middle
about two new features, Asset
Catalogs, that's the feature

00:24:11.506 --> 00:24:13.776 A:middle
that gets rid of that
naming convention for you,

00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:17.406 A:middle
and the totally revamped
Auto Layout.

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:19.146 A:middle
Let's have a look.

00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:21.626 A:middle
Here's a game project
I'm working on.

00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:26.376 A:middle
I'm going to dive right
in to the intro screen.

00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:28.346 A:middle
Here I have a couple of buttons

00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:31.126 A:middle
and it's fairly typical
in a game project.

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:35.186 A:middle
I'm using UIKit buttons but I'm
styling them with custom art.

00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:37.996 A:middle
Since there are only two
buttons on this screen,

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:40.186 A:middle
I think I'll make
them as big as I can.

00:24:40.186 --> 00:24:42.996 A:middle
And I'm going to push
them over to the side

00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:45.696 A:middle
and I'll make this one
really, really wide.

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:51.936 A:middle
And here we see that's one of
the pitfalls of using custom art

00:24:51.936 --> 00:24:53.076 A:middle
with a scalable button.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:24:57.816 A:middle
I made my button big but my
artwork got all distorted.

already saying to yourselves,

I know how to fix that problem.

00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:06.576 A:middle
You need to get art that's
sliced into three parts.

00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:11.536 A:middle
Well, you're absolutely right
and I appreciate you bringing

00:25:11.536 --> 00:25:14.756 A:middle
that up because it gives me
just the segue way I need

00:25:14.876 --> 00:25:16.986 A:middle
to start talking
about Asset Catalogs.

00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:21.936 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to the
Asset Catalog in my project.

00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:23.476 A:middle
And here we are.

00:25:24.286 --> 00:25:27.566 A:middle
On the left is an outline
with all of the visual assets

00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:31.366 A:middle

right, there's a thumbnail view

00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
that keeps all of my assets
and their variants organized.

00:25:35.946 --> 00:25:40.696 A:middle
Here we can see the background
of the screen I was just on,

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:44.426 A:middle
that sort of lime color, with
both the 1x and 2x variants.

00:25:45.696 --> 00:25:49.466 A:middle
The next screen over, the sort
of stone color, also 1x and 2x.

00:25:50.186 --> 00:25:52.806 A:middle
And even my app icon
and launch images

00:25:53.146 --> 00:25:56.216 A:middle

bar and baz convention
that we all love so well,

00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:18.466 A:middle
or no convention at all because
the Asset Catalog keeps your

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:20.596 A:middle
image reps organized for you,

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:23.346 A:middle
it doesn't really matter what
you name your images anymore.

my orange buttons.

these in three parts.

of the asset catalog editor

00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:37.946 A:middle

now do slicing right in Xcode.

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.376 A:middle
Now, all I need to do is
click the Start Slicing button

00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:06.356 A:middle
and I'm given three choices.

00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.366 A:middle
I can slice in three parts

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:12.816 A:middle
so that my image can scale
horizontally, or in three parts

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:17.956 A:middle
so it can scale vertically,
or of course in nine parts

00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:20.876 A:middle
so that it can scale both
horizontally and vertically.

00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:22.566 A:middle
Somebody out there wins a prize.

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:26.026 A:middle
I only need mine to
scale horizontally,

00:27:26.026 --> 00:27:27.246 A:middle
so I'm going to choose that.

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:32.816 A:middle
Now, Xcode analyzed my image
and found the best place

00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:34.716 A:middle
to put the slice points.

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:39.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:45.786 A:middle
So I have a left cap, a right
cap, and one pixel of stretch.

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:47.936 A:middle
The grayed out area
won't be used.

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:50.296 A:middle
Now, of course, you can
make your own decisions

00:27:50.296 --> 00:27:52.326 A:middle
and change the width of
the caps if you want.

00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:55.786 A:middle
You can even change the
width of the center portion

00:27:55.786 --> 00:27:58.736 A:middle
and it will repeat
rather than stretch.

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:03.976 A:middle
But I like what Xcode gave me,
so I'm going to slice the 1x

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:03.976 --> 00:28:05.226 A:middle
in exactly the same way.

00:28:05.886 --> 00:28:09.436 A:middle
And now, when I use the back
button to go to my story board,

00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:12.166 A:middle
my art is doing the right thing.

00:28:13.516 --> 00:28:20.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:23.146 A:middle
And now, even when I
scale the other one,

00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:24.746 A:middle
everything is looking great.

00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:27.896 A:middle
Now, let's talk about
Auto Layout.

00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:31.116 A:middle
Obviously, I'm designing
my interface

00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:32.536 A:middle
in the landscape orientation.

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:36.446 A:middle
But what happens when my
user rotates her device

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.956 A:middle
to see it in portrait?

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.596 A:middle
I need to know what
my interface is going

00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:43.006 A:middle
to do when that happens.

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:46.906 A:middle
Now, of course, I can
run my app in a simulator

00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:48.416 A:middle
or run a device if
I have one handy.

00:28:49.206 --> 00:28:51.766 A:middle
But we've made it
even easier in Xcode 5

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:55.056 A:middle
because we've added
a preview assistant.

00:28:56.506 --> 00:28:59.746 A:middle
The preview assistant allows
you to look at your story boards

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:02.486 A:middle
under different visual
conditions.

00:29:03.486 --> 00:29:06.056 A:middle
So here, I'm designing
in landscape,

00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:08.276 A:middle
but previewing in portrait.

00:29:08.896 --> 00:29:12.156 A:middle
I can essentially design in
two orientations at once now.

00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:17.186 A:middle
And you can see that I have
an Auto Layout problem.

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:22.046 A:middle
Of course, these demos always
start with a problem, right?

00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:26.386 A:middle
Now, notice that my buttons are
clipped off and they're kind

00:29:26.386 --> 00:29:27.816 A:middle
of floating in the
center somewhere.

00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:33.406 A:middle
But my background and
the logo of my game,

00:29:33.816 --> 00:29:35.216 A:middle
they're actually
doing the right thing.

00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:37.936 A:middle
That's because of a
big change we've made

00:29:37.936 --> 00:29:39.516 A:middle
to Auto Layout in Xcode 5.

00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:42.216 A:middle
Now while you're working
with your interfaces,

00:29:42.546 --> 00:29:45.946 A:middle
you no longer need to have
every object constrained.

00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:48.491 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:50.436 A:middle
Yeah, that's got to
be worth something.

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:54.896 A:middle
It makes it really easy
to work iteratively

00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:57.006 A:middle
through your interfaces
without Auto Layout,

00:29:57.076 --> 00:29:58.146 A:middle
well, getting in your way.

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:05.186 A:middle
Yeah. Now, we didn't
stop there though.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:07.296 A:middle
We've also added a lot

00:30:07.296 --> 00:30:09.546 A:middle
of different ways
to make constraints.

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.026 A:middle
Let me show you my favorite.

00:30:11.526 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
Control drag.

00:30:13.136 --> 00:30:16.136 A:middle
I'm going to constraint this
button by control dragging

00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:19.206 A:middle
from it to its superview.

00:30:20.091 --> 00:30:22.091 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:23.536 A:middle
Well, wait.

00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:27.166 A:middle
I can even make more than
one constraint at a time.

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:31.866 A:middle
And now the preview assistant
updates, so I see that I'm

00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:34.416 A:middle
on the right track and
I know that I only need

00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.356 A:middle
to make one more constraint,

00:30:36.886 --> 00:30:38.886 A:middle
and now my button is
doing the right thing

00:30:38.886 --> 00:30:39.876 A:middle
in both orientations.

00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:45.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:47.466 A:middle
There's one more thing.

00:30:47.466 --> 00:30:50.496 A:middle
Now, doing the other
button is even easier.

00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:54.196 A:middle
I can control drag to
the other button and set

00:30:54.196 --> 00:30:57.256 A:middle
up all three constraints
at once.

00:30:57.686 --> 00:30:59.546 A:middle
In one gesture, and
that's pretty simple.

Now --

00:31:03.786 --> 00:31:05.436 A:middle
-- let's look at
this next view over.

00:31:05.786 --> 00:31:08.446 A:middle
It's obviously having
some layout difficulties.

00:31:08.486 --> 00:31:10.826 A:middle
That's because there are no
constraints in this view at all.

00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
Now, control drag is great for
setting up one, two, three,

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:18.756 A:middle
a handful of constraints, but
of course, you can do things

00:31:18.756 --> 00:31:23.236 A:middle
like select all of the objects
in this view and add all

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:24.446 A:middle
of the constraints at once.

00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:28.206 A:middle
And you get immediate
feedback that it worked.

00:31:29.686 --> 00:31:30.516 A:middle
That's pretty good.

00:31:37.236 --> 00:31:40.026 A:middle

these tab views I have

over here featuring the great
new iOS 7 look and feel.

00:31:44.596 --> 00:31:47.966 A:middle
Now as I said, you
can have the assistant

00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:51.406 A:middle
in a different orientation
like, you know, I can go back

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:53.516 A:middle
and forth between
landscape and portrait.

00:31:54.096 --> 00:31:57.396 A:middle
I can have different
device sizes so I can --

00:31:57.516 --> 00:32:00.166 A:middle
here I'm switching between the
three and a half and four inch.

they're reacting perfectly

sizes, and even iOS versions.

is so much more

It really shows off the
user's running applications.

This makes it all the more
important than your app --

00:32:57.336 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
that your app's content is as
up to date as you can make it.

to update your application's

With background fetch, we
will run your application

can pull new data down

you can use this API to tell us

when it would be
inappropriate to run you.

run your application in response

to a push notification so that
you can update your content

So how should you get
started with this?

00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:25.416 A:middle
Well, first of course, download
the SDK, build your application,

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:28.315 A:middle
and boom, you've got
the new user interface.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:31.985 A:middle
You may need to update
your UI to accommodate some

00:34:31.985 --> 00:34:33.576 A:middle
of the changes that
we've talked about,

00:34:33.786 --> 00:34:37.295 A:middle
but we really encourage you to
actually take a deeper rethink

00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:41.315 A:middle
on the design of your
UI along the lines

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:43.156 A:middle
of what we've done in iOS 7.

and it's doing amazingly well
with 240 million players.

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:56.456 A:middle
Of course, Game Center supports
things like leaderboards

00:35:56.826 --> 00:35:59.886 A:middle
and multiplayer challenges

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:21.276 A:middle
or in-game trading
among other things.

00:36:23.066 --> 00:36:25.666 A:middle
But the big news today is
we have two new technologies

00:36:26.156 --> 00:36:29.166 A:middle
to introduce that makes
game development easier

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:29.956 A:middle
and better than ever.

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:35.326 A:middle
First, I want to
introduce Sprite Kit.

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:38.526 A:middle
So if you're building a game
like one of our iconic games

00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:42.706 A:middle
on the platform, Cut the
Rope, Where's My Water,

00:36:43.406 --> 00:36:45.286 A:middle
or Jetpack Joyride, you need

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:48.566 A:middle
to spend time building
a good game engine.

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:50.926 A:middle
And to build a good game
engine, it takes a lot

00:36:50.926 --> 00:36:52.386 A:middle
of knowledge to do that.

00:36:52.386 --> 00:36:54.256 A:middle
So we thought, what can we do

00:36:54.256 --> 00:36:58.166 A:middle
to help you game developers
make your life easier?

00:36:59.096 --> 00:37:00.426 A:middle
So that's why we
created Sprite Kit.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
It has everything you
expect in a game engine.

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:06.916 A:middle
It has a great animation
system, particles, physics,

00:37:07.246 --> 00:37:11.756 A:middle
image effects, video tie-in,
and all that and more.

00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:13.806 A:middle
It's high performance with --

00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:17.346 A:middle
at its core is a
high-performance rendering

00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:18.386 A:middle
engine built by people

00:37:18.386 --> 00:37:21.936 A:middle
who really know GPU
development inside and out.

00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:26.626 A:middle
We have integrated tools in
Xcode and it's easy to learn,

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.286 A:middle
which means you have
less code to write.

00:37:28.576 --> 00:37:31.296 A:middle
Let us do the heavy lifting for
you and so you can concentrate

00:37:31.296 --> 00:37:32.606 A:middle
on building a great game.

00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:37.306 A:middle
And of course, it's available
for both iOS and OS X,

00:37:37.396 --> 00:37:40.856 A:middle
which means the code you write
can be used on both platforms.

00:37:41.366 --> 00:37:42.406 A:middle
So let's take a look at a demo.

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:53.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:54.296 --> 00:37:56.956 A:middle
So here's a little tour of some
of the features of Sprite Kit.

00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:59.106 A:middle
First, obviously, is
an animation system.

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:01.826 A:middle
The animation system has all
the things you would expect --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:06.256 A:middle
translation, rotation,
scaling, fade in, fade out,

00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:11.156 A:middle
and these actions can
be chained together --

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:13.756 A:middle
chained together or combined
and run in parallel in groups.

00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:18.506 A:middle
Oops, let's try that again.

00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:21.236 A:middle
This is also optimized
for both --

00:38:21.876 --> 00:38:26.626 A:middle
for OS X and iOS hardware
with the added benefit

00:38:26.626 --> 00:38:28.446 A:middle
that it makes it really
battery-efficient.

00:38:32.996 --> 00:38:34.596 A:middle
So that -- so that's
the animation system.

00:38:34.936 --> 00:38:35.736 A:middle
Next is physics.

00:38:36.076 --> 00:38:37.716 A:middle
We obviously -- we have
integrated physics.

00:38:37.716 --> 00:38:41.516 A:middle
But this is not just, we provide
physics alongside of Sprite Kit,

00:38:41.516 --> 00:38:43.786 A:middle
we actually have
integrated physics.

00:38:43.786 --> 00:38:45.646 A:middle
Putting physics into your
application is as simple

00:38:45.646 --> 00:38:47.946 A:middle
as one API call for
setting the physics body.

00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:50.796 A:middle
So we can -- we can kind
of lean one direction

00:38:51.236 --> 00:38:53.336 A:middle
or we can go back the other way,

00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:57.016 A:middle
and also we can obviously
put some touch events

00:38:57.016 --> 00:38:59.516 A:middle
in to add some impulses
to our physics engine.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:04.126 A:middle
Really efficient physics
engine built into Sprite Kit.

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.396 A:middle
The -- next, particles.

00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:09.286 A:middle
We have full particle system
in there, 37 properties

00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:12.736 A:middle
of these particles, and the key
here is you can either modify

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.876 A:middle
these with your code
or you can --

00:39:14.876 --> 00:39:16.086 A:middle
or you can modify the data

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:18.566 A:middle
which means you can
build particles offline

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:20.516 A:middle
and archive them for
use by your application.

00:39:21.586 --> 00:39:24.196 A:middle
We also have an interpolated
spawning [phonetic] system

00:39:24.476 --> 00:39:26.806 A:middle
which we think of this as
an anti-clumping technology.

00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:29.446 A:middle
As I move this around, you
see the particles are evenly

00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:30.646 A:middle
distributed in the trail.

00:39:31.486 --> 00:39:34.056 A:middle
Everything like that, all of
this 60 frames per second,

00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:35.666 A:middle
I can even write with it.

00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:37.956 A:middle
Here you go.

00:39:38.966 --> 00:39:40.416 A:middle
We've also integrated Sprite Kit

00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:43.526 A:middle
into our existing graphics
technology core image.

00:39:44.326 --> 00:39:47.936 A:middle
So you can apply CI filters
to your application here.

00:39:47.936 --> 00:39:49.766 A:middle
And once we toss
a filter on here,

00:39:49.766 --> 00:39:54.466 A:middle
so you can have this great,
yeah, this great pinch effect

00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:57.586 A:middle
on there as the physics
simulation continues to run.

00:39:59.696 --> 00:40:02.046 A:middle
We have a pixelate filter
on top of the system.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
And these filters can be applied
to all or part Sprite tree

00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:07.326 A:middle
and finally a really,
really cool --

00:40:09.076 --> 00:40:10.196 A:middle
-- twirl effect.

00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:13.306 A:middle
So you can apply CI filters
right on top of your scene.

00:40:14.806 --> 00:40:15.476 A:middle
Finally, the video.

00:40:16.596 --> 00:40:18.686 A:middle
We've taken our great
media technologies

00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.296 A:middle
and integrated video
in the Sprite Kit.

00:40:20.476 --> 00:40:22.116 A:middle
This means you can
mass the video

00:40:22.116 --> 00:40:23.896 A:middle
and I can manipulate the
mass on top of the video.

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:26.096 A:middle
And you can combine
this into your scene

00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:29.556 A:middle
such the video is not just for
cut scenes and transitions.

00:40:29.556 --> 00:40:31.326 A:middle
I can add sprites in here.

00:40:31.326 --> 00:40:34.396 A:middle
And you see the sprites fly
in front and behind the video.

00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:36.936 A:middle
Video is a first class
citizen in Sprite Kit.

00:40:38.356 --> 00:40:39.736 A:middle
So that's a quick
tour of Sprite Kit.

00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:48.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:50.686 A:middle
I thought of making the
game development easier

00:40:50.766 --> 00:40:51.256 A:middle
for all of you.

00:40:51.656 --> 00:40:52.726 A:middle
How else I'm going to do that?

00:40:53.116 --> 00:40:57.326 A:middle
Well, we're going to introduce
comprehensive, full-featured,

00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:00.266 A:middle
production quality game
sample code for you guys.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:00.766 --> 00:41:03.966 A:middle
So let me jump in here
and show you what we have.

00:41:06.416 --> 00:41:07.806 A:middle
So this is our adventure game.

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:11.066 A:middle
It is a Multiplayer
Dungeon Crawler

00:41:11.066 --> 00:41:12.376 A:middle
with all the features
you would expect.

00:41:16.126 --> 00:41:20.166 A:middle
So it has a multi-directional
scrolling, parallax effects,

00:41:20.406 --> 00:41:22.356 A:middle
we have part of this falling
leaves particle effects

00:41:22.356 --> 00:41:25.316 A:middle
that the enemies have AI,
with high quality art work.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:30.876 A:middle
All of this was production
quality code which allows you

00:41:30.986 --> 00:41:33.726 A:middle
to just grab it, and either
start your next game project

00:41:33.756 --> 00:41:37.476 A:middle
with it, or adapt the two, or
pull some technologies out of it

00:41:37.476 --> 00:41:39.646 A:middle
to adapt it to your
current game.

00:41:41.016 --> 00:41:41.446 A:middle
There you go.

00:41:41.496 --> 00:41:44.546 A:middle
So let's jump back in the
Xcode and take a look.

00:41:45.006 --> 00:41:49.066 A:middle
So these samples are made
for both OS X and iOS

00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:51.976 A:middle
which means the vast majority
of the source files are shared,

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.476 A:middle
so you can use them to support
either operating system.

00:41:54.936 --> 00:41:57.116 A:middle
We have over 1,700 art
files in this sample.

00:41:57.116 --> 00:41:58.586 A:middle
And if we go look at the part --

00:41:58.586 --> 00:41:59.856 A:middle
one of the particle
effects here,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:01.886 A:middle
this is a leaf particle effect,

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.746 A:middle
what you'll notice is we
build a particle editor right

00:42:04.746 --> 00:42:05.536 A:middle
in the Xcode.

00:42:06.516 --> 00:42:11.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.686 A:middle
So I can change the generation
rate on the particles here.

00:42:14.686 --> 00:42:16.876 A:middle
We take a lot more of leaves --

00:42:16.876 --> 00:42:18.796 A:middle
that that's felt
better for the game.

00:42:19.116 --> 00:42:21.726 A:middle
And, you know, leaves fall in
the fall not when they're green

00:42:21.726 --> 00:42:23.776 A:middle
so we want to change one
of our key colors here.

00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:26.426 A:middle
And we'll make that red.

00:42:26.426 --> 00:42:27.906 A:middle
And we've changed
the particle effect.

00:42:28.236 --> 00:42:29.796 A:middle
Again, this is editing
the particle data

00:42:30.016 --> 00:42:31.566 A:middle
so when you build your
application again,

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:33.416 A:middle
when you build your game,
it's picked right up

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:34.816 A:middle
and your game will
have this effect in it.

00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:39.766 A:middle
So that's a quick tour of
one of our new game samples.

00:42:41.516 --> 00:42:47.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:47.686 --> 00:42:49.516 A:middle
The next big technology we have

00:42:49.576 --> 00:42:52.246 A:middle
to announce today
is Game Controllers.

00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:58.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:59.236 --> 00:43:01.936 A:middle
We're taking the gaming
experience to a new level

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:03.716 A:middle
by defining the standard --

00:43:04.046 --> 00:43:07.086 A:middle
a common standard for game
controllers that allow high --

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:09.556 A:middle
that allow all users to have
high quality game controllers.

00:43:09.556 --> 00:43:10.356 A:middle
So how are we doing this?

00:43:10.826 --> 00:43:12.916 A:middle
We are providing the users --

00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:15.656 A:middle
users can pick whatever
third-party controller

00:43:15.656 --> 00:43:16.386 A:middle
they prefer.

00:43:16.716 --> 00:43:20.526 A:middle
Software developers can build a
single software interface rather

00:43:20.526 --> 00:43:21.656 A:middle
than having to support
a multitude

00:43:21.656 --> 00:43:24.786 A:middle
of software interfaces,
thus as game developers,

00:43:25.116 --> 00:43:26.746 A:middle
you can concentrate
in building your game

00:43:26.976 --> 00:43:29.116 A:middle
versus supporting a whole bunch
of different game controllers.

00:43:29.626 --> 00:43:31.716 A:middle
This comes into two parts.

00:43:31.756 --> 00:43:35.516 A:middle
First, a hardware standard,
this is part of our MFi program.

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:40.406 A:middle
And secondly, a software
interface

00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:42.836 A:middle
which allows software
developers to build --

00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:45.576 A:middle
which allows you to build
to a common interface.

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.076 A:middle
Let's first talk
about the hardware.

00:43:48.176 --> 00:43:49.546 A:middle
The hardware comes
into two types,

00:43:49.936 --> 00:43:52.276 A:middle
either form-fitting
snapping controls,

00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:53.936 A:middle
or your stand-alone controllers.

00:43:54.196 --> 00:43:55.656 A:middle
There's also two configurations.

00:43:56.006 --> 00:43:59.216 A:middle
The standard configuration
has a d-pad, four buttons,

00:43:59.516 --> 00:44:00.546 A:middle
and some shoulder buttons.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:01.666 --> 00:44:04.976 A:middle
The hands configuration adds two
thumb sticks and two triggers.

00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:09.606 A:middle
All inputs are
pressure-sensitive.

00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:11.786 A:middle
And we talked about
high quality.

00:44:11.786 --> 00:44:13.816 A:middle
We want to ensure there are
high quality controllers

00:44:13.816 --> 00:44:15.806 A:middle
to give your users
a great experience,

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:18.076 A:middle
we do these by requiring
no calibration,

00:44:18.076 --> 00:44:20.546 A:middle
the inputs can't drift,
and all the buttons have

00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:21.556 A:middle
to have the same feel.

00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:24.606 A:middle
Of course there's a
software piece of this.

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:27.796 A:middle
So you can -- so your software
can communicate directly

00:44:27.796 --> 00:44:28.516 A:middle
with controllers.

00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:31.486 A:middle
And this is, the truth be told,
this is really easy to adopt

00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:33.796 A:middle
with both polling and
callback types of inputs.

00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:35.096 A:middle
We've also designed it

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:37.986 A:middle
so you can actually use
the Multi-Touch interface

00:44:37.986 --> 00:44:40.266 A:middle
or the gyro in conjunction
with your controller

00:44:40.516 --> 00:44:44.516 A:middle
so you can make a great a hybrid
experience for your users.

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:50.026 A:middle
And of course this is both
on iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

00:44:50.736 --> 00:44:52.616 A:middle
So I think the best way
to show what you can do

00:44:52.616 --> 00:44:54.346 A:middle
with controllers
is to do a demo.

00:44:54.346 --> 00:44:56.366 A:middle
I like to invite Thomas
Schegloff [assumed spelling]

00:44:56.366 --> 00:44:59.226 A:middle
on stage to show
what they've built.

[ Applause ]

00:45:06.376 --> 00:45:09.126 A:middle
Last week, we reached out
to Crytek, they're working

00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:14.496 A:middle
on their new iOS application
collectibles and they came in

00:45:15.456 --> 00:45:18.316 A:middle
and integrated game controllers
into their application.

00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:20.136 A:middle
Within a day, they had a
standard controller working.

00:45:20.746 --> 00:45:25.386 A:middle
What you have here is a tactical
action game and this is running

00:45:25.386 --> 00:45:29.456 A:middle
on the iPhone and you can use
the controller using the D-pad

00:45:29.586 --> 00:45:31.686 A:middle
for relative movements
to avoid those explosions

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:35.356 A:middle
and advance his squad,
as he advances his squad,

00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:36.786 A:middle
he get -- comes under fire.

00:45:36.786 --> 00:45:38.076 A:middle
What he now can do
is hit a button

00:45:38.276 --> 00:45:39.366 A:middle
to move the squad to cover.

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:41.276 A:middle
He finds that he wants

00:45:41.276 --> 00:45:43.516 A:middle
to directly manipulate
some of his troops.

00:45:43.516 --> 00:45:46.596 A:middle
What he can do is he can use
at the touch interface to touch

00:45:46.596 --> 00:45:48.686 A:middle
on a troop and he can
drag it specifically

00:45:48.686 --> 00:45:50.076 A:middle
to a point he wants
deploy them at.

00:45:50.436 --> 00:45:53.966 A:middle
But this allows a great hybrid
mix of the game controller

00:45:54.196 --> 00:45:55.426 A:middle
and the Direct-Touch interface.

00:45:57.256 --> 00:45:59.216 A:middle
He finds his squad
gets in a little --

[ Applause ]

00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:04.566 A:middle
He finds -- he gets
in a little trouble,

00:46:04.566 --> 00:46:06.856 A:middle
he can hit the shoulder button,
calling some air support,

00:46:06.856 --> 00:46:10.036 A:middle
now the D-pad switches over to
controlling his air support.

00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:16.316 A:middle
Beautiful job, very little time
integrating controller setup

00:46:16.646 --> 00:46:18.476 A:middle
into this game, brilliant

00:46:18.896 --> 00:46:20.076 A:middle
Tremendous job by Crytek

00:46:20.076 --> 00:46:23.196 A:middle
and then you can go,

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.566 A:middle
So we want to make you --

00:46:33.566 --> 00:46:36.146 A:middle
get you guys jump-started
on working with controllers.

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:37.386 A:middle
We've worked with Logitech,

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:39.636 A:middle
put some standard
snapping controllers

00:46:39.816 --> 00:46:41.816 A:middle
in the labs this week
and they'll be --

00:46:41.816 --> 00:46:44.506 A:middle
so tomorrow, you can head down
to the labs with your code

00:46:44.786 --> 00:46:46.276 A:middle
and get a jump-start
on developing

00:46:46.276 --> 00:46:49.256 A:middle
for controllers integrating
them to your application.

00:46:52.556 --> 00:46:55.386 A:middle
So we've talked about a lot
of things in game development,

00:46:55.526 --> 00:46:58.466 A:middle
two new APIs, Sprite Kit
and game controllers.

and a text [inaudible]
generator.

00:47:03.366 --> 00:47:04.636 A:middle
We have new game samples.

00:47:04.766 --> 00:47:05.926 A:middle
We showed you one
of them, adventure,

00:47:05.926 --> 00:47:08.056 A:middle
we also have a turn
based puzzle game.

00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:10.176 A:middle
These samples are
production quality code,

00:47:10.176 --> 00:47:11.606 A:middle
they're fully documented

00:47:11.836 --> 00:47:14.036 A:middle
and a code displaying cell
documentation allow you --

00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:15.586 A:middle
allowing you to grab that,

00:47:16.116 --> 00:47:18.206 A:middle
use it to start your next
application or take a piece

00:47:18.206 --> 00:47:21.076 A:middle
of technology out of it and add
it to your current application.

00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:23.336 A:middle
So I can't wait to see --

00:47:23.536 --> 00:47:25.736 A:middle
I can't wait to see
what you guys build

00:47:25.736 --> 00:47:29.276 A:middle
with our new game technology
and I'd like to hand it back

00:47:29.276 --> 00:47:32.536 A:middle
over to Andreas to talk
about OS X Mavericks.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Jeff.

00:47:41.416 --> 00:47:44.096 A:middle
Our gaming technologies have we,
come a long way just last year

00:47:44.096 --> 00:47:46.556 A:middle
and I'm already looking forward
to wasting even more of my time

00:47:46.556 --> 00:47:49.186 A:middle
with the new creations
you come up with.

00:47:49.186 --> 00:47:49.476 A:middle
All right.

00:47:49.476 --> 00:47:50.936 A:middle
Let's talk about OS X Mavericks.

00:47:51.916 --> 00:47:55.336 A:middle
So Mavericks, the big
architectural focus area is

00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:56.836 A:middle
optimizing power consumption.

00:47:57.246 --> 00:48:00.656 A:middle
All of us here are already
used to optimizing our apps

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:00.656 --> 00:48:03.446 A:middle
for low memory use and
low CPU utilization.

00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:06.776 A:middle
But the majority of computers
used nowadays are laptops

00:48:06.946 --> 00:48:10.846 A:middle
and mobile users really also
care about long battery life.

00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:14.966 A:middle
These added several features to
Mavericks that allows end users

00:48:14.966 --> 00:48:16.776 A:middle
to understand the
power consumption

00:48:16.776 --> 00:48:18.076 A:middle
of the apps they're
using better.

00:48:18.326 --> 00:48:20.946 A:middle
For example, by listing
how are hungry apps

00:48:20.946 --> 00:48:23.336 A:middle
in the battery menu extra
and in activity monitor.

00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:25.946 A:middle
And you probably don't want
your apps to show up there.

00:48:26.221 --> 00:48:28.221 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:48:28.426 --> 00:48:30.396 A:middle
The good news is
that the following --

00:48:30.396 --> 00:48:33.836 A:middle
a few very straightforward
rules like not using unnecessary

00:48:34.126 --> 00:48:37.236 A:middle
or too frequent timers, you can
often achieve great results.

00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:40.216 A:middle
This slide here shows
a comparison of OS X,

00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:43.336 A:middle
10.8 and 10.9 running
on the same hardware.

00:48:43.956 --> 00:48:46.586 A:middle
As you can see, just two
software changes, we were able

00:48:46.586 --> 00:48:49.236 A:middle
to squeeze out significant
improvements to battery life

00:48:49.236 --> 00:48:53.396 A:middle
and so can you in your own apps.

00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:56.386 A:middle
Another big focus area
for us was responsiveness

00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:59.686 A:middle
such as the scroll speed of
table use and the smoothness

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:00.936 A:middle
of animations and switching

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:00.936 --> 00:49:02.356 A:middle
between different
application states.

00:49:02.886 --> 00:49:05.626 A:middle
You saw this morning in the key
note how nicely made [inaudible]

00:49:05.626 --> 00:49:08.756 A:middle
and Safari, now react
to user events.

00:49:09.306 --> 00:49:13.006 A:middle
Now one problem is that
optimizing power consumption

00:49:13.496 --> 00:49:16.986 A:middle
and preparing an app for great
responsiveness can sometimes

00:49:17.046 --> 00:49:17.976 A:middle
trade often each other.

00:49:18.526 --> 00:49:20.416 A:middle
So the trick is to
find the right balance,

00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:23.066 A:middle
the right intersection between
power and responsiveness.

00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:26.096 A:middle
Let's take a look at a few
things within the Mavericks

00:49:26.156 --> 00:49:27.986 A:middle
that you believe
represent the right choices.

00:49:29.356 --> 00:49:30.716 A:middle
We implemented new mechanisms

00:49:30.816 --> 00:49:32.766 A:middle
that vastly improved
memory management.

00:49:33.546 --> 00:49:36.026 A:middle
We introduced in our scrolling
architecture in App Kit

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:40.976 A:middle
and of course we added the new
App Net feature which started,

00:49:40.976 --> 00:49:44.796 A:middle
it's the power consumption
of background with apps.

00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:48.176 A:middle
For memory, we've now
centralized all our management

00:49:48.176 --> 00:49:51.326 A:middle
policies which makes the OS more
efficient and more predictable.

00:49:53.006 --> 00:49:55.816 A:middle
For several releases
already, we have notified apps

00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:58.416 A:middle
if you needed their help
because memory pressure

00:49:58.416 --> 00:49:59.686 A:middle
in the system had
reached the level --

00:49:59.686 --> 00:50:01.416 A:middle
that we needed to free
some extra memory.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:05.176 A:middle
But they only notified once we
had already reached a very high

00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:06.106 A:middle
level of memory pressure.

00:50:06.496 --> 00:50:08.846 A:middle
So in general, apps didn't
really know what was going

00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:11.246 A:middle
on around them and
then it was okay again

00:50:11.246 --> 00:50:12.296 A:middle
to become more aggressive.

00:50:12.556 --> 00:50:13.566 A:middle
That's using more memory.

00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:16.086 A:middle
So we're improving this in
two ways and [inaudible].

00:50:16.636 --> 00:50:17.856 A:middle
First of all, they're going

00:50:17.906 --> 00:50:20.516 A:middle
to send you two notifications
why the memory pressure

00:50:20.516 --> 00:50:21.106 A:middle
is increasing.

00:50:22.096 --> 00:50:25.616 A:middle
An early warning and also a
critical level notification.

00:50:25.616 --> 00:50:29.016 A:middle
And then we're also going to
send you an all clear signal

00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:32.426 A:middle
if the memory drops back down
to normal levels then it's okay

00:50:32.426 --> 00:50:35.076 A:middle
for you for example to create
larger in-memory caches again.

00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.916 A:middle
So by listening to all
this notifications,

00:50:38.146 --> 00:50:40.306 A:middle
apps can now make much
more informed decisions

00:50:40.306 --> 00:50:42.106 A:middle
about their memory use.

00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:46.646 A:middle
We've also improved all
purgeable memory handling

00:50:46.646 --> 00:50:48.206 A:middle
and made it actually
predictable.

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:52.166 A:middle
Instead of purging memory based
on age, you now purge based

00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:53.876 A:middle
on the memory pressure
in the system.

00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:55.976 A:middle
And they're allowing apps

00:50:56.066 --> 00:50:59.116 A:middle
to specify more fine-grained
priorities to indicate

00:50:59.116 --> 00:51:01.256 A:middle
which regions are best
to take down first.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:02.516 --> 00:51:05.816 A:middle
Unlike low memory notifications,
purgeable memory is designed

00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:07.416 A:middle
so that the system
can free memory

00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:09.076 A:middle
without unvoiding any apps.

00:51:09.406 --> 00:51:10.776 A:middle
So it's quicker and
it's cheaper.

00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:14.686 A:middle
And with the new behavior,
it is a lot more useful now.

00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:18.146 A:middle
The easiest way for you to
leverage purgeable memory is

00:51:18.146 --> 00:51:23.146 A:middle
through our Libcache
and NSCache APIs.

00:51:23.356 --> 00:51:24.806 A:middle
We've also added a compressor

00:51:24.806 --> 00:51:26.736 A:middle
to the memory management
techniques you now use

00:51:26.736 --> 00:51:27.246 A:middle
in Mavericks.

00:51:28.026 --> 00:51:30.386 A:middle
Instead of swapping out
memory directly to disc,

00:51:30.846 --> 00:51:33.076 A:middle
you're now freeing pages
by compressing them

00:51:33.136 --> 00:51:34.476 A:middle
in an intermediate stage,

00:51:35.186 --> 00:51:37.286 A:middle
which dramatically
improves responsiveness

00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:42.136 A:middle
to memory regress, because
there is no I/O needed.

00:51:43.176 --> 00:51:45.186 A:middle
And if you do have to
swap out to disc later,

00:51:45.186 --> 00:51:48.226 A:middle
we can do so in an asynchronous
fashion that's larger,

00:51:48.346 --> 00:51:49.776 A:middle
more uniformed chunks of memory.

00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:52.536 A:middle
It also has a really nice
side effect of swap --

00:51:52.936 --> 00:51:55.416 A:middle
side effect of swapped
files staying smaller

00:51:55.486 --> 00:51:56.516 A:middle
and less fragmented.

00:51:57.816 --> 00:52:00.796 A:middle
So all this memory management
techniques now work together

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:00.796 --> 00:52:04.326 A:middle
in Mavericks to give us the
most efficient memory management

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:08.876 A:middle
system you've ever had in OS X.

00:52:09.116 --> 00:52:11.146 A:middle
Next, our scrolling
architecture.

00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:13.866 A:middle
To improve responsiveness
of scroll views,

00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:16.696 A:middle
you've completely reinvent
all the scrolling architecture

00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:17.236 A:middle
in AppKit.

00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:20.916 A:middle
To maybe achieve the smooth
scrolling you observed this

00:52:20.916 --> 00:52:22.986 A:middle
morning and in [inaudible]
calendar is

00:52:22.986 --> 00:52:24.506 A:middle
that you're now pregenerating

00:52:24.506 --> 00:52:27.776 A:middle
and buffering additional review
content beyond the visible view

00:52:27.776 --> 00:52:30.746 A:middle
areas and just scrolling
that content with the help

00:52:30.746 --> 00:52:33.376 A:middle
of core animation just makes
it hardware accelerated.

00:52:34.706 --> 00:52:36.326 A:middle
So let's say we have
a scroll view

00:52:36.326 --> 00:52:38.596 A:middle
that shows a portion
of a larger document.

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.286 A:middle
AppKit will now ask
the application

00:52:41.286 --> 00:52:44.166 A:middle
to render extra content
in small chunks

00:52:44.376 --> 00:52:46.016 A:middle
when the system is
otherwise idle?

00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:51.996 A:middle
Notice that we are not
changing the threading model

00:52:51.996 --> 00:52:53.256 A:middle
of AppKit in any way.

00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:54.966 A:middle
All the rendering
still takes place

00:52:54.966 --> 00:52:56.716 A:middle
on the main thread as usual.

00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.646 A:middle
But since this happens
in small chunks as long

00:52:59.646 --> 00:53:02.056 A:middle
as your application can render
that content quickly enough

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:04.786 A:middle
if we never block them in main
thread for long and interfere

00:53:04.786 --> 00:53:05.746 A:middle
with the user in any way.

00:53:06.906 --> 00:53:09.676 A:middle
Also, so that we can easily give
the memory back to the system

00:53:09.676 --> 00:53:11.316 A:middle
in case we get in the
high memory pressure,

00:53:11.936 --> 00:53:14.776 A:middle
they're storing this overdraw
of content in purgeable memory.

00:53:15.486 --> 00:53:20.386 A:middle
Now, when the user
initiates a scored event,

00:53:20.476 --> 00:53:23.026 A:middle
AppKit can respond
immediately [inaudible]

00:53:23.026 --> 00:53:24.286 A:middle
of the available overdraw.

00:53:25.026 --> 00:53:27.436 A:middle
So AppKit will stop
at the attempt scoring

00:53:27.436 --> 00:53:29.936 A:middle
with a perfect 60
frames a second as long

00:53:29.936 --> 00:53:31.766 A:middle
as there are sufficient
overdraw available,

00:53:32.206 --> 00:53:34.286 A:middle
but at the same time
right from the beginning

00:53:34.286 --> 00:53:36.876 A:middle
of the event working with your
app to draw even more content

00:53:36.876 --> 00:53:37.976 A:middle
for the download document.

00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:40.936 A:middle
So chances are that by the time
the scored event has reached

00:53:40.936 --> 00:53:43.556 A:middle
these new areas, the
application is already had time

00:53:43.556 --> 00:53:45.216 A:middle
to finish rendering
those as well.

00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:48.076 A:middle
And the net result is
that became as long

00:53:48.076 --> 00:53:49.376 A:middle
as your application can render

00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:52.066 A:middle
that content quickly
enough often achieve better,

00:53:52.066 --> 00:53:55.726 A:middle
smooth 60 frames a second
for the entire scroll event.

00:53:58.716 --> 00:54:01.286 A:middle
Responsive scrolling
takes effect automatically

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:04.456 A:middle
for most applications linked
against our latest tested case.

00:54:04.456 --> 00:54:06.806 A:middle
There is no special
adoption required,

00:54:07.316 --> 00:54:09.106 A:middle
but they did add a few
methods to end this view

00:54:09.106 --> 00:54:10.796 A:middle
and in the scroll
view that allow you

00:54:10.796 --> 00:54:11.966 A:middle
to customize the behavior

00:54:11.966 --> 00:54:13.846 A:middle
in case your application
has special needs.

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:18.066 A:middle
Next, let's talk about App Nap.

00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.056 A:middle
The perhaps most
effective way we found

00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:22.646 A:middle
to lower power consumption

00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:24.996 A:middle
of the overall system is
the new App Nap feature.

00:54:25.906 --> 00:54:28.356 A:middle
It focuses system
resources on the user --

00:54:28.356 --> 00:54:30.786 A:middle
on the work that made us the
most to the user right now,

00:54:31.396 --> 00:54:34.096 A:middle
while at the same time
drastically scaling back the

00:54:34.096 --> 00:54:37.196 A:middle
resources being offered to
applications that aren't

00:54:37.196 --> 00:54:40.676 A:middle
as critical to the user
at this point in time.

00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:43.076 A:middle
App Nap takes effect
after a short delay,

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:47.346 A:middle
but once an application naps if
it see a reduction in priority

00:54:47.486 --> 00:54:50.946 A:middle
for I/O and CPU --
for I/O and CPU time.

00:54:51.846 --> 00:54:54.586 A:middle
And also, maybe most
importantly, if it see any time

00:54:54.586 --> 00:54:56.676 A:middle
as it sets up being
rate limited.

00:54:58.176 --> 00:55:01.866 A:middle
We found that unnecessary, in
two frequent timers and one

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:03.006 A:middle
of the largest sources

00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:05.186 A:middle
of unnecessary power
drain in the system.

00:55:05.606 --> 00:55:09.246 A:middle
So we are quite aggressive with
our RAID limiting, napping apps,

00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:12.426 A:middle
received events, time events,
only every 10 seconds or so.

00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:15.586 A:middle
And the -- even aligning the
time as of all the napping apps

00:55:15.616 --> 00:55:18.336 A:middle
so that don't end up breaking
up the CPU individually,

00:55:18.486 --> 00:55:20.976 A:middle
but instead perform their work
together at the same time.

00:55:22.846 --> 00:55:24.756 A:middle
To decide whether an
application can nap,

00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:26.506 A:middle
we take a look at manufactures.

00:55:26.966 --> 00:55:28.536 A:middle
The decision is fairly
easy if a user

00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.086 A:middle
for example hides
an application.

00:55:30.656 --> 00:55:32.096 A:middle
But the -- even monitoring
things

00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:34.226 A:middle
like drawing activity
of backgrounded apps.

00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:35.756 A:middle
So that applications that are

00:55:35.756 --> 00:55:37.756 A:middle
in the background may
be possibly occluded

00:55:37.756 --> 00:55:40.536 A:middle
by other windows to
-- for you to App Nap

00:55:40.756 --> 00:55:44.926 A:middle
if they don't update the
UI in any visible way.

00:55:45.446 --> 00:55:46.356 A:middle
Another factor we take

00:55:46.356 --> 00:55:48.846 A:middle
into consideration is whether
applications have declared

00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:49.826 A:middle
in power assertions.

00:55:50.516 --> 00:55:53.066 A:middle
This is an area that is going to
be more important going forward.

00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:55.116 A:middle
Applications need
to tell the system

00:55:55.516 --> 00:55:58.256 A:middle
if they are performing any work
that the user still expects

00:55:58.256 --> 00:55:59.746 A:middle
to finish quickly even

00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:01.466 A:middle
if the application is
being backgrounded.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:01.826 --> 00:56:03.576 A:middle
For example, a long
running file export.

00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:05.936 A:middle
And the easiest way
to do that as

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:09.476 A:middle
to the new NSProcessInfo API
was listed here on the slide.

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.626 A:middle
Now, to show you a little bit
more about how App Nap works,

00:56:13.796 --> 00:56:15.346 A:middle
I'm going to ask
Max Drukman to come

00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:16.906 A:middle
up on stage again
for another demo.

00:56:18.516 --> 00:56:22.496 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:56:22.996 --> 00:56:25.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you [inaudible].

00:56:25.096 --> 00:56:28.156 A:middle
Can we switch to the
demo machine, please?

00:56:28.156 --> 00:56:28.396 A:middle
All right.

00:56:29.036 --> 00:56:31.976 A:middle
Here is the Mac version of the
game I was working on earlier

00:56:31.976 --> 00:56:35.046 A:middle
and now we can all thrill as
I implement power assertions.

00:56:35.786 --> 00:56:37.266 A:middle
Now, just kidding.

00:56:37.726 --> 00:56:41.196 A:middle
I'm going to show you App Nap
in action and some features

00:56:41.196 --> 00:56:45.576 A:middle
in Xcode 5 of course that
can help you spot performance

00:56:45.576 --> 00:56:47.436 A:middle
problems you might not
have known you had.

00:56:48.436 --> 00:56:50.606 A:middle
We're going to run my app.

00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:52.576 A:middle
Here it is.

00:56:52.606 --> 00:56:55.856 A:middle
But before we look at the
app, let's look at Xcode

00:56:56.056 --> 00:56:57.496 A:middle
and see what it's showing us.

00:56:58.176 --> 00:57:01.496 A:middle
I'm going to zoom in
so we get a good look.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:01.696 --> 00:57:03.626 A:middle
Now, in the debug navigator,

00:57:04.016 --> 00:57:06.676 A:middle
we showed you what we
were calling debug gauges.

00:57:07.186 --> 00:57:10.626 A:middle
There is one each for CPU,
memory and energy impact.

00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:14.076 A:middle
There's super low
overhead and they're great

00:57:14.076 --> 00:57:16.706 A:middle
for spotting problems
with your app.

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:21.606 A:middle
Here we can see that my app
is taking, well, zero CPU,

00:57:21.886 --> 00:57:26.276 A:middle
the memory is stable and the
energy impact is low to zero.

00:57:26.786 --> 00:57:29.236 A:middle
That means this view in
this app is doing great.

00:57:29.236 --> 00:57:30.366 A:middle
It's a good citizen.

00:57:30.856 --> 00:57:32.546 A:middle
Nothing much to see
here, move along.

00:57:33.126 --> 00:57:36.266 A:middle
But now let me show
you a problem scenario

00:57:36.726 --> 00:57:38.726 A:middle
that in the past was
kind of hard to spot.

00:57:39.746 --> 00:57:42.366 A:middle
I'm implementing a new
feature behind this map button.

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:46.496 A:middle
And what that does is it allows
my users to bring up a level map

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:50.136 A:middle
in the game and see where they
are as represented by this pin

00:57:50.136 --> 00:57:54.416 A:middle
in the center as well as
other players around the world

00:57:54.526 --> 00:57:56.116 A:middle
who were playing
on the same level.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:02.206 A:middle
Now, the position of the other
players is provided by a server.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:58:02.776 --> 00:58:04.426 A:middle
There are obviously
aren't any players yet,

00:58:04.426 --> 00:58:07.386 A:middle
I'm still developing here,
but the codes in place

00:58:07.386 --> 00:58:08.536 A:middle
to provide that information.

00:58:09.656 --> 00:58:13.026 A:middle
But if we look back
in Xcode we can see

00:58:13.026 --> 00:58:13.866 A:middle
that there is some trouble.

00:58:14.766 --> 00:58:19.456 A:middle
My CPU and energy impact
gauges have spiked up

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:21.546 A:middle
and kind of stayed there.

00:58:22.036 --> 00:58:23.726 A:middle
Let's have a closer look.

00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:26.926 A:middle
When you select a
debug gauge in Xcode,

00:58:27.246 --> 00:58:29.886 A:middle
you see its report
in the editor area.

00:58:30.796 --> 00:58:34.966 A:middle
The report gives you the
current status as well as a view

00:58:34.966 --> 00:58:39.486 A:middle
over time and a button that
even allows you to dive directly

00:58:39.486 --> 00:58:42.436 A:middle
into instruments right away
if there's a problem you spot

00:58:42.796 --> 00:58:44.406 A:middle
and wants to deeply analyze.

00:58:46.996 --> 00:58:49.256 A:middle
The memory report is similar

00:58:49.336 --> 00:58:51.526 A:middle
with the current
and overtime views.

00:58:52.376 --> 00:58:57.226 A:middle
Energy impact provides that data
as well as your App Nap status

00:58:57.856 --> 00:59:01.996 A:middle
and various aspects
of power usage.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:02.456 --> 00:59:05.996 A:middle
Each of which has a button
that allows you to analyze

00:59:06.106 --> 00:59:08.316 A:middle
that aspect in the instruments.

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:12.546 A:middle
Now, let's start with CPU here.

00:59:12.906 --> 00:59:17.576 A:middle
High CPU usage is often
associated with drawing,

00:59:17.576 --> 00:59:20.626 A:middle
but it sure doesn't look like
my app is doing any drawing.

00:59:21.446 --> 00:59:23.956 A:middle
Luckily, Xcode 5 has
given us something

00:59:23.956 --> 00:59:25.086 A:middle
that can help us with that.

00:59:26.046 --> 00:59:30.736 A:middle
We've added Cocoa view debugging
support so I can do something

00:59:30.736 --> 00:59:32.386 A:middle
like turn on view drawing.

00:59:33.646 --> 00:59:37.836 A:middle
And now, every time a view
redraws, I get a highlight.

00:59:38.516 --> 00:59:42.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:59:43.366 --> 00:59:45.716 A:middle
Oh, well, you may be thrilled
by that but of course,

00:59:45.986 --> 00:59:48.886 A:middle
what this tells me is that I
didn't do a very clever thing.

00:59:48.886 --> 00:59:51.956 A:middle
My map pin is redrawing itself
all the time even though it

00:59:51.956 --> 00:59:52.586 A:middle
isn't moving.

00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:56.486 A:middle
The one clever thing I did do,
however, is add a debug menu

00:59:57.316 --> 00:59:58.936 A:middle
so I can turn off draw updating.

00:59:59.506 --> 01:00:01.416 A:middle
There, problem solved.

[ Laughter ]

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.946 A:middle
Now, my CPU is looking good

01:00:05.946 --> 01:00:08.376 A:middle
but my energy impact
is still kind of high.

01:00:09.046 --> 01:00:11.026 A:middle
Let's see if App Nap
helps us with that.

01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:19.296 A:middle
I'm going to maximize Xcode
so that my app is behind

01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:22.056 A:middle
and would -- should
get App Nap to kick in.

01:00:22.696 --> 01:00:25.586 A:middle
Now, on this machine, I've
set App Nap to kick in quicker

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:29.036 A:middle
than normal and hopefully we're
going to see it any second now.

01:00:29.606 --> 01:00:32.976 A:middle
And, there it goes.

01:00:33.626 --> 01:00:39.296 A:middle
Now, App Nap has done its
thing and my app is now driven

01:00:39.366 --> 01:00:43.466 A:middle
to zero energy usage or almost.

01:00:44.346 --> 01:00:48.626 A:middle
Notice that I'm getting
little blips on the graph.

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.856 A:middle
Now, as Andreas told us earlier,

01:00:51.156 --> 01:00:52.976 A:middle
that's indicative
of a timer firing.

01:00:53.586 --> 01:00:55.896 A:middle
And sure enough, I've
got a timer firing.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:57.436 A:middle
Yet another bad pattern.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:01.596 A:middle
I've gone with here is that
my app is pulling the server

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:06.846 A:middle
for user updates instead of
waiting for a notification.

01:01:07.396 --> 01:01:08.876 A:middle
That's not a great
design pattern

01:01:09.176 --> 01:01:12.476 A:middle
but it's one who's impact was
kind of tough to spot before.

01:01:12.896 --> 01:01:15.846 A:middle
After all, I wasn't seeing
poor graphics performance

01:01:16.216 --> 01:01:19.196 A:middle
or beach balling
or my fan spinning.

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:22.826 A:middle
But that doesn't mean there
wasn't a significant energy

01:01:22.826 --> 01:01:23.956 A:middle
impact going on.

01:01:25.436 --> 01:01:29.566 A:middle
So, even though App Nap does
the right thing for your users,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.296 A:middle
it really pays to
do the extra work

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:37.226 A:middle
to make your app also a good
energy citizen whether it's

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.196 A:middle
active or it's napping.

01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:41.616 A:middle
And Xcode 5 gives
you the tools to make

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:43.496 A:middle
that possible and easy to do.

01:01:44.886 --> 01:01:45.546 A:middle
Back to you, Andreas.

01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:52.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:53.626 A:middle
Thank you, Max.

01:01:54.976 --> 01:01:57.176 A:middle
There's a few more
APIs and behaviors I'd

01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.756 A:middle
like to cover starting with
our new margin monitor support

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:02:01.226 --> 01:02:04.486 A:middle
which makes using [inaudible]
displays even more powerful

01:02:04.486 --> 01:02:05.276 A:middle
and flexible.

01:02:05.276 --> 01:02:07.676 A:middle
Do you think this is going
to work especially great

01:02:07.676 --> 01:02:09.626 A:middle
for all pro-users who often work

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.386 A:middle
with multiple apps
at the same time?

01:02:11.846 --> 01:02:13.636 A:middle
And by the way, it also
works well to the Xcode

01:02:13.636 --> 01:02:15.176 A:middle
that you can run
Xcode on one screen

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:17.136 A:middle
and the back end application
on the other screen.

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:21.356 A:middle
Now, we also believe
that the new behavior

01:02:21.356 --> 01:02:23.796 A:middle
to make it more likely that
users will choose to go

01:02:23.796 --> 01:02:24.886 A:middle
into full screen modes.

01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:27.936 A:middle
So now more than ever it's
worth spending the extra time

01:02:27.936 --> 01:02:29.946 A:middle
on implementing a great
full screen experience

01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:33.076 A:middle
in your own apps.

01:02:33.326 --> 01:02:36.016 A:middle
Now, there's a few behaviors you
might have felt like in the past

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.396 A:middle
that don't hold through anymore.

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:41.096 A:middle
Most importantly, there's no
distinction between primary

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.236 A:middle
and secondary displays.

01:02:43.036 --> 01:02:44.466 A:middle
So, an app cannot assume anymore

01:02:44.466 --> 01:02:46.706 A:middle
that it has the entire
screen available to itself

01:02:46.706 --> 01:02:48.856 A:middle
on another display
because now the doc

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:50.766 A:middle
and the Menu bar show
up there as well.

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.886 A:middle
You might want to validate
that your apps behave properly

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.226 A:middle
under these new conditions
before we ship Mavericks later

01:02:56.226 --> 01:02:56.786 A:middle
this year.

01:02:57.246 --> 01:03:01.866 A:middle
Another exciting change in
Mavericks is the TVs can now act

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:03:01.866 --> 01:03:04.066 A:middle
as fully independent
displays via AirPlay.

01:03:04.066 --> 01:03:05.606 A:middle
AirPlay is not limited

01:03:05.606 --> 01:03:07.366 A:middle
to mirroring the
primary screen anymore.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:09.886 A:middle
That opens up whole new
ways for you to innovate.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:13.456 A:middle
If your apps would benefit from
the special presenter display,

01:03:14.026 --> 01:03:16.016 A:middle
AirPlay is now an even
more attractive option.

01:03:16.366 --> 01:03:17.426 A:middle
We're looking very much forward

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.376 A:middle
to the new ideas you guys
are going to come up with

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:21.006 A:middle
to leverage this new capability.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.176 A:middle
Next is Map Kit.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.616 A:middle
If you brought Map
Kit over to the Mac,

01:03:27.616 --> 01:03:30.476 A:middle
that's practically the
identical API that many

01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:32.556 A:middle
of you are already
familiar with from iOS.

01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:35.496 A:middle
So you can now have beautiful
fast vector-based maps

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.466 A:middle
integrated with your
Mac apps as well.

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:40.786 A:middle
In addition to creating the
actual maps application,

01:03:41.116 --> 01:03:43.066 A:middle
they started using this
new API [inaudible]

01:03:43.066 --> 01:03:44.416 A:middle
in Mavericks in various ways.

01:03:44.976 --> 01:03:46.796 A:middle
For example, by adding
a new data detector,

01:03:47.136 --> 01:03:49.596 A:middle
all by supporting map
locations in the calendar app.

01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:54.426 A:middle
Map Kit is a really fantastic
edition to the OS X API.

01:03:54.426 --> 01:03:57.966 A:middle
And just like with our other
cloud services based APIs,

01:03:58.386 --> 01:04:00.826 A:middle
it's available to apps shipping
through the Mac App Store

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:03.206 A:middle
that declare the use of
Map Kit as a capability.

01:04:03.826 --> 01:04:08.376 A:middle
Now, there's numerous
more APIs in Mavericks

01:04:08.456 --> 01:04:10.156 A:middle
that I do not have time
to cover in this session.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.866 A:middle
AppKit has a fantastic
new stack view.

01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:15.106 A:middle
They even added things
like vec notifications.

01:04:15.486 --> 01:04:18.286 A:middle
But you'll also push
notifications to a Mac even

01:04:18.286 --> 01:04:20.026 A:middle
if you don't have a
native application for it.

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.966 A:middle
You can learn about
many of these APIs here

01:04:22.966 --> 01:04:24.266 A:middle
in later sessions
at the conference.

01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:27.156 A:middle
But for now, I'm going to
hand over to Matthew Firlik

01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:28.676 A:middle
to tell you more about Xcode 5.

01:04:29.516 --> 01:04:36.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:38.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Andreas.

01:04:39.696 --> 01:04:42.176 A:middle
Xcode 5 is our latest
tools release

01:04:42.506 --> 01:04:44.846 A:middle
for iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

01:04:45.056 --> 01:04:47.916 A:middle
And it is packed with features
I think you guys are going

01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:49.416 A:middle
to love.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:53.016 A:middle
From the earlier demonstrations
you've seen Xcode's new clean

01:04:53.116 --> 01:04:54.076 A:middle
interface design.

01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:58.706 A:middle
This design surfaces Xcode's
familiar workflows and features.

01:04:58.706 --> 01:05:01.716 A:middle
It works to minimize clatter
and really put the focus

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:05:01.756 --> 01:05:04.606 A:middle
on the controls and
your content.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.756 A:middle
To highlight your content,

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:09.406 A:middle
we'd worked to reduce
the application chrome.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.356 A:middle
Compared with the
previous release,

01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:13.756 A:middle
our toolbar is 30
percent smaller.

01:05:14.236 --> 01:05:16.236 A:middle
And its work is great
on small displays.

01:05:18.276 --> 01:05:20.526 A:middle
We've also focused on
improving the activity view.

01:05:20.946 --> 01:05:24.116 A:middle
You now see more details for
your activities, bigger icons

01:05:24.116 --> 01:05:27.766 A:middle
for issues, and overall
progress is much easier to see.

01:05:28.296 --> 01:05:31.896 A:middle
And throughout the interface,
you'll see our design focuses

01:05:31.896 --> 01:05:36.066 A:middle
on removing borders, simplifying
items, and through this use

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.246 A:middle
of a simple blue highlight
presenting a feeling

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:40.886 A:middle
of seamlessness and
fluidity throughout the ID.

01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:45.316 A:middle
Now, a focus on simplicity
does not mean a lost

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.636 A:middle
in functionality, actually
quite to the contrary.

01:05:48.096 --> 01:05:49.566 A:middle
In most cases, we were able

01:05:49.566 --> 01:05:52.356 A:middle
to put more functionality
in a smaller space.

01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:54.466 A:middle
The UI for looking

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:56.776 A:middle
at project-wide finds is
a really good example.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.576 A:middle
Comparing a new UI to the
previous release seen here

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:06:00.576 --> 01:06:02.686 A:middle
on the left, you can
see that we were able

01:06:02.686 --> 01:06:05.976 A:middle
to put the same functionality
in less than half of the space.

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:09.446 A:middle
And in a way that is
far easier to use.

01:06:10.706 --> 01:06:12.866 A:middle
Now, with the additional real
estate, we wanted to bring

01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:15.276 A:middle
to the surface even
more of your content.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.886 A:middle
In the previous Xcode release,
search results were shown

01:06:19.096 --> 01:06:20.836 A:middle
at a single line displace.

01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:23.516 A:middle
Xcode 5, we're bringing
in wrapping.

01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:26.946 A:middle
So, now, you can see even more
context for your search results.

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:32.406 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:33.706 A:middle
And if that wasn't enough

01:06:33.706 --> 01:06:36.176 A:middle
for bringing the same
display to issues as well.

01:06:36.486 --> 01:06:37.596 A:middle
So for errors and warnings --

01:06:38.516 --> 01:06:43.176 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:06:43.676 --> 01:06:45.886 A:middle
-- not that that you have
issues, but for all the errors

01:06:45.886 --> 01:06:48.146 A:middle
and warnings that might come
up for all the other guys,

01:06:48.396 --> 01:06:49.706 A:middle
you can see all of the details.

01:06:51.356 --> 01:06:54.936 A:middle
Now, another area of focus
for us is documentation.

01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:57.226 A:middle
And we have a brand
new interface for you.

01:06:58.076 --> 01:07:01.406 A:middle
Documentation is now its own
separate window using all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:07:01.406 --> 01:07:02.396 A:middle
of the new design elements.

01:07:03.316 --> 01:07:05.676 A:middle
Now, on top of some great
documentation content,

01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:08.206 A:middle
you now have better
and faster searching,

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:11.756 A:middle
scrollable search results,
tab based browsing,

01:07:12.186 --> 01:07:14.376 A:middle
and a great book marking
system so you can work

01:07:14.376 --> 01:07:16.436 A:middle
with multiple documents
really easily.

01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:22.496 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:25.056 A:middle
And if that wasn't enough,
once you find a document

01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:27.006 A:middle
that you like, the
new integrated table

01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:29.076 A:middle
of contents makes it
really easy to browse

01:07:29.116 --> 01:07:29.926 A:middle
and navigate the content.

01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:34.466 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:38.196 A:middle
You'll see elements of a new
design throughout our interface,

01:07:38.396 --> 01:07:41.656 A:middle
and it really focuses
on surfacing the value

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:44.876 A:middle
of the technologies that are
underneath because the same time

01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:47.516 A:middle
that we are changing things
you can see on the front end.

01:07:47.866 --> 01:07:50.946 A:middle
We were doing a lot of work
on the back ends too in ways

01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:54.056 A:middle
that you won't be able to see
but you will definitely feel.

01:07:55.286 --> 01:07:56.696 A:middle
Xcode 5 has been converted

01:07:56.696 --> 01:07:59.056 A:middle
over to Automatic
Reference Counting or ARC.

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:01.036 A:middle
And as part of this transition,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:08:01.316 --> 01:08:03.786 A:middle
we have some awesome performance
wins to share with you.

01:08:04.866 --> 01:08:08.436 A:middle
Many of the tasks, new perform
every day, are much faster

01:08:08.436 --> 01:08:10.676 A:middle
in Xcode 5, things
like searching

01:08:10.676 --> 01:08:13.196 A:middle
and incremental builds
are up to twice as fast.

01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:16.095 A:middle
And working with tabs, devices,

01:08:16.156 --> 01:08:18.395 A:middle
and project editor
is quicker than ever.

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:24.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:27.676 A:middle
Inside and out, Xcode
5 really sings.

01:08:28.926 --> 01:08:31.466 A:middle
So on top of the new UI
and its great foundation

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:34.805 A:middle
of faster technologies, we've
built some amazing new features.

01:08:35.076 --> 01:08:37.206 A:middle
And it starts with
interface design.

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:42.026 A:middle
Xcode 5 provides access to
the latest views and controls

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.296 A:middle
for iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.725 A:middle
So, you can get started today
using all of these new UIs

01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:49.616 A:middle
and features in your
application.

01:08:50.696 --> 01:08:54.206 A:middle
And, Max demonstrated three new
editions to our design tools.

01:08:54.606 --> 01:08:57.636 A:middle
The new workflow for Auto
Layout, the Asset Catalog,

01:08:58.006 --> 01:08:59.826 A:middle
and the new Preview
Assistant for iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:00.935 --> 01:09:03.196 A:middle
These features in concert
with other editions

01:09:03.196 --> 01:09:05.416 A:middle
to interface builder,
make it easy for you

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:08.316 A:middle
to design applications
that look and feel great

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:09.746 A:middle
for all of your users.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:12.805 A:middle
Now, Mac still a little
bit of the Thunder 2

01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:15.076 A:middle
and showed you another
great addition to Xcode 5

01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.236 A:middle
in the form of debug gauges.

01:09:18.326 --> 01:09:20.046 A:middle
The debug gauges
provide a way for you

01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:23.756 A:middle
to ensure your application is
behaving exactly as you expect.

01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:27.866 A:middle
You now have CPU memory and
other information available

01:09:27.866 --> 01:09:32.015 A:middle
to you at a glance and in a way
that is really easy to track.

01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:36.446 A:middle
The integrative reports
provide even more detail

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:38.106 A:middle
on the performance
of your application.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:40.416 A:middle
So you can dig in
when issues arise.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:45.886 A:middle
Now, as Max noted, the gauges
perform high level profiling

01:09:45.996 --> 01:09:48.856 A:middle
in a super efficient manner
so as not to interrupt

01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:50.746 A:middle
with your own applications
performance.

01:09:51.356 --> 01:09:52.776 A:middle
But when you need
more information,

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:55.556 A:middle
the power of instruments
is just a click away.

01:09:56.086 --> 01:09:58.586 A:middle
We'll launch a session
automatically configured

01:09:58.616 --> 01:10:01.406 A:middle
to your application and
you'll get all the information

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:02.606 A:middle
you need.

01:10:03.376 --> 01:10:09.066 A:middle
Now we have gauges for CPU,
memory and energy and two others

01:10:09.066 --> 01:10:11.356 A:middle
in the form of iCloud
and OpenGL ES.

01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:14.936 A:middle
And these gauges present
themselves automatically

01:10:15.206 --> 01:10:16.676 A:middle
when you start using
these technologies.

01:10:17.756 --> 01:10:20.076 A:middle
So we think debug gauges are
going to be a great way for you

01:10:20.076 --> 01:10:23.726 A:middle
to monitor, maintain, and
improve the performance

01:10:23.956 --> 01:10:24.846 A:middle
for your applications.

01:10:26.176 --> 01:10:28.446 A:middle
But we didn't stop there
because we have some other great

01:10:28.446 --> 01:10:30.836 A:middle
additions to the
debugging technologies.

01:10:31.316 --> 01:10:34.346 A:middle
First up, our debugging
services.

01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:38.356 A:middle
Xcode provides new functionality
to help you during development.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:41.576 A:middle
For example, we can
simulate a backgroundd fetch

01:10:41.776 --> 01:10:44.996 A:middle
for iOS 7 making it really easy
for you to adapt to the new API.

01:10:46.506 --> 01:10:50.016 A:middle
We can also simulate location
changes for iOS and OS X

01:10:50.676 --> 01:10:54.136 A:middle
which are great to use with
colocation and with maps.

01:10:54.956 --> 01:10:56.066 A:middle
And a cocoa view debugging

01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:58.926 A:middle
that Max demonstrated before
is a great way for you

01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:00.526 A:middle
to be interactive
with your application

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:11:00.946 --> 01:11:04.976 A:middle
and see things you might
not been able to before.

01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:08.676 A:middle
Another area of focus for us was
on presentation of variables.

01:11:09.756 --> 01:11:13.016 A:middle
A new variables view is
simple, clean, and compact.

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.406 A:middle
And the improvements of the data
formatters really highlight the

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:17.506 A:middle
essential information.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.786 A:middle
But, we know that not all
objects present themselves well

01:11:21.786 --> 01:11:23.816 A:middle
in summary or in textural form.

01:11:24.426 --> 01:11:26.656 A:middle
So for this release we've
integrated a technology

01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:29.476 A:middle
that should be very familiar
to you right in the debugger

01:11:29.956 --> 01:11:32.366 A:middle
in the form of Quick Look.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:36.006 A:middle
Now, in the variables
view and in the editor

01:11:36.866 --> 01:11:39.156 A:middle
across every variable, you
will see a Quick Look button.

01:11:39.746 --> 01:11:41.156 A:middle
And in this case, a poke

01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:43.066 A:middle
in the eye is actually
a really good thing.

01:11:44.616 --> 01:11:47.726 A:middle
We now have Quick Look support
for common geometric types

01:11:47.726 --> 01:11:50.906 A:middle
like points, rects,
sizes, and bezier paths.

Working with plain or
rich text, super easy.

01:12:03.956 --> 01:12:07.246 A:middle
Media types like images present
themselves really naturally.

01:12:08.646 --> 01:12:11.886 A:middle
Object types like Pads
and URLs actually resolve

01:12:11.886 --> 01:12:13.996 A:middle
to their remote content
whether it's a website

01:12:14.216 --> 01:12:15.526 A:middle
or a local document.

And when running
on OS X Mavericks,

01:12:22.146 --> 01:12:25.226 A:middle
locations present themselves
using the gorgeous new map view.

01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:29.606 A:middle
These are just a few

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.906 A:middle
of the Quick Look support
we've innovated in the debugger

01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:34.456 A:middle
and I'm absolutely certain you
guys are going to love this.

01:12:35.896 --> 01:12:39.466 A:middle
So the combination of debug
gauges, debug services,

01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:42.486 A:middle
and the Quick Look for
variables, all great ways

01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:44.066 A:middle
for you guys to get
more information

01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:45.326 A:middle
about your applications.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.196 A:middle
Now, debugging is generally

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:50.586 A:middle
about getting your application
into a working state.

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:54.616 A:middle
In contrast, unit testing is
about keeping it in that state.

01:12:55.856 --> 01:12:58.456 A:middle
We feel that testing is a
really essential component

01:12:58.606 --> 01:12:59.976 A:middle
to writing a great application.

And for this release,

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.546 A:middle
we're providing some new
powerful testing tools

01:13:03.806 --> 01:13:04.506 A:middle
for you to use.

01:13:05.246 --> 01:13:06.216 A:middle
And to show you a
little bit more,

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:07.486 A:middle

you demonstration.

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:18.266 A:middle
So here we have the
Adventure project that Max

01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:19.206 A:middle
and I have been working on.

01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:22.006 A:middle
Max has been adding some of
the configuration screens.

01:13:22.056 --> 01:13:25.086 A:middle
I've been working on adding
some new villainous characters

01:13:25.086 --> 01:13:26.646 A:middle
and some additional
game play options.

01:13:27.586 --> 01:13:29.926 A:middle
Now along the way, Max and I
have been writing unit tests

01:13:30.466 --> 01:13:32.276 A:middle
to make sure that
we're staying on track

01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:33.336 A:middle
and then we're not regressing.

01:13:33.936 --> 01:13:34.666 A:middle
And we've been using some

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.606 A:middle
of the new features
of Xcode 5 with that.

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.516 A:middle
One of the new features
I've been using is the new

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:41.576 A:middle
test navigator.

01:13:42.496 --> 01:13:43.886 A:middle
When I select here on
the left hand side,

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.446 A:middle
the test navigator now
shows you all of the tests

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:50.026 A:middle
for your project organized by
test class and by test case,

01:13:50.336 --> 01:13:53.236 A:middle
making it really easy for you
to navigate and select an item.

01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:57.376 A:middle
The navigator can show you all
of your tests or just the ones

01:13:57.606 --> 01:13:59.136 A:middle
that are configured for
your current scheme.

01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:02.606 A:middle
Now as you might expect,
I made some changes

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.496 A:middle
to my project right
before coming up on stage.

01:14:04.826 --> 01:14:07.046 A:middle
And I like to see how I'm doing.

01:14:07.896 --> 01:14:10.436 A:middle
So we'll go ahead and
perform the test command here

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:11.646 A:middle
and see the results.

01:14:12.396 --> 01:14:14.446 A:middle
And you can see that
the status for all

01:14:14.446 --> 01:14:17.016 A:middle
of my tests is now displayed
in the test navigator.

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.566 A:middle
All of the passing
tests are in green

01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:21.366 A:middle
and the failing tests
are in red.

01:14:22.116 --> 01:14:24.836 A:middle
We can see I have a couple red
icons here so we know that --

01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.906 A:middle
I probably shouldn't check
this code in quite yet.

01:14:28.356 --> 01:14:31.376 A:middle
Let's select one of
the failing tests.

01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:35.086 A:middle
This test is testing that
the chase radius for one

01:14:35.086 --> 01:14:37.076 A:middle
of my anime characters
is actually larger

01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:39.226 A:middle
than the character himself,
seems to make sense.

01:14:40.126 --> 01:14:41.776 A:middle
I'd like to actually
debug this test

01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:43.046 A:middle
to figure out why it's failing.

01:14:43.576 --> 01:14:46.326 A:middle
And to do that, I'm going to
use a new feature of Xcode 5.

01:14:47.076 --> 01:14:48.386 A:middle
I'll put a breakpoint
in my test.

01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:50.876 A:middle
But in order to just
work on this one test,

01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:53.156 A:middle
I'll hover over this indicator.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.666 A:middle
And you'll see it turns
into a play button.

01:14:55.446 --> 01:14:58.116 A:middle
This gives me the ability
to run just this one test.

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:07.466 A:middle
Actually, this feature
is even cooler.

01:15:07.996 --> 01:15:10.076 A:middle
Anywhere you see this
status icons you get the

01:15:10.076 --> 01:15:11.066 A:middle
same functionality.

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:12.506 A:middle
So if I clicked on the icon

01:15:12.506 --> 01:15:14.846 A:middle
at the class level it
would perform all the tests

01:15:14.846 --> 01:15:17.586 A:middle
in the class at the
bundle level, all the tests

01:15:17.586 --> 01:15:18.756 A:middle
with a bundle and so forth.

01:15:19.606 --> 01:15:21.346 A:middle
For this case, I just
want to run this one test.

01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:24.296 A:middle
So I click here, and
it's going to build

01:15:24.296 --> 01:15:25.886 A:middle
and now I'm stopped
here right into my test.

01:15:27.746 --> 01:15:30.456 A:middle
To debug this a little further,
I want to get some information

01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:33.036 A:middle
on the variables to make sure
that the values are as I expect.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.756 A:middle
I'll hover over the
chase radius here

01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:38.186 A:middle
and if you can look really
closely, a little tool that pop

01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:40.816 A:middle
up showing that that the value
is 8,000, that's correct,

01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:42.226 A:middle
that's what I expected to be.

01:15:43.216 --> 01:15:44.996 A:middle
Let's take a look
at this next piece.

01:15:44.996 --> 01:15:46.546 A:middle
I have an image for
the character.

01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:48.206 A:middle
I want to make sure
that it's the right one.

01:15:48.826 --> 01:15:51.676 A:middle
I'll hover over it and click
the little Quick Look icon

01:15:52.016 --> 01:15:52.576 A:middle
and there we go.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:53.976 A:middle

I said that's a picture
of my boss.

01:16:02.126 --> 01:16:04.136 A:middle
It's not actually a picture
of my boss, it's picture

01:16:04.136 --> 01:16:06.506 A:middle
of the character in the game.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:06.956 A:middle
All right.

01:16:07.226 --> 01:16:07.906 A:middle
Let's move on.

01:16:08.576 --> 01:16:10.456 A:middle
I can also check the size

01:16:10.456 --> 01:16:12.856 A:middle
of the character is correct
and that looks right.

01:16:12.856 --> 01:16:14.296 A:middle
You know what?

01:16:14.296 --> 01:16:15.166 A:middle
I see the problem here.

01:16:15.206 --> 01:16:16.536 A:middle
It's actually just
a logic error.

01:16:16.946 --> 01:16:18.766 A:middle
I use greater than
instead of less than.

01:16:19.296 --> 01:16:22.516 A:middle
So let me fix that and
remove my breakpoint.

01:16:22.976 --> 01:16:24.676 A:middle
And let's run the test
again to make sure

01:16:24.676 --> 01:16:27.286 A:middle
that that fix is correct.

01:16:27.436 --> 01:16:29.316 A:middle
And sure enough,
my test succeeds,

01:16:29.396 --> 01:16:32.056 A:middle
the indication is updated and
now I know that I can move on.

01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:35.126 A:middle
So just like that I was able
to use the navigator to get

01:16:35.126 --> 01:16:37.766 A:middle
to my tests that are failing,
used the status indication

01:16:37.766 --> 01:16:40.256 A:middle
in your workflows to
focus on this one test.

01:16:41.966 --> 01:16:44.386 A:middle
Now, we've seen the navigator,
I have some other failing tests.

01:16:44.906 --> 01:16:47.066 A:middle
They're little bit strewn
out across my project.

01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:49.406 A:middle
I'm going to turn on
the filter at the bottom

01:16:49.406 --> 01:16:51.856 A:middle
of the test navigator to show
me only the failing tests.

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:55.826 A:middle
Now, I see here that I
have three or four tests

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:59.766 A:middle
that look all the same and
are failing in a similar way.

Earlier, I added some new
functionality to the game,

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:04.446 A:middle
a new way for anime characters

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:05.846 A:middle
to meet their maker,
so to speak.

It's affectionately known
as splort [phonetic].

You can imagine what it does.

01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:13.896 A:middle
To test for this, I first
look for the characters health

01:17:14.006 --> 01:17:17.816 A:middle
to be non-zero beforehand,
tell them to splort

01:17:17.906 --> 01:17:20.466 A:middle
and then test afterwards
to see that is zero.

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.206 A:middle
This test is failing.

01:17:22.936 --> 01:17:24.816 A:middle
Now the test itself
is relatively simple,

01:17:25.116 --> 01:17:26.686 A:middle
so it's probably
somewhere in my AppLogic.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:29.166 A:middle
That's okay, we can take a look.

01:17:30.226 --> 01:17:32.906 A:middle
I'll command click on the
API to jump right to it.

01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:35.996 A:middle
And this kind of highlights
are really interesting scenario

01:17:36.066 --> 01:17:37.986 A:middle
where sometimes you'll
be working on your tests

01:17:38.586 --> 01:17:40.056 A:middle
and sometimes you'll
be working on your API.

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:42.696 A:middle
But often you want to
correlate between the two.

To make sure you're
making decisions correctly

01:17:45.176 --> 01:17:45.916 A:middle
on both sides.

great way to do this.

01:17:51.326 --> 01:17:52.556 A:middle
to give ourselves
a little more room.

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:56.506 A:middle
With -- my focus inside of
this method, I'm going to click

01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:59.286 A:middle
on the related files
pop-up here and we'll see

01:17:59.286 --> 01:18:00.636 A:middle
that there are two
new categories.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.446 A:middle
Test classes and test colors.

01:18:04.366 --> 01:18:06.936 A:middle
I'm going to hold on the Option
key and select the test colors,

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.706 A:middle
and have it opened up
in the assistant editor.

01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:10.476 A:middle
Now, what is this showing me?

01:18:11.036 --> 01:18:13.406 A:middle
It's showing me on the
left hand side my API.

01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:15.556 A:middle
And the right hand side,
it's showing the tests

01:18:15.756 --> 01:18:17.316 A:middle
that directly call that API.

01:18:17.976 --> 01:18:19.576 A:middle
Making it really easier
for me to correlate.

01:18:21.356 --> 01:18:23.016 A:middle
And actually, this is
really helpful in this case

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:25.646 A:middle
because I see that my test
is testing for health,

01:18:26.146 --> 01:18:27.966 A:middle
but I don't actually
use that value any

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:29.296 A:middle
over here in my actual method.

01:18:29.776 --> 01:18:31.706 A:middle
And it turns out
that's my fault.

01:18:31.966 --> 01:18:33.696 A:middle
What I forgot to do
was to call super,

01:18:33.696 --> 01:18:35.346 A:middle
when I implemented this method.

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:37.456 A:middle
So let's go ahead and fix that.

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:39.726 A:middle
And while I'm still
in the assistant here,

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.366 A:middle
I'll just run my other tests.

01:18:42.526 --> 01:18:43.786 A:middle
Sure enough, that was the fix.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.026 A:middle
We'll use the power of this
system here to just flip

01:18:46.026 --> 01:18:49.276 A:middle
to the next one and make sure
that that one is fixed too and,

01:18:49.276 --> 01:18:50.266 A:middle
yep that was my problem.

01:18:51.066 --> 01:18:54.046 A:middle
So just like that, I was able
to correlate my API and my tests

01:18:54.636 --> 01:18:56.796 A:middle
and work with them
together to fix my problem.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:59.356 A:middle
So that was just a
quick view of some

01:18:59.356 --> 01:19:01.526 A:middle
of the great new testing
features in Xcode 5.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:19:02.246 --> 01:19:02.946 A:middle
Let's go back to slides.

01:19:03.516 --> 01:19:12.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:17.186 A:middle
So the new unit testing features
of Xcode, the test navigator,

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:19.916 A:middle
the assistant editor, and the
new workflow integrations,

01:19:20.396 --> 01:19:23.626 A:middle
all great ways for you to
make testing a seamless part

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:24.876 A:middle
of your development workflow.

01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:30.566 A:middle
Now, another investment for
us in the area of testing was

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:31.966 A:middle
in the test framework itself.

01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:33.446 A:middle
And for this release,

01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:35.716 A:middle
we are announcing a
new framework XC test.

01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:39.016 A:middle
XC test is derived from OCUnit.

01:19:39.726 --> 01:19:42.036 A:middle
And for this release we've
made some minor enhancements.

01:19:42.816 --> 01:19:45.196 A:middle
Going forward, XC test
will be our vehicle

01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:47.586 A:middle
for providing great
testing features for you.

01:19:48.476 --> 01:19:50.686 A:middle
Now Xcode 5 continues
to include OC unit

01:19:51.116 --> 01:19:53.636 A:middle
and it includes a powerful
migration utility for you

01:19:53.636 --> 01:19:56.156 A:middle
to convert over whenever
you're ready.

01:19:57.356 --> 01:19:59.666 A:middle
Now, from all the
feedback you've provided,

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.486 A:middle
the number one request
you've had in the area

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:05.066 A:middle
of testing is better
ways to integrate it

01:20:05.206 --> 01:20:06.416 A:middle
into your automation systems.

01:20:07.146 --> 01:20:09.786 A:middle
And with Xcode 5, we have
a great new option for you

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:11.906 A:middle
in the form of command
line testing.

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:17.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:20.296 A:middle
I didn't know a terminal
window is so exciting.

01:20:22.036 --> 01:20:25.086 A:middle
The test command is now fully
supported from the command line.

01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:28.906 A:middle
And this command mirrors the
test action inside of the IDE.

01:20:29.456 --> 01:20:31.346 A:middle
So, your investment in
setting up your schemes

01:20:31.346 --> 01:20:34.746 A:middle
and your test plans now pay
off beautifully inside the IDE

01:20:35.326 --> 01:20:35.726 A:middle
and out.

01:20:36.946 --> 01:20:37.736 A:middle
The command allows you

01:20:37.736 --> 01:20:39.696 A:middle
to specify the destination
you'd like.

01:20:40.046 --> 01:20:42.456 A:middle
So, for example, you can
target one of the simulators.

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:46.136 A:middle
As you might expect, you can
also target a connected device.

01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:48.746 A:middle
And, as a little
gift to you guys,

01:20:48.746 --> 01:20:51.006 A:middle
you can also specify
multiple destinations

01:20:51.266 --> 01:20:52.416 A:middle
in a single invocation.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:57.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:20:57.656 --> 01:20:59.306 A:middle
So we think this is going
to be a great addition

01:20:59.436 --> 01:21:02.826 A:middle
for all of your workflows.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:21:02.826 --> 01:21:03.106 A:middle
Apple IDs.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:07.726 A:middle
Your Apple ID is your
identity, but it's also your key

01:21:07.726 --> 01:21:08.816 A:middle
to communicating with Apple.

01:21:09.456 --> 01:21:11.906 A:middle
And for this release we've
made Apple IDs simple

01:21:12.266 --> 01:21:14.326 A:middle
and more powerful to use.

01:21:14.896 --> 01:21:19.306 A:middle
Xcode 5 now includes a new
Accounts pane to manage all

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:21.126 A:middle
of the Accounts that
the ID will use.

01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:24.876 A:middle
Entering your Apple ID
gives you access to all

01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:27.376 A:middle
of the assets necessary
for App Store development.

01:21:28.246 --> 01:21:30.716 A:middle
And for those amongst you
who have multiple Apple IDs,

01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:33.176 A:middle
you can enter them all into
the panel here and select

01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:34.296 A:middle
which one you want to use

01:21:34.646 --> 01:21:37.956 A:middle
at anytime including
specifying them per project.

01:21:38.516 --> 01:21:45.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:21:45.646 --> 01:21:46.876 A:middle
And to take things
a step further,

01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:48.936 A:middle
we've built some great
functionality on top of this

01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:52.086 A:middle
in the form of Automatic
Project Configuration.

01:21:52.586 --> 01:21:55.316 A:middle
Wrong button there.

01:21:55.316 --> 01:21:59.336 A:middle
Automatic Project Configuration.

01:21:59.616 --> 01:22:02.126 A:middle
So, with each platform release,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:22:02.806 --> 01:22:05.486 A:middle
we give you guys amazing new
features and capabilities,

01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:08.716 A:middle
each with their own options and
also with some requirements.

01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:11.006 A:middle
And we wanted to make it
really easy for you guys

01:22:11.036 --> 01:22:12.466 A:middle
to get started with
these features.

01:22:12.976 --> 01:22:13.976 A:middle
So, we've built a section

01:22:13.976 --> 01:22:16.816 A:middle
of the Project Editor
dedicated directly to each

01:22:16.816 --> 01:22:19.716 A:middle
of these capabilities with
all the necessary requirements

01:22:19.716 --> 01:22:21.266 A:middle
and options in one place.

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:24.956 A:middle
And getting started with
the feature is really easy.

01:22:25.476 --> 01:22:27.856 A:middle
It's a simple matter
of flipping a switch.

01:22:28.746 --> 01:22:31.876 A:middle
Doing so, let's extra -- make
all of the necessary changes

01:22:32.076 --> 01:22:33.496 A:middle
to set up your machine
for development.

01:22:33.996 --> 01:22:36.956 A:middle
That includes changing project
settings, adding frameworks,

01:22:37.226 --> 01:22:40.256 A:middle
setting entitlements, and
making all of the requests

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:42.606 A:middle
and downloads necessary
for App IDs,

01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:44.926 A:middle
provisioning profiles,
and certificates.

01:22:45.516 --> 01:22:53.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:58.416 A:middle
From start to finish, you
can stay in Xcode and focus

01:22:58.416 --> 01:22:59.596 A:middle
on the work you want to do

01:22:59.866 --> 01:23:03.136 A:middle
and frankly let Xcode do
all of this work for you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:23:03.696 --> 01:23:08.246 A:middle
We wanted to provide also some
great source control features

01:23:08.246 --> 01:23:09.026 A:middle
for you to use.

01:23:09.326 --> 01:23:11.716 A:middle
And in order to do
that, we re-imagined

01:23:11.716 --> 01:23:14.606 A:middle
and redesigned our workflows
to integrate them directly

01:23:14.606 --> 01:23:16.256 A:middle
into the project life cycle.

01:23:17.846 --> 01:23:21.176 A:middle
In Xcode 5, you will find a new
top-level Source Control menu

01:23:21.456 --> 01:23:24.456 A:middle
with all of the options you
need and accessible at any time

01:23:24.756 --> 01:23:25.926 A:middle
in a really simple manner.

01:23:27.216 --> 01:23:29.276 A:middle
When you want to access the
project for the first time,

01:23:29.356 --> 01:23:31.946 A:middle
the new checkout workflow
makes that really easy.

01:23:32.486 --> 01:23:35.546 A:middle
Select the repository, select
the branch, and Xcode will check

01:23:35.546 --> 01:23:37.256 A:middle
out your project
and open it for you.

01:23:38.456 --> 01:23:39.876 A:middle
Now, once you have
the project open,

01:23:40.096 --> 01:23:42.516 A:middle
you'll notice the new working
copies area of the menu.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:45.676 A:middle
This provides a list of all the
working copies you have opened

01:23:45.676 --> 01:23:48.996 A:middle
in your project plus their
current branches, making it easy

01:23:48.996 --> 01:23:50.806 A:middle
for you to keep track of
what you're working on.

01:23:52.136 --> 01:23:54.546 A:middle
The Associated Branch
menu gives you all

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:56.396 A:middle
of the branch management
functions you need,

01:23:56.476 --> 01:23:59.296 A:middle
such as creating new
branches, switching branches,

01:23:59.586 --> 01:24:02.106 A:middle
and merging right from
inside the project workflow.

And when you want more detailed
information about what's changed

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:06.956 A:middle
in your working copy,

01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:09.736 A:middle
the Integrative History
View provides a browsable

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:12.626 A:middle
and searchable display
that works across all

01:24:12.626 --> 01:24:13.356 A:middle
of your working copies.

01:24:15.466 --> 01:24:17.316 A:middle
For this release,
we've really focused

01:24:17.316 --> 01:24:19.406 A:middle
on giving you guys great
Source Control tools.

01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:21.326 A:middle
We've added functionality
to the editor,

01:24:21.426 --> 01:24:24.826 A:middle
giving you the preferences
and integrated Subversion 1.7.

01:24:25.646 --> 01:24:27.866 A:middle
So, for all of you not
using Source Control today,

01:24:28.026 --> 01:24:33.666 A:middle
I highly recommend you guys
give this new features a try.

01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:34.976 A:middle
Continuous integration.

01:24:36.246 --> 01:24:38.016 A:middle
For those of you not
familiar with this term,

01:24:38.216 --> 01:24:41.466 A:middle
Continuous integration is the
practice of taking changes

01:24:41.466 --> 01:24:44.036 A:middle
from many developers and
merging them frequently.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:47.136 A:middle
Ensuring the code
builds, your tests pass,

01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:49.706 A:middle
and that generally your
project meets your requirements.

01:24:50.566 --> 01:24:54.326 A:middle
By integrating frequently,
you can minimize the effect

01:24:54.326 --> 01:24:58.466 A:middle
of any individual change, often
known as integration hell.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:01.466 --> 01:25:04.796 A:middle
Now integration systems need to
provide a myriad of features.

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:07.056 A:middle
And they need to fit well
in your development process.

01:25:08.376 --> 01:25:09.776 A:middle
One item that is often missing

01:25:09.776 --> 01:25:12.906 A:middle
from these systems is
tight IDE Integration,

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:16.056 A:middle
which you want are
continuous integration systems

01:25:16.056 --> 01:25:18.656 A:middle
that are an extension of
your development process.

01:25:19.266 --> 01:25:20.296 A:middle
In fact, you want them built

01:25:20.296 --> 01:25:22.216 A:middle
on the native concepts
of your tools.

01:25:23.646 --> 01:25:26.086 A:middle
And for Xcode 5, that's
exactly what we've done

01:25:26.316 --> 01:25:28.136 A:middle
in the form of bots.

01:25:29.516 --> 01:25:33.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:25:34.266 --> 01:25:36.736 A:middle
Cool icon, even cooler
technology.

01:25:38.816 --> 01:25:41.196 A:middle
Bots are continuous
integration systems that --

01:25:41.696 --> 01:25:44.736 A:middle
well, bots are tasks and
they run on OS X server.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:48.746 A:middle
And their primary reason for
being is to do your bidding.

01:25:49.696 --> 01:25:52.076 A:middle
So bots use the Xcode
5 technologies

01:25:52.226 --> 01:25:54.706 A:middle
to perform integrations,
which are sorts of tasks

01:25:55.536 --> 01:25:57.686 A:middle
like build, test, and analyze.

01:25:58.526 --> 01:26:00.666 A:middle
And to get to what the final
-- the slide finally says here,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:26:00.666 --> 01:26:02.976 A:middle
I'm going to show you a
demo of how bots work.

01:26:08.756 --> 01:26:12.546 A:middle
So here I have the iOS
version of a project.

01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:16.446 A:middle
Now, behind the scenes here,
my team has set up a Mac mini

01:26:16.876 --> 01:26:18.636 A:middle
and installed the
latest OS X server.

01:26:19.316 --> 01:26:22.246 A:middle
And we've created bots for all
of the projects that we're going

01:26:22.246 --> 01:26:23.956 A:middle
to use throughout WWDC.

01:26:25.186 --> 01:26:26.646 A:middle
For me to take advantage
of the bot,

01:26:26.816 --> 01:26:30.066 A:middle
all I need to do is add the
account to this Xcode instance.

01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:32.626 A:middle
So I'll bring up
my preferences here

01:26:32.986 --> 01:26:34.336 A:middle
and we see the new
Accounts pane.

01:26:35.786 --> 01:26:37.746 A:middle
I'll click the plus
sign and say Add Server.

01:26:37.746 --> 01:26:42.556 A:middle
Now we see that on my Mac mini
is broadcasting over Bonjour.

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:47.296 A:middle
I can select that and I'll enter
my extremely secure credentials.

01:26:48.506 --> 01:26:52.426 A:middle
Now, when I click Add,
I want you to watch

01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:54.706 A:middle
in the left hand side in
the project navigator.

01:26:55.286 --> 01:26:57.496 A:middle
You see when I click
Add, a new item appears.

01:26:58.066 --> 01:26:59.386 A:middle
That's my bot.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:00.956 --> 01:27:02.946 A:middle
What we're seeing here
is the log navigator

01:27:03.006 --> 01:27:05.296 A:middle
which normally presents
all of your local actions.

01:27:06.056 --> 01:27:08.326 A:middle
We wanted to integrate the
bot into the log navigator

01:27:08.326 --> 01:27:10.506 A:middle
so you could correlate what
the bot is doing for you

01:27:10.776 --> 01:27:12.146 A:middle
with all the work
you see locally.

01:27:13.746 --> 01:27:16.466 A:middle
Selecting the bot is going to
show me the integration summary.

01:27:17.056 --> 01:27:17.676 A:middle
And here it is.

01:27:18.216 --> 01:27:19.976 A:middle
And there's a lot of
information going on here.

01:27:20.516 --> 01:27:24.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:27:24.716 --> 01:27:27.076 A:middle
Across the top, you're seeing
the integration results.

01:27:27.516 --> 01:27:29.806 A:middle
These are the kind of
statistics of the last run --

01:27:30.276 --> 01:27:32.546 A:middle
errors, warnings,
analyses, and tests.

01:27:33.596 --> 01:27:34.756 A:middle
We see I have zero errors,

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:36.626 A:middle
so my product is
building successfully,

01:27:36.976 --> 01:27:39.256 A:middle
but I still have some issues I
should probably be resolving.

01:27:40.616 --> 01:27:42.326 A:middle
Across the middle of our charts

01:27:42.376 --> 01:27:45.646 A:middle
that display the relative
recent history of my bot,

01:27:45.986 --> 01:27:47.496 A:middle
for things like builds
and tests.

01:27:48.776 --> 01:27:51.856 A:middle
We can see that I've had some
warnings happen for a while.

01:27:52.756 --> 01:27:54.256 A:middle
We can see this integration
here right in the middle

01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:56.356 A:middle
with the red bar, that's
one that actually failed.

01:27:57.076 --> 01:27:58.646 A:middle
On tests I'm not
doing too badly.

01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:00.986 A:middle
The green are all the
tests that passed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:28:00.986 --> 01:28:03.106 A:middle
But it looks like we had some
failures introduced recently.

01:28:03.586 --> 01:28:06.006 A:middle
I should probably look at that.

01:28:06.226 --> 01:28:08.286 A:middle
Across the bottom are
the integration details.

01:28:08.446 --> 01:28:11.726 A:middle
These are the specifics of what
happens during this integration.

01:28:12.656 --> 01:28:14.946 A:middle
They might look kind of
familiar, it's very similar

01:28:14.946 --> 01:28:16.816 A:middle
to the style we present
them in the bill blogs.

01:28:17.316 --> 01:28:18.976 A:middle
And in fact they
work very similarly.

01:28:20.196 --> 01:28:22.116 A:middle
I'll double-click on our
olm here and it's going

01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:24.796 A:middle
to take me right to that
place in my source code.

01:28:25.456 --> 01:28:27.036 A:middle
Now I want to point
out what this is doing.

01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:29.396 A:middle
It's taking information
the bot gave me

01:28:29.556 --> 01:28:31.586 A:middle
and presenting it right
inside of my project.

01:28:31.976 --> 01:28:34.316 A:middle
So now I can change the
source code, integrate it,

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.576 A:middle
and push those changes out.

01:28:36.276 --> 01:28:37.486 A:middle
So it's a really
great integration

01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:40.426 A:middle
between the two systems.

01:28:40.426 --> 01:28:42.556 A:middle
We'll go back to the
summary here and look

01:28:42.556 --> 01:28:43.716 A:middle
at some more information.

01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:46.936 A:middle
One of the really
valuable things

01:28:46.936 --> 01:28:49.176 A:middle
about the bot is doing
for me is testing.

01:28:49.886 --> 01:28:51.796 A:middle
And if I select the
Test tab across the top,

01:28:52.096 --> 01:28:54.906 A:middle
we'll see the test history
for all the integrations

01:28:54.906 --> 01:28:55.776 A:middle
that have happened recently.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:29:00.106 A:middle
Across the top is a timeline
that shows me my test history.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:03.026 A:middle
You can see my tests have
been building up over time,

01:29:03.426 --> 01:29:06.936 A:middle
but recently, it looks like we
had some tests not get performed

01:29:06.936 --> 01:29:08.386 A:middle
but it looks like
we're back on track.

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:11.996 A:middle
I could actually grab this
loop and move it anywhere back

01:29:11.996 --> 01:29:15.316 A:middle
in time and look at the test
history to get more information

01:29:15.386 --> 01:29:16.256 A:middle
on a particular issue.

01:29:16.796 --> 01:29:21.146 A:middle
The bottom section is
showing me a combination

01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:22.306 A:middle
of pieces of information.

01:29:22.916 --> 01:29:25.456 A:middle
The rows are all of the
tests in my project.

01:29:26.046 --> 01:29:27.566 A:middle
The columns are the integrations

01:29:27.856 --> 01:29:29.496 A:middle
or the actions the
bot are performing.

01:29:30.376 --> 01:29:32.036 A:middle
So we can see here,
this is when some

01:29:32.036 --> 01:29:34.296 A:middle
of the tests were created
the first time they were run.

01:29:35.056 --> 01:29:36.546 A:middle
We can also see where
tests failed.

01:29:37.296 --> 01:29:39.876 A:middle
This column right here, this
is the integration that failed

01:29:40.026 --> 01:29:41.226 A:middle
and none of my tests ran.

01:29:42.046 --> 01:29:44.256 A:middle
So it gives me a great way to
kind of see how the evolution

01:29:44.256 --> 01:29:45.376 A:middle
of my project has gone.

01:29:46.856 --> 01:29:47.466 A:middle
Let's say we wanted

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:49.576 A:middle
to investigate this
particular test issue,

01:29:50.436 --> 01:29:51.336 A:middle
well I have a couple options.

01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:54.256 A:middle
One would be to double-click
on it and navigate

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:56.486 A:middle
to the source code like
I did before and try

01:29:56.486 --> 01:29:57.546 A:middle
to fix the problem myself.

01:29:59.116 --> 01:30:02.286 A:middle
Another option though would
be to look at the integration

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:02.316 --> 01:30:05.006 A:middle
and see who made the changes
and get them to fix it.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:08.456 A:middle
Well, I'll do that
one right now.

01:30:09.496 --> 01:30:11.946 A:middle
So to do that, I'm going to
double-click on the Integration,

01:30:12.596 --> 01:30:14.046 A:middle
and jump to the Integration
Details.

01:30:14.736 --> 01:30:16.256 A:middle
This is similar to what
I was saying before,

01:30:16.396 --> 01:30:17.556 A:middle
it's showing me the results

01:30:17.736 --> 01:30:19.816 A:middle
and it's showing me the
specific details below.

01:30:19.816 --> 01:30:22.256 A:middle
But there are some other
tabs across the top

01:30:22.256 --> 01:30:23.976 A:middle
that will provide
additional information.

01:30:25.196 --> 01:30:26.636 A:middle
I'll select the Tests tab

01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:29.156 A:middle
and we'll now see here are
the results from my tests.

01:30:30.906 --> 01:30:33.266 A:middle
Important thing to note here is
it's also showing me the devices

01:30:33.266 --> 01:30:35.976 A:middle
it was running on, this bot
is running all of my tests

01:30:36.266 --> 01:30:39.756 A:middle
on three separate devices,
an iPad and two iPods.

01:30:40.886 --> 01:30:43.556 A:middle
Now, my test is failing
uniformly across all of them

01:30:43.646 --> 01:30:44.946 A:middle
so it's probably
a logic failure,

01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:47.786 A:middle
but this would be a really great
way for me to be able to test

01:30:48.256 --> 01:30:51.776 A:middle
if different devices
cause problems for my app

01:30:51.776 --> 01:30:56.756 A:middle
or even devices running
different OS's how my tests do.

01:30:56.966 --> 01:30:59.856 A:middle
I'll select the Commits tab
across the top and look to see

01:30:59.856 --> 01:31:02.126 A:middle
who made the change
and up it was Max

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:02.126 --> 01:31:05.036 A:middle
who made this change,
so we can blame him.

01:31:06.196 --> 01:31:08.246 A:middle
Actually this is probably
difficult for you guys

01:31:08.246 --> 01:31:11.046 A:middle
in the back to read, but if I
read the commit message it says,

01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:13.896 A:middle
"Re-enable tests that should
have never been disabled."

01:31:14.056 --> 01:31:18.166 A:middle
If I wanted to figure out more
about what Max means by that,

01:31:18.166 --> 01:31:21.006 A:middle
I can just click on the Show
Modified Files, and it's going

01:31:21.006 --> 01:31:24.646 A:middle
to show me that very familiar
comparison view of the changes

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.616 A:middle
for this integration and sure
enough looks like Max took

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:29.096 A:middle
out some comments
for some tests.

01:31:29.836 --> 01:31:30.856 A:middle
We should probably
go and fix that.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:34.426 A:middle
But right here you can see the
bot is doing a bunch of work

01:31:34.426 --> 01:31:37.446 A:middle
for me, building, analyze,
testing and I can get

01:31:37.446 --> 01:31:39.236 A:middle
that information
right here inside

01:31:39.236 --> 01:31:41.286 A:middle
of the IDE quickly and easily.

01:31:41.866 --> 01:31:44.946 A:middle
So, this is just a little
bit of the power of bots.

01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:48.196 A:middle
What I'd like to show you next
is how easy it is to create one.

01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:51.516 A:middle
We already have one from
my iOS project here.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:54.556 A:middle
So, let's bring up the
OS X project I had before

01:31:54.816 --> 01:31:56.026 A:middle
and create a bot for this.

01:31:57.406 --> 01:31:59.786 A:middle
Creating a bot is as simple as
going under the Product menu

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:00.036 --> 01:32:02.286 A:middle
and selecting Create bot.

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:06.296 A:middle
The first question it's going
to ask is what I want to build.

01:32:06.296 --> 01:32:08.216 A:middle
And this is going to
be a very familiar list

01:32:08.216 --> 01:32:10.316 A:middle
of all the schemes
in my project.

01:32:11.476 --> 01:32:12.276 A:middle
I'll select this one,

01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:13.726 A:middle
the project I want
or the item I want.

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:16.516 A:middle
My servers are already
selected, and I'm going

01:32:16.516 --> 01:32:19.136 A:middle
to leave this box checked to
say integrate immediately,

01:32:19.466 --> 01:32:21.146 A:middle
we wanted to kick off and
start doing this work.

01:32:22.736 --> 01:32:23.606 A:middle
I'll select Next.

01:32:23.966 --> 01:32:25.606 A:middle
And I now have some
options for when

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:27.196 A:middle
and what the bot does for me.

01:32:27.966 --> 01:32:30.886 A:middle
I can set the schedule to go on
periodically at a certain time,

01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:34.006 A:middle
manually at my request
or uncommit.

01:32:34.886 --> 01:32:37.036 A:middle
I'm going to select uncommit
because I want the bot

01:32:37.036 --> 01:32:39.136 A:middle
to do this work every time
someone makes a change.

01:32:40.736 --> 01:32:44.076 A:middle
I'll leave the default actions
checked, I wanted to analyze,

01:32:44.146 --> 01:32:48.406 A:middle
test and create an archive
of my project when it's done.

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:49.406 A:middle
I'll select Next.

01:32:50.276 --> 01:32:52.936 A:middle
And the bot now provides
me access to send

01:32:52.936 --> 01:32:54.316 A:middle
out email notifications

01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:56.686 A:middle
when integration is
successful or when it fails.

01:32:56.686 --> 01:32:59.416 A:middle
I definitely want people to
know when they break something,

01:32:59.536 --> 01:33:00.866 A:middle
so I leave this check
box enabled

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:33:01.996 --> 01:33:04.426 A:middle
and we'll click Create Bot.

01:33:04.636 --> 01:33:08.106 A:middle
That's it, Xcode and the
server have not communicated

01:33:08.106 --> 01:33:09.786 A:middle
to create a bot for
this project.

01:33:10.276 --> 01:33:12.096 A:middle
And here it is it shows
out in my navigator.

01:33:13.086 --> 01:33:15.316 A:middle
So, just like that I
was able to make use

01:33:15.316 --> 01:33:16.726 A:middle
of the continuous
integration system

01:33:16.986 --> 01:33:18.206 A:middle
to start tracking my project.

01:33:19.306 --> 01:33:21.846 A:middle
Now, it's going to take a second
here to perform the integration.

01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:23.796 A:middle
So, in the meantime what I want

01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:28.366 A:middle
to do is show you some other
features we have in the system.

01:33:28.516 --> 01:33:31.236 A:middle
In order to keep track of all of
the projects you might be using,

01:33:31.496 --> 01:33:32.836 A:middle
we have an integrated web view.

01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:35.836 A:middle
You can see here a list of
all the projects that I have,

01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:39.246 A:middle
their current status and the
ability to interact with them.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:42.286 A:middle
In fact I can go ahead and
click on anyone of these

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:43.746 A:middle
to create an integration

01:33:44.026 --> 01:33:46.396 A:middle
or download the product
of any of these bots.

01:33:47.146 --> 01:33:49.276 A:middle
So, this is a great way
for engineering, QA,

01:33:49.276 --> 01:33:52.286 A:middle
and other groups to leverage
the value and the power

01:33:52.286 --> 01:33:53.716 A:middle
of the continuous
integration system.

01:33:55.036 --> 01:33:57.626 A:middle
But to keep everybody kind
of on a level playing field

01:33:57.626 --> 01:33:59.536 A:middle
with how things are
working, we also want

01:33:59.536 --> 01:34:02.986 A:middle
to provide a really interactive
and fun display and we've done

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:34:13.186 --> 01:34:15.516 A:middle
The Scoreboard presents
a view of all of the bots

01:34:15.586 --> 01:34:16.656 A:middle
that are running on my server.

01:34:16.656 --> 01:34:19.256 A:middle
On the left hand side
you can see the projects

01:34:19.256 --> 01:34:20.286 A:middle
and their current status;

01:34:20.846 --> 01:34:22.736 A:middle
on the right hand side
you can see the details.

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:25.856 A:middle
Integration results the
commit logs and devices

01:34:25.856 --> 01:34:26.606 A:middle
that it was running on.

01:34:27.616 --> 01:34:28.606 A:middle
And you'll see that it cycles

01:34:28.606 --> 01:34:32.196 A:middle
through each one giving me the
details, it happens to hang

01:34:32.196 --> 01:34:34.606 A:middle
out a little bit longer on
failed ones which is not good

01:34:34.606 --> 01:34:36.716 A:middle
for me right now, but you'll see

01:34:36.716 --> 01:34:38.696 A:middle
when it actually switches
it will give you the details

01:34:38.696 --> 01:34:40.796 A:middle
about each including
who made the changes.

01:34:41.686 --> 01:34:44.896 A:middle
So, this is a great way whether
it's running on TVs or monitors

01:34:44.896 --> 01:34:47.356 A:middle
around your office, or just
running on your desktop

01:34:47.356 --> 01:34:48.616 A:middle
for you guys to keep track

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.776 A:middle
of how the continuous
integration system is working,

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:54.306 A:middle
the status of your projects,
and frankly who the heroes

01:34:54.306 --> 01:34:55.976 A:middle
and the villains are
in your own office.

01:34:57.836 --> 01:35:00.136 A:middle
And that's Continuous

So, bots and Continuous
Integration.

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:16.426 A:middle
At the heart of this
solution is OS X server.

01:35:17.486 --> 01:35:21.426 A:middle
OS X server continuous deliver
powerful services such as mail,

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:25.306 A:middle
calendaring, and wiki, and the
Xcode service now joins them

01:35:25.336 --> 01:35:27.186 A:middle
to deliver continuous
integration.

01:35:28.206 --> 01:35:31.236 A:middle
And running OS X server
is easier than ever.

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:35.286 A:middle
The set of experience has
been redesigned and simplified

01:35:35.626 --> 01:35:38.226 A:middle
and in literally just a few
minutes you can have the server

01:35:38.226 --> 01:35:39.636 A:middle
up and running on your network.

01:35:41.256 --> 01:35:44.206 A:middle
Now the Xcode service leverages
many of the functionalities

01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:47.456 A:middle
and features of Xcode 5
including the Apple ID

01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:50.996 A:middle
integration, unit testing,
and source control features.

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:54.366 A:middle
And layers on top elements
like Bonjour discovery,

01:35:54.556 --> 01:35:57.976 A:middle
repository hosting, and the
new web client, and Scoreboard.

and I'm pretty sure you
guys are going to love them.

01:36:19.426 --> 01:36:22.536 A:middle
With Xcode 5 you should be able
to build applications better,

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:26.486 A:middle
faster, and easier than ever,
and we're really excited

01:36:26.486 --> 01:36:27.206 A:middle
