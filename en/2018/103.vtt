It is great to be back here with

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.556 A:middle
the Design Awards on the main

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:47.146 A:middle

great evening for you.

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:52.646 A:middle
So, thank you for coming out and

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:55.036 A:middle
joining us in this afternoon and

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.896 A:middle
celebration of the winners that

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:57.766 A:middle
we're going to announce, soon.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:00.266 A:middle
We're here to honor developers

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:00.266 A:middle
We're here to honor developers

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.706 A:middle
who have done excellent work and

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
with technology adoption, with

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.066 A:middle
innovation, making their apps

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:07.496 A:middle
unique.

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.116 A:middle
And in my role at Apple and in

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:12.426 A:middle
my team's role at Apple we've

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
worked with so many of you over

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:15.866 A:middle
the years, helping you to create

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.716 A:middle
great apps.

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:20.826 A:middle
Apps that are engaging and apps

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.866 A:middle
that are compelling.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.056 A:middle
Apps that are high performance

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:26.266 A:middle
and apps that are, honestly,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.116 A:middle
really great.

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:29.266 A:middle
And so, it's an honor for me to

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.756 A:middle
be here and to be able to lead

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.126 A:middle
this award ceremony and honor

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.706 A:middle
these developers, tonight.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.726 A:middle
The work that is done by you, as

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
the developer committee, speaks

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:42.026 A:middle
to the heart of Apple.

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.756 A:middle
And that heart is, as we all

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:46.376 A:middle
know, creativity.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:49.746 A:middle
In all of its forms, we believe

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:52.836 A:middle
that creativity has always been

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.266 A:middle
humanity's greatest super power.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.476 A:middle
And when it combines with

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:59.886 A:middle
technology great things come to

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:00.326 A:middle
life.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:00.326 A:middle
life.

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.016 A:middle
Incredible things come to life.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
And that's why we feel deeply

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.506 A:middle
that you, as developers, are

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:07.776 A:middle
amazingly creative.

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.586 A:middle
Like a paintbrush to an artist,

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.006 A:middle
chords to a composer, words to

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:17.926 A:middle
an author, code is an even more

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.216 A:middle
advanced creative tool.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.866 A:middle
Because it can really do and

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.136 A:middle
create so much.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.926 A:middle
As developers, you're developing

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.736 A:middle
on the canvas of the entire

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.816 A:middle
world causing great new

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.086 A:middle
groundbreaking apps and ideas to

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.026 A:middle
take shape.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.006 A:middle
And each year new and

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.366 A:middle
transformative apps are

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.326 A:middle
introduced bases on those ideas.

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.426 A:middle
And each time this happens you

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.116 A:middle
take creativity to new levels.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
For example, take a look at the

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.326 A:middle
last three years of Apple Design

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:54.706 A:middle

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:11.636 A:middle

Music creation and DJing tools.

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:18.166 A:middle
And apps to better understand

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:18.916 A:middle
human anatomy.

00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:22.366 A:middle
As well as everyday tools that

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.636 A:middle
help you to get things done and

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:26.666 A:middle
make a, truly make a difference

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.256 A:middle
in this world.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.936 A:middle
The developers of these apps and

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:32.706 A:middle
so many more over the years have

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.406 A:middle
amazed us with their excellent

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:35.126 A:middle
work.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.536 A:middle
Now, we all understand the

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.546 A:middle
incredible hard work that goes

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.296 A:middle
into the design and development

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.836 A:middle
of great apps like these and

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:44.226 A:middle
others.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.766 A:middle
We're all too familiar with the

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.056 A:middle
long nights, long hours,

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.496 A:middle
technical hurdles, design

00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:55.356 A:middle
challenges, and honestly, often,

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:56.606 A:middle
a really hard to find bugs.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.916 A:middle
But that's why we're here

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
tonight.

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
tonight.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:04.506 A:middle
To honor and celebrate that hard

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
work.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:07.676 A:middle
Today's winners set a new

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.976 A:middle
benchmark in creativity and they

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:11.356 A:middle
demonstrate the mark of

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.416 A:middle
brilliance that makes something

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:14.036 A:middle
truly great.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:18.315 A:middle
Okay. We've got something to do

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.466 A:middle
here, tonight, which is to give

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:20.646 A:middle
out a bunch of awards.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.406 A:middle
And we're going to do that in a

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:23.536 A:middle
very large room.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.686 A:middle
So, if you hear your name

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.766 A:middle
called, if you hear your app's

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.946 A:middle
name called, you need to make it

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:30.746 A:middle
up here fast.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:32.746 A:middle
Because we want to move this

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.746 A:middle
along and it's a big room.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.676 A:middle
There are two sets of stairs

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:37.806 A:middle
here on either side of me.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.086 A:middle
So, just head towards me, you'll

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.186 A:middle
find a set of stairs, you'll

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
make it onto the stage, and

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.886 A:middle
we'll move on from there.

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.496 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:50.206 A:middle
Identifying the audience for

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.916 A:middle
your app and developing

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.426 A:middle
something that's perfectly

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.566 A:middle
suited for them and their needs

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.116 A:middle
is really important.

perfectly tuned for children and

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:07.936 A:middle
the way that they learn.

[ Music ]

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:37.106 A:middle
All right.

00:05:38.386 --> 00:05:39.856 A:middle
So, Bandimal is a fun and

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:41.936 A:middle
intuitive music composer app.

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.876 A:middle
It lets kids explore music and

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.546 A:middle
be the maestro of their own

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:47.936 A:middle
animal band.

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.896 A:middle
And the key to this app is its

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:52.366 A:middle
focus on creativity.

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:55.876 A:middle
There are no rules, no notes, no

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.796 A:middle
chords, no scores.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:05:59.866 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:02.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:03.656 A:middle
Let's dive right in.

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.366 A:middle
I'll tap on the plus here to

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.456 A:middle
start a new composition.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.656 A:middle
And the music gets started right

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:09.216 A:middle
away,

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:11.660 A:middle
which we should hear, soon.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:13.666 A:middle
There we go.

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.616 A:middle
But we're going to need to add

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:16.286 A:middle
some notes.

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:19.086 A:middle
The app has this adorable cast

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.816 A:middle
of animal characters.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:21.986 A:middle
Each one makes a different

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:22.466 A:middle
sound.

00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:24.246 A:middle
I'm going to swipe through them

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:25.196 A:middle
till I find one that I like,

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:26.306 A:middle
which I guess, I'm going to go

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:27.286 A:middle
with this buffalo, here.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.056 A:middle
I'll tap down here with my

00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:31.586 A:middle
finger to add some notes.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.546 A:middle
And you can see each note comes

00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:36.126 A:middle
with its own special dance move.

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
Now, I'm going to speed up the

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:38.716 A:middle
tempo by turning this dial.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:41.896 A:middle
And, maybe, after I do that I

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:43.596 A:middle
decide I want to give my buffalo

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:47.566 A:middle
a nice rest every other beat.

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:49.106 A:middle
There we go.

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:52.596 A:middle
Now, I need a nice lead singer

00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:54.056 A:middle
to complement my buffalo bass,

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:55.756 A:middle
so I'm going to tap here, swipe

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.000 A:middle
through my options.

00:06:59.416 --> 00:06:59.976 A:middle
There we go.

00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
This chicken looks like she'll

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
be a star.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.330 A:middle
Tap down here.

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:08.466 A:middle
And I'm going to speed up her

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:09.716 A:middle
tempo to match my buffalo bass.

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:13.176 A:middle
And, maybe, I'll do a call and

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:16.106 A:middle
response type thing so they can

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:17.676 A:middle
interact with each other.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.196 A:middle
Now, I need one more animal to

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:19.646 A:middle
spice things up.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:20.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to tap here.

00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:22.656 A:middle
I happen to know there's a

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.666 A:middle
particularly funky jellyfish

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:24.806 A:middle
here.

00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:28.826 A:middle
So, let's give this one a go.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.806 A:middle
Now, let's listen.

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:39.516 A:middle
So, as kids create these

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:40.686 A:middle
compositions they're building

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:41.746 A:middle
their sense of rhythm and

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.606 A:middle
musicality, very playfully and

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.086 A:middle
naturally, without need for any

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.096 A:middle
prior musical knowledge.

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:48.766 A:middle
And the beauty of the app is any

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.026 A:middle
combination of notes is going to

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:51.096 A:middle
sound good, because it's all

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.876 A:middle
playing in pentatonic scale.

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:54.416 A:middle
So, there's always a feeling of

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.096 A:middle
success.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.796 A:middle

natural sounds.

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.266 A:middle
I can even add a sound effect by

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
tapping on these mountains.

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.806 A:middle
get creative with music and feel

their ear and their intuition

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.456 A:middle

The Yatatoy team of three spent

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.126 A:middle
two years developing this app

00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:17.216 A:middle
By combining notes, calendars,

We start out with On the Agenda.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:41.996 A:middle
This is a task manager like

00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:44.206 A:middle
I can quickly see my highest

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:45.846 A:middle
priority items and what I need

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:47.596 A:middle
to do with all my prior notes

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:47.966 A:middle
attached.

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.326 A:middle
I can mark things off as I

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:49.836 A:middle
complete them.

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:50.746 A:middle

What makes this app really great

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:04.656 A:middle
is its integration with

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:05.176 A:middle

00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
So, on the right-hand side here,

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:08.526 A:middle
you can see all my Calendar

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:08.776 A:middle

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:11.106 A:middle
There's a HealthKit lab tomorrow

00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:13.466 A:middle
down a couple of questions.

00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
So, we'll do that together.

00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:16.816 A:middle
So, I bring in this note.

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:18.686 A:middle
You can see it brings in all the

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:19.776 A:middle
details from Calendar.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.766 A:middle
So, the event details, the

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:23.826 A:middle
location, the attendees.

00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:25.186 A:middle
So, I can focus on creating the

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:25.326 A:middle
note.

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:28.326 A:middle
So, as I create this note, you

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.946 A:middle
can see the app supports

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:30.546 A:middle
markdown.

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:33.636 A:middle
It also supports tagging, which

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:34.066 A:middle
is really nice.

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:34.806 A:middle
So, I'm going to tag this as a

00:11:34.806 --> 00:11:35.736 A:middle
HealthKit related note.

00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:37.646 A:middle
As I'm making this note, I

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:39.616 A:middle
realize a colleague and I had a

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.686 A:middle

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:41.566 A:middle

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:42.596 A:middle
HealthKit related questions.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.806 A:middle
So, I'm going to swing over to

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.286 A:middle

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:50.046 A:middle

00:11:50.246 --> 00:11:53.006 A:middle
Agenda provides this link in the

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.056 A:middle
this it clicks me right back

00:11:56.096 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
into this meeting with John.

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.666 A:middle
And here are the questions that

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.586 A:middle
I wanted.

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.586 A:middle
I wanted.

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:03.296 A:middle
So, you can imagine after using

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.656 A:middle
this for a couple weeks, you end

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:06.546 A:middle
up with this really great

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.226 A:middle

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.926 A:middle
And it keeps you super

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:10.366 A:middle
organized.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:15.036 A:middle
Lastly, because I know I'm going

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:16.816 A:middle
to be doing a lot of HealthKit

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.506 A:middle

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.146 A:middle
And I can save this as an

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
overview.

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:24.876 A:middle
And what this does, it creates

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:25.976 A:middle
this nice little pocket here,

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:26.896 A:middle

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:29.226 A:middle

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:18.976 A:middle
to show it to us, now.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:25.956 A:middle

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.446 A:middle
Alto's Odyssey is an endless

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:31.326 A:middle
sandboarding game, where you

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:33.656 A:middle
ride through sunswept dunes,

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:36.046 A:middle
perform midair stunts, all while

00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:37.966 A:middle
completing fun challenges and

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:39.246 A:middle
unlocking new characters.

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:40.966 A:middle
So, my colleague Adrienne will

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:41.946 A:middle
be joining us for the demo,

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:42.316 A:middle
today.

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:43.416 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:46.806 A:middle
The first thing that we loved

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:48.646 A:middle
about Alto's Odyssey was that it

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:49.756 A:middle
provides the user with

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.436 A:middle
contextual clues and elegantly

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:54.516 A:middle
pauses the game, so the player

00:14:54.616 --> 00:14:56.436 A:middle
learns by playing.

00:14:56.436 --> 00:14:57.576 A:middle
So, here she's getting taught

00:14:57.686 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
how to perform a wall ride,

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.016 A:middle
which is a new feature in the

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.016 A:middle
which is a new feature in the

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
game.

00:15:01.336 --> 00:15:02.716 A:middle
There are no carousels that

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:03.966 A:middle
she's swiping through.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.996 A:middle
It's just her and the game.

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.536 A:middle
We, also, love that it maintains

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:10.406 A:middle
that same simple control scheme

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:12.316 A:middle
for Alto's Adventure but ramps

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.666 A:middle
up the difficulty with new

00:15:13.756 --> 00:15:14.216 A:middle
challenges.

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:16.816 A:middle
Control-wise, all Adrienne is

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.776 A:middle
doing is tapping to jump, and

00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.046 A:middle
then tapping and holding to

00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:22.116 A:middle
perform some epic flips.

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.416 A:middle
Now, Alto's Odyssey is a real

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:26.956 A:middle
feast for the senses.

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
Visually, there's so much to

00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:30.476 A:middle
look at in this game.

00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:32.116 A:middle
There is elements in the

00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:33.256 A:middle
foreground, in the background

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.676 A:middle
like hot air balloons, sand

00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:36.546 A:middle
coming off the back of the

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:36.976 A:middle
board.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.706 A:middle
But each level has such a

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
striking color palette to it

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:42.866 A:middle
that we fell in love with.

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:45.236 A:middle
That same attention to detail,

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.086 A:middle
also, carries over into the

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:47.896 A:middle
audio, as well.

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:49.426 A:middle
So, actually, let's take a

00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:50.326 A:middle
listen to that, right now.

00:15:51.516 --> 00:15:58.500 A:middle

Ah. Again, we love this.

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
And you can, actually, listen to

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:04.506 A:middle
it, too, because it's available

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.286 A:middle
on iTunes and Apple Music.

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:09.316 A:middle
We, also, fell in love with how

00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:11.166 A:middle
it uses the haptic engine on our

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.356 A:middle
devices.

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.076 A:middle
So, Adrienne is getting a slight

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:16.036 A:middle
vibration on the iPhone when

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:17.696 A:middle
she's, when she's landing a

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:20.316 A:middle
jump, performing a wall ride, or

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:21.826 A:middle
even, bouncing off of hot air

00:16:21.826 --> 00:16:23.356 A:middle
balloons in the game.

00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:25.696 A:middle
It, also, maintains a super

00:16:25.796 --> 00:16:28.306 A:middle
smooth 60 frames per second on

00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:30.586 A:middle
every device, including previous

00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:31.526 A:middle
generation devices.

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:33.696 A:middle
In large part, thanks to Metal 2

00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:34.426 A:middle
and Unity.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.696 A:middle
And it even maintains that same

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:39.296 A:middle
simple control scheme across

00:16:39.946 --> 00:16:42.266 A:middle
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

00:16:43.926 --> 00:16:46.796 A:middle
So, Alto's Odyssey is localized

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:50.136 A:middle
into an incredible 20 languages,

Now, talking about localization,

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.076 A:middle
localizing your app so that it's

00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.356 A:middle

choice is really important.

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:23.935 A:middle
And it's something that we talk

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.016 A:middle
about a lot, here at Apple.

00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:26.685 A:middle
And we encourage you to do.

00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:28.886 A:middle
But making an app that helps

whose language they don't speak

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:33.986 A:middle
is a big deal.

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:36.626 A:middle

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:24.076 A:middle
What sets this app apart is its

All you need to do is swipe up

and then, pick two out of the 38

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:56.686 A:middle

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:17.196 A:middle
Now, as you can see, the whole

00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:18.406 A:middle
screen of the app turns into a

00:19:18.406 --> 00:19:19.296 A:middle
tappable area.

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:21.986 A:middle
But the developer went one step

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:24.586 A:middle
further by implementing 3D touch

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:25.836 A:middle
and haptic feedback.

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:27.656 A:middle

to follow it.

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:39.656 A:middle

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.396 A:middle

more.

So, how does it turn out with

00:29:09.136 --> 00:29:10.446 A:middle
this other character?

00:29:10.446 --> 00:29:11.716 A:middle
Well, you're just going to have

00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:13.526 A:middle
to play the game to find out.

00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:16.846 A:middle
There's a reason why people have

00:29:16.846 --> 00:29:17.716 A:middle
a first love story.

00:29:18.336 --> 00:29:19.716 A:middle
Because, it's powerful,

00:29:20.056 --> 00:29:21.876 A:middle
emotional, and it has an impact.

00:29:22.056 --> 00:29:23.836 A:middle
And if you haven't experienced

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.906 A:middle
it yet, well, this game is a

00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:27.786 A:middle
wonderful preview to the real,

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:30.456 A:middle
honest, heart racing, and heart

00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:34.386 A:middle
first love.

00:29:34.486 --> 00:29:36.456 A:middle
So, go for it.

So, this is Raja.

00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:33.876 A:middle
Calzy was created in an effort

00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:35.376 A:middle
to rethink the conventional

00:30:35.376 --> 00:30:36.046 A:middle
calculator.

00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:38.906 A:middle
It's an incredibly customizable

00:30:39.146 --> 00:30:41.296 A:middle
really well-designed app.

00:30:41.536 --> 00:30:43.606 A:middle
And it uses a ton of iOS

00:30:43.606 --> 00:30:44.356 A:middle
technologies.

00:30:45.266 --> 00:30:47.596 A:middle
It's available for iPhone, iPad,

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:50.596 A:middle
Apple Watch, Messages, and even

00:30:50.596 --> 00:30:51.536 A:middle
as a Today widget.

00:30:52.826 --> 00:30:53.986 A:middle
I'd like to ask my colleague,

00:30:54.036 --> 00:30:56.576 A:middle
Tyler, to show it to you, now.

00:30:56.816 --> 00:30:57.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:30:58.316 --> 00:31:00.066 A:middle
Calzy has a fantastic formula

Calzy has a fantastic formula

design with the clever use of

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:04.006 A:middle
iOS technologies.

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:05.176 A:middle
Let's have a look.

00:31:05.706 --> 00:31:07.676 A:middle
There's Calzy, sweet as pi.

00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:09.506 A:middle
As you can see, right there,

00:31:09.506 --> 00:31:11.846 A:middle
it's got a simple yet elegant

00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:12.376 A:middle
layout.

00:31:12.376 --> 00:31:14.846 A:middle
And have a look at this, great

minds think alike.

00:31:17.606 --> 00:31:20.336 A:middle
So, Calzy does everything you'd

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:21.826 A:middle
expect a calculator to do.

00:31:22.676 --> 00:31:24.596 A:middle
This single screen app is packed

00:31:24.596 --> 00:31:26.966 A:middle
with features revealed by using

00:31:26.966 --> 00:31:29.126 A:middle

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:30.056 A:middle
these sliding menus.

Perfect for singlehanded use.

00:31:32.496 --> 00:31:33.776 A:middle
And if that single hand happens

00:31:33.836 --> 00:31:34.946 A:middle
to be your left hand the

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:36.426 A:middle
keyboard is fully adjustable.

00:31:36.646 --> 00:31:37.776 A:middle
You can have different keyboard

00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:39.196 A:middle
layouts for the main app, as

00:31:39.196 --> 00:31:40.486 A:middle
well as the widget and the

00:31:40.486 --> 00:31:42.306 A:middle
iMessage's app for maximal

00:31:42.346 --> 00:31:42.946 A:middle
flexibility.

00:31:43.976 --> 00:31:46.796 A:middle
The standard layout, as you see

00:31:46.796 --> 00:31:47.086 A:middle
here.

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:48.536 A:middle
Calzy, also, of course, supports

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:50.326 A:middle
the scientific layout, no

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:51.356 A:middle
rotation necessary.

00:31:51.356 --> 00:31:53.306 A:middle
Now, I'm not really a math

00:31:53.366 --> 00:31:54.746 A:middle
person, so these are all just

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.596 A:middle
kind of Greek to me.

00:31:56.366 --> 00:31:58.326 A:middle
But speaking of science, I was

00:31:58.326 --> 00:31:59.416 A:middle
recently reading an article.

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:01.306 A:middle
At least, John smiled at that.

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:01.306 A:middle
At least, John smiled at that.

00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:02.246 A:middle
I was recently reading an

00:32:02.246 --> 00:32:04.196 A:middle
article about a very ambitious

00:32:04.196 --> 00:32:06.056 A:middle
effort to quantify the weight of

00:32:06.056 --> 00:32:07.366 A:middle
all the biomass on earth.

00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:08.776 A:middle
And so, I went to the study and

00:32:08.776 --> 00:32:09.886 A:middle
I grabbed some of the numbers

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.326 A:middle
and I put them here in Calzy's

00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:13.026 A:middle
Bookmarks function, which is a

00:32:13.026 --> 00:32:13.996 A:middle
really handy way to store

00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:14.596 A:middle
information.

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.506 A:middle
Here, we can see this is the sum

00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:18.546 A:middle
of the biomass of all the taxa

00:32:18.546 --> 00:32:19.166 A:middle
on the earth.

00:32:19.466 --> 00:32:21.376 A:middle
And it's rendered in gigatons of

00:32:21.376 --> 00:32:22.866 A:middle
carbon, of course.

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:25.236 A:middle
Anyway, the Bookmark stores both

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:27.166 A:middle
the expression and the value.

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:28.326 A:middle
So, if we find a new form of

00:32:28.326 --> 00:32:29.506 A:middle
life I can always update the

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:30.106 A:middle
expression.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:32.226 A:middle
And then, the values themselves

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:33.616 A:middle
can, actually, be stored up here

00:32:33.616 --> 00:32:35.206 A:middle
in the memory area at the top of

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:36.856 A:middle
the screen, waiting patiently

00:32:36.856 --> 00:32:37.986 A:middle
for me to drag them into another

00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:38.666 A:middle
calculation.

00:32:39.756 --> 00:32:41.236 A:middle
So, you're probably wondering,

00:32:41.236 --> 00:32:42.796 A:middle
or at least I know in am, what's

00:32:42.796 --> 00:32:44.326 A:middle
the prevalence of bacteria

00:32:44.326 --> 00:32:45.646 A:middle
versus people on the earth.

00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:47.266 A:middle
So, we go back in here to the

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:47.876 A:middle
Bookmark.

00:32:47.876 --> 00:32:48.936 A:middle
I know you were wondering it.

00:32:49.286 --> 00:32:50.296 A:middle
And you take a look, here, the

00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:52.036 A:middle
weight of all bacteria on earth

00:32:52.386 --> 00:32:54.436 A:middle
is 70 gigatons.

00:32:54.436 --> 00:32:55.256 A:middle
I'm going to put that in there.

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:56.486 A:middle
And then, we're going to divide

00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:57.986 A:middle
that by the weight of all the

00:32:58.036 --> 00:32:59.566 A:middle
people on the earth, which is a

00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
paltry .06 gigatons.

00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
paltry .06 gigatons.

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:04.096 A:middle
Now, if you notice that you've

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.426 A:middle
made a mistake, all you have to

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:07.776 A:middle
do is go into the expression, 3D

00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:09.356 A:middle
Touch on the operator, put the

00:33:09.356 --> 00:33:10.146 A:middle
correct one in.

00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:12.016 A:middle
And this way, you can see that

00:33:12.016 --> 00:33:13.386 A:middle
the weight of tall bacteria is

00:33:13.386 --> 00:33:15.276 A:middle
about 1,200 times greater than

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.376 A:middle
the weight of all people.

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
That's a lot of bacteria.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.786 A:middle
So, wash your hands before

00:33:18.786 --> 00:33:19.716 A:middle

00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:36.296 A:middle
one is comprised of tiny little

00:35:36.296 --> 00:35:37.496 A:middle
light creatures swarming about.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.716 A:middle
And as we switch between levels

00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:41.016 A:middle
we can see them scatter and

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.206 A:middle
reform giving us a preview of

00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:44.636 A:middle
what's to come.

00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:46.196 A:middle
Now, when we get into the game

00:35:46.196 --> 00:35:47.656 A:middle
we see this stream of blue

00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:49.136 A:middle
creatures enter the gameboard.

00:35:49.136 --> 00:35:50.756 A:middle
And our objective, here, is to

00:35:50.756 --> 00:35:52.456 A:middle
help these little guys find

00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:53.636 A:middle
their way back to their home

00:35:53.636 --> 00:35:54.096 A:middle
planets.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:56.426 A:middle
Now, Frost was designed for

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.226 A:middle
Touch and it really shows.

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
Interactions are so simple and

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
Interactions are so simple and

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.826 A:middle
intuitive and natural.

00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:06.076 A:middle
And just behold how graceful and

00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:08.056 A:middle
beautiful the swarm is, just

00:36:08.056 --> 00:36:08.996 A:middle
with a little bit of

00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:10.076 A:middle
interaction.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:11.606 A:middle
It's really pretty.

00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:13.896 A:middle
Now, it seems here that the

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:16.476 A:middle
objective it to try to take some

00:36:16.476 --> 00:36:17.636 A:middle
of the blue creatures to one

00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.136 A:middle
planet and some to the other.

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.666 A:middle
So, to start over I simply tap

00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.906 A:middle
anywhere on the screen.

00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:25.676 A:middle
And using multitouch I can draw

00:36:25.676 --> 00:36:27.526 A:middle
two paths to each planet.

00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:29.846 A:middle
Now, when those yellow rings

00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:31.796 A:middle
fill, that's when I know how

00:36:31.796 --> 00:36:33.286 A:middle
many creatures each planet has

00:36:33.516 --> 00:36:34.036 A:middle
to hold.

00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:35.386 A:middle
Little bit more.

00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:37.956 A:middle
And once it fills all the way,

00:36:38.276 --> 00:36:39.776 A:middle
this really beautiful animation

00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:41.126 A:middle
plays to let me know that the

00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:42.246 A:middle
level is complete.

00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:43.756 A:middle
And on iPhone, they use haptics

00:36:43.926 --> 00:36:46.306 A:middle
to punctuate that animation and

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:47.566 A:middle
other special moments.

00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:50.276 A:middle
Now, every level in Frost is a

00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:51.626 A:middle
work of art.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.646 A:middle
But I want to skip ahead here to

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.386 A:middle
a more advanced level and go

00:36:55.386 --> 00:36:58.476 A:middle
from number 4 to number 24.

00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
Now, as we progress through the

00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
Now, as we progress through the

00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:03.006 A:middle
game we're introduced to new

00:37:03.006 --> 00:37:04.566 A:middle
creative challenges along the

00:37:04.566 --> 00:37:05.296 A:middle
way.

00:37:05.296 --> 00:37:07.656 A:middle
But also, new species with

00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:08.896 A:middle
different types of swarming

00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:09.476 A:middle
behaviors.

00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:11.656 A:middle
So, on this level we have yellow

00:37:11.656 --> 00:37:13.736 A:middle
creatures and blue and red.

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:15.156 A:middle
And it seems, here, that my

00:37:15.156 --> 00:37:16.426 A:middle
objective is to help the yellow

00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:17.446 A:middle
creatures get to the yellow

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:17.886 A:middle
planet.

00:37:18.346 --> 00:37:19.516 A:middle
So, I just make a beeline from

00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:20.416 A:middle
one place to another, but

00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.776 A:middle
they're not responding.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:23.316 A:middle
Blue ones don't really do

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.256 A:middle
anything, either.

00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:26.646 A:middle
Maybe, if I bring the red ones

00:37:26.646 --> 00:37:28.676 A:middle
over here it'll do something.

00:37:28.676 --> 00:37:29.786 A:middle
Oh, we can see those blue

00:37:29.786 --> 00:37:31.096 A:middle
creatures really scattered.

00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:32.956 A:middle
Now, what I want to do is just

00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:34.466 A:middle
pause here, for a second, and

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:37.196 A:middle
just kind of enjoy this moment

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:38.506 A:middle
that Frost creates for us.

00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:40.766 A:middle
The mood that it sets is so

00:37:41.086 --> 00:37:42.906 A:middle
ethereal, it's so soothing and

00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:43.646 A:middle
so tranquil.

00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:45.246 A:middle
Watching these creatures move

00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.166 A:middle
around is really mesmerizing and

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.116 A:middle
kind of hypnotic.

00:37:48.846 --> 00:37:50.076 A:middle
A lot of players will, actually,

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:53.436 A:middle
just kind of stop and enjoy this

00:37:53.476 --> 00:37:55.206 A:middle
experience and experiment and

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.356 A:middle
observe how the creatures

00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:58.426 A:middle
respond to touch, and really

00:37:58.526 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
soak it in.

00:38:00.616 --> 00:38:01.846 A:middle
But, not me.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:02.486 A:middle
I like winning.

00:38:02.996 --> 00:38:04.896 A:middle
So, I'm going to try to get the

00:38:04.946 --> 00:38:07.276 A:middle
red creatures to move around,

00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:08.586 A:middle
pick up the blue creatures who

00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:10.306 A:middle
might give a lift to the yellow

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:10.786 A:middle
creatures.

00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:12.296 A:middle
And help them find their way

00:38:12.296 --> 00:38:12.586 A:middle
home.

00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:14.516 A:middle
It's a crazy enough plan that I

00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:15.596 A:middle
think it just might work.

00:38:16.676 --> 00:38:18.536 A:middle
Now, Frost offers hours and

00:38:18.536 --> 00:38:20.136 A:middle
hours of gameplay.

00:38:20.896 --> 00:38:22.326 A:middle
And the sheer beauty of watching

00:38:22.436 --> 00:38:23.896 A:middle
thousands of individually

00:38:23.896 --> 00:38:25.666 A:middle
animating creatures move around

00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:28.036 A:middle
your iPhone or iPad is really

00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:28.756 A:middle
breathtaking.

00:38:29.726 --> 00:38:32.756 A:middle
Now, in order to power this real

00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:34.606 A:middle
time simulation, they needed

00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:35.766 A:middle
Metal on iOS.

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:37.686 A:middle
It's the only consumer mobile

00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:38.846 A:middle
device which has the

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:41.406 A:middle
computational power needed to

00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:42.786 A:middle
render these complex

00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:44.836 A:middle
programmatic animations.

00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:47.476 A:middle
But the thing that I love most

00:38:47.866 --> 00:38:50.526 A:middle
about Frost is how anyone can

00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:51.916 A:middle
play this game, regardless of

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:54.216 A:middle
their age or where they live or

00:38:54.516 --> 00:38:55.676 A:middle
what language they speak.

00:38:55.986 --> 00:38:57.856 A:middle
It can be a delightful, calming,

00:38:57.856 --> 00:38:59.176 A:middle
and engaging experience.

00:39:00.146 --> 00:39:02.006 A:middle
This is a really beautiful game.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:02.826 A:middle
Congratulations.

You had most of us mesmerized,

00:39:12.236 --> 00:39:12.816 A:middle
there.

00:39:13.316 --> 00:39:14.456 A:middle
All right.

00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:16.526 A:middle
Earlier, I spoke of code and

00:39:16.526 --> 00:39:18.416 A:middle
creativity, which when combined

00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:20.246 A:middle
with technology can produce

00:39:20.246 --> 00:39:21.536 A:middle
these transformative results.

00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:23.856 A:middle
Our next winner is an app that

00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:25.786 A:middle
is disrupting and uniquely

00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:27.476 A:middle

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:07.446 A:middle
And you've got to see this to

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.156 A:middle
believe it.

00:40:08.456 --> 00:40:09.396 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.186 A:middle
Here's Chris and Divia from our

00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:13.786 A:middle
Health Team to show you how it

00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:14.616 A:middle
works.

00:40:15.486 --> 00:40:17.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We love when teams tackle

00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.756 A:middle
huge problems in unique ways.

00:40:20.176 --> 00:40:21.936 A:middle
Especially, in healthcare.

00:40:22.616 --> 00:40:24.906 A:middle
Today, many clinicians have no

00:40:24.906 --> 00:40:26.416 A:middle
idea how to estimate how much

00:40:26.416 --> 00:40:28.296 A:middle
blood patients are losing in

00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:28.976 A:middle
procedures.

00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:31.376 A:middle
As a result, a lot of clinical

00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:32.846 A:middle
decisions are made based on

00:40:32.846 --> 00:40:34.886 A:middle
guesstimation, which can lead to

00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:36.806 A:middle
all sorts of complications.

00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:39.036 A:middle
Gauss Surgical is solving this

problem using an iPad, machine

learning, and computer vision.

00:40:43.736 --> 00:40:45.256 A:middle
Before we show you a demo, I'd

00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.626 A:middle
like to introduce you to Chris

00:40:46.626 --> 00:40:47.976 A:middle
and the tools we'll be using.

00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:51.436 A:middle
We have an iPad Pro with an IR

00:40:51.436 --> 00:40:53.016 A:middle
sensor, and some surgical

00:40:53.016 --> 00:40:54.326 A:middle
sponges that are used in

00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:55.906 A:middle
operating rooms to soak up

blood.

00:40:57.176 --> 00:40:58.526 A:middle
Now, for the purposes of this

00:40:58.526 --> 00:40:59.956 A:middle
demo, we're going to mimic some

food coloring.

00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:04.986 A:middle
But if you start to feel queasy,

00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:07.066 A:middle
at all, please avert your eyes

00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:08.156 A:middle
for just a moment.

00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:11.556 A:middle
Gauss' app is super simple to

00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:11.916 A:middle
use.

00:41:12.426 --> 00:41:14.036 A:middle
All you have to do is hold up a

00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:15.286 A:middle
sponge in front of the camera.

00:41:16.316 --> 00:41:18.696 A:middle
From there, Gauss uses Core ML

00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:20.446 A:middle
to detect the sponge using the

00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:21.836 A:middle
camera and IR sensor.

00:41:22.466 --> 00:41:23.616 A:middle
They've then developed some

00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:24.896 A:middle
custom machine learning

00:41:24.896 --> 00:41:27.166 A:middle
algorithms to analyze the red

00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:28.806 A:middle
spots of blood and, actually,

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.086 A:middle
calculate blood loss.

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:31.536 A:middle
It's amazing.

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:34.386 A:middle
Gauss' app is FDA approved and

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:36.026 A:middle

00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:38.986 A:middle
But now, let's see if it's hippo

compliant.

00:41:39.616 --> 00:41:42.536 A:middle
As you can imagine.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:44.766 A:middle
As you can imagine, it's

00:41:44.766 --> 00:41:46.156 A:middle
incredibly important in an

00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:49.516 A:middle
don't accidentally double count

00:42:02.146 --> 00:42:03.176 A:middle
to the duplication.

00:42:04.436 --> 00:42:06.266 A:middle
That is amazing.

00:42:06.956 --> 00:42:08.226 A:middle
Gauss' app is being used in

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:10.086 A:middle
hospitals all across the country

00:42:10.086 --> 00:42:12.436 A:middle
in labor and delivery use cases.

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.036 A:middle
And we couldn't be more excited

00:42:14.036 --> 00:42:14.916 A:middle
about their work.

00:42:15.306 --> 00:42:16.926 A:middle
Congrats to the entire Gauss

00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:20.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:20.586 A:middle
Well done, guys.

00:42:25.666 --> 00:42:26.456 A:middle
That's pretty cool.

00:42:27.246 --> 00:42:29.986 A:middle
And our final award for this

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:31.606 A:middle
evening goes to a brilliantly

00:42:31.606 --> 00:42:32.936 A:middle
executed platformer.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:35.366 A:middle
It's got a ton of personality,

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:38.496 A:middle
has great performance, a fun

00:42:38.576 --> 00:42:40.546 A:middle
soundtrack, and it's super

00:42:40.546 --> 00:42:40.966 A:middle
addictive.

00:42:40.966 --> 00:42:43.506 A:middle
And it took four years to make.

00:42:44.356 --> 00:42:45.626 A:middle
Join me in celebrating our final

00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:47.616 A:middle
winner, Oddmar by Mobge.

[ Music ]

00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:18.546 A:middle
Oddmar was developed by a team,

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:20.226 A:middle
a small team of four, two of

00:43:20.226 --> 00:43:22.156 A:middle
whom are here, at a university

00:43:22.156 --> 00:43:23.906 A:middle
in Turkey, which goes to show

00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:25.296 A:middle
that great games don't always

00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:26.306 A:middle
come from the places that you

00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:26.846 A:middle
would expect.

00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:29.406 A:middle
We've had a blast with this game

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.906 A:middle
and we think you will, too.

00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:32.386 A:middle
We'd like to show it to you,

00:43:32.386 --> 00:43:32.656 A:middle
now.

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:39.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

00:43:40.596 --> 00:43:41.956 A:middle
Oddmar is a gorgeous

00:43:42.076 --> 00:43:44.046 A:middle
action-adventure platformer that

00:43:44.046 --> 00:43:45.856 A:middle
is beautiful, charming, and

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:46.366 A:middle
humorous.

00:43:46.846 --> 00:43:48.606 A:middle
Let us introduce you to Oddmar

00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:50.826 A:middle
and our not so successful Viking

00:43:50.826 --> 00:43:52.356 A:middle
hero on the journey to prove

00:43:52.356 --> 00:43:53.976 A:middle
himself worthy of Valhalla.

00:43:56.686 --> 00:43:57.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The onboarding is smooth and

00:43:57.656 --> 00:43:59.276 A:middle
the controls are easy to use

00:43:59.276 --> 00:44:00.136 A:middle
gesture controls.

00:43:59.276 --> 00:44:00.136 A:middle
gesture controls.

00:44:00.436 --> 00:44:01.806 A:middle
Simply, swipe left and right

00:44:01.926 --> 00:44:03.586 A:middle
with your left hand to move, and

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:04.936 A:middle
up and down with your right hand

00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:05.456 A:middle
to jump.

00:44:06.886 --> 00:44:08.876 A:middle
Oddmar with its 24 handcrafted

00:44:08.916 --> 00:44:10.416 A:middle
artistic levels in a Norse

00:44:10.486 --> 00:44:12.316 A:middle
mythology storyline is full of

00:44:12.436 --> 00:44:13.746 A:middle
secrets and challenges.

00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:15.426 A:middle
As you travel through the

00:44:15.476 --> 00:44:16.926 A:middle
adventures of Oddmar, from

00:44:16.926 --> 00:44:18.456 A:middle
magical forests to treacherous

00:44:18.546 --> 00:44:20.446 A:middle
mines, beautifully animated

00:44:20.566 --> 00:44:22.166 A:middle
comic style cuts scenes between

00:44:22.166 --> 00:44:23.806 A:middle
the levels will help you find

00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:24.776 A:middle
your way to Valhalla.

00:44:25.386 --> 00:44:27.106 A:middle
The game really shines with its

00:44:27.106 --> 00:44:28.626 A:middle
visual elements, with beautiful

00:44:28.816 --> 00:44:30.616 A:middle
scenic multiplane landscapes,

00:44:30.756 --> 00:44:32.156 A:middle
lighting, and animation that

00:44:32.156 --> 00:44:33.346 A:middle
almost brings it to life.

00:44:34.336 --> 00:44:36.086 A:middle
Oddmar, our Viking hero, is so

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:38.156 A:middle
brilliantly animated that it

00:44:38.156 --> 00:44:39.426 A:middle
puts a smile on your face,

00:44:39.666 --> 00:44:40.846 A:middle
whether he's jumping on

00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:42.486 A:middle
mushrooms, running through the

00:44:42.486 --> 00:44:43.746 A:middle
rivers, or as he's simply

00:44:43.746 --> 00:44:44.916 A:middle
waiting for you to play.

00:44:46.486 --> 00:44:47.776 A:middle
New game mechanics and controls

00:44:47.776 --> 00:44:49.166 A:middle
are introduced for the player at

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:49.806 A:middle
every level.

00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:51.286 A:middle
And as the players progress

00:44:51.416 --> 00:44:52.466 A:middle
through the levels, unique

00:44:52.536 --> 00:44:53.886 A:middle
dangers and boss fights

00:44:54.486 --> 00:44:56.236 A:middle
challenges the players in new

00:44:56.236 --> 00:44:56.946 A:middle
and fun ways.

00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:59.386 A:middle
The game really does a fantastic

00:44:59.536 --> 00:45:01.466 A:middle
job of bringing excitement with

00:44:59.536 --> 00:45:01.466 A:middle
job of bringing excitement with

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:03.736 A:middle
every new character, control,

00:45:03.736 --> 00:45:05.666 A:middle
and level, while introducing

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:07.186 A:middle
these at a pace that allows the

00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:08.176 A:middle
players to master it.

00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:11.656 A:middle
The soundtrack influenced by the

00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:13.266 A:middle
traditional Swedish folk music

00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:17.156 A:middle
really gives the game its Nordic

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.716 A:middle
Viking setting at every level.

00:45:19.866 --> 00:45:21.926 A:middle
It was recorded at a studio in a

00:45:21.926 --> 00:45:23.296 A:middle
small village deep in the

00:45:23.376 --> 00:45:25.000 A:middle
forests of southern Sweden.

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:27.876 A:middle
So, every aspect of the game,

00:45:28.206 --> 00:45:30.516 A:middle
from level design to story to

00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:32.116 A:middle
music was made with great

00:45:32.306 --> 00:45:33.566 A:middle
effort, dedication to detail,

00:45:33.656 --> 00:45:34.536 A:middle
and craft.

00:45:35.386 --> 00:45:37.256 A:middle
As visually stunning as it is

00:45:37.476 --> 00:45:38.556 A:middle
with the level of detail and

00:45:38.626 --> 00:45:40.416 A:middle
artwork, Oddmar calls for a

00:45:40.416 --> 00:45:42.636 A:middle
larger screenplay and we think

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:44.046 A:middle
you will love it on iPad Pro.

00:45:45.136 --> 00:45:46.496 A:middle
It supports the use of game

00:45:46.496 --> 00:45:48.416 A:middle
controllers, allows you to play

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:50.546 A:middle
and sync on multiple devices by

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.476 A:middle
saving on iCloud.

00:45:52.746 --> 00:45:54.596 A:middle
Oddmar benefits from using Metal

00:45:54.856 --> 00:45:56.646 A:middle
to create this visually stunning

00:45:56.646 --> 00:45:58.416 A:middle
and fluid gameplay experience.

00:45:59.106 --> 00:45:59.846 A:middle
It uses only [inaudible]

00:46:00.036 --> 00:46:01.836 A:middle
resources to reduce the initial

00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
time to load by letting players

00:46:03.786 --> 00:46:04.806 A:middle
download the levels in the

00:46:04.806 --> 00:46:07.406 A:middle

your friends.

00:46:10.536 --> 00:46:12.046 A:middle
Oddmar is localized into 12

00:46:12.046 --> 00:46:14.726 A:middle

Five incredible apps, five

This trophy is a solid piece of

00:46:48.986 --> 00:46:51.496 A:middle
aluminum that lights up when

00:46:51.496 --> 00:46:51.986 A:middle
touched.

00:46:52.806 --> 00:46:54.926 A:middle
So, the Apple logo on top lights

00:46:54.926 --> 00:46:56.436 A:middle
up just like the top of your

00:46:56.436 --> 00:46:57.056 A:middle

must-have.

00:47:02.106 --> 00:47:03.196 A:middle
It's definitely something to

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:04.406 A:middle
collect and something to be

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.546 A:middle
super proud of.

make in its best configuration.

years, in some cases.

00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:03.976 A:middle
These ten apps set new standards

00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:06.356 A:middle
for innovation, design,

brilliance, execution,

performance, creativity,

craftsmanship, optimization,

much more.
