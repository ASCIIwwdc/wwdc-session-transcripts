[ Music ]

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:22.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone!

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:23.846 A:middle
Good morning!

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:28.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:29.766 A:middle
Thanks, everyone, for being here

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:30.136 A:middle
today.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:31.516 A:middle
My name's Jesse Pease.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:32.476 A:middle
And I'm an engineer on the

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:33.666 A:middle
Health Engineering Team.

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.266 A:middle
And today, I'm going to show you

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.606 A:middle
how to make your very first app.

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.286 A:middle
So today we're going to step out

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:41.256 A:middle
of our comfort zones.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:42.736 A:middle
We're going to explore, and

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.006 A:middle
we're going to start building

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:44.866 A:middle
our dream app.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:46.206 A:middle
You know that one that you've

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:47.316 A:middle
had in the back of your mind

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:48.216 A:middle
while you're waiting in line for

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.016 A:middle
your coffee in the morning?

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.716 A:middle
Or that one that you drew out on

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.306 A:middle
your napkin on the flight out

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.096 A:middle
here to WWDC?

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:54.746 A:middle
Or that one that you tell your

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:55.676 A:middle
friends about and make them

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:57.256 A:middle
promise not to tell anyone else?

00:00:58.136 --> 00:00:59.446 A:middle
That one. That's the idea we're

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
going to start working on today.


00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
going to start working on today.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.016 A:middle
As Joseph Chilton Pearce said,

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:07.106 A:middle
"To live a creative life we must

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.346 A:middle
lose the fear of being wrong."

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.286 A:middle
And when we start building new

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:11.986 A:middle
ideas, we're bound to run into

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:12.836 A:middle
bumps in the road.

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:14.836 A:middle
But our goal today is to show

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.126 A:middle
you all the building blocks you

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:17.796 A:middle
need to make your dream app a

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:18.286 A:middle
reality.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:21.386 A:middle
We're going to start off today

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:22.976 A:middle
by organizing our ideas.

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:24.696 A:middle
Then we're going to learn how to

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:25.546 A:middle
navigate Xcode.

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:27.776 A:middle
And then build a simple game

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:28.526 A:middle
using Swift.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.546 A:middle
Now familiarity with a

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.826 A:middle
programming language will help

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:32.366 A:middle
you today.

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:34.206 A:middle
But if you're new to Swift or

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:35.516 A:middle
looking for a helpful resource,

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.296 A:middle
I recommend downloading the App

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.146 A:middle
Development with Swift book from

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:40.036 A:middle
the Apple bookstore.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.486 A:middle
Or checking out the Swift

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:44.506 A:middle
Playgrounds app for iPad.

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:46.026 A:middle
Later [inaudible] is going to

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.696 A:middle
show you how to add multiple

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:49.286 A:middle
views within your app and then

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:50.856 A:middle
persist in display data for your

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:52.496 A:middle
users over time.

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:55.046 A:middle
So Tono [phonetic] and I were

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:56.556 A:middle
recently at a unicorn petting

00:01:56.556 --> 00:01:56.806 A:middle
zoo.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.346 A:middle
Yes, we actually have these in

00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:58.806 A:middle
California.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
And we were after having this


00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
And we were after having this

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.516 A:middle
experience countless times of

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:03.336 A:middle
waiting in line.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:04.956 A:middle
We decided that we needed to

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.016 A:middle
make something to keep ourselves

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.116 A:middle
occupied while we wait.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:08.966 A:middle
So we decided to make a game.

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.106 A:middle
Something quick and fun to keep

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:12.326 A:middle
us occupied for a short amount

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:12.806 A:middle
of time.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:14.726 A:middle
And I said, "Well, of course if

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:15.876 A:middle
we make a game, it has to have

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:16.526 A:middle
unicorns."

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
But then we needed something

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
that people would want to avoid.

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:21.726 A:middle
Maybe poop.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.296 A:middle
And so we decided to make a

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:26.636 A:middle
whack-a-mole-type game with

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:27.836 A:middle
unicorn and poop.

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.966 A:middle
And then incorporate scores and

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.586 A:middle
eventually a leaderboard to keep

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:32.896 A:middle
track of our scores over time.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:33.976 A:middle
Because we have a little bit of

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:34.916 A:middle
a competitive nature.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.816 A:middle
So let's take a look at what

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:39.086 A:middle
this game play looks like.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:42.006 A:middle
Upon pressing start game, a

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.496 A:middle
random emoji's going to appear

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:44.676 A:middle
somewhere randomly on the

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:45.006 A:middle
screen.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.896 A:middle
Either a unicorn or a poop.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:49.556 A:middle
At that point, the user has one

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.086 A:middle
second to click that button.

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:54.286 A:middle
Now, if they hit the unicorn,

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:55.876 A:middle
then they get one point.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.446 A:middle
Then if they accidentally tap

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:59.416 A:middle
the poop, then the game is over.


00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:01.686 A:middle
But in addition to this, if they

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:03.076 A:middle
miss the unicorn, the

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:05.276 A:middle
not-so-lonely unicorn, and so

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:06.556 A:middle
they automatically lose the

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:06.856 A:middle
game.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.706 A:middle
So the goal is hit all the

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:09.316 A:middle
unicorns.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.116 A:middle
Don't hit the poops.

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:12.356 A:middle
Let's take a look at this.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.356 A:middle
Get it! Nice!

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:19.516 A:middle
Get that unicorn.

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:23.346 A:middle
Oh! There we go, one more.

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:24.426 A:middle
Oh! Oh, shoot.

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:25.686 A:middle
Moving too quickly and

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.736 A:middle
accidentally hit a poop.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:29.276 A:middle
Let's jump right in.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:32.016 A:middle
So for those of you who aren't

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:34.256 A:middle
familiar, Xcode is a tool we use

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
on macOS to help build iOS,

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:38.666 A:middle
macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:41.276 A:middle
You can download it from the App

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:42.086 A:middle
Store if you don't have it

00:03:42.086 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
already.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.206 A:middle
So when we open up Xcode, we

00:03:45.206 --> 00:03:46.736 A:middle
first want to select create a

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:47.826 A:middle
new Xcode project.

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:51.126 A:middle
After this, we see all the

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:52.556 A:middle
different type of app templates

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:53.316 A:middle
that we can create.

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.076 A:middle
In our case, we're going to

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:56.126 A:middle
select single view app.

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:57.736 A:middle
But notice here that you could

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.706 A:middle
also select a page based app, a

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
sticker pack app, or even a


00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
sticker pack app, or even a

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:01.656 A:middle
game.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
But our game is very simple, so

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.816 A:middle
we will just stick with single

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:05.976 A:middle
view app.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:08.886 A:middle
And then hit next.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.146 A:middle
From here we type in our app

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.216 A:middle
name, which in our case is

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.416 A:middle
Disappearing Unicorns.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.066 A:middle
And our ex-- , our team name is

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:14.926 A:middle
Example Team.

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:16.296 A:middle
And hit next.

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.875 A:middle
After we choose a place to save

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
our app, we're dropped into the

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.255 A:middle
project settings.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:22.766 A:middle
Now we won't be making any

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.376 A:middle
changes here today, so we'll go

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:25.336 A:middle
ahead and look at the other

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:26.736 A:middle
important files in our Project

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.436 A:middle
Navigator on the left-hand side.

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:30.186 A:middle
The first one is the

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:30.896 A:middle
AppDelegate.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:34.156 A:middle
An AppDelegate is created for

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:35.856 A:middle
each app, and it helps us manage

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:37.196 A:middle
the lifecycle of our app over

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:37.416 A:middle
time.

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:39.626 A:middle
There's certain methods that can

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.936 A:middle
be called when we're going into

00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
the background or coming into

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:42.866 A:middle
the foreground.

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:44.586 A:middle
But we won't be making any

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
changes with our AppDelegate

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:46.416 A:middle
today either.

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:49.966 A:middle
Next I'm going to select the

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.356 A:middle
main storyboard file.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:53.746 A:middle
The storyboard is where we

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:55.336 A:middle
create the UI or the user

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.116 A:middle
interface for our app.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.006 A:middle
And where we can add all of the

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.806 A:middle
UI elements like buttons,

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
labels, or images.


00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
labels, or images.

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.056 A:middle
But it's not just where we

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.626 A:middle
create that one single view.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:06.306 A:middle
It's also where we lay out all

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.786 A:middle
of the logical flow for our app

00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:08.566 A:middle
over time.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:09.416 A:middle
The story.

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.506 A:middle
Next we'll select the view

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:13.036 A:middle
controller.

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:16.536 A:middle
The view controller helps us

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:17.966 A:middle
control out view, and this is

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:19.246 A:middle
where we'll write the logical

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:22.126 A:middle
code for our app.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:23.436 A:middle
Well let's talk about how we

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.156 A:middle
create our views within our

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:25.866 A:middle
storyboard.

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:28.536 A:middle
Let's navigate back over to the

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.846 A:middle
main dot-storyboard file.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:32.006 A:middle
And at this point, make sure not

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:32.656 A:middle
to select the

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
launchscreen.storyboard.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.586 A:middle
The launchscreen storyboard is

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.206 A:middle
what we use to create the view

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:39.296 A:middle
for when our app is being

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:40.466 A:middle
launched or loaded onto the

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.646 A:middle
screen the first time.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.166 A:middle
You'll notice in the upper

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.116 A:middle
right-hand corner of our

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.646 A:middle
storyboard here that there's an

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:48.976 A:middle
object library button.

00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:50.476 A:middle
This is a button with a circle

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:51.816 A:middle
and a little square inside.

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:53.886 A:middle
This is where we can take things

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.326 A:middle
like buttons or labels or images

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:57.766 A:middle
and drag them onto our

00:05:57.766 --> 00:05:58.446 A:middle
storyboard.

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll


00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.186 A:middle
see the outline view for our

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:04.026 A:middle
app.

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:05.916 A:middle
And if you click the little

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
disclosure triangle, you'll see

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.336 A:middle
all the different things that

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.836 A:middle
are currently on our storyboard.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.346 A:middle
Now you're thinking to yourself,

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.366 A:middle
"There's nothing on this

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:12.896 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:13.736 A:middle
Why is this helpful?"

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.546 A:middle
Well, in the future, you may

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.836 A:middle
have lots of elements on your

00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:17.436 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.106 A:middle
And eventually you may not be

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.176 A:middle
able to find something because

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:21.256 A:middle
it could be under something

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:21.466 A:middle
else.

00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:22.456 A:middle
Or maybe you've accidentally

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:23.356 A:middle
created duplicates.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:24.846 A:middle
So this is a great place to go

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:25.816 A:middle
if you're looking for all of the

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:26.776 A:middle
elements that you've put on your

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:27.356 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:30.306 A:middle
Alright. Let's go ahead and jump

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.756 A:middle
into our demo and start making

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:31.976 A:middle
our app.

00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:35.796 A:middle
So here I'm going to go over to

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.426 A:middle
my computer where I already have

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.136 A:middle
Xcode launched.

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.796 A:middle
Okay. And I have my Disappearing

00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:43.896 A:middle
Unicorns file.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.496 A:middle
Here I'm navigating to the main

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:47.746 A:middle
And let's go ahead and start off

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:48.946 A:middle
by adding all of those UI

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:50.376 A:middle
elements that we need to create

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:50.776 A:middle
our game.

00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:52.436 A:middle
So I'm going to go up to the

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:53.506 A:middle
object library.

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:55.276 A:middle
And I can scroll through here

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.486 A:middle
and see all of the different

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:57.636 A:middle
things that I can put on there.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:01.136 A:middle
We have labels, buttons, text


00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:01.136 A:middle
We have labels, buttons, text

00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:03.726 A:middle
fields, activity indicators,

00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:04.836 A:middle
even images.

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.576 A:middle
But let's start off with that

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.656 A:middle
start-game button.

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:10.306 A:middle
So here I'll search for button.

00:07:11.136 --> 00:07:13.356 A:middle
And click and drag the button to

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:14.526 A:middle
the center of my storyboard.

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.506 A:middle
Here I'll double click to change

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.106 A:middle
the text to start game,

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.346 A:middle
exclamation point.

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:22.886 A:middle
But this is a little bit small.

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.816 A:middle
So in order to make this larger,

00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:26.306 A:middle
I can go to the upper right-hand

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:27.716 A:middle
corner of Xcode and open up the

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:28.586 A:middle
Inspector pane.

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.276 A:middle
And then select this little

00:07:30.356 --> 00:07:31.466 A:middle
slider button which is the

00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:32.486 A:middle
Attributes Inspector.

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:33.886 A:middle
This is where we change

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.946 A:middle
attributes of the items on our

00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:36.556 A:middle
storyboard.

00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:38.326 A:middle
In this case, I'm going to make

00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:39.286 A:middle
my font much bigger.

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:42.856 A:middle
From size 15 to size 50.

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.056 A:middle
And hit done.

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:46.726 A:middle
Now to quickly create copies of

00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:48.716 A:middle
items on our storyboard, I can

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:50.526 A:middle
hold down the option key and

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.526 A:middle
click and drag on my storyboard

00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:53.776 A:middle
to quickly create another copy

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:54.446 A:middle
of this button.

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:56.926 A:middle
And so in this case, I'm going

00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:59.656 A:middle
to change start game to the

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.026 A:middle
emoji for a unicorn.


00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.026 A:middle
emoji for a unicorn.

00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:02.206 A:middle
And to pull up the emoji

00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:03.216 A:middle
keyboard, I can hit the

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:06.886 A:middle
control-command-space key and

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:07.816 A:middle
select unicorn.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:11.576 A:middle
Great! Let's go ahead and make a

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:13.966 A:middle
quick copy of this as well for

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:14.946 A:middle
our poop.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:20.206 A:middle
Control-command-space and poop.

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:22.986 A:middle
Awesome. And one more button for

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.076 A:middle
our leaderboard button.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:26.596 A:middle
So click, option, drag.

00:08:27.346 --> 00:08:29.676 A:middle
Double click leaderboard.

00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:31.906 A:middle
Uh-oh. Not all caps.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:34.676 A:middle
And change our font here from

00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:37.096 A:middle
size 50 to size something much

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:37.616 A:middle
smaller.

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.046 A:middle
Maybe 25. Awesome.

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:42.316 A:middle
Now we need one more element on

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:45.496 A:middle
our storyboard which is a label

00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:46.106 A:middle
for our points.

00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:48.666 A:middle
So go back to my object library

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:49.846 A:middle
and search for label.

00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:52.116 A:middle
And then click and drag this

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:53.016 A:middle
onto the screen.

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:54.986 A:middle
Here I'm going to change this

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:56.696 A:middle
text to be zero.

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:58.246 A:middle
And then change the font to

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
something much larger like size


00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
something much larger like size

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:00.836 A:middle
90.

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:04.036 A:middle
Awesome! There we go.

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.606 A:middle
Now we have all of the UI

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:06.896 A:middle
elements that we need to create

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:07.296 A:middle
our game.

00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:09.516 A:middle
Let's go ahead and start

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.536 A:middle
connecting our UI to our code.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.046 A:middle
Now to have both the storyboard

00:09:14.046 --> 00:09:15.376 A:middle
and the view controller code up

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:17.246 A:middle
at the same time, I can open up

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:18.566 A:middle
this Assistant Editor.

00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
It's the button with two

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:21.176 A:middle
overlapping circles.

00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:25.576 A:middle
Awesome. Now there's a bunch of

00:09:25.626 --> 00:09:26.756 A:middle
different types of connections

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.396 A:middle
that we can make between the

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:29.636 A:middle
objects on our storyboard and

00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:30.146 A:middle
our code.

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:31.966 A:middle
Now the first type is called an

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:33.906 A:middle
outlet, and an outlet lets us

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.516 A:middle
refer to our user interface

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:36.466 A:middle
within our code.

00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:38.306 A:middle
Let's start out by creating an

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:39.516 A:middle
outlet for this start game

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:40.036 A:middle
button.

00:09:41.116 --> 00:09:42.866 A:middle
To create an outlet, I select

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:44.016 A:middle
the start-game button on the

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.396 A:middle
storyboard, hold down the

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
control key, and click and drag

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:49.146 A:middle
over to my storyboard.

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:50.136 A:middle
Sorry, over to my view

00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:52.686 A:middle
controller code, and let go.

00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:54.576 A:middle
At this point, I change my

00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:56.626 A:middle
connection from-- type-- oh,

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:57.606 A:middle
it's already outlet.

00:09:57.656 --> 00:09:59.536 A:middle
Perfect. And I'm going to name

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:02.596 A:middle
this start game button and hit


00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:02.596 A:middle
this start game button and hit

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:02.896 A:middle
connect.

00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:05.776 A:middle
Awesome. Now we have a

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:07.586 A:middle
connection between our code and

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:08.356 A:middle
our storyboard.

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:09.806 A:middle
And we can double check that

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:10.696 A:middle
this connection was made

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:13.226 A:middle
correctly, by seeing this little

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.976 A:middle
gray circle to left of

00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:15.836 A:middle
start-game button.

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:17.896 A:middle
If we hover over it, it

00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:18.916 A:middle
highlights the item on our

00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.986 A:middle
storyboard that is connected to

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.416 A:middle
this code.

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
Now, in the interest of time,

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.546 A:middle
I've already written the code

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:27.866 A:middle
for our other outlets.

00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:29.736 A:middle
But you'll notice that to the

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.106 A:middle
left of them, they have open

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:31.646 A:middle
circles.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.126 A:middle
This means that they haven't

00:10:33.126 --> 00:10:34.416 A:middle
been connected to our storyboard

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:34.556 A:middle
yet.

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
To make the connections, we just

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.716 A:middle
click inside the circle to the

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.246 A:middle
left of good button in this

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:40.626 A:middle
case.

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:42.586 A:middle
And drag over to our unicorn

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:43.796 A:middle
button which is the button we

00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:45.226 A:middle
want to be associated with this

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:45.776 A:middle
line of code.

00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:46.626 A:middle
And let go.

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
We'll do the same thing for bad

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:53.836 A:middle
button, leaderboard button, and

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:54.506 A:middle
points label.

00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:57.016 A:middle
Awesome. Now all of these

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:58.116 A:middle
connections have been made.

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
Now another type of connection


00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
Now another type of connection

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:02.116 A:middle
we can make is called an action.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.596 A:middle
And an action is a piece of code

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.276 A:middle
that's linked to an event that

00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:07.176 A:middle
can occur within our app.

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:09.706 A:middle
In this case, I want an action

00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:11.416 A:middle
method for whenever my

00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
start-game button is pressed.

00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:15.766 A:middle
So to create this connection, I

00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:17.046 A:middle
could hold down the control key

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.786 A:middle
once again with the start-game

00:11:18.786 --> 00:11:21.346 A:middle
button and click and drag over

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:22.656 A:middle
to my view controller code.

00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:24.886 A:middle
And let go.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:26.386 A:middle
This time I will change my

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.916 A:middle
connection to type action and

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.306 A:middle
name this start pressed.

00:11:31.546 --> 00:11:33.576 A:middle
And I want my event to be a

00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:35.536 A:middle
touchup inside event, and hit

00:11:35.576 --> 00:11:35.836 A:middle
connect.

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:38.836 A:middle
Awesome. You'll notice that

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.926 A:middle
there's this closed circle once

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:41.106 A:middle
again.

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:43.426 A:middle
And when I hover over it, the

00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:44.196 A:middle
start-game button is

00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:44.726 A:middle
highlighted.

00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:47.186 A:middle
Now I've already written two

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.096 A:middle
other action methods for both

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:50.456 A:middle
our good pressed and our bad

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:51.126 A:middle
button pressed.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.286 A:middle
But I actually want to make a

00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:54.716 A:middle
different type of connection

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:55.276 A:middle
this time.

00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.986 A:middle
I want to create an event or an

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.726 A:middle
action event for when I press


00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.726 A:middle
action event for when I press

00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:02.316 A:middle
down on my button.

00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:04.116 A:middle
Because I want my user to get

00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.506 A:middle
the point immediately when they

00:12:05.506 --> 00:12:06.256 A:middle
touch the button.

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:07.716 A:middle
Not when they've touched down

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:08.446 A:middle
and then back up.

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:10.706 A:middle
I want to select the object that

00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:12.346 A:middle
I want to be associated with

00:12:12.346 --> 00:12:12.776 A:middle
this action.

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:14.866 A:middle
In this case, my good button or

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:15.556 A:middle
my unicorn.

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:17.466 A:middle
Then go back to my Inspector

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.186 A:middle
pane and click on this little

00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:20.976 A:middle
button with the circle with a

00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:22.296 A:middle
little arrow inside.

00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:23.936 A:middle
This is called our Connections

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:24.536 A:middle
Inspector.

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:26.506 A:middle
From here you'll see all the

00:12:26.506 --> 00:12:27.916 A:middle
different types of sent events

00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:29.166 A:middle
that I can create a connection

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:29.416 A:middle
for.

00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:31.766 A:middle
In this case, I want to create a

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.306 A:middle
connection for the touch-down

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:34.046 A:middle
event.

00:12:34.616 --> 00:12:36.236 A:middle
I'll click inside this open

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:38.836 A:middle
circle, and drag over to the

00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:40.166 A:middle
action method that I want to be

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.796 A:middle
associated with this event.

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.566 A:middle
And let go.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:45.276 A:middle
I'll do the same thing with my

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:45.996 A:middle
bad button.

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:49.656 A:middle
Touch-down, click, and drag over

00:12:49.656 --> 00:12:52.176 A:middle
to bad pressed and let go.

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:52.786 A:middle
Okay, great.

00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:54.606 A:middle
Just two more things that we

00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:55.996 A:middle
want to do before we can build

00:12:55.996 --> 00:12:57.136 A:middle
and run our app for the very

00:12:57.136 --> 00:12:57.836 A:middle
first time.

00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:00.146 A:middle
The next thing we want to do is


00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:00.146 A:middle
The next thing we want to do is

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
we want to do a little bit of

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:02.316 A:middle
set-up for our app.

00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:04.076 A:middle
And we can do this in a method

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:04.966 A:middle
called viewDidLoad.

00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:07.486 A:middle
And a viewDidLoad is created for

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.126 A:middle
a view controller at the very

00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:10.206 A:middle
beginning automatically.

00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:12.496 A:middle
And in here, what I want to do

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:13.316 A:middle
is a bit of setup.

00:13:13.646 --> 00:13:15.776 A:middle
In this case, I want to hide

00:13:15.816 --> 00:13:16.496 A:middle
some things.

00:13:16.816 --> 00:13:18.116 A:middle
The first thing I want to hide

00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:19.166 A:middle
is that points label.

00:13:19.306 --> 00:13:21.006 A:middle
I don't want that on the screen

00:13:21.106 --> 00:13:22.386 A:middle
the very beginning of our game.

00:13:23.346 --> 00:13:25.766 A:middle
So I'll just type points label

00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:27.716 A:middle
dot-- hmm.

00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:29.086 A:middle
How about hide?

00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:32.086 A:middle
Oh look? Looks like there's a

00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:33.616 A:middle
property called isHidden.

00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:35.286 A:middle
And if I hit enter, it'll

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:37.106 A:middle
autocomplete into Xcode for me.

00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:40.036 A:middle
To see what isHidden does, I can

00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:41.376 A:middle
hold down the option key on my

00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:43.736 A:middle
keyboard, hover over isHidden

00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:45.226 A:middle
and click.

00:13:45.446 --> 00:13:46.916 A:middle
When I do this, I can read a bit

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:48.746 A:middle
more about what isHidden is, and

00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:49.506 A:middle
what I can do with it.

00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:51.576 A:middle
In this case, I see that it's

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:52.886 A:middle
both a getter and a setter.

00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.116 A:middle
Which means that I can set

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.596 A:middle
isHidden equal to true, and it

00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:57.976 A:middle
should hide my points label at

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:00.646 A:middle
the very beginning of my game.


00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:00.646 A:middle
the very beginning of my game.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:03.126 A:middle
Now I also need some variables

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.416 A:middle
to keep track of my gameplay

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:05.046 A:middle
over time.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:06.626 A:middle
And I've already written these,

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.126 A:middle
so I'll quickly add them using a

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:08.606 A:middle
shortcut.

00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:12.466 A:middle
One of them needs to be, it's

00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:13.736 A:middle
already initialized, but I

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.176 A:middle
actually need to populate it

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:15.706 A:middle
with some data.

00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:17.746 A:middle
And that's this game buttons

00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:18.146 A:middle
list.

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:19.926 A:middle
Now you're thinking to yourself,

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.716 A:middle
"Jessie, if we only have a

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:23.326 A:middle
unicorn and a poop, why would we

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:25.086 A:middle
need to create a whole array of

00:14:25.086 --> 00:14:25.546 A:middle
buttons?"

00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:27.826 A:middle
Well, in our case we want to

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.426 A:middle
make our code more extensible

00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:30.956 A:middle
which means make it easier to

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:32.036 A:middle
build on over time.

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:34.056 A:middle
Because in the future, we may

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:35.186 A:middle
have more than just the unicorn

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:35.916 A:middle
and the poop.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.266 A:middle
We may have a thumbs-up emoji.

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:39.306 A:middle
We may have a frowny-face emoji.

00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.556 A:middle
So in this case, we want to say

00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:47.436 A:middle
that game buttons equals list of

00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:50.256 A:middle
good button and bad button.

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:53.856 A:middle
Okay. I've also written some

00:14:53.856 --> 00:14:55.476 A:middle
helper methods that will help us

00:14:55.476 --> 00:14:56.316 A:middle
with our gameplay.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.266 A:middle
I'm going to add those now.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.866 A:middle
One of them is this method


00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.866 A:middle
One of them is this method

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.826 A:middle
called set up fresh game state.

00:15:03.476 --> 00:15:05.946 A:middle
You'll notice that it makes sure

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:06.666 A:middle
that the start game and

00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:08.556 A:middle
leaderboard button are unhidden.

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:09.346 A:middle
They're onscreen.

00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:11.946 A:middle
It hides my gameplay buttons,

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:13.876 A:middle
and it sets up some initial

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.666 A:middle
values for my points.

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:19.036 A:middle
So here in my viewDidLoad, I

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:21.116 A:middle
also want to call up set up

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:23.196 A:middle
fresh game state.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.126 A:middle
You'll notice here as I'm

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:27.756 A:middle
typing, Xcode is autocompleting

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:29.016 A:middle
all of the things that I could

00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:31.046 A:middle
possibly put as some code.

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:33.236 A:middle
In this case, if I hit enter

00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:34.646 A:middle
with set up fresh game state

00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
already highlighted, it'll

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:39.306 A:middle
automatically populate it for

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:39.543 A:middle
me.

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:41.606 A:middle
Okay. One last thing we want to

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.526 A:middle
do, and then we can build and

00:15:42.526 --> 00:15:43.066 A:middle
run our app.

00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:46.396 A:middle
Just for sanity, in my start

00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:48.366 A:middle
pressed method, action method,

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:49.376 A:middle
I'm going to put a print

00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
statement here.

00:15:51.176 --> 00:15:53.496 A:middle
And say start game button was

00:15:53.496 --> 00:15:53.686 A:middle
pressed.

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.706 A:middle
And I expect that every time I

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
press that start-game button,

00:15:58.426 --> 00:15:59.746 A:middle
this line of code will be logged

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:00.466 A:middle
to my console.


00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:00.466 A:middle
to my console.

00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:03.666 A:middle
I can show my debug area by

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:05.466 A:middle
opening up this middle button

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:07.146 A:middle
here with the line on the bottom

00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
of the square.

00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:09.936 A:middle
I'm going to hide my Inspector

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:10.266 A:middle
pane.

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:11.126 A:middle
I don't need that anymore.

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.816 A:middle
Okay. It's finally time.

00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:15.426 A:middle
We can build and run our app.

00:16:15.956 --> 00:16:17.036 A:middle
Now in the upper left-hand

00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:18.676 A:middle
corner, you'll notice that my

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.206 A:middle
app name, Disappearing Unicorns,

00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:21.876 A:middle
with a little arrow to an iPhone

00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:22.176 A:middle
10.

00:16:22.756 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
If I click on iPhone 10, I can

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:26.276 A:middle
see all the different simulators

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:27.456 A:middle
that I can run my app on.

00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:30.046 A:middle
Now a simulator is a simulation

00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:31.526 A:middle
of a device on my Mac.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:33.686 A:middle
And in this case, I want to

00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:34.676 A:middle
select iPhone 10.

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:37.016 A:middle
Now if I had plugged my phone

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:39.036 A:middle
into my computer, I could also

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:40.646 A:middle
build and run my app on my own

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.236 A:middle
device which is pretty cool.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:45.396 A:middle
So with iPhone 10 selected, I

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.456 A:middle
can click this play button here.

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.996 A:middle
This will build and run my app

00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:50.026 A:middle
in my simulator.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
Here we go.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566 A:middle
Oh, nice! Okay, so when I press


00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566 A:middle
Oh, nice! Okay, so when I press

00:17:00.566 --> 00:17:02.196 A:middle
this start-game button, I should

00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:04.406 A:middle
see that the start-game button

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:05.566 A:middle
was pressed is logged in my

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.366 A:middle
console down here.

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:09.036 A:middle
Awesome! We've just created a

00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:10.476 A:middle
UI, and we've connected it to

00:17:10.476 --> 00:17:10.925 A:middle
our code.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
Let's jump back over and start

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.296 A:middle
talking about the game logic for

00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:15.536 A:middle
our app.

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
Okay, so in the very beginning

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:21.506 A:middle
of our game, we know we have

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:23.316 A:middle
that start screen, and it has

00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:24.695 A:middle
two buttons on it.

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:25.986 A:middle
It has that start-game button

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:27.215 A:middle
and that leaderboard button.

00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:28.756 A:middle
But we're just talking about the

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:29.696 A:middle
gameplay right now.

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.436 A:middle
So we're going to wait for the

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:34.236 A:middle
start-game button pressed.

00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
And once that button is pressed,

00:17:35.806 --> 00:17:37.236 A:middle
we drop into playing mode.

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:39.266 A:middle
And at the beginning of playing

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:41.796 A:middle
mode, we get a random emoji in a

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.386 A:middle
random location on the screen.

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:45.216 A:middle
Either a unicorn or a poop.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.096 A:middle
At that point, we set a timer

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:50.396 A:middle
for one second to allow our user

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:52.176 A:middle
to have time to interact with

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:52.746 A:middle
our button.

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.476 A:middle
Now at the end of that one

00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.376 A:middle
second, if the user did not

00:17:57.626 --> 00:17:59.196 A:middle
press a unicorn, then the

00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
unicorn was lonely, and they


00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
unicorn was lonely, and they

00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:01.016 A:middle
lose.

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:04.466 A:middle
And if they successfully avoided

00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:06.126 A:middle
tapping a poop, then they get

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.966 A:middle
another round of the game.

00:18:08.456 --> 00:18:10.446 A:middle
Now we also want to say what

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:11.886 A:middle
happens if they actually do

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:13.116 A:middle
press one of the buttons during

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:13.496 A:middle
the game.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.066 A:middle
Well if they press the unicorn

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:18.206 A:middle
button, we give them another

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:19.436 A:middle
round of the game and give them

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:19.876 A:middle
a point.

00:18:20.486 --> 00:18:21.806 A:middle
Otherwise, if they accidentally

00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:24.316 A:middle
select the poop, then game over.

00:18:25.366 --> 00:18:26.736 A:middle
Okay. Let's talk about what this

00:18:26.736 --> 00:18:27.496 A:middle
code looks like.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:29.326 A:middle
We'll start off with the start

00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:29.786 A:middle
screen.

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
Now we're going to break up our

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.656 A:middle
code into logical blocks.

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:34.786 A:middle
And in our case, we're going to

00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:36.056 A:middle
use methods to do this.

00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:37.856 A:middle
So that it's not just one long

00:18:37.856 --> 00:18:39.376 A:middle
file full of lots of code.

00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:41.096 A:middle
And it's easier for us to look

00:18:41.096 --> 00:18:42.346 A:middle
at very specific parts.

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:44.706 A:middle
The first method we're going to

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.146 A:middle
write is called start new game

00:18:46.286 --> 00:18:48.006 A:middle
which we're going to call from

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:48.676 A:middle
start pressed.

00:18:49.266 --> 00:18:50.666 A:middle
This is going to do some setup

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.846 A:middle
for the beginning of a game

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
route.

00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.266 A:middle
The first thing that happens in

00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:58.726 A:middle
start new game is that we need

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
to hide that start-game button


00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
to hide that start-game button

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.336 A:middle
and hide that leaderboard

00:19:01.336 --> 00:19:01.746 A:middle
button.

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.206 A:middle
Then we need to update our

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:05.726 A:middle
points label and set it to zero.

00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:07.706 A:middle
And we can even do some cool

00:19:07.706 --> 00:19:09.576 A:middle
things here like dynamically

00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:11.666 A:middle
change the color of our points

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:13.016 A:middle
label throughout our code.

00:19:13.226 --> 00:19:14.576 A:middle
And here I'm going to set that

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:15.996 A:middle
text color to magenta during

00:19:16.046 --> 00:19:16.706 A:middle
active gameplay.

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.406 A:middle
Finally at the end of setting up

00:19:19.406 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
my start new game, I'm going to

00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:23.196 A:middle
call the first round of my game.

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:27.326 A:middle
Okay? Let's look at that.

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.196 A:middle
In our one-game round, we first

00:19:29.196 --> 00:19:30.706 A:middle
update our points label, make

00:19:30.706 --> 00:19:31.626 A:middle
sure that it's up to date.

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:34.116 A:middle
Then we display a random button.

00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:35.586 A:middle
Either that unicorn or that poop

00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:37.396 A:middle
in a random location on our

00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:37.816 A:middle
screen.

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:39.716 A:middle
I've written this helper method

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:41.046 A:middle
display random button that

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.376 A:middle
chooses a random x and y

00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:44.276 A:middle
coordinate to place our button.

00:19:45.406 --> 00:19:47.156 A:middle
Then we set a timer for one

00:19:47.156 --> 00:19:47.606 A:middle
second.

00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:51.026 A:middle
Now, if this timer goes off

00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:53.216 A:middle
after one second, then the code

00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:54.596 A:middle
inside the block of the timer

00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:55.306 A:middle
will get called.

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:58.226 A:middle
And in that case, we want to

00:19:58.226 --> 00:19:59.676 A:middle
check if the current button

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.486 A:middle
that's on screen is a unicorn,


00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.486 A:middle
that's on screen is a unicorn,

00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:03.216 A:middle
then the game is over.

00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:05.326 A:middle
Because the user left a lonely

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:07.716 A:middle
unicorn again.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.806 A:middle
Otherwise, if they successfully

00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:11.116 A:middle
avoided the poop and that's

00:20:11.116 --> 00:20:12.796 A:middle
still onscreen, they get another

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:13.616 A:middle
round of our game.

00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:15.826 A:middle
Now let's talk about what

00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:17.346 A:middle
happens if they did press one of

00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:18.026 A:middle
our buttons.

00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:19.636 A:middle
Well if they pressed the good

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:20.676 A:middle
button, we want to give them

00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:21.306 A:middle
another point.

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:24.726 A:middle
We actually want to cancel our

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:25.176 A:middle
timer.

00:20:25.176 --> 00:20:26.296 A:middle
And we're going to do this by

00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:27.716 A:middle
invalidating it so that it

00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
doesn't go off, and then we'll

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:32.936 A:middle
call another round of our game.

00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:34.176 A:middle
And if they press the bad

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:36.176 A:middle
button, well let's hide that

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:37.376 A:middle
button and get it out of the way

00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:38.586 A:middle
so that they can't interact with

00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:39.046 A:middle
it again.

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
We'll cancel the timer again by

00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:42.756 A:middle
calling invalidate on it.

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:45.736 A:middle
And then call game over which is

00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:46.686 A:middle
a helpful method that I've

00:20:46.686 --> 00:20:49.946 A:middle
written to help end the game.

00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:52.016 A:middle
Okay, let's add this game logic

00:20:52.016 --> 00:20:53.226 A:middle
into our game.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:57.936 A:middle
Going to go back over to our

00:20:58.036 --> 00:20:58.886 A:middle
Xcode project.

00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:01.896 A:middle
And in this case, I don't need


00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:01.896 A:middle
And in this case, I don't need

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.306 A:middle
my storyboard up anymore.

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.586 A:middle
I'm just going to be making

00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:05.816 A:middle
changes to my view controller.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.676 A:middle
So I can select here the

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:10.146 A:middle
standard editor, and then select

00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:11.156 A:middle
my view controller from my

00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:12.156 A:middle
Project Navigator.

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:15.046 A:middle
Now, we've already written our

00:21:15.126 --> 00:21:17.266 A:middle
code in our slides.

00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:19.086 A:middle
So I'm going to just quickly add

00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:21.206 A:middle
it into our view controller

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:22.216 A:middle
using some shortcuts.

00:21:22.506 --> 00:21:24.856 A:middle
So here we have start new game

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:26.716 A:middle
where we hide our start game and

00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:27.906 A:middle
our leaderboard button.

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:29.506 A:middle
Set up some initial stuff with

00:21:29.506 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
our game points, and then call

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:32.546 A:middle
one round of our game.

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:35.906 A:middle
Then we need our one-game round.

00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:39.386 A:middle
And here we update our points

00:21:39.386 --> 00:21:41.646 A:middle
label, display random button,

00:21:41.646 --> 00:21:42.576 A:middle
and call our timer.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:45.996 A:middle
And finally we need to put the

00:21:45.996 --> 00:21:47.766 A:middle
code and for the logic in our

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.766 A:middle
both our start pressed.

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:52.196 A:middle
And our good pressed.

00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:57.886 A:middle
And finally our bad pressed.

00:21:58.036 --> 00:21:59.966 A:middle
Okay. We have all the code we

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:00.256 A:middle
need.


00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:00.256 A:middle
need.

00:22:00.606 --> 00:22:03.156 A:middle
Let's see how it goes.

00:22:03.376 --> 00:22:04.416 A:middle
Here I'm going to click this

00:22:04.476 --> 00:22:05.936 A:middle
play button again to build and

00:22:05.936 --> 00:22:07.316 A:middle
run our app in the simulator.

00:22:09.506 --> 00:22:10.816 A:middle
Okay, I'm nervous.

00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
Let's go.

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:14.496 A:middle
Oh! Got one!

00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:16.486 A:middle
Where's another?

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:17.436 A:middle
There's a lot of poops.

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.086 A:middle
There we go.

00:22:20.336 --> 00:22:21.566 A:middle
Okay, I could seriously play

00:22:21.566 --> 00:22:23.096 A:middle
this all day, but I probably

00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:24.086 A:middle
should let [inaudible name] show

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:24.896 A:middle
you how to incorporate a

00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:25.416 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:27.356 A:middle
Whew! So I'm going to try and

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:27.976 A:middle
lose on purpose here.

00:22:29.226 --> 00:22:30.626 A:middle
Oh, there we go.

00:22:31.236 --> 00:22:33.396 A:middle
Okay. Wow, yeah.

00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:33.886 A:middle
That's great.

00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:37.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:39.426 A:middle
That was incredible!

00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:41.596 A:middle
We just made a game in less than

00:22:41.596 --> 00:22:42.326 A:middle
30 minutes.

00:22:42.846 --> 00:22:44.106 A:middle
Just think about what you could

00:22:44.106 --> 00:22:45.066 A:middle
do if you had more time.

00:22:46.266 --> 00:22:47.456 A:middle
So we first started out by

00:22:47.456 --> 00:22:48.986 A:middle
learning to navigate Xcode.

00:22:49.526 --> 00:22:52.116 A:middle
Then we created a simple UI

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:53.926 A:middle
using our storyboard and

00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:56.156 A:middle
connected that UI to our code.

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:58.556 A:middle
And finally we wrote game logic

00:22:58.616 --> 00:22:59.236 A:middle
using Swift.

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.106 A:middle
All in less than 30 minutes.


00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.106 A:middle
All in less than 30 minutes.

00:23:01.816 --> 00:23:03.676 A:middle
Now if we had more time, let's

00:23:03.676 --> 00:23:04.636 A:middle
think about some things that we

00:23:04.636 --> 00:23:05.836 A:middle
could do to take this further.

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.016 A:middle
Well we just used simple UI

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:09.196 A:middle
elements like buttons and

00:23:09.196 --> 00:23:09.666 A:middle
labels.

00:23:10.076 --> 00:23:11.246 A:middle
But you could use a framework

00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:13.796 A:middle
like SpriteKit to create more

00:23:14.156 --> 00:23:15.826 A:middle
imaginative buttons that have

00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:18.036 A:middle
elements like gravity or physics

00:23:18.036 --> 00:23:19.066 A:middle
associated with them.

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.476 A:middle
We could also add MusicKit

00:23:21.476 --> 00:23:23.046 A:middle
integration and have Apple music

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.306 A:middle
songs playing in the background

00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:25.396 A:middle
during active gameplay.

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:28.166 A:middle
Or we could read from sensors

00:23:28.466 --> 00:23:29.736 A:middle
and change the speed of our game

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:31.086 A:middle
based on the user's movement.

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:33.176 A:middle
Here are three talks from

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:35.066 A:middle
previous WWDCs that I highly

00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:36.146 A:middle
recommend you check out.

00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:38.246 A:middle
Introduction to SpriteKit from

00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:39.106 A:middle
2013.

00:23:39.546 --> 00:23:41.156 A:middle
Introducing MusicKit from last

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:41.446 A:middle
year.

00:23:41.596 --> 00:23:43.036 A:middle
And Creating Immersive Apps with

00:23:43.036 --> 00:23:44.236 A:middle
Core Motion from last year as

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:44.476 A:middle
well.

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:46.226 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:46.966 A:middle
I'm going to welcome [inaudible

00:23:47.006 --> 00:23:48.506 A:middle
name] on the stage to show you

00:23:48.506 --> 00:23:50.456 A:middle
how to add additional screens to

00:23:50.456 --> 00:23:50.706 A:middle
your app.

00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:57.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]


00:24:06.086 --> 00:24:07.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:09.306 A:middle
I hope you've enjoyed building

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:10.466 A:middle
the game with poops and

00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:11.126 A:middle
unicorns.

00:24:12.706 --> 00:24:13.886 A:middle
My name is [inaudible name] and

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.856 A:middle
I'm here to help you add some

00:24:16.986 --> 00:24:18.786 A:middle
awesome features to your apps.

00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:22.156 A:middle
Along the way we'll learn about

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:24.816 A:middle
APIs and frameworks that are

00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:26.766 A:middle
commonly used across iOS.

00:24:28.456 --> 00:24:30.536 A:middle
First, let's take a look at the

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:32.476 A:middle
features we want to add to our

00:24:32.476 --> 00:24:32.946 A:middle
game.

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.986 A:middle
We would like to introduce a

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:38.306 A:middle
leaderboard where we can see

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:40.376 A:middle
names and the points for each

00:24:40.376 --> 00:24:42.206 A:middle
person who's played our game.

00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:46.206 A:middle
When we tap on a name, we want

00:24:46.206 --> 00:24:48.236 A:middle
to see more information about

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.006 A:middle
that person.

00:24:49.536 --> 00:24:53.646 A:middle
As we build our app today, we'll

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.626 A:middle
focus on three main areas.

00:24:56.906 --> 00:24:58.416 A:middle
One is the data.

00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
Where should we store


00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
Where should we store

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.126 A:middle
information about our users?

00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:04.466 A:middle
How do we retrieve this data?

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.006 A:middle
Second is the user interface.

00:25:08.936 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
What does the leaderboard look

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:10.626 A:middle
like?

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.056 A:middle
What use should it have?

00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
And finally, we'll talk about

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:17.936 A:middle
the logic that's used for

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.786 A:middle
managing [inaudible] for passing

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:21.936 A:middle
data, and for doing other tasks

00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:22.756 A:middle
within our apps.

00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:26.826 A:middle
If we break down our app into

00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:29.326 A:middle
these three categories, then we

00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:31.286 A:middle
would actually end up following

00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:33.526 A:middle
a really popular architectural

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.636 A:middle
pattern known as the

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:37.046 A:middle
model-view-controller.

00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:40.596 A:middle
The model-view-controller

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:43.976 A:middle
represents the data in the

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:44.696 A:middle
model.

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.276 A:middle
The UI is represented as the

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:48.856 A:middle
view.

00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:52.286 A:middle
And the controller is the logic

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:55.056 A:middle
that communicates with both the

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:56.606 A:middle
model and the view.

00:25:57.146 --> 00:26:00.346 A:middle
This pattern helps us group


00:25:57.146 --> 00:26:00.346 A:middle
This pattern helps us group

00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
together similar tasks.

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.706 A:middle
And it makes it easy for us to

00:26:04.706 --> 00:26:06.976 A:middle
make changes to one part of our

00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:08.656 A:middle
app without impacting the

00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:09.126 A:middle
others.

00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:14.286 A:middle
In iOS, the controller can be

00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:16.676 A:middle
represented as a subclass of the

00:26:16.676 --> 00:26:18.086 A:middle
UI-view-controller class.

00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:22.656 A:middle
The view can be a subclass of

00:26:22.656 --> 00:26:23.766 A:middle
the UI view class.

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:29.326 A:middle
And the model can be a subclass

00:26:29.866 --> 00:26:30.936 A:middle
of NSobject.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:33.026 A:middle
When we build our app today, we

00:26:33.356 --> 00:26:35.236 A:middle
will take a closer look at the

00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:36.786 A:middle
different parts of the

00:26:36.786 --> 00:26:38.006 A:middle
model-view-controller.

00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:41.196 A:middle
Let's now jump into a demo and

00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:43.876 A:middle
build a model to store our data.

00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:48.206 A:middle
Here's the Disappearing Unicorns

00:26:48.276 --> 00:26:49.506 A:middle
project that we made with

00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:49.976 A:middle
Jessie.

00:26:51.396 --> 00:26:52.906 A:middle
Let me right click on the

00:26:52.906 --> 00:26:55.426 A:middle
Disappearing Unicorns folder and

00:26:55.426 --> 00:26:56.376 A:middle
say new file.

00:26:57.846 --> 00:26:59.186 A:middle
Select [inaudible] class which


00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:02.426 A:middle
is what most iOS classes are.

00:27:03.486 --> 00:27:05.906 A:middle
I'll click next, and I'll pull

00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:07.646 A:middle
my [inaudible] class data.

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:11.966 A:middle
This will be a subclass of

00:27:11.966 --> 00:27:14.236 A:middle
NSobject which is a good parent

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:15.406 A:middle
class for my data.

00:27:16.526 --> 00:27:19.086 A:middle
Let's hit next and create.

00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:23.636 A:middle
In this class, we want to store

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:25.336 A:middle
information about the player.

00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:28.236 A:middle
So let me use a shortcut to add

00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:29.926 A:middle
some code I wrote before.

00:27:30.556 --> 00:27:33.916 A:middle
We have variables to store the

00:27:33.916 --> 00:27:36.836 A:middle
name, points, rank, and image

00:27:37.126 --> 00:27:38.006 A:middle
for each person.

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:41.596 A:middle
In addition to this, I've added

00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:43.626 A:middle
some initializers to set up this

00:27:43.656 --> 00:27:43.906 A:middle
data.

00:27:44.716 --> 00:27:46.026 A:middle
But we don't need to worry about

00:27:46.026 --> 00:27:46.406 A:middle
those.

00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:49.496 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add one more

00:27:49.496 --> 00:27:51.626 A:middle
class by right-clicking on the

00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:53.586 A:middle
folder again and going to add

00:27:53.946 --> 00:27:54.366 A:middle
files.

00:27:55.046 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
This is the game data class that

00:27:58.216 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
I've written already.


00:28:02.136 --> 00:28:04.306 A:middle
Let's take a look at the methods

00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:05.846 A:middle
that have been implemented in

00:28:05.846 --> 00:28:06.246 A:middle
this class.

00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:13.056 A:middle
First, we have the save points

00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:14.156 A:middle
for name method.

00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:17.876 A:middle
This is used to save the total

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:20.366 A:middle
game score for any given person.

00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.926 A:middle
Next we have the player data for

00:28:23.926 --> 00:28:26.406 A:middle
rank method which will give us

00:28:26.436 --> 00:28:28.616 A:middle
all the information about a

00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:30.986 A:middle
given player at a certain rank.

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:34.406 A:middle
And finally, we have a property

00:28:34.766 --> 00:28:36.536 A:middle
to figure out the total number

00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:38.396 A:middle
of people who played our game.

00:28:39.616 --> 00:28:40.996 A:middle
We will not look at the

00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:42.876 A:middle
implementation details for these

00:28:42.876 --> 00:28:43.786 A:middle
methods today.

00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:45.996 A:middle
What's important is to

00:28:45.996 --> 00:28:48.316 A:middle
understand that we created a

00:28:48.316 --> 00:28:50.896 A:middle
separate set of files to hold

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:51.336 A:middle
our data.

00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:55.146 A:middle
When you build your own apps, I

00:28:55.146 --> 00:28:56.616 A:middle
would encourage you to think

00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:59.226 A:middle
about your data as a separate

00:28:59.226 --> 00:29:01.706 A:middle
entity and keep it independent


00:28:59.226 --> 00:29:01.706 A:middle
entity and keep it independent

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
of the user interface.

00:29:03.656 --> 00:29:05.776 A:middle
Just like how we've done here.

00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:08.816 A:middle
When it comes to actually saving

00:29:08.816 --> 00:29:10.306 A:middle
and retrieving the data on the

00:29:10.306 --> 00:29:13.266 A:middle
back end, we have a few

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.276 A:middle
different options.

00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:18.146 A:middle
One is to use core data.

00:29:18.146 --> 00:29:21.536 A:middle
Core data is great for managing

00:29:21.906 --> 00:29:23.136 A:middle
objects on the disc.

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.056 A:middle
It provides you with solutions

00:29:26.686 --> 00:29:29.046 A:middle
to validate, query, filter, and

00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:30.506 A:middle
organize your objects.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.756 A:middle
If however your data is on a web

00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:36.936 A:middle
server somewhere, then you could

00:29:36.936 --> 00:29:40.106 A:middle
use NSURLSessions to download

00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:42.706 A:middle
and upload the data.

00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:44.936 A:middle
Another great option is to use

00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:47.226 A:middle
CloudKit for storing data on the

00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:47.696 A:middle
cloud.

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:50.686 A:middle
You could even use a third-party

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:52.656 A:middle
cloud provider to manage your

00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:53.336 A:middle
cloud data.

00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:55.476 A:middle
Now that we've set up our data,

00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:58.666 A:middle
let's move onto the next section

00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:00.396 A:middle
where we build our user


00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:00.396 A:middle
where we build our user

00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:00.956 A:middle
interface.

00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:03.856 A:middle
Here's what we want our

00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:05.116 A:middle
leaderboard to look like.

00:30:06.476 --> 00:30:08.276 A:middle
I'll break this down into the

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:09.936 A:middle
different viewers on the screen.

00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:13.766 A:middle
On the top we have a navigation

00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:14.056 A:middle
bar.

00:30:15.306 --> 00:30:18.846 A:middle
Below that is a table view which

00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:20.896 A:middle
has rows which are known as

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.226 A:middle
table view cells.

00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:26.376 A:middle
Within each cell, we have an

00:30:26.456 --> 00:30:29.266 A:middle
image view on the left, and some

00:30:29.266 --> 00:30:31.706 A:middle
labels on the right to display

00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:31.966 A:middle
text.

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:36.006 A:middle
Besides the leaderboard, we also

00:30:36.006 --> 00:30:37.786 A:middle
need to set up the details page.

00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:39.766 A:middle
This one's pretty

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:40.656 A:middle
straightforward.

00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:43.316 A:middle
It has an image view and some

00:30:43.316 --> 00:30:43.846 A:middle
labels.

00:30:45.366 --> 00:30:47.376 A:middle
So now that we know what views

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
our UI is made up of, let's go

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:52.196 A:middle
back into another demo and

00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:54.016 A:middle
actually set up this user

00:30:54.016 --> 00:30:54.586 A:middle
interface.


00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.726 A:middle
I'll select the main storyboard

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:06.966 A:middle
which we built with Jesse.

00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:08.006 A:middle
Here we have a

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:10.626 A:middle
single-view-controller which was

00:31:10.626 --> 00:31:12.766 A:middle
used to manage the entire screen

00:31:12.766 --> 00:31:14.156 A:middle
of content for the game.

00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:17.706 A:middle
Now we want to add more screens

00:31:18.386 --> 00:31:20.506 A:middle
for displaying our leaderboard

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:21.586 A:middle
in the details view.

00:31:22.656 --> 00:31:25.236 A:middle
To do this, we can add another

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:27.066 A:middle
view controller from the object

00:31:27.066 --> 00:31:27.646 A:middle
library.

00:31:28.426 --> 00:31:29.986 A:middle
I'll search for view controller.

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:32.666 A:middle
Notice that there are a few

00:31:32.666 --> 00:31:34.026 A:middle
different options for view

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:34.716 A:middle
controllers.

00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:37.356 A:middle
Since I want my leaderboard to

00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:39.416 A:middle
look more like a table, I'll

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:41.296 A:middle
select the table-view-controller

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.516 A:middle
and bring it into my storyboard.

00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:47.626 A:middle
The table-view-controller

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.756 A:middle
automatically has a table view.

00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:53.196 A:middle
Let's select the table view and

00:31:53.196 --> 00:31:56.166 A:middle
look at the Attributes Inspector

00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:56.816 A:middle
on the right.

00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
The content type here is set to


00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
The content type here is set to

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:02.316 A:middle
dynamic prototypes.

00:32:03.206 --> 00:32:04.836 A:middle
I'll change this to static

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:05.296 A:middle
cells.

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:08.216 A:middle
Static cells are great for

00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:09.656 A:middle
displaying static data.

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:12.316 A:middle
And these can be easily set up

00:32:12.466 --> 00:32:13.416 A:middle
in the storyboard.

00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:17.146 A:middle
Now let's select a single cell

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:19.516 A:middle
and change its style from the

00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:21.186 A:middle
Attributes Inspector to

00:32:21.246 --> 00:32:21.966 A:middle
subtitle.

00:32:23.456 --> 00:32:25.126 A:middle
This gives me a title and a

00:32:25.126 --> 00:32:27.386 A:middle
subtitle where I can display the

00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:28.876 A:middle
name and the points on my

00:32:28.876 --> 00:32:29.486 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:33.426 A:middle
I also want to add an image to

00:32:33.426 --> 00:32:34.496 A:middle
the left of the row.

00:32:35.476 --> 00:32:38.136 A:middle
To do this, I can simply type in

00:32:38.136 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
the name of an image in the

00:32:39.986 --> 00:32:42.086 A:middle
Attributes Inspector's image

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:42.736 A:middle
field here.

00:32:43.856 --> 00:32:46.776 A:middle
I have imported an image in my

00:32:46.846 --> 00:32:48.686 A:middle
project just as a sample.

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:51.306 A:middle
Let me add that.

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:55.666 A:middle
Okay. So now my cell is all set

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:57.776 A:middle
up and we have a good outline

00:32:57.776 --> 00:32:58.716 A:middle
for our leaderboard.

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add the


00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add the

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.066 A:middle
details UI.

00:33:02.066 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
I'll go back into the object

00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:07.686 A:middle
library, and this time we'll

00:33:07.686 --> 00:33:10.176 A:middle
take a blank view controller and

00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:11.896 A:middle
bring it into the storyboard.

00:33:14.236 --> 00:33:16.876 A:middle
Inside this view controller, we

00:33:16.876 --> 00:33:18.526 A:middle
will add an image view.

00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:24.036 A:middle
Let me set the image from the

00:33:24.036 --> 00:33:25.366 A:middle
Attributes Inspector.

00:33:27.076 --> 00:33:27.786 A:middle
Wait a minute.

00:33:27.786 --> 00:33:29.676 A:middle
This is a little scaled.

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:32.676 A:middle
Let me change the content mode

00:33:32.676 --> 00:33:36.016 A:middle
from scale to aspect fit.

00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:36.656 A:middle
Much better.

00:33:37.796 --> 00:33:39.376 A:middle
Now I'll go back to the object

00:33:39.376 --> 00:33:40.976 A:middle
library and add some labels.

00:33:44.046 --> 00:33:45.356 A:middle
These are going to be used for

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.456 A:middle
storing the name.

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:48.186 A:middle
I'll make a copy.

00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:51.516 A:middle
Next one is for the rank, and

00:33:51.606 --> 00:33:53.146 A:middle
finally another label.

00:33:53.846 --> 00:33:54.716 A:middle
Going to make a copy.

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:56.256 A:middle
Another label for the points.

00:33:57.496 --> 00:34:00.186 A:middle
Okay. Now that both our view


00:33:57.496 --> 00:34:00.186 A:middle
Okay. Now that both our view

00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:02.496 A:middle
controllers are set up, there's

00:34:02.496 --> 00:34:03.586 A:middle
one other thing to do.

00:34:03.586 --> 00:34:06.756 A:middle
We need to tell our app to

00:34:06.756 --> 00:34:08.335 A:middle
actually display this

00:34:08.335 --> 00:34:10.466 A:middle
leaderboard or the details view

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.335 A:middle
after we do a certain action in

00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:13.545 A:middle
the app.

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:17.076 A:middle
Since we want the leaderboard to

00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:19.376 A:middle
be displayed after we tap the

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:20.696 A:middle
leaderboard button.

00:34:20.896 --> 00:34:23.356 A:middle
I'll create a connection between

00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:25.065 A:middle
the leaderboard button and this

00:34:25.106 --> 00:34:26.176 A:middle
table-view-controller.

00:34:27.286 --> 00:34:29.045 A:middle
Let's hold down the control key

00:34:29.045 --> 00:34:31.036 A:middle
on the keyboard, and drag the

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.466 A:middle
mouse from the leaderboard

00:34:32.466 --> 00:34:33.246 A:middle
button to the

00:34:33.246 --> 00:34:34.376 A:middle
table-view-controller.

00:34:34.916 --> 00:34:38.235 A:middle
When I release, I see a menu

00:34:38.235 --> 00:34:40.235 A:middle
with a few different options.

00:34:40.755 --> 00:34:43.376 A:middle
These are the different ways in

00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:45.496 A:middle
which we can present the second

00:34:45.496 --> 00:34:47.476 A:middle
view controller on top of the

00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:48.116 A:middle
first one.

00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.196 A:middle
For now, I'll select the show

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:53.866 A:middle
option which is a commonly used

00:34:53.936 --> 00:34:55.106 A:middle
segue for such apps.

00:34:56.716 --> 00:34:58.856 A:middle
Notice that a connection got

00:34:58.986 --> 00:35:00.856 A:middle
created between the two view


00:34:58.986 --> 00:35:00.856 A:middle
created between the two view

00:35:00.856 --> 00:35:01.526 A:middle
controllers.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:04.726 A:middle
This is known as a segue.

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.946 A:middle
Now, I want to display the

00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:09.626 A:middle
details-view-controller when I

00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:11.646 A:middle
tap on the cell in the

00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:12.256 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:14.306 A:middle
So let's again hold down the

00:35:14.306 --> 00:35:16.346 A:middle
control key and drag our mouse

00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:18.556 A:middle
to the details-view-controller.

00:35:18.946 --> 00:35:21.126 A:middle
Select show one more time.

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:24.486 A:middle
Now we are ready to run our app

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:25.706 A:middle
for the very first time.

00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.276 A:middle
Let's look at the simulator.

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:35.356 A:middle
If I tap the leaderboard, I see

00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:37.486 A:middle
a good mock-up for my

00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:38.156 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:41.306 A:middle
I can tap on the cell and we

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:43.896 A:middle
have our details view with more

00:35:43.896 --> 00:35:44.706 A:middle
information.

00:35:45.336 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
This is looking good.

00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:50.306 A:middle
But how do I go back to my

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.906 A:middle
leaderboard or the game?

00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:54.756 A:middle
Let's go ahead and fix that.

00:35:56.076 --> 00:35:58.926 A:middle
To do this, I'll select the main

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
view controller which had the


00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
view controller which had the

00:36:01.036 --> 00:36:01.556 A:middle
game.

00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:04.206 A:middle
And then go to the editor menu

00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:07.186 A:middle
in Xcode, select, embed in,

00:36:07.526 --> 00:36:08.906 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:12.676 A:middle
This adds a navigation

00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:13.796 A:middle
controller to our app.

00:36:14.536 --> 00:36:16.816 A:middle
The navigation controller is a

00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:18.776 A:middle
special type of view controller

00:36:19.216 --> 00:36:21.266 A:middle
that is used for managing the

00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:22.956 A:middle
back and forth transitions

00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.736 A:middle
between our view controllers.

00:36:26.066 --> 00:36:29.046 A:middle
This also adds a navigation bar

00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:30.466 A:middle
at the top of our view

00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:31.146 A:middle
controllers.

00:36:31.146 --> 00:36:33.256 A:middle
So from the Attributes

00:36:33.256 --> 00:36:36.226 A:middle
Inspector, if I set a title to--

00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:38.856 A:middle
for my leaderboard, it will now

00:36:38.856 --> 00:36:41.556 A:middle
show up in the navigation bar.

00:36:42.936 --> 00:36:44.966 A:middle
Now that we've added all the

00:36:44.966 --> 00:36:46.586 A:middle
viewers that we needed to add

00:36:46.686 --> 00:36:47.396 A:middle
for our UI.

00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:50.616 A:middle
Let me finish this up with

00:36:50.616 --> 00:36:53.066 A:middle
adding an app icon to this app.

00:36:54.376 --> 00:36:55.656 A:middle
Let's go into our project

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:56.426 A:middle
navigator.

00:36:57.156 --> 00:36:59.276 A:middle
Select the blue folder that says

00:36:59.556 --> 00:36:59.876 A:middle
assets.


00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:03.036 A:middle
And go to the app icon image

00:37:03.156 --> 00:37:03.366 A:middle
set.

00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:06.956 A:middle
Now I have some icons that my

00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:08.016 A:middle
designer created.

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:11.446 A:middle
I'll select these and drop them

00:37:11.546 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
into Xcode.

00:37:14.656 --> 00:37:16.756 A:middle
There's a specific way in which

00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:18.436 A:middle
you need to create these icons.

00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:20.116 A:middle
And we have guidelines on

00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:21.766 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:25.676 A:middle
This time when we run our app,

00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:28.296 A:middle
I'll close this-- we will see an

00:37:28.296 --> 00:37:30.976 A:middle
icon on the home screen.

00:37:31.646 --> 00:37:32.406 A:middle
Isn't it cute?

00:37:33.516 --> 00:37:36.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:36.596 --> 00:37:36.856 A:middle
Thank you.

00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:39.166 A:middle
Let's go back into the app.

00:37:40.586 --> 00:37:42.126 A:middle
And tap on the leaderboard.

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:45.936 A:middle
This time we're able to go back

00:37:45.936 --> 00:37:47.826 A:middle
and forth between all our views.

00:37:47.826 --> 00:37:49.386 A:middle
This is great!

00:37:50.356 --> 00:37:50.926 A:middle
Let's now-

00:37:51.016 --> 00:37:52.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:52.286 --> 00:37:53.546 A:middle
I'm glad you like that.

00:37:54.656 --> 00:37:56.686 A:middle
Let's now rotate our phone and

00:37:56.746 --> 00:37:57.726 A:middle
see what happens.

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:01.206 A:middle
Oh no. My labels are all


00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:01.206 A:middle
Oh no. My labels are all

00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:03.746 A:middle
clipped, and my image is too far

00:38:03.746 --> 00:38:04.266 A:middle
to the left.

00:38:04.956 --> 00:38:07.256 A:middle
In order to make my layout look

00:38:07.256 --> 00:38:08.976 A:middle
right-- let's put that back.

00:38:10.076 --> 00:38:12.196 A:middle
I'll use a technique known as

00:38:12.316 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
Auto Layout.

00:38:14.616 --> 00:38:16.536 A:middle
Auto Layout is a set of rules

00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:19.706 A:middle
that we define to tell our app

00:38:19.706 --> 00:38:21.846 A:middle
how we want our views to be

00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:22.216 A:middle
placed.

00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:26.846 A:middle
So each rule in Auto Layout is

00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:28.366 A:middle
known as a constraint.

00:38:29.386 --> 00:38:31.336 A:middle
Now we'll add some constraints

00:38:31.856 --> 00:38:33.316 A:middle
to this image view in our

00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:34.696 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:37.606 A:middle
Look at the buttons at the

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:40.156 A:middle
bottom right of the storyboard.

00:38:41.356 --> 00:38:43.506 A:middle
We'll click on the align button,

00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:45.756 A:middle
the one with two horizontal bars

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.356 A:middle
and say horizontally in

00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:48.876 A:middle
container.

00:38:48.876 --> 00:38:51.026 A:middle
Add one constraint.

00:38:51.026 --> 00:38:54.346 A:middle
This tells our app that we want

00:38:54.346 --> 00:38:56.546 A:middle
our image view to always be in

00:38:56.546 --> 00:38:57.926 A:middle
the horizontal center.

00:38:58.656 --> 00:39:01.146 A:middle
I'll also click on the button to


00:38:58.656 --> 00:39:01.146 A:middle
I'll also click on the button to

00:39:01.146 --> 00:39:03.306 A:middle
the next of this align button

00:39:03.446 --> 00:39:04.996 A:middle
called add new constraints.

00:39:05.736 --> 00:39:08.926 A:middle
The top-most text box here

00:39:09.256 --> 00:39:11.926 A:middle
represents the distance between

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:14.586 A:middle
my image view and its closest

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:15.516 A:middle
neighbor on the top.

00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:19.086 A:middle
So if I set this value, it will

00:39:19.086 --> 00:39:21.516 A:middle
make sure that my image is at

00:39:21.516 --> 00:39:23.566 A:middle
least, that my image is like ten

00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:26.456 A:middle
points away from the nearest

00:39:26.456 --> 00:39:27.366 A:middle
neighbor on the top.

00:39:27.566 --> 00:39:28.696 A:middle
Which could be the edge of the

00:39:28.696 --> 00:39:29.456 A:middle
screen too.

00:39:30.556 --> 00:39:32.446 A:middle
Let's also set the width and the

00:39:32.446 --> 00:39:32.876 A:middle
height.

00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:41.826 A:middle
Now our image view is all set to

00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.026 A:middle
use Auto Layout.

00:39:43.876 --> 00:39:45.396 A:middle
I'll quickly add similar

00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:47.226 A:middle
constraints to all the labels.

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:49.736 A:middle
We can do this in one go by

00:39:49.736 --> 00:39:51.386 A:middle
selecting them altogether.

00:39:54.996 --> 00:39:58.326 A:middle
This time, if we run our app and

00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:00.336 A:middle
rotate it, we should be able to


00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:00.336 A:middle
rotate it, we should be able to

00:40:00.446 --> 00:40:02.976 A:middle
see our view laid out properly.

00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:05.936 A:middle
There's an even easier way to

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.166 A:middle
validate our layout.

00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:09.516 A:middle
We can go to the Device

00:40:09.606 --> 00:40:11.786 A:middle
Configuration pane at the bottom

00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:13.126 A:middle
left of the storyboard.

00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:16.526 A:middle
And change the orientation here

00:40:16.676 --> 00:40:18.066 A:middle
to landscape.

00:40:18.796 --> 00:40:21.836 A:middle
Now I can see my view in the

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:23.276 A:middle
landscape orientation.

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:25.436 A:middle
And my image is looking, my

00:40:25.436 --> 00:40:27.796 A:middle
image is in the center, and my

00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:30.436 A:middle
labels are all seen on the same

00:40:30.436 --> 00:40:30.976 A:middle
page.

00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:34.086 A:middle
You could even change the device

00:40:34.126 --> 00:40:36.056 A:middle
from the Device Configuration

00:40:36.056 --> 00:40:38.476 A:middle
pane to see how this would look

00:40:38.716 --> 00:40:40.966 A:middle
on an iPad or a smaller phone.

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:46.486 A:middle
With that, a UI is all set up.

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:48.866 A:middle
Let's quickly recap what we

00:40:48.866 --> 00:40:50.336 A:middle
learned in this session,

00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:51.056 A:middle
section.

00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:55.006 A:middle
We started with a

00:40:55.006 --> 00:40:57.596 A:middle
single-view-controller which had

00:40:57.816 --> 00:40:59.426 A:middle
the-- which managed the entire

00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:00.636 A:middle
screen for our game.


00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:00.636 A:middle
screen for our game.

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.406 A:middle
We learned that we can create

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:05.846 A:middle
multiple view controllers to

00:41:05.846 --> 00:41:07.716 A:middle
display multiple screens of

00:41:07.776 --> 00:41:08.426 A:middle
content.

00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:11.846 A:middle
If we do create multiple screens

00:41:11.846 --> 00:41:16.016 A:middle
of content, then we need to tell

00:41:16.506 --> 00:41:18.596 A:middle
iOS how to go from one view

00:41:18.596 --> 00:41:19.946 A:middle
controller to another.

00:41:20.976 --> 00:41:23.486 A:middle
We do this by adding connections

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.506 A:middle
that are known as segues.

00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:28.046 A:middle
We created a

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.506 A:middle
table-view-controller which is

00:41:30.006 --> 00:41:32.316 A:middle
great for displaying lists of

00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:32.596 A:middle
data.

00:41:34.186 --> 00:41:36.236 A:middle
We also added it inside a

00:41:36.236 --> 00:41:37.696 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:40.776 A:middle
The navigation controller helped

00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:42.636 A:middle
us go back and forth between the

00:41:42.636 --> 00:41:45.826 A:middle
table view and the details page.

00:41:46.966 --> 00:41:49.386 A:middle
This pattern of using a table

00:41:49.386 --> 00:41:51.016 A:middle
view along with the navigation

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:53.286 A:middle
controller is commonly seen

00:41:53.396 --> 00:41:54.586 A:middle
across iOS apps.

00:41:55.756 --> 00:41:56.966 A:middle
Here are just some examples.

00:41:59.676 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
To learn more about view


00:41:59.676 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
To learn more about view

00:42:01.086 --> 00:42:02.866 A:middle
controllers, check out the

00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:04.186 A:middle
documentation on

00:42:04.186 --> 00:42:05.846 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:42:07.186 --> 00:42:08.856 A:middle
We also learned about Auto

00:42:08.856 --> 00:42:10.636 A:middle
Layout which is a great

00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:12.726 A:middle
technique for building good user

00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:15.096 A:middle
interfaces for different screen

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:16.346 A:middle
sizes and different

00:42:16.346 --> 00:42:17.236 A:middle
orientations.

00:42:18.016 --> 00:42:19.586 A:middle
I would recommend checking out

00:42:19.586 --> 00:42:22.076 A:middle
these WWDC sessions to learn

00:42:22.076 --> 00:42:23.516 A:middle
more about Auto Layout.

00:42:25.146 --> 00:42:28.686 A:middle
Finally, we can hook up our data

00:42:28.876 --> 00:42:31.566 A:middle
model with our UI and write in

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:34.016 A:middle
the logic to bring everything

00:42:34.016 --> 00:42:34.546 A:middle
together.

00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:36.966 A:middle
Let's take a look at another

00:42:36.966 --> 00:42:37.446 A:middle
demo.

00:42:41.216 --> 00:42:43.526 A:middle
We need to save the score at the

00:42:43.566 --> 00:42:44.816 A:middle
end of each game.

00:42:45.736 --> 00:42:48.306 A:middle
To do this, I will select the

00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.046 A:middle
view controller that we wrote

00:42:50.046 --> 00:42:50.696 A:middle
with Jessie.

00:42:51.266 --> 00:42:54.226 A:middle
In the game over method, I will

00:42:55.396 --> 00:42:58.916 A:middle
call a method on my data model

00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.996 A:middle
that we wrote before to save the


00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.996 A:middle
that we wrote before to save the

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:01.446 A:middle
points.

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:06.186 A:middle
The-- this save points method

00:43:06.186 --> 00:43:07.646 A:middle
takes two parameters.

00:43:08.536 --> 00:43:10.456 A:middle
One is the total points which

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:13.106 A:middle
we've already saved in the game

00:43:13.106 --> 00:43:14.066 A:middle
points variable.

00:43:15.336 --> 00:43:18.746 A:middle
The second parameter is the name

00:43:18.746 --> 00:43:20.036 A:middle
of the user who's playing the

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:20.376 A:middle
game.

00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.896 A:middle
So to recap, I've just added

00:43:22.896 --> 00:43:24.826 A:middle
this little bit of code in our

00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.876 A:middle
view controller that we created

00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:27.356 A:middle
before.

00:43:28.066 --> 00:43:30.466 A:middle
The save points method on our

00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:32.926 A:middle
game data model takes two

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:33.706 A:middle
parameters.

00:43:34.336 --> 00:43:36.266 A:middle
The first is the game points

00:43:36.956 --> 00:43:39.026 A:middle
which we had already stored in a

00:43:39.026 --> 00:43:39.616 A:middle
variable.

00:43:40.596 --> 00:43:44.346 A:middle
The second parameter is the name

00:43:44.346 --> 00:43:45.776 A:middle
of the user who's playing the

00:43:45.776 --> 00:43:46.156 A:middle
game.

00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:49.916 A:middle
In a real-world app, you would

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.866 A:middle
probably want to create a

00:43:51.866 --> 00:43:53.636 A:middle
profile screen or a settings

00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:55.946 A:middle
screen where the user can enter

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:56.726 A:middle
their own name.

00:43:57.496 --> 00:43:59.056 A:middle
But for the purposes of this

00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.566 A:middle
demo, I'll just hardcode this to


00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.566 A:middle
demo, I'll just hardcode this to

00:44:01.566 --> 00:44:02.366 A:middle
my own name.

00:44:02.946 --> 00:44:05.856 A:middle
Now that we've saved the score,

00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:08.356 A:middle
we need to write some code to

00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:11.236 A:middle
actually display the right

00:44:11.576 --> 00:44:13.196 A:middle
scores and the names on the

00:44:13.196 --> 00:44:13.866 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:44:14.756 --> 00:44:16.386 A:middle
So let's go ahead and create

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:18.956 A:middle
another class by right-clicking

00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:21.506 A:middle
on the unicorn's folder and

00:44:21.506 --> 00:44:22.646 A:middle
going to new file.

00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:25.426 A:middle
A [inaudible] class again.

00:44:25.946 --> 00:44:28.836 A:middle
This will be a subclass of the

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.466 A:middle
UI table-view-controller.

00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:33.656 A:middle
Remember when we created the

00:44:33.656 --> 00:44:35.266 A:middle
leaderboard on our storyboard?

00:44:35.616 --> 00:44:37.336 A:middle
It was a table-view-controller,

00:44:37.696 --> 00:44:40.256 A:middle
so I use a table-view-controller

00:44:40.256 --> 00:44:42.816 A:middle
class again to put in some code

00:44:42.916 --> 00:44:44.096 A:middle
for that leaderboard.

00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.626 A:middle
Let's call it the

00:44:46.626 --> 00:44:48.476 A:middle
leaderboard-view-controller.

00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:51.636 A:middle
Hit next. And create.

00:44:56.096 --> 00:44:58.106 A:middle
This already has some code that

00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:00.036 A:middle
has been generated for us by


00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:00.036 A:middle
has been generated for us by

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:00.726 A:middle
Xcode.

00:45:01.536 --> 00:45:03.156 A:middle
These are methods that

00:45:03.646 --> 00:45:05.956 A:middle
developers find useful when

00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:06.756 A:middle
building their own

00:45:06.756 --> 00:45:07.916 A:middle
table-view-controllers.

00:45:08.976 --> 00:45:11.016 A:middle
We will implement two of these

00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:11.536 A:middle
methods.

00:45:12.766 --> 00:45:15.666 A:middle
First is a table view number of

00:45:15.736 --> 00:45:16.866 A:middle
rows in sections.

00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:20.916 A:middle
This method is asking us for the

00:45:21.066 --> 00:45:22.906 A:middle
total number of rows that we

00:45:22.906 --> 00:45:24.576 A:middle
want to display in our table

00:45:24.576 --> 00:45:24.836 A:middle
view.

00:45:25.966 --> 00:45:28.416 A:middle
In our case, the total number of

00:45:28.466 --> 00:45:30.656 A:middle
rows will be the same as the

00:45:30.766 --> 00:45:32.146 A:middle
total number of players that

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:33.336 A:middle
have played the game.

00:45:33.336 --> 00:45:36.026 A:middle
And we can get this information

00:45:36.026 --> 00:45:37.736 A:middle
again from our data model.

00:45:38.706 --> 00:45:40.586 A:middle
So the number of players

00:45:40.586 --> 00:45:42.836 A:middle
variable will give us the total

00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:43.616 A:middle
number of rows.

00:45:45.056 --> 00:45:46.986 A:middle
The second method that we need

00:45:46.986 --> 00:45:49.396 A:middle
to implement is the cell

00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:50.226 A:middle
[inaudible] at index path

00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:50.976 A:middle
method.

00:45:52.536 --> 00:45:55.906 A:middle
This method is called every time

00:45:56.116 --> 00:45:59.006 A:middle
a cell needs to be displayed on

00:45:59.006 --> 00:45:59.746 A:middle
our leaderboard.


00:46:00.776 --> 00:46:03.766 A:middle
The index path argument tells us

00:46:03.856 --> 00:46:06.636 A:middle
the row number for the cell that

00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:07.576 A:middle
will be displayed.

00:46:08.856 --> 00:46:10.706 A:middle
And in here, we're expected to

00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:13.256 A:middle
configure the cell just like the

00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:14.116 A:middle
comment says.

00:46:15.526 --> 00:46:18.146 A:middle
So let me pull in some code to

00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:18.956 A:middle
set up this cell.

00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:22.126 A:middle
We are using our game data class

00:46:22.386 --> 00:46:22.876 A:middle
again.

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:26.256 A:middle
And the index paths row will

00:46:26.256 --> 00:46:28.366 A:middle
tell us the rank of the player.

00:46:28.976 --> 00:46:30.046 A:middle
Since we want to display the

00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:31.566 A:middle
players in ascending order.

00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:35.036 A:middle
Once we have the player rank, we

00:46:35.036 --> 00:46:36.816 A:middle
can send it to the player data

00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:38.806 A:middle
method on our game data class

00:46:39.316 --> 00:46:40.996 A:middle
and get more information about

00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:41.466 A:middle
that player.

00:46:42.906 --> 00:46:45.006 A:middle
Using this information, we can

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:46.336 A:middle
set up our cell.

00:46:47.246 --> 00:46:49.626 A:middle
The text label is the title.

00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:51.956 A:middle
The detail text label is the

00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:52.826 A:middle
subtitle.

00:46:53.296 --> 00:46:54.996 A:middle
And the image view is the image

00:46:54.996 --> 00:46:56.486 A:middle
that will have the photo.

00:46:56.486 --> 00:46:59.216 A:middle
Now instead of creating this

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.136 A:middle
game data instance twice, I'm


00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.136 A:middle
game data instance twice, I'm

00:47:01.136 --> 00:47:02.406 A:middle
just going to put it at the top

00:47:02.406 --> 00:47:04.036 A:middle
of the class so it can be

00:47:04.036 --> 00:47:04.556 A:middle
reused.

00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:08.136 A:middle
Let me also delete the number of

00:47:08.236 --> 00:47:09.976 A:middle
sections method that was added

00:47:09.976 --> 00:47:11.936 A:middle
for us by default, because we

00:47:11.936 --> 00:47:12.936 A:middle
don't need this today.

00:47:13.506 --> 00:47:15.576 A:middle
Now that we have written the

00:47:15.656 --> 00:47:17.996 A:middle
code for the leaderboard, let's

00:47:18.076 --> 00:47:20.546 A:middle
open the main storyboard and the

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:21.986 A:middle
Assistant Editor on the right.

00:47:23.546 --> 00:47:25.486 A:middle
I'll rotate the specs so we can

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.646 A:middle
see it properly.

00:47:30.476 --> 00:47:33.116 A:middle
We need to tell Xcode that the

00:47:33.256 --> 00:47:35.786 A:middle
code for our leaderboard here is

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.616 A:middle
written in the class that we

00:47:37.616 --> 00:47:38.426 A:middle
just created.

00:47:39.466 --> 00:47:41.786 A:middle
To do this, I'll select the view

00:47:41.786 --> 00:47:43.516 A:middle
controller for the leaderboard.

00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:46.616 A:middle
Go to the Identity Inspector,

00:47:47.306 --> 00:47:49.386 A:middle
and change the class name to

00:47:49.386 --> 00:47:50.806 A:middle
leaderboard-view-controller.

00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:54.216 A:middle
After this, I'll select the

00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:57.366 A:middle
table view in the storyboard.

00:47:58.066 --> 00:48:00.146 A:middle
Go to the attributes Inspector


00:47:58.066 --> 00:48:00.146 A:middle
Go to the attributes Inspector

00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:02.746 A:middle
and change the content type to

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:03.926 A:middle
dynamic prototypes.

00:48:05.736 --> 00:48:08.136 A:middle
This means that the cells are

00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:10.736 A:middle
now being created dynamically in

00:48:10.736 --> 00:48:12.006 A:middle
the code that we wrote.

00:48:13.576 --> 00:48:15.836 A:middle
We will also select a single

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:16.306 A:middle
cell.

00:48:19.356 --> 00:48:22.156 A:middle
And in the identifier section in

00:48:22.156 --> 00:48:24.626 A:middle
the Attributes Inspector, I'll

00:48:24.626 --> 00:48:27.606 A:middle
copy over the reuse identifier

00:48:28.106 --> 00:48:29.706 A:middle
from the cell [inaudible] index

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.046 A:middle
path method in my class.

00:48:32.926 --> 00:48:35.456 A:middle
By doing this, I'm saying that

00:48:35.456 --> 00:48:37.876 A:middle
I'm willing to reuse the cells

00:48:37.926 --> 00:48:38.916 A:middle
in my table view.

00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:40.966 A:middle
This will help improve the

00:48:41.026 --> 00:48:42.716 A:middle
performance of my table view.

00:48:45.276 --> 00:48:47.346 A:middle
Finally, we've written the code

00:48:47.486 --> 00:48:49.976 A:middle
for this leaderboard class.

00:48:50.086 --> 00:48:51.606 A:middle
We still need to write code for

00:48:51.606 --> 00:48:52.956 A:middle
our details-view-controller.

00:48:56.356 --> 00:48:58.286 A:middle
Luckily, I've already added some

00:48:58.286 --> 00:49:00.446 A:middle
code that we'll import into our


00:48:58.286 --> 00:49:00.446 A:middle
code that we'll import into our

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:01.156 A:middle
project.

00:49:03.336 --> 00:49:03.936 A:middle
This is the

00:49:03.936 --> 00:49:06.586 A:middle
details-view-controller class.

00:49:07.116 --> 00:49:09.056 A:middle
Let's jump to it from our jump

00:49:09.166 --> 00:49:09.466 A:middle
bar.

00:49:11.226 --> 00:49:14.326 A:middle
Here we have some IBOutlets for

00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:15.746 A:middle
the different views in our

00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:17.126 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:49:18.196 --> 00:49:20.506 A:middle
Remember when we wrote the game,

00:49:20.506 --> 00:49:22.526 A:middle
we connected these IBOutlets to

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:24.236 A:middle
the views on the storyboard.

00:49:25.226 --> 00:49:26.526 A:middle
But we're not able to do that

00:49:26.616 --> 00:49:27.196 A:middle
right now.

00:49:28.026 --> 00:49:30.376 A:middle
This is because we haven't told

00:49:30.436 --> 00:49:32.526 A:middle
Xcode that the code for this

00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:34.196 A:middle
view controller is right here.

00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:36.636 A:middle
Let's do that again by going to

00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:38.466 A:middle
the Identity Inspector and

00:49:38.466 --> 00:49:39.936 A:middle
changing the class name to

00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:41.246 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:44.806 A:middle
Now we can connect the IBOutlets

00:49:44.896 --> 00:49:45.476 A:middle
easily.

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:55.166 A:middle
By doing this, we can set the

00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:57.506 A:middle
views from our code like I've

00:49:57.506 --> 00:49:59.946 A:middle
done in the view load method

00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:00.226 A:middle
here.


00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:00.226 A:middle
here.

00:50:01.456 --> 00:50:02.966 A:middle
Let me hide the main storyboard

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:05.446 A:middle
for a moment.

00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.686 A:middle
We also have a player info

00:50:07.686 --> 00:50:08.366 A:middle
variable here.

00:50:08.366 --> 00:50:11.046 A:middle
And we are using that player

00:50:11.046 --> 00:50:13.426 A:middle
information to set up our views.

00:50:14.876 --> 00:50:16.706 A:middle
You might be wondering that we

00:50:16.706 --> 00:50:18.166 A:middle
didn't really send this player

00:50:18.166 --> 00:50:19.356 A:middle
information anywhere.

00:50:20.246 --> 00:50:21.756 A:middle
So how do we get all this data?

00:50:23.136 --> 00:50:25.106 A:middle
We actually need to ask our

00:50:25.106 --> 00:50:27.266 A:middle
leaderboard about the person

00:50:27.266 --> 00:50:28.166 A:middle
whose name was tapped.

00:50:29.576 --> 00:50:30.946 A:middle
So we'll go back in the

00:50:30.946 --> 00:50:32.906 A:middle
leaderboard scoreboard and

00:50:33.006 --> 00:50:35.266 A:middle
figure out which person we need

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:36.936 A:middle
to display more information

00:50:36.936 --> 00:50:37.336 A:middle
about.

00:50:38.526 --> 00:50:39.226 A:middle
I'll jump to the

00:50:39.226 --> 00:50:40.626 A:middle
leaderboard-view-controller.

00:50:41.876 --> 00:50:44.336 A:middle
At the bottom of this class, we

00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:46.226 A:middle
have a method that was written

00:50:46.226 --> 00:50:48.506 A:middle
for us by Xcode called the

00:50:48.506 --> 00:50:49.916 A:middle
prepare-for-segue method.

00:50:50.946 --> 00:50:54.476 A:middle
This gets called while we're

00:50:54.476 --> 00:50:56.146 A:middle
transitioning between one view

00:50:56.146 --> 00:50:57.946 A:middle
controller and another.

00:50:58.466 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
It will be called for us as soon


00:50:58.466 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
It will be called for us as soon

00:51:00.946 --> 00:51:03.346 A:middle
as we tap on a cell in our

00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:04.506 A:middle
table-view-controller.

00:51:05.226 --> 00:51:08.296 A:middle
So in here, I will get more

00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:10.216 A:middle
information about the player

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:11.786 A:middle
based on the rank again.

00:51:11.786 --> 00:51:14.206 A:middle
And I can figure out the rank

00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:16.866 A:middle
because there is a property on

00:51:16.866 --> 00:51:18.816 A:middle
the table view called index path

00:51:19.196 --> 00:51:20.256 A:middle
for selected row.

00:51:20.256 --> 00:51:23.456 A:middle
This tells me the row number for

00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:24.946 A:middle
the cell that was selected.

00:51:25.476 --> 00:51:29.036 A:middle
We also get a segue parameter in

00:51:29.036 --> 00:51:29.566 A:middle
this method.

00:51:29.566 --> 00:51:32.706 A:middle
Remember how segues connect two

00:51:32.706 --> 00:51:33.686 A:middle
view controllers?

00:51:33.776 --> 00:51:36.286 A:middle
So the segue's destination

00:51:36.286 --> 00:51:38.686 A:middle
property will tell me which view

00:51:38.686 --> 00:51:40.146 A:middle
controller we're navigating

00:51:40.146 --> 00:51:40.666 A:middle
towards.

00:51:41.956 --> 00:51:44.236 A:middle
Once we have an instance of the

00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:46.456 A:middle
details-view-controller which is

00:51:46.456 --> 00:51:47.686 A:middle
the one we're going towards,

00:51:48.286 --> 00:51:50.496 A:middle
then we can set the player info

00:51:50.786 --> 00:51:52.206 A:middle
with the details we have.

00:51:53.776 --> 00:51:55.686 A:middle
Finally, we are ready to run our

00:51:55.686 --> 00:51:58.426 A:middle
app one last time and see how

00:51:58.426 --> 00:51:59.686 A:middle
everything comes together.


00:52:01.496 --> 00:52:02.756 A:middle
So now we'll play the game.

00:52:02.756 --> 00:52:06.186 A:middle
And we go to the leaderboard,

00:52:06.716 --> 00:52:07.826 A:middle
and we can see all the

00:52:07.826 --> 00:52:09.656 A:middle
information coming in from our

00:52:09.656 --> 00:52:10.516 A:middle
data model.

00:52:11.516 --> 00:52:16.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:52:17.476 --> 00:52:19.546 A:middle
I made only one point, so I'm at

00:52:19.546 --> 00:52:20.136 A:middle
the end.

00:52:20.536 --> 00:52:22.196 A:middle
Let me see what my rank is.

00:52:23.096 --> 00:52:24.706 A:middle
Rank eleven, not too bad.

00:52:25.016 --> 00:52:26.616 A:middle
At least my app is all set up.

00:52:28.586 --> 00:52:31.206 A:middle
Now that we've built our app,

00:52:31.476 --> 00:52:33.246 A:middle
let's take a look at some next

00:52:33.246 --> 00:52:33.426 A:middle
steps.

00:52:35.226 --> 00:52:36.366 A:middle
Before you release your apps,

00:52:36.956 --> 00:52:38.446 A:middle
it's important to test them.

00:52:39.376 --> 00:52:41.176 A:middle
The exit test framework can be

00:52:41.176 --> 00:52:44.516 A:middle
used to write unit tests.

00:52:44.666 --> 00:52:46.076 A:middle
You should also check out the

00:52:46.076 --> 00:52:47.756 A:middle
App Store review guidelines.

00:52:48.646 --> 00:52:50.116 A:middle
These are meant for creating a

00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:52.206 A:middle
good experience for users and

00:52:52.206 --> 00:52:53.286 A:middle
developers alike.

00:52:54.056 --> 00:52:57.006 A:middle
At some point, you'd need to

00:52:57.006 --> 00:52:58.616 A:middle
enroll in the Apple Developer

00:52:58.616 --> 00:52:59.266 A:middle
Program.


00:53:00.216 --> 00:53:01.896 A:middle
This will help you create the

00:53:01.896 --> 00:53:03.536 A:middle
certificates and profiles that

00:53:03.536 --> 00:53:05.756 A:middle
you need to distribute your

00:53:06.886 --> 00:53:06.976 A:middle
apps.

00:53:08.046 --> 00:53:10.176 A:middle
Finally, submit your apps for

00:53:10.176 --> 00:53:10.696 A:middle
review.

00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:13.926 A:middle
Once they're approved, go tell

00:53:13.926 --> 00:53:15.396 A:middle
your friends and family and the

00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:16.076 A:middle
whole world.

00:53:16.346 --> 00:53:17.186 A:middle
That you've built an app.

00:53:18.746 --> 00:53:20.396 A:middle
To learn more about these next

00:53:20.396 --> 00:53:22.546 A:middle
steps, check out the resources

00:53:22.596 --> 00:53:25.046 A:middle
section for this session on your

00:53:25.046 --> 00:53:27.316 A:middle
WWDC Apps.

00:53:27.836 --> 00:53:30.896 A:middle
To summarize, I would encourage

00:53:30.896 --> 00:53:32.756 A:middle
you to explore Xcode.

00:53:33.056 --> 00:53:35.476 A:middle
It has many tools and templates

00:53:35.596 --> 00:53:37.696 A:middle
that make iOS development really

00:53:37.696 --> 00:53:38.216 A:middle
easy.

00:53:38.746 --> 00:53:42.046 A:middle
You can easily set up the user

00:53:42.046 --> 00:53:44.006 A:middle
interface using the storyboard.

00:53:44.596 --> 00:53:46.826 A:middle
Try some views and see what your

00:53:46.826 --> 00:53:48.626 A:middle
app might look like.

00:53:50.146 --> 00:53:52.106 A:middle
Think about what data you might

00:53:52.106 --> 00:53:53.916 A:middle
need, and how you would store

00:53:54.756 --> 00:53:54.826 A:middle
it.

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:58.186 A:middle
It's important to create good

00:53:58.186 --> 00:54:00.386 A:middle
user experiences for all


00:53:58.186 --> 00:54:00.386 A:middle
user experiences for all

00:54:00.386 --> 00:54:01.086 A:middle
devices.

00:54:01.796 --> 00:54:03.356 A:middle
This might mean optimizing

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:05.856 A:middle
performance for older devices or

00:54:05.856 --> 00:54:07.596 A:middle
taking care of different screen

00:54:07.596 --> 00:54:08.266 A:middle
sizes.

00:54:10.216 --> 00:54:12.236 A:middle
Follow the guidelines and best

00:54:12.236 --> 00:54:14.096 A:middle
practices to make a good app.

00:54:14.096 --> 00:54:18.216 A:middle
If you've done all this, then

00:54:18.216 --> 00:54:20.106 A:middle
you're officially an iOS app

00:54:20.106 --> 00:54:20.866 A:middle
developer.

00:54:21.516 --> 00:54:22.676 A:middle
Congratulations!

00:54:22.846 --> 00:54:24.456 A:middle
And have a great WWDC.
