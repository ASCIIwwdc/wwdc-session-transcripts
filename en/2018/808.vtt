00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:21.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.536 A:middle
Hey everyone.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.916 A:middle
How many of you're interested in

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.156 A:middle
AR?

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:28.106 A:middle
All right.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.326 A:middle
Cool. Now how many of you have

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.606 A:middle
an AR app in the App Store

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:31.936 A:middle
already?

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:34.876 A:middle
Okay. A few less.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.726 A:middle
I get it. AR can be pretty

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:38.276 A:middle
intimidating.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.716 A:middle
Well, today we're going to look

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.466 A:middle
at a few techniques that we use

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.516 A:middle
which will hopefully help you in

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:45.006 A:middle
two ways.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.246 A:middle
First, they're going to

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.886 A:middle
hopefully help make AR more

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.346 A:middle
approachable and second, we're

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:53.256 A:middle
going to show you how you can

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:55.106 A:middle
save time and money by making

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:56.246 A:middle
sure you build the right things

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.386 A:middle
before you write a single line

00:00:58.496 --> 00:00:59.306 A:middle
of code.

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:01.296 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.186 A:middle
If you've seen previous talks by

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.766 A:middle
my team here at WWDC, you may

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.896 A:middle
already be familiar with our

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.726 A:middle
revolutionary app Toast Modern,

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:14.626 A:middle
the best app for finding and

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.096 A:middle
rating the toast around you.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:17.516 A:middle
I know it's amazing.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:20.436 A:middle
Well, we've been building up our

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:22.976 A:middle
database of toast, and now we've

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.836 A:middle
been tasked with adding AR to

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:26.826 A:middle
this app.

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:28.206 A:middle
I'm sure you're all aware that

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:29.586 A:middle
the artisanal toast scene in the

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.146 A:middle
Bay Area it's pretty big right

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:31.416 A:middle
now.

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:35.666 A:middle
Well, today it's going to get a

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.846 A:middle
whole lot bigger.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:42.196 A:middle
Introducing ToastAR, the world's

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:46.036 A:middle
first AR toast recognition and

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:46.896 A:middle
rating app.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.346 A:middle
I know. Thank you.

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:48.926 A:middle
Thank you.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.776 A:middle
Through the use of computer

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:55.076 A:middle
vision and AR, ToastAR lets you

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:56.556 A:middle
check the ratings on a piece of

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.686 A:middle
toast and get this, where it's

00:01:58.686 --> 00:01:59.026 A:middle
from.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.106 A:middle
Revolutionary I know.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.136 A:middle
I mean, you're all developers

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
for Apple platforms so you

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.716 A:middle
expect the best APIs and the

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.926 A:middle
best hardware.

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:09.726 A:middle
Why not also expect only the

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:10.606 A:middle
best toast too.

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.246 A:middle
So how did we prototype this

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.996 A:middle
beautiful, revolutionary app?

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.276 A:middle
Well, you may think we used a

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.426 A:middle
programming language like Swift

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.786 A:middle
or a framework like ARKit or

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:26.376 A:middle
maybe even a sophisticated

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.736 A:middle
application such as Unity.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.946 A:middle
These are all valid ways to

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.796 A:middle
prototype, but they're not the

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:32.516 A:middle
only solution.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.276 A:middle
Sometimes you can use low-tech

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:38.736 A:middle
physical prototyping techniques

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:40.226 A:middle
to work through your design

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.616 A:middle
problems before you write a

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.436 A:middle
single line of code.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.046 A:middle
So today I'm going to show you

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.646 A:middle
how you can use just the camera

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:53.026 A:middle
app and the world around you to

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:54.976 A:middle
prototype for AR just like we

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:55.696 A:middle
did for ToastAR.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.586 A:middle
So before we get started,

00:02:57.586 --> 00:02:58.546 A:middle
there's two terms you should be

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.646 A:middle
familiar with.

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:03.076 A:middle
First world space.

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
When we talk about world space,

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
we're talking about design

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.886 A:middle
elements in the world around you

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:09.576 A:middle
and your device.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
And when we talk about screen

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.846 A:middle
space, we're talking about these

00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.466 A:middle
elements on the screen of your

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:16.796 A:middle
device.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.216 A:middle
So let's take a look at the

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.376 A:middle
original design we got for

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:22.616 A:middle
ToastAR and work through our

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:23.206 A:middle
process.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:28.456 A:middle
In this design, we have a label

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.446 A:middle
in world space which shows us

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.466 A:middle
where the toast is from and its

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.006 A:middle
current rating.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
Now, you may want to jump in and

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.196 A:middle
start coding this immediately.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.726 A:middle
It looks pretty simple, but

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:40.366 A:middle
instead we're going to save time

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.336 A:middle
and money by making sure we are

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
building only the right things

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
before we write a single line of

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:46.606 A:middle
code.

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:49.166 A:middle
AR is about the world around

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:49.326 A:middle
you.

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.386 A:middle
So testing out your designs is

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.166 A:middle
difficult through a single still

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.046 A:middle
or even video.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
Physical prototyping, however,

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.446 A:middle
allows us to do this in an

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.516 A:middle
approachable, low-tech and

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.516 A:middle
approachable, low-tech and

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:02.646 A:middle
highly-iterative manner.

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.256 A:middle
So how did we get started here?

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.816 A:middle
Well, we printed out our labels

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.366 A:middle
and stuck them to some

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:10.946 A:middle
toothpicks.

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.326 A:middle
I know. I know.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.796 A:middle
It may seem odd, but this

00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
low-tech process is going to

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:19.255 A:middle
hopefully help us in three ways.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
First, we're going to be testing

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:23.616 A:middle
our designs in context.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.776 A:middle
Remember, AR is about the world

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:26.146 A:middle
around you.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:29.256 A:middle
Second, we're going to hopefully

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:30.656 A:middle
figure out any issues with our

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.586 A:middle
design before we write a single

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.686 A:middle
line of code.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.246 A:middle
And third, through this process,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.206 A:middle
hopefully we'll get new ideas

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.136 A:middle
that will help make ToastAR even

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.116 A:middle
better.

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:44.646 A:middle
But who even has a printer these

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:45.196 A:middle
days, right?

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
You can even just draw something

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
and cut it out.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:54.476 A:middle
So now that we have our labels

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.896 A:middle
attached to our toothpicks,

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.336 A:middle
well, we stick them in a piece

00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:57.756 A:middle
of toast.

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
Then, just using the camera app,

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
Then, just using the camera app,

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.756 A:middle
we can test this design out in

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:03.346 A:middle
world space.

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.886 A:middle
I know. Revolutionary here,

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:07.976 A:middle
right?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:13.636 A:middle
When we tried this, we learned

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:14.796 A:middle
one thing really quickly.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.426 A:middle
These labels, at an angle, are

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.086 A:middle
pretty difficult to read.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.126 A:middle
So the label is hard to read at

00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:20.646 A:middle
an angle.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.266 A:middle
Maybe we should have it always

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:23.976 A:middle
face the camera.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.226 A:middle
So let's try this out.

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:29.626 A:middle
So with some help from a

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.606 A:middle
co-worker and some extremely

00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
sophisticated hardware, okay,

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:35.836 A:middle
it's a clear ruler but

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:37.076 A:middle
beautiful.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.326 A:middle
We tested this out.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.496 A:middle
And we found that yes, the label

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:42.846 A:middle
is easier to read when it's

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:43.766 A:middle
always facing the camera.

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:46.436 A:middle
Well, this behavior is commonly

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
referred to as billboarding.

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.256 A:middle
And it seems like it'd be pretty

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.056 A:middle
easy to implement in SceneKit

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
using an SCNBillboardConstraint.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:55.746 A:middle
But before we start coding this,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.296 A:middle
let's continue to test this

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
design and make sure we're only

00:05:58.866 --> 00:05:59.726 A:middle
building the right things.

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:01.866 A:middle
So how does the label work when

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.386 A:middle
there's a lot more text or when

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.196 A:middle
it's at a distance?

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.456 A:middle
Well, we can try this out pretty

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.706 A:middle
easily too.

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:09.416 A:middle
Again, with the camera app, we

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.636 A:middle
can test this out and we find

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:12.806 A:middle
that yes, it's a little

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:13.956 A:middle
difficult to read when these

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:14.986 A:middle
labels are at a distance.

00:06:15.456 --> 00:06:16.316 A:middle
Maybe we should bring these

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.416 A:middle
labels on the screen.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.526 A:middle
So how do we prototype this?

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
Well, we're talking about screen

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.566 A:middle
space, and we want to do this

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:25.796 A:middle
quickly.

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:26.996 A:middle
So we're going to go ahead and

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:27.656 A:middle
use Keynote.

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.666 A:middle
First, we're going to record a

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:34.786 A:middle
video of our toast.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.136 A:middle
We'll record a slow pan.

00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:38.346 A:middle
And notice that we're going to

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:40.106 A:middle
pause on the toast to give our

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:41.486 A:middle
upcoming animation some time.

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:46.456 A:middle
Next, we're going to bring this

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:47.706 A:middle
into Keynote.

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:50.796 A:middle
So you'll create a custom

00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:52.516 A:middle
document size which matches the

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:53.576 A:middle
device you're eventually going

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:58.046 A:middle
to put this on and then simply

00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
import your video and bring it

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.086 A:middle
into Keynote.

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.086 A:middle
into Keynote.

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:06.136 A:middle
Third, we're going to animate

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
our labeling, import our design,

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:12.846 A:middle
add a move action, give it an

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.156 A:middle
appropriate duration, and move

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:16.626 A:middle
it to the desired destination.

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:21.146 A:middle
Now here's the important part.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:22.356 A:middle
We're going to check the build

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:24.286 A:middle
order and make sure our video

00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:25.956 A:middle
and our animation begin at the

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.036 A:middle
same time but we're giving the

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:30.136 A:middle
animation a delay so it's on

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.836 A:middle
screen when the toast is in the

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:32.356 A:middle
field of view.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:36.616 A:middle
Finally, we're going to put this

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.296 A:middle
on a device and test it out in

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:38.936 A:middle
context.

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:43.836 A:middle
So we'll put it on a device

00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:45.086 A:middle
using Keynote for iOS.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.616 A:middle
And we'll test this out in

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.136 A:middle
context.

00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.326 A:middle
Great. Looks like we could fit

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:53.386 A:middle
all the text we need on this

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:53.676 A:middle
label.

00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:55.896 A:middle
And putting this on screen space

00:07:55.896 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
will hopefully make it easier to

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.716 A:middle
expand the scope of this label

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.566 A:middle
at a future date.

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.566 A:middle
at a future date.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.036 A:middle
Now let's see how this scales,

00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:03.196 A:middle
though.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:03.836 A:middle
What happens when there's

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.166 A:middle
multiple pieces of toast in the

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:05.686 A:middle
field of view?

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.636 A:middle
So using the same techniques,

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:09.646 A:middle
we'll try this out too.

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.426 A:middle
Now the problem here is when

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:16.606 A:middle
there's multiple pieces of toast

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.966 A:middle
in the field of view, I have no

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.056 A:middle
idea which piece of toast I'm

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:22.416 A:middle
currently interacting with.

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:24.036 A:middle
Maybe I should try putting an

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.266 A:middle
indicator in world space so that

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:28.516 A:middle
I know which piece of toast I'm

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.456 A:middle
currently interacting with.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
Well, we can try this out too,

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:31.546 A:middle
quickly.

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.756 A:middle
So, again, with some help from

00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:37.176 A:middle
our co-worker and our trusty

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.336 A:middle
ruler, we can try this out too.

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.346 A:middle
Print out our design, attach it

00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.936 A:middle
to the ruler, and try this out.

00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:44.796 A:middle
It's the camera app world space.

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:47.436 A:middle
This seems to help us.

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:48.726 A:middle
We know which piece of toast

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:49.766 A:middle
we're currently interacting

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:50.426 A:middle
with.

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.016 A:middle
So let's put it all together.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.666 A:middle
Using the techniques we just

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.326 A:middle
reviewed, we can put together a

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.136 A:middle
rough demo of our prototype.

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.136 A:middle
rough demo of our prototype.

00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:01.906 A:middle
And when we know we're building

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:06.036 A:middle
the right things, we now know we

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:07.296 A:middle
have some high-fidelity

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.296 A:middle
prototypes to base our code off

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:11.736 A:middle
of.

00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:13.656 A:middle
In just a few hours, we worked

00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:14.896 A:middle
through problems that could have

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:18.256 A:middle
taken us days to code through.

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:19.326 A:middle
So what did we learn?

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.586 A:middle
Well, we learned these labels in

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:21.916 A:middle
world space are difficult to

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.586 A:middle
read at an angle and at a

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.276 A:middle
distance, so we brought them on

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:25.846 A:middle
screen.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:29.106 A:middle
But we also learned that we

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
needed indicators in world space

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.716 A:middle
to let the user know what

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:32.806 A:middle
they're currently interacting

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:32.976 A:middle
with.

00:09:38.836 --> 00:09:40.636 A:middle
Physical prototyping allowed us

00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:42.426 A:middle
to test these AR experiences out

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:43.186 A:middle
quickly.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:46.576 A:middle
We used the camera app to test

00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:48.006 A:middle
our world space interactions.

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:50.916 A:middle
And we used Keynote to test out

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.236 A:middle
our screen space interactions.

00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:54.956 A:middle
So how did prototyping help us?

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.276 A:middle
Well, we tested our ideas, and

00:09:58.276 --> 00:09:59.136 A:middle
now we're going to be saving

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:01.056 A:middle
time and money by making sure we

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:01.056 A:middle
time and money by making sure we

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
build the right things before we

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:08.816 A:middle
write a single line of code.

00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:10.496 A:middle
We also got some new ideas along

00:10:10.496 --> 00:10:11.116 A:middle
the process.

00:10:11.616 --> 00:10:13.216 A:middle
These ideas helped make ToastAR

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:13.766 A:middle
even better.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:16.366 A:middle
And take it from me, it's pretty

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:16.746 A:middle
amazing.

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:20.506 A:middle
Hopefully when you start working

00:10:20.506 --> 00:10:22.336 A:middle
on your next project, you now

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.406 A:middle
have a few new tools when you

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:27.836 A:middle
tackle your next AR app.

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:28.976 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:33.500 A:middle
