00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:32.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon and

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.086 A:middle
thank you for coming to What's

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:34.806 A:middle
New in WatchOS.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.336 A:middle
In this session, we're going to

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.896 A:middle
give you a high-level overview

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.796 A:middle
of the new features you as

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:42.316 A:middle
developers, designers and

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:43.496 A:middle
product leaders can take

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:45.386 A:middle
advantage of to create great

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:46.446 A:middle
Watch experiences.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.146 A:middle
And we're also going to dip into

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:50.036 A:middle
the details of the new APIs and

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:51.196 A:middle
interface builder options.

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:53.966 A:middle
My name is Lori Hylan-Cho, I

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.086 A:middle
work on the Watch frameworks

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:56.676 A:middle
team, and I am beyond thrilled

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:58.146 A:middle
to be here, to share with you

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.786 A:middle
the awesome new options for

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.556 A:middle
creating great Watch experiences

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.556 A:middle
creating great Watch experiences

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:02.446 A:middle
in WatchOS 5.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.246 A:middle
We've come a long way since our

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.346 A:middle
humble beginnings in 2015.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.746 A:middle
And a great Watch experience now

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
consists of several components,

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:13.846 A:middle
of which a Watch app is likely

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:14.766 A:middle
to be only one.

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.436 A:middle
Notifications, complications and

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.846 A:middle
Siri shortcuts work together to

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.126 A:middle
create a Watch experience that

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.846 A:middle
allows for brief and meaningful

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:25.156 A:middle
interactions with the right

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:26.906 A:middle
information at exactly the right

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:27.176 A:middle
time.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.426 A:middle
And of course, with Series 3

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:31.956 A:middle
Watches that support cellular,

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.876 A:middle
and the new Wi-Fi options that

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:35.206 A:middle
let you join networks directly

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:36.766 A:middle
from the Watch, more and more

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.226 A:middle
Watch wearers are venturing out

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:39.196 A:middle
without their phones.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:40.846 A:middle
So, it's important to create a

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:42.146 A:middle
Watch experience that feels

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:42.666 A:middle
complete.

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:44.816 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.636 A:middle
features we've added to WatchOS

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.316 A:middle
5 to help you deliver this kind

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.746 A:middle
of a great experience on the

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:50.646 A:middle
wrist.

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:54.666 A:middle
Ask any Apple Watch user what

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.806 A:middle
they like most about their

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.006 A:middle
Watch, and one of the first

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:57.976 A:middle
things they'll say is

00:01:57.976 --> 00:01:58.966 A:middle
notifications.

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
We're making notifications even

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
We're making notifications even

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.776 A:middle
richer this year with a few key

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:03.496 A:middle
improvements.

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:07.476 A:middle
Creating dynamic notifications

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:08.916 A:middle
with images and text has been an

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:10.536 A:middle
option since WatchOS 1.

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:11.916 A:middle
But if the user missed the

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:13.416 A:middle
notification when it arrived,

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:15.666 A:middle
chances were they'd never see it

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.246 A:middle
at all, as the Notification

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:18.756 A:middle
Center would display the static

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:19.246 A:middle
version.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.086 A:middle
This was intentional, as we have

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:23.136 A:middle
more time to display the

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:24.546 A:middle
notification when it arrives

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:25.676 A:middle
than we do when displaying it

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:26.926 A:middle
from Notification Center.

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:30.856 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, we'll do our best

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:32.276 A:middle
to show that beautiful dynamic

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:34.686 A:middle
notification with no code

00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:36.136 A:middle
changes or recompilation

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:37.136 A:middle
required on your part.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:39.426 A:middle
We worked hard to make this

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.446 A:middle
possible for its own sake but

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:42.706 A:middle
being able to show dynamic

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:44.176 A:middle
notifications from Notification

00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:46.086 A:middle
Center also makes possible the

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:47.456 A:middle
next two features I'm going to

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:48.076 A:middle
tell you about.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:51.676 A:middle
The first of these is grouped

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:52.576 A:middle
notifications.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.036 A:middle
You probably already know that

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:56.656 A:middle
you can have multiple categories

00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.016 A:middle
and different notification

00:02:58.016 --> 00:02:59.536 A:middle
interfaces for each one.

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:01.116 A:middle
And you might already be

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:01.116 A:middle
And you might already be

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:02.816 A:middle
specifying a thread ID and the

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.116 A:middle
push notifications that get

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.806 A:middle
forwarded from iOS to the Watch.

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.856 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, this will cause

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.166 A:middle
notifications to be grouped

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.666 A:middle
automatically in Notification

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.806 A:middle
Center as you saw in the

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:14.456 A:middle
previous slide.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.906 A:middle
Specifying a category and thread

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.356 A:middle
ID also opens up another

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.086 A:middle
possibility.

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.406 A:middle
Getting the same behavior as the

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.306 A:middle
built-in messages app, where new

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.726 A:middle
notifications with the same

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.046 A:middle
thread ID that come in when the

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.706 A:middle
original one is still on screen

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:31.586 A:middle
are appended to the existing

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:32.036 A:middle
interface.

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
We made this kind of grouping

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.646 A:middle
behavior optional to give you a

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:37.986 A:middle
chance to handle being called

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:39.446 A:middle
multiple times for the same

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.556 A:middle
notification interface

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:40.976 A:middle
controller.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.466 A:middle
To opt into this behavior,

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:46.896 A:middle
select your notifications

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
category in the interface

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:51.116 A:middle
storyboard for your Watch app.

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:52.446 A:middle
And check the handle's grouping

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.316 A:middle
box in the attributes inspector.

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.186 A:middle
If the original notification is

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
on screen when additional

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
notifications that have a

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
notifications that have a

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
matching category and thread ID

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.986 A:middle
arrive, did receive notification

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.296 A:middle
will be called again on the

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:06.856 A:middle
existing notification interface

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
controller.

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:10.066 A:middle
So, you should be prepared to

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.686 A:middle
append content to the existing

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:12.856 A:middle
notification interface.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:14.936 A:middle
Perhaps by adding a blank line

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:16.696 A:middle
and the new body content to an

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:17.505 A:middle
existing label.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.076 A:middle
Or by adding a new row to a

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
table, as you saw on the

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.125 A:middle
previous example.

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
And speaking of did receive

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.216 A:middle
notification, its signature has

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.556 A:middle
changed in WatchOS 5.

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:30.556 A:middle
This version, with the

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:31.896 A:middle
completion handler has been

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.196 A:middle
deprecated, in favor of this

00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:36.286 A:middle
simplified version.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.356 A:middle
We did this, so we'd have a

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.616 A:middle
clear boundary for when you're

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:40.686 A:middle
done processing your

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:41.676 A:middle
notification data.

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:43.116 A:middle
And we'd know that everything is

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.326 A:middle
ready to be shown on screen.

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.166 A:middle
We encourage you to do only the

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.126 A:middle
work necessary to display the

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.176 A:middle
notification and to do it as

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:52.196 A:middle
quickly as possible.

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:56.516 A:middle
By the way, it's not necessary

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.896 A:middle
for the user to keep their wrist

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
up to see all the notifications

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
with the same thread ID as they

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
with the same thread ID as they

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:01.556 A:middle
come in.

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:03.736 A:middle
If you're handling grouping and

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:04.926 A:middle
the dynamic interface for your

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:06.596 A:middle
notification category, all the

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:08.116 A:middle
messages with the same thread ID

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:09.996 A:middle
will expand to a single platter

00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
when the user taps on the group

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
and Notification Center.

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:15.216 A:middle
And if additional messages on

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:16.646 A:middle
that thread come in, they'll be

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.306 A:middle
appended live is when the long

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:19.476 A:middle
look was first on screen.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:25.366 A:middle
So, here's a big one.

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.406 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, you can now bring

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:29.776 A:middle
some of your apps' functionality

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.446 A:middle
directly into the notifications

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.356 A:middle
you send by including elements

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:34.756 A:middle
that let the user interact with

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.306 A:middle
content in the notification

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:36.746 A:middle
itself.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.546 A:middle
For example, you could let a

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:42.136 A:middle
user pay for their ride and rate

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:44.096 A:middle
their driver, notify a user that

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:45.566 A:middle
their meter is about to expire,

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:46.456 A:middle
and let them extend their

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:48.616 A:middle
parking time, or give a diner an

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:50.516 A:middle
opportunity to not only confirm

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.086 A:middle
their dinner reservation, but to

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
let you know they'll be a party

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.356 A:middle
of three instead of four.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.676 A:middle
So, let's see how all this

00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:58.026 A:middle
works.

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.146 A:middle
If you're creating a new

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.146 A:middle
If you're creating a new

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:01.186 A:middle
notification interface

00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.676 A:middle
controller, a dynamic

00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:04.036 A:middle
interactive interface will be

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.606 A:middle
created for you automatically.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:09.326 A:middle
If you already have a dynamic

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:10.566 A:middle
interface for your notification

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
category, select the category in

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:13.876 A:middle
your Watch App's interface

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.536 A:middle
storyboard and check that has

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.446 A:middle
interactive interface box.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.666 A:middle
In both cases, you'll notice

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.136 A:middle
that the old dynamic interface

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:26.596 A:middle
is still there, in addition to

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:27.976 A:middle
the dynamic interactive one.

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:30.206 A:middle
The dynamic interface will be

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:31.606 A:middle
shown in WatchOS 5 when the

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.256 A:middle
notification first arrives, and

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:34.946 A:middle
now in Notification Center as

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:36.206 A:middle
well, as I mentioned before.

00:06:36.976 --> 00:06:38.906 A:middle
The dynamic interface will be

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:40.216 A:middle
shown in earlier versions of

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:41.786 A:middle
WatchOS so, you'll want to keep

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:42.956 A:middle
that one around for backwards

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:43.686 A:middle
compatibility.

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:47.846 A:middle
Once you have a dynamic

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:49.236 A:middle
interactive interface controller

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.316 A:middle
you can add buttons, switches

00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:52.566 A:middle
and other interactive elements

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:53.936 A:middle
in the object library, which is

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.286 A:middle
now available at the top of the

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:56.816 A:middle
screen as a popover menu.

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:02.006 A:middle
You can even add gesture

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:02.006 A:middle
You can even add gesture

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:02.946 A:middle
recognizers with your

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:04.526 A:middle
notification, though you should

00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:05.666 A:middle
be aware that the system

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:07.596 A:middle
gestures will take precedence

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:09.286 A:middle
over any gestures you add in the

00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
same areas.

00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:17.526 A:middle
Once you've designed your

00:07:17.526 --> 00:07:19.326 A:middle
notification interface wire up

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
the interactive elements to your

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.786 A:middle
code, the way you would any

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
other interactive element in

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.226 A:middle
your app.

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:26.426 A:middle
As you can see here, I'm

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.576 A:middle
dragging my IB action for up

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.456 A:middle
button tapped to the button in

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:31.546 A:middle
my dynamic interactive

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:32.096 A:middle
interface.

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:33.346 A:middle
So, the amount of time will

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.136 A:middle
increase by 15 minutes every

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:39.106 A:middle
time the button is tapped.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.626 A:middle
And with all this button tapping

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:42.186 A:middle
you may have already forgotten

00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:43.706 A:middle
that notifications have always

00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:45.036 A:middle
launched your app when tapped.

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:49.026 A:middle
This is still true for a regular

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.086 A:middle
dynamic and static

00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:51.146 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.066 A:middle
But, we obviously had to disable

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.476 A:middle
this behavior for dynamic

00:07:54.476 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
interactive notifications.

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:57.236 A:middle
Because we have interactive

00:07:57.236 --> 00:07:57.966 A:middle
elements in them now.

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
You can still launch your app

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
You can still launch your app

00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:01.256 A:middle
from an interactive

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:02.826 A:middle
notification, if you need to.

00:08:02.926 --> 00:08:03.906 A:middle
You just have to do it

00:08:03.906 --> 00:08:05.376 A:middle
explicitly by calling a new

00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:07.546 A:middle
method, performed notification

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:09.206 A:middle
default action.

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:13.216 A:middle
Similarly, if you include a

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:14.646 A:middle
button in your notification

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:16.126 A:middle
interface that should dismiss

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:17.356 A:middle
the notification after taking

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.536 A:middle
action, as in this case where

00:08:19.536 --> 00:08:20.836 A:middle
tapping the extend button should

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:22.216 A:middle
both commit the changes to my

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:23.716 A:middle
rental time and dismiss the

00:08:23.716 --> 00:08:25.736 A:middle
notification, you do this by

00:08:25.816 --> 00:08:27.576 A:middle
calling perform dismiss action

00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:29.216 A:middle
at the end of the IB action

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:31.466 A:middle
function associated with the

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:33.905 A:middle
button.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.366 A:middle
You could also process the

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.736 A:middle
changes made in the body of the

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:38.186 A:middle
notification using a standard

00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:38.916 A:middle
action button.

00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:40.535 A:middle
Since action buttons always

00:08:40.576 --> 00:08:41.676 A:middle
dismiss the notification.

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:44.966 A:middle
Wait, you're probably thinking,

00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:46.616 A:middle
action buttons are shared

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:47.846 A:middle
between all the notification

00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:48.656 A:middle
interfaces.

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:49.816 A:middle
And some of those buttons

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
wouldn't make sense if the

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:52.196 A:middle
interactive elements weren't

00:08:52.196 --> 00:08:52.526 A:middle
there.

00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:55.916 A:middle
Well, new in WatchOS 5, you can

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:57.426 A:middle
now adjust the action buttons

00:08:57.426 --> 00:08:58.756 A:middle
that are shown at runtime.

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:02.316 A:middle
There's a new notification

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:02.316 A:middle
There's a new notification

00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:03.516 A:middle
actions property on the

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:04.556 A:middle
notification interface

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:06.066 A:middle
controller that returns the

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:07.106 A:middle
array of actions that will be

00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:08.526 A:middle
displayed for the notification.

00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:10.646 A:middle
You can set this property to a

00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:12.756 A:middle
new array of UN notification

00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:14.286 A:middle
action objects in your did

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:15.636 A:middle
receive notification call back.

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:17.816 A:middle
which gives you the flexibility

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:19.606 A:middle
to add or remove buttons to suit

00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:20.836 A:middle
your interactive interface.

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:25.266 A:middle
And in an upcoming seed, we're

00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:26.426 A:middle
going to allow changes to

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:28.236 A:middle
actions any time after did

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:29.676 A:middle
receive notification is called.

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:30.936 A:middle
Which will give you the

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:32.646 A:middle
flexibility to change the action

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:34.376 A:middle
buttons based on how the user

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:35.776 A:middle
interacts with the elements in

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:36.916 A:middle
the interactive notification

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:37.386 A:middle
interface.

00:09:37.986 --> 00:09:42.276 A:middle
So, that's a lot of information

00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:43.986 A:middle
about notifications and the

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:45.156 A:middle
options for creating them so

00:09:45.156 --> 00:09:45.496 A:middle
far.

00:09:46.106 --> 00:09:48.246 A:middle
But I have two more things to

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:49.446 A:middle
tell you about before we move

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:50.366 A:middle
on.

00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:54.336 A:middle
Critical alerts are a new kind

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:55.606 A:middle
of notification that will cause

00:09:55.606 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
a prominent haptic and a sound

00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:59.166 A:middle
to play even when your Watch is

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
silenced or in do not disturb

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
silenced or in do not disturb

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:00.866 A:middle
mode.

00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:02.646 A:middle
And thus, they can be used to

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:03.896 A:middle
deliver extra urgent

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:04.606 A:middle
information.

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:07.336 A:middle
If your Watch app integrates

00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:09.186 A:middle
with a medical device or is used

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:10.986 A:middle
by emergency responders, this

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:12.446 A:middle
kind of alert might be for you.

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:15.716 A:middle
Critical alerts require an app

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:18.116 A:middle
entitlements and explicit

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:19.466 A:middle
permission to be granted by the

00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:20.806 A:middle
user separate from regular

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:21.536 A:middle
notification.

00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:26.166 A:middle
The opposite of a critical alert

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
is one that can be delivered

00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:27.996 A:middle
quietly.

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:29.856 A:middle
That is, rather than

00:10:29.856 --> 00:10:31.576 A:middle
interrupting the user with an in

00:10:31.576 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
the moment notification that

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.796 A:middle
takes over the screen, you can

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:36.486 A:middle
now choose to send notifications

00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:38.376 A:middle
directly to Notification Center.

00:10:39.256 --> 00:10:40.656 A:middle
You'll notice that no indicator

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:42.816 A:middle
will appear unless a prominently

00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:44.386 A:middle
delivered notification is also

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.476 A:middle
in Notification Center.

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:47.936 A:middle
But the swipe from the top of

00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:49.316 A:middle
the screen will still reveal the

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.866 A:middle
quietly delivered notification.

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:57.316 A:middle
If you choose to deliver

00:10:57.316 --> 00:10:59.296 A:middle
notifications quietly in your

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:01.636 A:middle
app, you don't have to prompt

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:01.636 A:middle
app, you don't have to prompt

00:11:01.636 --> 00:11:03.506 A:middle
the user to allow notifications

00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:05.016 A:middle
when the app is first launched.

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:07.286 A:middle
Instead, you can request

00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:08.516 A:middle
provisional permission.

00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:10.856 A:middle
This gives the user a chance to

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:12.556 A:middle
see what kinds of notifications

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.306 A:middle
your app sends before having to

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:15.826 A:middle
decide whether they want to see

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:19.426 A:middle
them as they arrive.

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:21.156 A:middle
Whichever option you choose as a

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.146 A:middle
developer, the user still has

00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:24.656 A:middle
ultimate control over how they

00:11:24.656 --> 00:11:26.106 A:middle
receive your notifications.

00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:28.026 A:middle
They can choose to deliver

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:30.256 A:middle
notifications quietly by swiping

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.716 A:middle
left from a notification in

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.546 A:middle
Notification Center or change

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:36.156 A:middle
their notification preferences

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:36.976 A:middle
in settings.

00:11:41.116 --> 00:11:43.906 A:middle
To sum up, notifications are now

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:44.616 A:middle
more dynamic.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.516 A:middle
Users will see your dynamic

00:11:46.516 --> 00:11:48.276 A:middle
interface from Notification

00:11:48.276 --> 00:11:50.076 A:middle
Center in addition to when the

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.276 A:middle
notification first arrives.

00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:53.726 A:middle
We're also offering grouping by

00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:55.656 A:middle
thread ID for the first time on

00:11:55.656 --> 00:11:56.046 A:middle
the Watch.

00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.796 A:middle
So, you can design notifications

00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
that behave like the ones like

00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
that behave like the ones like

00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
the built-in messages app.

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.086 A:middle
You can now bring more of your

00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:05.946 A:middle
app experience directly into the

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.746 A:middle
notification your app delivers

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.606 A:middle
with interactive controls and

00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:10.646 A:middle
action buttons that can be

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.566 A:middle
defined at runtime.

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:14.356 A:middle
And you can also choose to

00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:15.746 A:middle
deliver notifications with the

00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:17.346 A:middle
appropriate level of urgency.

00:12:18.636 --> 00:12:19.426 A:middle
To learn more about

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:23.256 A:middle
notifications you can attend one

00:12:23.256 --> 00:12:24.546 A:middle
of these sessions.

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.906 A:middle
I highly recommend Designing

00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.566 A:middle
Notifications, that will give

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:29.746 A:middle
you some great tips for how to

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:32.546 A:middle
design effective interactive

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:33.406 A:middle
notifications.

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.766 A:middle
Okay, now that we have your

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:40.286 A:middle
user's attention with

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.326 A:middle
notifications, let's turn our

00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:44.086 A:middle
attention to the features we're

00:12:44.086 --> 00:12:45.546 A:middle
adding to make your Watch apps

00:12:45.546 --> 00:12:46.136 A:middle
more awesome.

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:48.996 A:middle
The first has to do with local

00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:49.756 A:middle
audio playback.

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.346 A:middle
Some of you have already made

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:55.116 A:middle
forays into audio playback on

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.726 A:middle
the Watch by taking advantage of

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:58.216 A:middle
URL session for downloading

00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.116 A:middle
files to the Watch.

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:01.526 A:middle
And WK audio file queue player

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:01.526 A:middle
And WK audio file queue player

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:02.076 A:middle
to play them.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.216 A:middle
With WatchOS 5, we're going to

00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:06.776 A:middle
make developing audio apps for

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:08.626 A:middle
the Watch even easier, and the

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:10.196 A:middle
resulting experiences more

00:13:10.196 --> 00:13:10.706 A:middle
delightful.

00:13:13.036 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, we're offering a

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.866 A:middle
new background mode for playing

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:17.906 A:middle
local audio files.

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:20.106 A:middle
So, you can now focus on your

00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:22.396 A:middle
app's main purpose, audio,

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.326 A:middle
rather than trying to figure out

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:26.206 A:middle
how to build something else like

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:28.236 A:middle
a workout app just to be able to

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:28.836 A:middle
play audio.

00:13:30.516 --> 00:13:34.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.396 A:middle
We also exposed AVAudio player

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:39.276 A:middle
and AVAudioEngine directly,

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:40.966 A:middle
which means you can use the same

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.126 A:middle
methods and properties you're

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.716 A:middle
already familiar with if you've

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.556 A:middle
been building iOS apps that play

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:45.956 A:middle
audio.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.536 A:middle
In fact, you can share your code

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.216 A:middle
between your iOS app and your

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:51.536 A:middle
Watch app by moving your

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:52.796 A:middle
playback related code to a

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:53.286 A:middle
framework.

00:13:53.946 --> 00:13:56.256 A:middle
One thing that's different from

00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.446 A:middle
iOS, is that playing longform

00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
audio on the Watch requires

00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
audio on the Watch requires

00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:02.796 A:middle
headphones or an external

00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:05.276 A:middle
speaker to be connected just as

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:06.336 A:middle
when playing from the built-in

00:14:06.336 --> 00:14:06.746 A:middle
music app.

00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:09.646 A:middle
For this reason, Bluetooth

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:11.106 A:middle
routing is part of the session

00:14:11.186 --> 00:14:12.316 A:middle
activation process.

00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:13.686 A:middle
If you set your route sharing

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.486 A:middle
policy to longform, as you

00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:18.136 A:middle
should, will automatically

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:19.796 A:middle
connect to the headphones with

00:14:19.796 --> 00:14:21.536 A:middle
Apple wireless chip, like

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:24.296 A:middle
AirPods or Beats Studio3, if

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.086 A:middle
they're already in use.

00:14:25.706 --> 00:14:27.336 A:middle
Or, will show a route picker to

00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:28.776 A:middle
let the user choose other

00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:30.376 A:middle
headphones or Bluetooth speakers

00:14:30.776 --> 00:14:32.346 A:middle
when you call the activate with

00:14:32.346 --> 00:14:33.846 A:middle
options completion API in a

00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:34.916 A:middle
session that's new.

00:14:38.266 --> 00:14:39.886 A:middle
You could also use the MP now

00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:41.496 A:middle
playing info center API to

00:14:41.566 --> 00:14:42.996 A:middle
populate the now playing app

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:44.846 A:middle
with information about what your

00:14:44.846 --> 00:14:45.636 A:middle
app is playing.

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:47.846 A:middle
Which means your apps info will

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.136 A:middle
show in the now playing

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:49.986 A:middle
complication.

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:54.476 A:middle
And you can handle the media

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:55.746 A:middle
remote commands that make sense

00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:57.496 A:middle
for your app; from play and

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:00.366 A:middle
pause, to next and previous, to

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:00.366 A:middle
pause, to next and previous, to

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.966 A:middle
even like and dislike.

00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
And last, but not least, it's

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.136 A:middle
now possible to control the

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:10.006 A:middle
volume from your custom playback

00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
UI with the new volume control

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:12.436 A:middle
view.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:14.846 A:middle
Available in the object library

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:15.706 A:middle
and interface builder.

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:19.226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:21.216 A:middle
The control automatically takes

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.656 A:middle
on the tint color of your app

00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:24.626 A:middle
when at rest and responds with

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.016 A:middle
the color changes you're used to

00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.656 A:middle
from the system volume control

00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
when turning the digital crown.

00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:34.086 A:middle
There's a whole session devoted

00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:35.546 A:middle
to creating audio apps for

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:38.066 A:middle
WatchOS which I highly encourage

00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:39.816 A:middle
you to attend to get more

00:15:39.816 --> 00:15:41.746 A:middle
details about the new APIs and

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.286 A:middle
best practices for working with

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:43.676 A:middle
audio.

00:15:43.816 --> 00:15:45.586 A:middle
And we'll also be prepared to

00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:47.056 A:middle
talk about background audio at

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:48.356 A:middle
the WatchOS runtime and

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.836 A:middle
conductivity lab on Thursday.

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:54.166 A:middle
If the primary function of your

00:15:54.416 --> 00:15:55.976 A:middle
app isn't playing audio, but

00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:57.226 A:middle
your app would benefit from

00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:58.736 A:middle
being able to control audio

00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
playing elsewhere on a system,

00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
playing elsewhere on a system,

00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:01.836 A:middle
whether it's on a Watch or on

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.476 A:middle
phone, as in the workout app,

00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:06.236 A:middle
where you can swipe left during

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.466 A:middle
a workout to see now playing

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:07.946 A:middle
controls.

00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:09.936 A:middle
You'll be happy to hear that

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.196 A:middle
were exposing a now playing view

00:16:12.196 --> 00:16:14.956 A:middle
that you can embed in your apps.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:17.886 A:middle
You can find the now playing

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:19.186 A:middle
view in the object library in

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.066 A:middle
interface builder.

00:16:20.926 --> 00:16:22.086 A:middle
It's designed to fill the

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:22.786 A:middle
screen.

00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:24.496 A:middle
So, it works best in apps with

00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:25.356 A:middle
page layouts.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:27.856 A:middle
Note that the now playing view

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:29.376 A:middle
is a systemwide control that's

00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:31.076 A:middle
meant to control audio coming

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:31.966 A:middle
from other apps.

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:33.356 A:middle
So, it will show whatever the

00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:34.736 A:middle
user is currently listening to,

00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:36.186 A:middle
whether it's on Apple Watch or

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:37.216 A:middle
iPhone.

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:41.396 A:middle
While we're here, I want to

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.476 A:middle
point out a couple of other new

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:43.796 A:middle
options and one change in

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:44.446 A:middle
behavior.

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:47.236 A:middle
In previous versions of WatchOS,

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
if you added a 38-millimeter

00:16:49.236 --> 00:16:50.826 A:middle
asset but forgot to add the same

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:52.346 A:middle
asset for a 42-millimeter

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.186 A:middle
device, the asset would be

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:55.936 A:middle
missing on the larger device.

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:58.236 A:middle
Now it will automatically fall

00:16:58.236 --> 00:16:59.946 A:middle
back to the 38 millimeter size

00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:01.726 A:middle
if the 42 millimeter size is

00:17:01.726 --> 00:17:02.136 A:middle
missing.

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:05.915 A:middle
But you can skip worrying about

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:07.336 A:middle
providing assets of different

00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:09.486 A:middle
sizes altogether by instead

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:12.046 A:middle
adding a PDF in the universal

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:13.935 A:middle
selection of your asset catalog

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:16.086 A:middle
and setting the new auto scaling

00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:17.695 A:middle
option to automatic.

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:25.246 A:middle
This will cause the right sized

00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:26.606 A:middle
asset to show up at the right

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:30.466 A:middle
place at the right time.

00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:32.186 A:middle
We've also exposed the title

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:34.106 A:middle
textiles in the font menu to

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:35.206 A:middle
give you more options for

00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.566 A:middle
differentiating your text within

00:17:37.566 --> 00:17:38.306 A:middle
your interfaces.

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:40.926 A:middle
These textiles are compatible

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.006 A:middle
with dynamic type, so they'll

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:44.436 A:middle
increase or decrease.

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.896 A:middle
They'll scale up and down, as

00:17:45.896 --> 00:17:47.336 A:middle
the user changes their font size

00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:47.866 A:middle
in settings.

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:51.786 A:middle
And the large title style is

00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:53.196 A:middle
available in both interface

00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.386 A:middle
builder and as an API.

00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:59.906 A:middle
Since I'm in the process of

00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
building an app for skating

00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
building an app for skating

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:02.676 A:middle
workouts, now would be a good

00:18:02.726 --> 00:18:03.596 A:middle
time to talk about the

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:04.866 A:middle
improvements we're making to

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.306 A:middle
workouts in WatchOS 5.

00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:08.726 A:middle
We completely rewrote the

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:10.636 A:middle
workout API in this release to

00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:12.816 A:middle
make it simpler, more reliable,

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:13.776 A:middle
and more resilient.

00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:16.096 A:middle
And we've moved the built-in

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.386 A:middle
workout app to use it.

00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:19.676 A:middle
We're hoping you'll move your

00:18:19.676 --> 00:18:23.246 A:middle
fitness apps to it to.

00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:24.956 A:middle
It's now easier than ever to

00:18:24.956 --> 00:18:26.526 A:middle
start a workout and collect the

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.116 A:middle
right data with a new

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:30.116 A:middle
initializer from HK workout

00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:33.556 A:middle
session and the new workout

00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:34.076 A:middle
builder API.

00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:37.536 A:middle
You create the workout session,

00:18:38.256 --> 00:18:39.586 A:middle
get the builder from the session

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:41.326 A:middle
and start collecting data.

00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:42.846 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.476 A:middle
This is what it looks like in

00:18:47.236 --> 00:18:47.346 A:middle
code.

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.776 A:middle
You create and configure the

00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:50.326 A:middle
session with a health store and

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.186 A:middle
a workout configuration, which

00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:54.046 A:middle
includes the activity type.

00:18:54.656 --> 00:18:56.926 A:middle
Grab the HK live workout builder

00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:57.876 A:middle
that's associated with the

00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
session and begin collection.

00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
session and begin collection.

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:03.106 A:middle
The relevant data for the

00:19:03.106 --> 00:19:04.566 A:middle
workout type will be collected

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.536 A:middle
automatically, even across

00:19:06.676 --> 00:19:08.756 A:middle
pauses and resumes, to give you

00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:10.956 A:middle
a correct and consistent HK

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:12.926 A:middle
workout artifact with a correct

00:19:12.926 --> 00:19:13.746 A:middle
elapsed time.

00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:18.066 A:middle
And because no app is perfect,

00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:20.256 A:middle
if your fitness app crashes

00:19:20.256 --> 00:19:21.766 A:middle
during an active workout session

00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:22.966 A:middle
it will automatically be

00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:23.626 A:middle
relaunched.

00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:27.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:30.176 A:middle
Just use the HK health store

00:19:30.176 --> 00:19:31.886 A:middle
recover active workout session

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:35.216 A:middle
API and the session and builder

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.416 A:middle
will be restored in their

00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:37.136 A:middle
previous state.

00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:42.066 A:middle
To learn even more about the new

00:19:42.066 --> 00:19:44.106 A:middle
workout APIs, as well as options

00:19:44.106 --> 00:19:44.976 A:middle

technology lab tomorrow

00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:51.706 A:middle
afternoon.

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:57.396 A:middle
Next up, your apps now have a

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.106 A:middle
place on the Siri Watch face

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.186 A:middle
with Siri Shortcuts.

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.186 A:middle
with Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:03.486 A:middle
As you saw on the keynote, Siri

00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:04.756 A:middle
Shortcuts are meant to help

00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:06.286 A:middle
users accomplish tasks that they

00:20:06.286 --> 00:20:08.156 A:middle
perform frequently with more

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:09.356 A:middle
ease than ever before.

00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.976 A:middle
And the Siri Watch face surfaces

00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:14.376 A:middle
these, the common tasks, at the

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:16.176 A:middle
right place and time with a

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:17.846 A:middle
little input from you as app

00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:18.466 A:middle
developers.

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:20.986 A:middle
I want to focus on how to use

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.566 A:middle
shortcuts to make a great Watch

00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:23.826 A:middle
experience and how that

00:20:23.826 --> 00:20:25.506 A:middle
experience differs depending on

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:26.406 A:middle
whether your Watch app is

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:26.896 A:middle
installed.

00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.996 A:middle
First, a few words about what

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:31.866 A:middle
makes a good shortcut.

00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:35.006 A:middle
As the name implies, shortcuts

00:20:35.006 --> 00:20:36.396 A:middle
are about helping Watch users

00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.476 A:middle
see useful information and

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:40.006 A:middle
perform common tasks quickly.

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:41.916 A:middle
Whether it's launching your app

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.096 A:middle
to a specific screen with

00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:45.326 A:middle
options preselected, or getting

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:47.116 A:middle
to the awesome outcome your app

00:20:47.116 --> 00:20:48.716 A:middle
enables, such as ordering your

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.576 A:middle
morning coffee, booking a fine

00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:52.496 A:middle
dining reservation, or re-upping

00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:53.466 A:middle
your chocolate supply.

00:20:54.716 --> 00:20:55.826 A:middle
Think about glanceable

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:57.496 A:middle
information and one or two tap

00:20:57.496 --> 00:20:58.206 A:middle
interactions.

00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
Shortcuts can be user activity

00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
Shortcuts can be user activity

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:04.376 A:middle
based, or intent based.

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.406 A:middle
User activity based shortcuts

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:07.676 A:middle
are great for when the goal is

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:08.666 A:middle
to launch your app with a

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:10.976 A:middle
specific context, such as

00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:12.376 A:middle
navigating straight to a screen

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:13.716 A:middle
where the user can log a meal

00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:15.116 A:middle
they've eaten, or in this case,

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:15.666 A:middle
delivered.

00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.126 A:middle
Intent based shortcuts make more

00:21:20.186 --> 00:21:21.446 A:middle
sense for tasks that don't

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.916 A:middle
necessarily require your app to

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:23.476 A:middle
be launched.

00:21:23.876 --> 00:21:25.006 A:middle
Such as placing your regular

00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:25.716 A:middle
coffee order.

00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:27.816 A:middle
If your shortcut is

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:29.776 A:middle
intent-based, when the user taps

00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:30.836 A:middle
your shortcut platter on the

00:21:30.836 --> 00:21:32.516 A:middle
Siri face, they'll receive a

00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:33.766 A:middle
quick confirmation screen.

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:35.836 A:middle
Did you mean to order that

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:36.166 A:middle
coffee?

00:21:37.186 --> 00:21:38.236 A:middle
If the intent supports

00:21:38.236 --> 00:21:40.026 A:middle
background execution, it will

00:21:40.026 --> 00:21:41.166 A:middle
run without launching the app,

00:21:41.666 --> 00:21:42.696 A:middle
when the user confirms.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:44.936 A:middle
Otherwise, the confirmation will

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.486 A:middle
launch or restore the app and

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.126 A:middle
hand it your intent.

00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:51.636 A:middle
How the user has interacted with

00:21:51.636 --> 00:21:52.976 A:middle
your app in the past is taken

00:21:52.976 --> 00:21:54.396 A:middle
into account when predicting

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:55.566 A:middle
what shortcuts to show.

00:21:56.306 --> 00:21:57.966 A:middle
You should donate intense or

00:21:57.966 --> 00:21:59.336 A:middle
user activities as the user

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.756 A:middle
performs the main functions of

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.756 A:middle
performs the main functions of

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:02.186 A:middle
your app.

00:22:02.186 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
For example, an audio app like

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:05.876 A:middle
Audible would donate an IN

00:22:05.876 --> 00:22:07.646 A:middle
media, play media intent when

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.466 A:middle
the user starts or resumes

00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:13.836 A:middle
playing an audiobook.

00:22:13.946 --> 00:22:15.576 A:middle
Shortcut surface on the Siri

00:22:15.576 --> 00:22:17.256 A:middle
Watch face based on relevance

00:22:17.606 --> 00:22:19.136 A:middle
with the most relevant items

00:22:19.136 --> 00:22:20.426 A:middle
appearing at the top of the up

00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.486 A:middle
next section and less relevant

00:22:22.486 --> 00:22:24.886 A:middle
ones at the bottom.

00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:26.386 A:middle
Previous user interactions

00:22:26.476 --> 00:22:28.736 A:middle
intense performed or donated and

00:22:28.736 --> 00:22:29.856 A:middle
user activities that have been

00:22:29.856 --> 00:22:32.216 A:middle
marked both eligible for search

00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:33.846 A:middle
and eligible for prediction

00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.556 A:middle
inform relevance.

00:22:36.176 --> 00:22:37.506 A:middle
But to appear on the Siri Watch

00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:38.956 A:middle
face, you must also give the

00:22:38.956 --> 00:22:41.246 A:middle
system explicit hints about when

00:22:41.246 --> 00:22:42.726 A:middle
or where a shortcut is relevant

00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:44.486 A:middle
by creating a relevant shortcut.

00:22:46.776 --> 00:22:48.726 A:middle
A relevant shortcut consists of

00:22:48.726 --> 00:22:50.236 A:middle
a user activity or intent-based

00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:52.806 A:middle
Siri shortcut, an optional Watch

00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:54.326 A:middle
template that defines the title,

00:22:54.496 --> 00:22:56.116 A:middle
subtitle, and image that should

00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:57.546 A:middle
appear in the shortcut platter,

00:22:57.546 --> 00:22:59.266 A:middle
and an array of relevance

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:00.906 A:middle
providers that define the time,

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:00.906 A:middle
providers that define the time,

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.426 A:middle
location or situation in which

00:23:03.426 --> 00:23:04.576 A:middle
your shortcut would be most

00:23:04.576 --> 00:23:05.076 A:middle
relevant.

00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:08.896 A:middle
We've already talked about user

00:23:08.896 --> 00:23:10.146 A:middle
activity and intent-based

00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:11.736 A:middle
shortcuts, so let's talk about

00:23:11.736 --> 00:23:12.956 A:middle
the other two components of a

00:23:12.956 --> 00:23:13.846 A:middle
relevant shortcut.

00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:18.276 A:middle
A Watch template is an optional

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:20.256 A:middle
IN default card template, that

00:23:20.256 --> 00:23:22.276 A:middle
consists of a title, an optional

00:23:22.376 --> 00:23:24.146 A:middle
title, and an optional image.

00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:26.856 A:middle
If you don't provide a Watch

00:23:26.856 --> 00:23:27.926 A:middle
template, we'll pull the

00:23:27.926 --> 00:23:29.446 A:middle
necessary information from the

00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:31.416 A:middle
IN shortcut, but you should take

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:32.956 A:middle
the opportunity to provide

00:23:32.956 --> 00:23:34.996 A:middle
informative strings so the user

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.696 A:middle
understands what they get when

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:37.826 A:middle
they tap your platter.

00:23:38.466 --> 00:23:42.606 A:middle
A relevance provider focuses on

00:23:42.606 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
the date, location or situation

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.686 A:middle
in which the shortcut would be

00:23:45.686 --> 00:23:46.556 A:middle
most valuable.

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:49.506 A:middle
Think about when and where your

00:23:49.506 --> 00:23:50.576 A:middle
shortcut would be relevant.

00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:52.396 A:middle
Is it something the user might

00:23:52.396 --> 00:23:54.506 A:middle
glance at or tap on at any time

00:23:54.506 --> 00:23:55.106 A:middle
during the day?

00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:57.436 A:middle
Is it relevant at a specific

00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
date and time, or is it based on

00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
date and time, or is it based on

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:00.886 A:middle
location?

00:24:01.456 --> 00:24:04.356 A:middle
Since a relevant shortcut takes

00:24:04.356 --> 00:24:05.856 A:middle
an array of relevance providers

00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:07.836 A:middle
it's possible to specify more

00:24:07.836 --> 00:24:08.576 A:middle
than one kind.

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:10.636 A:middle
For example, if your shortcut

00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:12.196 A:middle
would be relevant at both a time

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:15.536 A:middle
and a place.

00:24:15.706 --> 00:24:17.696 A:middle
Again, these relevant providers

00:24:17.696 --> 00:24:19.176 A:middle
act as hints to the system.

00:24:19.656 --> 00:24:21.086 A:middle
As the user interacts with your

00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:23.136 A:middle
content, actual usage will

00:24:23.136 --> 00:24:24.136 A:middle
inform its placement.

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.426 A:middle
If the user fails to interact

00:24:26.426 --> 00:24:27.426 A:middle
with shortcuts that appear on

00:24:27.426 --> 00:24:30.526 A:middle
the Siri face, they'll drop in

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:32.846 A:middle
relevance.

00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:34.016 A:middle
Once you have relevant

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:35.686 A:middle
shortcuts, the next step is to

00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:36.896 A:middle
supply them to the relevant

00:24:36.896 --> 00:24:38.526 A:middle
shortcut store so they can be

00:24:38.526 --> 00:24:39.876 A:middle
considered for the Siri Watch

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:40.216 A:middle
face.

00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:42.596 A:middle
Relevant shortcuts can be

00:24:42.596 --> 00:24:44.776 A:middle
supplied by both your iOS app

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:47.036 A:middle
and your Watch app.

00:24:47.036 --> 00:24:48.476 A:middle
iOS relevant shortcuts are

00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:50.136 A:middle
synced periodically from iPhone

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:51.966 A:middle
Apple Watch and they're merged

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:53.546 A:middle
into consideration with the

00:24:53.546 --> 00:24:54.646 A:middle
Watch relevant shortcuts.

00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:57.536 A:middle
If your Watch app supports the

00:24:57.636 --> 00:24:59.366 A:middle
iOS shortcut, the Watch app

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.516 A:middle
handles execution.

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.516 A:middle
handles execution.

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.876 A:middle
If it doesn't, or if the Watch

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:05.346 A:middle
app is not installed, the

00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:07.536 A:middle
shortcut executes on the phone,

00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:08.426 A:middle
over Internet.

00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:13.146 A:middle
A subset of relevant shortcuts

00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:14.516 A:middle
can surface on the Siri Watch

00:25:14.516 --> 00:25:16.736 A:middle
face, without Watch OS support.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.606 A:middle
If they are intent-based

00:25:19.676 --> 00:25:21.566 A:middle
shortcuts that support running

00:25:21.566 --> 00:25:23.516 A:middle
in the background and can run

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:24.796 A:middle
without accessing encrypted

00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:26.326 A:middle
data, which is separate from

00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:26.576 A:middle
off.

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
Again, these shortcuts are going

00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:31.436 A:middle
to execute on iPhone over

00:25:31.436 --> 00:25:31.716 A:middle
Internet.

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:34.396 A:middle
The richest experience for users

00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:35.686 A:middle
will always be with a Watch app

00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:36.916 A:middle
that can handle the shortcut

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:39.386 A:middle
locally, either by launching the

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:41.076 A:middle
app or by executing the intent

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:44.256 A:middle
in the background.

00:25:44.326 --> 00:25:45.496 A:middle
You'll want to update your

00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
relevant shortcuts periodically.

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:49.026 A:middle
If the user launches your app,

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:51.066 A:middle
for example, by tapping one of

00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:52.446 A:middle
your shortcuts on the Siri face,

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:54.396 A:middle
you'll have the run time to

00:25:54.396 --> 00:25:55.426 A:middle
accomplish the update.

00:25:56.456 --> 00:25:57.606 A:middle
But shortcuts that provide

00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:59.146 A:middle
glanceable data are useful to

00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
the user without launching the

00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
the user without launching the

00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:00.566 A:middle
app.

00:26:01.216 --> 00:26:02.706 A:middle
Think about the carrot whether

00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:03.986 A:middle
example from a couple slides

00:26:03.986 --> 00:26:05.496 A:middle
ago, were you could tell that it

00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.666 A:middle
was 72 degrees and cloudy just

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.676 A:middle
by looking at the platter.

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:09.626 A:middle
You didn't have to tap.

00:26:11.246 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
To help with this case, we added

00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:15.366 A:middle
a background refresh task called

00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:16.666 A:middle
WKRelevantShortcut

00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:18.056 A:middle
RefreshBackgroundTask.

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:20.986 A:middle
When you get this task before

00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:22.836 A:middle
sure to check if your data needs

00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:24.956 A:middle
to be updated and then supply

00:26:24.956 --> 00:26:25.956 A:middle
new relevant shortcuts.

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:29.486 A:middle
We factor in user engagement

00:26:29.486 --> 00:26:30.986 A:middle
when scheduling these background

00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:34.256 A:middle
tasks and glances count as

00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:34.736 A:middle
engagement.

00:26:38.456 --> 00:26:40.086 A:middle
If you have an intent-based

00:26:40.086 --> 00:26:41.696 A:middle
shortcut, your intent might

00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
update applications when it

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:45.066 A:middle
executes in the background.

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.516 A:middle
Since the intents extension is

00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:50.026 A:middle
in a separate process from your

00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:51.906 A:middle
Watch Kit extension, we're now

00:26:51.906 --> 00:26:53.346 A:middle
supplying a new refresh

00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:54.756 A:middle
background task called

00:26:54.816 --> 00:26:56.616 A:middle
WKIntentDidRun

00:26:56.696 --> 00:26:58.856 A:middle
RefreshBackgroundTask to let

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
your main extension run and

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
your main extension run and

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:02.886 A:middle
update any snapshots or

00:27:02.886 --> 00:27:04.466 A:middle
complications that may be stale

00:27:04.466 --> 00:27:06.086 A:middle
after your intent executed.

00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:10.356 A:middle
Now that you have your shortcuts

00:27:10.356 --> 00:27:11.606 A:middle
available at the turn of the

00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:14.436 A:middle
wrist and a tap, you should know

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:15.816 A:middle
that users can set up shortcut

00:27:15.816 --> 00:27:17.226 A:middle
phrases on the phone and use

00:27:17.226 --> 00:27:18.546 A:middle
them to execute your shortcuts

00:27:18.546 --> 00:27:19.236 A:middle
at any time.

00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:21.666 A:middle
These shortcut phrases are

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:22.856 A:middle
synced to Apple Watch.

00:27:22.856 --> 00:27:25.286 A:middle
So, you can use raise to speak

00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:27.936 A:middle
to say, for example, mint me up

00:27:28.896 --> 00:27:30.356 A:middle
and kick of an order of a mint

00:27:30.356 --> 00:27:31.626 A:middle
mojito from Phil's Coffee.

00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:34.556 A:middle
Your shortcut platter does not

00:27:34.556 --> 00:27:35.906 A:middle
need to be showing on the Siri

00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:37.756 A:middle
Watch face for your shortcuts to

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
be invoked with a shortcut

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:39.446 A:middle
phrase.

00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:44.176 A:middle
So, in summary, use Siri

00:27:44.176 --> 00:27:45.556 A:middle
shortcuts to provide relevant

00:27:45.556 --> 00:27:46.836 A:middle
information and quick

00:27:46.836 --> 00:27:48.246 A:middle
interactions to your users.

00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:51.056 A:middle
Create relevant shortcuts on

00:27:51.056 --> 00:27:53.376 A:middle
both iPhone and Apple Watch and

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:54.576 A:middle
add them to the shortcut store

00:27:54.576 --> 00:27:55.796 A:middle
so they can be considered for

00:27:55.796 --> 00:27:56.776 A:middle
the Siri Watch face.

00:27:57.646 --> 00:27:59.536 A:middle
And finally, your users will

00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:01.146 A:middle
have the best experience with a

00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:01.146 A:middle
have the best experience with a

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:03.016 A:middle
WatchOS app where they'll be

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:04.176 A:middle
able to do more with your

00:28:04.176 --> 00:28:05.716 A:middle
shortcuts directly on the Watch.

00:28:07.536 --> 00:28:10.466 A:middle
For more on Siri shortcuts, I

00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:11.846 A:middle
recommend checking out one of

00:28:11.846 --> 00:28:13.506 A:middle
these sessions or labs,

00:28:14.356 --> 00:28:16.336 A:middle
especially the one about Siri

00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:18.016 A:middle
shortcuts on the Siri Watch

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:19.286 A:middle
face, which will go into much

00:28:19.286 --> 00:28:20.696 A:middle
more detail about the APIs I

00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:24.916 A:middle
covered today.

00:28:25.076 --> 00:28:26.396 A:middle
So, we covered a lot of ground

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:26.736 A:middle
today.

00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:28.566 A:middle
Here's what we talked about.

00:28:29.336 --> 00:28:30.206 A:middle
We want you to make your

00:28:30.206 --> 00:28:31.946 A:middle
notifications more engaging and

00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:34.256 A:middle
actionable by creating dynamic

00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:36.626 A:middle
interactive interfaces for your

00:28:36.626 --> 00:28:37.366 A:middle
notifications.

00:28:38.596 --> 00:28:40.436 A:middle
You can now bring audio into the

00:28:40.436 --> 00:28:42.396 A:middle
background with AV foundation

00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:44.656 A:middle
APIs, media remote commands and

00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:46.106 A:middle
access to now playing info.

00:28:47.466 --> 00:28:48.746 A:middle
You can make your fitness apps

00:28:48.746 --> 00:28:50.256 A:middle
more robust and reliable with

00:28:50.256 --> 00:28:51.576 A:middle
the new workout builder API.

00:28:52.966 --> 00:28:54.506 A:middle
And you can provide value on the

00:28:54.506 --> 00:28:56.306 A:middle
Siri Watch face by creating

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.276 A:middle
relevant shortcuts.

00:28:57.996 --> 00:29:01.556 A:middle
If you have any questions about

00:28:57.996 --> 00:29:01.556 A:middle
If you have any questions about

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:03.426 A:middle
what you've heard today what you

00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:05.526 A:middle
built for Watch OS so far, or

00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:06.706 A:middle
what you're going to build next

00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:08.246 A:middle
come visit us in the labs.

00:29:08.726 --> 00:29:09.836 A:middle
We'd love to see what you're

00:29:09.836 --> 00:29:10.376 A:middle
working on.

00:29:11.056 --> 00:29:12.666 A:middle
Thank you for coming and have a

00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:13.826 A:middle
great WWDC.

00:29:14.516 --> 00:29:17.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
