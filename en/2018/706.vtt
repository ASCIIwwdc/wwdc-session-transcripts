[ Applause ]

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:31.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, I'm Jason

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:32.986 A:middle
Morley, a software engineer on

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.406 A:middle
the Health Team here at Apple.

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.306 A:middle
And along with my colleague

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.176 A:middle
Peyton I'd like to take some

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:39.576 A:middle
time to introduce you to an

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.606 A:middle
exciting new feature we have in

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:44.686 A:middle
iOS 12 this year, access to

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:46.546 A:middle
health records with HealthKit.

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:52.136 A:middle
Earlier this year in iOS 11.3 we

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:53.746 A:middle
introduced Health Records and

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:54.106 A:middle
Health.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:56.586 A:middle
Users can connect to their

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.426 A:middle
healthcare institutions and

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:00.186 A:middle
securely download their health

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:00.186 A:middle
securely download their health

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:02.716 A:middle
records for quick access and

00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:03.496 A:middle
safekeeping.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:07.006 A:middle
We aggregate data from multiple

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.756 A:middle
healthcare institutions and

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.246 A:middle
present it in a timeline

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.676 A:middle
allowing users to search and

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.186 A:middle
surfacing important details like

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:17.486 A:middle
lab values and reference ranges

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:19.226 A:middle
really helping users to better

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:22.000 A:middle
understand their health data.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:25.986 A:middle
As of today we have support for

00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:28.616 A:middle
more than 500 US hospitals and

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.466 A:middle
clinics covering over 50

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:33.796 A:middle
healthcare institutions and we

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:38.926 A:middle
are continuing to add more.

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.096 A:middle
Of course this wouldn't be

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:41.786 A:middle
possible without the fantastic

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:43.896 A:middle
standards work of the Health

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:46.846 A:middle
Level Seven organization with

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:48.156 A:middle
their fast healthcare

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:50.046 A:middle
interoperability resources or

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.766 A:middle
FHIR and the Smart health IT

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.306 A:middle
project.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.226 A:middle
For us it all starts with

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.156 A:middle
health, we establish a secure

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.156 A:middle
health, we establish a secure

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.586 A:middle
connection to healthcare

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:07.176 A:middle
institutions and download users'

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:09.496 A:middle
health records in FHIR direct to

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.675 A:middle
their iOS devices.

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:14.816 A:middle
From here we it store securely

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:18.266 A:middle
in HealthKit and aggregate data

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.076 A:middle
across multiple institutions.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:24.986 A:middle
Starting today in iOS 12 we are

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:26.986 A:middle
providing APIs to allow you to

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.916 A:middle
access this data and work with

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:30.000 A:middle
it in your apps.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:36.846 A:middle
First, I'm going to introduce

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.536 A:middle
the new sample types that we've

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:39.956 A:middle
added to support this feature.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:42.916 A:middle
Then we can see how you

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:44.766 A:middle
authorize your application and

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.000 A:middle
query for data.

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:49.556 A:middle
After that, I'll take a brief

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.286 A:middle
dive into FHIR and show you

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:52.876 A:middle
what's possible here.

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.706 A:middle
And finally, we can take some

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:58.336 A:middle
time to think about how you can

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.606 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.606 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
in this sensitive domain.

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:06.116 A:middle
So let's jump right in.

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:10.086 A:middle
If you've used HealthKit before

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.766 A:middle
you may be familiar with

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:14.246 A:middle
HKSampleType and its subclasses.

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.696 A:middle
These group similar types of

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.336 A:middle
data, for example QuantityType

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:22.846 A:middle
groups data represented by a

00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
single numerical value, things

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:27.396 A:middle
like step count and heart rate.

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:30.416 A:middle
While CategoryType groups data

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:32.336 A:middle
characterized by enumeration,

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
things like sleep analysis, am I

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:37.936 A:middle
in bed or asleep or menstrual

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:39.636 A:middle
flow, heavy or light.

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:43.506 A:middle
And to support Health Records

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:46.256 A:middle
we're introducing HKClinicalType

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.026 A:middle
which groups the categories of

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
health records that you see in

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.286 A:middle
Health, things like conditions

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:52.976 A:middle
and medications.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:58.116 A:middle
Within each of these sample

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.076 A:middle
types the different data types

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.076 A:middle
types the different data types

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:01.876 A:middle
are differentiated by a type

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:02.576 A:middle
identifier.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.886 A:middle
HKClinicalType identifier

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.246 A:middle
identifies the clinical types

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:10.316 A:middle
that correspond with the

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.806 A:middle
categories of Health Records and

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:13.796 A:middle
Health.

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:18.805 A:middle
We have allergies, conditions,

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:20.236 A:middle
these might be short-term

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.446 A:middle
conditions such as pregnancy or

00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:24.346 A:middle
ongoing conditions like type II

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:28.606 A:middle
diabetes, immunizations, lab

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:32.086 A:middle
results, these might be my blood

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:33.476 A:middle
glucose measurement for my

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:34.246 A:middle
annual physical.

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:40.216 A:middle
Medications, procedures, a

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:41.966 A:middle
diagnostic procedure or a

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:42.586 A:middle
surgery.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.216 A:middle
And vital signs, things like

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:50.336 A:middle
blood pressure or weight.

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:52.856 A:middle
Alongside these sample types and

00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:54.656 A:middle
sample type identifiers, we're

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.936 A:middle
also introducing a new HK sample

00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:59.926 A:middle
subclass HKClinicalRecord.

00:05:01.416 --> 00:05:02.746 A:middle
If you're not familiar with

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:04.206 A:middle
working with samples in

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.376 A:middle
HealthKit we have a number of

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.006 A:middle
talks that cover this topic and

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
I'll provide details of these at

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:11.026 A:middle
the end.

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:14.636 A:middle
There are a few key properties

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:16.066 A:middle
you'll be working with on

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.426 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord.

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.476 A:middle
The clinical type, we looked at

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.466 A:middle
this earlier and this allows you

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
to determine the type of a given

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:26.726 A:middle
record.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.936 A:middle
I want to know that a health

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:31.146 A:middle
record is for example an

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
immunization.

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:36.866 A:middle
We provide a display name which

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:38.566 A:middle
is a string that we use when

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:40.496 A:middle
showing that health record to

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:41.446 A:middle
users in Health.

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.976 A:middle
It's selected from the FHIR

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.466 A:middle
resource and it's your

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.006 A:middle
opportunity to tie back your

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:48.876 A:middle
app's experience to something

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.086 A:middle
users are familiar with.

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:54.616 A:middle
You can see in this lab result

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
that there are a number of

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.776 A:middle
alternative representations and

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.296 A:middle
names, including a coding in the

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.296 A:middle
names, including a coding in the

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.826 A:middle
LOINC coding system.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.476 A:middle
This is an industry standard

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
reference for medical

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.086 A:middle
information and it is required

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:10.806 A:middle
by FHIR for observations.

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:14.336 A:middle
You can see here that we've

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.366 A:middle
taken that LOINC coding and

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:18.396 A:middle
performed a lookup to provide a

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.126 A:middle
canonical name which we will

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.806 A:middle
surface to you as the display

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:21.976 A:middle
name.

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:27.426 A:middle
And finally, we provide access

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:29.646 A:middle
to the full FHIR resource, but

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:30.946 A:middle
there's a lot you can benefit

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.106 A:middle
from looking at the

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:33.756 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord so I'm going to

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.626 A:middle
set this aside right now and we

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:36.736 A:middle
can come back to it later.

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:42.696 A:middle
Like all of Health data,

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:45.236 A:middle
provenance, or the source of

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:47.396 A:middle
that data, is very important.

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:50.086 A:middle
You want to know where this

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.406 A:middle
health record comes from.

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:54.106 A:middle
And as with the rest of

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:56.326 A:middle
HealthKit we model this using

00:06:56.326 --> 00:06:58.606 A:middle
HKSource which is available on

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.366 A:middle
the HKSample superclass.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.366 A:middle
the HKSample superclass.

00:07:02.436 --> 00:07:04.876 A:middle
We set the name to be the name

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:06.446 A:middle
of the healthcare institution

00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:08.146 A:middle
that they have shared with us

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:10.546 A:middle
and we provide a bundle

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.416 A:middle
identifier which is a stable

00:07:12.416 --> 00:07:14.096 A:middle
identifier for that healthcare

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:16.416 A:middle
institution across multiple user

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:17.976 A:middle
logins and devices.

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:24.626 A:middle
So now we've seen the new sample

00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:25.136 A:middle
types.

00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:27.146 A:middle
Let's see how you authorize your

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.976 A:middle
application and query for data.

00:07:37.246 --> 00:07:39.066 A:middle
As you can see, there's a huge

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.666 A:middle
wealth of information in medical

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:44.556 A:middle
records and we really believe

00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:45.766 A:middle
that that is a fantastic

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.376 A:middle
opportunity for you to provide

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:49.656 A:middle
your users with truly empowering

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.666 A:middle
experiences around their health

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:52.026 A:middle
data.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:56.686 A:middle
But of course health records

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.576 A:middle
also contain incredibly

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.136 A:middle
sensitive information.

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.136 A:middle
sensitive information.

00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:02.806 A:middle
A user's health records might

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:05.116 A:middle
contain details of medications

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:06.446 A:middle
that they are taking or

00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
conditions that they are living

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.206 A:middle
with on a daily basis.

00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:12.196 A:middle
This is information they may not

00:08:12.196 --> 00:08:13.866 A:middle
be comfortable sharing with a

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:15.536 A:middle
close friend or family member.

00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:18.936 A:middle
And it can change over time as a

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:20.496 A:middle
user interacts with their

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:22.756 A:middle
healthcare institution, they

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:25.246 A:middle
might receive a new diagnosis of

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:25.776 A:middle
a condition.

00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:28.566 A:middle
So to help our users better

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:31.276 A:middle
understand and manage access to

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:33.166 A:middle
that data we're introducing a

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:35.976 A:middle
new authorization flow specific

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.936 A:middle
to Health Records.

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
When your app requests

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:41.846 A:middle
authorization we will present a

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
new permission sheet specific to

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:45.446 A:middle
clinical types.

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.516 A:middle
First, we inform users what it

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:51.346 A:middle
means to share that data with

00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
your app and just how sensitive

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:55.766 A:middle
it is.

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:57.446 A:middle
Since we will present this new

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.576 A:middle
authorization flow, whenever you

00:08:59.576 --> 00:09:01.946 A:middle
request authorization you should

00:08:59.576 --> 00:09:01.946 A:middle
request authorization you should

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:03.316 A:middle
ensure that you time your

00:09:03.316 --> 00:09:05.446 A:middle
authorization requests to make

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:06.716 A:middle
sure your user has sufficient

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:09.006 A:middle
context with which to understand

00:09:09.106 --> 00:09:09.966 A:middle
this new dialogue.

00:09:12.516 --> 00:09:15.446 A:middle
After this we allow users to

00:09:15.446 --> 00:09:17.146 A:middle
select the types of data that

00:09:17.146 --> 00:09:18.466 A:middle
they choose to share with your

00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:20.976 A:middle
app from the categories that you

00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:21.806 A:middle
have requested.

00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:25.776 A:middle
We also present a new purpose

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:28.146 A:middle
string and your app's privacy

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:30.326 A:middle
policy in the app explanation

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:30.916 A:middle
section.

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:33.176 A:middle
This is really your opportunity

00:09:33.176 --> 00:09:35.796 A:middle
to explain to users why you need

00:09:35.796 --> 00:09:37.886 A:middle
access to that data, what you're

00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:39.756 A:middle
going to do with it, and how you

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:42.946 A:middle
will protect that data.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.196 A:middle
You should be sure to make sure

00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:46.606 A:middle
that what you request is

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:48.526 A:middle
proportional to what you need.

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.316 A:middle
Users are really going to be

00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:53.146 A:middle
surprised and concerned if they

00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:55.216 A:middle
see types here that don't

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:56.596 A:middle
pertain to the primary function

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:56.956 A:middle
of your app.

00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
And finally because data can

00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
And finally because data can

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.366 A:middle
change over time as a user

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:03.856 A:middle
interacts with their healthcare

00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:06.966 A:middle
institution, we're introducing a

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:09.526 A:middle
new way to control how new data

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.296 A:middle
is shared with your app.

00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:13.886 A:middle
We default to asking before

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:16.216 A:middle
sharing new data each and every

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:16.646 A:middle
time.

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:19.546 A:middle
This means we may need to

00:10:19.546 --> 00:10:21.796 A:middle
present the new permission sheet

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:24.346 A:middle
whenever new data is available.

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:27.266 A:middle
So when you need to query for

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.016 A:middle
data you should always request

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:30.846 A:middle
authorization prior to doing so.

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
Okay, so how do I get started

00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:39.046 A:middle
and request authorization?

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.106 A:middle
This flow is going to look very

00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:43.406 A:middle
familiar to those of you who've

00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:44.836 A:middle
worked with HealthKit before.

00:10:45.756 --> 00:10:48.416 A:middle
First, I need to configure the

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:49.906 A:middle
project.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.156 A:middle
After that request

00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:53.036 A:middle
authorization.

00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:55.976 A:middle
And finally query for data.

00:10:56.586 --> 00:11:00.766 A:middle
To configure your project you

00:10:56.586 --> 00:11:00.766 A:middle
To configure your project you

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:02.626 A:middle
need to add a new health records

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:04.896 A:middle
capability in Xcode after

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:06.976 A:middle
enabling HealthKit.

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:13.746 A:middle
Then you add the new Health

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:15.326 A:middle
Records Usage Description

00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:16.586 A:middle
purpose string to your

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:17.546 A:middle
Info.plist.

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:22.426 A:middle
Again, this is your opportunity

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:24.426 A:middle
to explain to users why you need

00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:26.036 A:middle
access to this data and what you

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:27.226 A:middle
will do with it.

00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:31.836 A:middle
Having done this, you can

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:33.096 A:middle
request authorization.

00:11:34.416 --> 00:11:36.986 A:middle
Here I define the types I wish

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:39.036 A:middle
to access, conditions,

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:42.976 A:middle
immunizations, and medications.

00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:48.606 A:middle
And then you can call request

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.206 A:middle
authorization on the Health

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:50.676 A:middle
Store.

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.806 A:middle
Being sure to handle any errors

00:11:54.456 --> 00:11:57.066 A:middle
and after that you're good to

00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:57.496 A:middle
query.

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.496 A:middle
You should be aware that in

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.496 A:middle
You should be aware that in

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:02.526 A:middle
order to maintain user privacy

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.066 A:middle
we don't reveal to you which

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:07.046 A:middle
categories a user has granted

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:08.976 A:middle
access or denied access to.

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:14.676 A:middle
And now to querying.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.306 A:middle
Because HKClinicalRecord is an

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:19.306 A:middle
HKSample you can take advantage

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:21.296 A:middle
of all of the existing sample

00:12:21.296 --> 00:12:22.506 A:middle
query infrastructure in

00:12:22.506 --> 00:12:23.036 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:25.406 A:middle
Things like SampleQuery,

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:27.266 A:middle
AnchoredObjectQuery and

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.936 A:middle
ObserverQuery will all work and

00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:31.366 A:middle
if your user has granted

00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:33.476 A:middle
continuous access background

00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:37.706 A:middle
delivery will also work.

00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:40.296 A:middle
Again, you define the type that

00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:41.496 A:middle
you wish to query for.

00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:45.006 A:middle
We're creating a sample query

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:48.226 A:middle
here and you can execute that on

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:48.836 A:middle
the Health Store.

00:12:53.076 --> 00:12:54.006 A:middle
So that's the basic

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.146 A:middle
authorization flow.

00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:57.446 A:middle
But we've actually introduced

00:12:57.446 --> 00:12:59.216 A:middle
some additional mechanisms

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.856 A:middle
specific to Health Records.

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.856 A:middle
specific to Health Records.

00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:05.996 A:middle
We have a new API Get Request

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.016 A:middle
Status for Authorization, which

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:09.696 A:middle
allows you to determine if we

00:13:09.696 --> 00:13:11.486 A:middle
would present a permission sheet

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:12.306 A:middle
to the user.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:17.246 A:middle
This gives you an opportunity to

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:19.926 A:middle
determine whether your user will

00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:21.566 A:middle
need to see the authorization

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:23.676 A:middle
sheet and optionally present a

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:26.116 A:middle
UI to provide them with more

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:27.866 A:middle
context prior to authorization.

00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:33.636 A:middle
To do this you call Get Request

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:35.356 A:middle
Status for Authorization on the

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.436 A:middle
Health Store, handle any errors,

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:42.576 A:middle
and if the request status is

00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:44.396 A:middle
should request you can

00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:47.016 A:middle
optionally present that UI prior

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:47.976 A:middle
to requesting authorization.

00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.456 A:middle
Now there may also be some types

00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:56.006 A:middle
of data that your app requires

00:13:56.006 --> 00:13:58.526 A:middle
access to, to provide a safe

00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:01.366 A:middle
experience or perhaps if you

00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:01.366 A:middle
experience or perhaps if you

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:04.266 A:middle
have a research app you need

00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
access to a comprehensive set of

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.056 A:middle
types to avoid skewed results.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.636 A:middle
We have a new required types key

00:14:13.636 --> 00:14:15.426 A:middle
in the Info.plist, which allows

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.276 A:middle
you to specify these types.

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:20.216 A:middle
And if they're present we will

00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:22.186 A:middle
return a new required types

00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:24.666 A:middle
error if the user has not

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.656 A:middle
granted access to these types.

00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:28.656 A:middle
And this allows you to determine

00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:31.136 A:middle
how to behave, optionally

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:32.376 A:middle
explaining to the user that you

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:33.966 A:middle
cannot continue if you don't

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:34.636 A:middle
have this data.

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:40.406 A:middle
You can implement this by adding

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:42.086 A:middle
the new required read

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:43.496 A:middle
authorization key to your

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:44.536 A:middle
Info.plist.

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:47.426 A:middle
Here I'm specifying that I

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:49.606 A:middle
require allergies, conditions

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:50.726 A:middle
and immunizations.

00:14:51.316 --> 00:14:54.436 A:middle
And then you handle the new

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.606 A:middle
error in the authorization

00:14:56.606 --> 00:14:56.926 A:middle
request.

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:02.056 A:middle
You should be sure to use this

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:05.006 A:middle
judiciously and try not to limit

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:06.896 A:middle
your app's functionality based

00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:08.826 A:middle
on the data that you have access

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:09.086 A:middle
to.

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:11.466 A:middle
You really want to make sure as

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.196 A:middle
many users as possible can

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:14.406 A:middle
benefit from your app

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:16.326 A:middle
irrespective of how much data

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:16.976 A:middle
they choose to share.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.546 A:middle
So that's the full authorization

00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:25.536 A:middle
flow and there's just a couple

00:15:25.536 --> 00:15:27.116 A:middle
of points I'd like to focus on.

00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.966 A:middle
Firstly, you should be sure to

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.746 A:middle
request authorization each and

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.316 A:middle
every time that you need access

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.296 A:middle
to data, especially now because

00:15:37.296 --> 00:15:39.456 A:middle
users may want to see that sheet

00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:41.386 A:middle
every time when new data comes

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:44.106 A:middle
in we may need to present a

00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:45.756 A:middle
sheet when you need to query.

00:15:48.106 --> 00:15:49.346 A:middle
You should also be sure to

00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:51.356 A:middle
request only access to the data

00:15:51.356 --> 00:15:52.166 A:middle
that you need.

00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:56.266 A:middle
And finally, you should consider

00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:58.356 A:middle
taking advantage of the new APIs

00:15:58.736 --> 00:15:59.906 A:middle
to provide users with better

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
context and allow you to time

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
context and allow you to time

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.456 A:middle
those authorization requests.

00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:08.976 A:middle
And with that I'd like to hand

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.756 A:middle
over to my colleague Peyton to

00:16:11.026 --> 00:16:12.396 A:middle
see what he can do with this in

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:12.896 A:middle
his app.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:14.026 A:middle
Thank you.

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:16.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jason.

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:18.846 A:middle
So I'm working on an app for

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.166 A:middle
mountain climbers training for

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:20.906 A:middle
their next summit.

00:16:21.656 --> 00:16:24.036 A:middle
I've got a HealthKit powered

00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:26.436 A:middle
view of all my users walking,

00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:27.686 A:middle
hiking and stairclimbing

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:28.226 A:middle
workouts.

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:31.116 A:middle
Now after extensive market

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.266 A:middle
research, I've determined that

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:35.156 A:middle
mountain climbers travel to

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:37.786 A:middle
mountains and travelers should

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:40.106 A:middle
know their vaccination status.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:42.096 A:middle
So by the transitive property of

00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:43.746 A:middle
future development mountain

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:45.236 A:middle
climbers should know their

00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.466 A:middle
vaccination status.

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:48.106 A:middle
So I'm going to help out my

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:48.646 A:middle
users.

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:50.646 A:middle
I've started implementing a new

00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:52.646 A:middle
tab, an immunization dashboard.

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:54.936 A:middle
So let me tap on what I have

00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:55.146 A:middle
now.

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:58.526 A:middle
Here's my immunization dashboard

00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:00.346 A:middle
and to start out with I'm going

00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:00.346 A:middle
and to start out with I'm going

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
to display my users a list of

00:17:02.216 --> 00:17:04.286 A:middle
their current vaccinations and

00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:05.915 A:middle
I'm going to use the

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:07.376 A:middle
HKClinicalRecords display name

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:07.836 A:middle
property.

00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:09.986 A:middle
I've already added the Health

00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:11.866 A:middle
Records capability to my project

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.516 A:middle
and I've created a purpose

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:16.195 A:middle
string to tell my users how I

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:17.596 A:middle
plan to use their immunizations.

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:20.356 A:middle
Now it's time to implement my

00:17:20.356 --> 00:17:20.836 A:middle
dashboard.

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:22.695 A:middle
So here I am at the

00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:24.195 A:middle
ImmunizationsViewController

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:25.256 A:middle
powering that tab.

00:17:25.976 --> 00:17:27.856 A:middle
In HealthKit it's good practice

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.806 A:middle
to request authorization every

00:17:29.806 --> 00:17:31.486 A:middle
time your user enters the part

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:33.086 A:middle
of your application using

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:33.496 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.526 A:middle
So for this app viewWillAppear

00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:37.456 A:middle
is a great place.

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:43.156 A:middle
Here I need to first specify

00:17:43.956 --> 00:17:44.776 A:middle
that I'm interested in

00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:46.256 A:middle
immunization record samples.

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
And next, call my Health Store's

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:52.306 A:middle
requestAuthorization method.

00:17:53.356 --> 00:17:54.786 A:middle
In the callback I'm going to

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.906 A:middle
check for success and handle

00:17:56.906 --> 00:17:57.846 A:middle
errors appropriately.

00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:01.476 A:middle
Finally, once I'm unauthorized

00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:01.476 A:middle
Finally, once I'm unauthorized

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:03.376 A:middle
I'm going to call this query for

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.726 A:middle
immunizations method which I'll

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:06.576 A:middle
implement now.

00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:08.466 A:middle
Here in query for immunizations

00:18:08.716 --> 00:18:09.946 A:middle
I'm going to create a sample

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:12.046 A:middle
query, I'm going to iterate over

00:18:12.046 --> 00:18:13.656 A:middle
all the return samples, and I'm

00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:15.346 A:middle
going to pass each sample's

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:16.916 A:middle
display name to my data source.

00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:17.976 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:23.666 A:middle
Here I've got my sample query

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.716 A:middle
and I'm using the humanization

00:18:25.716 --> 00:18:27.246 A:middle
record sample type.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.686 A:middle
No predicate because I want all

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:32.656 A:middle
of the users' immunizations and

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:35.316 A:middle
similarly no limit because I

00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:36.636 A:middle
want to get all of my users'

00:18:36.936 --> 00:18:37.526 A:middle
immunizations.

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.266 A:middle
No sort descriptors, it doesn't

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:41.856 A:middle
matter to me in what order these

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:42.616 A:middle
samples are returned.

00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
And with that I'm going to check

00:18:46.256 --> 00:18:48.556 A:middle
for results and if not handle

00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:49.426 A:middle
errors appropriately.

00:18:50.806 --> 00:18:52.936 A:middle
Next, I'm going to iterate over

00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:55.216 A:middle
the samples and I'll pass them

00:18:55.446 --> 00:18:57.396 A:middle
to my data source by display

00:18:57.966 --> 00:18:58.056 A:middle
name.

00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:02.116 A:middle
With the names in my data source

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:03.816 A:middle
it's time to head out to the

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:06.536 A:middle
main queue and call this reload

00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:08.456 A:middle
UI method that I wrote earlier.

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.766 A:middle
Finally, I'm going to execute my

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:14.306 A:middle
sample query on my Health Store

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
and that's all it takes, so

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:16.976 A:middle
let's build and run.

00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:22.336 A:middle
So here I have my training log,

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:23.636 A:middle
I'm going to tap on my

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:24.916 A:middle
immunization dashboard tab.

00:19:25.366 --> 00:19:26.686 A:middle
I see the new Health Records

00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:28.776 A:middle
authorization sheet explaining

00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:31.276 A:middle
to my users how my app could

00:19:31.446 --> 00:19:33.546 A:middle
potentially use my users' health

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:33.896 A:middle
records.

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:37.306 A:middle
I'm going to tap continue and

00:19:37.306 --> 00:19:39.596 A:middle
here my user has a chance to

00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:41.686 A:middle
allow or deny categories as they

00:19:41.686 --> 00:19:42.156 A:middle
see fit.

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:44.536 A:middle
There is my purpose string that

00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:45.976 A:middle
I defined in my Info.plist

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.796 A:middle
earlier alongside a link to my

00:19:47.796 --> 00:19:48.956 A:middle
app's privacy policy.

00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:51.836 A:middle
Now users have to explicitly

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.556 A:middle
switch for every single

00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:55.776 A:middle
category, there's no turn on all

00:19:55.776 --> 00:19:56.166 A:middle
button.

00:19:57.256 --> 00:19:59.306 A:middle
So for the purposes of the demo

00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
I'm going to enable

00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
I'm going to enable

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:02.036 A:middle
immunizations and to have share

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:02.766 A:middle
current records.

00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:05.056 A:middle
For future records I'll leave

00:20:05.306 --> 00:20:06.746 A:middle
with the default Ask Before

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:08.506 A:middle
Sharing and I'll tap done.

00:20:09.016 --> 00:20:12.076 A:middle
And just like that I have a list

00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:13.806 A:middle
of all my users' immunizations.

00:20:13.806 --> 00:20:14.916 A:middle
So that's just--

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:20.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.146 A:middle
So that's just using display

00:20:22.146 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
name, but there's a lot more

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:24.626 A:middle
information contained in the

00:20:24.626 --> 00:20:27.536 A:middle
clinical records FHIR resources.

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.166 A:middle
So to tell you more about FHIR

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.066 A:middle
I'd like to hand it back to

00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:30.416 A:middle
Jason.

00:20:31.576 --> 00:20:32.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Peyton.

00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:35.756 A:middle
So Peyton just showed us how we

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:38.026 A:middle
can request authorization in our

00:20:38.026 --> 00:20:41.286 A:middle
app, query for data, and take

00:20:41.286 --> 00:20:43.266 A:middle
advantage of the new display

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:45.556 A:middle
name on HKClinicalRecord to

00:20:45.556 --> 00:20:47.086 A:middle
present that information to

00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:48.976 A:middle
users in a way they're familiar.

00:20:53.356 --> 00:20:56.116 A:middle
So now let's take a look at FHIR

00:20:56.116 --> 00:20:57.536 A:middle
and see what you can do with

00:20:57.536 --> 00:21:02.626 A:middle
this rich data format.

00:20:57.536 --> 00:21:02.626 A:middle
this rich data format.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:04.586 A:middle
Users interact with multiple

00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
healthcare institutions over the

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.446 A:middle
course of their lives and these

00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:10.526 A:middle
are often running different

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.446 A:middle
electronic health record systems

00:21:13.326 --> 00:21:15.856 A:middle
that don't always represent data

00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:16.936 A:middle
in the same way.

00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:19.426 A:middle
This makes interoperability

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:20.536 A:middle
incredibly difficult.

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:25.016 A:middle
So to address this the

00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:26.516 A:middle
healthcare community came

00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:27.996 A:middle
together in an effort called the

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.626 A:middle
Argonaut Project, this uses

00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:33.076 A:middle
FHIR, a flexible JSON

00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:36.556 A:middle
representation of health records

00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.416 A:middle
and [inaudible] 2 as defined by

00:21:38.416 --> 00:21:40.936 A:middle
the Smart Authorization Guide to

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:43.646 A:middle
allow connections, consistent

00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:45.196 A:middle
connections to healthcare

00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:47.256 A:middle
institutions and to allow data

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:49.016 A:middle
to be downloaded in a common

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.676 A:middle
format and related across those

00:21:51.676 --> 00:21:53.046 A:middle
multiple institutions.

00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
FHIR itself models a huge

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:01.556 A:middle
universe of health data from

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:01.556 A:middle
universe of health data from

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:04.846 A:middle
allergy intolerance to vision

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:08.456 A:middle
prescription and it organizes

00:22:08.456 --> 00:22:10.196 A:middle
this data into different data

00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:12.316 A:middle
types called resources.

00:22:13.046 --> 00:22:14.966 A:middle
Each resource has a resource

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.396 A:middle
type and there is one for each

00:22:16.396 --> 00:22:20.996 A:middle
and every kind of health data.

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:23.846 A:middle
Today we are selecting the eight

00:22:24.046 --> 00:22:26.256 A:middle
most common resource types and

00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:27.486 A:middle
these are defined within the

00:22:27.486 --> 00:22:29.636 A:middle
Argonaut Project and we are

00:22:29.636 --> 00:22:31.336 A:middle
grouping these into the seven

00:22:31.336 --> 00:22:33.066 A:middle
different clinical types that we

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:33.926 A:middle
saw earlier.

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:36.046 A:middle
You'll note that we split

00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:39.756 A:middle
observations into lab results

00:22:39.756 --> 00:22:41.456 A:middle
and vital signs based on the

00:22:41.456 --> 00:22:45.006 A:middle
categorization and we group

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:47.006 A:middle
multiple medication resource

00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:48.856 A:middle
types into the medications

00:22:51.706 --> 00:22:51.956 A:middle
category.

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:54.846 A:middle
So FHIR represents data as a

00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:56.666 A:middle
JSON dictionary and there are

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.376 A:middle
some key properties that are

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.666 A:middle
present on all FHIR resources.

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.666 A:middle
present on all FHIR resources.

00:23:01.816 --> 00:23:03.496 A:middle
Things like the resource type,

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:05.096 A:middle
here we're looking at an

00:23:05.096 --> 00:23:08.356 A:middle
observation and this tells us

00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:09.806 A:middle
that in the context of health

00:23:09.996 --> 00:23:12.006 A:middle
this is a lab result or a vital

00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:12.426 A:middle
sign.

00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:17.686 A:middle
We also have an ID present on

00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:19.286 A:middle
all resource types.

00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:22.836 A:middle
This is a unique identifier for

00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:24.346 A:middle
that resource, but you should

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:26.096 A:middle
note that it is only unique

00:23:26.096 --> 00:23:27.626 A:middle
within the domain of that

00:23:27.626 --> 00:23:29.326 A:middle
resource type for that

00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:30.526 A:middle
healthcare institution.

00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:36.806 A:middle
One of the most fundamental

00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:38.616 A:middle
building blocks of FHIR is a

00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:39.266 A:middle
coding.

00:23:40.736 --> 00:23:43.016 A:middle
This allows for a reference to a

00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:45.216 A:middle
unique identifier or a code

00:23:46.016 --> 00:23:48.176 A:middle
scoped within an external coding

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:48.806 A:middle
system.

00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.816 A:middle
There are a number of coding

00:23:50.816 --> 00:23:52.776 A:middle
systems specified within FHIR

00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:55.466 A:middle
and you can use these to find

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:57.106 A:middle
out more about the items that

00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:58.346 A:middle
are referenced in medical

00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:01.976 A:middle
records or to relate specific

00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:01.976 A:middle
records or to relate specific

00:24:01.976 --> 00:24:03.426 A:middle
things across multiple

00:24:03.426 --> 00:24:04.826 A:middle
healthcare institutions.

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:09.496 A:middle
Here we're actually looking at a

00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:12.196 A:middle
category coding which tells us

00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:13.506 A:middle
that this is a lab result.

00:24:15.816 --> 00:24:18.056 A:middle
There's also a code in the case

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.706 A:middle
of an observation for what is

00:24:19.746 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
being measured.

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:25.376 A:middle
This is blood glucose as defined

00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:27.806 A:middle
in the LOINC coding system and

00:24:27.806 --> 00:24:29.266 A:middle
it could take that code and look

00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:31.316 A:middle
it up in the LOINC database for

00:24:31.316 --> 00:24:32.956 A:middle
alternative names and further

00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:33.526 A:middle
information.

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
And of course this is an

00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.966 A:middle
observation so I have the value

00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:41.076 A:middle
that is observed.

00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:42.786 A:middle
This is 60 milligrams per

00:24:42.786 --> 00:24:44.676 A:middle
deciliter and you'll note that

00:24:44.676 --> 00:24:46.376 A:middle
even the units here are coded,

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:48.286 A:middle
so I have a really comprehensive

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.816 A:middle
understanding about what's going

00:24:49.816 --> 00:24:49.976 A:middle
on.

00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:56.376 A:middle
FHIR resources have many

00:24:56.376 --> 00:24:59.586 A:middle
additional data elements and I

00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:01.036 A:middle
encourage you to go and look at

00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:01.036 A:middle
encourage you to go and look at

00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:02.006 A:middle
the Argonaut Project

00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:04.026 A:middle
documentation to find out more

00:25:04.026 --> 00:25:06.146 A:middle
and I'll have details of these

00:25:06.636 --> 00:25:08.966 A:middle
at the end.

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:10.716 A:middle
In HealthKit we model a FHIR

00:25:10.716 --> 00:25:12.896 A:middle
resources as HKFHIRResource.

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.606 A:middle
We provide some key properties

00:25:15.826 --> 00:25:18.126 A:middle
like the data, access to the

00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:19.536 A:middle
full raw data.

00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:23.596 A:middle
We surface common elements like

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:26.206 A:middle
the resource type and

00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:26.806 A:middle
identifier.

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:32.306 A:middle
You can access the data using

00:25:32.306 --> 00:25:34.186 A:middle
Swift codable or JSON

00:25:34.186 --> 00:25:35.186 A:middle
serialization.

00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:37.156 A:middle
Here you can see that I've

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:39.076 A:middle
defined my own codable struct,

00:25:39.336 --> 00:25:42.046 A:middle
my codable observation and I'm

00:25:42.046 --> 00:25:43.656 A:middle
using that to pull out the value

00:25:43.656 --> 00:25:44.966 A:middle
quantity that we saw earlier.

00:25:45.516 --> 00:25:49.166 A:middle
You can have confidence that the

00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:50.906 A:middle
data is structured correctly

00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:53.606 A:middle
here as we only share valid FHIR

00:25:53.606 --> 00:25:57.726 A:middle
resources through the API.

00:25:58.196 --> 00:25:59.136 A:middle
We also introduce some

00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.556 A:middle
predicates to make it easier for

00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.556 A:middle
predicates to make it easier for

00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:01.356 A:middle
you to work with

00:26:01.356 --> 00:26:02.566 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.046 A:middle
We have a predicate to allow you

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:08.316 A:middle
to query by resource type, here

00:26:08.396 --> 00:26:10.686 A:middle
I'm looking for prescription or

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:12.866 A:middle
in FHIR a medication order.

00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:16.766 A:middle
We also have a predicate to

00:26:16.766 --> 00:26:18.716 A:middle
allow you to uniquely identify

00:26:19.206 --> 00:26:20.946 A:middle
records by their source,

00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:23.076 A:middle
resource type and identifier.

00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:25.416 A:middle
This can be incredibly useful as

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:27.066 A:middle
FHIR resources can reference

00:26:27.156 --> 00:26:28.636 A:middle
other FHIR resources.

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:30.926 A:middle
For example, a medication might

00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:32.436 A:middle
reference the condition that it

00:26:32.486 --> 00:26:32.956 A:middle
treats.

00:26:37.116 --> 00:26:38.346 A:middle
Now there are some additional

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.686 A:middle
considerations you need to be

00:26:39.686 --> 00:26:41.096 A:middle
aware of when working with FHIR.

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
Firstly, FHIR resources may

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.906 A:middle
contain their own dates.

00:26:47.466 --> 00:26:49.136 A:middle
For example, prescriptions may

00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:50.606 A:middle
contain the order data of that

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:52.766 A:middle
prescription while a condition

00:26:53.006 --> 00:26:54.766 A:middle
may contain the onset date,

00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
abatement date and the date that

00:26:56.626 --> 00:26:57.986 A:middle
that prescription is first

00:26:57.986 --> 00:26:58.566 A:middle
observed.

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
You should therefore use the

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
You should therefore use the

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
FHIR resource directly to access

00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:05.356 A:middle
these dates for each resource

00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:05.676 A:middle
type.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:08.436 A:middle
Start date and end date that are

00:27:08.436 --> 00:27:09.786 A:middle
available on the HKSample

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:11.716 A:middle
superclass are set for the date

00:27:11.716 --> 00:27:14.096 A:middle
that we first add that resource

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.000 A:middle
to Health.

00:27:18.186 --> 00:27:20.046 A:middle
You should use source, resource,

00:27:20.046 --> 00:27:21.556 A:middle
type and identifier when

00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.856 A:middle
uniquely identifying a health

00:27:23.856 --> 00:27:24.346 A:middle
record.

00:27:24.756 --> 00:27:26.476 A:middle
This will allow you to identify

00:27:26.476 --> 00:27:27.506 A:middle
a health record across the

00:27:27.506 --> 00:27:29.636 A:middle
course of its lifetime as it is

00:27:29.636 --> 00:27:31.016 A:middle
updated by the healthcare

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:31.736 A:middle
institution.

00:27:32.156 --> 00:27:36.666 A:middle
And finally, you should be aware

00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:39.536 A:middle
that FHIR and JSON don't fully

00:27:39.536 --> 00:27:41.486 A:middle
agree when it comes to numerical

00:27:41.486 --> 00:27:42.086 A:middle
precision.

00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:45.426 A:middle
FHIR ascribes significance to

00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:47.316 A:middle
the number of digits following

00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:48.916 A:middle
the decimal place and this can

00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:50.986 A:middle
be lost when using Swift codable

00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.666 A:middle
or JSON serialization.

00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:54.976 A:middle
If it's really fundamental to

00:27:54.976 --> 00:27:57.396 A:middle
your app that you have full

00:27:57.396 --> 00:28:00.116 A:middle
access to this information Swift

00:27:57.396 --> 00:28:00.116 A:middle
access to this information Swift

00:28:00.116 --> 00:28:01.856 A:middle
codable and JSON serialization

00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:03.576 A:middle
may not be appropriate tools.

00:28:04.596 --> 00:28:06.646 A:middle
And with that, I'd love to hand

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:08.496 A:middle
back to Peyton and see what

00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:10.376 A:middle
wonderful things he can do with

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:10.976 A:middle
this new API.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:18.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:19.106 --> 00:28:19.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jason.

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:21.896 A:middle
So back to the immunization

00:28:21.896 --> 00:28:23.186 A:middle
dashboard I've been working on.

00:28:23.726 --> 00:28:25.526 A:middle
I'm using HealthKit to fetch my

00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.316 A:middle
users' vaccinations, but right

00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:28.826 A:middle
now it's tough for a user to

00:28:28.826 --> 00:28:30.696 A:middle
tell what vaccinations they have

00:28:30.766 --> 00:28:31.846 A:middle
and what they might need to get.

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:34.616 A:middle
So I'm going to solve that by

00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:36.436 A:middle
implementing an immunization

00:28:36.656 --> 00:28:37.346 A:middle
checklist.

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.466 A:middle
Users can see a summary of their

00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
immunizations in plain language.

00:28:43.126 --> 00:28:44.816 A:middle
To populate this list I need to

00:28:44.816 --> 00:28:46.016 A:middle
know that this combination

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:48.516 A:middle
vaccine induces immunity against

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:51.136 A:middle
chickenpox and against MMR.

00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:54.016 A:middle
Health institutions speak

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:55.926 A:middle
different languages so I can't

00:28:55.926 --> 00:28:58.596 A:middle
rely on name alone, so that's

00:28:58.596 --> 00:28:59.806 A:middle
where the interoperability of

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
FHIR comes into play.

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
FHIR comes into play.

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:03.356 A:middle
FHIR gives a way to use

00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:05.066 A:middle
predefined codes rather than

00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:07.146 A:middle
natural language to specify what

00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:07.616 A:middle
things are.

00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:11.106 A:middle
So after taking a look at the

00:29:11.106 --> 00:29:13.326 A:middle
FHIR documentation here's the

00:29:13.326 --> 00:29:14.806 A:middle
algorithm I've come up with to

00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:16.736 A:middle
identify a chickenpox vaccine.

00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:20.066 A:middle
First, I'll take the

00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:23.406 A:middle
immunization records JSON, I'm

00:29:23.406 --> 00:29:25.176 A:middle
going to deserialize it and pull

00:29:25.176 --> 00:29:27.046 A:middle
out the vaccination code in a

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:28.646 A:middle
system called CVX.

00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:31.006 A:middle
CVX is a commonly used coding

00:29:31.006 --> 00:29:32.646 A:middle
system for immunizations, but

00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:33.856 A:middle
there are many other coding

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:35.256 A:middle
systems for different areas of

00:29:35.256 --> 00:29:35.616 A:middle
medicine.

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.726 A:middle
Finally, I'm going compare the

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:40.286 A:middle
CVX code I found in my

00:29:40.286 --> 00:29:42.486 A:middle
immunization record to a list of

00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:44.676 A:middle
vaccines I know induce immunity

00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:45.546 A:middle
against chickenpox.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
If there's a match I'll show a

00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
checkmark in my UI next to

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.376 A:middle
chickenpox.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.976 A:middle
So let's talk about the

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:53.946 A:middle
immunization record JSON.

00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
The structure starts with a

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.806 A:middle
resource type immunization.

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.806 A:middle
resource type immunization.

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:05.966 A:middle
There's a vaccine code object

00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:08.996 A:middle
and contained therein is an

00:30:08.996 --> 00:30:09.986 A:middle
array of codings.

00:30:10.506 --> 00:30:12.566 A:middle
There may be multiple codings,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:16.556 A:middle
so I need to search by system to

00:30:16.556 --> 00:30:17.526 A:middle
find CVX.

00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:19.616 A:middle
In this example, the first

00:30:19.616 --> 00:30:23.186 A:middle
system is NDC so I move until I

00:30:23.186 --> 00:30:24.076 A:middle
see CVX.

00:30:25.086 --> 00:30:27.026 A:middle
With that in hand I look at the

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:29.906 A:middle
code and I look it up and I see

00:30:29.906 --> 00:30:30.916 A:middle
that I have MMRV.

00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:34.886 A:middle
So that's the structure of these

00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.176 A:middle
immunization records JSON.

00:30:37.026 --> 00:30:38.906 A:middle
Now it's time to implement.

00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:41.646 A:middle
So here we are back in my

00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:42.956 A:middle
immunizations view controller.

00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:44.796 A:middle
I've done some work ahead of

00:30:44.796 --> 00:30:47.156 A:middle
time to implement the UI of the

00:30:47.156 --> 00:30:50.766 A:middle
checklist and I instantiate it

00:30:51.046 --> 00:30:52.596 A:middle
with a showChecklist property.

00:30:52.596 --> 00:30:57.076 A:middle
Now it's time to populate my

00:30:57.076 --> 00:30:57.826 A:middle
checklist with data.

00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
Here I am in the query for

00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
Here I am in the query for

00:31:00.856 --> 00:31:01.736 A:middle
immunizations method.

00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:04.226 A:middle
When I iterate over my users'

00:31:04.226 --> 00:31:06.086 A:middle
samples I'm going to add a call

00:31:06.086 --> 00:31:06.756 A:middle
to a new method

00:31:07.596 --> 00:31:09.786 A:middle
matchCodedVaccine and I'll pass

00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:10.776 A:middle
it if the sample is FHIR

00:31:10.776 --> 00:31:12.566 A:middle
resource, so let's implement

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:12.866 A:middle
that now.

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:18.106 A:middle
Here I am in matchCodedVaccine

00:31:18.736 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
from resource and what I need to

00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.776 A:middle
do is deserialize the FHIR

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:24.896 A:middle
resources data, pull out the

00:31:24.896 --> 00:31:26.896 A:middle
vaccination codes, search for

00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:29.416 A:middle
CVX, and compare it against

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.946 A:middle
lists of CVX codes for different

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:32.336 A:middle
diseases.

00:31:32.966 --> 00:31:35.206 A:middle
I have a lot of freedom in how I

00:31:35.206 --> 00:31:37.136 A:middle
choose to deserialize the FHIR

00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:39.256 A:middle
resource, so today I'm going to

00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:40.356 A:middle
use Swift codables.

00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:43.396 A:middle
I need to define a codable for

00:31:43.396 --> 00:31:44.536 A:middle
exactly the keys that I'm

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:45.676 A:middle
interested in.

00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:48.736 A:middle
So I've done that now.

00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:51.276 A:middle
An immunization resource has a

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.896 A:middle
vaccine code, a vaccine code has

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:57.086 A:middle
an array of codings and a

00:31:57.086 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
vaccine coding has a system and

00:31:57.086 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
vaccine coding has a system and

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:02.426 A:middle
a code.

00:32:02.636 --> 00:32:05.836 A:middle
With that I instantiate a JSON

00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:08.436 A:middle
decoder and I use it to decode

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
the FHIR resources data as an

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.746 A:middle
immunization resource.

00:32:12.276 --> 00:32:16.046 A:middle
All that's left is to iterate

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.396 A:middle
over each coding, check to see

00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:23.846 A:middle
whether the system is CVX, and

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:26.296 A:middle
then pass the code to this

00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:27.916 A:middle
method to mark it in the data

00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:28.266 A:middle
source.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.776 A:middle
All this method does is compares

00:32:30.776 --> 00:32:32.976 A:middle
the code against lists of codes

00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:34.806 A:middle
per disease and if there's a

00:32:34.806 --> 00:32:38.026 A:middle
match marks in the UI that

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:41.196 A:middle
disease for the found disease.

00:32:41.766 --> 00:32:44.176 A:middle
So with that I'm going to build

00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:45.916 A:middle
and run and take a look at my

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:46.936 A:middle
immunization checklist.

00:32:47.956 --> 00:32:49.436 A:middle
So here I am on my training log,

00:32:50.026 --> 00:32:50.866 A:middle
I'm going to tap on the

00:32:50.866 --> 00:32:53.746 A:middle
Immunizations tab and just like

00:32:53.746 --> 00:32:55.546 A:middle
that with a few lines of code I

00:32:55.546 --> 00:32:56.816 A:middle
have an immunization checklist.

[ Applause ]

00:32:57.516 --> 00:33:02.316 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.286 A:middle
So that's an example of solving

00:33:04.286 --> 00:33:05.626 A:middle
a problem using FHIR.

00:33:06.426 --> 00:33:09.346 A:middle
Now for a word on granting

00:33:09.396 --> 00:33:11.226 A:middle
consent for your users I'm going

00:33:11.226 --> 00:33:12.136 A:middle
to hand it back to Jason.

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:13.586 A:middle
Jason.

00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:19.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:20.046 --> 00:33:20.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Peyton.

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:25.196 A:middle
So Peyton has shown us how we

00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:27.586 A:middle
can take that rich FHIR data and

00:33:28.076 --> 00:33:29.756 A:middle
take advantage of the coding

00:33:29.756 --> 00:33:31.536 A:middle
that's provided to really

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:33.336 A:middle
provide our users with a very

00:33:33.336 --> 00:33:34.926 A:middle
meaningful and comprehensive

00:33:34.926 --> 00:33:36.256 A:middle
experience around their health

00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:36.806 A:middle
records.

00:33:39.596 --> 00:33:41.736 A:middle
And now I'd like to think a

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:43.366 A:middle
little bit about how you can

00:33:43.366 --> 00:33:45.506 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy

00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:46.256 A:middle
in this domain.

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:48.846 A:middle
As you've seen this is

00:33:48.846 --> 00:33:50.446 A:middle
incredibly sensitive data.

00:33:51.716 --> 00:33:53.646 A:middle
We've built privacy in from the

00:33:53.646 --> 00:33:57.166 A:middle
ground up, establishing secure

00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:59.646 A:middle
connections direct to healthcare

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:00.746 A:middle
institutions.

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:00.746 A:middle
institutions.

00:34:01.876 --> 00:34:04.156 A:middle
Downloading data straight to

00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:05.946 A:middle
users' iOS devices.

00:34:06.486 --> 00:34:08.255 A:middle
Storing it securely in

00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:08.896 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:34:09.806 --> 00:34:11.406 A:middle
And providing comprehensive

00:34:11.406 --> 00:34:13.886 A:middle
management tools around access

00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:16.206 A:middle
to that data.

00:34:16.396 --> 00:34:18.876 A:middle
Your users will expect you to

00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:20.896 A:middle
treat their data with that same

00:34:20.896 --> 00:34:22.596 A:middle
level of care and attention.

00:34:25.016 --> 00:34:27.626 A:middle
Every choice that you make here

00:34:27.896 --> 00:34:29.466 A:middle
can have a direct impact on

00:34:29.466 --> 00:34:30.266 A:middle
individuals.

00:34:31.456 --> 00:34:33.126 A:middle
This can be a truly positive

00:34:33.176 --> 00:34:35.065 A:middle
impact and it's why we are

00:34:35.065 --> 00:34:36.896 A:middle
choosing to provide this API

00:34:36.966 --> 00:34:39.326 A:middle
today, but it can also be a

00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:40.326 A:middle
negative one.

00:34:41.056 --> 00:34:42.896 A:middle
If users feel that this data is

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:45.386 A:middle
out of their control or worse

00:34:45.386 --> 00:34:47.275 A:middle
still, it is shared without

00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:47.966 A:middle
their consent.

00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:50.846 A:middle
You can show respect for your

00:34:50.846 --> 00:34:52.876 A:middle
users and help establish a

00:34:52.876 --> 00:34:55.025 A:middle
relationship of trust by

00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:56.376 A:middle
providing them with clear

00:34:56.376 --> 00:34:59.736 A:middle
policies around that data and

00:34:59.736 --> 00:35:01.176 A:middle
informing them what you do with

00:34:59.736 --> 00:35:01.176 A:middle
informing them what you do with

00:35:01.676 --> 00:35:01.746 A:middle
it.

00:35:02.376 --> 00:35:03.736 A:middle
This starts with your

00:35:03.736 --> 00:35:05.736 A:middle
application, your purpose

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:08.016 A:middle
string, and your privacy policy

00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:09.916 A:middle
and it continues every step of

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:12.206 A:middle
the way as you work with that

00:35:12.206 --> 00:35:14.246 A:middle
data and as you move it around.

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.286 A:middle
For example, you should make

00:35:17.286 --> 00:35:20.836 A:middle
sure you give users details

00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:22.926 A:middle
about how you manage their data.

00:35:23.536 --> 00:35:24.996 A:middle
You should publish clear

00:35:24.996 --> 00:35:27.096 A:middle
retention policies and you

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:28.496 A:middle
should provide them tools to

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.296 A:middle
allow them to delete that data

00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:31.456 A:middle
should they choose to stop

00:35:31.456 --> 00:35:32.436 A:middle
sharing it with you.

00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
And finally, you should make

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:38.786 A:middle
sure that you always request

00:35:39.426 --> 00:35:41.246 A:middle
data proportional to your use

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:41.776 A:middle
case.

00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:43.906 A:middle
You should never be asking for

00:35:43.906 --> 00:35:44.926 A:middle
more data than you need.

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:50.146 A:middle
I encourage you all to go to the

00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:51.996 A:middle
Privacy Talk, Better Apps

00:35:51.996 --> 00:35:53.386 A:middle
Through Better Privacy on

00:35:53.386 --> 00:35:55.706 A:middle
Thursday at 4 p.m. and this

00:35:55.706 --> 00:35:58.486 A:middle
covers the whole ecosystem, so

00:35:58.606 --> 00:36:00.116 A:middle
it's a great opportunity to find

00:35:58.606 --> 00:36:00.116 A:middle
it's a great opportunity to find

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:00.616 A:middle
out more.

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:02.886 A:middle
So we've seen the new sample

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.376 A:middle
types that we're introducing to

00:36:04.376 --> 00:36:05.756 A:middle
support Health Records.

00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:09.056 A:middle
We understand how to configure

00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:10.816 A:middle
entitlements and privacy strings

00:36:10.816 --> 00:36:12.566 A:middle
in our app, to request

00:36:12.566 --> 00:36:14.216 A:middle
authorization and to query for

00:36:14.216 --> 00:36:14.596 A:middle
data.

00:36:16.856 --> 00:36:19.066 A:middle
Hopefully I have shown you just

00:36:19.066 --> 00:36:20.826 A:middle
enough to whet your appetite to

00:36:20.826 --> 00:36:24.706 A:middle
go and find out more about FHIR.

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:26.706 A:middle
And we've seen how you can do

00:36:26.706 --> 00:36:28.396 A:middle
more to help protect your users'

00:36:28.396 --> 00:36:28.896 A:middle
privacy.

00:36:36.046 --> 00:36:37.826 A:middle
We continue to be amazed by the

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:39.496 A:middle
fantastic apps that our

00:36:39.496 --> 00:36:41.746 A:middle
developer community creates and

00:36:41.806 --> 00:36:44.096 A:middle
how it really empowers users

00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:45.516 A:middle
when accessing their health

00:36:45.516 --> 00:36:45.846 A:middle
data.

00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:49.036 A:middle
This is a journey that we

00:36:49.036 --> 00:36:51.206 A:middle
started with Health and

00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:53.606 A:middle
HealthKit and it's one that we

00:36:53.606 --> 00:36:55.776 A:middle
have continued with ResearchKit

00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:57.026 A:middle
and CareKit.

00:36:57.826 --> 00:36:59.746 A:middle
And now today with Health

00:36:59.746 --> 00:37:02.686 A:middle
Records and HealthKit we are

00:36:59.746 --> 00:37:02.686 A:middle
Records and HealthKit we are

00:37:02.816 --> 00:37:04.576 A:middle
thrilled to be continuing on

00:37:04.576 --> 00:37:05.766 A:middle
that journey with you.

00:37:06.996 --> 00:37:08.586 A:middle
We can't wait to see what

00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:12.676 A:middle
amazing things you do.

00:37:13.826 --> 00:37:15.556 A:middle
You can find the documentation

00:37:15.556 --> 00:37:16.816 A:middle
that I was talking about earlier

00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:20.146 A:middle
at the URL behind me and we have

00:37:20.146 --> 00:37:21.416 A:middle
some labs.

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:22.926 A:middle
We have a health and fitness lab

00:37:22.926 --> 00:37:24.636 A:middle
immediately after this talk

00:37:24.636 --> 00:37:25.776 A:middle
where we're very happy to get

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:27.456 A:middle
you started with this new API.

00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:30.916 A:middle
Our colleagues Anherika and

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.816 A:middle
Kareem have a talk tomorrow

00:37:32.816 --> 00:37:34.796 A:middle
morning introducing new ways to

00:37:34.796 --> 00:37:36.176 A:middle
work with workouts.
