00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So hello everyone.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:38.086 A:middle
My name is Doug LeMoine.

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:40.596 A:middle
My background is in interaction

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:41.246 A:middle
design.

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.266 A:middle
And here at Apple I'm on a team

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.046 A:middle
of people who works with

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.206 A:middle
developers like you.

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:49.146 A:middle
As a designer I focus on user

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.296 A:middle
interfaces and the ideas to

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.636 A:middle
deliver great user experiences

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.226 A:middle
to the people who use your apps.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:58.976 A:middle
Today I'm here to talk about

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
intent.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
intent.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.386 A:middle
I think there's a thread running

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.476 A:middle
through great apps and really

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:06.566 A:middle
great products.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.586 A:middle
And it has to do with a

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:11.556 A:middle
conscious focus on people, on

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:14.476 A:middle
humans, and what they want and

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.266 A:middle
what they really need.

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:19.356 A:middle
So I'm going to talk about

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.096 A:middle
focusing on the person you want

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:21.616 A:middle
to serve.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.726 A:middle
And I'm going to focus on being

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:25.586 A:middle
intentional.

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.716 A:middle
The intent that I'm interested

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.236 A:middle
in talking about today is less

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.326 A:middle
about a specific design vision

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:36.376 A:middle
or a specific outcome and more

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:37.756 A:middle
on a mindset.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.286 A:middle
How to keep a sharp focus on

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:41.896 A:middle
those people that you're trying

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:44.976 A:middle
to reach and create apps that

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:45.756 A:middle
feel simple.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.176 A:middle
And when an app feels simple

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:52.566 A:middle
users perceive it as natural, an

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.126 A:middle
extension of what they know.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:55.896 A:middle
It feels like it arises from

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:58.486 A:middle
their experience and it flows

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
naturally from what they expect.

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
naturally from what they expect.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.196 A:middle
So I know simple and natural are

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.546 A:middle
sort of designer cliches, we say

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.796 A:middle
this stuff all the time.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
Like, what do we mean?

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.306 A:middle
I think these terms are

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.846 A:middle
shorthand for discussing

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.516 A:middle
qualities of apps that create

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.836 A:middle
feelings of comfort and

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:18.706 A:middle
confidence.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.586 A:middle
When people feel comfortable and

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:23.626 A:middle
confident, when we understand

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.276 A:middle
how a thing works, we can move

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.176 A:middle
through it seamlessly without

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:29.706 A:middle
needed to learn or figure it

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:30.946 A:middle
out.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.716 A:middle
So intent is the kind of thing

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.786 A:middle
is hard to define but you know

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:35.496 A:middle
it when you see it.

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.356 A:middle
So I'm going to show you some

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.746 A:middle
examples of apps that I found in

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.876 A:middle
the last year that really

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:44.026 A:middle
deliver real value to people and

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:45.166 A:middle
really connect with them.

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.236 A:middle
And I'm going to talk about five

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:50.296 A:middle
elements of intentional design

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.246 A:middle
that we can learn from these

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
apps and that you can apply to

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:53.146 A:middle
your work.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.766 A:middle
So let's dive in.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.876 A:middle
So before mobile devices came

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.516 A:middle
around when you traveled abroad

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.516 A:middle
around when you traveled abroad

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.706 A:middle
you'd carry a paper map.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.566 A:middle
And the advantage of the paper

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:06.836 A:middle
map is that when you would

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.736 A:middle
approach a local they would

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.916 A:middle
instantly recognize what kind of

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.826 A:middle
help you needed.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.306 A:middle
So mobile maps have made people

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:16.826 A:middle
more independent, right?

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.816 A:middle
We probably approach fewer

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.466 A:middle
locals when we're traveling

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:20.936 A:middle
abroad.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.136 A:middle
But in the same way that a paper

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.646 A:middle
map invites an interaction,

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.586 A:middle
there's an app called iTranslate

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.336 A:middle
Converse that makes it easy to

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:32.036 A:middle
approach a local with your

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.766 A:middle
iPhone in your hand to ask a

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.596 A:middle
question or get directions.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:37.486 A:middle
Some of you may have seen this

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:39.126 A:middle
on Monday night at the Apple

00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:40.126 A:middle
Design Awards.

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.666 A:middle
I'm going to go through a demo

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.216 A:middle
to really bring out what I think

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:46.056 A:middle
is really intentional about this

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:46.316 A:middle
app.

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:48.786 A:middle
So first of all there's very

00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:49.386 A:middle
little UI.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.736 A:middle
The screen is essentially one

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:51.976 A:middle
big button.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:55.046 A:middle
I tap and hold and start

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:55.536 A:middle
talking.

00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:56.416 A:middle
So I'll show you that in a

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:56.896 A:middle
second.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.506 A:middle
And to be clear the goal of

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.506 A:middle
And to be clear the goal of

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.336 A:middle
iTranslate Converse is to make

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.516 A:middle
conversation easy.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.596 A:middle
The developers have intended

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.966 A:middle
this app to be used together.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:09.586 A:middle
So two people together, one of

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.926 A:middle
whom most likely has never used

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
this app before, probably never

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.676 A:middle
even seen it.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.736 A:middle
So I launched this app really

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.696 A:middle
for real in in the Naples train

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.106 A:middle
station when I was trying to get

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.276 A:middle
on an express train to Rome and

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:26.216 A:middle
the platforms were really

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:26.996 A:middle
confusing.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:29.226 A:middle
So I pulled out my phone, I

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:30.546 A:middle
launched the app, and I walked

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:31.926 A:middle
up to a conductor.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:34.816 A:middle
So I said is this the express

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:35.776 A:middle
train to Rome?

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.926 A:middle
[Computerized Speaking Italian]

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The app translated it into

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.996 A:middle
Italian and the conductor heard.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.956 A:middle
Then I could flip the phone

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.786 A:middle
around and again, what I find

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:53.136 A:middle
interesting in this situation

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:55.236 A:middle
that other person has probably

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.586 A:middle
never seen this app before.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
And they speak in a language

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
And they speak in a language

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:02.376 A:middle
that I didn't speak but the app

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:04.056 A:middle
is smart enough to know that

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
it's ether going to English or

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.396 A:middle
Italian to listen for.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:10.336 A:middle
So the conductor spoke into the

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:11.036 A:middle
microphone.

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Platform Nine.

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:16.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And the app translates it for

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
me.

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:20.346 A:middle
So in reality he spoke English.

00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:23.516 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.856 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.166 A:middle
But he did want to see how the

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.206 A:middle
app worked and I showed him and

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:31.916 A:middle
he was impressed.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:35.876 A:middle
I think the real beauty of this

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.496 A:middle
is that you can make a

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:39.566 A:middle
connection with a person, right?

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.816 A:middle
You can get on the right train

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
like I did, but you also make a

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.996 A:middle
human connection in the process.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:50.006 A:middle
So the developer's intent here

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:51.666 A:middle
is to enable communication

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:53.506 A:middle
between two people in real time.

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.586 A:middle
Just touch the screen and talk.

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:57.456 A:middle
So the first element of

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:59.796 A:middle
intentional design is what I'm

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
going to call radical

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
going to call radical

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.016 A:middle
simplification.

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:04.646 A:middle
So how did they do this?

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.366 A:middle
Well, I think they considered

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.286 A:middle
the context really well, the

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.226 A:middle
context that this will be used

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
in.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.086 A:middle
They took into account where and

00:06:14.086 --> 00:06:15.696 A:middle
when people would pull out their

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:18.326 A:middle
phone and launch their app.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:19.826 A:middle
You're probably in a foreign

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.976 A:middle
country, like this guy you're

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:27.936 A:middle
jetlagged, lost, tired, your

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.256 A:middle
hair is uncombed, your jacket is

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:31.856 A:middle
rumpled.

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.106 A:middle
I'm not even sure if that's a

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:37.156 A:middle
map that he's carrying at this

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:38.466 A:middle
moment, it kind of looks like a

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:38.876 A:middle
book.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:41.766 A:middle
So they remove the UI and allow

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.996 A:middle
people to focus on what they

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.416 A:middle
need, which is to find

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.336 A:middle
something, to ask a question, to

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
get their bearings.

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:52.936 A:middle
And it's amazing how much an

00:06:52.936 --> 00:06:54.866 A:middle
experience can change when

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.756 A:middle
actions are removed from the UI.

00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:58.986 A:middle
So I want to show you another

00:06:58.986 --> 00:06:59.656 A:middle
example.

00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:02.056 A:middle
This is an app called Vanido.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:03.876 A:middle
It helps you learn how to sing.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:06.626 A:middle
So if you're the kind of person

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:08.366 A:middle
who wants to learn how to sing

00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:11.426 A:middle
with literally no one hearing

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:13.696 A:middle
your or judging you, this app is

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:14.246 A:middle
amazing.

that it has stripped away what

music education looks like,

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:18.846 A:middle

you're singing and it's way up

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:50.516 A:middle
mean, that's the first

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.736 A:middle
manifestation of intent and

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.116 A:middle

00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.276 A:middle
reduce your risk.

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:07.356 A:middle
So next I want to talk about

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.786 A:middle
people and about orienting your

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:12.306 A:middle
design around what people really

00:09:12.306 --> 00:09:12.716 A:middle
want.

00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:14.426 A:middle
So what do they want?

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.466 A:middle
I think this is worth exploring

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:17.756 A:middle
because it's almost never

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:18.426 A:middle
obvious.

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:22.536 A:middle
The first needs that you see

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:24.156 A:middle
when you start kind of looking

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:27.206 A:middle
at people and the users that you

00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:28.806 A:middle
might want to serve are

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:30.476 A:middle
superficial and you need to dig

00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:31.436 A:middle
past those.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:33.206 A:middle
They might be the first ones

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.616 A:middle
that you think about addressing

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.776 A:middle
or they might be the ones that

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.406 A:middle
pulled you into the problem in

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:39.876 A:middle
the first place, but you need to

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:42.516 A:middle
keep digging because those

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:45.096 A:middle
superficial needs often mask

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:46.946 A:middle
deeper needs, right, you could

00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:48.646 A:middle
solve them but not really solve

00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:50.396 A:middle
the persons' problem.

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.556 A:middle
So you have to keep digging.

00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:54.516 A:middle
The second element of

00:09:54.516 --> 00:09:55.786 A:middle
intentional design that I want

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:57.546 A:middle
to get into here is called deep

00:09:57.546 --> 00:09:58.506 A:middle

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.046 A:middle
So knowing the person that you

So knowing the person that you

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.706 A:middle
want to reach and the actually

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:02.796 A:middle
problem that they have.

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.726 A:middle
The deeper you dig the more

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:07.386 A:middle
likely you are to see where the

00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:09.616 A:middle
real opportunity to meet their

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
needs is.

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.196 A:middle
And the app that really shows

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.066 A:middle
this off, in my opinion, is

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.296 A:middle
called Streaks Workout.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.916 A:middle
So it's a workout app but I want

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.076 A:middle
to go behind the scenes a little

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:19.306 A:middle
bit.

00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.176 A:middle

it looks pretty simple.

You pick a workout duration and

00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:29.976 A:middle
you go.

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:34.716 A:middle
But personally, I'll confess

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.466 A:middle
that I don't love working out

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:40.826 A:middle
and I've tried many workout apps

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.566 A:middle
that I just don't stick with and

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:46.506 A:middle
I want to thank any developers

00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:47.776 A:middle

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.456 A:middle
workout apps that I've tried

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:51.356 A:middle

staying motivated.

00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:14.136 A:middle
So inertia, just to be clear, is

00:11:14.136 --> 00:11:16.146 A:middle
a disinclination to move.

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:18.156 A:middle

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:28.126 A:middle
how Streaks Workout helps users

00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:28.996 A:middle
handle this.

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:31.286 A:middle
So when you first launch the app

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.336 A:middle
you select movements that you

00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:34.666 A:middle
want to do, these exercise

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.006 A:middle
movements on a screen like this.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:38.576 A:middle
And there's dozens of these

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.876 A:middle
things.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.216 A:middle

go.

00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:50.856 A:middle
And the app does the rest.

00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:52.586 A:middle
It auto selects from your

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:53.946 A:middle
movements and it picks a

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.106 A:middle

those either.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
Specifically, what I think works

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:32.236 A:middle
well is that the app confronts

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:33.766 A:middle
the inertia that people might

00:12:33.766 --> 00:12:35.416 A:middle
feel by introducing a sense of

randomness and removing work.

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.886 A:middle
So the developers recognize that

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.906 A:middle
each step in the process of

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:44.826 A:middle
doing a workout requires a

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.126 A:middle
choice, requires someone to

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:49.336 A:middle
think about what they want and

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.646 A:middle
these decisions are not things

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.906 A:middle
that everyone wants to make.

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.316 A:middle
So you only choose movements

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:55.906 A:middle
once.

00:12:56.006 --> 00:12:57.636 A:middle
After that the app does it for

00:12:57.636 --> 00:12:57.856 A:middle
you.

00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.326 A:middle
And you never choose the

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:47.956 A:middle
news.

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:49.116 A:middle
There are lots of apps that

00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:50.646 A:middle
allow you to do those things.

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:52.236 A:middle
But I'm curious about what

00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.416 A:middle
inspired this.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.886 A:middle
Whenever I see something unique

00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:57.816 A:middle
like this I wonder what's behind

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:00.536 A:middle
it because it's unique and it's

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:00.536 A:middle
it because it's unique and it's

00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:01.716 A:middle
implemented really well.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:03.786 A:middle
So I asked the developers of

00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
Streaks Workout.

00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:09.436 A:middle
And it's such a common story to

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
hear about how an app originated

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:14.066 A:middle
with an idea that came out of

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:14.686 A:middle
prison.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:19.406 A:middle
So specifically, their idea

00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:21.196 A:middle
originated with how inmates in

00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:22.946 A:middle
prison keep workouts new and

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:23.596 A:middle
interesting.

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:25.526 A:middle
So I want to walk you through

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.436 A:middle
how that works.

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
So in prison you take a normal

00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:31.786 A:middle
deck of cards and at the

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.656 A:middle
beginning of each workout you

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.136 A:middle
would assign a movement to each

00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:35.626 A:middle
suit.

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:38.106 A:middle
So today diamonds are crunches.

00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:40.346 A:middle
The numbers on the cards

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.356 A:middle
represent the number of reps per

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:42.856 A:middle
movement.

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:44.416 A:middle
So at the beginning of the

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.456 A:middle
workout you'd put the deck face

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:49.106 A:middle
down and you'd start drawing and

00:14:49.106 --> 00:14:50.206 A:middle
each card would deliver a

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:51.566 A:middle
movement and a rep count.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:53.606 A:middle
OK, everyone eight crunches.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.096 A:middle
So the original app concept was

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.056 A:middle
a literal recreation of this.

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.056 A:middle
a literal recreation of this.

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:02.086 A:middle
This is an early comp and they

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:04.106 A:middle
also prototyped shuffling and

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:08.276 A:middle
flipping cards to try to kind of

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:11.706 A:middle
replicate the origin of this

00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:12.556 A:middle
prison workout.

00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:14.466 A:middle
But they quickly moved past the

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:15.566 A:middle
literal approach.

00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:17.876 A:middle
They didn't stick to the literal

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.416 A:middle
deck of cards because it carried

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.666 A:middle
too many constraints.

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.606 A:middle
Four suits would limit the

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.686 A:middle
number of movements that you

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:25.026 A:middle
could do in each workout and

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:26.266 A:middle
people would somehow need to

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:28.086 A:middle
remember that diamonds

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.546 A:middle
represented crunches in that

00:15:29.546 --> 00:15:31.386 A:middle
particular workout and that's

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:32.136 A:middle
work, right?

00:15:33.496 --> 00:15:35.056 A:middle
So instead they focused on the

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.626 A:middle
value that they wanted to bring.

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:39.586 A:middle
They wanted to help people make

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.066 A:middle
a habit of working out.

00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:44.616 A:middle
So they acknowledged that people

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:46.516 A:middle
felt inertia when they were

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:47.846 A:middle
going to launch a workout app

00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:49.846 A:middle
and they removed as much as

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.466 A:middle
possible that might trigger that

00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:53.446 A:middle
and they stayed true to the

00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.366 A:middle
original intent of the prison

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.226 A:middle
workout, which is that spirit of

00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:58.816 A:middle
randomness and surprise.

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
And that's what I mean by deep

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
And that's what I mean by deep

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.376 A:middle
understanding.

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:03.806 A:middle
Knowing the person that you want

00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
to reach and the actual problem

00:16:05.476 --> 00:16:06.436 A:middle
that they might have.

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:08.476 A:middle
So the superficial approach to

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:10.076 A:middle
this workout would have been

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:11.286 A:middle
just a typical workout app,

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:11.646 A:middle
right?

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.036 A:middle
Of course people want to get

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:13.516 A:middle
healthy.

00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:15.756 A:middle
But what people really want, or

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:17.326 A:middle
what I really want anyway is to

00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.286 A:middle
get past the boredom and that

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:20.626 A:middle
inertia and they've addressed

00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:21.306 A:middle
that for me.

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:27.306 A:middle
So knowing users is nothing new.

00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:30.386 A:middle
I'm guessing a lot of you here

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.726 A:middle
have personas and market

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:35.106 A:middle
segments and you do surveys and

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.796 A:middle
other kinds of user research

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.336 A:middle
focus groups.

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:40.326 A:middle
Maybe you create experience maps

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:41.846 A:middle
and customer journeys and user

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:42.536 A:middle
stories.

00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.086 A:middle
All of those can be useful

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:45.616 A:middle
models.

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.266 A:middle
But they have to feel authentic,

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:48.776 A:middle
right?

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
They actually have to feel like

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:51.366 A:middle
people.

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:54.776 A:middle
That can make focus easier and

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:56.316 A:middle
it can help teams kind of come

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.966 A:middle
together around a vision.

00:16:57.966 --> 00:16:59.676 A:middle
As long as you share a common

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.856 A:middle
understanding and you feel a

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.856 A:middle
understanding and you feel a

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:04.356 A:middle
real empathy for the person that

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.576 A:middle
you're designing for.

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:06.705 A:middle
Those can work.

00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:10.935 A:middle
But too often those artifacts of

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:12.836 A:middle
needs and goals and skills, they

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:14.165 A:middle
just feel artificial.

00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:16.685 A:middle
They may not connect with

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:17.286 A:middle
everyone.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.816 A:middle
They feel complicated or distant

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:20.576 A:middle
or corny.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:24.036 A:middle
So for a moment I want to talk

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.586 A:middle
about how much easier it is to

00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:28.376 A:middle
make some something when you

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:30.226 A:middle
really care about the person

00:17:30.226 --> 00:17:31.266 A:middle
you're making it for.

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:34.286 A:middle
So I first heard about this

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.316 A:middle
story that I'm going to tell you

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:35.836 A:middle
in a book.

00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:38.146 A:middle
It's by a guy named Alan Cooper,

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:40.296 A:middle
he's a software developer from

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.816 A:middle
the early days, and his claim to

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:44.686 A:middle
fame is that he created a

00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:47.276 A:middle
prototype that became Visual

00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:47.786 A:middle
Basic.

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:50.776 A:middle
And this is an actual pixel

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:53.646 A:middle
resolution of Visual Basic 1.0

00:17:54.576 --> 00:17:55.816 A:middle
on a 4K display.

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
It's pretty amazing.

00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.696 A:middle
So Alan built this with a small

00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.696 A:middle
So Alan built this with a small

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:03.986 A:middle
team and as he did it he began

00:18:03.986 --> 00:18:05.876 A:middle
to recognize a problem in

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.716 A:middle
maintaining a focus on what

00:18:07.716 --> 00:18:08.716 A:middle
people really want.

00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:10.596 A:middle
And he tells this great story in

00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:13.866 A:middle
a book about another invention

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.286 A:middle
and that story is a parable of

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:20.026 A:middle
how powerful knowing people can

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:21.666 A:middle
be, knowing the person that

00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:22.696 A:middle
you're designing for.

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:25.506 A:middle
So apologies if I got your hopes

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.596 A:middle
up about Visual Basic.

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:27.676 A:middle
I'm actually not going to talk

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:28.246 A:middle
about that.

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:30.986 A:middle
I want to focus on this story

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:32.366 A:middle
and kind of extend it a little

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:32.686 A:middle
bit.

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.226 A:middle
So the invention that he talks

00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:37.496 A:middle
about is the Rollaboard

00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:38.346 A:middle
Suitcase.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.596 A:middle
So this is the patent form for

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:41.356 A:middle
the Rollaboard.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.746 A:middle
So nowadays the suitcase might

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.186 A:middle
seem pretty unremarkable.

00:18:47.236 --> 00:18:49.106 A:middle
For most of us this is just a

00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:51.016 A:middle
suitcase, big deal.

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.386 A:middle
But it actually hasn't been

00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:54.296 A:middle
around for that long.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:56.676 A:middle
The patent was filed in 1989.

00:18:57.026 --> 00:18:58.086 A:middle
People have been traveling

00:18:58.276 --> 00:18:59.086 A:middle
forever though.

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
So why did it take so long to

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
So why did it take so long to

00:19:01.706 --> 00:19:03.806 A:middle
design something so obvious?

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:06.556 A:middle
The inventor was a guy named

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:07.276 A:middle
Robert Plath.

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:09.496 A:middle
I'm guessing not a household

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.486 A:middle
name, but more on that in a

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:11.746 A:middle
minute.

00:19:13.136 --> 00:19:15.126 A:middle
So what was innovative about

00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:15.536 A:middle
this?

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:17.556 A:middle
Well, I think the innovations

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.176 A:middle
are subtle.

00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.666 A:middle
It wasn't the wheels.

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:22.476 A:middle
Many patents had been filed for

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:24.146 A:middle
wheeled suitcases before.

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:25.396 A:middle
This is from the '70s.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.416 A:middle
So the wheels are underneath and

00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:29.966 A:middle
it's also got some kind of leash

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:30.406 A:middle
thing.

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:35.166 A:middle
Suitcase manufactures had been

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:36.826 A:middle
trying to put wheels on

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:38.586 A:middle
suitcases as far back as the

00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:41.006 A:middle
'40s and this actually has some

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:43.476 A:middle
kind of other leash thing, some

00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:45.706 A:middle
grabber thing that you can see

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:46.356 A:middle
right there.

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:49.716 A:middle
So clearly people have been

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:51.306 A:middle
trying to figure out a way to

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.466 A:middle
not carry heavy things.

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:56.176 A:middle
So if you worked in the luggage

00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:59.176 A:middle
industry in 1989, you probably

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
thought you'd already innovated.

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
thought you'd already innovated.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:02.876 A:middle
You weren't worried about this

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:04.186 A:middle
new patent I'm guessing.

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.446 A:middle
But we all know what happened,

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:06.736 A:middle
right?

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:08.456 A:middle
The new design became the de

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:10.416 A:middle
facto design of suitcases.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.526 A:middle
And the improvements in

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:13.846 A:middle
retrospect are totally obvious.

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.656 A:middle
There's a handle at the top so

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:17.336 A:middle
the whole suitcase it oriented

00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:18.126 A:middle
to be upright.

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:20.326 A:middle
It's easy to grab and pull and

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:20.686 A:middle
pivot.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:23.036 A:middle
That is the evolution of the

00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:23.566 A:middle
leash.

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:27.046 A:middle
Second the wheels, right?

00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:28.546 A:middle
The wheels are placed on the

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:29.946 A:middle
edge so they're only fully

00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:31.596 A:middle
engaged when the suitcase is

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:32.086 A:middle
tilted.

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:35.686 A:middle
And finally the size, it's small

00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:38.006 A:middle
enough to lift and place in an

00:20:38.006 --> 00:20:40.426 A:middle
overhead bin.

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:42.216 A:middle
So nothing particularly

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:44.196 A:middle
revolutionary but the inventor

00:20:44.546 --> 00:20:47.166 A:middle
Robert Plath made each decision

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:48.986 A:middle
to serve a really specific

00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:51.716 A:middle
person, a person who traveled

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:52.386 A:middle
for a living.

00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.626 A:middle
Robert Plath was a pilot for

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.716 A:middle
Northwest Airlines.

00:20:55.716 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
He intimately knew the pain of

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.306 A:middle
lugging and lifting heavy

00:20:59.306 --> 00:20:59.796 A:middle
things.

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.916 A:middle
He did it every day.

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.916 A:middle
He did it every day.

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
And he deeply understood what

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
people like him wanted, to move

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:07.356 A:middle
with ease while looking

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:08.796 A:middle
professional, and he made

00:21:08.826 --> 00:21:10.826 A:middle
something perfectly suited for

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:11.116 A:middle
that.

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:13.446 A:middle
So what I find really

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:14.356 A:middle
interesting is that at the

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:17.456 A:middle
times, 1989, there were only

00:21:17.456 --> 00:21:18.986 A:middle
about 100,000 travel

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.066 A:middle
professionals as the Census Data

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:22.556 A:middle
called them, but pilots, flight

00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:23.856 A:middle
attendants, people in the travel

00:21:23.856 --> 00:21:24.426 A:middle
industry.

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.776 A:middle
That 100,000 might seem like a

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:28.666 A:middle
lot, but when you compare that

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:30.986 A:middle
number to the overall market of

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:32.676 A:middle
people who traveled a couple

00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:35.326 A:middle
times a year, just like more

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:36.696 A:middle
than 100 million at the time,

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
and that's just Census Data from

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:42.996 A:middle
the U.S., his target user,

00:21:43.226 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
quote-unquote, was a really

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:47.146 A:middle
specific person that represented

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:50.176 A:middle
only 0.1% of 1% of the market.

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.506 A:middle
So what I'm saying is that

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.456 A:middle
typical methods of market

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.046 A:middle
identification probably would

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:59.756 A:middle
not have led Robert Plath to

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:00.936 A:middle
focus so narrowly.

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:00.936 A:middle
focus so narrowly.

00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:04.156 A:middle
He focused on an extreme use

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.516 A:middle
case, a person who traveled all

00:22:07.596 --> 00:22:08.596 A:middle
the time.

00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:10.096 A:middle
So I'm using extreme

00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:13.176 A:middle
intentionally to emphasize that

00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:14.686 A:middle
he focused on what we might call

00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:15.656 A:middle
an edge case.

00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:18.256 A:middle
The market size was really small

00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:21.296 A:middle
and his solution was kind of

00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:21.896 A:middle
whacky.

00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:23.706 A:middle
It looked really different.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:26.536 A:middle
It implied a new kind of default

00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:28.806 A:middle
way of interacting with your

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:29.376 A:middle
luggage.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.956 A:middle
So he focused on the needs of

00:22:33.956 --> 00:22:35.936 A:middle
people he intimately knew and

00:22:35.936 --> 00:22:38.146 A:middle
that extreme focus allowed the

00:22:38.146 --> 00:22:40.246 A:middle
real needs of a lot of people to

00:22:40.246 --> 00:22:41.326 A:middle
come to the surface.

00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:43.036 A:middle
So his focus gave him the

00:22:43.036 --> 00:22:45.926 A:middle
freedom to arrive at an extreme

00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:46.556 A:middle
solution.

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:49.336 A:middle
So the third element of intent

00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:51.306 A:middle
is extreme focus.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.936 A:middle
So what might seem like an edge

00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:56.676 A:middle
case could be what frees you to

00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:59.176 A:middle
reorient or refocus your design.

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.886 A:middle
Make it more coherent.

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.886 A:middle
Make it more coherent.

00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Make it simpler.

00:23:02.216 --> 00:23:03.616 A:middle
And therefore actually reach

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:04.506 A:middle
more people.

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:09.796 A:middle
So let's relate extreme to our

00:23:10.186 --> 00:23:10.406 A:middle
work.

00:23:10.406 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
Is there a way to relate extreme

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.266 A:middle
to the work that we do?

00:23:13.966 --> 00:23:15.646 A:middle
I think there is and I think

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.196 A:middle
being extreme can be really

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:19.576 A:middle
worthwhile but you have to nail

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:19.706 A:middle
it.

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:22.846 A:middle
So you might not immediately

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:25.696 A:middle
associate the words extreme and

00:23:26.086 --> 00:23:26.856 A:middle
weather app.

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:29.766 A:middle
But Carrot Weather is a really

00:23:29.766 --> 00:23:32.686 A:middle
compelling illustration of being

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:33.456 A:middle
extreme.

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:36.396 A:middle
So on the surface it's a weather

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:36.646 A:middle
app.

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:37.926 A:middle
So let's check the weather

00:23:37.926 --> 00:23:38.646 A:middle
forecast.

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I wonder how many licks it

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.626 A:middle
takes to get to the center of a

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.446 A:middle
human skull.

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:48.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So right, they're not typical

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.326 A:middle
forecasts.

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.086 A:middle
The voice of Carrot, which is

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:52.476 A:middle
the robotic voice that you

00:23:52.476 --> 00:23:54.676 A:middle
heard, has personality and

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:57.136 A:middle
attitude and a little bit of an

00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:58.196 A:middle
edge.

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.606 A:middle
You probably think this sunshine

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.606 A:middle
You probably think this sunshine

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.416 A:middle
means that things are starting

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:03.326 A:middle
to look up for you.

00:24:03.906 --> 00:24:04.456 A:middle
They're not.

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:08.256 A:middle
So you might ask is that even a

00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:08.926 A:middle
forecast [laughing]?

00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:14.456 A:middle
So sometimes when I read these

00:24:14.456 --> 00:24:15.996 A:middle
things I just feel like it's

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.046 A:middle
being mean to me.

00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:20.066 A:middle
It's definitely got an attitude

00:24:20.346 --> 00:24:22.096 A:middle
but the key information is super

00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:23.596 A:middle
readable and the screen is

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:25.036 A:middle
really nicely organized.

00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:28.216 A:middle
The color scheme changes

00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:29.826 A:middle
according to the time of day and

00:24:29.826 --> 00:24:30.906 A:middle
it's really playful.

00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:32.616 A:middle
And it's got those illustrations

00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:33.766 A:middle
along the bottom that are

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.726 A:middle
sometimes bizarre and often

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:38.366 A:middle
really funny.

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:41.386 A:middle
So the forecast is only one of

00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:43.286 A:middle
quite a few unique elements in

00:24:43.286 --> 00:24:43.706 A:middle
the app.

00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:46.066 A:middle
So I ask the developer whose

00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:47.796 A:middle
name is Brian Mueller, to help

00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:49.756 A:middle
me understand where this came

00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:52.316 A:middle
from and he told me something

00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:52.966 A:middle
interesting.

00:24:53.356 --> 00:24:54.916 A:middle
He said that when we writes in

00:24:54.916 --> 00:24:57.186 A:middle
the voice of Carrot, he's

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:59.866 A:middle
channeling the personalities of

00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:01.456 A:middle
people really close to him --

00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:01.456 A:middle
people really close to him --

00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:03.696 A:middle
his wife, his sister, and his

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:04.136 A:middle
mom.

00:25:04.496 --> 00:25:08.126 A:middle
And these forecasts are a form

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:11.706 A:middle
of conversation with them.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:14.306 A:middle
So the lesson is that the people

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:15.756 A:middle
that Brian is trying to reach,

00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:17.976 A:middle
the people that he's speaking to

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.486 A:middle
with these forecasts are

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:20.756 A:middle
actually really specific.

00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:23.196 A:middle
And I think that's what makes

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.366 A:middle
his apps stand out.

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:26.246 A:middle
The edginess helps him connect

00:25:26.246 --> 00:25:26.856 A:middle
with people.

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:28.566 A:middle
And it's not surprising to me

00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.246 A:middle
that he's had so much success in

00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:30.976 A:middle
the app store.

00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:33.486 A:middle
The personal touch is what

00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:35.666 A:middle
allows his app to deeply connect

00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:38.926 A:middle
with the rest of us.

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:42.706 A:middle
Obviously personality isn't the

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:45.056 A:middle
sole province of weather apps.

00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:47.596 A:middle
All apps can deliver something

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:48.096 A:middle
like this.

00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:50.326 A:middle
All apps can feel handcrafted

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:51.096 A:middle
and special.

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.096 A:middle
And that's the fourth element of

00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
intent that I want to talk

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:54.476 A:middle
about.

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:56.776 A:middle
Intentionally designed apps feel

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:57.636 A:middle
personal.

00:25:58.096 --> 00:25:59.316 A:middle
They create a personal

00:25:59.316 --> 00:25:59.866 A:middle
connection.

00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:03.386 A:middle
So the point isn't to spice up

00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:04.806 A:middle
your copy, right?

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:07.516 A:middle
The point is that spicy copy in

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:08.966 A:middle
the right context feels

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:09.666 A:middle
memorable.

00:26:12.356 --> 00:26:14.826 A:middle
And it must be said that the

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:16.196 A:middle
personality of Carrot is

00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
probably not for everyone.

00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:20.496 A:middle
And I talked with Brian he

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.636 A:middle
commented on this.

00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:24.336 A:middle
So you can probably imagine the

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.316 A:middle
email and Tweets that he gets

00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:29.786 A:middle
from people who are surprised or

00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:31.846 A:middle
upset or offended by the

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:33.366 A:middle
forecast after they download the

00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:33.636 A:middle
app.

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.026 A:middle
Like, you know, how dare he

00:26:37.026 --> 00:26:39.526 A:middle
insult meteorologists like this?

00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:42.976 A:middle
So he offers an olive branch --

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:45.546 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.166 A:middle
To these disgruntled souls.

00:26:48.766 --> 00:26:50.636 A:middle
They can adjust the personality

00:26:50.636 --> 00:26:52.096 A:middle
from the default, which as you

00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:53.496 A:middle
saw was Homicidal.

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:56.196 A:middle
You could go the left for less

00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.116 A:middle
edge and to the right for more.

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
But the bottom line just to be

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
But the bottom line just to be

00:27:02.896 --> 00:27:05.646 A:middle
clear is that edgy text would be

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:08.056 A:middle
less funny or perhaps not funny

00:27:08.056 --> 00:27:10.106 A:middle
at all if the app didn't work,

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:10.766 A:middle
right?

00:27:10.986 --> 00:27:12.546 A:middle
It's a good weather app with

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:14.436 A:middle
simple navigation and a playful

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:14.726 A:middle
UI.

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.866 A:middle
The extreme personality though

00:27:18.286 --> 00:27:20.436 A:middle
is what gives life and sprit to

00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:20.556 A:middle
it.

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:21.506 A:middle
So when I get a Carrot

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:24.246 A:middle
notification it's similar to the

00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:26.506 A:middle
feeling that I have when I go

00:27:26.506 --> 00:27:28.816 A:middle
out to a local restaurant or bar

00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:31.266 A:middle
where everyone knows my name,

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:31.706 A:middle
right?

00:27:31.706 --> 00:27:33.996 A:middle
It's enjoyable, it's personal,

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:35.036 A:middle
and it's comfortable.

00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:39.296 A:middle
So we've got four things that

00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:41.076 A:middle
characterize intent and the

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:42.576 A:middle
behavior of intentionally

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:43.416 A:middle
designed apps.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.466 A:middle
And I want to flip things around

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:47.596 A:middle
for a moment and talk about what

00:27:47.596 --> 00:27:48.676 A:middle
happens when you're not

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:49.446 A:middle
intentional.

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:52.046 A:middle
In other words, where does bad

00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:53.046 A:middle
UI come from?

00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:55.926 A:middle
So I think the best friends and

00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:57.946 A:middle
the worst enemies to designing

00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:00.126 A:middle
intentionally are all of the

00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:00.126 A:middle
intentionally are all of the

00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:02.336 A:middle
systems and patterns that we've

00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:04.096 A:middle
internalized as we've gained

00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:05.346 A:middle
experience in the work that we

00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:05.656 A:middle
do.

00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:08.426 A:middle
This experience allows us to

00:28:08.426 --> 00:28:10.026 A:middle
make decisions quickly and to be

00:28:10.026 --> 00:28:11.786 A:middle
really efficient in that work.

00:28:13.236 --> 00:28:15.876 A:middle
But these familiar patterns get

00:28:15.876 --> 00:28:17.756 A:middle
in the way of our ability to

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.566 A:middle
reckon with new problems.

00:28:19.706 --> 00:28:20.726 A:middle
Sometimes we won't even

00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:22.226 A:middle
recognize that the problems are

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:24.626 A:middle
new and this is true of anyone

00:28:24.686 --> 00:28:26.636 A:middle
who has tried to make anything

00:28:26.636 --> 00:28:28.886 A:middle
new ever, right?

00:28:29.156 --> 00:28:31.146 A:middle
Suitcases once had a form.

00:28:31.586 --> 00:28:33.266 A:middle
They were rectangular and the

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:34.726 A:middle
long side was down.

00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:37.966 A:middle
That form was adjusted but the

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.546 A:middle
fundamental elements were always

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:40.536 A:middle
taken as a given.

00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:43.426 A:middle
The wheels were tacked on but

00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:45.476 A:middle
the overall form stayed the

00:28:45.476 --> 00:28:45.966 A:middle
same.

00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:49.826 A:middle
For decades smart people

00:28:50.246 --> 00:28:52.306 A:middle
considered this form and stopped

00:28:52.306 --> 00:28:52.696 A:middle
there.

00:28:53.186 --> 00:28:55.246 A:middle
It took someone with a very

00:28:55.246 --> 00:28:57.646 A:middle
sharp focus on an extreme

00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
audience to break out of this

00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
audience to break out of this

00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:03.446 A:middle
pattern, right, and turn the

00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.726 A:middle
form on it's head [laughing].

00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:06.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:07.516 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:10.046 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
So we apply patterns

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:12.906 A:middle
automatically.

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
Our brains make connections

00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:17.306 A:middle
quickly and that has benefits,

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:17.506 A:middle
right?

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.996 A:middle
It helps us work efficiently.

00:29:19.606 --> 00:29:21.956 A:middle
It helps us be consistent, but

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:23.206 A:middle
it also prevents us from

00:29:23.206 --> 00:29:25.506 A:middle
noticing the obvious and

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:27.766 A:middle
challenging it, asking

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.106 A:middle
fundamental questions, why does

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:31.026 A:middle
this thing need to be this way?

00:29:31.426 --> 00:29:33.786 A:middle
So as a UI designer it's really

00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:36.356 A:middle
tempting always to draw on

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:38.336 A:middle
familiar UI elements to solve

00:29:38.336 --> 00:29:39.216 A:middle
new problems.

00:29:39.826 --> 00:29:41.786 A:middle
I'm sure you're familiar with

00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:42.906 A:middle
the house icon.

00:29:43.306 --> 00:29:44.926 A:middle
It made sense in a desktop

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:45.476 A:middle
browser.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:48.766 A:middle
A browser is a frame for the

00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.026 A:middle
Internet universe.

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.956 A:middle
A browser home button will lift

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:55.456 A:middle
you out of whatever corner of

00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:57.776 A:middle
the dark web that you found

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.036 A:middle
yourself in and allows you to

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.036 A:middle
yourself in and allows you to

00:30:00.036 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
get out of there.

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:02.896 A:middle
So that notion of home was

00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:04.336 A:middle
extended to iPhone and the

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.756 A:middle
behavior is similar.

00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:08.776 A:middle
It's a shortcut, it's an easy

00:30:08.776 --> 00:30:10.406 A:middle
button, home is a starting

00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:13.556 A:middle
place, and unlike in real life,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:14.926 A:middle
home is a place that you can

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
always return to with a simple

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:17.636 A:middle
gesture.

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:20.646 A:middle
You can go home whenever you

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:21.016 A:middle
want.

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:24.326 A:middle
So home is also a familiar

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:25.416 A:middle
notion in the finder.

00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:27.206 A:middle
Here the spirit is more like --

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:30.556 A:middle
you followed the river to it's

00:30:30.556 --> 00:30:31.396 A:middle
headwaters.

00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:33.756 A:middle
On the Mac, home represents a

00:30:33.756 --> 00:30:34.526 A:middle
container.

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:36.046 A:middle
Everything is in here.

00:30:36.486 --> 00:30:37.686 A:middle
You don't need to look anywhere

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:37.986 A:middle
else.

00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:40.866 A:middle
you have reached the source.

00:30:42.736 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
Home in these contexts offers

00:30:45.496 --> 00:30:48.236 A:middle
reliability, safety, an ability

00:30:48.236 --> 00:30:50.066 A:middle
to return as you navigate

00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:50.616 A:middle
outward.

00:30:51.076 --> 00:30:54.256 A:middle
And it's clear obvious utility

00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:56.926 A:middle
elsewhere on the platform might

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.716 A:middle
seem like a reasonable choice as

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.466 A:middle
a tab bar icon, right?

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.466 A:middle
a tab bar icon, right?

00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:04.866 A:middle
Except there's a crucial

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:06.456 A:middle
difference in using the notion

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:07.726 A:middle
of home in a tab bar.

00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:12.226 A:middle
To be blunt, an app isn't a

00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:14.656 A:middle
frame containing god knows what.

00:31:15.686 --> 00:31:18.216 A:middle
A typical app offers specific

00:31:18.216 --> 00:31:20.026 A:middle
things, specific contents,

00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:21.746 A:middle
specific tools, specific

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:22.426 A:middle
actions.

00:31:22.746 --> 00:31:24.826 A:middle
And a tab bar is a quick

00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:26.726 A:middle
expression of the overall

00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:28.246 A:middle
utility of your app.

00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:30.066 A:middle
It's a high-level map of your

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:31.433 A:middle
app.

00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:33.676 A:middle
So let's use an example that's

00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:36.016 A:middle
close to home -- the tab bar of

00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.866 A:middle
WWDC app.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.486 A:middle
So we all can get a quick

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:43.946 A:middle
understanding of the scope of

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:45.596 A:middle
information that's available in

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:47.226 A:middle
the app simply by scanning the

00:31:47.226 --> 00:31:47.786 A:middle
tab bar.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.196 A:middle
We can guess at what content

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.716 A:middle
might be in each tab.

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:54.756 A:middle
So tab bar icons and tab bar

00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:56.556 A:middle
labels should be as direct as

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:57.246 A:middle
possible.

00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:00.086 A:middle
And this directness will then

00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:00.086 A:middle
And this directness will then

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:02.896 A:middle
limit what each tab can contain

00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:03.766 A:middle
and that's great.

00:32:04.976 --> 00:32:06.296 A:middle
Directness creates

00:32:06.296 --> 00:32:07.246 A:middle
predictability.

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.166 A:middle
So the app may not do

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:12.836 A:middle
everything, right, no app does

00:32:12.836 --> 00:32:13.346 A:middle
everything.

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.166 A:middle
But people won't have to hunt

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.466 A:middle
around to figure out what it

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:17.656 A:middle
does and doesn't do.

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.726 A:middle
So when I talk about home I'm

00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:21.816 A:middle
talking about a metaphor,

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:24.816 A:middle
homeland, a home base.

00:32:27.056 --> 00:32:29.186 A:middle
So let's just dig in to why home

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:29.946 A:middle
doesn't work.

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.506 A:middle
First it's overly broad and it

00:32:32.506 --> 00:32:33.516 A:middle
feels generic.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.126 A:middle
And I think it's a copout.

00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:37.996 A:middle
You're avoiding a decision by

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:39.246 A:middle
naming a tab Home.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:41.876 A:middle
The perceived comforts of home

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:44.236 A:middle
as an icon in a label are

00:32:44.236 --> 00:32:45.406 A:middle
getting in the way of being

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:47.596 A:middle
direct, of clearly and directly

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:48.976 A:middle
communicating the scope of

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.616 A:middle
what's in your app.

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:53.236 A:middle
If your app is a meditation app

00:32:53.776 --> 00:32:55.796 A:middle
and offers content related to

00:32:55.856 --> 00:32:57.046 A:middle
meditating and building a

00:32:57.046 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
meditation practice, imagine the

00:32:57.046 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
meditation practice, imagine the

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.666 A:middle
impression that it would leave

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:04.686 A:middle
on people if not only the tab

00:33:04.686 --> 00:33:06.456 A:middle
bar was more direct, but the

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:07.976 A:middle
directness of the tab bar

00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.256 A:middle
enforced a simplicity and an

00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:12.296 A:middle
order on the content that you

00:33:12.296 --> 00:33:12.926 A:middle
display.

00:33:13.006 --> 00:33:15.576 A:middle
And that content was predictable

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:17.356 A:middle
and directly organized.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.236 A:middle
So indirect labels feel

00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:22.246 A:middle
conventional and they feel safe

00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:23.726 A:middle
but they mask utility.

00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:25.786 A:middle
Like a storage locker you're

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:27.066 A:middle
putting your valuable stuff

00:33:27.196 --> 00:33:29.066 A:middle
behind a door that's anonymous

00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:29.946 A:middle
and inscrutable.

00:33:30.246 --> 00:33:32.176 A:middle
And this is what I mean by

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.396 A:middle
unintentional design.

00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:36.436 A:middle
No one intends to be indirect.

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.516 A:middle
Being intentional will lead to

00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:41.886 A:middle
cleaner and clearer

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:42.706 A:middle
communication.

00:33:42.706 --> 00:33:44.846 A:middle
And this brings me to my final

00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:45.936 A:middle
element of intent.

00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:47.976 A:middle
Direct communication.

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:49.806 A:middle
Intentionally design things.

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.366 A:middle
Clearly communicate to the

00:33:51.366 --> 00:33:52.466 A:middle
people who use them.

00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:55.766 A:middle
And the way to achieve this is

00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:57.486 A:middle
to draw on what people learn on

00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:59.606 A:middle
the platform and in the world.

00:34:00.156 --> 00:34:01.456 A:middle
So I want to show you a couple

00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:04.266 A:middle
of last quick examples of apps

00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:06.616 A:middle
that rely on a familiar form to

00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:08.356 A:middle
make interactions feel useful.

00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:12.065 A:middle
So the core concept of an app

00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.666 A:middle
called Tinycards is to bring

00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:15.045 A:middle
flashcards on to a mobile

00:34:15.045 --> 00:34:15.636 A:middle
advice.

00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:17.416 A:middle
You can use them to memorize

00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.315 A:middle
pretty much anything --

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.916 A:middle
languages, flowers, leaves,

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.306 A:middle
almost anything.

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:25.255 A:middle
So the interaction within the

00:34:25.255 --> 00:34:26.516 A:middle
app is super direct.

00:34:26.676 --> 00:34:28.226 A:middle
People expect cards to have

00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:29.916 A:middle
dimension, so that periodic

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
pulse is inviting you to

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:32.866 A:middle
interact with the card.

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.156 A:middle
You flip the card over by

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:35.735 A:middle
tapping it.

00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:37.716 A:middle
So these cards have two sides.

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:40.286 A:middle
They've respected the metaphor

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.005 A:middle
of the card.

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:43.416 A:middle
People appreciate that.

00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:47.525 A:middle
So the entire experience of

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.516 A:middle
Tinycards is based on quickly

00:34:49.516 --> 00:34:51.076 A:middle
flicking through these cards as

00:34:51.076 --> 00:34:52.386 A:middle
you commit things to memory.

00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:54.775 A:middle
Like for instance the flags of

00:34:54.775 --> 00:34:55.906 A:middle
Canadian provinces.

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:56.926 A:middle
Does anyone know this one?

00:35:00.116 --> 00:35:01.886 A:middle
Ontario. Let's try it.

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:05.236 A:middle
Oh my gosh.

00:35:06.196 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
You've done that quiz before,

00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:08.566 A:middle
right?

00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:12.086 A:middle
So the UI of Tinycards is so

00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.876 A:middle
clear you don't even think about

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:14.016 A:middle
it.

00:35:14.186 --> 00:35:15.666 A:middle
Working with cards feels

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.056 A:middle
completely natural and you can

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:18.386 A:middle
just focus on your goal, which

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:19.266 A:middle
is learning stuff.

00:35:20.616 --> 00:35:22.466 A:middle
So what Tinycards demonstrates

00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:24.336 A:middle
to me is that if you implement a

00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:26.056 A:middle
metaphor well, people will

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.266 A:middle
instantly become immersed.

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:28.386 A:middle
They'll forget that they're even

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:29.566 A:middle
interacting with a UI.

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:33.026 A:middle
And once they're immersed, you

00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:34.876 A:middle
even have the opportunity to

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:36.926 A:middle
extend the metaphor, to really

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.776 A:middle
surprise and even delight

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:39.246 A:middle
people.

00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:41.686 A:middle
So I want to show you a game.

00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:43.856 A:middle
It's called Gorogoa and it

00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.796 A:middle
extends the metaphor of the card

00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:47.536 A:middle
in a way that I feel like

00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:49.216 A:middle
creates a truly unique

00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:50.076 A:middle
experience.

00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:52.806 A:middle
So Gorogoa is a puzzle game.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:55.616 A:middle
You move cards around a grid and

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:57.516 A:middle
you advance in the game and in

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:58.986 A:middle
the story by getting them into

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
the right positions.

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
the right positions.

00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:01.866 A:middle
But you could see that these

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:03.976 A:middle
cards do things that no actual

00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:05.026 A:middle
cards can do.

00:36:05.386 --> 00:36:07.886 A:middle
They can be torn off and as

00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:09.026 A:middle
you'll see in a moment they can

00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:10.366 A:middle
actually stitch themselves

00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.756 A:middle
together into a scene.

00:36:18.116 --> 00:36:19.246 A:middle
Yeah, this is an incredible

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:19.616 A:middle
game.

00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:22.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:24.176 A:middle
And it's a great example of how

00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:25.596 A:middle
you can extend the metaphor

00:36:25.696 --> 00:36:27.386 A:middle
farther than you might think and

00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:29.206 A:middle
create something truly amazing.

00:36:29.686 --> 00:36:31.566 A:middle
This moment right here where

00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:32.976 A:middle
you've got this card metaphor

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:34.396 A:middle
that suddenly kind of

00:36:34.396 --> 00:36:35.966 A:middle
disappears, that's purely

00:36:35.966 --> 00:36:37.906 A:middle
delightful and it's really I

00:36:37.976 --> 00:36:39.966 A:middle
think a great testament to how

00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.266 A:middle
well he's implemented the

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.286 A:middle
metaphor of cards.

00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:47.476 A:middle
Bending and extending metaphors

00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:49.626 A:middle
doesn't work if the result

00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.666 A:middle
doesn't extend the utility, or

00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:53.556 A:middle
value, or delight of your app.

00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:55.806 A:middle
That's why the home tab on the

00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:57.556 A:middle
tab bar doesn't work, right?

00:36:57.556 --> 00:36:59.506 A:middle
It doesn't extend the utility of

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:01.676 A:middle
the app or create any additional

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:01.676 A:middle
the app or create any additional

00:37:01.676 --> 00:37:02.206 A:middle
value.

00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:05.046 A:middle
So the last app I want to show

00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:08.226 A:middle
you is an example that combines

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.906 A:middle
metaphors from the real and

00:37:09.906 --> 00:37:11.466 A:middle
digital world in a really simple

00:37:11.466 --> 00:37:11.966 A:middle
way.

00:37:11.966 --> 00:37:13.426 A:middle
It's called Rosarium.

00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:14.056 A:middle
Yeah.

00:37:15.516 --> 00:37:19.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:22.486 A:middle
I think the developers are here.

00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:23.746 A:middle
It's a rosary that you wear on

00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:25.526 A:middle
your wrist and I believe that is

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:29.526 A:middle
Latin and the font is really

00:37:29.526 --> 00:37:30.816 A:middle
communicating to me that it's

00:37:30.816 --> 00:37:32.046 A:middle
Latin anyway.

00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:34.236 A:middle
So the beads are represented by

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:34.876 A:middle
circles.

00:37:34.966 --> 00:37:36.416 A:middle
Each time you turn the digital

00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:38.516 A:middle
crown you get a slight haptic

00:37:38.576 --> 00:37:38.836 A:middle
tab.

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:40.676 A:middle
So when I met the developers

00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:42.156 A:middle
they told me that they were

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:44.086 A:middle
inspired by the similarity

00:37:44.086 --> 00:37:46.276 A:middle
between the feel of rotating the

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.276 A:middle
digital crown and the feel of an

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.566 A:middle
actual rosary bead.

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.736 A:middle
So the app has translated this

00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:54.866 A:middle
real world object, just a strand

00:37:54.866 --> 00:37:56.616 A:middle
of beads, into the virtual world

00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:58.866 A:middle
in a way that feels really

00:37:58.866 --> 00:37:59.476 A:middle
natural.

00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:01.966 A:middle
So I'm no suggesting that it's a

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:04.116 A:middle
replacement for rosary beads or

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:05.546 A:middle
any prayer beads because the

00:38:05.546 --> 00:38:07.496 A:middle
physical beads can have deep,

00:38:07.716 --> 00:38:09.056 A:middle
you know, personal meaning.

00:38:09.576 --> 00:38:11.066 A:middle
But I love how they've

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
thoughtfully carried that real

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.786 A:middle
world experience into a digital

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.626 A:middle
form in a way that's so

00:38:16.626 --> 00:38:18.476 A:middle
radically simple and clear.

00:38:19.486 --> 00:38:20.666 A:middle
And I think it really

00:38:21.556 --> 00:38:23.516 A:middle
illustrates each of the points

00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:24.646 A:middle
that I made earlier -- the

00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:26.326 A:middle
simplicity and the understanding

00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:28.946 A:middle
of people, the extreme kind of

00:38:28.946 --> 00:38:31.256 A:middle
focus on a problem and the

00:38:31.256 --> 00:38:32.906 A:middle
direct communication of a

00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:33.626 A:middle
solution.

00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:36.736 A:middle
And this is intent in action.

00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:38.226 A:middle
This is being intentional in

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:38.756 A:middle
design.

00:38:38.756 --> 00:38:41.036 A:middle
It's a matter of turning off the

00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:43.956 A:middle
automatic part of your brain, of

00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:46.176 A:middle
slowing down, and challenging

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:46.956 A:middle
the obvious.

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:51.216 A:middle
It requires a level of intention

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:53.326 A:middle
that will enable your decisions

00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:55.266 A:middle
to become more conscious and for

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.186 A:middle
you to become aware of the

00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.876 A:middle
patterns and the familiar things

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.016 A:middle
that might get in the way and

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.016 A:middle
that might get in the way and

00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:02.996 A:middle
block you and focus on people,

00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:03.566 A:middle
right?

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:04.486 A:middle
The people that you want to

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:06.706 A:middle
serve, the person who inspires

00:39:06.706 --> 00:39:08.446 A:middle
you, the family member who

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.696 A:middle
allows you to be the best

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:12.506 A:middle
version of yourself, the

00:39:12.506 --> 00:39:14.796 A:middle
coworkers with whom you share a

00:39:14.796 --> 00:39:16.686 A:middle
real need for something better,

00:39:16.816 --> 00:39:19.386 A:middle
and you can take that

00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:21.936 A:middle
inspiration and use it to

00:39:21.936 --> 00:39:24.016 A:middle
discover newer and better ways

00:39:24.256 --> 00:39:26.626 A:middle
to connect with people and to

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:28.746 A:middle
create something really great.

00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:33.096 A:middle
So you can check out more about

00:39:33.096 --> 00:39:34.056 A:middle
my session here.

00:39:34.056 --> 00:39:35.116 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
And please, please stick around

00:39:40.036 --> 00:39:43.796 A:middle
for the next talk.

00:39:43.796 --> 00:39:45.736 A:middle
The next talk is designing fluid

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:46.726 A:middle
interfaces.

00:39:47.266 --> 00:39:48.886 A:middle
It's a great talk.
