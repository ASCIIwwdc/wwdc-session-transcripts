[ Applause ]

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:31.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:34.026 A:middle
My name is Keith Rauenbuehler,

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:35.006 A:middle
and I'm from the HomeKit

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:35.796 A:middle
Engineering team.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.906 A:middle
Now, today we're here to talk

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.706 A:middle
about HomeKit with a focus on

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.936 A:middle
three specific areas.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.156 A:middle
First, we'll give an overview of

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:47.086 A:middle
HomeKit and the Home app.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.686 A:middle
Then, we'll outline what it

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:50.286 A:middle
takes to build a HomeKit

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:50.796 A:middle
accessory.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.686 A:middle
And finally, we'll look at some

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.206 A:middle
HomeKit APIs and how to use

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:56.016 A:middle
them.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.146 A:middle
So let's jump right in.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.186 A:middle
So the best way to really

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.186 A:middle
So the best way to really

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.075 A:middle
understand the power of HomeKit

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:05.736 A:middle
is to take a look at the Home

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:06.686 A:middle
app.

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:09.386 A:middle
It's a single app interface to

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.946 A:middle
all of your HomeKit accessories.

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.066 A:middle
Now, there are a ton of

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.436 A:middle
capabilities packed into the

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:16.086 A:middle
Home app, and we'll use this

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.816 A:middle
session today to talk about some

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:18.856 A:middle
of the most important ones.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.666 A:middle
And the Home app currently

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.356 A:middle
exists on iPad, iPhone, and

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:25.936 A:middle
Apple Watch.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.716 A:middle
And the Home app has three basic

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:30.186 A:middle
tabs.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.906 A:middle
There's the Home tab, which is

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.376 A:middle
where you'll find your favorite

00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:35.866 A:middle
HomeKit accessories and your

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:36.436 A:middle
scenes.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:39.516 A:middle
There's the Rooms tab, which is

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.906 A:middle
a great, it's a great tab to dig

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:43.516 A:middle
into a specific room and view

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
all of the accessories

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:45.976 A:middle
associated with that room.

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:49.226 A:middle
And the Automations tab, which

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.556 A:middle
is where you'll be able to set

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:52.456 A:middle
up and manage your smart home

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:53.116 A:middle
automations.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:57.016 A:middle
Now, controlling accessory in

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.136 A:middle
the Home app is simple.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
To toggle the state of it, just

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
To toggle the state of it, just

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:01.866 A:middle
tap on the tile.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.106 A:middle
So if you want to turn on a

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:06.286 A:middle
light, all you need to do is tap

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:07.726 A:middle
on the tile for it.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.016 A:middle
Now, if you want finer-grain

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.096 A:middle
control, you can use 3D touch to

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
bring up our quick controls.

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:18.716 A:middle
And so if we go back to that

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.686 A:middle
same light and we want to adjust

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.146 A:middle
the overall brightness -- say

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.876 A:middle
it's a dimmer switch -- we can

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.296 A:middle
3D press on the tile, and we can

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.196 A:middle
bring up our quick controls.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:33.806 A:middle
Now, we've also added scenes to

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:35.716 A:middle
the Home app, and scenes are a

00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:37.266 A:middle
great way to allow you control--

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:38.636 A:middle
allow you to control multiple

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:40.876 A:middle
accessories with a single tap.

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:43.406 A:middle
A scene is our simple interface

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.016 A:middle
for tying multiple accessories

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:46.716 A:middle
together, whether it's kicking

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.406 A:middle
off your morning routine or

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:50.536 A:middle
setting up your living room to

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.536 A:middle
the perfect movie-watching

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:51.956 A:middle
environment.

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:53.866 A:middle
Now, throughout the day, your

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:54.826 A:middle
home is always changing.

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:56.666 A:middle
People may come and go.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:59.276 A:middle
Lights might turn on or off.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:00.996 A:middle
Blinds can open and close.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:00.996 A:middle
Blinds can open and close.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.406 A:middle
And scenes allow you to

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:03.966 A:middle
basically specify a desired

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.346 A:middle
state for all these accessories.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:07.126 A:middle
So you can have a good night

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:08.956 A:middle
scene that turns off the lights,

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
closes the blinds, locks the

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.216 A:middle
door, and sets the thermostat.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:15.576 A:middle
Then, when you're ready for bed,

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:17.676 A:middle
you simply tap on the tile for

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.596 A:middle
"Good Night," and HomeKit

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.446 A:middle
prepares your house for the

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:20.726 A:middle
evening.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.476 A:middle
Now, in iOS, we also have quick

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:34.046 A:middle
access to Home shortcuts via

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
Control Center.

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:37.196 A:middle
This is a great way to view and

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.756 A:middle
control your favorite HomeKit

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
accessories, and it even

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.986 A:middle
provides access to your scenes.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.386 A:middle
Now, this is very-- really

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:46.466 A:middle
convenient, but another great

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.416 A:middle
way to control HomeKit

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.976 A:middle
accessories is through Siri.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.066 A:middle
You can tell Siri good morning,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.046 A:middle
and that will kick off your good

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:54.686 A:middle
morning scene.

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
You can also use Siri to control

00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
individual HomeKit accessories.

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:01.346 A:middle
So you can use Siri to turn on

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:03.826 A:middle
your light in the kitchen or to

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:04.966 A:middle
make sure your door is locked.

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:06.946 A:middle
You could even use Siri to bring

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.116 A:middle
up your favorite HomeKit camera

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
stream.

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:13.196 A:middle
Now, up until now, HomeKit has

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.956 A:middle
only existed on iOS, watchOS,

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:17.776 A:middle
and tvOS.

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.086 A:middle
But this year, we're excited to

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:21.386 A:middle
announce that we're bringing the

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
Home app to the Mac.

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:29.176 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.676 --> 00:04:30.766 A:middle
Now, we're really excited about

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:32.396 A:middle
this, as it's a great way to

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:34.096 A:middle
control your home using your

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:36.136 A:middle
computer, all without taking

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:37.126 A:middle
your phone out of your pocket.

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.016 A:middle
It's also a great way to monitor

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:42.306 A:middle
your home because you'll get

00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:44.166 A:middle
your HomeKit notifications right

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:44.656 A:middle
on your Mac.

00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:47.416 A:middle
And we've even built HomeKit

00:04:47.626 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
Siri integration on the Mac as

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.416 A:middle
well, so you can use all of your

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.586 A:middle
favorite Siri triggers to

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:54.586 A:middle
control your accessories

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.596 A:middle
directly from your computer.

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.366 A:middle
Now, one of Apple's newest

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.916 A:middle
products, the HomePod, is my

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:00.926 A:middle
favorite way to control my

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:00.926 A:middle
favorite way to control my

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
HomeKit accessories.

00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:03.576 A:middle
Not only is it a great music

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:06.836 A:middle
speaker, it's also a great way

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:07.676 A:middle
to control your HomeKit

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.566 A:middle
accessories because anyone in

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.236 A:middle
your house can use it using just

00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:11.756 A:middle
their voice.

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:15.276 A:middle
This hands-free Siri interface

00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:17.126 A:middle
allows you to quickly and easily

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:18.206 A:middle
control these accessories in

00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:18.636 A:middle
your home.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:21.226 A:middle
It's really simple to get

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:23.286 A:middle
started, and I love using my

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:24.946 A:middle
HomePod to control the lights in

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:25.486 A:middle
my house.

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:27.996 A:middle
It's especially convenient when

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:29.556 A:middle
I walk into the kitchen with my

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:31.736 A:middle
arms full of stuff, and I can

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:33.096 A:middle
use my voice to tell Siri to

00:05:33.096 --> 00:05:33.806 A:middle
turn on the lights.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
Now, we've also gotten a lot of

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.496 A:middle
feedback from users saying they

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.036 A:middle
love using their HomePod to

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.056 A:middle
trigger their good night scene.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:44.466 A:middle
They simply tell Siri good night

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
as they head off to bed.

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:50.356 A:middle
Now, the HomePod also plays a

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.816 A:middle
much more powerful role in the

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.946 A:middle
home, as it helps control remote

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.686 A:middle
access and automations.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.846 A:middle
Now, remote access is one of my

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.846 A:middle
Now, remote access is one of my

00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.766 A:middle
favorite features in HomeKit, as

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.936 A:middle
it allows you to monitor your

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.286 A:middle
home when you're not there.

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:09.826 A:middle
So you can have peace of mind,

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
and you can check to make sure

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.206 A:middle
your garage door is closed or

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.196 A:middle
make sure your thermostat's

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:16.006 A:middle
turned off when you're not at

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:16.396 A:middle
home.

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:18.586 A:middle
And you can do this all while

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.086 A:middle
being remote.

00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:21.716 A:middle
Now, this feature requires a

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:25.666 A:middle
home hub, but HomePod, Apple TV,

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:27.536 A:middle
and iPad have the home hub

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:32.236 A:middle
functionality built right in.

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.956 A:middle
So with remote access, you can

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.436 A:middle
keep tabs on your home while

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:35.756 A:middle
you're away.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:38.136 A:middle
And you may also want to share

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.856 A:middle
some of this support from this

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.486 A:middle
control with other users.

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:43.876 A:middle
With HomeKit, you have control

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.316 A:middle
over granting remote access to

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:47.276 A:middle
some users and then specifying

00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:48.536 A:middle
other users to only control

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.646 A:middle
accessories while locally.

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:53.186 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
how remote access works.

00:06:55.956 --> 00:06:56.936 A:middle
So when you're in your home,

00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.626 A:middle
your Apple device communicates

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
directly with your accessories.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
directly with your accessories.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:04.176 A:middle
But when you leave your home,

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.236 A:middle
you'll need a home hub -- again,

00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:09.556 A:middle
this is a HomePod, an Apple TV,

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.546 A:middle
or an iPad -- and your iPhone

00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:13.606 A:middle
will communicate with your home

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:15.606 A:middle
hub, and your home hub will talk

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:16.616 A:middle
to your accessories directly.

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
You can look at the latest state

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.656 A:middle
of these accessories.

00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
You can view the stream from one

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.116 A:middle
of your cameras.

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:26.416 A:middle
You can even lock your door if

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.456 A:middle
you've forgotten to secure your

00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:28.556 A:middle
house before you left for the

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:29.283 A:middle
day.

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.336 A:middle
Now, we saw earlier how easy it

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:32.926 A:middle
to leverage scenes to get

00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
devices to work together.

00:07:34.506 --> 00:07:35.916 A:middle
Now, scenes are great, but

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.186 A:middle
automations allow you to run

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:38.276 A:middle
scenes automatically.

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:41.166 A:middle
So you can do so without

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
launching the Home app or using

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:46.396 A:middle
your voice.

00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:47.846 A:middle
Automations allow you to control

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:50.446 A:middle
individual accessories or entire

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:51.876 A:middle
scenes based on some key

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.796 A:middle
triggers -- things like someone

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:56.116 A:middle
arriving home or having it run

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:57.336 A:middle
at a specific time of the day.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
You can even use other

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
You can even use other

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:01.096 A:middle
accessories in the house to

00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:02.086 A:middle
trigger automations.

00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:05.216 A:middle
Automations can be as simple as

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:06.866 A:middle
turning on the back porch light

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.476 A:middle
when the back door opens or

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:11.886 A:middle
turning down the air conditioner

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.926 A:middle
when someone leaves.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:16.996 A:middle
Now, we also support more

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.436 A:middle
complex automations so you can

00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:23.506 A:middle
open your garage door, turn on

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:25.456 A:middle
your lights, open your shades,

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.546 A:middle
and set your thermostat to just

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.066 A:middle
the right temperature all as you

00:08:29.066 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
pull into your driveway.

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:31.516 A:middle
Now, this is one of my favorite

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.895 A:middle
automations, as I'm frequently

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:37.606 A:middle
juggling groceries, or kids, or

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:38.846 A:middle
even finishing up a phone call

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:39.796 A:middle
as I get home.

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:41.576 A:middle
This allows me to get in my

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.456 A:middle
house without needing to fumble

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.356 A:middle
with my keys as well.

00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.286 A:middle
Now, one of the key things that

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:50.656 A:middle
HomeKit provides to the customer

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:53.506 A:middle
is an incredibly easy way to add

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.946 A:middle
an accessory to your home and to

00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:55.576 A:middle
your home network.

00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:58.516 A:middle
Other services often require

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:00.606 A:middle
downloading an app, following

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:00.606 A:middle
downloading an app, following

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:03.366 A:middle
custom instructions, and jumping

00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:04.466 A:middle
through a lot of hoops to get an

00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:05.316 A:middle
accessory on your network.

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:08.076 A:middle
Now, if you've ever set up a

00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:10.136 A:middle
non-HomeKit accessory, you know

00:09:10.136 --> 00:09:11.276 A:middle
just how frustrating of an

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:12.896 A:middle
experience this can be.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:15.486 A:middle
With HomeKit, the add accessory

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:16.416 A:middle
flow is really simple.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.146 A:middle
All you do is launch the Home

00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:21.306 A:middle
app and scan the accessory code.

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:24.086 A:middle
HomeKit handles the rest.

00:09:24.706 --> 00:09:25.626 A:middle
It's really that easy.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:29.186 A:middle
And accessories can also use NFC

00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:31.326 A:middle
to make this setup even easier.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:33.576 A:middle
So you can launch the Home app,

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.306 A:middle
tap on the accessory with your

00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:36.816 A:middle
phone, and you're done.

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.586 A:middle
Now, the great thing about

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:44.166 A:middle
HomeKit is that it's both secure

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:44.636 A:middle
and private.

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:47.956 A:middle
All accessory communication is

00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:50.666 A:middle
encrypted, and we create a new

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:52.096 A:middle
shared secret for each session.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.806 A:middle
The data is also private, so

00:09:56.806 --> 00:09:58.246 A:middle
Apple doesn't have access to

00:09:58.246 --> 00:09:59.566 A:middle
your camera streams.

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
Apple can't listen in on your

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
Apple can't listen in on your

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:02.056 A:middle
conversations.

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:03.726 A:middle
Apple can't even tell if you

00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:04.796 A:middle
have a light bulb turned on or

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:05.046 A:middle
off.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.216 A:middle
We know your home is private,

00:10:07.216 --> 00:10:08.976 A:middle
and we want to keep it that way.

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:11.316 A:middle
So you can monitor your home,

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:14.376 A:middle
control accessories, execute

00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:16.536 A:middle
scenes, and even use full Siri

00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:17.836 A:middle
support all in a secure and

00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:18.296 A:middle
private way.

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
We want this communication to be

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.726 A:middle
super secure, and so all

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.076 A:middle
messaging is done directly

00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:28.466 A:middle
between the Apple device and the

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:29.066 A:middle
accessory.

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:32.016 A:middle
So your accessory never needs to

00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:35.306 A:middle
talk to the cloud.

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:36.136 A:middle
In addition to this being

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.956 A:middle
secure, it's also really fast

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:40.226 A:middle
because all the messaging is

00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:42.846 A:middle
done locally and there's no need

00:10:42.846 --> 00:10:44.000 A:middle
to round trip to a server.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:51.756 A:middle
Now, our HomeKit Accessory

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:53.636 A:middle
Protocol is the communication

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:55.216 A:middle
channel for secure messaging

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.576 A:middle
between an accessory and your

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.276 A:middle
Apple device.

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.616 A:middle
These messages are encrypted so

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.616 A:middle
These messages are encrypted so

00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:01.996 A:middle
that only the trusted devices

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:02.506 A:middle
can read them.

00:11:03.476 --> 00:11:04.676 A:middle
This means that if someone else,

00:11:04.936 --> 00:11:06.006 A:middle
something does intercept the

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.726 A:middle
message, they can't decrypt it

00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:08.826 A:middle
and understand what it says.

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:11.046 A:middle
And the HomeKit Accessory

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.946 A:middle
Protocol works over Wi-Fi and

00:11:13.946 --> 00:11:14.926 A:middle
Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:11:15.256 --> 00:11:18.056 A:middle
And by IP, we mean Wi-Fi and

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:18.426 A:middle
Ethernet.

00:11:18.746 --> 00:11:20.386 A:middle
And Wi-Fi's great because it

00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:22.106 A:middle
provides reliable, fast,

00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:23.876 A:middle
long-range support, so you can

00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:25.516 A:middle
position Wi-Fi accessories

00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:26.496 A:middle
anywhere in your house.

00:11:27.346 --> 00:11:29.046 A:middle
And we also support Bluetooth

00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:29.626 A:middle
Low Energy.

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:31.706 A:middle
This is also great because --

00:11:32.356 --> 00:11:34.156 A:middle
especially for accessories that

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:35.076 A:middle
are battery operated.

00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:38.056 A:middle
So for things like sensors, you

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:39.516 A:middle
can use Bluetooth Low Energy,

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:41.206 A:middle
and you can position these

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:42.996 A:middle
sensors in convenient locations

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:43.996 A:middle
because they don't require a

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:44.506 A:middle
power cord.

00:11:45.056 --> 00:11:48.936 A:middle
Now, we want everyone to

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:50.556 A:middle
experience home automation, and

00:11:50.556 --> 00:11:51.926 A:middle
so we provide lots of accessory

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:53.576 A:middle
categories, and we have some of

00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:55.726 A:middle
the top manufacturers in each

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:56.196 A:middle
category.

00:11:56.496 --> 00:11:59.076 A:middle
Now, we have an ever-growing

00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:00.786 A:middle
list of categories, and we

00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:00.786 A:middle
list of categories, and we

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.336 A:middle
support multiple manufacturers

00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:03.316 A:middle
in these categories.

00:12:04.046 --> 00:12:05.666 A:middle
So you can find the one that's

00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:06.116 A:middle
right for you.

00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:08.766 A:middle
With HomeKit, you can even

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:10.866 A:middle
combine accessories in the same

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:12.206 A:middle
category from different

00:12:12.206 --> 00:12:13.646 A:middle
manufacturers and have them work

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:14.056 A:middle
together.

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
HomeKit makes it easy for you to

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:17.546 A:middle
choose the accessory that's

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:18.196 A:middle
right for your home.

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:21.786 A:middle
Now, with AirPlay 2, we've added

00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
support for adding speakers to

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:24.186 A:middle
the Home app.

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
And in iOS 12, we're also

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:28.476 A:middle
releasing support for remote

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:29.316 A:middle
control systems.

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:32.016 A:middle
Now you can create a remote

00:12:32.016 --> 00:12:33.846 A:middle
control accessory that's able to

00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
control your Apple TV, including

00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:37.156 A:middle
support for Siri.

00:12:37.766 --> 00:12:41.166 A:middle
Now that we've given a quick

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.166 A:middle
recap of the benefits of using

00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:45.646 A:middle
HomeKit, let's dive in and see

00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:47.266 A:middle
what resources are available for

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.266 A:middle
making a HomeKit accessory.

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:51.716 A:middle
So the easiest way to get

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.046 A:middle
started with HomeKit and

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:54.406 A:middle
building an accessory is to

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.746 A:middle
become an MFI licensee.

00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:58.906 A:middle
It's a great program with lots

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
of valuable tools that I can't

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
of valuable tools that I can't

00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:00.896 A:middle
wait to tell you all about.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:03.386 A:middle
Now, if you just want to learn

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:04.356 A:middle
about the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:06.066 A:middle
Protocol, we also have that

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:07.416 A:middle
available for developers.

00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:09.776 A:middle
Now, this is for noncommercial

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:11.706 A:middle
use to explore and experiment

00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:12.766 A:middle
with the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:13.226 A:middle
Protocol.

00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.056 A:middle
So this is great for learning

00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.286 A:middle
about the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:18.906 A:middle
Protocol, but if you're serious

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:19.756 A:middle
about building a HomeKit

00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:22.026 A:middle
accessory, we really encourage

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:24.106 A:middle
you to join the MFI program

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:25.626 A:middle
because it's the best way to get

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:26.466 A:middle
off to a quick start.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:30.096 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit

00:13:30.096 --> 00:13:32.076 A:middle
about, what are the benefits of

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:36.086 A:middle
being part of the MFI program?

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.846 A:middle
So becoming an MFI is really

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
easy, and you'll get lots of

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:40.266 A:middle
tools and resources.

00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:42.396 A:middle
And one of the newest tools that

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.056 A:middle
we're really excited about is

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.046 A:middle
the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:45.046 --> 00:13:46.916 A:middle
Development Kit.

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.046 A:middle
This is an easy way to get

00:13:48.046 --> 00:13:50.006 A:middle
started on building a HomeKit

00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:50.486 A:middle
accessory.

00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:53.506 A:middle
Now, this Dis a set of code that

00:13:53.506 --> 00:13:55.606 A:middle
runs on the accessory to help

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:56.736 A:middle
abstract away a lot of the

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.076 A:middle
implementation details that you

00:13:58.076 --> 00:13:59.346 A:middle
previously have to worry about.

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
Now, we also have tools to help

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
Now, we also have tools to help

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.316 A:middle
with certification, and we also

00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:05.986 A:middle
provide access to documentation

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:09.176 A:middle
to help you get off the ground.

00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:10.226 A:middle
You'll also get a copy of the

00:14:10.226 --> 00:14:11.506 A:middle
specification that has all the

00:14:11.506 --> 00:14:13.996 A:middle
commercial support, including

00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:15.356 A:middle
how to build authentication

00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:16.326 A:middle
right into your accessory.

00:14:16.966 --> 00:14:21.266 A:middle
Now, the ADK makes it easy than

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:22.156 A:middle
ever to build a HomeKit

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:22.626 A:middle
accessory.

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:24.966 A:middle
Previously, you would need to

00:14:24.966 --> 00:14:26.116 A:middle
worry about building your

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.516 A:middle
accessory logic, adopting the

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:30.786 A:middle
protocol, implementing crypto,

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:32.886 A:middle
adopting WAC, all these other

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:33.366 A:middle
steps.

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.116 A:middle
With the accessory development

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:36.976 A:middle
kit, we've abstracted all this

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:37.486 A:middle
away for you.

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:39.856 A:middle
So we provide the platform logic

00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:42.396 A:middle
for your specific accessory, and

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:43.126 A:middle
the HomeKit Accessory

00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:44.516 A:middle
Development Kit handles a lot of

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:45.216 A:middle
the details.

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.196 A:middle
This means you only need to

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.246 A:middle
worry about that accessory

00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:49.426 A:middle
logic, which is the part that's

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:51.366 A:middle
unique to your accessory and is

00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:52.696 A:middle
the part of the code that you

00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
care about.

00:14:55.516 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:55.516 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:03.496 A:middle
Now, the HomeKit ADK is new, but

00:15:03.776 --> 00:15:04.796 A:middle
we've already gotten a ton of

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
great feedback from our partners

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:07.906 A:middle
on how simple it is to use.

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:10.376 A:middle
MFI licensees are finding it

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:12.256 A:middle
easier than ever to get started,

00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:13.526 A:middle
and we're seeing that the

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.226 A:middle
ramp-up time for new partners is

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:16.246 A:middle
faster than ever before.

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:18.976 A:middle
And of course, the ADK is

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:20.976 A:middle
reliable and secure, as we've

00:15:20.976 --> 00:15:22.336 A:middle
tested it thoroughly internally,

00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:23.536 A:middle
and it's been reviewed by our

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:24.326 A:middle
security folks.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:26.986 A:middle
Now, the really nice thing about

00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:29.066 A:middle
the ADK is that we'll continue

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:29.946 A:middle
to update it throughout the

00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:31.896 A:middle
year, so whenever there's an iOS

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.846 A:middle
update that releases new support

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.456 A:middle
for accessories or to the spec,

00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:37.766 A:middle
we'll also rev the ADK so that

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:38.926 A:middle
it'll stay in sync.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:43.016 A:middle
So how much faster is it to use

00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:43.956 A:middle
the ADK?

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:46.816 A:middle
Well, with the ADK, you can

00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:48.336 A:middle
build a functional prototype and

00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:49.416 A:middle
have it up and running within

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:49.906 A:middle
just a week.

00:15:51.446 --> 00:15:52.336 A:middle
But let's look at how that

00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.776 A:middle
impacts the overall timeline.

00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:58.716 A:middle
So previously, our partners were

00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.306 A:middle
spending about 6 months for

00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.306 A:middle
spending about 6 months for

00:16:00.306 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
development, and then they'd

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.366 A:middle
have to do integration,

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:04.816 A:middle
certification before they could

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:05.566 A:middle
ship their product.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.576 A:middle
We were finding this would often

00:16:07.576 --> 00:16:09.116 A:middle
take about a year to complete.

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:13.446 A:middle
So with the ADK, we're seeing

00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:14.646 A:middle
that timeline get dramatically

00:16:14.646 --> 00:16:15.126 A:middle
decreased.

00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:17.416 A:middle
Based on feedback from our

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:19.886 A:middle
partners, it's now possible to

00:16:19.886 --> 00:16:20.846 A:middle
ship out HomeKit accessory

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:23.176 A:middle
within just 3 months.

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:27.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:28.056 --> 00:16:30.066 A:middle
The ADK makes it easier than

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:31.366 A:middle
ever to build a HomeKit

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:31.796 A:middle
accessory.

00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:33.806 A:middle
To learn more about it, join the

00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:34.566 A:middle
MFI program.

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:36.126 A:middle
You'll have access to all the

00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:37.506 A:middle
ADK information that our

00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:38.686 A:middle
licensees are already using

00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:39.626 A:middle
today to build great

00:16:39.626 --> 00:16:40.246 A:middle
accessories.

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:43.456 A:middle
Now, I mentioned authentication

00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:45.016 A:middle
before, so let's talk a little

00:16:45.016 --> 00:16:46.526 A:middle
bit about that.

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:48.086 A:middle
So this is an important part of

00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
the MFI program.

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:51.576 A:middle
Now, our customers trust when

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:52.756 A:middle
they see that Apple logo.

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.076 A:middle
They trust that they're buying a

00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
high-quality product.

00:16:55.706 --> 00:16:58.036 A:middle
So when they buy an accessory

00:16:58.036 --> 00:16:59.396 A:middle
that works with Apple HomeKit,

00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:02.896 A:middle
they trust that their accessory

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.816 A:middle
has been tested thoroughly and

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.556 A:middle
reviewed by Apple.

00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:08.175 A:middle
Now, this process is similar to

00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:10.455 A:middle
the App Store review process, so

00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:11.316 A:middle
on the HomeKit side, we have a

00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:12.925 A:middle
way of reviewing accessories.

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:15.536 A:middle
This is so they, we ensure that

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:16.705 A:middle
they meet our high bar of

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.476 A:middle
quality and that they're ready

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:20.026 A:middle
to be shipped to customers.

00:17:20.486 --> 00:17:23.386 A:middle
Now, once an accessory is

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:26.626 A:middle
certified, it uses our

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.616 A:middle
authentication stack for

00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:28.046 A:middle
onboarding.

00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:30.976 A:middle
This helps guarantee that a

00:17:30.976 --> 00:17:31.666 A:middle
customer is getting that

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:32.456 A:middle
high-quality product.

00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:34.596 A:middle
Now, the authentication itself

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.216 A:middle
can be done using our hardware

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:38.046 A:middle
chip or via our new

00:17:38.076 --> 00:17:39.216 A:middle
software-based authentication.

00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:43.786 A:middle
Now, as an MFI licensee, you'll

00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:45.136 A:middle
also have access to

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:46.666 A:middle
manufacturing partners that can

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:47.686 A:middle
help get your product to market.

00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:49.766 A:middle
So if you're sitting in the

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:51.316 A:middle
crowd today with a great idea

00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:53.036 A:middle
for a HomeKit accessory, this is

00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:55.376 A:middle
your big opportunity to bring it

00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:57.926 A:middle
to the home.

00:17:57.926 --> 00:17:59.206 A:middle
Now, we've always supported

00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
hardware-based authentication,

00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
hardware-based authentication,

00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:04.726 A:middle
but we have also recently began

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:05.966 A:middle
supporting software-based

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:06.566 A:middle
authentication.

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
Now, customers can be guaranteed

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.406 A:middle
the same level of quality and

00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:14.296 A:middle
trust, and the integration

00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:15.736 A:middle
support can be rolled out via a

00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:16.466 A:middle
firmware update.

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:19.836 A:middle
Now, this is great because this

00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:21.096 A:middle
means you can roll out HomeKit

00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:22.366 A:middle
to accessories that are already

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:23.326 A:middle
shipping to customers.

00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:27.846 A:middle
Now, there are three other great

00:18:27.846 --> 00:18:29.056 A:middle
tools that I want to talk about

00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:29.506 A:middle
this morning.

00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:32.626 A:middle
The first is a resource for

00:18:32.626 --> 00:18:34.506 A:middle
accessory developers, and this

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.146 A:middle
is available for MFI licensees,

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:37.436 A:middle
and this is the HomeKit

00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:38.356 A:middle
Accessory Tester.

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:41.846 A:middle
Now, this is an app that allows

00:18:41.846 --> 00:18:43.396 A:middle
an easy interface for helping

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:44.626 A:middle
you test your accessory.

00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:48.076 A:middle
This is a great way to validate

00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:49.086 A:middle
that your accessory is ready to

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.026 A:middle
be submitted to the review

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
process.

00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:54.316 A:middle
Now, the second tool I want to

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:55.986 A:middle
talk about is the HomeKit

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:57.166 A:middle
Certification Assistant.

00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Now, this resource is also

00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Now, this resource is also

00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.196 A:middle
available to MFI licensees,

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.226 A:middle
which is another great benefit

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.226 A:middle
of being part of the program.

00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:07.576 A:middle
And this is built on top of that

00:19:07.576 --> 00:19:08.716 A:middle
HomeKit Accessory Tester.

00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:10.886 A:middle
Now, this allows you to

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:13.776 A:middle
self-certify your accessory and

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:16.006 A:middle
even has support for automating

00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:17.356 A:middle
some of that testing process.

00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:21.626 A:middle
And the third tool I want to

00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:23.096 A:middle
talk about is the HomeKit

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:24.156 A:middle
Accessory Simulator.

00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:27.026 A:middle
Now, this is a tool that's

00:19:27.026 --> 00:19:29.186 A:middle
created for app developers, and

00:19:29.186 --> 00:19:30.816 A:middle
so it will simulate various

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:31.486 A:middle
accessories.

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.646 A:middle
Now, this allows you to test

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:36.466 A:middle
your app and make sure it plays

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:37.896 A:middle
with all the HomeKit accessory

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
categories.

00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:40.436 A:middle
Now, the really nice thing about

00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:41.636 A:middle
this is it means you don't need

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.866 A:middle
to go out and buy each one of

00:19:42.866 --> 00:19:43.946 A:middle
these accessories to do your

00:19:43.946 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
testing.

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:48.546 A:middle
You can get this tool available

00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:50.256 A:middle
through Xcode and also through

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.126 A:middle
the MFI program.

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:54.126 A:middle
And this is actually one of the

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.786 A:middle
tools that we use internally, as

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:56.986 A:middle
it's a great way to quickly and

00:19:56.986 --> 00:19:59.066 A:middle
easily set up a complex home

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.116 A:middle
with lots of accessories.

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.116 A:middle
with lots of accessories.

00:20:01.386 --> 00:20:02.966 A:middle
Now, of course, you'll also want

00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:04.276 A:middle
a test with real-world

00:20:04.276 --> 00:20:04.996 A:middle
accessories as well.

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:08.746 A:middle
Now, we talked quite a bit about

00:20:08.746 --> 00:20:10.936 A:middle
making a HomeKit accessory, but

00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:13.606 A:middle
what about making a HomeKit app?

00:20:14.586 --> 00:20:17.226 A:middle
So let's switch gears and talk

00:20:17.226 --> 00:20:18.326 A:middle
about what it takes to build a

00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:19.236 A:middle
HomeKit application.

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:23.646 A:middle
So there are lots of apps out

00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:24.566 A:middle
there on the App Store.

00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:27.106 A:middle
How do you make yours stand out?

00:20:28.676 --> 00:20:29.956 A:middle
Well, for HomeKit, it's

00:20:29.956 --> 00:20:31.816 A:middle
important to think about your

00:20:31.816 --> 00:20:32.796 A:middle
target audience.

00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:35.856 A:middle
So that might mean extending

00:20:35.856 --> 00:20:37.296 A:middle
custom functionality, like

00:20:37.296 --> 00:20:38.376 A:middle
tuning or calibrating an

00:20:38.376 --> 00:20:42.086 A:middle
accessory, or maybe it means you

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:42.986 A:middle
live in a region where there's

00:20:42.986 --> 00:20:44.666 A:middle
some functionality that's

00:20:44.666 --> 00:20:46.476 A:middle
specific to your locale that

00:20:46.476 --> 00:20:48.586 A:middle
doesn't already exist in the App

00:20:50.776 --> 00:20:50.926 A:middle
Store.

00:20:50.926 --> 00:20:52.666 A:middle
And if you're an MFI licensee

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:55.016 A:middle
writing an app for your

00:20:55.016 --> 00:20:57.316 A:middle
accessory, you may what to be

00:20:57.316 --> 00:20:59.916 A:middle
able to support custom services

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
and characteristics.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
and characteristics.

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:04.416 A:middle
Now, with HomeKit, there's a lot

00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:05.546 A:middle
of APIs that I'm going to talk

00:21:05.546 --> 00:21:07.736 A:middle
about today, but before I get

00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.416 A:middle
into the details, I think it's

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:10.666 A:middle
important to take a look at a

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:13.246 A:middle
high level at the object

00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:13.786 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:16.896 A:middle
So the first class that I want

00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:18.876 A:middle
to tell you about is this core

00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:20.286 A:middle
object, which is the HMHome.

00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:23.376 A:middle
Now, this is corresponds to the

00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:27.556 A:middle
overall home, and within the

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:28.676 A:middle
HMHome,

00:21:28.736 --> 00:21:30.196 A:middle
you can also optionally have

00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:30.866 A:middle
HMZones.

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:32.786 A:middle
Now, these are things like

00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:34.136 A:middle
upstairs and downstairs.

00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.526 A:middle
Now, you could also have

00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:38.566 A:middle
HMRooms, and these are the rooms

00:21:38.816 --> 00:21:39.726 A:middle
that are normally associated

00:21:39.726 --> 00:21:41.246 A:middle
with the home -- the kitchen,

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.706 A:middle
the living room, the dining

00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
room, the bedroom.

00:21:45.626 --> 00:21:47.656 A:middle
And within those rooms, you can

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:48.626 A:middle
have HMAccessories.

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:50.506 A:middle
And these are the lights, the

00:21:50.506 --> 00:21:52.516 A:middle
fans, the cameras, the locks,

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:54.206 A:middle
all the normal accessories we

00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:54.636 A:middle
support.

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:57.826 A:middle
So your home, the HMHome

00:21:57.826 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
contains HMZones.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
The HMZone contains HMRooms.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
The HMZone contains HMRooms.

00:22:02.506 --> 00:22:04.336 A:middle
And the HMRoom contains

00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:05.206 A:middle
HMAccessories.

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:10.516 A:middle
Now, the home has a handful of

00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:12.836 A:middle
properties on it, but the home

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:14.076 A:middle
is really used as the central

00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:15.836 A:middle
organizing object for HomeKit.

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:18.866 A:middle
So the home is how you add

00:22:18.866 --> 00:22:21.296 A:middle
accessories, configure rooms,

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:23.936 A:middle
create scenes, and build

00:22:23.936 --> 00:22:24.706 A:middle
automations.

00:22:26.076 --> 00:22:27.566 A:middle
But some users may have more

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:29.726 A:middle
than one home, and so you'll

00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:32.306 A:middle
need to use the HMHomeManager to

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.646 A:middle
help manage these homes.

00:22:34.546 --> 00:22:36.106 A:middle
So if you want to add a new home

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.936 A:middle
or remove an existing home,

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:39.876 A:middle
that's done through the

00:22:39.876 --> 00:22:41.086 A:middle
HMHomeManager APIs.

00:22:45.376 --> 00:22:46.636 A:middle
Now, the great thing about

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.616 A:middle
HomeKit is you can extend home

00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:50.556 A:middle
control to other users.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.866 A:middle
We also have access control

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:55.336 A:middle
capabilities so you can give a

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:57.066 A:middle
spouse or a roommate full

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.136 A:middle
administrative privileges.

00:22:58.956 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Now, as an administrator, they,

00:22:58.956 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Now, as an administrator, they,

00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:03.666 A:middle
these users can add accessories,

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:04.626 A:middle
edit scenes.

00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:06.696 A:middle
They basically have full control

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:07.546 A:middle
over the home.

00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:10.806 A:middle
But you may only want to give

00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:12.806 A:middle
some users normal access to the

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:14.606 A:middle
home and only allow them to

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.596 A:middle
control accessories and not edit

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:16.906 A:middle
them.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:18.446 A:middle
And those are

00:23:18.446 --> 00:23:19.806 A:middle
non-administrators.

00:23:21.186 --> 00:23:22.216 A:middle
Now, the important take-away

00:23:22.216 --> 00:23:23.136 A:middle
here is that if you're building

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:25.236 A:middle
an app, you want to make sure

00:23:25.236 --> 00:23:27.946 A:middle
that if your HM user is not an

00:23:27.946 --> 00:23:29.846 A:middle
administrator that you disable

00:23:29.846 --> 00:23:31.986 A:middle
some key functionality so that

00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:33.216 A:middle
it doesn't fail when they go try

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:35.866 A:middle
and use it.

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:38.236 A:middle
Again, all this user management

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.586 A:middle
is done through the HMHome

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:42.116 A:middle
object, and you'll quickly see

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.346 A:middle
that this is a common design

00:23:43.346 --> 00:23:45.786 A:middle
pattern we use where the HMHome

00:23:46.146 --> 00:23:47.376 A:middle
exposes a lot of the basic

00:23:47.376 --> 00:23:47.996 A:middle
functionality.

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:51.776 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:52.946 A:middle
sample code and see what this

00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:53.316 A:middle
looks like.

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:58.876 A:middle
So here we have a class where we

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.116 A:middle
will instantiate an

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.116 A:middle
will instantiate an

00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
HMHomeManager.

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:04.696 A:middle
Now, we want to add a home to

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:06.636 A:middle
that home manager, so we'll use

00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:08.736 A:middle
the addHome APIs and specify the

00:24:08.736 --> 00:24:09.596 A:middle
name of the home.

00:24:10.546 --> 00:24:12.296 A:middle
Now, we want to be sure to set

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:13.826 A:middle
ourselves as the delegate, so

00:24:13.826 --> 00:24:14.616 A:middle
we'll get the appropriate

00:24:14.616 --> 00:24:15.696 A:middle
delegate callbacks.

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:18.226 A:middle
And finally, if we want to

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:19.256 A:middle
configure the users for the

00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:22.256 A:middle
home, we'll call manageUsers on

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:22.646 A:middle
HMHome.

00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:29.166 A:middle
Now, I mentioned HMZones

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.506 A:middle
earlier, so let's take a little

00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:31.776 A:middle
peek at that.

00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:32.786 A:middle
So this is a way of grouping

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:35.206 A:middle
multiple rooms together, like

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:39.026 A:middle
upstairs and downstairs, or you

00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:40.426 A:middle
can group all the bedrooms

00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:41.736 A:middle
together in a single zone.

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:44.866 A:middle
So it has some basic properties

00:24:44.866 --> 00:24:47.166 A:middle
on it like name and access to

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:48.936 A:middle
the rooms, but it also has this

00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.316 A:middle
unique identifier property.

00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:52.326 A:middle
And this could often be

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.686 A:middle
overlooked, but this is a way

00:24:53.686 --> 00:24:54.776 A:middle
that you keep track of which

00:24:54.776 --> 00:24:55.836 A:middle
zone you're, you care about.

00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:58.026 A:middle
So when the name changes or the

00:24:58.026 --> 00:24:59.876 A:middle
rooms change, you still have an

00:24:59.876 --> 00:25:03.956 A:middle
access to that specific zone.

00:24:59.876 --> 00:25:03.956 A:middle
access to that specific zone.

00:25:04.156 --> 00:25:06.446 A:middle
Now, on the HMRoom object, we

00:25:06.446 --> 00:25:08.406 A:middle
also support exposing the name

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.946 A:middle
and the list of the accessories,

00:25:10.316 --> 00:25:12.256 A:middle
and it also contains this unique

00:25:12.256 --> 00:25:13.756 A:middle
identifier property so you can

00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:14.756 A:middle
keep track of rooms as well.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.826 A:middle
Again, the rooms and zones are

00:25:19.826 --> 00:25:21.956 A:middle
managed through the HMHome APIs,

00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:24.186 A:middle
so if you want to add or remove

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:26.716 A:middle
a room or if you want to add or

00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.796 A:middle
remove a zone, you do through,

00:25:28.906 --> 00:25:30.936 A:middle
do that through the HMHome APIs.

00:25:31.506 --> 00:25:34.606 A:middle
So if we go back to some sample

00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:37.136 A:middle
code, let's take a look at this

00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:40.446 A:middle
[inaudible] in action.

00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:42.866 A:middle
So here we are adding a room to

00:25:42.866 --> 00:25:44.356 A:middle
the home with our roomName.

00:25:44.906 --> 00:25:47.846 A:middle
And then, we're adding a zone to

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.276 A:middle
the home with a zoneName.

00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:52.696 A:middle
And then, we associate that room

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:54.000 A:middle
to the zone.

00:25:58.226 --> 00:25:59.406 A:middle
Now, the next level of object

00:25:59.406 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
hierarchy that's important is

00:25:59.406 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
hierarchy that's important is

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:02.536 A:middle
the relationship between

00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:04.526 A:middle
accessories, services, and

00:26:04.526 --> 00:26:05.336 A:middle
characteristics.

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.786 A:middle
Now, this can sound confusing,

00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:10.236 A:middle
as accessories contain services

00:26:10.376 --> 00:26:11.496 A:middle
and services contain

00:26:11.496 --> 00:26:12.306 A:middle
characteristics.

00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:14.146 A:middle
So it's best to look at a

00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
real-world example to give you

00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:16.866 A:middle
an idea how, really how this

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:17.406 A:middle
fits together.

00:26:17.966 --> 00:26:20.776 A:middle
So let's say you have a ceiling

00:26:20.776 --> 00:26:21.476 A:middle
fan fixture.

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:26.126 A:middle
Now, this is a single accessory,

00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:31.426 A:middle
and it has a light, and it has a

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:31.956 A:middle
fan.

00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:37.156 A:middle
So this maps to a light service

00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:40.326 A:middle
and a fan service.

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
Now, these services have a set

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
of common characteristics that

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:47.036 A:middle
are shared across all services,

00:26:47.386 --> 00:26:48.656 A:middle
but they also have

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:50.396 A:middle
characteristics that are unique

00:26:50.396 --> 00:26:51.296 A:middle
to their service.

00:26:52.326 --> 00:26:54.196 A:middle
So the light service has

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.016 A:middle
characteristics like power,

00:26:56.416 --> 00:26:58.016 A:middle
brightness, and saturation.

00:26:58.526 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
And the fan service has

00:26:58.526 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
And the fan service has

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:02.296 A:middle
characteristics like power,

00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:04.176 A:middle
rotation speed, and rotation

00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:04.676 A:middle
direction.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.606 A:middle
Now, some of these

00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:08.906 A:middle
characteristics are optional.

00:27:09.736 --> 00:27:11.206 A:middle
As you can imagine, not all

00:27:11.206 --> 00:27:12.836 A:middle
lights support saturation and

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:13.146 A:middle
color.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:17.116 A:middle
But the HomeKit APIs expose

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:19.306 A:middle
these as a way to elevate these

00:27:19.306 --> 00:27:20.446 A:middle
services to your user.

00:27:21.756 --> 00:27:22.746 A:middle
So we look back.

00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:25.936 A:middle
We have the ceiling fan fixture,

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:27.206 A:middle
which is the HMAccessory.

00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:31.166 A:middle
We have the light service and

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.576 A:middle
the fan service, which are the

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.366 A:middle
HMServices.

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:35.896 A:middle
And we have the corresponding

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:37.316 A:middle
characteristics, which are the

00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:38.336 A:middle
HMCharacteristics.

00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:43.086 A:middle
So we look, if you look at the

00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:45.866 A:middle
API for some of this, you could

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:48.326 A:middle
see we have HMAccessory, and

00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:49.506 A:middle
this allows you to learn about

00:27:49.506 --> 00:27:50.206 A:middle
the accessory that you're

00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:50.726 A:middle
controlling.

00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.966 A:middle
So this exposes properties like

00:27:53.966 --> 00:27:57.116 A:middle
the name, the list of services

00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:00.386 A:middle
it supports, and the firmware

00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:00.386 A:middle
it supports, and the firmware

00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:01.096 A:middle
version it's running.

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:04.766 A:middle
Now, this is just a subsample of

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:05.916 A:middle
all the properties on the

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:06.486 A:middle
accessory.

00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:07.586 A:middle
I just wanted to give you an

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.056 A:middle
idea of the sense of what types

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.486 A:middle
of properties are on it.

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:13.946 A:middle
So if we take a look at

00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:16.526 A:middle
HMService, we'll see that it

00:28:16.746 --> 00:28:17.786 A:middle
exposes the list of

00:28:17.836 --> 00:28:20.966 A:middle
characteristics, and there's a

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:23.546 A:middle
setter method for updating the

00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:24.330 A:middle
name.

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:25.856 A:middle
Now, updating the name is

00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:27.016 A:middle
actually pretty important.

00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:30.716 A:middle
So why is it important?

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.346 A:middle
Well, it's important because

00:28:32.346 --> 00:28:33.996 A:middle
this is how Siri and the Home

00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:35.116 A:middle
app will interface with your

00:28:35.116 --> 00:28:35.556 A:middle
accessory.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.786 A:middle
So you'll want to choose a good

00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:39.476 A:middle
default name.

00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:42.846 A:middle
So we, you don't want to use

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:44.696 A:middle
serial numbers, or MAC

00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:47.246 A:middle
addresses, or model numbers in

00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:48.236 A:middle
your service name because

00:28:48.236 --> 00:28:49.696 A:middle
that'll make it challenging for

00:28:49.696 --> 00:28:51.146 A:middle
the user to talk to your

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.076 A:middle
accessory through Siri.

00:28:52.676 --> 00:28:56.206 A:middle
You also don't-- want to avoid

00:28:56.206 --> 00:28:57.736 A:middle
special characters and numbers,

00:28:58.086 --> 00:28:59.826 A:middle
emojis, punctuation, things like

00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:02.186 A:middle
that also because it gets

00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:02.186 A:middle
that also because it gets

00:29:02.186 --> 00:29:03.426 A:middle
confusing to the user on how

00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:05.176 A:middle
they want, when they want to

00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
address their accessory.

00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:12.216 A:middle
Now, we support over 40

00:29:12.216 --> 00:29:13.586 A:middle
predefined service types.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:16.106 A:middle
So things like light bulbs,

00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:17.776 A:middle
thermostats, garage door

00:29:17.776 --> 00:29:19.816 A:middle
openers, outlets, and all kinds

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:20.906 A:middle
of sensors, to name a few.

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.376 A:middle
We also allow the ability to

00:29:23.376 --> 00:29:25.126 A:middle
specify custom service types as

00:29:25.126 --> 00:29:25.356 A:middle
well.

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:29.866 A:middle
Now, when it comes to adding the

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:31.916 A:middle
accessory to the home, you'll

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.206 A:middle
want to go back to the HMHome

00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:34.296 A:middle
helper methods.

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:36.616 A:middle
These APIs are pretty simple to

00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:38.366 A:middle
use, but we'll walk through an

00:29:38.366 --> 00:29:39.666 A:middle
example shortly here anyway.

00:29:40.276 --> 00:29:44.916 A:middle
So the addAccessory API, this

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.646 A:middle
API is what invokes the Home UI

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:48.766 A:middle
view service, which is that

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.836 A:middle
familiar addAccessory flow that

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:52.796 A:middle
I mentioned earlier, which is

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.816 A:middle
how you can do quick QR code

00:29:54.816 --> 00:29:56.676 A:middle
scanning or use NFC to add an

00:29:56.676 --> 00:29:58.156 A:middle
accessory to the home.

00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
Now, I want to call special

00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:03.556 A:middle
attention to the last method

00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:05.366 A:middle
here, which is addAnd

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.606 A:middle
SetupAccessories with payload.

00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:10.546 A:middle
Now, you can use that payload to

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:12.346 A:middle
pass in a HomeKit accessory code

00:30:13.026 --> 00:30:14.736 A:middle
for in-field activation cases.

00:30:15.476 --> 00:30:17.656 A:middle
So this API is especially

00:30:17.656 --> 00:30:18.656 A:middle
valuable for software

00:30:18.656 --> 00:30:19.196 A:middle
authentication.

00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:22.236 A:middle
So this is the case where your

00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:24.566 A:middle
accessory has left the factory

00:30:24.566 --> 00:30:26.526 A:middle
without a HomeKit code on it.

00:30:27.136 --> 00:30:29.196 A:middle
So you've updated the accessory

00:30:30.106 --> 00:30:31.906 A:middle
via firmware update to provide

00:30:31.906 --> 00:30:33.936 A:middle
HomeKit support, and you don't

00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:35.136 A:middle
want the user to have to

00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:37.636 A:middle
memorize the HomeKit code or to

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:38.496 A:middle
write it down.

00:30:38.856 --> 00:30:40.716 A:middle
And so this API allows you to

00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:42.286 A:middle
pass in that HomeKit code so

00:30:42.326 --> 00:30:44.496 A:middle
that this accessory can be

00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:45.856 A:middle
seamlessly added to the home.

00:30:46.436 --> 00:30:50.226 A:middle
Now, this API is available to

00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:51.316 A:middle
MFI licensees.

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:53.846 A:middle
For more information, contact

00:30:53.846 --> 00:30:54.906 A:middle
your MFI representative.

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.126 A:middle
So if we look at some sample

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.126 A:middle
So if we look at some sample

00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:01.616 A:middle
code on how we would add an

00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:03.226 A:middle
accessory to the home, you just

00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:05.336 A:middle
need to call addAnd

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.006 A:middle
SetupAccessories on the home

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.936 A:middle
object, and HomeKit takes care

00:31:08.936 --> 00:31:11.326 A:middle
of the rest.

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.866 A:middle
Now, I mentioned scenes earlier,

00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:15.536 A:middle
but it's a pretty powerful

00:31:15.536 --> 00:31:17.126 A:middle
concept, so I want to go a bit

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:17.466 A:middle
deeper.

00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:19.806 A:middle
Now, this is how you can

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:21.136 A:middle
integrate different types of

00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:22.886 A:middle
accessories together to help

00:31:22.886 --> 00:31:24.336 A:middle
provide a cohesive experience.

00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:28.746 A:middle
We have some suggested scenes,

00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:30.906 A:middle
but we also allow full

00:31:30.906 --> 00:31:32.656 A:middle
customization by the user.

00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:37.886 A:middle
Now, one of the great things

00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:39.556 A:middle
about scenes is that Siri

00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:41.156 A:middle
understands what scenes are.

00:31:41.296 --> 00:31:44.026 A:middle
And so speaking the name to Siri

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:46.076 A:middle
execute, speaking the name of a

00:31:46.076 --> 00:31:47.646 A:middle
scene to Siri will execute the

00:31:47.646 --> 00:31:48.356 A:middle
scene directly.

00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:53.266 A:middle
Now, we don't call them scenes

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:53.776 A:middle
in HomeKit.

00:31:54.486 --> 00:31:56.276 A:middle
We call them HMActionSets.

00:31:57.286 --> 00:31:58.316 A:middle
So if you want to create an

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.826 A:middle
HMActionSet -- for example,

00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:02.366 A:middle
arriving home -- you'll need to

00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:02.366 A:middle
arriving home -- you'll need to

00:32:02.366 --> 00:32:04.906 A:middle
create a list of HMActions, and

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:09.216 A:middle
then you'll associate those with

00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:09.906 A:middle
the action set.

00:32:10.446 --> 00:32:13.926 A:middle
So the action set, the

00:32:13.976 --> 00:32:16.206 A:middle
HMActionSet contains all of the

00:32:16.206 --> 00:32:17.446 A:middle
individual HMActions.

00:32:20.996 --> 00:32:23.026 A:middle
Now, we support some predefined

00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:26.956 A:middle
scenes, like wake up, go to

00:32:26.956 --> 00:32:33.126 A:middle
sleep, leave the house, and

00:32:33.396 --> 00:32:34.136 A:middle
return home.

00:32:34.736 --> 00:32:36.776 A:middle
Now, this not only gives the

00:32:36.776 --> 00:32:38.166 A:middle
user some context about what

00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:39.066 A:middle
types of action sets are

00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:41.746 A:middle
possible, but this is also what

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:42.706 A:middle
we've found to be some of the

00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:43.376 A:middle
most useful.

00:32:43.906 --> 00:32:47.016 A:middle
Now, of course, we also support

00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:49.116 A:middle
user-defined action sets, and

00:32:49.116 --> 00:32:50.216 A:middle
these are great for things like

00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:51.216 A:middle
creating your perfect movie

00:32:51.216 --> 00:32:51.756 A:middle
scene lighting.

00:32:55.956 --> 00:32:58.496 A:middle
So again, to add them to the

00:32:58.496 --> 00:32:59.896 A:middle
home, we go back to the HMHome

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.676 A:middle
APIs because this allows you to

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.676 A:middle
APIs because this allows you to

00:33:01.676 --> 00:33:04.376 A:middle
add these action sets, execute

00:33:04.376 --> 00:33:08.076 A:middle
the action sets, and the HMHome

00:33:08.266 --> 00:33:10.136 A:middle
APIs also expose the way of

00:33:11.576 --> 00:33:13.536 A:middle
accessing the built-in action

00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:18.476 A:middle
sets.

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:19.666 A:middle
So if we look at some quick

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:21.506 A:middle
sample code, we'll see that if

00:33:21.506 --> 00:33:23.816 A:middle
we want to create an action set,

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:26.316 A:middle
we call addActionSet withName on

00:33:26.316 --> 00:33:27.916 A:middle
the home, we pass in the name of

00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:30.306 A:middle
the action set, then we'll want

00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:32.106 A:middle
to iterate through our list of

00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:35.076 A:middle
actions and add each one to the

00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:35.706 A:middle
action set.

00:33:37.656 --> 00:33:39.626 A:middle
Then, later, if we want to run

00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:42.216 A:middle
the scene, all you do is call

00:33:42.426 --> 00:33:44.396 A:middle
executeActionSet on the home.

00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:50.266 A:middle
Now, running scenes via the UI

00:33:50.266 --> 00:33:52.786 A:middle
or via Siri is great, but

00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:53.626 A:middle
sometimes you want things to

00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:54.606 A:middle
happen automatically.

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:57.326 A:middle
Now, we have several options for

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:58.936 A:middle
automatically triggering scenes

00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
and automatically controlling

00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
and automatically controlling

00:34:00.256 --> 00:34:00.926 A:middle
accessories.

00:34:01.376 --> 00:34:04.496 A:middle
These can be geofence based, so

00:34:04.496 --> 00:34:06.266 A:middle
you can turn on the lights as

00:34:06.266 --> 00:34:07.306 A:middle
you pull up to your house.

00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:09.966 A:middle
Or they can be time based, so

00:34:09.966 --> 00:34:11.386 A:middle
you can turn up the heat before

00:34:11.386 --> 00:34:13.616 A:middle
you get out of bed.

00:34:13.815 --> 00:34:15.376 A:middle
They can be accessory based, so

00:34:15.376 --> 00:34:16.795 A:middle
you can leverage a motion sensor

00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:17.795 A:middle
to turn on a light.

00:34:18.666 --> 00:34:20.666 A:middle
And they can be presence based,

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:22.226 A:middle
so you could turn off your

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:24.476 A:middle
lights when you leave for the

00:34:24.946 --> 00:34:25.000 A:middle
day.

00:34:30.356 --> 00:34:31.806 A:middle
Now, event triggers themselves

00:34:31.806 --> 00:34:33.286 A:middle
are comprised of action sets,

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:35.906 A:middle
and the APIs on HMEvent or

00:34:35.906 --> 00:34:37.795 A:middle
HMTrigger are mostly around

00:34:37.966 --> 00:34:43.016 A:middle
naming, adding, and enabling.

00:34:43.616 --> 00:34:48.616 A:middle
Now, with automations, you can

00:34:48.616 --> 00:34:51.206 A:middle
set them up to run once ever, or

00:34:51.206 --> 00:34:52.275 A:middle
you can have them be recurring.

00:34:53.716 --> 00:34:55.716 A:middle
So you can them just be, happen

00:34:55.716 --> 00:34:57.626 A:middle
that one time, or you can have

00:34:57.626 --> 00:35:00.256 A:middle
them happen every day, or maybe

00:34:57.626 --> 00:35:00.256 A:middle
them happen every day, or maybe

00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:01.086 A:middle
you want them just to happen

00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:03.246 A:middle
every weekday, or even just

00:35:03.246 --> 00:35:04.036 A:middle
every Friday.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:06.416 A:middle
So with automations, you have a

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:07.766 A:middle
lot of control with the

00:35:07.766 --> 00:35:09.146 A:middle
frequency and how often you want

00:35:09.146 --> 00:35:10.066 A:middle
automations to run.

00:35:12.636 --> 00:35:14.096 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:35:14.096 --> 00:35:16.096 A:middle
creation of an HMTrigger and how

00:35:16.096 --> 00:35:16.816 A:middle
we add it to the home.

00:35:18.006 --> 00:35:19.266 A:middle
So let's say we want to create

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:20.316 A:middle
an automation that will run

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:23.026 A:middle
every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:23.296 --> 00:35:25.616 A:middle
So first, we create our date

00:35:25.616 --> 00:35:26.956 A:middle
components and we set the time

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:27.896 A:middle
to be 7 p.m.

00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:30.706 A:middle
Then, we'll create a calendar

00:35:30.706 --> 00:35:32.376 A:middle
event using that component.

00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:36.096 A:middle
Then, we'll generate a trigger

00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:37.166 A:middle
using that time event.

00:35:37.676 --> 00:35:40.776 A:middle
Now, we need to add that trigger

00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:41.286 A:middle
to the home.

00:35:41.856 --> 00:35:44.476 A:middle
And we need to add the action

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:45.226 A:middle
set to the trigger.

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:48.436 A:middle
So this allows you to run an

00:35:48.436 --> 00:35:50.356 A:middle
automation every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:50.946 --> 00:35:52.176 A:middle
So let's say it's turning on a

00:35:52.176 --> 00:35:55.396 A:middle
light every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:56.856 A:middle
Now, that's great, except for

00:35:56.856 --> 00:35:59.576 A:middle
sometimes, some parts of the

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
year, it's not dark at 7 p.m.,

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
year, it's not dark at 7 p.m.,

00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:02.786 A:middle
or sometimes, parts of the year,

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:04.336 A:middle
it gets dark before 7 p.m.

00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:06.106 A:middle
Sometimes it gets dark after 7

00:36:06.106 --> 00:36:06.456 A:middle
p.m.

00:36:07.126 --> 00:36:08.306 A:middle
So turning on the light at 7

00:36:08.306 --> 00:36:09.696 A:middle
p.m. every night isn't really

00:36:09.696 --> 00:36:12.126 A:middle
what you want.

00:36:12.276 --> 00:36:14.306 A:middle
So we also support what we call

00:36:14.306 --> 00:36:15.636 A:middle
significant time events.

00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:18.546 A:middle
And this is sunrise and sunset.

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:21.536 A:middle
So if we look at that previous

00:36:21.536 --> 00:36:23.556 A:middle
example, we could change that to

00:36:23.666 --> 00:36:26.076 A:middle
say, turn on the light every

00:36:26.076 --> 00:36:28.576 A:middle
night at 7 p.m.

00:36:28.736 --> 00:36:30.536 A:middle
We also support relative time

00:36:30.536 --> 00:36:32.386 A:middle
offsets, so you can have the

00:36:32.386 --> 00:36:34.386 A:middle
light turn on, say, 30 minutes

00:36:34.386 --> 00:36:35.206 A:middle
prior to sunset.

00:36:35.716 --> 00:36:38.846 A:middle
So let's go back to the code we

00:36:38.846 --> 00:36:41.256 A:middle
had before and make some changes

00:36:42.236 --> 00:36:44.676 A:middle
so that we can have it run every

00:36:44.676 --> 00:36:45.796 A:middle
night at 30 minutes before

00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:46.226 A:middle
sunset.

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:48.946 A:middle
So the first thing we need to do

00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:51.406 A:middle
is change our date components to

00:36:51.406 --> 00:36:52.506 A:middle
be 30 minutes.

00:36:53.016 --> 00:36:54.056 A:middle
Now, you'll see that it's

00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:55.896 A:middle
negative 30 here because we want

00:36:55.896 --> 00:36:57.296 A:middle
it to run 30 minutes prior to

00:36:57.296 --> 00:36:57.746 A:middle
sunset.

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
Then, we'll create a significant

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
Then, we'll create a significant

00:37:00.766 --> 00:37:03.266 A:middle
time event for sunset and pass

00:37:03.266 --> 00:37:03.926 A:middle
in that offset.

00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:06.836 A:middle
Then, when we generate our

00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:08.766 A:middle
trigger, we pass in the sunset

00:37:08.766 --> 00:37:09.036 A:middle
event.

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.156 A:middle
Then, we execute the code we had

00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
before, which is adding the

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.796 A:middle
trigger to the home and adding

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:17.966 A:middle
the action set to the trigger.

00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:23.906 A:middle
But sometimes you don't want

00:37:23.906 --> 00:37:25.016 A:middle
these automations to run.

00:37:26.226 --> 00:37:27.456 A:middle
You probably don't want the heat

00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:28.596 A:middle
to turn on in the morning if no

00:37:28.596 --> 00:37:29.156 A:middle
one's home.

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:31.706 A:middle
You probably don't want the

00:37:31.706 --> 00:37:32.896 A:middle
light to turn on when the door

00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:37.256 A:middle
opens if it's during the day.

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:39.316 A:middle
So we also support what we call

00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:40.056 A:middle
conditions.

00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:43.646 A:middle
And these can be time based,

00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:46.616 A:middle
they can be presence based, they

00:37:47.236 --> 00:37:50.546 A:middle
can be accessory state based,

00:37:51.116 --> 00:37:54.346 A:middle
and they can be based on

00:37:54.346 --> 00:37:55.366 A:middle
significant events.

00:37:55.736 --> 00:38:00.476 A:middle
Now, I have an automation in my

00:37:55.736 --> 00:38:00.476 A:middle
Now, I have an automation in my

00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:03.506 A:middle
house which turns off the lights

00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:04.636 A:middle
whenever someone leaves.

00:38:05.296 --> 00:38:08.996 A:middle
Now, that's great, except that I

00:38:09.206 --> 00:38:10.656 A:middle
live with my wife, and so

00:38:10.656 --> 00:38:12.006 A:middle
whenever she leaves the house,

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.956 A:middle
all the lights turn off and I'm

00:38:13.956 --> 00:38:16.256 A:middle
left in the dark.

00:38:16.256 --> 00:38:18.156 A:middle
So with presence-based

00:38:18.156 --> 00:38:20.136 A:middle
conditions, you can update this

00:38:20.306 --> 00:38:21.836 A:middle
so that the lights only turn off

00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:23.516 A:middle
when the last person leaves.

00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:27.776 A:middle
Now, to set these conditions, we

00:38:27.776 --> 00:38:28.506 A:middle
use predicates.

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:31.556 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:38:31.556 --> 00:38:32.846 A:middle
sample code.

00:38:34.356 --> 00:38:37.306 A:middle
So here we can see that we're

00:38:37.306 --> 00:38:41.026 A:middle
using our same sunset time

00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:41.876 A:middle
offset from before.

00:38:41.876 --> 00:38:44.256 A:middle
Now, we're going to create a

00:38:44.256 --> 00:38:48.586 A:middle
presence event that's when users

00:38:48.586 --> 00:38:50.816 A:middle
are at home.

00:38:50.816 --> 00:38:52.336 A:middle
We're going to use that presence

00:38:52.336 --> 00:38:54.226 A:middle
event to generate a predicate.

00:38:56.116 --> 00:38:57.656 A:middle
And we'll pass that predicate

00:38:57.656 --> 00:38:58.796 A:middle
into our trigger generation.

00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:02.256 A:middle
Then, we'll go back to the same

00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:02.256 A:middle
Then, we'll go back to the same

00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.286 A:middle
code we had before where we add

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:06.646 A:middle
the trigger to the home and we

00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:09.326 A:middle
add the action set to the

00:39:12.876 --> 00:39:13.046 A:middle
trigger.

00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:14.656 A:middle
So now, we've gone from having

00:39:14.656 --> 00:39:16.086 A:middle
an automation that runs every

00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:18.916 A:middle
night at 7 p.m. to an automation

00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:22.116 A:middle
that runs every night 30 minutes

00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:25.216 A:middle
before sunset, only if someone's

00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:26.000 A:middle
home.

00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.426 A:middle
Now, we also have support for

00:39:33.426 --> 00:39:34.406 A:middle
HomeKit cameras.

00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:37.416 A:middle
And there are some HomeKit APIs

00:39:38.796 --> 00:39:40.256 A:middle
that allow you to show live

00:39:40.256 --> 00:39:44.446 A:middle
streams, show still images, and

00:39:44.446 --> 00:39:45.866 A:middle
to configure camera settings.

00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:48.896 A:middle
You-- this support also includes

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:51.006 A:middle
the ability to control the

00:39:51.006 --> 00:39:52.286 A:middle
speaker volume and microphone.

00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:56.066 A:middle
So let's take a quick look at

00:39:56.126 --> 00:39:57.516 A:middle
some sample code for that as

00:39:57.916 --> 00:39:58.000 A:middle
well.

00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:03.876 A:middle
So here you could see we have a

00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.796 A:middle
function where we want to start

00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:06.936 A:middle
the camera stream for our

00:40:06.936 --> 00:40:07.326 A:middle
accessory.

00:40:07.326 --> 00:40:11.256 A:middle
Now, we want to be sure to set

00:40:11.256 --> 00:40:13.076 A:middle
ourselves as the delegate so we

00:40:13.076 --> 00:40:14.106 A:middle
can get the proper delegate

00:40:14.106 --> 00:40:14.716 A:middle
callbacks.

00:40:16.896 --> 00:40:18.496 A:middle
Now, we'll use this start stream

00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:21.796 A:middle
API to start the stream, and we

00:40:21.796 --> 00:40:23.376 A:middle
also want to be sure to create a

00:40:23.376 --> 00:40:26.576 A:middle
camera view and to add that view

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:27.826 A:middle
to our view hierarchy.

00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:29.866 A:middle
This is so we can display that

00:40:29.866 --> 00:40:31.466 A:middle
camera stream in our app.

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:36.016 A:middle
Then, later, we'll get the

00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:36.926 A:middle
delegate callback.

00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:38.286 A:middle
Again, this is the

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.036 A:middle
HMCameraStream ControlDelegate.

00:40:41.716 --> 00:40:42.836 A:middle
And we'll receive this

00:40:42.946 --> 00:40:45.046 A:middle
cameraStreamControl

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:46.326 A:middle
DidStartStream delegate

00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:46.756 A:middle
callback.

00:40:48.296 --> 00:40:49.576 A:middle
And all we need to do there is

00:40:49.576 --> 00:40:51.496 A:middle
set the camera source to be the

00:40:51.496 --> 00:40:52.116 A:middle
camera stream.

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:55.286 A:middle
Now, this is the end of the

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.686 A:middle
sample code for today, but

00:40:57.686 --> 00:40:59.096 A:middle
there's plenty of documentation

00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:01.016 A:middle
available for these APIs online.

00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:01.016 A:middle
available for these APIs online.

00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:06.236 A:middle
So we hope that this gives you a

00:41:06.236 --> 00:41:08.426 A:middle
fresh look at learning what, how

00:41:08.426 --> 00:41:09.356 A:middle
HomeKit works.

00:41:09.796 --> 00:41:11.486 A:middle
We encourage you to join the MFI

00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:13.626 A:middle
program to take advantage of all

00:41:13.626 --> 00:41:14.686 A:middle
these great resources and

00:41:14.686 --> 00:41:15.606 A:middle
powerful tools.

00:41:16.646 --> 00:41:18.226 A:middle
It's amazingly easy to become an

00:41:18.286 --> 00:41:19.276 A:middle
MFI licensee.

00:41:20.206 --> 00:41:21.286 A:middle
Come visit us in the lab to

00:41:21.286 --> 00:41:23.186 A:middle
learn more about it.

00:41:23.506 --> 00:41:24.636 A:middle
If you're already an MFI

00:41:24.686 --> 00:41:26.796 A:middle
licensee, contact your MFI

00:41:26.866 --> 00:41:29.176 A:middle
representative to get access to

00:41:29.176 --> 00:41:30.036 A:middle
the latest tools.

00:41:33.756 --> 00:41:35.726 A:middle
With the new ADK, we've made it

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:37.486 A:middle
easier than ever to bring a

00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:38.746 A:middle
HomeKit accessory to market.

00:41:39.916 --> 00:41:41.396 A:middle
Whether you're building HomeKit

00:41:42.106 --> 00:41:43.416 A:middle
through, [inaudible] your

00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:44.386 A:middle
accessory through a firmware

00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:46.916 A:middle
update or creating a new HomeKit

00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:48.056 A:middle
accessory for the first time,

00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:50.576 A:middle
use these tools to start

00:41:50.576 --> 00:41:52.046 A:middle
integrating with HomeKit so you

00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:53.476 A:middle
can get native series support

00:41:54.306 --> 00:41:55.306 A:middle
and to integrate with other

00:41:55.306 --> 00:41:56.256 A:middle
HomeKit accessories.

00:41:56.796 --> 00:41:59.886 A:middle
We can't wait to see the great

00:41:59.886 --> 00:42:01.206 A:middle
accessories we know that you'll

00:41:59.886 --> 00:42:01.206 A:middle
accessories we know that you'll

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:03.136 A:middle
come up with.

00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:04.706 A:middle
We also encourage you to use

00:42:04.706 --> 00:42:06.956 A:middle
these APIs to provide a unique

00:42:06.956 --> 00:42:09.216 A:middle
experience for your customers

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:11.556 A:middle
and to take full advantage of

00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:17.366 A:middle
all that HomeKit has to offer.

00:42:17.366 --> 00:42:19.816 A:middle
