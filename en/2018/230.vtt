[ Applause ]

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:27.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:27.916 A:middle
Happy Friday.

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:30.516 A:middle
My name is Skylar Peterson.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:32.526 A:middle
I am an engineer on the iOS

00:00:32.526 --> 00:00:34.646 A:middle
Accessibility team at Apple, and

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.496 A:middle
with me today I have Bhavya, an

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:37.336 A:middle
engineer on the Mac

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.596 A:middle
accessibility team at Apple.

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:40.246 A:middle
And together we're going to

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:42.376 A:middle
delve into what it means to

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.086 A:middle
create an exceptional experience

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.566 A:middle
in your app when it comes to

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.266 A:middle
accessibility.

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:50.076 A:middle
As a quick refresher, we tend to

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:51.286 A:middle
think of accessibility as

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:53.756 A:middle
meaning making technology usable

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:54.476 A:middle
by everyone.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:57.606 A:middle
At Apple, we categorize the way

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.286 A:middle
in which we make that technology

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.216 A:middle
accessible into four areas of


00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.216 A:middle
accessible into four areas of

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:06.616 A:middle
focus, cognitive, motor, vision,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.526 A:middle
and hearing.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.846 A:middle
Now we have a bunch of great

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:12.326 A:middle
features that we work on to

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:14.086 A:middle
address all of these areas, but

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:16.396 A:middle
at the end of the day, it's the

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.536 A:middle
work that you do in tandem with

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.106 A:middle
our assistive technologies that

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.796 A:middle
make our platforms stellar

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:22.826 A:middle
places for people with

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:23.536 A:middle
disabilities.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.866 A:middle
Making sure that all the great

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.376 A:middle
content you work on is

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.476 A:middle
accessible to everyone creates a

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:31.636 A:middle
better, more inclusive community

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
for all of us and fundamentally

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
improves the lives of millions

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.236 A:middle
of people around the world.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:39.746 A:middle
For today's talk, we're going to

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:41.666 A:middle
skip past a lot of the basics of

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.876 A:middle
making apps accessible.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:45.026 A:middle
However, if this is your first

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.966 A:middle
exposure to accessibility or

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.116 A:middle
you've never checked out any of

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:49.866 A:middle
our accessibility APIs before,

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
then I highly recommend that you

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:52.876 A:middle
check out some of the sessions

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:53.806 A:middle
from last year's WWDC.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:56.156 A:middle
There's still a lot that you're

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:57.306 A:middle
going to be able to gain from

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:58.016 A:middle
our session.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.626 A:middle
It may just feel like it's going

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.546 A:middle
a little fast for you because


00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.546 A:middle
a little fast for you because

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:02.816 A:middle
today we're going to focus on

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.456 A:middle
going beyond the basics, and I

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:07.306 A:middle
want to start by focusing in on

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:09.966 A:middle
this one word, usable.

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:13.276 A:middle
Usable is great, making sure

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:14.656 A:middle
that all of the content of your

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.116 A:middle
app is even visible to an

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:17.606 A:middle
assistive technology is a

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.796 A:middle
critical first step.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:21.466 A:middle
But when it comes down to it, we

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.036 A:middle
don't want our apps to just be

00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:24.196 A:middle
usable, right.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:25.786 A:middle
No one's going to be out there

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:27.576 A:middle
bragging that their app is

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:28.356 A:middle
usable.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:31.396 A:middle
They want it to be exceptional.

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:33.696 A:middle
We want people who use them to

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:35.296 A:middle
be delighted when they do.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:37.336 A:middle
It may not be clear to you

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.926 A:middle
exactly what that means when it

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.796 A:middle
comes to accessibility, and

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:41.806 A:middle
that's what we're here to talk

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:43.536 A:middle
about today and hopefully

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.326 A:middle
provide you with some helpful

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:46.836 A:middle
guidance on how to do that.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.286 A:middle
I'd like to focus on two main

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.416 A:middle
areas and the different

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:52.616 A:middle
considerations that you'll want

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:54.666 A:middle
to make for each when evaluating

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.196 A:middle
the accessibility of your own

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:56.406 A:middle
app.

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:59.336 A:middle
First, visual design, and

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
second, the way that an


00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
second, the way that an

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.386 A:middle
assistive technology user

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
experiences your app.

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.486 A:middle
So let's start with visual

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:06.886 A:middle
design.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:12.766 A:middle
I'd like to begin by addressing

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:14.116 A:middle
transparency and blurring.

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:17.166 A:middle
We use blur and transparency

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.126 A:middle
across many parts of iOS.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:21.616 A:middle
It creates a vibrant, unique

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
look and feel for our operating

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:23.456 A:middle
system.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.426 A:middle
But for some people,

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:26.646 A:middle
particularly those with low

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:28.306 A:middle
vision conditions, blur and

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:29.606 A:middle
transparency can have negative

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.856 A:middle
impacts on legibility and even

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.436 A:middle
cause a degree of eye strain.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.476 A:middle
So we provide an accessibility

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:36.786 A:middle
setting to reduce blur and

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.516 A:middle
transparency, and it can have

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
dramatic effects like this.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:42.836 A:middle
Instead of blurring the

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:44.686 A:middle
backdrop, we fade it so that you

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
still have the context of where

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.216 A:middle
you are in the system, but the

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:50.166 A:middle
visual noise is reduced, and the

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.566 A:middle
controls which before had color

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.076 A:middle
bleed-in from behind are more

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:54.536 A:middle
legible on their solid backdrop.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.926 A:middle
Same with folders and finally

00:03:58.926 --> 00:03:59.456 A:middle
spotlight.


00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:02.276 A:middle
Now this is a particularly good

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.936 A:middle
example, because we've taken a

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.746 A:middle
sample of the user's wallpaper

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:06.936 A:middle
so that we can color the

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:08.486 A:middle
backdrop, and they could still

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:10.396 A:middle
feel personalized and contextual

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.176 A:middle
to the device, but we still get

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:13.616 A:middle
that increased contrast and

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.306 A:middle
legibility of having a solid

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:15.756 A:middle
background.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.776 A:middle
As a developer, you can cater

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.065 A:middle
your own use of blurring and

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:21.846 A:middle
transparency by checking whether

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:23.106 A:middle
or not the reduced transparency

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:24.676 A:middle
setting is enabled and adapting

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:25.596 A:middle
your UI accordingly.

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:28.136 A:middle
On iOS, you would use is reduce

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.866 A:middle
transparency enabled on UI

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.576 A:middle
accessibility, and on macOS,

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.326 A:middle
accessibility display should

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:36.116 A:middle
reduce transparency on NS

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
Workspace.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:39.656 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.436 A:middle
contrast.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:43.756 A:middle
Contrast between content and

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:45.486 A:middle
it's background is hugely

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:46.506 A:middle
important when it comes to

00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:47.456 A:middle
perceivability.

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:49.546 A:middle
As colors get closer to one

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:51.106 A:middle
another, they become more

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:52.406 A:middle
difficult to distinguish.

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:54.886 A:middle
As well, certain colors that are

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:56.756 A:middle
legible at bigger sizes don't

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.056 A:middle
work when content is scaled

00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:58.436 A:middle
down.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.296 A:middle
For example, with text, the


00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.296 A:middle
For example, with text, the

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:01.586 A:middle
letters bleed together more

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:03.106 A:middle
easily at smaller sizes.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.026 A:middle
Now you can compute the contrast

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:07.816 A:middle
ratio between a particular color

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:09.436 A:middle
combination to see whether or

00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:10.886 A:middle
not it's going to be legible,

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:12.046 A:middle
and we followed the

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.406 A:middle
recommendations laid out in the

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.796 A:middle
web content accessibility

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:16.506 A:middle
guidelines that states that the

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.296 A:middle
minimum contrast ratio you

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:20.756 A:middle
should aim for is 4.5 to 1.

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
Obviously, the highest contrast

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.766 A:middle
that you're going to be able to

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:26.206 A:middle
get is between black and white,

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:28.876 A:middle
which comes out to be 21 to 1

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.566 A:middle
and obviously works great at all

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:31.356 A:middle
text sizes.

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.176 A:middle
Now let's take a look at a shade

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:33.606 A:middle
of gray.

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
This particular gray will work

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:38.506 A:middle
great for larger text, but it

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:39.966 A:middle
isn't so great for smaller text

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:40.996 A:middle
because your eyes can't

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:41.966 A:middle
distinguish the shapes of the

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:42.676 A:middle
letter forms.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.566 A:middle
It's contrast ratio 4.5 to 1 is

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.246 A:middle
right on the line of passable.

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:49.346 A:middle
Let's like take a look at one

00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
last gray.

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:52.686 A:middle
It may not be apparent on this

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.926 A:middle
really large display, but this

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.926 A:middle
text is really hard to see on a

00:05:57.926 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
small device, even at a large

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
font size.


00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
font size.

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.216 A:middle
It's contrast ratio of 2.9 to 1

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:04.676 A:middle
is just too low.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:09.486 A:middle
And you can use the built-in

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:11.106 A:middle
tool in our accessibility

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:13.926 A:middle
inspector in Xcode to show you

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.916 A:middle
what the contrast ratio between

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:17.896 A:middle
a particular color combination

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:19.856 A:middle
is and what text sizes that

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
color combo passes for.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:22.386 A:middle
And we follow the same

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:23.456 A:middle
guidelines that I mentioned

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:24.386 A:middle
before in this tool.

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:27.016 A:middle
However, even with a ratio that

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:29.736 A:middle
exceeds the recommended contrast

00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
ratio of 4.5 to 1, for people

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.186 A:middle
with low vision conditions,

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:35.906 A:middle
colors that meet the bar can

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
still be problematic when it

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:38.196 A:middle
comes to legibility.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.626 A:middle
So we provide a setting for

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:42.266 A:middle
increasing the contrast across

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
the system.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.016 A:middle
In previous versions of iOS,

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:46.646 A:middle
this setting was referred to as

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:47.616 A:middle
darken colors.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.506 A:middle
So in your code you can use is

00:06:49.506 --> 00:06:51.236 A:middle
darker system colors enabled to

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:51.616 A:middle
check.

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:52.896 A:middle
Though if you're using a

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:54.696 A:middle
standard UIKit control that you

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.516 A:middle
set a tint color on, you will

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:57.786 A:middle
actually get this work for free.

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:00.646 A:middle
On a macOS, you can use


00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:00.646 A:middle
On a macOS, you can use

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.226 A:middle
accessibility display should

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
increase contrast.

00:07:03.726 --> 00:07:06.566 A:middle
Next we have sizing.

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:09.956 A:middle
Changing the content size of

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:11.786 A:middle
your device can have dramatic

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:14.046 A:middle
effects in the way that content

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:15.296 A:middle
is displayed and perceived.

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:17.266 A:middle
And this is hugely beneficial to

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:18.266 A:middle
low vision users.

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.036 A:middle
So let's take for example a

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
calendar.

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:22.916 A:middle
On the left, we have this view

00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:24.756 A:middle
at the default text size, and on

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.036 A:middle
the right I've blown it up

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:27.566 A:middle
several sizes to one of the

00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:29.136 A:middle
larger accessibility sizes.

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:30.896 A:middle
If we simulate what this looks

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:31.866 A:middle
like to someone with a low

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:33.566 A:middle
vision condition, then the

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.176 A:middle
benefits become immediately

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:35.676 A:middle
apparent.

00:07:36.126 --> 00:07:37.326 A:middle
That text on the right is

00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
actually still legible.

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:41.916 A:middle
On iOS, you can check what

00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:43.386 A:middle
content size a user has set

00:07:43.386 --> 00:07:44.856 A:middle
their device to, and there are

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:46.866 A:middle
seven standard sizes with large

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.056 A:middle
being the default, but you can

00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:50.406 A:middle
also enable even larger

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:51.826 A:middle
accessibility sizes, which

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.146 A:middle
increase that by five more.

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:55.866 A:middle
Now there's a lot more that I

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.296 A:middle
could say about dynamic type,

00:07:57.816 --> 00:07:59.246 A:middle
but I'm going to leave it at

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.486 A:middle
that and instead encourage you


00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.486 A:middle
that and instead encourage you

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
to check out some of the

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:03.186 A:middle
fantastic resources that we have

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
to figure out the best way to

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:06.566 A:middle
get dynamic type working in your

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
own apps.

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:11.026 A:middle
Now for some, changing the size

00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:13.296 A:middle
of text is overkill, but the

00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.246 A:middle
default weight of fonts and

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.526 A:middle
glyphs can still make it

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:17.396 A:middle
difficult to read.

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.616 A:middle
So on iOS there's a setting for

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
enabling bold text, which will

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.806 A:middle
also increase the stroke weight

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:23.436 A:middle
of glyphs.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:26.566 A:middle
If you're using stand built-in

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:28.816 A:middle
UI controls and a system font,

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:30.386 A:middle
then it's likely that you don't

00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:31.866 A:middle
need to do anything to get bold

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.166 A:middle
text working in your app, but if

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:35.256 A:middle
you're using your own text

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:37.756 A:middle
solution or a custom font, or

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:38.996 A:middle
you simply want to do something

00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.696 A:middle
like making the dividing lines

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:41.996 A:middle
in your app thicker when bold

00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:43.826 A:middle
text is on, then you can check

00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:44.646 A:middle
whether or not the setting is

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:46.336 A:middle
enabled and adapt as necessary.

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:50.096 A:middle
Next, we have motion.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:53.606 A:middle
Animation is fun, and it often

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:55.096 A:middle
makes content feel more alive.

00:08:55.096 --> 00:08:57.006 A:middle
It can provide a direct

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.976 A:middle
correlation between user

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
interaction and what effects


00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
interaction and what effects

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:02.076 A:middle
their actions are having.

00:09:02.966 --> 00:09:04.316 A:middle
However, certain conditions,

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:05.516 A:middle
particularly inner ear

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.236 A:middle
conditions that affect the

00:09:07.236 --> 00:09:09.116 A:middle
balance center of the brain can

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:10.426 A:middle
make motion and animation

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.786 A:middle
problematic, which often results

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.416 A:middle
in things like dizziness or

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:15.916 A:middle
imbalance or even nausea.

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:18.876 A:middle
Now I'm going to go through some

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.396 A:middle
examples of animation types that

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:22.636 A:middle
can be problematic, so if any of

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:23.556 A:middle
you in the audience have a

00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:25.316 A:middle
problem with motion, then you

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:26.266 A:middle
may want to look away

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.256 A:middle
momentarily as I play the

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.836 A:middle
default animations, which I am

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:29.806 A:middle
going to preface.

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:32.876 A:middle
The first is scaling and

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:33.466 A:middle
zooming.

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:35.656 A:middle
On the left, we have the default

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:36.936 A:middle
animation for opening an app,

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.736 A:middle
specifically the clock app,

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.106 A:middle
which I'm going to show now.

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.156 A:middle
We zoom into the location of the

00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:45.176 A:middle
app's icon while it's UI scales

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:45.756 A:middle
into view.

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:47.286 A:middle
And on the right, we have the

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.856 A:middle
same interaction but with reduce

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.556 A:middle
motion enabled, which will

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.186 A:middle
replace that with a simple cross

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:52.966 A:middle
fade.

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
Next, spinning and vortex

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:56.776 A:middle
effects.

00:09:57.316 --> 00:09:58.826 A:middle
If we take a look at the full

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.726 A:middle
screen echo effect in messages,


00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.726 A:middle
screen echo effect in messages,

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.756 A:middle
which I'm going to show now, we

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:04.336 A:middle
can see that content is spinning

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.006 A:middle
along the Z axis while also

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.816 A:middle
changing in scale, and these

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.096 A:middle
types of motions paired together

00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:10.116 A:middle
can cause issues.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:12.556 A:middle
In the case of message effects,

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:14.006 A:middle
if reduced motion is enabled,

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.476 A:middle
then we provide the user with a

00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:18.086 A:middle
specific prompt to play the

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:19.786 A:middle
message effect instead of having

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:20.506 A:middle
it autoplay.

00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:21.426 A:middle
So they can choose whether or

00:10:21.426 --> 00:10:23.076 A:middle
not they want to see it.

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:25.556 A:middle
Next, we have plane-shifting

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:26.316 A:middle
animations.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.116 A:middle
What I want to show here is the

00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:29.616 A:middle
Safari tabs animation.

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:31.336 A:middle
So I'm going to tap on the show

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:33.346 A:middle
tabs button, and you see that

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:34.786 A:middle
the plane of the web cards is

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:36.726 A:middle
shifted to simulate a 3D space.

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:38.696 A:middle
And on the right, we have the

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:40.486 A:middle
reduced animation, which again

00:10:40.486 --> 00:10:42.536 A:middle
is a simple cross fade, but we

00:10:42.536 --> 00:10:44.996 A:middle
also blink the card so that you

00:10:44.996 --> 00:10:46.666 A:middle
have the context of which one

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:49.536 A:middle
you're coming from that you got

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:53.000 A:middle
in the original animation.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.186 A:middle
Multidirectional or multispeed

00:10:56.246 --> 00:10:57.636 A:middle
motion is another trigger.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.496 A:middle
I'm going to show the movement

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:00.646 A:middle
of the messages bubbles in a


00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:00.646 A:middle
of the messages bubbles in a

00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:01.466 A:middle
conversation.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.286 A:middle
It's a little hard to see in

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:04.416 A:middle
this video, but it's a lot more

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:05.516 A:middle
obvious on device.

00:11:06.196 --> 00:11:08.306 A:middle
As I scroll the messages, they

00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:09.916 A:middle
have a springiness to them where

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:12.196 A:middle
they contract and expand away

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:14.576 A:middle
from one another.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:15.866 A:middle
If we have reduce motion

00:11:15.866 --> 00:11:17.706 A:middle
enabled, then we disable this

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:19.236 A:middle
effect and have them just scroll

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:19.636 A:middle
normally.

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:24.486 A:middle
Finally, we have peripheral

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:25.006 A:middle
movement.

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.536 A:middle
The weather app on iOS has

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:29.106 A:middle
subtle animations that play in

00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:30.756 A:middle
the background to indicate the

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.166 A:middle
current weather condition.

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:33.596 A:middle
You cans see on the left that

00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
the clouds are sort of drifting

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
through the air and the sun is

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.416 A:middle
sort of shimmering and shining.

00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:39.816 A:middle
But if you're scanning the

00:11:39.816 --> 00:11:41.086 A:middle
forecast below, then this

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:43.026 A:middle
animation is in your peripheral

00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:44.526 A:middle
view, and this can be

00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:46.226 A:middle
problematic in the same way that

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:48.176 A:middle
reading while riding in a car

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:49.406 A:middle
can make you feel sick.

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:51.656 A:middle
The horizontal motion above your

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:53.036 A:middle
area of focus triggers a

00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:54.386 A:middle
reaction in your brain.

00:11:55.016 --> 00:11:56.806 A:middle
With reduced motion on, we

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:57.686 A:middle
disable the background

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:58.276 A:middle
animation.

00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:01.326 A:middle
Now typically we don't want to


00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:01.326 A:middle
Now typically we don't want to

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:03.766 A:middle
just remove all animation, so of

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:04.576 A:middle
course we have a setting that

00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:05.816 A:middle
you can check to see if motion

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:07.566 A:middle
should be reduced and adapt

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:08.186 A:middle
accordingly.

00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:10.596 A:middle
On iOS, you check is reduced

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.926 A:middle
motion enabled, and on macOS,

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:14.606 A:middle
check accessibility display

00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:15.606 A:middle
should reduce motion.

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.046 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:19.936 A:middle
simply removing an animation is

00:12:19.936 --> 00:12:21.216 A:middle
often not an adequate

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
experience.

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:23.966 A:middle
You don't want to lessen the

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:24.686 A:middle
experience.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:27.156 A:middle
You just want to add something

00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:28.806 A:middle
else equally fun or engaging but

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:29.876 A:middle
different that works for the

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:30.266 A:middle
user.

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:33.416 A:middle
Finally, I'd like to finish

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.586 A:middle
talking about design by

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
addressing UI complexity.

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:39.236 A:middle
Apps play key roles in our lives

00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:40.696 A:middle
now, and it's critically

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.366 A:middle
important for all of us that our

00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:44.246 A:middle
technology is simple and easy to

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
use, that it enhances our lives

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:47.856 A:middle
instead of adding extra

00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:48.836 A:middle
unnecessary burden.

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:52.336 A:middle
In the United States alone, one

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:53.336 A:middle
in six children have a

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:55.276 A:middle
developmental disability ranging

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:56.306 A:middle
from speech and language

00:12:56.306 --> 00:12:58.016 A:middle
impairments to more serious

00:12:58.016 --> 00:12:59.306 A:middle
developmental disabilities like

00:12:59.306 --> 00:12:59.896 A:middle
autism.


00:13:00.576 --> 00:13:01.696 A:middle
For people with cognitive

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:03.446 A:middle
disabilities or even a chronic

00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:06.156 A:middle
illness, using an app can expend

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:07.716 A:middle
more energy than for someone who

00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:08.526 A:middle
is neurotypical.

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:11.116 A:middle
So how do we make sure that our

00:13:11.116 --> 00:13:12.686 A:middle
apps are simple and the least

00:13:12.686 --> 00:13:13.826 A:middle
burdensome that they can be?

00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:16.596 A:middle
Well they should be easy to

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:17.936 A:middle
navigate by having them

00:13:17.936 --> 00:13:19.696 A:middle
similarly structured and through

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:21.676 A:middle
clear, logical cause and effect.

00:13:23.216 --> 00:13:24.496 A:middle
We should be able to start using

00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:26.136 A:middle
our apps and complete the most

00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:27.496 A:middle
common tasks without

00:13:27.496 --> 00:13:28.946 A:middle
encountering any barriers.

00:13:30.156 --> 00:13:31.506 A:middle
And finally, our apps should

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:33.756 A:middle
behave in a consistent manner so

00:13:33.756 --> 00:13:35.076 A:middle
that when I learn something one

00:13:35.076 --> 00:13:36.976 A:middle
place, it applies to another.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:39.366 A:middle
Using this standard UIKit views

00:13:39.366 --> 00:13:40.906 A:middle
is great because people get

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:43.416 A:middle
familiar with way they work, but

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:45.166 A:middle
UIKit also functions as a design

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:46.256 A:middle
language for iOS.

00:13:46.746 --> 00:13:47.666 A:middle
So if you're doing something

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:49.566 A:middle
custom, consistency with a

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:51.966 A:middle
parallel control in UIKit will

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:53.336 A:middle
help people intuit how to use

00:13:53.336 --> 00:13:55.186 A:middle
your app.

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.496 A:middle
This really all boils down to

00:13:56.496 --> 00:13:57.486 A:middle
the way in which people

00:13:57.486 --> 00:13:59.326 A:middle
experience your apps, which is

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.506 A:middle
just as important for people who


00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.506 A:middle
just as important for people who

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.966 A:middle
use assistive technologies like

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.236 A:middle
VoiceOver or Switch Control.

00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:05.486 A:middle
So I'd like now to spend some

00:14:05.486 --> 00:14:06.616 A:middle
time speaking to how you can

00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.216 A:middle
improve the experience for those

00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:09.426 A:middle
accessibility users.

00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:12.306 A:middle
The experience for assistive

00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:13.796 A:middle
tech like VoiceOver and Switch

00:14:13.796 --> 00:14:15.346 A:middle
Control can be quite different

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:16.476 A:middle
from your typical user

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:17.256 A:middle
experience.

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.326 A:middle
VoiceOver uses many gestures

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:21.256 A:middle
like swipes and multifinger

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:22.556 A:middle
taps,

00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:26.806 A:middle
while Switch Control scans

00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:28.516 A:middle
groups and offers logical quick

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:29.256 A:middle
actions.

00:14:29.726 --> 00:14:31.386 A:middle
For both, there are built-in

00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
equivalents for any standard

00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:35.626 A:middle
gesture or interaction, but what

00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:37.086 A:middle
makes experiencing an app with

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:38.446 A:middle
these technologies exceptional?

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:40.486 A:middle
We want to go from the bare

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:43.576 A:middle
minimum of it works to it works

00:14:43.576 --> 00:14:43.896 A:middle
well.

00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:46.736 A:middle
While despite the fact that

00:14:46.736 --> 00:14:48.486 A:middle
assistive tech users experience

00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:49.996 A:middle
your app in ways that are

00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:51.756 A:middle
different, the same design

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:53.256 A:middle
principles that drive a good

00:14:53.256 --> 00:14:53.976 A:middle
experience for a

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.646 A:middle
nonaccessibility user applies

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:55.906 A:middle
here.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.146 A:middle
You want easy navigation,

00:14:58.526 --> 00:14:59.726 A:middle
predictable behavior,

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:02.386 A:middle
prioritizing our action, and


00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:02.386 A:middle
prioritizing our action, and

00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:02.996 A:middle
consistency.

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:05.606 A:middle
It's also important to note that

00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:06.966 A:middle
if something is communicated

00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:08.416 A:middle
contextually by separate

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.496 A:middle
elements, that same context is

00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:11.636 A:middle
conveyed to our accessibility

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:12.166 A:middle
users.

00:15:13.136 --> 00:15:14.726 A:middle
I'd like now to bring Bhavya up

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:16.646 A:middle
on stage to run through a quick

00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:17.836 A:middle
audit of the accessibility

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.426 A:middle
experience of an app.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:19.706 A:middle
Bhavya.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:24.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:26.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:27.726 A:middle
My name is Bhavya, and I'm a

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.586 A:middle
software engineer on the

00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:29.776 A:middle
Accessibility team at Apple.

00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:31.886 A:middle
Today, I'd like to talk to you

00:15:31.886 --> 00:15:32.806 A:middle
about enhancing the

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.096 A:middle
accessibility experience of your

00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:35.936 A:middle
app by sharing with you an app

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:36.856 A:middle
that Skyler and I have been

00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:37.466 A:middle
working on.

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:39.296 A:middle
The name of this app is

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:41.186 A:middle
Exceptional Dogs, and the goal

00:15:41.366 --> 00:15:42.756 A:middle
is to help make the dog adoption

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:44.896 A:middle
process easier by allowing users

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:46.226 A:middle
to browse a collection of dogs

00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:47.296 A:middle
who are in need of a loving

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:47.626 A:middle
home.

00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.000 A:middle
Let's take a look at this app.

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:57.866 A:middle
This is Exceptional Dogs.

00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.406 A:middle
At the top, I have a carousel


00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.406 A:middle
At the top, I have a carousel

00:16:00.406 --> 00:16:02.216 A:middle
like UI, which is essentially a

00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
collection view of all the

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:04.206 A:middle
different dogs that I can

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:04.506 A:middle
browse.

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:06.946 A:middle
In the bottom left corner, I

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:08.156 A:middle
have a favorite button so that I

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:09.456 A:middle
can favorite particular dogs I

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.246 A:middle
like, and in the bottom right

00:16:11.246 --> 00:16:12.726 A:middle
corner, I have a gallery button,

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.226 A:middle
which brings up a modal view

00:16:14.426 --> 00:16:15.516 A:middle
with additional photos of the

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.000 A:middle
dog.

00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:20.026 A:middle
However, not all dogs have a

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:20.736 A:middle
gallery button.

00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:22.546 A:middle
Notice how this button fades

00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:25.156 A:middle
away as swipe to Layla, who has

00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:26.046 A:middle
no additional pictures.

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:29.026 A:middle
Beneath the carousel I have a

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:30.476 A:middle
stats view with information

00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:31.956 A:middle
about the dog like its name and

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:32.336 A:middle
breed.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:34.236 A:middle
Notice how this information

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:35.836 A:middle
updates as I swipe to the next

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:36.546 A:middle
dog in the carousel.

00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:40.476 A:middle
Finally, at the bottom I have

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:41.806 A:middle
the name of the shelter with two

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:42.946 A:middle
buttons which can open the

00:16:42.946 --> 00:16:44.366 A:middle
location of the shelter in maps

00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
or call the location.

00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:51.266 A:middle
So there's quite a bit going on

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:52.106 A:middle
here in terms of visual

00:16:52.106 --> 00:16:54.676 A:middle
complexity, but Skyler and I

00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:56.236 A:middle
done our due diligence, and

00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:57.556 A:middle
we've sprinkled in a little bit

00:16:57.556 --> 00:16:59.526 A:middle
of accessibility, just enough to

00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:00.586 A:middle
make sure that VoiceOver can


00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:00.586 A:middle
make sure that VoiceOver can

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
reach every element on screen.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.596 A:middle
So let's turn on VoiceOver now

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:06.846 A:middle
and see how a nonsighted or low

00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:09.236 A:middle
vision user would digest all of

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:12.000 A:middle
this complexity.

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:15.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:17.205 A:middle
Exceptional Dogs.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:18.165 A:middle
Pinky.

00:17:19.096 --> 00:17:20.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So VoiceOver lands on the

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.396 A:middle
image and correctly announces

00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:22.116 A:middle
the name of the dog.

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:22.836 A:middle
Great.

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.965 A:middle
I'm going to swipe from left to

00:17:24.965 --> 00:17:26.016 A:middle
right now to scroll through the

00:17:26.016 --> 00:17:26.496 A:middle
carousel.

00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:29.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Layla, Bro, Pudding.

00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:34.156 A:middle
Favorite off button, Pudding,

00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:35.176 A:middle
Bro.

00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:37.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So VoiceOver was able to

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.096 A:middle
correctly scroll through the

00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:40.276 A:middle
carousel, but we weren't able to

00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.656 A:middle
reach the favorite button until

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:42.486 A:middle
we hit the very end of the

00:17:42.486 --> 00:17:43.016 A:middle
carousel.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.176 A:middle
I could, of course, still get to

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:46.416 A:middle
the favorite button by placing

00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.656 A:middle
my finger on it like this.

00:17:48.236 --> 00:17:50.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Favorite off button.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:51.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But it's important to

00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:52.976 A:middle
remember that this is not how a

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:54.006 A:middle
typical VoiceOver user

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:54.606 A:middle
navigates.

00:17:55.206 --> 00:17:57.296 A:middle
Rather, VoiceOver users swipe to

00:17:57.296 --> 00:17:58.936 A:middle
reach to the next element, and

00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
currently, using swiping we


00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
currently, using swiping we

00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:02.006 A:middle
aren't able to reach the

00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:03.376 A:middle
favorite or gallery buttons

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.496 A:middle
until we hit the very end of the

00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:04.976 A:middle
carousel.

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:06.556 A:middle
This isn't a great or

00:18:06.556 --> 00:18:08.066 A:middle
exceptional experience because

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:09.526 A:middle
it really limits my ability to

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:10.896 A:middle
favorite or view the galleries

00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:12.326 A:middle
for virtually all of the dogs in

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
the carousel.

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.366 A:middle
I'll place my finger over the

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:16.936 A:middle
modal view now to activate the

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:17.596 A:middle
gallery button.

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:19.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Show gallery.

00:18:19.406 --> 00:18:20.376 A:middle
Show gallery.

00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:22.006 A:middle
Picture one of Bro.

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:22.816 A:middle
Image.

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:24.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's scroll through our

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:24.826 A:middle
gallery.

00:18:25.196 --> 00:18:26.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Picture two of Bro.

00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:28.356 A:middle
Picture three of Bro.

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:29.576 A:middle
Pinky.

00:18:30.646 --> 00:18:31.126 A:middle
Layla.

00:18:32.556 --> 00:18:34.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, we were successfully able

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:35.096 A:middle
to scroll through the gallery

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:36.916 A:middle
with VoiceOver but focus went

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.366 A:middle
behind the modal view to the

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:39.496 A:middle
content in the background.

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:41.286 A:middle
This experience might seem

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.626 A:middle
workable because it gets the

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:43.786 A:middle
user to the content that they

00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.736 A:middle
need to, but it's not great or

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:47.306 A:middle
exceptional because allowing

00:18:47.306 --> 00:18:48.596 A:middle
focus to go behind the modal

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:50.046 A:middle
view is confusing and

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.096 A:middle
distracting for the user.

00:18:51.846 --> 00:18:53.356 A:middle
I elected the modal view now by

00:18:53.356 --> 00:18:56.326 A:middle
double tapping on the close

00:18:56.676 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
button.

00:18:56.996 --> 00:18:58.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Close, Layla.

00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's swipe through our stats


00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's swipe through our stats

00:19:01.296 --> 00:19:01.446 A:middle
view.

00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:07.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Name, breed, Layla, Labrador.

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:10.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When I hear a name, I expect

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:11.686 A:middle
to hear the actual name of the

00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:13.646 A:middle
dog right after, but instead I

00:19:13.646 --> 00:19:14.166 A:middle
hear breed.

00:19:15.236 --> 00:19:16.716 A:middle
Visually, the layout of all this

00:19:16.716 --> 00:19:19.036 A:middle
information makes sense, but to

00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:21.086 A:middle
VoiceOver, its structure causes

00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.356 A:middle
it to announce information out

00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:22.786 A:middle
of order.

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:24.766 A:middle
This creates a lack of context

00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:25.926 A:middle
for the user and places

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:27.346 A:middle
unnecessary cognitive load on

00:19:27.346 --> 00:19:27.496 A:middle
them.

00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:30.326 A:middle
I'll place my finger over the

00:19:30.326 --> 00:19:31.376 A:middle
name of the shelter now and

00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:32.746 A:middle
swipe to the buttons next to it.

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:35.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Skyler's animal shelter.

00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:37.666 A:middle
Open address in maps.

00:19:38.106 --> 00:19:38.556 A:middle
Button.

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:39.396 A:middle
Call.

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:40.186 A:middle
Button.

00:19:40.836 --> 00:19:42.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Once again, these buttons are

00:19:42.156 --> 00:19:43.396 A:middle
perfectly accessible like the

00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:45.176 A:middle
labels from the stat view, yet

00:19:45.176 --> 00:19:46.256 A:middle
they lack context.

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:48.826 A:middle
When I hear call, it isn't clear

00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:49.946 A:middle
to me what this call action is

00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:51.576 A:middle
referring to even though

00:19:51.576 --> 00:19:53.116 A:middle
visually this is pretty evident

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:54.186 A:middle
since the call button is right

00:19:54.186 --> 00:19:55.306 A:middle
next to the name of the shelter.

00:19:57.266 --> 00:20:00.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver off.


00:19:57.266 --> 00:20:00.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver off.

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:02.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we found a couple of

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:02.576 A:middle
issues here.

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:05.086 A:middle
These issues don't completely

00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:07.086 A:middle
render our app unusable, but

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:08.516 A:middle
they do place unnecessary

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:09.816 A:middle
cognitive load on the user.

00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.226 A:middle
Remember, our goal here is to

00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:13.376 A:middle
create an exceptional

00:20:13.586 --> 00:20:14.796 A:middle
accessibility experience.

00:20:15.576 --> 00:20:16.756 A:middle
I'd like to invite Skyler back

00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:18.306 A:middle
to the stage now to talk about

00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.356 A:middle
how we can elevate our

00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:20.866 A:middle
experience for Exceptional Dogs

00:20:21.196 --> 00:20:22.176 A:middle
to be exceptional.

00:20:23.516 --> 00:20:28.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.736 --> 00:20:30.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we found some issues with

00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:30.486 A:middle
our app.

00:20:31.216 --> 00:20:32.316 A:middle
So let's take a look at some of

00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:33.666 A:middle
our accessibility API that we

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.016 A:middle
can leverage to resolve them.

00:20:36.246 --> 00:20:37.906 A:middle
From Bhavya's audit, we found

00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:39.276 A:middle
some issues with our carousel.

00:20:40.056 --> 00:20:41.196 A:middle
We could get to the favorite and

00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:42.846 A:middle
gallery buttons but only after

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:43.976 A:middle
reaching the end of the list

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:45.096 A:middle
instead of for each individual

00:20:45.096 --> 00:20:45.446 A:middle
dog.

00:20:45.826 --> 00:20:47.386 A:middle
As well, we couldn't get to that

00:20:47.386 --> 00:20:49.196 A:middle
display data below for the dog

00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:50.076 A:middle
until reaching the end of the

00:20:50.076 --> 00:20:50.536 A:middle
list.

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:53.256 A:middle
We need the actions and data for

00:20:53.256 --> 00:20:54.306 A:middle
each dog to be quickly

00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:54.806 A:middle
reachable.

00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:58.246 A:middle
So what we can do is use UI

00:20:58.246 --> 00:21:00.056 A:middle
accessibility element to create


00:20:58.246 --> 00:21:00.056 A:middle
accessibility element to create

00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:01.766 A:middle
a new element in place of the

00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:02.476 A:middle
collection view.

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:04.696 A:middle
UI accessibility element is a

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.406 A:middle
class used to create custom

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:08.356 A:middle
elements oftentimes for

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:09.606 A:middle
representing parts of your UI

00:21:09.606 --> 00:21:10.726 A:middle
that are inaccessible, like

00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:12.036 A:middle
something you've drawn in Core

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:12.986 A:middle
Graphics for instance.

00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
But we can also leverage it to

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:17.436 A:middle
create a custom experience,

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:18.386 A:middle
which is what we're going to do

00:21:18.386 --> 00:21:18.966 A:middle
in this case.

00:21:20.236 --> 00:21:21.576 A:middle
We'll need to return any custom

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.246 A:middle
elements from the accessibility

00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:24.806 A:middle
elements property for the view

00:21:24.806 --> 00:21:25.696 A:middle
that would contain them.

00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:27.216 A:middle
This tells our assistive

00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:30.686 A:middle
technology what the accessible

00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:32.596 A:middle
sub elements of a given view are

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:33.806 A:middle
and the order that they should

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:34.456 A:middle
be navigable.

00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:37.746 A:middle
So if we get our custom element

00:21:37.746 --> 00:21:39.186 A:middle
in place, we can swipe to the

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:40.386 A:middle
content for each dog easily.

00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:40.786 A:middle
Great.

00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:43.606 A:middle
But then how do we change dogs?

00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:46.326 A:middle
Well, we can take advantage of

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:47.596 A:middle
accessibility increment and

00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:48.866 A:middle
accessibility decrement.

00:21:49.276 --> 00:21:50.966 A:middle
By adding the adjustable trait

00:21:50.966 --> 00:21:52.936 A:middle
to our custom element, we'll let

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:54.386 A:middle
the assistive technique know

00:21:54.386 --> 00:21:55.756 A:middle
that our element responds to

00:21:55.756 --> 00:21:57.376 A:middle
these callbacks so that in the

00:21:57.376 --> 00:21:59.286 A:middle
case of VoiceOver when a user

00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
swipes up or down with their


00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
swipes up or down with their

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:02.076 A:middle
finger, then the collection view

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.126 A:middle
will scroll to the next or

00:22:03.126 --> 00:22:05.446 A:middle
previous item.

00:22:06.476 --> 00:22:07.866 A:middle
Now, next let's take a look at

00:22:07.866 --> 00:22:09.066 A:middle
these information labels.

00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:10.716 A:middle
When Bhavya was swiping through

00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:12.196 A:middle
them, they were out of order,

00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:13.506 A:middle
and the value labels lack the

00:22:13.506 --> 00:22:14.976 A:middle
context of what information they

00:22:14.976 --> 00:22:15.606 A:middle
were providing.

00:22:16.716 --> 00:22:18.846 A:middle
Context is hugely important.

00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:20.566 A:middle
If I just touch on the value

00:22:20.566 --> 00:22:21.796 A:middle
label for whether or not the dog

00:22:21.796 --> 00:22:23.536 A:middle
is fostered, all I'm going to

00:22:23.536 --> 00:22:25.216 A:middle
hear from VoiceOver is yes.

00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:27.036 A:middle
Well, yes what?

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:28.486 A:middle
What does that mean?

00:22:28.486 --> 00:22:29.646 A:middle
What does that correspond to?

00:22:30.886 --> 00:22:32.096 A:middle
As well, we have an issue with

00:22:32.096 --> 00:22:32.896 A:middle
navigation.

00:22:33.346 --> 00:22:34.466 A:middle
We're looking at having to swipe

00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:36.396 A:middle
through 14 different labels just

00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:37.646 A:middle
to find what we're looking for.

00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:39.446 A:middle
But combining them would cut

00:22:39.446 --> 00:22:41.096 A:middle
that in half and makes

00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:43.026 A:middle
navigation much, much faster.

00:22:44.476 --> 00:22:45.796 A:middle
It makes more sense to group

00:22:45.796 --> 00:22:46.946 A:middle
these labels together as a

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:48.496 A:middle
single element so that I

00:22:48.496 --> 00:22:49.586 A:middle
understand the relationship

00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:50.716 A:middle
between label and value.

00:22:51.346 --> 00:22:52.406 A:middle
We again can use UI

00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:53.656 A:middle
accessibility element to

00:22:53.656 --> 00:22:55.146 A:middle
accomplish this by creating

00:22:55.146 --> 00:22:56.836 A:middle
elements for each pair of labels

00:22:56.946 --> 00:22:58.026 A:middle
and returning them from the

00:22:58.026 --> 00:22:59.526 A:middle
containing views accessibility

00:22:59.526 --> 00:23:00.346 A:middle
elements property.


00:22:59.526 --> 00:23:00.346 A:middle
elements property.

00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:03.706 A:middle
We also saw that when Bhavya was

00:23:03.706 --> 00:23:04.606 A:middle
swiping through elements in the

00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:06.466 A:middle
app that the shelter info view

00:23:06.466 --> 00:23:08.026 A:middle
was split up into three distinct

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.346 A:middle
elements, the name of the

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.986 A:middle
shelter, the location button,

00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:11.776 A:middle
and a call button.

00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:14.986 A:middle
The buttons have the same issue

00:23:14.986 --> 00:23:16.816 A:middle
of lacking contexts as labels.

00:23:17.186 --> 00:23:18.866 A:middle
If you reach them first without

00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:19.466 A:middle
reaching the name of the

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.146 A:middle
shelter, then it's unclear what

00:23:21.146 --> 00:23:22.066 A:middle
they correspond to.

00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:24.746 A:middle
Having these three elements

00:23:24.746 --> 00:23:26.396 A:middle
exist separately increases the

00:23:26.396 --> 00:23:27.666 A:middle
amount of elements that a user

00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:28.536 A:middle
is going to have to navigate

00:23:28.536 --> 00:23:29.536 A:middle
through to find the content

00:23:29.536 --> 00:23:30.246 A:middle
they're looking for.

00:23:30.636 --> 00:23:31.736 A:middle
So it makes more sense to

00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:33.556 A:middle
combine them into one and give

00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:34.586 A:middle
us quicker navigation.

00:23:36.216 --> 00:23:37.256 A:middle
As well, we want to think about

00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:38.616 A:middle
what the priority is here.

00:23:39.176 --> 00:23:40.236 A:middle
The most relevant piece of

00:23:40.236 --> 00:23:41.586 A:middle
information is what shelter the

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.546 A:middle
dog is housed in.

00:23:42.826 --> 00:23:44.716 A:middle
So we'll provide that first and

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:46.206 A:middle
add supplementary actions for

00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:47.206 A:middle
locating and calling the

00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:47.656 A:middle
shelter.

00:23:49.086 --> 00:23:50.476 A:middle
To accomplish this, we can use

00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:52.096 A:middle
our accessibility custom actions

00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:52.396 A:middle
API.

00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:55.096 A:middle
This allows us to add actions to

00:23:55.096 --> 00:23:56.276 A:middle
an element that the user can

00:23:56.276 --> 00:23:58.106 A:middle
cycle through until they find

00:23:58.106 --> 00:23:59.206 A:middle
the one they're looking for and

00:23:59.206 --> 00:23:59.826 A:middle
activate it.


00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
You can return an array of

00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:03.886 A:middle
custom actions for a given view,

00:24:04.806 --> 00:24:06.726 A:middle
and then for each action, you

00:24:06.726 --> 00:24:08.356 A:middle
have a name, which is conveyed

00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:09.626 A:middle
to the user as what's going to

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:11.116 A:middle
happen when they activate that

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.666 A:middle
action, and a target selector

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.446 A:middle
relationship, which will execute

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:17.586 A:middle
the action in your code.

00:24:17.806 --> 00:24:19.056 A:middle
So we'll make that whole shelter

00:24:19.056 --> 00:24:20.696 A:middle
view accessible and add custom

00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:21.626 A:middle
actions to it for getting the

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.056 A:middle
location and calling.

00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:25.496 A:middle
Finally, we have the gallery

00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:25.776 A:middle
view.

00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:28.186 A:middle
When Bhavya brought this up, we

00:24:28.186 --> 00:24:29.386 A:middle
could swipe through all of the

00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:31.936 A:middle
elements in the background, and

00:24:31.936 --> 00:24:33.746 A:middle
though this view apps modal,

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:36.326 A:middle
that isn't the case, because

00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:37.966 A:middle
instead of housing this view in

00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:39.336 A:middle
a view controller and presenting

00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:41.466 A:middle
it modally, we instead opted to

00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:43.146 A:middle
just add it on top of a view

00:24:43.146 --> 00:24:43.766 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:46.506 A:middle
And so since the content in the

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:48.106 A:middle
background is still visible,

00:24:48.716 --> 00:24:49.786 A:middle
VoiceOver doesn't know that it

00:24:49.786 --> 00:24:50.516 A:middle
should exclude it.

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:52.736 A:middle
Although everything in the

00:24:52.736 --> 00:24:54.046 A:middle
gallery is accessible to

00:24:54.046 --> 00:24:56.006 A:middle
VoiceOver, it gets confusing to

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:57.996 A:middle
the user whose lost the context

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.136 A:middle
of where they are and what

00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.566 A:middle
effect their actions are having.


00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.566 A:middle
effect their actions are having.

00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:03.536 A:middle
To fix this, we want to override

00:25:03.536 --> 00:25:05.906 A:middle
accessibility view is modal on

00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:07.356 A:middle
the presented view, which will

00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:08.656 A:middle
tell our assistive technology

00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:10.126 A:middle
that only the elements of that

00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:11.256 A:middle
view should be accessible right

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:11.486 A:middle
now.

00:25:12.756 --> 00:25:14.196 A:middle
We'll also want to post a

00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.476 A:middle
notification to let the

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:16.846 A:middle
assistive technology know that

00:25:16.846 --> 00:25:18.006 A:middle
our on-screen elements have

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:19.306 A:middle
changed and that it should

00:25:19.306 --> 00:25:20.446 A:middle
attempt to refocus.

00:25:21.746 --> 00:25:23.006 A:middle
We can use the screen change

00:25:23.006 --> 00:25:24.116 A:middle
notification to do so.

00:25:24.716 --> 00:25:27.296 A:middle
I'm going to turn things back

00:25:27.296 --> 00:25:28.886 A:middle
over to Bhavya now to show you

00:25:28.886 --> 00:25:30.256 A:middle
how to use all the API we just

00:25:30.256 --> 00:25:31.196 A:middle
covered to implement our

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:31.786 A:middle
solutions.

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:32.666 A:middle
Bhavya?

00:25:34.516 --> 00:25:38.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:39.046 --> 00:25:39.476 A:middle
Thanks Skyler.

00:25:39.856 --> 00:25:41.216 A:middle
Let's elevate accessibility

00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:42.756 A:middle
experience of our app from great

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:43.836 A:middle
to exceptional.

00:25:44.256 --> 00:25:45.000 A:middle
I'll jump into Xcode.

00:25:53.226 --> 00:25:54.346 A:middle
Let's start with enhancing the

00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:55.826 A:middle
experience of the carousel at

00:25:55.826 --> 00:25:56.136 A:middle
the top.

00:25:56.726 --> 00:25:58.376 A:middle
Here, I have a class called Dog

00:25:58.376 --> 00:25:59.906 A:middle
Carousel Container view which

00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
houses our collection view of


00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
houses our collection view of

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
the dogs, our favorite button,

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:04.016 A:middle
and our gallery button.

00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:06.096 A:middle
As Skyler mentioned, we'd like

00:26:06.096 --> 00:26:07.166 A:middle
to implement the increment and

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.616 A:middle
decrement functionality so that

00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:09.996 A:middle
we can swipe up and down to

00:26:09.996 --> 00:26:10.986 A:middle
scroll through our carousel.

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:13.146 A:middle
To do this, we can create a

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:14.946 A:middle
property on this class called

00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:16.416 A:middle
carousel accessibility element,

00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:18.276 A:middle
which will be a custom UI

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.516 A:middle
accessibility element that

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:20.676 A:middle
supports those gestures.

00:26:21.286 --> 00:26:23.496 A:middle
Let's implement carousel

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:24.466 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:30.336 A:middle
This will be a subclass of UI

00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:31.376 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.136 A:middle
It also needs to know about the

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:34.216 A:middle
current dog object it's

00:26:34.216 --> 00:26:35.476 A:middle
representing, so let's create a

00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:36.846 A:middle
property for that.

00:26:38.216 --> 00:26:40.556 A:middle
We'll give it an initializer

00:26:40.556 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
also, and let's give it some

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:45.306 A:middle
basic accessibility like the

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:48.926 A:middle
label and the value.

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.476 A:middle
Our label will be dog picker,

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:52.386 A:middle
and the value will be a

00:26:52.386 --> 00:26:53.476 A:middle
combination of the name of the

00:26:53.476 --> 00:26:55.226 A:middle
dog and it's favorited status.

00:26:55.776 --> 00:26:59.046 A:middle
Okay. Let's get into the

00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
increment and decrement


00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
increment and decrement

00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:00.916 A:middle
functionality.

00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:02.836 A:middle
First, we'd like to override

00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:04.396 A:middle
accessibility traits to return

00:27:04.396 --> 00:27:08.826 A:middle
the adjustable trait.

00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.086 A:middle
Let's first implement

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.096 A:middle
accessibility increment.

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:16.366 A:middle
We want our increment function

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:17.616 A:middle
to scroll the collection view

00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:17.996 A:middle
forward.

00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:19.536 A:middle
So let's create a function that

00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:19.976 A:middle
does exactly that.

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:29.126 A:middle
Here, I have a function called

00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:30.606 A:middle
accessibility scroll collection

00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:30.806 A:middle
view.

00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:32.926 A:middle
It takes in a bullion, which

00:27:32.926 --> 00:27:34.036 A:middle
determines if the collection

00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:35.196 A:middle
view will scroll forwards or

00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:35.746 A:middle
backwards.

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:37.786 A:middle
Let's dive into this function.

00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:39.866 A:middle
I get a reference to my

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:42.256 A:middle
container view, my current dog,

00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:44.086 A:middle
and my list of all the dogs.

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.176 A:middle
If I'm moving forwards, I get

00:27:47.176 --> 00:27:49.116 A:middle
the index of my current dog, and

00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:50.796 A:middle
I validate that it doesn't

00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:53.326 A:middle
exceed out of bounds, and if

00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:54.896 A:middle
doesn't, I'll ask my collection

00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:55.906 A:middle
view to scroll forward by one

00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:56.366 A:middle
index.

00:27:57.286 --> 00:27:58.696 A:middle
I'll do something similar if I'm

00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:01.006 A:middle
going backwards except I'll make


00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:01.006 A:middle
going backwards except I'll make

00:28:01.006 --> 00:28:02.206 A:middle
sure that my index won't become

00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:04.566 A:middle
negative, and then I'll ask my

00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:05.446 A:middle
collection view to scroll

00:28:05.446 --> 00:28:06.706 A:middle
backwards by one index.

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:09.276 A:middle
Let's go ahead and make use of

00:28:09.276 --> 00:28:10.366 A:middle
this function in our increment

00:28:10.366 --> 00:28:11.000 A:middle
function.

00:28:16.196 --> 00:28:17.416 A:middle
I'll pass in true to indicate

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:18.506 A:middle
that I want to scroll forwards.

00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.446 A:middle
And similarly, I can implement

00:28:21.446 --> 00:28:24.406 A:middle
accessibility decrement, the

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:26.786 A:middle
only difference being that I'll

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:28.296 A:middle
pass in false since I want to

00:28:28.296 --> 00:28:28.996 A:middle
scroll backwards.

00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:30.676 A:middle
And that's it for the carousel

00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:31.576 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:33.276 A:middle
Let's scroll back up to our

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:34.000 A:middle
container view.

00:28:38.346 --> 00:28:40.006 A:middle
Here, we need to expose the

00:28:40.006 --> 00:28:41.436 A:middle
carousel accessibility element,

00:28:41.726 --> 00:28:43.156 A:middle
and to do that, we can override

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.000 A:middle
accessibility elements.

00:28:50.216 --> 00:28:52.076 A:middle
Within this function, I'll get a

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:53.286 A:middle
reference to my current dog and

00:28:53.286 --> 00:28:54.876 A:middle
make sure it's valid before I go

00:28:54.876 --> 00:28:55.996 A:middle
ahead and create my elements.

00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:58.576 A:middle
Let's start by instantiating the

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.000 A:middle
carousel accessibility element.


00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:08.056 A:middle
I'll first get a reference to

00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:09.106 A:middle
the carousel accessibility

00:29:09.106 --> 00:29:10.916 A:middle
element if one already exists,

00:29:11.066 --> 00:29:12.326 A:middle
and if it doesn't, I'll

00:29:12.326 --> 00:29:13.376 A:middle
instantiate one here.

00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:16.346 A:middle
I'll set it's accessibility

00:29:16.346 --> 00:29:18.086 A:middle
frame to be the frame of the dog

00:29:18.086 --> 00:29:19.726 A:middle
collection view, and then I'll

00:29:19.726 --> 00:29:20.896 A:middle
store a reference to it here.

00:29:20.896 --> 00:29:23.766 A:middle
And at the end, I'll return this

00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:24.526 A:middle
array of elements.

00:29:25.636 --> 00:29:28.236 A:middle
Before I do that, I want to add

00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:29.916 A:middle
some elements to my array.

00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:36.306 A:middle
I'll check to see if my current

00:29:36.306 --> 00:29:37.706 A:middle
dog has more than one image, and

00:29:37.706 --> 00:29:39.606 A:middle
if so, I want my array to

00:29:39.606 --> 00:29:40.646 A:middle
comprise of the carousel

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:41.956 A:middle
accessibility element, the

00:29:41.956 --> 00:29:43.356 A:middle
favorite button, and the gallery

00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:45.066 A:middle
button, but if the dog doesn't

00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:46.836 A:middle
have more than one image, we

00:29:46.836 --> 00:29:47.926 A:middle
should probably omit the gallery

00:29:47.926 --> 00:29:48.276 A:middle
button.

00:29:48.816 --> 00:29:52.836 A:middle
One thing I need to remember to

00:29:52.836 --> 00:29:54.646 A:middle
do is to update the current dog

00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:55.966 A:middle
property on the carousel

00:29:55.966 --> 00:29:58.016 A:middle
accessibility element if that

00:29:58.256 --> 00:29:59.416 A:middle
corresponding property gets

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:02.316 A:middle
updated on my container view.


00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:02.316 A:middle
updated on my container view.

00:30:05.756 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
We're almost done.

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:09.286 A:middle
Recall that when I swipe to the

00:30:09.286 --> 00:30:11.696 A:middle
carousel, the information, the

00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:13.386 A:middle
content of the stats view is

00:30:13.386 --> 00:30:13.876 A:middle
changing.

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:15.836 A:middle
However, when I'm swiping with

00:30:15.836 --> 00:30:17.676 A:middle
VoiceOver, I need to let the

00:30:17.676 --> 00:30:18.986 A:middle
app, I need to let VoiceOver

00:30:18.986 --> 00:30:19.896 A:middle
know to update it's

00:30:19.896 --> 00:30:20.626 A:middle
understanding of the

00:30:20.626 --> 00:30:21.826 A:middle
accessibility elements on

00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:22.256 A:middle
screen.

00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:24.526 A:middle
To do that, I can post a layout

00:30:24.526 --> 00:30:25.826 A:middle
change notification whenever a

00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:26.586 A:middle
scroll occurs.

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:29.496 A:middle
I'll head over in my view

00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:31.736 A:middle
controller file, and inside my

00:30:31.736 --> 00:30:33.896 A:middle
scroll view did scroll view at

00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:35.606 A:middle
the very end I'll post that

00:30:35.606 --> 00:30:37.066 A:middle
layout change notification like

00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:37.436 A:middle
this.

00:30:37.996 --> 00:30:41.566 A:middle
And that's it for the carousel

00:30:41.566 --> 00:30:42.106 A:middle
container view.

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:45.986 A:middle
A core part of this solution was

00:30:45.986 --> 00:30:47.706 A:middle
using and creating accessibility

00:30:47.706 --> 00:30:49.666 A:middle
elements, and I can use this

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.026 A:middle
same concept to help me solve a

00:30:51.026 --> 00:30:52.846 A:middle
different problem in the stats

00:30:52.846 --> 00:30:53.146 A:middle
view.

00:30:53.796 --> 00:30:55.156 A:middle
Recall that in the stats view

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:56.146 A:middle
all the information was

00:30:56.146 --> 00:30:57.546 A:middle
separated, and it lacked

00:30:57.546 --> 00:30:58.246 A:middle
context.

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.456 A:middle
I can use this same concept to


00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.456 A:middle
I can use this same concept to

00:31:00.456 --> 00:31:02.216 A:middle
help me group the information

00:31:02.476 --> 00:31:03.926 A:middle
for the stats view together and

00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:08.296 A:middle
to add context.

00:31:08.296 --> 00:31:09.686 A:middle
I'll head over to the doc stats

00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:10.866 A:middle
view where all of these stats

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:14.706 A:middle
are laid out.

00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:16.236 A:middle
I'll start by overriding the

00:31:16.236 --> 00:31:17.706 A:middle
accessibility elements to create

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:18.000 A:middle
my elements.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.456 A:middle
I want to cache the elements I

00:31:26.456 --> 00:31:27.756 A:middle
create from this function so

00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:28.896 A:middle
that I don't have to recompute

00:31:28.896 --> 00:31:30.046 A:middle
them every single time I make

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:30.326 A:middle
them.

00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:32.126 A:middle
To do that, I can create a

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.206 A:middle
private property called

00:31:33.206 --> 00:31:34.146 A:middle
underscore accessibility

00:31:34.146 --> 00:31:35.466 A:middle
elements, which will act as that

00:31:35.466 --> 00:31:36.906 A:middle
cache and store these elements.

00:31:37.466 --> 00:31:39.436 A:middle
Let's get into my function.

00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:44.576 A:middle
First, I'll see if my cache is

00:31:44.576 --> 00:31:46.246 A:middle
empty, and if so, I'll go ahead

00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:47.326 A:middle
and populate my elements.

00:31:48.816 --> 00:31:50.156 A:middle
I'll iterate over all my title

00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:52.116 A:middle
labels, and I'll get a reference

00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:54.076 A:middle
to the title label, which would

00:31:54.076 --> 00:31:56.256 A:middle
be something like breed, and

00:31:56.256 --> 00:31:57.696 A:middle
it's corresponding value, which

00:31:57.856 --> 00:31:58.866 A:middle
would be something like

00:31:59.096 --> 00:31:59.566 A:middle
Labrador.


00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:02.716 A:middle
With the references to both the

00:32:02.716 --> 00:32:04.106 A:middle
title and it's corresponding

00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.756 A:middle
value, I can now create an

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
accessibility element, which

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:08.436 A:middle
encompasses the information for

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:09.000 A:middle
both of these together.

00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:22.216 A:middle
I'll start by creating my

00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:24.006 A:middle
accessibility element here, and

00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:25.456 A:middle
I'll set it's label and it's

00:32:25.456 --> 00:32:27.366 A:middle
accessibility frame to be a

00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
combination of the corresponding

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:31.066 A:middle
values of both the title and the

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:32.636 A:middle
value.

00:32:33.476 --> 00:32:34.876 A:middle
I'll add this element to my

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:38.066 A:middle
array of elements, and once I'm

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:40.126 A:middle
done looping over all the title

00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:42.266 A:middle
and value pairs, at the end I'll

00:32:42.266 --> 00:32:43.686 A:middle
set my cache equal to this

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:45.036 A:middle
array, and I'll return these

00:32:45.036 --> 00:32:45.476 A:middle
elements.

00:32:46.056 --> 00:32:48.486 A:middle
One thing we need to remember to

00:32:48.486 --> 00:32:50.356 A:middle
do is to reset our cache every

00:32:50.356 --> 00:32:51.876 A:middle
time the dog object on this gets

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:53.656 A:middle
updated so that we can compute

00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:54.946 A:middle
the new elements for the new

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:55.236 A:middle
dog.

00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:58.596 A:middle
To do that, I can simply set it

00:32:58.596 --> 00:32:59.346 A:middle
to no over here.

00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
And that's it for the dog stats


00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
And that's it for the dog stats

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:04.056 A:middle
view.

00:33:05.336 --> 00:33:06.876 A:middle
Next, let's work on adding some

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:08.426 A:middle
context to the call and open

00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:09.436 A:middle
location buttons.

00:33:10.056 --> 00:33:12.546 A:middle
I'll head over to the shelter

00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:14.906 A:middle
info view where I have a

00:33:14.906 --> 00:33:16.016 A:middle
reference to the name of my

00:33:16.016 --> 00:33:18.416 A:middle
shelter, the map button, and the

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:18.916 A:middle
call button.

00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:22.236 A:middle
We'd like the actions of both of

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:24.166 A:middle
these buttons to be custom

00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:25.316 A:middle
actions on their containing

00:33:25.316 --> 00:33:27.246 A:middle
view, and to achieve this, we

00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:28.486 A:middle
can start by exposing that

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.246 A:middle
containing view as an

00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:30.216 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:35.566 A:middle
Let's go ahead and give this a

00:33:35.566 --> 00:33:36.756 A:middle
descriptive label, which would

00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:38.000 A:middle
be the name of the shelter.

00:33:42.686 --> 00:33:43.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Finally, let's override

00:33:43.876 --> 00:33:45.436 A:middle
accessibility custom actions.

00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:51.296 A:middle
Within this function, we'll

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:53.536 A:middle
create two custom actions, the

00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:55.516 A:middle
map action and the call action.

00:33:56.456 --> 00:33:58.276 A:middle
VoiceOver will describe these as

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.936 A:middle
open address in maps and call,


00:34:00.286 --> 00:34:01.176 A:middle
but be sure to correctly

00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:02.066 A:middle
localize these strings.

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:05.856 A:middle
Each of these actions will call

00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:07.416 A:middle
a corresponding function, which

00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:08.426 A:middle
activates that button.

00:34:09.186 --> 00:34:11.076 A:middle
So, for example, map action will

00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:12.906 A:middle
call activate map button, which

00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:15.426 A:middle
activates the map button.

00:34:15.606 --> 00:34:17.266 A:middle
I've conveniently defined this

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:19.065 A:middle
function right here.

00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:22.346 A:middle
Be sure to return to [inaudible]

00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:23.766 A:middle
to indicate that your method was

00:34:23.766 --> 00:34:24.246 A:middle
successful.

00:34:25.275 --> 00:34:26.646 A:middle
And that's it for the shelter

00:34:26.646 --> 00:34:26.846 A:middle
view.

00:34:28.496 --> 00:34:30.176 A:middle
Last but not least, let's work

00:34:30.176 --> 00:34:31.525 A:middle
on improving the experience of

00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:32.025 A:middle
the modal view.

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:35.326 A:middle
I've defined my modal view in

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:37.446 A:middle
dog modal view, and as Skyler

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:39.065 A:middle
suggested, to help VoiceOver

00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:40.306 A:middle
recognize this as a modal view,

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:42.335 A:middle
I need to override accessibility

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:43.000 A:middle
view as modal.

00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:50.085 A:middle
We're almost done.

00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:51.226 A:middle
One thing to remember is that

00:34:51.226 --> 00:34:52.585 A:middle
when I press the gallery button,

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:54.916 A:middle
we need to let the app know that

00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:56.166 A:middle
the layout of the content on the

00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:58.016 A:middle
screen has changed so VoiceOver

00:34:58.016 --> 00:34:59.646 A:middle
can focus to the right content.


00:35:00.426 --> 00:35:01.696 A:middle
To do that, I can post a screen

00:35:01.696 --> 00:35:03.836 A:middle
change notification whenever the

00:35:03.836 --> 00:35:04.976 A:middle
gallery button gets pressed.

00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:07.556 A:middle
I'll head over to my view

00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:11.426 A:middle
controller file, and within my

00:35:11.426 --> 00:35:12.916 A:middle
gallery button press function,

00:35:14.116 --> 00:35:15.576 A:middle
once I animate in the modal

00:35:15.576 --> 00:35:17.216 A:middle
view, I'll post a screen change

00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:20.606 A:middle
notification like this.

00:35:21.576 --> 00:35:23.326 A:middle
And that's it.

00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:25.636 A:middle
I already have the app prebuilt

00:35:25.636 --> 00:35:26.856 A:middle
with all this new accessibility

00:35:26.856 --> 00:35:28.876 A:middle
work, so let's take a look at

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:29.666 A:middle
what the new and improved

00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:30.466 A:middle
experience is like.

00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:36.556 A:middle
I'm going to turn on VoiceOver.

00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:39.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:40.466 A:middle
Exceptional Dogs.

00:35:40.866 --> 00:35:41.656 A:middle
Dog picker.

00:35:41.966 --> 00:35:42.496 A:middle
Pinky.

00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:43.536 A:middle
Adjustable.

00:35:45.066 --> 00:35:46.796 A:middle
Swipe up or down with one finger

00:35:46.796 --> 00:35:47.986 A:middle
to adjust the value.

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:49.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver tells me I can

00:35:49.666 --> 00:35:51.776 A:middle
swipe up or down on this.

00:35:52.146 --> 00:35:53.336 A:middle
Let's go ahead and do that to

00:35:53.336 --> 00:35:54.366 A:middle
scroll through our carousel.

00:35:55.176 --> 00:35:55.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Layla.

00:35:56.376 --> 00:35:58.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'll scroll down, sorry,

00:35:58.096 --> 00:35:58.616 A:middle
swipe down.

00:35:59.406 --> 00:35:59.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Pinky.


00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:02.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can also swipe from left to

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.516 A:middle
right to get to the favorite and

00:36:03.516 --> 00:36:04.676 A:middle
gallery buttons like this.

00:36:05.186 --> 00:36:07.756 A:middle

00:36:07.756 --> 00:36:09.066 A:middle
gallery, button.

00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:12.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, not only is every dog in

00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:13.356 A:middle
the carousel accessible to me

00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:14.726 A:middle
but so are the favorite and

00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:16.226 A:middle
gallery buttons from every dog

00:36:16.226 --> 00:36:16.856 A:middle
in the carousel.

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.546 A:middle
I can swipe once more from left

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:21.236 A:middle
to right to skip the carousel

00:36:21.236 --> 00:36:22.656 A:middle
and get to the stats view like

00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:23.076 A:middle
this.

00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:25.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Name, Pinky.

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:26.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I don't have to navigate

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:27.716 A:middle
to the whole carousel.

00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:29.376 A:middle
This feels like a much better

00:36:29.376 --> 00:36:30.086 A:middle
experience now.

00:36:31.136 --> 00:36:31.896 A:middle
Let's go ahead and keep

00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:33.036 A:middle
navigating through our stats

00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:34.006 A:middle
view to see what the experience

00:36:34.006 --> 00:36:34.376 A:middle
is like.

00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:35.886 A:middle
I'm going to swipe from left to

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:37.016 A:middle
right to navigate through it.

Age, 7.0 years.

00:36:43.036 --> 00:36:44.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Since this information is

00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.246 A:middle
grouped together now, it

00:36:45.366 --> 00:36:46.486 A:middle
provides me with way more

00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:48.816 A:middle
context and navigation is faster

00:36:48.816 --> 00:36:50.116 A:middle
since I don't have to navigate

00:36:50.116 --> 00:36:50.886 A:middle
through each and every

00:36:50.886 --> 00:36:51.676 A:middle
individual label.

00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:54.466 A:middle
I'll place my finger over the

00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:55.336 A:middle
name of the shelter now.

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:57.826 A:middle

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:03.526 A:middle
there's actions available on

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:04.706 A:middle
this, so let's swipe up to hear

00:37:04.706 --> 00:37:04.906 A:middle
them.

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:10.646 A:middle

00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:12.096 A:middle
me that these actions are in

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.286 A:middle
reference to the name of the

00:37:13.286 --> 00:37:14.516 A:middle
shelter and will be performed on

them.

00:37:15.096 --> 00:37:16.456 A:middle
It gives me way more context.

00:37:17.556 --> 00:37:19.296 A:middle
Finally, I'll activate the modal

the modal view.

This is a much better experience

00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:39.416 A:middle
now.

[ Applause ]

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:52.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well you just elevated the

00:37:52.346 --> 00:37:53.546 A:middle
accessibility experience of our

00:37:53.546 --> 00:37:55.676 A:middle
app from simply working to

00:37:55.676 --> 00:37:56.246 A:middle
exceptional.

00:37:56.976 --> 00:37:58.456 A:middle
We've achieved this by shaping

00:37:58.456 --> 00:37:59.836 A:middle
the experience around the user

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.216 A:middle
and modelling the interaction


00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.216 A:middle
and modelling the interaction

00:38:01.216 --> 00:38:02.896 A:middle
around this experience, and in

00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:04.686 A:middle
doing so, we've lifted a huge

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:06.036 A:middle
cognitive burden off the user.

00:38:06.636 --> 00:38:08.256 A:middle
Your users will love this extra

00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.496 A:middle
bit of effort you put towards

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.226 A:middle
the accessibility of the app so

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:12.196 A:middle
they can love it as much as

00:38:12.196 --> 00:38:12.786 A:middle
anyone else.

00:38:13.306 --> 00:38:14.076 A:middle
I'd like to hand it back to

00:38:14.076 --> 00:38:16.436 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:38:20.376 --> 00:38:21.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Bhavya.

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:23.826 A:middle
Hopefully Bhavya's demo

00:38:23.826 --> 00:38:25.756 A:middle
demonstrated for you how small

00:38:25.756 --> 00:38:27.106 A:middle
tweaks can transform the

00:38:27.106 --> 00:38:28.546 A:middle
accessibility experience for the

00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:28.936 A:middle
better.

00:38:29.786 --> 00:38:30.866 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:32.796 A:middle
creating custom interfaces for

00:38:32.796 --> 00:38:34.176 A:middle
the accessibility of your app is

00:38:34.176 --> 00:38:35.836 A:middle
not always the right answer.

00:38:36.456 --> 00:38:38.266 A:middle
Sometimes the simple fix is the

00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:40.996 A:middle
best fix, but what you really

00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:42.436 A:middle
should be doing when making your

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:44.716 A:middle
apps accessible is thinking

00:38:44.716 --> 00:38:46.376 A:middle
through beyond the surface level

00:38:46.376 --> 00:38:47.856 A:middle
what it will really mean for

00:38:47.856 --> 00:38:49.486 A:middle
someone who's using an assistive

00:38:49.486 --> 00:38:53.036 A:middle
technology to use your app.

00:38:53.276 --> 00:38:54.476 A:middle
To wrap this up, I'd like to

00:38:54.476 --> 00:38:55.556 A:middle
return to where we started

00:38:55.556 --> 00:38:55.916 A:middle
today.

00:38:56.696 --> 00:38:58.676 A:middle
Usable is a great first step for

00:38:58.676 --> 00:39:00.866 A:middle
making apps accessible, but we


00:38:58.676 --> 00:39:00.866 A:middle
making apps accessible, but we

00:39:00.916 --> 00:39:02.106 A:middle
can do better.

00:39:03.326 --> 00:39:05.676 A:middle
We can and we should provide our

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:06.976 A:middle
users with exceptional,

00:39:07.196 --> 00:39:08.706 A:middle
delightful experiences that

00:39:08.706 --> 00:39:09.976 A:middle
cater to their unique needs.

00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:12.926 A:middle
There are a lot of ways to take

00:39:12.926 --> 00:39:14.096 A:middle
an accessible app from being

00:39:14.096 --> 00:39:15.496 A:middle
functional to being exceptional.

00:39:16.836 --> 00:39:18.146 A:middle
Designing for accessibility up

00:39:18.146 --> 00:39:20.066 A:middle
front can get you a lot of wins.

00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:21.946 A:middle
Doing things like making sure

00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:23.096 A:middle
your colors meet minimum

00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:25.446 A:middle
recommended contrast ratios or

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.056 A:middle
that your layout can adequately

00:39:27.056 --> 00:39:29.226 A:middle
adapt to changing size have

00:39:29.226 --> 00:39:30.956 A:middle
benefits for all users.

00:39:31.616 --> 00:39:33.216 A:middle
But you should also extend you

00:39:33.216 --> 00:39:34.906 A:middle
default design to accommodate

00:39:34.906 --> 00:39:36.076 A:middle
the settings that users have

00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:36.496 A:middle
enabled.

00:39:38.066 --> 00:39:39.116 A:middle
Finally, when crafting the

00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:41.126 A:middle
accessibility experience for

00:39:41.126 --> 00:39:43.206 A:middle
assistive technologies, do so

00:39:43.206 --> 00:39:44.046 A:middle
purposefully.

00:39:44.856 --> 00:39:46.126 A:middle
Prioritize your content.

00:39:46.536 --> 00:39:47.966 A:middle
Make it easy and intuitive to

00:39:47.966 --> 00:39:50.046 A:middle
navigate and provide context

00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:50.786 A:middle
when necessary.
