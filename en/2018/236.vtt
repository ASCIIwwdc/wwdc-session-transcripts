00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:19.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Chris

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.976 A:middle
Fleizach and let's talk about

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:22.846 A:middle
making iOS talk using

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:23.856 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesis.

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:26.646 A:middle
So our agenda for today.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.126 A:middle
What and why is

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:29.316 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesis?

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.296 A:middle
Let's talk about some of the

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:31.876 A:middle
basics.

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.416 A:middle
We'll talk about choosing the

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.566 A:middle
right voice, some properties

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.886 A:middle
that are available like rate,

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.416 A:middle
pitch, and volume, and finally

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:39.376 A:middle
attributed strings.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesis is an API for

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.836 A:middle
generating computer synthesized

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:47.776 A:middle
speech on your iOS devices.

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.156 A:middle
It has many uses.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.446 A:middle
For example, you might want to

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.556 A:middle
post announcements within your

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:52.786 A:middle
app.

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:54.566 A:middle
You might be creating an

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.266 A:middle
interface that's not meant to be

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:56.826 A:middle
looked at.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.886 A:middle
Or you might be creating an

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.306 A:middle
education app where having

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.306 A:middle
education app where having

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:02.246 A:middle
synthesized speech provides a

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
good reinforcement for learning

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.215 A:middle
materials.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.236 A:middle
One example, providing audio

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:08.866 A:middle
updates during a workout can be

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.596 A:middle
communicated effectively using

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.496 A:middle
synthesized speech.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.996 A:middle
A note about synthesis and

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.026 A:middle
accessibility.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.286 A:middle
So speech synthesis is a

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.816 A:middle
powerful tool for helping many

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.586 A:middle
users with many disabilities.

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:23.956 A:middle
For example, cognitive users can

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.806 A:middle
get reinforcement about the

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:27.336 A:middle
output that they are

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:28.046 A:middle
experiencing.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:29.776 A:middle
Users who have trouble

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:31.386 A:middle
vocalizing speech can use

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:33.046 A:middle
synthesis to generate speech for

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:33.336 A:middle
them.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.206 A:middle
Non-sighted users use speech

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:37.566 A:middle
synthesis to consume their

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.336 A:middle
interfaces.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
However, it's important to note

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.376 A:middle
that it is not a replacement for

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:43.946 A:middle
VoiceOver or other screen reader

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
technologies.

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
For example, speech can overlap

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:47.796 A:middle
with what VoiceOver is speaking

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:48.576 A:middle
at the same time.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.846 A:middle
And most of the speech won't be

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.626 A:middle
available to any devices that

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.926 A:middle
are connected such as a Braille

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:54.366 A:middle
device.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.816 A:middle
Instead, you should make your

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.026 A:middle
app accessible using the

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
UIAccessibility API.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
UIAccessibility API.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:03.206 A:middle
Okay. So let's get to the

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:03.736 A:middle
basics.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.216 A:middle
First step, create an

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.426 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:07.926 A:middle
You can use that with this code

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:08.306 A:middle
snippet.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.356 A:middle
One thing to note is that you

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:11.276 A:middle
want to make sure that it's

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.876 A:middle
retained until speech is done.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:14.836 A:middle
If the synthesizer goes out of

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.786 A:middle
scope, any synthesis in-flight

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:17.456 A:middle
will be canceled.

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:20.296 A:middle
Now that we've created a

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.606 A:middle
synthesis, the next job is to

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:22.576 A:middle
create an utterance.

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:24.566 A:middle
We can then dispatch that to the

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:25.236 A:middle
synthesizer.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:28.016 A:middle
So, in this example, we create

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:28.926 A:middle
an utterance with the string

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:30.816 A:middle
hello and then we dispatch it

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.406 A:middle
using the speak method.

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.486 A:middle
A note about audio sessions.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.416 A:middle
So when AVSpeechSynthesis is

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:41.496 A:middle
activated using speak, the audio

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.106 A:middle
session will automatically set

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:43.546 A:middle
to active.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.706 A:middle
If you want to mix with other

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.256 A:middle
audio, you can use the

00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:48.966 A:middle
setCategory with options on your

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:50.976 A:middle
shared AVAudioSession mixed with

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:51.356 A:middle
others.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:53.266 A:middle
If you wanted to duck other

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.816 A:middle
audio so that your speech is

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.576 A:middle
primary but then other audio

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.276 A:middle
becomes lower in volume, you can

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.086 A:middle
use the duckOthers option.

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.086 A:middle
use the duckOthers option.

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:04.436 A:middle
Another note is that the audio

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.706 A:middle
session will not be set to

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.436 A:middle
inactive after speech is done.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.146 A:middle
That's because it's a shared

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.026 A:middle
session only so that if there is

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.436 A:middle
any other audio playing at the

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.756 A:middle
same time, we would not want to

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:15.336 A:middle
stop that.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:17.576 A:middle
So if you want to set the audio

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:18.826 A:middle
session to inactive, you would

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:19.566 A:middle
do that yourself.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.386 A:middle
There are some callback methods

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
available in AVSpeechSynthesis

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.386 A:middle
that will help inform about the

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:27.716 A:middle
life cycle of an utterance.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.036 A:middle
These are optional methods in

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:31.016 A:middle
the synthesizer delegate

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:31.516 A:middle
protocol.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.656 A:middle
For example, you can know when

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.116 A:middle
speech starts, speech finishes,

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:37.946 A:middle
even the character ranges that

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:38.746 A:middle
will be spoken.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.506 A:middle
You can also know when speech is

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.676 A:middle
paused or continued.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
So an example of this in code

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:47.226 A:middle
snippet form, you can set your

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.036 A:middle
synthesizer delegate to an

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:50.586 A:middle
object and then implement these

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.926 A:middle
methods, for example the

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
didStart in which case you'll

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.886 A:middle
get the utterance back, the

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.586 A:middle
didFinish which will do the

00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:59.976 A:middle
appropriate thing, and then the

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.186 A:middle
which will give you back an

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
NSRange which then you can

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
convert into a string range to

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.306 A:middle
use that in your string.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:12.606 A:middle
Now a little demo.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, my friends.

00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:18.976 A:middle
I'm inside the iPhone.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Those are the basics

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.226 A:middle
of AVSpeechSynthesis and, as you

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.796 A:middle
can see, it's very simple to get

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:28.386 A:middle
off the ground.

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.766 A:middle
The next topic is how do you

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.746 A:middle
choose a right voice?

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:33.236 A:middle
There are many built-in voices,

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:34.716 A:middle
one for each supported language.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.516 A:middle
Something to note is Siri voices

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.146 A:middle
are not available through this

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:39.446 A:middle
API.

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:42.356 A:middle
Users can, however, download

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.766 A:middle
higher-quality voices.

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.716 A:middle
And when those are downloaded,

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.286 A:middle
they will appear in the list of

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:46.856 A:middle
voices.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:50.846 A:middle
So you can select a voice using

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.176 A:middle
either an identifier or a

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:52.706 A:middle
language.

00:04:53.246 --> 00:04:54.386 A:middle
If you select a voice by

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:55.486 A:middle
language, it will select the

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.606 A:middle
user's default voice.

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:58.736 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.356 A:middle
First you make your utterance

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.356 A:middle
First you make your utterance

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:01.406 A:middle
and then you set the voice

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.506 A:middle
property using

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:03.886 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
As an example of using the

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.296 A:middle
identifier initializer, you

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.896 A:middle
could get all the speech voices

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.266 A:middle
which is an array of speech

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.116 A:middle
voice objects and then choose

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.546 A:middle
the first one, for example, and

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
then pass in the identifier

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.126 A:middle
property.

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:22.136 A:middle
Here are some of the languages

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.166 A:middle
that are supported on iOS by

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:24.476 A:middle
default.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.136 A:middle
Now let's talk about some of the

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:31.096 A:middle
properties that you can use on

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.116 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
Speech rate can be controlled

00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:36.336 A:middle
using the rate property, and it

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.406 A:middle
goes from 0 to 1.

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.856 A:middle
Now this will scale speech to go

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
slower or faster.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
Speech will be scaled from about

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.686 A:middle
0 to 1 with values from 0 to .5.

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:50.206 A:middle
So that means if you pass in .5,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.776 A:middle
you will get the default normal

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:52.396 A:middle
speaking rate.

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.606 A:middle
If you want to go faster, you

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
can pass in values from .5 to 1

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
and that will scale speech from

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.296 A:middle
normal speaking rates at 1x all

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.296 A:middle
normal speaking rates at 1x all

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
the way up to 4x.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.666 A:middle
To do that, you can create a

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:05.926 A:middle
speech utterance and then set

00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:09.056 A:middle
the rate to a float value or you

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
can use some of these constants

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:12.956 A:middle
which are default rate maximum

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:13.526 A:middle
or minimum.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.496 A:middle
Let's talk about pitch and

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:16.836 A:middle
volume.

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.316 A:middle
These are also properties you

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.446 A:middle
set on the speech utterance.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:21.386 A:middle
Pitch controls how high the

00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:23.076 A:middle
voice is or how low.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.046 A:middle
Volume controls the volume of

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:25.986 A:middle
the voice itself.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.496 A:middle
So, for example, we can set

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.146 A:middle
pitch to a very high pitch voice

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.786 A:middle
using a one value.

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:33.706 A:middle
We can set volume to a lower

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:35.286 A:middle
volume using .25.

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:37.116 A:middle
Note that lowering the speech

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.086 A:middle
volume does not affect the

00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:38.996 A:middle
system volume.

00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:43.466 A:middle
Finally, let's talk about

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.616 A:middle
attributed strings.

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.936 A:middle
Attributed strings allow us to

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:48.716 A:middle
customize how speech sounds

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:49.866 A:middle
using different attributes.

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.136 A:middle
One available attribute that I'd

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:53.896 A:middle
like to discuss is IPA notation.

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:55.636 A:middle
IPA stands for International

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
Phonetic Alphabet, and it allows

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
us to customize how specialized

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
us to customize how specialized

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.606 A:middle
names, nouns, and other things

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
are pronounced.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.116 A:middle
It's available in these

00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:06.766 A:middle
languages.

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:10.886 A:middle
And here is an example of what

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:11.566 A:middle
it might look like.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:13.676 A:middle
To pronounce the iPhone in the

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.286 A:middle
way that we are used to, you

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.836 A:middle
would use this IPA notation.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.756 A:middle
Now the obvious question is how

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:20.806 A:middle
do you generate this IPA

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:21.406 A:middle
notation?

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:22.886 A:middle
It is not easy to type with a

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:23.346 A:middle
keyboard.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.306 A:middle
One way to do that is to use the

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.126 A:middle
pronunciation editor in

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.306 A:middle
accessibility settings.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:30.886 A:middle
So when you go to the settings

00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:33.046 A:middle
app, go into accessibility and

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:33.836 A:middle
speech, you will find

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.376 A:middle
pronunciations and find a screen

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
like this.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:37.946 A:middle
You can enter in the phrase that

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.536 A:middle
you want to find the correct

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:41.066 A:middle
pronunciation for, tap the

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:42.666 A:middle
microphone button, and then

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.136 A:middle
speak it.

00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:45.796 A:middle
After you're done, you'll be

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:47.516 A:middle
presented with options on

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:48.686 A:middle
possible variations.

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.346 A:middle
As you tap those, it will say

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.036 A:middle
those out loud.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.106 A:middle
You can choose the one that

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:53.656 A:middle
sounds correct and then copy

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:55.876 A:middle
this value that you get into

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:56.366 A:middle
your code.

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.136 A:middle
So let's see how that's done.

00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:00.966 A:middle
First, we make an attributed

00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:00.966 A:middle
First, we make an attributed

00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.836 A:middle
string then we can add the

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
attribute for the speech IPA

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.236 A:middle
notation using the value that we

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.256 A:middle
got from the settings.

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:12.686 A:middle
Finally, we can create a speech

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.656 A:middle
utterance with the attributed

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:17.116 A:middle
string.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.116 A:middle
So in summary, AVSpeechSynthesis

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:21.446 A:middle
is a great way to augment your

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:23.336 A:middle
app experience if you add speech

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.266 A:middle
at the right time.

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.476 A:middle
Multiple languages and voices

00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:28.046 A:middle
are available and can be

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:29.126 A:middle
dynamic.

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:31.336 A:middle
Finally, you can customize

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:33.056 A:middle
pronunciation for the way words

00:08:33.056 --> 00:08:34.696 A:middle
sound using the IPA notation

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:35.106 A:middle
attribute.

00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:40.226 A:middle

00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:43.366 A:middle
watching.
