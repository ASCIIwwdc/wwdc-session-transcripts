[ Music ]

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:22.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Maps are everywhere.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.016 A:middle
People have been recording

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.286 A:middle
information about the world

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:27.436 A:middle
around them as far as we can

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:27.766 A:middle
tell.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.916 A:middle
And we use maps for a wide

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:30.976 A:middle
variety of purposes.

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.836 A:middle
Like finding a new hiking trail

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.076 A:middle
or keeping tabs on the progress

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.086 A:middle
of our dinner or dessert order.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.706 A:middle
We can even use maps to orient

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:45.726 A:middle
ourselves in imaginary places,

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.416 A:middle
tracking our movement through

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.626 A:middle
levels of a game, or a

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.596 A:middle
character's position on a

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.866 A:middle
fictional battlefield.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.756 A:middle
Mapping technologies continue to

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.356 A:middle
evolve, but the essential

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.246 A:middle
characteristics of maps remain

00:00:59.246 --> 00:00:59.796 A:middle
the same.


00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:01.976 A:middle
They are abstract

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:04.016 A:middle
representations of real or

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:06.276 A:middle
fictional places, that show

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:07.556 A:middle
features relative to other

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:09.086 A:middle
features in space, and they

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.916 A:middle
offer information about the

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:12.576 A:middle
attributes of those features.

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.466 A:middle
Maps are tremendously useful and

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.696 A:middle
they're really fun to make.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:19.596 A:middle
One option to consider is

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.336 A:middle
MapKit, our native framework.

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.096 A:middle
You can see it here in the

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:23.606 A:middle
activity app.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.306 A:middle
MapKit does a lot of work for

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:26.496 A:middle
you.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:28.506 A:middle
It integrates cleanly with the

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:29.256 A:middle
rest of our UI.

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:32.366 A:middle
It contains base map data and

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.446 A:middle
satellite imagery for the entire

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:34.936 A:middle
world.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.506 A:middle
It allows users to pan and zoom,

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:39.736 A:middle
and it looks great.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.856 A:middle
But depending on your data and

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.516 A:middle
design requirements, you

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:44.956 A:middle
sometimes need something a bit

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:45.786 A:middle
more custom.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:47.976 A:middle
So, we'll talk about the process

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:50.366 A:middle
of map creation and review three

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.716 A:middle
key tips for making a map shine,

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.176 A:middle
which will be relevant

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.676 A:middle
regardless of how you're

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:56.456 A:middle
creating your maps.

00:01:57.176 --> 00:01:58.236 A:middle
There's a lot to know about

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.156 A:middle
making exceptional maps, but


00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.156 A:middle
making exceptional maps, but

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:02.376 A:middle
here's an excellent place to

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:04.556 A:middle
start.

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:07.896 A:middle
First, know your audience and

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:08.626 A:middle
what they need.

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.736 A:middle
Second, carefully choose your

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.676 A:middle
map elements and leave out the

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.626 A:middle
things that aren't necessary.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.916 A:middle
And third, focus on hierarchy so

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.796 A:middle
that it's immediately clear what

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:21.916 A:middle
is most important.

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.016 A:middle
Why know your audience?

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.946 A:middle
Well, you need to know what your

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.446 A:middle
users are trying to do.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.226 A:middle
Because this knowledge will

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:31.806 A:middle
shape every part of your map,

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.316 A:middle
from the features you include to

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.326 A:middle
your design decisions.

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.566 A:middle
And the success of your map

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
really depends on its

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:40.576 A:middle
responsiveness to those user

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:41.036 A:middle
goals.

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.456 A:middle
Keep in mind that you sometimes

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:44.786 A:middle
have more than one group of

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:46.636 A:middle
users with different needs.

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.186 A:middle
For instance, if you're making a

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.766 A:middle
navigation map, perhaps you'll

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.526 A:middle
have some users traveling by

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:57.816 A:middle
bike, others on transit, and the

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:58.636 A:middle
rest by boat.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
So, these different modes of


00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
So, these different modes of

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
transportation will mean that

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.996 A:middle
your users are concerned about

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:04.846 A:middle
different things.

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.306 A:middle
Grade matters a lot to cyclists,

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:09.626 A:middle
so they might need contour lines

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:10.916 A:middle
or other indications about

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.656 A:middle
topography.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.146 A:middle
Train passengers are especially

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:15.786 A:middle
likely to want transit stations

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.386 A:middle
represented very clearly.

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:20.196 A:middle
And those arriving by boat care

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:21.976 A:middle
much more about dock amenities

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:23.346 A:middle
and bathymetry than others.

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.576 A:middle
Keeping these types of needs in

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.186 A:middle
mind helps you make a more

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:27.776 A:middle
useful map.

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.896 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.856 A:middle
We're going to build a map for a

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.346 A:middle
fictional game about my cat.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:37.496 A:middle
It's is called Pantera's Big

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.986 A:middle
Adventure and in it, players

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.746 A:middle
travel Pac-Man style around the

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.316 A:middle
neighborhood picking up as many

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:45.086 A:middle
catnip mice as they can before

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.306 A:middle
it's time to go home for dinner.

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:48.876 A:middle
We'll build out the game map and

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.866 A:middle
use this exercise to illustrate

00:03:50.866 --> 00:03:52.186 A:middle
those three tips.

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:54.746 A:middle
This map is a bit unusual for a

00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:55.676 A:middle
few reasons.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.506 A:middle
It will also function as a

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
gameboard, it's showing an

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
imaginary place, and perhaps


00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
imaginary place, and perhaps

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
most importantly, it's only

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.836 A:middle
going to exist at one scale.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
If we were making a map where

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
users could zoom in and out,

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:10.136 A:middle
we'd need to think carefully

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:11.656 A:middle
about how our data and display

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.466 A:middle
might change at different zooms.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:15.826 A:middle
But this is a design studio

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.666 A:middle
short, not a design studio long.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:18.866 A:middle
So, we're going to stick with

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:19.826 A:middle
just one zoom.

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:22.326 A:middle
However, the principles are

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.056 A:middle
going to be the same whether

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
your mapping a cat's escapades

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.786 A:middle
through a fictional neighborhood

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.026 A:middle
or making a dynamic map of the

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.106 A:middle
whole entire world.

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.796 A:middle
So, let's get started by

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.216 A:middle
thinking about the purpose of

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:34.706 A:middle
this map.

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:36.846 A:middle
We want to make a game that

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:38.146 A:middle
would be perfect to play for a

00:04:38.146 --> 00:04:39.986 A:middle
few minutes on the bus, or while

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:41.106 A:middle
relaxing in a park.

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:42.736 A:middle
And we're going to want to make

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:43.786 A:middle
sure that our map really

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:44.566 A:middle
reflects this.

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:47.546 A:middle
It should be fun, kind of

00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
cartoony, cute and lighthearted,

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.776 A:middle
and really simple to understand.

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:53.706 A:middle
So, let's think about what

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:55.026 A:middle
players will be doing within

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:55.656 A:middle
this game.

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:58.046 A:middle
It's pretty intuitive, they're

00:04:58.046 --> 00:04:59.126 A:middle
going to be moving around the

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
map finding the mice and


00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
map finding the mice and

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.426 A:middle
avoiding the hazards.

00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:04.036 A:middle
So, they'll need to see

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:06.566 A:middle
sidewalks, mice, and hazards.

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:08.966 A:middle
Okay, enough talking about maps.

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.266 A:middle
Let's get started building it.

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:13.076 A:middle
We're not going to take the time

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:14.936 A:middle
to style it right away and we're

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
going to be iterating on this

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
design throughout.

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:18.936 A:middle
This is going to be a work in

00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:20.946 A:middle
progress but we're going to keep

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.566 A:middle
the map purpose and the user

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:24.146 A:middle
goals in mind throughout.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.036 A:middle
So, we'll start with sidewalks

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.786 A:middle
because the street is too hot

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:29.946 A:middle
for delicate kitty toes and

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.796 A:middle
sometimes the grass is damp.

00:05:33.186 --> 00:05:34.366 A:middle
And then, we'll add the mice,

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.036 A:middle
and now those hazards.

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.366 A:middle
Dogs, Pantera is not a fan, as

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.166 A:middle
well as fountains, which

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:45.326 A:middle
sometimes unpredictably spray

00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:45.806 A:middle
water.

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:49.556 A:middle
So, these are the essential

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.236 A:middle
elements from that list.

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:52.906 A:middle
But we should also include

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:54.726 A:middle
Pantera's house, where she

00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:55.766 A:middle
begins each round.

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:58.186 A:middle
Of course, Pantera herself.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And the pet store where she can


00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And the pet store where she can

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:04.666 A:middle
regain her health.

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:06.396 A:middle
Okay so, this is starting to

00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:07.206 A:middle
come together.

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:08.966 A:middle
Remember we're going to restyle

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.586 A:middle
later on, but this map looks

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.136 A:middle
kind of bare in places, and

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
doesn't give us all the

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.066 A:middle
information that we might really

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:16.296 A:middle
want.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
So, we can all think of elements

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.386 A:middle
that we've seen in other maps.

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:22.786 A:middle
Let's add some of them and then

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:24.006 A:middle
decide whether or not they

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:25.896 A:middle
really belong in this particular

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:26.086 A:middle
map.

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:29.056 A:middle
We could, for example, include

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.246 A:middle
the rest of the building

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:31.026 A:middle
footprints.

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
Maybe some polygons for those

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:34.566 A:middle
parks.

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:36.836 A:middle
Perhaps a title.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:40.066 A:middle
Possibly even a legend.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.286 A:middle
Lots of maps have a compass rose

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:43.846 A:middle
and a scale bar.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:45.766 A:middle
Oh, right, and since this map is

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:47.076 A:middle
doubling as a gameboard, we'll

00:06:47.076 --> 00:06:49.086 A:middle
need a few other elements too.

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.646 A:middle
Like a health indicator, a mouse

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:52.036 A:middle
counter.

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:53.626 A:middle
How can we know if we're

00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:54.826 A:middle
successful otherwise.

00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:55.916 A:middle
And a timer.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.176 A:middle
This game doesn't last forever.


00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:01.406 A:middle
All right.

00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:05.126 A:middle
But wait. It's easy for maps to

00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:05.936 A:middle
get overloaded.

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:08.016 A:middle
And this is a great example of

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.036 A:middle
that exact problem.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.086 A:middle
Way too much is happening here.

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:15.746 A:middle
Our map is chaotic and it's not

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:17.466 A:middle
necessarily reflective of our

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.606 A:middle
intent, which was to create

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.756 A:middle
something that's cute, fun to

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:22.506 A:middle
look at, and easy to understand.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.646 A:middle
And, thinking back to the

00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:26.556 A:middle
purpose of this map, we're

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:27.966 A:middle
losing sight of the features

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:29.276 A:middle
that are most important to

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:31.286 A:middle
users, mice, sidewalks, and

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:31.856 A:middle
hazards.

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:33.656 A:middle
So, let's fix this.

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:38.146 A:middle
It's time to think seriously

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:39.366 A:middle
about leaving things out.

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:41.556 A:middle
Because when it comes to maps,

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.266 A:middle
knowing what to omit is just as

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.616 A:middle
important as knowing what to

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:46.096 A:middle
include.

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:48.006 A:middle
We're going to remove some of

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:49.556 A:middle
the elements that aren't really

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:51.376 A:middle
necessary for this particular

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:52.226 A:middle
map.

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:56.366 A:middle
So, as we know the map exists

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:57.266 A:middle
within our game.

00:07:57.816 --> 00:07:59.476 A:middle
So, don't really need a title

00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:01.156 A:middle
here though of course we'd want


00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:01.156 A:middle
here though of course we'd want

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:04.126 A:middle
a title on many other maps.

00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:05.986 A:middle
Legends are really important for

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.356 A:middle
maps with more complicated

00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:08.236 A:middle
symbology.

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:09.826 A:middle
But I don't think we need one

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:10.136 A:middle
here.

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:11.786 A:middle
It's pretty straightforward.

00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:16.316 A:middle
The compass rose is demanding a

00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:17.466 A:middle
lot of attention.

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:21.236 A:middle
But this isn't a navigation map

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:22.496 A:middle
and cardinal directions are

00:08:22.496 --> 00:08:23.906 A:middle
irrelevant in this game.

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:26.466 A:middle
And let's lose the scale bar

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:26.846 A:middle
too.

00:08:27.346 --> 00:08:28.916 A:middle
We'd want it if we were using

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:33.246 A:middle
the map to plan a trip but were

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:33.336 A:middle
not.

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.356 A:middle
Okay. So, take a look over there

00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:35.775 A:middle
on the right.

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:38.176 A:middle
We've removed a lot of noise

00:08:38.176 --> 00:08:38.616 A:middle
from the map.

00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:40.256 A:middle
And we've ended up with a leaner

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:41.515 A:middle
set of elements.

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:43.076 A:middle
Notice too that we aren't

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:44.566 A:middle
including things like road or

00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:45.436 A:middle
park labels.

00:08:45.836 --> 00:08:47.106 A:middle
They aren't needed for this map,

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:48.576 A:middle
and they would add a lot of

00:08:48.636 --> 00:08:49.066 A:middle
clutter.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.846 A:middle
You can probably think of other

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:52.406 A:middle
map elements that we're leaving

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:52.946 A:middle
out too.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.886 A:middle
So, this is moving us in the

00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:55.766 A:middle
right direction.

00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:57.516 A:middle
But our map definitely still

00:08:57.516 --> 00:08:58.136 A:middle
need some work.

00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:00.456 A:middle
Let's think about how to modify


00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:00.456 A:middle
Let's think about how to modify

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:05.596 A:middle
our display and make sure that

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:06.916 A:middle
we're highlighting what really

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.746 A:middle
matters and minimizing what

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:09.086 A:middle
doesn't.

00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:11.066 A:middle
So, to do this, we're going to

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:12.666 A:middle
look back on our list of key

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:13.416 A:middle
elements.

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:15.846 A:middle
Sidewalks, mice, and hazards.

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:18.046 A:middle
And remind ourselves of the

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:19.476 A:middle
overall vibe that we're aiming

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:19.686 A:middle
for.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.766 A:middle
Fun, cute, and simple.

00:09:22.336 --> 00:09:23.446 A:middle
We'll start with some big

00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:25.216 A:middle
changes and then we'll move on

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:28.126 A:middle
to tuning the map.

00:09:28.126 --> 00:09:31.026 A:middle
So, first up, our buildings.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:33.066 A:middle
I like this color of blue,

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:33.786 A:middle
personally.

00:09:34.146 --> 00:09:35.386 A:middle
But it's really not working here

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:36.296 A:middle
for two reasons.

00:09:36.706 --> 00:09:39.276 A:middle
First many map users associate

00:09:39.276 --> 00:09:41.256 A:middle
blue with water, making this

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:42.486 A:middle
neighborhood look like some

00:09:42.556 --> 00:09:44.066 A:middle
strange collection of pools.

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.266 A:middle
And second, I think the color is

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:47.296 A:middle
distracting here.

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:48.776 A:middle
Remember that the building

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:50.926 A:middle
polygons are really only here to

00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:52.686 A:middle
give us some context and fill

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.826 A:middle
out the city blocks a bit.

00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:57.916 A:middle
This gray is more subdued, and

00:09:57.946 --> 00:09:59.686 A:middle
it lets other elements stand out

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:00.126 A:middle
better.


00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:00.126 A:middle
better.

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
But remember, there are those

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:03.046 A:middle
two important buildings.

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:05.206 A:middle
Let's restyle Pantera's house

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.406 A:middle
and the pet store too.

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.026 A:middle
And for the pet store we'll add

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:11.446 A:middle
a heart that matches the health

00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:12.866 A:middle
indicator as a visual cue.

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.886 A:middle
Okay. Now to restyle the parks.

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.586 A:middle
They're really prominent right

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.216 A:middle
now, but they're not as

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:21.646 A:middle
important as the sidewalks,

00:10:21.646 --> 00:10:22.776 A:middle
mice, or hazards.

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:24.986 A:middle
It makes sense to leave the park

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:27.126 A:middle
polygons green, since this color

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.726 A:middle
is often associated with parks.

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:30.586 A:middle
But I'm not satisfied with the

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.046 A:middle
shade.

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:32.426 A:middle
It's too dark and that makes it

00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:33.196 A:middle
distracting.

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:36.386 A:middle
Okay, I think this lighter green

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.516 A:middle
is a nice change.

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.856 A:middle
White still seems like a good

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.046 A:middle
color for the sidewalks.

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:42.926 A:middle
Notice how it's standing out

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:44.336 A:middle
against the dark background.

00:10:44.456 --> 00:10:45.756 A:middle
But I think we should bump up

00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:46.466 A:middle
the line weight.

00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:48.706 A:middle
Yeah, better.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:54.206 A:middle
Okay. So, the so the base map is

00:10:54.206 --> 00:10:56.286 A:middle
more muted now, and that means

00:10:56.286 --> 00:10:57.976 A:middle
that we can turn our attention

00:10:58.256 --> 00:10:59.666 A:middle
to the symbols and game

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
elements.


00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
elements.

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:02.846 A:middle
We need to talk about the

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:03.436 A:middle
photos.

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:05.786 A:middle
They're cute, but I don't really

00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:06.616 A:middle
think that they're the best

00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:07.406 A:middle
choice.

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:08.856 A:middle
The colors are kind of

00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:10.766 A:middle
distracting and there's a lot of

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:11.386 A:middle
detail.

00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
Remember, maps are an abstracted

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.156 A:middle
representation of a place.

00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:18.246 A:middle
We don't have to be literal.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.606 A:middle
We often use simple symbols in

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:20.896 A:middle
maps.

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:22.946 A:middle
So, let's try a drawing of a

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:23.686 A:middle
mouse instead.

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:27.036 A:middle
I think this is better in line

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:28.246 A:middle
with our fun and simple

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:28.866 A:middle
aesthetic.

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.486 A:middle
But now we need to make sure

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:31.506 A:middle
that the other symbols match

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:32.016 A:middle
too.

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
So, we'll switch up our dogs,

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:39.066 A:middle
and now the fountains.

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:43.956 A:middle
Notice that we lost some detail

00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:44.266 A:middle
here.

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:46.466 A:middle
When we were showing the

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:48.276 A:middle
fountains as photos, they were

00:11:48.276 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
different sizes.

00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:51.366 A:middle
But, this is a pretty simple

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:51.906 A:middle
game.

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:53.386 A:middle
So, our fountains don't deal

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:54.816 A:middle
different amounts of damage.

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:56.716 A:middle
We're simplifying the map here

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.336 A:middle
by having the symbols match.

00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.776 A:middle
Also, if we had sized their


00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.776 A:middle
Also, if we had sized their

00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:02.266 A:middle
placement symbols the way we did

00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:03.786 A:middle
the photos, the fountain in the

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:05.446 A:middle
larger park would be the biggest

00:12:05.446 --> 00:12:07.026 A:middle
symbol on the map, which would

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.356 A:middle
suggest that it's way more

00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:10.266 A:middle
important than it actually is.

00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:13.476 A:middle
Okay, now to change Pantera from

00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:15.016 A:middle
a photo to a symbol.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.576 A:middle
Still pretty cute.

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:22.826 A:middle
So, this map is coming right

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:23.246 A:middle
along.

00:12:23.836 --> 00:12:25.116 A:middle
We've moved away from the

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:27.226 A:middle
realism of the photos to some

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:28.566 A:middle
symbols that are easier to

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:30.356 A:middle
perceive at just a glance.

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:32.626 A:middle
But now, let's tackle those game

00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:33.256 A:middle
elements.

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:35.096 A:middle
They're just floating around at

00:12:35.096 --> 00:12:36.346 A:middle
the top of the screen where we

00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:37.906 A:middle
placed them initially, and I

00:12:37.906 --> 00:12:39.496 A:middle
think that's kind of confusing.

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.016 A:middle
We don't need to do a lot to

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:42.216 A:middle
restyle them because I think

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:42.996 A:middle
they're looking pretty good

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:44.956 A:middle
already, but let's collect them

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:46.466 A:middle
and make it really clear that

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:47.836 A:middle
they're part of the game UI and

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:49.076 A:middle
not part of the map.

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.296 A:middle
So, first we'll add a shaded

00:12:51.296 --> 00:12:51.496 A:middle
bar.

00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:55.586 A:middle
And now we're going to

00:12:55.586 --> 00:12:57.316 A:middle
reconfigure our health indicator

00:12:57.316 --> 00:12:58.446 A:middle
to fit inside of it.

00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
Nine lives is hard to


00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
Nine lives is hard to

00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:02.466 A:middle
accommodate, but could a cat

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:03.486 A:middle
game really have a different

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:03.956 A:middle
number?

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:05.566 A:middle
I don't think so, we've got to

00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:06.676 A:middle
make it work.

00:13:06.676 --> 00:13:08.466 A:middle
Now, we'll adjust the color,

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:10.526 A:middle
position, and size of our timer

00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:15.746 A:middle
and our mouse counter.

00:13:15.746 --> 00:13:17.276 A:middle
And now, I think we're getting

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:17.796 A:middle
closer.

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:19.896 A:middle
This map is shaping up to be

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:20.866 A:middle
pretty cute and fun.

00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:22.646 A:middle
And it's easy for users to

00:13:22.646 --> 00:13:24.186 A:middle
glance at it and see the key

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:24.586 A:middle
features.

00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:27.136 A:middle
But you know I think we can make

00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:28.056 A:middle
it even better.

00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:29.936 A:middle
I want to make sure that the

00:13:29.936 --> 00:13:31.786 A:middle
symbols are really standing out

00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:33.266 A:middle
against the colors of the base

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:33.386 A:middle
map.

00:13:34.176 --> 00:13:35.956 A:middle
Remember, the goal of the game

00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:36.936 A:middle
is to collect the mice.

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:39.626 A:middle
So, we can give users a helpful

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:41.406 A:middle
cue by making them a really

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:42.276 A:middle
eye-catching color.

00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:44.486 A:middle
Let's try out an orangey-yellow.

00:13:44.486 --> 00:13:47.856 A:middle
So, now they pop a little bit

00:13:47.856 --> 00:13:48.096 A:middle
more.

00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:50.196 A:middle
And let's see what else we can

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.096 A:middle
do with color here.

00:13:51.926 --> 00:13:53.406 A:middle
I notice that Pantera and the

00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:55.226 A:middle
dogs have similar markings on

00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:55.996 A:middle
their faces.

00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:57.806 A:middle
So, let's color them so that

00:13:57.806 --> 00:13:58.816 A:middle
they're more distinct.

00:13:59.496 --> 00:14:01.276 A:middle
Pantera can be purple, like her


00:13:59.496 --> 00:14:01.276 A:middle
Pantera can be purple, like her

00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:01.616 A:middle
house.

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:04.436 A:middle
And let's make the dogs brown.

00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:08.216 A:middle
Now the fountains look a little

00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:09.126 A:middle
bit out of place.

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:10.406 A:middle
We should color them too.

00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:12.296 A:middle
We'll go for blue, they're water

00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:12.956 A:middle
after all.

00:14:15.296 --> 00:14:18.596 A:middle
Okay. So, I think we're really

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:19.426 A:middle
getting close.

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:21.276 A:middle
But this isn't quite it yet.

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:23.536 A:middle
I have some concerns about the

00:14:23.536 --> 00:14:24.026 A:middle
dogs.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:25.756 A:middle
We don't want them to actually

00:14:25.756 --> 00:14:27.306 A:middle
looks scary, of course.

00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:28.456 A:middle
Remember, our game is supposed

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:29.996 A:middle
to be fun and lighthearted.

00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:31.456 A:middle
But they almost look too

00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:31.986 A:middle
friendly.

00:14:32.216 --> 00:14:33.356 A:middle
And we want to make it clear

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:34.956 A:middle
that players need to avoid them.

00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:39.176 A:middle
So, let's try adding some

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:41.926 A:middle
eyebrows.

00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:44.356 A:middle
Okay. With the addition of these

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.546 A:middle
dog eyebrows, I think we've got

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:47.436 A:middle
something pretty good.

00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:50.366 A:middle
Happens all the time.

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.936 A:middle
So, let's take a look back at

00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:53.496 A:middle
our progress.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.156 A:middle
On purpose this time.

00:14:57.456 --> 00:14:59.456 A:middle
We started here with all the

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:01.336 A:middle
elements we knew we'd need.


00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:01.336 A:middle
elements we knew we'd need.

00:15:01.336 --> 00:15:02.516 A:middle
And some that we weren't sure

00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:02.876 A:middle
about.

00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:05.236 A:middle
And then we removed some of

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:07.646 A:middle
those extraneous elements to get

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:08.506 A:middle
here.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:12.556 A:middle
This is getting clearer, but

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:13.706 A:middle
it's not really done yet.

00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:16.706 A:middle
Then we restyled the elements

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:20.266 A:middle
that we kept and we ended up

00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:20.736 A:middle
here.

00:15:22.216 --> 00:15:24.376 A:middle
Notice that the data is very

00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:24.966 A:middle
similar.

00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:26.976 A:middle
We've changed the way that we've

00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:29.566 A:middle
depicted it, but it's a lot of

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
the same information just

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.926 A:middle
presented in a different way.

00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:36.586 A:middle
So, thinking back to those

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:38.636 A:middle
initial goals, is this map

00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:39.516 A:middle
successful?

00:15:40.036 --> 00:15:41.596 A:middle
Is it immediately apparent what

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:42.536 A:middle
matters most?

00:15:43.196 --> 00:15:44.516 A:middle
Does it look kind of fun and

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
cute?

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:46.756 A:middle
Do you think players will be

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.736 A:middle
able to understand what is where

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.196 A:middle
and what it means with just a

00:15:50.196 --> 00:15:50.476 A:middle
glance?

00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:52.966 A:middle
These are the kinds of questions

00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:54.256 A:middle
to ask yourself throughout your

00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:55.066 A:middle
design process.

00:15:55.936 --> 00:15:57.306 A:middle
Make sure that you're taking

00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:58.786 A:middle
every opportunity to show your

00:15:58.786 --> 00:16:00.446 A:middle
map to other people and get


00:15:58.786 --> 00:16:00.446 A:middle
map to other people and get

00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:01.446 A:middle
their feedback too.

00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
Maybe your friends, family, and

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:05.296 A:middle
colleagues will agree that your

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.206 A:middle
map is nailing all those goals.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.866 A:middle
Maybe they'll feel like it's

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:09.866 A:middle
still work in progress.

00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:12.046 A:middle
If that's the case, keep

00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.226 A:middle
iterating until you feel

00:16:13.226 --> 00:16:14.006 A:middle
satisfied.

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:15.986 A:middle
Are you ready to see this map in

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
action?

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:27.976 A:middle
All right.

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:35.746 A:middle
So, I hope this exercise has

00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:37.406 A:middle
helped inspire you for the next

00:16:37.556 --> 00:16:38.916 A:middle
map that you get to make.

00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:41.886 A:middle
Remember to think carefully

00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:44.826 A:middle
about knowing your audience,

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:46.476 A:middle
leaving out the things that they

00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:48.716 A:middle
don't really need, and making it

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.396 A:middle
clear with visual hierarchy,

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:51.506 A:middle
what matters most.
