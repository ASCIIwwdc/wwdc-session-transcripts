[ Applause ]

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:32.235 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Hi, I'm really excited

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.746 A:middle
to be here to talk to you today

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.316 A:middle
about The Qualities of Great

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:35.866 A:middle
Design.

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.156 A:middle
My name is Lauren Strehlow, and

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:39.996 A:middle
I'm a design evangelist here at

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:40.316 A:middle
Apple.

00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:42.956 A:middle
The evangelism team, our number

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:44.886 A:middle
one goal is to help developers

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:47.896 A:middle
just like you create great apps.

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:50.106 A:middle
And a big part of my job is

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:51.596 A:middle
actually to work with the design

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:53.096 A:middle
presenters who are putting on

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.326 A:middle
all of the awesome design

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.566 A:middle
session content that you see

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.376 A:middle
here at the conference.

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.876 A:middle
So when I started to work with

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.876 A:middle
So when I started to work with

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:02.696 A:middle
potential presenters this year

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.616 A:middle
about their talks, this theme of

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.886 A:middle
quality kept coming up, but

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:09.646 A:middle
nobody was talking about it head

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.276 A:middle
on, so I decided to.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.426 A:middle
But I went about it a little bit

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:14.906 A:middle
differently.

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.576 A:middle
I decided to talk to great

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.806 A:middle
designers from our developer

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.896 A:middle
community, such as the creative

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.456 A:middle
director at The Game Band.

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:27.376 A:middle
I also talked to the cofounders

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:28.866 A:middle
of the Layers Conference, which

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.756 A:middle
is actually happening right now

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:31.616 A:middle
across the street.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:34.626 A:middle
And I talked to the VP of Design

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:35.716 A:middle
at Khan Academy.

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:37.836 A:middle
I also talked to some of my

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:39.416 A:middle
great colleagues here at Apple

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.426 A:middle
who work in a wide variety of

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:42.326 A:middle
design disciplines.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
They work in type design, sound

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.576 A:middle
design, motion, visual, and

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
interaction design.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.976 A:middle
These are all real people who I

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.246 A:middle
truly admire and respect, and I

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:58.836 A:middle
think they have created great

00:01:58.966 --> 00:01:59.976 A:middle
apps and games that have

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:01.186 A:middle
tremendous caliber.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:03.926 A:middle
So I conducted a series of

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:04.416 A:middle
interviews.

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
I talked to 13 people, and I

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:09.506 A:middle
asked them a ton of questions to

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:11.446 A:middle
discover what quality means to

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:13.796 A:middle
them, what challenges they face,

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.106 A:middle
and what they do to strive for

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:17.346 A:middle
excellence in design.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.836 A:middle
So before you think any of this

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.086 A:middle
is scripted, I actually didn't

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:24.666 A:middle
give anybody these questions in

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.066 A:middle
advance.

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:26.946 A:middle
So everything you're about to

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:29.986 A:middle
hear today is real reactions to

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:30.756 A:middle
these questions.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.026 A:middle
I collected over 15 hours of

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.396 A:middle
interview footage, and I've

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.596 A:middle
distilled it down to the very

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:39.246 A:middle
essence of these responses.

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:41.826 A:middle
So the audio clips you're about

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.006 A:middle
to hear today represent what I

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.276 A:middle
discovered about quality in

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.156 A:middle
great design.

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.196 A:middle
So today, we're going to dig

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:51.826 A:middle
into interpretations of quality

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.916 A:middle
and how it influences our

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:55.506 A:middle
perceptions and design

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:56.046 A:middle
directions.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.736 A:middle
We're also going to talk about

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.486 A:middle
its effect on people's lives.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.486 A:middle
its effect on people's lives.

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:03.056 A:middle
[laughs] Actually, this is

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:03.946 A:middle
really exciting because it

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:05.456 A:middle
turned out to be so much more

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
than what I expected.

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.286 A:middle
We're also going to hear about

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:11.176 A:middle
aspirations from the designers

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
that I interviewed, to hear what

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:14.576 A:middle
drives them, what goals they

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:15.856 A:middle
have when they're striving for

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:17.886 A:middle
quality, even if those goals

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:18.936 A:middle
seem unattainable.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.746 A:middle
And finally, I want to share

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.306 A:middle
some techniques that were

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.176 A:middle
revealed while asking people

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:26.526 A:middle
about their experiences.

00:03:27.226 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
And I hope that these techniques

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.156 A:middle
can help you approach the

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:31.946 A:middle
challenge of designing for a lot

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:32.396 A:middle
of people.

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.496 A:middle
So this session is all about the

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:37.086 A:middle
qualities of great design

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.036 A:middle
defined by designers.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.396 A:middle
So let's kick things off, and

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
get started, and hear a few

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:49.046 A:middle
answers to this one simple

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:52.516 A:middle
question: What is quality?

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:55.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Quality is nothing else than

00:03:55.796 --> 00:04:00.486 A:middle
what we agree upon is good.

00:03:55.796 --> 00:04:00.486 A:middle
what we agree upon is good.

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If something is quality, it

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:05.906 A:middle
implies that there is nothing

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:07.486 A:middle
random about it.

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:10.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The number one thing is just

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.476 A:middle
that something with a lot of

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:18.206 A:middle
care and time went into it.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:19.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's one of those things that

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:20.826 A:middle
people can feel it when they

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.276 A:middle
feel it, and it's very hard for

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.006 A:middle
them to put their finger on it.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:25.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:27.816 A:middle
This one I can really relate to.

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.916 A:middle
I'm totally a feeler, and so

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.726 A:middle
this naturally led me to ask a

00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:34.366 A:middle
follow-on question: What does

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.326 A:middle
quality feel like?

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:38.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Does it feel like somebody

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:39.866 A:middle
has thought of you already and

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:41.016 A:middle
all the things that you need are

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:42.286 A:middle
easy to get to and very

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:42.946 A:middle
understandable?

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:46.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think that when I'm

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:47.966 A:middle
thinking about things that are

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.626 A:middle
quality or handling things that

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.176 A:middle
are quality, it's things that

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:54.566 A:middle
aren't painful to use in any

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:55.676 A:middle
way, which could be, like,

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:57.556 A:middle
mentally painful, physically

00:04:57.556 --> 00:04:59.766 A:middle
painful, emotionally painful,

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:01.996 A:middle
things that don't make me feel

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
uncomfortable, or dumb, or

00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:05.976 A:middle
[laughs] or inconvenienced.

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you just launch the app

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.036 A:middle
and you feel, as you use it, oh,

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
well, this feels like

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.666 A:middle
state-of-the-art technology that

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:15.366 A:middle
I'm using.

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:16.836 A:middle
This feels like it's easier for

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:18.136 A:middle
me to get things done.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.706 A:middle
I feel more productive.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.136 A:middle
I feel like I'm able to achieve

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:21.996 A:middle
better results.

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:25.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All the concentration that

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.636 A:middle
you're building up goes to the

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:28.806 A:middle
task at hand, the thing that you

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:29.636 A:middle
actually want to do.

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.236 A:middle
And that to me feels like

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:31.746 A:middle
quality.

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:32.966 A:middle
If you're able to achieve that,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.936 A:middle
and people can be very creative,

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
and make beautiful things, or

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.536 A:middle
have special moments through a

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:41.096 A:middle
device -- for example, by taking

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:42.456 A:middle
really good pictures, or sharing

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.166 A:middle
pictures with friends, or

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:45.696 A:middle
finding the right music to play

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.576 A:middle
at the right moment, or, you

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:48.696 A:middle
know, doing fun stuff with

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.876 A:middle
FaceTime, and seeing people on

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:50.746 A:middle
the other side of the world that

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:51.676 A:middle
you haven't seen in a long time

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
-- all of that is very special.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.376 A:middle
And again, none of that is

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:56.686 A:middle
around the UI that you're doing.

00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:58.656 A:middle
None of that is about what

00:05:58.656 --> 00:05:59.986 A:middle
interaction you chose to do that

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
stuff.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
stuff.

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.736 A:middle
That should all be obvious, and

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.856 A:middle
blatantly unspoken, and just

00:06:03.856 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
completely in the background.

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:11.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow. I just love that, that

00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:13.186 A:middle
quality isn't about the UI or

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:15.156 A:middle
interactions, that it's about

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:16.606 A:middle
the moment, the people.

00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:18.356 A:middle
You know, these are the people

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.686 A:middle
that you're designing for, and

00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:21.806 A:middle
you're helping them create

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.896 A:middle
memories and share those moments

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:24.396 A:middle
with others.

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:27.026 A:middle
That is what this is all about.

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:30.036 A:middle
So how do you design for that?

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:32.016 A:middle
Well, I actually asked that

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:32.546 A:middle
question.

00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:34.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's hard.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:37.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [laughter] Yeah.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:39.456 A:middle
I hope you weren't actually

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:40.826 A:middle
hoping for a real answer here.

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:42.386 A:middle
It's definitely very hard, and

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.186 A:middle
we have 55 minutes to dig into

00:06:44.186 --> 00:06:44.486 A:middle
why.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.396 A:middle
So we just heard a ton of

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:50.386 A:middle
answers to this question, what

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:51.426 A:middle
is quality?

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:54.436 A:middle
We heard that it is what we

00:06:54.436 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
agree upon is good, that it's

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.746 A:middle
not random, it's something that

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.746 A:middle
not random, it's something that

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:04.816 A:middle
shows a lot of care and time

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:07.796 A:middle
went into it, and it feels like

00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:08.906 A:middle
somebody has thought of you

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:09.416 A:middle
already.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.216 A:middle
It can also be not painful in

00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.416 A:middle
any way, and it feels state of

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:16.846 A:middle
the art.

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:19.446 A:middle
Quality things make it easier to

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:20.346 A:middle
get things done.

00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:23.596 A:middle
And finally, your concentration

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:24.726 A:middle
goes to the thing that you

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.086 A:middle
really want to do, like sharing

00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:28.666 A:middle
that picture or playing your

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:29.426 A:middle
favorite song.

00:07:29.926 --> 00:07:33.216 A:middle
So by asking about quality, it

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:34.906 A:middle
resulted in many different

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.296 A:middle
answers, but what's so great

00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:39.196 A:middle
about that is that it reflects

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.776 A:middle
what each one of these people

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:41.926 A:middle
truly care about.

00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:44.086 A:middle
And of course, people care about

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.126 A:middle
different things, so it makes

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:47.396 A:middle
complete sense that they all

00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:49.046 A:middle
have different interpretations

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:51.586 A:middle
of what quality is when it

00:07:51.586 --> 00:07:53.166 A:middle
applies to apps and games.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.766 A:middle
So we have a lot to get to

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.206 A:middle
today, but I really want to dig

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.126 A:middle
into just a couple of these

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.126 A:middle
into just a couple of these

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
responses.

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:02.566 A:middle
I think they're all great, but

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:04.096 A:middle
let's just dig into this first

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:04.556 A:middle
one here.

00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:07.386 A:middle
And we're going to listen to the

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.586 A:middle
clip one more time.

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:12.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If something is quality, it

00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.186 A:middle
implies that there is nothing

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:14.856 A:middle
random about it.

00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; During this interview with

00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:19.446 A:middle
Nicole, she explained that not

00:08:19.446 --> 00:08:22.056 A:middle
random to her meant not slapped

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:22.676 A:middle
together.

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:24.436 A:middle
And she used this word

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:25.646 A:middle
"considered."

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:28.356 A:middle
Great designs are considered.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.716 A:middle
They're organized, and they show

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:31.986 A:middle
a thought process has taken

00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:32.456 A:middle
place.

00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:33.876 A:middle
And what I found really

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.285 A:middle
interesting is that she said

00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:36.926 A:middle
that that's really visible to

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.216 A:middle
people, that that visibility of

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
quality in design actually came

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:42.506 A:middle
up in another interview when I

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:43.456 A:middle
was talking with Mike.

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:46.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I guess this is probably a

00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:48.306 A:middle
little cliché sounding, but

00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:49.846 A:middle
it's often the little things

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.106 A:middle
that are the telltale signs

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:52.776 A:middle
about craftsmanship.

00:08:52.996 --> 00:08:54.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, we have to pause right

00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:55.426 A:middle
there because we're about to

00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.136 A:middle
talk about craft in a design

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.266 A:middle
session, and Mike already called

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
it out that it's a little

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
it out that it's a little

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:03.296 A:middle
cliché, but before we listen to

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:05.136 A:middle
the rest of this clip, I need

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.286 A:middle
you to imagine that you're in

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:08.606 A:middle
the audio booth with us.

00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:10.566 A:middle
There's not going to be anything

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.106 A:middle
on screen, so I want you to

00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:14.216 A:middle
really focus on the words that

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:15.346 A:middle
Mike is about to say.

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:19.016 A:middle
Okay, here we go.

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We're sitting in this room

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.666 A:middle
here, and there's these panels

00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:24.586 A:middle
on the wall, and the panels have

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
a little bit of a gap between

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:26.096 A:middle
them.

00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:28.516 A:middle
And we can look at the width of

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:31.376 A:middle
the gap as you look from the top

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:33.186 A:middle
of the wall to the bottom of the

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:33.556 A:middle
wall.

00:09:33.986 --> 00:09:36.126 A:middle
And if there's variable

00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:37.836 A:middle
separation or variable width of

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:39.816 A:middle
that gap, you just get the sense

00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:42.076 A:middle
that it wasn't well crafted.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So really, while Mike

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.836 A:middle
was talking about those variable

00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:50.606 A:middle
widths in the gaps of the panels

00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:52.866 A:middle
in the audio booth, you know, I

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.316 A:middle
understood that he's saying that

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.716 A:middle
those details are visible, and

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.116 A:middle
they matter a lot.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.626 A:middle
And it's through consideration

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.626 A:middle
And it's through consideration

00:10:00.626 --> 00:10:02.836 A:middle
and being really deliberate, and

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:04.286 A:middle
thinking through every single

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.406 A:middle
detail thoughtfully, well, that

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:06.926 A:middle
shows.

00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:09.386 A:middle
And so being really into your

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:11.806 A:middle
craft here is the point because

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:13.426 A:middle
the best things that we love are

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:14.376 A:middle
not random.

00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:15.956 A:middle
They're not slapped together.

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.846 A:middle
They're intentional through

00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:18.786 A:middle
every detail.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.266 A:middle
And if you can do that, that's

00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:21.916 A:middle
quality.

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:25.316 A:middle
So let's explore one more answer

00:10:25.436 --> 00:10:26.816 A:middle
to the question, what is

00:10:26.816 --> 00:10:28.366 A:middle
quality, and listen to the clip

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:28.876 A:middle
again.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The number one thing is just

00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:34.556 A:middle
that something with a lot of

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:37.016 A:middle
care and time went into it.

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:39.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This one in particular really

00:10:39.736 --> 00:10:42.166 A:middle
resonated with me because when

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.386 A:middle
you're writing questions to

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:44.836 A:middle
interviews like, what is

00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:46.736 A:middle
quality, you naturally end up

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.266 A:middle
asking yourself, and to me,

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.406 A:middle
quality is all about care.

00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
So when I heard care connected

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:55.496 A:middle
to quality not only from that

00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:57.006 A:middle
clip we just heard from Travis,

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.306 A:middle
but it also came up in my

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.326 A:middle
interview with Gary.

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.326 A:middle
interview with Gary.

00:11:01.636 --> 00:11:03.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If it's quality, it's better

00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:04.536 A:middle
than something that's not

00:11:04.536 --> 00:11:06.156 A:middle
quality by virtue of someone

00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:07.086 A:middle
caring about it.

00:11:07.796 --> 00:11:10.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. I totally agree that

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:11.976 A:middle
caring makes things better.

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
For example, I care about this

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.676 A:middle
presentation, so, naturally,

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.216 A:middle
it's just a little bit better

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:19.676 A:middle
than if I didn't care about it

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:19.946 A:middle
at all.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.726 A:middle
So now, I feel like we should

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.966 A:middle
dig into, what is care?

00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.306 A:middle
Okay, we're going to stick with

00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:28.896 A:middle
a few interview clips from Gary

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.726 A:middle
so you can hear more of the full

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:31.576 A:middle
conversation.

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.286 A:middle
So I asked him, "How would you

00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:35.716 A:middle
describe care?"

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:40.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Just that someone, excuse my

00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:42.886 A:middle
French, gave a [beep].

00:11:44.096 --> 00:11:44.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [laughter] I'm not sure if

00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:46.436 A:middle
that's a WWDC first, but it's

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:47.016 A:middle
simple.

00:11:47.156 --> 00:11:47.826 A:middle
I like it.

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:49.706 A:middle
[laughs] Really, what he's

00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:52.596 A:middle
saying here is that care is a

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:53.316 A:middle
motivator.

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:56.666 A:middle
So how do you look at care in

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:57.196 A:middle
design?

00:11:57.956 --> 00:12:00.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I look at it from 2 lenses of

00:11:57.956 --> 00:12:00.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I look at it from 2 lenses of

00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
care.

00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:02.056 A:middle
Did I care enough to make it the

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:02.706 A:middle
best it could be?

00:12:02.706 --> 00:12:04.716 A:middle
But do I also care about what

00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:05.816 A:middle
your experience is?

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:07.006 A:middle
Be it you.

00:12:07.006 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
Be it my mum.

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:09.536 A:middle
Be it my next-door neighbor.

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:11.436 A:middle
Be it anybody around the world.

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:12.836 A:middle
You have to kind of, sort of

00:12:12.936 --> 00:12:13.946 A:middle
take yourself out of the

00:12:13.946 --> 00:12:15.266 A:middle
equation, put yourself in their

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:17.206 A:middle
shoes so you can be sure that

00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:18.516 A:middle
their experience is a quality

00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:19.216 A:middle
experience.

00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:20.956 A:middle
So you have to care enough to do

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:21.246 A:middle
that.

00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:22.776 A:middle
It's not just about caring about

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:25.026 A:middle
your own sense of, "Oh, I like

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:27.336 A:middle
my design, and I cared enough to

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.726 A:middle
make it good for me."

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.946 A:middle
It's about it being good for as

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:33.056 A:middle
many people as possible or for

00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:34.326 A:middle
the target audience, if it

00:12:34.326 --> 00:12:35.526 A:middle
happens to be a more narrowly

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:36.176 A:middle
focused thing.

00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:40.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So when I heard this,

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.836 A:middle
I was just, I wanted to know

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.426 A:middle
how, immediately.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:45.276 A:middle
How do you design that

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
experience for others, and how

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:48.076 A:middle
do you know when you've made

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:48.496 A:middle
progress?

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:51.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think sometimes we look at

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:53.256 A:middle
a tangled mess of problems that

00:12:53.256 --> 00:12:55.466 A:middle
we need to solve, and if, at the

00:12:55.466 --> 00:12:57.006 A:middle
end, you can look at the result

00:12:57.006 --> 00:12:58.906 A:middle
and go, that is so much better,

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
and if it came easy, it wouldn't

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
and if it came easy, it wouldn't

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:02.786 A:middle
be as fun, but the fact that you

00:13:02.786 --> 00:13:05.126 A:middle
sweated over it, that you really

00:13:05.126 --> 00:13:06.216 A:middle
worked hard at it, that it gave

00:13:06.216 --> 00:13:07.636 A:middle
you sleepless nights, that you

00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:10.726 A:middle
poured late nights and weekends

00:13:10.726 --> 00:13:12.346 A:middle
into solving those problems,

00:13:12.346 --> 00:13:13.766 A:middle
combined effort, team effort,

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.606 A:middle
the end result is so much more

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:17.266 A:middle
satisfying.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:19.826 A:middle
I love it when we work hard and

00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:22.906 A:middle
get there more than when ideas

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.286 A:middle
just come easily.

00:13:24.806 --> 00:13:25.816 A:middle
I worry that we've actually

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.136 A:middle
missed something by not working

00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:27.436 A:middle
hard.

00:13:27.496 --> 00:13:29.416 A:middle
If it's too easy, we've become

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.076 A:middle
complacent, and I don't think

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.866 A:middle
you get anywhere rewarding

00:13:32.866 --> 00:13:36.256 A:middle
without doing hard work.

00:13:36.456 --> 00:13:37.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I really understood this

00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:40.396 A:middle
point about working hard after

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.806 A:middle
Gary related this to mountain

00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:43.226 A:middle
biking.

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:45.176 A:middle
We talked about this for a

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:46.766 A:middle
while, so I'm just going to

00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:48.126 A:middle
summarize that conversation here

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:48.766 A:middle
for you today.

00:13:49.556 --> 00:13:51.186 A:middle
Essentially, you have to work

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:53.456 A:middle
really hard to get to the top of

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:55.316 A:middle
the mountain, and then you can

00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:56.896 A:middle
have a ton of fun on the

00:13:56.896 --> 00:13:57.286 A:middle
descent.

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.666 A:middle
Now, it's not as much fun if you

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.626 A:middle
just started at the top and went

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.626 A:middle
just started at the top and went

00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:04.276 A:middle
down because it's really all of

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.996 A:middle
that time, and effort, and sweat

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.186 A:middle
that brings you to the top of

00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:10.486 A:middle
the mountain that makes the view

00:14:10.486 --> 00:14:12.176 A:middle
all that more beautiful and

00:14:12.176 --> 00:14:14.326 A:middle
makes the ride down so much more

00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:16.136 A:middle
fun.

00:14:16.366 --> 00:14:21.466 A:middle
So in life, care naturally gives

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:24.216 A:middle
more time and effort because you

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:25.926 A:middle
have a passion to achieve your

00:14:25.926 --> 00:14:27.896 A:middle
goals, and you'll do whatever is

00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:29.066 A:middle
needed to meet your own

00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:29.976 A:middle
expectations.

00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:32.626 A:middle
And yeah, that's totally a lot

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:35.216 A:middle
of work, but that hard work has

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:37.176 A:middle
a payoff, and it's really

00:14:37.246 --> 00:14:37.986 A:middle
satisfying.

00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:40.326 A:middle
And the payoff, well, that's why

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:41.566 A:middle
you did it in the first place,

00:14:41.566 --> 00:14:41.816 A:middle
right?

00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:44.766 A:middle
You have a goal, and you make it

00:14:45.026 --> 00:14:45.226 A:middle
happen.

00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:46.876 A:middle
That's just awesome.

00:14:47.446 --> 00:14:51.076 A:middle
So quality is all about care,

00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:53.456 A:middle
and because you care, you're

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:55.316 A:middle
going to put in that time and

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.846 A:middle
effort to make things great.

00:14:57.306 --> 00:15:00.706 A:middle
And that's just one answer to

00:14:57.306 --> 00:15:00.706 A:middle
And that's just one answer to

00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:02.766 A:middle
the question, what is quality?

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:05.386 A:middle
And because there are so many

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:06.526 A:middle
different interpretations of

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:09.596 A:middle
quality, well, that means it's

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:11.396 A:middle
just really hard to achieve.

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:13.466 A:middle
A little bit later, we're going

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
to get into some techniques to

00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:16.726 A:middle
hopefully help make the process

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:17.626 A:middle
of designing a little bit

00:15:17.656 --> 00:15:18.206 A:middle
easier.

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:20.396 A:middle
But for now, let's just recap

00:15:20.536 --> 00:15:21.196 A:middle
what we've learned.

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:24.966 A:middle
So far, just by asking a few

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:27.056 A:middle
simple questions, we've learned

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.536 A:middle
that quality means something

00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:30.766 A:middle
different to different people,

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:34.896 A:middle
that it's not random -- it is

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:36.486 A:middle
crafted and considered.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:40.196 A:middle
Quality is the result of time,

00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:41.546 A:middle
effort, and care.

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:45.836 A:middle
And it is just hard to achieve,

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:48.916 A:middle
but that's okay.

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.556 A:middle
Quality has many different

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:51.476 A:middle
interpretations.

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:53.236 A:middle
What is yours?

00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:56.036 A:middle
I think this is really important

00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:58.106 A:middle
to ask yourself, what is

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.356 A:middle
quality, and what does it mean

00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.236 A:middle
to you, and what does it mean to

00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.236 A:middle
to you, and what does it mean to

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.436 A:middle
your app or game, because that's

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
going to reveal what you truly

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.716 A:middle
care about, and that's going to

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.066 A:middle
help you focus on what you're

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.566 A:middle
working towards going forward.

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:13.736 A:middle
So let's just pause here for a

00:16:13.736 --> 00:16:15.106 A:middle
moment, and we actually need to

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:16.596 A:middle
go back a bit.

00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:17.716 A:middle
Why does quality matter in the

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:18.356 A:middle
first place?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.096 A:middle
Why are we even talking about it

00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:21.706 A:middle
here at WWDC?

00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.936 A:middle
Well, what's the significance?

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:28.346 A:middle
Let's just ask, why is quality

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:29.196 A:middle
important?

00:16:30.536 --> 00:16:34.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Quality impacts the world

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:36.086 A:middle
that we interact with in so many

00:16:36.086 --> 00:16:37.326 A:middle
different ways all the time

00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:38.736 A:middle
throughout our day.

00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:41.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Travis is totally

00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:41.986 A:middle
right.

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:43.826 A:middle
Throughout our day, there are

00:16:43.916 --> 00:16:47.466 A:middle
things that we eat, drink, wear,

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.186 A:middle
I mean, even the air we breathe.

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.826 A:middle
They all have some level of

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:52.396 A:middle
quality that impacts us.

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:55.706 A:middle
And we expect quality in our

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.686 A:middle
friendships, in our family, in

00:16:57.686 --> 00:16:58.616 A:middle
our relationships.

00:16:59.296 --> 00:17:01.046 A:middle
We seek out people who show us

00:16:59.296 --> 00:17:01.046 A:middle
We seek out people who show us

00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:03.106 A:middle
respect, who care about us and

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:03.786 A:middle
make us feel good.

00:17:03.786 --> 00:17:06.185 A:middle
I mean, nobody keeps around

00:17:06.236 --> 00:17:07.286 A:middle
poor-quality friends.

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:09.786 A:middle
We also expect quality from the

00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:11.516 A:middle
products that we use and the

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:12.986 A:middle
things that we use every day.

00:17:13.715 --> 00:17:15.256 A:middle
We expect them not to break.

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.056 A:middle
And if they do break, well, we

00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:19.286 A:middle
tend to think that they're cheap

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.026 A:middle
and not well made, and we

00:17:22.106 --> 00:17:24.215 A:middle
typically won't buy them again.

00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:27.906 A:middle
So yeah, the concept of quality

00:17:28.706 --> 00:17:30.686 A:middle
impacts our every day, and it's

00:17:30.746 --> 00:17:32.036 A:middle
really in everything.

00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:34.826 A:middle
While it's really wide reaching

00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:36.786 A:middle
and broad, there seems to be

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:39.226 A:middle
something so special about

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:41.156 A:middle
quality, but what is it?

00:17:41.606 --> 00:17:43.176 A:middle
What makes quality special?

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; They say, like, oh, I cooked

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:47.816 A:middle
this with love, and it can just

00:17:47.856 --> 00:17:49.966 A:middle
be eggs or whatever, but it does

00:17:50.096 --> 00:17:52.196 A:middle
taste different, and I think

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:53.326 A:middle
Jessie and I like to think that

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.256 A:middle
whatever we do, that sort of

00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.686 A:middle
love for what we're doing comes

00:17:57.756 --> 00:17:58.516 A:middle
through.

00:17:59.006 --> 00:18:01.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right? I know these two

00:17:59.006 --> 00:18:01.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right? I know these two

00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:02.946 A:middle
ladies absolutely love what they

00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:05.556 A:middle
do, and I know I can feel it

00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:07.046 A:middle
when someone really loves

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:07.676 A:middle
something.

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:10.356 A:middle
And to Elaine's first point, you

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.376 A:middle
know, I think everyone here

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:13.566 A:middle
knows that Mom and Dad's food

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:15.266 A:middle
just tastes a little bit better

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:17.696 A:middle
because it's made with that care

00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:18.336 A:middle
and love.

00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.726 A:middle
So what really Elaine means by

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
this is your intentions are

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:24.706 A:middle
felt.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.296 A:middle
So if your intention is to

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:29.416 A:middle
create something great and you

00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:31.086 A:middle
do everything you need to do to

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:32.716 A:middle
achieve that, people are going

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:33.216 A:middle
to know.

00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:35.586 A:middle
They're going to feel it.

00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:36.856 A:middle
And the reverse is true too.

00:18:37.306 --> 00:18:38.916 A:middle
You know, if you rushed and you

00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:40.206 A:middle
didn't really care about the

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:41.656 A:middle
look of settings in your app UI,

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.476 A:middle
well, it's going to impact the

00:18:44.476 --> 00:18:46.946 A:middle
overall feeling that people have

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.406 A:middle
about your app.

00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:52.016 A:middle
So throughout the course of

00:18:52.016 --> 00:18:53.906 A:middle
conducting these interviews, I

00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:54.986 A:middle
started to see the word

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:57.236 A:middle
"quality" everywhere, like

00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
quality coffee or quality meats.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
quality coffee or quality meats.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:02.826 A:middle
And even one night when I was

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:03.936 A:middle
working really late, and I

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.366 A:middle
ordered a pizza, and the pizza

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.566 A:middle
box said, "Our commitment is

00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:08.286 A:middle
quality."

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:11.106 A:middle
[laughs] So I see the word

00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:12.346 A:middle
everywhere now.

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:14.516 A:middle
It's really pervasive, from

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:16.746 A:middle
signs to badges, to labels.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.246 A:middle
So I brought this up in a few of

00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:21.106 A:middle
the interviews, not because I

00:19:21.106 --> 00:19:22.236 A:middle
wanted to know what people

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.866 A:middle
thought of labeling, but,

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:26.886 A:middle
instead, to ask, why do we tend

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:28.866 A:middle
to be drawn towards things that

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:29.606 A:middle
are quality?

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, survival instinct at

00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:34.556 A:middle
its root.

00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:36.536 A:middle
On a more deep level, I guess,

00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
why do we desire quality?

00:19:38.296 --> 00:19:39.826 A:middle
We desire quality because we

00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:40.406 A:middle
want to live.

00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:44.096 A:middle
And a good survival strategy for

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:47.626 A:middle
living is to put things into our

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:50.296 A:middle
body, to eat things, or to wear

00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:52.066 A:middle
things, or to drive in things,

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.396 A:middle
or to live in things that are

00:19:54.656 --> 00:19:56.936 A:middle
safe and have been well

00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:59.036 A:middle
constructed so they aren't going

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.936 A:middle
to cause us bodily harm.

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.936 A:middle
to cause us bodily harm.

00:20:01.616 --> 00:20:04.906 A:middle
And so I think purely on a

00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:07.236 A:middle
survival level, quality is a

00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.986 A:middle
very important concept for us.

00:20:08.986 --> 00:20:10.376 A:middle
It's a very important attribute

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.666 A:middle
that we seek in everything.

00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Mike explained a bit further

00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:17.336 A:middle
during this interview.

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:18.996 A:middle
We were talking about this

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:22.356 A:middle
fictitious butcher shop, and if

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:24.296 A:middle
we were in this shop, quality

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:25.886 A:middle
would be communicated not only

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:28.266 A:middle
by the products itself, but also

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:30.706 A:middle
the shop being really clean and

00:20:30.706 --> 00:20:31.946 A:middle
interacting with the really nice

00:20:32.076 --> 00:20:33.146 A:middle
people that work there.

00:20:34.236 --> 00:20:36.246 A:middle
Every facet of the entire

00:20:36.246 --> 00:20:38.776 A:middle
experience would meet your

00:20:38.776 --> 00:20:40.436 A:middle
expectations, [laughs] and it

00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:42.506 A:middle
would also be connected to that

00:20:42.646 --> 00:20:44.216 A:middle
proposition of quality.

00:20:44.796 --> 00:20:48.266 A:middle
And that evokes trust.

00:20:49.546 --> 00:20:51.296 A:middle
Trust comes from products

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.906 A:middle
upholding their promise, and

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:56.046 A:middle
that quality experience is far

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
more important than any label

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
because I am definitely not

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
because I am definitely not

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.986 A:middle
suggesting that you add a label

00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:04.996 A:middle
to your apps because you

00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
[laughs] definitely don't need

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:07.426 A:middle
to.

00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:10.046 A:middle
Every facet of your app

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.496 A:middle
experience, from the screenshots

00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:14.006 A:middle
on the App Store to the

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.596 A:middle
description, to how you respond

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:19.196 A:middle
to customer reviews, all through

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:21.716 A:middle
to your app's interface, these

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:23.396 A:middle
experiences, these interactions

00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:25.296 A:middle
that you have with people, that

00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:27.566 A:middle
communicates the quality about

00:21:27.566 --> 00:21:28.996 A:middle
your app or your game.

00:21:29.936 --> 00:21:31.556 A:middle
And you don't want a label

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.166 A:middle
anyway.

00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:33.316 A:middle
Why?

00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:37.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In a way, it's like saying

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:38.226 A:middle
you're cool.

00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:41.476 A:middle
Like, being cool doesn't involve

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:42.786 A:middle
saying you're cool.

00:21:43.326 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
[laughs] And, you know, you only

00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:48.096 A:middle
say that someone else is cool.

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:49.986 A:middle
It's only something which can be

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:51.626 A:middle
sort of determined by an outside

00:21:51.626 --> 00:21:52.486 A:middle
party, in a way.

00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:56.146 A:middle
And even then, there's a certain

00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:57.196 A:middle
context where it feels more

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.316 A:middle
appropriate than others.

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:59.396 A:middle
Like, if we're talking about

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:01.976 A:middle
Thelonious Monk and we're just

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:01.976 A:middle
Thelonious Monk and we're just

00:22:01.976 --> 00:22:03.576 A:middle
talking about jazz in the '50's,

00:22:03.676 --> 00:22:04.806 A:middle
like, that's cool.

00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:06.546 A:middle
That's the birth of cool, right.

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:08.476 A:middle
[laughs] That's where it's,

00:22:08.476 --> 00:22:10.296 A:middle
like, totally appropriate to use

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:13.586 A:middle
that kind of term, but that's an

00:22:13.586 --> 00:22:14.776 A:middle
earned coolness.

00:22:15.066 --> 00:22:17.146 A:middle
And so quality has to be earned.

00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:19.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think Mike makes a really

00:22:19.926 --> 00:22:20.386 A:middle
good point.

00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:24.126 A:middle
So the significance of quality

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:24.916 A:middle
is massive.

00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:27.416 A:middle
As we heard, it impacts our

00:22:27.466 --> 00:22:30.356 A:middle
every day, it can be felt, and

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:32.306 A:middle
it evokes trust in the people

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.906 A:middle
that are using your app.

00:22:35.196 --> 00:22:35.686 A:middle
All right.

00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.046 A:middle
Now, everyone I talked to

00:22:39.106 --> 00:22:39.996 A:middle
throughout these interviews,

00:22:40.076 --> 00:22:42.066 A:middle
they all have a passion for

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:43.986 A:middle
excellence, so we're going to

00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:45.606 A:middle
talk about four design

00:22:45.866 --> 00:22:47.706 A:middle
aspirations, and these four

00:22:47.706 --> 00:22:49.366 A:middle
aspirations really stood out to

00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:51.116 A:middle
me because, well, they seemed

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.306 A:middle
just so incredibly elusive and

00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:54.186 A:middle
hard to achieve.

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:57.776 A:middle
But these designers use them as

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.046 A:middle
motivation to strive for quality

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.046 A:middle
motivation to strive for quality

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.866 A:middle
in their work, and these

00:23:01.866 --> 00:23:04.116 A:middle
aspirations are to design things

00:23:04.376 --> 00:23:07.846 A:middle
that are simple, stunning,

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:12.746 A:middle
timeless, and leave a positive

00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:13.916 A:middle
impact on people's lives.

00:23:14.996 --> 00:23:16.326 A:middle
So we're going to dig into each

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:18.246 A:middle
one of these to discover why

00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:20.536 A:middle
they're important and also how

00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:22.066 A:middle
they provide motivation to

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:23.236 A:middle
create great design.

00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:25.246 A:middle
All right.

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:27.586 A:middle
Let's start with simplicity.

00:23:27.846 --> 00:23:30.846 A:middle
This came up in response to this

00:23:30.896 --> 00:23:33.306 A:middle
question: What makes a great

00:23:33.376 --> 00:23:33.576 A:middle
app?

00:23:35.446 --> 00:23:36.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's simple.

00:23:36.596 --> 00:23:38.566 A:middle
It doesn't try to do more than

00:23:38.566 --> 00:23:39.466 A:middle
it needs to do.

00:23:39.866 --> 00:23:40.996 A:middle
And what it does, it does it

00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:41.676 A:middle
really well.

00:23:41.676 --> 00:23:44.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I

00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:45.696 A:middle
have heard that a lot.

00:23:46.546 --> 00:23:47.896 A:middle
[laughs] So I'm sure you've

00:23:47.896 --> 00:23:48.846 A:middle
heard it before too.

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:51.246 A:middle
But there's got to be a reason

00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
why that phrase is on repeat,

00:23:53.926 --> 00:23:56.036 A:middle
and I was really thinking about

00:23:56.036 --> 00:23:57.166 A:middle
this after the interview.

00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:59.686 A:middle
You know, why should apps be

00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:01.106 A:middle
simple, and why is that a good

00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:01.106 A:middle
simple, and why is that a good

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:01.476 A:middle
thing?

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:03.926 A:middle
Well, it finally clicked for me

00:24:03.926 --> 00:24:05.176 A:middle
one day after work.

00:24:06.326 --> 00:24:08.006 A:middle
I got home, I needed to cook

00:24:08.006 --> 00:24:09.736 A:middle
some dinner, and I needed an app

00:24:10.026 --> 00:24:11.856 A:middle
to help me with a recipe, to not

00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:13.306 A:middle
make cooking any harder than it

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:13.966 A:middle
already is.

00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:15.806 A:middle
And as soon as I was home, I

00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:18.156 A:middle
remembered that I needed to go

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.166 A:middle
ahead and put, book pet care for

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:21.936 A:middle
my two dogs because I'm going on

00:24:21.936 --> 00:24:22.846 A:middle
vacation after WWDC.

00:24:22.846 --> 00:24:23.786 A:middle
Aw, aren't they cute?

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:28.176 A:middle
[laughs] Okay, we have to stop

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.066 A:middle
before I get distracted.

00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:31.136 A:middle
We're talking about two tasks

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:34.176 A:middle
here, cooking dinner and pet

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:34.476 A:middle
care.

00:24:35.636 --> 00:24:36.906 A:middle
Why do the apps that help me

00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:38.166 A:middle
with those, why do they need to

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:38.826 A:middle
be simple?

00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:41.546 A:middle
Well, it's because I don't go

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.746 A:middle
into them all the time, so they

00:24:43.746 --> 00:24:44.886 A:middle
need to be instantly

00:24:44.886 --> 00:24:46.546 A:middle
understandable, as if I already

00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:47.526 A:middle
know how to use them.

00:24:47.996 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
So familiar navigation and

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:50.616 A:middle
gestures really help with that.

00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:53.196 A:middle
You know, the goal is launch the

00:24:53.196 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
app, I totally get it, and I can

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:56.466 A:middle
get the task done.

00:24:57.466 --> 00:24:58.766 A:middle
But why else should they be

00:24:58.766 --> 00:24:59.206 A:middle
simple?

00:25:00.286 --> 00:25:02.696 A:middle
Well, it could be a good day or

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:04.626 A:middle
a bad day, but I'm using these

00:25:04.626 --> 00:25:07.266 A:middle
apps in real life, and that's

00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:08.526 A:middle
where all of my mental energy

00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
should be, not wasted on a

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:13.066 A:middle
confusing app UI, interaction,

00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:14.086 A:middle
or interface.

00:25:14.756 --> 00:25:17.116 A:middle
Apps should not be a burden, and

00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:18.696 A:middle
it's a lot easier to get back to

00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:20.126 A:middle
real life when they're simple.

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.986 A:middle
So how would you describe

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:25.016 A:middle
simplicity in apps and games?

00:25:25.096 --> 00:25:27.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It just has to work.

00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:31.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. It just has to work

00:25:31.056 --> 00:25:32.346 A:middle
for the people that are using

00:25:32.346 --> 00:25:32.636 A:middle
it.

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:34.056 A:middle
But there's actually something

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.636 A:middle
else here.

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:36.876 A:middle
You don't want people to feel

00:25:36.876 --> 00:25:37.806 A:middle
distracted.

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:40.756 A:middle
Simple, easy-to-understand apps

00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:43.096 A:middle
that just work, well, they help

00:25:43.136 --> 00:25:44.276 A:middle
keep people focused.

00:25:45.236 --> 00:25:46.566 A:middle
I know for me, I can get really

00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:47.776 A:middle
easily overwhelmed if

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.236 A:middle
something's out of place.

00:25:49.276 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
It can just take me out of that

00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:52.246 A:middle
experience, and that makes

00:25:52.316 --> 00:25:53.956 A:middle
getting the task done even

00:25:53.956 --> 00:25:54.426 A:middle
harder.

00:25:54.426 --> 00:25:56.466 A:middle
I was actually talking to Jessie

00:25:56.466 --> 00:25:58.706 A:middle
about this, and I asked her,

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
what does she look for in great

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
what does she look for in great

00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
apps?

00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:04.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Make my life feel a little

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:06.396 A:middle
bit easier or make my life feel

00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:08.026 A:middle
a little bit nicer or more

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:08.816 A:middle
luxurious.

00:26:09.616 --> 00:26:11.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think that is just spot on.

00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:13.946 A:middle
Make my life feel a little bit

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:17.166 A:middle
easier by being simple, focused,

00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:20.086 A:middle
instantly understandable, and

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:22.936 A:middle
just do one thing really, really

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:23.076 A:middle
well.

00:26:23.996 --> 00:26:24.926 A:middle
That is the goal.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:29.206 A:middle
All right, this next aspiration

00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
is to be stunning, and this came

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:32.716 A:middle
up when I was talking to

00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:33.406 A:middle
Caroline.

00:26:33.816 --> 00:26:36.626 A:middle
I asked her, "What communicates

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:38.466 A:middle
great visual design?"

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:41.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Just that polish.

00:26:42.206 --> 00:26:43.646 A:middle
Does it look great?

00:26:43.646 --> 00:26:44.866 A:middle
Does it look stunning?

00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:46.826 A:middle
And then, the other level of

00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:48.926 A:middle
polish, on a different kind of

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.516 A:middle
app, like a game or something,

00:26:50.516 --> 00:26:52.716 A:middle
to me is making it feel

00:26:52.836 --> 00:26:54.806 A:middle
beautiful as an experience, like

00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:56.296 A:middle
it feels like a work of art.

00:26:57.626 --> 00:26:58.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
So we talked a little bit

00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
So we talked a little bit

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:02.536 A:middle
further about this, and Caroline

00:27:02.536 --> 00:27:04.656 A:middle
explained that what she means by

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:07.636 A:middle
polish is things lining up just

00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:08.986 A:middle
the way you intend them to be,

00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.956 A:middle
including how it feels.

00:27:10.956 --> 00:27:12.346 A:middle
You know, swipe animations

00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:14.006 A:middle
lining right up with those swipe

00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:14.596 A:middle
gestures.

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.036 A:middle
And the best apps appear

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:18.916 A:middle
visually perfect, and that is

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:20.346 A:middle
just totally remarkable.

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:22.506 A:middle
And she also mentioned games.

00:27:23.216 --> 00:27:25.676 A:middle
Games should absolutely aspire

00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:26.406 A:middle
to be stunning.

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:29.706 A:middle
Games are a perfect escape from

00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:32.316 A:middle
this world into a different one.

00:27:32.896 --> 00:27:34.656 A:middle
And they accomplish this through

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:36.586 A:middle
stunning, immersive visuals.

00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:39.466 A:middle
I mean, I love TV and movies,

00:27:39.546 --> 00:27:41.056 A:middle
but that's a really passive

00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:41.626 A:middle
escape.

00:27:42.186 --> 00:27:43.416 A:middle
In games, well, they're an

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.986 A:middle
active one, and that's why I

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:45.586 A:middle
love them.

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:48.036 A:middle
But there is one essential thing

00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:49.896 A:middle
that all games must do.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.386 A:middle
They must teach you, the player,

00:27:53.626 --> 00:27:53.926 A:middle
the rules.

00:27:53.926 --> 00:27:56.086 A:middle
And this is really a first

00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:57.536 A:middle
impression that people have of a

00:27:57.536 --> 00:27:59.996 A:middle
lot of games, so it makes me

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.426 A:middle
really sad when games make a bad

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.426 A:middle
really sad when games make a bad

00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:04.746 A:middle
first impression because when

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:06.946 A:middle
I'm trying to learn, well, the

00:28:06.946 --> 00:28:08.576 A:middle
rules feel slapped together,

00:28:09.066 --> 00:28:11.076 A:middle
added on last minute, or it just

00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:12.316 A:middle
doesn't feel a part of the

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:13.086 A:middle
game's world.

00:28:13.086 --> 00:28:16.706 A:middle
So I decided to ask Sam, who's

00:28:16.706 --> 00:28:18.136 A:middle
working on an upcoming game

00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:20.416 A:middle
called Where Cards Fall, "How do

00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:22.036 A:middle
you learn the rules of the game

00:28:22.346 --> 00:28:24.116 A:middle
all while staying in the game's

00:28:24.116 --> 00:28:24.436 A:middle
world?"

00:28:24.926 --> 00:28:27.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; With games in particular,

00:28:27.326 --> 00:28:29.066 A:middle
there's a real joy that can come

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:31.196 A:middle
from discovering what they can

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:33.126 A:middle
do and learning for yourself.

00:28:33.186 --> 00:28:34.916 A:middle
People tend to remember things

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.206 A:middle
the best when they experience

00:28:37.206 --> 00:28:38.636 A:middle
them themselves, when they learn

00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:40.496 A:middle
them through some sort of active

00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:41.526 A:middle
discovery.

00:28:41.526 --> 00:28:43.996 A:middle
So if we give them too much at

00:28:43.996 --> 00:28:45.556 A:middle
the beginning, we're robbing

00:28:45.556 --> 00:28:47.296 A:middle
them of that chance to reward

00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:48.386 A:middle
their own curiosity.

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:49.926 A:middle
So we always want to make sure

00:28:49.986 --> 00:28:51.446 A:middle
that they stay curious, that

00:28:51.446 --> 00:28:52.586 A:middle
they stay interested throughout

00:28:52.586 --> 00:28:54.976 A:middle
the entire experience, and that

00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:56.046 A:middle
they have a lot of different

00:28:56.046 --> 00:28:57.176 A:middle
moments where they can be

00:28:57.176 --> 00:28:58.566 A:middle
rewarded for trying something.

00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:00.086 A:middle
And when they try something and

00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:00.086 A:middle
And when they try something and

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
they discover something for the

00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
first time, they definitely

00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:03.806 A:middle
won't forget it.

00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:04.886 A:middle
But if we throw up like a

00:29:04.886 --> 00:29:06.746 A:middle
tooltip or some way of just

00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:08.676 A:middle
making sure that we as the game

00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:09.746 A:middle
designers are comfortable

00:29:09.746 --> 00:29:10.426 A:middle
knowing that they know

00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:12.206 A:middle
something, there's a pretty good

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.066 A:middle
chance that they'll forget it

00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:14.676 A:middle
later on since they didn't go

00:29:14.676 --> 00:29:15.676 A:middle
through the process of learning

00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:15.976 A:middle
it themselves.

00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:21.826 A:middle
So when I go into a game for the

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.476 A:middle
first time, I want to learn how

00:29:24.476 --> 00:29:26.776 A:middle
to navigate the world, if it

00:29:26.776 --> 00:29:29.296 A:middle
takes place in a world, as

00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:30.496 A:middle
quickly as possible or just how

00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:31.656 A:middle
to understand the rules of the

00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:33.956 A:middle
game as quickly as possible, but

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.986 A:middle
not so quickly that I'm kind of

00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:37.266 A:middle
robbed of my curiosity to

00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:38.446 A:middle
explore them a little bit

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:38.896 A:middle
further.

00:29:39.446 --> 00:29:42.546 A:middle
So I tend to get a sense for

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:44.646 A:middle
what the game is, and if the

00:29:44.646 --> 00:29:46.466 A:middle
game continues to surprise me,

00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:48.716 A:middle
I'll make it through to the

00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:50.016 A:middle
finish line.

00:29:51.286 --> 00:29:53.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow, that was learning the

00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:55.436 A:middle
rules in Where Cards Fall, and

00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:57.156 A:middle
that definitely feels a part of

00:29:57.156 --> 00:29:59.626 A:middle
the game's world, and I think

00:29:59.626 --> 00:30:01.136 A:middle
everyone can learn from what Sam

00:29:59.626 --> 00:30:01.136 A:middle
everyone can learn from what Sam

00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:03.266 A:middle
said about active discovery.

00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:05.256 A:middle
And this is not just for games.

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
Active discovery is so much

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:09.696 A:middle
better than reading tooltips or

00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:12.106 A:middle
chasing a pointing arrow, and to

00:30:12.196 --> 00:30:14.826 A:middle
Sam's point, being told isn't as

00:30:14.826 --> 00:30:17.206 A:middle
much fun or, frankly, effective

00:30:17.436 --> 00:30:19.016 A:middle
as discovering something for

00:30:19.016 --> 00:30:19.516 A:middle
yourself.

00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
It's kind of like being told

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:24.876 A:middle
about a vacation versus being on

00:30:24.876 --> 00:30:25.906 A:middle
that vacation yourself.

00:30:26.706 --> 00:30:28.246 A:middle
It's way more fun, and you're

00:30:28.246 --> 00:30:29.666 A:middle
just going to remember it better

00:30:29.666 --> 00:30:31.416 A:middle
if you actually go through that

00:30:31.416 --> 00:30:32.116 A:middle
experience.

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:35.106 A:middle
So whether you're creating an

00:30:35.106 --> 00:30:38.176 A:middle
app or a game, aspire to be

00:30:38.176 --> 00:30:38.776 A:middle
stunning.

00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:41.136 A:middle
Create beautiful experiences,

00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:43.696 A:middle
polish your visual design so it

00:30:43.696 --> 00:30:45.856 A:middle
looks and feels just a part of

00:30:45.856 --> 00:30:47.436 A:middle
your app or game's world.

00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:49.816 A:middle
Okay, timeless.

00:30:51.236 --> 00:30:54.156 A:middle
This has been on my mind since

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:55.586 A:middle
talking with Hugo, a sound

00:30:55.586 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
designer.

00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:59.136 A:middle
Most of you will recognize this.

00:31:00.516 --> 00:31:10.196 A:middle
[ Ringtone ]

00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:11.876 A:middle
I'm always looking for where

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.296 A:middle
that phone is.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.926 A:middle
But what reminded me of this

00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:17.726 A:middle
ringtone was this part of the

00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:18.376 A:middle
interview.

00:31:18.976 --> 00:31:23.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If we create a ringtone for

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:27.126 A:middle
the new iPhone, then we don't

00:31:27.126 --> 00:31:28.916 A:middle
want it to sound dated after a

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:29.776 A:middle
year, of course.

00:31:29.776 --> 00:31:31.766 A:middle
It should still be a great

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:34.606 A:middle
ringtone after 5 years, and

00:31:34.606 --> 00:31:35.946 A:middle
maybe people will still remember

00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:36.936 A:middle
it after 10 years.

00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:41.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It was actually this section

00:31:41.696 --> 00:31:43.456 A:middle
of the quote that really made me

00:31:43.576 --> 00:31:45.116 A:middle
think of timelessness.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:47.486 A:middle
You know, it makes sense for a

00:31:47.486 --> 00:31:49.126 A:middle
ringtone not to want to sound

00:31:49.126 --> 00:31:51.706 A:middle
dated, but this could also apply

00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:53.246 A:middle
to your visual and interaction

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:54.256 A:middle
design too.

00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
Hugo used this word "durability"

00:31:57.986 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
to describe quality during our

00:31:57.986 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
to describe quality during our

00:32:00.006 --> 00:32:01.686 A:middle
interview, and I think that's

00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:02.476 A:middle
really great.

00:32:03.256 --> 00:32:04.996 A:middle
If we all aspire to create

00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:06.246 A:middle
designs that are just a little

00:32:06.246 --> 00:32:08.556 A:middle
bit longer lasting, it not only

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:10.036 A:middle
would save us time and effort

00:32:10.036 --> 00:32:12.596 A:middle
now, but it would put us into

00:32:12.596 --> 00:32:14.536 A:middle
the right mindset to provide

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:15.806 A:middle
something that we create with

00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:20.916 A:middle
the opportunity to be timeless.

00:32:21.036 --> 00:32:23.466 A:middle
This final aspiration really had

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:25.536 A:middle
an impact on me, and it came

00:32:25.536 --> 00:32:27.166 A:middle
from my colleague Doug when I

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:29.376 A:middle
asked him, "What makes great app

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:29.976 A:middle
experiences?"

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:34.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When I think of, like, great

00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:36.366 A:middle
app experiences and things that

00:32:36.446 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
kind of provide something unique

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:40.676 A:middle
and valuable to users, I think a

00:32:40.676 --> 00:32:43.556 A:middle
lot of it is the substantial

00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:45.496 A:middle
kind of positive effect that it

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:47.546 A:middle
has on the user's life.

00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:51.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Doug, you nailed it.

00:32:51.526 --> 00:32:53.486 A:middle
Yes, absolutely, apps should

00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:54.956 A:middle
provide something unique and

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:57.366 A:middle
valuable, but, actually, it was

00:32:57.366 --> 00:32:58.946 A:middle
this part, the positive effect,

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
that really resonated with me.

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
that really resonated with me.

00:33:01.806 --> 00:33:03.966 A:middle
It made me reassess the apps and

00:33:03.966 --> 00:33:04.916 A:middle
games on my phone.

00:33:05.476 --> 00:33:06.726 A:middle
After this interview, I

00:33:06.726 --> 00:33:08.786 A:middle
literally scrolled through all

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:10.876 A:middle
of my apps, and I thought, which

00:33:10.876 --> 00:33:13.136 A:middle
ones have a positive effect on

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:14.286 A:middle
my life?

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:17.036 A:middle
You know, wouldn't it be great

00:33:17.546 --> 00:33:19.346 A:middle
if life just had a little more

00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:20.226 A:middle
positivity?

00:33:21.616 --> 00:33:24.396 A:middle
So next time you design, strive

00:33:24.396 --> 00:33:26.676 A:middle
for simplicity because real life

00:33:26.876 --> 00:33:28.086 A:middle
if where we need to be spending

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:28.736 A:middle
our energy.

00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:32.826 A:middle
Aspire to be stunning because we

00:33:32.826 --> 00:33:34.896 A:middle
all need a break from chaos, and

00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:36.676 A:middle
it's really nice to escape and

00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:38.056 A:middle
experience something beautiful.

00:33:38.566 --> 00:33:41.016 A:middle
Design to be timeless.

00:33:41.776 --> 00:33:43.126 A:middle
Think about how your designs can

00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:45.586 A:middle
be good now but also years from

00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:47.826 A:middle
now because we could all design

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:49.666 A:middle
to be a little less trendy and

00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:51.006 A:middle
definitely more durable.

00:33:51.606 --> 00:33:54.806 A:middle
And finally, think about how you

00:33:54.806 --> 00:33:56.456 A:middle
could have a positive impact on

00:33:56.456 --> 00:33:56.916 A:middle
people's lives.

00:33:58.196 --> 00:33:59.456 A:middle
And, you know, this can manifest

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.216 A:middle
itself in really different ways

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.216 A:middle
itself in really different ways

00:34:01.216 --> 00:34:02.896 A:middle
depending on your app.

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:04.166 A:middle
It could be maybe that

00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:05.586 A:middle
positivity is being really

00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:07.566 A:middle
accurate, or maybe it's just

00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:08.706 A:middle
being super entertaining.

00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:10.806 A:middle
Maybe it's just making someone's

00:34:10.806 --> 00:34:13.216 A:middle
life or day feel a little bit

00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:13.656 A:middle
easier.

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:16.466 A:middle
I hope that you found some of

00:34:16.466 --> 00:34:17.396 A:middle
these thoughts to be as

00:34:17.396 --> 00:34:18.706 A:middle
inspiring as I did.

00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:21.186 A:middle
I'm sure you're thinking now,

00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:22.735 A:middle
though, well, sure, this has

00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:24.545 A:middle
been mildly inspiring and

00:34:24.636 --> 00:34:26.706 A:middle
somewhat educational, but what

00:34:26.706 --> 00:34:27.585 A:middle
can I do?

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:29.196 A:middle
What can I actually take away

00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:30.476 A:middle
and apply to my work?

00:34:30.476 --> 00:34:33.186 A:middle
Well, I wanted to know that too.

00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:35.326 A:middle
After talking with so many

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:36.536 A:middle
different people from different

00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:38.545 A:middle
backgrounds, I wanted to know

00:34:38.646 --> 00:34:40.426 A:middle
what they learned -- what they

00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:42.045 A:middle
learned on the job through their

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:43.036 A:middle
experiences.

00:34:43.576 --> 00:34:44.476 A:middle
So through a series of

00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:46.456 A:middle
questions, I uncovered a few

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.616 A:middle
tips and techniques that these

00:34:48.616 --> 00:34:50.755 A:middle
designers use regularly when

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:51.306 A:middle
designing.

00:34:52.005 --> 00:34:53.295 A:middle
And something important to

00:34:53.295 --> 00:34:54.786 A:middle
mention about design before we

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:58.726 A:middle
get started is, yes, design is

00:34:58.756 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
hard because nobody sets out to

00:34:58.756 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
hard because nobody sets out to

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:02.196 A:middle
create a bad app.

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:04.866 A:middle
Making great designs is what we

00:35:04.946 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
all strive for, but let's be

00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:08.206 A:middle
honest.

00:35:08.816 --> 00:35:11.136 A:middle
We don't always achieve it, and

00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.956 A:middle
that's okay because we keep

00:35:12.956 --> 00:35:15.296 A:middle
trying and we learn a lot along

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:15.516 A:middle
the way.

00:35:16.796 --> 00:35:19.756 A:middle
Okay, let's go ahead and hear

00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:21.546 A:middle
this first technique, and it

00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:22.576 A:middle
really surprised me.

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:24.196 A:middle
It came up when I was talking

00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:25.166 A:middle
with Loic [phonetic], a type

00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:27.586 A:middle
designer, and I asked him, "What

00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:29.986 A:middle
helps you with your work?"

00:35:30.776 --> 00:35:32.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So in the case of type

00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:33.236 A:middle
design, for instance, we've

00:35:33.796 --> 00:35:35.656 A:middle
developed all kinds of little

00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:36.906 A:middle
drawing tricks.

00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:38.296 A:middle
In type design especially,

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:41.036 A:middle
subjectiveness I feel can

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:42.496 A:middle
[inaudible] even more than in

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:44.106 A:middle
other aspects of design because

00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
we go to the depth of how the

00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:48.196 A:middle
particular curve of, on the

00:35:48.196 --> 00:35:50.366 A:middle
shoulder of a lowercase m is,

00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:50.916 A:middle
for instance.

00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:52.566 A:middle
And we can have a 10-minute

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:54.906 A:middle
discussion only on that.

00:35:55.046 --> 00:35:56.496 A:middle
But the difficult part is

00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.596 A:middle
describing what you see in words

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.286 A:middle
that the other person is going

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.286 A:middle
that the other person is going

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:03.006 A:middle
to understand the way you mean

00:36:03.006 --> 00:36:05.036 A:middle
it, and that's very difficult

00:36:05.036 --> 00:36:06.106 A:middle
when you're talking about shape.

00:36:06.696 --> 00:36:08.976 A:middle
But one way we started doing

00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.266 A:middle
that with some of my colleagues

00:36:10.266 --> 00:36:12.386 A:middle
was basically redrawing the

00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:14.076 A:middle
shape we're looking at with

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.566 A:middle
exaggerated features, where we

00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:18.406 A:middle
basically kind of make a

00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:19.676 A:middle
caricature of what we are

00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:20.156 A:middle
seeing.

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:22.916 A:middle
So if I'm pushing what I'm

00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:25.366 A:middle
seeing to the extreme of why I

00:36:25.476 --> 00:36:27.966 A:middle
find it ugly or uncomfortable,

00:36:28.256 --> 00:36:30.456 A:middle
it's because it feels like that

00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:30.696 A:middle
to me.

00:36:31.536 --> 00:36:32.616 A:middle
And through that drawing,

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:33.876 A:middle
usually the other people can

00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:36.076 A:middle
start seeing that much more

00:36:36.076 --> 00:36:38.506 A:middle
toned down but existing feature

00:36:38.506 --> 00:36:40.116 A:middle
of the design that they weren't

00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
necessarily perceiving before

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:42.906 A:middle
because that's not what they

00:36:42.906 --> 00:36:44.386 A:middle
were looking at.

00:36:44.486 --> 00:36:46.086 A:middle
So it is about trying to make

00:36:46.086 --> 00:36:48.466 A:middle
people see the world through

00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:50.416 A:middle
your eyes and the other way

00:36:50.476 --> 00:36:52.206 A:middle
around, like gaining the ability

00:36:52.206 --> 00:36:53.206 A:middle
to see the world through their

00:36:53.206 --> 00:36:55.686 A:middle
eyes, so that you can then find

00:36:55.686 --> 00:36:56.926 A:middle
that third place that is

00:36:56.926 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
actually the joint gaze that you

00:36:56.926 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
actually the joint gaze that you

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:01.696 A:middle
have on the world.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.916 A:middle
And that's the, that I think to

00:37:04.916 --> 00:37:07.016 A:middle
me is the key of a successful

00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.756 A:middle
collaboration in design is

00:37:08.756 --> 00:37:13.656 A:middle
finding that place.

00:37:13.886 --> 00:37:15.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow. Before we even dig into

00:37:15.946 --> 00:37:17.826 A:middle
this technique, have you thought

00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:19.076 A:middle
about type design?

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:20.896 A:middle
I mean, every single letter that

00:37:20.956 --> 00:37:22.956 A:middle
you text, and email, and that

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:24.696 A:middle
you read, that's been designed,

00:37:25.546 --> 00:37:27.666 A:middle
and type designers care so much

00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:29.336 A:middle
about detail that they've

00:37:29.336 --> 00:37:31.176 A:middle
invented ways to communicate

00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:33.256 A:middle
about shape when there are no

00:37:33.256 --> 00:37:33.696 A:middle
words.

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:35.736 A:middle
That's just so cool.

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.446 A:middle
So to Loic's point, when you're

00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:40.226 A:middle
designing for others, it's

00:37:40.366 --> 00:37:42.016 A:middle
really necessary to see the

00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:44.046 A:middle
world through their eyes, and

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.546 A:middle
this technique helps achieve

00:37:46.596 --> 00:37:46.686 A:middle
that.

00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:50.256 A:middle
So draw caricatures and ask

00:37:50.256 --> 00:37:51.456 A:middle
others to do the same.

00:37:52.196 --> 00:37:53.416 A:middle
It's really the importance of

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:54.636 A:middle
putting yourself in others'

00:37:54.636 --> 00:37:56.276 A:middle
shoes because you can better

00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:57.496 A:middle
understand their world.

00:37:58.126 --> 00:37:59.686 A:middle
And this is a great tool for

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:01.786 A:middle
communication if words are not

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:01.786 A:middle
communication if words are not

00:38:01.866 --> 00:38:03.306 A:middle
doing it, and it'll help you

00:38:03.306 --> 00:38:04.546 A:middle
understand what others are

00:38:04.546 --> 00:38:04.986 A:middle
seeing.

00:38:05.526 --> 00:38:08.416 A:middle
This next technique is going to

00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:10.236 A:middle
be unveiled through a story.

00:38:10.916 --> 00:38:13.236 A:middle
Actually, even better, a first

00:38:13.446 --> 00:38:14.426 A:middle
job story.

00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:17.226 A:middle
Because you learn a lot on your

00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:19.286 A:middle
first job, and they have a huge

00:38:19.286 --> 00:38:19.616 A:middle
impact.

00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:22.356 A:middle
So I asked my colleague Doug

00:38:22.496 --> 00:38:24.106 A:middle
what he learned at his first

00:38:24.286 --> 00:38:24.946 A:middle
design job.

00:38:25.526 --> 00:38:30.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One of the real kind of ahas

00:38:30.296 --> 00:38:33.406 A:middle
for me was a question that I got

00:38:33.406 --> 00:38:35.196 A:middle
at the Tech Museum from the Head

00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:37.546 A:middle
of Design that was essentially,

00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:39.056 A:middle
why is this good?

00:38:39.566 --> 00:38:41.166 A:middle
Why is this thing that you just

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:42.376 A:middle
gave me good?

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:45.486 A:middle
And, you know, my initial

00:38:45.486 --> 00:38:47.276 A:middle
reaction was, well, because I

00:38:47.346 --> 00:38:49.366 A:middle
think this will be easy for

00:38:49.366 --> 00:38:50.316 A:middle
people to do.

00:38:50.546 --> 00:38:53.326 A:middle
And, you know, he responded,

00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:54.406 A:middle
like, well, how do you know

00:38:54.406 --> 00:38:54.576 A:middle
that?

00:38:54.796 --> 00:38:55.966 A:middle
How do you know that this is

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.666 A:middle
going to be easier than the way

00:38:57.666 --> 00:38:58.486 A:middle
that we do it now?

00:38:58.896 --> 00:39:01.946 A:middle
And I kind of realized that I

00:38:58.896 --> 00:39:01.946 A:middle
And I kind of realized that I

00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:03.446 A:middle
didn't know the answer to that.

00:39:03.446 --> 00:39:05.056 A:middle
And then, I realized what he was

00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:07.716 A:middle
really asking is, should we put

00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:10.046 A:middle
all of this energy into making

00:39:10.046 --> 00:39:11.816 A:middle
the changes that you're

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:12.756 A:middle
suggesting?

00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:14.546 A:middle
How can we be sure that that's

00:39:14.546 --> 00:39:15.696 A:middle
the right thing to do?

00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:18.756 A:middle
And to answer that question, I

00:39:19.416 --> 00:39:21.306 A:middle
opened up -- it might have been

00:39:21.306 --> 00:39:23.656 A:middle
Microsoft Paint [laughs] -- and

00:39:23.656 --> 00:39:27.136 A:middle
I drew a picture, and I took it

00:39:27.136 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
out onto the museum floor, and

00:39:29.806 --> 00:39:32.756 A:middle
basically asked visitors to give

00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:35.176 A:middle
me their impression of what they

00:39:35.376 --> 00:39:37.446 A:middle
thought they should do based on

00:39:37.706 --> 00:39:39.176 A:middle
kind of how I had arranged

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.136 A:middle
things on the screen.

00:39:41.606 --> 00:39:42.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So what Doug was talking

00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:44.146 A:middle
about here, and he went on to

00:39:44.226 --> 00:39:46.596 A:middle
explain, that it was this method

00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:48.736 A:middle
of prototyping that helped him

00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:50.026 A:middle
answer that question from his

00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
boss.

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:53.156 A:middle
Why should we put energy into

00:39:53.156 --> 00:39:53.786 A:middle
your idea?

00:39:54.736 --> 00:39:56.156 A:middle
So what Doug learned at his

00:39:56.276 --> 00:39:58.196 A:middle
first design job was that he

00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.096 A:middle
could not assume that his

00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.096 A:middle
could not assume that his

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:01.236 A:middle
designs were going to work.

00:40:01.236 --> 00:40:03.476 A:middle
And this actually also came up

00:40:03.476 --> 00:40:05.106 A:middle
in my conversation with Gary.

00:40:06.606 --> 00:40:07.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It wasn't just designed on

00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:10.306 A:middle
paper, implemented in code, and

00:40:10.306 --> 00:40:13.046 A:middle
sort of assumed that that was

00:40:13.046 --> 00:40:13.336 A:middle
going to work.

00:40:13.336 --> 00:40:15.906 A:middle
You can't just assume from your

00:40:15.906 --> 00:40:18.266 A:middle
own experience and through

00:40:18.476 --> 00:40:19.756 A:middle
chatting that something's going

00:40:19.756 --> 00:40:20.006 A:middle
to work.

00:40:20.006 --> 00:40:20.766 A:middle
You've really got to go out and

00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:20.956 A:middle
try it.

00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:24.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I think this is the part

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:25.886 A:middle
that's really important not to

00:40:25.886 --> 00:40:26.326 A:middle
overlook.

00:40:27.516 --> 00:40:28.616 A:middle
You know, in this case, we are

00:40:28.616 --> 00:40:30.296 A:middle
talking about trying designs in

00:40:30.296 --> 00:40:32.906 A:middle
context out in the real world to

00:40:32.906 --> 00:40:35.186 A:middle
vet solutions to problems, and

00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:36.706 A:middle
trying solutions is something

00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:37.956 A:middle
that Sam mentioned too.

00:40:39.486 --> 00:40:42.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One of our ethos's is to

00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:43.086 A:middle
solve a problem.

00:40:43.286 --> 00:40:45.196 A:middle
Put it in front of players and

00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:46.416 A:middle
see how they react.

00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:47.316 A:middle
See if they're learning what

00:40:47.316 --> 00:40:47.976 A:middle
they need to learn.

00:40:47.976 --> 00:40:49.706 A:middle
And if we need to do more, we'll

00:40:49.706 --> 00:40:50.146 A:middle
do more.

00:40:50.686 --> 00:40:53.386 A:middle
It's impossible to rush the

00:40:53.386 --> 00:40:55.216 A:middle
creative process of making a

00:40:55.216 --> 00:40:57.496 A:middle
game because so much of what's

00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:58.846 A:middle
special about the games that you

00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:01.726 A:middle
remember are decisions that seem

00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:01.726 A:middle
remember are decisions that seem

00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:03.456 A:middle
very obvious and very small but

00:41:03.456 --> 00:41:05.616 A:middle
take a really, really long time

00:41:05.616 --> 00:41:06.786 A:middle
to arrive at.

00:41:06.786 --> 00:41:08.486 A:middle
And you can't hire more people

00:41:08.486 --> 00:41:09.406 A:middle
to get there faster.

00:41:09.406 --> 00:41:12.006 A:middle
You just have to sit with it and

00:41:12.006 --> 00:41:13.866 A:middle
continue working on it until the

00:41:13.866 --> 00:41:14.976 A:middle
best solutions arise.

00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:18.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So Sam said something here

00:41:18.886 --> 00:41:20.176 A:middle
that I want to expand on.

00:41:21.196 --> 00:41:22.856 A:middle
More people are not going to fix

00:41:22.906 --> 00:41:24.176 A:middle
a creative problem.

00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.906 A:middle
Great artists are patient.

00:41:27.456 --> 00:41:29.326 A:middle
Sometimes you just get writer's

00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:30.856 A:middle
block and there's no amount of

00:41:30.896 --> 00:41:32.296 A:middle
conversation that's going to fix

00:41:32.296 --> 00:41:34.856 A:middle
it, so you have to wait and just

00:41:34.856 --> 00:41:36.326 A:middle
let that creative process

00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:36.846 A:middle
happen.

00:41:37.356 --> 00:41:38.506 A:middle
And that's okay.

00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:41.206 A:middle
It's a part of the process, and

00:41:41.206 --> 00:41:42.866 A:middle
sometimes that's exactly what is

00:41:42.866 --> 00:41:44.586 A:middle
needed to produce quality.

00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:47.336 A:middle
So the theme really from these

00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:49.976 A:middle
last 3 clips is to go out and

00:41:50.136 --> 00:41:52.626 A:middle
try your designs in context with

00:41:52.626 --> 00:41:53.376 A:middle
real people.

00:41:54.086 --> 00:41:55.926 A:middle
Show people prototypes and learn

00:41:55.926 --> 00:41:56.556 A:middle
from their feedback.

00:41:57.376 --> 00:41:58.696 A:middle
This is a really essential

00:41:58.796 --> 00:42:00.646 A:middle
technique to help work through

00:41:58.796 --> 00:42:00.646 A:middle
technique to help work through

00:42:00.646 --> 00:42:01.866 A:middle
your design decisions.

00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:05.306 A:middle
So we can learn a lot from each

00:42:05.306 --> 00:42:07.356 A:middle
other, so I wanted to know what

00:42:07.356 --> 00:42:09.506 A:middle
advice would one designer give

00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.686 A:middle
to another designer.

00:42:11.336 --> 00:42:14.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Learn how to accept, and

00:42:14.776 --> 00:42:16.296 A:middle
sort, and prioritize the

00:42:16.296 --> 00:42:17.846 A:middle
feedback as it comes in, whether

00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:19.036 A:middle
it's from yourself or from

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:19.336 A:middle
others.

00:42:19.906 --> 00:42:21.116 A:middle
You will learn so much more

00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:22.226 A:middle
quickly than if you are

00:42:22.226 --> 00:42:23.966 A:middle
defensive and you just, like,

00:42:23.966 --> 00:42:24.616 A:middle
buckle down.

00:42:26.496 --> 00:42:27.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I personally struggle with

00:42:27.706 --> 00:42:28.526 A:middle
this.

00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:30.266 A:middle
I can almost not help becoming

00:42:30.266 --> 00:42:32.326 A:middle
defensive when I hear feedback

00:42:32.356 --> 00:42:33.406 A:middle
on a project I'm working on.

00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:35.286 A:middle
It's like this instinctual

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.326 A:middle
reaction, especially if I just

00:42:37.356 --> 00:42:38.956 A:middle
spent late nights and weekends

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.026 A:middle
working on something.

00:42:41.066 --> 00:42:43.406 A:middle
But still, I know it's

00:42:43.406 --> 00:42:46.216 A:middle
important, but I wanted to know

00:42:46.216 --> 00:42:46.556 A:middle
why.

00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:49.596 A:middle
Again, why is it important to be

00:42:49.646 --> 00:42:50.676 A:middle
open to feedback?

00:42:52.646 --> 00:42:53.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think there's also just a

00:42:53.966 --> 00:42:55.206 A:middle
reality, which is after you've

00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:57.126 A:middle
used your own work for some

00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:58.716 A:middle
amount of time, you naturally

00:42:58.716 --> 00:43:00.396 A:middle
develop some blind spots.

00:42:58.716 --> 00:43:00.396 A:middle
develop some blind spots.

00:43:00.396 --> 00:43:01.966 A:middle
And that's where having a really

00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:03.166 A:middle
great, collaborative team and

00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:04.916 A:middle
people that you trust around you

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:06.986 A:middle
to help critique your work is a

00:43:07.026 --> 00:43:07.896 A:middle
really important part of the

00:43:07.896 --> 00:43:09.126 A:middle
design process.

00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:10.406 A:middle
So you can get fresh eyes on

00:43:10.406 --> 00:43:11.926 A:middle
stuff and trust that people have

00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:13.436 A:middle
the good intentions and they're

00:43:13.566 --> 00:43:14.986 A:middle
going to be able to give you

00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:16.006 A:middle
great insights of how you can

00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:16.406 A:middle
improve.

00:43:17.776 --> 00:43:18.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Totally.

00:43:18.956 --> 00:43:19.646 A:middle
I've been there.

00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:21.026 A:middle
I've definitely been too close

00:43:21.026 --> 00:43:22.396 A:middle
on a project and lost sight of a

00:43:22.396 --> 00:43:24.266 A:middle
big picture or overlooked some

00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:24.756 A:middle
detail.

00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:27.196 A:middle
So by being open to feedback,

00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:30.286 A:middle
it's really easy then to have

00:43:30.346 --> 00:43:32.596 A:middle
someone else like your team or

00:43:32.596 --> 00:43:33.306 A:middle
somebody that you asked a

00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:35.346 A:middle
question to give you something,

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:36.506 A:middle
some piece of information that

00:43:36.506 --> 00:43:37.566 A:middle
can help you improve your

00:43:37.566 --> 00:43:38.076 A:middle
designs.

00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:40.546 A:middle
And I really like that May-Li

00:43:40.646 --> 00:43:42.336 A:middle
said this word, "trust," to

00:43:42.336 --> 00:43:43.746 A:middle
trust the people around you.

00:43:44.836 --> 00:43:46.646 A:middle
So be open to feedback.

00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:48.986 A:middle
It makes everything better and

00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:50.816 A:middle
just ups the overall quality of

00:43:50.846 --> 00:43:52.726 A:middle
design in your work.

00:43:53.276 --> 00:43:55.876 A:middle
So this next technique is more

00:43:55.876 --> 00:43:57.706 A:middle
of a mindset, and it came up

00:43:57.756 --> 00:43:59.396 A:middle
when I asked Cas, who works on

00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:01.626 A:middle
platform patterns, "How do you

00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:01.626 A:middle
platform patterns, "How do you

00:44:01.626 --> 00:44:03.506 A:middle
approach designing for so many

00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:03.866 A:middle
people?"

00:44:03.866 --> 00:44:06.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Knowing what you don't know,

00:44:08.296 --> 00:44:08.696 A:middle
in a way.

00:44:08.976 --> 00:44:12.286 A:middle
What I mean is that if you're

00:44:12.286 --> 00:44:13.266 A:middle
looking at these things or if

00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:14.346 A:middle
you're designing for these

00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:15.396 A:middle
things, obviously, you have

00:44:16.306 --> 00:44:19.046 A:middle
ideas and ways of using a

00:44:19.046 --> 00:44:20.516 A:middle
certain device or an app in your

00:44:20.516 --> 00:44:21.396 A:middle
own way, in your own

00:44:21.396 --> 00:44:22.826 A:middle
environment, in your own habits,

00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:24.856 A:middle
and you might know a little bit

00:44:24.856 --> 00:44:26.266 A:middle
about how your friends are using

00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:27.956 A:middle
it, or how you've seen other

00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:29.296 A:middle
people use it, or maybe feedback

00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:30.996 A:middle
you're getting, but it's a

00:44:30.996 --> 00:44:32.426 A:middle
really big world, and there's a

00:44:32.426 --> 00:44:34.516 A:middle
lot of people out there, and

00:44:34.946 --> 00:44:35.876 A:middle
they all have their own needs,

00:44:35.936 --> 00:44:38.076 A:middle
their own habits, their own way

00:44:38.076 --> 00:44:39.356 A:middle
of going through life.

00:44:39.356 --> 00:44:40.546 A:middle
And so you have to be very

00:44:40.546 --> 00:44:42.766 A:middle
mindful that how you think about

00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:43.926 A:middle
things or your opinions are not

00:44:43.926 --> 00:44:45.506 A:middle
always, first of all, correct

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:48.896 A:middle
ones, nor the only ones.

00:44:49.696 --> 00:44:50.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I really like how Cas put

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:53.146 A:middle
this at the beginning -- know

00:44:53.196 --> 00:44:54.146 A:middle
that you don't know.

00:44:54.986 --> 00:44:56.286 A:middle
And he also used this word

00:44:56.286 --> 00:44:57.326 A:middle
"modesty" through our

00:44:57.326 --> 00:44:58.176 A:middle
conversation.

00:44:58.686 --> 00:45:00.156 A:middle
To be unassuming when you're

00:44:58.686 --> 00:45:00.156 A:middle
To be unassuming when you're

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.046 A:middle
designing for so many people.

00:45:03.016 --> 00:45:05.376 A:middle
And that is a really great

00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:06.646 A:middle
headspace to be in when you're

00:45:06.646 --> 00:45:08.846 A:middle
approaching design; to be modest

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.686 A:middle
and to be mindful.

00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:14.656 A:middle
So how do you help keep people's

00:45:14.656 --> 00:45:16.606 A:middle
experiences top of mind when

00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:17.246 A:middle
you're designing?

00:45:17.906 --> 00:45:19.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So in many ways, I just have

00:45:19.826 --> 00:45:21.966 A:middle
to be skeptical and ask

00:45:21.966 --> 00:45:23.516 A:middle
questions if the idea in front

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:25.566 A:middle
of me, is that going to work for

00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:27.266 A:middle
someone in a wheelchair, for

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:27.726 A:middle
example?

00:45:27.726 --> 00:45:28.866 A:middle
Is that going to work for

00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:33.086 A:middle
someone that has never used this

00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:33.686 A:middle
app before?

00:45:33.686 --> 00:45:36.476 A:middle
Is it going to work for someone

00:45:36.476 --> 00:45:37.996 A:middle
coming from a PC to a Mac?

00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:39.716 A:middle
You just have to ask lots of

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:41.756 A:middle
questions, and it can just start

00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:43.206 A:middle
people thinking about, oh, yeah,

00:45:43.206 --> 00:45:44.456 A:middle
did I care enough to consider

00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:47.346 A:middle
that aspect of it?

00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:49.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So this may seem

00:45:49.816 --> 00:45:51.996 A:middle
really simple, but it's

00:45:51.996 --> 00:45:53.756 A:middle
important to ask questions,

00:45:54.106 --> 00:45:55.236 A:middle
especially from different

00:45:55.236 --> 00:45:55.956 A:middle
perspectives.

00:45:56.466 --> 00:45:57.296 A:middle
That's going to help you

00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:58.836 A:middle
maintain quality throughout your

00:45:58.836 --> 00:46:00.366 A:middle
work and keep those other

00:45:58.836 --> 00:46:00.366 A:middle
work and keep those other

00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.706 A:middle
people's experiences in mind.

00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:05.296 A:middle
So design is a really

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:06.936 A:middle
collaborative process, and

00:46:06.936 --> 00:46:08.336 A:middle
there's a lot that goes into

00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:09.706 A:middle
making collaboration work.

00:46:10.396 --> 00:46:12.146 A:middle
At one point or another, we're

00:46:12.146 --> 00:46:13.386 A:middle
all going to start on a new

00:46:13.386 --> 00:46:15.636 A:middle
project or a new team, so what

00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:17.806 A:middle
helps make that process a little

00:46:17.806 --> 00:46:18.456 A:middle
bit easier?

00:46:20.306 --> 00:46:21.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I always like to set

00:46:21.306 --> 00:46:22.236 A:middle
expectations upfront.

00:46:22.886 --> 00:46:24.666 A:middle
I just say, hey, this is how I

00:46:24.736 --> 00:46:25.016 A:middle
am.

00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:27.956 A:middle
This is how I work.

00:46:28.006 --> 00:46:29.386 A:middle
This is how I communicate.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.196 A:middle
How do you work?

00:46:30.196 --> 00:46:31.356 A:middle
How do you communicate?

00:46:31.356 --> 00:46:32.806 A:middle
What's your preferred method of

00:46:32.866 --> 00:46:33.586 A:middle
communication?

00:46:33.586 --> 00:46:36.076 A:middle
And by the way, here's the goals

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
that I think we are working

00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:38.516 A:middle
toward.

00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:39.856 A:middle
And here are the things that are

00:46:39.856 --> 00:46:40.566 A:middle
important to me.

00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:42.246 A:middle
And please share with me the

00:46:42.246 --> 00:46:43.186 A:middle
same for you.

00:46:43.746 --> 00:46:45.396 A:middle
And I'll always sort of say it

00:46:45.396 --> 00:46:46.666 A:middle
with a caveat like, "We're going

00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:47.946 A:middle
to get all this business out of

00:46:47.946 --> 00:46:48.836 A:middle
the way, and we're going to

00:46:48.946 --> 00:46:52.826 A:middle
speak very directly about it."

00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:55.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I know for me, talking about

00:46:55.666 --> 00:46:56.896 A:middle
communication can be awkward,

00:46:57.666 --> 00:46:59.056 A:middle
but after I tried this

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:00.686 A:middle
technique, I learned that it

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:00.686 A:middle
technique, I learned that it

00:47:00.686 --> 00:47:03.316 A:middle
helps avoid so much drama and

00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:04.016 A:middle
confusion.

00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:06.866 A:middle
So talk about communication,

00:47:07.566 --> 00:47:08.506 A:middle
especially if you're working on

00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:08.986 A:middle
teams.

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.346 A:middle
Work towards the same goal about

00:47:11.346 --> 00:47:12.556 A:middle
creating something great.

00:47:14.026 --> 00:47:16.396 A:middle
So really, these six techniques

00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:18.596 A:middle
are all about caring about the

00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:20.596 A:middle
other people and having tools to

00:47:20.676 --> 00:47:22.566 A:middle
talk about it, and you have to

00:47:22.716 --> 00:47:24.056 A:middle
care about other people and put

00:47:24.056 --> 00:47:24.956 A:middle
yourself second.

00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:27.506 A:middle
Be mindful of their lives and be

00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.816 A:middle
modest about your own because we

00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:31.606 A:middle
just learned you can't assume.

00:47:31.876 --> 00:47:33.216 A:middle
You have to go out and try your

00:47:33.216 --> 00:47:35.166 A:middle
designs through prototyping and

00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:36.826 A:middle
also really remain open to

00:47:36.926 --> 00:47:37.476 A:middle
feedback.

00:47:37.976 --> 00:47:39.256 A:middle
That's essential to making

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.586 A:middle
progress in design because, as

00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:44.876 A:middle
May-Li said, we all develop

00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:47.866 A:middle
blind spots, and we're not only

00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:50.026 A:middle
designing to make progress, but

00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:51.356 A:middle
we want to get closer to

00:47:51.356 --> 00:47:52.886 A:middle
reaching our own aspirations and

00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:53.446 A:middle
our own goals.

00:47:54.146 --> 00:47:56.866 A:middle
So these techniques are used by

00:47:57.016 --> 00:47:58.656 A:middle
real designers that I talked to,

00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.876 A:middle
and they help them go through

00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.876 A:middle
and they help them go through

00:48:00.876 --> 00:48:02.176 A:middle
the process of designing, and it

00:48:02.176 --> 00:48:03.566 A:middle
makes their days a little bit

00:48:03.566 --> 00:48:05.836 A:middle
easier, so I hope they can help

00:48:06.096 --> 00:48:06.936 A:middle
you too.

00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:09.806 A:middle
So after all of these

00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:11.956 A:middle
interviews, I learned that

00:48:12.156 --> 00:48:14.636 A:middle
quality is the result of time,

00:48:15.056 --> 00:48:16.326 A:middle
effort, and care.

00:48:17.116 --> 00:48:19.316 A:middle
It's considered, it's crafted,

00:48:19.686 --> 00:48:21.096 A:middle
and it means something different

00:48:21.096 --> 00:48:21.906 A:middle
to different people.

00:48:23.416 --> 00:48:24.976 A:middle
I also learned that quality

00:48:24.976 --> 00:48:27.366 A:middle
impacts our every day, that your

00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:29.076 A:middle
intentions are truly felt.

00:48:29.956 --> 00:48:32.316 A:middle
High quality evokes trust, and

00:48:32.316 --> 00:48:34.246 A:middle
that's really important, as well

00:48:34.246 --> 00:48:36.786 A:middle
as it has to be earned.

00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:38.416 A:middle
It's also important to strive

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:41.166 A:middle
for simplicity, to aspire to be

00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:43.126 A:middle
stunning, and design to be

00:48:43.246 --> 00:48:43.536 A:middle
timeless.

00:48:44.446 --> 00:48:45.966 A:middle
Just think about how your app or

00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:47.726 A:middle
game can have a positive impact

00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:49.386 A:middle
on people's lives.

00:48:49.936 --> 00:48:51.856 A:middle
And finally, working towards

00:48:51.856 --> 00:48:53.116 A:middle
quality is all about

00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:54.986 A:middle
communication, collaboration,

00:48:55.076 --> 00:48:57.496 A:middle
and understanding, especially

00:48:57.496 --> 00:48:58.866 A:middle
understanding the people you are

00:48:58.866 --> 00:48:59.626 A:middle
designing for.

00:49:00.906 --> 00:49:02.586 A:middle
So really, quality is a

00:49:02.676 --> 00:49:03.166 A:middle
principle.

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:06.156 A:middle
It is intentional, and it's

00:49:06.156 --> 00:49:07.326 A:middle
something that you have to ask

00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:09.326 A:middle
yourself, what does quality mean

00:49:09.326 --> 00:49:09.916 A:middle
to you?

00:49:10.316 --> 00:49:11.506 A:middle
And you need to know your

00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:14.196 A:middle
interpretation to go forward, to

00:49:14.196 --> 00:49:16.486 A:middle
put in that hard work that meets

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:18.076 A:middle
your expectations and hits your

00:49:18.076 --> 00:49:21.006 A:middle
aspirations because, at the end

00:49:21.006 --> 00:49:23.046 A:middle
of the day, you're not designing

00:49:23.046 --> 00:49:23.656 A:middle
for you.

00:49:24.096 --> 00:49:25.676 A:middle
You're designing for other

00:49:25.676 --> 00:49:27.226 A:middle
people who are going to use your

00:49:27.566 --> 00:49:28.466 A:middle
app or your game.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:30.846 A:middle
So make great designs for them.

00:49:32.606 --> 00:49:34.176 A:middle
Now, there are two important

00:49:34.176 --> 00:49:35.726 A:middle
statements on quality in great

00:49:35.726 --> 00:49:37.856 A:middle
design that stand alone.

00:49:38.616 --> 00:49:39.646 A:middle
These are going to play back to

00:49:39.646 --> 00:49:41.536 A:middle
back, and I hope each offers

00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:42.596 A:middle
something different that you can

00:49:42.596 --> 00:49:44.396 A:middle
take away from today.

00:49:45.396 --> 00:49:49.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sensing the human behind the

00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:51.626 A:middle
experience I think is really an

00:49:52.036 --> 00:49:53.696 A:middle
earmark of something great.

00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:01.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; A great design is going to be

00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:01.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; A great design is going to be

00:50:01.096 --> 00:50:02.586 A:middle
the product of tremendous amount

00:50:02.586 --> 00:50:04.666 A:middle
of effort, and creativity, and

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:07.316 A:middle
skill, and [laughs] late nights.

00:50:07.476 --> 00:50:10.086 A:middle
It's going to seem effortless,

00:50:10.186 --> 00:50:12.606 A:middle
and it should hopefully recede

00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:14.146 A:middle
in people's consciousness.

00:50:14.736 --> 00:50:16.906 A:middle
And in a way, I think you're

00:50:16.906 --> 00:50:18.656 A:middle
very aware of an interface which

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:20.456 A:middle
has been poorly designed, and

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:21.706 A:middle
you're not at all aware of an

00:50:21.706 --> 00:50:23.356 A:middle
interface which has been well

00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:23.826 A:middle
designed.

00:50:28.296 --> 00:50:29.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I talked to a lot of

00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:31.586 A:middle
people, and I saved something

00:50:31.626 --> 00:50:33.446 A:middle
special just for the end.

00:50:34.266 --> 00:50:35.856 A:middle
Since I had the opportunity to

00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.026 A:middle
talk to so many different

00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:39.566 A:middle
designers, I had to ask them onw

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:40.906 A:middle
final question, and it's

00:50:40.906 --> 00:50:42.226 A:middle
something that I've always

00:50:42.226 --> 00:50:45.036 A:middle
wanted, wondered myself: What

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:47.536 A:middle
are designers' favorite colors?

00:50:50.896 --> 00:50:51.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:53.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color?

00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:55.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I have to say--

00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:57.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Is there such a thing?

00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:58.816 A:middle
I don't think so.

00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I would have said glitter,

00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I would have said glitter,

00:51:00.076 --> 00:51:01.076 A:middle
but it's not a color.

00:51:01.446 --> 00:51:02.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I

00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:04.496 A:middle
really love is Tahitian blue.

00:51:04.616 --> 00:51:06.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But colors to me are like

00:51:06.736 --> 00:51:09.006 A:middle
moods, and I do not have the

00:51:09.006 --> 00:51:09.936 A:middle
same mood every day.

00:51:09.936 --> 00:51:10.796 A:middle
I don't think I even have the

00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:12.516 A:middle
same mood every hour, so.

00:51:12.516 --> 00:51:13.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I really like white.

00:51:14.236 --> 00:51:15.186 A:middle
Is it really a color?

00:51:15.376 --> 00:51:16.366 A:middle
I think that's one of the

00:51:16.366 --> 00:51:17.486 A:middle
reasons why I like it.

00:51:17.486 --> 00:51:18.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color has been

00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:19.046 A:middle
amber.

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:20.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I mean, lately, it's been

00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:22.216 A:middle
green for some reason.

00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:22.926 A:middle
I don't know why.

00:51:23.026 --> 00:51:25.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I got to go back on this

00:51:25.746 --> 00:51:26.046 A:middle
answer.

00:51:26.046 --> 00:51:29.346 A:middle
Oh, it's actually Pantone 347.

00:51:29.346 --> 00:51:30.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color is blue.

00:51:31.376 --> 00:51:33.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Like a happy blue, and blue

00:51:33.996 --> 00:51:35.566 A:middle
is, like, always such a color of

00:51:35.566 --> 00:51:37.076 A:middle
responsibility, which is, like,

00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:37.976 A:middle
so me.

00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:39.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But I just think it's, like,

00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:41.596 A:middle
soft and friendly.

00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:44.886 A:middle
And food that's pink tastes

00:51:44.886 --> 00:51:44.976 A:middle
good.

00:51:45.066 --> 00:51:46.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go with red.

00:51:46.416 --> 00:51:47.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Throw out a hex value.

00:51:47.506 --> 00:51:48.996 A:middle
I don't have a favorite color.

00:51:49.446 --> 00:51:50.466 A:middle
Every color's great.

00:51:50.466 --> 00:51:53.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [laughs] All right, maybe

00:51:53.316 --> 00:51:54.886 A:middle
I'll just answer for this moment

00:51:55.096 --> 00:51:56.326 A:middle
in time.

00:51:56.326 --> 00:51:58.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I don't wear any green.

00:51:58.596 --> 00:52:00.376 A:middle
My car's not green.

00:51:58.596 --> 00:52:00.376 A:middle
My car's not green.

00:52:00.486 --> 00:52:04.866 A:middle
But I just like the idea of

00:52:04.926 --> 00:52:05.346 A:middle
green.

00:52:05.696 --> 00:52:07.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I can't pick one because

00:52:08.026 --> 00:52:09.326 A:middle
I wouldn't be able to pick a

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:12.966 A:middle
single musical note, so I'll use

00:52:12.966 --> 00:52:14.476 A:middle
all of them where it makes

00:52:14.476 --> 00:52:14.876 A:middle
sense.

00:52:15.786 --> 00:52:17.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'll need to check the spec

00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:19.046 A:middle
on that, I think.

00:52:19.456 --> 00:52:20.806 A:middle
System blue, of course.

00:52:20.806 --> 00:52:20.936 A:middle
Yeah.

00:52:26.126 --> 00:52:27.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Special thanks to everyone

00:52:27.466 --> 00:52:28.486 A:middle
who participated in these

00:52:28.486 --> 00:52:29.026 A:middle
interviews.

00:52:29.476 --> 00:52:30.766 A:middle
Thank you all so much.

00:52:30.826 --> 00:52:32.276 A:middle
Have a great WWDC.
