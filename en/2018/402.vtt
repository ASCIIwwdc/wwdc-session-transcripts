00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:28.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome to

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:31.916 A:middle
Getting the Most out of

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.526 A:middle
Playgrounds in Xcode.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.006 A:middle
My name is Tibet Rooney-Rabdau

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.096 A:middle
and with me today are my

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.986 A:middle
teammates Alex Brown and TJ

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:38.376 A:middle
Usiyan.

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:41.296 A:middle
I love that every time I have a

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:42.986 A:middle
new coding idea I can jump right

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:44.256 A:middle
into a playground to try it out.

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:46.806 A:middle
In today's session we will share

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.076 A:middle
with you our favorite work

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:48.456 A:middle
flows.

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:50.666 A:middle
This is a great session for

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.866 A:middle
those not too familiar with

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.706 A:middle
playgrounds in Xcode, as well as

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:54.536 A:middle
those diving deeper.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.996 A:middle
We're going to start out todays

00:00:57.996 --> 00:00:58.956 A:middle
talk with playground

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:01.386 A:middle
fundamentals, a brief overview

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:01.386 A:middle
fundamentals, a brief overview

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:03.236 A:middle
of playgrounds, markup, and

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:04.286 A:middle
imbedded resources.

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.636 A:middle
Then we'll show you how to run

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:08.016 A:middle
step-by-step in a playground.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.226 A:middle
We'll discuss tips to give you

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:11.826 A:middle
more control of your code

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:12.586 A:middle
execution.

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:15.456 A:middle
Lastly we'll finish with

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.426 A:middle
advanced techniques including

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:18.636 A:middle
the wonderful world of Custom

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:19.926 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:22.146 A:middle
We will use this protocol to

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:23.856 A:middle
customize your inline results.

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.886 A:middle
We will also discuss how to use

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.516 A:middle
workspaces to exercise code in

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:30.406 A:middle
your frameworks.

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
Playgrounds provides an

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.026 A:middle
interactive place to explore

00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:36.416 A:middle
Swift, create learning

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:37.336 A:middle
environments or others, and

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.516 A:middle
prototype parts of your app.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:41.776 A:middle
Let's get started with a quick

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
tour of Playgrounds in Xcode.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.916 A:middle
When you first open a

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.616 A:middle
playground, Xcode shows you the

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
standard editor.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:52.736 A:middle
This is the basic editor mode

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.646 A:middle
you use in Xcode with a couple

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:55.286 A:middle
additions.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.726 A:middle
What is unique about this editor

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.426 A:middle
when you're in a playground is

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
the result sidebar on the right

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
the result sidebar on the right

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.736 A:middle
hands side displaying the result

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.236 A:middle
of each expression in your code.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.836 A:middle
You also have the ability to add

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.716 A:middle
these results as inline results.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:12.246 A:middle
This is done by selecting the

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:14.256 A:middle
rectangular button beside your

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:15.476 A:middle
result in the result sidebar.

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.276 A:middle
This will then show your result

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:22.916 A:middle
inline with your Swift Code.

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:24.406 A:middle
In this example you can see this

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:25.646 A:middle
demonstrated where "Hello,

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.746 A:middle
playground" is added below our

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:29.236 A:middle
string variable declaration.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:32.416 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:33.526 A:middle
assistant editor mode.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:36.156 A:middle
What is interesting about this

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.146 A:middle
mode in Playgrounds in Xcode is

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.186 A:middle
that you can visualize your

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:41.136 A:middle
results in more detail by using

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:41.616 A:middle
a live view.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.426 A:middle
In this example I've created a

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.126 A:middle
live view using UIView that

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:48.256 A:middle
shows a welcome message.

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:50.156 A:middle
But you could also use

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.526 A:middle
UIViewController for iOS and

00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:54.046 A:middle
[inaudible] playgrounds and for

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:56.426 A:middle
macOS playgrounds NSView and

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.126 A:middle
NSViewController.

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.336 A:middle
Now let me show you a short

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:04.536 A:middle
snippet that demonstrates how to

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
show Live View.

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:07.946 A:middle
First you need to import

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:08.806 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport.

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.836 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport is a framework

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.626 A:middle
provided by Xcode to allow

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.796 A:middle
playgrounds to interact with

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:16.896 A:middle
Xcode, including support for

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:17.726 A:middle
showing live views.

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:20.086 A:middle
You import this playground

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.656 A:middle
support framework so you can use

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:22.056 A:middle
its API.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:24.546 A:middle
Once you've created a

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:25.896 A:middle
viewController using the

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:27.926 A:middle
standard UIKit or AppKit APIs,

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:29.616 A:middle
you need to hand it over to the

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:30.876 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport framework.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.266 A:middle
You do this by setting the Live

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
View property of the current

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.016 A:middle
playground page to your

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:36.666 A:middle
viewController.

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:38.996 A:middle
This signals to Xcode that it

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:40.126 A:middle
should show your viewController

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:41.546 A:middle
in the assistant editor.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.736 A:middle
To give your playgrounds an

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.316 A:middle
extra bit of polish, you can

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.776 A:middle
include some markup text.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.626 A:middle
It is especially great when

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:50.446 A:middle
you're making a playground to

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:50.986 A:middle
share with others.

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:53.476 A:middle
With markup you can include

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
stylized text, images, and video

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:56.946 A:middle
in your playground.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
Now let's take a quick

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
walkthrough what is possible

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
walkthrough what is possible

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:01.336 A:middle
with markup.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.356 A:middle
Here I've included some markup

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:06.736 A:middle
comments with text for a poem

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:07.346 A:middle
I'm writing.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:09.436 A:middle
A markup comment is like a

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:11.326 A:middle
regular comment but with a colon

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:12.526 A:middle
after the forward slashes.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
The rest of the comment is then

00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:17.786 A:middle
treated as markup text.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:19.576 A:middle
If you have multiple lines of

00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:21.375 A:middle
comments next to each other they

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:23.536 A:middle
form one block of markup text.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.166 A:middle
You can also use multiline

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.806 A:middle
comments by putting a colon

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.096 A:middle
after the first asterisks.

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
Here's our markup in Xcode now.

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.236 A:middle
It is showing the raw markup of

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:36.996 A:middle
the poem I wrote.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.766 A:middle
To show it in its rendered form,

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:41.526 A:middle
select the button in the top

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:42.586 A:middle
right corner of the window,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.696 A:middle
which shows Xcode's Inspector.

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:47.936 A:middle
Then select Render Documentation

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:49.316 A:middle
under Playground Settings.

00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.396 A:middle
The lines in my poem are now

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:52.876 A:middle
rendered.

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.746 A:middle
Other interesting things you can

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:57.866 A:middle
do with the markup are adding

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.446 A:middle
headings to a Playground peach.

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:01.356 A:middle
You can use headings to create

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:02.676 A:middle
structure in your playground.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.476 A:middle
You can use number signs to

00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:06.146 A:middle
supply up to three levels of

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:06.566 A:middle
heading.

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.136 A:middle
In this example the title of my

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:12.206 A:middle
poem "Roses are Red" as a first

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:15.006 A:middle
level heading, the subtitle, "An

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:16.706 A:middle
Ode to Markup" as a second level

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.266 A:middle
heading, and the byline as a

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:20.156 A:middle
third level heading.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
Remember to add at least one

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.006 A:middle
space between the number sign

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:24.816 A:middle
and the heading string,

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
otherwise you'll have a number

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:26.906 A:middle
sign connected to your heading

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:27.416 A:middle
when rendered.

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:30.666 A:middle
This is what the headings look

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
like rendered when included with

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:32.916 A:middle
the lines in my poem.

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:34.876 A:middle
You can see that the first level

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.656 A:middle
heading is largest, followed by

00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
the second level, and then the

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.066 A:middle
third level heading.

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:42.416 A:middle
You can also format the text in

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:42.956 A:middle
your markup content.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.876 A:middle
You can wrap a string of

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:47.926 A:middle
characters on a single asterisk

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.226 A:middle
on each side to italicize the

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.486 A:middle
text between the asterisks.

00:05:51.676 --> 00:05:53.286 A:middle
You can also use backticks to

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.406 A:middle
display text with Code Font.

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.156 A:middle
Finally, if you use two

00:05:58.156 --> 00:05:59.836 A:middle
asterisks instead of one the

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.776 A:middle
text will be bold.

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.776 A:middle
text will be bold.

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:02.646 A:middle
Let's take a look at this

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:03.036 A:middle
rendered.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:07.136 A:middle
You can see that red and blue

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:08.096 A:middle
are italicized.

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:11.196 A:middle
Markup is in Code Font and fun

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:11.846 A:middle
is in bold.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at using lists

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.346 A:middle
in markup.

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
If a markup comment starts with

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.446 A:middle
a number followed by a period,

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.306 A:middle
it will create an item in a

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.406 A:middle
numbered list.

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:25.966 A:middle
In this example, I've added the

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:27.816 A:middle
lines of my poem to a numbered

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
list.

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.536 A:middle
Here you can see the lines of my

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:32.336 A:middle
poem rendered in a number list,

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:34.906 A:middle
each line representing an item

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:37.206 A:middle
in a numbered list.

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:38.866 A:middle
You can also create a bullet to

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:39.786 A:middle
list in markup.

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.536 A:middle
A bulleted list is like a number

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.996 A:middle
list except each line starts

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.286 A:middle
with an asterisks instead of a

00:06:45.286 --> 00:06:45.616 A:middle
number.

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:49.056 A:middle
This is how my poem in rendered

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:51.076 A:middle
in a bulleted list with each

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:52.516 A:middle
line in my poem represented as a

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.276 A:middle
bulleted item in a bulletin

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:54.446 A:middle
list.

00:06:57.076 --> 00:06:58.846 A:middle
Markup can also contain links.

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:01.456 A:middle
In this example I've created a

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:01.456 A:middle
In this example I've created a

00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:03.286 A:middle
link to roses and violets.

00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:05.736 A:middle
To create a link you wrap the

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.536 A:middle
text in brackets and then place

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:09.756 A:middle
the destination of the link in

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:12.536 A:middle
parentheses after.

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:13.546 A:middle
Another way you can create a

00:07:13.546 --> 00:07:15.466 A:middle
link is by using a reference.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:17.396 A:middle
In this example I've created a

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:19.416 A:middle
reference named 1, but this can

00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:20.246 A:middle
be any string.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:21.306 A:middle
It doesn't have to be a number.

00:07:22.956 --> 00:07:24.416 A:middle
When creating and using a link

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:26.036 A:middle
reference you wrap the name in

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:26.786 A:middle
brackets.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.426 A:middle
When creating a reference you

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:29.606 A:middle
add a colon and then the

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:30.646 A:middle
destination to the link.

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
Here are the links represented

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:37.226 A:middle
in rendered form, Roses,

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.446 A:middle
Violets, and Fun are shown in

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:40.836 A:middle
blue to represent a link.

00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:44.606 A:middle
Up to this point we treated a

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:46.436 A:middle
playground as a single location,

00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:48.206 A:middle
but playgrounds can contain

00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:50.336 A:middle
multiple pages, each with their

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.756 A:middle
own markup and code.

00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:54.746 A:middle
To create a new playground page,

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:56.406 A:middle
select the playground and then

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:57.426 A:middle
open the file menu.

00:07:58.026 --> 00:07:59.496 A:middle
Select New, then Playground

00:07:59.496 --> 00:07:59.926 A:middle
Page.

00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:02.086 A:middle
You could also create a

00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:03.586 A:middle
playground page by control

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:05.206 A:middle
clicking on the playground and

00:08:05.206 --> 00:08:06.296 A:middle
then selecting New Playground

00:08:06.296 --> 00:08:06.796 A:middle
Page.

00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:10.246 A:middle
You can create links in your

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.966 A:middle
markup, which navigate between

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:12.296 A:middle
pages.

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:15.636 A:middle
To go to the previous page, you

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:16.516 A:middle
can create a link where the

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:18.306 A:middle
destination is @previous.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:21.036 A:middle
To go to the next page you can

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:21.686 A:middle
create a link where the

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:23.186 A:middle
destination is @next.

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:25.996 A:middle
Finally, if you want to navigate

00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:27.866 A:middle
to a specific page, you create a

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:28.896 A:middle
link where the destination is

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:30.656 A:middle
the file name for that page

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.515 A:middle
without the extension and by

00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:34.395 A:middle
replacing any spaces or special

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.186 A:middle
characters with their percent in

00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:36.946 A:middle
coded form.

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:40.716 A:middle
You can also imbed some

00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:41.895 A:middle
additional content to make you

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:43.436 A:middle
playgrounds even more powerful.

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:46.066 A:middle
You can add additional Swift

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:47.426 A:middle
files to the sources folder,

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:48.976 A:middle
which is at the top level of the

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:49.506 A:middle
playground.

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.526 A:middle
Each page also has its own

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:53.336 A:middle
sources folder.

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:56.086 A:middle
Sources are compiled as separate

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:57.466 A:middle
modules where they are

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:58.536 A:middle
automatically imported where

00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
visible so you don't have to

00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
visible so you don't have to

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:01.386 A:middle
handle import statements.

00:09:02.456 --> 00:09:03.576 A:middle
Since these are compiled as

00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:05.536 A:middle
separate modules, you can use

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.486 A:middle
access control to control what

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.446 A:middle
is exported from your axillary

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:09.996 A:middle
sources.

00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:13.196 A:middle
Anything you want to use as your

00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:14.856 A:middle
main playground source should be

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:15.696 A:middle
marked as Public.

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:18.246 A:middle
A great example of things to put

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
into the sources folder is

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:22.546 A:middle
helper code such as classes or

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:24.476 A:middle
extensions that are outside of

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:25.316 A:middle
the main playground.

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:30.076 A:middle
Playgrounds can also contain

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.206 A:middle
other resources.

00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:33.786 A:middle
Resources are any other file

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:34.886 A:middle
that you'd like to use in your

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:36.076 A:middle
playground such as images,

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.356 A:middle
audio, video, storyboards, and

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:38.806 A:middle
ZIPs.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.476 A:middle
Just like sources, there's a

00:09:42.476 --> 00:09:44.016 A:middle
resources folder at the top

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.306 A:middle
level of the playground as well

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:46.336 A:middle
as for each page.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.946 A:middle
You can use these resources that

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.176 A:middle
you've added to your playground

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
both in your markup and code.

00:09:54.716 --> 00:09:56.346 A:middle
Similar to how you create a link

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.796 A:middle
in your playground, you can use

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.276 A:middle
this highlighted syntax to imbed

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.276 A:middle
this highlighted syntax to imbed

00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
an image in your markup.

00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:04.396 A:middle
You specify the image name, in

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.466 A:middle
this case MyPicture.jpg.

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:09.046 A:middle
You also specify alternate text

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:10.796 A:middle
describing the image along with

00:10:10.836 --> 00:10:12.476 A:middle
hover title text that shows my

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:14.056 A:middle
pointer is over the image.

00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:16.776 A:middle
Both alternate text and hover

00:10:16.776 --> 00:10:18.296 A:middle
title text can also be used for

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:19.906 A:middle
accessibility to benefit

00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:20.756 A:middle
voiceover users.

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:24.086 A:middle
And here we access the same

00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:26.146 A:middle
imaging code using the standard

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:27.846 A:middle
UIImage or NSImage APIs.

00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:32.046 A:middle
Similarly, to images you can

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:33.486 A:middle
also imbed videos in your

00:10:33.486 --> 00:10:34.016 A:middle
markup.

00:10:35.096 --> 00:10:36.626 A:middle
This is done by using a syntax

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.546 A:middle
similar for that images with

00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:39.676 A:middle
additional support for

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:41.926 A:middle
specifying a poster image along

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:45.596 A:middle
with the width and height of the

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:46.086 A:middle
video.

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:47.676 A:middle
For other resources that you

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.286 A:middle
want to access in code, such as

00:10:49.436 --> 00:10:51.686 A:middle
this video, you can use the

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:53.756 A:middle
standard Bundle APIs for finding

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:54.476 A:middle
resources.

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:57.716 A:middle
This example uses a URL for

00:10:57.716 --> 00:10:59.926 A:middle
resource with extension API to

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.046 A:middle
ask the main bundle for URL for

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.046 A:middle
ask the main bundle for URL for

00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:04.546 A:middle
Mvideo.mp4.

00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:06.606 A:middle
Resources in your playground are

00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:08.176 A:middle
automatically treated as

00:11:08.176 --> 00:11:09.596 A:middle
resources of the main bundle.

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:13.346 A:middle
For more information on the

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:14.576 A:middle
markup you can use in your

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:16.066 A:middle
playgrounds and the playground

00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:17.306 A:middle
support framework we discussed

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:18.696 A:middle
earlier, please visit

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:21.386 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:23.196 A:middle
With that please welcome my

00:11:23.196 --> 00:11:24.726 A:middle
teammate Alex Brown to the stage

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:26.196 A:middle
so he can tell you more about

00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:27.216 A:middle
exciting new changes to

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:28.406 A:middle
playgrounds in Xcode 10.

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:29.626 A:middle
Thank you.

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:38.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:39.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tibet.

00:11:40.456 --> 00:11:42.886 A:middle
I'm Alex Brown and I'm a Core OS

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:43.396 A:middle
Engineer.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:46.226 A:middle
I want to ask you a question.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:48.576 A:middle
Have you ever woken up with a

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:50.916 A:middle
great coding idea but then

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.556 A:middle
struggled to set it down before

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:53.536 A:middle
you reach your code editor?

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:56.026 A:middle
Perhaps it's your inbox that

00:11:56.026 --> 00:11:58.036 A:middle
gets in the way or perhaps you

00:11:58.036 --> 00:11:59.736 A:middle
haven't yet set up your project

00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
within Xcode.

00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
within Xcode.

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.766 A:middle
Whether you're a beginner just

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:06.026 A:middle
getting started with Apple APIs,

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.316 A:middle
a seasoned engineer with a

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.986 A:middle
deadline, or a data scientist

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:12.226 A:middle
building machine learning

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:15.696 A:middle
models, I want to tell you that

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:17.216 A:middle
Xcode playgrounds are the

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:19.126 A:middle
fastest way to get started

00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.366 A:middle
coding against Apple's APIs.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:27.376 A:middle
In Xcode 10, playgrounds are

00:12:27.376 --> 00:12:28.956 A:middle
faster and more responsive than

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.726 A:middle
ever allowing you to execute

00:12:30.726 --> 00:12:32.346 A:middle
your code in a step-by-step

00:12:32.346 --> 00:12:32.776 A:middle
fashion.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.376 A:middle
First I'd like to get you

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:36.876 A:middle
familiar with a new UI for doing

00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:36.976 A:middle
this.

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:42.586 A:middle
If you're familiar with

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:44.406 A:middle
playgrounds, your eye should

00:12:44.406 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
immediately jump to the blue

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:49.056 A:middle
line over the not line numbers.

00:12:50.676 --> 00:12:52.576 A:middle
There's a new play button which

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:53.436 A:middle
tracks your pointer.

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
A blue line over the line

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.706 A:middle
numbers mean these lines are

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
ready to execute and when you

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
ready to execute and when you

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:04.796 A:middle
click the Play button this means

00:13:05.806 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
run all of the blue lines up to

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.076 A:middle
and including the one with the

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:09.826 A:middle
play button on it.

00:13:10.226 --> 00:13:11.456 A:middle
Let's see what that looks like.

00:13:13.076 --> 00:13:13.606 A:middle
There we go.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.566 A:middle
You can see just the first three

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:16.696 A:middle
lines of the playground are

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
executed.

00:13:18.126 --> 00:13:19.536 A:middle
The results are visible on the

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:20.276 A:middle
right-hand side.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.726 A:middle
You can also see that the play

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:24.226 A:middle
button has now gone gray.

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:26.126 A:middle
This indicates that these lines

00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:27.656 A:middle
of code are no longer ready to

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.116 A:middle
execute.

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.396 A:middle
You just executed them.

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:33.066 A:middle
There's a second reason that

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.416 A:middle
they play button might be gray.

00:13:35.046 --> 00:13:36.486 A:middle
This means you're hovering over

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:37.796 A:middle
some code, which is not a

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:39.246 A:middle
top-level line of code.

00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:41.736 A:middle
This includes code inside

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:43.636 A:middle
function brackets and inside of

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:44.126 A:middle
fall loop.

00:13:44.876 --> 00:13:46.436 A:middle
If you wish to execute a fall

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:47.966 A:middle
loop you need to move your

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.056 A:middle
pointer to the closing brace

00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:52.236 A:middle
where the play button will go

00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.696 A:middle
blue then you'll be able to

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:54.906 A:middle
execute it.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
There's also a great keyboard

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
There's also a great keyboard

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:02.656 A:middle
shortcut, Shift Return.

00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:04.476 A:middle
This is just like pressing

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.806 A:middle
Return at the end of typing a

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.736 A:middle
line of code, but it also means

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.726 A:middle
execute this line, and it move

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:10.966 A:middle
the cursor to the next line

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:14.036 A:middle
ready to write some more code.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.956 A:middle
Blue code also has a second

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:17.686 A:middle
interpretation.

00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:19.916 A:middle
It means code that it's safe to

00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:21.986 A:middle
edit without resetting your

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:22.546 A:middle
playground.

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:24.456 A:middle
Why is this important?

00:14:25.086 --> 00:14:26.916 A:middle
If you edit code above the blue

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:29.736 A:middle
line this is modifying code that

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.066 A:middle
you've already executed.

00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:32.706 A:middle
So you'll have to resent your

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
playground to take account of

00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:35.346 A:middle
your changes.

00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
When you edit code above the

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.956 A:middle
blue line, the playground resets

00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:40.756 A:middle
automatically.

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:46.316 A:middle
Sometimes you'll need to reset

00:14:46.316 --> 00:14:47.786 A:middle
your playground manually and you

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.526 A:middle
can do this using the stop

00:14:49.526 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
button in the Debug bar at the

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:52.266 A:middle
bottom of the screen.

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.586 A:middle
So why run in a step-by-step

00:14:55.586 --> 00:14:56.086 A:middle
fashion?

00:14:56.086 --> 00:14:57.326 A:middle
Why have we added this feature?

00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
Firstly, executing just one more

00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
Firstly, executing just one more

00:15:00.226 --> 00:15:01.026 A:middle
line is fast.

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:02.946 A:middle
It's way faster than restarting

00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:04.146 A:middle
a playground and waiting for it

00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.526 A:middle
to catch up with your thoughts.

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.496 A:middle
Secondly, it allows you to

00:15:08.496 --> 00:15:09.886 A:middle
respond to live data.

00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:12.796 A:middle
Write a line of code, execute

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:14.476 A:middle
it, see what the results are,

00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:15.596 A:middle
and this should lead you

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:16.986 A:middle
naturally to the next line of

00:15:16.986 --> 00:15:17.606 A:middle
code to write.

00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:20.736 A:middle
And thirdly rerunning a

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:22.486 A:middle
playground every time can give

00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:23.846 A:middle
you different values every time.

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:25.836 A:middle
This can happen, for instance,

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.186 A:middle
if you're accessing a network

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.206 A:middle
resource or you're generating

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.006 A:middle
random numbers.

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:32.706 A:middle
By executing step-by-step your

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:34.416 A:middle
data model stays stable and

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:35.396 A:middle
easier to understand.

00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:38.406 A:middle
So let's take a look at a simple

00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:39.806 A:middle
example that you can try

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:40.516 A:middle
yourselves.

00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle
I like games.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
I like card games and board

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.676 A:middle
games and computer games.

00:15:46.856 --> 00:15:48.786 A:middle
I even like writing games.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.016 A:middle
Now I'm not too hot at it so I

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.286 A:middle
like to keep my games small.

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.906 A:middle
This is a really small game.

00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:55.486 A:middle
It's the game of roshambo.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:57.736 A:middle
It's the schoolyard game of

00:15:57.736 --> 00:15:59.656 A:middle
rock, paper, scissors.

00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
I've written the rules as a

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.746 A:middle
simple function check, which

00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:04.766 A:middle
tells us if we've won.

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:06.836 A:middle
I've also written a computer

00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:08.336 A:middle
player, which simply makes one

00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:09.516 A:middle
of the moves at random.

00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:13.246 A:middle
By executing step-by-step we can

00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:14.736 A:middle
execute line six where the

00:16:14.736 --> 00:16:16.786 A:middle
computer player plays and see

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:18.256 A:middle
what the result is before making

00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:18.746 A:middle
our move.

00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:20.956 A:middle
In this case the computer player

00:16:20.956 --> 00:16:22.756 A:middle
has played "rock" and we've

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:23.716 A:middle
played "paper".

00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:26.546 A:middle
Paper beats rock and we win the

00:16:26.546 --> 00:16:26.946 A:middle
game.

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:29.316 A:middle
This might sound a little bit

00:16:29.316 --> 00:16:30.756 A:middle
like cheating, but it's an

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.976 A:middle
extremely powerful technique.

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:37.246 A:middle
It's an extremely powerful

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.046 A:middle
technique when you're trying to

00:16:39.046 --> 00:16:41.056 A:middle
learn a new and unfamiliar API

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:43.416 A:middle
or exploring a data structure

00:16:43.576 --> 00:16:44.996 A:middle
whose types and values you don't

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:45.456 A:middle
yet know.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.116 A:middle
So that's a very simple example.

00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:49.506 A:middle
Now we're going to look at

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:50.536 A:middle
something a little bit more

00:16:50.536 --> 00:16:51.646 A:middle
magical with a demo.

00:16:54.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:54.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.415 A:middle
So we started off with one game,

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
I'm going to move on to another.

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:10.336 A:middle
This is the game of Tic-tac-toe.

00:17:11.306 --> 00:17:12.816 A:middle
I've already been working on

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:13.556 A:middle
this a little while.

00:17:14.086 --> 00:17:16.185 A:middle
I've built the game engine and

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:17.486 A:middle
I've made a first version of the

00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:17.685 A:middle
UI.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.856 A:middle
I've moved all of that code

00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:21.406 A:middle
aside into the auxiliary

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:22.066 A:middle
sources.

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.836 A:middle
This gets it out of our way and

00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.246 A:middle
allows us to focus on the next

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:27.185 A:middle
steps -- actually playing the

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:28.996 A:middle
game and refining the UI a

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:29.356 A:middle
little.

00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:32.176 A:middle
I'm also going to use a live

00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:33.976 A:middle
view, but first let's look back

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:36.366 A:middle
at the blue control over the

00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:37.106 A:middle
line numbers.

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:38.876 A:middle
You can see that it tracks the

00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:39.556 A:middle
mouse pointer.

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:43.696 A:middle
So let's get started by loading

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:44.256 A:middle
the game board.

00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:46.626 A:middle
Let's rotate it so we can see

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:48.436 A:middle
it.

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.406 A:middle
This is the Tic-tac-toe game

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:50.686 A:middle
board.

00:17:51.146 --> 00:17:52.356 A:middle
You can see I've been able to

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:53.586 A:middle
execute the first half of the

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:55.356 A:middle
playground and I've still got

00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:56.306 A:middle
some lines left in the

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.356 A:middle
playground to execute.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:00.116 A:middle
These include my first move.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:00.116 A:middle
These include my first move.

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:02.566 A:middle
Let's run that.

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:03.946 A:middle
There we go.

00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:05.576 A:middle
So you can see we're going to be

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:08.266 A:middle
playing the game in code and

00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:09.666 A:middle
viewing the results with the

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:10.306 A:middle
live view.

00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:12.706 A:middle
Let's let the computer play and

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:13.686 A:middle
have a turn.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:18.956 A:middle
Few, that's great.

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:20.406 A:middle
The computer player is

00:18:20.406 --> 00:18:21.306 A:middle
completely random.

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:23.116 A:middle
So it's just possible it's going

00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:23.876 A:middle
to beat me today.

00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:28.066 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.916 A:middle
So I've shown you how we can

00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:31.046 A:middle
execute some of the lines of

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:33.066 A:middle
code and then step-by-step

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:34.786 A:middle
execute lines of code which are

00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:35.546 A:middle
already present in the

00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:36.076 A:middle
playground.

00:18:36.076 --> 00:18:37.996 A:middle
But we can do more than that.

00:18:37.996 --> 00:18:39.706 A:middle
It's always safe to add new code

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:40.706 A:middle
at the end of a playground.

00:18:41.126 --> 00:18:41.976 A:middle
So let's make another move.

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:52.246 A:middle
There we go.

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:54.626 A:middle
Now, I can click the Play button

00:18:55.216 --> 00:19:00.026 A:middle
to execute this line of code and

00:18:55.216 --> 00:19:00.026 A:middle
to execute this line of code and

00:19:00.026 --> 00:19:00.856 A:middle
I think now we'll let the

00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:01.746 A:middle
computer have another go.

00:19:07.196 --> 00:19:07.976 A:middle
That's great.

00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:12.626 A:middle
[ Laughing ]

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:14.166 A:middle
You should notice a couple of

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:14.676 A:middle
things here.

00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:17.686 A:middle
Number one, in the beginning the

00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:18.616 A:middle
board was flat.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.106 A:middle
I had to rotate it so it was in

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:21.236 A:middle
a position where we could view

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:21.436 A:middle
it.

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:24.906 A:middle
As we execute more lines of

00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:26.846 A:middle
code, it doesn't rotate back to

00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:27.896 A:middle
its original position.

00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:29.846 A:middle
This is pretty good because I

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:31.366 A:middle
could write lines of code to

00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:32.456 A:middle
rotate it to the correct

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:33.976 A:middle
position, but this would involve

00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:34.506 A:middle
something called [inaudible],

00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:36.316 A:middle
and I don't think I'm quite

00:19:36.316 --> 00:19:37.866 A:middle
ready to learn that yet.

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:41.086 A:middle
The second reason it's good is

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:42.836 A:middle
because if the computer player

00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:45.196 A:middle
was allowed to play again, every

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:47.456 A:middle
time we executed new code it

00:19:47.456 --> 00:19:48.846 A:middle
would effectively get a do-over,

00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:50.036 A:middle
which would be a little unfair.

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:52.376 A:middle
Let's finish this up.

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:53.656 A:middle
I think I can take the game home

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:55.000 A:middle
from here.

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:08.156 A:middle
Is that the right move?

00:20:08.726 --> 00:20:09.616 A:middle
That's great.

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:16.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.386 --> 00:20:18.376 A:middle
You can see the game has

00:20:18.376 --> 00:20:20.126 A:middle
highlighted my winning move by

00:20:20.126 --> 00:20:21.826 A:middle
placing three red circles.

00:20:23.196 --> 00:20:24.276 A:middle
That's not too fancy.

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:25.356 A:middle
I'm looking for something which

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:26.316 A:middle
really makes it feel like a

00:20:26.316 --> 00:20:27.066 A:middle
celebration.

00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:29.126 A:middle
So I've been working on a new

00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:30.146 A:middle
version of the UI.

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:32.446 A:middle
In a traditional development

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:33.806 A:middle
environment, you would have to

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:35.426 A:middle
set up a complex harness to

00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:37.156 A:middle
automatically play you deep into

00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:39.446 A:middle
the game or whatever the API was

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.186 A:middle
you were using so that we could

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.556 A:middle
test out something that happened

00:20:43.156 --> 00:20:44.306 A:middle
later on in the program.

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.636 A:middle
But in a playground, because I'm

00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:48.636 A:middle
able to execute step-by-step, I

00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.986 A:middle
can play it manually to the end

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.356 A:middle
of the game and then write new

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:52.916 A:middle
lines of code to update

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.426 A:middle
whatever's going on at that

00:20:54.426 --> 00:20:54.696 A:middle
point.

00:20:55.356 --> 00:20:56.206 A:middle
Let's do that now.

00:21:01.316 --> 00:21:03.216 A:middle
I've prepared a new effect for

00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:04.176 A:middle
the end of the game using a

00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:05.046 A:middle
particle system.

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:07.866 A:middle
Let's use Shift Return to

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:08.546 A:middle
execute it.

00:21:09.626 --> 00:21:12.216 A:middle
Boom. And that feels much more

00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:12.806 A:middle
like a win.

00:21:14.516 --> 00:21:17.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:18.066 --> 00:21:19.486 A:middle
So let's review what we've just

00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:19.706 A:middle
seen.

00:21:20.736 --> 00:21:22.956 A:middle
By running step-by-step we can

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:24.956 A:middle
explore an idea a line at a

00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:25.446 A:middle
time.

00:21:26.356 --> 00:21:27.416 A:middle
This enables us to have a

00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:29.756 A:middle
conversation between code and

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:30.146 A:middle
data.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.596 A:middle
Every time we learn a new fact

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.536 A:middle
we can write the next line of

00:21:34.536 --> 00:21:36.416 A:middle
code to explore it a little

00:21:36.416 --> 00:21:36.736 A:middle
more.

00:21:37.706 --> 00:21:39.506 A:middle
We can use Shift Return to keep

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.216 A:middle
our hands on the keyboard and

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.306 A:middle
our brains in the zone.

00:21:43.246 --> 00:21:45.536 A:middle
And finally, by adding a dynamic

00:21:45.536 --> 00:21:47.376 A:middle
live view to a playground, we

00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:48.966 A:middle
can create a second view of our

00:21:48.966 --> 00:21:50.616 A:middle
model and we can seamlessly

00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:52.786 A:middle
shift between manipulating it in

00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:54.556 A:middle
a graphical environment and

00:21:54.556 --> 00:21:55.286 A:middle
using code.

00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:59.356 A:middle
So whether you're a beginner,

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.436 A:middle
just learning about new Apple

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.436 A:middle
just learning about new Apple

00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:05.316 A:middle
APIs or an experienced

00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:07.846 A:middle
programmer trying to sketch out

00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:09.806 A:middle
the bones of their next great

00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:13.426 A:middle
app, the next time you have a

00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:16.056 A:middle
coding inspiration we invite you

00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:17.536 A:middle
to get started with a

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.186 A:middle
playground.

00:22:18.656 --> 00:22:23.126 A:middle
Just in case you're still

00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:25.536 A:middle
looking for ideas I've got three

00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:26.086 A:middle
right here.

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:29.446 A:middle
Number one if you're creating

00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.696 A:middle
your own API, one of the best

00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:33.716 A:middle
ways to showcase it is to create

00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:35.976 A:middle
a follow along tutorial for your

00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:36.146 A:middle
API.

00:22:36.366 --> 00:22:37.956 A:middle
Users can execute the code

00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:40.006 A:middle
step-by-step and see in real

00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:42.586 A:middle
time what it does.

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:45.566 A:middle
Number two you can download and

00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:47.176 A:middle
explore some publicly available

00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:48.976 A:middle
data using the playground

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:52.016 A:middle
step-by-step to drill down into

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:52.586 A:middle
your data.

00:22:53.816 --> 00:22:55.806 A:middle
You could get this from maps,

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
from local government, or

00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:59.326 A:middle
perhaps a class project.

00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:03.036 A:middle
Finally, like I did, you could

00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:04.976 A:middle
create a game or an animation.

00:23:05.836 --> 00:23:09.286 A:middle
Start off simple using SpriteKit

00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.476 A:middle
or SyncKit and line by line

00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:13.346 A:middle
enhance it until it's completely

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:13.606 A:middle
awesome.

00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:18.106 A:middle
So I hope we've shown you today

00:23:18.616 --> 00:23:20.626 A:middle
that playgrounds are not a toy.

00:23:21.146 --> 00:23:23.156 A:middle
They're fun but they're serious

00:23:23.156 --> 00:23:23.466 A:middle
fun.

00:23:26.726 --> 00:23:28.296 A:middle
They allow you to explore code

00:23:28.296 --> 00:23:30.006 A:middle
and data interactively.

00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:31.766 A:middle
This is great whether you've

00:23:31.766 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
downloaded an unknown snippet of

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:35.246 A:middle
JSON using a rest API from the

00:23:35.246 --> 00:23:37.176 A:middle
Internet, or if you're dealing

00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:38.576 A:middle
with hundreds of thousands or

00:23:38.576 --> 00:23:40.886 A:middle
millions of lines of data for a

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.236 A:middle
machine learning application.

00:23:42.516 --> 00:23:44.026 A:middle
And to find out more about that

00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:45.486 A:middle
use case I encourage you to

00:23:45.486 --> 00:23:47.256 A:middle
download and watch the Create ML

00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:49.796 A:middle
sessions in your WWDC

00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:50.526 A:middle
application.

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.466 A:middle
Secondly there's really no

00:23:53.466 --> 00:23:55.236 A:middle
better way to learn how to use

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:56.316 A:middle
Apple APIs.

00:23:56.906 --> 00:23:57.736 A:middle
Whether you're just getting

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:59.946 A:middle
started or your trying out a new

00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
API, which you've learned about

00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
API, which you've learned about

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:04.606 A:middle
at this WWDC.

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.436 A:middle
You don't just have to use

00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:07.156 A:middle
Apple's APIs.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.546 A:middle
You can also import your own

00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:11.016 A:middle
frameworks into playgrounds.

00:24:11.346 --> 00:24:12.436 A:middle
And one of the best ways to

00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:14.666 A:middle
showcase this is to create

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.146 A:middle
custom representations of your

00:24:16.146 --> 00:24:18.546 A:middle
data types allowing developers

00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.036 A:middle
to view the most relevant

00:24:20.036 --> 00:24:21.556 A:middle
information at a glance.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:24.216 A:middle
And to talk more about these two

00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:26.166 A:middle
advanced concepts, I'd like to

00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:27.616 A:middle
invite TJ to the stage.

[ Applause ]

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:37.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alex.

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.476 A:middle
My name is TJ Usiyan and I'm an

00:24:40.476 --> 00:24:41.286 A:middle
Xcode Engineer.

00:24:42.126 --> 00:24:43.546 A:middle
By the time I finish my section,

00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:45.096 A:middle
I'm sure that all of you will

00:24:45.096 --> 00:24:47.216 A:middle
agree that every librarian

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:49.266 A:middle
framework that you ship will and

00:24:49.266 --> 00:24:50.916 A:middle
can be improved with the

00:24:50.916 --> 00:24:52.166 A:middle
addition of a playground.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.976 A:middle
Playgrounds provide a richer

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:58.616 A:middle
experience when providing

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:01.236 A:middle
readme's, tutorials, and general

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:01.236 A:middle
readme's, tutorials, and general

00:25:01.236 --> 00:25:02.856 A:middle
API documentation.

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:06.556 A:middle
One of the ways that they can do

00:25:06.556 --> 00:25:08.686 A:middle
this is by, as Alex said,

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:09.926 A:middle
providing your own

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
representation in playgrounds.

00:25:12.436 --> 00:25:14.116 A:middle
I'm going to cover all of these

00:25:14.116 --> 00:25:16.656 A:middle
things starting with Custom

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:18.236 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible,

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.636 A:middle
which will allow you to provide

00:25:20.716 --> 00:25:22.906 A:middle
custom representations of your

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:25.956 A:middle
types in playgrounds so that

00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:27.776 A:middle
users can get a nice summary.

00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:31.016 A:middle
I'll follow that up with how to

00:25:31.016 --> 00:25:33.646 A:middle
import your frameworks into

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.766 A:middle
playgrounds.

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:37.476 A:middle
And finally, I'll cover a little

00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:38.746 A:middle
bit of troubleshooting tips for

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:40.156 A:middle
when things don't go exactly as

00:25:40.156 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
you'd expect.

00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:45.426 A:middle
Let's start with Playground

00:25:45.646 --> 00:25:46.526 A:middle
Display Convertible.

00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:50.816 A:middle
So as you know, when a user

00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
types in a line of code values

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:56.726 A:middle
show up on the right hand side

00:25:56.726 --> 00:25:57.736 A:middle
in the result sidebar.

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:01.256 A:middle
For types that are no optimized

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:01.256 A:middle
For types that are no optimized

00:26:01.256 --> 00:26:03.466 A:middle
for playgrounds there are two

00:26:03.466 --> 00:26:04.716 A:middle
ways that playgrounds will

00:26:04.716 --> 00:26:05.976 A:middle
generate this description.

00:26:06.956 --> 00:26:09.296 A:middle
For types that do not conform to

00:26:09.296 --> 00:26:12.236 A:middle
Custom String Convertible, we

00:26:13.026 --> 00:26:14.666 A:middle
will create a structured

00:26:14.666 --> 00:26:16.686 A:middle
representation using the Swift

00:26:16.686 --> 00:26:16.856 A:middle
type.

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:19.436 A:middle
For types that do conform to

00:26:19.436 --> 00:26:20.746 A:middle
Custom String Convertible, we

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.256 A:middle
will use the result of calling

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:23.806 A:middle
descriptions.

00:26:24.276 --> 00:26:27.906 A:middle
When this isn't enough sometimes

00:26:27.906 --> 00:26:31.716 A:middle
your users will tap on the Quick

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
Look button on the right-hand

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:33.576 A:middle
side.

00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:40.026 A:middle
They will also tap or click on

00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
the Inline Results button.

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:47.636 A:middle
When they do this a custom

00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:49.316 A:middle
representation will show up.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.556 A:middle
Often a textual representation.

00:26:52.676 --> 00:26:54.566 A:middle
And for many types this is

00:26:54.566 --> 00:26:56.106 A:middle
perfectly enough but sometimes

00:26:56.206 --> 00:26:58.896 A:middle
maybe you would like to return a

00:26:58.896 --> 00:26:59.236 A:middle
number.

00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:03.336 A:middle
This is still text though and

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:06.056 A:middle
there are times when text isn't

00:27:06.056 --> 00:27:07.066 A:middle
going to be enough and you would

00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:08.456 A:middle
like to return something

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.446 A:middle
graphical, maybe a picture.

00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:14.656 A:middle
The way to control what you

00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:17.706 A:middle
return is to implement Custom

00:27:17.706 --> 00:27:19.226 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible,

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:22.936 A:middle
a new protocol introduced in

00:27:22.936 --> 00:27:26.506 A:middle
Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.

00:27:27.256 --> 00:27:29.436 A:middle
It replaces Custom Playground

00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:31.046 A:middle
Quick Lookable, which was

00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:32.686 A:middle
deprecated in the same versions.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.756 A:middle
Let's take a look at conformance

00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:39.016 A:middle
right now.

00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:41.926 A:middle
You can see here that conforming

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:44.356 A:middle
involves only returning one

00:27:44.356 --> 00:27:45.426 A:middle
property, Playground

00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:45.856 A:middle
Description.

00:27:46.546 --> 00:27:47.946 A:middle
Playground Description is of

00:27:47.946 --> 00:27:49.916 A:middle
type Any, which means you can

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:51.456 A:middle
return anything that you feel

00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:54.686 A:middle
best describes your value.

00:27:56.496 --> 00:27:58.256 A:middle
Now, there are certain types

00:27:58.256 --> 00:27:59.416 A:middle
that have specialized

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
representations already and

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
representations already and

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:04.296 A:middle
those are provided by Apple.

00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:06.856 A:middle
Here's a list of the types with

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:08.716 A:middle
specialized representations as

00:28:08.716 --> 00:28:11.786 A:middle
of Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.676 A:middle
The types on the left have a

00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:15.936 A:middle
particularly textual

00:28:15.936 --> 00:28:16.766 A:middle
representation.

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.456 A:middle
The types on the right have a

00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.646 A:middle
graphical representation.

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:23.586 A:middle
I invite you to try each of

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:25.686 A:middle
these and decide which best

00:28:25.686 --> 00:28:27.326 A:middle
represents your value in a

00:28:27.326 --> 00:28:27.926 A:middle
playground.

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.486 A:middle
Once you've done this you'll

00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:34.196 A:middle
want to ship all of your types,

00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:35.636 A:middle
and your values, and your API to

00:28:35.726 --> 00:28:36.486 A:middle
your users.

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:40.366 A:middle
I'm going to show you how to

00:28:41.216 --> 00:28:42.646 A:middle
import your own custom

00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.256 A:middle
frameworks into playgrounds

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:46.026 A:middle
alongside Apple frameworks.

00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:50.616 A:middle
Typically, when you build a

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:52.846 A:middle
single framework in a project,

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:55.016 A:middle
that framework will end up in

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.386 A:middle
the Built Products Directory.

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.076 A:middle
When you want to import it into

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.076 A:middle
When you want to import it into

00:29:00.076 --> 00:29:02.386 A:middle
a playground, that is where the

00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:04.146 A:middle
playground will work.

00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:05.436 A:middle
The simplest way to make sure

00:29:05.436 --> 00:29:06.376 A:middle
that your playground will see

00:29:06.376 --> 00:29:08.886 A:middle
your framework is to add the

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:10.356 A:middle
playground to your project.

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.936 A:middle
This is the strategy that I

00:29:12.936 --> 00:29:15.016 A:middle
suggest for simple projects

00:29:15.016 --> 00:29:16.316 A:middle
where you have access the

00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:17.836 A:middle
project and are willing to edit

00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:18.466 A:middle
it.

00:29:18.726 --> 00:29:19.766 A:middle
This is what that would look

00:29:19.766 --> 00:29:20.976 A:middle
like in the Project Navigator.

00:29:25.086 --> 00:29:26.956 A:middle
Once you've added this project,

00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:28.106 A:middle
or once you've added this

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:29.466 A:middle
playground to your project, I

00:29:29.466 --> 00:29:31.076 A:middle
have a little bit of advice.

00:29:31.076 --> 00:29:34.036 A:middle
Remember building is very much

00:29:34.036 --> 00:29:36.666 A:middle
like walking in that you have to

00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:38.716 A:middle
remember to build before you

00:29:39.376 --> 00:29:39.506 A:middle
run.

00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:45.676 A:middle
Now, sometimes you have more

00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:47.576 A:middle
than one project, more than one

00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:49.526 A:middle
framework, maybe you have two,

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:54.026 A:middle
three, four, and in this case

00:29:54.306 --> 00:29:55.596 A:middle
that Built Products Directory

00:29:55.596 --> 00:29:57.076 A:middle
situation that I just described

00:29:57.226 --> 00:29:58.656 A:middle
is actually multiplied.

00:29:58.656 --> 00:29:59.986 A:middle
There are multiple Build Product

00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:00.736 A:middle
Directories if you have separate

00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:00.736 A:middle
Directories if you have separate

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
projects.

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.636 A:middle
This can be a problem when you

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:05.836 A:middle
want to import your code into a

00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:06.576 A:middle
playground.

00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:08.676 A:middle
The simplest way to address this

00:30:08.726 --> 00:30:11.006 A:middle
is to add each project to a

00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:13.656 A:middle
workspace, a single workspace,

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:15.486 A:middle
and then when you build each

00:30:16.136 --> 00:30:19.166 A:middle
project, those frameworks will

00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:21.836 A:middle
end up in that one Built

00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:23.476 A:middle
Products Directory for your

00:30:23.476 --> 00:30:24.056 A:middle
workspace.

00:30:24.396 --> 00:30:26.656 A:middle
After that just add the

00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:28.696 A:middle
playground to that workspace and

00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:29.786 A:middle
everything should be fine.

00:30:31.376 --> 00:30:32.746 A:middle
This is what that should look

00:30:32.746 --> 00:30:35.096 A:middle
like in the project navigator.

00:30:36.636 --> 00:30:39.506 A:middle
Now, let's say you've done this,

00:30:39.506 --> 00:30:41.026 A:middle
you followed my instructions and

00:30:41.026 --> 00:30:43.026 A:middle
things don't work out how you

00:30:43.026 --> 00:30:43.476 A:middle
expect.

00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:46.226 A:middle
You say, "TJ lied to me."

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:49.876 A:middle
You're going to want to check

00:30:49.876 --> 00:30:51.176 A:middle
the Built Products Directory to

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:52.556 A:middle
make sure that everything ends

00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:54.026 A:middle
up there as you expect.

00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:57.386 A:middle
Here's how you can do that.

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.266 A:middle
You're going to go to File,

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.266 A:middle
You're going to go to File,

00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:05.666 A:middle
Project Settings, and then we're

00:31:05.666 --> 00:31:07.966 A:middle
going to click the Advanced

00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:09.866 A:middle
button.

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:12.006 A:middle
On this screen in light gray

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.356 A:middle
we'll see that there is a

00:31:13.606 --> 00:31:16.986 A:middle
Products destination.

00:31:17.516 --> 00:31:19.086 A:middle
You'll click on that and that

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.516 A:middle
should bring you directly to the

00:31:20.516 --> 00:31:22.456 A:middle
Built Products Director for the

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:23.966 A:middle
project that you have open.

00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:28.006 A:middle
This is what that should look

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:28.856 A:middle
like in Finder.

00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:32.126 A:middle
Now let's see all of this

00:31:32.596 --> 00:31:33.796 A:middle
brought together in a demo.

00:31:35.516 --> 00:31:40.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:43.476 --> 00:31:45.576 A:middle
Now those of you who know me

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.986 A:middle
know that I have a pretty

00:31:48.986 --> 00:31:50.236 A:middle
enduring interest in music.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:53.136 A:middle
I'm actually so interested in

00:31:53.136 --> 00:31:55.926 A:middle
music that I have found this new

00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:57.646 A:middle
notation, well new to me

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.336 A:middle
notation, called Helmholtz

00:31:59.336 --> 00:31:59.806 A:middle
notation.

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
And I feel that many, many

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
And I feel that many, many

00:32:01.916 --> 00:32:03.036 A:middle
people should know about this

00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:03.826 A:middle
and it should be much more

00:32:03.826 --> 00:32:04.516 A:middle
widely used.

00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:06.836 A:middle
So I've created a framework to

00:32:06.836 --> 00:32:08.376 A:middle
share with other developers so

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:09.296 A:middle
that they can use it in their

00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:09.636 A:middle
code.

00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:11.446 A:middle
You can see here that I've

00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:13.796 A:middle
included a playground and I've

00:32:14.286 --> 00:32:17.886 A:middle
also, as the result of extensive

00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:20.366 A:middle
research on Wikipedia written up

00:32:20.486 --> 00:32:22.846 A:middle
a little playground that

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:23.946 A:middle
describes the notation.

00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:26.746 A:middle
Follow it, followed by a few

00:32:26.746 --> 00:32:28.376 A:middle
values so that we can see the

00:32:28.376 --> 00:32:30.746 A:middle
results on the right hand side

00:32:31.586 --> 00:32:32.486 A:middle
with the notation.

00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:36.946 A:middle
If I render this documentation

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:41.476 A:middle
this will all end up in Pros

00:32:41.476 --> 00:32:43.136 A:middle
with the links highlighted in

00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:45.116 A:middle
blue just as Tibet spoke of.

00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:51.026 A:middle
And before I build, or before I

00:32:51.026 --> 00:32:55.126 A:middle
run I'm going to build.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:58.716 A:middle
Then let's run our playground,

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.276 A:middle
yay.

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.276 A:middle
yay.

[ Applause ]

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:07.246 A:middle
You can see here that on the

00:33:07.246 --> 00:33:08.506 A:middle
right-hand side in the results I

00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:09.906 A:middle
have this interesting notation.

00:33:10.476 --> 00:33:11.386 A:middle
I really think that this

00:33:11.386 --> 00:33:14.376 A:middle
notation is interesting because

00:33:14.846 --> 00:33:15.906 A:middle
the lower pitches are

00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:17.296 A:middle
represented by uppercase

00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
letters.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.196 A:middle
The higher pitches are

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:20.776 A:middle
represented by lowercase letters

00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:22.746 A:middle
and the exact octave is

00:33:22.746 --> 00:33:24.526 A:middle
indicated by either commas or

00:33:24.526 --> 00:33:27.566 A:middle
apostrophes, the count thereof.

00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:31.036 A:middle
Now, hopefully you all get this

00:33:31.036 --> 00:33:32.826 A:middle
looking at this notation, and

00:33:32.996 --> 00:33:34.046 A:middle
hopefully I've explained it very

00:33:34.046 --> 00:33:35.466 A:middle
well, but I've actually had some

00:33:35.466 --> 00:33:37.266 A:middle
trouble with some of the people

00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:37.906 A:middle
I'm tutoring.

00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:40.246 A:middle
They're not taking to it as well

00:33:40.246 --> 00:33:40.766 A:middle
as I'd like.

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.906 A:middle
So I actually have a separate

00:33:43.026 --> 00:33:44.746 A:middle
framework that I've created with

00:33:44.746 --> 00:33:46.356 A:middle
a keyboard visualization that I

00:33:46.356 --> 00:33:49.106 A:middle
think will really help them ease

00:33:49.106 --> 00:33:50.056 A:middle
into this notation.

00:33:50.866 --> 00:33:53.046 A:middle
Since I want to use that, I'm

00:33:53.046 --> 00:33:53.906 A:middle
actually going to create a

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:55.316 A:middle
separate playground in a

00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:56.796 A:middle
workspace where I can import

00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.996 A:middle
both frameworks without changing

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.056 A:middle
either of the frameworks.

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.056 A:middle
either of the frameworks.

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:03.566 A:middle
So to do that I'm going to

00:34:03.566 --> 00:34:07.776 A:middle
quickly close this, I'm going to

00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:13.806 A:middle
create a brand new workspace by

00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:18.505 A:middle
going to File, New Work Space,

00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:22.206 A:middle
and I'm going to name this

00:34:22.266 --> 00:34:22.686 A:middle
Tutoring.

00:34:23.286 --> 00:34:25.815 A:middle
Just put that on the desktop.

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:32.735 A:middle
Then I'm going to add each

00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:35.815 A:middle
framework by going to File, Add

00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:36.326 A:middle
Files.

00:34:36.956 --> 00:34:39.306 A:middle
I'm going to start with

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:41.996 A:middle
Helmholtz, my framework that I

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:45.565 A:middle
just had open, then File, right

00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:48.505 A:middle
there, Keyboard.

00:34:52.775 --> 00:34:54.315 A:middle
Then I'm going to add a new

00:34:54.315 --> 00:34:56.065 A:middle
playground by going to File,

00:34:56.656 --> 00:34:58.176 A:middle
New, Playground.

00:35:02.316 --> 00:35:04.196 A:middle
A blank playground is fine.

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:08.196 A:middle
My Playground is a fine name, a

00:35:08.196 --> 00:35:09.046 A:middle
fine as name as any.

00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:12.936 A:middle
I'm going to start by importing

00:35:14.396 --> 00:35:17.736 A:middle
Helmholtz, and My Keyboard.

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:25.676 A:middle
After that I'm just going to

00:35:25.676 --> 00:35:28.376 A:middle
quickly do a little test to make

00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:31.376 A:middle
sure that pitches show up as I

00:35:31.376 --> 00:35:31.776 A:middle
expect.

00:35:32.836 --> 00:35:35.426 A:middle
I'm going to build each of my

00:35:35.426 --> 00:35:36.166 A:middle
frameworks.

00:35:37.036 --> 00:35:38.586 A:middle
I'm going to make sure to choose

00:35:38.586 --> 00:35:39.976 A:middle
each one from the schemes.

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:41.816 A:middle
Later on I might want to make a

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:43.316 A:middle
separate scheme that builds both

00:35:43.316 --> 00:35:45.256 A:middle
of these projects in one go, but

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.876 A:middle
I don't have time on stage right

00:35:46.876 --> 00:35:47.126 A:middle
now.

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:51.696 A:middle
And then I'm going to run My

00:35:51.696 --> 00:35:52.476 A:middle
Playground in it.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:53.766 A:middle
Everything works as expected.

00:35:54.276 --> 00:35:57.186 A:middle
But again this visualization is

00:35:57.186 --> 00:35:57.786 A:middle
not helping.

00:35:57.896 --> 00:35:59.016 A:middle
I have some younger students who

00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:01.306 A:middle
have only seen a piano, so I

00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:01.306 A:middle
have only seen a piano, so I

00:36:01.306 --> 00:36:03.206 A:middle
have a little snippet here that

00:36:04.836 --> 00:36:08.906 A:middle
quickly creates a view in

00:36:08.906 --> 00:36:09.876 A:middle
playground description,

00:36:10.296 --> 00:36:12.116 A:middle
configures it, and actually I

00:36:12.216 --> 00:36:13.656 A:middle
have one more line that I wanted

00:36:13.656 --> 00:36:14.526 A:middle
to write on stage.

00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:19.336 A:middle
Custom text equals description.

00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:22.476 A:middle
And after I configure my view

00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:24.166 A:middle
I'm going to return it.

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:25.076 A:middle
Simple as that.

00:36:25.826 --> 00:36:27.086 A:middle
Made much simpler by the fact

00:36:27.086 --> 00:36:27.966 A:middle
that I happen to have a

00:36:27.966 --> 00:36:29.336 A:middle
framework already on hand.

00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:31.826 A:middle
Now, I want to run this line,

00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:34.426 A:middle
line 4 again, but with my

00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:35.036 A:middle
conformant.

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:36.736 A:middle
So I'm going to reset this

00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:38.406 A:middle
playground by clicking on the

00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.976 A:middle
stop button down here.

00:36:44.486 --> 00:36:45.976 A:middle
And then I'm going to rerun this

00:36:45.976 --> 00:36:49.516 A:middle
entire playground after I add my

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:49.976 A:middle
inline result.

00:36:54.126 --> 00:36:55.056 A:middle
And you can see here --

[ Applause ]

00:36:56.516 --> 00:37:02.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:03.066 --> 00:37:03.816 A:middle
You can see here that I have a

00:37:03.816 --> 00:37:05.846 A:middle
nice visualization of a keyboard

00:37:06.176 --> 00:37:07.806 A:middle
that my students can recognize

00:37:08.086 --> 00:37:10.826 A:middle
along with the notation that I'm

00:37:10.826 --> 00:37:11.566 A:middle
trying to teach.

00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:18.976 A:middle
Now let's cover or let's go back

00:37:18.976 --> 00:37:21.976 A:middle
over what we've learned today.

00:37:25.136 --> 00:37:27.606 A:middle
Tibet covered the fundamentals

00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:30.436 A:middle
of playgrounds, the layout and

00:37:30.696 --> 00:37:32.376 A:middle
playground markup syntax.

00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:35.016 A:middle
Alex explained the power of

00:37:35.016 --> 00:37:36.846 A:middle
running step-by-step in

00:37:36.846 --> 00:37:37.466 A:middle
playgrounds.

00:37:37.906 --> 00:37:39.306 A:middle
And I covered Custom Playground

00:37:39.306 --> 00:37:41.266 A:middle
Display Convertible and

00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:42.686 A:middle
importing your own code.

00:37:43.666 --> 00:37:46.116 A:middle
So hopefully, now that I've

00:37:46.196 --> 00:37:47.996 A:middle
given this session and all of us

00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:49.696 A:middle
have -- and we've explained

00:37:49.736 --> 00:37:51.686 A:middle
playgrounds and the power that

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:55.526 A:middle
you can get, we hope to see that

00:37:55.526 --> 00:37:58.656 A:middle
every project has a playground

00:37:58.806 --> 00:37:59.346 A:middle
next year.

00:38:03.186 --> 00:38:04.966 A:middle
If you have any questions please

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:06.226 A:middle
feel free to visit us in the

00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:07.676 A:middle
labs and we'll see you next

00:38:07.676 --> 00:38:07.976 A:middle
year.
