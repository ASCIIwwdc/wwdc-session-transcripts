[ Music ]

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:20.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:21.976 A:middle
Welcome to our --

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:23.066 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.426 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:23.906 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:25.746 A:middle
It's great to be here.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:26.986 A:middle
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:29.026 A:middle
Welcome to our session on

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:31.386 A:middle
Introducing Podcast Analytics.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.196 A:middle
I'm James Boggs.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.386 A:middle
I manage the Business Team for

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:37.016 A:middle
Apple Podcasts and Siri Audio

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:39.026 A:middle
Briefs, and we've got a great

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:40.096 A:middle
session planned for you today.

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:41.116 A:middle
First, I'm going to share some

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:43.456 A:middle
details of our podcast business

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:45.086 A:middle
over the last year, including

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.136 A:middle
some very interesting and

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.486 A:middle
exciting milestones.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.306 A:middle
Then I'm going to welcome Anne

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:52.776 A:middle
Wootton from our Engineering

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.356 A:middle
Team to the stage, and she's

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:55.326 A:middle
going to take us through some

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.976 A:middle
updates to Podcast app for iOS

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:58.266 A:middle
12.


00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:03.176 A:middle
After Anne, Alec Reitter will

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.046 A:middle
take us through a demo of

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:08.166 A:middle
Podcast Analytics, and then we

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.296 A:middle
will finish up with Anne sharing

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:12.796 A:middle
some requirements and taking a

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
look at resources available to

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.396 A:middle
podcast makers.

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.746 A:middle
First off, an update on our

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:20.106 A:middle
podcast business.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.676 A:middle
Well, we're just shy of the 13th

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.756 A:middle
Anniversary of the launch of

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:28.026 A:middle
iTunes 4.9.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:29.926 A:middle
That's the moment when we took

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.166 A:middle
podcasts mainstream for the

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.866 A:middle
first time, and podcasts have

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:36.426 A:middle
come a long way since then.

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.936 A:middle
Our content catalogue has never

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:40.116 A:middle
been more entertaining,

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:42.576 A:middle
inspiring, and educational, and

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:43.746 A:middle
we've never reached more

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:46.036 A:middle
listeners around the world than

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:46.956 A:middle
we do right now.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.076 A:middle
We're reaching them with some

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.896 A:middle
great programming like Sandra

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:52.706 A:middle
from Gimlet.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.866 A:middle
This is a brand new program from

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.266 A:middle
one of the leading independent

00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.936 A:middle
podcast networks out of New

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.676 A:middle
York, and it stars some really


00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.676 A:middle
York, and it stars some really

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.706 A:middle
big talent, Kristen Wiig, Alia

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.276 A:middle
Shawkat, and Ethan Hawk.

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.626 A:middle
It's a really fun scripted

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
comedy drama about the inner

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:11.226 A:middle
workings and quirks of a virtual

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:12.946 A:middle
assistant.

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:17.066 A:middle
Los Angeles-based Wondery is one

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.906 A:middle
of adventure capital backed

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:20.786 A:middle
network startups working in

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:22.986 A:middle
podcast today, and last year,

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:24.696 A:middle
Wondery collaborated with the LA

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.676 A:middle
Times to produce the thrilling

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.146 A:middle
true crime story of a charming

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:31.736 A:middle
but sociopathic con man, Dirty

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:32.106 A:middle
John.

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.686 A:middle
The Hollywood-style production

00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:36.686 A:middle
value is powerful investigative

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:39.156 A:middle
journalism and remarkable

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:40.556 A:middle
storytelling, which is just

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:41.186 A:middle
riveting.

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.756 A:middle
It drove this show to the top of

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:44.736 A:middle
the charts in the US several of

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
the markets around the world.

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.456 A:middle
If you haven't had a chance to

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.006 A:middle
check it out, I recommend it.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.976 A:middle
It's a great binge.

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:54.096 A:middle
And of course, podcast fans

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:56.516 A:middle
everywhere are thrilled and

00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:58.986 A:middle
enjoying Oprah's Super Soul

00:02:58.986 --> 00:02:59.896 A:middle
Conversations.

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.496 A:middle
This is the audio instalment of


00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.496 A:middle
This is the audio instalment of

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:04.396 A:middle
the Queen of Talks iconic

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:06.776 A:middle
interview franchise, and we were

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:08.256 A:middle
overjoyed to have Oprah on Apple

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:08.946 A:middle
Podcast.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.666 A:middle
These examples are just three of

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
the more than 550,000 shows

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.406 A:middle
available today on Apple

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.026 A:middle
Podcast.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.246 A:middle
That's quite a bit more content

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:21.476 A:middle
to listen to than the original

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.416 A:middle
3,000 programs we launched with

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.966 A:middle
back in 2005.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.456 A:middle
We're continually refreshing and

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:29.836 A:middle
managing our directory,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.846 A:middle
automatically retiring shows

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
which become technically

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:34.666 A:middle
unavailable or those that run

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:36.696 A:middle
afoul of our directory content

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.766 A:middle
guidelines, such as those with

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.026 A:middle
spammy content or shows seeking

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.786 A:middle
to manipulate our top charts.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:43.916 A:middle
Don't do that.

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:44.976 A:middle
Just please don't do that.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:46.856 A:middle
At the same time as we're

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:48.506 A:middle
managing the directory, we're

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:50.006 A:middle
accepting thousands of new

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:51.196 A:middle
submissions per week.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.286 A:middle
That way, our catalogue is

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.236 A:middle
continually refreshed, and our

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:56.546 A:middle
users around the world can

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.976 A:middle
always find something great to

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.046 A:middle
listen to.


00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.046 A:middle
listen to.

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:03.646 A:middle
Amongst those more than 550,000

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.886 A:middle
active shows, we have over 18.5

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.956 A:middle
million episodes of content.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.406 A:middle
That's more than 8 million hours

00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:12.066 A:middle
of programming.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:13.496 A:middle
So, you'd better, better start

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:14.226 A:middle
listening, better start

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:14.636 A:middle
bingeing.

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:18.366 A:middle
As a reminder, Apple Podcast is

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:21.065 A:middle
available in 155 countries.

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:22.456 A:middle
That's not only for the

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:24.626 A:middle
distribution of existing shows

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:26.076 A:middle
but for the submission and

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:27.706 A:middle
acceptance of new programming

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:28.926 A:middle
from each one of those markets.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.756 A:middle
The Podcast Directory serves an

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:34.746 A:middle
audience in all 155 of those

00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:36.756 A:middle
countries with content in more

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:38.086 A:middle
than 100 languages.

00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:40.176 A:middle
So, that means if you're a

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:42.436 A:middle
Korean native speaker, ex-pat,

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:44.896 A:middle
living in Toronto, you can find

00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:46.446 A:middle
some great audio programming

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:47.866 A:middle
from home right in Apple

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:50.116 A:middle
Podcast, and we're particularly

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
proud of this, particularly

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:52.826 A:middle
proud to have such a diverse

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:54.396 A:middle
catalogue and be one of the

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:56.626 A:middle
easiest ways to reach a global

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.376 A:middle
audience for audio programming

00:04:58.376 --> 00:04:59.626 A:middle
that there is.


00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:03.676 A:middle
The data from our beta version

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:05.616 A:middle
of Podcasts Analytics shows some

00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.566 A:middle
remarkable listener affinity and

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:08.096 A:middle
engagement.

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:10.926 A:middle
We looked at several hundred of

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:13.006 A:middle
our recent top episodes, those

00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:14.496 A:middle
with more than 7 days of

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.426 A:middle
playback data, and we found some

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:17.606 A:middle
really notable average

00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:18.226 A:middle
consumption.

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.196 A:middle
Of course, this data is

00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:21.066 A:middle
nonamized [phonetic] and

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:24.326 A:middle
aggregated and a sample, so no

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
personally identifiable

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:26.606 A:middle
information is included, and

00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:28.006 A:middle
it's not a comprehensive

00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:29.536 A:middle
statistic but interesting

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:30.146 A:middle
nonetheless.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:32.626 A:middle
It shows that once an episode is

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:35.286 A:middle
started, on average, about 80%

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:36.826 A:middle
of that episode content was

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:37.396 A:middle
consumed.

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:39.256 A:middle
This is great stuff and a real

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.336 A:middle
testament to the affinity and

00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:42.946 A:middle
engagement the podcast audience

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.576 A:middle
has with this high quality

00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:46.276 A:middle
content.

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:48.896 A:middle
Last fall, we successfully

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:50.886 A:middle
integrated more than 50,000

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:53.226 A:middle
iTunes U collections into Apple

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:53.976 A:middle
Podcasts.

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:56.196 A:middle
This is content from some of the

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:57.936 A:middle
world's best educational

00:05:57.936 --> 00:05:59.966 A:middle
institutions, including


00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.546 A:middle
developing iOS 11 apps with SWF

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:04.376 A:middle
from Stanford's Paul Haggerty.

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
Naturally, we're eager for the

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.006 A:middle
new instalment of this class

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:10.186 A:middle
series later this year.

00:06:10.856 --> 00:06:12.446 A:middle
As part of Apple Podcast,

00:06:12.686 --> 00:06:14.836 A:middle
teachers can now leverage the

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:17.016 A:middle
episode serial ordering support

00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:17.966 A:middle
in Podcast app.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.306 A:middle
They can reach a new broader

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:22.526 A:middle
audience of lifelong learners

00:06:22.526 --> 00:06:24.616 A:middle
around the world, and it can

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:27.266 A:middle
distribute the content on tvOS

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.306 A:middle
for the first time.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:32.296 A:middle
We're seeing some great use of

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:34.256 A:middle
modern podcast tags, which we

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.576 A:middle
introduced last year right here

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:38.336 A:middle
on stage at WWDC.

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:41.306 A:middle
Many podcasts include trailers

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:42.586 A:middle
to thematically introduce the

00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:44.346 A:middle
feel and sound of their show.

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
This is the best way really to

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.636 A:middle
launch a new podcast, and ESPN,

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.136 A:middle
for example, makes great use of

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:52.006 A:middle
trailers and, in addition, is

00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:53.636 A:middle
amongst the chart shopping shows

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:56.036 A:middle
that uses seasons and bonus

00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:56.576 A:middle
content.

00:06:57.246 --> 00:06:58.646 A:middle
This allows Jody Avragon

00:06:58.646 --> 00:06:59.416 A:middle
[phonetic] and the team to

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
easily present the thematically


00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
easily present the thematically

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:02.826 A:middle
different collections of

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:04.126 A:middle
episodes in each season.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.956 A:middle
In addition to seasons and bonus

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
content, 30 for 30 feeds their

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:11.756 A:middle
super fans with bonus episodes.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.596 A:middle
These complement the full season

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:14.166 A:middle
episodes.

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:17.556 A:middle
A best practice regarding bonus

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:18.776 A:middle
content is to make sure that

00:07:18.776 --> 00:07:20.966 A:middle
your bonus episodes are tagged

00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:22.496 A:middle
appropriately to the full season

00:07:22.496 --> 00:07:23.096 A:middle
episodes.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:24.386 A:middle
Just want to ensure proper

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:26.116 A:middle
ordering of the content in Apple

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:26.796 A:middle
Podcasts.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:28.916 A:middle
And of course, episode number,

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:31.026 A:middle
we're using this handy reference

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:33.146 A:middle
for your audience inside Podcast

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:33.366 A:middle
app.

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:35.366 A:middle
We're also making use of episode

00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:36.806 A:middle
numbers that you provide in your

00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:39.036 A:middle
RSS feed in Podcast Analytics.

has started to grow.

our own Apple Music Team.

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:14.496 A:middle
We're thrilled to celebrate the

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:16.416 A:middle
incredible milestone of 50

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.196 A:middle
billion episode downloads and

00:09:18.196 --> 00:09:20.366 A:middle
streams on Apple Podcasts since

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:21.336 A:middle
the launch of the service in

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:22.176 A:middle
2005.

00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:24.826 A:middle
With over 10.5 billion episode

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:26.456 A:middle
downloads and streaming plays in

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:30.046 A:middle
2016 and more than 13.7 billion

00:09:30.046 --> 00:09:31.876 A:middle
last year, the growth trajectory

00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:34.116 A:middle
of the platform is amazing.

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:37.256 A:middle
We're also thrilled that the

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:39.456 A:middle
shows that are driving all this

00:09:39.456 --> 00:09:41.156 A:middle
consumption are of such a high

00:09:41.156 --> 00:09:43.826 A:middle
quality, and it's a pleasure for

00:09:43.826 --> 00:09:45.056 A:middle
us to be able to champion this

00:09:45.056 --> 00:09:47.206 A:middle
content on top of our platform.

00:09:47.766 --> 00:09:49.156 A:middle
We celebrate the podcasts that

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:50.566 A:middle
contribute to this 50 billion

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:51.896 A:middle
milestone, and one show in

00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:53.946 A:middle
particular, "Stuff You Should

00:09:53.946 --> 00:09:55.716 A:middle
Know" from Atlantis How Stuff

00:09:55.716 --> 00:09:57.326 A:middle
Works Network, the first

00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:59.616 A:middle
podcast, an Apple podcast to

00:09:59.616 --> 00:10:01.836 A:middle
exceed 500 million downloads and


00:09:59.616 --> 00:10:01.836 A:middle
exceed 500 million downloads and

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:02.456 A:middle
streams.

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:04.446 A:middle
Wow! Congratulations to Chuck,

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:06.046 A:middle
Josh, Jerry, and the rest of the

00:10:06.046 --> 00:10:06.466 A:middle
team.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:07.056 A:middle
Well done!

00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:08.436 A:middle
We're looking forward to the

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.216 A:middle
next half billion downloads and

00:10:10.216 --> 00:10:10.666 A:middle
streams.

00:10:12.936 --> 00:10:14.826 A:middle
So, with that business update,

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.966 A:middle
let me welcome Anne to the stage

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:18.366 A:middle
to take us through our app.

00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:23.606 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:10:24.106 --> 00:10:26.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, James.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.626 A:middle
Thanks James, and hi.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:30.196 A:middle
I'm Anne, and I run Podcasts

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.076 A:middle
Engineering at Apple.

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:34.236 A:middle
Before we dive much deeper into

00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:35.536 A:middle
analytics, I want to highlight a

00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:37.066 A:middle
few of the latest updates to the

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:38.906 A:middle
podcast app.

00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
As you probably heard in

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:42.516 A:middle
yesterday's keynote, we are

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.976 A:middle
thrilled to be launching

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.846 A:middle
podcasts for Apple Watch this

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:46.166 A:middle
fall.

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:48.966 A:middle
It was one of the most requested

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.986 A:middle
features for Apple Watch and for

00:10:50.986 --> 00:10:51.396 A:middle
good reason.

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:54.146 A:middle
Between HomePod and Apple Watch,

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.806 A:middle
listening to podcasts has never

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:58.166 A:middle
been easier or more hands free.

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
We're also really excited to


00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
We're also really excited to

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.996 A:middle
share that we've enhanced our

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.366 A:middle
support for chapters in the

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:05.956 A:middle
podcast app.

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:07.556 A:middle
In the upcoming IRS release,

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:09.116 A:middle
we're extending full chapter

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.806 A:middle
support to MP3s.

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:13.486 A:middle
In addition to enabling

00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
podcasters to segment their

00:11:15.106 --> 00:11:17.266 A:middle
episodes into shorter discrete

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:19.086 A:middle
chapters, this functionality

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:21.316 A:middle
also includes chapter art that

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:22.816 A:middle
displays as the play head

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.426 A:middle
advances across chapters.

00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
So, podcasters can supplement

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.496 A:middle
their audio with visual content.

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:32.786 A:middle
In the upcoming iOS release,

00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:34.856 A:middle
we're also offering an improved

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:35.986 A:middle
experience for podcast

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:36.856 A:middle
notifications.

00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:38.996 A:middle
The new podcast notifications

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:40.696 A:middle
are grouped across shows and

00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:42.406 A:middle
episodes into a single

00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:45.266 A:middle
expandable stack that reduces

00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:48.596 A:middle
clutter on screen, and we also

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:50.876 A:middle
provide one-tap access to

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.596 A:middle
notification settings for all of

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:53.236 A:middle
your shows.

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.116 A:middle
That means if you only want to

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:56.536 A:middle
get notifications for your

00:11:56.536 --> 00:11:58.576 A:middle
favorite show, 99% invisible,

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
it's as simple as toggling the


00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
it's as simple as toggling the

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.426 A:middle
switches on this single settings

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:02.826 A:middle
page.

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:07.676 A:middle
So, last year, at WWDC, we

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:09.196 A:middle
announced that Apple would be

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.946 A:middle
launching Podcast Analytics for

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:11.696 A:middle
the first time.

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:13.856 A:middle
We were super excited to launch

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:16.506 A:middle
at the end of 2017, and Podcast

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:18.426 A:middle
Analytics is available in beta

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:20.846 A:middle
right now today to anyone with a

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.226 A:middle
podcast in our catalogue.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:26.136 A:middle
We know that this is a service

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.376 A:middle
that was long desired and speaks

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.626 A:middle
to a critical need in the

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:32.156 A:middle
industry as evidence by work

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:33.756 A:middle
like the remote audio data spec

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.586 A:middle
being spearheaded by NPR.

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.556 A:middle
So, it's important to us that we

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.326 A:middle
provide this anonymous data back

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:42.076 A:middle
to publishers to help them

00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:44.266 A:middle
better understand how their

00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:45.946 A:middle
audiences are consuming their

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:46.276 A:middle
audio.

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:49.156 A:middle
And all of the data and

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:51.576 A:middle
analytics is based on the use of

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.496 A:middle
the update Apple podcasts app

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:57.076 A:middle
from iOS 11 and iTunes 12.7.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.206 A:middle
We're collecting data only from

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:00.736 A:middle
those operating systems, Forward


00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:00.736 A:middle
those operating systems, Forward

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:02.656 A:middle
and the Analytic Stashboard

00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:04.296 A:middle
includes listening data from

00:13:04.296 --> 00:13:06.956 A:middle
HomePod, AppleTV, and will

00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:08.466 A:middle
include Apple Watch listening

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:11.326 A:middle
data starting in launch of S5.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.476 A:middle
As you know, privacy is really

00:13:15.476 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
important to Apple, and we are

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:19.156 A:middle
only showing aggregate data of

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:20.736 A:middle
those users who have agreed to

00:13:20.736 --> 00:13:22.996 A:middle
use the podcast app.

00:13:22.996 --> 00:13:25.356 A:middle
It is anonymous, not personally

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:28.246 A:middle
identifiable, not tied to your

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:29.896 A:middle
Apple ID, and we only reflect

00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:31.426 A:middle
the data points in aggregate

00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:32.456 A:middle
that we've collected from at

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:34.166 A:middle
least five unique devices.

00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:37.626 A:middle
And it couldn't be easier to get

00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:37.986 A:middle
started.

00:13:38.156 --> 00:13:39.466 A:middle
You don't need to write any

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
code, you don't need to use an

00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:42.416 A:middle
SDK, and it's totally free.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:44.636 A:middle
If you have a podcast, all you

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:46.796 A:middle
have to do is submit your feed

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.526 A:middle
to Podcast Connect after you

00:13:48.526 --> 00:13:51.046 A:middle
signed in, get it approved, get

00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:53.116 A:middle
some listeners, then check your

00:13:53.116 --> 00:13:54.446 A:middle
performance through the Podcast

00:13:54.446 --> 00:13:55.716 A:middle
Analytics dashboard.

00:13:57.656 --> 00:14:00.276 A:middle
Analytics reports the data from


00:13:57.656 --> 00:14:00.276 A:middle
Analytics reports the data from

00:14:00.276 --> 00:14:02.366 A:middle
unique devices that engage with

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:04.926 A:middle
the Podcasts app.

00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:06.166 A:middle
As my colleague, Alec, is about

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.596 A:middle
to show us from the Analytics

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.706 A:middle
Dashboard, publishers can access

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:11.886 A:middle
an overview that includes tables

00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:14.046 A:middle
and charts with data-like unique

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:15.556 A:middle
device counts for a selected

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:18.086 A:middle
period of time, total time

00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:20.586 A:middle
listened, time per device,

00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:23.146 A:middle
average consumption, top

00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:24.426 A:middle
countries, and more.

00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:28.816 A:middle
So, some of you may be familiar

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:30.306 A:middle
with our podcast, The Very

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:31.446 A:middle
Hungry Tourists.

00:14:32.036 --> 00:14:34.336 A:middle
They're back for season 2, and

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:35.736 A:middle
they even have some new cover

00:14:36.426 --> 00:14:37.196 A:middle
art.

00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:38.296 A:middle
Alec is going to take you on a

00:14:38.296 --> 00:14:39.656 A:middle
deeper dive of how to get the

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:42.176 A:middle
most out of analytics.

00:14:42.276 --> 00:14:43.666 A:middle
We're excited to continue

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:45.196 A:middle
providing key listening metrics

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:46.636 A:middle
for this industry, and we are

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:47.846 A:middle
listening to your feedback and

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:49.626 A:middle
continuing to improve the

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:50.096 A:middle
service.

00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:51.116 A:middle
So, thank you.

00:14:51.116 --> 00:14:52.256 A:middle
And with that, I'm going to hand

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:53.546 A:middle
it over to Alec to take us on a

00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:54.976 A:middle
tour of Podcast Analytics.

00:14:55.516 --> 00:15:03.736 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]


00:14:55.516 --> 00:15:03.736 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:04.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Anne.

00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:08.216 A:middle
So, podcasters, every day you're

00:15:08.216 --> 00:15:10.846 A:middle
hard at work making great shows

00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:12.416 A:middle
and episodes for people to enjoy

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:13.256 A:middle
all over the world.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:15.326 A:middle
But how much do you know about

00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:16.026 A:middle
your audience?

00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:19.276 A:middle
Do you know how many listeners

00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:20.986 A:middle
you have or how much they

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:21.386 A:middle
listen?

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:23.356 A:middle
Do you know where they are

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.236 A:middle
around the world?

00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:25.956 A:middle
What are their favorite

00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:26.516 A:middle
episodes?

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:28.966 A:middle
With Podcast Analytics, Apple

00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:31.146 A:middle
offers you transparency into how

00:15:31.146 --> 00:15:33.296 A:middle
your show is heard, so you can

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:34.666 A:middle
better understand your listeners

00:15:35.116 --> 00:15:36.106 A:middle
and create the best show for

00:15:36.106 --> 00:15:36.766 A:middle
your audience.

00:15:37.886 --> 00:15:39.076 A:middle
My name is Alec Reitter, and I'm

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:40.596 A:middle
going to do a walkthrough and

00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:42.306 A:middle
demo of Podcast Analytics.

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:44.616 A:middle
So, let's get started by heading

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:45.606 A:middle
to the login page.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:48.946 A:middle
When you see this bright purple

00:15:48.946 --> 00:15:50.316 A:middle
page, you know you've made it to

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.056 A:middle
the right place.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.156 A:middle
Here, we're going to login with

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:55.006 A:middle
the Apple ID that we used to

00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:56.926 A:middle
originally submit the podcast

00:15:56.926 --> 00:15:59.056 A:middle
feed to the Apple Podcast

00:15:59.056 --> 00:15:59.496 A:middle
catalogue.


00:16:01.296 --> 00:16:02.746 A:middle
Now, if you have any trouble,

00:16:02.746 --> 00:16:05.486 A:middle
such as you forget your password

00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.966 A:middle
for your Apple ID, or you don't

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.216 A:middle
know which Apple ID to use, or

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.656 A:middle
if after you've logged in you

00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:12.826 A:middle
don't see all the shows you

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:15.716 A:middle
expect to see, go to the top

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:17.086 A:middle
right corner of this page and

00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:18.196 A:middle
click on that question mark

00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:18.616 A:middle
icon.

00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:20.546 A:middle
That will take you to Resources

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.256 A:middle
and Help, and there you can find

00:16:22.256 --> 00:16:23.926 A:middle
Contact this Link, where people

00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:25.046 A:middle
can give you the assistance you

00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:25.256 A:middle
need.

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:27.896 A:middle
In this example, we're going to

00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:29.846 A:middle
use John Appleseed's login

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:30.486 A:middle
credentials.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.776 A:middle
So, let's login now and see what

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:35.086 A:middle
he sees when he enters Podcast

00:16:35.086 --> 00:16:35.506 A:middle
Analytics.

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:43.486 A:middle
So, this is the show's page.

00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:45.466 A:middle
Here, we see five shows for

00:16:45.466 --> 00:16:46.146 A:middle
John's account.

00:16:47.286 --> 00:16:50.796 A:middle
In this table, there are three

00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:52.316 A:middle
metrics, and we're going to take

00:16:52.316 --> 00:16:54.356 A:middle
a look at those in a minute, and

00:16:54.356 --> 00:16:56.426 A:middle
all of the data in this table is

00:16:56.426 --> 00:16:58.016 A:middle
driven by the date picker, which

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.106 A:middle
is in the top right corner.

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
Right now, it's set to the last


00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
Right now, it's set to the last

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.226 A:middle
60 days, and that is the

00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:02.656 A:middle
default.

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:05.126 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the top

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:06.925 A:middle
row for The Very Hungry

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:07.566 A:middle
Tourists.

00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:10.606 A:middle
Here, we can see the number of

00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:12.356 A:middle
unique devices for the last 60

00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:12.646 A:middle
days.

00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:14.986 A:middle
This answers the question, how

00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:16.165 A:middle
many listeners do I have?

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:19.556 A:middle
Here we see 256,000 unique

00:17:19.556 --> 00:17:20.195 A:middle
devices.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.016 A:middle
Next to that, we can answer the

00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:24.705 A:middle
question, how much do they

00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:25.126 A:middle
listen?

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:26.996 A:middle
In this case, the total time

00:17:26.996 --> 00:17:31.636 A:middle
listened is 327,000 total hours.

00:17:32.876 --> 00:17:34.626 A:middle
Now, if we do a little math, we

00:17:34.626 --> 00:17:36.016 A:middle
can find the average, which is

00:17:36.016 --> 00:17:38.256 A:middle
the time per device of 1 hour

00:17:38.256 --> 00:17:39.396 A:middle
and 17 minutes.

00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:41.256 A:middle
So, this is a very popular show.

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:42.406 A:middle
It's doing really well.

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.466 A:middle
So, next, we're going to switch

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:50.656 A:middle
tabs from the show's tab to the

00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:52.976 A:middle
episodes tab.

00:17:53.176 --> 00:17:54.996 A:middle
Here, we can see a cross-section

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:58.176 A:middle
of episodes across all of the

00:17:58.176 --> 00:17:59.226 A:middle
shows in John's account.


00:18:00.156 --> 00:18:01.556 A:middle
Here, we see a few of the most

00:18:01.556 --> 00:18:03.006 A:middle
recently released episodes.

00:18:05.846 --> 00:18:07.096 A:middle
Now, this data table has a lot

00:18:07.096 --> 00:18:08.436 A:middle
more information in it, and

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:10.196 A:middle
let's take a look at the top

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:10.606 A:middle
row.

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:13.906 A:middle
This is the most recent episode

00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:15.136 A:middle
from The Very Hungry Tourists,

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.056 A:middle
starting on the right-hand side,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.946 A:middle
we can see the name of the

00:18:19.946 --> 00:18:21.426 A:middle
episode, then the name of the

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:24.026 A:middle
show, and now, the third column

00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
is the episode column.

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:26.686 A:middle
If you're making use of the new

00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:28.746 A:middle
tags, like season, episode, and

00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:30.586 A:middle
episode type, they'll show up

00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:30.876 A:middle
here.

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:33.246 A:middle
Following that, we have the

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.646 A:middle
release date and then the

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:35.326 A:middle
duration.

00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:37.016 A:middle
So, in this case, it's a

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:38.466 A:middle
35-minute long episode.

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:41.036 A:middle
If, when you login, you don't

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:42.146 A:middle
see the right number in the

00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:45.086 A:middle
duration column, it's because of

00:18:45.086 --> 00:18:46.136 A:middle
what you have in your feed.

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:47.626 A:middle
We pulled this number straight

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
from your feed.

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:49.866 A:middle
So, make sure it's accurate.

00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:53.026 A:middle
Following the duration column,

00:18:53.026 --> 00:18:54.286 A:middle
we see three columns that we've

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:56.116 A:middle
seen before, except this time,

00:18:56.556 --> 00:18:57.976 A:middle
for this episode specifically.

00:18:58.266 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
So, we have devices, total time


00:18:58.266 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
So, we have devices, total time

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:01.556 A:middle
listened, and time per device.

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:04.916 A:middle
And for the first time, we see

00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:06.006 A:middle
average consumption.

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:07.626 A:middle
This is the last metric in the

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:08.576 A:middle
far right column.

00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:11.326 A:middle
Average consumption is really

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:12.686 A:middle
great because it's really just

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:14.056 A:middle
another way of looking at time

00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:14.826 A:middle
per device.

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:17.586 A:middle
So, in this case, it's 28 minute

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.846 A:middle
for this 35-minute long episode.

00:19:20.606 --> 00:19:21.856 A:middle
That is 81%.

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.286 A:middle
What's nice about average

00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:24.996 A:middle
consumption is it allows us to

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.786 A:middle
compare episodes of differing

00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:29.096 A:middle
durations against each other to

00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:30.446 A:middle
really get a sense of how

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:31.906 A:middle
healthy each episode is doing.

00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:37.036 A:middle
And from here, let's click

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
through on the Show Title and

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:40.186 A:middle
look at the show overview for

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:41.496 A:middle
The Very Hungry Tourists.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.836 A:middle
So, here's the show overview.

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:48.426 A:middle
There's a lot going on here.

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:49.526 A:middle
Let's start at the top.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.636 A:middle
Across the top, we have three

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:53.606 A:middle
headline numbers.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:54.756 A:middle
These are the same numbers that

00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:56.236 A:middle
we saw before in the shows

00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:58.606 A:middle
table, but now we have a mini

00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:00.086 A:middle
time series underneath these


00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:00.086 A:middle
time series underneath these

00:20:00.086 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
numbers to give you a sense of

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:03.616 A:middle
how things are doing.

00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:06.776 A:middle
Maybe you can see, just looking

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:08.676 A:middle
at that little line, if your

00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:11.756 A:middle
show is getting more or fewer

00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
listeners over time.

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:16.776 A:middle
Now, let's look beneath this row

00:20:17.796 --> 00:20:19.746 A:middle
and take a look at the chart on

00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:20.516 A:middle
the left here.

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.606 A:middle
This is the donut chart of total

00:20:22.606 --> 00:20:23.216 A:middle
time listened.

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:27.836 A:middle
So, for all of the time spent

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:29.866 A:middle
listening to your show, were

00:20:30.716 --> 00:20:32.966 A:middle
those devices subscribed or not

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:33.526 A:middle
subscribed?

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.446 A:middle
Here, we can see that 83% of

00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:38.706 A:middle
that 328,000 total hours of

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:39.896 A:middle
listening was done by a

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.776 A:middle
subscribed device versus 17% not

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:43.246 A:middle
subscribed.

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.166 A:middle
So, these are pretty good

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:45.636 A:middle
numbers.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.036 A:middle
But why might these numbers be

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:49.046 A:middle
different when you take a look

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:49.996 A:middle
at your data?

00:20:50.826 --> 00:20:53.396 A:middle
Well, if you have a very small

00:20:53.396 --> 00:20:55.076 A:middle
podcast, one with a very

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:57.516 A:middle
dedicated following, you might

00:20:57.516 --> 00:20:59.676 A:middle
not have too many new listeners,


00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:01.946 A:middle
but your subscribed count might

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:04.236 A:middle
be above 90, even 95%.

00:21:05.276 --> 00:21:07.466 A:middle
Conversely, if you're doing a

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.956 A:middle
lot of marketing or promotion,

00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:11.966 A:middle
or your show is growing rapidly,

00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:14.376 A:middle
you're not subscribed count

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.506 A:middle
might be fairly high.

00:21:18.266 --> 00:21:19.656 A:middle
Now, when somebody first starts

00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:20.786 A:middle
to listen to your show,

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.006 A:middle
obviously, they're not going to

00:21:22.006 --> 00:21:23.576 A:middle
be subscribed most of the time.

00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:25.336 A:middle
But once they hear what you have

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.796 A:middle
and they hit that "Subscribe"

00:21:26.796 --> 00:21:29.096 A:middle
button, that's when they end up

00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:32.976 A:middle
in the other bucket.

00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:34.846 A:middle
chart to the right.

00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:36.066 A:middle
This is the Top Countries by

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:36.556 A:middle
Device.

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:37.876 A:middle
Here, we can see the top five

00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
countries for the show.

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.066 A:middle
As we can see, the United States

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.566 A:middle
comprises the majority of the

00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:44.426 A:middle
listening at 78%.

00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:47.936 A:middle
If we look at the fifth spot, we

00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:48.716 A:middle
see Brazil.

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:50.726 A:middle
Now, what's neat about this is

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.176 A:middle
that Brazil wasn't on this top

00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:55.246 A:middle
five before, but as Anne said

00:21:55.246 --> 00:21:57.636 A:middle
earlier, this is season 2 of The

00:21:57.636 --> 00:21:59.156 A:middle
Very Hungry Tourists, and on the

00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
first episode of this season,


00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
first episode of this season,

00:22:00.876 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
they actually went down to

00:22:01.636 --> 00:22:02.226 A:middle
Brazil.

00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:03.946 A:middle
They did some marketing and

00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:07.296 A:middle
promotion, and it's starting to

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.156 A:middle
pay off.

00:22:09.156 --> 00:22:10.526 A:middle
So, next, let's scroll down to

00:22:10.526 --> 00:22:13.076 A:middle
the bottom of the page, and here

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:14.886 A:middle
we can see the ten most recently

00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:16.686 A:middle
released episodes for the show.

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.266 A:middle
This is the same sort of data

00:22:19.266 --> 00:22:20.466 A:middle
table that we saw before for

00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:22.246 A:middle
episodes, but this time it's for

00:22:22.396 --> 00:22:23.126 A:middle
a single show.

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.946 A:middle
What's nice about this is we can

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:26.806 A:middle
compare apples to apples and

00:22:26.806 --> 00:22:28.816 A:middle
really see on an episode by

00:22:28.816 --> 00:22:30.886 A:middle
episode basis how things are

00:22:30.886 --> 00:22:32.896 A:middle
turning out.

00:22:33.176 --> 00:22:34.926 A:middle
Let's go back up to the top, and

00:22:36.016 --> 00:22:37.476 A:middle
we're going to switch from the

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:40.356 A:middle
Show Overview to add to the

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:41.176 A:middle
Trends tab.

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.916 A:middle
So, here we are in the Trends

00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:44.166 A:middle
tab.

00:22:45.516 --> 00:22:47.456 A:middle
This is a Time Series Chart

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
where we can see day by day how

00:22:49.996 --> 00:22:51.296 A:middle
many people are tuning into this

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:51.706 A:middle
show.

00:22:51.846 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
And again, by default, we're

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:55.726 A:middle
looking at the last 60 days of

00:22:55.726 --> 00:22:56.046 A:middle
data.

00:22:56.816 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
In the top left corner, we see

00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
that headline number again of


00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
that headline number again of

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:04.046 A:middle
256,000 unique devices, and down

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:05.706 A:middle
below the Time Series Chart we

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.506 A:middle
see a table with episode titles.

00:23:08.626 --> 00:23:10.046 A:middle
We can choose up to five

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:11.636 A:middle
separate episodes to compare

00:23:11.636 --> 00:23:12.996 A:middle
against one another in the chart

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:13.316 A:middle
above.

00:23:16.136 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
So, let's first now talk about

00:23:18.806 --> 00:23:21.146 A:middle
all of the different drop downs

00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:23.836 A:middle
that control the chart and what

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:24.656 A:middle
we see in it.

00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:27.286 A:middle
First up, we have a drop-down.

00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:28.866 A:middle
This is the metric that we're

00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:29.566 A:middle
going to chart.

00:23:29.906 --> 00:23:31.086 A:middle
By default, we start off with

00:23:31.086 --> 00:23:33.146 A:middle
Unique Devices, or you can also

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:35.236 A:middle
choose to have it render Total

00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:35.826 A:middle
Time Listened.

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:39.396 A:middle
To the right of that, we have

00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:40.486 A:middle
another drop-down.

00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:41.876 A:middle
This is what I call the primary

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:42.306 A:middle
filter.

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:44.716 A:middle
By default here, we're looking

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:46.886 A:middle
at Episode as the primary

00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
filter, but you might want to

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
choose Country or Subscribed

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:50.546 A:middle
Device.

00:23:50.906 --> 00:23:52.236 A:middle
Now, whatever you choose for

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:53.566 A:middle
your primary filter, that's

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:54.826 A:middle
going to dictate the table

00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:55.636 A:middle
beneath the chart.

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
So, whatever is selected allows

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:59.716 A:middle
you to choose multiple entries

00:23:59.716 --> 00:24:00.976 A:middle
to compare against one another.


00:23:59.716 --> 00:24:00.976 A:middle
to compare against one another.

00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:03.046 A:middle
For example, we could choose

00:24:03.206 --> 00:24:04.496 A:middle
Country, and we'll have

00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:06.446 A:middle
countries in that table below.

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:08.566 A:middle
Whatever filters are not

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:10.716 A:middle
selected from this menu, they

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.476 A:middle
move over to the right-hand side

00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:13.386 A:middle
of the page in their own

00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:14.076 A:middle
drop-downs.

00:24:15.256 --> 00:24:17.846 A:middle
For example, countries or

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:19.246 A:middle
subscription state [phonetic].

00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.226 A:middle
For each of these, you can

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.446 A:middle
choose up to one filter.

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.926 A:middle
Now, with that, that's enough

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:28.696 A:middle
talking through slides.

00:24:28.696 --> 00:24:30.416 A:middle
Let's look at a demo, and I will

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.966 A:middle
take you back to that page but

00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:36.046 A:middle
in a hands-on fashion.

00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:38.926 A:middle
So, here we are.

00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:40.206 A:middle
We're in that same view that we

00:24:40.206 --> 00:24:42.146 A:middle
saw before of the Trends page.

00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:45.596 A:middle
But now, we can see what happens

00:24:45.596 --> 00:24:47.386 A:middle
when I interact with it.

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:49.086 A:middle
When I move my mouse cursor over

00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:51.526 A:middle
the chart, we have this nice

00:24:51.566 --> 00:24:53.526 A:middle
data legend with details about

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:54.936 A:middle
the specific point that I'm

00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:55.546 A:middle
hovering over.

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.356 A:middle
In this case, I'm looking at May

00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
18th, where 34,000 unique


00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
18th, where 34,000 unique

00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:02.646 A:middle
devices tuned in.

00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:05.516 A:middle
And I can go down the page, and

00:25:05.766 --> 00:25:07.006 A:middle
I'm going to select a few

00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:09.626 A:middle
episodes to chart against each

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:09.946 A:middle
other.

00:25:12.756 --> 00:25:14.616 A:middle
We get this nice colorful view,

00:25:15.206 --> 00:25:17.226 A:middle
and as I mouse over, I can also

00:25:17.226 --> 00:25:18.846 A:middle
again see the details of what

00:25:18.846 --> 00:25:19.586 A:middle
I'm hovering over.

00:25:19.966 --> 00:25:21.306 A:middle
In this case, I can see episode

00:25:21.306 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
titles and their corresponding

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:26.726 A:middle
counts for those days.

00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:29.176 A:middle
Now, I'm going to go change my

00:25:29.176 --> 00:25:31.226 A:middle
primary filter, and I'm going

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:32.506 A:middle
switch it from Episode to

00:25:32.506 --> 00:25:32.956 A:middle
Country.

00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:36.326 A:middle
So, this updates the chart once

00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:36.716 A:middle
again.

00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:38.266 A:middle
This is the same actual graph

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:39.266 A:middle
that we saw the first time

00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:40.836 A:middle
because now, again, we're

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:41.956 A:middle
looking at all countries.

00:25:42.616 --> 00:25:44.536 A:middle
But I'm going to choose the top

00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:48.026 A:middle
five countries and compare those

00:25:48.026 --> 00:25:48.786 A:middle
against each other.

00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:51.806 A:middle
Once again, we get this colorful

00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:52.186 A:middle
chart.

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:54.376 A:middle
But in this particular case,

00:25:54.846 --> 00:25:56.076 A:middle
because the United States

00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.056 A:middle
represents so much of the

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.976 A:middle
listening for this show, it

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.476 A:middle
makes it difficult to see the


00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.476 A:middle
makes it difficult to see the

00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:01.396 A:middle
other countries and how they

00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:02.486 A:middle
stack up against each other.

00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:04.276 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to go and

00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:05.786 A:middle
deselect the United States.

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:08.796 A:middle
The chart adjusts, and we can

00:26:08.976 --> 00:26:11.576 A:middle
really see with more detail how

00:26:11.576 --> 00:26:14.816 A:middle
each country is doing.

00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
And now that I can, I'm going to

00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:20.176 A:middle
show you the date picker.

00:26:20.326 --> 00:26:21.316 A:middle
It's up here on the top right

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:21.706 A:middle
corner.

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:23.336 A:middle
By default, it sets at the last

00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:24.086 A:middle
60 days.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.696 A:middle
You can switch that to weeks or

00:26:26.926 --> 00:26:29.226 A:middle
a specific month, but we'll

00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:30.016 A:middle
leave it at that for now.

00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:31.926 A:middle
Now, there are lots of

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:33.476 A:middle
combinations that you can make

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:36.206 A:middle
here, but I'm going to move on

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:38.076 A:middle
after this, but I really

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:39.306 A:middle
encourage you to take a look at

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:40.506 A:middle
your shows and see how they're

00:26:40.506 --> 00:26:42.316 A:middle
doing and really play around

00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:42.786 A:middle
with this tool.

00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:44.066 A:middle
I think it's a lot of fun to

00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:44.456 A:middle
use.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.106 A:middle
So, let's switch over to the

00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:48.666 A:middle
Show Episodes tab, and in this

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:49.966 A:middle
view, we can see the top

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:52.286 A:middle
episodes or all episodes for the

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:54.066 A:middle
show, not just the top episodes.

00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:56.586 A:middle
In this case, the show has 11,

00:26:57.026 --> 00:26:58.076 A:middle
11 episodes total.

00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
And now, because all episodes


00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
And now, because all episodes

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:02.176 A:middle
are together in this view, we

00:27:02.176 --> 00:27:03.406 A:middle
have the opportunity now to

00:27:03.406 --> 00:27:04.706 A:middle
answer some other questions

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:06.666 A:middle
like, what are the most popular

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.386 A:middle
episodes?

00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:09.396 A:middle
One way to answer that is by

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:12.016 A:middle
sorting by the Unique Devices

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:12.426 A:middle
column.

00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:14.936 A:middle
When I do that, I can see that,

00:27:15.596 --> 00:27:17.076 A:middle
essentially, season 1, episode

00:27:17.076 --> 00:27:18.766 A:middle
4, Barcelona, Barbacoa, that is

00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:21.686 A:middle
the most popular by devices, by

00:27:21.686 --> 00:27:22.366 A:middle
unique devices.

00:27:22.706 --> 00:27:24.196 A:middle
But maybe you think that it's

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:25.426 A:middle
actually total time listened

00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:28.296 A:middle
that should be the determinant

00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:30.026 A:middle
of popularity, so I'm going to

00:27:30.476 --> 00:27:32.306 A:middle
sort by that instead, and we see

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:33.416 A:middle
that it's actually season 2,

00:27:33.416 --> 00:27:35.856 A:middle
episode 1 that takes the top

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:36.626 A:middle
spot.

00:27:36.626 --> 00:27:38.236 A:middle
Or for myself, I personally

00:27:38.236 --> 00:27:39.556 A:middle
really like average consumption,

00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:41.376 A:middle
so I'm going to sort by that,

00:27:41.376 --> 00:27:44.216 A:middle
and I can see that at 89%, the

00:27:44.216 --> 00:27:45.356 A:middle
trailer is actually the most

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.406 A:middle
popular episode, which makes

00:27:47.406 --> 00:27:48.476 A:middle
sense because it's a short

00:27:48.476 --> 00:27:48.976 A:middle
episode.

00:27:51.856 --> 00:27:53.606 A:middle
So, now, we've actually seen all

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:55.266 A:middle
of the show level views.

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:56.846 A:middle
Now, I'd like to take you into

00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:58.706 A:middle
an episode level view.

00:27:58.796 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to select, I'm


00:27:58.796 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to select, I'm

00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.916 A:middle
going to click through on the

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.246 A:middle
title for the most recently

00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:04.196 A:middle
released episode.

00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:06.506 A:middle
Here's Broken Heirloom.

00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:08.966 A:middle
So, it was just released on June

00:28:08.966 --> 00:28:09.686 A:middle
1st.

00:28:10.686 --> 00:28:11.656 A:middle
Front and center, we see a

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.666 A:middle
timeline chart.

00:28:13.186 --> 00:28:14.876 A:middle
This shows you the audience size

00:28:15.526 --> 00:28:16.806 A:middle
over the duration of the

00:28:16.806 --> 00:28:18.496 A:middle
episode; actually, at every five

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.686 A:middle
seconds, and when I hover over

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:22.176 A:middle
the chart, I can see a data

00:28:22.176 --> 00:28:23.986 A:middle
legend again with details about

00:28:23.986 --> 00:28:25.226 A:middle
the specific time in the

00:28:25.226 --> 00:28:26.816 A:middle
episode, its total count, and

00:28:26.816 --> 00:28:27.866 A:middle
its percentage of the max.

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:32.086 A:middle
And in the top left corner, we

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:34.316 A:middle
see this headline number for the

00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:35.726 A:middle
total number of unique devices.

00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:37.866 A:middle
Something to note about this

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.076 A:middle
chart, unlike all the other

00:28:39.076 --> 00:28:41.126 A:middle
views on this, in Podcast

00:28:41.126 --> 00:28:42.836 A:middle
Analytics, this chart is

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:45.266 A:middle
actually for all time, not just

00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.436 A:middle
a specified date range.

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:51.416 A:middle
Now, what's really nice to see

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:54.096 A:middle
here is that, in this case, most

00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:55.166 A:middle
of the people who started this

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.726 A:middle
episode actually hung out for

00:28:56.726 --> 00:28:57.896 A:middle
the entire duration.

00:28:58.426 --> 00:28:59.656 A:middle
This is a really healthy-looking

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:00.136 A:middle
episode.


00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:00.136 A:middle
episode.

00:29:01.076 --> 00:29:03.666 A:middle
And beneath the chart, if I

00:29:03.666 --> 00:29:05.006 A:middle
scroll down a little bit, we can

00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:08.416 A:middle
see for the last 60 days the

00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:10.506 A:middle
metrics for this show, for this

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.676 A:middle
episode, I should say.

00:29:12.596 --> 00:29:14.586 A:middle
This gives you a more recent

00:29:14.896 --> 00:29:16.316 A:middle
sense of how this episode is

00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:17.706 A:middle
doing, not just all time.

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:19.406 A:middle
And at the very bottom, we see

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:20.836 A:middle
the top ten countries for this

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:21.286 A:middle
episode.

00:29:22.236 --> 00:29:23.746 A:middle
But I'm going to scroll back up

00:29:23.746 --> 00:29:26.266 A:middle
and cover two things that I

00:29:26.476 --> 00:29:27.696 A:middle
breezed past before.

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:30.526 A:middle
There is a drop-down menu above

00:29:30.526 --> 00:29:32.376 A:middle
that all-time devices number,

00:29:33.116 --> 00:29:34.866 A:middle
and when I click on this, I can

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:36.426 A:middle
see that I can also choose

00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:38.166 A:middle
Devices or Total Time Listened.

00:29:39.176 --> 00:29:40.246 A:middle
Now, by choosing either of

00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:41.736 A:middle
those, it will actually take us

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.806 A:middle
into a view which is a time

00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:45.716 A:middle
series view, just like the Show

00:29:45.716 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
Trends page except this time

00:29:47.826 --> 00:29:49.016 A:middle
it's tied specifically to this

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:49.436 A:middle
episode.

00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:55.896 A:middle
And now, the part of this graph

00:29:55.896 --> 00:29:57.866 A:middle
that I like the best is actually

00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:59.116 A:middle
the ability to play back the

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.236 A:middle
audio while seeing how the


00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.236 A:middle
audio while seeing how the

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:02.916 A:middle
audience is reacting over the

00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:03.966 A:middle
duration of the episode.

00:30:03.966 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
And I can do this by going down

00:30:06.696 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
to the bottom left corner of the

00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.266 A:middle
graph and hitting this Play

00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:09.636 A:middle
button.

00:30:10.236 --> 00:30:12.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey there, Hunger Heads, and

00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:13.606 A:middle
welcome back to another episode

00:30:13.606 --> 00:30:15.286 A:middle
of The Very Hungry Tourists.

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:16.906 A:middle
I'm Maria Sanchez, Ph.D.

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:18.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm Johnny Appleseed.

00:30:18.486 --> 00:30:19.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In today's episode, we're

00:30:19.856 --> 00:30:21.466 A:middle
headed to Brooklyn based Viny's

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
Pizzeria.

00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:23.876 A:middle
As we're here, even Johnny's

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:25.786 A:middle
massive wonder couldn't get in

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:26.906 A:middle
the way of our culinary

00:30:26.906 --> 00:30:27.286 A:middle
adventure.

00:30:27.466 --> 00:30:28.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm still blushing from that

00:30:28.456 --> 00:30:28.646 A:middle
one.

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:30.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, this is actually a very

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.546 A:middle
entertaining episode, so if you

00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:33.276 A:middle
get a chance, you should

00:30:33.276 --> 00:30:34.166 A:middle
definitely check it out.

00:30:35.836 --> 00:30:38.956 A:middle
But like any basic player, you

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:39.976 A:middle
don't just have to start at the

00:30:39.976 --> 00:30:40.396 A:middle
beginning.

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:41.296 A:middle
You can also click on the

00:30:41.296 --> 00:30:42.946 A:middle
timeline to jump ahead to any

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:45.486 A:middle
specific spot in time, and if

00:30:45.486 --> 00:30:47.066 A:middle
you want to fine tune, you can

00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:48.726 A:middle
grab the play head and scrub

00:30:48.726 --> 00:30:48.856 A:middle
around.

00:30:48.856 --> 00:30:50.986 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to scrub

00:30:50.986 --> 00:30:52.366 A:middle
to the beginning of what looks

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:53.076 A:middle
like an ad.

00:30:53.866 --> 00:30:55.566 A:middle
And so, just to validate my

00:30:55.566 --> 00:30:56.876 A:middle
assumptions, I'm going to move

00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
to just before and take a

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.056 A:middle
listen.

00:30:59.426 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Five years, you wouldn't


00:30:59.426 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Five years, you wouldn't

00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
believe it, but in the back

00:31:01.456 --> 00:31:01.976 A:middle
there is a big window--

00:31:02.046 --> 00:31:03.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As the pizza goes in the

00:31:03.926 --> 00:31:05.726 A:middle
oven, let's take a moment to

00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:06.986 A:middle
hear about out great sponsors.

00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:08.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Just say your hands and face

00:31:08.636 --> 00:31:10.186 A:middle
are smothered with Tahini sauce.

00:31:10.226 --> 00:31:11.216 A:middle
So, what do you do?

00:31:11.216 --> 00:31:12.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Get a paper towel.

00:31:12.236 --> 00:31:12.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ah, too rough.

00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:13.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tissue?

00:31:13.296 --> 00:31:13.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Too soft.

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:14.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What about napkins?

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.

00:31:16.606 --> 00:31:18.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Napkins to you is a new drone

00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:19.586 A:middle
delivery service bringing you

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.326 A:middle
napkins where and whenever you

00:31:21.326 --> 00:31:21.756 A:middle
need them.

00:31:21.756 --> 00:31:23.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Simply open the app, request

00:31:23.246 --> 00:31:24.556 A:middle
a drop off, and the closest

00:31:24.556 --> 00:31:25.786 A:middle
drone is deployed to your

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:26.326 A:middle
location.

00:31:26.706 --> 00:31:27.926 A:middle
By typing in promo code

00:31:27.996 --> 00:31:28.416 A:middle
"Hungry."

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:29.556 A:middle
You can have your very own

00:31:29.556 --> 00:31:32.766 A:middle
napkins delivered for just $4.99

00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:33.126 A:middle
per month.

00:31:33.346 --> 00:31:34.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Again, that's Napkins to You.

00:31:36.146 --> 00:31:36.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, that's sounds like a

00:31:36.826 --> 00:31:38.196 A:middle
really entertaining ad, and it's

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:39.926 A:middle
too bad that some people decided

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:42.756 A:middle
to skip it, but if you actually

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:45.416 A:middle
do the math from before the ad

00:31:45.576 --> 00:31:47.966 A:middle
to the bottom of the ad, it's

00:31:47.966 --> 00:31:49.726 A:middle
only about a 14% drop, and it

00:31:49.726 --> 00:31:50.716 A:middle
seems like it's a temporary

00:31:50.716 --> 00:31:51.016 A:middle
drop.

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:52.406 A:middle
So, it's doing pretty well.

00:31:55.806 --> 00:32:00.566 A:middle
So, with that, I want to switch


00:31:55.806 --> 00:32:00.566 A:middle
So, with that, I want to switch

00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.166 A:middle
back to the slide, and I just

00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:04.496 A:middle
want to say that wraps up the

00:32:04.496 --> 00:32:06.556 A:middle
walk through and demo of Podcast

00:32:06.556 --> 00:32:09.096 A:middle
Analytics for you, and I hope

00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:10.186 A:middle
that you were able to learn some

00:32:10.186 --> 00:32:11.776 A:middle
things about how this tool works

00:32:11.776 --> 00:32:13.236 A:middle
and maybe how it can help you

00:32:13.236 --> 00:32:14.756 A:middle
better understand your audience.

00:32:15.826 --> 00:32:17.216 A:middle
And Podcast Analytics is in

00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:19.366 A:middle
beta, and we are very interested

00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:20.156 A:middle
in your feedback.

00:32:20.796 --> 00:32:22.816 A:middle
So, if you submit your feedback

00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:23.876 A:middle
link in the top left corner,

00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:25.696 A:middle
right next to the beta badge, we

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:27.066 A:middle
would love to hear what you

00:32:27.066 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
think about the, about Podcast

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.966 A:middle
Analytics, and give us your

00:32:30.966 --> 00:32:31.426 A:middle
feedback.

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:32.456 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:33.186 --> 00:32:33.916 A:middle
Now, let's bring it back to

00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:33.983 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Alec.

00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:45.676 A:middle
That was awesome!

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:46.916 A:middle
So, that's a walk through

00:32:46.916 --> 00:32:48.876 A:middle
Podcast Analytics, which, again,

00:32:49.346 --> 00:32:51.246 A:middle
is available to anyone with a

00:32:51.246 --> 00:32:52.736 A:middle
podcast in our catalogue.

00:32:52.736 --> 00:32:55.286 A:middle
If you haven't used it, try it

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:55.506 A:middle
out.

00:32:55.826 --> 00:32:57.376 A:middle
It'll also be at a lab

00:32:57.376 --> 00:32:58.466 A:middle
immediately following this

00:32:58.466 --> 00:32:58.986 A:middle
session.

00:32:58.986 --> 00:33:01.496 A:middle
So, come find us.


00:32:58.986 --> 00:33:01.496 A:middle
So, come find us.

00:33:01.536 --> 00:33:03.246 A:middle
And that's where we are today,

00:33:03.246 --> 00:33:04.746 A:middle
but really we've just begun.

00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:06.556 A:middle
You guys are the reason that we

00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:08.356 A:middle
did this, and we love hearing

00:33:08.356 --> 00:33:08.826 A:middle
from you.

00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:10.816 A:middle
So, keep it coming.

00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:12.986 A:middle
For example, we know that many

00:33:12.986 --> 00:33:14.856 A:middle
of you want an API or a

00:33:14.856 --> 00:33:16.376 A:middle
subscription and download data

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:18.416 A:middle
or geographic demographics with

00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.216 A:middle
more specificity.

00:33:20.216 --> 00:33:21.606 A:middle
We love those suggestions.

00:33:21.896 --> 00:33:23.776 A:middle
We hear you, and we're working

00:33:23.776 --> 00:33:24.846 A:middle
on improving the product in the

00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:25.236 A:middle
future.

00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:28.416 A:middle
We are also going to be asking

00:33:28.416 --> 00:33:30.716 A:middle
for some things rom you in the

00:33:30.716 --> 00:33:32.726 A:middle
future, including new

00:33:32.726 --> 00:33:34.986 A:middle
specifications around HTTPS,

00:33:35.726 --> 00:33:39.616 A:middle
pubDates, consistent GUIDs, and

00:33:39.616 --> 00:33:42.116 A:middle
cover art that meets minimum

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:44.116 A:middle
required resolution.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:46.166 A:middle
So, for continued access to

00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:47.226 A:middle
Analytics in the future, you

00:33:47.226 --> 00:33:48.826 A:middle
will absolutely need to have

00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:50.166 A:middle
those four things.

00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:52.966 A:middle
We're also going to be releasing

00:33:52.966 --> 00:33:54.816 A:middle
some guidelines around best

00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:56.966 A:middle
practices for audio mastering to

00:33:56.966 --> 00:33:58.426 A:middle
give you a sense of the ranges

00:33:58.426 --> 00:33:59.866 A:middle
you should be using so that your

00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.936 A:middle
podcast sounds the best it can


00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.936 A:middle
podcast sounds the best it can

00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:04.466 A:middle
on HomePod and within the

00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:06.006 A:middle
context of the Apple Podcast

00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:06.536 A:middle

00:34:07.116 --> 00:34:08.306 A:middle
We'll be sharing these

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:09.716 A:middle
requirements with you all.

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:11.146 A:middle
We will put them in Podcast

00:34:11.146 --> 00:34:12.846 A:middle

refer back to them anytime.

00:34:15.926 --> 00:34:18.156 A:middle
And speaking of which, last but

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.525 A:middle
not least, I want to remind you

00:34:19.525 --> 00:34:20.656 A:middle

So, we have a Branding Guide for

podcasters.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.906 A:middle
We also have the Affiliate

00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:38.565 A:middle
That features the hosting

00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:39.835 A:middle
partner list that James

00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:42.226 A:middle
mentioned; some tutorial videos
