00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:34.256 A:middle
I'm James Vest, and I'm here to

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:37.666 A:middle
teach you today how learning

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.386 A:middle
VoiceOver can help make your app

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.666 A:middle
more usable for everyone.

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:45.516 A:middle
And here's how I'm going to do

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:45.696 A:middle
that.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.516 A:middle
I'll tell you what VoiceOver is

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.676 A:middle
and why you should support

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.826 A:middle
VoiceOver and also how to use

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.196 A:middle
VoiceOver if you have never done

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:59.636 A:middle
it before and also how VoiceOver

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
benefits your app.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:06.626 A:middle
So what is VoiceOver?

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.796 A:middle
I get some common answers like

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.006 A:middle
well VoiceOver is a screen

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:12.296 A:middle
reader.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.906 A:middle
That's true, but VoiceOver

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:17.716 A:middle
doesn't just read the screen, or

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.236 A:middle
VoiceOver is for the visually

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:20.676 A:middle
impaired.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:24.756 A:middle
It's true, but it's not just for

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:25.566 A:middle
the visually impaired.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:32.226 A:middle
So if VoiceOver is not just for

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.426 A:middle
the visually impaired, and it's

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.646 A:middle
not just a screen reader, what

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.246 A:middle
is it?

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:40.926 A:middle
VoiceOver is an alternative way

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.826 A:middle
of using you app, and it uses

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:46.156 A:middle
gestures, a keyboard, or a

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.446 A:middle
Braille display to give a

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:51.196 A:middle
variety of users equal access to

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.016 A:middle
your experience, and it's built

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
in to every Apple device.

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:59.796 A:middle
Now think about that last point.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:01.756 A:middle
It's kind of awesome.

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:05.876 A:middle
I mean that means that every

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.406 A:middle
person who uses your app has

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:09.515 A:middle
access to VoiceOver.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:15.276 A:middle
But not every VoiceOver user has

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.016 A:middle
access to every app.

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:19.556 A:middle
And that's why you're here.

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:21.936 A:middle
That's why you are such an

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:24.026 A:middle
important role in this story

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:27.496 A:middle
because you must update your app

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:30.326 A:middle
for us to take advantage of

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:30.906 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.516 A:middle
Now when I say updating your app

00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:36.046 A:middle
or supporting VoiceOver, I'm not

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:37.636 A:middle
talking about creating or

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.286 A:middle
maintaining a alternative or

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.776 A:middle
simplified layout or tailored to

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:44.496 A:middle
a subsection of users.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:50.716 A:middle
It's about allowing all users to

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:52.276 A:middle
access the experience that you

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:52.756 A:middle
created.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.486 A:middle
So why support VoiceOver?

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
Well, supporting VoiceOver makes

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
Well, supporting VoiceOver makes

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.426 A:middle
your app more inclusive.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.216 A:middle
VoiceOver users are more likely

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.226 A:middle
to choose you app over other

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:12.686 A:middle
apps that don't support

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:13.166 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
And this is a great community,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.866 A:middle
so they are more likely to in

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.276 A:middle
turn recommend your app to other

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.346 A:middle
VoiceOver users.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:26.286 A:middle
But sadly, for many developers,

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.606 A:middle
those reasons are not enough,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:30.516 A:middle
and I get it.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.196 A:middle
There's only so much time.

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:33.906 A:middle
There's only so many resources,

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.386 A:middle
and you want to make the best

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:37.756 A:middle
decisions to create the best

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:38.816 A:middle
experience for the most of your

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:39.356 A:middle
users.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:42.446 A:middle
So that's why it's so important

00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:44.956 A:middle
today that you realize that

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.476 A:middle
learning VoiceOver can help make

00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.086 A:middle
your app more usable for

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.616 A:middle
everyone, not just VoiceOver

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.856 A:middle
users, for all users.

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:55.986 A:middle
So I bet you're asking yourself,

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
right?

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:57.966 A:middle
Can a screen reader do that?

00:03:58.726 --> 00:03:59.926 A:middle
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:01.756 A:middle
I mean look at some of the

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:03.366 A:middle
latest apps coming out, those

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:04.416 A:middle
larger texts.

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:05.386 A:middle
Those cleaner layouts.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.576 A:middle
They're not just benefiting low

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:09.596 A:middle
vision users or users with

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:10.396 A:middle
cognitive needs.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.236 A:middle
They benefit us all, and the

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:14.546 A:middle
same is true with VoiceOver.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:18.196 A:middle
So here's how VoiceOver could

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.086 A:middle
help you with your app.

00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:23.516 A:middle
Well, testing with VoiceOver can

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:24.556 A:middle
give you a new perspective.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.016 A:middle
Now it's easy to take for

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:29.096 A:middle
granted your app because it's

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:29.636 A:middle
your app.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.476 A:middle
You know exactly what it does,

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:32.446 A:middle
what it's supposed to do, how

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:33.786 A:middle
it's supposed to do it.

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:36.346 A:middle
But we take a lot of those

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.596 A:middle
things for granted, and when I

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:40.376 A:middle
say testing with VoiceOver gives

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:42.606 A:middle
you a new perspective, it's

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.636 A:middle
getting a chance to experience

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:45.586 A:middle
your app in a new way.

00:04:46.226 --> 00:04:49.356 A:middle
That's because VoiceOver goes

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.606 A:middle
beyond the way your app location

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:52.026 A:middle
looks.

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:54.656 A:middle
I mean an app might look good,

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.136 A:middle
but that doesn't make it usable.

00:04:56.726 --> 00:05:00.136 A:middle
So side-scrolling states, hover

00:04:56.726 --> 00:05:00.136 A:middle
So side-scrolling states, hover

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:02.366 A:middle
states, they can all give the

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:04.156 A:middle
allusion of straightforward,

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.846 A:middle
clean, easy-to-use interface.

00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:08.606 A:middle
But testing with VoiceOver goes

00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
beyond that, and so it allows

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:13.726 A:middle
you to discover new challenges

00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:18.366 A:middle
and insights, and finally, I

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:19.656 A:middle
believe VoiceOver gets really at

00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:20.646 A:middle
the heart of what we do.

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:24.526 A:middle
As iOS developers, we pride

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:25.566 A:middle
ourselves on creating

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.366 A:middle
easy-to-use, easy-to-understand

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:28.986 A:middle
apps.

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:33.006 A:middle
Well those values are especially

00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:34.406 A:middle
apparent when using VoiceOver.

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:39.626 A:middle
So my question to you today is

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.876 A:middle
your app so easy to use you

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:42.726 A:middle
could use it with your eyes

00:05:42.726 --> 00:05:43.246 A:middle
closed?

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:46.886 A:middle
And that's not a question just

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:47.936 A:middle
for testers.

00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
That's a question for designers,

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:50.546 A:middle
for developers.

00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:53.816 A:middle
Anyone responsible for creating

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.226 A:middle
the best experience possible for

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:55.866 A:middle
our users.

00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:58.606 A:middle
And the only way to answer that

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.796 A:middle
question is to start testing

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.796 A:middle
question is to start testing

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.216 A:middle
with VoiceOver, and that's what

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:04.996 A:middle
I'm here for today.

00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:07.596 A:middle
I'm going to give you some ways

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:08.906 A:middle
of being able to turn on

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.096 A:middle
VoiceOver and start using it.

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:11.626 A:middle
Figure out where you're at,

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.376 A:middle
where you could improve, and

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
then I'll give you some things

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:17.706 A:middle
else to watch out for that might

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:20.176 A:middle
not only improve your VoiceOver

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:23.756 A:middle
experience but possibly the

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:25.296 A:middle
experience that all users get.

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.476 A:middle
And here's where we're going to

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:29.206 A:middle
start.

00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.836 A:middle
We need to know how to use

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:31.456 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:34.296 A:middle
Now in the next slide, I'm going

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:35.136 A:middle
to show you how to enable

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:36.046 A:middle
VoiceOver in settings.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.486 A:middle
What I don't cover in the next

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:40.056 A:middle
slide is how to navigate with

00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:41.666 A:middle
VoiceOver, activate with

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.936 A:middle
VoiceOver, heck even turn

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:44.916 A:middle
VoiceOver off using VoiceOver.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.696 A:middle
So if you're following along out

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:47.846 A:middle
there on your iOS device, you

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:50.166 A:middle
may want to wait.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.056 A:middle
But I promise you, everyone in

00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:53.886 A:middle
this room is going to have a

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
chance to turn on VoiceOver

00:06:55.046 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
before my presentation is done.

00:06:55.046 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
before my presentation is done.

00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:02.116 A:middle
So how do we turn on VoiceOver?

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.926 A:middle
Well, it starts in settings, and

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:04.596 A:middle
we go to general.

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:07.576 A:middle
In general, I can open up the

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.506 A:middle
accessibility menu.

00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:10.396 A:middle
It's a great list of all the

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.136 A:middle
features that we include on our

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
iOS devices so that we can have

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.756 A:middle
equal access to our users.

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.726 A:middle
And VoiceOver is right at the

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:22.476 A:middle
top of that list, but I

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:23.786 A:middle
discourage you from opening it

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
there.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:26.116 A:middle
I discourage you from going in

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:27.916 A:middle
and enabling VoiceOver because,

00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:29.906 A:middle
again, we might not know enough

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:31.266 A:middle
about VoiceOver to turn it back

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:31.676 A:middle
off.

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
So when I teach people how to

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.116 A:middle
use VoiceOver for the first

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:37.916 A:middle
time, I encourage you to go to

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
the bottom of this list to the

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:41.316 A:middle
accessibility shortcut.

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:45.866 A:middle
It's here inside of a list of

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:46.406 A:middle
options.

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:49.206 A:middle
If I just check VoiceOver, that

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:50.096 A:middle
means I can easily turn

00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:51.866 A:middle
VoiceOver on when I want to test

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:54.856 A:middle
it and also turn VoiceOver back

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:56.406 A:middle
off when I'm not ready to test

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:58.966 A:middle
it or my phone goes to sleep or

00:07:58.966 --> 00:07:59.656 A:middle
I get a phone.

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.646 A:middle
So just checking VoiceOver in

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
this box I can turn it on by

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.326 A:middle
triple clicking the home button.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:07.296 A:middle
Click, click, click.

00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
And if you have a brand new

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.576 A:middle
device that doesn't have a home

00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:11.966 A:middle
button, well then you'd use the

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:14.226 A:middle
side button, click, click,

00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:16.376 A:middle
click.

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:18.866 A:middle
When VoiceOver is enabled, we

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.186 A:middle
see the VoiceOver cursor.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.586 A:middle
It's a visual reinforcement of

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:24.306 A:middle
what VoiceOver is trying to

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.316 A:middle
describe, and that's the first

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.406 A:middle
objective when testing

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.366 A:middle
VoiceOver, is to make sure that

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:32.645 A:middle
these descriptions are accurate

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.275 A:middle
and complete.

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:35.556 A:middle
And the only way you're going to

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.596 A:middle
test every single element inside

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:40.515 A:middle
of your app is to navigate with

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:42.966 A:middle
VoiceOver, and here's how to do

00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:44.116 A:middle
it.

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.696 A:middle
Navigating can be as easy as

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:46.816 A:middle
just reaching out and touching

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:47.276 A:middle
the screen.

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:49.306 A:middle
Dragging your finger across the

00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
screen, VoiceOver will just read

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:52.306 A:middle
whatever is under your finger.

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:57.506 A:middle
But that's actually not really

00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
how a lot of people review their

00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
how a lot of people review their

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:00.506 A:middle
apps.

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:02.766 A:middle
I start at the top.

00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.116 A:middle
I work through everything in

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
read order to the very end.

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:08.446 A:middle
VoiceOver users accomplish using

00:09:08.446 --> 00:09:10.626 A:middle
flick navigation, and that's

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
taking my finger and putting it

00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:13.166 A:middle
on the screen and then flicking

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.536 A:middle
to the right, flicking to the

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:14.766 A:middle
right.

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.746 A:middle
Now if I went slow enough, it

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:17.846 A:middle
would just read under my finger,

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:19.506 A:middle
so you have to really give it a

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.306 A:middle
quick flick until your finger

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:22.306 A:middle
flies off the screen.

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:24.316 A:middle
And conversely, I could go back

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:26.346 A:middle
to the left, and I could go to

00:09:26.346 --> 00:09:27.766 A:middle
the previous item or the next

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:28.166 A:middle
item.

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:31.886 A:middle
And it's important that you also

00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:33.236 A:middle
want to keep in mind the

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:34.766 A:middle
starting position of your

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:37.066 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor, because if

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:37.906 A:middle
will start in the middle of your

00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:38.456 A:middle
page.

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:41.456 A:middle
Well, that would assume as a

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.326 A:middle
user that there isn't anything

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:45.366 A:middle
before it, and so you might be

00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
leaving your users without all

00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:48.876 A:middle
the story.

00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:53.236 A:middle
So, we have two ways to

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:56.196 A:middle
navigate, and we have no way to

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.756 A:middle
control how a user navigates.

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:00.016 A:middle
So you want to test both these

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:00.016 A:middle
So you want to test both these

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.836 A:middle
ways to make sure they work as

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:03.506 A:middle
expected in your app.

00:10:05.296 --> 00:10:06.656 A:middle
Now while you're navigating your

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:08.416 A:middle
app, you may need to pause that

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:08.806 A:middle
output.

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:11.086 A:middle
So, if you ever need to have so

00:10:11.086 --> 00:10:13.436 A:middle
stop speaking, just take two

00:10:13.436 --> 00:10:14.546 A:middle
fingers and tap the screen.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.626 A:middle
And if you make that peace sign

00:10:17.626 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
again and tap the screen,

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:19.666 A:middle
VoiceOver will just pick up

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:20.776 A:middle
right where you left off.

00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:25.876 A:middle
Now, if you accidentally enabled

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
VoiceOver earlier in settings

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.866 A:middle
when I said not to, don't worry.

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:30.556 A:middle
You're halfway to turning it

00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:31.236 A:middle
back off.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:32.966 A:middle
But there's one piece that's

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.046 A:middle
still missing, and that's

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:35.556 A:middle
activating.

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:37.176 A:middle
You know, we take for granted

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:38.536 A:middle
that if I see a button on the

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:39.856 A:middle
screen I just tap it and it

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:42.736 A:middle
opens, but with VoiceOver when I

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:45.226 A:middle
tap an element, it describes it

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:46.946 A:middle
to me, and it gives me the

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:47.896 A:middle
choice to decide.

00:10:48.406 --> 00:10:49.766 A:middle
Do I want to open this element

00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:52.656 A:middle
or do I want to move to another?

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.376 A:middle
So, when I reach out and I hear

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:56.746 A:middle
a description of what I want to

00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:59.056 A:middle
open, then I follow that up with

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:00.336 A:middle
a single finger, double tap,

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:00.336 A:middle
a single finger, double tap,

00:11:00.546 --> 00:11:00.986 A:middle
tap, tap.

00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:04.026 A:middle
And the selected item will open.

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:10.306 A:middle
So to illustrate how navigating

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:11.816 A:middle
and activating with VoiceOver,

00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:13.736 A:middle
well, I'd like to welcome to my

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:15.296 A:middle
stage my colleague, Ryan Dour,

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:16.246 A:middle

00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:23.696 A:middle
Thanks James.

00:11:24.126 --> 00:11:26.146 A:middle
So you guys have all heard about

00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:28.246 A:middle
how VoiceOver is used, but in

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:29.456 A:middle
order to really see this thing

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:30.806 A:middle
in action, we got to turn it on.

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:32.076 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead here,

00:11:32.076 --> 00:11:33.086 A:middle
and on this phone, I have an

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:34.136 A:middle
iPhone X, I'm going to triple

00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:34.976 A:middle
click the side button.

00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:36.766 A:middle
There we go.

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:39.456 A:middle

Facetime.

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:46.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go, okay.

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:47.306 A:middle
Fantastic.

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:49.976 A:middle
So we've started off here on the

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:50.966 A:middle
home screen, and the first thing

00:11:50.966 --> 00:11:52.796 A:middle
I'd like to show you is that

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.216 A:middle
we've got a VoiceOver cursor on

00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:55.296 A:middle
the Facetime icon.

00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:56.806 A:middle
It's a black cursor.

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:58.576 A:middle
That's going to follow me

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.176 A:middle
everywhere I go while I'm using

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.176 A:middle
everywhere I go while I'm using

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:02.276 A:middle
VoiceOver, and there's really

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:03.366 A:middle
several different ways that we

00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:04.606 A:middle
can move the VoiceOver cursor

00:12:04.606 --> 00:12:04.876 A:middle
around.

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:06.046 A:middle
The first is that I can reach

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
out and touch just about

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.566 A:middle
anything on the screen, and the

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:09.876 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor is going to

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:11.376 A:middle
follow along, and it's also

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:12.426 A:middle
going to speak that item.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:13.346 A:middle
So if I just reach out and

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:13.606 A:middle
touch--

00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:14.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Reminders.

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:16.596 A:middle
One task due today.

00:12:17.356 --> 00:12:17.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:20.676 A:middle
I can also just drag my finger

00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:21.816 A:middle
around the screen to move that

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor, and it's going

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:25.756 A:middle
to follow along, so I'll try

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:26.186 A:middle
that.

00:12:26.186 --> 00:12:26.926 A:middle

navigation.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:31.166 A:middle
If I flick left.

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Maps.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I move back an item.

00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:34.636 A:middle
If I flick right.

00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:35.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Weather.

00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:36.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I move right an item.

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:37.666 A:middle
And this reads left to right,

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:38.466 A:middle
top to bottom.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:39.956 A:middle

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:40.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; See how it wrapped to the

next line there?

00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:44.276 A:middle
So from here I can actually go

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:46.436 A:middle
ahead and if I want flick my way

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.626 A:middle

00:13:03.256 --> 00:13:05.126 A:middle
the entire thing, so I paused it

00:13:05.126 --> 00:13:06.296 A:middle
with a two-finger tap, again,

00:13:06.296 --> 00:13:07.786 A:middle
using that peace sign, just

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.026 A:middle
performed that two-finger tap,

00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:09.906 A:middle
and it paused the speech.

00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:10.626 A:middle
If I do it again.

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:12.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thursday, clear.

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:14.056 A:middle
High 76.

00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:14.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This feature zooms.

00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:15.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Low 52.

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:16.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And, again, I can pause it.

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:18.336 A:middle
That way I can send it back to

00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:18.636 A:middle
James.

00:13:18.636 --> 00:13:19.166 A:middle
Thanks James.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:25.706 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:26.766 A:middle
Thanks Ryan.

00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:31.576 A:middle
Now I just want to stop here and

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:34.136 A:middle
point out that using these steps

00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:36.286 A:middle
alone you can actually start

00:13:36.286 --> 00:13:37.576 A:middle
testing your app with VoiceOver.

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:39.136 A:middle
You can turn it on.

00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:41.216 A:middle
You can navigate your app, and

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:42.696 A:middle
you can see how well it works

00:13:44.096 --> 00:13:45.236 A:middle
but just with VoiceOver on.

00:13:45.936 --> 00:13:48.686 A:middle
So now the other side of testing

00:13:48.686 --> 00:13:50.616 A:middle
VoiceOver is about getting

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:51.896 A:middle
familiar with the expected

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:53.746 A:middle
result, and that means getting

00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:56.716 A:middle
outside your app and starting to

00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:58.046 A:middle
experience areas that already

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.266 A:middle
have a good VoiceOver

00:13:59.266 --> 00:13:59.966 A:middle
experience.

00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:02.976 A:middle
So here's how we do that.

00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:05.386 A:middle
Now if I needed to go home,

00:14:05.876 --> 00:14:06.826 A:middle
well, I could press the home

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:07.136 A:middle
button.

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:09.536 A:middle
But on a new device, like iPhone

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:12.596 A:middle
X, we need to go home by taking

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:14.006 A:middle
our finger from the very bottom

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
edge of your device and starting

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:16.516 A:middle
to slide it up.

00:14:17.246 --> 00:14:19.836 A:middle
The first vibration I feel will

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:22.236 A:middle
go home, and if I keep dragging

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.076 A:middle
up, the second vibration I feel

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:25.506 A:middle
will open the app switcher.

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:27.596 A:middle
I can also repeat this gesture

00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:29.016 A:middle
from the very top edge of my

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:31.426 A:middle
display and open things like the

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.536 A:middle
Navigation Center and the

00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:34.236 A:middle
Control Center.

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:39.116 A:middle
And when you're not testing your

00:14:39.116 --> 00:14:41.786 A:middle
app, you can three-finger flick.

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:43.176 A:middle
It's basically the same as a

00:14:43.176 --> 00:14:45.226 A:middle
one-finger flick to allow me to

00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:48.276 A:middle
scroll or move between my home

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:48.696 A:middle
screens.

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:50.776 A:middle
But in this case, I'm using

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:51.486 A:middle
three fingers.

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.356 A:middle
So using three fingers back and

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.736 A:middle
forth, up and down, will allow

00:14:55.736 --> 00:14:57.046 A:middle
me to get to those areas.

00:14:57.386 --> 00:14:58.306 A:middle
So whether or not you're

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
exploring other apps or going

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
exploring other apps or going

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:01.506 A:middle
into Control Center or

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:03.126 A:middle
Notification Center, these areas

00:15:03.126 --> 00:15:06.076 A:middle
are full of complex UI that's

00:15:06.076 --> 00:15:07.626 A:middle
waiting to teach you the

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:09.716 A:middle
expected results when we focus

00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:14.266 A:middle
the VoiceOver cursor on them.

00:15:14.946 --> 00:15:16.746 A:middle
Now another gesture you may need

00:15:16.986 --> 00:15:18.316 A:middle
is called the two-finger scrub,

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:20.066 A:middle
and that's where I take that

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:22.586 A:middle
same two-finger tap from before,

00:15:23.146 --> 00:15:24.756 A:middle
but instead of letting go, I

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:25.806 A:middle
scrub back and forth very

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:27.486 A:middle
quickly, almost like in a fast Z

00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:29.606 A:middle
pattern, and that will allow me

00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:32.296 A:middle
to get out of a window without

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.806 A:middle
having to navigate back to

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.826 A:middle
cancel buttons or back buttons.

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:37.956 A:middle
Or in the case of UI, where they

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:39.446 A:middle
don't even have close buttons,

00:15:39.796 --> 00:15:41.856 A:middle
to quickly scrub back and forth

00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:43.356 A:middle
and dismiss the window.

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.436 A:middle
So while we're busy navigating

00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:49.266 A:middle
and exploring and learning about

00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:52.486 A:middle
this great expected behavior, we

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:53.456 A:middle
also kind of need to know what

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:54.236 A:middle
we're listening for.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:58.166 A:middle
So when you open a newspaper,

00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.196 A:middle
you receive a lot more visual

00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.196 A:middle
you receive a lot more visual

00:16:00.196 --> 00:16:02.236 A:middle
information than just words on a

00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:02.776 A:middle
page.

00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:06.066 A:middle
Here's that same newspaper.

00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:10.776 A:middle
If we fail to infer all of that

00:16:10.776 --> 00:16:12.496 A:middle
additional information, like

00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:16.566 A:middle
headings or images, so we need

00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:18.366 A:middle
to explore and listen to

00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.546 A:middle
headings and images, tabs and

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.886 A:middle
buttons, and make sure we're

00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:23.266 A:middle
honoring that experience.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:28.756 A:middle
Now to demonstrate these initial

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.776 A:middle
gestures, here's Ryan Dour.

00:16:31.756 --> 00:16:32.756 A:middle
Cool. Thanks James.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:35.016 A:middle
So we're still here in our

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:36.746 A:middle
weather app, and I would

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.936 A:middle
actually like to go back to the

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:39.366 A:middle
home screen.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.936 A:middle
This is an iPhone X, so in order

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.396 A:middle
to do that, I need to use our

00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:44.396 A:middle
new home gesture, and that is

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.876 A:middle
going to be again, touching my

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:47.606 A:middle
finger at the bottom in the home

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:48.926 A:middle
[inaudible], and then sliding my

00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:50.356 A:middle
finger up until I feel that

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:51.786 A:middle
first vibration to go home.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:53.976 A:middle
VoiceOver will also tell me, if

00:16:53.976 --> 00:16:55.046 A:middle
I haven't let go of the screen

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:56.936 A:middle
yet, that this is exactly what

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.476 A:middle
I'm going to do if I let go.

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
Let's go ahead and check that

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
Let's go ahead and check that

00:17:00.926 --> 00:17:01.096 A:middle
out.

00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:03.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Lift for home.

00:17:03.316 --> 00:17:04.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to do that.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Weather.

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're back on the

00:17:07.296 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
home screen.

00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:10.435 A:middle
Many of us have many pages of

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:11.925 A:middle
apps, so in order to switch

00:17:11.925 --> 00:17:13.455 A:middle
between those with VoiceOver, we

00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:15.146 A:middle
use a three-finger swipe.

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:16.205 A:middle
Actually it's a three-finger

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
flick, but, yeah, it's funny, we

00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
actually interchange that a lot

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:20.986 A:middle
here at Apple.

00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:22.675 A:middle
We say three-finger swipe or

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
three-finger flick, but they're

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.326 A:middle
interchangeable.

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:26.226 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and

00:17:26.356 --> 00:17:28.956 A:middle
three-finger swipe left.

00:17:28.956 --> 00:17:29.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Page three of three.

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:30.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:31.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Utilities folder.

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:32.496 A:middle
Four apps.

00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:33.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:34.946 A:middle
double tap on this utilities

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:38.356 A:middle
folder so that we can explore

00:17:38.356 --> 00:17:38.916 A:middle
the inside.

00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:40.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Utilities, heading.

00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:41.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's explore.

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:42.926 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and flick

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:43.596 A:middle
right.

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Voice memo, compass, measure,

00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:47.416 A:middle
calculate, calculator.

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:48.676 A:middle
Hear that bonk?

00:17:48.756 --> 00:17:49.576 A:middle
I've reached the end.

00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:50.886 A:middle
If I flick left--

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:52.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Measure, compass, voice,

00:17:52.336 --> 00:17:54.636 A:middle
utilities, heading.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:56.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of apps

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:57.976 A:middle
and a great heading here.

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:00.026 A:middle
However, there's no apparent way

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:00.026 A:middle
However, there's no apparent way

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:01.106 A:middle
to close this folder.

00:18:02.126 --> 00:18:03.306 A:middle
Without voiceover on, you would

00:18:03.306 --> 00:18:04.936 A:middle
just tap outside of the folder's

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:06.636 A:middle
area in order to be able to

00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:08.636 A:middle
close it, but with VoiceOver, we

00:18:08.636 --> 00:18:09.716 A:middle
use the two-finger scrub.

00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:12.126 A:middle
Now, you can use it just as

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:13.766 A:middle
James described it, like a Z

00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:15.366 A:middle
gesture, but I'm a DJ, and I

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:16.456 A:middle
kind of think of it more like a

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:17.606 A:middle
scrub, like you're scratching a

00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:17.966 A:middle
record.

00:18:18.316 --> 00:18:19.346 A:middle
So let's go ahead and take those

00:18:19.346 --> 00:18:21.406 A:middle
two fingers and--

00:18:21.916 --> 00:18:22.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Utilities folder.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:24.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Boom that folder's closed.

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:25.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Four apps.

00:18:25.226 --> 00:18:27.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Cool. Thanks, James.

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:33.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:35.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ryan.

00:18:36.456 --> 00:18:37.806 A:middle
So when faced with a lot of

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:40.726 A:middle
information, a sided user may

00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:42.926 A:middle
choose not to go through every

00:18:42.926 --> 00:18:45.306 A:middle
single object in read order to

00:18:45.306 --> 00:18:46.026 A:middle
the very end.

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:48.486 A:middle
No, instead we choose to pay

00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:49.816 A:middle
attention to maybe a select

00:18:49.816 --> 00:18:51.076 A:middle
group of elements, like these

00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.246 A:middle
headings on this newspaper.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.456 A:middle
VoiceOver's users can also

00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:58.186 A:middle
navigate this way using the

00:18:58.186 --> 00:18:58.686 A:middle
Rotor.

00:18:59.436 --> 00:19:02.616 A:middle
And the Rotor is a VoiceOver

00:18:59.436 --> 00:19:02.616 A:middle
And the Rotor is a VoiceOver

00:19:02.616 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
feature that dynamically

00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:06.356 A:middle
presents options that the user

00:19:06.356 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
can adjust or navigate by.

00:19:10.996 --> 00:19:14.156 A:middle
A VoiceOver user can set the

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:17.096 A:middle
Rotor by making two fingers on

00:19:17.096 --> 00:19:19.226 A:middle
the screen and turning it around

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:20.616 A:middle
a center point, almost like

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:22.206 A:middle
you're turning an invisible knob

00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:22.996 A:middle
on screen.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.896 A:middle
And as we adjust the rotor,

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:27.806 A:middle
it'll speak all the options that

00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:29.376 A:middle
are supported within the view

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.266 A:middle
that we're focused in.

00:19:30.826 --> 00:19:33.566 A:middle
So in this case, we could turn

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:35.176 A:middle
that rotor and switch it to

00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:37.686 A:middle
headings, and once it's set to

00:19:37.686 --> 00:19:39.856 A:middle
headings, I'd be able to go to

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:41.286 A:middle
the next heading by taking a

00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:43.056 A:middle
single finger and flicking down.

00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:45.706 A:middle
Or, conversely, I could flick up

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.496 A:middle
with one finger, and that would

00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:48.596 A:middle
go to the previous heading.

00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:53.146 A:middle
And here's why the Rotor matters

00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:54.436 A:middle
to you as a developer.

00:19:55.506 --> 00:19:58.166 A:middle
Because a Rotor only works if we

00:19:58.166 --> 00:19:59.906 A:middle
as developers remember to

00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.496 A:middle
include headings in our apps.

00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.496 A:middle
include headings in our apps.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:03.666 A:middle
So when your app doesn't support

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:06.226 A:middle
one of these rotor options, well

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:07.616 A:middle
then we're kind of taking a tool

00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:09.666 A:middle
out of that user's toolbox to

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:11.156 A:middle
have a great experience in their

00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:11.846 A:middle
app.

00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:15.436 A:middle
So I invite you to go back into

00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:17.026 A:middle
settings, general,

00:20:17.026 --> 00:20:17.916 A:middle
accessibility.

00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:19.766 A:middle
Inside of the VoiceOver menu is

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:20.886 A:middle
a lot of great settings that

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.706 A:middle
VoiceOver users customize, and

00:20:22.706 --> 00:20:24.476 A:middle
one of them is the Rotor

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:25.066 A:middle
settings.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:27.506 A:middle
So review what we can support

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:29.286 A:middle
and make sure that we are

00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:32.276 A:middle
honoring those in our apps.

00:20:32.516 --> 00:20:33.736 A:middle
So here's Ryan Dour to

00:20:33.736 --> 00:20:35.336 A:middle
demonstrate how the Rotor works.

00:20:35.976 --> 00:20:36.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Cook, thanks James.

00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:39.746 A:middle
So again we're back here on the

00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:40.636 A:middle
home screen.

00:20:40.636 --> 00:20:42.016 A:middle
We're on our second page of

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:44.126 A:middle
apps, and I'm going to open the

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:44.606 A:middle
App Store.

00:20:44.606 --> 00:20:45.556 A:middle
So I'm going to flick once,

00:20:45.556 --> 00:20:45.816 A:middle
right.

00:20:46.096 --> 00:20:46.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; App Store.

00:20:46.806 --> 00:20:47.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.076 A:middle
Image going to double tap again

00:20:49.076 --> 00:20:50.246 A:middle
to activate.

00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:51.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Apps, heading.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I'm on the apps tab of the

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:54.426 A:middle
App Store.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:55.886 A:middle
There are an awful lot of

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:57.306 A:middle
fantastic apps here.

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:59.386 A:middle
However, I don't want to have to

00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:00.736 A:middle
explore each and every one of

00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:00.736 A:middle
explore each and every one of

00:21:00.736 --> 00:21:01.796 A:middle
them to get to the various

00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:02.516 A:middle
categories.

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:05.136 A:middle
So I can actually touch one of

00:21:05.466 --> 00:21:05.586 A:middle
them.

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:08.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; WWDC18, celebrating the Apple

00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:10.026 A:middle
design award winners.

00:21:10.376 --> 00:21:11.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm pausing this speech

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.026 A:middle
again with that two-finger tap.

00:21:14.386 --> 00:21:16.226 A:middle
Now, to do the Rotor gesture,

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:18.336 A:middle
all I have to do is take two

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:19.966 A:middle
fingers and turn either

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:21.486 A:middle
clockwise or counterclockwise.

00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:25.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Characters, words, headings.

00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:26.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There's the one I want.

00:21:26.376 --> 00:21:27.786 A:middle
As soon as I let go, I am on

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:28.306 A:middle
that rotor.

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:29.846 A:middle
Now, if I flick down--

00:21:30.126 --> 00:21:32.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; New apps we love, best new

00:21:32.126 --> 00:21:34.576 A:middle
updates, stream yourself selfie

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:36.506 A:middle
with light skin tone, heading.

00:21:36.886 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, if I flick up--

00:21:39.136 --> 00:21:41.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Best new updates, new apps we

00:21:41.436 --> 00:21:42.546 A:middle
love, heading.

00:21:42.786 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I move back up that list, and

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:46.506 A:middle
of course if I want, I can go

00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:49.076 A:middle
ahead and dive into a category,

00:21:49.186 --> 00:21:51.926 A:middle
but before I do, I want to tell

00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:53.216 A:middle
you guys about one more gesture,

00:21:53.366 --> 00:21:55.006 A:middle
one that is, at least for me,

00:21:55.176 --> 00:21:56.106 A:middle
extremely important.

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:58.186 A:middle
So James started this whole

00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.216 A:middle
thing off with asking you a very

00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.216 A:middle
thing off with asking you a very

00:22:00.216 --> 00:22:01.946 A:middle
important question, which is, is

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.116 A:middle
your app easy enough to use with

00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
your eyes closed?

00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
And I'm going to guess that for

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:08.726 A:middle
a lot of you, you might say,

00:22:08.726 --> 00:22:10.176 A:middle
geez, I have no idea.

00:22:10.926 --> 00:22:14.356 A:middle
I'm going to find out, but for

00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:16.476 A:middle
me that is my experience.

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:17.896 A:middle
I don't get to see your app.

00:22:17.896 --> 00:22:19.206 A:middle
I cants see your app.

00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:21.176 A:middle
So for me I really need that

00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:22.656 A:middle
question to actually be the most

00:22:22.656 --> 00:22:24.026 A:middle
serious one you ask yourself.

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:27.346 A:middle
Now, keeping your eyes closed is

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.036 A:middle
a challenge.

00:22:28.136 --> 00:22:29.446 A:middle
It's very difficult to keep it

00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.046 A:middle
up, and also you might want to

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:31.906 A:middle
be looking at your computer,

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:32.986 A:middle
taking notes, and doing other

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:33.266 A:middle
things.

00:22:34.016 --> 00:22:35.746 A:middle
So in order to do this, the most

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:37.636 A:middle
effective way I know possible, I

00:22:37.636 --> 00:22:39.336 A:middle
encourage you to use the screen

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:39.726 A:middle
curtain.

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.036 A:middle
The screen curtain blacks out

00:22:42.036 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
your entire screen and puts you

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:45.506 A:middle
in my shoes.

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:47.726 A:middle
You have a chance to use your

00:22:47.726 --> 00:22:49.756 A:middle
app the way I use it entirely,

00:22:50.296 --> 00:22:51.476 A:middle
and there's no cheating here.

00:22:51.806 --> 00:22:53.266 A:middle
That is the only interface

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:54.066 A:middle
you're going to get.

00:22:54.366 --> 00:22:55.176 A:middle
Let's turn it on.

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.436 A:middle
So three-finger triple tap.

00:22:57.806 --> 00:22:59.466 A:middle
Again, three fingers, three

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:00.096 A:middle
times.

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:00.096 A:middle
times.

00:23:01.106 --> 00:23:02.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Screen curtain on.

00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:03.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:06.066 A:middle
At this point, we're on the same

00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:09.476 A:middle
plane, and if I, again, flick

00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:09.846 A:middle
down--

00:23:10.276 --> 00:23:12.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Best new updates, heading.

00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:13.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I flick right, let's

00:23:13.306 --> 00:23:14.106 A:middle
start exploring.

00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:15.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; See all, button.

00:23:15.966 --> 00:23:17.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Of course now I know that's a

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:18.816 A:middle
button, and I can activate that

00:23:18.816 --> 00:23:19.076 A:middle
button.

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:21.096 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and do

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:21.836 A:middle
a double tap.

00:23:21.836 --> 00:23:23.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; See apps, back button.

00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:23.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm in the apps areas, I'm

00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:25.016 A:middle
going to start flicking through

00:23:25.016 --> 00:23:26.306 A:middle
to the right, let's explore.

00:23:26.306 --> 00:23:27.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Best new update, [inaudible]

00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:29.786 A:middle
get, but, world of dinosaurs,

00:23:30.156 --> 00:23:34.086 A:middle
$1.99, in-app purchases, button.

00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:35.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's a lot of information

00:23:35.806 --> 00:23:36.636 A:middle
that you're getting that's

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:37.696 A:middle
usually very visual.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Procreate pocket,

00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:41.046 A:middle
entertainment, button.

00:23:41.226 --> 00:23:42.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And of course, if I want to

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:43.686 A:middle
go back, that two-finger scrub--

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:45.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Apps, heading.

00:23:46.246 --> 00:23:48.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And we're back.

00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:49.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Screen curtain off.

00:23:50.126 --> 00:23:51.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So that is screen curtain,

00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
and I can't encourage you enough

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:54.786 A:middle
to use it because when you make

00:23:54.856 --> 00:23:56.386 A:middle
your app experience something

00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:57.576 A:middle
that you can take VoiceOver

00:23:57.576 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
through, both enjoy and make

00:23:57.576 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
through, both enjoy and make

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.076 A:middle
sure that it's completely

00:24:02.286 --> 00:24:03.906 A:middle
amazing, then so can I.

00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:06.826 A:middle
I can enjoy your app in full if

00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:08.226 A:middle
you take this through as the

00:24:08.226 --> 00:24:09.856 A:middle
final step before you call it

00:24:09.856 --> 00:24:10.136 A:middle
done.

00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:10.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:17.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:18.116 --> 00:24:18.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ryan.

00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:21.616 A:middle
So now it's time to talk about

00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:23.026 A:middle
how VoiceOver can benefit your

00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:23.236 A:middle
app.

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:25.766 A:middle
Because you're ready.

00:24:27.016 --> 00:24:29.786 A:middle
Today you can leave this area

00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:32.636 A:middle
and go and test your app, and I

00:24:32.636 --> 00:24:34.216 A:middle
would encourage you to test it

00:24:34.216 --> 00:24:35.326 A:middle
like you normally would just

00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:36.236 A:middle
with VoiceOver on.

00:24:37.246 --> 00:24:38.356 A:middle
But I want you to pay attention

00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.796 A:middle
to these additional insights

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.366 A:middle
that could make your app better

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:43.856 A:middle
for all users.

00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:48.336 A:middle
So one, if something doesn't

00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:50.346 A:middle
sound right, it may not read

00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:51.046 A:middle
right either.

00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:54.696 A:middle
It's like when a writer reads

00:24:54.696 --> 00:24:56.306 A:middle
something aloud that they wrote.

00:24:57.356 --> 00:24:58.406 A:middle
It's just another way to check

00:24:58.406 --> 00:24:59.476 A:middle
that your message is coming

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:01.266 A:middle
through, and it doesn't just

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:01.266 A:middle
through, and it doesn't just

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:02.806 A:middle
look right, it actually sounds

00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:03.536 A:middle
right as well.

00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:08.646 A:middle
Two, if navigating with

00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:11.096 A:middle
VoiceOver takes effort, it

00:25:11.096 --> 00:25:12.456 A:middle
probably takes a lot of effort

00:25:12.456 --> 00:25:14.646 A:middle
visually as well.

00:25:14.866 --> 00:25:16.136 A:middle
So maybe it's time to add

00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:17.676 A:middle
section headings or break up

00:25:17.676 --> 00:25:20.296 A:middle
your content to allow users of

00:25:20.296 --> 00:25:21.276 A:middle
your app to benefit from a

00:25:21.276 --> 00:25:22.876 A:middle
cleaner, more straightforward

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:25.466 A:middle
visual and spoken experience.

00:25:29.076 --> 00:25:32.466 A:middle
Three, if your app sounds out of

00:25:32.466 --> 00:25:37.296 A:middle
order, your content may be too.

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:39.566 A:middle
VoiceOver navigates your app in

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:40.186 A:middle
read order.

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:42.106 A:middle
So if you're navigating your app

00:25:42.106 --> 00:25:43.906 A:middle
wondering where's the login?

00:25:44.286 --> 00:25:45.956 A:middle
Well, likely is a lot of your

00:25:45.956 --> 00:25:47.376 A:middle
audience asking the same

00:25:47.376 --> 00:25:47.986 A:middle
question.

00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:51.486 A:middle
There it is.

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:55.476 A:middle
So these issues can't hide from

00:25:55.476 --> 00:25:56.746 A:middle
VoiceOver and neither should

00:25:56.746 --> 00:25:57.046 A:middle
you.

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.546 A:middle
So let's turn it on.

00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:01.226 A:middle
Are you guys ready?

00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:02.716 A:middle
Come on, do you remember how?

00:26:02.716 --> 00:26:05.036 A:middle
All right, let's review then,

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:05.366 A:middle
all right.

00:26:05.366 --> 00:26:07.586 A:middle
So inside of settings, we're

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:08.326 A:middle
going to go to general.

00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:10.146 A:middle
If you have an iOS device, feel

00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:12.776 A:middle
free to take it out.

00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:14.376 A:middle
Inside of general is

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:15.306 A:middle
accessibility.

00:26:19.296 --> 00:26:21.416 A:middle
Accessibility, we're going to

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:22.896 A:middle
ignore the very top of the

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:25.186 A:middle
screen, and we're going to go

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:26.236 A:middle
all the way to the bottom.

00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:28.876 A:middle
If we can enable today the

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:31.236 A:middle
accessibility shortcut, not only

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:32.086 A:middle
are we going to have a chance to

00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:33.386 A:middle
turn on VoiceOver, potentially

00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:34.646 A:middle
for the very first time, but

00:26:35.256 --> 00:26:36.696 A:middle
it's also a quick way to go back

00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:38.566 A:middle
and turn it on again, back to

00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:39.626 A:middle
show your colleagues.

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.426 A:middle
Turn it on again when you go

00:26:41.426 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
back to your office or maybe

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:44.456 A:middle
when you're trying to make a

00:26:44.456 --> 00:26:46.926 A:middle
case for trying to give more

00:26:46.926 --> 00:26:49.036 A:middle
resource time to focus on

00:26:49.036 --> 00:26:49.626 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:26:51.206 --> 00:26:54.086 A:middle
So, if we've gone into settings,

00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:56.946 A:middle
general, accessibility, and gone

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:59.356 A:middle
into the accessibility shortcut

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
and checked VoiceOver, now we'll

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
and checked VoiceOver, now we'll

00:27:01.706 --> 00:27:02.966 A:middle
be able to turn on VoiceOver

00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:04.546 A:middle
quickly with the home button.

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:05.486 A:middle
Click, click, click.

00:27:06.286 --> 00:27:07.496 A:middle
Three clicks of the home button

00:27:07.696 --> 00:27:10.246 A:middle
or on iPhone X, three clicks of

00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.496 A:middle
the side button, click, click,

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:11.726 A:middle
click.

00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:14.166 A:middle
Ready to activate VoiceOver.

00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:14.976 A:middle
Let's do that now.

00:27:26.336 --> 00:27:28.576 A:middle
Yeah. And how does it feel,

00:27:28.576 --> 00:27:28.796 A:middle
right?

00:27:30.306 --> 00:27:31.806 A:middle
For a lot of us, it's brand new,

00:27:31.806 --> 00:27:33.466 A:middle
and so we could have mixed

00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:35.306 A:middle
feelings or uncertain feelings.

00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:38.716 A:middle
This could be challenging, but

00:27:38.716 --> 00:27:39.606 A:middle
I've never done anything

00:27:39.606 --> 00:27:40.596 A:middle
worthwhile in my life that

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:41.476 A:middle
wasn't challenging.

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:43.896 A:middle
All right.

00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:45.136 A:middle
So our next challenge will be

00:27:45.136 --> 00:27:46.486 A:middle
turn VoiceOver back off.

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:49.336 A:middle
[laughter] Let's see if we can

00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:49.936 A:middle
do that now.

00:27:51.526 --> 00:27:52.656 A:middle
So with the home button, give it

00:27:52.656 --> 00:27:54.646 A:middle
a triple click, click, click,

00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:55.406 A:middle
click.

00:27:55.566 --> 00:27:57.766 A:middle
Or with the side button on an

00:27:57.836 --> 00:27:58.966 A:middle
iPhone X, click, click, click.

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:06.906 A:middle
So, yes, I'm going to call you

00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:10.526 A:middle
out individually now, and, but

00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:11.576 A:middle
no, in review.

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:14.036 A:middle
VoiceOver is an alternative way

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:14.916 A:middle
of using your app.

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:18.026 A:middle
And you can navigate and

00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
activate elements based on just

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:20.666 A:middle
how they're labeled.

00:28:21.046 --> 00:28:25.456 A:middle
And you can explore other apps

00:28:25.456 --> 00:28:27.076 A:middle
to learn expected behavior.

00:28:28.516 --> 00:28:31.396 A:middle
And then rediscover your app by

00:28:31.396 --> 00:28:33.286 A:middle
hearing it to help identify

00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:34.766 A:middle
other issues.

00:28:35.326 --> 00:28:38.786 A:middle
So here's some steps I want you

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:41.186 A:middle
to do as soon as you leave

00:28:42.236 --> 00:28:42.386 A:middle
today.

00:28:42.566 --> 00:28:44.196 A:middle
Just like Ryan suggested, I want

00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:45.816 A:middle
you to close your eyes and test

00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:46.136 A:middle
your app.

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:49.586 A:middle
So really experience this.

00:28:49.586 --> 00:28:51.626 A:middle
Start identify issues that

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.346 A:middle
prevent users from getting the

00:28:53.346 --> 00:28:55.026 A:middle
most out of your app.

00:28:55.906 --> 00:28:58.456 A:middle
And then open your eyes and

00:28:58.456 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
confirm that experience, because

00:28:58.456 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
confirm that experience, because

00:29:00.716 --> 00:29:02.716 A:middle
if you've ever wondered what a

00:29:02.716 --> 00:29:04.406 A:middle
VoiceOver experience should be,

00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:07.586 A:middle
just remember, the goal is just

00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:09.396 A:middle
to match the experience everyone

00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:09.876 A:middle
else gets.

00:29:10.796 --> 00:29:13.346 A:middle
So compare the two and improve

00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:15.446 A:middle
both based on what you learn.

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:20.526 A:middle
And then make VoiceOver a part

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:21.746 A:middle
of your regular testing.

00:29:22.476 --> 00:29:23.636 A:middle
Talk to your team.

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:26.186 A:middle
Make VoiceOver a part of your

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:27.866 A:middle
practice, not just so that you

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.156 A:middle
can continue to improve your

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:32.026 A:middle
experience with every release,

00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:34.646 A:middle
but also to avoid losing the

00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:37.196 A:middle
lessons that we gained here

00:29:38.536 --> 00:29:38.666 A:middle
today.

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:40.956 A:middle
And lastly, go out there and

00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:43.096 A:middle
teach others what you know

00:29:44.206 --> 00:29:45.246 A:middle
because that's why I'm here

00:29:45.246 --> 00:29:47.546 A:middle
today, because teaching is the

00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:49.416 A:middle
best way I know how to master

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:50.176 A:middle
any subject.

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:55.176 A:middle
Now helping you become a master,

00:29:55.596 --> 00:29:56.716 A:middle
I also want to share these

00:29:56.716 --> 00:29:57.546 A:middle
resources.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.716 A:middle
Apple.com/accessibility is a

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.716 A:middle
Apple.com/accessibility is a

00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:02.116 A:middle
great resource to get to know

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:03.836 A:middle
VoiceOver and other

00:30:03.836 --> 00:30:06.116 A:middle
accessibility features and also

00:30:06.116 --> 00:30:07.726 A:middle
have access to resources such as

00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:09.226 A:middle
the guides, not only to

00:30:09.226 --> 00:30:10.556 A:middle
reinforce what we learned today

00:30:10.556 --> 00:30:11.476 A:middle
but build on it.

00:30:12.116 --> 00:30:13.466 A:middle
And the same is true for

00:30:13.466 --> 00:30:15.316 A:middle
developer.apple.com/

00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:18.966 A:middle
accessibility/ios.

00:30:19.476 --> 00:30:22.836 A:middle
And for more information, feel

00:30:22.836 --> 00:30:24.026 A:middle
free to rewatch this video.

00:30:24.676 --> 00:30:25.946 A:middle
Anytime we do something for the

00:30:25.946 --> 00:30:28.026 A:middle
first time, it's hard to master,

00:30:28.866 --> 00:30:29.766 A:middle
so watch it again.

00:30:30.356 --> 00:30:32.936 A:middle
Practice with me until it feels

00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:34.486 A:middle
comfortable and you're ready to

00:30:34.486 --> 00:30:34.856 A:middle
share.

00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:36.746 A:middle
And also, take advantage of

00:30:36.746 --> 00:30:38.046 A:middle
these other opportunities.

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:40.696 A:middle
For instance, tomorrow starting

00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.446 A:middle
at 7:00 in the morning until

00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:44.276 A:middle
7:30, you can sign up for

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:46.436 A:middle
accessibility design by

00:30:46.436 --> 00:30:48.906 A:middle
appointment lab, and that will

00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:50.646 A:middle
allow you to talk to an engineer

00:30:50.646 --> 00:30:52.186 A:middle
like me, who can also help you

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:54.026 A:middle
go through your app, identify

00:30:54.026 --> 00:30:55.566 A:middle
issues, and then you can take

00:30:55.566 --> 00:30:57.516 A:middle
those issues to the

00:30:57.516 --> 00:30:59.576 A:middle
accessibility lab and technology

00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:02.016 A:middle
lab nine tomorrow at 11 a.m. so

00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:02.016 A:middle
lab nine tomorrow at 11 a.m. so

00:31:02.086 --> 00:31:02.716 A:middle
you can meet with other

00:31:02.716 --> 00:31:03.606 A:middle
engineers and say, how do I

00:31:03.606 --> 00:31:04.796 A:middle
start fixing some of these

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:05.226 A:middle
issues?

00:31:05.386 --> 00:31:06.656 A:middle
How do I start improving that

00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:07.256 A:middle
experience?

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.386 A:middle
And then, also go to deliver an

00:31:10.386 --> 00:31:11.766 A:middle
exceptional accessibility

00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:12.296 A:middle
experience.

00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:14.446 A:middle
That's the book and presentation

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:15.796 A:middle
to the presentation that you

00:31:15.796 --> 00:31:16.556 A:middle
watch today.

00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:19.026 A:middle
We showed you how to start using

00:31:19.026 --> 00:31:20.856 A:middle
VoiceOvers to identify issues,

00:31:21.526 --> 00:31:23.626 A:middle
and tomorrow we'll take the

00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:25.116 A:middle
stage again, and we'll start

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.376 A:middle
showing you how to resolve some

00:31:26.376 --> 00:31:27.166 A:middle
of those issues.

00:31:29.056 --> 00:31:29.976 A:middle
Thank you everyone.

00:31:30.516 --> 00:31:34.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
