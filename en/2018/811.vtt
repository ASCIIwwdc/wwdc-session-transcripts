[ Applause ]

00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:20.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:21.586 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:27.236 A:middle
Design is hard but design

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.516 A:middle
presentations are way harder.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.556 A:middle
I still find them daunting.

00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:37.476 A:middle
And today, a presentation about

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.376 A:middle
how to present design work at

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:40.296 A:middle
WWDC.

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.046 A:middle
The struggle is real.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.286 A:middle
In any presentation, we have to

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.326 A:middle
take this big and complex topic

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:52.506 A:middle
and explain it precisely.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.876 A:middle
Take it right down to its

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:55.706 A:middle
nucleus.

00:00:56.436 --> 00:00:57.976 A:middle
And if we don't do that well,

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.776 A:middle
those ideas might die.

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.776 A:middle
those ideas might die.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
All that hard work you did

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.686 A:middle
resigned to the depths of your

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:06.000 A:middle
hard drive.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:08.636 A:middle
Presentation matters.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.146 A:middle
As a designer at Apple, I have

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.616 A:middle
to present design work all the

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:14.006 A:middle
time.

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.626 A:middle
Unfortunately, this year I can't

00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:19.546 A:middle
show you too much of that, but

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.186 A:middle
I'm going to try and transmit to

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.266 A:middle
you the ten most important

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.826 A:middle
things I've learned about

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.386 A:middle
presenting design work in the

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.786 A:middle
next nine minutes or so.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.656 A:middle
It's going to be punchy.

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.506 A:middle
Now when you really think about

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:35.726 A:middle
it, there are three fundamental

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.346 A:middle
parts to a presentation.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:41.086 A:middle
There is me, the presenter, the

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:44.356 A:middle
emotional designer consumed by

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.966 A:middle
this problem and the prettiness

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:47.976 A:middle
of it.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:50.136 A:middle
And there is you, the audience,

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:53.146 A:middle
detectives of design crime,

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:55.956 A:middle
guardians of good sense,

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:58.676 A:middle
Draculas of deadlines, and

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
captains of code.

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
captains of code.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.306 A:middle
And between us, there is this

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.376 A:middle
central idea.

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.006 A:middle
The thing we need to agree is

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.286 A:middle
good for our company, good for

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:11.266 A:middle
our customers, something that

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.846 A:middle
makes the world a slightly

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:13.776 A:middle
better place.

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:15.766 A:middle
Let's call it a toaster.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.976 A:middle
And really a presentation is

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:22.046 A:middle
just a mechanism to exchange

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.836 A:middle
information about that idea, to

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:27.126 A:middle
facilitate decisions and action

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.836 A:middle
one way or another, to make this

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:33.906 A:middle
thing fly or crash right back

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.106 A:middle
down to Earth.

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:39.166 A:middle
So dear presenter, these are the

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.886 A:middle
key things you need to

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:41.546 A:middle
understand.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.396 A:middle
What are your objectives for

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.306 A:middle
this presentation?

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.756 A:middle
Clarify your objectives.

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.546 A:middle
Are you trying to get this work

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:55.556 A:middle
approved by your superiors or

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:57.136 A:middle
successfully communicate with

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:57.766 A:middle
engineers?

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
Maybe you're pitching a new

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
Maybe you're pitching a new

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:01.116 A:middle
idea.

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:04.246 A:middle
Try to imagine what succeeding

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:06.286 A:middle
looks like and work backwards

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.256 A:middle
from there.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
Identify the questions you need

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.666 A:middle
your audience to help you

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:12.006 A:middle
answer.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.706 A:middle
State these and your goals up

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
front.

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:20.756 A:middle
And understand the objectives of

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:21.706 A:middle
your audience.

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:23.376 A:middle
What do they care about?

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.986 A:middle
Remember, your objectives

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.146 A:middle
include addressing theirs.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:33.326 A:middle
Try not to dive in to details

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:36.216 A:middle
and minutia before you clarify

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.036 A:middle
the bigger picture.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.866 A:middle
Next is a big one: feedback.

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:47.406 A:middle
As designers, we feel vulnerable

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:50.326 A:middle
and exposed, painting our finest

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:52.276 A:middle
pictures and teeing them up to

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.736 A:middle
be torn to shreds.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:56.746 A:middle
Try to entertain the mindset

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:59.496 A:middle
that there is no failure, only

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
feedback.

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
feedback.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:05.116 A:middle
Take all of it seriously even

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:05.936 A:middle
when you disagree.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:08.826 A:middle
If you are presenting, you are

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:09.626 A:middle
asking for feedback.

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:15.086 A:middle
It's the whole point and clarify

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.406 A:middle
the problems the audience

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:17.125 A:middle
identify.

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:19.886 A:middle
Sometimes people offer solutions

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
that are unworkable, but the

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.356 A:middle
problem they are addressing is

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.226 A:middle
totally valid.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.656 A:middle
So when you have exhausted all

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:31.156 A:middle
possibilities, remember this,

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.936 A:middle
you really haven't.

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:36.556 A:middle
People in your audience will

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.156 A:middle
know things you don't.

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:40.356 A:middle
So be willing to change your

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:42.366 A:middle
position, especially when new

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.000 A:middle
information has been presented.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:50.286 A:middle
Don't pretend to understand

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:51.406 A:middle
unclear feedback.

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
Clarify the problem this person

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:58.666 A:middle
is trying to address.

00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:03.006 A:middle
Don't respond like that.

00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:03.006 A:middle
Don't respond like that.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.826 A:middle
And don't be dismissive or get

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
overly defensive.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.916 A:middle
It really won't help your case.

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:12.586 A:middle
Seek advice.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:16.846 A:middle
Use the wisdom of your

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:17.306 A:middle
colleagues.

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:20.016 A:middle
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.236 A:middle
They know how this works.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.946 A:middle
Their input is priceless.

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:25.786 A:middle
Practice with them.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.596 A:middle
Sense check your deck.

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.026 A:middle
Do a full practice run if it

00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:30.606 A:middle
merits it.

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.616 A:middle
Do not deliver it blind.

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:34.836 A:middle
The feedback will make a huge

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:35.416 A:middle
difference.

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
And honestly, don't try to do

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.756 A:middle
everything yourself.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
Teamwork makes the dream work

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:47.536 A:middle
plus it's really hard to keep

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:48.836 A:middle
track of too many disparate

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:51.076 A:middle
things as one person, let alone

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:53.336 A:middle
try and explain them to others

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:54.856 A:middle
in a single presentation.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
Use your own voice.

00:05:58.456 --> 00:05:59.366 A:middle
Be genuine.

00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:01.686 A:middle
Have fun.

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:03.476 A:middle
Make terrible jokes.

00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:06.926 A:middle
Quote Bruce Lee.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
You wouldn't be giving this

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:09.626 A:middle
presentation at all if you

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:10.816 A:middle
didn't have the credibility.

00:06:10.946 --> 00:06:13.626 A:middle
You've earned it.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:14.986 A:middle
Express your opinion.

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:16.686 A:middle
You are the expert here.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.536 A:middle
The audience wants to know what

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:20.386 A:middle
you think and that doesn't mean

00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
you have to have all the

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:21.696 A:middle
answers.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.366 A:middle
Show your passion.

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.496 A:middle
Why do you care about this?

00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:29.796 A:middle
And explain your process.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:31.436 A:middle
Show the journey you've been on.

00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
How and why did you reach these

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:35.116 A:middle
conclusions?

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:40.456 A:middle
Don't be overconfident or

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:41.476 A:middle
insincere.

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.956 A:middle
Sometimes designers can adopt a

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:45.386 A:middle
posture of being super

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:47.426 A:middle
confident, bordering on arrogant

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:48.796 A:middle
and avoid that.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:50.056 A:middle
It's just not cool.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:52.706 A:middle
And don't say what you think

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:53.986 A:middle
people want to hear.

00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:56.576 A:middle
Your vote counts for a lot.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.726 A:middle
The audience.

00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:02.346 A:middle
It's not a presentation without

00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:03.086 A:middle
an audience.

00:07:03.896 --> 00:07:05.636 A:middle
Make sure you show them that

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:06.226 A:middle
respect.

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.686 A:middle
You need their cooperation to

00:07:08.686 --> 00:07:10.076 A:middle
give life to your ideas.

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:12.056 A:middle
And if you've presented to this

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:14.716 A:middle
audience before, you'll get --

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:16.396 A:middle
start to get an idea of what

00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:17.176 A:middle
they respond to.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.726 A:middle
Tailor to them as much as you

00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:22.666 A:middle
can and always have an agenda.

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.186 A:middle
Here's what we're going to talk

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.686 A:middle
about in this order.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.276 A:middle
This is also your chance to

00:07:28.276 --> 00:07:30.226 A:middle
assert the point at which you'd

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.576 A:middle
like to field feedback.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.156 A:middle
It almost certainly won't work

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:36.286 A:middle
that way but still do try.

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.076 A:middle
And if you've met previously,

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.566 A:middle
recap what happened.

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:43.636 A:middle
Like when you're engrossed in a

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:45.706 A:middle
series but then life happens and

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:47.226 A:middle
when you pick it up again, you

00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:48.636 A:middle
really grateful for that 30

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:49.796 A:middle
second refresher.

00:07:51.686 --> 00:07:52.716 A:middle
Hey, Zach.

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.656 A:middle
Here's a study of the character

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:56.666 A:middle
that you asked for.

00:07:58.716 --> 00:07:59.696 A:middle
Good feedback.

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
I'm not sure about those emoji

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
I'm not sure about those emoji

00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:02.706 A:middle
either.

00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:04.646 A:middle
Integrate their feedback.

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:06.706 A:middle
Let them know how it affected

00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:07.526 A:middle
your designs.

00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:10.776 A:middle
Show that you're listening and

00:08:10.776 --> 00:08:12.000 A:middle
responding.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
Terrible.

00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:23.426 A:middle
Make no assumptions, you know --

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.466 A:middle
people know what things mean or

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:27.706 A:middle
why decisions were made.

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:29.686 A:middle
You are much further along this

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:31.036 A:middle
path than your audience.

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:32.956 A:middle
Anticipate their questions.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:34.236 A:middle
Pay attention to their

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:34.885 A:middle
reactions.

00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:36.635 A:middle
And be willing to explain.

00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:39.976 A:middle
Do not show up without a plan or

00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:40.996 A:middle
try to wing it.

00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:42.246 A:middle
It's not a good look.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:44.866 A:middle
And also showing your working

00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:46.636 A:middle
files, not good.

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:48.136 A:middle
These things are lazy and

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:49.906 A:middle
disrespectful of people's time.

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:53.706 A:middle
And, of course, don't be

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:55.576 A:middle
dismissive of -- again, don't be

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:57.326 A:middle
dismissive of anyone's input.

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.976 A:middle
Try to be patient and objective.

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.976 A:middle
Try to be patient and objective.

00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:08.136 A:middle
Make it relatable to your

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:08.706 A:middle
audience.

00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:10.436 A:middle
If not, they may well start to

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:11.046 A:middle
tune out.

00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:13.946 A:middle
Let people see themselves in

00:09:13.946 --> 00:09:14.706 A:middle
your story.

00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:17.226 A:middle
If you can elicit an emotional

00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:19.776 A:middle
response, excitement, worry, or

00:09:19.776 --> 00:09:22.656 A:middle
even fear, it will enhance their

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:24.956 A:middle
sense of commitment.

00:09:24.956 --> 00:09:26.986 A:middle
Ellis goes crazy for that

00:09:26.986 --> 00:09:28.006 A:middle
elderberry jam.

00:09:28.576 --> 00:09:30.396 A:middle
Use what you know about your

00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:32.206 A:middle
audience to your advantage.

00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:36.806 A:middle
Describe what you see and feel.

00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:39.256 A:middle
Don't talk about users like they

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:41.136 A:middle
are a distant third party.

00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:43.956 A:middle
Flow diagrams can be really

00:09:43.956 --> 00:09:45.726 A:middle
useful with engineers but when

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:47.646 A:middle
communicating concepts, there's

00:09:47.646 --> 00:09:48.506 A:middle
a big disconnect.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:51.126 A:middle
Instead, speak in the first

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:51.696 A:middle
person.

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:55.196 A:middle
Here I am at my desk working on

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:57.996 A:middle
my e-mail and ding, a handy

00:09:57.996 --> 00:09:59.446 A:middle
reminder it's time for

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.186 A:middle
breakfast.

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.186 A:middle
breakfast.

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.576 A:middle
I hit the notification and bam,

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:05.446 A:middle
straightaway I can load my toast

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:06.986 A:middle
without even stepping away from

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:07.456 A:middle
my desk.

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:10.296 A:middle
Just one swipe down and we're

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:10.836 A:middle
toasting.

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:13.626 A:middle
And a few minutes later I know

00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:16.056 A:middle
to be on my way, perfect timing.

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:18.346 A:middle
And how cool is that?

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.716 A:middle
I can even see my stats.

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:23.796 A:middle
Clearly, this is more powerful

00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:25.646 A:middle
if you can demo a prototype.

00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:29.206 A:middle
And engage in dialogue.

00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.346 A:middle
A presentation should be a

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:31.876 A:middle
dialogue.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:33.886 A:middle
Engage with your audience.

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:36.996 A:middle
Design for the aha moment.

00:10:37.726 --> 00:10:39.036 A:middle
If you can lead people through

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:41.176 A:middle
your story, their minds will try

00:10:41.176 --> 00:10:42.346 A:middle
and predict the ending.

00:10:43.016 --> 00:10:44.076 A:middle
This will keep them engaged.

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:46.446 A:middle
Ask them questions.

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.176 A:middle
Keep them dialed in.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:49.746 A:middle
You're here for their feedback

00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
after all.

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:55.086 A:middle
Do not deliver a monologue.

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.806 A:middle
This is boring and naive.

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Think of it as a discussion more

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Think of it as a discussion more

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:02.216 A:middle
than a speech.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.956 A:middle
And finally, the idea.

00:11:06.536 --> 00:11:09.736 A:middle
It is crucial to explain why.

00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
Define each problem in a single

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:13.656 A:middle
sentence.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.496 A:middle
It's a great exercise to really

00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:16.976 A:middle
get to the heart of the matter.

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:20.786 A:middle
You'll need to find agreement on

00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:21.956 A:middle
those problem statements with

00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:22.816 A:middle
your audience.

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:24.856 A:middle
Otherwise, you'll be barking up

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:25.886 A:middle
the wrong tree.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:29.626 A:middle
Continue to revisit, refine, and

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:30.996 A:middle
refer back to those statements

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:34.266 A:middle
as you progress and, of course,

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.416 A:middle
where you can, show evidence

00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:37.726 A:middle
that these problems exist.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:39.496 A:middle
Boom.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.916 A:middle
Cold, burnt toast.

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:44.166 A:middle
Tragic problems in this world.

00:11:46.176 --> 00:11:49.366 A:middle
Avoid using subjective reasoning

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:50.996 A:middle
for your decisions.

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.186 A:middle
I chose this color because I

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:55.176 A:middle
like it is not remotely

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:57.796 A:middle
persuasive, especially if your

00:11:57.796 --> 00:11:58.826 A:middle
audience don't share your

00:11:58.826 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
preferences.

00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:03.616 A:middle
And the truth is that people

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:04.926 A:middle
really won't remember your

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:05.616 A:middle
slides.

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:07.566 A:middle
They'll remember how your story

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.906 A:middle
made them feel if it resonated

00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.676 A:middle
with them so sketch out the

00:12:13.676 --> 00:12:15.436 A:middle
narrative of your presentation

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:16.206 A:middle
early.

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.636 A:middle
The most successful designers I

00:12:18.636 --> 00:12:19.386 A:middle
know do this.

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.126 A:middle
It's another thing that will

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:23.206 A:middle
help you focus and use your time

00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:24.116 A:middle
effectively.

00:12:25.306 --> 00:12:27.196 A:middle
So where you can, incorporate a

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:29.746 A:middle
story with a distinct beginning,

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.546 A:middle
middle, and an end.

00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:35.266 A:middle
People intuitively get stories.

00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:37.446 A:middle
And it'll really help them

00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:38.426 A:middle
follow along.

00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:42.636 A:middle
Contrast today's reality with a

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:43.416 A:middle
better future.

00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:47.446 A:middle
Nancy Duarte, a master of

00:12:47.446 --> 00:12:49.606 A:middle
presentations, discovered in her

00:12:49.606 --> 00:12:51.006 A:middle
research that some of the

00:12:51.006 --> 00:12:52.726 A:middle
greatest and most effective

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:54.286 A:middle
presentations follow this

00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:54.666 A:middle
structure.

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.466 A:middle
And the key thing here is

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.076 A:middle
providing the contrast between

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:02.526 A:middle
what is today's reality and what

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:02.526 A:middle
what is today's reality and what

00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:05.236 A:middle
could be, what the future could

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:07.156 A:middle
look like if we make the ideas

00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:08.616 A:middle
we're presenting our new

00:13:08.616 --> 00:13:09.146 A:middle
reality.

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:13.166 A:middle
Today, people are frustrated,

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:16.326 A:middle
cold, joyless toast.

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:17.486 A:middle
It's an epidemic.

00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:20.766 A:middle
But imagine happy, flawless

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.606 A:middle
toast at the top of the button

00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:23.646 A:middle
on your iPhone.

00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:27.416 A:middle
But don't get too carried away.

00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:30.786 A:middle
That is a rookie mistake.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.326 A:middle
Keep it simple.

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:37.476 A:middle
The main thing is to keep the

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:41.956 A:middle
main thing the main thing.

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:44.556 A:middle
I love this quote.

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.046 A:middle
And I always find myself coming

00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:46.526 A:middle
back to it.

00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
It's such a perfect expression.

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:51.726 A:middle
If I had more time, I would have

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:53.066 A:middle
written a shorter letter.

00:13:53.976 --> 00:13:55.466 A:middle
Relevant not only for

00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:58.316 A:middle
presentations and writing

00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
e-mails but as a philosophy

00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
e-mails but as a philosophy

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:01.386 A:middle
toward design.

00:14:02.756 --> 00:14:04.436 A:middle
Don't overload people with too

00:14:04.436 --> 00:14:05.526 A:middle
much information.

00:14:06.156 --> 00:14:08.166 A:middle
Strip away everything that isn't

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
essential to your mission or

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:10.586 A:middle
your message.

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:14.116 A:middle
And finally, don't forget to

00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:14.956 A:middle
summarize.

00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:19.236 A:middle
Know your objectives, otherwise

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:20.416 A:middle
what's the point?

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:22.366 A:middle
Embrace feedback.

00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:23.696 A:middle
It's what you're here for.

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.246 A:middle
Seek advice.

00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:28.206 A:middle
Your colleagues are smart.

00:14:28.716 --> 00:14:30.496 A:middle
And use your own voice.

00:14:30.806 --> 00:14:33.486 A:middle
It's the best one you have.

00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:35.376 A:middle
Respect your audience or they

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.706 A:middle
won't respect you.

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:39.416 A:middle
Make it relatable, otherwise

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:40.336 A:middle
they'll forget it.

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:44.496 A:middle
Engage in dialogue to keep them

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:47.566 A:middle
present and explain why.

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:48.926 A:middle
It's the million dollar

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:49.446 A:middle
question.

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:52.786 A:middle
Utilize storytelling because it

00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:53.506 A:middle
works.

00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:56.226 A:middle
And keep it simple even though

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:56.646 A:middle
it's not.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.196 A:middle
Good luck with your

00:14:58.196 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
presentations.

00:14:59.516 --> 00:15:07.690 A:middle
