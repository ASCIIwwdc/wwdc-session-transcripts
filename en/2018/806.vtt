[ Applause ]

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:25.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.066 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:28.956 A:middle
How's it going.

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:31.106 A:middle
It's nice to see everyone today.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.336 A:middle
Hopefully you've enjoyed the

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.256 A:middle
conference this week.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.896 A:middle
We're really happy to be here to

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:36.966 A:middle
start off the last day.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.386 A:middle
So, my name is Jon Dascola, and

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:40.356 A:middle
later I'll be joined by my

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:41.716 A:middle
colleague Heena Ko.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.366 A:middle
We're both designers on the

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.876 A:middle
human interface team here at

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:45.206 A:middle
Apple.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:46.696 A:middle
And we're going to talk about

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.076 A:middle
designing great notifications.

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:51.416 A:middle
So, this year in iOS 12, we

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:52.616 A:middle
introduced a lot of great

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.306 A:middle
feature to really enhance the

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:56.036 A:middle
notification experience, both

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
for you and everyone that uses

00:00:57.636 --> 00:00:58.136 A:middle
your apps.

00:00:58.496 --> 00:00:59.616 A:middle
And we think these features are

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.536 A:middle
really powerful, and could

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.536 A:middle
really powerful, and could

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.266 A:middle
create a meaningful, but also

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.086 A:middle
mindful experience for everyone.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:08.636 A:middle
But, before we get into what's

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:10.066 A:middle
new, I think it would be helpful

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.596 A:middle
to take a trip down memory lane

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.466 A:middle
and see how the notification

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.916 A:middle
experience has evolved over the

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:16.396 A:middle
years, because knowing how we

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.036 A:middle
got here will help us make a

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:18.686 A:middle
better future.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:21.586 A:middle
So, when iPhone launched, every

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.496 A:middle
alert was a blue box, model

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:23.776 A:middle
alert.

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:24.916 A:middle
Do you guys remember this?

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:26.866 A:middle
Every notification, every

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.646 A:middle
message, every invitation, it

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:30.076 A:middle
was an interruption that needed

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:31.676 A:middle
to be dealt with immediately.

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:33.306 A:middle
Nothing would be on the lock

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:35.416 A:middle
screen, so at times, it was

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:36.236 A:middle
pretty cumbersome when you'd

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:37.186 A:middle
unlock the phone, right?

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:38.706 A:middle
Whatever missed messages you

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.096 A:middle
received were backed up and

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:41.876 A:middle
would appear a single box at a

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:42.236 A:middle
time.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.656 A:middle
So, you could either ignore

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:45.806 A:middle
them, one at a time, or if you

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.146 A:middle
wanted to reply, you launched

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:48.306 A:middle
into the app to take action.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:52.036 A:middle
Then, in iOS 4, as more apps

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:53.306 A:middle
were sending push notifications,

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:54.746 A:middle
we started to queue them up on

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:55.426 A:middle
your lock screen.

00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:57.036 A:middle
So, now people could see all of

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:58.666 A:middle
their missed notifications at a

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.466 A:middle
glance and choose the specific

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.466 A:middle
glance and choose the specific

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.786 A:middle
one they wanted to interact

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
with.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.796 A:middle
A swipe on that row would launch

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:05.346 A:middle
into the app but all the other

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:06.586 A:middle
ones would be dismissed from the

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:07.126 A:middle
lock screen.

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
And they all went up to

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.056 A:middle
notification center.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:11.536 A:middle
And that was a way to access all

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:12.526 A:middle
the other things you had missed.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.646 A:middle
So, because so many

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:15.646 A:middle
notifications were being

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
accumulated, this became a

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.766 A:middle
really useful place to go and to

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.616 A:middle
see all the other activity on

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:22.676 A:middle
your phone.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.506 A:middle
Next, we introduced rich

00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:25.196 A:middle
notifications.

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:27.606 A:middle
As the quantity of notifications

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.536 A:middle
was increasing, we wanted to

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:30.666 A:middle
increase their quality.

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:32.786 A:middle
Rich notifications are a great

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.266 A:middle
way to provide more context and

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.806 A:middle
information around each

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:36.496 A:middle
notification.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:38.116 A:middle
That way you can see one,

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:39.996 A:middle
understand what it's for and get

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:41.176 A:middle
the extra information that you

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.526 A:middle
need to take action.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.116 A:middle
And it all happens right in

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:44.366 A:middle
line.

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
You don't need to launch into

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.226 A:middle
the app and lose the context of

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:47.826 A:middle
what you're doing.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.256 A:middle
And that leads us to where we

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:51.816 A:middle
are today and all the work that

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.836 A:middle
we've done to enhance the

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.786 A:middle
notification experience in iOS

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:55.036 A:middle
12.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.456 A:middle
So, we're going to talk about

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:58.266 A:middle
some features that make the

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.166 A:middle
world better for you, as app

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.166 A:middle
world better for you, as app

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:00.746 A:middle
developers.

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.346 A:middle
Ways to make your notifications

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:04.036 A:middle
more valuable, useful, and

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:04.606 A:middle
organized.

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:06.016 A:middle
And then, we'll talk about how

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.226 A:middle
those features can create a

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:08.656 A:middle
better experience for everyone.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.336 A:middle
But before we get going, can we

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:13.876 A:middle
take a moment and be candid?

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:15.596 A:middle
Can we talk about the current

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:16.866 A:middle
state of notifications?

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.856 A:middle
Maybe not always the greatest.

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:20.936 A:middle
You know, people are getting a

00:03:20.936 --> 00:03:21.826 A:middle
lot of interruptions.

00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:23.206 A:middle
And they're not always for the

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:24.266 A:middle
right reasons, right.

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:26.456 A:middle
And we have way more apps than

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.166 A:middle
ever before.

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:28.196 A:middle
And they're sending more

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:29.376 A:middle
notifications than ever.

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:31.906 A:middle
And because people are seeing so

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.446 A:middle
many notifications, it's so

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.766 A:middle
important to make sure that

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:35.936 A:middle
we're creating a really great

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:37.656 A:middle
experience for everybody that

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:38.326 A:middle
uses your app.

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.676 A:middle
Because the best notifications,

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:41.916 A:middle
they're for connecting and

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:43.146 A:middle
communicating with people.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:44.666 A:middle
I mean, that's what makes iPhone

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:46.306 A:middle
great, that real human

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:46.756 A:middle
connection.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.226 A:middle
And then, you know, we have

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:50.216 A:middle
social notifications.

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:51.676 A:middle
I totally understand how these

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:52.416 A:middle
are important, right?

00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:53.796 A:middle
People want to stay on top of

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:54.676 A:middle
their digital lives.

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.416 A:middle
Everyone likes their likes.

00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:58.346 A:middle
And then there's even the

00:03:58.346 --> 00:03:59.566 A:middle
occasional notification about

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
new sneakers or something, that

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
new sneakers or something, that

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
could be super fun and really

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
useful.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.576 A:middle
But not all of these things all

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.136 A:middle
of the time.

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.446 A:middle
Again, all things in moderation.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.836 A:middle
So, as more apps are continuing

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.576 A:middle
to send more notifications and

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.626 A:middle
taking more of our attention, we

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:14.496 A:middle
really have to make sure we're

00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:16.676 A:middle
doing the right thing.

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
We need to remember that the

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:18.935 A:middle
best notifications are for

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:20.716 A:middle
connecting people and delivering

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.156 A:middle
meaningful information.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:24.086 A:middle
Now, I know none of you here

00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:25.536 A:middle
would ever do any of this, but

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.146 A:middle
there are some app developers

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
that maybe go a little bit

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:29.076 A:middle
overboard.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.706 A:middle
And this year, we've created a

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:32.096 A:middle
UI that makes it easier for

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:33.006 A:middle
people to control how their

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
notifications are delivered.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.516 A:middle
And there's even an option to

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:38.436 A:middle
turn off all the notifications

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.326 A:middle
from an unhelpful app.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.766 A:middle
So, in iOS 12, when you receive

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:43.756 A:middle
a notification on the lock

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:46.486 A:middle
screen, you could swipe left and

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.146 A:middle
access some actions, and you'll

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:49.336 A:middle
notice this year, we've added a

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.066 A:middle
manage button.

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.726 A:middle
Tapping that brings in our newly

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.946 A:middle
designed quick tuning UI, which

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:56.366 A:middle
allows you to configure how the

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:57.996 A:middle
notifications from that app are

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:58.686 A:middle
being delivered.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
So, at the top, the first option

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
So, at the top, the first option

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:03.246 A:middle
is to deliver quietly.

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:05.066 A:middle
And these quiet notifications

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:06.976 A:middle
will be send directly into your

00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.406 A:middle
notification center without

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:08.926 A:middle
interruption.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:10.286 A:middle
It did not appear on the lock

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:10.696 A:middle
screen.

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.386 A:middle
It did not play a sound or

00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
haptic, or present as banners.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:15.666 A:middle
And I think this is a really

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
great option for an app that's

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:18.536 A:middle
sending you notifications that

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:19.056 A:middle
you want.

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:20.816 A:middle
Content that you're interested

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:22.376 A:middle
in, but you don't necessarily

00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
need to be interrupted by for

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.246 A:middle
every new post, right?

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.446 A:middle
So, you can access these

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:28.296 A:middle
notifications now on your own

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:28.736 A:middle
terms.

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.876 A:middle
But also, right here in the card

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:33.876 A:middle
is a button to turn off all

00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:35.236 A:middle
notifications from that

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:35.936 A:middle
particular app.

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
And we think having that

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
shortcut is really handy.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
But having to use it, it's not a

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:43.156 A:middle
great experience for anyone.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.646 A:middle
We don't want people to have to

00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:45.936 A:middle
turn off notifications because

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:47.436 A:middle
they're annoyed or frustrated.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.396 A:middle
And as developers you don't want

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:50.536 A:middle
to lose the privilege to reach

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.056 A:middle
out to those individuals, right?

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:53.676 A:middle
So, by the time we're done here,

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:54.476 A:middle
we want to make sure that you

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:55.406 A:middle
have all the tools and

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.936 A:middle
information you need to make

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:57.816 A:middle
sure you're sending only the

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.506 A:middle
most meaningful notifications

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
that you can.

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
that you can.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.406 A:middle
Because if you send great

00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
notifications, you'll be, making

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.016 A:middle
everyone who uses your app

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:05.376 A:middle
happy.

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
And if you've got happy people

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:08.616 A:middle
using your app, that's going to

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:09.396 A:middle
make you happy.

00:06:10.066 --> 00:06:11.396 A:middle
And if you guys are all happy

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:12.416 A:middle
and they're happy, that's going

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:13.666 A:middle
to make Heena and I real happy

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:14.026 A:middle
today.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:15.996 A:middle
And being happy is good, right?

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.836 A:middle
So, let's get into it and talk

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.116 A:middle
through the notification journey

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.216 A:middle
and how to create the best

00:06:21.216 --> 00:06:22.506 A:middle
notification experience.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.146 A:middle
We're going to start with the

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:25.336 A:middle
first run prompt, in that

00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:27.476 A:middle
initial agreement and talk about

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.616 A:middle
all the best ways for you to

00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:29.916 A:middle
make sure your notifications are

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:31.206 A:middle
allowed and delivered.

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.666 A:middle
Then we'll talk about the best

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
ways to provide value with all

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:36.116 A:middle
the notifications that you're

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:36.526 A:middle
sending.

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:39.016 A:middle
Better ways to organize your

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.526 A:middle
content with notification

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:40.926 A:middle
grouping.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:42.516 A:middle
And finally, how to make the

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:44.386 A:middle
most of rich notifications to

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
create a really useful and

00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
holistic notification

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:47.706 A:middle
experience.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.916 A:middle
So, let's get started and talk

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:51.226 A:middle
about that first prompt in

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:52.266 A:middle
asking for permission to send

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:52.896 A:middle
notifications.

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.006 A:middle
This is a familiar screen,

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:55.356 A:middle
right?

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:57.436 A:middle
It's your one and only

00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
opportunity to receive

00:06:58.736 --> 00:06:59.516 A:middle
permission to send

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:00.176 A:middle
notifications.

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:00.176 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.676 A:middle
And it's an important moment.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:03.236 A:middle
And you should remember that

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:04.276 A:middle
you're asking someone to make

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:05.626 A:middle
the difficult decision here.

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:07.076 A:middle
I mean put yourself in their

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:07.746 A:middle
shoes right.

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:08.926 A:middle
They just downloaded your app.

00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:10.316 A:middle
They're excited to give it a run

00:07:10.316 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
for the first time.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:11.896 A:middle
And then all of the sudden,

00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:12.446 A:middle
they're interrupted.

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:14.096 A:middle
And then they're asked make this

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.476 A:middle
decision about receiving

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.246 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:18.256 A:middle
How are they supposed to know,

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:18.526 A:middle
right?

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:20.016 A:middle
Especially if it's presented

00:07:20.016 --> 00:07:21.656 A:middle
without any context and you're

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:22.656 A:middle
not letting them know why

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.996 A:middle
notifications are valuable, and

00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:26.416 A:middle
if they've really had any time

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.676 A:middle
to experience your app.

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:28.856 A:middle
I mean why should they tap

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:29.286 A:middle
allow?

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.136 A:middle
So, this happens, right?

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:31.946 A:middle
They don't.

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:33.386 A:middle
And that was it.

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:35.586 A:middle
You had one shot, one

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.026 A:middle
opportunity to send

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:37.676 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:39.206 A:middle
And that was your only way to

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
ask for permission.

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.416 A:middle
Well, in iOS 12, that's no

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
longer the case.

00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:45.456 A:middle
We've created a new feature that

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:46.886 A:middle
allows you to send notifications

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.616 A:middle
directly and only into

00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:50.236 A:middle
notification center, without

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.506 A:middle
running that initial prompt.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:52.596 A:middle
It's your choice.

00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
You can continue to show the

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.866 A:middle
prompt and ask for the privilege

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:56.916 A:middle
to send notifications to the

00:07:56.916 --> 00:07:59.236 A:middle
lock screen with the risk of

00:07:59.236 --> 00:07:59.886 A:middle
being denied.

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:01.356 A:middle
Or, you can choose to deliver

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.126 A:middle
your notifications quietly and

00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:04.476 A:middle
directly in the notification

00:08:04.476 --> 00:08:04.746 A:middle
center.

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:06.976 A:middle
So, they'll appear like this in

00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:08.146 A:middle
your notification center list.

00:08:08.536 --> 00:08:09.366 A:middle
And if we look a little more

00:08:09.366 --> 00:08:11.046 A:middle
closely, you'll see the content

00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:12.316 A:middle
within the notification platter

00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:13.976 A:middle
is presented as it always is.

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:15.506 A:middle
Your information comes through

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:16.646 A:middle
as a normal notification.

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:19.336 A:middle
But at the bottom, we extend

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:20.616 A:middle
down the platter and we add some

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:21.026 A:middle
buttons.

00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:23.126 A:middle
Now the prompt is integrated

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.426 A:middle
within a notification.

00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:25.746 A:middle
It's less disruptive.

00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:27.236 A:middle
It's a non-model experience.

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:28.736 A:middle
So, you won't be stopped when

00:08:28.736 --> 00:08:29.716 A:middle
you're in the middle of using

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:31.276 A:middle
that app and being asked about

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:31.946 A:middle
notifications.

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:33.256 A:middle
You see the prompt right when

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:33.746 A:middle
you're looking at your

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:34.535 A:middle
notifications center.

00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:37.876 A:middle
And the prompt now provides more

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:38.535 A:middle
information.

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.596 A:middle
It's presented with in an actual

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:41.316 A:middle
notification.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:42.716 A:middle
So, I can see what sort of

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:43.986 A:middle
content the app will provide.

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:45.786 A:middle
And now, I'll have a better

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:47.116 A:middle
understanding of their purpose

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:48.876 A:middle
so I can better judge their

00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
quality, and be better informed

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:51.846 A:middle
to make that decision.

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:54.006 A:middle
So, let's look at some different

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:55.456 A:middle
categories of apps and talk

00:08:55.456 --> 00:08:56.466 A:middle
about how they might go about

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:57.406 A:middle
requesting permission.

00:08:58.016 --> 00:08:59.456 A:middle
So, we have social apps, news

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
apps, games.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
apps, games.

00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:02.856 A:middle
And let's focus on a news app

00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:03.416 A:middle
for a moment.

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:04.986 A:middle
Let's imagine we're creating a

00:09:04.986 --> 00:09:07.816 A:middle
new news service from scratch

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:08.526 A:middle
and we're working out our

00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:09.286 A:middle
notifications.

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:11.166 A:middle
Well, should we go to the

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:12.316 A:middle
directed notification center

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:12.426 A:middle
route?

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:13.916 A:middle
I mean that seems like a good

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:14.586 A:middle
idea, right?

00:09:14.906 --> 00:09:15.816 A:middle
I mean there's a group of people

00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:16.876 A:middle
out there that are interested in

00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:17.326 A:middle
news.

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.476 A:middle
Maybe they're curious about

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:19.526 A:middle
what's going on in the world.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:20.856 A:middle
But they don't feel the need to

00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:22.356 A:middle
be interrupted for every single

00:09:22.356 --> 00:09:23.396 A:middle
article that's posted.

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:24.646 A:middle
You know, especially if they've

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:25.676 A:middle
just downloaded the app and

00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:26.716 A:middle
they're unsure of the content

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:27.446 A:middle
they might receive.

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
I think the directed history

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:32.046 A:middle
route makes a lot of sense.

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.716 A:middle
But, you know I also see a very

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:35.186 A:middle
clear use case to ask for lock

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:36.426 A:middle
screen access too, right?

00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:37.936 A:middle
People love breaking news.

00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:39.116 A:middle
They want to be on top of what's

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:40.666 A:middle
going on in the world, as soon

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:41.616 A:middle
as it happens, right?

00:09:41.776 --> 00:09:44.746 A:middle
I get it. So, what do we do?

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:46.926 A:middle
Well, if we start with the new

00:09:46.926 --> 00:09:48.206 A:middle
world and talk about the cases

00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:49.526 A:middle
that could be sent directly to

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:50.446 A:middle
notification center.

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:53.536 A:middle
So, if your app is sending

00:09:53.536 --> 00:09:54.806 A:middle
content that can be consumed

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.706 A:middle
passively, and doesn't require

00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:58.386 A:middle
critical or timely responses,

00:09:58.626 --> 00:09:59.446 A:middle
then I think the directed

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.766 A:middle
notification center route is

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.766 A:middle
notification center route is

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.656 A:middle
your best approach.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.116 A:middle
It ensures that your content is

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:03.676 A:middle
delivered.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:04.856 A:middle
It won't interrupt people.

00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:06.686 A:middle
And most importantly, it gives

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:08.346 A:middle
them an opportunity to see your

00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:09.556 A:middle
content and try your

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:10.916 A:middle
notifications before they have

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:11.656 A:middle
to commit to it.

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:13.796 A:middle
So, if our news app is sending

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
longform articles, I think that

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.416 A:middle
makes sense, right?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:17.666 A:middle
Or, social apps.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:18.766 A:middle
I think they can deliver their

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.826 A:middle
likes and comments quietly.

00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:22.456 A:middle
Games that are sending out

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:23.636 A:middle
promotional notification.

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.766 A:middle
Examples like that, I think they

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.246 A:middle
make sense to go direct to

00:10:27.246 --> 00:10:28.036 A:middle
notification center.

00:10:28.036 --> 00:10:31.156 A:middle
Now let's take a moment and talk

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
about the traditional route.

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.056 A:middle
What sort of use cases make

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:34.586 A:middle
sense here?

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.366 A:middle
Well, if your apps need to

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:37.996 A:middle
deliver notification content

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:39.846 A:middle
immediately, if people need to

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:40.996 A:middle
see your notifications the

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:42.436 A:middle
moment that they're posted.

00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:44.486 A:middle
Or your app requires an urgent

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.566 A:middle
response to notifications, ask

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:47.226 A:middle
for permission.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.716 A:middle
You know, maybe that news app is

00:10:49.906 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
breaking news.

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.796 A:middle
Or your social app has a big

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
messaging component, or games

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:55.426 A:middle
where you need to see your

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:56.196 A:middle
friends online.

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.586 A:middle
If you've got an app like that,

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.306 A:middle
then go for it.

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
I think that makes a ton of

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
I think that makes a ton of

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:01.656 A:middle
sense to ask for lock screen

00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:02.156 A:middle
access.

00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:03.716 A:middle
But if you do, there's a few

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:05.016 A:middle
things to keep in mind while

00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:05.736 A:middle
you're designing that

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:06.436 A:middle
experience.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:08.626 A:middle
Because if you do create a great

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.016 A:middle
experience here, I think it will

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:11.866 A:middle
greatly increase the probability

00:11:11.866 --> 00:11:13.156 A:middle
that your notifications are

00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:15.676 A:middle
going to be allowed.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.646 A:middle
So, don't prompt or send this

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.096 A:middle
alert as soon as people launch

00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:20.186 A:middle
your app for the first time.

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.426 A:middle
You know, give them a moment to

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:22.786 A:middle
experience your app, what you've

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:23.716 A:middle
built and what you have to

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:24.156 A:middle
offer.

00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:26.706 A:middle
And find a place within your app

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:27.556 A:middle
to explain why your

00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:28.556 A:middle
notifications are going to be

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:29.136 A:middle
valuable.

00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:30.376 A:middle
Let them know why you're sending

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:31.176 A:middle
notifications.

00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:32.786 A:middle
And more importantly, why they

00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:33.996 A:middle
need to appear on the lock

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:34.366 A:middle
screen.

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:37.906 A:middle
And finally, that prompt, well

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.116 A:middle
post it at the right time.

00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:40.486 A:middle
Present it when someone

00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:42.756 A:middle
understands the reason why

00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:43.336 A:middle
they'll be receiving

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:44.406 A:middle
notifications from your app.

00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:45.516 A:middle
Like if you're a delivery

00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:47.166 A:middle
service, wait for someone to

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:48.936 A:middle
complete their order and explain

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:50.246 A:middle
the notifications will update

00:11:50.246 --> 00:11:51.406 A:middle
them on its progress.

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:52.876 A:middle
Or if you're a travel app,

00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:54.736 A:middle
notifications will be for flight

00:11:54.736 --> 00:11:56.496 A:middle
delays and gate changes, right.

00:11:58.316 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
Because in either scenario, with

00:11:58.316 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
Because in either scenario, with

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.026 A:middle
the direct to notification

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.086 A:middle
center route or this one we want

00:12:04.086 --> 00:12:05.666 A:middle
you to have the best opportunity

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.086 A:middle
to deliver your notifications.

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.766 A:middle
So, that's what's new when

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.916 A:middle
asking for permission to send

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:11.686 A:middle
out notifications.

00:12:12.026 --> 00:12:13.046 A:middle
Remember, it's up to you.

00:12:13.486 --> 00:12:14.976 A:middle
Both approaches are valuable and

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:16.086 A:middle
both should be considered.

00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:17.296 A:middle
It's a decision that you're

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:19.026 A:middle
going to need based on your app

00:12:19.526 --> 00:12:20.856 A:middle
and your app's particular

00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:21.316 A:middle
content.

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.586 A:middle
So, now that you've taken all

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.136 A:middle
the right steps to make sure

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
people will be receiving your

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:28.016 A:middle
notifications.

00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:29.476 A:middle
Let's talk about how to make

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:30.536 A:middle
sure you're setting the best

00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:32.456 A:middle
content in making notifications

00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:34.476 A:middle
like extremely valuable for

00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:34.926 A:middle
everyone.

00:12:36.216 --> 00:12:37.636 A:middle
And why is it so important that

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:38.446 A:middle
we're sending out great

00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:39.246 A:middle
notifications?

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:41.436 A:middle
It's because our attention is

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:42.066 A:middle
valuable.

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:45.156 A:middle
Our attention is precious.

00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:47.036 A:middle
Right? Interrupting people, it's

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:48.146 A:middle
a real privilege.

00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:49.836 A:middle
And we need to respect that.

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.456 A:middle
I mean you've all felt this

00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:51.716 A:middle
right?

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:52.986 A:middle
You're trying to focus on

00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:54.716 A:middle
something, you're in the zone.

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:56.006 A:middle
I mean maybe it's happened this

00:12:56.006 --> 00:12:56.996 A:middle
week, you're updating all your

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.116 A:middle
apps to adopt these great new

00:12:58.116 --> 00:12:59.456 A:middle
APIs and then all the sudden

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:01.036 A:middle
[ding].

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:01.036 A:middle
[ding].

00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:01.736 A:middle
You're interrupted.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.126 A:middle
And you stop.

00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:04.416 A:middle
And you lose focus.

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.246 A:middle
And when the wrong thing comes

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.366 A:middle
at the wrong time it's

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:07.946 A:middle
frustrating.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
So, you've got to be extra

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.736 A:middle
considerate when we're sending

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:11.426 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
First off, we need to make sure

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:17.206 A:middle
we're sending great content and

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.686 A:middle
providing the highest quality of

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:19.196 A:middle
information.

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:20.216 A:middle
Everything you said in a

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.696 A:middle
notification has got to be

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:22.216 A:middle
meaningful.

00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:23.946 A:middle
Every notification should

00:13:23.946 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
provide a specific purpose.

00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:26.726 A:middle
Each notification should have a

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:28.426 A:middle
specific message to communicate

00:13:28.426 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
or a task to complete.

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
Notifications are not just a

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.696 A:middle
reason to get people to launch

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
into your app.

00:13:34.916 --> 00:13:36.256 A:middle
So, Dark Sky, it's a really

00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:37.666 A:middle
lovely weather app that sends

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:38.626 A:middle
particularly meaningful

00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:39.356 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:41.826 A:middle
See, I think the interesting

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:43.786 A:middle
thing about the weather is you

00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:45.756 A:middle
really need to know about the

00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:47.346 A:middle
weather once it's different.

00:13:47.436 --> 00:13:48.516 A:middle
You know, if there's a change in

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:49.136 A:middle
conditions.

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:50.916 A:middle
And that's when Dark Sky sends

00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:51.946 A:middle
these notifications, right?

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:52.986 A:middle
Rain is starting soon.

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:54.056 A:middle
That's what I need to know.

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:54.986 A:middle
Just really smart.

00:13:56.316 --> 00:13:57.996 A:middle
Door Dash is another great

00:13:57.996 --> 00:13:58.436 A:middle
example.

00:13:59.016 --> 00:14:01.566 A:middle
You get your notification when

00:13:59.016 --> 00:14:01.566 A:middle
You get your notification when

00:14:01.566 --> 00:14:02.236 A:middle
your food arrives.

00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:03.816 A:middle
I mean everybody gets excited

00:14:03.816 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
when their dinner is here, like

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:05.566 A:middle
what more do you need to know?

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:06.236 A:middle
It's perfect.

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:08.736 A:middle
And HQ does the right thing with

00:14:08.736 --> 00:14:09.576 A:middle
their notifications.

00:14:10.846 --> 00:14:12.926 A:middle
For a live game that requires

00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:14.446 A:middle
you to be online at a specific

00:14:14.446 --> 00:14:16.186 A:middle
time, a notification like this,

00:14:16.376 --> 00:14:19.356 A:middle
it makes a ton of sense.

00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
So, what do they all have in

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:20.726 A:middle
common?

00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:22.296 A:middle
Well, all those notifications,

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:24.026 A:middle
they served a clear purpose.

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:25.386 A:middle
They were presented for a

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.336 A:middle
specific reason with real

00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:28.006 A:middle
information.

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:29.366 A:middle
They weren't just empty

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:30.816 A:middle
invitations to launch into your

00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:31.026 A:middle
app.

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:34.806 A:middle
So, now that you're sending out

00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:35.986 A:middle
really great content.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.616 A:middle
It's important to consider when

00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:38.846 A:middle
you're sending that content.

00:14:39.256 --> 00:14:40.516 A:middle
So, be considerate when you

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:41.826 A:middle
deliver notifications.

00:14:42.676 --> 00:14:43.626 A:middle
And reminders is great.

00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:45.136 A:middle
You can choose whether you want

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:45.926 A:middle
your notification to be

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.866 A:middle
delivered by time, or by

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:48.446 A:middle
location.

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:49.916 A:middle
So, you get the appropriate

00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:52.106 A:middle
content whenever you need it.

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:54.216 A:middle
And Headspace is great, they're

00:14:54.216 --> 00:14:55.166 A:middle
one of my favorite apps.

00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.606 A:middle
It's a meditation app that

00:14:56.606 --> 00:14:58.146 A:middle
really helps with focus and

00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:58.576 A:middle
clarity.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.296 A:middle
So, I think it's appropriate

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.296 A:middle
So, I think it's appropriate

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.026 A:middle
that they let me choose when a

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:02.916 A:middle
reminder comes through.

00:15:03.156 --> 00:15:03.956 A:middle
Because it would be terribly

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.766 A:middle
ironic if they were the ones

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
sending me frustrating

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.586 A:middle
notifications at inopportune

00:15:08.586 --> 00:15:09.556 A:middle
times throughout the day.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.046 A:middle
Headspace is really great.

00:15:12.276 --> 00:15:13.486 A:middle
And here, I love this screen

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:14.326 A:middle
with CNN, right.

00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:16.516 A:middle
After you allow alerts, they ask

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.536 A:middle
you to choose the alert

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:18.226 A:middle
frequency.

00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:20.006 A:middle
So, it's up to me to decide how

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.336 A:middle
often I would like to receive

00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:21.996 A:middle
their content.

00:15:22.246 --> 00:15:23.656 A:middle
It's such as smart way to manage

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.026 A:middle
and configure your notifications

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:25.276 A:middle
you know.

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:26.856 A:middle
Because as a user, now I have

00:15:26.856 --> 00:15:28.276 A:middle
some expectations around what

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:29.576 A:middle
that notification experience

00:15:29.576 --> 00:15:29.916 A:middle
will be.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:32.746 A:middle
And here's a notifications from

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:33.326 A:middle
Duolingo.

00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:36.436 A:middle
So, I was trying to learn a new

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:36.926 A:middle
language.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:38.646 A:middle
I got a bit distracted here

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.986 A:middle
working on this presentation, so

00:15:39.986 --> 00:15:40.936 A:middle
I missed a few sessions.

00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:42.766 A:middle
And rather than continuing to

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.186 A:middle
send me notifications that I'm

00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:45.826 A:middle
not interacting with, they

00:15:45.826 --> 00:15:46.716 A:middle
decided to pause them.

00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:49.216 A:middle
And I just think that's really

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:49.816 A:middle
considerate.

00:15:50.236 --> 00:15:51.326 A:middle
Because I could totally

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.546 A:middle
understand the argument right,

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.776 A:middle
why they might want to send me

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:55.586 A:middle
more notifications at a time

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:56.936 A:middle
like this and really encourage

00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:58.416 A:middle
me to get back and re-engage

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:58.976 A:middle
with the app.

00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
But with the new tuning features

00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
But with the new tuning features

00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:02.366 A:middle
we announced, if I get annoyed

00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
by those notifications, I can

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:05.666 A:middle
easily turn them all off.

00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:07.936 A:middle
So, for them, doing the right

00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:09.846 A:middle
thing in the short term, while

00:16:09.846 --> 00:16:11.046 A:middle
it might seem like the harder

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:12.686 A:middle
decision to make, I think it's

00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:13.676 A:middle
going to pay off in the long

00:16:13.676 --> 00:16:13.896 A:middle
run.

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:16.586 A:middle
So, in all cases, it's really

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
important to consider how and

00:16:18.536 --> 00:16:19.656 A:middle
when you're delivering

00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:20.506 A:middle
notifications.

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:23.746 A:middle
And finally, we want to make

00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:25.116 A:middle
sure your people are in control

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.186 A:middle
of the content that they're

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:26.726 A:middle
receiving.

00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:28.136 A:middle
I mean there's a real trust

00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:29.376 A:middle
relationship that's created when

00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:30.546 A:middle
someone allows notifications

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:31.106 A:middle
from your app.

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:33.186 A:middle
They're making space for you to

00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:33.986 A:middle
interrupt them with your

00:16:33.986 --> 00:16:34.856 A:middle
content, right?

00:16:35.296 --> 00:16:36.356 A:middle
And as we've discussed, it

00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:37.856 A:middle
should be really valuable.

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.446 A:middle
But not all things have that

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.716 A:middle
same level of value or

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:43.606 A:middle
importance to all people.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.396 A:middle
So, let's talk about giving

00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:46.706 A:middle
everyone control on how their

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:48.086 A:middle
content is delivered, right?

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:49.486 A:middle
So, we've redesigned settings

00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:50.786 A:middle
this year to more clearly

00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:52.676 A:middle
visualize the different delivery

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:53.856 A:middle
methods of notifications.

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:55.736 A:middle
We hope that with more clear and

00:16:55.736 --> 00:16:57.876 A:middle
graphic UI, it will make it

00:16:57.876 --> 00:16:59.306 A:middle
easier for people to adjust how

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
they're receiving your different

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
they're receiving your different

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:00.886 A:middle
notifications.

00:17:01.806 --> 00:17:02.966 A:middle
And if you notice at the bottom

00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:04.826 A:middle
here, we've also added a link to

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:06.425 A:middle
your third-party custom

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
notification settings.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.366 A:middle
And providing that link is even

00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:12.086 A:middle
more important now because of

00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:13.205 A:middle
our new tuning UI.

00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:14.846 A:middle
Because if someone decides to

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:17.146 A:middle
tap turn off, we don't just

00:17:17.146 --> 00:17:18.496 A:middle
immediately stop all the

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.886 A:middle
notifications from that app, but

00:17:19.886 --> 00:17:21.356 A:middle
we present a confirmation step.

00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:23.356 A:middle
So, in this action sheet, you

00:17:23.356 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
could choose to turn off all

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.596 A:middle
notifications from the

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:28.106 A:middle
particular app, or tap a button,

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.316 A:middle
to go into that app's particular

00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:31.726 A:middle
custom notification settings.

00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:33.376 A:middle
And again, we want people to be

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:34.856 A:middle
in control of the types of

00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:36.116 A:middle
content that they receive.

00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:37.816 A:middle
So, while we hope that turn off

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:39.196 A:middle
everything button is a last

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:40.926 A:middle
resort, we want to encourage

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.376 A:middle
people to get into your app

00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:44.276 A:middle
settings and customize the

00:17:44.276 --> 00:17:45.936 A:middle
notification categories you have

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:47.016 A:middle
in a more granular way.

00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:49.176 A:middle
So, with this extra visibility

00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:51.076 A:middle
you know it's really important

00:17:51.076 --> 00:17:51.976 A:middle
to make sure these settings

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:52.966 A:middle
pages are well-designed.

00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:54.296 A:middle
So, let's look at a few

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:54.686 A:middle
examples.

00:17:55.966 --> 00:17:58.066 A:middle
ESPN is an app with really

00:17:58.066 --> 00:17:58.836 A:middle
detailed settings.

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.246 A:middle
And they've done a great job

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.246 A:middle
And they've done a great job

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:00.936 A:middle
with their design.

00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:02.096 A:middle
There's like a great sense of

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:03.396 A:middle
hierarchy and all of their

00:18:03.526 --> 00:18:05.486 A:middle
content is tailored to my

00:18:05.486 --> 00:18:05.936 A:middle
interests.

00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:07.726 A:middle
And when I drill down and see

00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:09.456 A:middle
the screen, they have specific

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:10.926 A:middle
details for each type of

00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:11.916 A:middle
notification that you can

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:12.346 A:middle
receive.

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:13.686 A:middle
You know, basketball is

00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:14.586 A:middle
different than baseball.

00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:15.876 A:middle
Right. I have all the controls

00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:17.736 A:middle
that I need to receive exactly

00:18:17.736 --> 00:18:19.216 A:middle
the right notifications from

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:19.736 A:middle
ESPN.

00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:22.916 A:middle
And "The New York Times" app is

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:23.276 A:middle
great.

00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:24.876 A:middle
I have the options to configure

00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:26.106 A:middle
the different categories or

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.066 A:middle
different sections that are

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:27.606 A:middle
alerting me.

00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:30.626 A:middle
You know I might not find sports

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:32.196 A:middle
or politics helpful, but I can

00:18:32.196 --> 00:18:33.736 A:middle
still receive breaking news and

00:18:33.736 --> 00:18:34.536 A:middle
top stories.

00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:35.976 A:middle
And I think this is really smart

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:36.966 A:middle
for "The New York Times" to have

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:37.396 A:middle
implemented.

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:38.666 A:middle
Because not everyone may

00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:40.596 A:middle
appreciate interruptions every

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:42.106 A:middle
single category that they offer.

00:18:42.886 --> 00:18:43.976 A:middle
So, for allowing this topic

00:18:43.976 --> 00:18:45.876 A:middle
level control, it assures people

00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:47.706 A:middle
to configure the experience to

00:18:47.706 --> 00:18:49.346 A:middle
their liking without resorting

00:18:49.346 --> 00:18:51.376 A:middle
to turning off all notifications

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:52.336 A:middle
from that app.

00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:54.896 A:middle
So, it's really important, this

00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:56.136 A:middle
set of control is supported in

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.746 A:middle
your app in a well-designed way.

00:18:57.746 --> 00:18:58.526 A:middle
All right.

00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:01.216 A:middle
So, those are the important

00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:01.216 A:middle
So, those are the important

00:19:01.216 --> 00:19:02.376 A:middle
things to remember when creating

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:03.096 A:middle
notifications.

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:04.166 A:middle
Now, you're going to be sending

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:05.196 A:middle
out some really valuable

00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:05.876 A:middle
information.

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:08.596 A:middle
The next thing is to talk about

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:09.716 A:middle
notification grouping.

00:19:10.046 --> 00:19:11.426 A:middle
And this is a new feature in iOS

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:12.926 A:middle
12 to help everyone keep their

00:19:12.926 --> 00:19:14.486 A:middle
notifications, you know all

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.436 A:middle
those great, and valuable

00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:17.096 A:middle
content you'll be receiving,

00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:18.516 A:middle
more organized.

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:21.176 A:middle
So, in iOS, we've always

00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:22.726 A:middle
appreciated the convenience of

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:24.036 A:middle
seeing notifications on the lock

00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:24.356 A:middle
screen.

00:19:25.536 --> 00:19:26.826 A:middle
The chronological list is really

00:19:26.826 --> 00:19:27.766 A:middle
helpful to organize.

00:19:29.816 --> 00:19:30.936 A:middle
And it's great to see the

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.616 A:middle
content of notifications without

00:19:32.616 --> 00:19:33.446 A:middle
having to interact with the

00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:34.096 A:middle
device.

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:36.266 A:middle
You just pick up the phone and

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:37.596 A:middle
everything is there, it's all

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:37.966 A:middle
visible.

00:19:39.366 --> 00:19:40.656 A:middle
But you know, there gets to be a

00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:41.606 A:middle
point where that long

00:19:41.606 --> 00:19:43.326 A:middle
chronological list starts to

00:19:43.326 --> 00:19:43.956 A:middle
break down.

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:45.296 A:middle
Whenever there's a lot of

00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:46.416 A:middle
different content coming on the

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:47.106 A:middle
screen, right?

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.496 A:middle
Especially multiple messages, or

00:19:48.496 --> 00:19:49.276 A:middle
if you have group chats

00:19:49.276 --> 00:19:50.526 A:middle
happening all at the same time,

00:19:50.696 --> 00:19:51.756 A:middle
it's really difficult to follow.

00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:53.216 A:middle
So, that's when we decided to

00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:54.586 A:middle
start grouping notifications.

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:56.946 A:middle
Now, all your related content is

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:57.796 A:middle
organized together.

00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:01.016 A:middle
A simple tap on each group

00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:01.016 A:middle
A simple tap on each group

00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:02.496 A:middle
expands it open and you can

00:20:02.496 --> 00:20:04.206 A:middle
interact with each notification

00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:04.956 A:middle
individually.

00:20:05.386 --> 00:20:07.196 A:middle
And by default, notifications

00:20:07.196 --> 00:20:08.646 A:middle
will group together by app.

00:20:09.246 --> 00:20:11.226 A:middle
And for most cases, that make

00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:11.796 A:middle
sense.

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:13.716 A:middle
But you know there's some

00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:14.946 A:middle
circumstances when sorting them

00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.736 A:middle
out in a more detailed way can

00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:17.286 A:middle
be helpful.

00:20:17.376 --> 00:20:19.236 A:middle
And messages is a perfect

00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:19.686 A:middle
example.

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:21.136 A:middle
I don't think it would be the

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:22.646 A:middle
most useful thing to see every

00:20:22.646 --> 00:20:23.916 A:middle
missed message from every

00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:25.376 A:middle
conversation thread and group

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:26.786 A:middle
chat you're having all lumped

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.176 A:middle
together into a single group.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.356 A:middle
So, to more clearly organize

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:32.136 A:middle
everything we create a new group

00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:33.486 A:middle
for each conversation.

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:34.836 A:middle
And we call each individual

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:35.866 A:middle
group a thread.

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.696 A:middle
So, let's take a moment and talk

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.556 A:middle
about notification threads and

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:41.896 A:middle
what the best ways may be to

00:20:41.896 --> 00:20:42.886 A:middle
organize your content.

00:20:43.336 --> 00:20:44.686 A:middle
So, notification grouping uses

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:46.276 A:middle
the existing thread identifier

00:20:46.276 --> 00:20:46.636 A:middle
API.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.016 A:middle
This API was introduced as part

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.326 A:middle
of the notification content

00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:50.956 A:middle
extensions.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:53.366 A:middle
We expanded its use to create

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:54.326 A:middle
notification groups.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
The thread identifier can be any

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.256 A:middle
string that you want and the

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.626 A:middle
notifications with the same

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
thread identifier are all

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
thread identifier are all

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:01.826 A:middle
grouped together.

00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:02.756 A:middle
That's it.

00:21:03.016 --> 00:21:03.646 A:middle
Super simple.

00:21:06.456 --> 00:21:07.556 A:middle
So, threads make a lot of sense

00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:08.256 A:middle
and you have separate

00:21:08.256 --> 00:21:09.756 A:middle
conversations to group together.

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:11.096 A:middle
But what about other types of

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:11.646 A:middle
content?

00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:12.936 A:middle
How should we handle grouping in

00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
those cases?

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:14.946 A:middle
Well, let's look at news.

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:16.636 A:middle
Each source is broken out into a

00:21:16.636 --> 00:21:17.346 A:middle
separate thread.

00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:19.426 A:middle
You can see there's a group from

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:20.406 A:middle
"The New York Times."

00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:23.946 A:middle
A group for Quartz, and a group

00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:25.026 A:middle
from "The Washington Post."

00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:27.746 A:middle
And it's a really helpful way to

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:29.596 A:middle
find and organize content

00:21:29.596 --> 00:21:32.196 A:middle
delivered from the news app.

00:21:32.386 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
And let's look at another

00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:33.976 A:middle
example.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.946 A:middle
Podcasts. They really do the

00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:36.716 A:middle
smart thing with their

00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:37.526 A:middle
notifications.

00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:39.946 A:middle
They create a special thread

00:21:39.946 --> 00:21:41.376 A:middle
that groups together all of your

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:42.486 A:middle
new episodes.

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:44.076 A:middle
And what they do is they

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:45.616 A:middle
resisted the temptation to

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.876 A:middle
declare each individual Podcast

00:21:48.226 --> 00:21:48.936 A:middle
a separate thread.

00:21:49.846 --> 00:21:51.076 A:middle
Because remember, threading is

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.186 A:middle
about consolidating and

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.406 A:middle
organizing your content.

00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:54.776 A:middle
So, when scrolling through your

00:21:54.776 --> 00:21:56.046 A:middle
notification history, I think

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:57.596 A:middle
it's a much better experience to

00:21:57.596 --> 00:21:59.976 A:middle
see all new Podcast episodes in

00:21:59.976 --> 00:22:01.776 A:middle
a single group, rather than a

00:21:59.976 --> 00:22:01.776 A:middle
a single group, rather than a

00:22:01.776 --> 00:22:03.056 A:middle
bunch of discrete groups

00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.146 A:middle
separated out and mixed together

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:06.606 A:middle
amongst all of your other missed

00:22:06.606 --> 00:22:07.326 A:middle
notifications.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:08.796 A:middle
Because, if there's a single

00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:10.716 A:middle
group, a tap will expand it open

00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:12.386 A:middle
and reveal all of the related

00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:12.956 A:middle
content.

00:22:13.696 --> 00:22:14.776 A:middle
Everything is together.

00:22:15.526 --> 00:22:16.646 A:middle
Everything is organized.

00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:20.406 A:middle
And everything is easy to find.

00:22:20.496 --> 00:22:21.456 A:middle
So, while threads can be

00:22:21.456 --> 00:22:23.046 A:middle
incredibly valuable, it's really

00:22:23.046 --> 00:22:24.516 A:middle
important to not create too

00:22:24.516 --> 00:22:24.906 A:middle
many.

00:22:25.736 --> 00:22:26.696 A:middle
They should be used to highlight

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:27.976 A:middle
and distinguish meaningfully

00:22:27.976 --> 00:22:29.596 A:middle
different types of content.

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:31.326 A:middle
So, remember it's okay to leave

00:22:31.326 --> 00:22:32.716 A:middle
the default behavior of grouping

00:22:32.716 --> 00:22:33.826 A:middle
all of your apps notifications

00:22:33.826 --> 00:22:34.136 A:middle
together.

00:22:34.426 --> 00:22:35.306 A:middle
Often that's going to be the

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:36.406 A:middle
best experience for people to

00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:38.066 A:middle
find and interact with your

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:38.446 A:middle
content.

00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:41.146 A:middle
All right, so that's

00:22:41.146 --> 00:22:42.646 A:middle
notification grouping, and I

00:22:42.646 --> 00:22:43.506 A:middle
think we're doing pretty good so

00:22:43.506 --> 00:22:43.836 A:middle
far.

00:22:44.036 --> 00:22:45.006 A:middle
You know, people have agreed to

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:46.356 A:middle
receive your notifications now.

00:22:47.046 --> 00:22:47.736 A:middle
You're respecting their

00:22:47.736 --> 00:22:48.326 A:middle
attention.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.746 A:middle
You're sending good content at

00:22:49.746 --> 00:22:50.716 A:middle
relevant times.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:52.206 A:middle
If it makes sense for your app,

00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:53.136 A:middle
you're grouping your content

00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.546 A:middle
together by a few relevant

00:22:54.546 --> 00:22:55.026 A:middle
threads.

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:56.176 A:middle
We're moving.

00:22:56.726 --> 00:22:57.646 A:middle
Now, we need to make sure the

00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.076 A:middle
rich notifications are rounding

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:00.476 A:middle
out the experience.

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:00.476 A:middle
out the experience.

00:23:01.716 --> 00:23:03.336 A:middle
And it's just so important, it's

00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:04.566 A:middle
really important to create

00:23:04.566 --> 00:23:06.016 A:middle
useful rich notifications.

00:23:06.296 --> 00:23:07.466 A:middle
Because as I mentioned earlier,

00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:08.806 A:middle
rich notifications are a way to

00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:10.576 A:middle
provide more context and

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.236 A:middle
information to each

00:23:12.236 --> 00:23:12.976 A:middle
notification.

00:23:14.006 --> 00:23:14.916 A:middle
Now, we want people to take

00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:16.706 A:middle
action on them, without losing

00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:17.916 A:middle
the context of what they're

00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:18.386 A:middle
doing.

00:23:19.756 --> 00:23:21.096 A:middle
I say, like every notification

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:22.286 A:middle
should be like a little

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:23.516 A:middle
self-contained package of

00:23:23.516 --> 00:23:25.416 A:middle
information to allow me to

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.846 A:middle
complete a specific task.

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:28.256 A:middle
I shouldn't have to launch into

00:23:28.256 --> 00:23:30.106 A:middle
the app to find value in a

00:23:30.106 --> 00:23:30.806 A:middle
notification.

00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:32.366 A:middle
And photos is a great example.

00:23:32.366 --> 00:23:33.726 A:middle
I can see that my friend added a

00:23:33.726 --> 00:23:35.126 A:middle
new image to a shared photo

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:35.526 A:middle
stream.

00:23:36.686 --> 00:23:37.966 A:middle
And with 3D touch, when I touch

00:23:37.966 --> 00:23:39.326 A:middle
on it, I can see the big,

00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:41.616 A:middle
full-sized version of the image

00:23:41.616 --> 00:23:42.486 A:middle
that was added.

00:23:42.676 --> 00:23:44.036 A:middle
And below there's a description.

00:23:44.036 --> 00:23:45.556 A:middle
And with the quick action

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:46.956 A:middle
buttons, I can either like it,

00:23:47.046 --> 00:23:48.586 A:middle
or leave a comment right in

00:23:48.586 --> 00:23:48.886 A:middle
line.

00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:50.186 A:middle
I don't need to leave the

00:23:50.186 --> 00:23:51.486 A:middle
context of what I'm currently

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:53.056 A:middle
doing to take action on the

00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:53.746 A:middle
notification.

00:23:53.996 --> 00:23:54.736 A:middle
I tap like.

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:56.646 A:middle
I swipe it away and I'm back to

00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:57.226 A:middle
the lock screen.

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.226 A:middle
Calendar is another great

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.226 A:middle
Calendar is another great

00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:00.636 A:middle
example.

00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:02.316 A:middle
I see I have an invitation to an

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:03.346 A:middle
event on my lock screen.

00:24:03.636 --> 00:24:05.306 A:middle
And I use 3D touch and press on

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:07.836 A:middle
it, I see my availability right

00:24:07.836 --> 00:24:08.676 A:middle
in the notification.

00:24:09.376 --> 00:24:10.466 A:middle
Again, I don't need to launch

00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:12.156 A:middle
into Calendar to see my day.

00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:13.616 A:middle
And then there's some great

00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:14.716 A:middle
quick options below.

00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:15.946 A:middle
I can accept the invitation

00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:16.816 A:middle
right in line.

00:24:17.386 --> 00:24:19.986 A:middle
So, if we look at messages, with

00:24:19.986 --> 00:24:21.136 A:middle
our new notification grouping

00:24:21.136 --> 00:24:22.916 A:middle
UI, my conversation with Heena

00:24:23.006 --> 00:24:24.166 A:middle
is all grouped together.

00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:26.306 A:middle
Now, when I press on the

00:24:26.306 --> 00:24:27.886 A:middle
notification group, I'm seeing

00:24:27.936 --> 00:24:29.756 A:middle
all of that group's content

00:24:29.796 --> 00:24:30.306 A:middle
together.

00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:32.896 A:middle
All of the individual platters

00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:33.926 A:middle
that were stacked in the group

00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:35.656 A:middle
are consolidated together in

00:24:35.656 --> 00:24:36.196 A:middle
this view.

00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:37.756 A:middle
I can read the entire thread

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:38.206 A:middle
right here.

00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:41.376 A:middle
And now, in iOS 12, we've added

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:42.796 A:middle
interactivity to the rich

00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:43.786 A:middle
notification views.

00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:46.366 A:middle
So, you can double tap on a

00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:48.316 A:middle
specific messages bubble and

00:24:48.316 --> 00:24:49.796 A:middle
access our tap back UI.

00:24:50.746 --> 00:24:52.196 A:middle
So, I tap like, and I can send

00:24:52.196 --> 00:24:53.526 A:middle
that acknowledgment right back

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:53.886 A:middle
to Heena.

00:24:56.336 --> 00:24:57.646 A:middle
So, as we mentioned, if you've

00:24:57.646 --> 00:24:59.066 A:middle
created individual threads for

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
your content, you can also have

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
your content, you can also have

00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:02.516 A:middle
a threaded or consolidated rich

00:25:02.516 --> 00:25:03.206 A:middle
notification.

00:25:03.796 --> 00:25:04.906 A:middle
So, if we look at Podcasts.

00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:06.566 A:middle
All of their new episodes are

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:07.996 A:middle
grouped together here on the

00:25:07.996 --> 00:25:08.546 A:middle
lock screen.

00:25:09.326 --> 00:25:10.646 A:middle
When I press on that stack, I

00:25:10.646 --> 00:25:12.186 A:middle
get a single rich notification

00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:13.756 A:middle
that summarizes each of the new

00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:15.426 A:middle
Podcast episodes that have been

00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:15.846 A:middle
released.

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:17.856 A:middle
There's a custom design with

00:25:17.856 --> 00:25:18.806 A:middle
each show's artwork.

00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:21.376 A:middle
The episode title and a short

00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:21.906 A:middle
description.

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:23.786 A:middle
And because we can have discrete

00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:25.416 A:middle
tap regions, there are separate

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:27.086 A:middle
play buttons for each episode.

00:25:27.636 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
I mean, I just think this

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
example is great.

00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:30.756 A:middle
It checks all the boxes for

00:25:30.756 --> 00:25:32.196 A:middle
making a great rich

00:25:32.306 --> 00:25:32.976 A:middle
notification.

00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:35.086 A:middle
There's detailed content, nice

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.526 A:middle
images, custom controls, and

00:25:37.526 --> 00:25:38.376 A:middle
rich interactions.

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:41.146 A:middle
It's a great way to finish the

00:25:41.146 --> 00:25:42.736 A:middle
notification experience.

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:47.116 A:middle
So, to summarize, when it comes

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:48.646 A:middle
to that first run experience,

00:25:48.646 --> 00:25:50.416 A:middle
you have the question, did you

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.836 A:middle
ask for lock screen access, or

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:52.996 A:middle
deliver quietly in the

00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:53.836 A:middle
notification center.

00:25:54.226 --> 00:25:55.266 A:middle
Well, I think it depends on your

00:25:55.266 --> 00:25:55.766 A:middle
content.

00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
Is it timely?

00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:59.216 A:middle
Does it require an urgent

00:25:59.216 --> 00:25:59.846 A:middle
response?

00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:01.726 A:middle
Then go on, ask for permission

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:02.816 A:middle
to send notifications to the

00:26:02.816 --> 00:26:03.386 A:middle
lock screen.

00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:05.286 A:middle
If you're sending passive

00:26:05.286 --> 00:26:07.106 A:middle
content that doesn't require an

00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:08.636 A:middle
immediate response, then

00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:09.936 A:middle
delivering directly to

00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:12.146 A:middle
notification center could be the

00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:13.196 A:middle
right approach.

00:26:14.116 --> 00:26:15.216 A:middle
But either way it's your

00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
decision to make.

00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:17.186 A:middle
This should be based on the

00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:20.866 A:middle
needs of your app.

00:26:21.136 --> 00:26:22.216 A:middle
Next, we need to make sure we're

00:26:22.216 --> 00:26:24.066 A:middle
really providing value with our

00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:26.036 A:middle
notification content and sending

00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:27.346 A:middle
just like the highest quality

00:26:27.346 --> 00:26:28.026 A:middle
notifications.

00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:30.086 A:middle
So, they need to be meaningful

00:26:30.086 --> 00:26:30.636 A:middle
content.

00:26:30.916 --> 00:26:32.026 A:middle
We should be sending specific

00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:32.646 A:middle
information.

00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:34.996 A:middle
Notifications are not just a

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:36.626 A:middle
reason to launch into the app.

00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:38.916 A:middle
And we've got to have a

00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:40.036 A:middle
well-designed settings and

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:41.446 A:middle
configuration UI so people can

00:26:41.446 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
easily tailor their notification

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:46.166 A:middle
experience from within your app.

00:26:46.416 --> 00:26:48.016 A:middle
Notification grouping it's a

00:26:48.016 --> 00:26:49.096 A:middle
great way to organize your

00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:49.696 A:middle
content.

00:26:50.076 --> 00:26:51.556 A:middle
So, by default, all notification

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:52.596 A:middle
from your app will group

00:26:52.636 --> 00:26:53.096 A:middle
together.

00:26:53.976 --> 00:26:54.896 A:middle
And you can use the threat

00:26:54.896 --> 00:26:56.856 A:middle
identifier to create threads, if

00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.756 A:middle
you need more nuanced grouping.

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.136 A:middle
But remember, only create

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.136 A:middle
But remember, only create

00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:02.396 A:middle
threads when necessary.

00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
Don't overdo it.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.886 A:middle
And finally, rich notifications

00:27:07.296 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
should be created to provide

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.036 A:middle
that extra bit of content around

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:10.786 A:middle
the notification.

00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:13.336 A:middle
Each notification should be a

00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:14.926 A:middle
specific task to complete.

00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:18.096 A:middle
You can add images, video,

00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.816 A:middle
audio, and custom content.

00:27:20.146 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
And now, interactivity to create

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.606 A:middle
a holistic notification

00:27:24.606 --> 00:27:25.156 A:middle
experience.

00:27:25.296 --> 00:27:29.496 A:middle
So, I mean that was a lot,

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:29.736 A:middle
right?

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:30.956 A:middle
That was a lot to take in, a lot

00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:32.566 A:middle
to do, a lot to consider.

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:33.896 A:middle
But, it's not everything.

00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:35.336 A:middle
There's still something else to

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:35.896 A:middle
consider.

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:38.106 A:middle
And for a lot of people it's the

00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:39.066 A:middle
most important.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.546 A:middle
And it's definitely the most

00:27:40.706 --> 00:27:41.886 A:middle
personal part of the

00:27:41.886 --> 00:27:43.096 A:middle
notification experience.

00:27:44.146 --> 00:27:44.786 A:middle
The Apple Watch.

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.496 A:middle
So, I'd like to invite my fellow

00:27:46.496 --> 00:27:48.366 A:middle
designer, Heena Ko here, to talk

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.006 A:middle
about making great notifications

00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:50.986 A:middle
on the Apple Watch.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:51.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:57.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:57.636 --> 00:27:58.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jon.

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:03.826 A:middle
Okay. So, we just heard about

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:03.826 A:middle
Okay. So, we just heard about

00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:06.726 A:middle
the importance of notifications

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.416 A:middle
on the phone.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:08.806 A:middle
So, why think about

00:28:08.806 --> 00:28:10.746 A:middle
notifications on Apple Watch?

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:13.306 A:middle
Well, we consider Apple Watch to

00:28:13.306 --> 00:28:14.556 A:middle
be our most personal device.

00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:16.056 A:middle
It states unlocked on your

00:28:16.056 --> 00:28:17.546 A:middle
wrist, so you stay connected.

00:28:17.866 --> 00:28:19.316 A:middle
But because it's so lightweight,

00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:20.296 A:middle
you can stay focused on what

00:28:20.296 --> 00:28:20.876 A:middle
you're doing.

00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:24.376 A:middle
And particularly for Apple

00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:26.356 A:middle
Watch, notifications are really

00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:28.056 A:middle
great and incredibly effective.

00:28:28.426 --> 00:28:29.486 A:middle
They're glanceable and the

00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:30.516 A:middle
interactions are lightweight.

00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:34.756 A:middle
And great notifications, they

00:28:34.756 --> 00:28:36.376 A:middle
send you valuable and timely

00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:37.206 A:middle
information.

00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:40.586 A:middle
Or, they can encourage you to

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:42.026 A:middle
reach your health goals.

00:28:43.196 --> 00:28:44.886 A:middle
And in some cases, they tell you

00:28:44.886 --> 00:28:46.696 A:middle
critical information, like if

00:28:46.696 --> 00:28:48.546 A:middle
you've had an elevated heart

00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:51.846 A:middle
rate.

00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:53.356 A:middle
Notifications are an essential

00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:54.496 A:middle
part of the Apple Watch

00:28:54.496 --> 00:28:55.106 A:middle
experience.

00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:56.906 A:middle
In fact, we'd go as far as

00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:58.236 A:middle
saying that notifications are

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.126 A:middle
the primary way people interact

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.126 A:middle
the primary way people interact

00:29:00.726 --> 00:29:04.026 A:middle
with apps on Apple Watch.

00:29:04.486 --> 00:29:05.796 A:middle
There's another important reason

00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:06.786 A:middle
why you may want to think about

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:08.076 A:middle
notifications on Apple Watch,

00:29:08.596 --> 00:29:09.806 A:middle
and that's because they can be

00:29:09.806 --> 00:29:10.986 A:middle
pushed to either device.

00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:13.886 A:middle
You see, we coordinate alerts.

00:29:13.946 --> 00:29:15.176 A:middle
So, we send them to the device

00:29:15.176 --> 00:29:16.546 A:middle
that's most accessible to you.

00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:19.776 A:middle
So, if your phone is locked,

00:29:19.776 --> 00:29:20.906 A:middle
it's in your bag, in your

00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:22.286 A:middle
pocket, which is a lot of the

00:29:22.286 --> 00:29:24.096 A:middle
time, then that notification

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:25.086 A:middle
gets sent to the watch.

00:29:25.676 --> 00:29:27.196 A:middle
So, you want to make sure that

00:29:27.446 --> 00:29:29.046 A:middle
that notification looks great in

00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:29.826 A:middle
both places.

00:29:32.626 --> 00:29:34.746 A:middle
Okay, so here's a picture I took

00:29:34.746 --> 00:29:35.906 A:middle
on a hike on Mount Tam the other

00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:36.146 A:middle
week.

00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:37.996 A:middle
It's really beautiful up there.

00:29:38.466 --> 00:29:41.426 A:middle
While I was going on a hike

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:43.246 A:middle
without my phone, I was able to

00:29:43.246 --> 00:29:44.406 A:middle
get this notification from Dark

00:29:44.486 --> 00:29:45.766 A:middle
Sky about an upcoming

00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:46.486 A:middle
thunderstorm.

00:29:47.196 --> 00:29:48.696 A:middle
So, now, with Apple Watch Series

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:50.726 A:middle
3 with cellular, notifications

00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:51.976 A:middle
on the watch are more important

00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:52.346 A:middle
than ever.

00:29:52.346 --> 00:29:55.296 A:middle
I can go hours without my phone.

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.316 A:middle
And still receive notifications

00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
and stay connected.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
and stay connected.

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:02.996 A:middle
Okay, so you may ask, how do I

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.946 A:middle
make them look great on both

00:30:03.946 --> 00:30:04.556 A:middle
devices?

00:30:05.286 --> 00:30:07.186 A:middle
Well, we try to make it as easy

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:08.886 A:middle
as possible for you by giving

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:09.726 A:middle
you some stuff for free.

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.906 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:14.876 A:middle
Take this notification from one

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:16.266 A:middle
of my favorite Podcast Apps

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:16.926 A:middle
Castro.

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:20.396 A:middle
When that phone notification is

00:30:20.496 --> 00:30:21.826 A:middle
pushed to the watch, some

00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:23.036 A:middle
elements come with it with

00:30:23.206 --> 00:30:23.806 A:middle
minimal work.

00:30:24.336 --> 00:30:27.026 A:middle
Like, the image attachments, as

00:30:27.076 --> 00:30:34.166 A:middle
well as the title, the body, and

00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:36.156 A:middle
any relevant quick actions.

00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:39.246 A:middle
So, here I'm able to add this

00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:40.676 A:middle
Podcast app to my queue from my

00:30:40.676 --> 00:30:42.456 A:middle
watch, so it's right in my phone

00:30:42.456 --> 00:30:45.846 A:middle
when I want to listen to it.

00:30:46.356 --> 00:30:47.466 A:middle
By simply adding a few

00:30:47.466 --> 00:30:49.036 A:middle
additional elements, the watch's

00:30:49.106 --> 00:30:50.896 A:middle
notification experience is so

00:30:51.936 --> 00:30:54.906 A:middle
much better.

00:30:55.096 --> 00:30:56.406 A:middle
Okay, so there are additional

00:30:56.406 --> 00:30:57.766 A:middle
ways you can customize your

00:30:57.766 --> 00:30:58.706 A:middle
watch notifications.

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:01.626 A:middle
You can add a sash color.

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:01.626 A:middle
You can add a sash color.

00:31:02.066 --> 00:31:03.636 A:middle
You can add a background color.

00:31:04.626 --> 00:31:06.646 A:middle
You can add images, icons and

00:31:06.646 --> 00:31:08.476 A:middle
even inline video to make your

00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:09.976 A:middle
notifications more visually

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:10.826 A:middle
rich.

00:31:12.626 --> 00:31:14.406 A:middle
Okay, and now if you have a

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:15.896 A:middle
WatchKit app you can create

00:31:15.896 --> 00:31:17.176 A:middle
interactive notifications.

00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:19.016 A:middle
Interactive notifications are a

00:31:19.016 --> 00:31:20.826 A:middle
new feature in WatchOS 5.

00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:21.986 A:middle
They allow for more

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:23.206 A:middle
interactivity right in the

00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:24.896 A:middle
notification, so you don't even

00:31:24.896 --> 00:31:25.636 A:middle
have to launch the app.

00:31:25.986 --> 00:31:26.816 A:middle
We're really excited about this

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:26.956 A:middle
one.

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:31.536 A:middle
Okay, so here's a notification

00:31:31.536 --> 00:31:32.986 A:middle
from a fictitious ride sharing

00:31:32.986 --> 00:31:33.226 A:middle
app.

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:34.496 A:middle
You guys know this.

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:35.846 A:middle
We all get these after every

00:31:35.846 --> 00:31:36.516 A:middle
single ride.

00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:38.166 A:middle
And occasionally I'll open the

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.546 A:middle
app and rate the ride right

00:31:39.546 --> 00:31:40.776 A:middle
after the ride is over.

00:31:41.336 --> 00:31:43.836 A:middle
But sometimes, actually a lot of

00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:45.566 A:middle
times, I forget to do it.

00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:49.246 A:middle
So, now in WatchOS 5 apps can

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:49.956 A:middle
create interactive

00:31:49.996 --> 00:31:50.826 A:middle
notifications.

00:31:51.356 --> 00:31:52.926 A:middle
Here's one from DiDi, I ride

00:31:52.926 --> 00:31:53.406 A:middle
sharing app.

00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:55.446 A:middle
So, they've included the ability

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.986 A:middle
to rate and pay right in the

00:31:56.986 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
notification.

00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:00.316 A:middle
I just have to rotate the

00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:00.316 A:middle
I just have to rotate the

00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:02.626 A:middle
digital crown, tap the stars,

00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:04.896 A:middle
hit pay, and I'm done.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.646 A:middle
So, this is a great example of

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:08.406 A:middle
an interface that clearly

00:32:08.406 --> 00:32:09.906 A:middle
communicates the purpose of that

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:11.506 A:middle
notification, which is to

00:32:11.506 --> 00:32:13.426 A:middle
encourage me to submit a rating

00:32:13.426 --> 00:32:14.156 A:middle
after my ride.

00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:18.576 A:middle
Pay By Phone is an app that

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:19.556 A:middle
allows you to pay for your

00:32:19.556 --> 00:32:20.566 A:middle
parking spot remotely.

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:22.196 A:middle
It's really convenient when I'm

00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.686 A:middle
still really far from my car and

00:32:23.686 --> 00:32:24.846 A:middle
I need to extend my time.

00:32:25.596 --> 00:32:26.816 A:middle
Here's a notification from them,

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:28.076 A:middle
letting me know that I only have

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.326 A:middle
10 minutes left on my parking

00:32:29.326 --> 00:32:29.666 A:middle
spot.

00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:31.636 A:middle
It allows me to extend my time

00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:32.696 A:middle
right in the long look.

00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:35.526 A:middle
I just have to rotate the

00:32:35.526 --> 00:32:36.966 A:middle
digital crown, and I tap

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:38.906 A:middle
steppers, and that's all I have

00:32:38.906 --> 00:32:41.256 A:middle
to do to extend my time.

00:32:41.736 --> 00:32:43.206 A:middle
So, this is a great example of a

00:32:43.206 --> 00:32:43.986 A:middle
quick interaction.

00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:45.676 A:middle
I was able to extend my parking

00:32:45.676 --> 00:32:51.086 A:middle
time with just a couple of taps.

00:32:51.246 --> 00:32:52.856 A:middle
So, amongst my friends, I'm

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:53.966 A:middle
oftentimes the person that

00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:55.146 A:middle
chooses the restaurant and makes

00:32:55.196 --> 00:32:56.126 A:middle
dinner reservations.

00:32:56.536 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
And because of traffic and

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:58.936 A:middle
weather, you name it, people are

00:32:58.936 --> 00:32:59.856 A:middle
always running late.

00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:03.096 A:middle
So, here's an interactive

00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:04.586 A:middle
notification from Yelp, letting

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:06.096 A:middle
me know that my table is ready.

00:33:06.666 --> 00:33:09.746 A:middle
And these new notifications,

00:33:09.856 --> 00:33:11.166 A:middle
they allow me to extend my

00:33:11.216 --> 00:33:12.736 A:middle
checking time and in this one,

00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:14.586 A:middle
for up to 45 minutes right in

00:33:14.586 --> 00:33:15.366 A:middle
the notification.

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:16.806 A:middle
So, we don't need to give up our

00:33:16.806 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
table if people are running

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:18.396 A:middle
late.

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.646 A:middle
Okay, so rich notifications are

00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:26.116 A:middle
particularly good for moments of

00:33:26.116 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
quick data input.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:28.786 A:middle
Here's a notification from a

00:33:28.786 --> 00:33:30.236 A:middle
fictitious medication reminder

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:30.476 A:middle
app.

00:33:31.046 --> 00:33:31.976 A:middle
It's reminding me to take my

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.386 A:middle
medication before the end of the

00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:33.676 A:middle
day.

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:37.186 A:middle
So, it not only reminds me to

00:33:37.186 --> 00:33:38.246 A:middle
take my medication at the right

00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.266 A:middle
time, but it also provides a

00:33:40.346 --> 00:33:41.606 A:middle
range of ways to respond.

00:33:41.716 --> 00:33:42.996 A:middle
I can say I took a single

00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:44.336 A:middle
medication, or I can tap the

00:33:44.336 --> 00:33:45.686 A:middle
take all button to say that I've

00:33:45.686 --> 00:33:46.246 A:middle
taken both.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:48.396 A:middle
So, this is really great,

00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:49.456 A:middle
because this is something that I

00:33:49.456 --> 00:33:50.736 A:middle
had to do every single day.

00:33:54.246 --> 00:33:55.596 A:middle
Okay, so what do these

00:33:55.596 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
notifications have in common?

00:33:57.266 --> 00:33:58.646 A:middle
Well, they were informative.

00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
At the same time, they're

00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
At the same time, they're

00:34:00.256 --> 00:34:00.866 A:middle
succinct.

00:34:03.236 --> 00:34:04.476 A:middle
They were visually rich.

00:34:04.596 --> 00:34:06.386 A:middle
These used images, videos, and

00:34:06.386 --> 00:34:08.146 A:middle
icons to make the notifications

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.166 A:middle
much visually richer.

00:34:11.576 --> 00:34:12.606 A:middle
They're actionable.

00:34:12.606 --> 00:34:14.656 A:middle
I was able to accomplish a tone

00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:16.156 A:middle
of things without even having to

00:34:16.156 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
open the app.

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:21.096 A:middle
And lastly, interactions on the

00:34:21.096 --> 00:34:22.136 A:middle
watch are best when they're

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:22.255 A:middle
quick.

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.255 A:middle
We're going to make

00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:24.716 A:middle
notifications richer, but we

00:34:24.716 --> 00:34:25.676 A:middle
don't want to recreate the app

00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:25.976 A:middle
experience.

00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
Okay, something you can do to

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:33.085 A:middle
make notifications even more

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.755 A:middle
effective is to get to know your

00:34:34.755 --> 00:34:34.985 A:middle
audience.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:38.036 A:middle
And tailor notifications to

00:34:38.036 --> 00:34:38.636 A:middle
individuals.

00:34:38.636 --> 00:34:40.085 A:middle
It can make a huge difference in

00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:43.366 A:middle
how they experience your app.

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.216 A:middle
My Weather is an adorable app

00:34:45.295 --> 00:34:46.295 A:middle
that sends me forecast

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:48.025 A:middle
notifications every morning and

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.596 A:middle
it's customized to my location.

00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:54.376 A:middle
I really love receiving

00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:55.996 A:middle
notifications from Wallet on my

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:56.456 A:middle
watch.

00:34:57.025 --> 00:34:57.986 A:middle
It's especially great, when

00:34:57.986 --> 00:34:58.896 A:middle
you're at the airport, and

00:34:58.896 --> 00:34:59.686 A:middle
you're dealing with lots of

00:34:59.686 --> 00:34:59.946 A:middle
luggage.

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.226 A:middle
Or you're at the store dealing

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.226 A:middle
Or you're at the store dealing

00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:03.046 A:middle
with lots of groceries, they're

00:35:03.046 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
also really handy when going to

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:04.496 A:middle
concerts.

00:35:05.256 --> 00:35:06.536 A:middle
So, here's a concert ticket I

00:35:06.536 --> 00:35:07.306 A:middle
got from Wallet.

00:35:07.696 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
It arrived right when I got to

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:08.926 A:middle
the venue.

00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:13.956 A:middle
It also contained a full-screen

00:35:13.956 --> 00:35:15.616 A:middle
QR code that allowed me to enter

00:35:15.616 --> 00:35:17.036 A:middle
the venue and I didn't even have

00:35:17.036 --> 00:35:17.866 A:middle
to pull my phone out.

00:35:19.186 --> 00:35:20.416 A:middle
This is a great example of

00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:21.906 A:middle
customizing the timing of when I

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:23.236 A:middle
received a notification.

00:35:23.686 --> 00:35:24.706 A:middle
It arrived right when I needed

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:25.906 A:middle
it and provided me with

00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:27.276 A:middle
everything I needed for the

00:35:27.276 --> 00:35:27.626 A:middle
event.

00:35:31.386 --> 00:35:33.026 A:middle
Okay, so Qantas Airlines has

00:35:33.246 --> 00:35:34.236 A:middle
really great interactive

00:35:34.236 --> 00:35:35.916 A:middle
notifications, and they allow

00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
you to share your flight time

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:38.596 A:middle
with that clutch friend that's

00:35:38.596 --> 00:35:39.586 A:middle
going to pick you up from the

00:35:39.586 --> 00:35:39.786 A:middle
airport.

00:35:40.316 --> 00:35:41.676 A:middle
Here, my friend Gabriel has just

00:35:41.676 --> 00:35:42.856 A:middle
sent me his trip information

00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:44.526 A:middle
through the Qantas app.

00:35:45.706 --> 00:35:47.646 A:middle
It includes his ETA, as well as

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:48.876 A:middle
the option to set up a pickup

00:35:48.876 --> 00:35:50.116 A:middle
reminder, which I'm totally

00:35:50.116 --> 00:35:52.776 A:middle
going to use.

00:35:52.966 --> 00:35:54.126 A:middle
Later in the evening, I'll

00:35:54.126 --> 00:35:55.186 A:middle
receive the pickup reminder,

00:35:55.346 --> 00:35:56.726 A:middle
along with a suggested time to

00:35:56.726 --> 00:35:56.976 A:middle
leave.

00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:00.256 A:middle
And it shows me exactly where I

00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:00.256 A:middle
And it shows me exactly where I

00:36:00.256 --> 00:36:02.826 A:middle
can pick him up, as well as the

00:36:02.826 --> 00:36:04.666 A:middle
options for directions and it

00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:05.986 A:middle
includes the option to send him

00:36:05.986 --> 00:36:07.186 A:middle
a message letting him know that

00:36:07.186 --> 00:36:07.756 A:middle
I'm going to be late.

00:36:07.826 --> 00:36:09.936 A:middle
So, must know that I'm in LA.

00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:12.436 A:middle
This is an excellent example of

00:36:12.586 --> 00:36:14.156 A:middle
customizing notifications along

00:36:14.156 --> 00:36:14.776 A:middle
an entire journey.

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.246 A:middle
They utilize time and location

00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:18.466 A:middle
as well as just simply providing

00:36:18.516 --> 00:36:20.096 A:middle
helpful tools to make sure

00:36:20.096 --> 00:36:21.616 A:middle
people have a great experience

00:36:21.696 --> 00:36:26.266 A:middle
from start to finish.

00:36:26.266 --> 00:36:27.656 A:middle
Okay, so, at this point,

00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:28.706 A:middle
everyone here should be a

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:29.776 A:middle
notification expert.

00:36:30.186 --> 00:36:31.256 A:middle
But we covered a lot.

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:35.096 A:middle
So, let's do a quick recap.

00:36:35.096 --> 00:36:39.896 A:middle
Okay the first run prompt.

00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
Notifications are oftentimes

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:42.126 A:middle
sensitive.

00:36:42.426 --> 00:36:43.936 A:middle
But if they're not considering

00:36:43.936 --> 00:36:45.316 A:middle
sending notifications directly

00:36:45.316 --> 00:36:46.286 A:middle
to notification center.

00:36:46.806 --> 00:36:47.946 A:middle
You won't be interrupting people

00:36:47.946 --> 00:36:49.286 A:middle
and folks can read them on their

00:36:49.286 --> 00:36:49.836 A:middle
own time.

00:36:52.236 --> 00:36:54.156 A:middle
Providing value and sending

00:36:54.156 --> 00:36:57.516 A:middle
great content.

00:36:57.606 --> 00:36:59.216 A:middle
Remember notifications are about

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
making human connections and

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
making human connections and

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:01.736 A:middle
conversation.

00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:04.276 A:middle
They're also about delivering

00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:05.586 A:middle
valuable information.

00:37:08.296 --> 00:37:09.686 A:middle
Consider delivery.

00:37:11.496 --> 00:37:12.986 A:middle
Consider providing ways for

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:14.016 A:middle
people to customizing

00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:15.786 A:middle
notifications and incorporate

00:37:15.786 --> 00:37:17.206 A:middle
things like time and location

00:37:17.206 --> 00:37:18.726 A:middle
when sending them.

00:37:19.486 --> 00:37:21.096 A:middle
Okay, notification grouping.

00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:25.666 A:middle
So, iOS and WatchOS will group

00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
notifications by app by default.

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:28.986 A:middle
And most of the time, that

00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:30.086 A:middle
should be totally okay.

00:37:30.656 --> 00:37:32.316 A:middle
But consider threading related

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:33.546 A:middle
content to have discrete

00:37:33.546 --> 00:37:34.616 A:middle
meaningful groupings.

00:37:35.216 --> 00:37:36.426 A:middle
People are really excited about

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:36.746 A:middle
this one.

00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:40.726 A:middle
Okay, rich notifications.

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:44.136 A:middle
Consider creating rich education

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:45.566 A:middle
so people can accomplish more

00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:46.506 A:middle
right in the moment.

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:50.796 A:middle
And last, but not least,

00:37:52.516 --> 00:37:54.126 A:middle
consider notifications on both

00:37:54.126 --> 00:37:54.686 A:middle
devices.

00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:56.056 A:middle
You'll be providing a great

00:37:56.056 --> 00:37:57.786 A:middle
experience in any circumstance.

00:37:58.316 --> 00:38:01.316 A:middle
So, the next time people hear

00:37:58.316 --> 00:38:01.316 A:middle
So, the next time people hear

00:38:01.316 --> 00:38:03.996 A:middle
this sound [ding], people will

00:38:03.996 --> 00:38:05.496 A:middle
be delighted because you value

00:38:05.496 --> 00:38:06.816 A:middle
their attention, and sent them

00:38:06.816 --> 00:38:07.686 A:middle
something really great.

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:08.976 A:middle
Thank you guys.
