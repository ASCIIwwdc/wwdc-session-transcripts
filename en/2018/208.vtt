00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:23.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:26.816 A:middle
Welcome to What's New in tvOS.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.846 A:middle
My name is Hans Kim, and I'm one

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.066 A:middle
of the engineers on the tvOS

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:31.366 A:middle
team.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:33.896 A:middle
I'm thrilled this afternoon to

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.476 A:middle
tell you about some of the new

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:36.836 A:middle
features in tvOS 12.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.026 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:41.276 A:middle
Password AutoFill, and we'll

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.266 A:middle
take a look at some new

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.736 A:middle
enhancements in tvOS's focus

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:45.186 A:middle
engine.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:47.586 A:middle
And, we'll conclude with some

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:51.026 A:middle
exciting news about some new UI

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:51.786 A:middle
patterns on tvOS.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
We have a lot of ground to

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:55.086 A:middle
cover, and we have some great

00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:56.536 A:middle
demos, so let's begin.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.766 A:middle
And, to get us started, I'd like

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.166 A:middle
to invite my colleagues Alex and


00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.166 A:middle
to invite my colleagues Alex and

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.346 A:middle
Conrad to tell us about helping

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:03.626 A:middle
your customers sign into your

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:03.806 A:middle
app.

[ Applause ]

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:11.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Hans.

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:13.386 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.256 A:middle
My name is Alex Sanciangco.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:17.016 A:middle
And, today I am so excited to

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.556 A:middle
talk to you all about Password

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:19.056 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.076 A:middle
Signing in is a common

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:23.236 A:middle
experience that users have with

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:23.636 A:middle
apps.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:25.276 A:middle
For instance, here's an app I've

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:26.676 A:middle
been working on called "shiny,"

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:28.756 A:middle
that shows our users an adorable

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.026 A:middle
photo of their favorite dogs

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:31.116 A:middle
every day when they log in.

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.826 A:middle
In order to make logging in as

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:35.046 A:middle
smooth as possible, we've

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:37.006 A:middle
brought Password AutoFill to

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:37.626 A:middle
tvOS 12.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:39.566 A:middle
With an experience just as

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.896 A:middle
familiar and easy as Password

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:42.796 A:middle
AutoFill on iOS.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:43.976 A:middle
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:54.646 A:middle
First, I'd like to show you

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:55.666 A:middle
continuity keyboard.

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:56.926 A:middle
As you might remember,

00:01:57.136 --> 00:01:58.846 A:middle
continuity keyboard is an iOS

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.576 A:middle
feature that allows users to


00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.576 A:middle
feature that allows users to

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:02.036 A:middle
enter text on the Apple TV,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.416 A:middle
using their iOS device.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:04.946 A:middle
Let's see it in action.

00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:06.696 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to that

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:08.556 A:middle
shiny app, and I'll select the

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:09.235 A:middle
email field.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.416 A:middle
As I expect, I see the

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:13.906 A:middle
continuity keyboard notification

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:15.136 A:middle
appear, which has now been

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.666 A:middle
enhanced to offer Password

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:17.466 A:middle
AutoFill as well.

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.136 A:middle
So, I'll open that up now.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:22.946 A:middle
And, I see that my username and

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:24.776 A:middle
password are suggested for the

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:25.906 A:middle
shiny app right there on the

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:26.566 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.236 A:middle
And, I know that with one tap,

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:29.646 A:middle
it'll be automatically filled

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:30.836 A:middle
into the TV, and I'll be signed

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:31.016 A:middle
in.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.000 A:middle
So, I'll do that now.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:35.976 A:middle
Aw, look at that guy.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:43.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:45.386 A:middle
So, I got the notification on my

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:47.146 A:middle
iPhone because my iPhone and

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:48.436 A:middle
Apple TV are on the same iCloud

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:48.856 A:middle
account.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.356 A:middle
And, if you're a user of the TV

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:52.896 A:middle
remote and control center, or

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:54.116 A:middle
the TV remote app, the

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.316 A:middle
experience is similar there as

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:55.536 A:middle
well.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.896 A:middle
But, we have something else

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.256 A:middle
brand new we want to show you

00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.496 A:middle
today, that shows just how easy


00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.496 A:middle
today, that shows just how easy

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:03.446 A:middle
we've made signing in, even for

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:04.846 A:middle
a guest that might not have ever

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:06.156 A:middle
used your Apple TV before.

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:07.686 A:middle
And, to demonstrate that, I'd

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:08.806 A:middle
like to invite Conrad up to the

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:09.000 A:middle
stage.

[ Applause ]

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:14.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alex.

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:18.216 A:middle
Now, suppose that I'm Alex's

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:18.626 A:middle
cousin.

00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:19.866 A:middle
I'm visiting for the week.

00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.636 A:middle
Now, his puppy's pretty cute.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.566 A:middle
But, I really want to sign in to

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:26.956 A:middle
shiny so I can see pictures of

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.196 A:middle
my own dog Max, or maybe his

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:30.596 A:middle
adorable sister, Min.

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.996 A:middle
Now, I've never used his Apple

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.266 A:middle
TV before, so I don't have any

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.246 A:middle
of the keyboard options

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:38.436 A:middle
available that he just

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:38.996 A:middle
discussed.

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:41.536 A:middle
Furthermore, since I use a

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:43.826 A:middle
strong password saved in iCloud

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:45.886 A:middle
keychain, I haven't memorized

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:46.026 A:middle
it.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.416 A:middle
I expect that I'm going to have

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:50.196 A:middle
to look up my password, and then

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.256 A:middle
type it in character by

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:54.296 A:middle
character on the Apple TV.

00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:56.476 A:middle
Well, let's see what happens.

00:03:58.596 --> 00:03:59.596 A:middle
I'm going to go over here.

00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:02.156 A:middle
I'm going to go to my phone.


00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:02.156 A:middle
I'm going to go to my phone.

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.776 A:middle
And, let's sign in.

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:08.546 A:middle
Oh, and even before I can open

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
settings, or ask Siri to look up

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.046 A:middle
my password, my iPhone is

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
already offering to help me

notification.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.146 A:middle
There we go.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:24.396 A:middle
And, by entering a PIN I know

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:27.226 A:middle
that I am securely connecting to

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.386 A:middle
this Apple TV.

Going to Touch ID.

And, my shiny credential appears

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.286 A:middle
right at the top, with one tap

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:37.156 A:middle
I'm signed in.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:37.976 A:middle

Aw. Sorry, it's just-- it's Min.

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:44.836 A:middle
OK.

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:47.796 A:middle
Now one thing you might be

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:50.086 A:middle
wondering is how did that work

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:53.606 A:middle
without all the iPhones in the

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:55.456 A:middle
room showing a notification?

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:59.316 A:middle
I think this is really, really

00:04:59.316 --> 00:04:59.586 A:middle
cool.


00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.606 A:middle
The Siri remote is able to

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:05.286 A:middle
locate nearby iPhones on which

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:06.196 A:middle
to offer AutoFill.

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:09.306 A:middle
So, in this case, only my iPhone

00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:10.436 A:middle
showed a notification.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.126 A:middle
And that is Password AutoFill

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:14.116 A:middle
for tvOS.

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:15.806 A:middle

I'd like to invite Alex back up

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:19.906 A:middle
to the stage to show you just

00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:21.786 A:middle
how easy it is to make this work

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:23.516 A:middle
flawlessly in your apps.

Man, I love that demo.

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:34.196 A:middle
I just think that feature is so

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:34.486 A:middle
cool.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.536 A:middle
Password AutoFill for tvOS is

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:39.756 A:middle
part of a suite of features that

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:40.586 A:middle
you might have heard about on

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:42.316 A:middle
Monday, meant to simplify the

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:43.256 A:middle
password experience.

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.516 A:middle
These features integrate into

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:46.786 A:middle
existing apps, without you

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:48.206 A:middle
having to make any big changes.

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:50.096 A:middle
And, there's a few things that

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:51.756 A:middle
you developers can do to ensure

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:53.006 A:middle
that Password AutoFill is as

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:53.916 A:middle
great as possible.

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:56.356 A:middle
Let's go over those briefly now.

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.906 A:middle
First, you'll want to ensure

00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
that the QuickType bar appears


00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
that the QuickType bar appears

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:01.286 A:middle
for your text fields.

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:03.976 A:middle
Next, you want to make sure that

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:05.366 A:middle
your app's credentials are

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.746 A:middle
suggested on the QuickType bar.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:10.326 A:middle
And lastly, you want to enable a

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.126 A:middle
one-tap sign in experience.

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:13.886 A:middle
Now, let's look at how to do

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
this in more detail.

00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:17.666 A:middle
To ensure the QuickType bar

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:19.186 A:middle
appears for your text fields,

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:20.466 A:middle
you want to adopt

00:06:20.616 --> 00:06:22.156 A:middle
UITextContentTypes.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.906 A:middle
tvOS will automatically try to

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.256 A:middle
detect username and password

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:27.746 A:middle
fields, and you can help this

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.646 A:middle
process by explicitly marking

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:30.416 A:middle
your text fields.

00:06:31.386 --> 00:06:32.556 A:middle
This is as easy as setting a

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
single property on those text

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:34.116 A:middle
fields.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:36.576 A:middle
Simply set, for your username

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:37.556 A:middle
text fields, it's

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:39.556 A:middle
textContentType to .username,

00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:41.316 A:middle
and similarly for your password

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:42.296 A:middle
field, you'll set its

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:43.986 A:middle
textContentType to .password.

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:45.836 A:middle
Very simple, and this can be

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:46.976 A:middle
done in Interface Builder as

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:47.216 A:middle
well.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.876 A:middle
So, after adopting the

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.536 A:middle
textContentTypes, here's what

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.756 A:middle
viewers would likely see in that

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:53.606 A:middle
continuity keyboard

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
notification.

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:55.826 A:middle
And, this is good, because it

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:57.236 A:middle
gives users access to their

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:57.816 A:middle
passwords.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
But, it's behind that key icon.


00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
But, it's behind that key icon.

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:01.446 A:middle
Too many taps away.

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
What we really want the user to

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.686 A:middle
see is this: your app's

00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:07.766 A:middle
credentials suggested right on

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:08.496 A:middle
the QuickType bar.

00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:10.976 A:middle
The way you get this behavior is

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:12.866 A:middle
by adopting a technology called

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.576 A:middle
Associated Domains, which

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:16.286 A:middle
securely tells Password AutoFill

00:07:16.316 --> 00:07:17.906 A:middle
which domains to suggest on the

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:19.000 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:23.496 A:middle
Associated Domains is a powerful

00:07:23.496 --> 00:07:25.116 A:middle
technology that enables other

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:26.366 A:middle
features, such as universal

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:26.976 A:middle
links and Handoff.

00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:33.646 A:middle
It creates a secure relationship

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.386 A:middle
between the domain the user's

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:36.966 A:middle
accessing and the app that they

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:37.806 A:middle
have downloaded.

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:40.976 A:middle
Password AutoFill then uses this

00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:42.456 A:middle
relationship to suggest the

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:44.176 A:middle
exact right credential, right on

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:46.576 A:middle
top of the QuickType bar.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.236 A:middle
To learn how to adopt Associated

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:49.996 A:middle
Domains, I highly recommend

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.456 A:middle
checking out "Introducing

00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:53.176 A:middle
Password AutoFill for Apps" from

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:54.416 A:middle
WWDC of last year.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.006 A:middle
This talk contains a

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:58.146 A:middle
step-by-step guide for how to

00:07:58.146 --> 00:07:59.946 A:middle
adopt Associated Domains for iOS

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.096 A:middle
apps, and the steps are


00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.096 A:middle
apps, and the steps are

00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:02.826 A:middle
identical for tvOS apps.

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:06.086 A:middle
So, after adopting Associated

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
Domains, this is what the user

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.686 A:middle
will likely see on the shiny app

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:11.046 A:middle
after tapping your credential on

00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:11.766 A:middle
the QuickType bar.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:13.046 A:middle
And, this is awesome.

00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:14.806 A:middle
The user has their username and

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.526 A:middle
passwords on their Apple TV

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:17.856 A:middle
without having to type a single

00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:18.476 A:middle
character.

00:08:18.546 --> 00:08:20.446 A:middle
But what we really want the user

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:21.966 A:middle
to see is this.

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:24.586 A:middle
Being automatically signed in

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:25.626 A:middle
and seeing their pupper of the

00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:27.696 A:middle
day, because they've been signed

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:28.476 A:middle
in with one tap.

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.796 A:middle
You can get this behavior by

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:32.436 A:middle
implementing the

00:08:32.436 --> 00:08:34.916 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments API.

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:38.025 A:middle
So, after filling in a password,

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
a focus update occurs.

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:40.846 A:middle
And, Password AutoFill will

00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:42.116 A:middle
perform the action of the

00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:43.566 A:middle
focused button if one is

00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:44.046 A:middle
focused.

00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:46.056 A:middle
So, you should implement the

00:08:46.056 --> 00:08:47.696 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments API,

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:49.536 A:middle
so you can provide your login

00:08:49.536 --> 00:08:50.766 A:middle
button to the focus engine.

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.126 A:middle
Let's look at how you might

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:53.966 A:middle
implement this.

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:55.546 A:middle
Here I have a sample

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:56.406 A:middle
implementation of the

00:08:56.406 --> 00:08:58.036 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments API,

00:08:58.516 --> 00:08:59.716 A:middle
which returns an array of

00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.636 A:middle
UIFocusEnvironment objects.


00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.636 A:middle
UIFocusEnvironment objects.

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.666 A:middle
First, we'll try to grab text

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:05.766 A:middle
out of our username and password

00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:06.106 A:middle
fields.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.606 A:middle
And, if we can, we'll just

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:08.806 A:middle
return that login button to the

00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:09.476 A:middle
focus engine.

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:11.486 A:middle
If we weren't able to grab any

00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:12.956 A:middle
text, that just means the user

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
hasn't entered any yet.

00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:16.036 A:middle
So, we'll return the username

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:17.306 A:middle
text field to be focused.

00:09:18.136 --> 00:09:18.736 A:middle
Super simple.

00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:21.656 A:middle
So, let's recap some of the

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:23.056 A:middle
major takeaways of Password

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:23.566 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:27.856 A:middle
For customers, Password AutoFill

00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
reduces the friction within your

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:32.006 A:middle
app by enabling a one-tap sign

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:32.986 A:middle
in experience.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:35.316 A:middle
If any adoption is needed on

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:37.266 A:middle
your part for developers, this

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:38.076 A:middle
is super simple.

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.296 A:middle
You simply have to just adopt

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:44.876 A:middle
UITextContentTypes, adopt

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.376 A:middle
Associated Domains so that your

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:47.886 A:middle
apps credentials are surfaced to

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:48.646 A:middle
the QuickType bar.

00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:51.436 A:middle
And, lastly, implement

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:53.116 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments to

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:55.006 A:middle
enable that one-tap sign in

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:55.696 A:middle
experience.

00:09:56.736 --> 00:09:57.916 A:middle
And that's Password AutoFill for

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
tvOS.

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.436 A:middle
We cannot wait for you and your


00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.436 A:middle
We cannot wait for you and your

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:01.966 A:middle
users to get your hands on it.

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:03.676 A:middle
Next, I'd like to invite up Ada

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:04.306 A:middle
to talk about focus

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:04.906 A:middle
enhancements.

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:12.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Alex.

00:10:14.716 --> 00:10:16.486 A:middle
Hi, my name is Ada Turner, and

00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:17.816 A:middle
I'm really excited to talk to

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
you today about some

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:19.956 A:middle
enhancements that we've made to

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:21.716 A:middle
Focus in tvOS 12.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
Focus is a great way for users

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:27.276 A:middle
to interact with your apps on

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:27.656 A:middle
tvOS.

00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.046 A:middle
It allows them to gracefully

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:30.746 A:middle
scroll through content and

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
provides playful movement

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.516 A:middle
hinting as they interact with

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:34.836 A:middle
the touch surface of the Siri

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:35.296 A:middle
remote.

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.616 A:middle
Apps built with UIKit,

00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:40.166 A:middle
SpriteKit, and SceneKit, all

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
have native support for focus.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:43.616 A:middle
However, apps that use

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:45.246 A:middle
alternative methods to render

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.076 A:middle
their content have not been able

00:10:47.076 --> 00:10:48.706 A:middle
to directly support the focus

00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:49.086 A:middle
engine.

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:51.856 A:middle
Today, I am pleased to announce

00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:54.046 A:middle
that in tvOS 12, the focus

00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:55.436 A:middle
engine, now supports apps

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.786 A:middle
regardless of how they are

00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:56.976 A:middle
rendered.

00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:02.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]


00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:02.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:04.966 A:middle
This means that apps written in

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:07.036 A:middle
frameworks such as Metal can now

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:09.056 A:middle
adopt focus directly into their

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:09.996 A:middle
interaction model.

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:12.006 A:middle
This is accomplished by allowing

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.596 A:middle
you to conform your own classes

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:15.666 A:middle
to focus protocols, even if they

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.196 A:middle
don't inherit from UIKit

00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:17.976 A:middle
components.

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:20.386 A:middle
Now, what this means for your

00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:22.726 A:middle
apps is they will get state

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.266 A:middle
management of what's currently

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:24.876 A:middle
focused.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.246 A:middle
Geometric determination of where

00:11:27.246 --> 00:11:28.806 A:middle
focus can and cannot move.

00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:32.136 A:middle
Full accessibility support, and

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:34.316 A:middle
focus movement, hinting, and

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:36.216 A:middle
scrolling that feels just like

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:37.686 A:middle
native tvOS apps.

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:40.556 A:middle
Before we take a look at the new

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.626 A:middle
focus API's, let's briefly

00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:43.816 A:middle
refresh ourselves on some

00:11:43.816 --> 00:11:45.266 A:middle
existing focus components.

00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:47.226 A:middle
First, we have

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:48.536 A:middle
UIFocusEnvironments.

00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:50.626 A:middle
This protocol manages state

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.026 A:middle
where focus interactions can

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:52.666 A:middle
take place.

00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:54.316 A:middle
It is notified when focus

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:56.296 A:middle
updates occur, and can influence

00:11:56.296 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
focus update behavior.

00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.206 A:middle
In UIKit, UIViewController is a


00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.206 A:middle
In UIKit, UIViewController is a

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:01.696 A:middle
great example of a focus

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:02.316 A:middle
environment.

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.526 A:middle
Next, we have UIFocusItem.

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:08.036 A:middle
This protocol inherits from

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:09.756 A:middle
FocusEnvironment, and adds the

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:11.326 A:middle
ability for focus items to

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:12.636 A:middle
actually be able to become

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:13.246 A:middle
focused.

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
UIKit's UIView, and SpriteKit's

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:18.156 A:middle
SKNode are great examples of

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:19.036 A:middle
focus items.

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:21.746 A:middle
And, finally we have the

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.666 A:middle
UIFocusSystem, which provides

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.736 A:middle
the famously useful

00:12:24.736 --> 00:12:26.556 A:middle
functionality of being able to

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:28.616 A:middle
register custom sounds to play

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:30.216 A:middle
during focus interactions.

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
For more information on how to

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.706 A:middle
work with these components, and

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.036 A:middle
debug focus, I highly recommend

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.176 A:middle
that you watch "Focus

00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:40.476 A:middle
Interaction in tvOS 11" from

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:41.096 A:middle
last year.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:44.286 A:middle
And now, I'm really excited to

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:46.196 A:middle
introduce some new components to

00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:47.076 A:middle
the focus engine.

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:50.756 A:middle
First, starting in tvOS 12, we

00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:52.486 A:middle
are expanding the functionality

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:54.056 A:middle
of the focusSystem object.

00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:55.496 A:middle
You may now retrieve a

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:56.996 A:middle
focusSystem for a given

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.926 A:middle
environment, and access the

00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:00.596 A:middle
currently focused item off of


00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:00.596 A:middle
currently focused item off of

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
the focusSystem.

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:04.256 A:middle
Next, we are introducing a new

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:05.346 A:middle
protocol, called

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:07.446 A:middle
UIFocusItemContainer, which

00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
provides geometric context to

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.056 A:middle
Focus items.

00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:13.416 A:middle
A focusItemContainer is owned by

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:15.276 A:middle
a focusEnvironment, and can

00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:17.136 A:middle
locate focus items within

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:19.076 A:middle
specific regions, allowing the

00:13:19.076 --> 00:13:20.826 A:middle
focus engine to move focus to

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:21.886 A:middle
the best candidate.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.476 A:middle
Next, we have a special type of

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.046 A:middle
focusItemContainer, called

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.836 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer,

00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:30.236 A:middle
which adds support for

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:31.646 A:middle
automatically scrolling through

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:33.426 A:middle
content as focus is moved.

00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:36.606 A:middle
And, finally, we now supply

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.846 A:middle
focusItems with movement hints,

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:40.726 A:middle
which contain raw values that

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.206 A:middle
you can use to create visual

00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:44.236 A:middle
effects that suggest what

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:46.056 A:middle
direction focus is about to move

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:46.266 A:middle
in.

00:13:47.266 --> 00:13:49.446 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:51.346 A:middle
how we can form our own classes

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:52.246 A:middle
to these protocols.

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:54.576 A:middle
Let's start by implementing a

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:56.056 A:middle
custom focusEnvironment.

00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:58.586 A:middle
In order for the focus engine to

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.666 A:middle
find your environment, and its


00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.666 A:middle
find your environment, and its

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.876 A:middle
child environments or items, you

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.766 A:middle
must supply a parent focus

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:05.906 A:middle
environment, and a

00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:07.066 A:middle
focusItemContainer.

00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:09.506 A:middle
For example, UIViewController

00:14:09.506 --> 00:14:10.736 A:middle
might provide its parent

00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:11.866 A:middle
viewController as its

00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:13.806 A:middle
parentFocusEnvironment, and its

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:16.076 A:middle
view as its focusItemContainer.

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:18.926 A:middle
FocusEnvironment provides

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:20.296 A:middle
several methods you can use to

00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:22.016 A:middle
control and react to focus

00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:22.636 A:middle
updates.

00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:23.766 A:middle
For example,

00:14:24.036 --> 00:14:25.706 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments

00:14:25.706 --> 00:14:27.336 A:middle
allows you to guide the focus

00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:29.476 A:middle
system in selecting what item is

00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:30.636 A:middle
focused after view

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.246 A:middle
initialization, or a

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:33.776 A:middle
programmatic focus update.

00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:36.136 A:middle
I'd like to call your attention

00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:38.036 A:middle
to two specific methods on the

00:14:38.036 --> 00:14:39.076 A:middle
focusEnvironment.

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:41.666 A:middle
SetNeedsFocusUpdate and

00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:42.836 A:middle
updateFocusIfNeeded.

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:44.866 A:middle
Your implementation of these

00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:48.006 A:middle
methods must call to a specific

00:14:48.006 --> 00:14:49.766 A:middle
method on the focusSystem.

00:14:51.116 --> 00:14:53.626 A:middle
Next, let's implement a custom

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:54.896 A:middle
focusItemContainer.

00:14:56.876 --> 00:14:58.716 A:middle
First, you will need to provide

00:14:58.716 --> 00:14:59.726 A:middle
a coordinateSpace.


00:15:00.146 --> 00:15:01.656 A:middle
UIView provides itself as a

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:02.546 A:middle
coordinateSpace.

00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:04.256 A:middle
If your container is more

00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:05.626 A:middle
abstract, you may return an

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.676 A:middle
existing coordinateSpace or

00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:08.516 A:middle
implement your own.

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:11.466 A:middle
Next, you will need to implement

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:12.626 A:middle
focusItems in rect.

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:14.686 A:middle
This method must return any

00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:16.496 A:middle
contained focusItems whose

00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:17.806 A:middle
frames intersect with the

00:15:17.806 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
provided rect.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.626 A:middle
Note that the rect passed to

00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:22.276 A:middle
this method is expressed in the

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:23.306 A:middle
coordinateSpace of the

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:25.756 A:middle
container, and the frames of

00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:27.506 A:middle
each focusItem you return from

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
this method must also be

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.006 A:middle
expressed in that

00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:30.976 A:middle
coordinateSpace.

00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:35.126 A:middle
Next, let's implement a custom

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:35.806 A:middle
FocusItem.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.246 A:middle
Remember that this protocol

00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:39.826 A:middle
inherits from FocusEnvironment,

00:15:39.826 --> 00:15:40.986 A:middle
so you will need to implement

00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:42.296 A:middle
all of those methods as well.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.196 A:middle
In order for the focus engine to

00:15:45.196 --> 00:15:47.216 A:middle
move focus onto your item, it

00:15:47.216 --> 00:15:48.586 A:middle
must return "true" from

00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:49.726 A:middle
canBecomeFocused.

00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:52.896 A:middle
DidHintFocusMovement is an

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
optional method that is called

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:55.966 A:middle
whenever the user moves their

00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:57.606 A:middle
finger on the touch surface of

00:15:57.606 --> 00:15:58.406 A:middle
the Siri remote.

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
It provides the focusItem with a


00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
It provides the focusItem with a

00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:03.206 A:middle
movement hint that contains raw

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:04.806 A:middle
values you can use to create an

00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:06.706 A:middle
effect that indicates what

00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:08.376 A:middle
direction focus is about to move

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:08.566 A:middle
in.

00:16:09.746 --> 00:16:11.066 A:middle
Finally, you will need to

00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
provide a frame.

00:16:12.256 --> 00:16:14.006 A:middle
As I said before, this frame

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.246 A:middle
must be expressed in the

00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:16.606 A:middle
coordinateSpace of the

00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:18.536 A:middle
containing focusItemContainer.

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:21.456 A:middle
For example, UIView expresses

00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:23.526 A:middle
its frame in the coordinateSpace

00:16:23.636 --> 00:16:25.866 A:middle
of its superview, which is also

00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:26.816 A:middle
its containing

00:16:26.926 --> 00:16:27.996 A:middle
focusItemContainer.

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:31.336 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:33.006 A:middle
the focusMovementHint object.

00:16:34.186 --> 00:16:35.956 A:middle
Movement direction is a vector,

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.736 A:middle
whose values range between

00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:40.306 A:middle
negative 1, negative 1 and 1,1

00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:42.606 A:middle
representing how close focus is

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:43.956 A:middle
to moving in a particular

00:16:43.956 --> 00:16:44.586 A:middle
direction.

00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:47.676 A:middle
This value is tied to the path a

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:49.276 A:middle
user's finger creates on the

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
touch surface of the Siri

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:51.056 A:middle
remote.

00:16:52.456 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
Perspective, rotation, and

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.686 A:middle
translation are all values you

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:59.006 A:middle
can use to match tvOS's native

00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
interaction hinting.


00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
interaction hinting.

00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:02.496 A:middle
And, interactionTransform

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:04.116 A:middle
combines all three of these

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:05.715 A:middle
values into a single 3D

00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:06.326 A:middle
transform.

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:09.945 A:middle
Next, let's look at how to

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.006 A:middle
implement a custom

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.965 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer.

00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:15.286 A:middle
This is a special type of

00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
focusItemContainer, and by

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:18.606 A:middle
conforming to this protocol,

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
your container signals to the

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:22.016 A:middle
focus engine that it supports

00:17:22.016 --> 00:17:22.486 A:middle
scrolling.

00:17:22.806 --> 00:17:24.626 A:middle
For example, UIScrollView

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.006 A:middle
conforms to this protocol.

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:28.856 A:middle
It provides three additional

00:17:28.856 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
properties that allows the focus

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.446 A:middle
engine to manage its scrolling

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:32.986 A:middle
behavior.

00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:36.146 A:middle
First, we have contentOffset,

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.376 A:middle
which is a read/write property

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:39.746 A:middle
representing how far the

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:41.106 A:middle
container has been scrolled.

00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:43.406 A:middle
This property will automatically

00:17:43.406 --> 00:17:45.506 A:middle
be set by the focus engine as

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.916 A:middle
focus is moved in order to keep

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.416 A:middle
the currently focused item on

00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:49.916 A:middle
screen.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.076 A:middle
Second, we have contentSize,

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:56.686 A:middle
which represents the total size

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:58.626 A:middle
of your scrollable content and

00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
third, we have visibleSize,


00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
third, we have visibleSize,

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
which represents the onscreen

00:18:02.626 --> 00:18:04.016 A:middle
size of your container.

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:06.196 A:middle
This property is analogous to

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:08.346 A:middle
bounds.size on the UIScrollView.

00:18:09.396 --> 00:18:11.736 A:middle
It is important to remember that

00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:13.166 A:middle
contentOffset will be set

00:18:13.256 --> 00:18:15.086 A:middle
automatically, and it is your

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:17.306 A:middle
responsibility to update your

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:18.786 A:middle
rendered content as appropriate

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:19.976 A:middle
whenever this property is set.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:25.916 A:middle
Now, let's talk about adding

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:27.566 A:middle
accessibility to our custom

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:28.326 A:middle
rendered apps.

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:30.926 A:middle
It's actually incredibly easy.

00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:32.366 A:middle
By implementing

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:34.816 A:middle
focusItemContainers, focusItems

00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
in rect method, you are

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.176 A:middle
providing the focus engine with

00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:39.826 A:middle
enough information to allow

00:18:39.826 --> 00:18:41.836 A:middle
voiceover to assist your users

00:18:41.836 --> 00:18:42.736 A:middle
in navigation.

00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:45.456 A:middle
Remember to set accessibility

00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:47.716 A:middle
labels and accessibility hints

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:49.876 A:middle
on your focusItems in order for

00:18:49.876 --> 00:18:51.676 A:middle
voiceover to give your users the

00:18:51.676 --> 00:18:53.066 A:middle
best experience.

00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:55.056 A:middle
I highly recommend that you

00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:56.536 A:middle
watch "What's New in

00:18:56.536 --> 00:18:59.946 A:middle
Accessibility" from WWDC 2016

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:02.206 A:middle
for a more in-depth look at how


00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:02.206 A:middle
for a more in-depth look at how

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:04.576 A:middle
focus and voiceover work

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.116 A:middle
together in tvOS.

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:10.336 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite my

00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:12.026 A:middle
colleague, Paul, to give us a

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.406 A:middle
demo on how to create a

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:14.886 A:middle
focus-powered Metal app.

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:21.516 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:22.016 --> 00:19:22.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ada.

00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:25.036 A:middle
So, I'm working on the setting

00:19:25.036 --> 00:19:26.576 A:middle
screen for a Metal-based game.

00:19:27.136 --> 00:19:28.156 A:middle
At the bottom of the screen,

00:19:28.306 --> 00:19:29.226 A:middle
there's some standard UI

00:19:29.226 --> 00:19:29.646 A:middle
buttons.

00:19:30.426 --> 00:19:32.116 A:middle
And, up at the top are some

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:33.406 A:middle
tiles for selecting levels.

00:19:34.086 --> 00:19:35.076 A:middle
These tiles are actually

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.006 A:middle
rendered by the game engine

00:19:36.006 --> 00:19:36.526 A:middle
itself.

00:19:36.906 --> 00:19:37.736 A:middle
I'm sure you can tell by the

00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:38.986 A:middle
incredible 3D graphics that you

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:39.516 A:middle
see up there.

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.736 A:middle
So, I want to be able to select

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:43.216 A:middle
the tiles using the remote.

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:45.646 A:middle
Previously, I would have had to

00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:46.616 A:middle
handle events from the remote

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:48.596 A:middle
myself, and implement my own

00:19:48.596 --> 00:19:50.446 A:middle
navigation, trying my best to

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.466 A:middle
match the feel of the focus

00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:51.806 A:middle
engine.

00:19:52.306 --> 00:19:54.256 A:middle
In tvOS 12, I can connect these

00:19:54.256 --> 00:19:55.706 A:middle
tiles directly to the focus

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:56.016 A:middle
engine.

00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:56.976 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and do that.


00:20:01.506 --> 00:20:02.696 A:middle
The first thing I'm going to do

00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:04.566 A:middle
is extend my LevelTile class to

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:06.046 A:middle
implement the UIFocusItem.

00:20:06.316 --> 00:20:07.826 A:middle
This is what will allow it to

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:08.536 A:middle
become focused.

00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:10.866 A:middle
There's a few methods here.

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:11.956 A:middle
I'm just going to direct your

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
attention to a few at the top.

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:15.556 A:middle
It canBecomeFocused, I'm going

00:20:15.556 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
to enter in "true."

00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:17.616 A:middle
That's straightforward.

00:20:18.616 --> 00:20:20.116 A:middle
For parentFocusEnvironment, I'm

00:20:20.216 --> 00:20:21.536 A:middle
going to return the MetalView

00:20:21.536 --> 00:20:22.576 A:middle
that renders these items.

00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:25.156 A:middle
Finally in didUpdateFocus in

00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:26.676 A:middle
context, I'm going to set the

00:20:26.676 --> 00:20:28.516 A:middle
tile to draw itself in an active

00:20:28.516 --> 00:20:30.286 A:middle
state when it becomes focused.

00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:33.356 A:middle
Next, I need to tell the focus

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:34.666 A:middle
engine about these new items.

00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:37.076 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to extend

00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:39.176 A:middle
that MetalView that renders

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:39.356 A:middle
them.

00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:41.636 A:middle
The view is already in the view

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:43.026 A:middle
hierarchy, and the focus engine

00:20:43.026 --> 00:20:43.956 A:middle
already knows about it.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:45.216 A:middle
So, it's a great place to hook

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:45.496 A:middle
in.

00:20:46.436 --> 00:20:47.906 A:middle
And, because this is a UIView,

00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:49.196 A:middle
it already conforms to

00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:50.526 A:middle
UIFocusItemContainer.

00:20:50.906 --> 00:20:52.686 A:middle
And, it provides itself as a

00:20:52.686 --> 00:20:53.526 A:middle
coordinatespace.

00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:55.776 A:middle
The only thing I have to do is

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:58.296 A:middle
override FocusItem in rect to

00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:00.066 A:middle
return my level tiles, which of


00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:00.066 A:middle
return my level tiles, which of

00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.826 A:middle
course are now UIFocusItems.

00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:04.286 A:middle
And, I can get a performance win

00:21:04.286 --> 00:21:05.896 A:middle
here, by only returning the

00:21:05.896 --> 00:21:07.496 A:middle
tiles these frames intersect the

00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:08.506 A:middle
path in search rect.

00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:10.576 A:middle
Yikes.

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.606 A:middle
Let's take a look and see how

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:12.976 A:middle
that works.

00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:18.866 A:middle
So, now you can see that the

00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:21.276 A:middle
tiles are focusable, and the

00:21:21.276 --> 00:21:22.536 A:middle
system even plays a standard

00:21:22.536 --> 00:21:23.846 A:middle
sound when they become focused.

00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:25.996 A:middle
I can even move focus in between

00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:27.216 A:middle
my custom tiles, and the

00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:28.476 A:middle
standard UI buttons down at the

00:21:28.476 --> 00:21:28.846 A:middle
bottom.

00:21:29.816 --> 00:21:31.396 A:middle
There's a problem here, though.

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.536 A:middle
The tiles extend offscreen.

00:21:34.146 --> 00:21:35.986 A:middle
If I move focus offscreen, I

00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:37.056 A:middle
can't see what I'm interacting

00:21:37.056 --> 00:21:37.206 A:middle
with.

00:21:38.156 --> 00:21:39.326 A:middle
Of course, what I want is for

00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:40.836 A:middle
the tiles to move onscreen as

00:21:40.836 --> 00:21:41.616 A:middle
they become focused.

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:43.256 A:middle
So, let's implement that.

00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:47.226 A:middle
I'm going to extend that

00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:49.706 A:middle
RenderView again, this time to

00:21:49.706 --> 00:21:50.166 A:middle
implement

00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:52.286 A:middle
UIFocusItemScrollableContainer.

00:21:53.086 --> 00:21:54.776 A:middle
Now, the important thing here is

00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:56.086 A:middle
to adjust my rendering by the

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:56.916 A:middle
contentOffset.

00:21:57.536 --> 00:21:58.726 A:middle
The focus engine will set my

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.496 A:middle
contentOffset as focus moves to


00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.496 A:middle
contentOffset as focus moves to

00:22:01.496 --> 00:22:02.676 A:middle
keep the currently focused item

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:03.296 A:middle
onscreen.

00:22:04.306 --> 00:22:05.426 A:middle
Because this is a UIView, I'm

00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:07.206 A:middle
going to also update by

00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:08.986 A:middle
bounds.origin so that the

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:10.336 A:middle
coordinateSpace conversion

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:11.486 A:middle
continues to work correctly.

00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:17.466 A:middle
See how that works?

00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:19.616 A:middle
So, now you can see that as I

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:21.836 A:middle
focus a tile, it moves onscreen.

00:22:22.586 --> 00:22:24.546 A:middle
If I keep going, I get nice,

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.286 A:middle
smooth scrolling with the same

00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:28.746 A:middle
momentum-- thanks-- nice, smooth

00:22:28.746 --> 00:22:30.216 A:middle
scrolling with the same momentum

00:22:30.216 --> 00:22:31.826 A:middle
and animation as if this was a

00:22:31.826 --> 00:22:32.536 A:middle
UIScrollView.

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.006 A:middle
So, this is looking pretty good,

00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:36.476 A:middle
but I think we can do even

00:22:36.476 --> 00:22:36.776 A:middle
better.

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:38.496 A:middle
What I really want is for these

00:22:38.526 --> 00:22:40.036 A:middle
tiles to come alive when they're

00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:41.506 A:middle
focused, just like the system

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:41.986 A:middle
elements.

00:22:43.106 --> 00:22:45.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:47.046 A:middle
Going to go back up to

00:22:47.046 --> 00:22:47.776 A:middle
LevelTile.

00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:49.886 A:middle
And, I'm going to implement an

00:22:49.886 --> 00:22:50.666 A:middle
optional method,

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:52.406 A:middle
didHintFocusMovement.

00:22:53.486 --> 00:22:55.036 A:middle
I'm going to take the suggested

00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:56.866 A:middle
perspective, rotation, and

00:22:56.866 --> 00:22:58.156 A:middle
translation values from the

00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
UIFocusMovementHint, and apply


00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
UIFocusMovementHint, and apply

00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
them when I render the

00:23:01.206 --> 00:23:02.206 A:middle
focusTile.

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:03.976 A:middle
Let's see how that looks.

00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:11.506 A:middle
Now, as I move my finger on the

00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:14.156 A:middle
trackpad, the tile interacts

00:23:14.216 --> 00:23:15.896 A:middle
just the way I'd expect.

00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:18.036 A:middle
So, now I've added focus support

00:23:18.136 --> 00:23:19.966 A:middle
to my custom Metal objects, and

00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:21.486 A:middle
they feel just as familiar as if

00:23:21.486 --> 00:23:22.716 A:middle
they were written using ULikeIT.

00:23:23.306 --> 00:23:23.976 A:middle
Back to you, Ada.

00:23:24.516 --> 00:23:28.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:28.856 --> 00:23:29.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paul.

00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:32.446 A:middle
Wow, that was a really Metal

00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:32.826 A:middle
demo.

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:35.146 A:middle
With just a few lines of code,

00:23:35.316 --> 00:23:37.136 A:middle
we were able to give our Metal

00:23:37.136 --> 00:23:38.956 A:middle
user interface beautifully

00:23:38.956 --> 00:23:40.886 A:middle
smooth focused movement and

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.976 A:middle
scrolling, and delightful

00:23:42.976 --> 00:23:44.816 A:middle
interaction hinting, just like

00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:46.366 A:middle
native tvOS apps.

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:49.496 A:middle
Now, let's recap all the awesome

00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.746 A:middle
new focus features we learned

00:23:50.746 --> 00:23:51.236 A:middle
about today.

00:23:52.116 --> 00:23:53.646 A:middle
First, we learned how to

00:23:53.646 --> 00:23:54.576 A:middle
implement custom

00:23:54.576 --> 00:23:55.806 A:middle
focusEnvironments and

00:23:55.806 --> 00:23:58.116 A:middle
focusItems, even if they don't

00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:59.796 A:middle
inherit from UIKit components.


00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:02.596 A:middle
Second, we learned how to use

00:24:02.736 --> 00:24:04.966 A:middle
focusItemContainer, so that when

00:24:04.966 --> 00:24:06.336 A:middle
users move focus through our

00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:08.126 A:middle
apps, it feels just like native

00:24:08.126 --> 00:24:09.196 A:middle
tvOS apps.

00:24:09.926 --> 00:24:11.566 A:middle
Third, we learned how to use

00:24:11.606 --> 00:24:13.286 A:middle
focusMovementHint to make our

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:15.056 A:middle
interface come alive as people

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:16.836 A:middle
interact with the Siri remote.

00:24:17.736 --> 00:24:19.636 A:middle
Fourth, we learned how to use

00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.676 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer to

00:24:21.676 --> 00:24:23.276 A:middle
allow people to scroll through

00:24:23.276 --> 00:24:24.466 A:middle
our apps content with that

00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:25.906 A:middle
smooth, familiar, native

00:24:25.906 --> 00:24:26.446 A:middle
feeling.

00:24:26.996 --> 00:24:28.786 A:middle
And, finally, we learned how to

00:24:28.786 --> 00:24:31.856 A:middle
give our apps full accessibility

00:24:31.856 --> 00:24:34.156 A:middle
support simply by adopting these

00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:36.026 A:middle
protocols, and providing

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:37.576 A:middle
accessibility labels and hints

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:39.606 A:middle
so that everyone can enjoy our

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:40.196 A:middle
apps.

00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:42.186 A:middle
All of these awesome new

00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:43.726 A:middle
features are available today in

00:24:43.726 --> 00:24:45.496 A:middle
the Developer Beta, and I highly

00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:46.706 A:middle
recommend that you download it,

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.936 A:middle
and find out just how easy it is

00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.326 A:middle
to add focus support to your

00:24:50.326 --> 00:24:52.356 A:middle
custom rendered apps.

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:54.466 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite Hans

00:24:54.466 --> 00:24:55.856 A:middle
back on the stage, to tell us

00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:57.466 A:middle
about some awesome UI patterns

00:24:57.466 --> 00:24:57.976 A:middle
on tvOS.

00:24:58.516 --> 00:25:00.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]


00:24:58.516 --> 00:25:00.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:01.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ada.

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.546 A:middle
Focus interaction is integral in

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:07.906 A:middle
how we feel connected to the

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:08.936 A:middle
screen across the room.

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.726 A:middle
And, tvOS has many common UI

00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
patterns that make the most out

00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:14.386 A:middle
of it.

00:25:14.476 --> 00:25:17.756 A:middle
One such example is a label that

00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:19.006 A:middle
animates its text when it's

00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:19.516 A:middle
focused.

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.606 A:middle
Internally scrolling text, or

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:25.936 A:middle
marquee animation, is a useful

00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:27.736 A:middle
technique in presenting variable

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:29.426 A:middle
length strings without altering

00:25:29.426 --> 00:25:30.996 A:middle
the label's external geometry.

00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:34.436 A:middle
It's also very effective in

00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:36.256 A:middle
visually highlighting where your

00:25:36.256 --> 00:25:37.516 A:middle
current focus is.

00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:40.676 A:middle
This behavior is very widely

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:43.156 A:middle
used across tvOS, but there's

00:25:43.156 --> 00:25:44.506 A:middle
not an easy way to do this.

00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:46.636 A:middle
That is, until now.

00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:49.356 A:middle
tvOS 12 makes it really easy.

00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:52.786 A:middle
All you have to do is to set a

00:25:52.786 --> 00:25:54.066 A:middle
new property on your label,

00:25:54.946 --> 00:25:55.356 A:middle
enables

00:25:55.356 --> 00:25:56.886 A:middle
MarqueeWhenAncestorFocused to

00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:56.976 A:middle
"true."

00:25:57.516 --> 00:26:01.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]


00:25:57.516 --> 00:26:01.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:04.316 A:middle
Then, when a view containing the

00:26:04.316 --> 00:26:06.136 A:middle
label comes in focus, and the

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:07.936 A:middle
label contains a string, it's

00:26:08.086 --> 00:26:09.846 A:middle
too long for the width.

00:26:11.406 --> 00:26:13.486 A:middle
It will animate the string

00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:15.456 A:middle
horizontally in a loop.

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:19.046 A:middle
We've used this API ourselves,

00:26:19.046 --> 00:26:20.286 A:middle
and we think you will really

00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:21.656 A:middle
like how simple it is to adopt

00:26:21.656 --> 00:26:22.256 A:middle
the behavior.

00:26:23.436 --> 00:26:24.976 A:middle
So, that's text scrolling in UI

00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:25.256 A:middle
label.

00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:30.256 A:middle
But, tvOS has many more idioms

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:33.066 A:middle
and patterns, such as an image

00:26:33.066 --> 00:26:35.316 A:middle
and a label when come alive when

00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:39.116 A:middle
in focus, an arbitrary view

00:26:39.116 --> 00:26:40.636 A:middle
hierarchy that floats as one

00:26:40.636 --> 00:26:45.526 A:middle
solid unit, buttons with

00:26:45.526 --> 00:26:47.346 A:middle
customizable focus movement and

00:26:47.346 --> 00:26:47.766 A:middle
content,

00:26:50.986 --> 00:26:52.276 A:middle
and widgets for representing

00:26:52.276 --> 00:26:52.666 A:middle
people.

00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:55.536 A:middle
And, as you can see, these

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:57.466 A:middle
patterns are ubiquitous across

00:26:57.466 --> 00:26:58.626 A:middle
tvOS and Apple's own apps.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.646 A:middle
And, since they've been


00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.646 A:middle
And, since they've been

00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:03.036 A:middle
available in TVMLKit, we see

00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:04.626 A:middle
them adopted in your apps as

00:27:04.626 --> 00:27:04.926 A:middle
well.

00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:07.466 A:middle
But, what if your app is based

00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:08.106 A:middle
on UIKit?

00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:11.446 A:middle
Well, we're really thrilled to

00:27:11.816 --> 00:27:14.856 A:middle
share with you that tvOS 12 will

00:27:14.856 --> 00:27:16.436 A:middle
make several of these available

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:17.966 A:middle
for your UIKit-based apps.

00:27:18.516 --> 00:27:22.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:23.296 --> 00:27:24.806 A:middle
And, we do this through a new

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:26.956 A:middle
lightweight framework, TVUIKit.

00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:30.676 A:middle
The first four elements in

00:27:30.676 --> 00:27:34.386 A:middle
TVUIKit are poster, caption

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:34.736 A:middle
button,

00:27:35.846 --> 00:27:38.016 A:middle
card, and monogram.

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:40.156 A:middle
Let's take a look at each.

00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:43.316 A:middle
Poster view is about images.

00:27:44.306 --> 00:27:46.186 A:middle
And, TVPosterView is a composed

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.986 A:middle
view specializing in presenting

00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:50.256 A:middle
an image, and a footer, which

00:27:50.256 --> 00:27:52.116 A:middle
itself is composed of up to two

00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:52.606 A:middle
labels.

00:27:53.796 --> 00:27:55.146 A:middle
When a poster view is in focus,

00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:57.446 A:middle
the image grows in size, and the

00:27:57.446 --> 00:27:58.926 A:middle
labels move out of the way to

00:27:58.926 --> 00:27:59.526 A:middle
give room.


00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:02.966 A:middle
When it relinquishes focus, the

00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:04.506 A:middle
image and labels come back to

00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:05.226 A:middle
the normal layout.

00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:08.156 A:middle
When you program an image to a

00:28:08.156 --> 00:28:10.506 A:middle
TVPosterView, it works out just

00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:11.946 A:middle
the right amount by which the

00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:12.616 A:middle
image grows.

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:15.986 A:middle
And, TVPosterView is an ideal

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:18.456 A:middle
API for creating a UI like this.

00:28:19.006 --> 00:28:19.786 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:28:20.476 --> 00:28:23.296 A:middle
And, that's TVPosterView.

00:28:24.776 --> 00:28:26.166 A:middle
Next, is caption button.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:28.526 A:middle
Caption button is about

00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:29.336 A:middle
call-to-action.

00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:34.156 A:middle
And, TVCaptionButtonView is a

00:28:34.156 --> 00:28:35.896 A:middle
composed view specializing in

00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:37.276 A:middle
presenting a button-like

00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:40.226 A:middle
content, and a footer, which

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.806 A:middle
itself is composed of up to two

00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:42.156 A:middle
labels.

00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:45.306 A:middle
The content view has a blurred

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.366 A:middle
background, and can either have

00:28:47.366 --> 00:28:49.266 A:middle
an image, or a text.

00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:52.366 A:middle
When a CaptionButtonView is in

00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:57.106 A:middle
focus, it floats and unlike the

00:28:57.106 --> 00:28:59.176 A:middle
PosterView, it increases its

00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:01.376 A:middle
size only in the leading, top,


00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:01.376 A:middle
size only in the leading, top,

00:29:01.376 --> 00:29:03.106 A:middle
and trailing directions.

00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:06.276 A:middle
You can also limit the floating

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:10.106 A:middle
motion to horizontal only or

00:29:10.246 --> 00:29:10.956 A:middle
vertical only.

00:29:12.506 --> 00:29:13.956 A:middle
And, when you use multiple

00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:15.926 A:middle
TVCaptionButtons and give them a

00:29:15.926 --> 00:29:18.026 A:middle
consistent motion direction, you

00:29:18.026 --> 00:29:19.466 A:middle
can create a sense of grouping.

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:21.976 A:middle
And, TVCaptionButton makes it

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:22.976 A:middle
really easy to do this.

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.816 A:middle
Next, is CardView.

00:29:28.836 --> 00:29:30.616 A:middle
CardView is about custom views.

00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:34.576 A:middle
And, TVCardView specializes in

00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:36.406 A:middle
presenting arbitrarily composed

00:29:36.406 --> 00:29:37.166 A:middle
view hierarchy.

00:29:38.346 --> 00:29:41.066 A:middle
When a CardView is in focus,

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:44.146 A:middle
it's content view floats and all

00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:46.356 A:middle
of its subviews move in unison

00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:48.226 A:middle
as part of the floating content

00:29:48.906 --> 00:29:49.016 A:middle
view.

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.226 A:middle
TVCardView is a great way to

00:29:53.226 --> 00:29:56.296 A:middle
create a UI like this.

00:29:57.016 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
It's really straightforward.


00:30:02.256 --> 00:30:04.716 A:middle
Next, is monogram.

00:30:06.816 --> 00:30:08.656 A:middle
MonogramView is for representing

00:30:08.656 --> 00:30:09.006 A:middle
people.

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:13.716 A:middle
And, TVMonogramView has a

00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:15.876 A:middle
circular content image, and a

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:17.836 A:middle
footer, which itself is composed

00:30:17.836 --> 00:30:18.746 A:middle
of up to two labels.

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:22.496 A:middle
When you don't provide either a

00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:23.786 A:middle
person name, or an image,

00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:26.266 A:middle
TVMonogramView provides a

00:30:26.266 --> 00:30:27.156 A:middle
generic silhouette.

00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:30.606 A:middle
If you do provide a person name,

00:30:31.386 --> 00:30:33.146 A:middle
TVMonogramView will create a

00:30:33.146 --> 00:30:34.306 A:middle
monogram from the initials.

00:30:34.906 --> 00:30:38.656 A:middle
And, of course, when you provide

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:40.446 A:middle
an image, it doesn't question

00:30:40.446 --> 00:30:41.576 A:middle
it, we'll just use it.

00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:46.266 A:middle
When TVMonogramView is in focus,

00:30:47.396 --> 00:30:48.686 A:middle
the labels move out of the way

00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:50.526 A:middle
for the image to grow in size.

00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:54.926 A:middle
When you use a TVMonogramView,

00:30:56.006 --> 00:30:57.666 A:middle
creating a UI like this becomes

00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:58.746 A:middle
really straightforward.

00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:01.396 A:middle
Now, you might have noticed that


00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:01.396 A:middle
Now, you might have noticed that

00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:02.946 A:middle
there's a consistent pattern

00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:04.376 A:middle
among these four elements.

00:31:05.696 --> 00:31:08.056 A:middle
Namely, there's a main content,

00:31:09.146 --> 00:31:10.496 A:middle
and an optional header and

00:31:10.546 --> 00:31:10.816 A:middle
footer.

00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:13.116 A:middle
And, when this composition comes

00:31:13.116 --> 00:31:14.916 A:middle
in focus, the header and footer

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.726 A:middle
move out of the way, and the

00:31:16.726 --> 00:31:18.886 A:middle
content to grow in size.

00:31:19.876 --> 00:31:21.766 A:middle
This common behavior is

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.606 A:middle
encapsulated in a base class,

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:25.066 A:middle
TVLockupView.

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:28.206 A:middle
Some of the things you can

00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:31.066 A:middle
customize in a TVLockupView are

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.496 A:middle
the explicit content size.

00:31:34.576 --> 00:31:35.696 A:middle
This is really helpful when

00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:36.696 A:middle
you're laying out multiple

00:31:36.696 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
LockupViews.

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:41.856 A:middle
Another one is the content-- the

00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:43.406 A:middle
size by which the content grows

00:31:43.406 --> 00:31:44.176 A:middle
when it's in focus.

00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:47.066 A:middle
These are directional insets, so

00:31:47.626 --> 00:31:49.426 A:middle
you can even specify different

00:31:49.426 --> 00:31:50.776 A:middle
amount in all four directions.

00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:53.496 A:middle
You may recall that the

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:54.456 A:middle
CaptionButtonView is actually

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:54.916 A:middle
using this.

00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
When you're providing your own


00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
When you're providing your own

00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:03.396 A:middle
content to the TVLockupView, you

00:32:03.396 --> 00:32:05.166 A:middle
can take advantage of

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:07.186 A:middle
TVLockupViewComponent protocol.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:10.216 A:middle
Whenever TVLockupView state

00:32:10.216 --> 00:32:11.896 A:middle
changes, it will call

00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:13.066 A:middle
updateAppearance

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:15.736 A:middle
forLockupViewState method on all

00:32:15.736 --> 00:32:16.956 A:middle
of its subviews that implement

00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:17.096 A:middle
it.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:19.286 A:middle
This is your subviews

00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:21.026 A:middle
opportunity to update its

00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:22.936 A:middle
behavior, or customize the

00:32:23.476 --> 00:32:27.766 A:middle
appearance based on the state.

00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:30.186 A:middle
You can use TVLockupView to

00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:31.696 A:middle
create your own widget that

00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:33.076 A:middle
responds to focus interaction,

00:32:33.716 --> 00:32:35.986 A:middle
or further customize the four

00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:37.926 A:middle
special purpose subclasses we

00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:38.736 A:middle
just discussed.

00:32:39.476 --> 00:32:43.796 A:middle
So, that's TVLockupView and its

00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:44.686 A:middle
subclasses.

00:32:45.146 --> 00:32:47.256 A:middle
Finally, you may recall seeing

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:47.976 A:middle
something like this.

00:32:49.936 --> 00:32:52.316 A:middle
It's simple, but its simplicity

00:32:52.316 --> 00:32:53.966 A:middle
disguises just how difficult it

00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:57.606 A:middle
is to implement this screen.

00:32:57.786 --> 00:32:59.686 A:middle
TVUIKit makes it really easy to

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
do this, and that's with


00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
do this, and that's with

00:33:01.596 --> 00:33:03.256 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController.

00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:07.086 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController

00:33:07.326 --> 00:33:09.726 A:middle
manages a fullscreen view that

00:33:09.726 --> 00:33:12.476 A:middle
presents a title label, prompt

00:33:12.476 --> 00:33:16.166 A:middle
label, a digit view, and the

00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:16.986 A:middle
numeric keyboard.

00:33:17.596 --> 00:33:20.496 A:middle
Among the things you can

00:33:20.496 --> 00:33:21.236 A:middle
customize in a

00:33:21.236 --> 00:33:23.896 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController are

00:33:24.516 --> 00:33:26.746 A:middle
the number of digits, and

00:33:26.746 --> 00:33:29.426 A:middle
whether the entry is secure or

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:29.716 A:middle
not.

00:33:30.296 --> 00:33:33.596 A:middle
And, a completion handler that

00:33:33.596 --> 00:33:34.766 A:middle
allows you to process the

00:33:34.766 --> 00:33:35.466 A:middle
entered digits.

00:33:36.496 --> 00:33:37.986 A:middle
Instead of just talking about

00:33:37.986 --> 00:33:39.176 A:middle
it, I'd like to invite my

00:33:39.176 --> 00:33:40.386 A:middle
colleague Marshall over to give

00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:40.976 A:middle
us a demo.

00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:47.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:49.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Hans.

00:33:49.146 --> 00:33:50.556 A:middle
My name's Marshall, and today

00:33:50.556 --> 00:33:51.336 A:middle
we're going to take a look at

00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:51.926 A:middle
how you can use

00:33:51.966 --> 00:33:53.996 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController to

00:33:53.996 --> 00:33:56.056 A:middle
collect numerical data from your

00:33:56.056 --> 00:33:56.576 A:middle
users.

00:33:57.176 --> 00:33:58.426 A:middle
So, I have an app here that we

00:33:58.426 --> 00:33:59.816 A:middle
call Top Movies which allows me

00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:01.096 A:middle
to watch my favorite content,


00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:01.096 A:middle
to watch my favorite content,

00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:03.506 A:middle
but not all this content may be

00:34:03.506 --> 00:34:04.736 A:middle
appropriate for everybody in my

00:34:04.786 --> 00:34:06.006 A:middle
household, so what I'd like to

00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:07.846 A:middle
do is protect it behind a PIN

00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:09.596 A:middle
code, so I can restrict who's

00:34:09.596 --> 00:34:10.326 A:middle
allowed to watch it.

00:34:11.126 --> 00:34:12.116 A:middle
So, what we have here is a

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:13.706 A:middle
collection view, full of some

00:34:13.706 --> 00:34:15.085 A:middle
TVPosterViews that Hans

00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:15.676 A:middle
introduced.

00:34:17.016 --> 00:34:19.025 A:middle
So, if we dive in to our

00:34:19.076 --> 00:34:19.815 A:middle
collection views:

00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:21.286 A:middle
didSelectItemAt indexPath.

00:34:21.846 --> 00:34:23.646 A:middle
First thing we want to do is

00:34:23.646 --> 00:34:24.045 A:middle
vend a

00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:26.186 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController, and

00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:27.446 A:middle
send appropriate title and

00:34:27.446 --> 00:34:29.416 A:middle
prompt text, let the user know

00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:30.775 A:middle
they should enter a 5-digit

00:34:30.775 --> 00:34:31.266 A:middle
passcode.

00:34:32.085 --> 00:34:33.235 A:middle
We set the number of digits to

00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:35.896 A:middle
5, and we set the isSecure entry

00:34:35.896 --> 00:34:36.985 A:middle
to "true" since we are

00:34:36.985 --> 00:34:38.326 A:middle
collecting a passcode.

00:34:40.235 --> 00:34:41.835 A:middle
Next, we're going to implement

00:34:41.835 --> 00:34:43.295 A:middle
the entryCompletionHandler.

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.545 A:middle
This returns a string, once the

00:34:46.646 --> 00:34:48.136 A:middle
user has filled in the total

00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:49.696 A:middle
number of digits in the digit

00:34:49.696 --> 00:34:49.956 A:middle
view.

00:34:50.906 --> 00:34:52.416 A:middle
So, here for now, since I'm

00:34:52.416 --> 00:34:53.456 A:middle
working on the app, we're just

00:34:53.456 --> 00:34:54.286 A:middle
going to check to see if it's

00:34:54.286 --> 00:34:54.746 A:middle
all 1's.

00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.525 A:middle
If it is, we're going to dismiss

00:34:56.525 --> 00:34:57.456 A:middle
the view controller, and play

00:34:57.456 --> 00:34:58.046 A:middle
the content.

00:34:58.566 --> 00:34:59.756 A:middle
Otherwise, we're going to update

00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
the prompt text, let the user


00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
the prompt text, let the user

00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:02.296 A:middle
know that it was an invalid

00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:03.296 A:middle
passcode, and we're going to

00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:05.076 A:middle
call the clearEntry animated

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:05.486 A:middle
true.

00:35:05.866 --> 00:35:08.086 A:middle
What this will do is clear out

00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:09.576 A:middle
all the digits, and shake the

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:10.736 A:middle
digit view to let the user know

00:35:10.736 --> 00:35:11.586 A:middle
that something went wrong.

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:13.296 A:middle
And then, finally, we're going

00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.396 A:middle
to present the viewController.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:15.606 A:middle
And, since this is just a

00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:16.806 A:middle
viewController, we can use

00:35:16.806 --> 00:35:18.916 A:middle
custom presentation styles.

00:35:19.296 --> 00:35:20.306 A:middle
So here we're going to use the

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:22.396 A:middle
blurOverFullScreen, which was

00:35:22.396 --> 00:35:23.986 A:middle
introduced in tvOS last year.

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:26.576 A:middle
Let's run this and see how it

00:35:26.576 --> 00:35:26.846 A:middle
works.

00:35:26.846 --> 00:35:29.556 A:middle
So, I'm going to select my

00:35:29.556 --> 00:35:29.916 A:middle
movie.

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:31.506 A:middle
And, we see we get the

00:35:31.506 --> 00:35:33.096 A:middle
blurOverFullScreen animation,

00:35:33.096 --> 00:35:34.466 A:middle
and we get prompted to enter our

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:35.046 A:middle
passcode.

00:35:35.436 --> 00:35:36.786 A:middle
Now, we know that it's all 1's

00:35:36.816 --> 00:35:38.136 A:middle
right now, so let's see what

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.566 A:middle
happens if I enter all 2's.

00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:41.576 A:middle
We see that we get a nice shake

00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:42.886 A:middle
animation, and we update the

00:35:42.886 --> 00:35:43.346 A:middle
text.

00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:45.926 A:middle
Now, we go enter all 1's.

00:35:47.006 --> 00:35:47.916 A:middle
We know that's the correct

00:35:47.916 --> 00:35:49.166 A:middle
passcode, so we dismiss the

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.236 A:middle
viewController and we can play

00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:50.766 A:middle
our content.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:54.736 A:middle
Now, if the user wants to use--

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:56.476 A:middle
they most likely want to use

00:35:56.476 --> 00:35:57.626 A:middle
their own passcode, so what

00:35:57.626 --> 00:35:58.506 A:middle
we're going to do is we're going

00:35:58.506 --> 00:35:59.566 A:middle
to take this settings button

00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:00.846 A:middle
here, and we're going to allow


00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:00.846 A:middle
here, and we're going to allow

00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:02.056 A:middle
the user to set their own

00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:02.546 A:middle
passcode.

00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:04.216 A:middle
So, I've got my [inaudible]

00:36:04.306 --> 00:36:05.156 A:middle
action down here.

00:36:06.036 --> 00:36:07.996 A:middle
And, again, we're going to vend

00:36:07.996 --> 00:36:09.496 A:middle
a TVDigitEntryViewController,

00:36:09.996 --> 00:36:10.966 A:middle
and we're going to set the title

00:36:10.966 --> 00:36:12.546 A:middle
text to let them know that we're

00:36:12.816 --> 00:36:14.176 A:middle
collecting a passcode that will

00:36:14.296 --> 00:36:15.456 A:middle
restrict which content can be

00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:17.006 A:middle
watched, and again, set the

00:36:17.006 --> 00:36:18.116 A:middle
number of digits to 5.

00:36:19.446 --> 00:36:20.926 A:middle
Next, we're going to implement

00:36:21.336 --> 00:36:22.596 A:middle
the entryCompletionHandler

00:36:22.596 --> 00:36:22.886 A:middle
again.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:25.506 A:middle
Now, I have an extra variable up

00:36:25.506 --> 00:36:27.176 A:middle
here, a optional string called

00:36:27.176 --> 00:36:28.076 A:middle
passcodeToVerify.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.716 A:middle
What this is going to do, is

00:36:29.716 --> 00:36:32.066 A:middle
it's going to hold the passcode

00:36:32.066 --> 00:36:33.416 A:middle
the user enters the first time

00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:34.936 A:middle
so we can verify it to make sure

00:36:34.936 --> 00:36:36.126 A:middle
that they actually entered the

00:36:36.126 --> 00:36:36.876 A:middle
correct passcode.

00:36:37.526 --> 00:36:38.606 A:middle
So, we see that when our

00:36:38.606 --> 00:36:39.816 A:middle
completionHandler gets called,

00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:41.386 A:middle
we check to see if the

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:42.776 A:middle
passcodeToVerify is nil.

00:36:42.906 --> 00:36:44.056 A:middle
If it is, this is the first

00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:46.196 A:middle
time, so we're going to ask them

00:36:46.266 --> 00:36:48.376 A:middle
to verify their passcode, and

00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:49.086 A:middle
we're going to call the

00:36:49.086 --> 00:36:51.366 A:middle
clearEntry animated, except this

00:36:51.396 --> 00:36:52.086 A:middle
time false.

00:36:52.346 --> 00:36:53.086 A:middle
We don't want to shake it,

00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:53.886 A:middle
because they didn't do anything

00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:55.646 A:middle
wrong, but we want to clear it

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.606 A:middle
so they can enter it again.

00:36:57.266 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
Otherwise, if there is a value

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
stored in the passcodeToVerify,


00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
stored in the passcodeToVerify,

00:37:00.366 --> 00:37:01.606 A:middle
we know they are verifying it.

00:37:01.606 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
And, we check to make sure

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:03.116 A:middle
they're equal.

00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:05.126 A:middle
If they are, we save the new

00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:06.646 A:middle
passcode, and dismiss the

00:37:06.646 --> 00:37:07.236 A:middle
viewController.

00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:09.456 A:middle
Otherwise, we reset the prompt

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:10.726 A:middle
text back to what we originally

00:37:10.726 --> 00:37:13.096 A:middle
asked, clear the entry, and then

00:37:13.296 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
set the passcodeToVerify to nil

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:15.546 A:middle
so they can try again.

00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:17.336 A:middle
And, finally we present our

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:17.886 A:middle
viewController.

00:37:22.046 --> 00:37:22.976 A:middle
So, now we're going to go to

00:37:22.976 --> 00:37:23.326 A:middle
Settings.

00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:24.756 A:middle
It's going to ask us to please

00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:25.646 A:middle
set a passcode.

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:27.156 A:middle
Let's go ahead and set it all

00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:27.866 A:middle
1's first.

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:29.436 A:middle
Now it's asked us to verify.

00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:30.556 A:middle
But, this time I'm going to

00:37:30.556 --> 00:37:31.146 A:middle
enter all 2's.

00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:32.836 A:middle
Since we know that was

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:33.376 A:middle
incorrect.

00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:35.136 A:middle
So, now let's do it correctly

00:37:35.136 --> 00:37:35.526 A:middle
this time.

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:37.716 A:middle
We've got five 1's, we're going

00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:38.796 A:middle
to verify our PIN code.

00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:40.756 A:middle
And, we can save the PIN code so

00:37:40.756 --> 00:37:42.026 A:middle
the user can use it when they

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:42.336 A:middle
need to.

00:37:42.566 --> 00:37:44.226 A:middle
And, that's how you can

00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:44.626 A:middle
implement

00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:46.896 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController into

00:37:46.896 --> 00:37:47.546 A:middle
your application.

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:48.756 A:middle
I'd like to invite Hans back up

00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:48.976 A:middle
on stage.

00:37:49.516 --> 00:37:52.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:53.046 --> 00:37:53.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Marshall.

00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:56.586 A:middle
That was a great demo showing

00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:58.196 A:middle
just how easy it is to adopt a

00:37:58.196 --> 00:37:59.726 A:middle
common UI patterns, using

00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:00.446 A:middle
TVUIKit.


00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:00.446 A:middle
TVUIKit.

00:38:02.696 --> 00:38:05.176 A:middle
In addition, TVUIKit also has

00:38:05.226 --> 00:38:06.056 A:middle
built-in support for

00:38:06.056 --> 00:38:07.326 A:middle
localization, including

00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:08.506 A:middle
right-to-left language support,

00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:10.546 A:middle
and of course, accessibility.

00:38:11.566 --> 00:38:12.976 A:middle
TVUIKit is available in the

00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:14.206 A:middle
Developer Beta, so please

00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:15.066 A:middle
download and check out the

00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:15.396 A:middle
headers.

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:17.486 A:middle
And, as you use it in your app,

00:38:18.556 --> 00:38:19.736 A:middle
we think it will really save you

00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:21.066 A:middle
time and resources so you can

00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:22.856 A:middle
instead, focus on what makes

00:38:22.856 --> 00:38:23.816 A:middle
your app truly shine.

00:38:25.276 --> 00:38:27.006 A:middle
So, that's TVUIKit.

00:38:28.716 --> 00:38:30.816 A:middle
This afternoon we've just looked

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:32.996 A:middle
at a few areas where tvOS 12 can

00:38:32.996 --> 00:38:34.246 A:middle
improve your app's user

00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:35.726 A:middle
experience and performance.

00:38:37.466 --> 00:38:38.676 A:middle
We learned about Password

00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:40.326 A:middle
AutoFill, which makes it really

00:38:40.326 --> 00:38:42.316 A:middle
easy for your customers to sign

00:38:42.316 --> 00:38:42.886 A:middle
in to your app.

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.216 A:middle
And, it's especially more

00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:46.906 A:middle
helpful if they have strong

00:38:46.906 --> 00:38:47.356 A:middle
password.

00:38:47.936 --> 00:38:51.426 A:middle
We've also saw how we expanded

00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.726 A:middle
tvOS's focus engine to support

00:38:53.806 --> 00:38:55.996 A:middle
all apps, regardless of how they

00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:56.526 A:middle
are rendered.

00:38:57.516 --> 00:38:58.806 A:middle
This is truly game-changing.


00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:02.316 A:middle
And, finally we looked at

00:39:02.316 --> 00:39:04.796 A:middle
TVUIKit, which makes it really

00:39:04.796 --> 00:39:06.676 A:middle
easy to adopt common UI patterns

00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:07.286 A:middle
on tvOS.

00:39:08.016 --> 00:39:11.156 A:middle
We have a session page with all

00:39:11.156 --> 00:39:12.356 A:middle
of this information and more.

00:39:12.356 --> 00:39:14.076 A:middle
And, we'll be available at the

00:39:14.746 --> 00:39:17.096 A:middle
tvOS labs, and Safari WebKit

00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:18.866 A:middle
labs throughout the week.

00:39:19.516 --> 00:39:20.796 A:middle
Please drop by and say hello,

00:39:20.796 --> 00:39:21.686 A:middle
and bring your questions and

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:21.996 A:middle
code.

00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:23.596 A:middle
Thanks for joining us this

00:39:23.596 --> 00:39:24.126 A:middle
afternoon.

00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:26.156 A:middle
Have a wonderful WWDC.
