00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, and welcome to

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:27.826 A:middle
What's New in Managing Apple

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:28.336 A:middle
Devices.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.646 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I'm very

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
pleased to be here with all of

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:32.625 A:middle
you here in the hall this

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:33.906 A:middle
morning, as well as those of you

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:35.506 A:middle
watching this video now or in

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:36.086 A:middle
the future.

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:39.036 A:middle
I'd like to cover all the things

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:40.336 A:middle
that have changed in the past

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:42.036 A:middle
year, since we last did this at

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.796 A:middle
WWDC 2017.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.326 A:middle
But, before we dive into all of

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.996 A:middle
those details, I want to take a

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.846 A:middle
moment to take stock of how far

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.246 A:middle
we've come.

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:53.926 A:middle
This year, we are very proud to

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.656 A:middle
celebrate 40 years of Apple in

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:56.356 A:middle
education.

00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.576 A:middle
And, it's fascinating to see how

00:00:58.576 --> 00:00:59.516 A:middle
much has changed.


00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:01.906 A:middle
From the audacious goal of an

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.956 A:middle
Apple 2 in every school in 1978,

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:08.396 A:middle
to an iPad or MacBook in every

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:10.546 A:middle
student's hands in 2018.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.006 A:middle
But, it's even more important to

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.276 A:middle
consider how much has remained

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
the same over those tumultuous

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:16.626 A:middle
40 years.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.336 A:middle
Apple had a unique insight into

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.946 A:middle
how technology could inspire

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:23.086 A:middle
people and unleash their

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
creative genius.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.536 A:middle
And, we believed technology

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:27.646 A:middle
could help teachers deliver

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:28.896 A:middle
unique and personalized

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.366 A:middle
experiences to all of their

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.076 A:middle
students.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:33.236 A:middle
We have never stopped believing

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.926 A:middle
in this goal, and never stopped

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:36.586 A:middle
working hard to achieve it.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.756 A:middle
Over the years, we have created

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.896 A:middle
a number of tools to make it

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:42.346 A:middle
easier for schools to put Apple

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.936 A:middle
devices into the hands of each

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
of their students.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.446 A:middle
And, I want to highlight one of

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:47.996 A:middle
those now.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.246 A:middle
Classroom is now two years old,

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.966 A:middle
and teachers really appreciate

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.046 A:middle
the power it puts at their

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.596 A:middle
fingertips to accelerate

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.656 A:middle
teaching and learning without

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.036 A:middle
technology getting in the way.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.166 A:middle
But, we want to provide our


00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.166 A:middle
But, we want to provide our

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.536 A:middle
tools on whichever OS our

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.546 A:middle
customers choose.

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
So, we were excited to announce

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.596 A:middle
at our March education event,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.396 A:middle
that Classroom was coming to the

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:07.756 A:middle
Mac.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.186 A:middle
And, it looks like this.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.816 A:middle
I think Classroom looks

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:13.926 A:middle
fantastic on the Mac.

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.426 A:middle
It has the same great feature

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.236 A:middle
set already available on iPad,

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:18.846 A:middle
plus some surprises.

00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:21.126 A:middle
But, instead of describing those

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:23.016 A:middle
to you, I'd like to invite Curt

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.676 A:middle
and Raheel up to actually show

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.086 A:middle
them to you.

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:25.176 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.036 A:middle
Team's been working hard to

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.186 A:middle
bring the great Classroom

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.616 A:middle
experience to the Mac, and we're

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.616 A:middle
thrilled to share it with you

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:37.966 A:middle
today.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.056 A:middle
To get started, I can just go to

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:41.516 A:middle
Launchpad, and click on

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:41.976 A:middle
Classroom.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.606 A:middle
As you'd expect in a Mac app,

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.186 A:middle
all the actions in Classroom for

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:50.496 A:middle
Mac are available in the

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.896 A:middle
toolbar, from menus, and with

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.906 A:middle
keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:56.186 A:middle
For example, I can hit Command-T

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.856 A:middle
to bring up my teacher info.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.546 A:middle
Oh, that photo's a bit much.


00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.546 A:middle
Oh, that photo's a bit much.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.566 A:middle
Let's go with something a little

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.636 A:middle
more laid back.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:05.726 A:middle
That's better.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:11.046 A:middle
I can hit Shift-Command-N to

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:12.806 A:middle
bring up a new Class sheet.

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.456 A:middle
We have all the great icons and

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:15.646 A:middle
colors that teachers use in

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:16.706 A:middle
Classroom for iPad.

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.286 A:middle
I have enough Classes for this

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:19.946 A:middle
demo, so I just hit Escape to

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:20.646 A:middle
dismiss that.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.976 A:middle
In the Classes view, I can drag

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:24.946 A:middle
and drop to rearrange my

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:25.436 A:middle
Classes.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
And, I can just double-click to

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:29.426 A:middle
start a Class session.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.706 A:middle
In a Class session, we have all

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.006 A:middle
the actions that teachers expect

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.316 A:middle
from Classroom for iPad.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:36.426 A:middle
They're available in the

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:39.036 A:middle
toolbar, from the Actions menu,

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.456 A:middle
and of course, with keyboard

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.556 A:middle
And, because this is a Mac app,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.816 A:middle
and I'm demoing on a Mac, I can

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:47.226 A:middle
use QuickTime to show you what

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.496 A:middle
this looks like from a student's

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:49.096 A:middle
perspective.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.026 A:middle
So, now on your left, we have

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.666 A:middle
Classroom for Mac, and on the

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.646 A:middle
right, we have Raheel's student

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:57.006 A:middle
iPad.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.136 A:middle
Let's navigate the students to a


00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.136 A:middle
Let's navigate the students to a

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:01.986 A:middle
website.

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.136 A:middle
I hit Command-G to bring up the

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:04.946 A:middle
Navigate sheet.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.546 A:middle
Now, I could use my mouse to

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.246 A:middle
pick the site to go to here.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:09.816 A:middle
I could also use the arrow keys.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:11.966 A:middle
Let's open this great National

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
Geographic kids' site.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.766 A:middle
So, all my student iPads are

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.716 A:middle
taken to this site.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.046 A:middle
And, I can even click this link

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.076 A:middle
to go to the same site in Safari

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:22.656 A:middle
on my Mac.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.596 A:middle
Now, while I'm browsing the

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
site, I might find something

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.616 A:middle
else I want to share with my

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:28.046 A:middle
students, like this cool Monarch

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:28.956 A:middle
butterfly page.

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:32.766 A:middle
I can click the Share toolbar

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.576 A:middle
item, choose to Share via

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:37.276 A:middle
AirDrop, and in the list my

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.686 A:middle
class, and any manual groups

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:39.716 A:middle
I've created will show up.

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:40.976 A:middle
So, I can share this page.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.626 A:middle
Another thing that I love about

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.926 A:middle
having Classroom on the Mac, is

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:56.216 A:middle
that it gives me a great way to

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.666 A:middle
keep my students on task.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.116 A:middle
I can see what apps they're in

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
by looking at these icons next


00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
by looking at these icons next

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:01.516 A:middle
to their avatars.

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:03.536 A:middle
And, through these Smart Groups

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:05.646 A:middle
that show what students are in

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:07.106 A:middle
each app.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:08.766 A:middle
It looks like Raheel's getting

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
distracted.

00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:11.956 A:middle
Brooklyn and Ella are still in

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:13.706 A:middle
Safari, but it looks like

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.266 A:middle
Raheel's browsing the App Store.

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:16.756 A:middle
So, I can use another cool

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:17.796 A:middle
feature of Classroom.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.606 A:middle
If I double-click on Raheel's

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.296 A:middle
avatar, I can see his iPad

00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.806 A:middle
screen on my Mac.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.006 A:middle
And, while I'm looking at a

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.126 A:middle
student's screen, I can perform

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.916 A:middle
actions on just that student's

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:29.226 A:middle
iPad.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.226 A:middle
So, in the Actions menu, I can

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.516 A:middle
choose Open App, and then

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:35.326 A:middle
Safari, and click Open, to bring

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:35.976 A:middle
Raheel back on task.

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Students can share links and

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
files from their iPads to the

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:47.316 A:middle
teacher, too.

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:49.466 A:middle
For example, I can share an

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.726 A:middle
image from Photos, like this

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.856 A:middle
great bear picture I found.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.696 A:middle
All I have to do is tap the

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.426 A:middle
Share button, and then tap

00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
Doctor C in AirDrop to share.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When a student shares an item


00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When a student shares an item

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
with me, the Inbox button in my

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.696 A:middle
toolbar will light up to let me

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:05.856 A:middle
know that there's something new

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:06.166 A:middle
there.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.066 A:middle
And, I can click to see a list

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:08.936 A:middle
of shared items.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.706 A:middle
And, on the Mac, I can tear off

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.426 A:middle
this Inbox, and place it next to

00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:14.286 A:middle
my Classroom window.

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:15.206 A:middle
And, this is great, because I

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:16.366 A:middle
can get at the items that my

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:17.696 A:middle
students are sharing with me,

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.036 A:middle
while still keeping an eye on

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:19.936 A:middle
the class as a whole.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.706 A:middle
And, I can double-click to open

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:23.746 A:middle
any shared items.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:25.766 A:middle
Well, that's a great bear photo,

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:26.296 A:middle
Raheel.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:27.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I know, right?

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:28.826 A:middle
It's unbearably great.

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:28.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.326 A:middle
Besides Smart Groups, I can also

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:37.906 A:middle
create groups manually in

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:38.566 A:middle
Classroom.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
I'll hit Command-N to bring up

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:42.286 A:middle
the New Group sheet, enter a

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:45.416 A:middle
group name, and select the

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:46.426 A:middle
students to include.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.576 A:middle
Manual groups are a great way to

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:50.956 A:middle
get different groups of students

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:53.146 A:middle
started on different tasks.

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:55.896 A:middle
When I'm done with my class

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:58.136 A:middle
session, I can hit End Class.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.436 A:middle
That ends my session.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.396 A:middle
I'm presented with this great


00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.396 A:middle
I'm presented with this great

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:01.166 A:middle
Summary view.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:02.716 A:middle
I can see all the apps that my

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.556 A:middle
students used during class, and

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:06.246 A:middle
for each app, a timeline of when

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.336 A:middle
they were in that app.

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.996 A:middle
I also see all the shared items,

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
like the great bear photo.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:14.026 A:middle
And, for each student, I get a

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:15.796 A:middle
timeline of all the apps they

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:16.876 A:middle
were in, and when they were in

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
those apps.

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:19.856 A:middle
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.756 A:middle
We think with drag and drop,

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:24.386 A:middle
keyboard navigation, toolbar

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:26.546 A:middle
items, the menus and the tear

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.576 A:middle
off inbox, the teachers are

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:28.786 A:middle
going to love the power and

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:30.256 A:middle
convenience of having Classroom

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.106 A:middle
on their Macs.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
And, of course, any macOS Mojave

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.566 A:middle
app would not be complete

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:36.976 A:middle
without support for Dark Mode.

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:43.146 A:middle
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.626 A:middle
It's available in public beta

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.366 A:middle
now, and from the App Store this

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:46.726 A:middle
fall.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:47.356 A:middle
Thank you.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:47.976 A:middle

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:52.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, guys.

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:55.686 A:middle
Doesn't Classroom really look

00:07:55.686 --> 00:07:56.556 A:middle
great in Dark Mode?

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:57.806 A:middle
I think teachers are really

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:58.646 A:middle
going to appreciate having it

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.676 A:middle
here, on their Macs.


00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.096 A:middle
Now, while education has been

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:03.436 A:middle
part of Apple's DNA from the

00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:05.126 A:middle
very beginning of our company,

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:06.946 A:middle
over time we've broadened our

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
audience to include the

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
enterprise.

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:11.646 A:middle
And, in 2018 and beyond, we want

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:12.846 A:middle
to empower people in both

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:14.546 A:middle
schools and businesses around

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.346 A:middle
the world to manage all of their

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:18.676 A:middle
Apple devices, from iPad to

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:20.796 A:middle
iPhone to MacBook to Apple TV,

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.066 A:middle
as well as all of their apps,

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:23.856 A:middle
whether they're in the App

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:25.396 A:middle
Store, or custom enterprise

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:25.816 A:middle
apps.

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.756 A:middle
With the same technologies and

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:29.646 A:middle
tools running on whichever OS

00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:30.376 A:middle
they choose.

00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:32.846 A:middle
And, that's why today I'm going

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.796 A:middle
to organize the content, first

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:36.635 A:middle
covering all the developments

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:38.885 A:middle
organized by the common features

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.285 A:middle
available on all our OS's.

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:42.046 A:middle
And then, continue through

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:44.275 A:middle
capabilities specific to one or

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:45.026 A:middle
more OS.

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.216 A:middle
And, just to give you a little

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:48.606 A:middle
bit of a legend ahead of time,

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:50.376 A:middle
you'll see new badges up in the

00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:51.796 A:middle
upper right-hand corner on

00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:53.576 A:middle
slides where all of that content

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.126 A:middle
is new in our fall releases.

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.986 A:middle
There will also be specific

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:58.636 A:middle
version badges on some slides

00:08:58.666 --> 00:08:59.756 A:middle
for things that have already

00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.946 A:middle
shipped in one or more releases,


00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.946 A:middle
shipped in one or more releases,

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.296 A:middle
and if there's a slide that has

00:09:04.296 --> 00:09:06.076 A:middle
some with version badges, and

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.636 A:middle
some bullets without, everything

00:09:07.636 --> 00:09:09.166 A:middle
without a version badge is new

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:10.056 A:middle
in a fall release.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:12.156 A:middle
So, with that, let's get

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:12.676 A:middle
started.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:14.846 A:middle
The first thing is to get your

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:15.996 A:middle
devices enrolled for remote

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:16.546 A:middle
management.

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.646 A:middle
And, schools use Apple School

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:19.616 A:middle
Manager to do that.

00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:21.956 A:middle
Take advantage of the device

00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:23.526 A:middle
enrollment program to enroll all

00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:24.806 A:middle
of their devices with the

00:09:24.806 --> 00:09:25.986 A:middle
correct MDM server.

00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:27.766 A:middle
And, I'd like to bring you up to

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.486 A:middle
date on all the changes in Apple

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.826 A:middle
School Manager over the past

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:31.116 A:middle
year.

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:33.726 A:middle
First, I want to call out, is

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:35.386 A:middle
now every student-managed Apple

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:37.266 A:middle
ID comes with 200 gigabytes of

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:37.976 A:middle
iCloud storage.

[ Applause ]

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:40.466 A:middle
Definitely.

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:43.026 A:middle
Creating more great content,

00:09:43.026 --> 00:09:44.876 A:middle
presentations and documents.

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:46.686 A:middle
We've also made it much easier

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:47.836 A:middle
for schools to create and

00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:49.396 A:middle
distribute passwords for those

00:09:49.396 --> 00:09:50.596 A:middle
student accounts.

00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:53.406 A:middle
We've dramatically modernized

00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:54.946 A:middle
and streamlined the experience

00:09:54.946 --> 00:09:56.776 A:middle
of purchasing apps and books in

00:09:56.776 --> 00:09:59.136 A:middle
bulk, as well as managing those

00:09:59.136 --> 00:09:59.966 A:middle
licenses over time.


00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
Being able to transfer them from

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.426 A:middle
one content manager to another,

00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:05.806 A:middle
both within a location, and to

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.566 A:middle
another location, as your needs

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:08.096 A:middle
change.

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:10.816 A:middle
And then, finally, a big

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:12.916 A:middle
customer request was to enable

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.396 A:middle
you to set a default MDM server

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.746 A:middle
for a particular device type,

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:18.636 A:middle
making it very easy to manage

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:20.236 A:middle
all of your Macs with one MDM

00:10:20.236 --> 00:10:21.966 A:middle
server, and all of your iOS

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:23.096 A:middle
devices with another.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:26.456 A:middle
But, we didn't want to just make

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.136 A:middle
all this great experience

00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:29.856 A:middle
available to schools, we also

00:10:29.856 --> 00:10:30.566 A:middle
wanted to bring it to the

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:31.346 A:middle
enterprise.

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:32.816 A:middle
And so, I'm pleased to let you

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.156 A:middle
know that we have now created

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:35.636 A:middle
Apple Business Manager as well.

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:38.276 A:middle
It offers the same great

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:39.836 A:middle
features to manage accounts,

00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:42.426 A:middle
purchase apps and books, and

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:44.806 A:middle
manage device enrollment, with

00:10:44.806 --> 00:10:46.386 A:middle
one important caveat on the

00:10:46.386 --> 00:10:47.026 A:middle
accounts.

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:48.676 A:middle
Apple Business Manager allows

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:49.766 A:middle
you to create accounts for all

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.246 A:middle
of your administrators to manage

00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:53.236 A:middle
these other features, but it

00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:54.436 A:middle
doesn't not support creating

00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:55.716 A:middle
managed Apple ID's for all of

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:56.466 A:middle
your employees.

00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:59.116 A:middle
It does offer the same, great,

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.476 A:middle
integrated apps and books


00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.476 A:middle
integrated apps and books

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
purchasing experience, including

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:03.296 A:middle
the license management features,

00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:05.116 A:middle
and all of the new features for

00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:06.326 A:middle
managing device enrollment.

00:11:06.756 --> 00:11:08.716 A:middle
And, it should very familiar to

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:09.826 A:middle
anyone who's ever seen Apple

00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:10.496 A:middle
School Manager.

00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:13.616 A:middle
To allow you to create accounts

00:11:13.616 --> 00:11:14.856 A:middle
for your administrators,

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:18.396 A:middle
purchase and manage your apps

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.606 A:middle
and books licenses, and manage

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:23.326 A:middle
your MDM servers, including

00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:24.626 A:middle
default MDM type.

00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:27.336 A:middle
So, until this week, Apple

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:28.556 A:middle
Business Manager has been in a

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:29.246 A:middle
private beta.

00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:31.956 A:middle
But, I'm excited to let you know

00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:32.966 A:middle
if you haven't seen the

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:33.876 A:middle
announcement already, we

00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:34.776 A:middle
actually launched the United

00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:37.146 A:middle
States yesterday, and our global

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:38.456 A:middle
launch will be in two weeks, on

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:38.976 A:middle
June 20th.

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:42.296 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:43.686 A:middle
We're very excited about

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.586 A:middle
bringing all of this to, this

00:11:45.586 --> 00:11:47.376 A:middle
integrated experience to all of

00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:48.386 A:middle
our enterprise customers.

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:50.546 A:middle
So, where and when will all that

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:50.936 A:middle
happen?

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:53.906 A:middle
Well, today, Apple School

00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:55.416 A:middle
Manager is available in 34

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.576 A:middle
countries, and that's our global

00:11:57.576 --> 00:11:58.616 A:middle
launch in two weeks.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
But, we didn't stop there.


00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
But, we didn't stop there.

00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:02.406 A:middle
I'm very excited to announce

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
that in fact, this summer we're

00:12:03.816 --> 00:12:05.556 A:middle
also going to expand into 31

00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:06.936 A:middle
more countries around the world,

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:09.226 A:middle
bringing us to 65 with support

00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:10.726 A:middle
for Apple School Manager and now

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:11.786 A:middle
Apple Business Manager.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:14.206 A:middle
We're also adding book support

00:12:14.206 --> 00:12:16.116 A:middle
in Canada and Germany, which

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.616 A:middle
currently only support apps.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.796 A:middle
So, I know the map looks great.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:22.346 A:middle
You can kind of see where the

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.516 A:middle
expansion was, but I thought it

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:24.726 A:middle
would be much easier to actually

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:25.916 A:middle
see a list of countries, so you

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.456 A:middle
can see if your country will now

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.406 A:middle
have support for Apple School

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:30.376 A:middle
Manager and Apple Business

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:30.806 A:middle
Manager.

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.876 A:middle
And, one thing I noticed,

00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:33.636 A:middle
looking at this list of

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.406 A:middle
countries-- this is a World Cup

00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:36.766 A:middle
year-- that seven of these

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
countries actually have a team

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:40.086 A:middle
in the World Cup, unlike, sadly,

00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:42.236 A:middle
my country, United States, but

00:12:42.236 --> 00:12:43.496 A:middle
that means I'm in the market for

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.026 A:middle
a new team.

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:44.976 A:middle
So, go Iceland.

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:49.636 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
I wanted to tell you also about

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:52.596 A:middle
another expansion of one of our

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.096 A:middle
deployment program features.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.276 A:middle
You can add credit to your

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.206 A:middle
account via purchase order to

00:12:58.206 --> 00:12:59.396 A:middle
allow you then to purchase apps

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
and books later.


00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
and books later.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.576 A:middle
Purchasing from either Apple or

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.336 A:middle
a reseller.

00:13:04.136 --> 00:13:06.156 A:middle
And, we have just launched last

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
week in 10 new countries in

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:07.766 A:middle
Europe.

00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:09.436 A:middle
Again, here's the list.

00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:11.616 A:middle
I believe that doubles our

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.426 A:middle
access to this program as well.

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:15.346 A:middle
The next slide is an evergreen

00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:15.986 A:middle
topic.

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
Every year we add new Setup

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:18.726 A:middle
Assistant panes in one or more

00:13:18.726 --> 00:13:20.086 A:middle
of our OS's, and this year is no

00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:20.656 A:middle
exception.

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
And, we continue to want to

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.436 A:middle
enable organizations to

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.846 A:middle
configure the experience they

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.346 A:middle
provide to their users as they

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:27.616 A:middle
set up their devices.

00:13:28.436 --> 00:13:30.136 A:middle
So, in the spring's release, we

00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:31.876 A:middle
added a new privacy pane on all

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:32.726 A:middle
three OS's.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.666 A:middle
We also added a new iCloud

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:38.106 A:middle
storage pane for macOS.

00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:41.096 A:middle
And, two new panes for tvOS.

00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:44.596 A:middle
And, in iOS 12, there'll be new

00:13:44.596 --> 00:13:45.746 A:middle
panes configuring some of the

00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:47.196 A:middle
new features, some of which you

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:48.366 A:middle
heard about earlier this week.

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:49.976 A:middle
We want to continue to give you

00:13:49.976 --> 00:13:52.376 A:middle
that option to get your users

00:13:52.376 --> 00:13:53.526 A:middle
right to the desktop or home

00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.836 A:middle
screen as quickly as possible.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.746 A:middle
So, next, I'd like to cover two

00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:59.396 A:middle
updates for how MDM servers

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.746 A:middle
should handle both enrolling


00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.746 A:middle
should handle both enrolling

00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:02.516 A:middle
devices, as well as ongoing

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.476 A:middle
communication with each of those

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.716 A:middle
enrolled devices, starting with

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.496 A:middle
Apple Push Notification service.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.926 A:middle
So, if your MDM solution is

00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
still using the Legacy Binary

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:15.216 A:middle
Provider API, we definitely want

00:14:15.216 --> 00:14:16.676 A:middle
you to adopt the new, modern,

00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:18.896 A:middle
HTTP/2 API, which is far more

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:19.836 A:middle
capable and efficient.

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:21.856 A:middle
You can read all about it in the

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:23.486 A:middle
Communicating with APNs section

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.986 A:middle
of the Networking documentation.

00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:26.926 A:middle
And, since I brought up

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.306 A:middle
documentation, I wanted to take

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:30.736 A:middle
a moment here to calm the waters

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:33.226 A:middle
about the MDM and Profile

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:34.016 A:middle
documentation.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.146 A:middle
The documentation team is going

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.096 A:middle
through a publishing tools

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:39.176 A:middle
transition, and the disclaimer

00:14:39.176 --> 00:14:40.056 A:middle
that you might have noticed

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:41.076 A:middle
looking at the documentation

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:42.566 A:middle
this week is not an indication

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.096 A:middle
of any change in commitment to

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:45.106 A:middle
providing up-to-date

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:46.706 A:middle
documentation for all these

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:47.376 A:middle
technologies.

00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:49.536 A:middle
In fact, the only reason you saw

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:50.596 A:middle
that disclaimer is because we

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:52.456 A:middle
did update both guides on Monday

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:54.336 A:middle
for both the MDM protocol, and

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:55.486 A:middle
the Configuration Profile

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
reference to cover the changes

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.746 A:middle
I'm going to talk about today.


00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:02.866 A:middle
So, next topic is security.

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:03.906 A:middle
There'll be number of these

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:04.926 A:middle
throughout today's session.

00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
This is something that Bob

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:08.046 A:middle
talked about last year, that we

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.296 A:middle
were going to begin requiring

00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:10.916 A:middle
transport security this year.

00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:12.336 A:middle
And, in fact, we're going to do

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:14.446 A:middle
that in both iOS and macOS this

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:14.636 A:middle
year.

00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:17.466 A:middle
Your SCEP server should make

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:19.076 A:middle
sure to advertise its

00:15:19.076 --> 00:15:20.686 A:middle
capabilities, so that we know

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.296 A:middle
what the highest level of

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.506 A:middle
security you support, and don't

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.386 A:middle
have to fall back to a lower

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:27.286 A:middle
security encryption algorithm.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.966 A:middle
We stopped supporting DES last

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:31.206 A:middle
year.

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:33.146 A:middle
Definitely supports one of the

00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:35.326 A:middle
modern and much more secure

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.296 A:middle
algorithms.

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:39.106 A:middle
This year, I also wanted to give

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.406 A:middle
you a note on how you can verify

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.496 A:middle
that your server is ready for

00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:43.116 A:middle
this transition as we roll out

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:44.246 A:middle
the new versions of iOS and

00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:45.036 A:middle
macOS this year.

00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:48.796 A:middle
You can use NSCurl against each

00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:49.906 A:middle
of the URL's that your server

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:52.126 A:middle
supports, and verify that there

00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:53.156 A:middle
are no issues that the

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:54.466 A:middle
diagnostics find.

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
Now, let's turn to the new

00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.596 A:middle
management controls, commands

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.256 A:middle
and settings.


00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.256 A:middle
and settings.

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:01.686 A:middle
And, I'd like to start, again,

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:02.576 A:middle
with everything that's supported

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:04.066 A:middle
on two or more of our OS's.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.766 A:middle
You may have heard about some of

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
the new password features that

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:10.316 A:middle
we're introducing in this fall's

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.146 A:middle
iOS and macOS releases.

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:13.376 A:middle
And, of course, we want to

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:15.046 A:middle
enable you to manage them, via

00:16:15.046 --> 00:16:15.626 A:middle
profile.

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:17.896 A:middle
So, the great new automatic

00:16:17.896 --> 00:16:19.766 A:middle
strong passwords and AutoFill

00:16:19.766 --> 00:16:21.416 A:middle
features within Safari and

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:23.086 A:middle
within apps, we have a new

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.616 A:middle
password AutoFill restriction

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:27.366 A:middle
that also covers the existing

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.606 A:middle
Safari AutoFill feature and

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.176 A:middle
restriction.

00:16:30.346 --> 00:16:32.016 A:middle
We've also added a new password

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:34.066 A:middle
sharing restriction that covers

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:35.936 A:middle
all versions of the password

00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:37.476 A:middle
sharing feature, including the

00:16:37.476 --> 00:16:39.156 A:middle
previous WiFi password sharing.

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:40.936 A:middle
And, this restriction prevents

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.306 A:middle
you from sharing your password

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:42.996 A:middle
with others.

00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:45.376 A:middle
The last bullet on the slide,

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.856 A:middle
password proximity requests.

00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:49.106 A:middle
This restriction actually is

00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:50.536 A:middle
supported on tvOS as well,

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:52.646 A:middle
because this feature, or this

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:54.436 A:middle
restriction, prevents your

00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:56.016 A:middle
device asking others for their

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.566 A:middle
password.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.236 A:middle
And, if you didn't attend, you

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:01.306 A:middle
can check out the video of the


00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:01.306 A:middle
can check out the video of the

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:02.696 A:middle
password and AutoFill session

00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:03.736 A:middle
which occurred earlier this

00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:03.996 A:middle
week.

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:08.146 A:middle
We added a new restriction to

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
prevent users from modifying the

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.326 A:middle
Bluetooth restriction last fall.

00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:13.226 A:middle
And, in the spring, we added a

00:17:13.226 --> 00:17:14.336 A:middle
new MDM command to actually be

00:17:14.336 --> 00:17:15.866 A:middle
able to set the value of that

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:16.256 A:middle
setting.

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:17.896 A:middle
And, I'm even more pleased to

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:19.256 A:middle
let you know that it's not in

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.935 A:middle
Seed 1, but I saw the change go

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.776 A:middle
in yesterday, that this command

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.146 A:middle
will now work even if you have

00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:25.296 A:middle
that restriction in place.

00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:26.786 A:middle
And, we think this will be great

00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
for schools deploying Classroom,

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.366 A:middle
and in other situations where

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.336 A:middle
you want to make sure that

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:33.796 A:middle
Bluetooth is enabled, or

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:36.066 A:middle
disabled, as the case may be.

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.176 A:middle
Big customer request, we have

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:41.556 A:middle
enabled OAuth authentication for

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.856 A:middle
exchange accounts configured via

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:43.386 A:middle
profile.

00:17:44.156 --> 00:17:46.986 A:middle
That's in iOS 12, and in macOS

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:47.316 A:middle
Mojave.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.256 A:middle
And, a really big one, managed

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.056 A:middle
software updates that we brought

00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:53.566 A:middle
to both OS's this spring.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.246 A:middle
Thank you.

00:17:55.496 --> 00:17:56.706 A:middle
One person's excited about that.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.376 A:middle
And when I talked-- just because

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.656 A:middle
I'm excited about it, talk a


00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.656 A:middle
I'm excited about it, talk a

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.776 A:middle
little bit more in detail.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:02.936 A:middle
It consists of two different

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:04.786 A:middle
restrictions, one to enable the

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:06.286 A:middle
feature in the first place, to

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.436 A:middle
put the device so that it will

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:09.826 A:middle
delay when the user will see a

00:18:09.826 --> 00:18:11.216 A:middle
new update once we release it.

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.456 A:middle
And, an optional parameter that

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:14.436 A:middle
you can configure the delay

00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:16.816 A:middle
period from 1 day to up to 90

00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:17.276 A:middle
days.

00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.586 A:middle
If you don't specify that

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:22.426 A:middle
setting, it defaults to 30 days.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.466 A:middle
The scheduleOSUpdate command has

00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:26.746 A:middle
been supported on both platforms

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.696 A:middle
for a long time, and on macOS,

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:29.666 A:middle
it's always allowed you to

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
specify which update you

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.336 A:middle
actually wanted to install on

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:32.626 A:middle
that Mac.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:35.286 A:middle
But, in iOS 12-- I'm sorry, this

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.626 A:middle
spring, in iOS, we added the

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:39.106 A:middle
ability to specify a version

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.436 A:middle
number for just the iOS version

00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:42.456 A:middle
that you have tested with all

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.716 A:middle
the software important for your

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:45.006 A:middle
organization's devices.

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:47.356 A:middle
Wq also added a new Apple

00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.036 A:middle
software lookup service, so that

00:18:49.036 --> 00:18:50.976 A:middle
your MDM server can look up the

00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:52.536 A:middle
eligible versions for a

00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
particular device at a

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:54.576 A:middle
particular time.

00:18:55.096 --> 00:18:56.996 A:middle
And, we have documented that API

00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:58.806 A:middle
to look that up, so that your

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
MDM solution can populate the UI


00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
MDM solution can populate the UI

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:01.516 A:middle
presented to the admin.

00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:07.376 A:middle
It's in the MDM protocol guide.

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:09.126 A:middle
Alright. And, that brings us to

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:10.416 A:middle
the end of our common section.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.496 A:middle
And now, I'd like to talk about

00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:12.936 A:middle
some iOS-specific changes.

00:19:13.646 --> 00:19:14.806 A:middle
Again, starting with security.

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:17.206 A:middle
Now, some of you may have heard

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:18.986 A:middle
about this change that we

00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:21.356 A:middle
started to make in iOS 11.3, and

00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:24.056 A:middle
now it's back in 11.4.1, and iOS

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:24.376 A:middle
12.

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:25.836 A:middle
And, of course, we wanted to

00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:27.096 A:middle
make this manageable as well,

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:29.296 A:middle
beyond the switch that's in the

00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:30.916 A:middle
UI in iOS 12.

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:33.206 A:middle
So, there's a new restriction

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:34.616 A:middle
that allows you to control this

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:35.946 A:middle
feature, and whether USB

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.226 A:middle
accessories can still connect

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.496 A:middle
devices if they're locked.

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:41.316 A:middle
And, of course, Configurator

00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:42.996 A:middle
kind of relies on devices being

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:44.856 A:middle
able to connect via USB, so we

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:46.056 A:middle
have implemented a special

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:47.486 A:middle
behavior for those devices.

00:19:48.016 --> 00:19:49.216 A:middle
When Configurator prepares a

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.596 A:middle
device to supervise it, but not

00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:53.346 A:middle
enroll it in MDM, it will

00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:54.976 A:middle
automatically install a profile

00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:56.776 A:middle
that installs this restriction,

00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.566 A:middle
and allows those devices to

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
continue connecting to the Mac


00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
continue connecting to the Mac

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
running Configurator.

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:07.186 A:middle
Alright. Another topic which is

00:20:07.186 --> 00:20:08.326 A:middle
not new, we've talked about it

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.076 A:middle
for a number of years, last year

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:10.686 A:middle
Prodop [assumed spelling] told

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.266 A:middle
you that we are going to start

00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:14.226 A:middle
honoring the certain set of

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:15.746 A:middle
restrictions which were created

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:17.366 A:middle
before supervision existed, but

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.736 A:middle
really should only be honored on

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:19.876 A:middle
supervised devices.

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:21.886 A:middle
I want to make clear that these

00:20:21.886 --> 00:20:23.356 A:middle
restrictions are not going away.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.366 A:middle
They're still going to be

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:27.086 A:middle
usable, but they will only be

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.886 A:middle
honored on supervised devices.

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.156 A:middle
But, after hearing your

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.716 A:middle
feedback, we decided to delay

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.226 A:middle
one more year, and we'll make

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:36.516 A:middle
this change next year to help

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:37.926 A:middle
make a smooth transition.

00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:39.366 A:middle
And, we've also come up with an

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:40.786 A:middle
upgrade and migration policy

00:20:40.786 --> 00:20:41.746 A:middle
that we think will further

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:43.086 A:middle
smooth this transition.

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:46.236 A:middle
Essentially, if a device which

00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:48.446 A:middle
is not supervised has one or

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:49.716 A:middle
more of these restrictions in

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.576 A:middle
place, they will continue to be

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:53.896 A:middle
honored even after upgrading to

00:20:53.896 --> 00:20:55.966 A:middle
the iOS version that includes

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:57.666 A:middle
this change until they're wiped.

00:20:58.846 --> 00:20:59.876 A:middle
So, we'll remember, and we'll

00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
continue to allow you to use


00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
continue to allow you to use

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:02.366 A:middle
them until that device is wiped,

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.506 A:middle
allowing you to time your

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:05.476 A:middle
refresh more conveniently.

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.066 A:middle
Of course, any new device

00:21:07.216 --> 00:21:08.816 A:middle
configured, or if you wipe the

00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:09.696 A:middle
device and restore from a

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.076 A:middle
backup, they will get the new

00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:12.466 A:middle
behavior, where each of these

00:21:12.466 --> 00:21:14.086 A:middle
restrictions is only honored if

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.156 A:middle
the device is supervised.

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.456 A:middle
But, of course, if you're wiping

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:17.506 A:middle
a device, that's a great

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:18.536 A:middle
opportunity to go ahead and

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:19.586 A:middle
supervise it before you

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:20.786 A:middle
configure it again.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:24.596 A:middle
Just to refresh your memory,

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:26.816 A:middle
this is the list with one minor

00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:28.146 A:middle
change that we took advantage of

00:21:28.146 --> 00:21:28.966 A:middle
the fact that we're giving you

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:29.736 A:middle
one more year.

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:31.576 A:middle
That in fact, the three Siri

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:33.966 A:middle
restrictions should also only be

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:35.396 A:middle
honored on supervised devices,

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:37.986 A:middle
so this is the list, and we

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:39.436 A:middle
really mean it this time.

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:40.386 A:middle
We're going to do it next year.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.106 A:middle
Be prepared.

00:21:44.456 --> 00:21:46.326 A:middle
Alright. Managed Open In, it's a

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:48.726 A:middle
great feature, most-- more used

00:21:48.726 --> 00:21:50.416 A:middle
in enterprises, and we've made a

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
number of improvements, both in

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:55.746 A:middle
iOS 11.3, and iOS 12, to make

00:21:55.746 --> 00:21:56.866 A:middle
sure that the boundary we've

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.466 A:middle
established between managed apps

00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.796 A:middle
and unmanaged apps and sharing


00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.796 A:middle
and unmanaged apps and sharing

00:22:00.796 --> 00:22:03.086 A:middle
files and data between them is--

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.386 A:middle
behaves the way everyone would

00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:04.856 A:middle
expect.

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.346 A:middle
This included making the context

00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:09.076 A:middle
API respect the boundary in iOS

00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:09.856 A:middle
11.3.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:11.606 A:middle
Which of course was exactly what

00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:13.496 A:middle
many customers wanted, but we

00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:15.536 A:middle
know that that did have some

00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:17.196 A:middle
challenges for some

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:18.076 A:middle
organizations that were

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.616 A:middle
deploying in a specific way.

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:21.076 A:middle
And, I'd just like to make

00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:23.056 A:middle
clear, that if you are using

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:24.786 A:middle
Managed Open In, and want a

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
managed app to manage Contacts,

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:28.606 A:middle
you need to deploy that managed

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:29.816 A:middle
Contacts source as a managed

00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:30.356 A:middle
source.

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.666 A:middle
Alright. Now, let's turn to some

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.336 A:middle
of the new settings we've been

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:37.566 A:middle
adding in this year's software

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:38.036 A:middle
releases.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:39.616 A:middle
A bunch of things we added in

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:40.766 A:middle
iOS 11.3.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
I already mentioned allow USB

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:44.826 A:middle
accessories while device is

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:47.246 A:middle
locked restriction, completing

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.646 A:middle
our set of restrictions to allow

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:51.946 A:middle
you to get classroom behavior on

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:53.406 A:middle
a supervised device, even if

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:54.756 A:middle
it's a teacher-created class.

00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:57.276 A:middle
We'll talk a little bit more

00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:58.966 A:middle
about the remote pairing later

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
on in the tvOS section.


00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
on in the tvOS section.

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:02.156 A:middle
And, that last one I really

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:03.276 A:middle
wanted to mention, because this

00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:04.746 A:middle
is, again, another long-standing

00:23:04.746 --> 00:23:06.736 A:middle
customer request, that both

00:23:06.736 --> 00:23:07.906 A:middle
schools and businesses love the

00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.656 A:middle
Home Screen layout payload, but

00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:11.216 A:middle
they were also using WebClips.

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.956 A:middle
And now, in iOS 11.3, you can

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.496 A:middle
use WebClips in Home Screen

00:23:15.496 --> 00:23:15.976 A:middle
layout payload.

00:23:16.516 --> 00:23:19.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:22.706 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:23:22.876 --> 00:23:24.396 A:middle
Moving on to the changes in iOS

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:24.756 A:middle
12.

00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:26.486 A:middle
Added a couple of new

00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:28.196 A:middle
notification types to the

00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:29.236 A:middle
Notifications payload.

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:30.716 A:middle
And, another big customer

00:23:30.716 --> 00:23:33.296 A:middle
request, we had a lot of schools

00:23:33.296 --> 00:23:34.556 A:middle
in particular that wanted to

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:35.646 A:middle
prevent students from changing

00:23:35.646 --> 00:23:37.126 A:middle
the date and time, and there's a

00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:39.296 A:middle
new restriction that essentially

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.156 A:middle
turns on set date and time

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:43.116 A:middle
automatically on supervised

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:43.686 A:middle
devices.

00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:45.626 A:middle
Now, this feature will, of

00:23:45.626 --> 00:23:46.826 A:middle
course, only work if we can

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.296 A:middle
reach the time server, or a cell

00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
tower, or location services is

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:50.516 A:middle
enabled.

00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:52.826 A:middle
But, with that caveat, we think

00:23:52.826 --> 00:23:56.866 A:middle
this is going to meet the need.

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:57.876 A:middle
We've also made a lot of

00:23:57.876 --> 00:23:59.356 A:middle
improvements to how S/MIME is

00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.316 A:middle
managed for Mail and Exchange


00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.316 A:middle
managed for Mail and Exchange

00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:03.016 A:middle
accounts configured via profile.

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:06.156 A:middle
Giving users more flexibility

00:24:06.156 --> 00:24:07.496 A:middle
about when to sign and encrypt,

00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:09.566 A:middle
as well as an important changes

00:24:09.566 --> 00:24:11.406 A:middle
to allow them to update the

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.526 A:middle
certificates that they're using

00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:13.436 A:middle
for either feature.

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.216 A:middle
Even when their account has been

00:24:15.216 --> 00:24:16.316 A:middle
configured via profile.

00:24:17.626 --> 00:24:18.926 A:middle
We also took the opportunity to

00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:20.216 A:middle
rename a number of keys to

00:24:20.216 --> 00:24:21.326 A:middle
clarify the purpose.

00:24:21.366 --> 00:24:22.556 A:middle
Of course, the existing keys are

00:24:22.556 --> 00:24:23.626 A:middle
still honored for now.

00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:24.326 A:middle
But, please check the

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:25.956 A:middle
documentation and update your

00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:26.816 A:middle
implementations.

00:24:28.996 --> 00:24:30.436 A:middle
There's also a number of new

00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:32.596 A:middle
settings in the VPN payload for

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.636 A:middle
configuring IKEv2 connections,

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:37.796 A:middle
managing your DNS server

00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:38.316 A:middle
settings.

00:24:41.366 --> 00:24:44.396 A:middle
And, one important option that

00:24:44.396 --> 00:24:45.586 A:middle
we added to the Erase Device

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:46.086 A:middle
command.

00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:48.226 A:middle
Allows you to skip proximity set

00:24:48.226 --> 00:24:49.156 A:middle
up on your way back through

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.506 A:middle
Setup Assistant, further

00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:51.756 A:middle
configuring the device

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:53.076 A:middle
enrollment experience for an end

00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:53.486 A:middle
user.

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:55.226 A:middle
This is really important for

00:24:55.226 --> 00:24:57.716 A:middle
deployments for guests that are

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.056 A:middle
using your devices, and if

00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.256 A:middle
you're using device enrollment


00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.256 A:middle
you're using device enrollment

00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:02.306 A:middle
to provide a fresh experience

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.636 A:middle
for each new guest using that

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.486 A:middle
particular iPad or other device.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.216 A:middle
Thank you, Eric.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.406 A:middle
And, finally, due to macOS

00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:13.966 A:middle
server deprecation, we have

00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:15.336 A:middle
removed support for the macOS

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.956 A:middle
server account payload in iOS

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.336 A:middle
12.

00:25:17.786 --> 00:25:18.946 A:middle
If you're still using some of

00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:20.006 A:middle
those services as you're

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:21.506 A:middle
transitioning to a new solution,

00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:23.846 A:middle
you can replace those account

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:25.006 A:middle
configurations with normal

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:25.846 A:middle
account payloads.

00:25:26.586 --> 00:25:28.806 A:middle
Next, I'd like to give you a few

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:30.516 A:middle
tips on troubleshooting issues

00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:31.876 A:middle
with delivering and executing

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:33.296 A:middle
MDM commands on enrolled iOS

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:33.846 A:middle
devices.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.076 A:middle
There are a number of logging

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.396 A:middle
profiles which you can obtain at

00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:38.206 A:middle
the link at the bottom of the

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:38.716 A:middle
screen.

00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:40.496 A:middle
And, all of the URL's are going

00:25:40.496 --> 00:25:41.376 A:middle
to be available at the More

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:42.636 A:middle
Information link, which will be

00:25:42.636 --> 00:25:43.766 A:middle
at the end of the session, so

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:45.006 A:middle
you don't have to feverishly

00:25:45.006 --> 00:25:45.836 A:middle
copy those down.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:48.306 A:middle
Depending on what type of a

00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:49.346 A:middle
problem you're investigation,

00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:51.006 A:middle
you can install either both the

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:52.576 A:middle
MDM and/or the Apple Push

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:54.626 A:middle
Notification service profiles.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:56.236 A:middle
Once you've reproduced the

00:25:56.236 --> 00:25:57.866 A:middle
problem, you can get those logs

00:25:57.986 --> 00:25:59.106 A:middle
using Console or Apple

00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.026 A:middle
Configurator 2.


00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.026 A:middle
Configurator 2.

00:26:01.146 --> 00:26:02.696 A:middle
And then, look through the logs

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.386 A:middle
by process, depending on what

00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:05.096 A:middle
kind of a problem you're

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:05.796 A:middle
investigating.

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.666 A:middle
Whether you're looking at

00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:09.936 A:middle
communication, or connection

00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:10.656 A:middle
issues.

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:13.466 A:middle
Installing profiles or apps, or

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:14.616 A:middle
working with Shared iPad.

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:19.356 A:middle
Now, next I'd like to turn to

00:26:19.356 --> 00:26:20.586 A:middle
cover some topics that are a

00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:22.176 A:middle
particular interest to app

00:26:22.216 --> 00:26:23.306 A:middle
developers, who would like to

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:24.406 A:middle
sell their apps to schools and

00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:24.936 A:middle
businesses.

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:26.896 A:middle
Or, as I like to call it in

00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:28.096 A:middle
honor of the biggest fan of

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:30.336 A:middle
initial iPhone, say it with me,

00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:31.576 A:middle
the developers, developers,

00:26:31.576 --> 00:26:32.576 A:middle
developers section.

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:36.166 A:middle
I'll first cover some topics

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:37.556 A:middle
specific to education apps,

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
before continuing with some

00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.246 A:middle
topics for enterprise apps.

00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:43.536 A:middle
At our education event in

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.666 A:middle
Chicago in March, we announced a

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:46.986 A:middle
brand-new app for teachers

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:47.906 A:middle
called Schoolwork.

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:50.936 A:middle
Schoolwork allows teachers to

00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:52.456 A:middle
easily share content with their

00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:54.686 A:middle
students, leveraging the power

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:55.596 A:middle
of your apps.

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:58.766 A:middle
And then, they can view student

00:26:58.766 --> 00:26:59.956 A:middle
progress across all of their

00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.296 A:middle
work within those great apps.


00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.296 A:middle
work within those great apps.

00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.356 A:middle
Helping them to tailor

00:27:03.356 --> 00:27:04.806 A:middle
instruction to the needs of each

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:05.676 A:middle
of their students.

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.686 A:middle
And, also allowing them to

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.126 A:middle
collaborate and provide instant

00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:11.466 A:middle
feedback on what their students

00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:13.396 A:middle
are learning quickly, and where

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:14.206 A:middle
they might need a bit more

00:27:14.206 --> 00:27:14.666 A:middle
support.

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.956 A:middle
Now, all of this is based upon a

00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:19.316 A:middle
new framework called ClassKit.

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:21.806 A:middle
And, that's where you come in.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.726 A:middle
Apps which adopt ClassKit

00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:25.106 A:middle
integrate with Schoolwork in

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.466 A:middle
order to help teachers discover

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.726 A:middle
assignable activities within

00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:29.686 A:middle
your app, to take students

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:31.236 A:middle
directly to the right activity

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:32.316 A:middle
for what they're supposed to be

00:27:32.316 --> 00:27:32.946 A:middle
working on.

00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:34.616 A:middle
And, most importantly to

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:36.376 A:middle
securely and privately share

00:27:36.376 --> 00:27:38.136 A:middle
that progress data as they work

00:27:38.136 --> 00:27:39.726 A:middle
through those tasks with their

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.326 A:middle
teachers.

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:42.416 A:middle
Now, they had a session

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:43.486 A:middle
yesterday, and I encourage you

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:44.496 A:middle
to watch their video.

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.106 A:middle
Alright. While I have,

00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:48.456 A:middle
hopefully, your attention, I'll,

00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:49.766 A:middle
you know-- MDM developers are

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.546 A:middle
developers too, so this is

00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:52.556 A:middle
really more for them.

00:27:52.946 --> 00:27:54.116 A:middle
But, I wanted to make sure I

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.146 A:middle
kept their attention.

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:56.316 A:middle
They didn't start tuning me out.

00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.506 A:middle
So, the Roster API is how MDM

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.226 A:middle
servers can get class


00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.226 A:middle
servers can get class

00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
information from Apple School

00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:03.156 A:middle
Manager.

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.096 A:middle
And, we have had this class name

00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:06.916 A:middle
field for a while.

00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:08.346 A:middle
And, we want to encourage you to

00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:10.176 A:middle
use that as a display name in

00:28:10.176 --> 00:28:12.036 A:middle
your MDM console, as well as

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:13.526 A:middle
what you pass along to Classroom

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:15.096 A:middle
via the education payload, the

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:16.456 A:middle
configure managed classes.

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:18.146 A:middle
This is because Schoolwork is

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:19.656 A:middle
using that field, and we'd like

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:20.686 A:middle
to achieve a consistent

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:21.986 A:middle
experience for teachers using

00:28:21.986 --> 00:28:22.676 A:middle
both apps.

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:24.516 A:middle
The reason you might not be

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:26.086 A:middle
already doing this, is because

00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:27.916 A:middle
of class name's history.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:31.056 A:middle
Before January, it was there in

00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:32.326 A:middle
the API, but we actually didn't

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:33.006 A:middle
return a value.

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:35.926 A:middle
In January, we began returning a

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.236 A:middle
value that was derived using

00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:39.006 A:middle
logic in Apple School Manager.

00:28:39.606 --> 00:28:41.976 A:middle
But, this month, we're going to

00:28:41.976 --> 00:28:43.296 A:middle
start allowing administrators to

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:45.036 A:middle
configure that name based on how

00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:46.756 A:middle
the school names their classes,

00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:47.956 A:middle
and what the teacher will expect

00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:49.436 A:middle
right within Apple School

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:49.876 A:middle
Manager.

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.656 A:middle
So, again, if you're not

00:28:51.656 --> 00:28:52.756 A:middle
currently using that to

00:28:52.756 --> 00:28:54.136 A:middle
configure the education payload

00:28:54.136 --> 00:28:56.586 A:middle
for Classroom, please start, so

00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:57.706 A:middle
we can achieve that great

00:28:57.706 --> 00:28:58.806 A:middle
experience for teachers.

00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
Want to, again, remind you about


00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
Want to, again, remind you about

00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:04.596 A:middle
shared iPad.

00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:06.486 A:middle
If you want your app to be used

00:29:06.486 --> 00:29:08.796 A:middle
in Shared iPad, need to make

00:29:08.796 --> 00:29:10.226 A:middle
sure that it doesn't depend on

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.756 A:middle
any data being available locally

00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:12.616 A:middle
on a new device.

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:14.046 A:middle
When a student moves, and signs

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
into a new Shared iPad.

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:18.116 A:middle
Persist all of the app data to

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:19.376 A:middle
the cloud, whether that's our

00:29:19.376 --> 00:29:20.396 A:middle
cloud, or your cloud.

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:22.366 A:middle
And, while we'd, of course,

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.706 A:middle
prefer that you test your app on

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.326 A:middle
a real Shared iPad, you can

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:27.886 A:middle
simulate this by deleting all

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.756 A:middle
the local data, and then making

00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:30.836 A:middle
sure that your app still works

00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:31.076 A:middle
well.

00:29:33.876 --> 00:29:35.376 A:middle
Also like to encourage you to

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.336 A:middle
adopt managed app configuration.

00:29:37.616 --> 00:29:38.276 A:middle
There are thousands of

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.136 A:middle
developers who have, and have

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.096 A:middle
created a number of shared

00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:43.076 A:middle
schemas that can make it-- your

00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:44.306 A:middle
app much more friendly to

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.176 A:middle
education and enterprise, by

00:29:46.176 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
enabling them to create a

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.956 A:middle
customized experience for their

00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.536 A:middle
employees or students, to

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.356 A:middle
customize the look of the app,

00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.706 A:middle
or to prepare some custom data

00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:58.176 A:middle
to warm up the app so they get

00:29:58.176 --> 00:29:59.516 A:middle
the right experience at first

00:29:59.516 --> 00:29:59.936 A:middle
launch.


00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:04.206 A:middle
Here's the URL for the site to

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:04.956 A:middle
learn all about it.

00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:06.946 A:middle
Again, that will be available on

00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:08.536 A:middle
the More Information page later

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:08.816 A:middle
on.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.146 A:middle
We also have a number of great

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:13.456 A:middle
enterprise partners, who've

00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:16.216 A:middle
provided SDK's to make the power

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.666 A:middle
of their services available to

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:18.426 A:middle
your apps.

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:21.606 A:middle
From IBM's Watson to allow you

00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.326 A:middle
to do machine-learning models,

00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:26.746 A:middle
and we have great pages on our

00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:28.266 A:middle
developer.apple.com website.

00:30:28.266 --> 00:30:29.206 A:middle
They're really hard to figure

00:30:29.206 --> 00:30:30.716 A:middle
out, because they're slash and

00:30:30.716 --> 00:30:31.546 A:middle
then the company name.

00:30:31.626 --> 00:30:33.246 A:middle
But, I encourage you to check

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.366 A:middle
those out, and see what you can

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:35.356 A:middle
do within your apps.

00:30:35.896 --> 00:30:39.626 A:middle
And, finally if your app depends

00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:41.636 A:middle
on network performance, for some

00:30:41.636 --> 00:30:42.996 A:middle
time now, we've enabled you to

00:30:42.996 --> 00:30:45.396 A:middle
configure that with profiles for

00:30:45.396 --> 00:30:46.956 A:middle
enterprise apps and MDM

00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:47.586 A:middle
solutions.

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.606 A:middle
But, this year we've added a

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.226 A:middle
number of new quality of service

00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:52.486 A:middle
keys to allow you to fine-tune

00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:53.276 A:middle
it even further.

00:30:54.506 --> 00:30:55.816 A:middle
Encourage you to check out the

00:30:55.886 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
networking session, if your app

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.806 A:middle
is sensitive to network

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:00.846 A:middle
performance, to find out how you


00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:00.846 A:middle
performance, to find out how you

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
can achieve the best performance

00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:02.876 A:middle
on our platforms.

00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:05.506 A:middle
And, that brings us to the end

00:31:05.506 --> 00:31:06.826 A:middle
of our iOS-specific section.

00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:09.766 A:middle
So, following the pattern

00:31:09.766 --> 00:31:10.886 A:middle
established by this week's

00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:12.416 A:middle
keynote, let's turn next to

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:12.726 A:middle
tvOS.

00:31:13.836 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
Now, with tvOS, we, over the

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.296 A:middle
past number of years and

00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.526 A:middle
releases have been playing a

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:19.446 A:middle
little bit of catch up and

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:20.326 A:middle
adding some of the great

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:21.766 A:middle
features for device management

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.416 A:middle
that we had previously had for

00:31:23.516 --> 00:31:24.466 A:middle
iOS and macOS.

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.256 A:middle
And, I'm very pleased to let you

00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:27.376 A:middle
know that we continued to do

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:28.016 A:middle
that this year.

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:30.696 A:middle
This spring, adding the ability

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:31.806 A:middle
to configure content

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.116 A:middle
restrictions, just like you can

00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:34.366 A:middle
on iOS and macOS.

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:38.266 A:middle
And, enabling you to lock down

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:40.396 A:middle
which app, or which devices, can

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:41.916 A:middle
use the Remote app to manage a

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:43.036 A:middle
particular Apple TV.

00:31:43.446 --> 00:31:44.616 A:middle
This is great in the classroom,

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:46.066 A:middle
so that the teacher can just

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:47.496 A:middle
have the Remote app on her

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:49.886 A:middle
phone, and you cannot need a

00:31:49.886 --> 00:31:51.076 A:middle
physical remote in the

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:51.616 A:middle
classroom.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.946 A:middle
No student would ever get up to

00:31:53.946 --> 00:31:54.956 A:middle
no good with one of those.

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.186 A:middle
And, perhaps, even more

00:31:58.186 --> 00:31:59.746 A:middle
important, some great key

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
features of the device


00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
features of the device

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
management experience.

00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:02.976 A:middle
Being able to install App Store

00:32:02.976 --> 00:32:04.236 A:middle
apps on Apple TV.

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:05.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:06.516 --> 00:32:08.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:11.126 A:middle
And, being able to update to the

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:13.036 A:middle
latest version of tvOS via MDM

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:14.806 A:middle
command, just like another Apple

00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:14.976 A:middle
device.

00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:17.061 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:17.486 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:20.226 A:middle
And, we think that combining

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:21.576 A:middle
these new features with some of

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:23.466 A:middle
the features that we've added

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:25.556 A:middle
over the past few releases, you

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.856 A:middle
can do some amazing things with

00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
Apple TV, on its own, and in

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.716 A:middle
combination with other Apple

00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:30.296 A:middle
devices.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:31.906 A:middle
Provide new experiences to your

00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:32.396 A:middle
guests.

00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:34.156 A:middle
So, to illustrate the

00:32:34.266 --> 00:32:35.956 A:middle
possibilities, I'd like to

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:37.336 A:middle
welcome you to the entirely

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:38.996 A:middle
fictional Hotel Cupertino.

00:32:39.926 --> 00:32:40.936 A:middle
Such a lovely place.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:43.616 A:middle
Where each enrolled Apple TV is

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.286 A:middle
programmed to receive commands

00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:46.626 A:middle
from the hotel's MDM server.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.036 A:middle
For example, including updating

00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:49.976 A:middle
to the latest version of tvOS.

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:55.126 A:middle
And, installing a custom

00:32:55.126 --> 00:32:56.276 A:middle
enterprise app to allow your

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:57.116 A:middle
guests to manage their

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:59.366 A:middle
experience, including ordering

00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:01.136 A:middle
of room service, when they get a


00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:01.136 A:middle
of room service, when they get a

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:02.526 A:middle
hankering for pink champagne on

00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:04.406 A:middle
ice, or informing them about

00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:05.706 A:middle
options for exploring the area.

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:08.906 A:middle
You can also provide your guests

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:09.706 A:middle
with great entertainment

00:33:09.706 --> 00:33:11.386 A:middle
options, when they're actually

00:33:11.386 --> 00:33:12.846 A:middle
spending time in your room, by

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.016 A:middle
installing App Store apps.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.976 A:middle
And, this is the time when I

00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:18.826 A:middle
would love to share a clip of my

00:33:18.826 --> 00:33:20.016 A:middle
favorite show, Game of Thrones,

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.166 A:middle
with you, but we don't have time

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.086 A:middle
for that right now.

00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:23.646 A:middle
So, assuming your guests

00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:25.246 A:middle
actually ever leave the room,

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:27.296 A:middle
and take some photos, they can

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.526 A:middle
of course, use AirPlay to share

00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:31.466 A:middle
those photos, and display them

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:32.936 A:middle
on the big screen in the room

00:33:32.936 --> 00:33:33.806 A:middle
you've provided to them.

00:33:34.676 --> 00:33:36.996 A:middle
So, this is just one example of

00:33:36.996 --> 00:33:38.426 A:middle
what can now be done with Apple

00:33:38.426 --> 00:33:40.056 A:middle
TV by managing it remotely.

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.356 A:middle
But, of course, there are many

00:33:41.356 --> 00:33:42.556 A:middle
other types of businesses that

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:43.626 A:middle
could take advantage of these

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.396 A:middle
capabilities to provide amazing

00:33:45.396 --> 00:33:46.896 A:middle
experiences to their guests,

00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:48.356 A:middle
including integration with the

00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:49.706 A:middle
Apple devices they're already

00:33:49.706 --> 00:33:50.426 A:middle
bringing with them.

00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:52.096 A:middle
We look forward to seeing the

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.016 A:middle
fruits of your creativity, even

00:33:54.016 --> 00:33:55.246 A:middle
if it doesn't involve dragons.

00:33:56.756 --> 00:33:58.226 A:middle
So, that brings us to the end of

00:33:58.226 --> 00:33:59.336 A:middle
our tvOS section.

00:33:59.636 --> 00:34:02.186 A:middle
And, last but not least, macOS,


00:33:59.636 --> 00:34:02.186 A:middle
And, last but not least, macOS,

00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:03.536 A:middle
just like in the keynote.

00:34:03.936 --> 00:34:05.276 A:middle
So, let's start right at the

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.026 A:middle
beginning, installing macOS.

00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:10.025 A:middle
And, I'd like to make everyone

00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:11.476 A:middle
aware of the great new command

00:34:11.536 --> 00:34:12.866 A:middle
added to the macOS installer

00:34:12.866 --> 00:34:13.896 A:middle
this spring, called

00:34:13.896 --> 00:34:14.936 A:middle
startosinstall.

00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:17.726 A:middle
If you're installing from and to

00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:18.926 A:middle
your computer startup disk, you

00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:19.835 A:middle
can use this command.

00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:22.406 A:middle
And, it supports all the latest

00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:23.106 A:middle
Mac hardware.

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:24.966 A:middle
It also includes some great

00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:25.906 A:middle
features that allow you to

00:34:25.906 --> 00:34:27.346 A:middle
install packages on top of the

00:34:27.346 --> 00:34:28.716 A:middle
freshly installed macOS.

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:31.156 A:middle
And, an option to start fresh,

00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.005 A:middle
and erase that partition before

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:34.646 A:middle
you install the new version of

00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:35.106 A:middle
macOS.

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:38.386 A:middle
Of course, once you've installed

00:34:38.386 --> 00:34:39.565 A:middle
the OS, you want to get enrolled

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:40.496 A:middle
for remote management.

00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:42.386 A:middle
And, we received some feedback

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.246 A:middle
from some of our enterprise

00:34:43.246 --> 00:34:45.216 A:middle
partners in particular, that

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:46.696 A:middle
they really prefer the iOS

00:34:46.696 --> 00:34:47.746 A:middle
experience, and felt it was more

00:34:47.746 --> 00:34:48.456 A:middle
user friendly.

00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:49.446 A:middle
So, we're going to take that

00:34:49.446 --> 00:34:52.235 A:middle
feedback, and simplify, and make

00:34:52.386 --> 00:34:54.096 A:middle
the macOS MDM enrollment

00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:55.596 A:middle
experience match iOS.

00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:57.566 A:middle
It's not in Seed 1, but you will

00:34:57.566 --> 00:34:58.976 A:middle
see it soon in macOS Mojave.


00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:04.366 A:middle
I told you there were more

00:35:04.366 --> 00:35:05.176 A:middle
security topics.

00:35:05.276 --> 00:35:05.986 A:middle
Here's another one.

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:08.186 A:middle
We want to strongly encourage

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:09.386 A:middle
our MDM partners to take

00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:10.896 A:middle
advantage of this new capability

00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:13.296 A:middle
to make enterprise app manifest

00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.486 A:middle
delivery more secure.

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.136 A:middle
The transition is easy because

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:18.296 A:middle
we're continuing to support the

00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:20.106 A:middle
existing installApplication MDM

00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:21.396 A:middle
command to install enterprise

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.766 A:middle
apps, but we really want you to

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:24.886 A:middle
switch to one of the new methods

00:35:24.886 --> 00:35:25.786 A:middle
using the new

00:35:25.786 --> 00:35:27.466 A:middle
installEnterpriseApplication

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.106 A:middle
command as soon as possible.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.036 A:middle
There're two options.

00:35:31.246 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
You can either specify the

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.556 A:middle
manifest right within the

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:34.536 A:middle
command, inline.

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:37.496 A:middle
Or, you can specify certs that

00:35:37.496 --> 00:35:39.056 A:middle
we'll use later to pin our

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:41.146 A:middle
request to fetch the manifest.

00:35:43.396 --> 00:35:45.526 A:middle
Please read up about this, and

00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:47.496 A:middle
make the switch as soon as you

00:35:49.676 --> 00:35:49.786 A:middle
can.

00:35:50.006 --> 00:35:50.936 A:middle
Now, this is not actually a

00:35:50.936 --> 00:35:52.706 A:middle
change so much, because none of

00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:54.446 A:middle
these six payloads ever worked

00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:56.146 A:middle
to install in a system profile.

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:57.636 A:middle
But-- because they only make

00:35:57.636 --> 00:35:58.916 A:middle
sense in a user context.

00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
But, next year, we're going to


00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
But, next year, we're going to

00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:02.546 A:middle
start treating installing any of

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:03.596 A:middle
these payloads in a system

00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:05.106 A:middle
profile as a hard failure.

00:36:05.466 --> 00:36:06.916 A:middle
So, you have some time to

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:07.926 A:middle
prepare for that, and make sure

00:36:07.926 --> 00:36:10.556 A:middle
you're not already doing that.

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:12.086 A:middle
Now, let's talk about some of

00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.186 A:middle
the new things we've added in

00:36:14.186 --> 00:36:15.516 A:middle
this year's macOS releases.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:17.886 A:middle
Big customer request, you can

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.916 A:middle
now mark generated private keys

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.376 A:middle
as not exportable, so the user

00:36:21.376 --> 00:36:22.556 A:middle
can't get access to them on

00:36:22.556 --> 00:36:22.816 A:middle
their Mac.

00:36:24.436 --> 00:36:25.876 A:middle
We added content caching last

00:36:25.876 --> 00:36:27.676 A:middle
fall in macOS High Sierra.

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:28.976 A:middle
And now, you can configure it

00:36:28.976 --> 00:36:29.666 A:middle
via profile.

00:36:30.556 --> 00:36:31.726 A:middle
And, we've added a number of new

00:36:31.726 --> 00:36:33.176 A:middle
controls for managing how smart

00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:34.596 A:middle
cards are used on your

00:36:34.596 --> 00:36:35.606 A:middle
organization's Macs.

00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:35.836 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:36.046 --> 00:36:36.926 A:middle
Smart cards.

00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
Last fall, we introduced a new

00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:46.696 A:middle
concept for enrollments on Macs

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:48.226 A:middle
called user-approved MDM.

00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:51.856 A:middle
And, this is to protect features

00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:53.056 A:middle
that should really only be

00:36:53.056 --> 00:36:53.876 A:middle
available on an

00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:55.646 A:middle
organization-owned Mac, and be

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.566 A:middle
tied to affirmative consent from

00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:59.426 A:middle
a user or an admin, and not

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
configured via rogue script.


00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
configured via rogue script.

00:37:02.296 --> 00:37:04.156 A:middle
The first example was the kernel

00:37:04.156 --> 00:37:05.366 A:middle
extension permissions.

00:37:05.436 --> 00:37:06.846 A:middle
And, we introduced this in

00:37:06.846 --> 00:37:09.426 A:middle
10.13.2, although user-approved

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:11.016 A:middle
MDM enrollments was not actually

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:13.176 A:middle
required until 10.13.4.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:15.796 A:middle
There will be more security

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:17.296 A:middle
features that will fall into

00:37:17.296 --> 00:37:17.986 A:middle
this group.

00:37:18.316 --> 00:37:19.456 A:middle
So, this is something that's

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:21.076 A:middle
going to be with us, and in

00:37:21.076 --> 00:37:22.226 A:middle
fact, next thing I want to talk

00:37:22.226 --> 00:37:23.316 A:middle
about also requires

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.156 A:middle
user-approved MDM.

00:37:24.156 --> 00:37:26.386 A:middle
And, that's the additional

00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:28.696 A:middle
support we made for testing apps

00:37:28.736 --> 00:37:30.446 A:middle
for high stakes testing apps on

00:37:30.446 --> 00:37:32.256 A:middle
the Mac, so they can achieve the

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:33.406 A:middle
controlled environment that they

00:37:33.406 --> 00:37:33.936 A:middle
require.

00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:37.086 A:middle
That support requires both an

00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.506 A:middle
entitlement, as well as a Mac

00:37:39.506 --> 00:37:40.956 A:middle
which has a user-approved

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:41.396 A:middle
enrollment.

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:46.076 A:middle
And, just like for iOS and tvOS,

00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:47.116 A:middle
I'd like to give you some tips

00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:48.626 A:middle
on troubleshooting issues with

00:37:48.626 --> 00:37:50.116 A:middle
communicating with enrolled

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:50.786 A:middle
devices.

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:53.296 A:middle
Similarly, you can install the

00:37:53.296 --> 00:37:54.846 A:middle
right logging profile for a

00:37:54.846 --> 00:37:56.126 A:middle
managed client, or again, Apple

00:37:56.126 --> 00:37:57.456 A:middle
Push Notification service.

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.826 A:middle
Get the logs using Console, and


00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.826 A:middle
Get the logs using Console, and

00:38:01.016 --> 00:38:01.996 A:middle
it's a lot simpler-- you can

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:02.956 A:middle
just filter for the Managed

00:38:02.956 --> 00:38:04.146 A:middle
Client process on the Mac.

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:05.956 A:middle
But, I also wanted to highlight

00:38:05.956 --> 00:38:07.416 A:middle
the profile's command line tool.

00:38:07.486 --> 00:38:08.726 A:middle
It's a Mac, we're got Terminal.

00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:10.436 A:middle
You can, of course, use it to

00:38:10.436 --> 00:38:12.686 A:middle
install and remove profiles, but

00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:14.076 A:middle
it also has some great features

00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:16.656 A:middle
for verifying your deployment.

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:18.936 A:middle
The first we added this spring,

00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:21.486 A:middle
allows you to verify whether the

00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:22.936 A:middle
enrollment is user-approved,

00:38:23.256 --> 00:38:24.756 A:middle
with the profile status command.

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.356 A:middle
And, new in macOS Mojave,

00:38:27.956 --> 00:38:29.536 A:middle
there's a validate command that

00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:32.386 A:middle
allows you to confirm, or tells

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:34.886 A:middle
you any differences between the

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.536 A:middle
device enrollment profile in the

00:38:36.536 --> 00:38:38.046 A:middle
cloud, and what's actually

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.256 A:middle
configured on the device at that

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:39.626 A:middle
moment.

00:38:39.946 --> 00:38:40.816 A:middle
So that you can more easily

00:38:40.816 --> 00:38:43.296 A:middle
detect when your change that you

00:38:43.466 --> 00:38:44.526 A:middle
know you've already made in the

00:38:44.526 --> 00:38:46.566 A:middle
cloud hasn't been reflected on

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.296 A:middle
the Mac yet, or the device has

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:49.326 A:middle
become unconfigured.

00:38:49.926 --> 00:38:52.076 A:middle
So, that brings us to the end of

00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.186 A:middle
our content for today.

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:54.716 A:middle
And, I'd like to quickly sum up

00:38:55.026 --> 00:38:56.226 A:middle
some of the takeaways for the

00:38:56.226 --> 00:38:57.346 A:middle
different groups, and different

00:38:57.346 --> 00:38:58.316 A:middle
audiences for this talk.

00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:00.836 A:middle
Administrators, we hope you love


00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:00.836 A:middle
Administrators, we hope you love

00:39:00.836 --> 00:39:03.316 A:middle
having access in more places for

00:39:03.316 --> 00:39:04.616 A:middle
Apple School Manager, and now

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.316 A:middle
Apple Business Manager to manage

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:07.586 A:middle
all of your organization's

00:39:07.586 --> 00:39:09.836 A:middle
accounts, devices, and apps and

00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:10.316 A:middle
books.

00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:13.136 A:middle
Take advantage of all those new

00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:14.396 A:middle
device management capabilities

00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:15.436 A:middle
that we've talked about today.

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:17.316 A:middle
And, prepare for the security

00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:18.416 A:middle
changes that will impact your

00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:19.086 A:middle
deployments.

00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:22.606 A:middle
For MDM developers, of course,

00:39:22.606 --> 00:39:24.226 A:middle
we need you to support all these

00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:25.406 A:middle
new features, because the

00:39:25.406 --> 00:39:26.516 A:middle
administrators won't be able to

00:39:26.516 --> 00:39:27.896 A:middle
take advantage of them until you

00:39:27.896 --> 00:39:29.096 A:middle
do, in the solution that they've

00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:30.216 A:middle
already paid you for.

00:39:32.006 --> 00:39:33.596 A:middle
Please get on adoption of those

00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:35.146 A:middle
security features to help us

00:39:35.146 --> 00:39:37.326 A:middle
make sure that we are keeping

00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:39.086 A:middle
the communication between

00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:39.966 A:middle
enrolled devices and your

00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:41.756 A:middle
product as securely as possible.

00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:44.726 A:middle
And, finally, app developers.

00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:46.366 A:middle
Take advantage of all these
