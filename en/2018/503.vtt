[ Applause ]

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:23.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, it's a pleasure

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:24.676 A:middle
to be here with you.

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:26.386 A:middle
My name is Emmanuel and I'm an

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:27.476 A:middle
engineer on the Core Image team.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:30.106 A:middle
This morning we'll be looking at

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:31.616 A:middle
creating photo and video effects

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.386 A:middle
using depth.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.686 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.976 A:middle
With iOS 11 we started

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.726 A:middle
delivering portrait depth data

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:41.816 A:middle
alongside your portrait still

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
images.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.386 A:middle
During last year's WWDC sessions

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:46.746 A:middle
we showed how you can leverage

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.826 A:middle
that depth data to achieve

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:49.436 A:middle
amazing effects, such as force

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:51.446 A:middle
perspective, simulated depth of

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.996 A:middle
field effects, as well as

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
various foreground and

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.286 A:middle
background separation effects.

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:57.806 A:middle
This year we're extremely

00:00:57.806 --> 00:00:59.206 A:middle
excited to announce that we're

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
coming out with a new feature, a

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
coming out with a new feature, a

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:01.976 A:middle
portrait matte.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.036 A:middle
So during the first half of this

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:08.616 A:middle
session we'll be focusing on

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:09.696 A:middle
portrait still images and how

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.166 A:middle
you can apply really great

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:11.896 A:middle
effects on them.

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:14.366 A:middle
During the next half my

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.446 A:middle
colleague Ron over from video

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.176 A:middle
engineering will be focusing on

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
using a TrueDepth camera to

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:19.906 A:middle
achieve real-time video effects.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.076 A:middle
All right, let's take a look at

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.636 A:middle
the portrait segmentation API.

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:28.436 A:middle
So I mentioned a portrait matte,

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:29.526 A:middle
so what is a portrait matte?

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:30.636 A:middle
A portrait matte is a

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:32.476 A:middle
segmentation from foreground to

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:33.856 A:middle
background and what this means

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:35.706 A:middle
precisely is that you have a

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.706 A:middle
mask which is 1.0 in the

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:40.576 A:middle
foreground and 0.0 in the

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.176 A:middle
background and you get soft and

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:42.976 A:middle
continuous values in between.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:47.646 A:middle
The portrait matte is of

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.116 A:middle
extremely high quality and is

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:50.626 A:middle
able to preserve fine details,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.666 A:middle
such as curl and hair on the

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:53.696 A:middle
outline of your subject.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:55.446 A:middle
This is amazing.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.646 A:middle
The matte can be used to achieve

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
great many effects, here is just

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
great many effects, here is just

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.556 A:middle
one of them where we essentially

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.916 A:middle
do a foreground and background

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.306 A:middle
separation by darkening the

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:06.866 A:middle
background.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.466 A:middle
But we're really putting this

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.806 A:middle
tool into your hands so that you

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:12.256 A:middle
can create amazing apps and new

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.836 A:middle
effects and delight your users.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.466 A:middle
All right, so the portrait

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.116 A:middle
effects matte is coming to you

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:21.326 A:middle
with iOS 12.

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:25.536 A:middle
It is available for both the

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.046 A:middle
front and the rear facing

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:27.476 A:middle
camera.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:31.516 A:middle
It is available to you with

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:33.726 A:middle
portrait still images and at the

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:34.766 A:middle
moment only when there are

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:35.616 A:middle
people in the scene.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.426 A:middle
Note that the portrait matte is

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.086 A:middle
linearly encoded, so it's not

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.306 A:middle
gamma encoded and what you get

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:43.346 A:middle
is a grayscale buffer.

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.966 A:middle
And also there's no guarantee

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:47.826 A:middle
that you will be getting a

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.036 A:middle
portrait matte alongside your

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.076 A:middle
portrait still images, you

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:51.516 A:middle
always do get the depth data but

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.316 A:middle
you need to make sure to test

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:54.196 A:middle
for its existence.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.176 A:middle
All right, let's take a look at

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.666 A:middle
the API and how we can actually

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
load that data in.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
load that data in.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:02.876 A:middle
So ImageIO provides a low-level

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
API that allows you to load

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.466 A:middle
portrait effects matte.

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.456 A:middle
So by calling CGImageSourceCopy

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:10.426 A:middle
there's a new key it can pass

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
kCGImageAuxiliaryData

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:13.806 A:middle
TypePortraitEffectsMatte.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:16.046 A:middle
And this call returns a

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:17.206 A:middle
dictionary containing three main

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:18.216 A:middle
pieces of information.

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:20.426 A:middle
The image data itself as a

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:24.176 A:middle
CFDataRef, metadata pertaining

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:25.496 A:middle
to the buffer itself as a

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.096 A:middle
CFDictionary, as well as

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.236 A:middle
metadata pertaining to the

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.146 A:middle
capture itself.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.056 A:middle
AVFoundation also provides a

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:36.386 A:middle
higher-level API that sits on

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:38.186 A:middle
top of ImageIO that you can use.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.176 A:middle
So taking the output from

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:42.286 A:middle
CGImageSourceCopy you can feed

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
it to the AVPortrait effects

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:43.976 A:middle
matte class.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
And what you get out of it is

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.326 A:middle
very simple it's a CV pixel

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:53.596 A:middle
buffer along with pixel format

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.946 A:middle
type so you can use that CV

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:56.626 A:middle
pixel buffer for your further

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:58.586 A:middle
processing needs, it's really

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
that simple.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
that simple.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.676 A:middle
AVFoundation also supports

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.236 A:middle
portrait matte delivery at

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:04.966 A:middle
capture time.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.176 A:middle
So starting with your typical

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.956 A:middle
AVFoundation setup with your

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.296 A:middle
AVCaptureInput, device, as well

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:12.126 A:middle
as capture session.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:14.386 A:middle
The first thing you want to do

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.436 A:middle
is make sure that your

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:16.495 A:middle
environment supports the

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
delivery of the portrait effects

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:17.986 A:middle
matte.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.286 A:middle
To do this you'll be checking

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:21.636 A:middle
for is that data delivery

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.036 A:middle
supported, as well as is

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:24.176 A:middle
portrait effects matte delivery

00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:24.596 A:middle
supported.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:26.406 A:middle
The reason we have the two there

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:27.636 A:middle
both depth and portrait effects

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:28.496 A:middle
matte is that they come

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:29.046 A:middle
together.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.286 A:middle
You can either opt in to get

00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:32.976 A:middle
only the depth data, but

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:34.026 A:middle
whenever you want the portrait

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
effects matte you also need to

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:36.716 A:middle
activate the depth data

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:37.216 A:middle
delivery.

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:39.786 A:middle
And to activate or to opt in for

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.606 A:middle
that delivery make sure to

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:42.336 A:middle
modify your

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:44.146 A:middle
AVCapturePhotoSettings and set

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:45.336 A:middle
the isPortraitEffects

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.906 A:middle
MatteDelivery enabled, as well

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:48.806 A:middle
as isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled to

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:49.846 A:middle
true.

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.266 A:middle
Then the capture time your

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
ddiFinishProcessingPhoto

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:55.086 A:middle
callback will give you the

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
portrait effects matte.

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:59.316 A:middle
It's really that simple.

00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:01.366 A:middle
All right Core Image also

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:02.986 A:middle
provides you with a way to load

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:04.406 A:middle
and save your portrait effects

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:04.626 A:middle
matte.

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:06.806 A:middle
A new queue was introduced

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:07.726 A:middle
auxiliaryPortrait

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.106 A:middle
EffectsMatte which you just pass

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:10.976 A:middle
your image with contents of URL

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.386 A:middle
and you get a CI image back

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:14.456 A:middle
which contains the portrait

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:14.776 A:middle
effect.

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:19.866 A:middle
Core Image also allows you to

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.636 A:middle
save your portrait effects

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:23.946 A:middle
mattes directly into your files.

00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:26.526 A:middle
To do this there's a new context

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.326 A:middle
option called

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:29.506 A:middle
portraitEffectsMatteImage, you

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.876 A:middle
pass in your CI image containing

00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:32.696 A:middle
the portrait effects matte, and

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:34.086 A:middle
then you can write your file to

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:35.246 A:middle
disk using for example

00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:36.576 A:middle
writeHEIFRepresntationOfImage.

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:39.246 A:middle
All right so one thing that's

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:41.136 A:middle
important to note here is that

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:42.826 A:middle
the three images, so your RGB,

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:44.796 A:middle
the depth buffer, and the

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:47.116 A:middle
portrait matte buffer live at a

00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:47.996 A:middle
different resolution.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.426 A:middle
So for example, the portrait

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:51.876 A:middle
matte for the rear facing camera

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:53.866 A:middle
is half-size and the depth data

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:54.696 A:middle
is even smaller.

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:56.386 A:middle
So let's look at the images

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:57.616 A:middle
side-by-side in the case of the

00:05:57.616 --> 00:05:58.516 A:middle
rear facing camera.

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
What this means that in your

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
What this means that in your

00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:02.076 A:middle
applications you need to make

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:04.236 A:middle
sure to either down-sample your

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:06.076 A:middle
RGB image to the size of your

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:08.636 A:middle
portrait depth or portrait matte

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.086 A:middle
or [inaudible] and sample them

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:12.496 A:middle
to the size of your RGB image.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.316 A:middle
So that's all I wanted to talk

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:16.286 A:middle
about today for the portrait

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:18.686 A:middle
segmentation API and we have a

00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:20.626 A:middle
great demo for you to see this

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.226 A:middle
live in action.

00:06:22.056 --> 00:06:24.986 A:middle
So during this demo I'll be

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:26.376 A:middle
making use of a Jupyter Notebook

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.276 A:middle
which is a browser-based,

00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:30.816 A:middle
real-time interpreter for

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:32.436 A:middle
Python.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:34.826 A:middle
And we'll be making use of

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:36.456 A:middle
Python bindings for Core Image

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:37.646 A:middle
which we'll be introducing later

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:38.976 A:middle
today in a separate session.

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:46.626 A:middle
So let's start and load an image

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:48.686 A:middle
that contains portrait depth and

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:49.706 A:middle
portrait matte in.

00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:50.906 A:middle
So this is the image we're going

00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:51.516 A:middle
to be working with.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:54.956 A:middle
The first thing I want to show

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.796 A:middle
you is what the depth data looks

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:57.906 A:middle
like for that image, so let's

00:06:57.906 --> 00:06:59.196 A:middle
look at the two side-by-side.

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:00.436 A:middle
So we have the portrait depth on

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:00.436 A:middle
So we have the portrait depth on

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.206 A:middle
the left and the portrait matte

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:03.046 A:middle
on the right-hand side and you

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.116 A:middle
can just see how fine the

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:04.796 A:middle
details are.

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.496 A:middle
And we'll do a zoom crop in just

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.896 A:middle
a minute so that you can better

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.126 A:middle
appreciate just how high quality

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:13.066 A:middle
it is.

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:15.686 A:middle
Then next thing we do is we

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:16.586 A:middle
resize the images.

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:18.966 A:middle
As you see the RGB and the depth

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:20.596 A:middle
data vary greatly in size.

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:23.516 A:middle
So we resize our images and

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:24.426 A:middle
let's have a look at them

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:25.126 A:middle
side-by-side.

00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
So we have our RGB and our depth

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:27.536 A:middle
data on the right-hand side.

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:29.076 A:middle
During the first part of this

00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:30.876 A:middle
demo I'll focus on depth data,

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.806 A:middle
then we'll see how things get

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:33.946 A:middle
much, much simpler when you use

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:34.846 A:middle
a portrait effects matte.

00:07:35.596 --> 00:07:37.806 A:middle
So the effect I'm going to be

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:39.296 A:middle
working on today is depth

00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:41.346 A:middle
thresholding and essentially

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:42.426 A:middle
what I'll be doing is computing

00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:43.576 A:middle
a histogram of the gray level

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.316 A:middle
values in my portrait depth.

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:47.596 A:middle
And I'll be applying a threshold

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:48.536 A:middle
or a clipping point in that

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:49.636 A:middle
histogram so that everything

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.516 A:middle
becomes zero or one depending if

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:52.986 A:middle
it's sitting below or above that

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:53.426 A:middle
threshold.

00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:55.886 A:middle
Then we'll be closing holes in

00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:57.336 A:middle
the image by using morphological

00:07:57.336 --> 00:07:59.116 A:middle
closing operations and then

00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.386 A:middle
blurring the mask so that we get

00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.386 A:middle
blurring the mask so that we get

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:03.006 A:middle
a nice feathered look.

00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:05.126 A:middle
Let's have a look at this in

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:05.456 A:middle
action.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.456 A:middle
So remember all of this is

00:08:07.456 --> 00:08:09.966 A:middle
executed live in the browser

00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:11.396 A:middle
using Core Image as a back end.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.836 A:middle
All right so the first thing I

00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:15.356 A:middle
want to show you is how changing

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
percentile point changes my mask

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:17.036 A:middle
here.

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.216 A:middle
So the higher it is the less

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:20.496 A:middle
aggressive I am on clipping the

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:21.026 A:middle
foreground.

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:22.316 A:middle
So let's pick a value that's

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:24.016 A:middle
reasonable, maybe something like

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:24.466 A:middle
this here.

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:26.556 A:middle
And what you can see here is

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.246 A:middle
that there are regions or

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:29.376 A:middle
islands we call them that are

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:31.226 A:middle
connected to my foreground and

00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.176 A:middle
there's a bit of the subject

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:33.086 A:middle
here I'd like to take out.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:35.086 A:middle
So what I'll do is I'll add a

00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:36.446 A:middle
bit of morphological closing.

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:38.385 A:middle
Look at how this appears

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:38.936 A:middle
magically.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.885 A:middle
If I go too far obviously I lose

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:41.956 A:middle
my entire subjects, I don't want

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:42.265 A:middle
to do that.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:43.866 A:middle
So let's pick something like

00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:44.226 A:middle
this.

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:46.576 A:middle
What I can do then is change the

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:47.876 A:middle
feathering by applying the mask

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:48.556 A:middle
on top of it all.

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:50.306 A:middle
Let's take a look at how the RGB

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:51.266 A:middle
is threshold in back.

00:08:51.686 --> 00:08:52.906 A:middle
This is not the effect we're

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:54.176 A:middle
coming up it's just to give a

00:08:54.176 --> 00:08:55.166 A:middle
sense of how the mask is

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.306 A:middle
applied, so let's keep going.

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.206 A:middle
So I've chosen a few parameters

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.746 A:middle
for this thresholding here and

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.746 A:middle
for this thresholding here and

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:02.676 A:middle
this is what I'll be using for

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:02.976 A:middle
my foreground.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:09.416 A:middle
Next, I'm applying an effect

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:10.536 A:middle
only on my foreground, so in

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:11.546 A:middle
this particular case I'm using

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:12.936 A:middle
the Core Image photo effect Noir

00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:14.396 A:middle
which turns everything grayscale

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:15.556 A:middle
and has a has a bit of contrast.

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:17.206 A:middle
I'm doing an exposure

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:19.816 A:middle
adjustment, as well as

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:21.156 A:middle
desaturating my image slightly

00:09:21.156 --> 00:09:22.766 A:middle
and augmenting the contrast even

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:23.196 A:middle
further.

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:24.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at the output.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:25.716 A:middle
This is going to be the

00:09:25.716 --> 00:09:26.826 A:middle
foreground that I'll be using

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:28.936 A:middle
and what I want to do here is

00:09:29.016 --> 00:09:32.016 A:middle
leverage the depth data mask

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:33.756 A:middle
that I have to composite this

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:35.446 A:middle
foreground onto a background.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
Let's just generate a background

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.276 A:middle
which is just a darker version

00:09:39.396 --> 00:09:40.236 A:middle
of the original image.

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:43.816 A:middle
We can then composite the two

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.146 A:middle
together using the Core Image

00:09:45.146 --> 00:09:48.956 A:middle
filter blendWithMask and we have

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.186 A:middle
the result right there, it's

00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:50.726 A:middle
that simple.

00:09:51.386 --> 00:09:52.866 A:middle
All right.

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.936 A:middle
Thank you.

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:58.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.076 A:middle
Okay so as you saw that required

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.076 A:middle
Okay so as you saw that required

00:10:02.076 --> 00:10:02.926 A:middle
a bit of fiddling with the

00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:04.096 A:middle
parameters for clipping, for

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:05.666 A:middle
smoothing, and then so on and so

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:06.096 A:middle
forth.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.366 A:middle
The portrait effects matte

00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
enables you to do this without

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:11.666 A:middle
actually doing much process,

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:12.816 A:middle
this is really exciting so let's

00:10:12.816 --> 00:10:13.386 A:middle
have a look at this.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:15.506 A:middle
So here we're starting with

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:19.086 A:middle
another image that also has

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.646 A:middle
portrait depth and portrait

00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:22.386 A:middle
matte information embedded into

00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:23.486 A:middle
it, so let's look at these.

00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:27.056 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, this is

00:10:27.056 --> 00:10:28.846 A:middle
an extremely high-quality

00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:29.666 A:middle
foreground mask.

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.056 A:middle
So let's have a look at a crop

00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:33.376 A:middle
on this hair.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:36.846 A:middle
Look at how fine the detail is,

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
this is beautiful.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.526 A:middle
On the right-hand side here is

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:39.676 A:middle
the depth that it shows you just

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:42.436 A:middle
how coarse the depth data is

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:43.586 A:middle
compared to effect matte.

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:46.036 A:middle
So we'll do another foreground

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.886 A:middle
separation effect here similarly

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:49.016 A:middle
to what we just did but we used

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:49.956 A:middle
a portrait matte instead of

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
using the portrait depth.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.736 A:middle
So let's look at our foreground

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.606 A:middle
similar as before but in this

00:10:55.606 --> 00:10:56.656 A:middle
case, we'll desaturate the

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.856 A:middle
foreground slightly, add a bit

00:10:57.856 --> 00:10:59.746 A:middle
of contrast, as well as some

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
vibrance to the image.

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
vibrance to the image.

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:04.706 A:middle
Now let's generate a background,

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.006 A:middle
in this case we'll do a disk

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.236 A:middle
blur which is another Core Image

00:11:07.236 --> 00:11:08.836 A:middle
filter, as well as bring down

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:09.996 A:middle
the exposure so things get

00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:10.746 A:middle
pretty dark.

00:11:10.746 --> 00:11:12.356 A:middle
But we still get a bit of

00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:13.386 A:middle
background remaining, it's quite

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
faint but it's still there.

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:17.826 A:middle
And again, I use a CI blend with

00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:19.216 A:middle
mask which is going to do the

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:20.716 A:middle
compositing for us with the mask

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:22.216 A:middle
and we have left and right.

00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:23.776 A:middle
Isn't this beautiful?

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:27.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.056 --> 00:11:29.276 A:middle
Thank you.

00:11:29.436 --> 00:11:30.476 A:middle
All right let's look at another

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:32.106 A:middle
great demo which we call Big

00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:32.386 A:middle
Head.

00:11:32.946 --> 00:11:36.326 A:middle
So because the portrait matte is

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:37.806 A:middle
so fine we can actually do

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.306 A:middle
things like change the

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:40.496 A:middle
[inaudible] size of our subject

00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:41.606 A:middle
with respect to the background

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:41.966 A:middle
using it.

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:44.506 A:middle
So let's do just that and we'll

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:45.006 A:middle
do it live.

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:48.536 A:middle
So here's our input image on the

00:11:48.536 --> 00:11:50.416 A:middle
left here and the portrait matte

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:52.786 A:middle
on the right-hand side.

00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:55.056 A:middle
And what I'll be doing here as

00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:57.146 A:middle
I'll be playing with the size of

00:11:57.146 --> 00:11:59.616 A:middle
the subject in my frame notice

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.296 A:middle
how the subject is getting

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.296 A:middle
how the subject is getting

00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:02.416 A:middle
smaller and bigger.

00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:04.946 A:middle
And you can actually you know

00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
give more weight to the subject

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:09.046 A:middle
in your frame, but you can also

00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:11.106 A:middle
do pretty cool things like now

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.456 A:middle
that I have this let's say that

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.966 A:middle
I pick my favorite size here.

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.436 A:middle
You can do things like pseudo

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.346 A:middle
simulated depth of field here by

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.276 A:middle
giving more contrast to the

00:12:20.276 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
foreground and using a

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:22.916 A:middle
[inaudible] in the background to

00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:24.136 A:middle
give more pop to your subject.

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.006 A:middle
All right let's take a look at

00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
just another image to see just

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:30.506 A:middle
how easy that is because they're

00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:32.226 A:middle
using the exact same pipeline

00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:33.176 A:middle
under the hood which is very

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:34.486 A:middle
simple just using the portrait

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:36.376 A:middle
matte and using it to blur the

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.856 A:middle
foreground and background.

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:40.096 A:middle
Again our input image here, we

00:12:40.096 --> 00:12:42.586 A:middle
can change the size of it, make

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.966 A:middle
it bigger, then apply a bit of

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
contrast to give more focus to

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:47.736 A:middle
our subject.

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
It's that easy, really exciting.

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:55.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:57.186 A:middle
All right let's take a look at

00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:58.296 A:middle
another demo which we call

00:12:58.296 --> 00:12:58.956 A:middle
Marching.

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
I'm not even going to try to

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
I'm not even going to try to

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:02.976 A:middle
explain what it does, let's just

00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:04.476 A:middle
take a look at the filter in

00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:04.816 A:middle
action.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:12.516 A:middle
There you go, fun stuff and just

00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:14.236 A:middle
because we can do it I can

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:15.696 A:middle
expose how many of these I want

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:16.406 A:middle
to stitch together.

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.726 A:middle
So going from just a few to you

00:13:18.726 --> 00:13:19.926 A:middle
really, really pushing that way,

00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
way too far.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:23.046 A:middle
Really exciting stuff.

00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:23.926 A:middle
All right.

00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:31.506 A:middle
So that's it for this demo, I

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:32.356 A:middle
hope you enjoyed this.

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.606 A:middle
So if you'd like to know more

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:36.956 A:middle
about using Python bindings for

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.126 A:middle
Core Image I encourage you to

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:39.426 A:middle
come to this afternoon's session

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:40.906 A:middle
on Core Image Performance

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:42.066 A:middle
Prototyping in Python.

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:45.616 A:middle
That's all for me today, let me

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.736 A:middle
introduce you to my colleague

00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:48.266 A:middle
Ron from video engineering who

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.676 A:middle
will be talking about real-time

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:51.046 A:middle
video effects with TrueDepth.

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:51.976 A:middle
Thank you everybody.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Emmanuel.

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:00.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Emmanuel.

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:02.826 A:middle
Great photo effects but what

00:14:02.826 --> 00:14:03.456 A:middle
about video.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
My name is Ron Sokolovsky and I

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:07.916 A:middle
am from video engineering.

00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:11.946 A:middle
In this part we are going to

00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:13.236 A:middle
leverage the TrueDepth's camera

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:15.576 A:middle
to create similar effects with

00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:17.636 A:middle
real-time video, like for

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:19.226 A:middle
example this background

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.426 A:middle
replacement app.

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:24.556 A:middle
In order to create such effects

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:26.486 A:middle
we are going to deep dive into

00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:27.776 A:middle
the stream coming from the

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:29.306 A:middle
TrueDepth camera, the

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:31.336 A:middle
characteristics, best practices,

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:32.066 A:middle
and challenges.

00:14:32.636 --> 00:14:35.316 A:middle
We are also going to show you

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:36.706 A:middle
how to work with point clouds, a

00:14:36.706 --> 00:14:38.286 A:middle
completely different way to

00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:40.006 A:middle
process and render rich depth

00:14:40.006 --> 00:14:40.546 A:middle
information.

00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:42.626 A:middle
And that background replacement

00:14:42.846 --> 00:14:44.116 A:middle
app we're calling it Backdrop

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.516 A:middle
and we'll show you how to make

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:46.756 A:middle
it step-by-step.

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:50.116 A:middle
But first things first, the

00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:51.446 A:middle
stream for the TrueDepth's

00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:53.396 A:middle
camera is made of frames, each

00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:55.326 A:middle
frame is a depth map, a 2-D

00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:57.186 A:middle
image in which each pixel

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:58.926 A:middle
contains the depth information

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.526 A:middle
or the distance to the scene in

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.526 A:middle
or the distance to the scene in

00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:00.976 A:middle
that direction.

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.296 A:middle
We've chosen a specific coloring

00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:08.466 A:middle
scheme, closed pixels are

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:11.056 A:middle
colored in red while fire red

00:15:11.056 --> 00:15:12.306 A:middle
pixels are colored in blue.

00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:14.216 A:middle
In between them there is a

00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:16.426 A:middle
colorful spectrum so you can see

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
the texture of the depth map.

00:15:20.156 --> 00:15:21.686 A:middle
There are also black pixels,

00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:23.636 A:middle
those are holes in a depth map.

00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:25.946 A:middle
For those pixels we have no

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:27.596 A:middle
information what is the depth.

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.796 A:middle
We are releasing today a new

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.936 A:middle
tool, a sample app for you to

00:15:32.936 --> 00:15:34.676 A:middle
explore this stream and we call

00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:36.526 A:middle
it TrueDepth Streamer.

00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:40.716 A:middle
You can slide between the video

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.976 A:middle
stream and the TrueDepth stream.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.716 A:middle
Now because the TrueDepth camera

00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:51.936 A:middle
has active illumination even in

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.676 A:middle
complete darkness while the

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:56.966 A:middle
video is pitch black it is

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:58.186 A:middle
business as usual for the

00:15:58.186 --> 00:15:59.026 A:middle
TrueDepth camera.

00:16:01.716 --> 00:16:04.636 A:middle
So now you see me and now you

00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:04.906 A:middle
don't.

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:09.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:09.766 --> 00:16:11.666 A:middle
So how do you add the stream

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.896 A:middle
from the TrueDepth camera into

00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:13.986 A:middle
your application?

00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:15.906 A:middle
Well I'm glad you asked.

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.526 A:middle
The first thing you need to do

00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:19.346 A:middle
is to discover the built-in

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:22.146 A:middle
TrueDepth camera and then you

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.866 A:middle
initialize the device capture

00:16:23.866 --> 00:16:24.186 A:middle
input.

00:16:24.186 --> 00:16:27.416 A:middle
And you add the depth data

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:28.766 A:middle
output into your session.

00:16:29.606 --> 00:16:31.426 A:middle
At this point you're good to go,

00:16:31.496 --> 00:16:32.826 A:middle
you can start the session and

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:33.706 A:middle
you will have the TrueDepth

00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:35.266 A:middle
stream with your session.

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:39.286 A:middle
This stream can come in two

00:16:39.286 --> 00:16:41.836 A:middle
forms of data, disparity or

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:42.166 A:middle
depth.

00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:44.306 A:middle
Now disparity is the inverse of

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:46.586 A:middle
depth and vice versa, so which

00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:47.396 A:middle
one should you choose?

00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:51.366 A:middle
Well disparity usually yields

00:16:51.366 --> 00:16:53.456 A:middle
better results, especially for

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:54.596 A:middle
machine learning applications

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:56.646 A:middle
but the depth data has more

00:16:56.646 --> 00:16:58.346 A:middle
meaning in terms of real-world

00:16:58.346 --> 00:16:58.926 A:middle
measurements.

00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
Know that if you work with depth

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:05.246 A:middle
that the depth error goes with

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:05.935 A:middle
the depth squared.

00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:08.096 A:middle
That means that an object at 1

00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
meter would have four times the

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.826 A:middle
depth accuracy as an object at 2

00:17:11.826 --> 00:17:11.976 A:middle
meters.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.496 A:middle
We have two streams, video and

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.425 A:middle
depth, and they don't

00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:20.596 A:middle
necessarily share the same

00:17:20.596 --> 00:17:21.136 A:middle
resolution.

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:23.006 A:middle
The native resolution of the

00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:24.596 A:middle
TrueDepth's camera is VGA or

00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:27.736 A:middle
640x480 and that's what you'll

00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
get if you choose a video preset

00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:32.236 A:middle
of an aspect racial of 4:3.

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:35.516 A:middle
If however you choose an aspect

00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:37.816 A:middle
ratio of 16x9 you'll get a depth

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:40.246 A:middle
map of 640x360.

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:42.916 A:middle
In both cases the depth map will

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:44.856 A:middle
cover the entire field of view

00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.146 A:middle
of the RGB image.

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.466 A:middle
Now we are talking about video

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:51.116 A:middle
applications, so we are

00:17:51.116 --> 00:17:52.946 A:middle
crunching a lot of numbers very,

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.956 A:middle
very fast and that could create

00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:57.266 A:middle
system pressure over time.

00:17:57.936 --> 00:17:59.696 A:middle
So you can test your application

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.306 A:middle
and gauge the system pressure

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.306 A:middle
and gauge the system pressure

00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
level which goes from nominal to

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.216 A:middle
fair, serious, critical, and

00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:07.056 A:middle
then shutdown.

00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:08.956 A:middle
And the responsibility is in

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:10.886 A:middle
your hands because the system

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.326 A:middle
will let you go all the way to

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:15.206 A:middle
shutdown but when it does it's

00:18:15.206 --> 00:18:17.326 A:middle
bye-bye every capture device.

00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:22.026 A:middle
Another thing you can do is to

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.006 A:middle
adopt a degradation scheme, if

00:18:24.006 --> 00:18:25.496 A:middle
the pressure level gets serious

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.206 A:middle
you can reduce the frame rate to

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:29.736 A:middle
15 frames per second or you can

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:31.516 A:middle
choose a more elaborate scheme

00:18:31.896 --> 00:18:33.966 A:middle
with gentle degradation going

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:37.356 A:middle
from 30, 24, 20 and 15 frames

00:18:37.356 --> 00:18:39.536 A:middle
per second anytime the pressure

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:39.976 A:middle
level increases.

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:45.026 A:middle
So we have holes in the depth

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.406 A:middle
map what can we do about it?

00:18:47.686 --> 00:18:49.456 A:middle
Well, in fact you could get the

00:18:49.456 --> 00:18:51.496 A:middle
stream already filtered for you.

00:18:52.176 --> 00:18:53.936 A:middle
There is a parameter called

00:18:53.936 --> 00:18:55.546 A:middle
isFilteringEnabled and it's'

00:18:55.546 --> 00:18:57.676 A:middle
defaulted to true, which means

00:18:57.676 --> 00:18:59.236 A:middle
you get a filtered depth map

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
smooth, spatially and temporally

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
smooth, spatially and temporally

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:03.536 A:middle
and the holes are filled from

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:04.356 A:middle
the RGB image.

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:07.256 A:middle
This is especially useful for

00:19:07.256 --> 00:19:08.616 A:middle
photography and segmentation

00:19:08.616 --> 00:19:10.206 A:middle
applications because you know

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:12.386 A:middle
every time you query a pixel you

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.216 A:middle
get the depth's value.

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:17.376 A:middle
In TrueDepth Streamer you can

00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:19.566 A:middle
switch to the filter stream and

00:19:19.566 --> 00:19:21.876 A:middle
see that it is smoother and the

00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:22.586 A:middle
holes are filled.

00:19:23.126 --> 00:19:27.526 A:middle
So this is great, but it is not

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.246 A:middle
applicable to 100% of the use

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:29.636 A:middle
cases.

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:31.676 A:middle
If you're working with point

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.606 A:middle
clouds or any type of real-world

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:36.256 A:middle
measurements you're better off

00:19:36.256 --> 00:19:38.366 A:middle
staying with the raw data which

00:19:38.366 --> 00:19:39.806 A:middle
holds the highest fidelity.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.726 A:middle
If you do you will have holes,

00:19:42.906 --> 00:19:44.496 A:middle
you will have pixels marked as

00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:46.866 A:middle
zero, it does not mean that they

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:48.396 A:middle
are the distance of zero meters

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.356 A:middle
from the camera it just means we

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.296 A:middle
have no information about them.

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:54.946 A:middle
Therefore, you should watch out

00:19:55.116 --> 00:19:56.506 A:middle
for operations like averaging

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:57.606 A:middle
and downsampling because you

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.386 A:middle
don't want to mix those real

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
values with those zeros.

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
values with those zeros.

00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:04.996 A:middle
But why do we even get holes?

00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:08.876 A:middle
Well the TrueDepth camera

00:20:09.296 --> 00:20:11.456 A:middle
detects objects up to a distance

00:20:11.456 --> 00:20:14.056 A:middle
of about 5 meters, but not all

00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:15.296 A:middle
materials are made the same.

00:20:15.636 --> 00:20:16.796 A:middle
Some materials have low

00:20:16.796 --> 00:20:17.496 A:middle
reflectivity.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.126 A:middle
they absorb most of the lights.

00:20:21.476 --> 00:20:23.656 A:middle
For example this extreme

00:20:23.706 --> 00:20:26.046 A:middle
scenario is a very low

00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:27.896 A:middle
reflective fabric watch what

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:29.686 A:middle
happens when we switch to the

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.766 A:middle
depth map and I walk away from

00:20:33.346 --> 00:20:33.436 A:middle
it.

00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:35.066 A:middle
Even though there are objects in

00:20:35.066 --> 00:20:37.466 A:middle
the scene with larger distance

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:39.866 A:middle
we see holes forming on this

00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:41.436 A:middle
fabric because it's absorbing

00:20:42.026 --> 00:20:42.766 A:middle
most of the light.

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:45.446 A:middle
If we switch to the filtered

00:20:45.446 --> 00:20:47.616 A:middle
stream and repeat the same

00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:49.246 A:middle
motion those holes are filled.

00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:53.336 A:middle
But it's not only about the

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.766 A:middle
amount of light reflected back

00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:56.916 A:middle
it's also about the direction in

00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:58.056 A:middle
which it is reflected to.

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:01.036 A:middle
Some materials are specular or

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:01.036 A:middle
Some materials are specular or

00:21:01.036 --> 00:21:02.826 A:middle
shiny and they are very picky

00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.166 A:middle
and choosy in which direction

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.046 A:middle
they send back the light.

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:08.406 A:middle
An extreme scenario would be

00:21:08.406 --> 00:21:11.816 A:middle
this display, you can watch the

00:21:11.816 --> 00:21:12.846 A:middle
video stream to see the

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
reflection.

00:21:14.616 --> 00:21:15.746 A:middle
And when we switch to the depth

00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:18.366 A:middle
map holes are forming depending

00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:19.746 A:middle
on the angle between the device

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.246 A:middle
and the screen.

00:21:21.556 --> 00:21:23.376 A:middle
And if we switch to the filtered

00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:25.216 A:middle
stream those holes are filled

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.976 A:middle
but with less fidelity.

00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:32.916 A:middle
Another challenging scenario is

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:35.306 A:middle
outdoor, typically in an outdoor

00:21:35.306 --> 00:21:36.996 A:middle
scene the background is very far

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
away so we don't expect to get

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:39.806 A:middle
any depth on the background.

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:42.956 A:middle
Also, the sun acts as an

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:44.396 A:middle
aggressor to the active

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:44.906 A:middle
illumination.

00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:48.696 A:middle
To demonstrate that I went

00:21:48.696 --> 00:21:50.006 A:middle
outside on a very sunny

00:21:50.006 --> 00:21:51.556 A:middle
afternoon, positioned myself

00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:52.326 A:middle
against the sun.

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:54.286 A:middle
And when we switch to the depth

00:21:54.286 --> 00:21:55.926 A:middle
map you can see there's no

00:21:55.926 --> 00:21:58.056 A:middle
depths on the background and we

00:21:58.056 --> 00:21:59.786 A:middle
get some holes around the

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
frames, specifically in this

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
frames, specifically in this

00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:02.506 A:middle
case the hair.

00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:05.556 A:middle
But still most of the depth on

00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:07.126 A:middle
the foreground is intact and

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:07.696 A:middle
very useful.

00:22:08.256 --> 00:22:12.436 A:middle
One final point I want to cover

00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:14.616 A:middle
for getting holes is the fact

00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:15.736 A:middle
that from the perspective of the

00:22:15.736 --> 00:22:17.516 A:middle
TrueDepth camera some of the

00:22:17.516 --> 00:22:19.396 A:middle
light projected hits an object

00:22:19.396 --> 00:22:21.306 A:middle
on the way back so we get

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.006 A:middle
shadows from the parallax

00:22:23.006 --> 00:22:24.886 A:middle
between the projector and the

00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:26.096 A:middle
camera.

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.316 A:middle
You can see an example on the

00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:29.266 A:middle
right side of this mug, but

00:22:30.176 --> 00:22:31.576 A:middle
something is different here.

00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.426 A:middle
This is not a depth map so why

00:22:34.426 --> 00:22:36.916 A:middle
do we even get holes?

00:22:37.096 --> 00:22:38.586 A:middle
Well in TrueDepth Streamer you

00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:41.076 A:middle
can switch from 2-D mode into

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:43.136 A:middle
3-D mode, which gives us a point

00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:43.616 A:middle
cloud view.

00:22:44.326 --> 00:22:45.956 A:middle
With point clouds we can

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:47.426 A:middle
dynamically change the

00:22:47.426 --> 00:22:48.936 A:middle
perspective of the scene

00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:53.506 A:middle
creating even more holes when we

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:56.256 A:middle
do so.

00:22:56.396 --> 00:22:58.226 A:middle
And now I can ask you is this

00:22:58.226 --> 00:23:01.706 A:middle
mug half empty or half full and

00:22:58.226 --> 00:23:01.706 A:middle
mug half empty or half full and

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:03.826 A:middle
the answer is we have no idea.

00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:07.176 A:middle
By virtually changing the point

00:23:07.176 --> 00:23:08.606 A:middle
of view of the camera we don't

00:23:08.606 --> 00:23:10.696 A:middle
add new information and that is

00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:11.966 A:middle
because the TrueDepth camera can

00:23:11.966 --> 00:23:13.656 A:middle
do many things, but bending

00:23:13.656 --> 00:23:16.466 A:middle
light into the mug not one of

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:17.726 A:middle
them.

00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:18.786 A:middle
Let's see this live.

00:23:21.516 --> 00:23:24.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:32.946 A:middle
So I'm starting with a video

00:23:32.946 --> 00:23:34.156 A:middle
view and I want you to look in

00:23:34.156 --> 00:23:34.736 A:middle
this corner.

00:23:35.636 --> 00:23:37.356 A:middle
Watch what happens when I touch

00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:38.456 A:middle
the screen, I will touch my

00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:39.636 A:middle
forehead, you can see an

00:23:39.636 --> 00:23:41.456 A:middle
indication of the depth.

00:23:41.806 --> 00:23:44.466 A:middle
And if I move the phone you can

00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:46.036 A:middle
see the [inaudible] changing and

00:23:46.036 --> 00:23:47.606 A:middle
the reason I can do so is

00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:50.206 A:middle
because we have the stream from

00:23:50.206 --> 00:23:51.346 A:middle
the TrueDepth camera running as

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:53.836 A:middle
well and you can see that it is

00:23:53.836 --> 00:23:55.316 A:middle
overlaid on the video.

00:23:55.316 --> 00:23:58.976 A:middle
So we have this livestream 30

00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
frames per second and we can

00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
frames per second and we can

00:24:00.766 --> 00:24:01.996 A:middle
switch to the filtered stream

00:24:02.456 --> 00:24:04.866 A:middle
and then all the holes are

00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:06.026 A:middle
filled.

00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:07.446 A:middle
If I switch to the point cloud

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.076 A:middle
view I can dynamically change

00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:13.296 A:middle
the point of view to the scene.

00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:15.516 A:middle
So even though I'm looking

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:17.786 A:middle
directly to the device it looks

00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:19.136 A:middle
as if somebody's watching me

00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:19.846 A:middle
from up above.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.516 A:middle
Now the reason we call this a

00:24:22.516 --> 00:24:25.076 A:middle
point cloud is if I zoom in you

00:24:25.076 --> 00:24:27.366 A:middle
can actually see the points in

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:28.156 A:middle
3-D space.

00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:32.016 A:middle
But being here with you in WWDC

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:33.576 A:middle
I feel like I have to pinch

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:35.666 A:middle
myself just to get things back

00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:36.306 A:middle
in perspective.

00:24:39.516 --> 00:24:42.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:45.076 --> 00:24:47.396 A:middle
Thank you so that brings us to

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
point clouds.

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
How do we create them?

00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:51.426 A:middle
We're starting from a depth map,

00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:54.236 A:middle
a 2-D image in which the depth Z

00:24:54.716 --> 00:24:55.886 A:middle
is a function of the pixel

00:24:55.886 --> 00:24:57.056 A:middle
coordinates U and V.

00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:00.076 A:middle
And we want to transform it to a

00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:00.076 A:middle
And we want to transform it to a

00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:01.586 A:middle
new coordinate system in 3-D

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:03.486 A:middle
space, X, Y, Z.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.256 A:middle
Now we already have Z right,

00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:07.616 A:middle
that's the depth from the depth

00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:09.766 A:middle
map but we want to get X and Y.

00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:13.606 A:middle
For that we need to get the help

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
from the Intrinsics Matrix which

00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:17.196 A:middle
holds information for the focal

00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:18.346 A:middle
lengths and principle point.

00:25:19.376 --> 00:25:21.686 A:middle
If for example I want to get X I

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:22.936 A:middle
need to start with the pixel

00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:24.506 A:middle
coordinate U, subtract the

00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:26.576 A:middle
principle point, multiply by the

00:25:26.576 --> 00:25:28.576 A:middle
depth, and divide by the focal

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:28.916 A:middle
lengths.

00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:30.416 A:middle
And naturally I have to do the

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.256 A:middle
same thing for the other

00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:32.026 A:middle
dimension as well.

00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:36.976 A:middle
Now this Intrinsics Matrix is

00:25:36.976 --> 00:25:38.436 A:middle
accessible through the camera

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.126 A:middle
calibration data.

00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:43.656 A:middle
In fact, this operation is done

00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:46.676 A:middle
in every frame of the TrueDepth

00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:47.056 A:middle
stream.

00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:49.836 A:middle
The reason for that is that the

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:51.656 A:middle
video stream and the depth

00:25:51.656 --> 00:25:53.076 A:middle
stream are coming from two

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.506 A:middle
separate cameras.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:57.246 A:middle
But because the TrueDepth camera

00:25:57.246 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
gives us a depth map we can

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
transform it into a point cloud

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
transform it into a point cloud

00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:03.046 A:middle
and re-project it to the

00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:06.306 A:middle
perspective of the RGB image so

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:07.756 A:middle
the depth stream is already

00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:10.076 A:middle
registered on the video stream

00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:13.556 A:middle
for you and you get RGBD data.

00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:15.916 A:middle
Now, thank you.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:18.346 A:middle
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.526 A:middle
Now these types of operations

00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:23.456 A:middle
are best done in metal graphic

00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:23.906 A:middle
shaders.

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.476 A:middle
And you can download the code

00:26:25.476 --> 00:26:27.066 A:middle
for TrueDepth Streamer and you

00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:28.666 A:middle
want to focus on two areas.

00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:32.286 A:middle
In the vertex shader we control

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.296 A:middle
the location of the points,

00:26:33.486 --> 00:26:34.976 A:middle
we'll start with the depth map

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.696 A:middle
and transform it to real-world

00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:37.986 A:middle
coordinates or X, Y, Z.

00:26:39.186 --> 00:26:40.796 A:middle
Then we can multiply it with a

00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:43.006 A:middle
view matrix to change the point

00:26:43.006 --> 00:26:43.706 A:middle
of view to the scene.

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:49.066 A:middle
In the fragment shader we get

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.766 A:middle
the output of the vertex, but we

00:26:51.766 --> 00:26:53.866 A:middle
have to see if it's a real value

00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:55.186 A:middle
or a hole in the depth map.

00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:57.476 A:middle
If it's a hole and it's marked

00:26:57.476 --> 00:26:59.766 A:middle
as zero we don't know its depth

00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:01.516 A:middle
so we cannot transform it to X,

00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:01.516 A:middle
so we cannot transform it to X,

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:02.856 A:middle
Y, Z and we would need to

00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:03.816 A:middle
discard this point.

00:27:05.196 --> 00:27:06.786 A:middle
If it is a real value we can

00:27:06.786 --> 00:27:09.286 A:middle
sample the RGB texture and add

00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:11.366 A:middle
color to the fragment or point

00:27:11.366 --> 00:27:14.746 A:middle
in this case.

00:27:14.956 --> 00:27:17.356 A:middle
So I understand this part was a

00:27:17.356 --> 00:27:19.066 A:middle
bit technical and a lot of you

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:20.276 A:middle
come from different backgrounds.

00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:22.876 A:middle
Have no fear we have just the

00:27:22.876 --> 00:27:25.056 A:middle
app for you, an app to replace

00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:26.756 A:middle
your background, let's see it

00:27:26.756 --> 00:27:26.906 A:middle
live.

00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:40.926 A:middle
Let's see it live.

00:27:41.136 --> 00:27:43.516 A:middle
So I can put myself in Yosemite,

00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:46.466 A:middle
I can swipe down put myself in

00:27:46.466 --> 00:27:47.466 A:middle
something more abstract.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:51.466 A:middle
I can even go all the way to

00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:53.006 A:middle
Antelope Canyon, Arizona, it

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:54.356 A:middle
took me 15 hours to get there

00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:55.846 A:middle
last time, I could have just

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:57.426 A:middle
swiped down, saved a lot of

00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.126 A:middle
money on gas.

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.016 A:middle
In fact, this application can

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.016 A:middle
In fact, this application can

00:28:02.016 --> 00:28:04.116 A:middle
even put you in space where

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:05.876 A:middle
nobody can hear you stream.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:15.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:19.036 A:middle
So how do we create that?

00:28:19.256 --> 00:28:21.586 A:middle
Anytime we're dealing with a

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:23.706 A:middle
video application there's other

00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:25.476 A:middle
things that are going on a per

00:28:25.476 --> 00:28:28.456 A:middle
frame basis, in this case we

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:31.696 A:middle
have to detect a face, create a

00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:33.316 A:middle
brand-new mask from the depth

00:28:33.316 --> 00:28:36.056 A:middle
map, smooth and upscale it to

00:28:36.056 --> 00:28:37.286 A:middle
the RGB resolution.

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:39.246 A:middle
And then we take this foreground

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:41.536 A:middle
mask and upscale it again to the

00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:42.636 A:middle
low-light background image.

00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:44.616 A:middle
And then we can blend or

00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:46.876 A:middle
[inaudible] them, but there's

00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:49.336 A:middle
something we can do to reduce

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:50.416 A:middle
some of the complexity.

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:54.466 A:middle
If anytime we load a background

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.306 A:middle
image we resize it to the RGB

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.756 A:middle
resolution just once not

00:28:57.756 --> 00:28:59.556 A:middle
per-frame, then we don't need

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
that second upscale and the

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
that second upscale and the

00:29:01.446 --> 00:29:02.926 A:middle
blending is done at low

00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:04.376 A:middle
resolution which makes a big

00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:04.886 A:middle
difference.

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:07.716 A:middle
So let's deep dive into those

00:29:07.716 --> 00:29:08.086 A:middle
depths.

00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:10.606 A:middle
The first thing we need is to

00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:11.856 A:middle
find the center of the face.

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:14.406 A:middle
And in iOS there are actually

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:16.386 A:middle
quite a few ways you can get

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:17.316 A:middle
face metadata.

00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:19.246 A:middle
You can use a Core Image

00:29:19.246 --> 00:29:20.706 A:middle
detector or the Vision

00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:22.796 A:middle
Framework, but in this case

00:29:22.976 --> 00:29:25.226 A:middle
since we just need the pixel at

00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:26.366 A:middle
the center of the face we can

00:29:26.366 --> 00:29:28.586 A:middle
use AV meta data object type

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:29.056 A:middle
face.

00:29:30.426 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
But it gives us the center in

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:34.236 A:middle
the coding system of the RGB

00:29:34.236 --> 00:29:36.086 A:middle
image and we need to map it to

00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:38.196 A:middle
the depth map which might not be

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:39.106 A:middle
in the same resolution.

00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:43.316 A:middle
Once we have the value of the

00:29:43.316 --> 00:29:45.886 A:middle
depth of the face we can use it

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:47.566 A:middle
plus a margin of characteristic

00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:50.656 A:middle
25 centimeters to threshold the

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:52.306 A:middle
depth map and create a binary

00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:54.076 A:middle
mask, foreground is one,

00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:55.296 A:middle
background is zero.

00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:58.456 A:middle
In fact, we can stop here, we

00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
can use this binary mask and

00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
can use this binary mask and

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:00.956 A:middle
create the effect.

00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:02.816 A:middle
The transition from background

00:30:02.816 --> 00:30:04.166 A:middle
to foreground will be very

00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:06.636 A:middle
sharp, but we'll get some

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:07.826 A:middle
fidgeting around the edges.

00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:10.856 A:middle
So we want to filter it a bit.

00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:14.156 A:middle
The first stage will be to apply

00:30:14.156 --> 00:30:15.216 A:middle
some smoothing from the

00:30:15.216 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
background to the foreground, in

00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
this case Gaussian Blurring.

00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.446 A:middle
The radius of Gaussian Blurring

00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:22.716 A:middle
will determine the slope of the

00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:25.096 A:middle
transition and you can play with

00:30:25.096 --> 00:30:26.696 A:middle
the value to get different

00:30:27.996 --> 00:30:28.526 A:middle
effects.

00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
Another processing stage we add

00:30:31.346 --> 00:30:33.966 A:middle
is gamma adjustments, it allows

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.286 A:middle
us to further fine-tune this

00:30:35.286 --> 00:30:36.456 A:middle
transition from background to

00:30:36.456 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
foreground.

00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:39.386 A:middle
If we use a gamma value which is

00:30:39.386 --> 00:30:41.576 A:middle
higher than one we'll get a

00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:43.156 A:middle
narrower foreground mask.

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.966 A:middle
On the other hand, if we use a

00:30:45.966 --> 00:30:47.526 A:middle
gamma value that is smaller than

00:30:47.526 --> 00:30:49.886 A:middle
one we'll get a wider foreground

00:30:49.886 --> 00:30:51.026 A:middle
mask and maybe some aura.

00:30:52.386 --> 00:30:53.646 A:middle
So you can create different

00:30:53.646 --> 00:30:56.286 A:middle
effects by combining those two

00:30:56.446 --> 00:30:57.136 A:middle
parameters.

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:01.156 A:middle
If you use a large blur radius

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:01.156 A:middle
If you use a large blur radius

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:02.866 A:middle
and a large gamma value you

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:04.656 A:middle
create this transparent

00:31:04.656 --> 00:31:06.726 A:middle
transition that makes you seem

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:08.486 A:middle
as if you're a hologram in space

00:31:09.546 --> 00:31:10.706 A:middle
or similarly it could be

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:13.336 A:middle
underwater and you can play with

00:31:13.336 --> 00:31:15.146 A:middle
the values to create different

00:31:15.146 --> 00:31:15.576 A:middle
effects.

00:31:15.576 --> 00:31:17.936 A:middle
If I keep the radius high and

00:31:18.116 --> 00:31:19.766 A:middle
reduce the gamma value to a very

00:31:19.766 --> 00:31:22.186 A:middle
low number I create this halo

00:31:22.186 --> 00:31:22.756 A:middle
around my head.

00:31:23.406 --> 00:31:24.376 A:middle
So you can play with this to

00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:27.586 A:middle
create your own effects.

00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:31.266 A:middle
How do we implement this?

00:31:31.466 --> 00:31:33.026 A:middle
In Core Image it is very

00:31:33.026 --> 00:31:34.106 A:middle
straightforward, we can

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
concatenate three filters in a

00:31:35.896 --> 00:31:36.166 A:middle
row.

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.516 A:middle
We start with a Gaussian Blur,

00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:42.656 A:middle
we add the gamma adjustment, and

00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:44.446 A:middle
we upscale to the RGB

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:45.016 A:middle
resolution.

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:48.306 A:middle
But there are a couple of small

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.756 A:middle
points I want to emphasize as

00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:50.686 A:middle
best practices.

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.176 A:middle
Anytime you work with a

00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:55.696 A:middle
convolutional based operation

00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:57.436 A:middle
such as Gaussian Blurring the

00:31:57.436 --> 00:31:59.466 A:middle
best practice will be to start

00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:00.696 A:middle
by clamping to extent.

00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:00.696 A:middle
by clamping to extent.

00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:03.576 A:middle
By repeating the border pixels

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:06.446 A:middle
outwards we can make sure all

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.566 A:middle
the borders of the image are

00:32:07.566 --> 00:32:10.996 A:middle
handled correctly by the filter.

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:13.236 A:middle
Moreover, after the filtering

00:32:13.236 --> 00:32:14.616 A:middle
and just before the upscaling

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.286 A:middle
the best practice will be to

00:32:16.286 --> 00:32:18.386 A:middle
crop back to the original extent

00:32:18.886 --> 00:32:20.006 A:middle
because that's the part of the

00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.496 A:middle
image we really care about.

00:32:21.766 --> 00:32:25.816 A:middle
At this point we have an alpha

00:32:25.816 --> 00:32:27.766 A:middle
matte of the foreground and you

00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:29.096 A:middle
can use it to create different

00:32:29.096 --> 00:32:30.246 A:middle
kinds of effects for the

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:31.336 A:middle
background and the foreground

00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:33.006 A:middle
just like Emmanuel showed in the

00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:33.646 A:middle
first half.

00:32:34.076 --> 00:32:39.266 A:middle
In Backdrop, we blend the RGB

00:32:39.266 --> 00:32:41.136 A:middle
stream with a loaded background

00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:43.186 A:middle
image in a single line of Core

00:32:43.186 --> 00:32:45.016 A:middle
Image code using the alpha matte

00:32:45.016 --> 00:32:46.296 A:middle
we created from the TrueDepth

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.706 A:middle
camera to create this background

00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:50.236 A:middle
replacement effect.

00:32:53.996 --> 00:32:57.056 A:middle
So the TrueDepth camera gives us

00:32:58.046 --> 00:32:59.416 A:middle
a resolution of depth map of

00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:02.576 A:middle
640x480 coming at you 30 frames

00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:02.576 A:middle
640x480 coming at you 30 frames

00:33:02.576 --> 00:33:05.116 A:middle
a second, already registered to

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:05.936 A:middle
the video stream.

00:33:06.476 --> 00:33:09.496 A:middle
You can use it to create point

00:33:09.496 --> 00:33:10.776 A:middle
clouds and dynamically change

00:33:10.776 --> 00:33:12.426 A:middle
the perspective of the scene or

00:33:12.486 --> 00:33:16.066 A:middle
use the filter depth to create

00:33:16.336 --> 00:33:17.916 A:middle
different kinds of video

00:33:17.916 --> 00:33:18.486 A:middle
effects.

00:33:21.476 --> 00:33:22.986 A:middle
You can go to the webpage and

00:33:22.986 --> 00:33:25.176 A:middle
download the Jupiter Notebook

00:33:25.466 --> 00:33:28.576 A:middle
TrueDepth Streamer and Backdrop

00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:31.986 A:middle
and we hope it inspires you as a

00:33:31.986 --> 00:33:34.876 A:middle
starting point to many new cool

00:33:34.876 --> 00:33:37.056 A:middle
video effects to create in your

00:33:37.056 --> 00:33:37.776 A:middle
applications.

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:41.156 A:middle
Come say hi at the AVCapture

00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:42.456 A:middle
lab, thank you so much for your

00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:42.666 A:middle
time.

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:42.976 A:middle
Have a great day.

00:33:43.516 --> 00:33:46.500 A:middle
