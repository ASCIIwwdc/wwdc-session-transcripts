[ Music ]

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:22.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, good morning, thank

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.606 A:middle
you for coming.

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:27.876 A:middle
I'm going to be joined by some

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:29.156 A:middle
very bright people in a minute.

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:30.846 A:middle
We have some very cool stuff

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:34.066 A:middle
prepared for you today.

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:37.686 A:middle
So let me start first by saying

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:39.616 A:middle
if you never write code that

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:42.536 A:middle
crashes this session is not for

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:42.736 A:middle
you.

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:45.506 A:middle
This is a talk for the rest of

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.406 A:middle
us, for those of us who make

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:48.006 A:middle
mistakes.

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:51.316 A:middle
Today we're going to talk about

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:53.586 A:middle
the tools and techniques that

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.006 A:middle
you can use to stay on top of

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:56.646 A:middle
your crashes if they're

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:57.596 A:middle
affecting your users.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
In particular I'm going to cover

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
In particular I'm going to cover

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:02.496 A:middle
the fundamentals of crashes, why

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
do they happen, what do they

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.226 A:middle
look like.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.326 A:middle
Then I'm going to show you some

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:08.646 A:middle
of the tools that we have to

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:10.226 A:middle
access crash logs when they're

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:11.026 A:middle
occurring in the wild.

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:13.666 A:middle
Then Greg is going to come up

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.876 A:middle
and give you some more detail on

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:17.246 A:middle
how to read the content of a

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.186 A:middle
crash log.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.026 A:middle
And then he's going to go in

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:22.476 A:middle
depth in how to read a tricky

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.036 A:middle
memory issue with a crash log.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.686 A:middle
And then Kuba will show you how

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.426 A:middle
to catch threading races early,

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:29.446 A:middle
these threading races lead to

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.446 A:middle
crashes, and these crashes are

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:33.866 A:middle
very hard to reproduce.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.856 A:middle
So first we should define it,

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:37.316 A:middle
what is a crash?

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.206 A:middle
A crash is a sudden termination

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.406 A:middle
of your app when it attempts to

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:44.596 A:middle
do something that is not

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:44.986 A:middle
allowed.

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.296 A:middle
So what's not allowed?

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:49.386 A:middle
Well, sometimes it's impossible

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.626 A:middle
for the CPU to execute code, the

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:53.086 A:middle
CPU won't divide by zero.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:55.726 A:middle
Or sometimes it's the operating

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:56.976 A:middle
system that's enforcing some

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:57.516 A:middle
policy.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.216 A:middle
The operating system will

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.216 A:middle
The operating system will

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:01.986 A:middle
preserve the user experience by

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:03.886 A:middle
killing your app if it's taking

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.546 A:middle
too long to launch or it's using

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:08.256 A:middle
too much memory.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.476 A:middle
Sometimes the programming

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:11.476 A:middle
language you're using is trying

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.006 A:middle
to prevent a failure and will

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:13.896 A:middle
trigger a crash.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.596 A:middle
A Swift array and NSArray will

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:18.156 A:middle
halt your process if you attempt

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:19.146 A:middle
to go outside of your array

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:19.586 A:middle
bounds.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.586 A:middle
Or sometimes it's you, the

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:23.536 A:middle
developer that's trying to

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:24.276 A:middle
prevent a failure.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.756 A:middle
You may have an API where you

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:28.446 A:middle
assert is a parameter is non nil

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:30.726 A:middle
and that's perfectly all right.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:33.546 A:middle
So stop me if you've seen this

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.686 A:middle
before, this is what it looks

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:38.396 A:middle
like in Xcode in the debugger

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:39.786 A:middle
when the debugger is attached to

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:41.806 A:middle
your app and has paused the

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:43.346 A:middle
process just before your app is

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:43.876 A:middle
terminated.

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:46.396 A:middle
And let's take a closer look at

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:47.566 A:middle
this backtrace on the left.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:51.386 A:middle
You can see here how the app was

00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:52.986 A:middle
started by the operating system

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.446 A:middle
and while we're paused we can

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:56.636 A:middle
see how the main function was

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.466 A:middle
called and functions are calling

00:02:58.466 --> 00:02:59.756 A:middle
other functions within your app

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.946 A:middle
and eventually we get to this

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.756 A:middle
point where we hit a point where

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:05.926 A:middle
in your code where the only

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.236 A:middle
option is to crash, something

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:08.006 A:middle
has gone wrong.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.516 A:middle
And ultimately the debugger

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.126 A:middle
receives a signal that this app

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:14.986 A:middle
is about to crash and pauses the

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:16.106 A:middle
app.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:18.326 A:middle
Now sometimes you're not always

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:19.686 A:middle
conveniently attached with the

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:20.886 A:middle
debugger like we are here.

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:23.006 A:middle
When you're not attached with

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
the debugger the operating

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
system will capture this

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.666 A:middle
backtrace in plaintext and save

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.976 A:middle
it out to disk in a human

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.056 A:middle
readable crash log.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.906 A:middle
Now the truth is one a release

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:36.226 A:middle
build of your app crashes the

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:37.476 A:middle
log doesn't actually look this

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:37.996 A:middle
pretty.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.726 A:middle
What's actually written out is a

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.266 A:middle
list of binary names and

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:41.636 A:middle
addresses.

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:43.266 A:middle
This is a snippet from a

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.626 A:middle
unsymbolicated crash log.

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:47.566 A:middle
Now thankfully Xcode takes care

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.146 A:middle
of symbolicating crash logs so

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.256 A:middle
that what you'll see are those

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:51.846 A:middle
pretty function names, file

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:53.386 A:middle
names and line numbers that

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:54.006 A:middle
you're familiar with.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
So there are a number of ways to

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
access these crash logs.

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
access these crash logs.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.416 A:middle
I'd like first to talk about how

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:03.926 A:middle
you can access those crash logs

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.156 A:middle
from your beta testers on

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.976 A:middle
TestFlight and your customers on

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:07.476 A:middle
the App Store.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.326 A:middle
You can download these crash

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:12.196 A:middle
logs using a feature in Xcode

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.116 A:middle
called the Crashes Organizer,

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.896 A:middle
this is what it looks like a

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:16.786 A:middle
beautiful dark mode.

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:19.226 A:middle
And let's take a tour through

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:19.546 A:middle
this UI.

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.816 A:middle
On the left, you can see all of

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
your apps distributed over

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.756 A:middle
TestFlight and the App Store and

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:27.676 A:middle
we support all of our platforms

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.796 A:middle
including watchOS and app

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:30.366 A:middle
extensions.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:33.586 A:middle
On the right, for a given crash

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.266 A:middle
point you can see the number of

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.196 A:middle
unique devices affected and we

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.956 A:middle
group crash logs by similar

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.886 A:middle
issue, by similar crash point

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:43.536 A:middle
and we rank them in the source

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:44.756 A:middle
list by the number of unique

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:45.596 A:middle
devices affected.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:48.056 A:middle
And you can page through a

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:49.626 A:middle
sampling of the individual logs

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:50.536 A:middle
down below.

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
And when you click on this

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:55.006 A:middle
button you can open the crash

00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:56.546 A:middle
log in your project, in the

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.826 A:middle
debug navigator and see it

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.076 A:middle
alongside your source code.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
This is very cool if you haven't

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
This is very cool if you haven't

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.756 A:middle
seen it before, we'll see that

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:02.426 A:middle
in a bit.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.456 A:middle
And in the detailed view of

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:05.686 A:middle
course we show you a fully

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:07.636 A:middle
symbolicated backtrace with the

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:08.606 A:middle
crash point highlighted.

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:10.496 A:middle
So now that we have the lay of

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:12.286 A:middle
the land let's play with it.

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:16.866 A:middle
So I have Xcode open here and

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:18.096 A:middle
I'm going to open up the

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:21.396 A:middle
Organizer window and you can see

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:22.716 A:middle
that I've selected the Crashes

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.096 A:middle
tab, that's the second tab here

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.276 A:middle
and I've selected this chocolate

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:27.516 A:middle
chip app that Kuba and I are

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:28.086 A:middle
working on.

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
And I've uploaded this build to

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:32.916 A:middle
TestFlight and you can see I'm

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
looking at build 5 right now and

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
a number of testers are

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:38.046 A:middle
reporting crashes, so that's not

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:38.566 A:middle
too good.

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:39.756 A:middle
But I've worked on a couple of

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.766 A:middle
these crashes you can see, but

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:42.996 A:middle
this first one I haven't worked

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.296 A:middle
on yet so let's try to resolve

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:45.246 A:middle
that.

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:48.746 A:middle
So this is affecting 242 devices

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:50.446 A:middle
and I can see the backtrace that

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:51.846 A:middle
was captured from the time that

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.136 A:middle
the app crashed and the crash

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:53.956 A:middle
point highlighted.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:55.976 A:middle
Now I'm not quite sure what's

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.136 A:middle
going on yet but I bet if I open

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
this crash log in our source

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
this crash log in our source

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.406 A:middle
code I can reason about what's

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:01.966 A:middle
going on.

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:03.526 A:middle
So I'm going to click the Open

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.796 A:middle
in Project button, select the

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:07.286 A:middle
project that matches build 5 of

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.126 A:middle
my app and what I do, what you

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:12.146 A:middle
can see is that this crash log

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:13.296 A:middle
has opened up in the debug

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.096 A:middle
navigator as if this app has

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:15.806 A:middle
just crashed.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:17.796 A:middle
And you can see here that we're

00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:19.296 A:middle
stopped on this fatal error.

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:22.416 A:middle
So a good question to ask myself

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.916 A:middle
is, is this a valid use of fatal

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.106 A:middle
error, I only want to be

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
crashing if it's absolutely

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:26.936 A:middle
necessary.

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:31.136 A:middle
So I can see that this is an

00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.846 A:middle
initializer of an enum from an

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:36.756 A:middle
int and that enum can only be

00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:38.886 A:middle
zero or one, if it's not I'll

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:39.796 A:middle
hit this fatal error.

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:41.126 A:middle
So I think that this makes

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:42.136 A:middle
sense, this should only be

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:43.796 A:middle
crashing if there's some kind of

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:45.086 A:middle
misuse by the programmer.

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:48.856 A:middle
So I can see the caller of this

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:50.476 A:middle
initializer if I navigate up the

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:53.076 A:middle
call stack here and I can see

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:54.396 A:middle
it's this tableView delegate

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:54.836 A:middle
method.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.666 A:middle
This method is asking for a

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.226 A:middle
title for a header in a given

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
section number.

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
So it must be that that section

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
So it must be that that section

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
number is not zero or one.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:03.636 A:middle
So I think I have a better

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
understanding of what's going

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:06.516 A:middle
on, but let's try to reproduce

00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:08.036 A:middle
this issue in the app and see if

00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:08.736 A:middle
we can learn more.

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:11.606 A:middle
So I've hit play.

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.386 A:middle
And Chocolate Chip is a recipe

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:14.656 A:middle
app I store all of my favorite

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:17.246 A:middle
recipes and I've been testing

00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:18.586 A:middle
with this whipped cream recipe

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:19.996 A:middle
and you can see everything's

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.386 A:middle
fine, I can see my list of

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:22.866 A:middle
ingredients, my list of steps.

00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:23.796 A:middle
These are the two recipe

00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:25.376 A:middle
sections, that's ingredients

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.886 A:middle
that's section zero and steps

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:27.686 A:middle
that's section one.

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:30.696 A:middle
And if I click on another recipe

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:33.456 A:middle
we've hit a crash and what I can

00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:35.056 A:middle
see is that we're stopped on the

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:37.296 A:middle
same fatal error and the

00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
backtrace looks very similar to

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:40.206 A:middle
the crash log that we've been

00:07:40.206 --> 00:07:40.716 A:middle
looking at.

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.926 A:middle
So that's a very good sign that

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:43.026 A:middle
we're looking at the same issue.

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:44.676 A:middle
So I'm going to clear this crash

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:47.416 A:middle
log by hitting delete and let's

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:49.096 A:middle
look at this debug session.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.006 A:middle
So in this fatal error I can see

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.626 A:middle
that the message is nicely

00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:55.166 A:middle
printing out that the section

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:55.886 A:middle
number is eight.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:56.936 A:middle
So that's the reason we're

00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.456 A:middle
crashing it's not zero or one.

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.666 A:middle
And what's occurring to me now

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.666 A:middle
And what's occurring to me now

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.936 A:middle
is that this is my fault, when I

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
implemented this class I

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.246 A:middle
implemented another delegate

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:08.086 A:middle
method called numberOfSections.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:10.696 A:middle
And numberOfSections is saying

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:12.326 A:middle
how many headers it should look

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.036 A:middle
for and what I'm returning here

00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
is the number of ingredients and

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.246 A:middle
the ingredients count is eight.

00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:19.576 A:middle
But believe it or not I have a

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:21.216 A:middle
clever way to solve this.

00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:22.356 A:middle
I know what I want to be

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:24.086 A:middle
returning is the number of cases

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.186 A:middle
in this recipe section enum and

00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:28.396 A:middle
I know that in Swift 4.2 some

00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:30.736 A:middle
new functionality was added by

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.035 A:middle
the Swift Open Source Community,

00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:33.885 A:middle
thank you very much, a protocol

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:35.176 A:middle
called CaseIterable.

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:37.236 A:middle
If I have my recipe section

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:40.596 A:middle
conformed to CaseIterable I can

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:41.655 A:middle
reimplement this number of

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.956 A:middle
sections to return the count of

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.266 A:middle
all the cases in that recipe

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:47.186 A:middle
section enum.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:49.876 A:middle
And that way what I'll be

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:51.876 A:middle
returning is two, I'll be

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:53.376 A:middle
returning the number of accurate

00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:53.956 A:middle
sections.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:55.626 A:middle
This is going to work out just

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:56.886 A:middle
great.

00:08:57.056 --> 00:08:59.226 A:middle
So now if I check out this

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:00.986 A:middle
chocolate chip cookies recipe no

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:00.986 A:middle
chocolate chip cookies recipe no

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:02.736 A:middle
crash, I see all of my

00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:04.066 A:middle
ingredients and my steps.

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:06.166 A:middle
I did a very good job, I'm very

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:07.196 A:middle
pleased with myself.

00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:10.076 A:middle
And I can go back to the

00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:12.016 A:middle
Organizer and mark this issue as

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:13.666 A:middle
resolved, step away from the

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:15.296 A:middle
computer and get back to my

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:15.636 A:middle
baking.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.816 A:middle
Okay so you've just see how you

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:27.256 A:middle
can use the Crashes Organizer to

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
download crash logs from

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:30.916 A:middle
TestFlight, open the log in your

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:32.616 A:middle
source code, and resolve an

00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:32.876 A:middle
issue.

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.546 A:middle
So what do you need to do to get

00:09:35.606 --> 00:09:36.056 A:middle
started?

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.116 A:middle
Very simple, your customers if

00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:41.256 A:middle
they opt into sharing with

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:42.676 A:middle
third-party developers this just

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:43.896 A:middle
works, their crash logs are

00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:44.816 A:middle
uploaded automatically.

00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:47.966 A:middle
All you need to do is sign into

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:50.026 A:middle
Xcode with your Apple ID.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.576 A:middle
When you upload your app you

00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:53.826 A:middle
should include symbols so that

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.966 A:middle
you get server-side

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:57.226 A:middle
symbolication of your crash

00:09:57.836 --> 00:09:57.976 A:middle
logs.

00:09:58.226 --> 00:09:59.926 A:middle
And open up the Organizer window

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
to the Crashes tab to start

00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
to the Crashes tab to start

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
viewing those crashes.

00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:07.036 A:middle
Okay so we have covered viewing

00:10:07.036 --> 00:10:08.166 A:middle
crashes in the Organizer.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:10.736 A:middle
But if you're not distributing

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.586 A:middle
over TestFlight or the App Store

00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:13.606 A:middle
there are a couple of other

00:10:13.606 --> 00:10:14.376 A:middle
options for you.

00:10:15.246 --> 00:10:17.246 A:middle
There is the devices window.

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:19.996 A:middle
When you have a device connected

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:21.576 A:middle
you can click this View Logs

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:23.326 A:middle
button and will show you all the

00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:24.436 A:middle
logs that are saved on that

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:25.936 A:middle
device and these logs are

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:27.346 A:middle
symbolicated using the local

00:10:27.346 --> 00:10:29.306 A:middle
symbol information on your Mac.

00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:31.706 A:middle
When you run your [inaudible]

00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:34.796 A:middle
tests with Xcode, Xcode Server

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:37.766 A:middle
or Xcode Build the test results

00:10:37.816 --> 00:10:39.196 A:middle
bundle will include any of the

00:10:39.196 --> 00:10:40.706 A:middle
crash logs that come from your

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.346 A:middle
app that are written out during

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:43.716 A:middle
the execution of that test run

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.066 A:middle
and that's very convenient and

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:46.676 A:middle
these crash logs are also

00:10:46.676 --> 00:10:47.316 A:middle
symbolicated.

00:10:47.816 --> 00:10:50.786 A:middle
You can use the Mac Console app

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:53.096 A:middle
to view any crash logs from your

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:54.226 A:middle
Mac or from the Simulator.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:57.336 A:middle
And on the device under

00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:59.816 A:middle
Settings, Privacy, Analytics,

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Analytics Data you can see all

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Analytics Data you can see all

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:02.516 A:middle
of the logs that are saved to

00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:04.556 A:middle
disk and your users can share a

00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:08.506 A:middle
log directly from this screen.

00:11:08.696 --> 00:11:11.246 A:middle
Okay so to ensure that

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:13.106 A:middle
symbolication just works I have

00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:14.766 A:middle
three important best practices

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:15.066 A:middle
for you.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:18.816 A:middle
Number one, if you use the

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.806 A:middle
Crashes Organizer upload your

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:21.866 A:middle
symbols with your app.

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:23.906 A:middle
This is the default, this will

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:25.036 A:middle
ensure that server-side

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.166 A:middle
symbolication works, it's very

00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:27.826 A:middle
easy.

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:31.656 A:middle
Number two, be sure to save your

00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:32.546 A:middle
app archives.

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.956 A:middle
Your archive contains a copy of

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:37.736 A:middle
your debug symbols, your .

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:39.576 A:middle
Xcode uses Spotlight to find

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:41.236 A:middle
these dSYMs and to perform local

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:42.426 A:middle
symbolication when it's

00:11:42.426 --> 00:11:43.486 A:middle
necessary automatically.

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:47.526 A:middle
And if you upload an app that

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:49.906 A:middle
contains bitcode you should use

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.706 A:middle
the Archives Organizer Download

00:11:51.706 --> 00:11:53.916 A:middle
Debug Symbols button to download

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:55.376 A:middle
any dSYMs that come from a

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:56.916 A:middle
store-side bitcode compilation.

00:11:57.476 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
Okay we've covered all the tools

00:11:57.476 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
Okay we've covered all the tools

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.876 A:middle
that we offer for accessing

00:12:02.876 --> 00:12:04.106 A:middle
crash logs when they occur in

00:12:04.106 --> 00:12:04.506 A:middle
the field.

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:06.346 A:middle
Now to give you an in-depth

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:07.916 A:middle
guide into reading the content

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:09.716 A:middle
of a crash log please give a

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:10.836 A:middle
warm welcome to the helping,

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:11.936 A:middle
friendly Greg Parker.

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:17.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:18.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chris.

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.936 A:middle
So we've just seen how you can

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:23.986 A:middle
use Xcode to find crashes and to

00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:26.356 A:middle
examine them in the Xcode tools

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:27.086 A:middle
in the debugger.

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:30.336 A:middle
But the crash log file contains

00:12:30.336 --> 00:12:32.276 A:middle
more information, it contains

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:33.806 A:middle
much more information than just

00:12:33.806 --> 00:12:34.666 A:middle
the stack trace.

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:37.306 A:middle
It is frequently useful to look

00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:39.096 A:middle
at that extra information in

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:40.466 A:middle
order to debug your problem.

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:43.626 A:middle
So how can you get the full text

00:12:43.626 --> 00:12:44.396 A:middle
of a crash log?

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:47.166 A:middle
Here's our Xcode Organizer, if

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.186 A:middle
we bring up the contextual menu

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.096 A:middle
there's a Show In Finder button.

00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:53.216 A:middle
The Show In Finder button will

00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:54.816 A:middle
bring up a text file which we

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.526 A:middle
can open up in the Console app

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.706 A:middle
or your favorite text editor, it

00:12:58.706 --> 00:12:59.996 A:middle
looks something like this.

00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.576 A:middle
So what's in this file, let's

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.116 A:middle
take a look.

00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:05.506 A:middle
The top of the file starts with

00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:07.866 A:middle
some summary information, this

00:13:07.866 --> 00:13:09.496 A:middle
contains your app name, the

00:13:09.496 --> 00:13:11.646 A:middle
version number, the operating

00:13:11.646 --> 00:13:13.096 A:middle
system version it was running

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:14.846 A:middle
on, and the date and time of the

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
crash.

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:18.496 A:middle
Below that we have the reason

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:19.416 A:middle
for the crash.

00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:21.706 A:middle
This was the specific error, the

00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:23.436 A:middle
specific signal that the

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.186 A:middle
operating system sent to kill

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
the process.

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.856 A:middle
We can also see some logging

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:30.856 A:middle
information, the

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
application-specific information

00:13:33.056 --> 00:13:33.626 A:middle
section.

00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:35.486 A:middle
This section will include

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:38.146 A:middle
console logs in some cases, if

00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:39.786 A:middle
you have an unhandled exception

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.056 A:middle
it may include the exception

00:13:41.056 --> 00:13:41.816 A:middle
backtrace.

00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.536 A:middle
This section is not always

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.746 A:middle
available, on iOS devices it is

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:49.516 A:middle
often hidden for personal

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:50.706 A:middle
privacy reasons.

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:53.296 A:middle
But on Simulator to macOS this

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:55.226 A:middle
section can include information

00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:55.766 A:middle
that is useful.

00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:58.906 A:middle
Below that we have the thread

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
stacks, these were the

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
stacks, these were the

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:02.166 A:middle
backtraces of all the threads

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:03.276 A:middle
that were running at the time of

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:03.906 A:middle
the crash.

00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:05.666 A:middle
One of them is marked as the

00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:08.436 A:middle
crash thread and we also have

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:09.526 A:middle
whatever other threads were

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.196 A:middle
running at the time that the

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.056 A:middle
process died.

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:15.676 A:middle
Below that we have some

00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:17.326 A:middle
low-level information, we have

00:14:17.376 --> 00:14:19.806 A:middle
the register state of the thread

00:14:19.806 --> 00:14:21.916 A:middle
that crashed and we have the

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:23.816 A:middle
binary images that were loaded

00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:25.196 A:middle
into the process.

00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:27.046 A:middle
This is the application

00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:28.686 A:middle
executable and all the other

00:14:28.686 --> 00:14:29.666 A:middle
libraries.

00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:32.176 A:middle
And Xcode uses this for

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
symbolication in order to look

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.306 A:middle
up the symbols, the files and

00:14:37.306 --> 00:14:38.866 A:middle
line number information for the

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:39.656 A:middle
stack traces.

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:42.576 A:middle
So that's the content of a crash

00:14:42.576 --> 00:14:43.156 A:middle
log file.

00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:45.696 A:middle
So how do we debug this, how do

00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:47.026 A:middle
we read this, what do we look

00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:47.306 A:middle
at?

00:14:48.446 --> 00:14:51.066 A:middle
We start with the crash reason,

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:52.316 A:middle
the exception type.

00:14:53.156 --> 00:14:54.736 A:middle
In this case, the exception type

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:56.796 A:middle
is an EXC bad instruction

00:14:56.856 --> 00:15:00.816 A:middle
exception, the SIGILL signal was

00:14:56.856 --> 00:15:00.816 A:middle
exception, the SIGILL signal was

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:02.536 A:middle
the illegal instruction signal.

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:05.396 A:middle
That means the CPU was trying to

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.276 A:middle
execute an instruction that does

00:15:07.276 --> 00:15:09.546 A:middle
not exist or is invalid for some

00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:10.916 A:middle
reason and that's why the

00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:12.026 A:middle
process died.

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:16.636 A:middle
We can also look at the thread

00:15:16.746 --> 00:15:18.946 A:middle
that crashed, what code was

00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:19.806 A:middle
running at the time of the

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:20.196 A:middle
crash.

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:22.966 A:middle
Here we see the fatal error

00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:25.076 A:middle
message function in the Swift

00:15:25.886 --> 00:15:26.426 A:middle
runtime.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.256 A:middle
No guesses as to what the fatal

00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:29.556 A:middle
error message function does.

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:33.046 A:middle
The error message in this case

00:15:33.046 --> 00:15:33.986 A:middle
is included in the

00:15:33.986 --> 00:15:35.206 A:middle
application-specific

00:15:35.206 --> 00:15:37.696 A:middle
information, so we can see what

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:39.726 A:middle
the Swift runtime printed as the

00:15:39.726 --> 00:15:40.836 A:middle
process exited.

00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:46.536 A:middle
So let's take a closer look at

00:15:46.536 --> 00:15:48.476 A:middle
that stack trace.

00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:50.276 A:middle
We saw the fatal error message

00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:53.806 A:middle
function and that was called by

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
a function in our code.

00:15:55.396 --> 00:15:57.736 A:middle
We have a recipe class, an image

00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:01.356 A:middle
function being called and that

00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:01.356 A:middle
function being called and that

00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:03.116 A:middle
function in turn called fatal

00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:04.736 A:middle
error message as a result of

00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
some error.

00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:08.736 A:middle
Because this is a symbolicated

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.426 A:middle
stack trace with full debug

00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:12.376 A:middle
information we have a file and

00:16:12.376 --> 00:16:14.856 A:middle
line number in our code of what

00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:15.566 A:middle
the crash was.

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:17.856 A:middle
So we can take a look at that

00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:19.506 A:middle
line, we can open up our

00:16:19.506 --> 00:16:20.706 A:middle
project, this is

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:24.316 A:middle
RecipeImage.swift, line 26 was

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.276 A:middle
the one that was marked in the

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:25.806 A:middle
crash.

00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:27.926 A:middle
And those of you who are

00:16:27.926 --> 00:16:29.436 A:middle
experienced Swift programmers

00:16:29.436 --> 00:16:31.066 A:middle
will have a pretty good guess as

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.896 A:middle
to why this line might crash.

00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:36.836 A:middle
We have a force unwrap operator.

00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:40.076 A:middle
We have a function, The UIImage

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:41.516 A:middle
Constructor which returns an

00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:42.746 A:middle
optional value.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.696 A:middle
If the optional value is nil the

00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:48.596 A:middle
force unwrap operator will halt

00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:50.726 A:middle
the process, generate a crash

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.186 A:middle
log and exit.

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:54.856 A:middle
If we remember the

00:16:54.856 --> 00:16:56.906 A:middle
application-specific information

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.926 A:middle
it included the error message

00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:01.256 A:middle
that the Swift runtime prints as

00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:01.256 A:middle
that the Swift runtime prints as

00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:03.516 A:middle
this error check fails and it

00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:05.415 A:middle
says, unexpectedly found nil

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:06.906 A:middle
while unwrapping an optional

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
value.

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:10.076 A:middle
So that's good, that's

00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:12.685 A:middle
consistent with the code.

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:14.705 A:middle
We have a force unwrap operator

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
on line 26, we have an error

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:19.366 A:middle
message in the crash log that

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:20.675 A:middle
says we were unwrapping an

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:21.586 A:middle
optional value.

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
This all makes sense as a

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:25.116 A:middle
consistent story for what caused

00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:25.856 A:middle
this crash.

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:32.096 A:middle
So a force unwrap failure is an

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:34.166 A:middle
example of a precondition or an

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.576 A:middle
assertion in the code.

00:17:36.376 --> 00:17:38.156 A:middle
Preconditions and assertions are

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.906 A:middle
error checks that deliberately

00:17:39.906 --> 00:17:41.946 A:middle
stop the process when an error

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:42.366 A:middle
occurs.

00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:45.116 A:middle
Some examples of this are of

00:17:45.116 --> 00:17:47.056 A:middle
course the force unwrap of an

00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:48.176 A:middle
optional that we just saw.

00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:50.596 A:middle
The Swift runtime will assert

00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:53.506 A:middle
that the optional is not nil and

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:54.386 A:middle
crash if it is.

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:56.746 A:middle
We have out-of-bounds

00:17:56.746 --> 00:17:58.556 A:middle
Swift.Array access is another

00:17:58.596 --> 00:17:59.976 A:middle
example.

00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:02.146 A:middle
If you access an array and your

00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:02.146 A:middle
If you access an array and your

00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:04.156 A:middle
index is out-of-bounds the Swift

00:18:04.156 --> 00:18:06.096 A:middle
runtime will fail, interim check

00:18:06.096 --> 00:18:07.866 A:middle
it will fail a precondition and

00:18:07.866 --> 00:18:08.826 A:middle
halt the process.

00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:12.126 A:middle
Swift arithmetic overflow also

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:14.106 A:middle
contains assertions, if you're

00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:15.866 A:middle
adding two numbers together and

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:17.256 A:middle
the result is too large for an

00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:18.826 A:middle
integer variable there is a

00:18:18.826 --> 00:18:20.256 A:middle
precondition for that, the

00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:22.396 A:middle
process will halt.

00:18:22.906 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
Uncaught exceptions are

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:25.936 A:middle
frequently caused by

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.026 A:middle
preconditions in the code.

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.216 A:middle
There are many error checks

00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:32.386 A:middle
where if the precondition fails

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.446 A:middle
it will throw an exception and

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.036 A:middle
if the exception is not caught

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:38.046 A:middle
the uncaught exception will

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:39.506 A:middle
cause a crash log.

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:41.926 A:middle
And of course you can write

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:43.886 A:middle
assertions and preconditions in

00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:46.336 A:middle
your own code if you have errors

00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:47.696 A:middle
that you want to crash the

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:49.736 A:middle
process and generate a crash log

00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:50.556 A:middle
in response.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.716 A:middle
Another example of a crash log

00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:57.046 A:middle
is a case where the operating

00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:59.416 A:middle
system kills your process from

00:18:59.446 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
the outside.

00:18:59.446 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
the outside.

00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:03.786 A:middle
An example of this are watchdog

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:05.836 A:middle
events, such as timeouts.

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:07.716 A:middle
If your application takes too

00:19:07.716 --> 00:19:09.606 A:middle
long to do something the

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.216 A:middle
operating system may detect

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:13.206 A:middle
that, kill the process of

00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:15.056 A:middle
generate a particular crash log

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:15.826 A:middle
as it does so.

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:18.996 A:middle
Environmental conditions can

00:19:18.996 --> 00:19:20.746 A:middle
also cause the operating system

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:21.786 A:middle
to halt the process.

00:19:21.886 --> 00:19:24.256 A:middle
If the device is overheating the

00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:25.506 A:middle
operating system will kill

00:19:25.506 --> 00:19:26.866 A:middle
processes that are using too

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:27.726 A:middle
much CPU.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:29.336 A:middle
If the device is running out of

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.196 A:middle
memory the operating system will

00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:32.656 A:middle
kill processes that are using

00:19:32.656 --> 00:19:33.406 A:middle
lots of memory.

00:19:34.936 --> 00:19:36.766 A:middle
Another case is an invalid code

00:19:36.766 --> 00:19:37.376 A:middle
signature.

00:19:37.816 --> 00:19:39.486 A:middle
The operating system enforces

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:41.936 A:middle
that code be signed and if a

00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:43.686 A:middle
signature is invalid or the code

00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:45.646 A:middle
is unsigned the operating system

00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:47.176 A:middle
will kill the process and

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:48.586 A:middle
generate a particular type of

00:19:48.586 --> 00:19:49.186 A:middle
crash log.

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.226 A:middle
These terminations by the

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:53.896 A:middle
operating system can be found in

00:19:53.896 --> 00:19:55.596 A:middle
the Devices window in Xcode,

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:57.016 A:middle
they can be found on the macOS

00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:57.676 A:middle
console.

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.296 A:middle
They do not always appear in the

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.296 A:middle
They do not always appear in the

00:20:00.296 --> 00:20:02.446 A:middle
Xcode Organizer, so be careful

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:02.726 A:middle
of that.

00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:06.706 A:middle
In Apple's developer

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:09.186 A:middle
documentation we have a technote

00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:10.936 A:middle
that describes many different

00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:13.136 A:middle
signatures and structures of

00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:14.926 A:middle
crash logs like these particular

00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
examples, what they look like,

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:19.206 A:middle
how you can recognize them, and

00:20:19.206 --> 00:20:20.536 A:middle
it goes into much more detail

00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:21.796 A:middle
than we have time for here.

00:20:23.026 --> 00:20:24.676 A:middle
But let's look at one example,

00:20:25.426 --> 00:20:27.236 A:middle
here's another crash log file

00:20:27.776 --> 00:20:29.896 A:middle
and again in order to understand

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.166 A:middle
the crash log we start with the

00:20:31.166 --> 00:20:32.216 A:middle
crash reason.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:34.426 A:middle
In this case the crash reason is

00:20:34.426 --> 00:20:37.226 A:middle
in EXC crash exception with the

00:20:37.226 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
SIGKILL signal.

00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:41.766 A:middle
The SIGKILL signal is commonly

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:43.836 A:middle
used when the operating system

00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:45.466 A:middle
wants to stop your process.

00:20:46.016 --> 00:20:48.386 A:middle
It sends the SIGKILL signal, the

00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:50.056 A:middle
SIGKILL signal cannot be

00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:51.706 A:middle
handled, it cannot be caught by

00:20:51.706 --> 00:20:53.846 A:middle
your process, it will die in

00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:54.856 A:middle
response to this signal.

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.446 A:middle
We can also see the reason the

00:20:58.446 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
operating system sent the signal

00:20:58.446 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
operating system sent the signal

00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
in the crash log.

00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:02.656 A:middle
In this case we have a

00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.626 A:middle
termination reason with a code

00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:05.966 A:middle
ate bad food.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.126 A:middle
If you look in the developer

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.986 A:middle
technote I mentioned earlier, it

00:21:09.986 --> 00:21:11.976 A:middle
will describe what ate bad food

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:12.566 A:middle
means.

00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:14.186 A:middle
And we have a textual

00:21:14.186 --> 00:21:16.506 A:middle
description that says exhausted

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:18.596 A:middle
real clock time allowance of

00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:20.506 A:middle
19.95 seconds.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.276 A:middle
So if we combine this

00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.936 A:middle
information with the information

00:21:23.936 --> 00:21:25.416 A:middle
in the technote it will tell us

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:28.526 A:middle
our application took too long to

00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:29.076 A:middle
launch.

00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
We had 20 seconds to launch, we

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:32.966 A:middle
weren't done in that much time,

00:21:33.386 --> 00:21:34.606 A:middle
the operating system killed the

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:35.266 A:middle
process.

00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.916 A:middle
Below we can see the crash logs

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:40.716 A:middle
at the time the process died.

00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:42.826 A:middle
It's possible that those crash

00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:44.626 A:middle
logs were the code that took too

00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:45.946 A:middle
long, maybe were stuck in an

00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:48.426 A:middle
infinite loop, maybe were stuck

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:49.896 A:middle
waiting for network I/O and

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:51.006 A:middle
that's why we took too long to

00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:51.506 A:middle
launch.

00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:54.026 A:middle
Or on the other hand, maybe this

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:55.916 A:middle
code is innocent and there's

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.426 A:middle
something earlier in the launch

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.076 A:middle
process that was too slow and

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
that's why the process died.

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
that's why the process died.

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:06.366 A:middle
So launch timeouts, how can you

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
avoid them.

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:08.716 A:middle
We want you to avoid them,

00:22:08.816 --> 00:22:10.626 A:middle
launch timeouts are a common

00:22:10.626 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
reason for app rejection during

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.536 A:middle
Apple's app review.

00:22:15.756 --> 00:22:17.256 A:middle
So how do you avoid this?

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.516 A:middle
Well test your app of course.

00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:23.316 A:middle
But there's a catch, the launch

00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:26.016 A:middle
timeout watchdog is disabled in

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:27.986 A:middle
the Simulator and it's disabled

00:22:27.986 --> 00:22:29.586 A:middle
in the debugger so if you're

00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:30.766 A:middle
doing all your testing in the

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.076 A:middle
Simulator and the debugger

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:33.356 A:middle
you'll never see watchdog

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:33.976 A:middle
timeouts.

00:22:35.206 --> 00:22:37.596 A:middle
So when you test your app be

00:22:37.596 --> 00:22:39.336 A:middle
sure to test without the

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:39.906 A:middle
debugger.

00:22:40.346 --> 00:22:42.416 A:middle
If you're a macOS app launch

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.406 A:middle
your app in the Finder.

00:22:43.786 --> 00:22:46.456 A:middle
If you're an iOS app run in

00:22:46.456 --> 00:22:48.776 A:middle
TestFlight or launch your app

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:50.726 A:middle
using the iOS App Launcher.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:52.656 A:middle
All of these will run your app

00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:54.526 A:middle
outside the debugger and the

00:22:54.526 --> 00:22:56.286 A:middle
launch timeouts will be enabled

00:22:56.286 --> 00:22:57.026 A:middle
and enforced.

00:22:58.426 --> 00:22:59.966 A:middle
When you test, test on a real

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
device of course, test outside

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
device of course, test outside

00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:02.376 A:middle
of Simulators.

00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:06.096 A:middle
And test your devices with older

00:23:06.096 --> 00:23:08.026 A:middle
hardware, whatever's the oldest

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.826 A:middle
hardware you want your app to

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:10.386 A:middle
support.

00:23:11.026 --> 00:23:12.636 A:middle
If you test only on newer

00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:14.076 A:middle
hardware you might find that

00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:16.236 A:middle
your app launches fast enough on

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:18.636 A:middle
a faster device, but slower

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.306 A:middle
devices might take too much

00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:20.646 A:middle
time.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:25.296 A:middle
So let's talk about another

00:23:25.296 --> 00:23:27.326 A:middle
class of errors, let's talk

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:28.836 A:middle
about memory errors and what

00:23:28.836 --> 00:23:31.116 A:middle
they look like in crash logs.

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:34.306 A:middle
When I say memory error I mean

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:37.076 A:middle
cases like reference counting of

00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:40.576 A:middle
an object being over-released or

00:23:40.726 --> 00:23:42.446 A:middle
using an object after it has

00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:45.936 A:middle
been freed or a buffer overflow

00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
where you have a byte array or

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.476 A:middle
another C array and you access

00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:51.926 A:middle
that array out-of-bounds.

00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.316 A:middle
So let's look at another crash

00:23:55.316 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
log and spoiler alert this one

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:58.746 A:middle
is a memory error.

00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
We start again with the

00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
We start again with the

00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:02.716 A:middle
exception type.

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:06.086 A:middle
This is an EXC bad access

00:24:06.086 --> 00:24:09.096 A:middle
exception, the SEG violation

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
signal.

00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:12.306 A:middle
This is typically caused by a

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:13.266 A:middle
memory error.

00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:15.396 A:middle
The bad access exception means

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:17.666 A:middle
one of two things, either we

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.586 A:middle
were writing to memory that is

00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:21.896 A:middle
read-only or we were reading

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:23.436 A:middle
from memory that does not exist

00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:23.896 A:middle
at all.

00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:25.936 A:middle
Either of those will cause a bad

00:24:25.936 --> 00:24:27.976 A:middle
access exception and the process

00:24:27.976 --> 00:24:28.516 A:middle
will stop.

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:32.256 A:middle
We see here the address that we

00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:34.256 A:middle
were accessing at the time of

00:24:35.076 --> 00:24:36.366 A:middle
the crash.

00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:38.416 A:middle
We can look at the stack trace,

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:39.346 A:middle
this is the function that

00:24:39.346 --> 00:24:40.946 A:middle
performed the bad access of

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:41.376 A:middle
course.

00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:43.736 A:middle
This is the objc release

00:24:43.736 --> 00:24:45.286 A:middle
function, it's part of the

00:24:45.286 --> 00:24:47.106 A:middle
implementation of reference

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:49.316 A:middle
counting in Objective-C and some

00:24:49.316 --> 00:24:50.386 A:middle
Swift objects.

00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:52.836 A:middle
So that again sounds like it's

00:24:52.836 --> 00:24:54.456 A:middle
likely to have been a memory

00:24:54.456 --> 00:24:55.646 A:middle
error that caused the bug.

00:24:57.126 --> 00:24:59.856 A:middle
So what code caused objc

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
release?

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
release?

00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:01.806 A:middle
We can look at the rest of the

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:02.636 A:middle
stack trace.

00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:05.286 A:middle
We have the object dispose

00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:07.526 A:middle
function, this is a function in

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:09.376 A:middle
the Objective-C runtime that is

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:11.176 A:middle
used to deallocate objects.

00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:14.086 A:middle
The object dispose function

00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:16.426 A:middle
called a function called ivar

00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:18.716 A:middle
destroyer on one of our classes,

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:20.956 A:middle
our LoginViewController class.

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:24.176 A:middle
The ivar destroyer function is

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:26.166 A:middle
part of Swift code, this is a

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.516 A:middle
function that cleans up the

00:25:27.516 --> 00:25:29.466 A:middle
properties, that cleans up the

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:31.776 A:middle
ivar storage of an object as it

00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:32.686 A:middle
is deallocated.

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.386 A:middle
So that gives us part of the

00:25:35.386 --> 00:25:36.966 A:middle
story as to what caused this

00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:37.446 A:middle
crash.

00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:39.856 A:middle
We were deallocating an object

00:25:39.946 --> 00:25:41.956 A:middle
of our login view controller

00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:42.526 A:middle
class.

00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:46.156 A:middle
That class in its d init code

00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:47.556 A:middle
was trying to clean up its

00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.816 A:middle
properties and its ivars and

00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:51.536 A:middle
while releasing one of those

00:25:51.536 --> 00:25:53.266 A:middle
properties we crashed.

00:25:53.266 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
So that gives us a little bit of

00:25:55.716 --> 00:25:56.876 A:middle
detail as to what went wrong.

00:25:56.906 --> 00:25:58.826 A:middle
Can we do better, is there more

00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.206 A:middle
information in the crash log

00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.206 A:middle
information in the crash log

00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:01.226 A:middle
that will tell us more about

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.906 A:middle
what happened?

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.256 A:middle
We can look at the invalid

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:08.356 A:middle
address itself, sometimes the

00:26:08.356 --> 00:26:10.966 A:middle
actual bad address value will

00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.856 A:middle
contain useful information in

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
it.

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.006 A:middle
And this particular bad address

00:26:16.006 --> 00:26:18.556 A:middle
I can tell you looks like a use

00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:19.536 A:middle
after free.

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:21.566 A:middle
Well how do I know that?

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:22.946 A:middle
Partly it's just long

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:24.336 A:middle
experience, when you read enough

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.246 A:middle
crash logs you start to learn

00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:28.316 A:middle
patterns of what the bad values

00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:28.736 A:middle
are.

00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:32.886 A:middle
This particular bad value looks

00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:35.296 A:middle
very much like the address range

00:26:35.296 --> 00:26:37.906 A:middle
for the malloc memory allocator

00:26:38.246 --> 00:26:39.416 A:middle
which we happen to have

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.966 A:middle
available in this crash log.

00:26:41.616 --> 00:26:43.196 A:middle
So we have the address range

00:26:43.196 --> 00:26:44.486 A:middle
that was used by the memory

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:46.656 A:middle
allocator and our invalid

00:26:46.656 --> 00:26:49.526 A:middle
address looks like it's inside

00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.836 A:middle
the malloc range, but it's been

00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:53.756 A:middle
shifted by 4 bits, it's been

00:26:53.756 --> 00:26:55.386 A:middle
rotated by 4 bits.

00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
So it looks like it was a valid

00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:59.686 A:middle
malloc address rotated.

00:27:01.426 --> 00:27:03.936 A:middle
That is a clue from the memory

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:05.266 A:middle
allocator itself.

00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:06.766 A:middle
Let me show you why that is.

00:27:07.556 --> 00:27:08.776 A:middle
Here's what our object looked

00:27:08.776 --> 00:27:10.756 A:middle
like when it was still valid.

00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:13.226 A:middle
An object starts with an isa

00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:15.516 A:middle
field, the isa field points to

00:27:15.516 --> 00:27:16.566 A:middle
the object's class.

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:19.146 A:middle
This is how Objective-C objects

00:27:19.146 --> 00:27:20.536 A:middle
are laid out, this is how some

00:27:20.536 --> 00:27:22.096 A:middle
swift objects are laid out.

00:27:22.736 --> 00:27:24.766 A:middle
So what does the objc release

00:27:24.766 --> 00:27:25.486 A:middle
function do?

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:28.776 A:middle
It reads the isa field and then

00:27:28.776 --> 00:27:30.796 A:middle
dreferences the isa field so it

00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:32.556 A:middle
can get to the class object and

00:27:32.556 --> 00:27:33.806 A:middle
perform method lookups.

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:37.206 A:middle
Ordinarily of course this works,

00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.176 A:middle
this is how it's supposed to

00:27:38.176 --> 00:27:38.456 A:middle
work.

00:27:39.346 --> 00:27:40.886 A:middle
What happens if our object has

00:27:40.956 --> 00:27:42.396 A:middle
already been freed.

00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:46.416 A:middle
When the free function deletes

00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.826 A:middle
an object it inserts it into a

00:27:49.826 --> 00:27:52.556 A:middle
free list of other dead objects.

00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:55.496 A:middle
And it writes a free list

00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:57.296 A:middle
pointer to the next object in

00:27:57.296 --> 00:27:59.356 A:middle
the list where the isa field

00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:00.036 A:middle
used to be.

00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:00.036 A:middle
used to be.

00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:03.836 A:middle
With one slight twist, it does

00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:05.146 A:middle
not write a pointer into that

00:28:05.146 --> 00:28:07.536 A:middle
field it writes a rotated

00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:08.986 A:middle
pointer into that field.

00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:10.956 A:middle
It wants to make sure that the

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:13.506 A:middle
value written there is not a

00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:16.016 A:middle
valid memory address precisely

00:28:16.016 --> 00:28:17.786 A:middle
so that bad use of the object

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:18.756 A:middle
will crash.

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:22.366 A:middle
So when objc release goes to

00:28:22.366 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
read the isa field it instead

00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.246 A:middle
gets a rotated free list

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:26.736 A:middle
pointer.

00:28:27.396 --> 00:28:29.056 A:middle
When it dreferences the rotated

00:28:29.056 --> 00:28:30.926 A:middle
free list pointer it crashes.

00:28:31.926 --> 00:28:33.296 A:middle
The memory allocator did that

00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:34.986 A:middle
for us, it deliberately rotated

00:28:34.986 --> 00:28:36.716 A:middle
that pointer to make sure we

00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:38.166 A:middle
would crash if we tried to use

00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:38.616 A:middle
it again.

00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
So that is the signature we see

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:43.196 A:middle
in this crash log.

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:45.716 A:middle
We had the invalid address field

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:48.536 A:middle
looks like a pointer in the

00:28:48.536 --> 00:28:50.686 A:middle
malloc region but rotated the

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:52.626 A:middle
same way that malloc rotates its

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:53.566 A:middle
free list pointers.

00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:56.076 A:middle
So that's a strong sign that

00:28:56.976 --> 00:28:58.706 A:middle
whatever object we are trying to

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.056 A:middle
release at this point in the

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.056 A:middle
release at this point in the

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:01.656 A:middle
code has already been

00:29:01.656 --> 00:29:03.606 A:middle
deallocated, that's the memory

00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:04.486 A:middle
error that occurred.

00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.006 A:middle
So that's additional detail of

00:29:08.186 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
what our story is.

00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:10.476 A:middle
We have our object being

00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:12.336 A:middle
deallocated, we're cleaning up

00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:14.916 A:middle
its ivars, one of those ivars

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:17.116 A:middle
was already a freed object and

00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:18.266 A:middle
that's what caused our crash.

00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:20.566 A:middle
Can we do better?

00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
Can we figure out which object

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
was being released by objc

00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:26.566 A:middle
release?

00:29:27.636 --> 00:29:29.806 A:middle
Ordinarily, the function calling

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.276 A:middle
objc release would give us a

00:29:31.326 --> 00:29:32.926 A:middle
clue as to what that was.

00:29:33.516 --> 00:29:35.166 A:middle
But the problem with the ivar

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:37.186 A:middle
destroyer function is it is a

00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:39.306 A:middle
compiler generated function.

00:29:39.876 --> 00:29:41.016 A:middle
We didn't write a function

00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:42.826 A:middle
called ivar destroyer, which

00:29:42.826 --> 00:29:44.476 A:middle
means there's no filename or

00:29:44.476 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
line number associated with this

00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:48.006 A:middle
point in the crash, we don't

00:29:48.006 --> 00:29:50.436 A:middle
know which of our properties was

00:29:50.436 --> 00:29:52.346 A:middle
being deallocated at that point.

00:29:53.326 --> 00:29:55.156 A:middle
Here's our class, we have three

00:29:55.156 --> 00:29:56.696 A:middle
properties in this class, we

00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:58.916 A:middle
have a username, a database, and

00:29:58.916 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
an array of views.

00:30:00.706 --> 00:30:02.536 A:middle
And at this point in our story

00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:03.846 A:middle
we don't know which of these

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:05.876 A:middle
objects was the one being

00:30:05.876 --> 00:30:06.926 A:middle
released, it could've been any

00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:08.316 A:middle
of them.

00:30:08.476 --> 00:30:10.396 A:middle
Can we do better, can we work

00:30:10.396 --> 00:30:13.146 A:middle
out which of those objects was

00:30:13.196 --> 00:30:14.966 A:middle
the one being released from the

00:30:14.966 --> 00:30:16.486 A:middle
information in the crash log

00:30:16.876 --> 00:30:18.206 A:middle
because of course if we can't

00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:19.856 A:middle
reproduce it in the debugger the

00:30:19.856 --> 00:30:21.306 A:middle
crash log is all we have to go

00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:21.426 A:middle
on?

00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:24.686 A:middle
In this case we can do better.

00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:30.006 A:middle
We can see a +42 where the file

00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
and line number would've been.

00:30:31.126 --> 00:30:35.306 A:middle
And the +42 is our clue because

00:30:35.306 --> 00:30:37.616 A:middle
the +42 is an offset in the

00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:39.446 A:middle
assembly code of the function.

00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:41.936 A:middle
We can disassemble the ivar

00:30:41.936 --> 00:30:43.876 A:middle
destroyer function, look at the

00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:46.636 A:middle
code and work out which property

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:49.206 A:middle
was being accessed at offset 42.

00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:51.526 A:middle
So how does that work?

00:30:51.956 --> 00:30:53.926 A:middle
We go into the debugger, into

00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:55.096 A:middle
the debugger console.

00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:58.026 A:middle
We can run lldb at a terminal.

00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:01.336 A:middle
We can run lldb in the Xcode

00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:01.336 A:middle
We can run lldb in the Xcode

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:02.886 A:middle
debug terminal.

00:31:04.306 --> 00:31:06.996 A:middle
The debugger has commands to

00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:09.856 A:middle
import a crash log a little bit

00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:13.396 A:middle
as if it crashed inside the

00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:14.056 A:middle
debugger.

00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:16.616 A:middle
So we run this command to load

00:31:16.896 --> 00:31:18.266 A:middle
the crash log interpretation

00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:21.026 A:middle
commands and then we run another

00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:23.756 A:middle
command to import our crash into

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:24.356 A:middle
the debugger.

00:31:25.286 --> 00:31:27.196 A:middle
So we want three things to make

00:31:27.196 --> 00:31:27.796 A:middle
this work.

00:31:28.076 --> 00:31:30.346 A:middle
We want a copy of our crash log

00:31:30.396 --> 00:31:33.176 A:middle
on the Mac, we also want a copy

00:31:33.176 --> 00:31:36.606 A:middle
of our app, and a copy of the

00:31:36.606 --> 00:31:38.246 A:middle
dSYM file that went with the

00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:41.076 A:middle
app, all of them matching this

00:31:41.076 --> 00:31:43.006 A:middle
crash log, all the same version

00:31:43.006 --> 00:31:43.566 A:middle
of our app.

00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:45.646 A:middle
So this is why we want you to

00:31:45.646 --> 00:31:47.596 A:middle
keep your app archives.

00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:49.796 A:middle
If we have all these files on

00:31:49.796 --> 00:31:51.716 A:middle
the Mac, we run the crash log

00:31:51.716 --> 00:31:54.956 A:middle
command, lldb uses Spotlight to

00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.656 A:middle
find the matching executable,

00:31:56.816 --> 00:31:58.426 A:middle
find the matching symbols, and

00:31:58.426 --> 00:31:59.956 A:middle
load it into the debugger.

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:02.696 A:middle
So we see the stack trace of our

00:32:02.696 --> 00:32:04.876 A:middle
crash thread, we see the file

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:06.036 A:middle
and line number information

00:32:06.036 --> 00:32:07.926 A:middle
where available, and now we can

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.526 A:middle
go to work.

00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:10.776 A:middle
Now we can find the address of

00:32:10.776 --> 00:32:13.036 A:middle
the ivar destroyer function and

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:15.306 A:middle
disassemble it.

00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:17.336 A:middle
This shows us the assembly code

00:32:17.616 --> 00:32:18.636 A:middle
of our function.

00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.646 A:middle
Now I don't have time to teach

00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:22.946 A:middle
you how to read assembly code,

00:32:23.436 --> 00:32:25.556 A:middle
but luckily for crash logs you

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.846 A:middle
don't actually have to be

00:32:27.006 --> 00:32:29.436 A:middle
completely fluent in reading

00:32:29.436 --> 00:32:30.346 A:middle
assembly code.

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.146 A:middle
It often is sufficient to be

00:32:32.146 --> 00:32:33.996 A:middle
able to skim the assembly code

00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:35.486 A:middle
and get a general idea of what

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:37.016 A:middle
is going on, you don't have to

00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:38.286 A:middle
understand every single

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:39.966 A:middle
instruction to be able to get

00:32:39.966 --> 00:32:41.656 A:middle
useful information out of a

00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:42.296 A:middle
crash log.

00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:45.626 A:middle
If we read through this function

00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.776 A:middle
and we know about the call

00:32:47.906 --> 00:32:50.106 A:middle
instruction and the jump

00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:51.876 A:middle
instruction which are how you

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:54.486 A:middle
call functions, we can separate

00:32:54.486 --> 00:32:56.606 A:middle
this code into three blocks.

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:00.566 A:middle
We have this top section which

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:00.566 A:middle
We have this top section which

00:33:00.566 --> 00:33:03.506 A:middle
is making a function call into a

00:33:03.506 --> 00:33:04.766 A:middle
reference count releasing

00:33:04.766 --> 00:33:06.446 A:middle
function and this one is

00:33:06.446 --> 00:33:08.656 A:middle
releasing our username property.

00:33:10.076 --> 00:33:12.346 A:middle
The next region is releasing the

00:33:12.346 --> 00:33:13.636 A:middle
database property.

00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:16.566 A:middle
And the next region is releasing

00:33:16.566 --> 00:33:17.876 A:middle
the views property.

00:33:18.966 --> 00:33:21.186 A:middle
So we don't understand what all

00:33:21.186 --> 00:33:22.766 A:middle
these instructions mean, but we

00:33:22.766 --> 00:33:24.576 A:middle
have a general sense of what

00:33:24.626 --> 00:33:26.026 A:middle
each region in the code is

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:26.326 A:middle
doing.

00:33:26.326 --> 00:33:27.826 A:middle
It's a little bit like having a

00:33:27.826 --> 00:33:30.266 A:middle
line number associated with the

00:33:30.266 --> 00:33:30.556 A:middle
code.

00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:33.546 A:middle
So now we go back to the

00:33:33.546 --> 00:33:35.106 A:middle
information in our crash log.

00:33:35.516 --> 00:33:37.956 A:middle
We had the ivar destroyer

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:41.416 A:middle
function +42 calling objc

00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:42.026 A:middle
release.

00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:46.346 A:middle
So there is instruction at +42,

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:48.946 A:middle
but there is one more catch.

00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:51.736 A:middle
The catch is in a stack trace

00:33:52.126 --> 00:33:54.086 A:middle
the assembly level offset of

00:33:54.086 --> 00:33:56.436 A:middle
most stack frames is the return

00:33:56.476 --> 00:33:58.436 A:middle
address, it is the instruction

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.226 A:middle
after the function call.

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.226 A:middle
after the function call.

00:34:00.886 --> 00:34:02.146 A:middle
So the instruction of the called

00:34:02.146 --> 00:34:04.346 A:middle
objc release was the previous

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.436 A:middle
instruction, it's this

00:34:05.436 --> 00:34:05.986 A:middle
instruction.

00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:09.786 A:middle
If we read this it's the call of

00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.815 A:middle
objc release which is good,

00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:13.746 A:middle
that's consistent with what we

00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:15.286 A:middle
saw in the stack trace in the

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:16.755 A:middle
crash log which was a call to

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:19.295 A:middle
objc release at this offset.

00:34:20.156 --> 00:34:22.606 A:middle
And this release function is

00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:24.916 A:middle
releasing the database property.

00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:28.085 A:middle
So now we have more detail about

00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:29.146 A:middle
what our crash is doing.

00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:31.295 A:middle
We released the username

00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:32.396 A:middle
property and that was

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:33.056 A:middle
successful.

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:35.596 A:middle
We have not yet gotten to the

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:37.366 A:middle
views property, it might be

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.896 A:middle
valid, it might be invalid we

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:39.416 A:middle
don't know.

00:34:39.866 --> 00:34:41.966 A:middle
What we do know is we tried to

00:34:41.966 --> 00:34:43.696 A:middle
release the database property

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.206 A:middle
and that object looked like it

00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:49.186 A:middle
was already freed object based

00:34:49.186 --> 00:34:50.676 A:middle
on the malloc free list pointer

00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:51.156 A:middle
signature.

00:34:52.315 --> 00:34:53.456 A:middle
So that gives us a pretty good

00:34:53.456 --> 00:34:55.416 A:middle
story of what caused this crash.

00:34:56.025 --> 00:34:57.936 A:middle
We were freeing a login view

00:34:57.936 --> 00:34:59.996 A:middle
controller object and the

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
database property was invalid.

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
database property was invalid.

00:35:04.446 --> 00:35:06.496 A:middle
So we haven't actually found a

00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:08.036 A:middle
bug yet, none of this code is

00:35:08.036 --> 00:35:09.706 A:middle
incorrect, the ivar destroyer

00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:11.656 A:middle
function is not wrong, something

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:13.716 A:middle
else was buggy in our code.

00:35:14.376 --> 00:35:15.856 A:middle
But from the crash log we have

00:35:15.856 --> 00:35:17.966 A:middle
been able to narrow down where

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:20.326 A:middle
our testing should go, where our

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.036 A:middle
attempts to reproduce the bug

00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
should go.

00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:24.086 A:middle
We should be exercising this

00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:26.396 A:middle
class, we should be exercising

00:35:26.396 --> 00:35:27.876 A:middle
the database field, we should be

00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.176 A:middle
reading the code that uses that

00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:32.246 A:middle
database object and try and find

00:35:32.246 --> 00:35:32.616 A:middle
the bug.

00:35:32.996 --> 00:35:36.206 A:middle
So what have we just done?

00:35:37.036 --> 00:35:38.296 A:middle
We read a crash log from

00:35:38.296 --> 00:35:38.886 A:middle
scratch.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.096 A:middle
We started with the crash

00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:42.396 A:middle
reason, we read the exception

00:35:42.396 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
type, we understand what the

00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:44.886 A:middle
exception type means.

00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:48.656 A:middle
We examined the stack trace of

00:35:48.656 --> 00:35:49.986 A:middle
the thread that crashed,

00:35:50.246 --> 00:35:51.806 A:middle
understand what it was doing,

00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:54.146 A:middle
and what the actual error that

00:35:54.146 --> 00:35:55.126 A:middle
failed was.

00:35:55.126 --> 00:35:57.426 A:middle
And we looked for clues

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:59.466 A:middle
elsewhere in the crash log, in

00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:00.716 A:middle
this case we used the bad

00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:00.716 A:middle
this case we used the bad

00:36:00.716 --> 00:36:03.056 A:middle
address of the memory error and

00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:05.006 A:middle
we used the disassembly of the

00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:06.026 A:middle
crashing function.

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:12.506 A:middle
So memory errors are a wide

00:36:12.506 --> 00:36:14.556 A:middle
variety of crashes, there are

00:36:14.556 --> 00:36:16.186 A:middle
many different signatures in

00:36:16.186 --> 00:36:18.076 A:middle
crash logs that can be caused by

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:18.986 A:middle
memory errors.

00:36:19.826 --> 00:36:21.936 A:middle
Here are some examples for you.

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:24.476 A:middle
Crashes in the Objective-C

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:26.856 A:middle
message send function or in the

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:28.486 A:middle
reference counting machinery or

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:31.086 A:middle
deallocation machinery in Swift

00:36:31.086 --> 00:36:32.966 A:middle
and Objective-C are very

00:36:32.966 --> 00:36:34.966 A:middle
commonly caused by memory

00:36:34.966 --> 00:36:35.396 A:middle
errors.

00:36:37.116 --> 00:36:38.866 A:middle
Another common memory error

00:36:38.866 --> 00:36:40.766 A:middle
symptom is an unrecognized

00:36:40.766 --> 00:36:42.266 A:middle
selector exception.

00:36:43.216 --> 00:36:45.126 A:middle
These are often caused when you

00:36:45.126 --> 00:36:47.656 A:middle
have an object of some type, a

00:36:47.656 --> 00:36:49.806 A:middle
code that is using that object,

00:36:50.426 --> 00:36:51.486 A:middle
and then the object gets

00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:53.586 A:middle
deallocated and used again.

00:36:54.416 --> 00:36:55.496 A:middle
But instead of getting the

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:57.696 A:middle
malloc free list signature that

00:36:57.696 --> 00:36:59.356 A:middle
we saw in that previous crash

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:02.306 A:middle
log, instead a new object is

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:02.306 A:middle
log, instead a new object is

00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:04.636 A:middle
allocated at the same address

00:37:04.636 --> 00:37:06.106 A:middle
where the old object used to be.

00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:09.196 A:middle
So when the code tries to use

00:37:09.196 --> 00:37:11.176 A:middle
the old object, call a function

00:37:11.176 --> 00:37:13.046 A:middle
on the old object, we have a

00:37:13.146 --> 00:37:14.966 A:middle
different object of a different

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:17.656 A:middle
type at that same address and it

00:37:17.656 --> 00:37:19.206 A:middle
doesn't recognize that function

00:37:19.206 --> 00:37:20.516 A:middle
at all and we get an

00:37:20.516 --> 00:37:22.326 A:middle
unrecognized selector exception.

00:37:24.636 --> 00:37:27.046 A:middle
One other common symptom of

00:37:27.046 --> 00:37:30.006 A:middle
memory errors is an abort inside

00:37:30.006 --> 00:37:31.696 A:middle
the memory allocator itself,

00:37:31.726 --> 00:37:33.226 A:middle
inside the malloc and free

00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:33.796 A:middle
functions.

00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:35.976 A:middle
This is an example of a

00:37:35.976 --> 00:37:37.966 A:middle
precondition like we saw

00:37:37.966 --> 00:37:39.456 A:middle
earlier, this is a precondition

00:37:39.566 --> 00:37:41.366 A:middle
inside the memory allocator.

00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:44.206 A:middle
It may be identifying cases

00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:47.776 A:middle
where the heap data structure of

00:37:47.776 --> 00:37:49.616 A:middle
the malloc memory itself has

00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:51.366 A:middle
been corrupted by a memory error

00:37:51.606 --> 00:37:52.826 A:middle
and it halts the process and

00:37:52.826 --> 00:37:53.546 A:middle
response.

00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:56.426 A:middle
Or it may be detecting incorrect

00:37:56.426 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
use of the malloc APIs.

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.096 A:middle
For example, if you free an

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.096 A:middle
For example, if you free an

00:38:01.096 --> 00:38:03.676 A:middle
object twice in a row the malloc

00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:04.946 A:middle
allocator can sometimes

00:38:04.946 --> 00:38:06.816 A:middle
recognize that as a double free

00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:08.396 A:middle
and immediately halt the

00:38:08.396 --> 00:38:09.106 A:middle
process.

00:38:11.136 --> 00:38:13.006 A:middle
So let me give you some final

00:38:13.006 --> 00:38:15.656 A:middle
tips for analyzing crash logs in

00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:17.446 A:middle
general and analyzing memory

00:38:17.446 --> 00:38:18.486 A:middle
errors in particular.

00:38:20.756 --> 00:38:22.186 A:middle
In the crash we just looked at

00:38:22.186 --> 00:38:23.286 A:middle
we spent most of our time

00:38:23.286 --> 00:38:24.286 A:middle
looking at the code that

00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:26.266 A:middle
crashed, the specific lines of

00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:27.646 A:middle
code that crashed, and the

00:38:27.646 --> 00:38:28.736 A:middle
thread that crashed.

00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:31.006 A:middle
It is important to look at the

00:38:31.006 --> 00:38:33.636 A:middle
other code in your process

00:38:33.636 --> 00:38:35.006 A:middle
related to the code that

00:38:35.006 --> 00:38:35.536 A:middle
crashed.

00:38:35.656 --> 00:38:39.016 A:middle
For example, in this crash the

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.736 A:middle
ivar destroyer function is not

00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:42.046 A:middle
wrong, that's not where the bug

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:42.636 A:middle
is.

00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:45.246 A:middle
The bug is somewhere else, some

00:38:45.246 --> 00:38:47.376 A:middle
other code is incorrect.

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.286 A:middle
You should also look at the

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:52.696 A:middle
stack traces in the crash log

00:38:52.966 --> 00:38:54.846 A:middle
other than the crashed thread.

00:38:55.586 --> 00:38:58.046 A:middle
The crash log contains all the

00:38:58.046 --> 00:38:59.826 A:middle
stack traces in the process and

00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:01.016 A:middle
that can contain useful

00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:01.016 A:middle
that can contain useful

00:39:01.016 --> 00:39:03.116 A:middle
information and clues for

00:39:03.116 --> 00:39:04.326 A:middle
helping you puzzle out what the

00:39:04.326 --> 00:39:05.386 A:middle
process was doing.

00:39:06.006 --> 00:39:07.856 A:middle
Perhaps the other threads show

00:39:08.276 --> 00:39:10.266 A:middle
more details about where in the

00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:11.666 A:middle
application it was running,

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.196 A:middle
maybe it was performing network

00:39:13.256 --> 00:39:14.716 A:middle
code and that's visible on one

00:39:14.716 --> 00:39:16.556 A:middle
of the other stack traces.

00:39:17.136 --> 00:39:18.086 A:middle
Or perhaps there's a

00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:20.416 A:middle
multithreading error and the

00:39:20.416 --> 00:39:22.346 A:middle
other threads may provide clues

00:39:22.346 --> 00:39:25.116 A:middle
as to what the thread race was.

00:39:26.796 --> 00:39:28.916 A:middle
You should also look at more

00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:31.006 A:middle
than one crash log for a

00:39:31.006 --> 00:39:32.816 A:middle
particular crash cause.

00:39:33.676 --> 00:39:35.676 A:middle
The Xcode Organizer helpfully

00:39:35.676 --> 00:39:37.866 A:middle
groups your crashes based on

00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:39.466 A:middle
where in the code they crashed.

00:39:40.346 --> 00:39:43.506 A:middle
And sometimes there will be

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:45.636 A:middle
multiple crashes at a same crash

00:39:45.706 --> 00:39:47.826 A:middle
point, but some of the logs will

00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:49.726 A:middle
contain more information than

00:39:49.806 --> 00:39:50.416 A:middle
others.

00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:52.386 A:middle
For example, the malloc free

00:39:52.386 --> 00:39:54.286 A:middle
list signature that we just saw

00:39:54.796 --> 00:39:56.666 A:middle
that might appear in some crash

00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:57.976 A:middle
logs but not in others.

00:39:58.176 --> 00:40:00.436 A:middle
So it is useful to browse

00:39:58.176 --> 00:40:00.436 A:middle
So it is useful to browse

00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:02.606 A:middle
through multiple crashes in the

00:40:02.606 --> 00:40:04.876 A:middle
same crash set to see if some of

00:40:04.876 --> 00:40:06.136 A:middle
them have information that is

00:40:06.136 --> 00:40:07.456 A:middle
more useful than others.

00:40:08.326 --> 00:40:11.296 A:middle
In addition, the Organizer as a

00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:13.596 A:middle
group crashes together will

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.586 A:middle
sometimes put crashes with

00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:18.086 A:middle
different causes together in the

00:40:18.086 --> 00:40:18.916 A:middle
same group.

00:40:19.396 --> 00:40:21.466 A:middle
There may be other threads or

00:40:21.546 --> 00:40:22.936 A:middle
the backtrace of a crashed

00:40:22.936 --> 00:40:26.016 A:middle
thread that identify to you, to

00:40:26.016 --> 00:40:28.246 A:middle
a human eye you will recognize

00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:29.766 A:middle
that there are multiple causes

00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:31.956 A:middle
of this group of crashes even

00:40:31.956 --> 00:40:33.296 A:middle
though the Xcode Organizer put

00:40:33.296 --> 00:40:34.036 A:middle
them all together.

00:40:34.856 --> 00:40:36.486 A:middle
If you only looked at one crash

00:40:36.486 --> 00:40:38.686 A:middle
log you might not even know that

00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.436 A:middle
that second crash is occurring

00:40:40.826 --> 00:40:42.886 A:middle
until you fix the first one and

00:40:42.886 --> 00:40:44.896 A:middle
ship it and start getting crash

00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:45.986 A:middle
logs from your users.

00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:50.036 A:middle
Once you've done some analysis

00:40:50.036 --> 00:40:51.056 A:middle
of your crash, once you've

00:40:51.056 --> 00:40:53.416 A:middle
narrowed down where in your

00:40:53.416 --> 00:40:55.146 A:middle
process it might be occurring or

00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:56.476 A:middle
which objects it might've been

00:40:56.476 --> 00:40:58.896 A:middle
using you can use tools like the

00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.546 A:middle
Address Sanitizer and the

00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.546 A:middle
Address Sanitizer and the

00:41:00.546 --> 00:41:02.576 A:middle
Zombies instrument to try and

00:41:02.576 --> 00:41:03.726 A:middle
reproduce the crash.

00:41:04.116 --> 00:41:05.976 A:middle
Because even though we did a

00:41:05.976 --> 00:41:07.636 A:middle
good job with the malloc free

00:41:07.636 --> 00:41:09.936 A:middle
list crash log of narrowing down

00:41:09.936 --> 00:41:11.996 A:middle
what happened it's a lot easier

00:41:11.996 --> 00:41:13.636 A:middle
to debug crashes when they occur

00:41:13.716 --> 00:41:16.456 A:middle
in a debugger, in a test with

00:41:16.456 --> 00:41:18.396 A:middle
Sanitization error messages

00:41:18.396 --> 00:41:19.546 A:middle
telling you what went on.

00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:23.106 A:middle
So a moment ago I mentioned

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.586 A:middle
looking up multiple stack

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:26.826 A:middle
traces, multiple thread stacks

00:41:27.066 --> 00:41:28.286 A:middle
in order to diagnose

00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:29.516 A:middle
multithreading errors.

00:41:30.066 --> 00:41:32.616 A:middle
And to talk more about debugging

00:41:32.616 --> 00:41:34.156 A:middle
multithreading errors let me

00:41:34.156 --> 00:41:34.976 A:middle
introduce Kuba.

00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:40.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:41.196 --> 00:41:41.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:43.646 --> 00:41:44.076 A:middle
Thank you.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.356 A:middle
As Greg mentioned, some memory

00:41:47.356 --> 00:41:49.036 A:middle
corruptions can be caused by

00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:50.126 A:middle
multithreading issues.

00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:52.906 A:middle
Multithreading bugs are often

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:54.496 A:middle
one of the hardest types of bugs

00:41:54.646 --> 00:41:56.436 A:middle
to diagnose and reproduce.

00:41:57.236 --> 00:41:58.436 A:middle
They get especially hard to

00:41:58.436 --> 00:41:59.866 A:middle
reproduce because they only

00:41:59.866 --> 00:42:01.296 A:middle
cause crashes once in a while,

00:41:59.866 --> 00:42:01.296 A:middle
cause crashes once in a while,

00:42:01.546 --> 00:42:03.506 A:middle
so your code might seem to work

00:42:03.506 --> 00:42:05.546 A:middle
fine in 99% of cases.

00:42:06.016 --> 00:42:08.056 A:middle
And these bugs can go unnoticed

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:10.146 A:middle
for a very long time.

00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:12.996 A:middle
Often monitoring bugs cause

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:14.446 A:middle
memory corruptions and what

00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:16.076 A:middle
you'll see in crash logs looks

00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:17.506 A:middle
just like memory corruptions as

00:42:17.506 --> 00:42:19.676 A:middle
well and we've seen examples of

00:42:19.676 --> 00:42:20.856 A:middle
those in the previous section.

00:42:21.316 --> 00:42:22.186 A:middle
So when you're dealing with

00:42:22.186 --> 00:42:23.706 A:middle
crashes inside the malloc or

00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:25.516 A:middle
free or retained counting

00:42:25.516 --> 00:42:27.466 A:middle
operations those are typical

00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:29.176 A:middle
symptoms of memory corruptions.

00:42:30.556 --> 00:42:31.966 A:middle
There's specific symptoms of

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:32.996 A:middle
multithreading bugs as well.

00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:35.546 A:middle
The crashing thread often

00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:37.566 A:middle
contains, sorry the crash log

00:42:37.566 --> 00:42:39.136 A:middle
often contains multiple threads

00:42:39.576 --> 00:42:41.416 A:middle
that are executing related parts

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:41.956 A:middle
of your code.

00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:44.046 A:middle
So if a particular class or a

00:42:44.046 --> 00:42:45.996 A:middle
method shows up in a crash log

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:48.006 A:middle
in multiple threads that's an

00:42:48.006 --> 00:42:49.256 A:middle
indication of a potential

00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:50.136 A:middle
multithreading bug.

00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:53.576 A:middle
The memory corruptions that are

00:42:53.576 --> 00:42:55.036 A:middle
caused by multithreading issues

00:42:55.186 --> 00:42:56.436 A:middle
are often very random.

00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:58.486 A:middle
So you might see crashes

00:42:58.486 --> 00:43:00.016 A:middle
happening at slightly different

00:42:58.486 --> 00:43:00.016 A:middle
happening at slightly different

00:43:00.096 --> 00:43:01.606 A:middle
lines of code or slightly

00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.406 A:middle
different addresses.

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:04.556 A:middle
And as Greg mentioned, you can

00:43:04.556 --> 00:43:06.956 A:middle
see those show up as different

00:43:07.946 --> 00:43:09.716 A:middle
crash points in Xcode even

00:43:09.716 --> 00:43:10.746 A:middle
though it's the same bug.

00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:13.696 A:middle
And also the crashing thread

00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:14.836 A:middle
might not actually be the

00:43:14.836 --> 00:43:15.966 A:middle
culprit of the bug, so it's

00:43:15.966 --> 00:43:18.016 A:middle
important to look at the stack

00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:19.406 A:middle
traces of the other threads in a

00:43:19.406 --> 00:43:19.856 A:middle
crash log.

00:43:20.546 --> 00:43:22.286 A:middle
So now let's take a closer look

00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:23.436 A:middle
at an example of a

00:43:23.436 --> 00:43:24.746 A:middle
multithreading bug and I will

00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:26.056 A:middle
show you how we can diagnose

00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:27.856 A:middle
such a bug using a tool called

00:43:27.856 --> 00:43:29.296 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer which is part

00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:29.886 A:middle
of Xcode.

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:40.066 A:middle
So let's take another look at

00:43:40.066 --> 00:43:41.716 A:middle
our cookies recipe app that

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:43.416 A:middle
Chris and I made and let's look

00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:44.766 A:middle
at some more crash logs that we

00:43:44.766 --> 00:43:46.066 A:middle
received from our users.

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.116 A:middle
Let's focus on this second app

00:43:49.116 --> 00:43:50.546 A:middle
crasher of our app, this one.

00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:53.476 A:middle
This crash log indicates that

00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:54.746 A:middle
there's something wrong going on

00:43:54.746 --> 00:43:56.256 A:middle
when we're doing with a class

00:43:56.256 --> 00:43:58.066 A:middle
called LazyImageView, which is a

00:43:58.066 --> 00:43:59.836 A:middle
class that I wrote and we'll

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:00.996 A:middle
look at it in just a second.

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:00.996 A:middle
look at it in just a second.

00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:02.706 A:middle
But let's try to understand more

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:03.836 A:middle
from the crash logs first.

00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:07.116 A:middle
Let's look at the entire stack

00:44:07.116 --> 00:44:08.466 A:middle
of this thread which I can do by

00:44:08.466 --> 00:44:09.606 A:middle
clicking this button right here

00:44:09.966 --> 00:44:11.296 A:middle
that also shows all other

00:44:11.296 --> 00:44:11.636 A:middle
threads.

00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:14.906 A:middle
And if we focus at the top most

00:44:14.906 --> 00:44:16.566 A:middle
frames here we'll see that

00:44:16.566 --> 00:44:18.246 A:middle
what's really going on is that

00:44:18.246 --> 00:44:19.776 A:middle
the free function is calling

00:44:19.776 --> 00:44:21.556 A:middle
abort which indicates a heap

00:44:21.556 --> 00:44:22.966 A:middle
corruption, a type of memory

00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:23.166 A:middle
error.

00:44:23.166 --> 00:44:26.396 A:middle
If we look at the stack traces

00:44:26.396 --> 00:44:27.756 A:middle
of some other threads, like

00:44:27.756 --> 00:44:30.076 A:middle
thread 5 here, we'll see that

00:44:30.076 --> 00:44:31.856 A:middle
it's executing also some code

00:44:31.946 --> 00:44:33.256 A:middle
inside LazyImageView.

00:44:33.256 --> 00:44:36.786 A:middle
Let's look at another crash in

00:44:36.786 --> 00:44:39.606 A:middle
this group of crashes and we'll

00:44:39.606 --> 00:44:41.016 A:middle
see that this a common theme in

00:44:41.016 --> 00:44:41.906 A:middle
all these crash logs.

00:44:42.376 --> 00:44:44.226 A:middle
One thread is reporting a heap

00:44:44.226 --> 00:44:45.506 A:middle
corruption when the free

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:47.666 A:middle
function is calling abort and a

00:44:47.666 --> 00:44:50.246 A:middle
secondary thread is processing

00:44:50.886 --> 00:44:52.476 A:middle
in a very related part of the

00:44:52.476 --> 00:44:53.516 A:middle
code, actually in the same

00:44:53.516 --> 00:44:55.026 A:middle
class, inside LazyImageView

00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:55.366 A:middle
again.

00:44:55.996 --> 00:44:57.156 A:middle
That's most likely not a

00:44:57.156 --> 00:44:59.166 A:middle
coincidence, I highly suspect

00:44:59.166 --> 00:45:00.136 A:middle
that this is a multithreading

00:44:59.166 --> 00:45:00.136 A:middle
that this is a multithreading

00:45:00.136 --> 00:45:00.496 A:middle
issue.

00:45:01.656 --> 00:45:04.096 A:middle
So let's actually take a look at

00:45:04.096 --> 00:45:05.156 A:middle
our LazyImageView class.

00:45:05.156 --> 00:45:07.256 A:middle
So I'll click this button right

00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:08.656 A:middle
here to jump straight to this

00:45:08.656 --> 00:45:10.006 A:middle
line of code and open it in our

00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:10.436 A:middle
project.

00:45:11.866 --> 00:45:13.126 A:middle
And you can see the source of

00:45:13.126 --> 00:45:14.816 A:middle
LazyImageView right here.

00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:17.396 A:middle
It's a subclass of UIImageView,

00:45:17.706 --> 00:45:19.116 A:middle
but it has an extra feature

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:21.036 A:middle
because it loads images lazily

00:45:21.036 --> 00:45:22.136 A:middle
and asynchronously.

00:45:22.776 --> 00:45:24.096 A:middle
And we can the logic for this

00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:25.196 A:middle
right here in the initializer.

00:45:25.826 --> 00:45:28.026 A:middle
What we do is we dispatch a job

00:45:28.026 --> 00:45:30.106 A:middle
to a background queue where we

00:45:30.106 --> 00:45:31.476 A:middle
will create the image on a

00:45:31.476 --> 00:45:33.356 A:middle
background thread and once that

00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:35.206 A:middle
is done we will dispatch back to

00:45:35.206 --> 00:45:36.876 A:middle
the main queue to actually

00:45:36.876 --> 00:45:37.956 A:middle
display the image on the screen.

00:45:39.046 --> 00:45:40.976 A:middle
The crash log points us to this

00:45:40.976 --> 00:45:43.096 A:middle
line of code here where we are

00:45:43.286 --> 00:45:45.986 A:middle
accessing an image cache which

00:45:45.986 --> 00:45:47.506 A:middle
we are using to make sure that

00:45:47.506 --> 00:45:49.156 A:middle
we don't unnecessarily create

00:45:49.376 --> 00:45:50.806 A:middle
the same image multiple times.

00:45:51.346 --> 00:45:52.616 A:middle
So maybe there is some bug in

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:54.246 A:middle
the way my cache is implemented.

00:45:54.896 --> 00:45:56.146 A:middle
Let's try to avoid guessing,

00:45:56.246 --> 00:45:58.246 A:middle
instead I'll run the app in the

00:45:58.246 --> 00:45:59.496 A:middle
Simulator and we will try to

00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:00.336 A:middle
reproduce this crash.

00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:00.336 A:middle
reproduce this crash.

00:46:00.656 --> 00:46:02.496 A:middle
And let me close the crash log

00:46:02.496 --> 00:46:03.076 A:middle
session first.

00:46:03.076 --> 00:46:05.616 A:middle
All right, so this is our

00:46:05.616 --> 00:46:07.386 A:middle
cookies recipe again and you'll

00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:09.256 A:middle
notice that if I try to add a

00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:11.256 A:middle
new recipe by clicking this +

00:46:11.256 --> 00:46:14.076 A:middle
button right here we get asked

00:46:14.246 --> 00:46:16.166 A:middle
to select an image for our new

00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:16.536 A:middle
recipe.

00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:18.876 A:middle
So this controller which is on

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.726 A:middle
the screen right now displays

00:46:20.786 --> 00:46:22.186 A:middle
all these images using

00:46:22.186 --> 00:46:23.046 A:middle
LazyImageView.

00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:25.346 A:middle
So just showing it up on the

00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:27.146 A:middle
screen and scrolling through the

00:46:27.146 --> 00:46:29.216 A:middle
content already exercises all of

00:46:29.216 --> 00:46:31.296 A:middle
the code inside LazyImageView,

00:46:31.506 --> 00:46:32.606 A:middle
but I don't see any crashes.

00:46:33.546 --> 00:46:34.766 A:middle
Unfortunately, it's a very

00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:35.666 A:middle
common problem with

00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:37.196 A:middle
multithreading bugs, they are

00:46:37.196 --> 00:46:38.566 A:middle
notoriously hard to reproduce.

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:40.886 A:middle
So even when you repeatedly test

00:46:41.016 --> 00:46:43.016 A:middle
the code that has such a bug you

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:44.326 A:middle
might not actually see a crush.

00:46:45.126 --> 00:46:46.706 A:middle
Let's try actually doing that,

00:46:46.706 --> 00:46:48.706 A:middle
let's try closing and opening

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:50.476 A:middle
this controller a couple times

00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:51.646 A:middle
and let's see if maybe

00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:53.426 A:middle
eventually we will be lucky and

00:46:53.746 --> 00:46:54.816 A:middle
we will be able to trigger this

00:46:54.816 --> 00:46:54.956 A:middle
crash.

00:47:00.176 --> 00:47:01.976 A:middle
All right here we go, the

00:47:01.976 --> 00:47:04.406 A:middle
debugger has stopped because it

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.936 A:middle
has crashed, but even when you

00:47:05.936 --> 00:47:07.806 A:middle
actually do catch this crash in

00:47:07.806 --> 00:47:08.826 A:middle
the debugger it doesn't really

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:09.806 A:middle
help us.

00:47:10.256 --> 00:47:11.536 A:middle
All the debugger provides is

00:47:11.536 --> 00:47:13.636 A:middle
that this is some sort of XC bad

00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:15.906 A:middle
excess but it does not what

00:47:15.906 --> 00:47:17.646 A:middle
caused the corruption or why did

00:47:17.646 --> 00:47:19.036 A:middle
it actually happen.

00:47:19.806 --> 00:47:21.866 A:middle
Luckily Xcode has a tool that's

00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:23.356 A:middle
perfect just for this situation

00:47:23.356 --> 00:47:24.616 A:middle
and it's called Thread Sanitizer

00:47:24.616 --> 00:47:25.676 A:middle
and that's what I'm going to use

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:25.876 A:middle
here.

00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:27.816 A:middle
So let's open up the scheme

00:47:27.816 --> 00:47:29.206 A:middle
editor of our project which I

00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:30.446 A:middle
can do by clicking the name of

00:47:30.446 --> 00:47:32.066 A:middle
our app here and choosing Edit

00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
Scheme.

00:47:33.336 --> 00:47:35.536 A:middle
And if I then switch over to the

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.576 A:middle
tab called Diagnostics you'll

00:47:37.576 --> 00:47:40.006 A:middle
see that we have several runtime

00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.426 A:middle
diagnostic tools here, like

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:42.676 A:middle
Address Sanitizer which is great

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.136 A:middle
at finding buffer overflows.

00:47:45.486 --> 00:47:46.746 A:middle
Let me choose Thread Sanitizer

00:47:46.746 --> 00:47:48.396 A:middle
and I'll also select Pause on

00:47:48.396 --> 00:47:49.876 A:middle
Issues which means that the

00:47:49.876 --> 00:47:51.206 A:middle
debugger will break every time

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:52.826 A:middle
that Sanitizer detects a bug.

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:56.086 A:middle
Let's run the app in the

00:47:56.086 --> 00:47:57.556 A:middle
Simulator with Thread Sanitizer

00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:58.566 A:middle
enabled and let's see what

00:47:58.566 --> 00:48:00.366 A:middle
happens now if I try to add a

00:47:58.566 --> 00:48:00.366 A:middle
happens now if I try to add a

00:48:00.366 --> 00:48:00.986 A:middle
new recipe.

00:48:03.056 --> 00:48:05.056 A:middle
If I click the + button now

00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:06.796 A:middle
you'll see that he app gets

00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:07.966 A:middle
immediately stopped because

00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:09.246 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer found the bug.

00:48:09.636 --> 00:48:11.056 A:middle
And notice that I didn't have to

00:48:11.056 --> 00:48:12.776 A:middle
try multiple times, Thread

00:48:12.776 --> 00:48:14.056 A:middle
Sanitizer reproduces

00:48:14.056 --> 00:48:15.706 A:middle
multithreading issues extremely

00:48:15.706 --> 00:48:16.226 A:middle
reliably.

00:48:16.406 --> 00:48:18.616 A:middle
So let's look at some details of

00:48:18.616 --> 00:48:18.986 A:middle
this bug.

00:48:20.056 --> 00:48:22.106 A:middle
We see that it's a Swift access

00:48:22.106 --> 00:48:22.456 A:middle
race.

00:48:22.686 --> 00:48:25.306 A:middle
And if we look at the left side

00:48:25.306 --> 00:48:27.106 A:middle
into the debug navigator we get

00:48:27.106 --> 00:48:28.556 A:middle
even some more details about

00:48:28.556 --> 00:48:28.976 A:middle
this bug.

00:48:29.556 --> 00:48:31.606 A:middle
We see that there's two accesses

00:48:31.996 --> 00:48:33.076 A:middle
performed by two different

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:34.976 A:middle
threads, here is thread 2 and

00:48:34.976 --> 00:48:37.086 A:middle
thread 4, that are both trying

00:48:37.086 --> 00:48:38.306 A:middle
to access the same memory

00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:40.266 A:middle
location at the same time, which

00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:40.926 A:middle
is not allowed.

00:48:41.446 --> 00:48:44.286 A:middle
So if we take a look at these

00:48:44.336 --> 00:48:45.756 A:middle
two lines of code that are

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:47.686 A:middle
forming the race we see that

00:48:47.686 --> 00:48:49.486 A:middle
they are both accessing the

00:48:49.576 --> 00:48:50.526 A:middle
image cache again.

00:48:51.396 --> 00:48:52.806 A:middle
So since this is a data

00:48:52.806 --> 00:48:54.826 A:middle
structure that is shared between

00:48:54.826 --> 00:48:56.266 A:middle
multiple threads as we see here

00:48:56.536 --> 00:48:57.696 A:middle
it needs to be a thread data

00:48:57.696 --> 00:48:58.136 A:middle
structure.

00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:00.136 A:middle
So let's look at how it's

00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:00.136 A:middle
So let's look at how it's

00:49:00.136 --> 00:49:01.826 A:middle
implemented, let's jump to

00:49:01.956 --> 00:49:03.016 A:middle
storage here which is what we're

00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:04.036 A:middle
using and let's see if it

00:49:04.036 --> 00:49:06.326 A:middle
actually is thread safe.

00:49:06.436 --> 00:49:08.466 A:middle
So here's the source of image

00:49:08.466 --> 00:49:09.656 A:middle
cache, right here at the top of

00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:11.326 A:middle
the file and we can immediately

00:49:11.326 --> 00:49:12.196 A:middle
spot what's wrong.

00:49:12.696 --> 00:49:14.306 A:middle
This is just a plain Swift

00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:16.196 A:middle
dictionary so that's not good.

00:49:16.446 --> 00:49:17.886 A:middle
Swift dictionaries are not

00:49:17.886 --> 00:49:19.156 A:middle
thread safe by default.

00:49:19.636 --> 00:49:21.586 A:middle
So if we want to share a mutable

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:22.866 A:middle
Swift dictionary between

00:49:22.866 --> 00:49:25.146 A:middle
multiple threads we have to

00:49:25.146 --> 00:49:26.926 A:middle
protect it with synchronization,

00:49:27.476 --> 00:49:28.656 A:middle
which means we have to make sure

00:49:28.656 --> 00:49:30.336 A:middle
that only one thread accesses it

00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:30.876 A:middle
at a time.

00:49:31.846 --> 00:49:33.326 A:middle
So now let's actually work on

00:49:33.326 --> 00:49:34.656 A:middle
fixing this problem and making

00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:36.876 A:middle
the class thread safe and I'll

00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:37.806 A:middle
do that in two steps.

00:49:37.806 --> 00:49:41.186 A:middle
First, I'll refactor this code a

00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.836 A:middle
little bit so that we have more

00:49:42.836 --> 00:49:44.886 A:middle
control over storage and then in

00:49:44.886 --> 00:49:46.366 A:middle
a second step I will use a

00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:47.696 A:middle
dispatch queue to actually make

00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:48.696 A:middle
this class thread safe.

00:49:50.006 --> 00:49:52.106 A:middle
So first of all what I don't

00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:53.506 A:middle
like here is that storage is

00:49:53.506 --> 00:49:54.916 A:middle
declared as a public variable.

00:49:55.396 --> 00:49:56.896 A:middle
That means that potentially any

00:49:56.896 --> 00:49:58.496 A:middle
code inside my app can be

00:49:58.496 --> 00:49:58.976 A:middle
accessing it.

00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:01.056 A:middle
And it will be really hard to

00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:01.056 A:middle
And it will be really hard to

00:50:01.056 --> 00:50:02.246 A:middle
make sure that all the code in

00:50:02.246 --> 00:50:04.466 A:middle
my app does it correctly, so

00:50:04.466 --> 00:50:06.316 A:middle
let's change it to private

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:06.686 A:middle
instead.

00:50:07.116 --> 00:50:09.536 A:middle
And let me introduce a different

00:50:09.536 --> 00:50:11.726 A:middle
way of accessing image cache and

00:50:11.726 --> 00:50:13.536 A:middle
I'll do that by introducing a

00:50:13.536 --> 00:50:14.076 A:middle
subscript.

00:50:15.206 --> 00:50:16.806 A:middle
That means that users of image

00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:19.056 A:middle
cache can use brackets to load

00:50:19.056 --> 00:50:20.236 A:middle
and store data from the cache.

00:50:21.596 --> 00:50:24.546 A:middle
So subscripting needs a getter,

00:50:25.846 --> 00:50:27.086 A:middle
like this one and a setter.

00:50:28.446 --> 00:50:30.016 A:middle
And for now let's just implement

00:50:30.016 --> 00:50:31.986 A:middle
these by directly accessing the

00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:32.896 A:middle
underlying storage.

00:50:34.586 --> 00:50:36.206 A:middle
And to make the rest of this

00:50:36.456 --> 00:50:37.936 A:middle
file actually build I need to

00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:39.976 A:middle
update the users, so instead of

00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:41.876 A:middle
accessing the storage property

00:50:42.056 --> 00:50:43.646 A:middle
we should be using brackets and

00:50:43.646 --> 00:50:45.526 A:middle
index into image cache directly

00:50:46.226 --> 00:50:47.216 A:middle
like this.

00:50:47.436 --> 00:50:49.886 A:middle
So if I hit Build Now you'll see

00:50:49.886 --> 00:50:52.176 A:middle
that the code will compile fine

00:50:52.176 --> 00:50:53.586 A:middle
now, but I didn't really fix any

00:50:53.586 --> 00:50:54.176 A:middle
bugs yet.

00:50:55.006 --> 00:50:56.716 A:middle
But I did achieve something, I

00:50:56.716 --> 00:50:59.276 A:middle
now have direct control over all

00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
the code that can access

00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
the code that can access

00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
storage.

00:51:01.146 --> 00:51:02.676 A:middle
It's either going to be code in

00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:04.536 A:middle
this getter or the setter, no

00:51:04.536 --> 00:51:06.066 A:middle
other code in my app has access

00:51:06.116 --> 00:51:06.336 A:middle
to it.

00:51:06.646 --> 00:51:08.046 A:middle
So I'm in a very good position

00:51:08.046 --> 00:51:09.696 A:middle
to actually fix this Swift

00:51:09.696 --> 00:51:10.436 A:middle
access race.

00:51:11.796 --> 00:51:13.216 A:middle
And let me do that by using a

00:51:13.216 --> 00:51:13.856 A:middle
dispatch queue.

00:51:14.066 --> 00:51:15.976 A:middle
So let's create a new private

00:51:15.976 --> 00:51:17.766 A:middle
variable called queue and let's

00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:19.976 A:middle
assign a new dispatch queue into

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:20.076 A:middle
it.

00:51:21.346 --> 00:51:23.296 A:middle
Dispatch queues are serial by

00:51:23.296 --> 00:51:24.446 A:middle
default, so this one is also

00:51:24.446 --> 00:51:25.886 A:middle
serial, which means that it will

00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:28.136 A:middle
only allow one piece of code to

00:51:28.136 --> 00:51:30.336 A:middle
execute inside that queue at a

00:51:30.336 --> 00:51:30.726 A:middle
time.

00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:32.556 A:middle
So that's perfect, that's

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:33.776 A:middle
exactly what we need here.

00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:36.236 A:middle
How do we actually execute code

00:51:36.236 --> 00:51:37.406 A:middle
inside a dispatch queue?

00:51:37.766 --> 00:51:40.066 A:middle
We can use queue.sync and

00:51:40.066 --> 00:51:42.076 A:middle
whatever code I move into

00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:45.756 A:middle
queue.sync will be executed

00:51:45.856 --> 00:51:47.246 A:middle
inside that serial queue and

00:51:47.246 --> 00:51:48.146 A:middle
only one at a time.

00:51:48.676 --> 00:51:50.256 A:middle
And I can return a value here

00:51:50.256 --> 00:51:51.446 A:middle
because I need to return

00:51:51.446 --> 00:51:52.316 A:middle
something from the getter.

00:51:53.476 --> 00:51:55.406 A:middle
And I can fix the same thing in

00:51:55.406 --> 00:51:56.146 A:middle
the setter as well.

00:51:56.316 --> 00:51:58.926 A:middle
And if I move this line of code

00:51:59.126 --> 00:52:01.296 A:middle
into this queue.sync it will be

00:51:59.126 --> 00:52:01.296 A:middle
into this queue.sync it will be

00:52:01.296 --> 00:52:02.456 A:middle
executed as part of that

00:52:02.696 --> 00:52:03.286 A:middle
dispatch queue.

00:52:03.796 --> 00:52:06.076 A:middle
So this way the code is now

00:52:06.076 --> 00:52:07.856 A:middle
thread safe because every single

00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:09.316 A:middle
line of code that accesses

00:52:09.316 --> 00:52:11.576 A:middle
storage is always executed

00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.426 A:middle
inside a serial dispatch queue,

00:52:13.546 --> 00:52:15.126 A:middle
which means it will only be

00:52:15.126 --> 00:52:16.706 A:middle
executed one at a time and is

00:52:16.706 --> 00:52:18.376 A:middle
[inaudible] thread safe.

00:52:18.376 --> 00:52:20.286 A:middle
Now it might be tempting to only

00:52:20.286 --> 00:52:22.596 A:middle
use the synchronization in the

00:52:22.596 --> 00:52:24.736 A:middle
setter where we are modifying

00:52:24.736 --> 00:52:26.686 A:middle
the storage and avoiding it in

00:52:26.686 --> 00:52:27.546 A:middle
the getter like this.

00:52:28.496 --> 00:52:29.866 A:middle
But that's not correct, that can

00:52:29.866 --> 00:52:31.286 A:middle
still cause memory corruptions

00:52:31.286 --> 00:52:32.316 A:middle
and still cause crashes.

00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:33.956 A:middle
Let me actually prove that to

00:52:33.956 --> 00:52:35.706 A:middle
you by running this version of

00:52:35.706 --> 00:52:37.466 A:middle
the code in the Simulator and

00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:39.146 A:middle
let's see if the Sanitizer finds

00:52:39.146 --> 00:52:40.766 A:middle
this little more subtle bug now.

00:52:41.316 --> 00:52:44.926 A:middle
As I expected it does.

00:52:45.246 --> 00:52:47.056 A:middle
We really have to protect both

00:52:47.056 --> 00:52:49.046 A:middle
the getter and the setter with

00:52:49.046 --> 00:52:49.866 A:middle
the synchronization.

00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:52.596 A:middle
So let me run my app one last

00:52:52.596 --> 00:52:53.716 A:middle
time in the Simulator and you

00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:55.706 A:middle
will see it if I try to a new

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:56.586 A:middle
recipe this time.

00:52:57.076 --> 00:52:58.406 A:middle
The controller loads up just

00:52:58.406 --> 00:52:59.866 A:middle
fine and we don't get any more

00:52:59.866 --> 00:53:01.206 A:middle
warnings because the class is

00:52:59.866 --> 00:53:01.206 A:middle
warnings because the class is

00:53:01.206 --> 00:53:02.806 A:middle
now correctly thread safe.

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.126 A:middle
So I can actually go back to our

00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:06.476 A:middle
Organizer window and mark this

00:53:07.576 --> 00:53:08.756 A:middle
crash as resolved because we

00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.486 A:middle
have found, identified, and

00:53:10.486 --> 00:53:10.976 A:middle
fixed this bug.

00:53:11.516 --> 00:53:18.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:53:21.286 --> 00:53:23.446 A:middle
All right so what we've just

00:53:23.446 --> 00:53:25.426 A:middle
seen is that I've started with a

00:53:25.426 --> 00:53:27.256 A:middle
set of crash logs that all have

00:53:27.256 --> 00:53:28.746 A:middle
symptoms of a multithreading

00:53:28.746 --> 00:53:28.946 A:middle
bug.

00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:30.596 A:middle
And then I've used this tool

00:53:30.636 --> 00:53:32.056 A:middle
called Thread Sanitizer to

00:53:32.056 --> 00:53:34.186 A:middle
identify and eventually fix this

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:34.436 A:middle
bug.

00:53:35.576 --> 00:53:36.756 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer not only

00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:38.406 A:middle
detects multithreading issues,

00:53:38.456 --> 00:53:40.626 A:middle
but it also makes them reproduce

00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:41.626 A:middle
much more reliably.

00:53:42.276 --> 00:53:43.866 A:middle
Notice that in the demo I didn't

00:53:43.866 --> 00:53:45.356 A:middle
have to invoke the controller

00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:46.256 A:middle
multiple times.

00:53:47.436 --> 00:53:49.386 A:middle
This tool works on macOS and in

00:53:49.386 --> 00:53:51.846 A:middle
the Simulator, but just like all

00:53:51.846 --> 00:53:53.446 A:middle
other runtime diagnostic tools

00:53:53.506 --> 00:53:56.176 A:middle
it only finds bugs in codes that

00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:57.786 A:middle
you exercise by actually running

00:53:57.786 --> 00:53:57.906 A:middle
it.

00:53:58.536 --> 00:54:00.126 A:middle
So you should keep that in mind

00:53:58.536 --> 00:54:00.126 A:middle
So you should keep that in mind

00:54:00.126 --> 00:54:01.356 A:middle
and make sure that your

00:54:01.686 --> 00:54:03.966 A:middle
automated or manual testing uses

00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:05.366 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer, especially on

00:54:05.366 --> 00:54:06.996 A:middle
any code that is using threading

00:54:06.996 --> 00:54:07.356 A:middle
or GCD.

00:54:07.356 --> 00:54:10.846 A:middle
And if you'd like to know more I

00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:12.366 A:middle
recommend that you watch a video

00:54:12.366 --> 00:54:15.486 A:middle
from my WWDC 2016 session called

00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:16.786 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer and Static

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.206 A:middle
Analysis where we have

00:54:18.336 --> 00:54:20.346 A:middle
introduced this tool and we also

00:54:20.486 --> 00:54:21.936 A:middle
talked about how it works under

00:54:21.936 --> 00:54:22.226 A:middle
the hood.

00:54:22.596 --> 00:54:25.566 A:middle
As a reminder, Thread Sanitizer

00:54:25.566 --> 00:54:26.926 A:middle
can be found in the Scheme

00:54:26.926 --> 00:54:27.206 A:middle
Editor.

00:54:27.686 --> 00:54:29.686 A:middle
So if you go to Product, Scheme

00:54:29.956 --> 00:54:32.006 A:middle
and Edit Scheme that will bring

00:54:32.006 --> 00:54:32.956 A:middle
up the Scheme Editor.

00:54:32.956 --> 00:54:34.646 A:middle
And then we can switch over to

00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:36.026 A:middle
the Diagnostics tab where you

00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:37.836 A:middle
can find Thread Sanitizer among

00:54:37.836 --> 00:54:39.536 A:middle
the other runtime diagnostic

00:54:39.586 --> 00:54:39.976 A:middle
tools.

00:54:41.216 --> 00:54:43.546 A:middle
I have one more debugging tip

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.516 A:middle
that I would like to share with

00:54:44.516 --> 00:54:46.136 A:middle
you that's useful when dealing

00:54:46.176 --> 00:54:46.986 A:middle
with multithreading.

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:49.686 A:middle
When you are creating dispatch

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.906 A:middle
queues you can provide a custom

00:54:51.906 --> 00:54:53.216 A:middle
label in the initializer.

00:54:54.576 --> 00:54:56.266 A:middle
You can assign a custom name to

00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:58.566 A:middle
an operation queue and if you're

00:54:58.566 --> 00:55:00.326 A:middle
working with threads you can use

00:54:58.566 --> 00:55:00.326 A:middle
working with threads you can use

00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:01.646 A:middle
custom names with threads as

00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:01.876 A:middle
well.

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:04.406 A:middle
These names and labels are

00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:05.756 A:middle
displayed in the debugger but

00:55:05.756 --> 00:55:07.606 A:middle
they also appear in some types

00:55:07.606 --> 00:55:09.646 A:middle
of crash logs and that can help

00:55:09.646 --> 00:55:11.306 A:middle
you often narrow down possible

00:55:11.306 --> 00:55:14.616 A:middle
causes of multithreading bugs.

00:55:15.556 --> 00:55:16.896 A:middle
Okay so to stay on top of

00:55:16.896 --> 00:55:19.116 A:middle
crashes I have three takeaway

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:19.776 A:middle
points for you.

00:55:20.556 --> 00:55:22.656 A:middle
Number one, always test your

00:55:22.656 --> 00:55:25.276 A:middle
apps on real devices before

00:55:25.276 --> 00:55:26.356 A:middle
submitting them to the App

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.626 A:middle
Store, that will help you avoid

00:55:28.626 --> 00:55:30.506 A:middle
getting rejected in App Review.

00:55:31.796 --> 00:55:33.416 A:middle
Number two, when you do get

00:55:33.606 --> 00:55:35.386 A:middle
crashes from your users you

00:55:35.386 --> 00:55:36.686 A:middle
should always try to reproduce

00:55:36.686 --> 00:55:36.866 A:middle
them.

00:55:37.506 --> 00:55:39.126 A:middle
Look at the crash logs and look

00:55:39.126 --> 00:55:40.356 A:middle
at the stack traces and try to

00:55:40.356 --> 00:55:41.846 A:middle
figure out which parts of your

00:55:41.846 --> 00:55:43.886 A:middle
app do you need to exercise to

00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:45.456 A:middle
trigger a crash or to try to

00:55:45.456 --> 00:55:46.336 A:middle
reproduce the crash.

00:55:46.906 --> 00:55:49.166 A:middle
And finally, for crashes that

00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:50.936 A:middle
are hard to reproduce I

00:55:50.936 --> 00:55:52.446 A:middle
recommend using bug finding

00:55:52.446 --> 00:55:54.216 A:middle
tools, such as Address Sanitizer

00:55:54.216 --> 00:55:56.486 A:middle
or Thread Sanitizer which work

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.096 A:middle
for editing memory corruption

00:55:58.096 --> 00:55:59.216 A:middle
bugs and multithreading

00:55:59.216 --> 00:55:59.706 A:middle
problems.

00:56:00.396 --> 00:56:04.056 A:middle
So now let's recap what we've

00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:04.706 A:middle
learned today.

00:56:05.786 --> 00:56:07.636 A:middle
Chris has showed us how we can

00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:08.976 A:middle
and should use the Organizer

00:56:08.976 --> 00:56:10.796 A:middle
window in Xcode to get

00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:12.466 A:middle
statistics and also details

00:56:12.466 --> 00:56:13.186 A:middle
about crash logs.

00:56:14.286 --> 00:56:15.996 A:middle
Greg showed us how to read and

00:56:15.996 --> 00:56:17.926 A:middle
analyze the text of crash logs.

00:56:18.736 --> 00:56:19.756 A:middle
In many cases, they can be

00:56:19.756 --> 00:56:21.386 A:middle
reproduced like if you are

00:56:21.386 --> 00:56:22.826 A:middle
dealing with app lunch timeouts.

00:56:24.076 --> 00:56:26.716 A:middle
Then we've crash log crashes

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.796 A:middle
that are hard to reproduce

00:56:27.796 --> 00:56:28.966 A:middle
because they happen randomly

00:56:28.966 --> 00:56:30.096 A:middle
like memory corruptions.

00:56:30.486 --> 00:56:32.466 A:middle
And we have mentioned what signs

00:56:32.846 --> 00:56:33.936 A:middle
they leave in crash logs.

00:56:34.796 --> 00:56:36.646 A:middle
And finally, I've shown how bug

00:56:36.646 --> 00:56:37.486 A:middle
finding tools like the

00:56:37.486 --> 00:56:39.106 A:middle
Sanitizers can help you

00:56:39.106 --> 00:56:41.606 A:middle
reproduce issues that are memory

00:56:41.606 --> 00:56:42.916 A:middle
corruptions and threading issues

00:56:43.026 --> 00:56:44.116 A:middle
and I recommend that you use

00:56:44.116 --> 00:56:45.006 A:middle
these tools as well.

00:56:45.956 --> 00:56:47.576 A:middle
