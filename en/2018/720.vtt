[ Music ]

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:25.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome, and hello.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.606 A:middle
I'm Ben Chester, a software

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.746 A:middle
engineer on the Wallet and Apple

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:31.156 A:middle
Pay team.

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:32.836 A:middle
And, I'm here today to talk to

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:34.556 A:middle
you about how to create great

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:36.206 A:middle
customer experiences using

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:36.996 A:middle
Wallet and Apple Pay.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.936 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:40.666 A:middle
cover four topics, and see a

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.786 A:middle
fantastic demo from my

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:42.186 A:middle
colleague.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:45.496 A:middle
Firstly, we're going to cover

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:46.686 A:middle
some of the key things that have

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.686 A:middle
happened in the last year.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:51.266 A:middle
Secondly, how to create great

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.446 A:middle
experiences with Apple Pay,

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.406 A:middle
using some of the new

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:54.356 A:middle
enhancements we're announcing

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:54.676 A:middle
today.

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:57.876 A:middle
Thirdly, how to get the most

00:00:57.876 --> 00:00:58.526 A:middle
from passes.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.396 A:middle
There's some updates to designs,

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.396 A:middle
There's some updates to designs,

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:01.886 A:middle
and some new changes you can

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.106 A:middle
adopt for richer content.

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:06.096 A:middle
Finally, we will talk about

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.626 A:middle
digital to physical commerce.

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:09.106 A:middle
And, to do that I'm going to

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:10.816 A:middle
show you an example that we use

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.166 A:middle
every day at Apple Park, the

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.556 A:middle
Caffe Mac's app, and some

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:13.866 A:middle
others.

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:15.826 A:middle
So, let me first start by

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:16.686 A:middle
telling you about Apple Pay

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
Cash.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.696 A:middle
Apple Pay Cash makes it easy to

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.736 A:middle
get paid, and pay friends and

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:23.846 A:middle
family using iMessage.

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.776 A:middle
Now, you can pay in-store, with

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:27.956 A:middle
apps, and on the web.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:29.776 A:middle
And, it's available in the U.S.

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:33.026 A:middle
Most importantly for you, ensure

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.006 A:middle
you accept Discover debit in

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:36.356 A:middle
your apps, and with your payment

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:38.486 A:middle
processor, so you can take Apple

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:38.996 A:middle
Pay Cash.

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
Another feature that we

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.256 A:middle
announced last year, that is

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:45.306 A:middle
even a greater option, is inline

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:45.746 A:middle
setup.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.626 A:middle
Now, inline setup lets your

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:50.666 A:middle
users with no cards set up one,

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.576 A:middle
and then return to the purchase

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:53.526 A:middle
in one step.

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
All you have to do is always

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.236 A:middle
show the Apple Pay button if the

00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.176 A:middle
device supports it.

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:02.116 A:middle
If the user has no cards, you

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:03.386 A:middle
can use the Set Up with Apple

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.576 A:middle
Pay button, shown here, to make

00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:06.836 A:middle
it even clearer to the user.

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:08.826 A:middle
Now, when the user taps that

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.846 A:middle
button, the setup flow is

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:12.226 A:middle
presented inside of your app,

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:14.996 A:middle
which reduces the risk of users

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:16.186 A:middle
leaving your experience.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:17.686 A:middle
And, this is commonly known as

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:18.306 A:middle
abandonment.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.896 A:middle
And, to support this, no

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:21.916 A:middle
additional work is required from

00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:21.983 A:middle
you.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:25.666 A:middle
Once the card is set up, it

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.056 A:middle
returns the user to the purchase

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:27.606 A:middle
immediately.

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.206 A:middle
We even automatically activate

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:31.146 A:middle
the card via SMS.

00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:34.206 A:middle
Now, even with all of this, it's

00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:35.686 A:middle
still faster than manual entry.

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.396 A:middle
And, you should adopt this in

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:38.506 A:middle
your apps, if you haven't

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:39.606 A:middle
already, for a great user

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:40.196 A:middle
experience.

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.876 A:middle
That's not the only feature we

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:43.796 A:middle
announced in the last year.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:46.326 A:middle
To help with faster checkout, we

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:47.716 A:middle
also introduced error handling,

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:48.796 A:middle
and that's been great for

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:49.266 A:middle
developers.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.006 A:middle
Error handling gives you control

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.346 A:middle
over nonfatal errors in the

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:55.046 A:middle
Apple Pay Sheet.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:57.386 A:middle
And, this allows you to provide

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.806 A:middle
your own custom error messages

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:00.906 A:middle
to the user for billing and

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:00.906 A:middle
to the user for billing and

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:01.626 A:middle
shipping issues.

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.596 A:middle
And, that's so they can more

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:05.256 A:middle
easily resolve those issues, and

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
get back to purchasing.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:08.286 A:middle
And, that's great for higher

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:08.766 A:middle
conversion.

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.176 A:middle
Now, some tips for error

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
handling.

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:13.776 A:middle
One thing we want to make clear,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
is that it's still important to

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.296 A:middle
expect fuzzy data.

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:19.826 A:middle
The user has one set of data in

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:21.196 A:middle
Apple Pay, and that's shared

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:23.136 A:middle
across many apps and websites.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.826 A:middle
And, we don't want the user--

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.586 A:middle
don't want to force the user to

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:27.836 A:middle
conform to everybody's

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.616 A:middle
individual business logic, as

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.066 A:middle
that requires the user to

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.716 A:middle
reenter information, which just

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:35.406 A:middle
increases friction, and will

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.866 A:middle
reduce your overall conversion

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:37.026 A:middle
rate.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:39.856 A:middle
Instead, you should do your best

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.276 A:middle
to accept a range of inputs.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.416 A:middle
For example, Zip and Zip + 4.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:46.196 A:middle
And, infer what details you can

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:48.066 A:middle
from other fields such as city

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.036 A:middle
and state from Zip.

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
Now, that's not all the features

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:52.566 A:middle
that we announced.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.556 A:middle
We also launched in some new

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:54.106 A:middle
countries.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.546 A:middle
And, you may remember this slide

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.186 A:middle
from last year.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:03:59.996 A:middle
Well, this year, we're

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
introducing the following

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
introducing the following

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
countries, and we're also coming

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.796 A:middle
to Norway and Poland soon.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:07.906 A:middle
Now, that's a great range.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:08.996 A:middle
But, one country I want to talk

00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.426 A:middle
about in particular, is China.

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:14.386 A:middle
This year, we've taken Express

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.596 A:middle
Transit to China, launching with

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:18.046 A:middle
Beijing Transit, and Shanghai

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:18.486 A:middle
Transit.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.296 A:middle
Now, this works fantastically.

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
You can buy a card directly from

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:23.186 A:middle
Wallet, and get going

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:23.666 A:middle
straightaway.

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:26.626 A:middle
But, Transit is not limited to

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:27.256 A:middle
China alone.

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:29.556 A:middle
You can use Apple Pay to ride

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
throughout the world, anywhere

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.016 A:middle
credit and debit cards are

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.966 A:middle
accepted, such as Moscow and

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:34.216 A:middle
London.

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.466 A:middle
Well, that's it from updates

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:37.466 A:middle
from the last year.

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:39.656 A:middle
Let's talk about creating great

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.886 A:middle
Apple Pay experiences.

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:43.916 A:middle
What is a great experience with

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.976 A:middle
Apple Pay?

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:48.126 A:middle
Well, it's one that is easier,

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.636 A:middle
by allowing the user to checkout

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:52.376 A:middle
as early as possible, with what

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.366 A:middle
we call upstreaming.

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:56.426 A:middle
It's one that is faster, by

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.816 A:middle
making Apple Pay the default

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.226 A:middle
payment option, with what we

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.026 A:middle
call defaulting.

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.026 A:middle
call defaulting.

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:03.056 A:middle
And, clearer by making the Apple

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.986 A:middle
Pay flow as simple as possible,

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:06.706 A:middle
with what we call streamlining.

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:08.946 A:middle
Now, I want to go through each

00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:10.376 A:middle
of these, starting with

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:10.896 A:middle
streamlining.

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.996 A:middle
Here we see a fantastic example

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:14.536 A:middle
of streamlining.

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.766 A:middle
The Apple Pay button is directly

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:17.846 A:middle
placed on the product page.

00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:20.446 A:middle
And, this makes it so easy, as

00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:21.946 A:middle
Apple Pay is [inaudible] the

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.396 A:middle
user's flow as possible.

00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:26.866 A:middle
Now, if your experience instead

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:28.426 A:middle
is focused on multi-item

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:30.556 A:middle
checkout, then placing the Apple

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:32.166 A:middle
Pay directly on a product page

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:33.936 A:middle
might not work so best for you.

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:35.986 A:middle
Instead, you should focus on

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:36.866 A:middle
Express Checkout.

00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:39.566 A:middle
In this example, the customer

00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:40.956 A:middle
has the option to checkout with

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.256 A:middle
Apple Pay right from the basket,

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.146 A:middle
and the user should be able to

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:45.186 A:middle
reach this checkout from

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:46.276 A:middle
anywhere in your flow.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:48.716 A:middle
And, you can combine both of

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:51.216 A:middle
these experiences for the best

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.566 A:middle
results, if that does make sense

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
for you.

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.656 A:middle
Whenever you use this Apple Pay

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.496 A:middle
button, it's critical to use the

00:05:58.496 --> 00:05:59.966 A:middle
one provided in the SDK.

00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:01.456 A:middle
Let me tell you why.

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:04.766 A:middle
Well, it's localized in all

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:05.646 A:middle
device languages.

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:07.406 A:middle
And, it's available in a number

00:06:07.406 --> 00:06:08.346 A:middle
of styles and colors.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:10.896 A:middle
It scales across all the

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:13.726 A:middle
supported devices, and any

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:15.186 A:middle
changes that we make, you're

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:15.946 A:middle
going to get for free in the

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:16.236 A:middle
future.

00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:19.156 A:middle
It's also supported all the way

00:06:19.156 --> 00:06:22.016 A:middle
back to iOS 8.3, and WebKit 10.1

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.446 A:middle
on iOS, and macOS 10.12.1.

00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:27.296 A:middle
However, we're heard that the

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:28.606 A:middle
button does not always fit all

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:30.476 A:middle
of your needs, and so today,

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:31.936 A:middle
we're announcing three new types

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:32.586 A:middle
in iOS 12.

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:33.876 A:middle
And, I want to show you them

00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:34.646 A:middle
now.

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:37.896 A:middle
The first one is Book with Apple

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:38.116 A:middle
Pay.

00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:40.536 A:middle
Now, you should use this when

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:42.106 A:middle
booking a hotel, or with a

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.036 A:middle
ride-sharing service, for

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:43.416 A:middle
example.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:46.336 A:middle
Simply pass the new Book type to

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:47.546 A:middle
start using it.

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:51.896 A:middle
Secondly, Subscribe with Apple

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:52.126 A:middle
Pay.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.416 A:middle
Use this for subscription-based

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:54.976 A:middle
purchases.

00:06:55.876 --> 00:06:56.856 A:middle
Pass the subscribe type.

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:00.696 A:middle
And, thirdly, Check out with

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:00.696 A:middle
And, thirdly, Check out with

00:07:00.696 --> 00:07:01.136 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:03.406 A:middle
This is best used if you have

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.136 A:middle
multiple references to checkout

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:06.446 A:middle
on the same page.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:08.736 A:middle
Now, this really makes it clear

00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:10.676 A:middle
to the user exactly which

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.276 A:middle
checkout performs Apple Pay.

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:15.806 A:middle
That's not all the changes to

00:07:15.806 --> 00:07:16.176 A:middle
the button.

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:18.736 A:middle
You know that we love rounded

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:20.016 A:middle
corners and continuous curves,

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:21.496 A:middle
but we understand that not

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:22.496 A:middle
everybody shares exactly the

00:07:22.496 --> 00:07:24.316 A:middle
same feelings, and so this year,

00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.026 A:middle
we're allowing you to control

00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:28.956 A:middle
the corner edits of the button.

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:30.506 A:middle
You can configure this however

00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:32.066 A:middle
you see fit to match existing

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:33.926 A:middle
styles of your apps or websites.

00:07:35.596 --> 00:07:37.166 A:middle
If you want square corners,

00:07:37.246 --> 00:07:38.556 A:middle
simply set the button radius to

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:38.876 A:middle
0.

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:42.126 A:middle
And, if you set no value, our

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:43.266 A:middle
existing corner radius will be

00:07:43.266 --> 00:07:43.626 A:middle
used.

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:46.306 A:middle
Now, similarly, on older

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:47.436 A:middle
versions, the button will

00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:48.756 A:middle
fallback to using the current

00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:50.416 A:middle
rounded corner radius, ignoring

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:51.526 A:middle
any value that you've set.

00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:55.616 A:middle
The new types and corner radius

00:07:55.616 --> 00:07:56.746 A:middle
are available in iOS 12 today.

00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:58.156 A:middle
And, they're coming to WebKit in

00:07:58.156 --> 00:07:58.896 A:middle
a future release.

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:01.856 A:middle
Most importantly, fallback to

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.706 A:middle
using older types on unsupported

00:08:03.706 --> 00:08:04.166 A:middle
versions.

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:05.756 A:middle
Consider that cascade.

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:08.326 A:middle
Using the new types will help

00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:09.596 A:middle
your customers purchase more

00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:10.896 A:middle
easily and clearer than ever

00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:11.356 A:middle
before.

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:14.206 A:middle
Now, the placement and use of

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:15.836 A:middle
the Apple Pay button is one way

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:16.786 A:middle
to make checkout easier.

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.756 A:middle
But, that benefit to customer

00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:21.186 A:middle
experience can be multiplied if

00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:22.826 A:middle
you combine this with guest

00:08:22.826 --> 00:08:23.286 A:middle
checkout.

00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.086 A:middle
Now, you should think about

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:29.086 A:middle
guest checkout as your user's

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:30.056 A:middle
first experience.

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.076 A:middle
Now, blocking first-time

00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:33.976 A:middle
purchase increases friction,

00:08:34.106 --> 00:08:35.226 A:middle
which can lead to abandonment,

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:36.046 A:middle
as we described earlier.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.446 A:middle
The user should want to create

00:08:39.446 --> 00:08:41.596 A:middle
an account with you, not have it

00:08:41.596 --> 00:08:43.066 A:middle
forced upon them.

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:45.006 A:middle
Apple Pay offers you a great way

00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:45.586 A:middle
to do this.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:47.926 A:middle
You can use data from the Apple

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:50.456 A:middle
Pay sheet post-purchase to make

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:51.776 A:middle
account creation easy.

00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:53.876 A:middle
I want to show you an example of

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:53.966 A:middle
that.

00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:56.856 A:middle
As soon as the purchase is

00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:58.526 A:middle
complete, and the confirmation

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:00.226 A:middle
is displayed, account creation

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:00.226 A:middle
is displayed, account creation

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:00.806 A:middle
is now offered.

00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:02.986 A:middle
User's email address from the

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:04.726 A:middle
Apple Pay transaction has been

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:06.146 A:middle
used, and all the user has to do

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.746 A:middle
is enter a password to confirm

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:08.636 A:middle
the creation of the account.

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:11.426 A:middle
You can make this even easier,

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.356 A:middle
using password AutoFill, and the

00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:14.846 A:middle
enhancements that we've added in

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:15.306 A:middle
iOS 12.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.106 A:middle
So, that's everything for

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:19.596 A:middle
upstreaming.

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:21.596 A:middle
Now, let's cover making things

00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:22.416 A:middle
faster with defaulting.

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:27.006 A:middle
Most important thing about

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:28.756 A:middle
defaulting is that your users

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:30.426 A:middle
will look for and expect Apple

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:30.656 A:middle
Pay.

00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:33.066 A:middle
So, you should make purchasing

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:36.116 A:middle
faster by setting Apple Pay as

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:36.776 A:middle
the default option.

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:39.326 A:middle
And, Apple Pay is a great

00:09:39.326 --> 00:09:40.876 A:middle
default option, because it has

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:41.496 A:middle
the user's most up-to-date

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:41.976 A:middle
customer information.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:46.196 A:middle
Even if the user has no card set

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.476 A:middle
up in Apple Pay, as we showed

00:09:47.476 --> 00:09:48.896 A:middle
earlier, it still makes a great

00:09:48.896 --> 00:09:49.186 A:middle
option.

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:51.426 A:middle
Let's see an example of

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:52.236 A:middle
defaulting in action.

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:55.366 A:middle
Here we see Apple Pay as the

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:57.166 A:middle
default option right at the top,

00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:58.896 A:middle
and the Buy with Apple Pay

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
button is clearly visible, and

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
button is clearly visible, and

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:01.836 A:middle
easily reachable by the user.

00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:04.716 A:middle
If you apply these guidelines,

00:10:04.716 --> 00:10:05.896 A:middle
you can make it faster than ever

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:07.106 A:middle
for your users to checkout with

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.996 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:11.606 A:middle
So, that's easier and faster

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:13.046 A:middle
ways, but let's look at how to

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.656 A:middle
make things clearer with

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:15.196 A:middle
Streamlining.

00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:19.856 A:middle
Most important piece of

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:21.136 A:middle
information about Streamlining

00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:23.536 A:middle
for you, is to prefer customer

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:24.576 A:middle
information from Apple Pay.

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:27.686 A:middle
Users have this data already set

00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:29.486 A:middle
up, and you can make their

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
experience clearer by using it.

00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:34.496 A:middle
When you request user's data,

00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:36.256 A:middle
it's important to only request

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:37.036 A:middle
relevant fields.

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:38.966 A:middle
Any additional fields that you

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
add will only make things more

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:41.576 A:middle
difficult.

00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:45.016 A:middle
If data is needed that Apple Pay

00:10:45.016 --> 00:10:46.476 A:middle
does not support, you should

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.496 A:middle
collect this before checkout

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:47.966 A:middle
begins.

00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:50.186 A:middle
For example, the number of items

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.576 A:middle
of a particular product, or a

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:52.766 A:middle
voucher code.

00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:55.256 A:middle
Now, this year, we've helped to

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:56.176 A:middle
streamline the Apple Pay

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:58.496 A:middle
experience even further, by

00:10:58.496 --> 00:10:59.416 A:middle
making two changes.

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.676 A:middle
The first one I want to talk

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.676 A:middle
The first one I want to talk

00:11:01.676 --> 00:11:03.896 A:middle
about is zero total support, and

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:05.436 A:middle
I want to show you why that's

00:11:05.436 --> 00:11:05.936 A:middle
important.

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:09.436 A:middle
Here we see the Apple Pay sheet

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:10.546 A:middle
with a discount being applied,

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:12.226 A:middle
and the total is above zero.

00:11:12.726 --> 00:11:14.096 A:middle
But, if that discount had

00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:15.376 A:middle
brought that all the way down to

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.516 A:middle
zero, we've previously not been

00:11:17.516 --> 00:11:18.486 A:middle
able to present this sheet.

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.786 A:middle
Well, now we do.

00:11:21.646 --> 00:11:22.556 A:middle
You can see the discount has

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.476 A:middle
brought the total to zero.

00:11:23.596 --> 00:11:24.956 A:middle
Apple Pay sheet can still be

00:11:24.956 --> 00:11:26.896 A:middle
used to collect the necessary

00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:28.356 A:middle
shipping details, and other

00:11:28.356 --> 00:11:29.536 A:middle
information you need for the

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:29.956 A:middle
purchase.

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:33.616 A:middle
And, zero totals also work well

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:34.416 A:middle
with subscriptions.

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:37.566 A:middle
If the introductory month is

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:39.456 A:middle
free, you can make this clear to

00:11:39.456 --> 00:11:40.656 A:middle
the user with a zero total.

00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:43.736 A:middle
Now, remember, it's important to

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.316 A:middle
clearly state the price of the

00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:47.146 A:middle
subscription, as well as the

00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:48.436 A:middle
promotional discount they can

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:48.766 A:middle
receive.

00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:52.696 A:middle
Zero total support is available

00:11:52.696 --> 00:11:53.516 A:middle
in iOS 12 today.

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.996 A:middle
And, it's coming to WebKit in a

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:55.666 A:middle
future release.

00:11:56.996 --> 00:11:58.116 A:middle
Make sure to fallback to

00:11:58.116 --> 00:11:59.896 A:middle
existing behavior on older

00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.236 A:middle
versions, where zero total is

00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.236 A:middle
versions, where zero total is

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:01.966 A:middle
not supported.

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:05.466 A:middle
Now, the second way we have made

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:06.546 A:middle
the experience more streamlined

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.446 A:middle
in iOS 12, is with three new

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:09.356 A:middle
supported networks.

00:12:10.176 --> 00:12:11.656 A:middle
And, this means you can filter

00:12:11.656 --> 00:12:12.896 A:middle
the cards in the Apple Pay sheet

00:12:12.896 --> 00:12:13.976 A:middle
more granularly.

00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:17.326 A:middle
And, there are three new

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:19.726 A:middle
networks: Electron, Maestro, and

00:12:19.726 --> 00:12:19.936 A:middle
VPay.

00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:23.906 A:middle
It's important for the best

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:25.736 A:middle
possible experience to accept as

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:26.896 A:middle
many networks as you can.

00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:30.666 A:middle
These are available in iOS 12,

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:31.666 A:middle
and coming to WebKit in the

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:32.016 A:middle
future.

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.436 A:middle
So, we've covered ways to make

00:12:35.436 --> 00:12:38.046 A:middle
things easier, faster, and

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:39.006 A:middle
clearer with Apple Pay.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.206 A:middle
I hope you will try these all

00:12:41.206 --> 00:12:42.416 A:middle
out, and make your experiences

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:44.156 A:middle
better than ever, using our new

00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:44.716 A:middle
enhancements.

00:12:46.076 --> 00:12:47.586 A:middle
One final topic I want to cover

00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:49.936 A:middle
is Apple Pay on the web, and the

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.076 A:middle
WC3 Payment Request API.

00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:54.976 A:middle
Apple worked closely with a W3C

00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:57.106 A:middle
working group over the past few

00:12:57.106 --> 00:12:58.126 A:middle
years to help develop the

00:12:58.126 --> 00:12:58.926 A:middle
Payment Request API.

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:01.286 A:middle
Now, that it's announced, you

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:01.286 A:middle
Now, that it's announced, you

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:02.366 A:middle
may be wondering if you should

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:03.966 A:middle
be using that, or our existing

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:05.136 A:middle
Apple Pay JavaScript API.

00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:07.776 A:middle
Let's compare the benefits of

00:13:07.776 --> 00:13:09.396 A:middle
using one over the other.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.246 A:middle
The Payment Request API is a

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:14.486 A:middle
cross browser solution, however,

00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:15.866 A:middle
it's important to know that

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:17.526 A:middle
Apple Pay is only supported on

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:18.006 A:middle
Safari.

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:20.486 A:middle
If you choose the Payment

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:23.096 A:middle
Request API, you do miss out on

00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:24.236 A:middle
some of the following features.

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:26.816 A:middle
Error handling with custom error

00:13:26.816 --> 00:13:28.046 A:middle
messaging, as I showed you

00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:28.326 A:middle
earlier.

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.266 A:middle
But also, automatic selection of

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
affiliated and cobranded cards.

00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:35.716 A:middle
And, therefore, your ability to

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:37.326 A:middle
adjust prices of the user's

00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:38.236 A:middle
selection of these cards.

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:40.726 A:middle
In markets and regions where

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.436 A:middle
it's important, phonetic name

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:43.616 A:middle
collection is also not

00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:44.046 A:middle
supported.

00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.626 A:middle
And, the Apple Pay JavaScript

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.216 A:middle
API has a wider range of

00:13:48.216 --> 00:13:50.386 A:middle
support, going back to iOS 10,

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:51.696 A:middle
and macOS 10.12.

00:13:53.136 --> 00:13:54.566 A:middle
Now, you should evaluate what

00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:55.326 A:middle
makes sense for you.

00:13:55.766 --> 00:13:56.666 A:middle
And, if you choose the Payment

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.976 A:middle
Request API, consider using the

00:13:58.976 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
Apple Pay JavaScript API as a

00:13:58.976 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
Apple Pay JavaScript API as a

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:02.316 A:middle
fallback for older clients.

00:14:03.856 --> 00:14:05.406 A:middle
To make it even easier to get

00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:06.796 A:middle
started with the Apple Pay

00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:08.446 A:middle
JavaScript API, today we're

00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:09.456 A:middle
launching a demo page.

00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:11.106 A:middle
Let me show you that.

00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:13.996 A:middle
The demo page walks you through

00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:15.326 A:middle
all the steps required to get

00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:15.656 A:middle
set up.

00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:17.636 A:middle
And, it all starts with the

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:18.196 A:middle
Apple Pay button.

00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:20.936 A:middle
You can configure sizes, and

00:14:20.936 --> 00:14:22.916 A:middle
styles, and locale, and see how

00:14:22.916 --> 00:14:23.856 A:middle
they change in real time.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:25.856 A:middle
The code required to drill the

00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:27.776 A:middle
button is dynamically updated

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:28.126 A:middle
below.

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:30.656 A:middle
And the page even allows you to

00:14:30.656 --> 00:14:31.906 A:middle
test out the Apple Pay purchase

00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:32.096 A:middle
flow.

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.746 A:middle
Simply configure the JSON in the

00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:38.066 A:middle
request inside the page, and the

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.436 A:middle
Apple Pay button there will be

00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:40.456 A:middle
used to present the payment

00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:40.676 A:middle
sheet.

00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:43.276 A:middle
The results of the authorization

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:44.706 A:middle
and success or failure are

00:14:44.706 --> 00:14:46.126 A:middle
displayed to you directly.

00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:48.036 A:middle
Now, it's important to note,

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:49.726 A:middle
your cards will not be charged

00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:50.596 A:middle
when you do this.

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:53.456 A:middle
It's a great resource to get

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:54.666 A:middle
started, and I hope you try it

00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:54.876 A:middle
out.

00:14:56.236 --> 00:14:57.656 A:middle
The demo page is available here

00:14:57.656 --> 00:14:58.276 A:middle
online today.

00:14:58.346 --> 00:15:01.216 A:middle
And, that's everything we have

00:14:58.346 --> 00:15:01.216 A:middle
And, that's everything we have

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:02.326 A:middle
for covering Apple Pay today.

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:03.836 A:middle
So, now I want to move on to

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.236 A:middle
talking about getting the most

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:05.836 A:middle
from passes.

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:10.356 A:middle
Passes are where it all began

00:15:10.356 --> 00:15:11.496 A:middle
for us, and they hold a very

00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:12.536 A:middle
special place in our hearts.

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:14.436 A:middle
And, we have some fantastic

00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:15.166 A:middle
improvements I'm going to tell

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:15.576 A:middle
you about.

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:17.146 A:middle
But first, I just wanted to

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
recap what makes passes so

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:18.916 A:middle
special.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.126 A:middle
They are so easy to use

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:24.066 A:middle
contactlessly or with a bar

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:24.306 A:middle
code.

00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:26.776 A:middle
And, they're synced across all

00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:28.096 A:middle
your devices using iCloud.

00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
And, we're able to intelligently

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.616 A:middle
show them on the lock screen and

00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:33.766 A:middle
in Search for quick access.

00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:36.886 A:middle
And, they continue that seamless

00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:38.036 A:middle
Apple Pay experience into the

00:15:38.036 --> 00:15:39.476 A:middle
physical world, which works

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:40.976 A:middle
great for tickets, movie passes.

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:44.736 A:middle
Those are great reasons why you

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
should use passes.

00:15:46.186 --> 00:15:47.246 A:middle
But, how do you get the most

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.316 A:middle
from passes for your users?

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
Well, to do that we're going to

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.146 A:middle
cover four topics.

00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:53.736 A:middle
And, we're going to start by

00:15:53.736 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
talking about adding passes to

00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:55.696 A:middle
Wallet.

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:57.526 A:middle
And, we have some best practices

00:15:57.526 --> 00:15:58.386 A:middle
that you can follow.

00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:01.406 A:middle
Secondly, making passes look

00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:01.406 A:middle
Secondly, making passes look

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:01.776 A:middle
great.

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:03.766 A:middle
There's some new design options,

00:16:03.936 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
and some tips for making passes

00:16:05.476 --> 00:16:06.856 A:middle
work across all your devices.

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:10.746 A:middle
Thirdly, rich pass content.

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:13.006 A:middle
New ways to make your passes

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.126 A:middle
more deeply integrate with the

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:15.936 A:middle
system.

00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:17.696 A:middle
And, finally, contactless

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:19.786 A:middle
passes, and how you can get

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:20.836 A:middle
started.

00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:21.936 A:middle
So, let's begin with adding

00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:22.676 A:middle
passes to Wallet.

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:24.606 A:middle
Many of you have seen or

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:26.026 A:middle
experienced the full model UI

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.676 A:middle
that was presented to add

00:16:27.676 --> 00:16:28.336 A:middle
passes.

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:29.136 A:middle
But, there's a better way.

00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.636 A:middle
For almost all situations, we

00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:34.996 A:middle
recommend using our automatic

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:35.896 A:middle
pass adding API.

00:16:37.186 --> 00:16:39.176 A:middle
To use this, simply call the

00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.436 A:middle
addPasses function in

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.226 A:middle
PKPassLibrary, with the array of

00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:43.306 A:middle
passes you intend to add.

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.636 A:middle
Now, this presents a simple

00:16:45.636 --> 00:16:47.356 A:middle
alert to the user, requesting

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:48.536 A:middle
them to add or to review those

00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:48.926 A:middle
passes.

00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.166 A:middle
And, that's much less friction

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:52.146 A:middle
compared to the full-screen

00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:52.556 A:middle
model UI.

00:16:52.556 --> 00:16:55.026 A:middle
And, the user still has the

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.666 A:middle
option to review the passes in

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:56.946 A:middle
full.

00:16:57.436 --> 00:16:58.536 A:middle
And, you should handle that in

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.656 A:middle
the completion, and present that

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.656 A:middle
the completion, and present that

00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:01.926 A:middle
viewController if requested.

00:17:03.026 --> 00:17:03.936 A:middle
In the demo you're going to see

00:17:03.936 --> 00:17:05.226 A:middle
later, you'll see how this

00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:06.146 A:middle
improves the experience.

00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.586 A:middle
So, let me tell you about some

00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:09.656 A:middle
other best practices to follow

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:10.415 A:middle
for adding passes.

00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:14.435 A:middle
Now, we suggest adding passes

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:15.586 A:middle
that were created outside of

00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:17.596 A:middle
your experience, when the user

00:17:17.596 --> 00:17:18.465 A:middle
enters the app for the first

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:19.526 A:middle
time, if they're coming from an

00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:20.566 A:middle
unsupported platform.

00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:22.185 A:middle
They've not previously had the

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.376 A:middle
opportunity to add those passes,

00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:24.866 A:middle
and that's a great time to offer

00:17:24.866 --> 00:17:25.156 A:middle
it to them.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:27.476 A:middle
And, you should add related

00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:30.286 A:middle
passes to Wallet in a group, to

00:17:30.286 --> 00:17:31.006 A:middle
reduce the friction.

00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:33.536 A:middle
And, you can make it easy for

00:17:33.536 --> 00:17:34.836 A:middle
people to quickly add passes

00:17:35.036 --> 00:17:36.546 A:middle
that they do not have from your

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
order history views, or previous

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.006 A:middle
transactions, for example.

00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:42.006 A:middle
And, from those same views, if

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:43.446 A:middle
your user has a pass in Wallet

00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:44.946 A:middle
already, you should link them

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:45.626 A:middle
directly to it.

00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:47.496 A:middle
So that no matter where the user

00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:48.966 A:middle
starts their journey, in Wallet,

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
or your experience, they can get

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:52.686 A:middle
to the pass.

00:17:52.786 --> 00:17:54.056 A:middle
If you follow all these tips,

00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:55.666 A:middle
and use automatic pass adding,

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.146 A:middle
your users will love passes.

00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:00.226 A:middle
But, how do you make a pass that

00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:00.226 A:middle
But, how do you make a pass that

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:00.866 A:middle
looks great?

00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:04.536 A:middle
Most important information for

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:06.946 A:middle
you is that the pass fields that

00:18:06.946 --> 00:18:08.836 A:middle
you display to the user should

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:10.496 A:middle
have the relevant and critical

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:12.596 A:middle
information on them.

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:13.386 A:middle
And, there're things that the

00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:14.586 A:middle
user definitely needs.

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:16.856 A:middle
And, you can make them stand out

00:18:16.856 --> 00:18:18.016 A:middle
by using vibrant colors.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.966 A:middle
And, you should design a pass

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.266 A:middle
that looks great across all your

00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:22.846 A:middle
devices.

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:26.836 A:middle
Now, to do that, you want to

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:28.796 A:middle
avoid reproducing existing

00:18:28.796 --> 00:18:30.506 A:middle
passes, physical ones.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.816 A:middle
We have some great templates,

00:18:33.126 --> 00:18:35.156 A:middle
and layout options to make these

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.016 A:middle
fields stand out and make sure

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.426 A:middle
that your entire audience can

00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:41.236 A:middle
work with these passes as

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:41.846 A:middle
they're accessible.

00:18:44.306 --> 00:18:45.926 A:middle
And, secondly don't encode user

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:47.256 A:middle
information inside the strip

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:48.286 A:middle
image that we can see here.

00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:50.226 A:middle
You should reserve that for the

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:50.736 A:middle
fields.

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:53.266 A:middle
That's particularly important on

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:53.706 A:middle
Apple Watch.

00:18:53.706 --> 00:18:55.956 A:middle
Because there's no space to

00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:56.686 A:middle
display that.

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.216 A:middle
And, the fields are front and

00:18:58.216 --> 00:18:58.546 A:middle
center.

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:01.776 A:middle
Similarly, the thumbnail image

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:01.776 A:middle
Similarly, the thumbnail image

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:03.976 A:middle
is also not displayed, and the

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.146 A:middle
user cannot access the pass

00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:05.476 A:middle
details.

00:19:07.536 --> 00:19:09.316 A:middle
So, but we know sometimes

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.606 A:middle
there's information that's

00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:11.856 A:middle
difficult to put all on the

00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:12.556 A:middle
front of pass.

00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:14.006 A:middle
And so, today we want to make

00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:15.036 A:middle
things a little bit easier for

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:16.986 A:middle
you by adding additional row

00:19:16.986 --> 00:19:17.416 A:middle
support.

00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:20.426 A:middle
Let me show you that in action

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:21.456 A:middle
first.

00:19:21.616 --> 00:19:23.506 A:middle
Here we see a new third row

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:24.346 A:middle
enabled, showing the section and

00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:24.906 A:middle
the start number.

00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:28.966 A:middle
Now, that's a great way to layer

00:19:29.056 --> 00:19:30.526 A:middle
additional content, when your

00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:31.896 A:middle
existing information is already

00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:32.526 A:middle
a little bit long.

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:34.776 A:middle
And, this is really easy to add

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:35.416 A:middle
to your passes.

00:19:35.636 --> 00:19:36.566 A:middle
Let me show you how to do it

00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:36.936 A:middle
with a pass JSON.

00:19:39.516 --> 00:19:41.216 A:middle
Here we see the new row key be

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:43.696 A:middle
using the auxiliaryFields, by

00:19:43.696 --> 00:19:45.046 A:middle
setting a 0 or a 1.

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:46.816 A:middle
You can indicate that the field

00:19:46.816 --> 00:19:47.796 A:middle
should be split over the two

00:19:47.796 --> 00:19:48.966 A:middle
locations on the front of pass.

00:19:54.046 --> 00:19:55.176 A:middle
"Row" can only be used in the

00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:57.336 A:middle
auxiliary fields, and only for

00:19:57.336 --> 00:19:58.666 A:middle
event ticket-type passes.

00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:01.106 A:middle
We support values of 0 and 1,

00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:01.106 A:middle
We support values of 0 and 1,

00:20:01.106 --> 00:20:02.506 A:middle
and that's going to be coming to

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
you in a future seed.

00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:06.216 A:middle
On older versions, "row" will be

00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:06.626 A:middle
ignored.

00:20:07.356 --> 00:20:09.256 A:middle
And, in that case, auxiliary

00:20:09.256 --> 00:20:10.366 A:middle
fields will be displayed on one

00:20:10.366 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
row, up to a limit of 4 fields

00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:13.626 A:middle
per row.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.096 A:middle
So, make sure you consider this

00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:17.166 A:middle
when designing your passes.

00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:18.996 A:middle
And, test across supported

00:20:18.996 --> 00:20:20.206 A:middle
devices and versions.

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.476 A:middle
So now, we've got passes in

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:25.756 A:middle
Wallet, looking great.

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:27.906 A:middle
How do we make that content even

00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:28.186 A:middle
richer?

00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:31.346 A:middle
Let's get the most from a pass.

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.266 A:middle
You can include information that

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.696 A:middle
the system can leverage to

00:20:34.696 --> 00:20:35.816 A:middle
provide the user enhanced

00:20:35.816 --> 00:20:36.506 A:middle
experiences.

00:20:37.356 --> 00:20:38.326 A:middle
And, one of those you may

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.306 A:middle
already know about, is

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:39.836 A:middle
relevancy.

00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:43.196 A:middle
You can add relevancy by setting

00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:45.766 A:middle
the locations, relevantText, and

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:47.276 A:middle
relevantDate pass JSON fields.

00:20:47.796 --> 00:20:50.676 A:middle
And, this allows the system to

00:20:50.676 --> 00:20:51.836 A:middle
present the pass to the user

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:53.136 A:middle
just at the right moment.

00:20:54.026 --> 00:20:55.436 A:middle
We handle multiple relevant

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:55.866 A:middle
passes.

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:57.966 A:middle
And, if you're issuing passes

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.436 A:middle
for a single journey, multiple

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
ones, then you should make sure

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
ones, then you should make sure

00:21:01.516 --> 00:21:02.816 A:middle
to add relevancy information for

00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:03.486 A:middle
each pass.

00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:05.076 A:middle
And, allow the system to

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.216 A:middle
correctly present them one at a

00:21:06.216 --> 00:21:06.956 A:middle
time to the user.

00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:09.756 A:middle
It's not a problem at all.

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:11.116 A:middle
Now, it feels like magic when

00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:12.276 A:middle
their passes are so easy to

00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:12.736 A:middle
access.

00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:14.936 A:middle
And, to date we're looking at

00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:16.886 A:middle
making passes even richer, with

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:18.356 A:middle
something we call semantic tags.

00:21:21.376 --> 00:21:22.506 A:middle
The fields that we showed

00:21:22.506 --> 00:21:24.516 A:middle
earlier in the pass JSON are a

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:25.966 A:middle
great mechanism for display.

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:27.916 A:middle
And, as the developer, you have

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.016 A:middle
full control over the field

00:21:29.016 --> 00:21:31.806 A:middle
names, and the format of that

00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:32.836 A:middle
content.

00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:33.726 A:middle
However, that means it's

00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:34.976 A:middle
difficult for iOS to reason

00:21:34.976 --> 00:21:35.776 A:middle
about every field.

00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:38.036 A:middle
As everybody uses unique key and

00:21:38.036 --> 00:21:38.546 A:middle
label names.

00:21:39.866 --> 00:21:42.476 A:middle
Semantic tags changes that by

00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:43.916 A:middle
providing a structured way for

00:21:44.196 --> 00:21:45.876 A:middle
you to augment the display data

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:47.566 A:middle
with a fixed format data.

00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:49.976 A:middle
Let me show you how easy it is

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:51.766 A:middle
to add to an existing pass for

00:21:51.766 --> 00:21:52.606 A:middle
an upcoming film I'm going to

00:21:52.606 --> 00:21:52.846 A:middle
see.

00:21:55.236 --> 00:21:57.486 A:middle
Here we see a sample of primary,

00:21:57.756 --> 00:21:59.516 A:middle
secondary, and auxiliary fields

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:00.366 A:middle
from the pass JSON.

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:00.366 A:middle
from the pass JSON.

00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:02.486 A:middle
This film's called "Revenge of

00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:03.026 A:middle
the Passes."

00:22:03.516 --> 00:22:05.056 A:middle
It's showing at Apple Park, and

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:06.186 A:middle
it's running for two hours and

00:22:06.186 --> 00:22:07.476 A:middle
45 minutes in theater F5.

00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:09.606 A:middle
Now, that's all the information

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:11.386 A:middle
I'm going to need when I get

00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:12.596 A:middle
there to see the film.

00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:13.586 A:middle
And, it's going to be readily

00:22:13.586 --> 00:22:14.176 A:middle
available to me.

00:22:15.556 --> 00:22:16.776 A:middle
So, let's take that event field

00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:17.716 A:middle
at the top, and add some

00:22:17.716 --> 00:22:19.186 A:middle
semantic tags to it.

00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:22.256 A:middle
To do that, we add a semantics

00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:23.236 A:middle
dictionary to the field.

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.766 A:middle
And, inside that dictionary, you

00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.036 A:middle
can have relevant key names from

00:22:27.036 --> 00:22:29.046 A:middle
my documentation to provide

00:22:29.046 --> 00:22:30.176 A:middle
machine-readable content.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.336 A:middle
For example, with the movie, the

00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:35.066 A:middle
name used for display may differ

00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:36.786 A:middle
from the full official name used

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:37.446 A:middle
internationally.

00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:39.526 A:middle
And the same might apply to your

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:40.026 A:middle
venue name.

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:41.936 A:middle
These should be the official

00:22:41.936 --> 00:22:43.486 A:middle
names that are different from

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:43.966 A:middle
display.

00:22:45.546 --> 00:22:46.466 A:middle
You're also able to add

00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:48.626 A:middle
additional related data that is

00:22:48.626 --> 00:22:49.906 A:middle
not important for display, but

00:22:50.316 --> 00:22:51.706 A:middle
associated with that field.

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:54.476 A:middle
For example, the phone number.

00:22:54.526 --> 00:22:55.896 A:middle
Now, sometimes, you have

00:22:55.896 --> 00:22:57.526 A:middle
semantic data that is not

00:22:57.526 --> 00:22:58.756 A:middle
associated with fields.

00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
And, to capture that, we can use

00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
And, to capture that, we can use

00:23:01.406 --> 00:23:02.466 A:middle
a top-level semantics

00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:02.836 A:middle
dictionary.

00:23:03.856 --> 00:23:05.106 A:middle
Here, I've added a semantic tag

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:06.386 A:middle
indicating that while this pass

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:07.866 A:middle
is relevant, silence should be

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:08.406 A:middle
requested.

00:23:08.976 --> 00:23:11.366 A:middle
I've also indicated the duration

00:23:11.366 --> 00:23:13.036 A:middle
of the event in seconds, and

00:23:13.036 --> 00:23:14.166 A:middle
specified the event type.

00:23:14.696 --> 00:23:16.596 A:middle
You may have seen this in the

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:18.506 A:middle
Keynote, Siri will then be able

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:20.206 A:middle
to offer the user the ability to

00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:21.776 A:middle
quickly enable do not disturb at

00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:22.436 A:middle
the right time.

00:23:22.996 --> 00:23:24.666 A:middle
It just works.

00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:25.846 A:middle
And, it's great for things like

00:23:25.846 --> 00:23:27.576 A:middle
movie tickets, or event passes.

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.316 A:middle
Now, in summary, semantic tags

00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:33.306 A:middle
are a great way to add

00:23:33.306 --> 00:23:34.596 A:middle
machine-readable content to your

00:23:34.596 --> 00:23:34.996 A:middle
passes.

00:23:36.046 --> 00:23:37.676 A:middle
And, we have over 70 supported

00:23:38.226 --> 00:23:40.056 A:middle
transit and event tags.

00:23:40.866 --> 00:23:42.576 A:middle
All these keys will be available

00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:43.706 A:middle
in our online documentation

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:44.026 A:middle
soon.

00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:46.576 A:middle
And, one important thing to

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:48.716 A:middle
note, relevancy information

00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:49.916 A:middle
works in combination with

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:50.646 A:middle
semantic tags.

00:23:51.286 --> 00:23:52.176 A:middle
And so, you should add both to

00:23:52.176 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
your passes for the best

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:53.806 A:middle
experience.

00:23:55.276 --> 00:23:56.746 A:middle
Now, bringing all this together,

00:23:56.846 --> 00:23:58.346 A:middle
I want to talk to you about

00:23:58.346 --> 00:23:59.666 A:middle
contactless passes.

00:24:01.236 --> 00:24:03.296 A:middle
Contactless passes are a great

00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:05.526 A:middle
way for users to interact with

00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:05.846 A:middle
Wallet.

00:24:06.136 --> 00:24:07.606 A:middle
And, it's a much improved

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:09.176 A:middle
experience over scanning a

00:24:09.176 --> 00:24:09.626 A:middle
barcode.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.246 A:middle
I want to show you one of our

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:13.496 A:middle
favorite uses of contactless

00:24:13.496 --> 00:24:13.916 A:middle
passes.

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:16.136 A:middle
Internationally renowned,

00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:17.946 A:middle
Wembley Stadium in London had

00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:19.136 A:middle
famous football players record

00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:20.586 A:middle
an advert just to show how easy

00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:20.976 A:middle
it is to use.

00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:48.500 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:53.106 A:middle
It really couldn't be any

00:24:53.106 --> 00:24:53.386 A:middle
easier.

00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:55.596 A:middle
And, that contactless feels like

00:24:55.596 --> 00:24:57.386 A:middle
magic when you combine it with

00:24:57.386 --> 00:24:58.406 A:middle
relevancy for lock screen

00:24:58.406 --> 00:24:59.626 A:middle
access, swiping down for

00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:00.266 A:middle
notification.

00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:00.266 A:middle
notification.

00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:03.786 A:middle
Contactless passes do require an

00:25:03.866 --> 00:25:05.376 A:middle
NFC certificate to get started.

00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:09.016 A:middle
Now, you should contact us for

00:25:09.016 --> 00:25:10.766 A:middle
access if you have a great use

00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:11.106 A:middle
case.

00:25:11.626 --> 00:25:14.156 A:middle
One other important thing to

00:25:14.156 --> 00:25:15.856 A:middle
remember is that contactless

00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:18.606 A:middle
readers you select must support

00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:19.996 A:middle
Apple's value-added services

00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:20.406 A:middle
protocol.

00:25:21.636 --> 00:25:22.916 A:middle
However, that's easier than

00:25:23.486 --> 00:25:23.596 A:middle
ever.

00:25:24.336 --> 00:25:26.436 A:middle
You can find readers from any of

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:27.446 A:middle
these companies that support

00:25:27.446 --> 00:25:28.006 A:middle
this protocol.

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:31.806 A:middle
Now, one final use of

00:25:31.806 --> 00:25:32.906 A:middle
contactless passes you may have

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:35.226 A:middle
seen in the Keynote, is student

00:25:35.226 --> 00:25:35.876 A:middle
ID cards.

00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:38.406 A:middle
Students will be able to use

00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:40.796 A:middle
these to access and pay anywhere

00:25:40.796 --> 00:25:42.466 A:middle
physical student ID cards are

00:25:42.466 --> 00:25:44.266 A:middle
used today, right from Wallet.

00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.656 A:middle
We worked closely with two

00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:47.746 A:middle
companies to bring student ID

00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:48.736 A:middle
cards to educational

00:25:48.736 --> 00:25:51.826 A:middle
institutions across the U.S. Now

00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:52.886 A:middle
for a demo of some of the

00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:54.476 A:middle
features that we've covered here

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:54.786 A:middle
today.

00:25:55.246 --> 00:25:56.246 A:middle
I would like to welcome to the

00:25:56.246 --> 00:25:57.736 A:middle
stage, my colleague, Katie.

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:06.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:06.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:07.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ben.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:10.766 A:middle
Hi, my name is Katie, and I'm an

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:12.206 A:middle
engineer on the Wallet and Apple

00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
Pay team.

00:26:13.526 --> 00:26:14.866 A:middle
Today, I'm going to be showing

00:26:14.866 --> 00:26:16.876 A:middle
you a Swift application, where a

00:26:16.876 --> 00:26:18.446 A:middle
user can purchase an event

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
ticket for a party that I'm

00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:21.006 A:middle
throwing this weekend for my

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:21.376 A:middle
team.

00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.416 A:middle
My colleagues will be able to

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.376 A:middle
use the app in order to purchase

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:27.046 A:middle
a ticket, and make me a little

00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:27.836 A:middle
money on the side.

00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:30.436 A:middle
This app will demonstrate two

00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:30.796 A:middle
things.

00:26:31.816 --> 00:26:33.566 A:middle
First, how to use the best

00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:35.636 A:middle
practices and new API's that Ben

00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:37.376 A:middle
had mentioned earlier in order

00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:38.586 A:middle
to create the most seamless

00:26:38.826 --> 00:26:40.566 A:middle
Wallet and Apple Pay experience.

00:26:41.426 --> 00:26:44.566 A:middle
And, second, how to structure

00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
your pass's JSON in order to

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:46.856 A:middle
enhance your customer's

00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:47.376 A:middle
experience.

00:26:48.496 --> 00:26:51.016 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and take a

00:26:51.016 --> 00:26:51.976 A:middle
look at this app.

00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:53.676 A:middle
So, here we're presented with a

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.946 A:middle
summary about the event, a date,

00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:57.696 A:middle
a time, a location, and a cost.

00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:00.356 A:middle
Here's an example of

00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:00.356 A:middle
Here's an example of

00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:01.876 A:middle
upstreaming, where we place the

00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:03.206 A:middle
Buy with Apple Pay button

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:04.656 A:middle
directly on the product page.

00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.866 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and purchase

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:09.976 A:middle
this ticket.

00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:11.166 A:middle
You can see, we're presented

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.376 A:middle
with the Apple Pay sheet, and

00:27:14.156 --> 00:27:15.766 A:middle
this is a good example of

00:27:16.146 --> 00:27:18.166 A:middle
streamlining, asking the user

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:19.116 A:middle
for the least amount of

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:20.166 A:middle
information possible.

00:27:20.196 --> 00:27:21.596 A:middle
In this case, only their email

00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:21.856 A:middle
address.

00:27:22.456 --> 00:27:24.076 A:middle
So, let me go ahead and Face ID

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.246 A:middle
in order to complete this

00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:25.606 A:middle
purchase.

00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:34.566 A:middle
Here, we're shown more

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:35.776 A:middle
information about what we just

00:27:35.776 --> 00:27:36.876 A:middle
bought, about the event.

00:27:36.876 --> 00:27:39.446 A:middle
And, here at the bottom we have

00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:41.856 A:middle
a QR code, and all the way below

00:27:41.856 --> 00:27:43.566 A:middle
that, obstructed from view, is

00:27:43.566 --> 00:27:45.016 A:middle
an Add to Apple Wallet button.

00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:47.416 A:middle
You might have seen many apps in

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.866 A:middle
the App Store today do something

00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:50.906 A:middle
like this, embedding a QR code

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:51.376 A:middle
in their app.

00:27:52.386 --> 00:27:53.956 A:middle
If you have a QR code on the

00:27:53.956 --> 00:27:55.336 A:middle
front of your pass, there's no

00:27:55.336 --> 00:27:56.856 A:middle
need to embed it within your

00:27:57.856 --> 00:27:57.936 A:middle
app.

00:27:58.256 --> 00:27:59.986 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and add this

00:27:59.986 --> 00:28:00.296 A:middle
pass to Wallet.

00:27:59.986 --> 00:28:00.296 A:middle
pass to Wallet.

00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:04.526 A:middle
You can see, we're presented

00:28:04.526 --> 00:28:07.166 A:middle
with the pass for the user to

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:07.596 A:middle
review.

00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:09.536 A:middle
It has information about the

00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:10.816 A:middle
event, and a QR code.

00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:12.576 A:middle
So, let's add it.

00:28:15.596 --> 00:28:17.486 A:middle
Now, let's go over to the JSON,

00:28:17.666 --> 00:28:19.436 A:middle
and-- for this pass, and see

00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:20.506 A:middle
what changes we can make in

00:28:20.506 --> 00:28:21.956 A:middle
order to enhance the customer's

00:28:21.956 --> 00:28:22.526 A:middle
experience.

00:28:25.316 --> 00:28:26.646 A:middle
There are two major changes I

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:27.316 A:middle
want to make here.

00:28:28.276 --> 00:28:30.196 A:middle
First, when people come to my

00:28:30.196 --> 00:28:31.596 A:middle
event, I want to check them in

00:28:31.596 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
using a contactless reader.

00:28:33.976 --> 00:28:36.716 A:middle
And, second, when the user gets

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:39.166 A:middle
close to my event location, and

00:28:39.266 --> 00:28:41.066 A:middle
in this case, Discovery Meadow,

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.696 A:middle
I want the pass to become

00:28:42.696 --> 00:28:43.966 A:middle
relevant on the lock screen.

00:28:44.606 --> 00:28:47.116 A:middle
So, let's first take a look at

00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:48.476 A:middle
this barcode dictionary here.

00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:50.706 A:middle
Since I'm going to be checking

00:28:50.706 --> 00:28:52.626 A:middle
people in using a contactless

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:54.416 A:middle
reader, there's no need to have

00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:55.956 A:middle
a QR code on the front anymore.

00:28:56.326 --> 00:28:57.176 A:middle
So, let's remove this

00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:57.726 A:middle
dictionary.

00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:00.696 A:middle
And, instead, let's replace it

00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:00.696 A:middle
And, instead, let's replace it

00:29:00.696 --> 00:29:01.956 A:middle
with an NFC dictionary.

00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:06.286 A:middle
Here, this dictionary contains

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.446 A:middle
information that we've passed

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:09.676 A:middle
from the device to the reader in

00:29:09.676 --> 00:29:11.306 A:middle
order to identify them when they

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:12.446 A:middle
check in.

00:29:13.196 --> 00:29:15.496 A:middle
Next, let's add location data to

00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:17.026 A:middle
this pass, so it can become

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:18.206 A:middle
relevant on the lock screen.

00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.006 A:middle
Here, we set a latitude, a

00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:25.476 A:middle
longitude, in this case it's

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:27.286 A:middle
Discovery Meadow, and relevant

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:28.446 A:middle
text that will be displayed in

00:29:28.446 --> 00:29:29.716 A:middle
the notification on the lock

00:29:29.776 --> 00:29:29.976 A:middle
screen.

00:29:32.066 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:35.716 A:middle
Swift application, in order to

00:29:35.716 --> 00:29:37.016 A:middle
see what changes we can make

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:37.706 A:middle
there as well.

00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:42.666 A:middle
Let's first take a look at this

00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:44.156 A:middle
presentAddPass method.

00:29:44.836 --> 00:29:47.086 A:middle
This was called when we tapped

00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:47.976 A:middle
the Add to Wallet button.

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:52.176 A:middle
Here, we got the pass from a

00:29:52.176 --> 00:29:53.276 A:middle
function we called, called

00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:53.666 A:middle
eventPass.

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:56.396 A:middle
Let's go ahead and replace this

00:29:56.396 --> 00:29:57.686 A:middle
with our newly modified pass.

00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:03.016 A:middle
We then instantiated a

00:30:03.016 --> 00:30:05.006 A:middle
PKAddPassesViewController with

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:07.906 A:middle
that pass, and presented it.

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:09.816 A:middle
But, as Ben had mentioned

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.626 A:middle
earlier, there's a better API we

00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:12.686 A:middle
can use in order to

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.106 A:middle
automatically add passes to

00:30:14.106 --> 00:30:14.436 A:middle
Wallet.

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and remove

00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:17.716 A:middle
these two lines of code, and

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:18.746 A:middle
replace it with that API.

00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.856 A:middle
That API's on the PKPass

00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:24.206 A:middle
library, so let's create an

00:30:24.206 --> 00:30:24.956 A:middle
instance of that.

00:30:27.396 --> 00:30:29.006 A:middle
And, let's call the API.

00:30:31.176 --> 00:30:33.096 A:middle
The function's called addPasses.

00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:36.206 A:middle
Takes an array of passes, has a

00:30:36.206 --> 00:30:37.586 A:middle
completion handler with a

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:38.026 A:middle
status.

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:39.716 A:middle
And, there are three possible

00:30:39.716 --> 00:30:40.956 A:middle
statuses that can be returned.

00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:44.146 A:middle
DidAddPasses, which means the

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:45.456 A:middle
user wants to add the pass to

00:30:45.456 --> 00:30:45.786 A:middle
Wallet.

00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:48.626 A:middle
DidCancelAddPasses, which means

00:30:48.626 --> 00:30:49.526 A:middle
the user does not want to add

00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:50.236 A:middle
the pass to Wallet.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:52.266 A:middle
And, shouldReviewPasses.

00:30:52.306 --> 00:30:55.116 A:middle
In this case, the user wishes to

00:30:55.116 --> 00:30:56.376 A:middle
be presented with a preview of

00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:58.886 A:middle
the pass before deciding to add

00:30:58.886 --> 00:30:59.616 A:middle
it to Wallet or not.

00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:01.886 A:middle
And, if this is the case, you

00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.876 A:middle
should do what we did previously

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:05.466 A:middle
and instantiate a

00:31:05.796 --> 00:31:07.426 A:middle
PKAddPassesViewController and

00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:07.906 A:middle
present it.

00:31:10.256 --> 00:31:11.436 A:middle
Now, let's go up to the

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:12.206 A:middle
viewDidLoad method.

00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:14.486 A:middle
As we saw, there was a QR code

00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:14.616 A:middle
here.

00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
Again, if your pass has a QR

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.836 A:middle
code on the front, there's no

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.136 A:middle
need to have it in your app.

00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
And, since our pass is now

00:31:22.396 --> 00:31:24.126 A:middle
NFC-capable, we don't need this

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:24.956 A:middle
view anymore.

00:31:25.146 --> 00:31:26.536 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and remove

00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:26.976 A:middle
these lines of code.

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:36.416 A:middle
Here is the PKAddPassButton, or

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:38.856 A:middle
our Add to Wallet button.

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:40.726 A:middle
In order to-- another way to

00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:42.606 A:middle
enhance the user's experience is

00:31:42.966 --> 00:31:44.536 A:middle
when the summary view is

00:31:44.566 --> 00:31:45.656 A:middle
presented right after they've

00:31:45.736 --> 00:31:47.126 A:middle
purchased the ticket, we

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:49.786 A:middle
immediately ask them if they

00:31:49.786 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
want to add the pass to Wallet,

00:31:51.266 --> 00:31:52.556 A:middle
rather than having a button

00:31:52.556 --> 00:31:53.146 A:middle
onscreen.

00:31:54.076 --> 00:31:55.936 A:middle
Of course, you can have this Add

00:31:55.936 --> 00:31:57.686 A:middle
to Apple Wallet button somewhere

00:31:57.686 --> 00:31:58.866 A:middle
else in your app, if the user

00:31:58.866 --> 00:32:00.756 A:middle
decides to add the pass later.

00:31:58.866 --> 00:32:00.756 A:middle
decides to add the pass later.

00:32:02.216 --> 00:32:03.386 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and remove

00:32:03.386 --> 00:32:03.986 A:middle
this button.

00:32:03.986 --> 00:32:08.216 A:middle
And, instead, we're going to

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:10.446 A:middle
replace it with a View in Wallet

00:32:10.446 --> 00:32:10.776 A:middle
button.

00:32:14.046 --> 00:32:15.776 A:middle
That way, the user can tap this

00:32:15.776 --> 00:32:16.946 A:middle
button, and they'll be brought

00:32:16.946 --> 00:32:18.366 A:middle
directly to a Wallet, and be

00:32:18.366 --> 00:32:19.606 A:middle
shown the pass that they just

00:32:19.776 --> 00:32:19.966 A:middle
added.

00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:25.366 A:middle
And, finally, when the view is

00:32:25.426 --> 00:32:27.046 A:middle
presented, let's immediately ask

00:32:27.126 --> 00:32:27.886 A:middle
them if they want to add the

00:32:27.886 --> 00:32:27.976 A:middle
pass.

00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:32.706 A:middle
Now, that we've made these

00:32:32.706 --> 00:32:34.416 A:middle
changes, let's deploy to the

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.866 A:middle
device, and see what it looks

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:35.976 A:middle
like.

00:32:45.356 --> 00:32:46.356 A:middle
Again, we're presented with the

00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
same view, a summary about the

00:32:48.786 --> 00:32:48.996 A:middle
event.

00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:50.376 A:middle
I'll go ahead and purchase this

00:32:50.376 --> 00:32:50.976 A:middle
pass again.

00:33:00.056 --> 00:33:00.946 A:middle
And now, you can see we're

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:02.536 A:middle
immediately asked if we want to

00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.446 A:middle
add the pass to Wallet.

00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:04.816 A:middle
And, you can see in the

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.666 A:middle
background code, the QR code is

00:33:06.746 --> 00:33:07.306 A:middle
no longer there.

00:33:07.456 --> 00:33:10.986 A:middle
And, the Add to Apple Wallet

00:33:10.986 --> 00:33:12.226 A:middle
button is replaced with the View

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
in Wallet button.

00:33:13.466 --> 00:33:14.976 A:middle
So, I want to add this pass to

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:15.276 A:middle
Wallet.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:17.976 A:middle
And, let's go ahead and view it.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.456 A:middle
You see, we're immediately taken

00:33:21.456 --> 00:33:23.116 A:middle
to the pass, and you can see the

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:24.436 A:middle
QR code is no longer on the

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:24.766 A:middle
front.

00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:26.596 A:middle
And, instead we have a Hold Near

00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:28.496 A:middle
Reader displayed at the bottom,

00:33:28.496 --> 00:33:29.856 A:middle
meaning that our pass is now

00:33:29.856 --> 00:33:32.496 A:middle
contactless, and I could scan it

00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:33.636 A:middle
a reader when I arrive at the

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:33.966 A:middle
event.

00:33:35.436 --> 00:33:37.276 A:middle
Now, let's lock the device, and

00:33:37.276 --> 00:33:38.626 A:middle
since we're close to Discovery

00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:40.516 A:middle
Meadow here in San Jose, let's

00:33:40.516 --> 00:33:42.626 A:middle
see if the pass is relevant on

00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:42.976 A:middle
the lock screen.

00:33:46.176 --> 00:33:47.586 A:middle
Here's the notification for the

00:33:47.586 --> 00:33:49.646 A:middle
pass with the text that we set

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:50.436 A:middle
in the JSON.

00:33:51.106 --> 00:33:52.306 A:middle
Let's tap our notification.

00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:54.466 A:middle
The pass is immediately

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.236 A:middle
displayed, and I happen to have

00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:57.976 A:middle
a contactless reader here on

00:33:57.976 --> 00:33:59.326 A:middle
stage, so let's simulate me

00:33:59.326 --> 00:33:59.976 A:middle
arriving at the event.

00:34:03.266 --> 00:34:04.376 A:middle
And, it's as simple as that.

00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:09.416 A:middle
We hope that you can adopt these

00:34:09.456 --> 00:34:11.136 A:middle
simple changes in order to

00:34:11.136 --> 00:34:12.255 A:middle
enhance your customer's

00:34:12.255 --> 00:34:13.976 A:middle
experience when they interact

00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:15.636 A:middle
with Wallet and Apple Pay in

00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:16.196 A:middle
your app.

00:34:17.065 --> 00:34:18.356 A:middle
And now, I'll hand it back over

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:18.786 A:middle
to Ben.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:23.045 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:23.545 --> 00:34:24.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Katie, for that

00:34:24.246 --> 00:34:25.025 A:middle
fantastic demo.

00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:26.916 A:middle
What an improvement those

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.376 A:middle
changes made to the experience.

00:34:29.326 --> 00:34:31.246 A:middle
So, the final topic we want to

00:34:31.246 --> 00:34:33.676 A:middle
cover today is digital to

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:34.636 A:middle
physical commerce.

00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:36.996 A:middle
Now, using Apple Pay is a great

00:34:36.996 --> 00:34:38.616 A:middle
way to buy, but that's not where

00:34:38.616 --> 00:34:39.786 A:middle
the user's journey ends.

00:34:40.835 --> 00:34:42.106 A:middle
It's important to carry through

00:34:42.106 --> 00:34:43.326 A:middle
that seamless experience into

00:34:43.326 --> 00:34:44.045 A:middle
the physical world.

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.466 A:middle
Now, to do that, I want to show

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:47.076 A:middle
you two examples.

00:34:47.596 --> 00:34:48.766 A:middle
Starting with the Caffe Macs

00:34:48.766 --> 00:34:50.436 A:middle
app, that's used by thousands of

00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:51.826 A:middle
employees every day at Apple

00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:52.156 A:middle
Park.

00:34:53.976 --> 00:34:55.666 A:middle
Here, I launched the app, and

00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.206 A:middle
I'm immediately presented with

00:34:57.206 --> 00:34:58.466 A:middle
the best offers on offer today.

00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
It's a great way to engage me.

00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
It's a great way to engage me.

00:35:01.336 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
It doesn't require me to browse

00:35:02.996 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
through all the items in the

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:04.296 A:middle
app.

00:35:05.256 --> 00:35:07.036 A:middle
You might be wondering why you

00:35:07.036 --> 00:35:08.056 A:middle
don't see the Apple Pay button

00:35:08.056 --> 00:35:08.486 A:middle
immediately.

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:10.246 A:middle
And, that's because I'm not

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:11.166 A:middle
inside Caffe Macs.

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:14.266 A:middle
As soon as I get close, using

00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:16.426 A:middle
GPS and Bluetooth beacons, the

00:35:16.426 --> 00:35:17.956 A:middle
app detects that change, and the

00:35:17.956 --> 00:35:18.576 A:middle
button appears.

00:35:19.546 --> 00:35:20.946 A:middle
This allows me to buy right from

00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:21.746 A:middle
the starting page.

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:22.896 A:middle
It's a great example of

00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:23.326 A:middle
upstreaming.

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:26.216 A:middle
Sometimes I order more than one

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:27.416 A:middle
thing, and Caffe Macs has me

00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:27.716 A:middle
covered.

00:35:28.976 --> 00:35:30.526 A:middle
They support both the multi-item

00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:32.736 A:middle
express checkout, as well as a

00:35:32.736 --> 00:35:34.656 A:middle
single-item purchase flow right

00:35:34.656 --> 00:35:35.426 A:middle
from the product page.

00:35:36.526 --> 00:35:38.116 A:middle
I can also check out from

00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:39.636 A:middle
anywhere in the app, using the

00:35:39.636 --> 00:35:40.416 A:middle
Pay tab below.

00:35:40.416 --> 00:35:43.156 A:middle
Now, this is a great pattern to

00:35:43.156 --> 00:35:44.486 A:middle
follow to make checkout easy.

00:35:45.636 --> 00:35:47.726 A:middle
When I'm ready to pay, I Face

00:35:47.726 --> 00:35:48.776 A:middle
ID, and I'm done.

00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:51.516 A:middle
Here, you can see that following

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.756 A:middle
our guidelines, and requesting

00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:53.806 A:middle
as little information as

00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:54.216 A:middle
possible.

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.376 A:middle
I'm already logged in across

00:35:56.376 --> 00:35:58.226 A:middle
multiple Apple apps, so no

00:35:58.226 --> 00:35:59.376 A:middle
additional fields are required.

00:35:59.376 --> 00:36:01.846 A:middle
However, if I wasn't, this would

00:35:59.376 --> 00:36:01.846 A:middle
However, if I wasn't, this would

00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:03.166 A:middle
be a really great place for you

00:36:03.546 --> 00:36:04.426 A:middle
to request the minimal

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:05.856 A:middle
information to make collection

00:36:05.856 --> 00:36:06.656 A:middle
of the items easier.

00:36:07.996 --> 00:36:09.916 A:middle
Finally, a confirmation to let

00:36:09.916 --> 00:36:11.186 A:middle
me know that the order's been

00:36:11.216 --> 00:36:12.496 A:middle
done, and I should wait for a

00:36:12.496 --> 00:36:13.136 A:middle
notification.

00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:15.156 A:middle
As I walk over to the pizza

00:36:15.156 --> 00:36:16.666 A:middle
station, the notification

00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:18.156 A:middle
arrives to let me know that it's

00:36:18.156 --> 00:36:18.386 A:middle
ready.

00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:21.596 A:middle
And, when I get there, my lunch

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:22.236 A:middle
is waiting for me.

00:36:22.326 --> 00:36:24.016 A:middle
A ticket with my name on it, and

00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:25.896 A:middle
a member of the Caffe Macs staff

00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:28.246 A:middle
confirms me by name, and I'm

00:36:28.246 --> 00:36:29.186 A:middle
away to devour my pizza.

00:36:30.386 --> 00:36:31.656 A:middle
Now, that's a great experience

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:32.886 A:middle
from start to finish.

00:36:33.356 --> 00:36:35.346 A:middle
And, another experience that we

00:36:35.346 --> 00:36:38.226 A:middle
love is a food ordering app from

00:36:38.226 --> 00:36:38.756 A:middle
China, [Chinese spoken].

00:36:39.576 --> 00:36:42.886 A:middle
Now, they start with using the

00:36:42.886 --> 00:36:44.026 A:middle
iPhone's camera to scan a QR

00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.016 A:middle
code when entering the

00:36:45.016 --> 00:36:45.446 A:middle
restaurant.

00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:46.946 A:middle
And, that takes them straight to

00:36:46.946 --> 00:36:49.086 A:middle
the menu in the [Chinese spoken]

00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:50.386 A:middle
app.

00:36:50.646 --> 00:36:52.286 A:middle
They use images in their menu to

00:36:52.286 --> 00:36:53.566 A:middle
make it easy to know what you

00:36:53.566 --> 00:36:55.446 A:middle
want, and how to checkout fast.

00:36:58.526 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
In the checkout flow, the app

00:36:58.526 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
In the checkout flow, the app

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.646 A:middle
offers the user a virtual

00:37:01.646 --> 00:37:04.516 A:middle
payment credential, issued by

00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:05.386 A:middle
[Chinese spoken], which uses our

00:37:05.386 --> 00:37:06.666 A:middle
in app provisioning flow to put

00:37:06.666 --> 00:37:08.106 A:middle
a card directly into Wallet.

00:37:08.936 --> 00:37:10.466 A:middle
Now, this works great even if

00:37:10.466 --> 00:37:12.366 A:middle
the user has no cards at all, in

00:37:12.366 --> 00:37:13.326 A:middle
Wallet or otherwise.

00:37:14.286 --> 00:37:15.866 A:middle
They can set one up, and order

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:16.396 A:middle
right away.

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:18.706 A:middle
And, the card that's provisioned

00:37:19.186 --> 00:37:20.936 A:middle
can be used in all e-commerce,

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:22.616 A:middle
and in-store merchants anywhere

00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:23.726 A:middle
in China that takes Apple Pay.

00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:26.946 A:middle
If you use a provisions

00:37:26.946 --> 00:37:27.686 A:middle
[inaudible] card into Wallet,

00:37:28.056 --> 00:37:29.646 A:middle
Apple Pay's the exclusive option

00:37:29.646 --> 00:37:30.256 A:middle
to checkout.

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:32.266 A:middle
Fantastic example of defaulting.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:36.356 A:middle
As soon as I Face ID, the food

00:37:36.356 --> 00:37:36.736 A:middle
is ordered.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.796 A:middle
That's a fantastic experience

00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:40.806 A:middle
bringing together all of these

00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:43.476 A:middle
technologies: GPS, beacons, the

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:45.416 A:middle
camera, in-app provisioning, and

00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:46.146 A:middle
notifications.

00:37:47.156 --> 00:37:48.746 A:middle
If you combine that with a great

00:37:48.746 --> 00:37:50.736 A:middle
physical customer experience--

00:37:51.856 --> 00:37:52.816 A:middle
you know, if you leverage

00:37:52.816 --> 00:37:53.686 A:middle
everything we've shown you here

00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:55.586 A:middle
today, you too can build digital

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:56.496 A:middle
to physical commerce

00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:57.096 A:middle
experiences.

00:37:58.136 --> 00:37:59.596 A:middle
So, I have one piece of final

00:37:59.596 --> 00:38:00.126 A:middle
housekeeping.

00:37:59.596 --> 00:38:00.126 A:middle
housekeeping.

00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:02.826 A:middle
If you are a payment processor,

00:38:03.086 --> 00:38:04.716 A:middle
or a merchant, most of you don't

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.296 A:middle
need to worry, but you should

00:38:06.296 --> 00:38:07.736 A:middle
just check your server-side

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.836 A:middle
certificate expiry dates in the

00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:09.426 A:middle
developer portal.

00:38:10.326 --> 00:38:13.016 A:middle
They are easy to renew, and you

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:15.136 A:middle
should renew before expiry to

00:38:15.136 --> 00:38:16.566 A:middle
avoid disruption taking Apple

00:38:17.246 --> 00:38:17.316 A:middle
Pay.

00:38:18.036 --> 00:38:19.256 A:middle
That's everything we have to

00:38:19.286 --> 00:38:19.936 A:middle
talk about today.

00:38:20.336 --> 00:38:21.686 A:middle
If you want to learn more, our

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.676 A:middle
online documentation can be

00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:24.186 A:middle
found here.

00:38:24.876 --> 00:38:25.846 A:middle
And, if you have any questions

00:38:25.846 --> 00:38:27.366 A:middle
about Wallet, Apple Pay, or Core

00:38:27.366 --> 00:38:29.386 A:middle
NFC, you can join us immediately

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:35.556 A:middle
Bye.

00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:38.000 A:middle
