00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:25.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:32.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Session 403,

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:35.746 A:middle
What's New in Testing.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.326 A:middle
My name is Honza Dvorsky and I

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.856 A:middle
will share the stage today with

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.346 A:middle
my colleague, Ethan Vaughan.

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:45.286 A:middle
Today, we'll start by talking

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:46.326 A:middle
about the code's coverage

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.756 A:middle
improvements we made in Xcode

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.386 A:middle
9.3.

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:50.686 A:middle
Then we'll look at the test

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:52.396 A:middle
selection and ordering features

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:53.926 A:middle
new in Xcode 10.

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:56.526 A:middle
And finally, Ethan will come up

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:58.406 A:middle
on stage to tell you about how

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.076 A:middle
you can speed up your tests by


00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.076 A:middle
you can speed up your tests by

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:01.236 A:middle
running them in parallel.

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:04.116 A:middle
Let's kick off with code

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:04.575 A:middle
coverage.

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:08.196 A:middle
We completely reworked code

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:10.776 A:middle
coverage in Xcode 9.3 and this

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.826 A:middle
resulted in many performance and

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:15.576 A:middle
accuracy improvements and it

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.166 A:middle
allowed us to add a new feature

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:18.506 A:middle
so that you have the granular

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.486 A:middle
control over which targets

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:22.036 A:middle
contribute to code coverage.

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:25.486 A:middle
We created a new command line

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:28.746 A:middle
tool called xccov and last but

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:30.616 A:middle
not least, we gave code coverage

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.346 A:middle
in the source editor a visual

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:32.866 A:middle
refresh.

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.246 A:middle
Let's look at all of these in

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:35.616 A:middle
detail.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.716 A:middle
First, to give you a sense of

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:40.446 A:middle
how much better code coverage is

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:42.616 A:middle
now, we measured it on a large

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:46.076 A:middle
internal project at Apple.

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.756 A:middle
To understand the speed, we

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.486 A:middle
measured how long it took Xcode

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.486 A:middle
to load and show code coverage

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:52.366 A:middle
in the source editor.

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:56.486 A:middle
In Xcode 9, it took about six

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:59.786 A:middle
and a half seconds to do that.

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:01.656 A:middle
In Xcode 9.3, however, we got it


00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:01.656 A:middle
In Xcode 9.3, however, we got it

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.706 A:middle
down to less than a half a

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.716 A:middle
second, which is more than 95%

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:05.276 A:middle
faster.

00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:11.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:13.816 A:middle
But we also wanted to make the

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:16.206 A:middle
coverage file smaller, as Xcode

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:17.546 A:middle
can potentially write out many

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:19.026 A:middle
of them, if you run your test

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.516 A:middle
often, as you should, so I'm

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.796 A:middle
happy to say that here, the

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.046 A:middle
improvements are just as

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:25.246 A:middle
dramatic.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.826 A:middle
Xcode 9's coverage files were

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.486 A:middle
over 200 megabytes in size.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.866 A:middle
And this is a lot but remember

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.246 A:middle
that we're talking about a large

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:35.096 A:middle
project with thousands of source

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:35.596 A:middle
files.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:39.956 A:middle
But files written by Xcode 9.3

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:41.586 A:middle
were less than a tenth of that.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:46.726 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.736 A:middle
I'm sure you appreciate this if

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:49.926 A:middle
you maintain a continuous

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.806 A:middle
integration machine or if you're

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.466 A:middle
just running low on disk space.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:55.796 A:middle
But the best part is that not

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.086 A:middle
only are the coverage files

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:59.346 A:middle
smaller and faster to read and

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
write, they're also more


00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
write, they're also more

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
accurate than ever before.

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:05.056 A:middle
One example of this is header

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:05.606 A:middle
files.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.246 A:middle
Xcode 9 didn't correctly collect

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.396 A:middle
and show coverage in header

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:11.666 A:middle
files and this was a problem for

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.106 A:middle
a code basis that used C++ as in

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:15.546 A:middle
that language, you can have a

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.276 A:middle
good portion of your executable

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
code in headers.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:20.826 A:middle
So, if you're one of the people

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.106 A:middle
affected, you'll be happy to

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:24.006 A:middle
hear that Xcode now correctly

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.296 A:middle
gathers and presents code

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.316 A:middle
coverage for both implementation

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:28.336 A:middle
and header files.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.916 A:middle
Now let's talk about code

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.006 A:middle
coverage features.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:34.686 A:middle
The first one is target

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:35.346 A:middle
selection.

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:38.466 A:middle
This is a new option to control

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.876 A:middle
not only whether code coverage

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:42.136 A:middle
is enabled or disabled but when

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.506 A:middle
it's enabled, you actually

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.416 A:middle
control which targets are

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:46.886 A:middle
included.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.476 A:middle
This can be important if your

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:50.816 A:middle
project builds third-party

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:52.516 A:middle
dependencies that you're not

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.156 A:middle
expected to cover by your tests

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:55.986 A:middle
or if you work at a company

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.906 A:middle
where another team supplies you

00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:59.176 A:middle
with a framework that they

00:03:59.176 --> 00:03:59.916 A:middle
already tested.


00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:03.616 A:middle
You can customize the included

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:05.756 A:middle
targets in this scheme's test

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:07.566 A:middle
action under options.

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:10.386 A:middle
This means that it can continue

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:12.446 A:middle
to include all targets in code

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:14.346 A:middle
coverage or only hand pick some

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:14.826 A:middle
of them.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:19.125 A:middle
Now in the name of more powerful

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.726 A:middle
workflows, we created a new

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:22.366 A:middle
command-line tool called xccov.

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:25.936 A:middle
It can be integrated into

00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:27.876 A:middle
automation scripts easily, as it

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.786 A:middle
produces both human readable and

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:31.196 A:middle
machine parseable outputs.

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:33.776 A:middle
And at the high level, it gives

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:36.156 A:middle
you detailed view of your

00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:36.836 A:middle
coverage data.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:38.746 A:middle
So, I've mentioned the code

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:40.166 A:middle
coverage data a couple of times,

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:41.846 A:middle
let's look at how it looks under

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:42.866 A:middle
the hood.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.526 A:middle
When tests are run with code

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:47.476 A:middle
coverage enabled, Xcode

00:04:47.476 --> 00:04:48.786 A:middle
generates two files.

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:52.166 A:middle
First is the coverage report, or

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.976 A:middle
the xccovreport file extension,

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:55.646 A:middle
and that contains the line --

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:58.766 A:middle
line coverage percentages for

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
each target, source file, and


00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
each target, source file, and

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:01.566 A:middle
function.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.726 A:middle
The second one is the coverage

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:06.716 A:middle
archive and that contains the

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:08.976 A:middle
raw execution counts for each of

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.326 A:middle
the files in the report.

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:14.996 A:middle
And these coverage files live in

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
your project's derived data

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:18.856 A:middle
directory and additionally, if

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:20.816 A:middle
you pass the result bundle path

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:23.626 A:middle
flag to Xcode build, these files

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:25.686 A:middle
will be placed into the result

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:28.176 A:middle
bundle as well.

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:29.686 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:31.666 A:middle
Here, we use xccov to view the

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:35.286 A:middle
coverage data of our Hello World

00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:35.926 A:middle
app.

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:37.776 A:middle
We can see the overall coverage

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:40.326 A:middle
for each target but also

00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:42.186 A:middle
detailed coverage for each file

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.376 A:middle
and even for each method.

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:48.466 A:middle
And of course, by passing the

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:51.026 A:middle
right flag identification, you

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:52.146 A:middle
can get the same exact

00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:54.326 A:middle
information in JSON.

00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:57.356 A:middle
This can make it much easier to

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.666 A:middle
integrate with other tools.


00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:01.396 A:middle
So, as you can see, xccov is

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:02.846 A:middle
very flexible, so I would

00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:04.106 A:middle
encourage you to explore its

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:04.826 A:middle
documentation.

00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:09.816 A:middle
Now we talked about use --

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:11.576 A:middle
viewing code coverage on the

00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:13.026 A:middle
command line but the most

00:06:13.026 --> 00:06:14.616 A:middle
convenient way is still going to

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.066 A:middle
be to see it right next to your

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:16.666 A:middle
source code.

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.796 A:middle
You control whether code

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.026 A:middle
coverage is shown by selecting

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:24.346 A:middle
editor, show, or hide code

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:24.906 A:middle
coverage.

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:29.986 A:middle
When you do enable it, you'll

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.216 A:middle
see the refreshed look of code

00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:32.426 A:middle
coverage in the source editor.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:34.836 A:middle
The whole line highlights when

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:36.156 A:middle
you hover over the execution

00:06:36.156 --> 00:06:37.666 A:middle
count on the right-hand side.

00:06:38.796 --> 00:06:40.426 A:middle
And this is just the best way to

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:42.016 A:middle
keep an eye on which of your

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:43.756 A:middle
code is already covered by tests

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:47.466 A:middle
and which still needs more work.

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.456 A:middle
Now let me show you all of these

00:06:49.456 --> 00:06:50.486 A:middle
improvements in action.


00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:03.116 A:middle
So, here I have a project called

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:03.806 A:middle
Dev Cast.

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:05.986 A:middle
It's a simple messaging app and

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.596 A:middle
I created the iOS version for

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:08.566 A:middle
this talk last year.

00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:10.066 A:middle
So, this year, I wanted to

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.206 A:middle
create a Mac version.

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:13.396 A:middle
But I wanted to share the

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:14.956 A:middle
business logic between the iOS

00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:16.296 A:middle
and Mac versions, so I put it

00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:17.656 A:middle
all into a framework called

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:20.886 A:middle
DevCastkit and today, my goal is

00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:22.726 A:middle
to explore and maybe improve the

00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:24.496 A:middle
code coverage of this framework.

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:26.986 A:middle
So, right now, I'm not

00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:28.296 A:middle
collecting code coverage, so I

00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:29.376 A:middle
just need to turn it on.

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:32.146 A:middle
I'll do that by selecting the

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.756 A:middle
scheme, selecting edit scheme,

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:38.286 A:middle
go into the test action, go into

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:38.846 A:middle
options.

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:42.216 A:middle
And down here, I will just

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:43.366 A:middle
enable code coverage.

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.106 A:middle
Now I will run my test by going

00:07:49.106 --> 00:07:50.496 A:middle
to product test.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:53.446 A:middle
Right now, my framework, my test

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.066 A:middle
bundle and my Mac app are

00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:57.316 A:middle
getting built, and my tests are

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:57.866 A:middle
being run.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
Now the test finished so let's


00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
Now the test finished so let's

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:02.296 A:middle
look at the results.

00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:03.906 A:middle
We'll go to the report navigator

00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:06.486 A:middle
and to the latest coverage

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.016 A:middle
reports.

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:11.566 A:middle
Here, I can see that I have the

00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:14.306 A:middle
-- both targets, the Mac app and

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:15.106 A:middle
also the framework.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:18.606 A:middle
Now the Mac app only serves as a

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:20.826 A:middle
container for running tests, so

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:22.066 A:middle
I'm not really concerned about

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:23.316 A:middle
its low code coverage.

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.146 A:middle
In fact, I would actually not

00:08:25.146 --> 00:08:26.836 A:middle
want to see it in this report at

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:27.226 A:middle
all.

00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:30.316 A:middle
So, I can do that by editing the

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:31.006 A:middle
scheme again.

00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:37.056 A:middle
And in the test action, here --

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:38.285 A:middle
instead of gathering coverage

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:40.686 A:middle
for all targets, I'll change to

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.666 A:middle
just some targets.

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:44.906 A:middle
This gives me a hard cover list

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:47.476 A:middle
and I will add just the target

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:48.836 A:middle
that I'm interested in, which is

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
the framework.

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:56.186 A:middle
Now I will rerun my tests and

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
look at the updated coverage


00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
look at the updated coverage

00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:01.636 A:middle
reports.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.716 A:middle
So, now you can see that I only

00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:05.906 A:middle
have the framework in the

00:09:05.906 --> 00:09:06.566 A:middle
coverage report.

00:09:06.736 --> 00:09:07.696 A:middle
This is what I wanted.

00:09:08.226 --> 00:09:09.986 A:middle
So, now I can just focus on this

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:10.626 A:middle
one target.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.636 A:middle
So, looking at the coverage

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:15.086 A:middle
percentage, is at 84%, which is

00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:16.706 A:middle
not bad, but I know I can do

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:17.116 A:middle
better.

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:18.996 A:middle
So, to understand which of the

00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:21.116 A:middle
files need more attention, I

00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:24.056 A:middle
will disclose the target and see

00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:25.566 A:middle
that the first file is only

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.466 A:middle
covered at about 66%.

00:09:28.506 --> 00:09:30.196 A:middle
So, I'll jump to the file by

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:31.216 A:middle
clicking on the arrow here.

00:09:31.816 --> 00:09:36.456 A:middle
And here, I'll look at my local

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:37.346 A:middle
server class.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:39.536 A:middle
On the right-hand side, I can

00:09:39.536 --> 00:09:41.046 A:middle
see the execution counts for

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:43.096 A:middle
each region of the code so I can

00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:44.846 A:middle
see that all of the executable

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:47.216 A:middle
parts of my class are covered by

00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:47.756 A:middle
tests.

00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:48.676 A:middle
This is good.

00:09:49.396 --> 00:09:50.936 A:middle
Unfortunately, my convenience

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
function, get recent messages,

00:09:52.916 --> 00:09:54.206 A:middle
hasn't been called for my tests

00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:55.566 A:middle
at all, so I don't know if it's

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:56.316 A:middle
working properly.

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:59.496 A:middle
To fix that, I'll go to the

00:09:59.496 --> 00:10:03.526 A:middle
corresponding test file and I


00:09:59.496 --> 00:10:03.526 A:middle
corresponding test file and I

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.916 A:middle
will add a new test.

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:09.126 A:middle
This test just puts a couple of

00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:11.896 A:middle
messages into a local server and

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:12.966 A:middle
then I call, get recent

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:14.476 A:middle
messages, on it to verify that

00:10:14.476 --> 00:10:15.906 A:middle
it returns what I'm expecting.

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:19.696 A:middle
So, with the new test added, I

00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:21.126 A:middle
will rerun my tests one more

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:21.476 A:middle
time.

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:27.356 A:middle
So, great, the test finished.

00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:28.826 A:middle
I'll go to the coverage report

00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:32.836 A:middle
again and now when I focus on my

00:10:32.836 --> 00:10:33.986 A:middle
framework, I can see that it's

00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.286 A:middle
covered at 100%.

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:36.786 A:middle
This is exactly what I wanted.

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:40.816 A:middle
So, we saw how I used the target

00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:42.336 A:middle
selection feature to only focus

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:43.626 A:middle
on some of the targets.

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:45.806 A:middle
Then I used the coverage report

00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:47.456 A:middle
to know exactly which file to

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:48.126 A:middle
focus on.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:50.076 A:middle
And finally, I used the code

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.236 A:middle
coverage integration in the

00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:53.176 A:middle
source editor to know exactly

00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:54.626 A:middle
which part of my code still

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.336 A:middle
needs covering.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:57.936 A:middle
So, this is the improved code

00:10:57.936 --> 00:10:58.756 A:middle
coverage in Xcode.


00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:08.026 A:middle
So, moving on from code

00:11:08.026 --> 00:11:10.536 A:middle
coverage, let's talk about some

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:11.986 A:middle
new features in Xcode 10.

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:14.576 A:middle
First, we'll see how we can now

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:18.236 A:middle
better select and order our

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:19.346 A:middle
tests.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.886 A:middle
Now why is this important?

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.636 A:middle
Well, not all the tests in your

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:26.216 A:middle
suite serve the same purpose.

00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:28.796 A:middle
You might want to run all 1000

00:11:28.796 --> 00:11:30.556 A:middle
of your quick running unit tests

00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:32.436 A:middle
before every single commit but

00:11:32.436 --> 00:11:34.426 A:middle
only run your 10 long-running UI

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:35.786 A:middle
tests at night.

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.096 A:middle
And you can achieve this today

00:11:38.096 --> 00:11:40.076 A:middle
by disabling specific tests in

00:11:40.076 --> 00:11:40.586 A:middle
your scheme.

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:44.686 A:middle
The scheme encodes the list of

00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:47.066 A:middle
disabled tests so that XE test

00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:48.966 A:middle
knows which tests to skip.

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:51.376 A:middle
And this has an interesting side

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:51.706 A:middle
effect.

00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:54.096 A:middle
Whenever you write a new test,

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:55.736 A:middle
it's automatically added to all

00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.036 A:middle
the schemes that contain the

00:11:57.036 --> 00:11:58.436 A:middle
corresponding test targets.

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.126 A:middle
But if that's not what you


00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.126 A:middle
But if that's not what you

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
wanted, you have to go through

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.906 A:middle
all those schemes and disable

00:12:02.906 --> 00:12:04.426 A:middle
the test there manually.

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
So, in Xcode 10, we're

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.176 A:middle
introducing a new mode for

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.516 A:middle
schemes to instead, encode the

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:10.566 A:middle
tests to run.

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.746 A:middle
If you switch your scheme to

00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:15.756 A:middle
that mode, only the test that

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:18.526 A:middle
you hand pick will run in that

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:21.026 A:middle
scheme.

00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:22.486 A:middle
You control this mode in the

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:24.026 A:middle
scheme editors test action,

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.306 A:middle
where in the list of test

00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:27.806 A:middle
targets, there's a new options

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
pop-up, where you can declare

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:30.316 A:middle
whether the scheme should

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:31.796 A:middle
automatically include new tests

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.266 A:middle
or not.

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:34.956 A:middle
This way, some of your schemes

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:36.526 A:middle
can continue to run any new

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.206 A:middle
tests you write, while other

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.136 A:middle
schemes will only run a list of

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:43.386 A:middle
hand-picked tests.

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:45.866 A:middle
So, we've discussed how we can

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.016 A:middle
better control which of our

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.696 A:middle
tests run and when, but the

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:50.386 A:middle
order of our tests can be

00:12:50.386 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
significant too.

00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:55.376 A:middle
By default, tests in Xcode are

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.536 A:middle
sorted by their name.

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:58.776 A:middle
This means that unless you

00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:00.486 A:middle
rename your tests, they will


00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:00.486 A:middle
rename your tests, they will

00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:01.786 A:middle
always run in the same order.

00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:04.126 A:middle
But determinism can be a

00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:04.946 A:middle
double-edged sword.

00:13:05.726 --> 00:13:06.816 A:middle
It can make it easy to miss

00:13:06.816 --> 00:13:08.836 A:middle
bugs, where one of your tests

00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:10.846 A:middle
implicitly depends on another

00:13:10.846 --> 00:13:12.526 A:middle
one running before it.

00:13:13.196 --> 00:13:14.716 A:middle
Let's look at an example of when

00:13:14.806 --> 00:13:15.606 A:middle
this can happen.

00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:18.516 A:middle
Imagine you have tests A, B, and

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:18.756 A:middle
C.

00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:20.996 A:middle
They always run in this order

00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:22.136 A:middle
and they always pass.

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.016 A:middle
But when you look at your tests

00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:26.096 A:middle
in detail, you realize that test

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:27.916 A:middle
A creates a database.

00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:31.766 A:middle
Then test B goes and writes some

00:13:31.766 --> 00:13:32.566 A:middle
data into it.

00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:35.806 A:middle
And then finally, test C goes

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:36.816 A:middle
and deletes it.

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.346 A:middle
Now these tests only pass

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:43.426 A:middle
because they run in this

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:44.366 A:middle
specific order.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.526 A:middle
But if you tried to shuffle them

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.356 A:middle
around, for example, by renaming

00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:50.656 A:middle
them, then you try to run them

00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:52.666 A:middle
again, you might have test B

00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:54.006 A:middle
writing into a database that

00:13:54.006 --> 00:13:55.616 A:middle
doesn't exist and your tests

00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:56.366 A:middle
would just fail.

00:13:57.766 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
So, to prevent issues like this,


00:13:57.766 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
So, to prevent issues like this,

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.436 A:middle
your tests should always

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.026 A:middle
correctly set up and tear down

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:04.696 A:middle
their own state.

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:07.546 A:middle
Not only will they be more

00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:09.376 A:middle
reliable, but it will also make

00:14:09.376 --> 00:14:10.876 A:middle
it possible for your tests to

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:12.246 A:middle
run independently of all the

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:14.396 A:middle
other ones and this can be

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.386 A:middle
really beneficial during

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:16.616 A:middle
development and debugging.

00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:19.846 A:middle
So, to help you ensure that

00:14:19.846 --> 00:14:21.146 A:middle
there are no unintentional

00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:22.736 A:middle
dependencies between your tests,

00:14:23.306 --> 00:14:25.056 A:middle
in Xcode 10, we're introducing

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:27.406 A:middle
the new test randomization mode.

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.136 A:middle
If you turn it on, your tests

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:31.886 A:middle
will be randomly shuffled before

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:32.846 A:middle
every time they're run.

00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:35.856 A:middle
And if your tests still pass

00:14:36.016 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
with this mode on, you can be

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:38.756 A:middle
more confident that they are

00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:39.726 A:middle
really robust and

00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:40.426 A:middle
self-contained.

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:44.166 A:middle
Randomization mode can be

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.896 A:middle
enabled in the scheme editor,

00:14:45.896 --> 00:14:46.986 A:middle
just like the other features

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.766 A:middle
we've seen today.

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:51.326 A:middle
So, these are the new test

00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:53.126 A:middle
selection and ordering features

00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:55.676 A:middle
in Xcode 10.

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:57.206 A:middle
Now I'm really excited about

00:14:57.206 --> 00:14:57.936 A:middle
what comes next.

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.686 A:middle
To tell you all about the new


00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.686 A:middle
To tell you all about the new

00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:01.926 A:middle
parallel testing features in

00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:03.516 A:middle
Xcode, I would like to welcome

00:15:03.516 --> 00:15:04.566 A:middle
Ethan Vaughan to the stage.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:04.976 A:middle
Ethan.

00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:11.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:13.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Honza.

00:15:14.926 --> 00:15:16.506 A:middle
So, many of you have a

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:18.346 A:middle
development cycle that looks

00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:19.066 A:middle
like this.

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.686 A:middle
You write some code, you debug

00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.916 A:middle
it, and then you run your tests

00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:25.326 A:middle
before you commit and push your

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:26.796 A:middle
changes to the repository.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
By running your tests before you

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.386 A:middle
push, you can catch regressions

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:32.836 A:middle
before they ever make it into a

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:32.976 A:middle
build.

00:15:35.256 --> 00:15:37.456 A:middle
However, one of the bottlenecks

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:39.476 A:middle
in this process can be just how

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:42.016 A:middle
long it takes to run your tests.

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:43.616 A:middle
Some of you have test suites

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.296 A:middle
that take on the order of 30

00:15:45.296 --> 00:15:47.016 A:middle
minutes to hours to run.

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:49.046 A:middle
And if you have to wait that

00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:50.826 A:middle
long before you can confidently

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.746 A:middle
land your work, that represents

00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:54.026 A:middle
a serious bottleneck in your

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:54.536 A:middle
workflow.

00:15:55.916 --> 00:15:57.036 A:middle
We want to make sure that your

00:15:57.036 --> 00:15:59.736 A:middle
tests run as fast as possible in

00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
order to shorten this critical


00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
order to shorten this critical

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:02.636 A:middle
part of the development cycle.

00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:04.946 A:middle
So, last year, we introduced a

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:08.156 A:middle
feature in Xcode 9 to help you

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:10.096 A:middle
run tests faster, it's called

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:11.536 A:middle
Parallel Destination Testing.

00:16:12.336 --> 00:16:13.906 A:middle
This is the ability to run all

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.376 A:middle
of your tests on multiple

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:17.166 A:middle
destinations at the same time.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.406 A:middle
And you do this from the command

00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:20.946 A:middle
line by passing multiple

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.676 A:middle
destinations specifiers to

00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:23.376 A:middle
xcodebuild.

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:27.066 A:middle
Previously, if you were to run

00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:28.726 A:middle
your tests, let's say on an

00:16:28.826 --> 00:16:31.926 A:middle
iPhone X and an iPad, xcodebuild

00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:33.466 A:middle
would run all of the tests on

00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:35.466 A:middle
the iPhone X and then all of the

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.646 A:middle
tests on the iPad.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.986 A:middle
Neither device would be running

00:16:38.986 --> 00:16:42.466 A:middle
tests at the same time.

00:16:42.466 --> 00:16:44.016 A:middle
But in Xcode 9, we changed this

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.896 A:middle
behavior so that by default,

00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:47.696 A:middle
tests run concurrently on the

00:16:47.696 --> 00:16:49.556 A:middle
devices and this can

00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:50.946 A:middle
dramatically shorten the overall

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:54.406 A:middle
execution time, which is great.

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:55.556 A:middle
However, there are some

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.076 A:middle
limitations to this approach.

00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:00.816 A:middle
First, it's only beneficial if


00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:00.816 A:middle
First, it's only beneficial if

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:01.816 A:middle
you test on multiple

00:17:01.816 --> 00:17:02.556 A:middle
destinations.

00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:04.675 A:middle
If you just want to run unit

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:06.205 A:middle
tests for your Mac app, for

00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:09.596 A:middle
example, this doesn't help.

00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:11.786 A:middle
Also, it's only available from

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:13.846 A:middle
xcodebuild, so it's primarily

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.156 A:middle
useful in the context of a

00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:16.175 A:middle
continuous integration

00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:17.965 A:middle
environment, like Xcode Server

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:18.836 A:middle
or Jenkins.

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:22.656 A:middle
I'm excited to tell you about a

00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:24.246 A:middle
new way to run tests faster than

00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:26.175 A:middle
ever called Parallel Distributed

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:26.576 A:middle
Testing.

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:29.736 A:middle
With Parallel Distributed

00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:31.426 A:middle
Testing, you can execute tests

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:32.816 A:middle
in parallel on a single

00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:33.476 A:middle
destination.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.166 A:middle
Previously, testing on a single

00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:38.446 A:middle
destination looks like this, a

00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:40.256 A:middle
continuous straight line with

00:17:40.256 --> 00:17:42.256 A:middle
one test executing after the

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:42.976 A:middle
other.

00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:45.656 A:middle
Parallel Distributed Testing

00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:46.676 A:middle
allows you to run tests

00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:48.616 A:middle
simultaneously so that testing

00:17:48.616 --> 00:17:49.306 A:middle
now looks like this.

00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:52.486 A:middle
In addition, it's supported both

00:17:52.486 --> 00:17:53.776 A:middle
from Xcode, as well as

00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:55.576 A:middle
xcodebuild, so no matter where

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.146 A:middle
you run your tests, you'll get

00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:58.176 A:middle
the best performance.

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:01.636 A:middle
Now in order to tell you about


00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:01.636 A:middle
Now in order to tell you about

00:18:01.636 --> 00:18:03.076 A:middle
how Xcode runs your tests in

00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:04.836 A:middle
parallel, we first have to talk

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.606 A:middle
about how your tests execute at

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:10.646 A:middle
all, what happens at runtime.

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
Let's start with unit tests.

00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:14.996 A:middle
Your unit tests get compiled

00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:16.366 A:middle
into a test bundle.

00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:20.066 A:middle
At runtime, Xcode launches an

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.636 A:middle
instance of your app which

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
serves as a test runner.

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:26.726 A:middle
The runner loads the test bundle

00:18:26.726 --> 00:18:29.786 A:middle
and executes all of its tests,

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:30.936 A:middle
so that's how unit tests

00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:31.466 A:middle
execute.

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:33.156 A:middle
What about UI tests?

00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:35.416 A:middle
For UI, tests the story is

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:35.916 A:middle
similar.

00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:37.866 A:middle
Your tests still get compiled

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.186 A:middle
into a bundle, but the bundle is

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.786 A:middle
loaded by a custom app that

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:42.736 A:middle
Xcode creates.

00:18:43.386 --> 00:18:45.126 A:middle
Your app no longer runs the

00:18:45.126 --> 00:18:45.456 A:middle
tests.

00:18:46.636 --> 00:18:48.846 A:middle
Instead, the tests automate your

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:51.296 A:middle
app by launching it and

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.736 A:middle
interacting with different parts

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.106 A:middle
of its UI.

00:18:55.186 --> 00:18:56.196 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.926 A:middle
about this process, I'd

00:18:57.926 --> 00:18:58.786 A:middle
encourage you to check out our

00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:01.106 A:middle
session from 2016, where we go


00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:01.106 A:middle
session from 2016, where we go

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:03.616 A:middle
into even more detail.

00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:05.656 A:middle
So, now that we understand how

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:07.396 A:middle
our tests execute, we can

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.046 A:middle
finally talk about how Xcode

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.026 A:middle
runs them in parallel.

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:13.336 A:middle
Just like before, Xcode will

00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:15.566 A:middle
launch a test runner to execute

00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:17.976 A:middle
our tests but instead of just

00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:20.236 A:middle
launching a single runner, Xcode

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:22.006 A:middle
will launch multiple runners,

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:24.396 A:middle
each of which executes a subset

00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:26.406 A:middle
of the tests.

00:19:26.406 --> 00:19:28.426 A:middle
In fact, Xcode will dynamically

00:19:28.426 --> 00:19:29.766 A:middle
distribute tests to the runners

00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:31.446 A:middle
in order to get the best

00:19:31.446 --> 00:19:32.706 A:middle
utilization of the course on

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:33.296 A:middle
your machine.

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:36.556 A:middle
Let's go into more detail.

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.876 A:middle
When Xcode distributes tests to

00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:41.856 A:middle
the runners, it does so by

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:42.146 A:middle
class.

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:45.046 A:middle
Each runner receives a test

00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:46.986 A:middle
class to execute and it'll

00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:48.756 A:middle
execute that test class before

00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:50.196 A:middle
going on to execute another one.

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.676 A:middle
And then testing finishes once

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
all the classes have executed.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:58.016 A:middle
Now you might be wondering why

00:19:58.016 --> 00:19:59.856 A:middle
Xcode distributes tests by class


00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:01.476 A:middle
instead of distributing

00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.016 A:middle
individual test methods to the

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:03.446 A:middle
runners.

00:20:04.626 --> 00:20:05.716 A:middle
There are a couple reasons for

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:06.216 A:middle
this.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.126 A:middle
First, there may be hidden

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:10.596 A:middle
dependencies between the tests

00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:12.356 A:middle
in a class, like Honza talked

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:12.956 A:middle
about earlier.

00:20:13.886 --> 00:20:15.446 A:middle
If Xcode were to take the tests

00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:17.476 A:middle
in a class and distribute them

00:20:17.476 --> 00:20:19.196 A:middle
to different runners, it could

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:20.536 A:middle
lead to hard to diagnose test

00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:21.166 A:middle
failures.

00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:25.296 A:middle
Second, each test class has a

00:20:25.916 --> 00:20:27.606 A:middle
class level set up and tear down

00:20:27.736 --> 00:20:29.416 A:middle
method, which may perform

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.516 A:middle
expensive computation.

00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:32.906 A:middle
By limiting the tests in a class

00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:35.616 A:middle
to a single runner, XE tests

00:20:35.646 --> 00:20:37.336 A:middle
only has to invoke these methods

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.166 A:middle
once, which can save precious

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:39.456 A:middle
time.

00:20:40.086 --> 00:20:43.806 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about some

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:45.756 A:middle
specifics to parallel testing on

00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:46.496 A:middle
the simulator.

00:20:48.076 --> 00:20:49.596 A:middle
When you run tests in parallel

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:51.856 A:middle
on the simulator, Xcode starts

00:20:51.856 --> 00:20:53.066 A:middle
by taking the simulator that

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:55.236 A:middle
you've selected and creating

00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:57.086 A:middle
multiple distinct copies or

00:20:57.086 --> 00:20:57.716 A:middle
clones of it.

00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
These clones are identical to


00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
These clones are identical to

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:02.256 A:middle
the original simulator at the

00:21:02.256 --> 00:21:03.406 A:middle
time that they're created.

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:06.286 A:middle
And Xcode will automatically

00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:07.906 A:middle
create and delete these clones,

00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:08.726 A:middle
as necessary.

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:11.376 A:middle
After cloning the simulator

00:21:11.376 --> 00:21:13.306 A:middle
several times, Xcode then

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:15.206 A:middle
launches a test runner on each

00:21:15.206 --> 00:21:16.956 A:middle
clone and that runner then

00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:18.986 A:middle
begins executing a test class,

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.476 A:middle
like we talked about earlier.

00:21:20.476 --> 00:21:23.676 A:middle
Now the fact that your tests

00:21:24.356 --> 00:21:25.666 A:middle
execute on different clones of

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.976 A:middle
the simulator has some

00:21:26.976 --> 00:21:28.266 A:middle
implications that you should be

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:29.546 A:middle
aware of.

00:21:30.516 --> 00:21:33.466 A:middle
First, the original simulator is

00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:34.936 A:middle
not used during testing.

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.416 A:middle
Instead, it serves as a sort of

00:21:37.416 --> 00:21:38.416 A:middle
template simulator.

00:21:39.176 --> 00:21:40.266 A:middle
You can configure it with the

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:41.576 A:middle
settings and the content that

00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:43.576 A:middle
you want and then that content

00:21:43.576 --> 00:21:44.956 A:middle
gets copied over to the clones

00:21:44.956 --> 00:21:45.726 A:middle
when they're created.

00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:49.266 A:middle
Next, there will be multiple

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.596 A:middle
copies of your app, one per

00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:54.216 A:middle
clone, and each copy has its own

00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:54.896 A:middle
data container.

00:21:56.056 --> 00:21:57.006 A:middle
This means that if you have a

00:21:57.006 --> 00:21:59.136 A:middle
test class that modifies files

00:21:59.136 --> 00:22:01.216 A:middle
on disk, you can't expect those


00:21:59.136 --> 00:22:01.216 A:middle
on disk, you can't expect those

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:02.886 A:middle
file modifications to be visible

00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
to another test class because it

00:22:04.996 --> 00:22:05.846 A:middle
could have access to a

00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
completely separate data

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:07.296 A:middle
container.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.836 A:middle
In practice, the fact that class

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:12.306 A:middle
is executed on different clones

00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:14.166 A:middle
will likely be invisible to your

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.296 A:middle
tests, but it's something to be

00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:17.406 A:middle
aware of.

00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:20.516 A:middle
So, where can you run tests in

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:20.966 A:middle
parallel?

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:22.866 A:middle
You can run unit tests in

00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:25.356 A:middle
parallel on macOS, as well as

00:22:25.356 --> 00:22:27.546 A:middle
unit and UI tests in parallel on

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:29.256 A:middle
the iOS and tvOS simulators.

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.996 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to give

00:22:31.996 --> 00:22:33.216 A:middle
you a demo of Parallel

00:22:33.216 --> 00:22:34.876 A:middle
Distributed Testing in action.

00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:49.636 A:middle
All right, so this is the Solar

00:22:49.636 --> 00:22:51.446 A:middle
System app, which you may have

00:22:51.446 --> 00:22:52.226 A:middle
seen at some of the other

00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:53.416 A:middle
sessions here at Dub-Dub.

00:22:54.346 --> 00:22:55.526 A:middle
As one of the developers of this

00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:57.296 A:middle
app, I want to run all of my

00:22:57.296 --> 00:22:58.876 A:middle
tests before committing and

00:22:58.876 --> 00:22:59.786 A:middle
pushing my changes to the

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
repository.


00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
repository.

00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:02.996 A:middle
However, as I add more and more

00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:04.686 A:middle
tests, this is starting to take

00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:05.946 A:middle
longer and longer, and it's

00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:06.956 A:middle
becoming a bottleneck in my

00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:07.516 A:middle
workflow.

00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:09.466 A:middle
So, let's see how parallel

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.156 A:middle
testing can help.

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.626 A:middle
I'll go ahead and switch over to

00:23:12.626 --> 00:23:15.166 A:middle
the Xcode project and I already

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.866 A:middle
ran my tests and I want to see

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:21.416 A:middle
how long they took to run.

00:23:21.596 --> 00:23:23.736 A:middle
All right, let's go back to the

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:24.356 A:middle
test report.

00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:26.526 A:middle
So, here, you can see next to

00:23:26.526 --> 00:23:28.496 A:middle
each method, we show exactly how

00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:29.626 A:middle
long that method took to

00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:30.146 A:middle
execute.

00:23:31.296 --> 00:23:33.376 A:middle
Next, for each test class, we

00:23:33.376 --> 00:23:35.126 A:middle
show the percentage of passing

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:37.236 A:middle
and failing tests, as well as

00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:38.786 A:middle
how long the test class took to

00:23:38.786 --> 00:23:39.266 A:middle
execute.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:41.836 A:middle
And finally, in the top right

00:23:41.836 --> 00:23:43.826 A:middle
corner, you can see exactly how

00:23:43.826 --> 00:23:45.196 A:middle
long all of your tests took to

00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:45.416 A:middle
run.

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.266 A:middle
So, here, we can see that our

00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:48.446 A:middle
tests took 14 seconds.

00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:50.676 A:middle
Now I'd like to enable

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:52.626 A:middle
parallelization, which I can do

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.606 A:middle
by going to the scheme.

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.826 A:middle
So, I'll select the scheme and

00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:56.846 A:middle
choose edit scheme.

00:23:57.876 --> 00:23:59.516 A:middle
Next, I'll click the test action


00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:01.916 A:middle
and I'll click the options

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:03.366 A:middle
button next to my test target.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:06.226 A:middle
Finally, I'll select the execute

00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:08.796 A:middle
in parallel checkbox and that's

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:10.046 A:middle
all I need to do to enable

00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:10.856 A:middle
parallel testing.

00:24:11.896 --> 00:24:13.176 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and run our

00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:15.016 A:middle
tests now by choosing product

00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:19.576 A:middle
tests.

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:20.816 A:middle
So, I want you to look at the

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:21.236 A:middle
doc.

00:24:21.946 --> 00:24:23.806 A:middle
Xcode launches multiple copies

00:24:23.806 --> 00:24:25.736 A:middle
of our Mac app to run our unit

00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:26.636 A:middle
tests in parallel.

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:28.666 A:middle
So, great, it looks like that

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:29.166 A:middle
finished.

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.086 A:middle
So, now, let's go back to the

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:33.346 A:middle
report and select the most

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.016 A:middle
recent report.

00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:37.666 A:middle
So, whereas previously, our test

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:39.746 A:middle
took 14 seconds to run, now they

00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:40.916 A:middle
only take 5 seconds.

00:24:41.316 --> 00:24:42.336 A:middle
So, just by enabling

00:24:42.336 --> 00:24:43.516 A:middle
parallelization, we've seen the

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.276 A:middle
greater than 50% improvement in

00:24:45.276 --> 00:24:46.376 A:middle
test execution time.

00:24:47.516 --> 00:24:53.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.566 A:middle
So, the Solar System app isn't

00:24:55.566 --> 00:24:57.806 A:middle
just available for the Mac, it

00:24:57.806 --> 00:24:59.276 A:middle
also has an iOS companion.

00:24:59.276 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
And one of my responsibilities


00:24:59.276 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
And one of my responsibilities

00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:03.656 A:middle
was to write a UI test suite to

00:25:03.656 --> 00:25:05.236 A:middle
exercise the various screens of

00:25:05.236 --> 00:25:06.406 A:middle
my iOS app.

00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:08.196 A:middle
Now I already enabled

00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:10.206 A:middle
parallelization for the iOS

00:25:10.206 --> 00:25:11.986 A:middle
scheme, so I'll go ahead and

00:25:11.986 --> 00:25:12.906 A:middle
just switch to that now.

00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:18.006 A:middle
And then I'll run tests by

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:20.006 A:middle
choosing product, test.

00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:24.346 A:middle
Now we'll go ahead and switch

00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:25.466 A:middle
over to the simulator.

00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:28.566 A:middle
So, here, you can see that Xcode

00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.226 A:middle
has created multiple clones of

00:25:30.226 --> 00:25:31.596 A:middle
the simulator that I selected,

00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.646 A:middle
and these clones are named after

00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:36.776 A:middle
the original simulator so that

00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:38.016 A:middle
they're easy to identify.

00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:41.666 A:middle
And on each simulator, Xcode has

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:44.396 A:middle
launched a test runner and each

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:45.946 A:middle
runner is executing a different

00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:46.926 A:middle
test class in my suite.


00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
Now while my tests are

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
executing, I'm going to switch

00:26:02.976 --> 00:26:05.066 A:middle
back to Xcode and show you the

00:26:05.066 --> 00:26:05.786 A:middle
test log.

00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:07.866 A:middle
You can find the test log

00:26:08.456 --> 00:26:10.116 A:middle
associated with the test report.

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:13.136 A:middle
The log is a great place to see

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:14.756 A:middle
how your classes are being

00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:15.966 A:middle
distributed to the different

00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:16.356 A:middle
runners.

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:19.886 A:middle
You can see an entry in the log

00:26:20.026 --> 00:26:22.726 A:middle
for each runner and beneath a

00:26:22.726 --> 00:26:24.226 A:middle
given runner, you can see the

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.596 A:middle
exact test class that it is

00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:26.526 A:middle
currently executing.

00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:28.916 A:middle
So, when the tests are

00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:30.626 A:middle
completely finished, this is a

00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:32.036 A:middle
great place to see how your

00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:33.676 A:middle
classes were distributed, which

00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:34.626 A:middle
gives you a picture of the

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:35.866 A:middle
overall parallelization.

00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:38.536 A:middle
And with that, let's switch back

00:26:38.536 --> 00:26:39.146 A:middle
to the slides.

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:47.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:49.956 A:middle
So, let's briefly recap what we

00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:50.726 A:middle
learned in the demo.

00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.806 A:middle
First, we saw how to enable

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.616 A:middle
parallelization in the scheme

00:26:55.616 --> 00:26:56.046 A:middle
editor.

00:26:57.466 --> 00:26:59.226 A:middle
Next, we saw how to view results

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
in the test report, as well as


00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
in the test report, as well as

00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:02.616 A:middle
how our classes are distributed

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:03.586 A:middle
in the test log.

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:07.486 A:middle
Then we saw Xcode launch

00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:09.126 A:middle
multiple instances of our Mac

00:27:09.126 --> 00:27:10.856 A:middle
app to run unit tests in

00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:11.486 A:middle
parallel.

00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:14.736 A:middle
And finally, we saw multiple

00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:16.666 A:middle
clones of the simulator running

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:20.286 A:middle
our UI tests in parallel.

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:21.846 A:middle
Like I mentioned earlier,

00:27:22.386 --> 00:27:24.136 A:middle
xcodebuild has great support for

00:27:24.136 --> 00:27:25.526 A:middle
parallel testing as well.

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:27.766 A:middle
We've added some new command

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:29.136 A:middle
line options that allow you to

00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:30.806 A:middle
control this behavior and I'd

00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:31.966 A:middle
like to point out two of those

00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:32.166 A:middle
now.

00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:35.206 A:middle
First, we have

00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:36.826 A:middle
parallel-testing-worker-count,

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:38.416 A:middle
which allows you to control the

00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:40.056 A:middle
exact number of workers or

00:27:40.056 --> 00:27:42.106 A:middle
runners that Xcode should launch

00:27:42.136 --> 00:27:42.946 A:middle
during parallel testing.

00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:46.326 A:middle
Normally, Xcode tries to

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:47.786 A:middle
determine an optimal number of

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:49.336 A:middle
runners based off of the

00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:51.036 A:middle
resources of your machine, as

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:51.866 A:middle
well as the workload.

00:27:52.956 --> 00:27:54.106 A:middle
This means that on a higher core

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.356 A:middle
machine, you will likely

00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:56.576 A:middle
experience more runners.

00:27:58.126 --> 00:27:59.436 A:middle
But if you find that the default

00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
number isn't working well for


00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
number isn't working well for

00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:02.526 A:middle
you, you can override it using

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:03.566 A:middle
this command line option.

00:28:04.146 --> 00:28:06.256 A:middle
Next, we have

00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:08.516 A:middle
parallel-testing-enabled, which

00:28:08.516 --> 00:28:09.486 A:middle
allows you to override the

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.996 A:middle
setting in the scheme to

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:12.736 A:middle
explicitly turn parallel testing

00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:16.636 A:middle
on or off.

00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:18.186 A:middle
Now for the most part, all you

00:28:18.186 --> 00:28:19.596 A:middle
need to do to get the benefits

00:28:19.596 --> 00:28:21.016 A:middle
of parallel testing is just to

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:21.676 A:middle
turn it on.

00:28:22.606 --> 00:28:24.176 A:middle
But here are few tips and tricks

00:28:24.476 --> 00:28:25.886 A:middle
to help you get the most out of

00:28:25.886 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
this feature.

00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:29.806 A:middle
First, consider splitting a

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:31.976 A:middle
long-running test class into two

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:32.586 A:middle
classes.

00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:36.276 A:middle
Because the test classes execute

00:28:36.276 --> 00:28:38.216 A:middle
in parallel, testing will never

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.666 A:middle
run faster than the longest

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:40.506 A:middle
running class.

00:28:41.946 --> 00:28:43.456 A:middle
When you run tests in parallel,

00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:44.956 A:middle
you may notice a situation like

00:28:45.006 --> 00:28:47.036 A:middle
this, where one test class

00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:49.076 A:middle
dominates the overall execution

00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:50.156 A:middle
time.

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.956 A:middle
If you take that class and

00:28:51.956 --> 00:28:54.526 A:middle
divide it up, Xcode can more

00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:55.946 A:middle
evenly distribute the work of

00:28:55.946 --> 00:28:57.516 A:middle
test execution between the

00:28:57.516 --> 00:28:59.116 A:middle
different runners, which can

00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:00.566 A:middle
shorten the overall execution


00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:00.566 A:middle
shorten the overall execution

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:00.876 A:middle
time.

00:29:02.306 --> 00:29:03.256 A:middle
Now don't feel like you need to

00:29:03.256 --> 00:29:04.936 A:middle
go and take all of your classes

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:06.116 A:middle
and divide them up.

00:29:06.456 --> 00:29:08.026 A:middle
That shouldn't be necessary but

00:29:08.026 --> 00:29:09.346 A:middle
if you notice a bottleneck like

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:13.716 A:middle
this, this is something to try.

00:29:13.946 --> 00:29:16.726 A:middle
Next, put performance tests into

00:29:16.726 --> 00:29:18.246 A:middle
their own bundle with

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:19.726 A:middle
parallelization disabled.

00:29:20.716 --> 00:29:22.226 A:middle
This may seem counterintuitive,

00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:24.046 A:middle
but performance tests are very

00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:27.096 A:middle
sensitive to system activity so

00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:28.336 A:middle
if you run them in parallel with

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:30.046 A:middle
each other, they'll likely fail

00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:31.026 A:middle
to meet their baselines.

00:29:31.716 --> 00:29:35.056 A:middle
And finally, understand which

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:36.576 A:middle
tests are not safe for

00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:37.376 A:middle
parallelization.

00:29:38.556 --> 00:29:40.046 A:middle
Most tests will be fine when you

00:29:40.046 --> 00:29:41.906 A:middle
run them in parallel, but if

00:29:41.906 --> 00:29:43.286 A:middle
your tests access a shared

00:29:43.286 --> 00:29:45.166 A:middle
system resource, like a file or

00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:46.976 A:middle
a database, you may need to

00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:48.086 A:middle
introduce explicit

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
synchronization to allow them to

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.526 A:middle
run concurrently.

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:53.556 A:middle
Speaking of testing tips and

00:29:53.556 --> 00:29:54.876 A:middle
tricks, if you'd like to learn

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:56.466 A:middle
more about how to test your

00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:58.366 A:middle
code, I'd encourage you to check

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.126 A:middle
out our session on Friday hosted


00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.126 A:middle
out our session on Friday hosted

00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:01.536 A:middle
by my colleague Stuart and Brian

00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:01.826 A:middle
[assumed spellings].

00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:05.226 A:middle
You won't want to miss it.

00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:07.486 A:middle
To wrap up, we started today's

00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:09.846 A:middle
talk with code coverage and the

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.306 A:middle
new improvements to performance

00:30:11.306 --> 00:30:11.996 A:middle
and accuracy.

00:30:13.346 --> 00:30:15.146 A:middle
Next, we talked about new test

00:30:15.316 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
selection and ordering features,

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:18.706 A:middle
which allow you to control

00:30:18.706 --> 00:30:21.096 A:middle
exactly which tests run, as well

00:30:21.136 --> 00:30:22.116 A:middle
as the order in which they're

00:30:22.116 --> 00:30:22.506 A:middle
run.

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:25.216 A:middle
And finally, we talked about

00:30:25.216 --> 00:30:26.566 A:middle
Parallel Distributed Testing,

00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:28.176 A:middle
which allows you to distribute

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:29.756 A:middle
test classes between different

00:30:29.756 --> 00:30:31.406 A:middle
runners to execute them in

00:30:31.406 --> 00:30:31.896 A:middle
parallel.

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:34.616 A:middle
For more information, I'd

00:30:34.616 --> 00:30:35.736 A:middle
encourage you to download our

00:30:35.736 --> 00:30:37.596 A:middle
slides from developer.apple.com

00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
and come see us in the labs

00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:40.026 A:middle
later this afternoon.

00:30:41.156 --> 00:30:42.746 A:middle
Have a great WWDC, everyone.
