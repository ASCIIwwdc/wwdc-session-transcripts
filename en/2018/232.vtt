[ Applause ]

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:26.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning and welcome to

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.446 A:middle
Getting Ready for Business Chat,

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:30.836 A:middle
I'm Dan and very shortly my

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:32.186 A:middle
esteemed colleague Scottie will

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:33.336 A:middle
be joining me on stage.

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:38.486 A:middle
Last year at WWDC2017 Grant and

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:39.966 A:middle
Scottie announced Business Chat

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.156 A:middle
Developer Preview as a great new

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:44.216 A:middle
feature of our Messages app, our

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:46.866 A:middle
most popular app for Apple users

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.756 A:middle
to securely and richly be able

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:51.256 A:middle
to message with brands, consumer

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.036 A:middle
brands, all around the world for

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:54.726 A:middle
customer service and commerce.

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.606 A:middle
We also launched our Apple

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.346 A:middle
Business Register at

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.346 A:middle
registered.apple.

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.346 A:middle
registered.apple.

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.186 A:middle
com/business-chat as the

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:05.556 A:middle
fundamental way for businesses

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:07.396 A:middle
and customer service platform

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:08.826 A:middle
providers, which I'm going to

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:12.126 A:middle
call CSPs from now on to easily

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:13.386 A:middle
submit their application of

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:14.936 A:middle
interest for access to a

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:17.806 A:middle
Business Chat account.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
Since then we've had a ton of

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.306 A:middle
interest with thousands of

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:23.766 A:middle
businesses and developers

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.376 A:middle
submitting applications for

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:25.956 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:28.036 A:middle
Thank you very much for the

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:30.166 A:middle
overwhelming fantastic response

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.066 A:middle
and thank you for your patience.

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:34.936 A:middle
After a few months of working

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.366 A:middle
closely with some major brands

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.826 A:middle
and their CSP providers we

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.676 A:middle
announced the public release of

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.446 A:middle
Business Chat Beta in March.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:47.236 A:middle
Now when we announced this we

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.906 A:middle
also announced that in order to

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.536 A:middle
use Business Chat users had to

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:52.826 A:middle
upgrade to these versions of

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:56.036 A:middle
iOS, macOS and watchOS or later

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:57.906 A:middle
in order to message with brands

00:01:57.906 --> 00:01:58.796 A:middle
using Business Chat.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:02.776 A:middle
And experienced some really rich

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:02.776 A:middle
And experienced some really rich

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:05.776 A:middle
message conversation with great

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:08.036 A:middle
showcase brands in the retail

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.886 A:middle
sector, in finance, in

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:13.426 A:middle
hospitality, and mobile services

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:16.206 A:middle
supported by their CSP providers

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:19.056 A:middle
like LivePerson, Salesforce,

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.106 A:middle
Nuance, and InTheChat.

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:24.246 A:middle
Hopefully you've had a chance to

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:26.426 A:middle
actually experiment and play

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:28.716 A:middle
with and, in fact, use some of

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:30.306 A:middle
these great experiences with

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:31.026 A:middle
these brands.

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:32.346 A:middle
But in case you haven't just as

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.276 A:middle
a quick reminder let me show you

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:36.086 A:middle
an example where I can easily

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:37.146 A:middle
start a conversation with

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.956 A:middle
T-Mobile by swiping on the home

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:42.056 A:middle
screen for iOS search, typing in

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:44.576 A:middle
T-Mobile and then looking at the

00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
search results, finding this

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:47.496 A:middle
specific business preview,

00:02:47.496 --> 00:02:48.856 A:middle
tapping on the message button,

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.266 A:middle
and immediately going into a

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:51.596 A:middle
conversation with T-Mobile.

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.646 A:middle
And in this example the T-Mobile

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.856 A:middle
automated response clarifies

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.136 A:middle
whether I'm a current customer

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:58.916 A:middle
or not with a list picker, so I

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
tap on that, I get a choice, I

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
tap on that, I get a choice, I

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:02.786 A:middle
select Heck yeah.

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.696 A:middle
And then now the automated

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
response wants to get me to

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.156 A:middle
actually log in so we can get

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:09.396 A:middle
into a lot of personal details

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:10.196 A:middle
about my account.

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.436 A:middle
I tap on the rich bubble, it

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.876 A:middle
opens an iMessage app for

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.196 A:middle
authentication, I enter my

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.936 A:middle
credentials and I'm in.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.486 A:middle
All easily done within the

00:03:18.486 --> 00:03:19.576 A:middle
message conversation.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:21.586 A:middle
And so now I can continue to

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:22.596 A:middle
have a very detailed

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:24.176 A:middle
conversation about my account

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:26.006 A:middle
and by the way, if I get really

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.846 A:middle
busy and I have to leave to go

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.356 A:middle
do something else when I get

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:30.706 A:middle
back home or back to the office

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:32.226 A:middle
I can pick right back up where I

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:35.116 A:middle
left off on my Mac with the

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:35.806 A:middle
Messages app.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.586 A:middle
Or if I'm busy and I'm on the go

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:40.136 A:middle
I can receive and send Business

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.866 A:middle
Chat messages from my Apple

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:42.356 A:middle
watch.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.086 A:middle
Okay so that brings us to today

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.556 A:middle
and I'm really excited to

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:48.956 A:middle
announce that we're going to

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:50.486 A:middle
open the doors significantly

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.426 A:middle
wider to many more consumer

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.496 A:middle
brands around the world and more

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:55.786 A:middle
customer service platform

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:56.496 A:middle
providers.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:02.276 A:middle
Very excited yes, thank you.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:02.276 A:middle
Very excited yes, thank you.

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:03.916 A:middle
So let's look at some key steps

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:05.186 A:middle
that I think are important that

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:06.766 A:middle
we've learned that we want to

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.426 A:middle
relay back to you about how to

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:10.536 A:middle
get ready whether you're a CSP,

00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:11.986 A:middle
whether you're a consumer brand

00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:12.916 A:middle
or whether you're a brand

00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:13.466 A:middle
developer.

00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:16.856 A:middle
Starting with CSP providers.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:20.206 A:middle
There are two qualifying

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:22.446 A:middle
criteria that we look at closely

00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:23.696 A:middle
when thinking about the

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.066 A:middle
potential for a new CSP provider

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.266 A:middle
for Business Chat and I'm going

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:29.396 A:middle
to talk about those in a sec.

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.426 A:middle
We also then once approved spend

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:34.936 A:middle
and invest time with CSP

00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:36.796 A:middle
providers to help them get ready

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:38.806 A:middle
to provide a great business chat

00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:40.756 A:middle
user experience and to get off

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:42.406 A:middle
to a very fast start and we'll

00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:43.436 A:middle
talk about those quickly.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:46.306 A:middle
Starting with servicing medium

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:47.746 A:middle
to large consumer brands.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
For now, we're going to be very

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.946 A:middle
focused on medium to large

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:51.936 A:middle
consumer brands.

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.196 A:middle
So as a qualified CSP you have

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.136 A:middle
this base of customers and

00:04:57.136 --> 00:04:58.346 A:middle
you're providing them with a

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
platform solution that provides

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
platform solution that provides

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:02.036 A:middle
contact management for these

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:03.406 A:middle
brands, especially for

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:03.936 A:middle
messaging.

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:08.616 A:middle
And as a qualified CSP you have

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:10.516 A:middle
these consumer brand customers

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:12.086 A:middle
around the world in various

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:13.276 A:middle
regions, whether it's North or

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.946 A:middle
South America, whether it's

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:16.466 A:middle
Europe, whether it's Japan,

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.336 A:middle
Southeast Asia, Australia, New

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.426 A:middle
Zealand or globally, but you do

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:21.946 A:middle
have a base of these consumer

00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
brands, medium to large consumer

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.686 A:middle
brands around the world in one

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:26.566 A:middle
or more regions.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.696 A:middle
And as a qualified CSP you

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:31.426 A:middle
provide a fully featured

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:33.056 A:middle
platform, so what do we mean by

00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:33.366 A:middle
that?

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:35.356 A:middle
Well let's look at some major

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.116 A:middle
features that we look for in

00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:38.156 A:middle
perspective CSPs that are going

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:40.866 A:middle
to provide a great experience

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:41.946 A:middle
for their customers with

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:42.566 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:45.046 A:middle
So starting with let's look at

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:46.896 A:middle
this first example of an agent

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:49.266 A:middle
console from LivePerson.

00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:52.056 A:middle
The LivePerson live engage

00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:54.546 A:middle
console has the opportunity

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:55.836 A:middle
because of its built-in

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:57.146 A:middle
capabilities for what we call

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:58.226 A:middle
dynamic widgets.

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.966 A:middle
And so a dynamic widget provides

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.966 A:middle
And so a dynamic widget provides

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.906 A:middle
the agent the capability to

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:04.846 A:middle
populate with the right content

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
both image and text based on how

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:09.286 A:middle
Business Chat operates based on

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.416 A:middle
our API and built-in

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.466 A:middle
functionality so that the agent

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
can simply tap on that to send

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:17.026 A:middle
the payload down to me on my

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:18.356 A:middle
iPhone when I'm communicating

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.046 A:middle
with the Lowe's agent so that I

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.616 A:middle
can make a simple selection

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.096 A:middle
because I'm looking for smart

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:25.206 A:middle
locks that support HomeKit.

00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:28.186 A:middle
Very easy to do, but the console

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:29.766 A:middle
functionality is very important

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:30.836 A:middle
to have this built in.

00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
So then I'm ready to make a

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:36.346 A:middle
purchase and I see oh, not my

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.526 A:middle
HomeKit smart locks I see red

00:06:38.526 --> 00:06:39.796 A:middle
heeled shoes, thanks Scottie.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.386 A:middle
So now I guess I'm going to be

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.966 A:middle
buying red heeled shoes.

00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:44.816 A:middle
So but in this case the same

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:46.446 A:middle
thing an intelligent dynamic

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
widget that populates for the

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:50.386 A:middle
agent the Apple Pay payload that

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
they can easily tap on again to

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:54.666 A:middle
send the payload to me so that

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
all I have to do now is tap to

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
authenticate using Touch ID or

00:06:58.666 --> 00:06:59.386 A:middle
Face ID.

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
A very efficient, very powerful

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
A very efficient, very powerful

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:02.636 A:middle
way to implement Business Chat.

00:07:03.096 --> 00:07:04.886 A:middle
So let's talk about backend

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.186 A:middle
systems, so backend systems

00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:08.726 A:middle
integration is also very

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:09.206 A:middle
important.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
Your platform must have APIs

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.486 A:middle
that support your customers'

00:07:13.486 --> 00:07:15.886 A:middle
backend systems such as CRM,

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:17.846 A:middle
scheduling, product inventory,

00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:20.856 A:middle
inventory ordering, order entry,

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:22.046 A:middle
payment systems.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.416 A:middle
And in this example, it's a

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:25.016 A:middle
Salesforce lightning service

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
console where because of a

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:28.236 A:middle
previous conversation they had

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:30.666 A:middle
my stable identifier, but

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.096 A:middle
they've now -- I've identified

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:33.436 A:middle
myself and they've now connected

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:34.496 A:middle
me to a profile.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.276 A:middle
So now when I come back, the

00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:38.956 A:middle
agent CRM profile comes up and

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
they know about me so I can

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
start a very natural

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:42.676 A:middle
conversation right off the bat.

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:45.016 A:middle
And the agent has the ability to

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:47.066 A:middle
pull from their engagement case

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:48.966 A:middle
history all the previous

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:50.796 A:middle
engagements I've had to again be

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.276 A:middle
able to pull back some history

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.226 A:middle
and go into a very fluid, easy

00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:56.006 A:middle
conversation with me-- super

00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:57.246 A:middle
important to have this backend

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:58.746 A:middle
systems integration capability.

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
The next key point, intelligent

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
The next key point, intelligent

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:01.456 A:middle
message routing.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.616 A:middle
So as you probably may recall

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:04.806 A:middle
from last year, we announced

00:08:04.806 --> 00:08:06.886 A:middle
intent and group IDs as part of

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.556 A:middle
the infrastructure support for

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:09.816 A:middle
message payloads that are being

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:11.486 A:middle
sent from me through the

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:13.276 A:middle
business chat API to the

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:14.306 A:middle
customer service platform

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:14.746 A:middle
provider.

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
In this case, I may be searching

00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:18.316 A:middle
in the Maps app for a specific

00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:20.346 A:middle
location for Home Depot in Santa

00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:21.706 A:middle
Clara and I start the

00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:23.576 A:middle
conversation here by tapping on

00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:25.566 A:middle
the Message button.

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:28.646 A:middle
And it sends and appends in the

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.376 A:middle
intent and group ID the actual

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.285 A:middle
address that I've started at.

00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:33.765 A:middle
And so this is important because

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:35.006 A:middle
the intelligent routing of your

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:37.666 A:middle
platform may need to be able to

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:38.966 A:middle
based on your business rules

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.506 A:middle
route this to the right agent

00:08:40.506 --> 00:08:42.056 A:middle
group perhaps on the West Coast

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.405 A:middle
because of hours of operation.

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.356 A:middle
But it also supports the agent's

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:46.896 A:middle
ability to then know where I

00:08:46.896 --> 00:08:48.626 A:middle
started my journey and be able

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:49.826 A:middle
to help me right away knowing

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.036 A:middle
I'm probably interested about

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.516 A:middle
that specific store location.

00:08:53.356 --> 00:08:55.336 A:middle
Okay lastly, quality of service

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:58.116 A:middle
monitoring, QOS, very important

00:08:58.116 --> 00:08:59.326 A:middle
and so in this example with the

00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
Nuance dashboard.

00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
Nuance dashboard.

00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:02.636 A:middle
Your platform needs to be able

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:04.576 A:middle
to monitor, analyze and provide

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.456 A:middle
statistics, KPIs, important KPIs

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:08.786 A:middle
for your business customers.

00:09:09.036 --> 00:09:10.856 A:middle
And so being able to monitor

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:12.476 A:middle
Business Chat conversations by

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:14.386 A:middle
agent and provide important

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:16.516 A:middle
statistics and KPIs, like the

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:17.916 A:middle
average response time for

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.816 A:middle
Business Chat for agents, as

00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:21.446 A:middle
well as perhaps for commerce

00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:22.996 A:middle
type transactions in Business

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.696 A:middle
Chat, the percentage conversion

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.416 A:middle
rates, all about trying to

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.726 A:middle
figure out how to increase their

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:29.496 A:middle
productivity and increase my

00:09:29.496 --> 00:09:31.006 A:middle
level of customer satisfaction.

00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:32.096 A:middle
So your platform needs to

00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:34.226 A:middle
support this type of analytics.

00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:37.356 A:middle
So once again four key areas

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:38.906 A:middle
that we look for when we think

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.686 A:middle
about what qualifies as a great

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:41.756 A:middle
customer service platform

00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:43.646 A:middle
provider for Business Chat.

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:45.336 A:middle
Okay now that you've been

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.916 A:middle
approved there's a couple of key

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:47.896 A:middle
things that we're going to ask

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:49.746 A:middle
you to do, one is to invest time

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:50.836 A:middle
in training your sales and

00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:51.866 A:middle
systems engineers.

00:09:52.316 --> 00:09:53.916 A:middle
So we've created three modules

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:55.936 A:middle
that we walk you through, all of

00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:57.206 A:middle
your sales and system engineers

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:58.136 A:middle
wherever they are around the

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.196 A:middle
world about general business

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.196 A:middle
world about general business

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.816 A:middle
with working with Apple, about

00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:03.146 A:middle
implementation and lots of

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:04.396 A:middle
details that we go into here

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:04.976 A:middle
technically.

00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:06.686 A:middle
And then lastly, about how to

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:08.646 A:middle
design great user experiences

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:10.366 A:middle
and how to properly set yourself

00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:11.996 A:middle
up for a great marketing launch.

00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:15.186 A:middle
And then lastly, you need to get

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:17.116 A:middle
ready and help your customers

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.216 A:middle
get ready when it comes to

00:10:18.276 --> 00:10:20.706 A:middle
integrating great consumer brand

00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:22.576 A:middle
customers and all of their

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:23.396 A:middle
interactions.

00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:24.736 A:middle
And so there's a couple of key

00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:26.046 A:middle
things that we want to highlight

00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:27.156 A:middle
here that we've learned.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:29.176 A:middle
Number one, believe it or not

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:31.076 A:middle
once you become an approved CSP

00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:32.526 A:middle
platform you need to make sure

00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:33.876 A:middle
you let all your customers know

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:34.986 A:middle
that you are and more

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:36.006 A:middle
importantly, you need to get

00:10:36.006 --> 00:10:37.626 A:middle
them to come and register at

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:39.696 A:middle
registered.apple.com and make

00:10:39.696 --> 00:10:40.896 A:middle
sure that they're selecting you

00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:42.506 A:middle
in the drop-down menu and

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:43.786 A:middle
notifying you when they have

00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:45.076 A:middle
done that so that the two of you

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:46.076 A:middle
can actually start working

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:47.656 A:middle
together right from the start.

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:50.486 A:middle
Second of all, in parallel you

00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:51.676 A:middle
should be already starting to

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:53.286 A:middle
integrate to the Business Chat

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.986 A:middle
API, starting an Apple Business

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:56.316 A:middle
Register and then continuing to

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.396 A:middle
test all of the payloads across

00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.076 A:middle
the networks to get ready for

00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.076 A:middle
the networks to get ready for

00:11:00.796 --> 00:11:02.786 A:middle
helping your customers get ready

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:03.316 A:middle
to launch.

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:06.166 A:middle
And then lastly, you need to

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:07.936 A:middle
start to develop and implement

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:09.636 A:middle
some great use cases for your

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.586 A:middle
customers and help them get to

00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:12.706 A:middle
the point where they're really

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
ready to actually launch

00:11:14.386 --> 00:11:16.516 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:18.076 A:middle
Okay and then sorry one more

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.126 A:middle
point, you do need to notify us

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
when you and your customer or

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.166 A:middle
customers are ready for a launch

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:25.526 A:middle
so that we can do a public

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:28.016 A:middle
launch review, a final QA before

00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:29.456 A:middle
we turn you on and publicly

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:29.926 A:middle
launch.

00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:33.106 A:middle
So again, these are a couple of

00:11:33.106 --> 00:11:34.506 A:middle
key qualifiers and some

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
important steps of investment

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.566 A:middle
that you need to make as a

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:39.716 A:middle
potential CSP around the world

00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:40.386 A:middle
for Business Chat.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:42.706 A:middle
So let's talk about the consumer

00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:44.566 A:middle
brand, some points about how to

00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:46.056 A:middle
get ready, steps to get ready

00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:47.786 A:middle
for launching Business Chat as a

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:48.546 A:middle
consumer brand.

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:51.146 A:middle
Number one, the one thing we

00:11:51.146 --> 00:11:53.616 A:middle
learned is that Business Chat is

00:11:53.616 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle
an asynchronous, more

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.356 A:middle
asynchronous like communication

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:57.556 A:middle
method is a little different

00:11:57.556 --> 00:11:59.196 A:middle
from synchronous and so just to

00:11:59.196 --> 00:11:59.916 A:middle
make sure that everyone

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
understands what that means I'll

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
understands what that means I'll

00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:03.246 A:middle
illustrate with a quick example

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.866 A:middle
between Hilton and Marriott, a

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.036 A:middle
couple of our partners.

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.866 A:middle
I may start a conversation with

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:11.516 A:middle
the hotel brand looking for a

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:12.956 A:middle
common use case like loyalty

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:13.446 A:middle
points.

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:15.646 A:middle
And I may start that and have a

00:12:15.646 --> 00:12:17.006 A:middle
very synchronous communication

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.426 A:middle
back and forth on a Wednesday,

00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:20.086 A:middle
but then I get distracted, I'm

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:21.616 A:middle
doing other things so a couple

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.226 A:middle
days go by before I come back.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:25.716 A:middle
This becomes more asynchronous

00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:27.396 A:middle
now in nature, but because of

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.716 A:middle
the long-lived sessions of

00:12:28.716 --> 00:12:30.346 A:middle
Business Chat and because of the

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.406 A:middle
stable identifier about me and

00:12:32.406 --> 00:12:33.826 A:middle
because I previously identified

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:36.046 A:middle
who I am a new agent that picks

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
back up in this conversation

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.116 A:middle
should pick back up right where

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:40.396 A:middle
we left off, it's not about

00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:41.186 A:middle
starting over.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.796 A:middle
So it's a different etiquette

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.146 A:middle
and so we've come up with some

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:46.256 A:middle
great guidelines and some help

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:48.576 A:middle
in documents to help get your

00:12:48.576 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
agents properly trained to be

00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:51.526 A:middle
able to manage these types of

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:53.136 A:middle
conversations differently say

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.766 A:middle
from what they may be used to in

00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:56.446 A:middle
live webchat synchronously.

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:59.056 A:middle
You also need to adjust your

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
KPIs for measuring synchronous

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
KPIs for measuring synchronous

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
versus asynchronous

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:02.676 A:middle
communications.

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:03.936 A:middle
Okay let's talk about

00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:05.746 A:middle
integrating Business Chat entry

00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:06.266 A:middle
points.

00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
So as you probably remember with

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:11.046 A:middle
Business Chat only users can

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:12.656 A:middle
initiate a conversation and

00:13:12.656 --> 00:13:14.036 A:middle
therefore it's even more

00:13:14.036 --> 00:13:15.986 A:middle
important to make sure it's very

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.756 A:middle
easy to discover ways in which

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:18.906 A:middle
to start a Business Chat

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
conversation.

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.276 A:middle
So there's two key groups that

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:22.256 A:middle
I'm going to talk about, there's

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:24.396 A:middle
Apple native entry points and

00:13:24.396 --> 00:13:26.196 A:middle
then there are your entry points

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
as a consumer brand.

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:29.976 A:middle
Starting with Apple's native

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:30.696 A:middle
entry points.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.466 A:middle
So when we announced the public

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.196 A:middle
release of Business Chat Beta in

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:36.816 A:middle
March we also announced the

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.746 A:middle
native release of being able to

00:13:38.746 --> 00:13:41.416 A:middle
search for brands in Siri, in

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:44.276 A:middle
Search, in Safari and in Maps.

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:46.896 A:middle
And we made this very simple so

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.106 A:middle
that you can go into Business

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:49.826 A:middle
Chat, your Business Chat account

00:13:49.826 --> 00:13:51.606 A:middle
in Apple Business Register and

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:54.376 A:middle
set up and configure these entry

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.976 A:middle
points for your business.

00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:57.566 A:middle
And in case you haven't

00:13:57.566 --> 00:13:59.196 A:middle
experienced this again here's a

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
quick example where I would

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
quick example where I would

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:03.726 A:middle
start a search again on iOS on

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:04.886 A:middle
the home screen with a simple

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.666 A:middle
swipe down, I would type in

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.366 A:middle
Discover the brand, I get the

00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:09.546 A:middle
search result, the business

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:11.326 A:middle
search result for Discover, I

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:12.846 A:middle
tap on the Business Chat button

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:14.696 A:middle
and boom I'm right into my

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:15.446 A:middle
conversation.

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:17.826 A:middle
Very easy, three steps.

00:14:18.196 --> 00:14:20.186 A:middle
Or coming back to the same

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.226 A:middle
search result I may tap on the

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:24.066 A:middle
left side of the search result

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.306 A:middle
and that opens up what we call

00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:28.416 A:middle
the full preview of the business

00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:29.986 A:middle
card, which has a lot of

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:31.626 A:middle
important information that again

00:14:31.626 --> 00:14:33.476 A:middle
as a consumer brand you set up

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.136 A:middle
in your Business Chat account in

00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:36.936 A:middle
Apple Business Register, such as

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:38.736 A:middle
what to expect from your agents

00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:40.976 A:middle
or your automation with response

00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:42.816 A:middle
time to messages or your live

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.476 A:middle
agents' hours of operations

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.766 A:middle
dependent on where they are.

00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:47.296 A:middle
So these are all things that you

00:14:47.296 --> 00:14:48.826 A:middle
can set up in your account and

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:50.726 A:middle
configure and update as required

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:51.956 A:middle
in your Business Chat account.

00:14:52.866 --> 00:14:54.606 A:middle
So again, really important to be

00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:56.006 A:middle
taking advantage and setting up

00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:57.776 A:middle
all of these and getting ready

00:14:57.776 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
to launch in your Business Chat

00:14:57.776 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
to launch in your Business Chat

00:15:00.346 --> 00:15:01.276 A:middle
account in Apple Business

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:01.806 A:middle
Register.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.146 A:middle
But these are not as important

00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:06.556 A:middle
as your entry points and so by

00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:08.316 A:middle
your entry points we mean these

00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:09.586 A:middle
are the places in which your

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:11.676 A:middle
customers are most commonly

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.006 A:middle
engaging with you, it's your

00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:15.106 A:middle
content, it's your various

00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:16.416 A:middle
properties, whether it's

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.616 A:middle
websites or apps.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:19.286 A:middle
This is where your touch points

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.556 A:middle
are most valuable.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.086 A:middle
And so we've created the

00:15:22.086 --> 00:15:23.816 A:middle
Business Chat button which is an

00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:26.546 A:middle
API driven way to embed and

00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:27.896 A:middle
initiate an entry point for

00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:29.466 A:middle
Business Chat and it has a

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:31.396 A:middle
unique URL embedded in it for

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:32.416 A:middle
your business ID.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:34.536 A:middle
So let's look at some examples.

00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.886 A:middle
This is an example of how TD

00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:38.726 A:middle
Ameritrade has implemented the

00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.156 A:middle
Business Chat button in their

00:15:40.156 --> 00:15:41.106 A:middle
mobile website.

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.806 A:middle
And so contextually they look

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.336 A:middle
for opportunities where there's

00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:47.036 A:middle
the highest level of engagement,

00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:48.746 A:middle
where their customers typically

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:51.116 A:middle
or prospects start to figure out

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.376 A:middle
okay I want to do something but

00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:53.656 A:middle
I'm not sure exactly what to do.

00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:54.866 A:middle
And so they place the Business

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:56.086 A:middle
Chat button there and it's

00:15:56.086 --> 00:15:57.446 A:middle
getting tremendous results

00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.906 A:middle
because then I can simply tap on

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:00.336 A:middle
it in this contextual call to

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:00.336 A:middle
it in this contextual call to

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:01.896 A:middle
action to talk to a TD

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:03.186 A:middle
Ameritrade advisor and

00:16:03.186 --> 00:16:04.796 A:middle
immediately start a conversation

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:05.226 A:middle
with them.

00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:06.606 A:middle
It's fantastic.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.316 A:middle
All right, so now let's look at

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:09.616 A:middle
an example of an in-app

00:16:09.646 --> 00:16:11.086 A:middle
placement of a Business Chat

00:16:11.086 --> 00:16:11.406 A:middle
button.

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:13.996 A:middle
1-800-Flowers in their app have

00:16:13.996 --> 00:16:15.506 A:middle
the Business Chat button placed

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:16.816 A:middle
in a number of really important

00:16:16.816 --> 00:16:19.426 A:middle
areas again, but I may have

00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:20.676 A:middle
started a conversation with

00:16:20.676 --> 00:16:22.766 A:middle
1-800-Flowers a while ago and

00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:24.566 A:middle
because of my tray and because I

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:25.636 A:middle
communicate with so many

00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:26.776 A:middle
different people that

00:16:26.776 --> 00:16:27.816 A:middle
conversation may have been

00:16:27.816 --> 00:16:29.056 A:middle
pushed way down in my message

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:29.286 A:middle
tray.

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:30.956 A:middle
So in fact you know I'm getting

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:32.346 A:middle
old, I may have forgotten that I

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:33.756 A:middle
actually had this conversation.

00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:36.106 A:middle
So I may have started a

00:16:36.106 --> 00:16:37.076 A:middle
conversation, looking for an

00:16:37.076 --> 00:16:39.446 A:middle
opportunity to buy flowers in

00:16:39.686 --> 00:16:42.736 A:middle
the 1-800-Flowers app and I spot

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:43.606 A:middle
the Business Chat button and

00:16:43.646 --> 00:16:44.836 A:middle
then it comes back to me.

00:16:45.146 --> 00:16:46.266 A:middle
Oh my goodness all I have to do

00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:48.246 A:middle
is tap on that button and once

00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:50.306 A:middle
again it will bring back all the

00:16:50.306 --> 00:16:51.816 A:middle
previous conversation because of

00:16:51.816 --> 00:16:54.166 A:middle
its long-lived capabilities and

00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:55.536 A:middle
I'm already identified, the

00:16:55.536 --> 00:16:58.036 A:middle
agent welcomes me back and I can

00:16:58.036 --> 00:16:59.506 A:middle
right away get into a productive

00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
conversation to order a new set

00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
conversation to order a new set

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:02.916 A:middle
of flowers for my wife which are

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:04.016 A:middle
probably way overdue at this

00:17:04.016 --> 00:17:04.236 A:middle
point.

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:06.386 A:middle
All right, so let's talk about

00:17:06.386 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
phone calls.

00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:09.326 A:middle
There's a huge opportunity that

00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:10.576 A:middle
we're discovering with many

00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:12.526 A:middle
brands to be able to start to

00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:15.076 A:middle
deflect inbound phone calls to

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.136 A:middle
your 1-800 contact centers.

00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:19.806 A:middle
Massive potential here for cost

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:21.386 A:middle
savings and higher levels of

00:17:21.386 --> 00:17:22.056 A:middle
productivity.

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.376 A:middle
And so the idea is at the top of

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.665 A:middle
your IV or your call tree with

00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:28.136 A:middle
whatever options you're offering

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:29.496 A:middle
in terms of getting into a queue

00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:31.026 A:middle
for a live agent you offer an

00:17:31.026 --> 00:17:33.646 A:middle
option to be able to have an SMS

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:35.706 A:middle
text message sent to you if you

00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:37.226 A:middle
want to start a conversation in

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:38.256 A:middle
Apple's Messages app.

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.606 A:middle
And that SMS text message would

00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:42.016 A:middle
have an embedded link that all

00:17:42.016 --> 00:17:43.626 A:middle
they have to do again is tap on

00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:45.386 A:middle
it and it opens up the Business

00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:47.066 A:middle
Chat conversation right in their

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:47.666 A:middle
Messages app.

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:49.336 A:middle
Again, huge potential

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:51.446 A:middle
opportunity to be deflecting a

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.356 A:middle
significant amount of inbound

00:17:53.356 --> 00:17:55.766 A:middle
costly phone calls to a high

00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:57.696 A:middle
productive channel like Business

00:17:59.406 --> 00:17:59.506 A:middle
Chat.

00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.046 A:middle
Okay brand email.

00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.046 A:middle
Okay brand email.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:04.016 A:middle
So again very targeted because

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.106 A:middle
you obviously have to target

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:06.826 A:middle
this to specific Apple device

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:08.546 A:middle
users that most brands track and

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.336 A:middle
know who they are.

00:18:09.686 --> 00:18:10.736 A:middle
But a great opportunity where

00:18:10.736 --> 00:18:12.376 A:middle
1-800-Flowers is knocking it out

00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:14.306 A:middle
of the park being able to target

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:16.216 A:middle
these emails, offer promotions,

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:17.956 A:middle
remind them of an easy checkout

00:18:17.956 --> 00:18:20.066 A:middle
benefit with Apple Pay and again

00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:21.996 A:middle
select that button, tap on it

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:23.236 A:middle
and away you go, you're into a

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:24.006 A:middle
conversation.

00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:26.186 A:middle
Last key example I'm going to

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.936 A:middle
touch on is QR codes.

00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.506 A:middle
And so there's lots of

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:30.266 A:middle
opportunities that we're

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.716 A:middle
starting to see pop up where

00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:34.036 A:middle
brands are using QR codes in

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:35.576 A:middle
storefront windows to capture

00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:37.116 A:middle
attention, they're using them at

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.716 A:middle
the checkout lanes, and they're

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.356 A:middle
also using them at check-in at

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:40.986 A:middle
hotels.

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:42.416 A:middle
But this is a great example

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:44.126 A:middle
where T-Mobile is in fact

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:45.356 A:middle
exploring the opportunity to

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:47.736 A:middle
create a post-sale relationship

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:49.616 A:middle
by offering at the end of a

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
conversation in-store on the ID

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.526 A:middle
badge of their in-store advisors

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:56.176 A:middle
the opportunity to start a

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.736 A:middle
conversation right there by

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.756 A:middle
simply holding up your iPhone

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.306 A:middle
with the built-in capabilities

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.306 A:middle
with the built-in capabilities

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.846 A:middle
of the camera to read the QR

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:04.516 A:middle
code and start a conversation

00:19:04.516 --> 00:19:05.926 A:middle
even before you leave the store.

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.496 A:middle
Great way to again personalize

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:09.626 A:middle
that journey with your

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:10.276 A:middle
customers.

00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:13.426 A:middle
All right, so super important

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:14.516 A:middle
that is part of getting ready

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:15.896 A:middle
for a launch that you've thought

00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:16.766 A:middle
through and found the most

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:18.436 A:middle
valuable engagement touch points

00:19:18.436 --> 00:19:19.726 A:middle
with your customers and embedded

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.866 A:middle
the Business Chat button as you

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:22.276 A:middle
launch.

00:19:22.976 --> 00:19:24.886 A:middle
So next key step, two more

00:19:24.886 --> 00:19:25.306 A:middle
things.

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:27.286 A:middle
One, preparing your logos

00:19:27.286 --> 00:19:28.706 A:middle
because they are well displayed

00:19:28.706 --> 00:19:29.656 A:middle
throughout the Business Chat

00:19:29.656 --> 00:19:31.706 A:middle
experience and so you have your

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:33.286 A:middle
square logo and you have your

00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:33.966 A:middle
wide logo.

00:19:34.566 --> 00:19:36.046 A:middle
And so as a reminder in case you

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:37.476 A:middle
haven't seen this, the square

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.796 A:middle
logo shows up in a search

00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:40.696 A:middle
result, the square logo shows up

00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:42.316 A:middle
on your actual full business

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.366 A:middle
card, it shows up in the message

00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:46.046 A:middle
tray so it easily, you know you

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.366 A:middle
can scan easily and look for the

00:19:47.366 --> 00:19:47.986 A:middle
brand that you were

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:48.716 A:middle
communicating with.

00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.436 A:middle
And then lastly, the wide logo

00:19:50.436 --> 00:19:52.476 A:middle
always the optimal choice to be

00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:53.786 A:middle
showing it at the top of every

00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:54.936 A:middle
business conversation to

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:56.206 A:middle
reinforce your brand.

00:19:57.506 --> 00:19:59.256 A:middle
And it's easy to set up in your

00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.806 A:middle
Business Chat account once again

00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.806 A:middle
Business Chat account once again

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:02.446 A:middle
by simply going into your

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:03.886 A:middle
account, tapping on the Brand

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:05.936 A:middle
button, uploading your square

00:20:06.016 --> 00:20:07.316 A:middle
and wide logos and selecting

00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:07.906 A:middle
your background color.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:11.956 A:middle
Last key point, begin your app

00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:13.726 A:middle
planning early and by that we

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.776 A:middle
mean as you develop your

00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:17.986 A:middle
Business Chat team make sure

00:20:17.986 --> 00:20:19.676 A:middle
you're pulling in the app team

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:20.706 A:middle
at the same time.

00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
The combined collaboration of

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:25.106 A:middle
your two groups will deliver a

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
much more powerful result with

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.066 A:middle
Business Chat user experiences,

00:20:29.446 --> 00:20:30.326 A:middle
largely because of the

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:31.646 A:middle
opportunity to take advantage of

00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:33.046 A:middle
iMessage apps as part of that.

00:20:33.396 --> 00:20:35.296 A:middle
And so to that point, let's

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:36.526 A:middle
start talking about the brand

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:38.326 A:middle
developer and Scottie is going

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.636 A:middle
to join me back up on stage to

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:41.146 A:middle
walk us through that and other

00:20:41.146 --> 00:20:42.846 A:middle
great app development tools to

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:44.266 A:middle
take advantage of for the best

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:45.736 A:middle
Business Chat user experiences.

00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:45.946 A:middle
Scottie.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:52.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:53.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Dan.

00:20:54.576 --> 00:20:56.756 A:middle
So today I'm going to talk to

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.796 A:middle
you about working with Business

00:20:58.796 --> 00:21:00.736 A:middle
Chat from the perspective of a

00:20:58.796 --> 00:21:00.736 A:middle
Chat from the perspective of a

00:21:00.736 --> 00:21:01.566 A:middle
brand developer.

00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:03.896 A:middle
Now what do we mean by brand

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:04.366 A:middle
developer.

00:21:05.426 --> 00:21:06.676 A:middle
It's not a developer with a

00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:07.716 A:middle
bunch of labels all over their

00:21:07.716 --> 00:21:08.106 A:middle
clothes.

00:21:08.706 --> 00:21:10.606 A:middle
Really what it is is we see

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:12.276 A:middle
brand developers being in one of

00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:13.026 A:middle
three categories.

00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.386 A:middle
The first category is maybe

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:16.296 A:middle
you're working with a CSP, a

00:21:16.356 --> 00:21:18.926 A:middle
customer service platform, and

00:21:18.926 --> 00:21:21.336 A:middle
you're working to deliver custom

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.166 A:middle
iMessage extensions in-app

00:21:23.336 --> 00:21:24.486 A:middle
experiences for all of the

00:21:24.486 --> 00:21:25.596 A:middle
businesses that they work with.

00:21:26.946 --> 00:21:28.906 A:middle
The second group is maybe you're

00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:30.756 A:middle
a developer working with a

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.446 A:middle
specific brand, a specific

00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:34.146 A:middle
company that's signed up to work

00:21:34.146 --> 00:21:35.606 A:middle
with Business Chat and you have

00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:37.296 A:middle
some great ideas of how you can

00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:39.216 A:middle
make iMessage apps tie into the

00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:40.266 A:middle
transcript to make a great

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:41.456 A:middle
experience for the customers.

00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:44.486 A:middle
The third group we see as maybe

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:46.066 A:middle
you're not working with anyone

00:21:46.066 --> 00:21:47.256 A:middle
at all, but you have some really

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:48.706 A:middle
great ideas of how Business Chat

00:21:48.706 --> 00:21:50.426 A:middle
can come alive with some custom

00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:51.236 A:middle
iMessage apps.

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:53.726 A:middle
In the past week we've heard

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:55.316 A:middle
from a number of you and there's

00:21:55.316 --> 00:21:56.096 A:middle
really some exciting

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.586 A:middle
opportunities here for some

00:21:57.586 --> 00:21:58.886 A:middle
great experiences that can

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
potentially be sold to customer

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
potentially be sold to customer

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:02.196 A:middle
service platforms or brands.

00:22:03.286 --> 00:22:04.556 A:middle
We've also heard from a lot of

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.486 A:middle
you from all the three

00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:06.636 A:middle
categories over the last year

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:08.736 A:middle
and I want to thank you for

00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:09.976 A:middle
contacting us because we see

00:22:09.976 --> 00:22:11.606 A:middle
some real great potential and

00:22:11.856 --> 00:22:13.216 A:middle
some great user experiences that

00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:14.276 A:middle
will come into Business Chat

00:22:14.276 --> 00:22:15.026 A:middle
soon, so thank you.

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:18.716 A:middle
Let's start talking about if you

00:22:18.716 --> 00:22:19.826 A:middle
even need an app at all.

00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:21.986 A:middle
So building custom iMessage apps

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:23.776 A:middle
for Business Chat is great, but

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:24.546 A:middle
we have some built-in

00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:26.186 A:middle
functionality already in every

00:22:26.186 --> 00:22:26.866 A:middle
iOS.

00:22:27.486 --> 00:22:29.786 A:middle
So these are the List Picker,

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:31.206 A:middle
the Time Picker, and Apple Pay.

00:22:31.826 --> 00:22:33.196 A:middle
I went through these last year

00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:36.026 A:middle
in detail, but this year with

00:22:36.026 --> 00:22:38.006 A:middle
iOS 12 we heard your feedback

00:22:38.006 --> 00:22:39.046 A:middle
and we're adding one of the most

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:40.546 A:middle
requested features which is

00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:42.286 A:middle
Authentication new in iOS 12.

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:46.086 A:middle
Great.

00:22:47.726 --> 00:22:48.926 A:middle
So let me go through these now.

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:50.556 A:middle
First, we have List Picker.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:52.256 A:middle
List Picker allows your business

00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:53.626 A:middle
to send down a list of products

00:22:54.266 --> 00:22:56.436 A:middle
grouped in sections, each

00:22:56.436 --> 00:22:58.516 A:middle
section can have a number of

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:00.006 A:middle
different products and new in

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:00.006 A:middle
different products and new in

00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:02.446 A:middle
iOS 11.3 and above we allow your

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:03.986 A:middle
business to specify if a section

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:06.046 A:middle
should be a multiple selection

00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:07.096 A:middle
or a single selection.

00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:09.016 A:middle
Now this is great for some

00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:11.536 A:middle
experiences, such as like trying

00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:13.176 A:middle
to order a pizza where maybe the

00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:15.126 A:middle
crust is only, you can only have

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.666 A:middle
one crust on your pizza, one

00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:18.776 A:middle
crust type, but the toppings

00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:20.016 A:middle
you'd want to offer a range of

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:21.176 A:middle
toppings the user can select

00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:21.466 A:middle
from.

00:23:21.846 --> 00:23:23.586 A:middle
So we allow that section to be

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:24.676 A:middle
have a multiple selection, so

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:26.406 A:middle
that's new in iOS 11.3.

00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:29.736 A:middle
Next, we have the Time Picker.

00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:31.546 A:middle
The Time Picker allows your

00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:33.146 A:middle
business to send a number of

00:23:33.256 --> 00:23:35.326 A:middle
preselected dates and times to

00:23:35.326 --> 00:23:36.746 A:middle
allow your user to select.

00:23:37.306 --> 00:23:39.026 A:middle
These also -- the Time Picker

00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:40.676 A:middle
also ties into your local

00:23:40.936 --> 00:23:43.296 A:middle
calendar store and will feature

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:44.626 A:middle
certain conflicts that you may

00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:47.056 A:middle
have conflicting with the time

00:23:47.056 --> 00:23:47.466 A:middle
selected.

00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:50.336 A:middle
Once you've selected a time and

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:51.856 A:middle
you've sent this back to the

00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:53.536 A:middle
business you can easily then add

00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:54.606 A:middle
the appointment to your own

00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:56.606 A:middle
calendar and even get directions

00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:57.786 A:middle
to the event if the company

00:23:57.786 --> 00:23:59.766 A:middle
specifies a location.

00:24:00.186 --> 00:24:03.226 A:middle
Next, we have Apple Pay.

00:24:04.036 --> 00:24:05.556 A:middle
There's those high heels again.

00:24:06.146 --> 00:24:07.636 A:middle
Apple Pay allows your business

00:24:07.726 --> 00:24:09.896 A:middle
to quickly and easily send the

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:10.796 A:middle
payment request to your

00:24:10.796 --> 00:24:11.266 A:middle
customer.

00:24:11.686 --> 00:24:13.126 A:middle
The customer all they need to do

00:24:13.126 --> 00:24:14.526 A:middle
is tap that bubble, up comes an

00:24:14.526 --> 00:24:16.086 A:middle
Apple Pay sheet, they can

00:24:16.086 --> 00:24:19.756 A:middle
quickly Face ID, Touch ID and

00:24:19.856 --> 00:24:21.206 A:middle
right within Messages quickly

00:24:21.206 --> 00:24:21.976 A:middle
pay your business.

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:23.236 A:middle
It really wouldn't be Business

00:24:23.236 --> 00:24:25.596 A:middle
Chat without Apple Pay.

00:24:25.786 --> 00:24:29.116 A:middle
Now new in iOS 12 we have the

00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:30.276 A:middle
Authentication plug-in.

00:24:30.976 --> 00:24:31.936 A:middle
This allows your business

00:24:31.936 --> 00:24:34.196 A:middle
quickly to allow you to log in

00:24:34.926 --> 00:24:37.486 A:middle
and then get great customer

00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:38.846 A:middle
information from your login.

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:40.946 A:middle
So let me go through that a

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:43.776 A:middle
little bit more right now.

00:24:44.096 --> 00:24:45.516 A:middle
It starts off in a conversation

00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:46.496 A:middle
when you get to that point where

00:24:46.496 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
maybe you need to get a little

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
bit more details from the

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:50.776 A:middle
customer that would be provided

00:24:50.776 --> 00:24:51.436 A:middle
by their account.

00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:54.826 A:middle
Now as you see here, the

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.986 A:middle
customer service agent will send

00:24:56.986 --> 00:24:58.816 A:middle
down an authentication request.

00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:01.526 A:middle
Their user can tap that to sign

00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:01.526 A:middle
Their user can tap that to sign

00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:03.066 A:middle
in, up comes a sheet.

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.856 A:middle
This sheet contains a link,

00:25:05.996 --> 00:25:09.656 A:middle
basically it's displaying the

00:25:09.956 --> 00:25:12.426 A:middle
business' OAuth website directly

00:25:12.506 --> 00:25:14.146 A:middle
in the Authentication plug-in.

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.926 A:middle
The user can then tap in to one

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:17.796 A:middle
of the fields and they can

00:25:17.796 --> 00:25:19.026 A:middle
simply enter in their username

00:25:19.026 --> 00:25:20.566 A:middle
and password if they have it

00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
remembered or they can tap the

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:25.916 A:middle
Password Lock icon which will

00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:27.666 A:middle
bring up a sheet of all the

00:25:27.666 --> 00:25:29.516 A:middle
saved passwords currently

00:25:29.516 --> 00:25:30.606 A:middle
already in your keychain.

00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.656 A:middle
The domain matched to the one

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
that is provided will be bubbled

00:25:35.436 --> 00:25:37.106 A:middle
to the top, you can then select

00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:37.876 A:middle
that.

00:25:38.626 --> 00:25:39.726 A:middle
The fields that we filled out.

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:43.986 A:middle
And once you log in you can

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:46.996 A:middle
basically get a response to the

00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:48.266 A:middle
business verifying that they're

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:48.706 A:middle
logged in.

00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:51.686 A:middle
So that's great, but how does

00:25:51.686 --> 00:25:52.206 A:middle
this all work?

00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:54.346 A:middle
So let me go through that now.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:56.026 A:middle
As I mentioned, it starts off

00:25:56.286 --> 00:25:57.826 A:middle
with the CSP agent sending an

00:25:57.826 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
authentication request.

00:26:00.176 --> 00:26:01.846 A:middle
This includes two pieces of

00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
really important information,

00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:04.666 A:middle
the first is a public key.

00:26:05.176 --> 00:26:06.306 A:middle
This public key is going to be

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:07.916 A:middle
later used to encrypt the token

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:08.806 A:middle
that you received from the

00:26:08.806 --> 00:26:10.426 A:middle
authentication request.

00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:13.406 A:middle
It also includes the URL of

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.406 A:middle
where the OAuth webpage lives

00:26:16.506 --> 00:26:17.886 A:middle
and we'll go through that a

00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:19.026 A:middle
little bit more in a minute.

00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.296 A:middle
So this is where it starts, the

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:22.496 A:middle
authentication request comes

00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:24.546 A:middle
down and it passes through, stop

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:25.826 A:middle
on the way at Apple Business

00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:26.476 A:middle
Chat Server.

00:26:27.126 --> 00:26:27.996 A:middle
Now why do we do this?

00:26:27.996 --> 00:26:30.166 A:middle
This we added and we did a lot

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:31.386 A:middle
of thinking about this about

00:26:31.606 --> 00:26:32.476 A:middle
adding security.

00:26:32.516 --> 00:26:33.986 A:middle
We want to make sure that your

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.536 A:middle
business has authenticated user

00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:36.966 A:middle
to the proper OAuth website.

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.646 A:middle
And for that we make sure it's

00:26:39.646 --> 00:26:41.256 A:middle
the proper information that

00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
you've already as a business

00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:44.086 A:middle
registered through Apple

00:26:44.086 --> 00:26:45.046 A:middle
Register previously.

00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:48.526 A:middle
We verify also that the request

00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:49.966 A:middle
contains all the required

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:50.336 A:middle
fields.

00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:52.506 A:middle
And then finally we deliver it

00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:53.596 A:middle
in your Messages app for the

00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:53.966 A:middle
customer.

00:26:54.396 --> 00:26:56.296 A:middle
From there as I showed you can

00:26:56.296 --> 00:26:57.246 A:middle
either type in the password

00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:59.566 A:middle
manually or access the system

00:26:59.566 --> 00:27:01.846 A:middle
keychain to pull out any stored

00:26:59.566 --> 00:27:01.846 A:middle
keychain to pull out any stored

00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
credentials that you may have.

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:07.176 A:middle
From here the next step is we go

00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.686 A:middle
directly to your business server

00:27:10.156 --> 00:27:11.436 A:middle
to hit the OAuth website.

00:27:12.196 --> 00:27:14.716 A:middle
Now this can be existing or

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.186 A:middle
potentially a little bit change

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:18.836 A:middle
for Business Chat but it allows

00:27:18.836 --> 00:27:21.186 A:middle
you to carry the user through

00:27:21.386 --> 00:27:22.676 A:middle
your standard login flow,

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:24.446 A:middle
including any extra additional

00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:27.566 A:middle
information, extra verification

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:28.636 A:middle
fields, anything along those

00:27:28.636 --> 00:27:28.926 A:middle
lines.

00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:31.526 A:middle
At the end of OAuth your OAuth

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.386 A:middle
returns a token, this is your

00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.586 A:middle
login token and there it's sent

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:36.576 A:middle
back to the Messages app.

00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.376 A:middle
What we do next is we encrypt

00:27:38.376 --> 00:27:39.886 A:middle
that token so no one else can

00:27:39.886 --> 00:27:41.766 A:middle
see it with a public key that I

00:27:41.766 --> 00:27:42.616 A:middle
mentioned earlier that's

00:27:42.616 --> 00:27:45.436 A:middle
included in the request.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:47.066 A:middle
Now your token is encrypted and

00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:48.606 A:middle
it passes back up through the

00:27:48.606 --> 00:27:50.536 A:middle
Apple Chat Server which Apple

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.006 A:middle
can't read and it lands back to

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
the agent.

00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:57.926 A:middle
Now at this time your agent may

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.156 A:middle
have the private key to decrypt

00:27:59.156 --> 00:28:00.436 A:middle
that or your business may have

00:27:59.156 --> 00:28:00.436 A:middle
that or your business may have

00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:02.666 A:middle
that private key depending on

00:28:02.986 --> 00:28:04.056 A:middle
the relationship and the

00:28:04.056 --> 00:28:05.356 A:middle
security that you've worked out.

00:28:06.056 --> 00:28:07.536 A:middle
We think a lot of people will

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.526 A:middle
actually want to send this

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:10.846 A:middle
encrypted token back to the

00:28:10.846 --> 00:28:13.046 A:middle
business to verify and decrypt

00:28:13.396 --> 00:28:15.236 A:middle
to make sure that this is in

00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:16.376 A:middle
fact the person who has just

00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
recently logged in and once

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.726 A:middle
you've decrypted it you can use

00:28:19.726 --> 00:28:21.776 A:middle
that to get all the important

00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:23.276 A:middle
customer information sent back

00:28:23.686 --> 00:28:25.426 A:middle
to the agent to help service

00:28:25.426 --> 00:28:27.726 A:middle
your account, such as your shoe

00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:29.086 A:middle
size or other order information.

00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:34.096 A:middle
So that's Authentication in iOS

00:28:34.096 --> 00:28:34.476 A:middle
12.

00:28:35.086 --> 00:28:36.396 A:middle
We think a lot of companies,

00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:37.866 A:middle
especially in healthcare and

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.006 A:middle
financial services will really

00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:39.396 A:middle
like this.

00:28:40.106 --> 00:28:41.136 A:middle
And that's what we have for

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.036 A:middle
built-in features, so you don't

00:28:43.036 --> 00:28:44.026 A:middle
have to write a single line of

00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.686 A:middle
code you can take advantage of

00:28:45.686 --> 00:28:47.446 A:middle
these by integrating with your

00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:49.326 A:middle
CSPs and your businesses today.

00:28:51.476 --> 00:28:54.226 A:middle
So next, you may want to take

00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:56.586 A:middle
this further and as I mentioned

00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:58.576 A:middle
we heard a lot of great examples

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
of how this can be done and some

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
of how this can be done and some

00:29:00.496 --> 00:29:02.036 A:middle
really great innovative ways.

00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:04.416 A:middle
So today I'm going to talk for

00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:05.876 A:middle
your features how you can

00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:07.576 A:middle
leverage native iOS

00:29:07.576 --> 00:29:10.176 A:middle
functionality, some tips about

00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:12.486 A:middle
making your iMessage apps a

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:15.336 A:middle
shared app architecture, and

00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:17.186 A:middle
talk a little bit about how to

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:18.186 A:middle
make that experience great.

00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:21.716 A:middle
So remember with iMessage apps

00:29:21.786 --> 00:29:23.176 A:middle
you can really take advantage of

00:29:23.286 --> 00:29:25.696 A:middle
full native iOS frameworks and

00:29:25.696 --> 00:29:27.286 A:middle
code throughout the system, such

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:28.416 A:middle
as a front facing camera.

00:29:29.026 --> 00:29:30.016 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if you

00:29:30.016 --> 00:29:32.016 A:middle
could try out, have your users

00:29:32.016 --> 00:29:34.956 A:middle
send pictures of them using your

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:36.096 A:middle
products, testing your products

00:29:36.096 --> 00:29:37.586 A:middle
or even seeing what kind of

00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:39.466 A:middle
situation they are working with

00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:41.176 A:middle
to help give better customer

00:29:41.226 --> 00:29:41.696 A:middle
support?

00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:43.496 A:middle
This is a whole new level of

00:29:43.496 --> 00:29:44.516 A:middle
interaction that you can have

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.726 A:middle
with your customers by actually

00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:47.576 A:middle
seeing what they're

00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:48.206 A:middle
experiencing.

00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:52.456 A:middle
Remember we have MapKit allowing

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:54.556 A:middle
your iMessage app to display a

00:29:54.556 --> 00:29:55.736 A:middle
map and then the business can

00:29:55.736 --> 00:29:58.376 A:middle
send down things such as places

00:29:58.376 --> 00:29:59.336 A:middle
that your business may be

00:29:59.336 --> 00:30:00.356 A:middle
operating in in a certain

00:29:59.336 --> 00:30:00.356 A:middle
operating in in a certain

00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:00.906 A:middle
region.

00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:04.046 A:middle
Or even providing information

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:06.016 A:middle
such as drawing custom overlays

00:30:06.016 --> 00:30:07.856 A:middle
on the map to designate maybe

00:30:07.856 --> 00:30:08.886 A:middle
coverage areas or delivery

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:09.000 A:middle
zones.

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:14.416 A:middle
Taking advantage of ARKit

00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:16.086 A:middle
provides a really a whole new

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.276 A:middle
level of interaction where

00:30:17.556 --> 00:30:19.006 A:middle
customers right from Business

00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:21.486 A:middle
Chat could try out seeing what

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.936 A:middle
products may look like in their

00:30:22.936 --> 00:30:24.706 A:middle
natural environment right from

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:26.146 A:middle
within Business Chat.

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.246 A:middle
We think these are some really

00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:31.206 A:middle
powerful examples of using your

00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:33.326 A:middle
own custom iMessage app.

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:35.756 A:middle
So by now you've probably

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:37.206 A:middle
determined you want to do a

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:39.016 A:middle
custom app, here's some things

00:30:39.016 --> 00:30:40.126 A:middle
you can do to get ready for

00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:42.226 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:44.596 A:middle
First, we'll start by talking

00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:46.226 A:middle
about what it means to have and

00:30:46.226 --> 00:30:47.136 A:middle
leverage a shared app

00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:47.706 A:middle
architecture.

00:30:49.016 --> 00:30:52.396 A:middle
So your business, your brand may

00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:55.696 A:middle
already have a full-fledged iOS

00:30:55.696 --> 00:30:57.616 A:middle
app and when you're working on

00:30:57.616 --> 00:30:58.716 A:middle
your iMessage app as an

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.736 A:middle
extension to that there's

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.736 A:middle
extension to that there's

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:02.226 A:middle
certain things you can do to

00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:02.976 A:middle
really speed up that

00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:03.466 A:middle
development.

00:31:03.986 --> 00:31:07.276 A:middle
Your main app may have several

00:31:07.276 --> 00:31:09.166 A:middle
business logic classes, a whole

00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:11.186 A:middle
bunch of utility classes, even

00:31:11.186 --> 00:31:12.106 A:middle
custom views and view

00:31:12.106 --> 00:31:13.036 A:middle
controllers that you could

00:31:13.076 --> 00:31:14.556 A:middle
easily reuse in your iMessage

00:31:14.556 --> 00:31:14.806 A:middle
app.

00:31:15.186 --> 00:31:17.596 A:middle
All you have to do is add an

00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:20.106 A:middle
iMessage app target and then

00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:22.246 A:middle
check off those classes so

00:31:22.246 --> 00:31:23.816 A:middle
they're provided, also available

00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:24.926 A:middle
in your iMessage app.

00:31:25.276 --> 00:31:28.396 A:middle
Now sometimes code is not the

00:31:28.396 --> 00:31:31.496 A:middle
cleanest and by checking one

00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:33.596 A:middle
class you may have to pull a

00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:34.836 A:middle
whole bunch of other classes

00:31:34.836 --> 00:31:37.666 A:middle
that that represents so that's

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.316 A:middle
not always the best way to go

00:31:39.316 --> 00:31:41.116 A:middle
about it and we think this is a

00:31:41.116 --> 00:31:43.256 A:middle
great opportunity where if your

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:44.166 A:middle
classes aren't fully

00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:46.366 A:middle
encapsulated it's a great time

00:31:46.436 --> 00:31:48.456 A:middle
for you to potentially refactor

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:50.856 A:middle
to get your specific business

00:31:50.926 --> 00:31:52.916 A:middle
logic into its own kind of

00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:54.886 A:middle
encapsulated place for much

00:31:54.886 --> 00:31:55.816 A:middle
better code in the future.

00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:58.386 A:middle
So that's shared core resources,

00:31:58.746 --> 00:32:00.406 A:middle
really you know adding your

00:31:58.746 --> 00:32:00.406 A:middle
really you know adding your

00:32:00.406 --> 00:32:02.566 A:middle
iMessage app target to your

00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:04.076 A:middle
project, checking off a few

00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:05.526 A:middle
classes, you can get really far

00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:06.076 A:middle
really quickly.

00:32:07.476 --> 00:32:08.516 A:middle
Next, we have a shared

00:32:08.516 --> 00:32:10.156 A:middle
filesystem between your app and

00:32:10.156 --> 00:32:11.576 A:middle
your iMessage app.

00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:15.006 A:middle
And with that if your main app

00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:17.946 A:middle
has already downloaded of images

00:32:17.946 --> 00:32:19.766 A:middle
or files or anything important

00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:22.166 A:middle
that your app needs to do you

00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:23.226 A:middle
can reference them from your

00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:24.836 A:middle
iMessage app in Business Chat

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:26.576 A:middle
without having to redownload

00:32:26.576 --> 00:32:28.756 A:middle
those and provides a much better

00:32:28.756 --> 00:32:29.716 A:middle
customer experience.

00:32:30.836 --> 00:32:32.086 A:middle
You can also go the other way

00:32:32.476 --> 00:32:33.466 A:middle
and save things from your

00:32:33.466 --> 00:32:34.836 A:middle
iMessage app back to the app so

00:32:34.836 --> 00:32:36.806 A:middle
then when you launch back to the

00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
app that information is readily

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:38.846 A:middle
available.

00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:42.016 A:middle
Now that's great for files that

00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:44.126 A:middle
are not really sensitive or need

00:32:44.126 --> 00:32:45.866 A:middle
to be secured, but if you have

00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:47.486 A:middle
those needs the system keychain

00:32:47.486 --> 00:32:48.276 A:middle
is also shared.

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.446 A:middle
So if you were writing down

00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:51.616 A:middle
potentially even login

00:32:51.846 --> 00:32:53.716 A:middle
credentials or tokens from a

00:32:53.716 --> 00:32:55.436 A:middle
previous login in the app you

00:32:55.436 --> 00:32:56.746 A:middle
can quickly make use of those in

00:32:56.746 --> 00:32:58.866 A:middle
your iMessage app and have those

00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:00.996 A:middle
speed up your login process when

00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:00.996 A:middle
speed up your login process when

00:33:00.996 --> 00:33:01.736 A:middle
using Business Chat.

00:33:02.926 --> 00:33:05.816 A:middle
Even provide you know customer

00:33:05.816 --> 00:33:07.186 A:middle
data right when launching the

00:33:07.316 --> 00:33:08.406 A:middle
iMessage app.

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:14.116 A:middle
Keep in mind, you can always go

00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:15.686 A:middle
from the iMessage app to your

00:33:15.686 --> 00:33:16.206 A:middle
main app.

00:33:16.206 --> 00:33:17.596 A:middle
So let's say you're in a

00:33:17.596 --> 00:33:18.976 A:middle
Business Chat conversation and

00:33:19.266 --> 00:33:21.106 A:middle
the user is navigating through

00:33:21.106 --> 00:33:22.506 A:middle
your iMessage app and there's

00:33:22.506 --> 00:33:24.076 A:middle
something that maybe your full

00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:25.476 A:middle
app would be a better experience

00:33:25.476 --> 00:33:27.646 A:middle
for you can provide a link, as

00:33:27.646 --> 00:33:28.536 A:middle
well as a deep link.

00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:29.956 A:middle
So you can go directly from the

00:33:29.956 --> 00:33:31.896 A:middle
iMessage app directly to the

00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:34.076 A:middle
full app right into the place or

00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:35.366 A:middle
maybe the product or the

00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:36.236 A:middle
information that they were

00:33:36.236 --> 00:33:41.056 A:middle
looking for with just one tap.

00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:43.196 A:middle
And keep in mind that once you

00:33:43.196 --> 00:33:45.776 A:middle
make these iMessage apps not all

00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:47.876 A:middle
your customers will have that

00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:49.466 A:middle
preinstalled on their device

00:33:49.466 --> 00:33:50.836 A:middle
right then or all their devices.

00:33:51.266 --> 00:33:52.536 A:middle
So if you run across this

00:33:52.536 --> 00:33:55.136 A:middle
scenario as we showed last year

00:33:55.136 --> 00:33:57.336 A:middle
as well a user just has to tap

00:33:57.336 --> 00:33:59.756 A:middle
the bubble, up comes an App

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:00.706 A:middle
Store sheet where they can

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:00.706 A:middle
Store sheet where they can

00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:02.446 A:middle
quickly and easily download the

00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:04.436 A:middle
app and continue right there in

00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:06.516 A:middle
the iMessage conversation having

00:34:06.516 --> 00:34:07.716 A:middle
now downloaded that app and

00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:10.896 A:middle
iMessage app to your device.

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:13.536 A:middle
So that's covering some great

00:34:13.966 --> 00:34:15.176 A:middle
ways that you can take advantage

00:34:15.176 --> 00:34:16.496 A:middle
of the shared app architecture,

00:34:16.676 --> 00:34:18.746 A:middle
a lot of the code and scenarios

00:34:18.746 --> 00:34:20.065 A:middle
that you've already built with

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:21.866 A:middle
your main app.

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:24.016 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the Chat

00:34:24.016 --> 00:34:25.176 A:middle
with Messages button API.

00:34:26.216 --> 00:34:27.985 A:middle
As Dan showed, this is a great

00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:30.666 A:middle
new API that allows your apps to

00:34:30.666 --> 00:34:33.606 A:middle
leverage this standard Apple

00:34:33.606 --> 00:34:35.766 A:middle
button now in iOS 11.3 and

00:34:35.766 --> 00:34:36.485 A:middle
above.

00:34:37.096 --> 00:34:38.806 A:middle
There's two ways to use this, we

00:34:38.806 --> 00:34:40.376 A:middle
have the BC Chat button in the

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:42.045 A:middle
Business Chat framework which

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:44.295 A:middle
you can use in your iOS apps and

00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:46.235 A:middle
there's a JavaScript version for

00:34:46.235 --> 00:34:47.666 A:middle
websites that'll be made

00:34:47.666 --> 00:34:48.976 A:middle
available to you as you sign up

00:34:49.235 --> 00:34:50.735 A:middle
through Apple Business Register.

00:34:52.755 --> 00:34:54.646 A:middle
Today I'll show you some code

00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:56.516 A:middle
examples of how to use the BC

00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:58.096 A:middle
chat button in your iOS apps.

00:34:58.536 --> 00:34:59.866 A:middle
So here we have an example

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:02.096 A:middle
showing the first step I just

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:02.096 A:middle
showing the first step I just

00:35:02.096 --> 00:35:03.546 A:middle
have to import the Business Chat

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.076 A:middle
framework which is on the SDK.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:07.876 A:middle
Then I can go ahead and

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:10.426 A:middle
instantiate a button of the BC

00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:12.066 A:middle
chat button and we allow you to

00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.366 A:middle
pass in some style information

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:15.766 A:middle
depending on the look and feel

00:35:15.766 --> 00:35:16.986 A:middle
of your app, it may look better

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:18.546 A:middle
with a light style or a dark

00:35:18.546 --> 00:35:19.216 A:middle
style.

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:22.236 A:middle
Then this is a standard button

00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:23.306 A:middle
so I'm going to add a target.

00:35:23.396 --> 00:35:24.956 A:middle
And what you'll note here is

00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:27.216 A:middle
this is available on iOS and

00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:27.746 A:middle
macOS.

00:35:27.746 --> 00:35:30.436 A:middle
So if you're making Mac apps or

00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:32.206 A:middle
iOS apps you can take advantage

00:35:32.496 --> 00:35:34.266 A:middle
of this with even a shared code

00:35:34.676 --> 00:35:36.376 A:middle
to have this available across

00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:37.046 A:middle
your platforms.

00:35:38.086 --> 00:35:40.506 A:middle
Once I've configured the what's

00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:41.566 A:middle
going to happen when I tap the

00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:43.646 A:middle
button I can go ahead and add

00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.376 A:middle
this button to my views and

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:47.636 A:middle
configure constraints and all

00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:48.506 A:middle
the things to make the button

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:48.876 A:middle
look great.

00:35:49.996 --> 00:35:52.906 A:middle
Now that's putting the button in

00:35:52.976 --> 00:35:53.406 A:middle
the app.

00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:54.836 A:middle
So what happens when the user

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:55.446 A:middle
taps the button?

00:35:55.676 --> 00:35:59.526 A:middle
Well from here as Dan mentioned

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.356 A:middle
in his example he is showing an

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.356 A:middle
in his example he is showing an

00:36:01.356 --> 00:36:02.706 A:middle
address getting passed through.

00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:04.956 A:middle
In my example I'm showing here

00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:06.806 A:middle
that you can programmatically

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:08.016 A:middle
define an intent.

00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:11.356 A:middle
Maybe the user is browsing

00:36:11.456 --> 00:36:13.346 A:middle
through your app and has landed

00:36:13.706 --> 00:36:14.836 A:middle
on a certain shoe product.

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:16.426 A:middle
You could tack on the product

00:36:16.426 --> 00:36:18.836 A:middle
information so right when the

00:36:18.836 --> 00:36:20.516 A:middle
Business Chat conversation comes

00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:22.296 A:middle
alive the customer service agent

00:36:22.296 --> 00:36:23.546 A:middle
already knows the product that

00:36:23.546 --> 00:36:24.726 A:middle
you're referring to.

00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:27.236 A:middle
The group allows you to specify

00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:30.126 A:middle
potentially where to route on

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:31.506 A:middle
the backend this conversation,

00:36:31.966 --> 00:36:33.346 A:middle
things like support or maybe

00:36:33.346 --> 00:36:35.666 A:middle
sales would be appropriate or

00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.286 A:middle
other as Dan showed, other

00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:39.896 A:middle
regional based kind of

00:36:39.896 --> 00:36:40.576 A:middle
specifications.

00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:43.916 A:middle
And then you can also even

00:36:44.046 --> 00:36:45.996 A:middle
specify some default text that

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.006 A:middle
when the user lands on the

00:36:47.006 --> 00:36:48.416 A:middle
message conversation will be

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.756 A:middle
automatically filled in on the

00:36:50.756 --> 00:36:52.176 A:middle
text field so all the user has

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:52.996 A:middle
to do is hit Send.

00:36:54.316 --> 00:36:55.696 A:middle
Great, so now I've configured

00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:58.346 A:middle
these parameters and the next

00:36:58.346 --> 00:37:00.066 A:middle
step I do is I call the

00:36:58.346 --> 00:37:00.066 A:middle
step I do is I call the

00:37:00.066 --> 00:37:02.066 A:middle
BCChatAction to open the

00:37:02.066 --> 00:37:03.956 A:middle
transcript and provide the

00:37:03.956 --> 00:37:05.526 A:middle
business identifier which is

00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:08.386 A:middle
provided to you upon acceptance

00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:09.556 A:middle
into Business Chat through the

00:37:09.556 --> 00:37:10.006 A:middle
register.

00:37:10.496 --> 00:37:12.726 A:middle
I also send in the parameters so

00:37:12.726 --> 00:37:14.706 A:middle
they are taken up and sent.

00:37:15.256 --> 00:37:18.786 A:middle
At the end of the day once the

00:37:18.786 --> 00:37:20.736 A:middle
user taps that button they're

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:22.556 A:middle
switched directly to Messages

00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:24.506 A:middle
into the conversation directly

00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:25.256 A:middle
with that business.

00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.596 A:middle
And the information with intent

00:37:27.596 --> 00:37:28.806 A:middle
and group are provided

00:37:28.806 --> 00:37:29.346 A:middle
automatically.

00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:32.186 A:middle
So that's Chat with Message

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:32.706 A:middle
button API.

00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:35.536 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk about

00:37:35.536 --> 00:37:36.316 A:middle
Sandbox testing.

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:39.636 A:middle
Last year at WWDC we introduced

00:37:39.636 --> 00:37:40.896 A:middle
the Business Chat Sandbox.

00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:44.236 A:middle
Here's the URL and last year I

00:37:44.236 --> 00:37:45.946 A:middle
even gave a demo of how this

00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:47.806 A:middle
works and how you can make use

00:37:47.806 --> 00:37:49.716 A:middle
of this for your testing.

00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:52.496 A:middle
Here's a screenshot of the

00:37:52.496 --> 00:37:54.366 A:middle
design and what you see here is

00:37:54.366 --> 00:37:55.596 A:middle
we have tabs across the top

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:57.766 A:middle
letting you try out all the

00:37:57.766 --> 00:37:59.146 A:middle
experiences of Business Chat

00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:02.756 A:middle
right from kind of pretending to

00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:02.756 A:middle
right from kind of pretending to

00:38:02.756 --> 00:38:04.136 A:middle
be a fake CSP or business.

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:06.546 A:middle
Every one of you can log in and

00:38:06.546 --> 00:38:08.056 A:middle
do this today, you don't need

00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:09.086 A:middle
any approvals.

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.136 A:middle
You basically can log in and get

00:38:11.136 --> 00:38:12.816 A:middle
started sending sample text

00:38:12.816 --> 00:38:14.416 A:middle
messages and instantiating all

00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:15.706 A:middle
of the different built-in

00:38:15.706 --> 00:38:16.336 A:middle
functionality.

00:38:17.376 --> 00:38:18.496 A:middle
As we showed last year you can

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.956 A:middle
even test out your own custom

00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:22.196 A:middle
iMessage apps by using the My

00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:22.716 A:middle
App tab.

00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:25.596 A:middle
And new this year for iOS 12

00:38:25.596 --> 00:38:27.156 A:middle
we've added the Auth tab where

00:38:27.156 --> 00:38:29.296 A:middle
you can try out and play with

00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:30.126 A:middle
the new with the new Auth

00:38:30.126 --> 00:38:31.996 A:middle
functionality, including a

00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:33.756 A:middle
sample OAuth provided webpage

00:38:33.756 --> 00:38:34.526 A:middle
through the Business Chat

00:38:34.526 --> 00:38:35.566 A:middle
Sandbox which is great.

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:37.716 A:middle
Or if you have your own OAuth

00:38:37.856 --> 00:38:39.766 A:middle
website already you could

00:38:39.766 --> 00:38:41.236 A:middle
override that and enter your own

00:38:41.236 --> 00:38:42.796 A:middle
so you can try it out and see if

00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:44.156 A:middle
it works with your business

00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:44.586 A:middle
setup.

00:38:44.936 --> 00:38:47.756 A:middle
So the Sandbox really allows you

00:38:48.156 --> 00:38:50.166 A:middle
to kind of see and feel this and

00:38:50.166 --> 00:38:51.636 A:middle
we really encourage you to use

00:38:51.636 --> 00:38:53.776 A:middle
this because you'll kind of,

00:38:53.776 --> 00:38:55.016 A:middle
you'll see the use case and

00:38:55.016 --> 00:38:56.206 A:middle
you'll feel how the use cases

00:38:56.206 --> 00:38:56.666 A:middle
interact.

00:38:56.986 --> 00:38:58.216 A:middle
We also think it's a great way

00:38:58.216 --> 00:39:00.066 A:middle
to demo this to maybe

00:38:58.216 --> 00:39:00.066 A:middle
to demo this to maybe

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:01.476 A:middle
decision-makers in your business

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.456 A:middle
so they can make a great, kind

00:39:03.626 --> 00:39:05.086 A:middle
to fine-tune those experiences

00:39:05.086 --> 00:39:05.936 A:middle
before you go live.

00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:08.466 A:middle
So I can't stress enough how

00:39:08.466 --> 00:39:09.596 A:middle
valuable this Business Chat

00:39:09.596 --> 00:39:11.656 A:middle
Sandbox can be.

00:39:11.896 --> 00:39:13.486 A:middle
And finally let's cover some

00:39:13.486 --> 00:39:14.236 A:middle
best practices.

00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:17.536 A:middle
So as I covered, start with the

00:39:17.536 --> 00:39:19.356 A:middle
Sandbox, really see how these

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:20.676 A:middle
experiences will look and feel,

00:39:20.676 --> 00:39:22.506 A:middle
try it out with some people.

00:39:22.686 --> 00:39:23.656 A:middle
You can have your you know

00:39:23.656 --> 00:39:25.296 A:middle
laptop set up with Sandbox on

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.586 A:middle
one side and have someone on the

00:39:26.586 --> 00:39:27.636 A:middle
other side with the device

00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:29.656 A:middle
trying this interaction out.

00:39:29.896 --> 00:39:31.676 A:middle
Really valuable to kind of see

00:39:31.676 --> 00:39:33.726 A:middle
and feel how to build these

00:39:33.796 --> 00:39:35.466 A:middle
first-class customer

00:39:35.466 --> 00:39:36.006 A:middle
experiences.

00:39:37.836 --> 00:39:40.486 A:middle
Then think about enhancing your

00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:42.946 A:middle
app and adding a messages app to

00:39:42.946 --> 00:39:44.416 A:middle
that to really take that

00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:45.516 A:middle
experience even further.

00:39:46.116 --> 00:39:49.326 A:middle
Now I have a separate bullet

00:39:49.326 --> 00:39:51.276 A:middle
point about customizing that

00:39:51.276 --> 00:39:53.156 A:middle
user experience specifically

00:39:53.156 --> 00:39:55.656 A:middle
because we want to make sure

00:39:55.656 --> 00:39:57.206 A:middle
that you understand that

00:39:57.206 --> 00:39:58.776 A:middle
iMessage apps are not the full

00:39:58.826 --> 00:39:58.936 A:middle
apps.

00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:01.296 A:middle
They are specifically designed

00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:01.296 A:middle
They are specifically designed

00:40:01.296 --> 00:40:03.496 A:middle
for quick interactions that'll

00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:06.426 A:middle
add value and not be too

00:40:06.426 --> 00:40:07.866 A:middle
daunting for someone who is in a

00:40:07.866 --> 00:40:09.726 A:middle
conversation who just wants to

00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:11.266 A:middle
get stuff done with Business

00:40:11.266 --> 00:40:11.666 A:middle
Chat.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.226 A:middle
For that we recommend really

00:40:13.226 --> 00:40:14.636 A:middle
taking a look at all the things

00:40:14.636 --> 00:40:15.616 A:middle
you've done in the app and

00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:17.046 A:middle
what's appropriate in iMessage

00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:19.066 A:middle
apps, but also to custom tailor

00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:21.856 A:middle
it so they kind of fit and flow

00:40:21.856 --> 00:40:22.866 A:middle
into the user experience you're

00:40:22.866 --> 00:40:23.306 A:middle
looking for.

00:40:24.736 --> 00:40:26.336 A:middle
This is also a great way to

00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:28.666 A:middle
really stand out in Business

00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:29.596 A:middle
Chat and in your customer

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:30.686 A:middle
service experiences.

00:40:31.876 --> 00:40:33.346 A:middle
Then as I mentioned, integrate

00:40:33.546 --> 00:40:35.776 A:middle
with your message API button, BC

00:40:35.776 --> 00:40:37.326 A:middle
chat button and add it to your

00:40:37.326 --> 00:40:38.766 A:middle
apps, into your websites and

00:40:38.766 --> 00:40:39.000 A:middle
your emails.

00:40:43.056 --> 00:40:44.616 A:middle
So that's some best practices,

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:47.236 A:middle
that's what we would like you to

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.736 A:middle
know about getting started as a

00:40:49.736 --> 00:40:50.486 A:middle
brand developer.

00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.026 A:middle
And now I'm going to hand it

00:40:52.026 --> 00:40:53.976 A:middle
back to Dan to finish this up.

00:40:54.516 --> 00:40:58.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:00.126 A:middle
Well done buddy.

00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:00.126 A:middle
Well done buddy.

00:41:00.236 --> 00:41:01.916 A:middle
Thanks Scottie, that was great.

00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:04.216 A:middle
And it's super exciting about

00:41:04.366 --> 00:41:06.676 A:middle
finally being able to launch the

00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:07.896 A:middle
OAuth authentication built-in

00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:08.306 A:middle
feature.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.076 A:middle
That is going to be huge because

00:41:10.076 --> 00:41:11.906 A:middle
we have a ton of demand coming

00:41:11.906 --> 00:41:12.846 A:middle
at us for that type of a

00:41:12.846 --> 00:41:13.976 A:middle
built-in functionality, so

00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:14.796 A:middle
that's very exciting.

00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:16.826 A:middle
All right, some key things.

00:41:17.046 --> 00:41:18.366 A:middle
First of all, we've covered a

00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:19.966 A:middle
lot of highlights today but

00:41:19.966 --> 00:41:21.346 A:middle
there's a lot of great

00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:22.736 A:middle
documentation and information

00:41:22.736 --> 00:41:25.016 A:middle
available to you at this link.

00:41:25.706 --> 00:41:27.046 A:middle
And so, please make note of it,

00:41:27.766 --> 00:41:29.146 A:middle
if you haven't it now you'll be

00:41:29.146 --> 00:41:30.416 A:middle
able to afterwards in the video.

00:41:30.736 --> 00:41:33.086 A:middle
But it will take you to lots of

00:41:33.086 --> 00:41:34.466 A:middle
different documentation that

00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:36.296 A:middle
will cover many of the things

00:41:36.296 --> 00:41:37.376 A:middle
we've talked about would but be

00:41:37.376 --> 00:41:38.736 A:middle
able to drill down much deeper

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:40.106 A:middle
than that into our getting

00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:41.536 A:middle
started guides and best

00:41:41.536 --> 00:41:43.596 A:middle
practices, again being able to

00:41:43.596 --> 00:41:44.816 A:middle
get right into understanding how

00:41:44.816 --> 00:41:46.576 A:middle
to use Business Register, the

00:41:46.576 --> 00:41:48.046 A:middle
Sandbox which is critical of

00:41:48.046 --> 00:41:49.716 A:middle
course, and even last year's

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.016 A:middle
video which we'd recommend you

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:53.516 A:middle
revisit to just get again a good

00:41:53.516 --> 00:41:53.996 A:middle
primer.

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.556 A:middle
And so I'm going to leave you

00:41:56.556 --> 00:41:58.106 A:middle
with this one important thought

00:41:58.106 --> 00:41:59.996 A:middle
that once again today for the

00:41:59.996 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
first time we're going to open

00:41:59.996 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
first time we're going to open

00:42:01.306 --> 00:42:03.336 A:middle
the door significantly wider to

00:42:03.336 --> 00:42:04.996 A:middle
medium to large consumer brands

00:42:04.996 --> 00:42:06.716 A:middle
around the world and new

00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:09.126 A:middle
qualified CSPs that can support

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:10.286 A:middle
those medium to large consumer

00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:10.836 A:middle
brands.

00:42:11.266 --> 00:42:13.216 A:middle
And so just as a reminder, if

00:42:13.216 --> 00:42:15.336 A:middle
you feel you're a qualified CSP,

00:42:15.636 --> 00:42:17.576 A:middle
please come right away to Apple

00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.696 A:middle
Business Register and qualify by

00:42:19.696 --> 00:42:20.946 A:middle
registering and providing us

00:42:20.946 --> 00:42:22.796 A:middle
your information and we'll move

00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:24.996 A:middle
you through a very rapid process

00:42:24.996 --> 00:42:25.256 A:middle
now.

00:42:25.256 --> 00:42:26.476 A:middle
So we're speeding up the

00:42:26.476 --> 00:42:28.006 A:middle
approval process in Apple

00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:28.776 A:middle
Business Register.

00:42:29.616 --> 00:42:31.256 A:middle
If you're a consumer brand,

00:42:31.736 --> 00:42:33.116 A:middle
please again make sure you come

00:42:33.116 --> 00:42:34.816 A:middle
register, make sure you notify

00:42:35.066 --> 00:42:36.276 A:middle
and pick your CSP and then

00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:37.656 A:middle
notify your CSP that you've

00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:38.966 A:middle
selected them so you can start

00:42:38.966 --> 00:42:40.786 A:middle
working together rapidly and

00:42:40.786 --> 00:42:41.676 A:middle
start integrating.

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.176 A:middle
And then lastly, if you're a

00:42:43.176 --> 00:42:45.436 A:middle
brand developer once again start

00:42:45.436 --> 00:42:47.586 A:middle
the planning process early, use

00:42:47.586 --> 00:42:49.296 A:middle
the Sandbox to start prototyping

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:50.576 A:middle
the new OAuth authentication

00:42:50.576 --> 00:42:51.816 A:middle
built-in feature and all the

00:42:51.816 --> 00:42:52.876 A:middle
built-in features.

00:42:53.086 --> 00:42:54.596 A:middle
It will immediately help you

00:42:54.596 --> 00:42:56.696 A:middle
accelerate the ability to get to

00:42:56.696 --> 00:42:58.556 A:middle
a Business Chat launch faster.

00:42:58.696 --> 00:43:00.176 A:middle
And of course take advantage of

00:42:58.696 --> 00:43:00.176 A:middle
And of course take advantage of

00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:01.456 A:middle
the opportunity to start

00:43:01.456 --> 00:43:03.046 A:middle
developing your iMessage app as

00:43:03.046 --> 00:43:03.876 A:middle
part of the Business Chat

00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:04.566 A:middle
experience.

00:43:05.196 --> 00:43:06.786 A:middle
On behalf of Scottie and I thank

00:43:07.976 --> 00:43:09.596 A:middle
