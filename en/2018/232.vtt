  Good morning and welcome to Getting Ready for Business Chat, I'm Dan and very shortly my esteemed colleague Scottie will be joining me on stage.
 Last year at WWDC2017 Grant and Scottie announced Business Chat Developer Preview as a great new feature of our Messages app, our most popular app for Apple users to securely and richly be able to message with brands, consumer brands, all around the world for customer service and commerce.
 We also launched our Apple Business Register at registered.
apple.
 com/business-chat as the fundamental way for businesses and customer service platform providers, which I'm going to call CSPs from now on to easily submit their application of interest for access to a Business Chat account.
 Since then we've had a ton of interest with thousands of businesses and developers submitting applications for Business Chat.
 Thank you very much for the overwhelming fantastic response and thank you for your patience.
 After a few months of working closely with some major brands and their CSP providers we announced the public release of Business Chat Beta in March.
 Now when we announced this we also announced that in order to use Business Chat users had to upgrade to these versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS or later in order to message with brands using Business Chat.
 And experienced some really rich message conversation with great showcase brands in the retail sector, in finance, in hospitality, and mobile services supported by their CSP providers like LivePerson, Salesforce, Nuance, and InTheChat.
 Hopefully you've had a chance to actually experiment and play with and, in fact, use some of these great experiences with these brands.
 But in case you haven't just as a quick reminder let me show you an example where I can easily start a conversation with T-Mobile by swiping on the home screen for iOS search, typing in T-Mobile and then looking at the search results, finding this specific business preview, tapping on the message button, and immediately going into a conversation with T-Mobile.
 And in this example the T-Mobile automated response clarifies whether I'm a current customer or not with a list picker, so I tap on that, I get a choice, I select Heck yeah.
 And then now the automated response wants to get me to actually log in so we can get into a lot of personal details about my account.
 I tap on the rich bubble, it opens an iMessage app for authentication, I enter my credentials and I'm in.
 All easily done within the message conversation.
 And so now I can continue to have a very detailed conversation about my account and by the way, if I get really busy and I have to leave to go do something else when I get back home or back to the office I can pick right back up where I left off on my Mac with the Messages app.
 Or if I'm busy and I'm on the go I can receive and send Business Chat messages from my Apple watch.
 Okay so that brings us to today and I'm really excited to announce that we're going to open the doors significantly wider to many more consumer brands around the world and more customer service platform providers.
 Very excited yes, thank you.
 So let's look at some key steps that I think are important that we've learned that we want to relay back to you about how to get ready whether you're a CSP, whether you're a consumer brand or whether you're a brand developer.
 Starting with CSP providers.
 There are two qualifying criteria that we look at closely when thinking about the potential for a new CSP provider for Business Chat and I'm going to talk about those in a sec.
 We also then once approved spend and invest time with CSP providers to help them get ready to provide a great business chat user experience and to get off to a very fast start and we'll talk about those quickly.
 Starting with servicing medium to large consumer brands.
 For now, we're going to be very focused on medium to large consumer brands.
 So as a qualified CSP you have this base of customers and you're providing them with a platform solution that provides contact management for these brands, especially for messaging.
 And as a qualified CSP you have these consumer brand customers around the world in various regions, whether it's North or South America, whether it's Europe, whether it's Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand or globally, but you do have a base of these consumer brands, medium to large consumer brands around the world in one or more regions.
 And as a qualified CSP you provide a fully featured platform, so what do we mean by that? Well let's look at some major features that we look for in perspective CSPs that are going to provide a great experience for their customers with Business Chat.
 So starting with let's look at this first example of an agent console from LivePerson.
 The LivePerson live engage console has the opportunity because of its built-in capabilities for what we call dynamic widgets.
 And so a dynamic widget provides the agent the capability to populate with the right content both image and text based on how Business Chat operates based on our API and built-in functionality so that the agent can simply tap on that to send the payload down to me on my iPhone when I'm communicating with the Lowe's agent so that I can make a simple selection because I'm looking for smart locks that support HomeKit.
 Very easy to do, but the console functionality is very important to have this built in.
 So then I'm ready to make a purchase and I see oh, not my HomeKit smart locks I see red heeled shoes, thanks Scottie.
 So now I guess I'm going to be buying red heeled shoes.
 So but in this case the same thing an intelligent dynamic widget that populates for the agent the Apple Pay payload that they can easily tap on again to send the payload to me so that all I have to do now is tap to authenticate using Touch ID or Face ID.
 A very efficient, very powerful way to implement Business Chat.
 So let's talk about backend systems, so backend systems integration is also very important.
 Your platform must have APIs that support your customers' backend systems such as CRM, scheduling, product inventory, inventory ordering, order entry, payment systems.
 And in this example, it's a Salesforce lightning service console where because of a previous conversation they had my stable identifier, but they've now -- I've identified myself and they've now connected me to a profile.
 So now when I come back, the agent CRM profile comes up and they know about me so I can start a very natural conversation right off the bat.
 And the agent has the ability to pull from their engagement case history all the previous engagements I've had to again be able to pull back some history and go into a very fluid, easy conversation with me-- super important to have this backend systems integration capability.
 The next key point, intelligent message routing.
 So as you probably may recall from last year, we announced intent and group IDs as part of the infrastructure support for message payloads that are being sent from me through the business chat API to the customer service platform provider.
 In this case, I may be searching in the Maps app for a specific location for Home Depot in Santa Clara and I start the conversation here by tapping on the Message button.
 And it sends and appends in the intent and group ID the actual address that I've started at.
 And so this is important because the intelligent routing of your platform may need to be able to based on your business rules route this to the right agent group perhaps on the West Coast because of hours of operation.
 But it also supports the agent's ability to then know where I started my journey and be able to help me right away knowing I'm probably interested about that specific store location.
 Okay lastly, quality of service monitoring, QOS, very important and so in this example with the Nuance dashboard.
 Your platform needs to be able to monitor, analyze and provide statistics, KPIs, important KPIs for your business customers.
 And so being able to monitor Business Chat conversations by agent and provide important statistics and KPIs, like the average response time for Business Chat for agents, as well as perhaps for commerce type transactions in Business Chat, the percentage conversion rates, all about trying to figure out how to increase their productivity and increase my level of customer satisfaction.
 So your platform needs to support this type of analytics.
 So once again four key areas that we look for when we think about what qualifies as a great customer service platform provider for Business Chat.
 Okay now that you've been approved there's a couple of key things that we're going to ask you to do, one is to invest time in training your sales and systems engineers.
 So we've created three modules that we walk you through, all of your sales and system engineers wherever they are around the world about general business with working with Apple, about implementation and lots of details that we go into here technically.
 And then lastly, about how to design great user experiences and how to properly set yourself up for a great marketing launch.
 And then lastly, you need to get ready and help your customers get ready when it comes to integrating great consumer brand customers and all of their interactions.
 And so there's a couple of key things that we want to highlight here that we've learned.
 Number one, believe it or not once you become an approved CSP platform you need to make sure you let all your customers know that you are and more importantly, you need to get them to come and register at registered.
apple.
com and make sure that they're selecting you in the drop-down menu and notifying you when they have done that so that the two of you can actually start working together right from the start.
 Second of all, in parallel you should be already starting to integrate to the Business Chat API, starting an Apple Business Register and then continuing to test all of the payloads across the networks to get ready for helping your customers get ready to launch.
 And then lastly, you need to start to develop and implement some great use cases for your customers and help them get to the point where they're really ready to actually launch Business Chat.
 Okay and then sorry one more point, you do need to notify us when you and your customer or customers are ready for a launch so that we can do a public launch review, a final QA before we turn you on and publicly launch.
 So again, these are a couple of key qualifiers and some important steps of investment that you need to make as a potential CSP around the world for Business Chat.
 So let's talk about the consumer brand, some points about how to get ready, steps to get ready for launching Business Chat as a consumer brand.
 Number one, the one thing we learned is that Business Chat is an asynchronous, more asynchronous like communication method is a little different from synchronous and so just to make sure that everyone understands what that means I'll illustrate with a quick example between Hilton and Marriott, a couple of our partners.
 I may start a conversation with the hotel brand looking for a common use case like loyalty points.
 And I may start that and have a very synchronous communication back and forth on a Wednesday, but then I get distracted, I'm doing other things so a couple days go by before I come back.
 This becomes more asynchronous now in nature, but because of the long-lived sessions of Business Chat and because of the stable identifier about me and because I previously identified who I am a new agent that picks back up in this conversation should pick back up right where we left off, it's not about starting over.
 So it's a different etiquette and so we've come up with some great guidelines and some help in documents to help get your agents properly trained to be able to manage these types of conversations differently say from what they may be used to in live webchat synchronously.
 You also need to adjust your KPIs for measuring synchronous versus asynchronous communications.
 Okay let's talk about integrating Business Chat entry points.
 So as you probably remember with Business Chat only users can initiate a conversation and therefore it's even more important to make sure it's very easy to discover ways in which to start a Business Chat conversation.
 So there's two key groups that I'm going to talk about, there's Apple native entry points and then there are your entry points as a consumer brand.
 Starting with Apple's native entry points.
 So when we announced the public release of Business Chat Beta in March we also announced the native release of being able to search for brands in Siri, in Search, in Safari and in Maps.
 And we made this very simple so that you can go into Business Chat, your Business Chat account in Apple Business Register and set up and configure these entry points for your business.
 And in case you haven't experienced this again here's a quick example where I would start a search again on iOS on the home screen with a simple swipe down, I would type in Discover the brand, I get the search result, the business search result for Discover, I tap on the Business Chat button and boom I'm right into my conversation.
 Very easy, three steps.
 Or coming back to the same search result I may tap on the left side of the search result and that opens up what we call the full preview of the business card, which has a lot of important information that again as a consumer brand you set up in your Business Chat account in Apple Business Register, such as what to expect from your agents or your automation with response time to messages or your live agents' hours of operations dependent on where they are.
 So these are all things that you can set up in your account and configure and update as required in your Business Chat account.
 So again, really important to be taking advantage and setting up all of these and getting ready to launch in your Business Chat account in Apple Business Register.
 But these are not as important as your entry points and so by your entry points we mean these are the places in which your customers are most commonly engaging with you, it's your content, it's your various properties, whether it's websites or apps.
 This is where your touch points are most valuable.
 And so we've created the Business Chat button which is an API driven way to embed and initiate an entry point for Business Chat and it has a unique URL embedded in it for your business ID.
 So let's look at some examples.
 This is an example of how TD Ameritrade has implemented the Business Chat button in their mobile website.
 And so contextually they look for opportunities where there's the highest level of engagement, where their customers typically or prospects start to figure out okay I want to do something but I'm not sure exactly what to do.
 And so they place the Business Chat button there and it's getting tremendous results because then I can simply tap on it in this contextual call to action to talk to a TD Ameritrade advisor and immediately start a conversation with them.
 It's fantastic.
 All right, so now let's look at an example of an in-app placement of a Business Chat button.
 1-800-Flowers in their app have the Business Chat button placed in a number of really important areas again, but I may have started a conversation with 1-800-Flowers a while ago and because of my tray and because I communicate with so many different people that conversation may have been pushed way down in my message tray.
 So in fact you know I'm getting old, I may have forgotten that I actually had this conversation.
 So I may have started a conversation, looking for an opportunity to buy flowers in the 1-800-Flowers app and I spot the Business Chat button and then it comes back to me.
 Oh my goodness all I have to do is tap on that button and once again it will bring back all the previous conversation because of its long-lived capabilities and I'm already identified, the agent welcomes me back and I can right away get into a productive conversation to order a new set of flowers for my wife which are probably way overdue at this point.
 All right, so let's talk about phone calls.
 There's a huge opportunity that we're discovering with many brands to be able to start to deflect inbound phone calls to your 1-800 contact centers.
 Massive potential here for cost savings and higher levels of productivity.
 And so the idea is at the top of your IV or your call tree with whatever options you're offering in terms of getting into a queue for a live agent you offer an option to be able to have an SMS text message sent to you if you want to start a conversation in Apple's Messages app.
 And that SMS text message would have an embedded link that all they have to do again is tap on it and it opens up the Business Chat conversation right in their Messages app.
 Again, huge potential opportunity to be deflecting a significant amount of inbound costly phone calls to a high productive channel like Business Chat.
 Okay brand email.
 So again very targeted because you obviously have to target this to specific Apple device users that most brands track and know who they are.
 But a great opportunity where 1-800-Flowers is knocking it out of the park being able to target these emails, offer promotions, remind them of an easy checkout benefit with Apple Pay and again select that button, tap on it and away you go, you're into a conversation.
 Last key example I'm going to touch on is QR codes.
 And so there's lots of opportunities that we're starting to see pop up where brands are using QR codes in storefront windows to capture attention, they're using them at the checkout lanes, and they're also using them at check-in at hotels.
 But this is a great example where T-Mobile is in fact exploring the opportunity to create a post-sale relationship by offering at the end of a conversation in-store on the ID badge of their in-store advisors the opportunity to start a conversation right there by simply holding up your iPhone with the built-in capabilities of the camera to read the QR code and start a conversation even before you leave the store.
 Great way to again personalize that journey with your customers.
 All right, so super important that is part of getting ready for a launch that you've thought through and found the most valuable engagement touch points with your customers and embedded the Business Chat button as you launch.
 So next key step, two more things.
 One, preparing your logos because they are well displayed throughout the Business Chat experience and so you have your square logo and you have your wide logo.
 And so as a reminder in case you haven't seen this, the square logo shows up in a search result, the square logo shows up on your actual full business card, it shows up in the message tray so it easily, you know you can scan easily and look for the brand that you were communicating with.
 And then lastly, the wide logo always the optimal choice to be showing it at the top of every business conversation to reinforce your brand.
 And it's easy to set up in your Business Chat account once again by simply going into your account, tapping on the Brand button, uploading your square and wide logos and selecting your background color.
 Last key point, begin your app planning early and by that we mean as you develop your Business Chat team make sure you're pulling in the app team at the same time.
 The combined collaboration of your two groups will deliver a much more powerful result with Business Chat user experiences, largely because of the opportunity to take advantage of iMessage apps as part of that.
 And so to that point, let's start talking about the brand developer and Scottie is going to join me back up on stage to walk us through that and other great app development tools to take advantage of for the best Business Chat user experiences.
 Scottie.
  Thanks Dan.
 So today I'm going to talk to you about working with Business Chat from the perspective of a brand developer.
 Now what do we mean by brand developer.
 It's not a developer with a bunch of labels all over their clothes.
 Really what it is is we see brand developers being in one of three categories.
 The first category is maybe you're working with a CSP, a customer service platform, and you're working to deliver custom iMessage extensions in-app experiences for all of the businesses that they work with.
 The second group is maybe you're a developer working with a specific brand, a specific company that's signed up to work with Business Chat and you have some great ideas of how you can make iMessage apps tie into the transcript to make a great experience for the customers.
 The third group we see as maybe you're not working with anyone at all, but you have some really great ideas of how Business Chat can come alive with some custom iMessage apps.
 In the past week we've heard from a number of you and there's really some exciting opportunities here for some great experiences that can potentially be sold to customer service platforms or brands.
 We've also heard from a lot of you from all the three categories over the last year and I want to thank you for contacting us because we see some real great potential and some great user experiences that will come into Business Chat soon, so thank you.
 Let's start talking about if you even need an app at all.
 So building custom iMessage apps for Business Chat is great, but we have some built-in functionality already in every iOS.
 So these are the List Picker, the Time Picker, and Apple Pay.
 I went through these last year in detail, but this year with iOS 12 we heard your feedback and we're adding one of the most requested features which is Authentication new in iOS 12.
 Great.
 So let me go through these now.
 First, we have List Picker.
 List Picker allows your business to send down a list of products grouped in sections, each section can have a number of different products and new in iOS 11.
3 and above we allow your business to specify if a section should be a multiple selection or a single selection.
 Now this is great for some experiences, such as like trying to order a pizza where maybe the crust is only, you can only have one crust on your pizza, one crust type, but the toppings you'd want to offer a range of toppings the user can select from.
 So we allow that section to be have a multiple selection, so that's new in iOS 11.
3.
 Next, we have the Time Picker.
 The Time Picker allows your business to send a number of preselected dates and times to allow your user to select.
 These also -- the Time Picker also ties into your local calendar store and will feature certain conflicts that you may have conflicting with the time selected.
 Once you've selected a time and you've sent this back to the business you can easily then add the appointment to your own calendar and even get directions to the event if the company specifies a location.
 Next, we have Apple Pay.
 There's those high heels again.
 Apple Pay allows your business to quickly and easily send the payment request to your customer.
 The customer all they need to do is tap that bubble, up comes an Apple Pay sheet, they can quickly Face ID, Touch ID and right within Messages quickly pay your business.
 It really wouldn't be Business Chat without Apple Pay.
 Now new in iOS 12 we have the Authentication plug-in.
 This allows your business quickly to allow you to log in and then get great customer information from your login.
 So let me go through that a little bit more right now.
 It starts off in a conversation when you get to that point where maybe you need to get a little bit more details from the customer that would be provided by their account.
 Now as you see here, the customer service agent will send down an authentication request.
 Their user can tap that to sign in, up comes a sheet.
 This sheet contains a link, basically it's displaying the business' OAuth website directly in the Authentication plug-in.
 The user can then tap in to one of the fields and they can simply enter in their username and password if they have it remembered or they can tap the Password Lock icon which will bring up a sheet of all the saved passwords currently already in your keychain.
 The domain matched to the one that is provided will be bubbled to the top, you can then select that.
 The fields that we filled out.
 And once you log in you can basically get a response to the business verifying that they're logged in.
 So that's great, but how does this all work? So let me go through that now.
 As I mentioned, it starts off with the CSP agent sending an authentication request.
 This includes two pieces of really important information, the first is a public key.
 This public key is going to be later used to encrypt the token that you received from the authentication request.
 It also includes the URL of where the OAuth webpage lives and we'll go through that a little bit more in a minute.
 So this is where it starts, the authentication request comes down and it passes through, stop on the way at Apple Business Chat Server.
 Now why do we do this? This we added and we did a lot of thinking about this about adding security.
 We want to make sure that your business has authenticated user to the proper OAuth website.
 And for that we make sure it's the proper information that you've already as a business registered through Apple Register previously.
 We verify also that the request contains all the required fields.
 And then finally we deliver it in your Messages app for the customer.
 From there as I showed you can either type in the password manually or access the system keychain to pull out any stored credentials that you may have.
 From here the next step is we go directly to your business server to hit the OAuth website.
 Now this can be existing or potentially a little bit change for Business Chat but it allows you to carry the user through your standard login flow, including any extra additional information, extra verification fields, anything along those lines.
 At the end of OAuth your OAuth returns a token, this is your login token and there it's sent back to the Messages app.
 What we do next is we encrypt that token so no one else can see it with a public key that I mentioned earlier that's included in the request.
 Now your token is encrypted and it passes back up through the Apple Chat Server which Apple can't read and it lands back to the agent.
 Now at this time your agent may have the private key to decrypt that or your business may have that private key depending on the relationship and the security that you've worked out.
 We think a lot of people will actually want to send this encrypted token back to the business to verify and decrypt to make sure that this is in fact the person who has just recently logged in and once you've decrypted it you can use that to get all the important customer information sent back to the agent to help service your account, such as your shoe size or other order information.
 So that's Authentication in iOS 12.
 We think a lot of companies, especially in healthcare and financial services will really like this.
 And that's what we have for built-in features, so you don't have to write a single line of code you can take advantage of these by integrating with your CSPs and your businesses today.
 So next, you may want to take this further and as I mentioned we heard a lot of great examples of how this can be done and some really great innovative ways.
 So today I'm going to talk for your features how you can leverage native iOS functionality, some tips about making your iMessage apps a shared app architecture, and talk a little bit about how to make that experience great.
 So remember with iMessage apps you can really take advantage of full native iOS frameworks and code throughout the system, such as a front facing camera.
 Wouldn't it be great if you could try out, have your users send pictures of them using your products, testing your products or even seeing what kind of situation they are working with to help give better customer support? This is a whole new level of interaction that you can have with your customers by actually seeing what they're experiencing.
 Remember we have MapKit allowing your iMessage app to display a map and then the business can send down things such as places that your business may be operating in in a certain region.
 Or even providing information such as drawing custom overlays on the map to designate maybe coverage areas or delivery zones.
 Taking advantage of ARKit provides a really a whole new level of interaction where customers right from Business Chat could try out seeing what products may look like in their natural environment right from within Business Chat.
 We think these are some really powerful examples of using your own custom iMessage app.
 So by now you've probably determined you want to do a custom app, here's some things you can do to get ready for Business Chat.
 First, we'll start by talking about what it means to have and leverage a shared app architecture.
 So your business, your brand may already have a full-fledged iOS app and when you're working on your iMessage app as an extension to that there's certain things you can do to really speed up that development.
 Your main app may have several business logic classes, a whole bunch of utility classes, even custom views and view controllers that you could easily reuse in your iMessage app.
 All you have to do is add an iMessage app target and then check off those classes so they're provided, also available in your iMessage app.
 Now sometimes code is not the cleanest and by checking one class you may have to pull a whole bunch of other classes that that represents so that's not always the best way to go about it and we think this is a great opportunity where if your classes aren't fully encapsulated it's a great time for you to potentially refactor to get your specific business logic into its own kind of encapsulated place for much better code in the future.
 So that's shared core resources, really you know adding your iMessage app target to your project, checking off a few classes, you can get really far really quickly.
 Next, we have a shared filesystem between your app and your iMessage app.
 And with that if your main app has already downloaded of images or files or anything important that your app needs to do you can reference them from your iMessage app in Business Chat without having to redownload those and provides a much better customer experience.
 You can also go the other way and save things from your iMessage app back to the app so then when you launch back to the app that information is readily available.
 Now that's great for files that are not really sensitive or need to be secured, but if you have those needs the system keychain is also shared.
 So if you were writing down potentially even login credentials or tokens from a previous login in the app you can quickly make use of those in your iMessage app and have those speed up your login process when using Business Chat.
 Even provide you know customer data right when launching the iMessage app.
 Keep in mind, you can always go from the iMessage app to your main app.
 So let's say you're in a Business Chat conversation and the user is navigating through your iMessage app and there's something that maybe your full app would be a better experience for you can provide a link, as well as a deep link.
 So you can go directly from the iMessage app directly to the full app right into the place or maybe the product or the information that they were looking for with just one tap.
 And keep in mind that once you make these iMessage apps not all your customers will have that preinstalled on their device right then or all their devices.
 So if you run across this scenario as we showed last year as well a user just has to tap the bubble, up comes an App Store sheet where they can quickly and easily download the app and continue right there in the iMessage conversation having now downloaded that app and iMessage app to your device.
 So that's covering some great ways that you can take advantage of the shared app architecture, a lot of the code and scenarios that you've already built with your main app.
 Next, let's talk about the Chat with Messages button API.
 As Dan showed, this is a great new API that allows your apps to leverage this standard Apple button now in iOS 11.
3 and above.
 There's two ways to use this, we have the BC Chat button in the Business Chat framework which you can use in your iOS apps and there's a JavaScript version for websites that'll be made available to you as you sign up through Apple Business Register.
 Today I'll show you some code examples of how to use the BC chat button in your iOS apps.
 So here we have an example showing the first step I just have to import the Business Chat framework which is on the SDK.
 Then I can go ahead and instantiate a button of the BC chat button and we allow you to pass in some style information depending on the look and feel of your app, it may look better with a light style or a dark style.
 Then this is a standard button so I'm going to add a target.
 And what you'll note here is this is available on iOS and macOS.
 So if you're making Mac apps or iOS apps you can take advantage of this with even a shared code to have this available across your platforms.
 Once I've configured the what's going to happen when I tap the button I can go ahead and add this button to my views and configure constraints and all the things to make the button look great.
 Now that's putting the button in the app.
 So what happens when the user taps the button? Well from here as Dan mentioned in his example he is showing an address getting passed through.
 In my example I'm showing here that you can programmatically define an intent.
 Maybe the user is browsing through your app and has landed on a certain shoe product.
 You could tack on the product information so right when the Business Chat conversation comes alive the customer service agent already knows the product that you're referring to.
 The group allows you to specify potentially where to route on the backend this conversation, things like support or maybe sales would be appropriate or other as Dan showed, other regional based kind of specifications.
 And then you can also even specify some default text that when the user lands on the message conversation will be automatically filled in on the text field so all the user has to do is hit Send.
 Great, so now I've configured these parameters and the next step I do is I call the BCChatAction to open the transcript and provide the business identifier which is provided to you upon acceptance into Business Chat through the register.
 I also send in the parameters so they are taken up and sent.
 At the end of the day once the user taps that button they're switched directly to Messages into the conversation directly with that business.
 And the information with intent and group are provided automatically.
 So that's Chat with Message button API.
 Next, I'm going to talk about Sandbox testing.
 Last year at WWDC we introduced the Business Chat Sandbox.
 Here's the URL and last year I even gave a demo of how this works and how you can make use of this for your testing.
 Here's a screenshot of the design and what you see here is we have tabs across the top letting you try out all the experiences of Business Chat right from kind of pretending to be a fake CSP or business.
 Every one of you can log in and do this today, you don't need any approvals.
 You basically can log in and get started sending sample text messages and instantiating all of the different built-in functionality.
 As we showed last year you can even test out your own custom iMessage apps by using the My App tab.
 And new this year for iOS 12 we've added the Auth tab where you can try out and play with the new with the new Auth functionality, including a sample OAuth provided webpage through the Business Chat Sandbox which is great.
 Or if you have your own OAuth website already you could override that and enter your own so you can try it out and see if it works with your business setup.
 So the Sandbox really allows you to kind of see and feel this and we really encourage you to use this because you'll kind of, you'll see the use case and you'll feel how the use cases interact.
 We also think it's a great way to demo this to maybe decision-makers in your business so they can make a great, kind to fine-tune those experiences before you go live.
 So I can't stress enough how valuable this Business Chat Sandbox can be.
 And finally let's cover some best practices.
 So as I covered, start with the Sandbox, really see how these experiences will look and feel, try it out with some people.
 You can have your you know laptop set up with Sandbox on one side and have someone on the other side with the device trying this interaction out.
 Really valuable to kind of see and feel how to build these first-class customer experiences.
 Then think about enhancing your app and adding a messages app to that to really take that experience even further.
 Now I have a separate bullet point about customizing that user experience specifically because we want to make sure that you understand that iMessage apps are not the full apps.
 They are specifically designed for quick interactions that'll add value and not be too daunting for someone who is in a conversation who just wants to get stuff done with Business Chat.
 For that we recommend really taking a look at all the things you've done in the app and what's appropriate in iMessage apps, but also to custom tailor it so they kind of fit and flow into the user experience you're looking for.
 This is also a great way to really stand out in Business Chat and in your customer service experiences.
 Then as I mentioned, integrate with your message API button, BC chat button and add it to your apps, into your websites and your emails.
 So that's some best practices, that's what we would like you to know about getting started as a brand developer.
 And now I'm going to hand it back to Dan to finish this up.
 Well done buddy.
 Thanks Scottie, that was great.
 And it's super exciting about finally being able to launch the OAuth authentication built-in feature.
 That is going to be huge because we have a ton of demand coming at us for that type of a built-in functionality, so that's very exciting.
 All right, some key things.
 First of all, we've covered a lot of highlights today but there's a lot of great documentation and information available to you at this link.
 And so, please make note of it, if you haven't it now you'll be able to afterwards in the video.
 But it will take you to lots of different documentation that will cover many of the things we've talked about would but be able to drill down much deeper than that into our getting started guides and best practices, again being able to get right into understanding how to use Business Register, the Sandbox which is critical of course, and even last year's video which we'd recommend you revisit to just get again a good primer.
 And so I'm going to leave you with this one important thought that once again today for the first time we're going to open the door significantly wider to medium to large consumer brands around the world and new qualified CSPs that can support those medium to large consumer brands.
 And so just as a reminder, if you feel you're a qualified CSP, please come right away to Apple Business Register and qualify by registering and providing us your information and we'll move you through a very rapid process now.
 So we're speeding up the approval process in Apple Business Register.
 If you're a consumer brand, please again make sure you come register, make sure you notify and pick your CSP and then notify your CSP that you've selected them so you can start working together rapidly and start integrating.
 And then lastly, if you're a brand developer once again start the planning process early, use the Sandbox to start prototyping the new OAuth authentication built-in feature and all the built-in features.
 It will immediately help you accelerate the ability to get to a Business Chat launch faster.
 And of course take advantage of the opportunity to start developing your iMessage app as part of the Business Chat experience.
 On behalf of Scottie and I thank you very much for your time today and we'll leave you this one last message that please go start getting ready now to launch Business Chat.
 Thank you very much, have a great afternoon.
