[ Applause ]

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:27.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:29.246 A:middle
My name's Paul Salzman, and my

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:30.636 A:middle
friend Josh Ford and I are very

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
excited to talk to you today

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
about servicing your Siri

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.276 A:middle
shortcuts on the Siri watch

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:34.626 A:middle
face.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:37.556 A:middle
Last year, we released the Siri

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.276 A:middle
watch face, which has glanceable

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.486 A:middle
information and tappable

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:41.686 A:middle
actions, sorted by their

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.056 A:middle
relevance to the user, at every

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:43.516 A:middle
wrist raise.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.786 A:middle
That means our users have access

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:47.326 A:middle
to dynamically updated content,

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:48.646 A:middle
relevant to them throughout the

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:50.006 A:middle
day without any configuration

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:50.436 A:middle
required.

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.046 A:middle
And now, in watchOS 5, we are

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.466 A:middle
very excited to add your

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.936 A:middle
applications as data sources to

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:56.766 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.666 A:middle
The shortcuts you provide will

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
show up on the watch face, on

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
show up on the watch face, on

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.376 A:middle
these items that we call

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:01.876 A:middle
platters.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.436 A:middle
When the user taps on one of

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:04.825 A:middle
these platters, the underlying

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:05.916 A:middle
shortcut will be executed.

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:07.486 A:middle
That can do something like

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:09.036 A:middle
launching into your application

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:12.246 A:middle
into a specific context, or if

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:13.006 A:middle
your shortcut supports

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.216 A:middle
background execution, we can run

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.566 A:middle
that inline on the watch face.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:18.396 A:middle
That means users can take

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:19.496 A:middle
advantage of your application's

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.806 A:middle
functionality without leaving

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:21.446 A:middle
their watch face.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:23.146 A:middle
So, let's take a look at what

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.276 A:middle
we're going to talk about today.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:25.686 A:middle
We're going to start off by

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.066 A:middle
going over how content appears

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:27.926 A:middle
on the Siri watch face.

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:30.366 A:middle
After that, we'll talk about the

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.056 A:middle
Relevant Shortcut API, which is

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:33.266 A:middle
the API you use to provide

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.486 A:middle
content to the Siri watch face.

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:37.166 A:middle
We'll also go over how you can

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.636 A:middle
use this API within your iOS

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.926 A:middle
application to provide content

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:40.756 A:middle
to the Siri watch face.

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:42.416 A:middle
And then, I'm going to hand

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:43.896 A:middle
things over to Josh, who'll talk

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:45.536 A:middle
about our prediction engine, as

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:46.866 A:middle
well as give you insight as to

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.346 A:middle
how best to use these API's for

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.066 A:middle
your application.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.536 A:middle
So, let's talk about how content

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:53.726 A:middle
appears on the Siri watch face.

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:56.116 A:middle
Everything on the Siri watch

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.716 A:middle
face is sorted by its relevance

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:58.206 A:middle
to the user.

00:01:58.836 --> 00:01:59.746 A:middle
The more relevant a piece of

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:01.306 A:middle
content is, the higher up on the

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:01.306 A:middle
content is, the higher up on the

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:02.386 A:middle
watch face it's going to appear.

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:04.196 A:middle
And, we calculate relevance by

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.936 A:middle
incorporating a number of inputs

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
across the system, like the

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.776 A:middle
current time of day, the user's

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.446 A:middle
location, their routine, and

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:11.546 A:middle
their engagement with a given

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:12.136 A:middle
data source.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.596 A:middle
You'll provide this content to

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:15.946 A:middle
us with a relevantShortcut,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.346 A:middle
which associates a shortcut with

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.576 A:middle
UI customization, and the

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:20.626 A:middle
ability to give us hints as to

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:21.786 A:middle
when to deploy your content.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.796 A:middle
Now, we will derive implicit

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:25.876 A:middle
relevance for the shortcuts you

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:27.426 A:middle
provide based off of your user's

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:28.556 A:middle
past interaction with the

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:29.106 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.036 A:middle
But, often you have much more

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.116 A:middle
insightful suggestions,

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:33.146 A:middle
especially when showing

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
glanceable information, or if

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:35.626 A:middle
you want to suggest a shortcut

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:36.836 A:middle
that hasn't yet been executed by

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:37.206 A:middle
a user.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.466 A:middle
So, you can provide us things

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.466 A:middle
called relevance providers.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:41.866 A:middle
And, just like a first-party

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:43.756 A:middle
data source, users can disable

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:46.036 A:middle
or re-enable your data source in

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:47.536 A:middle
the Siri face customization page

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.126 A:middle
in the iOS Watch app.

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:51.726 A:middle
Now, before we get too far into

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
adopting the Relevant Shortcut

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.276 A:middle
API, we want to make sure we're

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.146 A:middle
not contending with these

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:56.676 A:middle
relevance calculations when we

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.216 A:middle
see how our relevant shortcuts

00:02:58.396 --> 00:02:59.546 A:middle
behave and look on the watch

00:02:59.546 --> 00:02:59.916 A:middle
face.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.736 A:middle
So, while we're developing,

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:02.796 A:middle
we're going to want to go into

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.096 A:middle
the iOS Settings app, into the

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
Developer's page, and find the

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.456 A:middle
Shortcuts Testing section.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
In there, we can ensure that our

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.906 A:middle
most recently provided relevant

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:13.376 A:middle
shortcuts show up at the top of

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.216 A:middle
the watch face, by enabling the

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.626 A:middle
Show Recent Shortcuts option.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.616 A:middle
Additionally, as we get further

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:23.146 A:middle
into adopting this API in our

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:25.216 A:middle
iOS application, we can cause

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.666 A:middle
the periodic syncing of relevant

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.346 A:middle
shortcuts from the iOS device to

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
the watch to occur immediately

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:30.816 A:middle
by tapping the Force Sync

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:31.866 A:middle
Shortcuts to Watch button.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.616 A:middle
So, now let's talk about

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:36.426 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and at the

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.846 A:middle
core of a relevant shortcut, is

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:38.286 A:middle
a shortcut.

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:40.706 A:middle
Shortcuts encompass key

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
functionality, within your

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.116 A:middle
application, that you want to

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.226 A:middle
make more accessible to your

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:44.606 A:middle
users.

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:46.126 A:middle
And, they can access these

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.336 A:middle
shortcuts by saying key phrases

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.066 A:middle
into Siri, or tapping on various

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.476 A:middle
system UI.

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
And, in the case of watchOS,

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:52.376 A:middle
that's a platter on the Siri

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:53.606 A:middle
watch face.

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:55.626 A:middle
There's a lot of in-depth

00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:56.636 A:middle
discussion about how to make

00:03:56.686 --> 00:03:57.596 A:middle
great shortcuts this year.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:03:58.896 A:middle
And all will give a high-level

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
overview of how they work with a

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
overview of how they work with a

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:01.526 A:middle
watchOS persecutive.

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:02.946 A:middle
I highly recommend seeing the

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:04.246 A:middle
"Introduction to Siri Shortcuts"

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.716 A:middle
talk, and the "Building for

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
Voice with Siri Shortcuts" that

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:08.046 A:middle
happened earlier in the

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:08.626 A:middle
conference.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:11.646 A:middle
So, shortcuts can be made out of

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:12.506 A:middle
one of two things.

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:14.686 A:middle
An NSUserActivity, which

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:15.836 A:middle
represents a state within your

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:16.706 A:middle
application you want to

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.096 A:middle
accelerate users back into, or

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.796 A:middle
an intent, which can execute a

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.166 A:middle
task on your user's behalf.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:23.886 A:middle
Now, intents are really

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:24.876 A:middle
powerful, because they can

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:26.076 A:middle
support background execution,

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:27.676 A:middle
which means that users can take

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:28.866 A:middle
advantage of your functionality

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:29.956 A:middle
without having to launch your

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
app into the foreground.

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:32.696 A:middle
In fact, users can request

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:34.256 A:middle
background-capable intents that

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:35.226 A:middle
are available on their iPhone

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.266 A:middle
from their Apple watch or

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
HomePod.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.086 A:middle
And, our frameworks provide a

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:40.316 A:middle
lot of built-in intents you can

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:41.386 A:middle
take advantage of right now,

00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:43.236 A:middle
like sending a message, starting

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:44.606 A:middle
a workout, or requesting a ride.

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.916 A:middle
But, new in watchOS 5, and iOS

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.626 A:middle
12, you can make your own custom

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:49.666 A:middle
intents that have the

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.056 A:middle
functionality that your app does

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:51.426 A:middle
best.

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.836 A:middle
There's this awesome in-depth

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.616 A:middle
intents definition file and

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:56.736 A:middle
editor built into Xcode.

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:57.906 A:middle
And, I'll give you a couple of

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:58.886 A:middle
pointers related to relevant

00:04:58.886 --> 00:04:59.386 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
But, I highly recommend seeing

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
But, I highly recommend seeing

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:01.836 A:middle
those other talks for full

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:02.646 A:middle
details.

00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:04.766 A:middle
Now, let's go over a couple of

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:06.346 A:middle
examples of how shortcuts will

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:07.666 A:middle
execute when requested from a

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:09.316 A:middle
watch app.

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:12.016 A:middle
User generates their shortcut

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:13.806 A:middle
request by tapping on the Siri

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.056 A:middle
watch face, or by saying a key

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.996 A:middle
voice phrase to Siri, and the

00:05:16.996 --> 00:05:18.206 A:middle
watch receives that request.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:19.816 A:middle
It'll examine it and determine,

00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:20.836 A:middle
is there an application that's

00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:21.886 A:middle
installed that can handle the

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:22.336 A:middle
shortcut?

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:24.306 A:middle
And, in this example, yes, there

00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:25.226 A:middle
is one that's installed.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.116 A:middle
So, we're going to dispatch that

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:28.056 A:middle
shortcut to the appropriate

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:28.656 A:middle
application.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.086 A:middle
If your shortcut is implemented

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:32.346 A:middle
by an intent that can handle

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
background execution, the

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:35.856 A:middle
application's intent execution

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:36.876 A:middle
will run that shortcut.

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:38.606 A:middle
But, if instead your shortcut is

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:40.086 A:middle
built off of a NSUserActivity,

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:41.206 A:middle
or an intent that can't run in

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.616 A:middle
the background, the application

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:43.836 A:middle
itself will be launched to

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:44.546 A:middle
handle the shortcut.

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:46.936 A:middle
When the shortcut execution is

00:05:46.936 --> 00:05:48.006 A:middle
complete, a result will be

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:49.246 A:middle
generated, and then handed back

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:49.666 A:middle
to the user.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:51.746 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at

00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:52.396 A:middle
another example.

00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:54.556 A:middle
In this case our user taps on

00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:55.556 A:middle
the Siri watch face, or says a

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.056 A:middle
key phrase to Siri to generate

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.416 A:middle
the shortcut request.

00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
And, the watch will examine it.

00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
And, the watch will examine it.

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
And, in this case, it'll

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:02.626 A:middle
determine that there isn't an

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:03.766 A:middle
application that's installed

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
that can handle the shortcut.

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.556 A:middle
So, we'll check with the phone

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:07.816 A:middle
and see if it has an app that

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:08.576 A:middle
can handle the shortcut.

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:10.316 A:middle
And, in this case, yes there is.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.306 A:middle
So, we're going to forward that

00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:12.496 A:middle
request over to the phone.

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:14.216 A:middle
And, the proper application, or

00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
intents extension will handle

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:16.016 A:middle
execution.

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:18.536 A:middle
When execution is complete, a

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:19.676 A:middle
result will be generated on the

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:21.156 A:middle
phone, and forward back to the

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:22.336 A:middle
watch, and conveyed to the user.

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.806 A:middle
So, now that we understand the

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:26.946 A:middle
key concepts that make up a

00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:28.256 A:middle
shortcut, and how it'll execute

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.446 A:middle
on the watch, let's talk about

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.166 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, which take

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.456 A:middle
your shortcuts and show them on

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.376 A:middle
the watch face when they're most

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:33.696 A:middle
relevant.

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.466 A:middle
We can automatically populate

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.756 A:middle
the fields on the platters on

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:38.936 A:middle
the Siri watch face, based on

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:39.846 A:middle
your shortcut content.

00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:41.706 A:middle
But, you can also customize the

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
platter's display, which is

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:43.846 A:middle
really useful for displaying

00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:44.816 A:middle
glanceable information.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.756 A:middle
And, of course when your platter

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:48.666 A:middle
is tapped, the underlying

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:49.706 A:middle
shortcut will be executed.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:51.106 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how

00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:52.186 A:middle
this will run on this watch

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:52.476 A:middle
face.

00:06:53.006 --> 00:06:54.976 A:middle
If your shortcut is backed by a

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.226 A:middle
user activity, when the user

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:57.916 A:middle
taps on it, your app will be

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
launched into the appropriate

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
launched into the appropriate

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
context.

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:03.756 A:middle
If instead, your app is-- or,

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.886 A:middle
your shortcut is based off of

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:06.316 A:middle
intents, when the user taps on

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:07.476 A:middle
the platter, we'll see this

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
intent confirmation view.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:10.556 A:middle
And, if they tap to confirm it,

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:11.906 A:middle
if your intent runs at the

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:13.106 A:middle
background, we'll execute it

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
inline.

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:15.906 A:middle
If instead your intent can't run

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:16.976 A:middle
in the background, we'll launch

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:18.166 A:middle
your application, and hand you

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.156 A:middle
the intent to continue

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:19.716 A:middle
execution.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:22.556 A:middle
So, let's look at the API for

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
Relevant Shortcuts.

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:25.146 A:middle
At the core of a relevant

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
shortcut, of course, is a

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:26.396 A:middle
shortcut.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
If you want to give us hints as

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:29.086 A:middle
to when this content is

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.166 A:middle
relevant, you can provide us

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.256 A:middle
relevanceProviders, which we'll

00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:31.806 A:middle
go over soon.

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:34.186 A:middle
And, if you want to customize

00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:36.216 A:middle
the UI beyond what your shortcut

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:37.916 A:middle
will provide, you can give us a

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.196 A:middle
defaultCardTemplate on the

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.106 A:middle
watchTemplate property.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.246 A:middle
Now, once you're done creating

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:44.166 A:middle
all of your wonderful relevant

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.146 A:middle
shortcuts, you need to let us

00:07:45.146 --> 00:07:45.676 A:middle
know about them.

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:46.886 A:middle
So, you want to inform the

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.186 A:middle
default relevantShortcutStore.

00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:49.696 A:middle
And, the way you do that is

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:50.576 A:middle
providing an array.

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:52.066 A:middle
And, every time you give us an

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.286 A:middle
array, it'll erase the previous

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:54.596 A:middle
contents we had in our shortcut

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:55.946 A:middle
store, which is really useful

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.246 A:middle
for invalidating stale relevant

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:57.786 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:58.846 A:middle
But, you just need to keep in

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.406 A:middle
mind to provide us all of the

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.406 A:middle
mind to provide us all of the

00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:01.616 A:middle
relevant shortcuts we should be

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:02.136 A:middle
considering.

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:05.116 A:middle
So, let's look at how your

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:05.946 A:middle
content will display on the

00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:06.266 A:middle
platter.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.296 A:middle
You can see on the top left,

00:08:08.296 --> 00:08:09.436 A:middle
your application's icon will be

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:10.356 A:middle
displayed, followed by your

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:10.836 A:middle
app's name.

00:08:11.536 --> 00:08:12.816 A:middle
Below that is a required title

00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:14.346 A:middle
string, and below that is an

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:15.746 A:middle
optional subtitle string, that

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.026 A:middle
you can use for more context.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:18.556 A:middle
We'll display that in italics.

00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:20.166 A:middle
To the left of both of these

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.746 A:middle
strings is an optional custom

00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:22.106 A:middle
image.

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:23.486 A:middle
This image supports

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:24.836 A:middle
transparency, and automatically

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:25.916 A:middle
applies rounded corners.

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:27.696 A:middle
You can see more about the

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:28.886 A:middle
dimensions of these assets by

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:30.186 A:middle
looking at the human interface

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.196 A:middle
guidelines resources for

00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:31.756 A:middle
watchOS.

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:33.716 A:middle
Now, as I mentioned, we can

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:35.096 A:middle
automatically populate all these

00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:35.966 A:middle
fields based off of the

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:36.796 A:middle
shortcuts you supply.

00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:39.346 A:middle
In the case of a custom intent,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.426 A:middle
every parameter combination you

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:43.265 A:middle
supply has an associated title

00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:44.246 A:middle
and subtitle we can use.

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.556 A:middle
And, as you create your intents

00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:48.196 A:middle
in code to generate a shortcut,

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.076 A:middle
you can set an image for any of

00:08:50.076 --> 00:08:50.766 A:middle
the parameters.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.606 A:middle
We will choose an image for the

00:08:52.606 --> 00:08:54.266 A:middle
custom image, based off of what

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:55.536 A:middle
is available on the most

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:56.436 A:middle
specific parameter.

00:08:57.326 --> 00:08:58.346 A:middle
And, the specificity of a

00:08:58.346 --> 00:08:59.356 A:middle
parameter is defined by the

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:00.706 A:middle
order of parameters you have

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:00.706 A:middle
order of parameters you have

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:01.576 A:middle
listed in your intents

00:09:01.576 --> 00:09:02.256 A:middle
definition file.

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:05.106 A:middle
In the case of an

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:06.906 A:middle
NSUserActivity, when you're

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:07.926 A:middle
creating your userActivity to

00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:09.536 A:middle
make a shortcut, you'll supply

00:09:09.536 --> 00:09:10.896 A:middle
it-- userActivity type that

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:11.776 A:middle
you've listed in your app's

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:12.776 A:middle
info.plist.

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:13.986 A:middle
And, for us to be able to

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.076 A:middle
display it without a default

00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:16.116 A:middle
card template, you'll need to

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:17.176 A:middle
give us a title on the title

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:17.596 A:middle
property.

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.486 A:middle
In iOS you can also supply a

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:22.526 A:middle
subtitle and a custom image by

00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:22.896 A:middle
creating a

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.066 A:middle
CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:27.336 A:middle
And, on that attribute set,

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
we'll extract a subtitle from

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:29.456 A:middle
the content description

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:31.146 A:middle
property, and the custom image

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:32.306 A:middle
from the thumbnailData property.

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:34.426 A:middle
When you're done configuring

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:35.926 A:middle
this attribute set, set on your

00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:36.926 A:middle
NSUserActivity's

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
contentAttributeSet property.

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:42.216 A:middle
If you don't want to give us the

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.856 A:middle
content that's baked into your

00:09:43.856 --> 00:09:44.846 A:middle
shortcut, you can supply a

00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:46.306 A:middle
default card template, which has

00:09:46.306 --> 00:09:47.156 A:middle
properties for each of the

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:48.066 A:middle
fields on this platter.

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.376 A:middle
And, depending on what we have

00:09:49.376 --> 00:09:51.106 A:middle
available to us, we will display

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:51.796 A:middle
a different layout.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:53.296 A:middle
You can see in the right two

00:09:53.296 --> 00:09:54.746 A:middle
configurations, that if no image

00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:55.796 A:middle
is provided, we'll lay out the

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.296 A:middle
text further to the left, giving

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.696 A:middle
you more space for your words.

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.836 A:middle
In the bottom two cases, if

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.836 A:middle
In the bottom two cases, if

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
there's no subtitle, we'll allow

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.206 A:middle
the title string to wrap from

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.330 A:middle
the top line to the bottom line.

00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:08.796 A:middle
If your shortcut is based on an

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.246 A:middle
intent, when a user taps on it,

00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:11.146 A:middle
they'll see this intent

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:11.906 A:middle
confirmation view.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:13.546 A:middle
In the top left is your

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.736 A:middle
application's icon, which is a

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
bit bigger this time, followed

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:16.666 A:middle
by your app's name.

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:18.416 A:middle
Below that we'll display the

00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:19.936 A:middle
title and subtitle directly from

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.026 A:middle
your intents definition file.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
And, at this point, the user has

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:23.516 A:middle
three options.

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.286 A:middle
If they want to run your intent,

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:26.716 A:middle
they can click Confirm in that

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:27.566 A:middle
middle pink button.

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:28.996 A:middle
If they don't want to run it,

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:30.406 A:middle
they can tap dismiss or the

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
digital crown.

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.596 A:middle
And then, the third option is a

00:10:32.596 --> 00:10:33.266 A:middle
bit more subtle.

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.486 A:middle
Sometimes users see an intent,

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:37.076 A:middle
realize they want to tweak some

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:37.886 A:middle
of the parameters.

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.426 A:middle
So, they can tap that top

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:41.926 A:middle
module, and we'll launch into

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:43.276 A:middle
your application, and hand you

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.486 A:middle
the intent you've customized.

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.146 A:middle
So, you can present some UI to

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.376 A:middle
allow your users to tweak some

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:48.376 A:middle
of the parameters before

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:49.356 A:middle
continuing execution.

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:51.616 A:middle
Now, let's talk about that

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:53.166 A:middle
middle pink Confirm button a

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:55.186 A:middle
little bit more.

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:56.306 A:middle
The string we show there, where

00:10:56.306 --> 00:10:57.806 A:middle
it says Action Verb, is derived

00:10:57.806 --> 00:10:58.976 A:middle
based off of the category of

00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:00.346 A:middle
intent you've defined in your

00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:00.346 A:middle
intent you've defined in your

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:01.296 A:middle
intents definition file.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.336 A:middle
Additionally, that color is

00:11:04.336 --> 00:11:05.706 A:middle
chosen from your application's

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:07.266 A:middle
global tint color in your watch

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.056 A:middle
app storyboard.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.886 A:middle
Now, it's very important to keep

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:11.946 A:middle
in mind that the intents that

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:13.226 A:middle
you support in your watch app

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:14.816 A:middle
must be a subset of the intents

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:15.686 A:middle
you support in your iOS

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:16.206 A:middle
application.

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:17.406 A:middle
That means you're going to be

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:19.066 A:middle
sharing the same title strings,

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.196 A:middle
and subtitle strings on iOS and

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:21.836 A:middle
watchOS.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:23.356 A:middle
And, watchOS is a very

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:24.316 A:middle
constrained canvas.

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:25.446 A:middle
Every word counts.

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.426 A:middle
So, we highly recommend using

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:28.776 A:middle
string dictionaries, with the

00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:30.666 A:middle
NSStringVariableWidthRuleType

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:30.956 A:middle
key.

00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:32.636 A:middle
That allows you to give us a

00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:34.356 A:middle
list of varying sizes of strings

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:35.296 A:middle
that we can choose from,

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.456 A:middle
depending on the context we're

00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
displaying them in.

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.496 A:middle
When providing content to

00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:41.876 A:middle
watchOS, we recommend supplying

00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:43.776 A:middle
a string with a width rule of 20

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:45.616 A:middle
for a 38 millimeter watch.

00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:47.506 A:middle
And, a width rule of 24 for a 42

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.106 A:middle
millimeter watch.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:51.266 A:middle
To get more information on

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:53.216 A:middle
adopting this API, please see

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:54.476 A:middle
the "Localizing with Xcode 9"

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:55.166 A:middle
talk from last year's

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:55.706 A:middle
conference.

00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:58.726 A:middle
So now, let's talk about

00:11:58.726 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
relevance providers.

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:02.676 A:middle
Relevance providers are your way

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:04.146 A:middle
to give us a hint as to when we

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:05.116 A:middle
should show your content.

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:07.366 A:middle
They really let us know how we

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:08.686 A:middle
should incorporate inputs like

00:12:08.716 --> 00:12:09.966 A:middle
the time of day, the user's

00:12:09.966 --> 00:12:11.536 A:middle
location, or their routine, when

00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:12.506 A:middle
calculating relevance.

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:14.166 A:middle
And, in fact, you can give more

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.366 A:middle
than one relevance provider on a

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:16.266 A:middle
given relevance shortcut.

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:17.526 A:middle
And, we're going to take the

00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:18.686 A:middle
inner section of their output.

00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:20.076 A:middle
So, if you give us a relevance

00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:21.286 A:middle
provider that says a certain

00:12:21.286 --> 00:12:22.296 A:middle
time of day's very important.

00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:23.336 A:middle
And, another one that says a

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.606 A:middle
specific location's important,

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:26.256 A:middle
you'll get high relevance output

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:28.136 A:middle
when both it is that time of day

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.296 A:middle
and the user is at that

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:29.806 A:middle
location.

00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:31.866 A:middle
If instead you want the union of

00:12:31.866 --> 00:12:32.816 A:middle
these relevance providers,

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:33.756 A:middle
you're going to want to provide

00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:35.356 A:middle
two separate relevance

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:36.356 A:middle
shortcuts, each one with a

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.246 A:middle
different relevance provider.

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:39.716 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
options we have available.

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.246 A:middle
The first one is

00:12:42.436 --> 00:12:44.726 A:middle
INDateRelevanceProvider, which

00:12:44.726 --> 00:12:45.656 A:middle
has a required startDate

00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:46.876 A:middle
parameter, and an optional

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:47.536 A:middle
endDate parameter.

00:12:48.546 --> 00:12:49.516 A:middle
When you create an instance of

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:50.986 A:middle
this relevance provider, the

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.416 A:middle
closer time of day gets to the

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:53.676 A:middle
start that you've provided, the

00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:54.866 A:middle
higher the relevance output of

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:55.346 A:middle
the provider.

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:57.596 A:middle
After that time of day passes,

00:12:57.836 --> 00:12:58.856 A:middle
the relevance will fall off on a

00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
curve, allowing more content to

00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
curve, allowing more content to

00:13:00.126 --> 00:13:01.046 A:middle
appear on the top of the watch

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:01.366 A:middle
face.

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:02.466 A:middle
And, if you give us this

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.076 A:middle
optional endDate, we'll adjust

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:05.316 A:middle
that curve to accommodate.

00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:08.806 A:middle
If your content instead is more

00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:10.086 A:middle
relevant to a given location,

00:13:10.086 --> 00:13:10.706 A:middle
you can use the

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:12.076 A:middle
INLocationRelevanceProvider.

00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:14.916 A:middle
It takes a CLRegion as its main

00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:16.246 A:middle
parameter when you create an

00:13:16.246 --> 00:13:16.956 A:middle
instance of this.

00:13:17.116 --> 00:13:18.296 A:middle
As the user gets closer and

00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:19.686 A:middle
closer to that region, the

00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:20.666 A:middle
relevance output of this

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:21.936 A:middle
relevanceProvider gets higher

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:22.306 A:middle
and higher.

00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:24.956 A:middle
Now, you don't always have a

00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:26.246 A:middle
specific time of day, or

00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:27.506 A:middle
location in mind, for where your

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.946 A:middle
content should be relevant.

00:13:30.296 --> 00:13:31.866 A:middle
User's schedules, their favorite

00:13:31.866 --> 00:13:33.676 A:middle
locations vary all over the

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:34.636 A:middle
place, and you don't want to

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:35.796 A:middle
have to get in the business of

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:36.546 A:middle
tracking all of this.

00:13:36.736 --> 00:13:38.126 A:middle
So, you can take advantage of

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:39.596 A:middle
the Siri face's smarts, and use

00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:39.676 A:middle
an

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:41.226 A:middle
INDailyRoutineRelevanceProvider,

00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:42.646 A:middle
where we have situations for

00:13:42.646 --> 00:13:43.856 A:middle
both time of days that might be

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.116 A:middle
favorite for your users, and

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:45.596 A:middle
location.

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
For instance, if you have some

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:48.516 A:middle
content you want to show as a

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:49.846 A:middle
daily forecast when your user

00:13:49.846 --> 00:13:51.296 A:middle
wakes up, you don't want to have

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:52.176 A:middle
to know if they wake up at 5

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:52.896 A:middle
A.M. or 10 A.M.

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:53.956 A:middle
You should just give us the

00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:54.816 A:middle
morning situation.

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:57.066 A:middle
And, if you've got a workout you

00:13:57.066 --> 00:13:58.116 A:middle
want to suggest that requires

00:13:58.116 --> 00:13:59.426 A:middle
some gym equipment, you can pass

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.426 A:middle
us the gym situation.

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.426 A:middle
us the gym situation.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:04.186 A:middle
So, now that we have all of this

00:14:04.186 --> 00:14:05.736 A:middle
API in our toolbox, let's build

00:14:05.736 --> 00:14:06.846 A:middle
a couple of relevant shortcuts.

00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:09.336 A:middle
In my examples we've got a

00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:10.546 A:middle
hypothetical meal logging

00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:12.656 A:middle
application that allows users to

00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:13.726 A:middle
log their meals, and they can

00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:14.626 A:middle
opt to do challenges.

00:14:15.016 --> 00:14:16.186 A:middle
This week's challenge, our users

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.676 A:middle
opted into a veggie challenge.

00:14:18.346 --> 00:14:19.636 A:middle
So, we're going to create a user

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:22.336 A:middle
activity for logging meals.

00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:23.846 A:middle
It's an activity type is

00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:25.386 A:middle
com.myapp.LogMeal.

00:14:25.926 --> 00:14:26.596 A:middle
And, because we're going to be

00:14:26.596 --> 00:14:27.696 A:middle
displaying this for the dinner

00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:28.936 A:middle
meal, we're going to set the

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:30.076 A:middle
value for the meal key in our

00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:31.656 A:middle
user info dictionary to Dinner.

00:14:32.986 --> 00:14:34.056 A:middle
Once we have our userActivity

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:35.266 A:middle
set up, we can create a

00:14:35.266 --> 00:14:36.166 A:middle
shortcut, and from that

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:36.976 A:middle
shortcut, we can create a

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:37.676 A:middle
relevantShortcut.

00:14:38.716 --> 00:14:39.536 A:middle
Now, we want to really let our

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:40.696 A:middle
users know that this is showing

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:41.736 A:middle
up on the watch face, because

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:42.916 A:middle
they've opted into the veggie

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:43.406 A:middle
challenge.

00:14:43.896 --> 00:14:44.716 A:middle
So, we're going to create a

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:45.606 A:middle
default card template to

00:14:45.606 --> 00:14:47.516 A:middle
customize their UI with Log

00:14:47.516 --> 00:14:48.316 A:middle
Dinner as our title.

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:49.876 A:middle
And, we're going to convey the

00:14:49.876 --> 00:14:51.436 A:middle
veggie challenge in our subtitle

00:14:51.606 --> 00:14:52.396 A:middle
and our custom image.

00:14:52.986 --> 00:14:55.466 A:middle
Now, our users haven't always

00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:56.876 A:middle
been necessarily logging their

00:14:56.876 --> 00:14:58.076 A:middle
dinners, but they've opted into

00:14:58.076 --> 00:14:58.636 A:middle
this challenge.

00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:00.136 A:middle
So, we want to give the system a

00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:00.136 A:middle
So, we want to give the system a

00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
hint that this should be

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:02.406 A:middle
displayed in the evening by

00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:02.926 A:middle
passing a

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:04.566 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:05.636 A:middle
with the situation .evening.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:07.076 A:middle
And now that our

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:08.306 A:middle
relevantShortcut is configured,

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:09.246 A:middle
we can pass it along to the

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:10.466 A:middle
default relevantShortcutStore.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:14.006 A:middle
For our next example, in our

00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:15.466 A:middle
application, users also have a

00:15:15.466 --> 00:15:16.346 A:middle
bunch of favorites they can

00:15:16.346 --> 00:15:17.786 A:middle
configure for snacks they eat

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:19.196 A:middle
often, or perhaps a breakfast

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:19.886 A:middle
they had every day.

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:20.726 A:middle
So, we've created a

00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:23.176 A:middle
logFavoriteMealIntent.

00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:25.206 A:middle
We want a couple of these to

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.146 A:middle
surface on the watch face to

00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:27.206 A:middle
make it even easier for our

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.226 A:middle
users to log their favorite

00:15:28.226 --> 00:15:28.936 A:middle
snacks and meals.

00:15:29.736 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
So, we'll create an instance of

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.806 A:middle
our intent, and take one of our

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:33.736 A:middle
favorites, and set it on the

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:34.466 A:middle
favorites parameter.

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.256 A:middle
In this case, our user likes to

00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:36.746 A:middle
eat cookies.

00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:39.496 A:middle
We'll also set an image for that

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:40.936 A:middle
parameter, so that when it shows

00:15:40.936 --> 00:15:42.106 A:middle
up on the watch face, they get a

00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:43.136 A:middle
little bit more context about

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:43.876 A:middle
what they're about to log.

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
From here, we can take our

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.416 A:middle
intent and create a shortcut,

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:48.646 A:middle
and from our shortcut, create a

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:49.316 A:middle
relevantShortcut.

00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
At this point, we're ready to

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.636 A:middle
pass along our relevantShortcut

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:54.106 A:middle
to the relevant shortcut store.

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:55.656 A:middle
We don't need a default card

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:56.806 A:middle
template, because the title

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:58.236 A:middle
strings and image, the image

00:15:58.236 --> 00:15:59.056 A:middle
that we pass along to our

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.086 A:middle
intent, should be sufficient.

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.086 A:middle
intent, should be sufficient.

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:01.816 A:middle
We also don't really want to

00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:02.726 A:middle
provide a relevanceProvider

00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:02.976 A:middle
here.

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:04.356 A:middle
Because this is something

00:16:04.356 --> 00:16:05.426 A:middle
habitual for our users.

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:06.906 A:middle
They log these often throughout

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:07.806 A:middle
the day, and we can take

00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:09.056 A:middle
advantage of the Siri face's

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:10.316 A:middle
prediction engine to show it

00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:11.716 A:middle
when it most matters to our

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:12.196 A:middle
users.

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:14.966 A:middle
And, once we're done creating

00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:16.126 A:middle
our relevantShortcuts, we're not

00:16:16.126 --> 00:16:16.996 A:middle
done here actually.

00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:18.356 A:middle
We need to be able to handle

00:16:18.356 --> 00:16:18.846 A:middle
them as well.

00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:21.316 A:middle
And, new in watchOS 5 is a

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:22.396 A:middle
method on your

00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:23.896 A:middle
WKExtensionDelegate called

00:16:23.896 --> 00:16:24.836 A:middle
handle user shortcut.

00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:27.336 A:middle
And, our first example, if the

00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:28.946 A:middle
user taps on that Siri platter,

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:29.766 A:middle
our application will be

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:31.396 A:middle
launched, and we'll be handed a

00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:32.886 A:middle
user activity to this method,

00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:34.436 A:middle
whose activity type matches

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.686 A:middle
com.myapp.LogMeal.

00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:37.716 A:middle
At this point, we want to make

00:16:37.716 --> 00:16:38.646 A:middle
sure we go into the right part

00:16:38.646 --> 00:16:39.396 A:middle
of our application.

00:16:39.496 --> 00:16:40.486 A:middle
So, we'll jump up to the

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:41.916 A:middle
rootInterfaceController, and

00:16:41.916 --> 00:16:42.456 A:middle
push on our

00:16:42.456 --> 00:16:43.786 A:middle
logMealInterfaceController.

00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:45.376 A:middle
We've got to be sure to pass

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.636 A:middle
along that context we put into

00:16:46.636 --> 00:16:48.076 A:middle
our user info dictionary, so we

00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
know which meal we're about to

00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:49.476 A:middle
be logging.

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.956 A:middle
For our second example, the

00:16:52.956 --> 00:16:54.316 A:middle
common case will be that that

00:16:54.316 --> 00:16:55.716 A:middle
background-capable intent will

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:57.006 A:middle
execute successfully in our

00:16:57.006 --> 00:16:57.796 A:middle
intents extension.

00:16:58.346 --> 00:16:59.076 A:middle
But, there are a couple

00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:00.506 A:middle
instances where our application

00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:00.506 A:middle
instances where our application

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.106 A:middle
will get a callback directly.

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:03.646 A:middle
The first one being if there's

00:17:03.646 --> 00:17:04.856 A:middle
an error during execution, and

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:05.776 A:middle
we say we need to handle this

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:06.846 A:middle
within our app.

00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:08.165 A:middle
The other one, though, might

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:09.096 A:middle
happen if the user wants to

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:09.856 A:middle
tweak a couple of the

00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:10.415 A:middle
parameters.

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:11.836 A:middle
For instance, they see that

00:17:11.836 --> 00:17:12.806 A:middle
they're about to log a cookie,

00:17:13.076 --> 00:17:13.866 A:middle
when they really know they just

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.356 A:middle
ate 5.

00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:16.195 A:middle
So, we'll tap on the top module,

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
we'll launch into your

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
application, and you'll get a

00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:18.945 A:middle
callback here.

00:17:19.396 --> 00:17:20.945 A:middle
The userActivity you'll receive

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.586 A:middle
will have an activity type equal

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:23.945 A:middle
to the name of the class of

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:24.846 A:middle
intent you gave us.

00:17:25.386 --> 00:17:27.626 A:middle
At this point, you can extract

00:17:27.626 --> 00:17:28.526 A:middle
an interaction off of

00:17:28.526 --> 00:17:30.546 A:middle
userActivity, and an intent off

00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:31.936 A:middle
of that interaction, which will

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.176 A:middle
have all the parameters you set

00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:33.826 A:middle
when you created your

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:35.086 A:middle
relevantShortcut.

00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:37.366 A:middle
So, now we're ready to create

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:38.506 A:middle
relevant shortcuts whenever our

00:17:38.506 --> 00:17:39.596 A:middle
application has runtime.

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:40.966 A:middle
But, it's very important to

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
note, that just because your

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:43.166 A:middle
content is showing up on the

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:44.456 A:middle
Siri watch face, doesn't mean

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:45.676 A:middle
your application is actively

00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:45.966 A:middle
running.

00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:48.006 A:middle
So, to help you get more runtime

00:17:48.176 --> 00:17:49.256 A:middle
to provide relative shortcuts,

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:50.186 A:middle
we've created the

00:17:50.186 --> 00:17:52.676 A:middle
WKRelevantShortcutRefresh

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:53.336 A:middle
BackgroundTask.

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.026 A:middle
We'll be handing this out to

00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:57.516 A:middle
applications that are providing

00:17:57.596 --> 00:17:58.916 A:middle
awesome relevant shortcuts that

00:17:58.916 --> 00:17:59.896 A:middle
our users are spending time

00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:02.116 A:middle
looking at, tapping through, but

00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:02.116 A:middle
looking at, tapping through, but

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:02.956 A:middle
not scrolling past.

00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:05.126 A:middle
When you get one of these

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.716 A:middle
refresh background tasks, it's

00:18:06.716 --> 00:18:08.366 A:middle
your opportunity to update the

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:10.046 A:middle
data that supplies your relevant

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:11.596 A:middle
shortcuts, and give us a fresh

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:12.576 A:middle
set of relevant shortcuts.

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:15.976 A:middle
And, on a related note, if your

00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:17.136 A:middle
background-capable intent

00:18:17.136 --> 00:18:18.586 A:middle
executes, it's inside of your

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:19.376 A:middle
intents extension.

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:20.796 A:middle
That means that if you update

00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:22.126 A:middle
your data store, it's possible

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:22.966 A:middle
that your UI and your

00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
application has become stale.

00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:26.796 A:middle
So, in watchOS 5, we've also

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:28.416 A:middle
created the

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:30.056 A:middle
WKIntentDidRunRefresh

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:30.776 A:middle
BackgroundTask.

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.086 A:middle
And, we'll hand that to you with

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:33.606 A:middle
some runtime when your intents

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:35.396 A:middle
extension completes a execution

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:35.926 A:middle
of a shortcut.

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:38.326 A:middle
That is your opportunity to make

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.646 A:middle
sure that your UI's up to date,

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:41.526 A:middle
perhaps request an updated

00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:43.806 A:middle
snapshot, or reload, or extend

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:44.866 A:middle
your complication timeline.

00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:48.916 A:middle
So, let's talk about how we can

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:50.596 A:middle
take advantage of these API's on

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:50.926 A:middle
iOS.

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:52.746 A:middle
And, the great news is, with the

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:53.686 A:middle
exception of those

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:55.666 A:middle
WKRefreshBackgroundTasks, we can

00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:57.646 A:middle
use all of the same exact API's

00:18:57.876 --> 00:18:58.996 A:middle
in our iOS application.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.086 A:middle
The relevant shortcuts we

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:02.656 A:middle
provide in our iOS app will be

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:03.716 A:middle
periodically synced from the

00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
phone to the watch.

00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:05.896 A:middle
And, merged in with local,

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:06.766 A:middle
relevant shortcuts for

00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:08.256 A:middle
consideration to be displayed on

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:08.866 A:middle
the watch face.

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:10.976 A:middle
You have all of the same UI

00:19:10.976 --> 00:19:12.656 A:middle
customization options available.

00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:14.286 A:middle
The only difference is if your

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.446 A:middle
relevant shortcut will execute

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:16.726 A:middle
back on the phone, we'll show

00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:18.096 A:middle
your iOS application's icon

00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:18.896 A:middle
instead of your watchOS

00:19:18.896 --> 00:19:19.706 A:middle
applications icon.

00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:23.146 A:middle
And now that we can be showing

00:19:23.146 --> 00:19:24.146 A:middle
relevant shortcuts that will

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:25.026 A:middle
execute on the phone or the

00:19:25.026 --> 00:19:26.276 A:middle
watch, let's talk about where

00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:27.156 A:middle
they will execute when the user

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:28.316 A:middle
taps on them.

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:31.246 A:middle
If a relevant shortcut can be

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:32.406 A:middle
handled by an application that's

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:33.796 A:middle
installed locally on your watch,

00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:35.046 A:middle
regardless of where it came

00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:36.916 A:middle
from, we're going to execute it

00:19:36.956 --> 00:19:38.166 A:middle
in the watchOS application.

00:19:38.836 --> 00:19:40.116 A:middle
That gives the user the best

00:19:40.116 --> 00:19:41.296 A:middle
experience and the lowest

00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
latency.

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
You can ensure that your watchOS

00:19:44.386 --> 00:19:45.956 A:middle
application supports execution

00:19:45.956 --> 00:19:47.336 A:middle
of a shortcut by making sure the

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:48.986 A:middle
user activity's activityType is

00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
in your info.plist,

00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:51.766 A:middle
NSUserActivityTyped array.

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:53.816 A:middle
Or, if it's an intent, that your

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:55.156 A:middle
intent is listed in your intents

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:55.656 A:middle
extension.

00:19:56.226 --> 00:19:58.736 A:middle
If instead there is no

00:19:58.736 --> 00:19:59.826 A:middle
application installed that can

00:19:59.826 --> 00:20:01.956 A:middle
handle your shortcut, except on

00:19:59.826 --> 00:20:01.956 A:middle
handle your shortcut, except on

00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
iOS, we'll execute it back on

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:04.366 A:middle
the phone, even if your phone

00:20:04.366 --> 00:20:05.786 A:middle
isn't near the user.

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:08.556 A:middle
Now, because we can be executing

00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
content back on the phone, we

00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:10.766 A:middle
want to make sure that users

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.116 A:middle
don't tap on a platter, and then

00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:13.266 A:middle
are immediately told to go find

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:13.676 A:middle
their phone.

00:20:13.676 --> 00:20:15.286 A:middle
So, we have a couple of rules

00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.536 A:middle
about the type of shortcuts that

00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:17.536 A:middle
will execute back on the phone

00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:18.516 A:middle
that we're willing to surface.

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:21.126 A:middle
Requirements are that they're

00:20:21.126 --> 00:20:21.756 A:middle
intent-based.

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:23.166 A:middle
They handle background

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:23.796 A:middle
execution.

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:25.316 A:middle
And, they don't require access

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.076 A:middle
to protected data.

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:27.266 A:middle
And, that's the data that you

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:28.826 A:middle
keep encrypted when the phone is

00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:29.116 A:middle
locked.

00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:31.496 A:middle
The way you can ensure that your

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.316 A:middle
content meets these requirements

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.256 A:middle
is by taking a look at the

00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:35.276 A:middle
parameter combination in your

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.916 A:middle
custom intent, and ensuring that

00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:38.126 A:middle
background execution is

00:20:38.126 --> 00:20:38.576 A:middle
supported.

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:40.796 A:middle
And, looking at your overall

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:42.246 A:middle
custom intent and seeing if you

00:20:42.246 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
have any authentication

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.466 A:middle
restrictions you've applied.

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:46.306 A:middle
There are three options here,

00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:47.336 A:middle
and we support the first two.

00:20:47.786 --> 00:20:48.636 A:middle
The first one is that there are

00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.316 A:middle
no restrictions.

00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:51.626 A:middle
The second one says that you are

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:52.786 A:middle
restricted while the device is

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:53.926 A:middle
locked, which means that at

00:20:53.926 --> 00:20:54.886 A:middle
least the watch has to be

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:55.956 A:middle
unlocked for us to execute.

00:20:56.306 --> 00:20:58.276 A:middle
And the final one is Restricted

00:20:58.276 --> 00:20:59.826 A:middle
While Locked, or Protected Data

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:00.486 A:middle
is Unavailable.

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:00.486 A:middle
is Unavailable.

00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:03.086 A:middle
Now that you have all this

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:03.996 A:middle
information you're ready to

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.026 A:middle
build some awesome shortcuts

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:05.976 A:middle
from both the watch and the

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:06.276 A:middle
phone.

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:07.516 A:middle
So, I'd like to hand things over

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.766 A:middle
to Josh to talk a little bit

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:09.476 A:middle
more about our prediction

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:09.766 A:middle
engine.

00:21:09.766 --> 00:21:09.966 A:middle
Thank you.

00:21:10.516 --> 00:21:17.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:18.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paul.

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:20.166 A:middle
Good morning.

00:21:20.686 --> 00:21:22.176 A:middle
My name is Josh, and I am an

00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:23.516 A:middle
engineer on the watchOS team.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:25.236 A:middle
And, we're really excited to see

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:26.536 A:middle
the kinds of relevant shortcuts

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.156 A:middle
that you can surface on the Siri

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:28.766 A:middle
watch face.

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:31.186 A:middle
So, Paul just walked you through

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:32.616 A:middle
some of the API's and different

00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:34.456 A:middle
ways that you can provide your

00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:35.416 A:middle
relevant shortcuts to the

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:35.866 A:middle
system.

00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:37.916 A:middle
Now, I want to talk about how

00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:38.926 A:middle
the system predicts your

00:21:38.926 --> 00:21:40.336 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and the

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:42.166 A:middle
things that you can do to ensure

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:43.946 A:middle
the system surfaces your content

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:45.046 A:middle
when it's most appropriate to

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:45.426 A:middle
the user.

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:49.136 A:middle
It's like Paul talked about

00:21:49.136 --> 00:21:50.946 A:middle
earlier, content on the Siri

00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:52.116 A:middle
watch face is ordered by

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:53.316 A:middle
relevance to the user.

00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.586 A:middle
At a wrist raise, we want to be

00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:57.196 A:middle
surfacing the content the user

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.366 A:middle
cares about most.

00:21:58.666 --> 00:21:59.506 A:middle
Whether that be based on the

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
current time, location, or other

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
current time, location, or other

00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:03.006 A:middle
factors from across the system.

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:06.646 A:middle
And, to figure out what content

00:22:06.646 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
the user cares about, we're

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:09.276 A:middle
looking at how they interact

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:10.786 A:middle
with the different platters on

00:22:10.786 --> 00:22:11.716 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:13.306 A:middle
What things are they tapping on?

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
What things are they spending a

00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:15.246 A:middle
lot of time looking at?

00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:15.996 A:middle
And, what things are they

00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:17.636 A:middle
scrolling past to find other

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:18.166 A:middle
content?

00:22:18.696 --> 00:22:20.296 A:middle
And, we use all this information

00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:22.326 A:middle
to understand what are the

00:22:22.326 --> 00:22:23.436 A:middle
different platters that the user

00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:24.736 A:middle
wants to see right on a wrist

00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:25.066 A:middle
raise.

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
And so, because we're trying to

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:30.866 A:middle
surface, again, the content the

00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:32.726 A:middle
user cares about most, you want

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:33.246 A:middle
to make sure that you're

00:22:33.246 --> 00:22:34.846 A:middle
providing relevant, engaging

00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:36.246 A:middle
content to be surfaced on the

00:22:36.246 --> 00:22:36.976 A:middle
Siri watch face.

00:22:40.796 --> 00:22:42.026 A:middle
So, let's talk a little bit more

00:22:42.026 --> 00:22:43.846 A:middle
about how we actually put your

00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:44.896 A:middle
relevant shortcuts on the Siri

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:45.526 A:middle
watch face.

00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:47.346 A:middle
So, like Paul mentioned earlier,

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:48.416 A:middle
the first step is you need to

00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:49.596 A:middle
provide your relevant shortcuts

00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:50.916 A:middle
to the system, into the

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:52.806 A:middle
defaultRelevantShortcutsStore.

00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:54.986 A:middle
Once you've provided your

00:22:54.986 --> 00:22:56.946 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, we can run

00:22:56.946 --> 00:22:57.816 A:middle
them through our machine

00:22:57.816 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
learning model to figure out

00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:00.136 A:middle
what is the best way to be

00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:00.136 A:middle
what is the best way to be

00:23:00.136 --> 00:23:01.556 A:middle
surfacing your relevant

00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:02.466 A:middle
shortcuts to the user.

00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.236 A:middle
So, let's look at what we take

00:23:04.236 --> 00:23:05.336 A:middle
into account inside of this

00:23:05.486 --> 00:23:05.866 A:middle
model.

00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:08.546 A:middle
So, the first thing that we look

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:10.116 A:middle
at is your relevance providers.

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:12.496 A:middle
This is your way to provide

00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:14.356 A:middle
additional context to the system

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.786 A:middle
that we wouldn't otherwise have.

00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.506 A:middle
This might be a concrete time,

00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:19.696 A:middle
location, or other context.

00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:22.756 A:middle
We also look at past behavior.

00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:24.416 A:middle
So, how has the user interacted

00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:25.506 A:middle
with this relevant shortcut

00:23:25.536 --> 00:23:25.936 A:middle
before?

00:23:26.356 --> 00:23:27.176 A:middle
Is it something they're spending

00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:28.496 A:middle
a lot of time tapping on and

00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:29.626 A:middle
looking at on the watch face?

00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:30.436 A:middle
Or, something that they're

00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:31.956 A:middle
scrolling past to find something

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:32.666 A:middle
more interesting?

00:23:34.506 --> 00:23:36.076 A:middle
We also look at a number of

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:37.166 A:middle
different factors from across

00:23:37.196 --> 00:23:38.536 A:middle
the system, such as, you know,

00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:39.916 A:middle
the current time, current day of

00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:41.666 A:middle
the week, current location,

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.646 A:middle
user's routine, among a number

00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:44.456 A:middle
of other factors.

00:23:44.516 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
And, take all this into account

00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:48.146 A:middle
to try to better understand what

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:49.746 A:middle
is the context under which the

00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:51.096 A:middle
user wants to interact with the

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.116 A:middle
particular shortcut.

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:57.296 A:middle
And, it's also worth noting that

00:23:57.296 --> 00:23:59.406 A:middle
this model is secure and

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:00.676 A:middle
personalized to each user.

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:00.676 A:middle
personalized to each user.

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.526 A:middle
All of our learning happens

00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:05.496 A:middle
on-device, and we're building a

00:24:05.496 --> 00:24:07.306 A:middle
model for each and every single

00:24:07.306 --> 00:24:08.806 A:middle
user of the Siri watch face.

00:24:08.876 --> 00:24:10.126 A:middle
The way that you interact with

00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:11.226 A:middle
the watch face may be different

00:24:11.226 --> 00:24:12.116 A:middle
from the way that I interact

00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:12.646 A:middle
with the watch.

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:15.546 A:middle
And, once we have this model

00:24:15.546 --> 00:24:17.436 A:middle
trained we can then take your

00:24:17.436 --> 00:24:19.326 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and again,

00:24:19.406 --> 00:24:20.586 A:middle
surface them on the Siri watch

00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:21.796 A:middle
face based on their relevance to

00:24:21.796 --> 00:24:21.976 A:middle
the user.

00:24:26.416 --> 00:24:27.376 A:middle
If you attended some of the

00:24:27.376 --> 00:24:29.136 A:middle
previous shortcut talks, you may

00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:30.396 A:middle
have heard about donations.

00:24:31.126 --> 00:24:32.726 A:middle
This is your way to indicate to

00:24:32.726 --> 00:24:34.606 A:middle
the system what the user's doing

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:35.266 A:middle
within your app.

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:37.926 A:middle
And, although they don't

00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:39.186 A:middle
actually surface within the UI

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:41.816 A:middle
of the Siri watch face, we take

00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:43.176 A:middle
them into account when trying to

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:44.346 A:middle
understand the user's past

00:24:44.346 --> 00:24:44.886 A:middle
behavior.

00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
So, again, donations are your

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:51.406 A:middle
way to indicate important tasks,

00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.186 A:middle
or other information about what

00:24:53.186 --> 00:24:54.816 A:middle
users are doing inside of your

00:24:54.816 --> 00:24:56.416 A:middle
applications, and providing that

00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:56.936 A:middle
to the system.

00:24:58.546 --> 00:25:00.006 A:middle
And, by giving this information

00:24:58.546 --> 00:25:00.006 A:middle
And, by giving this information

00:25:00.006 --> 00:25:01.996 A:middle
to the system, we can understand

00:25:01.996 --> 00:25:03.276 A:middle
and learn patterns in the user's

00:25:03.276 --> 00:25:03.836 A:middle
behavior.

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:06.646 A:middle
So, if the user, for example, is

00:25:06.646 --> 00:25:07.766 A:middle
looking or performing the same

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:08.996 A:middle
action at the same time every

00:25:08.996 --> 00:25:10.966 A:middle
single day, or around similar

00:25:10.966 --> 00:25:12.746 A:middle
locations, the system can pick

00:25:12.746 --> 00:25:14.186 A:middle
up on these patterns, and again,

00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:15.526 A:middle
surface the relevant shortcuts

00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:16.956 A:middle
when they're appropriate to your

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.456 A:middle
users.

00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:21.886 A:middle
So, if you're using

00:25:21.886 --> 00:25:23.426 A:middle
NSUserActivities to represent

00:25:23.566 --> 00:25:25.286 A:middle
your donations, there's a few

00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:26.416 A:middle
things you need to do to be able

00:25:26.536 --> 00:25:27.576 A:middle
to provide those donations to

00:25:27.576 --> 00:25:28.066 A:middle
the system.

00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:30.056 A:middle
The first is you need to set

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:31.296 A:middle
both these properties to "true"

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.856 A:middle
in your NSUserActivity, the

00:25:32.856 --> 00:25:34.096 A:middle
eligibleForPrediction and

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:35.066 A:middle
eligibleForSearch.

00:25:37.056 --> 00:25:38.156 A:middle
Next, you need to make sure that

00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:39.436 A:middle
your user activity is supported

00:25:39.436 --> 00:25:40.936 A:middle
by an application, by indicating

00:25:40.936 --> 00:25:42.206 A:middle
that within your info.plist.

00:25:43.936 --> 00:25:44.926 A:middle
And, finally you want to make

00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:46.056 A:middle
sure that you're donating these

00:25:46.056 --> 00:25:47.196 A:middle
user activities whenever this

00:25:47.236 --> 00:25:48.636 A:middle
piece of content is visible to

00:25:48.636 --> 00:25:50.096 A:middle
the user, so the system can

00:25:50.096 --> 00:25:50.966 A:middle
start to pick up on the

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:51.566 A:middle
patterns.

00:25:51.966 --> 00:25:54.696 A:middle
And so, to provide that

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:56.166 A:middle
donation, there's a method on

00:25:56.216 --> 00:25:57.756 A:middle
NSUserActivity, becomeCurrent,

00:25:58.006 --> 00:25:59.126 A:middle
that allows you to donate to the

00:25:59.126 --> 00:25:59.546 A:middle
system.

00:26:01.216 --> 00:26:03.166 A:middle
New in watchOS 5, though, there

00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:03.906 A:middle
is this method

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:05.816 A:middle
updateUserActivity on

00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:07.706 A:middle
WKInterfaceController, where you

00:26:07.706 --> 00:26:09.596 A:middle
can attach your user activity to

00:26:09.596 --> 00:26:11.226 A:middle
an interfaceController, and

00:26:11.226 --> 00:26:11.776 A:middle
whenever this

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:13.036 A:middle
interfaceController's visible to

00:26:13.116 --> 00:26:14.336 A:middle
the user, the system will

00:26:14.336 --> 00:26:15.836 A:middle
automatically be donating the

00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:17.166 A:middle
user activities on your behalf.

00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:19.416 A:middle
This is similar to the API's

00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:21.116 A:middle
that we have over on iOS, on

00:26:21.116 --> 00:26:22.036 A:middle
UIViewController, and

00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:23.536 A:middle
UIResponder, where you can, kind

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:26.116 A:middle
of, attach an NSUserActivity to

00:26:26.116 --> 00:26:26.796 A:middle
a piece of your UI.

00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:29.166 A:middle
And so now, this is the

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:30.846 A:middle
recommended way to be providing

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:32.286 A:middle
NSUserActivity donations on

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:32.966 A:middle
watchOS.

00:26:34.416 --> 00:26:37.436 A:middle
If your shortcuts are backed by

00:26:37.436 --> 00:26:39.786 A:middle
an intent, you can provide those

00:26:39.886 --> 00:26:41.726 A:middle
intent donations by using the

00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:42.786 A:middle
INInteraction API.

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:45.096 A:middle
So, if you attended any of the

00:26:45.096 --> 00:26:46.166 A:middle
previous shortcut talks, this

00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:47.286 A:middle
probably looks familiar to you.

00:26:47.286 --> 00:26:49.696 A:middle
But, to provide this donation,

00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:50.786 A:middle
first you create your intent,

00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:52.656 A:middle
and adjust any parameters as

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
they're necessary for what the

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:54.636 A:middle
user just did within your app.

00:26:55.506 --> 00:26:56.596 A:middle
Next, you create your

00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
INInteraction with intent, and

00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
call the donate method when

00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
call the donate method when

00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:01.456 A:middle
users perform this particular

00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:01.916 A:middle
interaction.

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:05.556 A:middle
The other thing to look out for,

00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:07.526 A:middle
is this primary shortcut type

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.466 A:middle
for when we're making watchOS

00:27:09.466 --> 00:27:09.936 A:middle
predictions.

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:11.906 A:middle
And so, let's take a look at

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:12.716 A:middle
this.

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:15.216 A:middle
Inside of the Xcode intents

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:16.466 A:middle
editor, you'll notice that

00:27:16.466 --> 00:27:18.326 A:middle
there's a field to select the

00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:19.446 A:middle
primary shortcut type.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:21.666 A:middle
So, this allows you to indicate

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:22.676 A:middle
to the system, like, kind of,

00:27:22.676 --> 00:27:24.296 A:middle
the most critical use cases for

00:27:24.296 --> 00:27:24.646 A:middle
your app.

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.616 A:middle
And so, let's talk more about

00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.366 A:middle
what that means.

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.786 A:middle
So, by indicating the primary

00:27:31.786 --> 00:27:33.086 A:middle
shortcut type, you're, kind of,

00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:34.696 A:middle
telling the system what are the

00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:36.206 A:middle
use cases that you think your

00:27:36.206 --> 00:27:37.426 A:middle
users care about most.

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:38.906 A:middle
And, this helps us expedite our

00:27:38.906 --> 00:27:39.766 A:middle
learning process.

00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:42.616 A:middle
You can indicate one of these

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:43.866 A:middle
per intent that you've defined.

00:27:45.616 --> 00:27:46.986 A:middle
And, for the best performance,

00:27:47.246 --> 00:27:48.846 A:middle
the parameter combination, the

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:50.436 A:middle
selection, have a subset of the

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.526 A:middle
parameters that you're providing

00:27:51.526 --> 00:27:52.536 A:middle
in your relevant shortcuts.

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:53.786 A:middle
And, we'll walk through a couple

00:27:53.786 --> 00:27:54.796 A:middle
of examples to try to better

00:27:54.796 --> 00:27:58.066 A:middle
understand what that means.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.746 A:middle
But, by giving this information

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
to the system, we can much more

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
to the system, we can much more

00:28:01.436 --> 00:28:03.296 A:middle
quickly pick up on patterns in

00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:04.866 A:middle
the user behavior, and much more

00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:06.176 A:middle
quickly understand what are the

00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:07.336 A:middle
relevant shortcuts that the user

00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:08.236 A:middle
cares about most.

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:11.836 A:middle
So, first up, we have this

00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:12.446 A:middle
Messaging app.

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:13.766 A:middle
And so, this is something that

00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:14.806 A:middle
Paul and I have been using for a

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:16.046 A:middle
while now, so every morning

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:17.086 A:middle
we're sending messages back and

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:17.386 A:middle
forth.

00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:19.086 A:middle
Sometimes it's in preparation

00:28:19.086 --> 00:28:20.666 A:middle
for this talk, and other times

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.316 A:middle
it's about what cookies we want

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:24.686 A:middle
to get at lunch.

00:28:24.846 --> 00:28:26.396 A:middle
And so, this app has gone ahead

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:28.006 A:middle
and adopted Siri shortcuts.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:29.096 A:middle
And, they defined a couple

00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:30.316 A:middle
different parameters that their

00:28:30.316 --> 00:28:30.996 A:middle
app supports.

00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:32.056 A:middle
So, the first one is the

00:28:32.056 --> 00:28:32.566 A:middle
recipient.

00:28:32.886 --> 00:28:34.106 A:middle
So, who am I sending a message

00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:34.326 A:middle
to?

00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:36.246 A:middle
And, the second one is the

00:28:36.246 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
message.

00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:38.126 A:middle
So, what is the content of the

00:28:38.126 --> 00:28:39.156 A:middle
message I'm trying to send?

00:28:40.416 --> 00:28:41.946 A:middle
So, like I mentioned before,

00:28:41.946 --> 00:28:43.206 A:middle
right, Paul and I are using this

00:28:43.206 --> 00:28:45.026 A:middle
app every single morning, but

00:28:45.026 --> 00:28:46.266 A:middle
the actual content of the

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:47.396 A:middle
messages that we're sending

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:48.406 A:middle
varies from day to day.

00:28:49.366 --> 00:28:50.886 A:middle
So, because of this, this may

00:28:50.886 --> 00:28:52.166 A:middle
not make a good candidate for

00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:53.326 A:middle
the primary shortcut type.

00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:54.836 A:middle
It's going to take a lot longer

00:28:54.926 --> 00:28:56.126 A:middle
before the system can, kind of,

00:28:56.126 --> 00:28:57.806 A:middle
understand what are the

00:28:57.806 --> 00:28:59.026 A:middle
shortcuts I'm trying to perform.

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
Whereas, Paul and I are having

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
Whereas, Paul and I are having

00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:03.706 A:middle
very consistent conversations,

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:05.056 A:middle
so the system can really quickly

00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:06.296 A:middle
pick up on this pattern, that

00:29:06.296 --> 00:29:07.206 A:middle
every morning, I'm sending

00:29:07.206 --> 00:29:10.486 A:middle
messages to Paul.

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:12.176 A:middle
Another little more interesting

00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:13.626 A:middle
example, is this app that I use

00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:14.736 A:middle
to order my morning coffee.

00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:17.166 A:middle
And again, this app has gone and

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.356 A:middle
adopted Siri shortcuts.

00:29:18.746 --> 00:29:20.176 A:middle
So, they support a couple

00:29:20.176 --> 00:29:21.116 A:middle
different parameters.

00:29:21.346 --> 00:29:22.656 A:middle
The first one is the type of

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:23.546 A:middle
coffee I want to buy.

00:29:24.026 --> 00:29:25.606 A:middle
The next one is the condiments,

00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:26.786 A:middle
so do I want cream or sugar?

00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:29.146 A:middle
And, finally, the location that

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:30.106 A:middle
I want to pick my coffee up

00:29:30.106 --> 00:29:30.376 A:middle
from.

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.546 A:middle
So, every morning I use this app

00:29:33.546 --> 00:29:34.936 A:middle
and go place an order for my

00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:35.606 A:middle
morning coffee.

00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:37.076 A:middle
But, depending on where I have a

00:29:37.076 --> 00:29:38.426 A:middle
meeting, the location that I

00:29:38.426 --> 00:29:39.676 A:middle
want to pick my coffee up from

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:40.656 A:middle
will change from day to day.

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.206 A:middle
Maybe I'm going to Infinite

00:29:42.206 --> 00:29:43.726 A:middle
Loop, or Apple Park, or up to

00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:45.556 A:middle
San Francisco, and I want to

00:29:45.556 --> 00:29:46.616 A:middle
pick up my coffee at, you know,

00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:47.416 A:middle
the closest store.

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:50.496 A:middle
So, again, because there's a lot

00:29:50.496 --> 00:29:52.056 A:middle
of variability in the location,

00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:53.436 A:middle
this may not make a good

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:54.276 A:middle
candidate for the primary

00:29:54.276 --> 00:29:54.906 A:middle
shortcut type.

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:56.366 A:middle
It's going to take a lot longer

00:29:56.366 --> 00:29:57.276 A:middle
for the system to, kind of,

00:29:57.276 --> 00:29:58.776 A:middle
understand the patterns in my

00:29:58.776 --> 00:29:59.296 A:middle
behavior.

00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:02.146 A:middle
Whereas, the actual order that I

00:30:02.146 --> 00:30:03.506 A:middle
place is the same thing every

00:30:03.506 --> 00:30:04.056 A:middle
single time.

00:30:04.156 --> 00:30:05.316 A:middle
I always order a latte with the

00:30:05.316 --> 00:30:06.266 A:middle
same amount of cream and same

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:06.876 A:middle
amount of sugar.

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:08.306 A:middle
So, this does make a really

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.516 A:middle
great candidate for the primary

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.616 A:middle
shortcut type.

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:14.586 A:middle
And, coffee-- it's on its own,

00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:16.206 A:middle
might be too generic, right?

00:30:16.206 --> 00:30:18.166 A:middle
The coffee plus the condiment

00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:20.046 A:middle
might make a better primary

00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:20.646 A:middle
shortcut type.

00:30:22.046 --> 00:30:23.956 A:middle
And so, that is how you can

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:25.866 A:middle
provide information from within

00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:27.316 A:middle
your apps about what users are

00:30:27.316 --> 00:30:27.666 A:middle
doing.

00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:29.566 A:middle
So, now let's talk about how we

00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:31.026 A:middle
predict your relevant shortcuts.

00:30:32.046 --> 00:30:33.746 A:middle
And, to talk about this, we have

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:34.656 A:middle
a couple different apps that

00:30:34.656 --> 00:30:36.806 A:middle
we're going to be looking at.

00:30:36.996 --> 00:30:38.276 A:middle
The first one is this recipes

00:30:38.276 --> 00:30:38.586 A:middle
app.

00:30:38.586 --> 00:30:40.106 A:middle
And so, this is an app that I

00:30:40.106 --> 00:30:41.396 A:middle
use every single day that

00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:42.706 A:middle
provides me suggestions for

00:30:42.706 --> 00:30:43.606 A:middle
recipes that I might want to

00:30:43.606 --> 00:30:43.906 A:middle
try.

00:30:46.076 --> 00:30:47.226 A:middle
Next, we have this fitness

00:30:47.226 --> 00:30:48.726 A:middle
trainer app that provides me a

00:30:48.726 --> 00:30:49.936 A:middle
nice reminder to go out and do

00:30:49.936 --> 00:30:51.446 A:middle
my evening run.

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:54.396 A:middle
And finally, there's this travel

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:56.396 A:middle
guide app that tries to surface

00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:57.486 A:middle
interesting locations of

00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
interest while I'm out and about

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.466 A:middle
so I can make sure to go check

00:30:59.506 --> 00:30:59.796 A:middle
them out.

00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:02.416 A:middle
And so, each of these three

00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:04.286 A:middle
different apps falls into one of

00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:05.566 A:middle
these, kind of, three different

00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:06.456 A:middle
categories that we have.

00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.526 A:middle
The first one is what we call

00:31:08.526 --> 00:31:09.056 A:middle
"Downtime."

00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:10.556 A:middle
And so, this is something that

00:31:10.556 --> 00:31:11.886 A:middle
doesn't have a concrete time or

00:31:11.886 --> 00:31:13.996 A:middle
location associated with it.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:15.786 A:middle
When I want to interact with

00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.266 A:middle
this recipes app may vary from

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:18.266 A:middle
when you want to interact with

00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:19.036 A:middle
this particular app.

00:31:19.876 --> 00:31:21.026 A:middle
Whereas, this fitness trainer

00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:22.756 A:middle
app has a very concrete time

00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:23.676 A:middle
associated with it, right?

00:31:24.036 --> 00:31:25.716 A:middle
I've gone and configured that 8

00:31:25.756 --> 00:31:27.036 A:middle
P.M. is the perfect time to be

00:31:27.036 --> 00:31:28.806 A:middle
surfacing this reminder to me.

00:31:29.756 --> 00:31:31.016 A:middle
And, by giving this information

00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:33.186 A:middle
to the system, we can much more

00:31:33.186 --> 00:31:34.936 A:middle
accurately rank this particular

00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:35.996 A:middle
relevant shortcut against

00:31:35.996 --> 00:31:36.986 A:middle
everything else that we have to

00:31:36.986 --> 00:31:37.436 A:middle
consider.

00:31:39.246 --> 00:31:40.706 A:middle
Similarly, this travel guide app

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.616 A:middle
knows where they want to be

00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:44.176 A:middle
surfacing their particular

00:31:44.176 --> 00:31:45.066 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, right?

00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:46.456 A:middle
They know all the locations of

00:31:46.456 --> 00:31:47.566 A:middle
interest, in this case,

00:31:47.566 --> 00:31:48.296 A:middle
Golden Gate Park.

00:31:48.916 --> 00:31:50.126 A:middle
And again, by passing that

00:31:50.126 --> 00:31:51.746 A:middle
information to the system, we

00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:54.026 A:middle
can much more accurately predict

00:31:54.096 --> 00:31:55.336 A:middle
the relevance of this particular

00:31:55.336 --> 00:31:55.776 A:middle
shortcut.

00:31:58.576 --> 00:31:59.736 A:middle
And, to provide this additional

00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:01.016 A:middle
context to the system, whether

00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:01.016 A:middle
context to the system, whether

00:32:01.016 --> 00:32:02.286 A:middle
that be a concrete time,

00:32:02.286 --> 00:32:03.796 A:middle
location, or other information,

00:32:04.516 --> 00:32:06.316 A:middle
you can provide that through the

00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:07.346 A:middle
relevanceProvider API.

00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:08.926 A:middle
And so, this allows you to

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.736 A:middle
indicate hints to the system at

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:12.086 A:middle
when your content is most

00:32:12.086 --> 00:32:13.226 A:middle
important to your users.

00:32:15.896 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
It also allows you to surface

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:18.586 A:middle
new content that users may not

00:32:18.586 --> 00:32:19.296 A:middle
have seen before.

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:21.306 A:middle
Since you're providing this

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.646 A:middle
additional hints to the system,

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:24.556 A:middle
we don't need to have seen as

00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:26.166 A:middle
much of the user's past behavior

00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:27.616 A:middle
and consistency before the

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:28.986 A:middle
system becomes confident that

00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:30.216 A:middle
this is something the user cares

00:32:30.216 --> 00:32:30.466 A:middle
about.

00:32:33.056 --> 00:32:34.826 A:middle
But, it's also important to keep

00:32:34.826 --> 00:32:36.816 A:middle
in mind that user engagement is

00:32:36.816 --> 00:32:38.496 A:middle
taken into account at every step

00:32:38.496 --> 00:32:39.256 A:middle
of the process.

00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:40.626 A:middle
If you provide relevance

00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:42.026 A:middle
providers or not, we want to

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.036 A:middle
make sure that the content that

00:32:43.036 --> 00:32:44.416 A:middle
we're surfacing is stuff that

00:32:44.416 --> 00:32:44.976 A:middle
the user cares about.

00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
So, let's take another look at

00:32:51.266 --> 00:32:52.016 A:middle
this recipes app.

00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:53.376 A:middle
So, like what we talked about

00:32:53.376 --> 00:32:54.926 A:middle
earlier, there's not really a

00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:56.626 A:middle
concrete time or location

00:32:56.626 --> 00:32:58.536 A:middle
associated with it, right?

00:32:58.536 --> 00:32:59.676 A:middle
The time that I want to interact

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.346 A:middle
with this app may be for cooking

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.346 A:middle
with this app may be for cooking

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.446 A:middle
dinner, whereas for you it might

00:33:02.446 --> 00:33:03.326 A:middle
be for cooking lunch.

00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:06.336 A:middle
And so, in this case, we may

00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:08.526 A:middle
actually indicate an empty set

00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:09.566 A:middle
of relevanceProviders.

00:33:12.146 --> 00:33:13.496 A:middle
And, in this case, the system

00:33:13.496 --> 00:33:15.166 A:middle
will determine the relevance of

00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:17.016 A:middle
this particular shortcut based

00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:18.216 A:middle
on how the user's interacted

00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:19.046 A:middle
with it before.

00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:20.736 A:middle
So, for me, I always use this

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:22.096 A:middle
around 7 P.M. because that's

00:33:22.096 --> 00:33:23.436 A:middle
when I go cook dinner, so that's

00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:24.496 A:middle
when the system will start to

00:33:24.756 --> 00:33:26.356 A:middle
surface this particular relevant

00:33:26.906 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
shortcut.

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.086 A:middle
If we take a look, however, at

00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:31.446 A:middle
this fitness trainer app, which

00:33:31.746 --> 00:33:33.006 A:middle
does have a concrete time

00:33:33.006 --> 00:33:34.626 A:middle
associated with it, you can

00:33:34.626 --> 00:33:36.156 A:middle
provide that by creating a

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:37.846 A:middle
dateRelevanceProvider, and in

00:33:37.846 --> 00:33:39.406 A:middle
this case providing the 8 P.M.

00:33:39.406 --> 00:33:39.926 A:middle
start time.

00:33:42.606 --> 00:33:43.906 A:middle
And, by giving this information

00:33:43.906 --> 00:33:45.846 A:middle
to the system, we will surface

00:33:45.846 --> 00:33:47.496 A:middle
this content around a specific

00:33:47.496 --> 00:33:48.146 A:middle
time of day.

00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:50.776 A:middle
And, as you move closer and

00:33:50.776 --> 00:33:52.256 A:middle
closer and closer to 8 P.M.,

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:53.596 A:middle
this content becomes more and

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:54.656 A:middle
more relevant to the user.

00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:56.506 A:middle
So, let's look at what-- that.

00:33:57.726 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So, here's a couple cards that I

00:33:57.726 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So, here's a couple cards that I

00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:01.516 A:middle
might have on my Siri watch

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:01.786 A:middle
face.

00:34:01.856 --> 00:34:03.316 A:middle
The first is a reminder from

00:34:03.316 --> 00:34:06.096 A:middle
Calendar for a prep meeting for

00:34:06.656 --> 00:34:06.946 A:middle
this talk.

00:34:06.946 --> 00:34:08.206 A:middle
Next, is an app that I use that

00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:10.126 A:middle
gives me interesting tidbits of

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:10.775 A:middle
space news.

00:34:11.786 --> 00:34:13.065 A:middle
And finally, we have this

00:34:13.065 --> 00:34:14.076 A:middle
fitness trainer app, so let's

00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:15.330 A:middle
focus in on that.

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:21.656 A:middle
So, I just woke up, I'm getting

00:34:21.656 --> 00:34:22.616 A:middle
ready for my day.

00:34:22.616 --> 00:34:24.016 A:middle
You know, it's, kind of, 8 A.M.

00:34:24.536 --> 00:34:25.815 A:middle
And so, you can see that this

00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:26.946 A:middle
fitness trainer app is actually

00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:28.206 A:middle
already starting to surface on

00:34:28.206 --> 00:34:29.216 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:30.896 A:middle
We want to make sure that users

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:31.916 A:middle
are, kind of, aware of all the

00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.085 A:middle
things they have going on during

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.746 A:middle
the course of the day, but it's

00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:36.396 A:middle
kind of placed much lower on the

00:34:36.396 --> 00:34:36.726 A:middle
face.

00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:37.815 A:middle
It's not the most pressing thing

00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:38.686 A:middle
to the user right now.

00:34:39.795 --> 00:34:41.096 A:middle
But, as we start moving

00:34:41.096 --> 00:34:42.896 A:middle
throughout the day, right, that

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:44.166 A:middle
calendar event that I had is no

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:45.146 A:middle
longer relevant to me.

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:46.505 A:middle
And so, this fitness trainer

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:47.696 A:middle
suggestion will start to bubble

00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:48.456 A:middle
up the face, right?

00:34:48.706 --> 00:34:49.876 A:middle
We're getting closer and closer

00:34:49.876 --> 00:34:51.246 A:middle
to 8 P.M. This content is

00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:53.226 A:middle
becoming more important to me.

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:55.556 A:middle
And, once we finally reach 8

00:34:55.556 --> 00:34:56.985 A:middle
P.M., right, this is the most

00:34:56.985 --> 00:34:57.996 A:middle
important thing to me right now.

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:59.186 A:middle
Want to make sure I don't forget

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.026 A:middle
to go for my run.

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.026 A:middle
to go for my run.

00:35:00.026 --> 00:35:02.136 A:middle
So, it'd be surfaced up at the

00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:05.926 A:middle
top of the Siri watch face.

00:35:06.056 --> 00:35:07.026 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:35:07.026 --> 00:35:08.436 A:middle
travel guide app, which again is

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:10.236 A:middle
trying to surface content around

00:35:10.306 --> 00:35:11.396 A:middle
interesting locations of

00:35:11.396 --> 00:35:12.316 A:middle
interest the user.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:15.896 A:middle
And, as you may have guessed,

00:35:15.896 --> 00:35:17.096 A:middle
you can provide this information

00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:18.086 A:middle
to the system using a

00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:19.466 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:21.646 A:middle
In this case, near Golden Gate

00:35:21.696 --> 00:35:22.006 A:middle
Park.

00:35:24.176 --> 00:35:26.006 A:middle
And, by providing this

00:35:26.006 --> 00:35:27.616 A:middle
information to the system, we

00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:29.226 A:middle
will automatically be surfacing

00:35:29.226 --> 00:35:30.746 A:middle
this content when the user

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:31.896 A:middle
starts getting close to Golden

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:32.366 A:middle
Gate Park.

00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:34.376 A:middle
And, again, as the user gets

00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:35.606 A:middle
closer and closer and closer to

00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:37.046 A:middle
Golden Gate Park, this content

00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:38.216 A:middle
becomes more relevant to them.

00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:42.216 A:middle
So, if I just arrive up in San

00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
Francisco, you can see that

00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:44.516 A:middle
we're already starting to

00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.986 A:middle
surface this suggestion to go

00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:47.006 A:middle
check out Golden Gate Park.

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:48.726 A:middle
It's displayed lower on the

00:35:48.726 --> 00:35:49.796 A:middle
face, because it's not the most

00:35:49.796 --> 00:35:50.966 A:middle
pressing thing to me right now.

00:35:50.966 --> 00:35:52.586 A:middle
But, we want to make sure that

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:54.166 A:middle
the user is aware about this.

00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:57.466 A:middle
And, as I move closer and closer

00:35:57.466 --> 00:35:58.756 A:middle
to Golden Gate Park, this

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:00.156 A:middle
content becomes more relevant to

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:00.156 A:middle
content becomes more relevant to

00:36:00.156 --> 00:36:01.806 A:middle
me, until I've finally arrived,

00:36:01.806 --> 00:36:03.296 A:middle
and I can really easily tap on

00:36:03.296 --> 00:36:04.986 A:middle
this to dive into more details,

00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:05.986 A:middle
and check out what are the

00:36:05.986 --> 00:36:06.986 A:middle
things I can do while I'm at

00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:07.656 A:middle
Golden Gate Park.

00:36:10.036 --> 00:36:11.076 A:middle
When you're creating your

00:36:11.076 --> 00:36:12.696 A:middle
locationRelevanceProviders, you

00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:14.056 A:middle
provide to the system a

00:36:14.056 --> 00:36:14.616 A:middle
CLRegion.

00:36:15.226 --> 00:36:16.036 A:middle
And so, this allows you to

00:36:16.036 --> 00:36:17.306 A:middle
indicate two important

00:36:17.306 --> 00:36:17.856 A:middle
properties.

00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:19.826 A:middle
The first is the actual

00:36:19.826 --> 00:36:21.666 A:middle
coordinates, the lat, long that

00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.636 A:middle
you're interested in surfacing

00:36:22.636 --> 00:36:24.286 A:middle
your content, along with the

00:36:24.286 --> 00:36:24.806 A:middle
radius.

00:36:25.156 --> 00:36:26.536 A:middle
So, how close does the user need

00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:27.946 A:middle
to be before this content is

00:36:27.946 --> 00:36:30.946 A:middle
relevant to them?

00:36:31.476 --> 00:36:32.746 A:middle
There's also a couple properties

00:36:32.746 --> 00:36:34.626 A:middle
in CLRegion that you can use to,

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:36.546 A:middle
kind of, adjust how the system

00:36:36.576 --> 00:36:37.486 A:middle
interprets your region.

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:40.106 A:middle
The first one is notifyOnEntry.

00:36:40.686 --> 00:36:42.036 A:middle
So, as the name might suggest,

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:43.806 A:middle
the system waits until the user

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:45.186 A:middle
has entered into this region

00:36:45.186 --> 00:36:46.496 A:middle
before this piece of content

00:36:46.496 --> 00:36:47.656 A:middle
becomes relevant to the user.

00:36:49.726 --> 00:36:51.076 A:middle
Similarly, there's a

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:52.766 A:middle
notifyOnExit property that you

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:54.516 A:middle
can set, where the system will

00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:55.986 A:middle
wait until the user has left

00:36:56.056 --> 00:36:57.286 A:middle
this particular region before

00:36:57.286 --> 00:36:58.556 A:middle
this content becomes relevant.

00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:01.376 A:middle
We actually use both these two

00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:01.376 A:middle
We actually use both these two

00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:02.696 A:middle
properties with the existing

00:37:02.696 --> 00:37:04.266 A:middle
location based reminders on the

00:37:04.266 --> 00:37:06.036 A:middle
Siri watch face, to get, kind

00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:07.686 A:middle
of, a geofencing-like behavior.

00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:12.106 A:middle
By default on CLRegion, both

00:37:12.106 --> 00:37:13.096 A:middle
these properties are set to

00:37:13.096 --> 00:37:13.476 A:middle
"true."

00:37:14.016 --> 00:37:15.386 A:middle
And, in that case, we'll

00:37:15.706 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
smoothly interpolate the

00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:18.766 A:middle
relevance based on how close the

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:19.806 A:middle
user is to a particular

00:37:19.806 --> 00:37:20.346 A:middle
location.

00:37:21.716 --> 00:37:24.506 A:middle
And so, creating your CLRegion

00:37:24.556 --> 00:37:25.306 A:middle
is really easy.

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:27.866 A:middle
In this example, we're creating

00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:29.396 A:middle
one around Apple Park, so I've

00:37:29.486 --> 00:37:30.386 A:middle
brought in the coordinates for

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:32.546 A:middle
Apple Park, along with the

00:37:32.546 --> 00:37:33.026 A:middle
radius.

00:37:33.026 --> 00:37:34.256 A:middle
So, how close do I need to be?

00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:35.826 A:middle
In this case, 2 kilometers.

00:37:36.276 --> 00:37:39.366 A:middle
Next, I will go adjust the

00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:40.926 A:middle
notifyOnEntry, notifyOnExit

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:42.066 A:middle
properties as they make sense

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:42.836 A:middle
for my use case.

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:44.836 A:middle
And, once I have my region fully

00:37:44.836 --> 00:37:46.846 A:middle
configured, I can really easily

00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:47.266 A:middle
create a

00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:48.436 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:52.276 A:middle
A couple of quick notes about

00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:53.616 A:middle
the locationRelevanceProvider.

00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:56.086 A:middle
In order to use it, your app

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.596 A:middle
needs location authorization,

00:37:57.736 --> 00:37:58.796 A:middle
otherwise we're going to ignore

00:37:58.796 --> 00:37:59.326 A:middle
this particular

00:37:59.326 --> 00:38:00.606 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:37:59.326 --> 00:38:00.606 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:38:01.316 --> 00:38:03.366 A:middle
And, to preserve user battery

00:38:03.366 --> 00:38:04.706 A:middle
life, the number of location

00:38:04.706 --> 00:38:05.906 A:middle
updates we get during the course

00:38:05.906 --> 00:38:07.206 A:middle
of an hour is limited, so keep

00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:09.306 A:middle
that in mind.

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.026 A:middle
So, that's some of the ways that

00:38:12.026 --> 00:38:13.816 A:middle
you can provide concrete times

00:38:13.816 --> 00:38:15.116 A:middle
and locations to the system.

00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:16.796 A:middle
Now, let's talk about what you

00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:17.796 A:middle
can do to try to provide

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:18.566 A:middle
personalization.

00:38:19.586 --> 00:38:20.596 A:middle
So, we have this

00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:22.136 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider.

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.586 A:middle
And so, like Paul mentioned

00:38:23.586 --> 00:38:25.406 A:middle
earlier, this allows you to

00:38:25.406 --> 00:38:26.886 A:middle
surface content at meaningful

00:38:26.886 --> 00:38:28.606 A:middle
times or locations to the user.

00:38:30.456 --> 00:38:32.376 A:middle
And, these times and locations

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:33.906 A:middle
are personalized to each and

00:38:33.906 --> 00:38:34.976 A:middle
every single user of the Siri

00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:37.666 A:middle
watch face.

00:38:38.356 --> 00:38:39.266 A:middle
So, the first situation that

00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:40.356 A:middle
we'll talk about is the morning

00:38:40.356 --> 00:38:40.996 A:middle
situation.

00:38:42.566 --> 00:38:43.536 A:middle
This allows you to surface

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:44.796 A:middle
content right when the user

00:38:44.796 --> 00:38:45.596 A:middle
wakes up in the morning.

00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:47.746 A:middle
We actually already used this

00:38:47.746 --> 00:38:49.386 A:middle
for the existing first-party

00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:51.556 A:middle
weather data source on the Siri

00:38:51.556 --> 00:38:53.246 A:middle
watch face, so we can provide

00:38:53.246 --> 00:38:54.486 A:middle
the user a nice summary of the

00:38:54.486 --> 00:38:55.946 A:middle
forecast at the beginning of the

00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:57.796 A:middle
day, and it quickly dismisses,

00:38:57.796 --> 00:38:59.266 A:middle
making room for other content

00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:02.216 A:middle
they might be interested in.

00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:02.216 A:middle
they might be interested in.

00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:03.456 A:middle
We also have an evening

00:39:03.456 --> 00:39:04.136 A:middle
situation.

00:39:04.706 --> 00:39:05.726 A:middle
And so, this allows us to

00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:07.136 A:middle
surface content before the user

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:07.706 A:middle
goes to bed.

00:39:08.586 --> 00:39:10.386 A:middle
So, we use this one for the new

00:39:10.726 --> 00:39:12.956 A:middle
heart rate card in watchOS 5, so

00:39:12.956 --> 00:39:14.046 A:middle
that we can provide the user a

00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:15.246 A:middle
summary of their heart rate

00:39:15.246 --> 00:39:18.296 A:middle
activity throughout the day.

00:39:18.446 --> 00:39:19.046 A:middle
And, creating a

00:39:19.046 --> 00:39:20.406 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider is

00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:20.956 A:middle
really easy.

00:39:20.956 --> 00:39:22.436 A:middle
You've just got to specify which

00:39:22.436 --> 00:39:23.566 A:middle
situation you're interested in.

00:39:23.566 --> 00:39:25.296 A:middle
So, in this case, we can really

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.306 A:middle
easily create a

00:39:26.306 --> 00:39:27.676 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider to

00:39:27.676 --> 00:39:28.796 A:middle
surface content right when the

00:39:28.796 --> 00:39:31.286 A:middle
user wakes up.

00:39:32.206 --> 00:39:33.566 A:middle
And, the behavior for both these

00:39:33.566 --> 00:39:35.226 A:middle
two situations is very similar

00:39:35.226 --> 00:39:36.936 A:middle
to a dateLocation-- or a

00:39:36.936 --> 00:39:37.876 A:middle
dateRelevanceProvider.

00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:39.936 A:middle
Except that the system is

00:39:39.936 --> 00:39:41.706 A:middle
automatically figuring out what

00:39:41.706 --> 00:39:42.616 A:middle
are the dates that we should be

00:39:42.616 --> 00:39:43.606 A:middle
surfacing this content.

00:39:46.526 --> 00:39:47.816 A:middle
We also have a few situations

00:39:47.816 --> 00:39:49.236 A:middle
available to you that allow you

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:50.536 A:middle
to surface content in meaningful

00:39:50.536 --> 00:39:52.186 A:middle
locations to the user, whether

00:39:52.186 --> 00:39:57.086 A:middle
that be home, work, school, or

00:39:57.086 --> 00:39:57.986 A:middle
when the user arrives to the

00:39:57.986 --> 00:39:58.256 A:middle
gym.

00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:01.056 A:middle
And again, creating one of these

00:40:01.056 --> 00:40:02.436 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProviders

00:40:02.436 --> 00:40:03.206 A:middle
is really easy.

00:40:03.266 --> 00:40:04.426 A:middle
You just need to specify which

00:40:04.426 --> 00:40:05.556 A:middle
situation you're interested in.

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:09.646 A:middle
And, for all of these

00:40:09.646 --> 00:40:11.136 A:middle
situations, the behavior of this

00:40:11.136 --> 00:40:12.826 A:middle
relevanceProvider is similar

00:40:12.826 --> 00:40:13.356 A:middle
again to a

00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:14.636 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider,

00:40:14.936 --> 00:40:15.866 A:middle
except that the system is

00:40:15.866 --> 00:40:17.176 A:middle
automatically figuring out the

00:40:17.176 --> 00:40:18.186 A:middle
locations on your behalf.

00:40:19.296 --> 00:40:20.346 A:middle
And so, as the user gets closer

00:40:20.346 --> 00:40:22.046 A:middle
to these locations, your content

00:40:22.046 --> 00:40:23.616 A:middle
will become more relevant to

00:40:23.746 --> 00:40:24.436 A:middle
your users.

00:40:26.086 --> 00:40:28.626 A:middle
So, that is some of the insight

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.006 A:middle
into how we predict your

00:40:30.006 --> 00:40:31.066 A:middle
relevant shortcuts on the Siri

00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:31.656 A:middle
watch face.

00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:33.016 A:middle
And, some of the things that you

00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:34.606 A:middle
can do to provide additional

00:40:34.606 --> 00:40:36.446 A:middle
context to the system so that we

00:40:36.446 --> 00:40:37.836 A:middle
can surface your content when

00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:38.666 A:middle
it's most appropriate.

00:40:39.296 --> 00:40:41.556 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how you

00:40:41.556 --> 00:40:42.886 A:middle
can build a great experience on

00:40:42.886 --> 00:40:43.756 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:40:44.796 --> 00:40:46.076 A:middle
So, we've been working on the

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.516 A:middle
Siri watch face for a while now.

00:40:47.616 --> 00:40:48.576 A:middle
And, we've learned quite a few

00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:49.286 A:middle
things along the way.

00:40:51.556 --> 00:40:52.956 A:middle
First one of those things is

00:40:52.956 --> 00:40:54.426 A:middle
there's kind of, two high-level

00:40:54.426 --> 00:40:56.306 A:middle
categories of content that we

00:40:56.306 --> 00:40:57.656 A:middle
think works great on the Siri

00:40:57.656 --> 00:40:58.326 A:middle
watch face.

00:40:59.736 --> 00:41:00.616 A:middle
The first one of those is

00:40:59.736 --> 00:41:00.616 A:middle
The first one of those is

00:41:00.616 --> 00:41:01.716 A:middle
glanceable information.

00:41:02.346 --> 00:41:03.856 A:middle
So, being able to really easily,

00:41:03.856 --> 00:41:05.456 A:middle
on a wrist raise, get a snippet

00:41:05.456 --> 00:41:06.586 A:middle
of information that I care

00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:08.346 A:middle
about, and being able to tap on

00:41:08.346 --> 00:41:09.436 A:middle
it when it's appropriate to dive

00:41:09.436 --> 00:41:10.316 A:middle
into more details.

00:41:11.796 --> 00:41:13.596 A:middle
The second is tappable actions.

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.396 A:middle
So, being able to really easily,

00:41:15.396 --> 00:41:16.966 A:middle
from my watch face, tap on a

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:18.996 A:middle
platter, execute a complex

00:41:18.996 --> 00:41:20.306 A:middle
action, and get right back to my

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:20.506 A:middle
day.

00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:23.166 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:41:23.166 --> 00:41:24.206 A:middle
glanceable information.

00:41:24.686 --> 00:41:25.746 A:middle
So, you can see we have this

00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:26.586 A:middle
recipes app again.

00:41:27.576 --> 00:41:28.576 A:middle
And, throughout the day, when

00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:30.736 A:middle
I'm glancing at my wrist, I can

00:41:30.736 --> 00:41:31.596 A:middle
get a nice snippet of

00:41:31.596 --> 00:41:32.306 A:middle
information, right?

00:41:32.306 --> 00:41:33.906 A:middle
I can see the recipe that I

00:41:33.906 --> 00:41:35.026 A:middle
might be cooking later today.

00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:36.656 A:middle
And, I can really easily decide

00:41:36.836 --> 00:41:37.656 A:middle
is this something I want to

00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:38.626 A:middle
make, or do I want to go out

00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:38.876 A:middle
tonight?

00:41:39.926 --> 00:41:41.186 A:middle
And, when I'm getting ready to

00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.626 A:middle
go home in the evening, I can

00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:45.296 A:middle
really easily tap on it to dive

00:41:45.296 --> 00:41:46.836 A:middle
into this app and see, do I need

00:41:46.836 --> 00:41:47.706 A:middle
to stop at the grocery store on

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:47.976 A:middle
my way home?

00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:54.526 A:middle
So, if you're trying to provide

00:41:54.526 --> 00:41:55.646 A:middle
glanceable information to the

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.016 A:middle
user, there's a few things that

00:41:57.016 --> 00:41:57.956 A:middle
you want to keep in mind.

00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:00.046 A:middle
Make sure that you're surfacing

00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:00.046 A:middle
Make sure that you're surfacing

00:42:00.046 --> 00:42:02.216 A:middle
the most critical information in

00:42:02.216 --> 00:42:03.376 A:middle
your relevant shortcuts.

00:42:04.546 --> 00:42:05.826 A:middle
This is the content that users

00:42:05.826 --> 00:42:06.886 A:middle
are going to see at a wrist

00:42:06.886 --> 00:42:07.956 A:middle
raise throughout the day, and

00:42:07.956 --> 00:42:09.716 A:middle
this is the content that they

00:42:09.716 --> 00:42:10.626 A:middle
really want to see right on

00:42:10.626 --> 00:42:11.346 A:middle
their watch face.

00:42:12.636 --> 00:42:15.296 A:middle
When the user taps on your

00:42:15.296 --> 00:42:16.786 A:middle
relevant shortcut, it should be

00:42:16.786 --> 00:42:18.076 A:middle
opening up into a location

00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:19.166 A:middle
within your app, and providing

00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:20.276 A:middle
them additional details.

00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:22.616 A:middle
Accidental taps on the Siri

00:42:22.616 --> 00:42:23.946 A:middle
watch face do happen, and so,

00:42:23.946 --> 00:42:24.956 A:middle
you want to make sure you're not

00:42:24.956 --> 00:42:26.246 A:middle
kicking off any long-running

00:42:26.246 --> 00:42:27.716 A:middle
background task that the user

00:42:27.716 --> 00:42:29.266 A:middle
isn't aware of.

00:42:30.836 --> 00:42:32.306 A:middle
And, like Paul mentioned

00:42:32.306 --> 00:42:33.726 A:middle
earlier, the system will

00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:35.216 A:middle
automatically be giving you an

00:42:35.216 --> 00:42:36.416 A:middle
additional background refresh

00:42:36.416 --> 00:42:38.376 A:middle
task to go provide new content.

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.186 A:middle
Take advantage of this, so you

00:42:40.186 --> 00:42:41.796 A:middle
make sure you have relevant and

00:42:41.796 --> 00:42:43.166 A:middle
interesting content available on

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:44.086 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:42:44.626 --> 00:42:48.216 A:middle
And, whenever you get new data,

00:42:48.216 --> 00:42:49.456 A:middle
whether that be through this

00:42:49.456 --> 00:42:51.206 A:middle
background refresh task, because

00:42:51.206 --> 00:42:52.426 A:middle
you've gone to the network and

00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:53.996 A:middle
downloaded new data, or because

00:42:53.996 --> 00:42:55.156 A:middle
the user has started using your

00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:56.876 A:middle
app, make sure that you provide

00:42:56.876 --> 00:42:58.156 A:middle
new relevant shortcuts the

00:42:58.156 --> 00:42:59.826 A:middle
system can always be surfacing

00:43:00.126 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
the most interesting content to

00:43:01.316 --> 00:43:02.636 A:middle
the user right on a wrist raise.

00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:07.126 A:middle
And finally, if the information

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:08.246 A:middle
that you're trying to surface is

00:43:08.246 --> 00:43:10.606 A:middle
timely, indicate that to us

00:43:10.776 --> 00:43:12.086 A:middle
through the relevance providers,

00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:13.846 A:middle
so the system can surface your

00:43:13.846 --> 00:43:15.126 A:middle
content, again, when it's most

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:15.596 A:middle
appropriate.

00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:19.856 A:middle
And so, that is glanceable

00:43:19.856 --> 00:43:20.426 A:middle
information.

00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:21.716 A:middle
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:43:21.716 --> 00:43:23.136 A:middle
about tappable actions on the

00:43:23.136 --> 00:43:23.936 A:middle
Siri watch face.

00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:27.326 A:middle
So, you can see we have this

00:43:27.356 --> 00:43:28.356 A:middle
fitness trainer app again.

00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:30.006 A:middle
And, I can really easily, right

00:43:30.006 --> 00:43:31.426 A:middle
on my wrist, get this reminder

00:43:31.426 --> 00:43:32.266 A:middle
that I need to go out for my

00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:32.586 A:middle
run.

00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:36.156 A:middle
And tapping on it, I get this

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:37.636 A:middle
nice confirmation to make sure

00:43:37.636 --> 00:43:39.026 A:middle
that this is the actual action

00:43:39.026 --> 00:43:39.886 A:middle
that I want to execute.

00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:42.816 A:middle
And, in two taps, I can start

00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:43.376 A:middle
this workout.

00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:44.676 A:middle
I don't need to spend time

00:43:44.676 --> 00:43:46.426 A:middle
digging through apps to find

00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:47.736 A:middle
this particular fitness trainer

00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:49.326 A:middle
app, and start-- kick off my

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:49.776 A:middle
workout.

00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:51.346 A:middle
I can really easily in two taps,

00:43:51.346 --> 00:43:53.126 A:middle
right from my watch face, kick

00:43:53.126 --> 00:43:54.196 A:middle
off this workout.

00:43:57.256 --> 00:43:58.706 A:middle
So, if you're providing tappable

00:43:58.706 --> 00:43:59.936 A:middle
actions, a few things to keep in

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:00.246 A:middle
mind.

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:00.246 A:middle
mind.

00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:03.606 A:middle
Your intents are running within

00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:04.806 A:middle
your Siri extension.

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.956 A:middle
And, this allows the system to

00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:09.046 A:middle
automatically run your intents

00:44:09.156 --> 00:44:10.476 A:middle
in the background, so the user

00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:11.776 A:middle
never has to leave the Siri

00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.186 A:middle
watch face to go run your

00:44:13.186 --> 00:44:13.626 A:middle
actions.

00:44:16.066 --> 00:44:17.486 A:middle
We always display the standard

00:44:17.486 --> 00:44:19.146 A:middle
system confirmation UI, so that

00:44:19.146 --> 00:44:21.086 A:middle
users know the action they're

00:44:21.086 --> 00:44:22.096 A:middle
going to run, and we can make

00:44:22.096 --> 00:44:23.226 A:middle
sure this is what they want to

00:44:23.226 --> 00:44:24.000 A:middle
perform.

00:44:27.046 --> 00:44:28.076 A:middle
You also want to make sure that

00:44:28.076 --> 00:44:29.176 A:middle
the relevant shortcuts that

00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:30.156 A:middle
you're creating are fully

00:44:30.156 --> 00:44:32.536 A:middle
specified, so that your intents

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:33.956 A:middle
extension can handle them

00:44:33.956 --> 00:44:35.166 A:middle
without any additional user

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:35.886 A:middle
confirmation.

00:44:37.186 --> 00:44:38.896 A:middle
So that when the user taps on

00:44:38.896 --> 00:44:39.956 A:middle
one of these relevant shortcuts

00:44:39.956 --> 00:44:41.146 A:middle
on the Siri watch face, we don't

00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:42.596 A:middle
need to open up your app to

00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:43.676 A:middle
continue and get, you know,

00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:44.766 A:middle
additional information from the

00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:45.066 A:middle
user.

00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:47.136 A:middle
We can kick off your SiriKit

00:44:47.136 --> 00:44:48.516 A:middle
extension, run it in the

00:44:48.516 --> 00:44:49.786 A:middle
background, and the user can get

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:51.856 A:middle
on with their day.

00:44:52.946 --> 00:44:55.456 A:middle
And, you want to be providing

00:44:55.636 --> 00:44:57.596 A:middle
commonly used tasks within your

00:44:57.596 --> 00:44:58.986 A:middle
app as relevant shortcuts.

00:44:59.436 --> 00:45:00.636 A:middle
These are the kind of tasks that

00:44:59.436 --> 00:45:00.636 A:middle
These are the kind of tasks that

00:45:00.636 --> 00:45:01.866 A:middle
users are using your apps a lot

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.436 A:middle
for, and that they want to have

00:45:03.436 --> 00:45:04.746 A:middle
really quick and easy access to

00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:06.986 A:middle
from the watch face.

00:45:07.796 --> 00:45:09.456 A:middle
And, you also want to make sure

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.456 A:middle
that you're providing relevant

00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:11.276 A:middle
shortcuts often.

00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:13.136 A:middle
You may not know the last time

00:45:13.136 --> 00:45:14.156 A:middle
that you provided relevant

00:45:14.156 --> 00:45:16.146 A:middle
shortcuts to the system is, and

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:16.886 A:middle
you want to make sure that your

00:45:16.886 --> 00:45:18.806 A:middle
users can always access your

00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:19.826 A:middle
actions right from the Siri

00:45:19.826 --> 00:45:20.436 A:middle
watch face.

00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:22.626 A:middle
If you're going to be providing

00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:23.826 A:middle
these when your app starts up,

00:45:24.166 --> 00:45:25.576 A:middle
do it on a background thread so

00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.116 A:middle
you're not slowing down your app

00:45:27.116 --> 00:45:27.396 A:middle
launch.

00:45:28.026 --> 00:45:31.356 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about

00:45:31.566 --> 00:45:33.186 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and the ways

00:45:33.186 --> 00:45:34.416 A:middle
that you can surface your

00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:36.286 A:middle
information and actions right on

00:45:36.286 --> 00:45:37.166 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:40.456 A:middle
You want to make sure that

00:45:40.456 --> 00:45:42.286 A:middle
you're also providing relevant

00:45:42.286 --> 00:45:43.406 A:middle
and engaging content.

00:45:43.726 --> 00:45:44.846 A:middle
This is the kind of content that

00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:45.926 A:middle
users want to see right on a

00:45:45.926 --> 00:45:47.146 A:middle
wrist raise, and the kind of

00:45:47.226 --> 00:45:49.566 A:middle
content that we are surfacing on

00:45:49.566 --> 00:45:50.646 A:middle
the Siri watch face, and trying

00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:52.066 A:middle
to promote to the top.

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:55.946 A:middle
The richest experience happens

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.256 A:middle
when you have a watchOS app.

00:45:57.906 --> 00:45:59.206 A:middle
This is when the system can give

00:45:59.206 --> 00:46:00.396 A:middle
you additional background

00:45:59.206 --> 00:46:00.396 A:middle
you additional background

00:46:00.396 --> 00:46:01.886 A:middle
refresh tasks, and there's no

00:46:01.886 --> 00:46:03.516 A:middle
latency between the user tapping

00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:04.336 A:middle
on one of the relevant

00:46:04.336 --> 00:46:05.646 A:middle
shortcuts, and us beginning

00:46:05.646 --> 00:46:06.266 A:middle
execution.

00:46:08.356 --> 00:46:09.856 A:middle
If you have any questions, we

00:46:09.856 --> 00:46:11.006 A:middle
have a lab later today.

00:46:11.006 --> 00:46:12.386 A:middle
We would love to talk to you

00:46:12.386 --> 00:46:13.486 A:middle
guys about relevant shortcuts

00:46:13.486 --> 00:46:14.426 A:middle
and the Siri watch face.

00:46:15.116 --> 00:46:16.796 A:middle
And, we're really excited to see

00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:17.876 A:middle
the kinds of experiences that

00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:19.486 A:middle
you guys can create right on the

00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:20.036 A:middle
watch face.

00:46:20.716 --> 00:46:20.956 A:middle
Thank you.
