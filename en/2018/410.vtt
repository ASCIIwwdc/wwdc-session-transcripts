[ Applause ]

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:27.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright, good morning.

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:28.836 A:middle
My name is Chad Woolf.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.186 A:middle
I am a performance tools

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
engineer here at Apple and

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:32.886 A:middle
today's session 410.

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:33.976 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.336 A:middle
creating custom instruments in

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.706 A:middle
Instruments 10.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:38.666 A:middle
Today's session looks like this.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.576 A:middle
We're going to talk a little bit

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.226 A:middle
about why you might want to

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
create custom instruments.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.526 A:middle
We're going to go over the

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.406 A:middle
architecture of Instruments.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:46.366 A:middle
And we have a lot of content

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.106 A:middle
today, so we have three

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.726 A:middle
sections: Getting Started,

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.256 A:middle
Intermediate, and Advanced.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.626 A:middle
And then on the way out, we'll

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:52.956 A:middle
talk about some best practices,

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:54.036 A:middle
some of the things we've learned

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.546 A:middle
along the way, writing

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:56.346 A:middle
instruments on our own.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.846 A:middle
So the first one, why would you

00:00:58.846 --> 00:00:59.986 A:middle
want to create custom

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
instruments?

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
instruments?

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:02.576 A:middle
Instruments already ships with a

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:03.896 A:middle
lot of really powerful tools,

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.616 A:middle
for example here we have System

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:06.776 A:middle
Trace where you can see how your

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.046 A:middle
application is interacting with

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:09.086 A:middle
the scheduler and the virtual

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:09.456 A:middle
memory.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.076 A:middle
We have a new game performance

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:13.396 A:middle
template this year that combines

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:14.596 A:middle
System Trace and Metal System

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:17.496 A:middle
Trace to help you spot glitches

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.216 A:middle
and missed frames in your

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:19.776 A:middle
application.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.276 A:middle
And if you're on the network

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.916 A:middle
portion of your application, we

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:26.226 A:middle
also have the Network

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:27.166 A:middle
Connections Instrument, which

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.916 A:middle
can show you TCP/IP traffic

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:30.476 A:middle
coming in and out of your app.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.126 A:middle
And then, of course, a lot of

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.696 A:middle
you are familiar with the Time

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:34.156 A:middle
Profiler.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:35.506 A:middle
Time Profiler is a great way to

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:37.316 A:middle
see where your application is

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:38.866 A:middle
spending its time, whether that

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.006 A:middle
be the networking layer or the

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.396 A:middle
game engine or some other

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:41.826 A:middle
portion.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.756 A:middle
Now the common thing here is

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:48.896 A:middle
that these are all very useful

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:50.376 A:middle
if you know the code that you're

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.646 A:middle
profiling, right.

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:52.466 A:middle
So if you know those IP

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.416 A:middle
addresses, you know what those

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:54.856 A:middle
mean, and you know what the

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.306 A:middle
different functions mean and the

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.236 A:middle
call stack of the Time Profiler,

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.196 A:middle
it makes it a lot easier.

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.826 A:middle
But what if someone is profiling

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.826 A:middle
But what if someone is profiling

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:02.916 A:middle
your application and they're not

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.176 A:middle
familiar with their code, right?

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:05.746 A:middle
What if they just want to see is

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.216 A:middle
the application spending a lot

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:08.265 A:middle
of time in the networking layer,

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:10.086 A:middle
and, if so, what is it doing?

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.946 A:middle
Well, a good use for a custom

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
instrument would be to try to

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.886 A:middle
tell the story of what your

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.096 A:middle
layer or what your application

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.936 A:middle
is doing in a way that someone

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:21.216 A:middle
who doesn't understand the code

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:22.916 A:middle
can understand and appreciate

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:22.983 A:middle
it.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:25.986 A:middle
Now in the advanced section,

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:27.516 A:middle
we're going to show you how to

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:28.596 A:middle
take advantage of the Expert

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:30.296 A:middle
System Technology that built

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.846 A:middle
inside of Instruments so that

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.766 A:middle
you can create an instrument

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:35.366 A:middle
that's actually able to look for

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
bad patterns and spot

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.206 A:middle
anti-patterns in your code even

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:38.786 A:middle
if you're not there.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.256 A:middle
Alright, so let's take a look at

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:42.666 A:middle
the architecture that makes this

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:43.156 A:middle
possible.

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.226 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:47.996 A:middle
have to start here, back at the

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:48.406 A:middle
beginning.

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:51.276 A:middle
So in the beginning, Instruments

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:52.656 A:middle
works about the same as it does

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:52.866 A:middle
today.

00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:54.156 A:middle
There's still a library.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:55.546 A:middle
You still drag instruments out

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:56.816 A:middle
and drop them into your trace

00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.456 A:middle
document and then you press

00:02:58.456 --> 00:02:59.346 A:middle
Record and it's like running a

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
bunch of performance tools at

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
bunch of performance tools at

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:00.946 A:middle
once.

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.966 A:middle
Now the major difference between

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.646 A:middle
then and now is that back then

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:05.516 A:middle
the infrastructure of

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:06.816 A:middle
Instruments didn't really do a

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.626 A:middle
lot to help us write instruments

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:08.976 A:middle
quickly.

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.606 A:middle
And at the time, that was okay

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:12.866 A:middle
because we had already inherited

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:14.526 A:middle
quite a few assets and

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.766 A:middle
performance tools that we

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:16.336 A:middle
already had.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.956 A:middle
They all had their own recording

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:18.726 A:middle
technology and their own

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.436 A:middle
analysis logic and all we had to

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.196 A:middle
do was build a custom storage

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.266 A:middle
mechanism to get the data in the

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.506 A:middle
trace and a custom UI to help

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:26.806 A:middle
integrate it with the rest of

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:27.786 A:middle
the app.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
Now over time, the maintenance

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.126 A:middle
costs of Instruments and

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:32.736 A:middle
maintaining this model shot up.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:34.626 A:middle
And the reason for that was

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:36.526 A:middle
every time we wanted to add a

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:37.876 A:middle
new feature we had to modify

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:39.546 A:middle
seven custom UIs and seven

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:41.846 A:middle
custom storage mechanisms and

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
that's not the model we wanted

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:44.676 A:middle
you guys to inherent.

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:45.626 A:middle
We didn't want you to inherit

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:46.756 A:middle
this kind of maintenance costs.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:48.516 A:middle
So before we even talked about

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:49.646 A:middle
doing a custom Instruments'

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
feature, we needed to solve that

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:52.776 A:middle
first and I think we did.

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.556 A:middle
So in the new version of

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.186 A:middle
Instruments, instead of having

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.516 A:middle
custom UIs and custom storage

00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:58.906 A:middle
mechanisms, we have two

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.456 A:middle
standardized components and

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.456 A:middle
standardized components and

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.286 A:middle
that's the Standard UI and the

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:03.116 A:middle
Analysis Core.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:05.056 A:middle
Now the Standard UI is what

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:06.606 A:middle
implements the entire user

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:07.926 A:middle
interface of a modern Instrument

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:09.986 A:middle
and it's tightly coupled with

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
the Analysis Core.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:12.756 A:middle
The Analysis Core you can think

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:13.976 A:middle
of as a bit of a combination

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:16.476 A:middle
between a database and an expert

00:04:16.476 --> 00:04:16.906 A:middle
system.

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:18.516 A:middle
And the two these are optimized

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:19.745 A:middle
to work on time series data,

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:20.476 A:middle
which makes them a great

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:21.406 A:middle
foundation for building

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:21.966 A:middle
instruments.

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:23.786 A:middle
Now when you build an instrument

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.406 A:middle
with the modern architecture,

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.456 A:middle
really what you're doing is

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:29.236 A:middle
essentially creating a custom

00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:30.876 A:middle
configuration of both the

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:32.686 A:middle
Standard UI and the Analysis

00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:32.916 A:middle
Core.

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:35.636 A:middle
Now if you look at some of the

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:36.826 A:middle
screenshots of the powerful

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:38.286 A:middle
instruments that I showed in

00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:40.006 A:middle
beginning, we have the System

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:42.276 A:middle
Trace and we have the Game

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:44.196 A:middle
Performance template and the

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:46.676 A:middle
Network Connections template and

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:48.196 A:middle
Time Profiler.

00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:50.236 A:middle
All of the instruments in all of

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:51.416 A:middle
those documents were built

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:53.076 A:middle
completely out of the Standard

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:55.246 A:middle
UI and the Analysis Core.

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:56.616 A:middle
So you can do the exact same

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:57.586 A:middle
things that they can do.

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.236 A:middle
And in Xcode 10 and in

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.236 A:middle
And in Xcode 10 and in

00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:01.516 A:middle
Instruments 10, we're giving you

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:02.366 A:middle
the exact same tools to build

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:02.976 A:middle
your instruments.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:05.966 A:middle
So the only difference between

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:07.156 A:middle
an instrument that ships with

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:10.336 A:middle
Xcode and one that you build is

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:12.206 A:middle
just simply who built it.

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:13.846 A:middle
Now your instruments will show

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:16.116 A:middle
up here in our library and you

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.906 A:middle
can see like Activity Monitor at

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:18.266 A:middle
the top.

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:20.176 A:middle
Just like that, you can drag and

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.696 A:middle
drop your instrument into a

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.926 A:middle
trace document and take a

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:23.386 A:middle
recording.

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:25.076 A:middle
And what happens here is the

00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:26.036 A:middle
Instruments fills in the

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:27.646 A:middle
Analysis Core with data and the

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:29.436 A:middle
Standard UI reacts to create the

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:30.886 A:middle
graphs and the table views.

00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:33.696 A:middle
Now Instrument has two ways of

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
showing data.

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:35.686 A:middle
It's got the graph view at the

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:36.876 A:middle
top here, which we call a track

00:05:36.876 --> 00:05:38.486 A:middle
view, and an instrument can

00:05:38.486 --> 00:05:40.346 A:middle
define more than one graph, if

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:41.186 A:middle
it would like to.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:43.796 A:middle
And the way that you choose

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:44.776 A:middle
between the graphs that will

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:45.706 A:middle
define your instrument is

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:47.056 A:middle
there's a small control here

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:48.456 A:middle
attached to the Instrument icon

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:49.886 A:middle
and we can change this from say

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:52.106 A:middle
CPU to Networking.

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:55.966 A:middle
Now each graph is allowed to

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.036 A:middle
define a certain number of

00:05:57.036 --> 00:05:57.496 A:middle
lanes.

00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:58.926 A:middle
So here we've defined three

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
lanes, graphing three different

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
lanes, graphing three different

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:01.576 A:middle
types of CPU utilization.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.436 A:middle
And each one of these lanes is

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.906 A:middle
bound to a different table in

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:07.426 A:middle
the Analysis Core or it can be

00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:08.796 A:middle
bound to the same table but

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:09.646 A:middle
you're looking at a different

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:11.046 A:middle
column in the table.

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:14.566 A:middle
Now the other portion of the

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:16.556 A:middle
instrument is the lower portion,

00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:17.786 A:middle
which is equally as important.

00:06:17.786 --> 00:06:18.736 A:middle
It's called the Detail View.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.216 A:middle
And that's where you can see the

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:22.536 A:middle
event-by-event lists and also

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.066 A:middle
any sort of aggregations and

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.086 A:middle
summaries of your data.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.306 A:middle
Now just like the lanes, oh, I'm

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.146 A:middle
sorry, just like the graphs, you

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:32.836 A:middle
can define a number of details

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
for your instrument and you can

00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:35.536 A:middle
select which detail is active by

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:36.416 A:middle
clicking this portion of the

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.976 A:middle
jump bar and then selecting the

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:39.586 A:middle
title of detail that you define.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.616 A:middle
Now just like the lanes in the

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:44.786 A:middle
graph, all of the details are

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:46.656 A:middle
bound to again a table in the

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.016 A:middle
Analysis Core and that's where

00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:48.786 A:middle
they receive the data.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:50.006 A:middle
The recording happens.

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:50.966 A:middle
The tables fill in.

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:52.626 A:middle
And UI reacts and there's no

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:53.976 A:middle
special code needed on your

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:55.366 A:middle
behalf.

00:06:56.156 --> 00:06:58.836 A:middle
Now from the perspective of the

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
Standard UI, everything in the

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
Standard UI, everything in the

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:01.636 A:middle
Analysis Core appears to be a

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
table.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.166 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:03.986 A:middle
tables and what they are.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
Tables are collections of rows

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:07.886 A:middle
and they have a structure that's

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.516 A:middle
defined by a table schema.

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:10.746 A:middle
Right, so it's very similar to a

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:11.656 A:middle
database application.

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.106 A:middle
The schema defines the columns

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:15.396 A:middle
and the names of the columns and

00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:16.236 A:middle
also the types.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.246 A:middle
Now the Analysis Core uses a

00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:19.606 A:middle
very rich typing system called

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.296 A:middle
an engineering type and that

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.446 A:middle
both tells us how to store the

00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:24.216 A:middle
data and also how to visualize

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
it and analyze it in the

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:25.806 A:middle
Standard UI.

00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.886 A:middle
Now in addition to or while the

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:31.426 A:middle
schema describes the structure

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.246 A:middle
of a table, you can use

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.516 A:middle
attributes which are key/value

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:36.146 A:middle
pairs to describe the content.

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:37.586 A:middle
So that kind of helps us

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:38.616 A:middle
describe what goes into the

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:38.986 A:middle
table.

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:42.216 A:middle
You can think of schemas as like

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:44.606 A:middle
a class in Objective-C or Swift

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:45.596 A:middle
whereas the rows are like the

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:46.246 A:middle
instances.

00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:47.886 A:middle
And so it's important that your

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:50.236 A:middle
schema names are singular, just

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.296 A:middle
like we have class names in

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:53.516 A:middle
Objective-C that are singular,

00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:55.416 A:middle
like NSString instead of

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
strings.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.136 A:middle
So this will be more important

00:07:58.136 --> 00:07:58.906 A:middle
when we get to the advanced

00:07:58.906 --> 00:07:59.876 A:middle
section but I wanted to call it

00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
out now so we can know what

00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
out now so we can know what

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.026 A:middle
we're looking at.

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:04.336 A:middle
Okay, an example of the schema

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:05.596 A:middle
here is tick.

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.106 A:middle
This is one of schemas that

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.926 A:middle
comes inside of Instruments and

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.286 A:middle
it's used to hold a table of

00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:11.666 A:middle
synthetic clock ticks that we'll

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.676 A:middle
use later for statistical

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:15.146 A:middle
computations in our modelers.

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:17.076 A:middle
Now it is very simple.

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:18.456 A:middle
It has one column that's defined

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.956 A:middle
and that's time and it's using

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:20.626 A:middle
the engineering type

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:21.356 A:middle
sample-time.

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:24.046 A:middle
And it also defines an optional

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:25.606 A:middle
attribute that can be attached

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:26.796 A:middle
to that table instance called

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:27.346 A:middle
frequency.

00:08:27.856 --> 00:08:30.066 A:middle
So if you create a table with a

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.096 A:middle
frequency equals 10 attribute

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:34.456 A:middle
here for our tick schema, then

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:36.576 A:middle
the provider of that data knows

00:08:36.576 --> 00:08:38.046 A:middle
that it needs to fill that table

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:40.326 A:middle
with ten timestamps per second,

00:08:40.616 --> 00:08:40.806 A:middle
right.

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:41.826 A:middle
So that's a way to communicate

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:42.806 A:middle
what you want filled into the

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:43.176 A:middle
table.

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:45.916 A:middle
Now with that, I think we have

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:47.766 A:middle
enough information to help us

00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:48.366 A:middle
get started.

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.076 A:middle
So we're going to show you how

00:08:50.076 --> 00:08:52.256 A:middle
to create your own Instruments

00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.046 A:middle
package project in Xcode and

00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:54.906 A:middle
we're going to show you how to

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:55.876 A:middle
create your very first

00:08:55.876 --> 00:08:57.316 A:middle
instrument that graphs these

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.196 A:middle
ticks and shows these ticks in

00:08:59.196 --> 00:08:59.886 A:middle
the detail view.

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:01.916 A:middle
And to do that, I would like to

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.016 A:middle
call up my colleague Kacper to

00:09:04.016 --> 00:09:04.976 A:middle
give you guys a demonstration.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:09.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, everyone.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:12.136 A:middle
Now I will show you how to start

00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:13.986 A:middle
with creating and running your

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.306 A:middle
first custom instrument.

00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.356 A:middle
You're going to be using tick

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.426 A:middle
schema presented by Chad to

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.096 A:middle
craft instruments during ticks

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.556 A:middle
with constant frequency.

00:09:23.256 --> 00:09:25.426 A:middle
You will learn how to describe

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.556 A:middle
your package, iterate on it

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:29.576 A:middle
using Xcode, and tested in

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:30.116 A:middle
Instruments.

00:09:31.156 --> 00:09:31.866 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
You create your new Instruments

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.596 A:middle
packets project just like you

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:37.976 A:middle
used to in Xcode.

00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:40.216 A:middle
You go to a New Xcode Project,

00:09:40.996 --> 00:09:42.776 A:middle
select macOS platform, and

00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:43.706 A:middle
Instruments Package.

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:46.146 A:middle
You need to fill out your

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:47.566 A:middle
product name, which will become

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:48.586 A:middle
default name for your

00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:49.566 A:middle
Instruments Package.

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:51.016 A:middle
Let's call it ticks.

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:54.966 A:middle
Hit Next and Create.

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:01.626 A:middle
Xcode has created project with

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:01.626 A:middle
Xcode has created project with

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:03.656 A:middle
package target and one file,

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:05.706 A:middle
package definition.

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:09.286 A:middle
Let's look in to it.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.996 A:middle
Packages are described in

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:13.406 A:middle
XML-based syntax.

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.626 A:middle
At the beginning, each package

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:18.506 A:middle
contains identifier, title, and

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:18.846 A:middle
owner.

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.146 A:middle
These fields will be visible

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:22.436 A:middle
when someone attempts to install

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:23.076 A:middle
your package.

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.466 A:middle
Usually, you would start by

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.736 A:middle
defining your own schema and

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.546 A:middle
optionally modeler but because

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
here we are going to be using

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.776 A:middle
predefined tick schema, let's

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.576 A:middle
remove these guides.

00:10:38.876 --> 00:10:41.416 A:middle
To import tick schema from base

00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:43.176 A:middle
package, all you need to do is

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.926 A:middle
to specify import schema element

00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:48.596 A:middle
and first name of the schema,

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
tick.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:55.546 A:middle
Now it's ready to be used by our

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:56.156 A:middle
Instrument.

00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:00.636 A:middle
To make defining more complex

00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:00.636 A:middle
To make defining more complex

00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:02.736 A:middle
elements easier for you, we've

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.046 A:middle
deployed a number of snippets in

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:04.466 A:middle
Xcode.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:07.206 A:middle
To use them, just start writing

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:09.146 A:middle
your element name, like

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:11.436 A:middle
instrument, and hit Return.

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:14.256 A:middle
You need to fill out your unique

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.976 A:middle
identifier for Instrument

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:22.946 A:middle
and a few properties that later

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:23.976 A:middle
appear in Instruments Library.

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:31.216 A:middle
It will be Instrument drawing

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:34.946 A:middle
ticks every 10 milliseconds.

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:41.186 A:middle
Now it's time to create a table

00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:42.696 A:middle
that will be instantiated when

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:44.416 A:middle
this instrument is dropped from

00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:46.456 A:middle
library to a trace document.

00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
Table identifier has to be

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:50.936 A:middle
unique within this instrument

00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:51.536 A:middle
definition.

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:56.116 A:middle
Let's call it tick table.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.786 A:middle
In schema-ref, we need to

00:11:57.786 --> 00:11:58.966 A:middle
reference schema that we

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
previously imported, tick.

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
previously imported, tick.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:05.986 A:middle
Now we need to define what will

00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:08.126 A:middle
appear in [inaudible] view and

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:09.556 A:middle
detail view for our instrument.

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:11.966 A:middle
I will use graph element.

00:12:12.696 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
We need to fill out title for

00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:16.596 A:middle
our graph.

00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:19.166 A:middle
I will call it ticks.

00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:21.296 A:middle
And title for our lane.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:25.816 A:middle
I need to reference table by

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:28.306 A:middle
identifier that was previously

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:30.276 A:middle
created here, so I will

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:31.256 A:middle
reference tick table.

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:36.376 A:middle
And now we will specify plotting

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:37.186 A:middle
for our graph.

00:12:38.186 --> 00:12:39.646 A:middle
I will use plot element.

00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:42.926 A:middle
And in its most basic form, it

00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.226 A:middle
requires you only to pass

00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:45.446 A:middle
mnemonic of the column that

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:46.686 A:middle
contains value to be graphed.

00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:47.746 A:middle
We will be graphing time.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:48.876 A:middle
:11

00:12:52.696 --> 00:12:53.956 A:middle
I would like all of my

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:56.776 A:middle
timestamps to be visible in a

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.156 A:middle
table.

00:12:57.826 --> 00:12:59.346 A:middle
To do this, I will use list

00:12:59.606 --> 00:12:59.976 A:middle
element.

00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:04.916 A:middle
We pass title for a list that

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:06.236 A:middle
will appear in the [inaudible]

00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:11.516 A:middle
of Instrument, table ref, just

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:12.816 A:middle
like for lane element before,

00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:15.646 A:middle
and columns that we would like

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:15.906 A:middle
to see.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.556 A:middle
Now our package is ready to be

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:24.886 A:middle
built, and run in Instruments.

00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:27.656 A:middle
To do this, you will use Xcode

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.716 A:middle
scheme run action.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:29.976 A:middle
Let's do it.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:34.936 A:middle
You can see that build error

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:35.336 A:middle
appears.

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:37.696 A:middle
You have full ID support when

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:38.916 A:middle
building instruments packages.

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:41.526 A:middle
Here, error appears in line and

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:43.426 A:middle
says that column timestamp could

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:45.386 A:middle
not be found in schema tick.

00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:46.816 A:middle
Oh, that's right, because it's

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:47.536 A:middle
not timestamp.

00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:48.616 A:middle
It's supposed to be time.

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:52.676 A:middle
I will fix it and run it again.

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:58.256 A:middle
You can see it running because

00:13:58.256 --> 00:13:59.616 A:middle
this new copy of Instruments to

00:13:59.616 --> 00:13:59.796 A:middle
appear.

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:02.226 A:middle
You can recognize the special

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:02.226 A:middle
You can recognize the special

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:03.786 A:middle
copy by having different icon.

00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:06.656 A:middle
It loads your package temporally

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.226 A:middle
only for this run session.

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.516 A:middle
It allows you to iterate on your

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.446 A:middle
package more easily.

00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:15.666 A:middle
To be sure that your package is

00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.356 A:middle
already loaded, we can check it

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.346 A:middle
out in New Package Management

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:19.686 A:middle
UI.

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:22.386 A:middle
You can find it in Instruments

00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:24.536 A:middle
Preferences and Packages

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:25.176 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:29.556 A:middle
You can see our newly created

00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:31.746 A:middle
package here along debug batch,

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:33.466 A:middle
which means that it's loaded

00:14:33.466 --> 00:14:35.736 A:middle
only temporarily.

00:14:35.736 --> 00:14:37.296 A:middle
You see also all of the system

00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:37.996 A:middle
packages here.

00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:39.916 A:middle
You can use and link against

00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
them using subtitle, visible

00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:42.196 A:middle
here.

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:46.576 A:middle
Our ticks package contains ticks

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:47.126 A:middle
instrument.

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:52.416 A:middle
So let's test it now using blank

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:52.776 A:middle
template.

00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:55.566 A:middle
I will switch my target to my

00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:55.966 A:middle
MacBook

00:15:00.456 --> 00:15:01.586 A:middle
and we'll search for my

00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:02.946 A:middle
instrument in Instruments

00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:03.386 A:middle
Library.

00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:08.106 A:middle
I will fill the ticks and it

00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:10.586 A:middle
appears here with all of the

00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
properties being filled out from

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.156 A:middle
the package definition.

00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:15.806 A:middle
Let's drag and drop it into a

00:15:15.806 --> 00:15:15.976 A:middle
trace

00:15:19.576 --> 00:15:20.976 A:middle
and record for just a second.

00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:28.486 A:middle
You can see the bottom pane was

00:15:28.486 --> 00:15:30.506 A:middle
propagated with data generated

00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:31.676 A:middle
every 10 milliseconds.

00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:35.336 A:middle
Detail and graph are coordinated

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:35.896 A:middle
with each other.

00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:37.826 A:middle
When I click on rows, you can

00:15:37.826 --> 00:15:39.766 A:middle
see inspection head moving here.

00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:42.706 A:middle
I can also zoom into a graph

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:48.806 A:middle
using Option and Click and Drag.

00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:50.316 A:middle
Here you can see the ticks are

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.656 A:middle
indeed being drawn.

00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:55.736 A:middle
That's how you create your first

00:15:55.936 --> 00:15:56.886 A:middle
Instruments Package.

00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:59.446 A:middle
Now back to Chad who will tell

00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:00.716 A:middle
you more about Standard UI.

00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:00.716 A:middle
you more about Standard UI.

00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.466 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:05.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:16:05.226 --> 00:16:05.986 A:middle
Thank you, Kacper.

00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:07.906 A:middle
Okay, so we've seen how to

00:16:07.906 --> 00:16:09.326 A:middle
create a very basic instrument.

00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:11.136 A:middle
We see how to get started with

00:16:11.326 --> 00:16:12.476 A:middle
creating your first project in

00:16:12.526 --> 00:16:12.946 A:middle
Xcode.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.126 A:middle
Now let's talk about the

00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:16.386 A:middle
different kind of graphs that we

00:16:16.386 --> 00:16:17.416 A:middle
have and the different kind of

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:18.846 A:middle
details we have and how we can

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.466 A:middle
potentially do this with real

00:16:20.466 --> 00:16:20.716 A:middle
data.

00:16:21.656 --> 00:16:23.686 A:middle
Starting with graph lanes.

00:16:24.896 --> 00:16:27.206 A:middle
So you saw how Kacper was able

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:28.626 A:middle
to define a graph and a lane

00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.266 A:middle
using what we call the plot

00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:30.636 A:middle
element.

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:34.256 A:middle
Now the plot element is a way to

00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:36.566 A:middle
tell the Standard UI that we

00:16:36.566 --> 00:16:38.016 A:middle
should be taking the entire

00:16:38.016 --> 00:16:39.816 A:middle
contents of the table and trying

00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:41.336 A:middle
to plot it in that particular

00:16:41.336 --> 00:16:41.586 A:middle
lane.

00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:44.406 A:middle
Now the way that the plot

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.536 A:middle
element determines how to graph

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:47.536 A:middle
this, what the graphing

00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:49.406 A:middle
treatment should be, is by

00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:51.186 A:middle
looking at both the schema and

00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:52.446 A:middle
the column that was targeted to

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:53.306 A:middle
take the value from.

00:16:54.026 --> 00:16:55.586 A:middle
If the schema is an interval

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:56.856 A:middle
schema, meaning that it has a

00:16:56.856 --> 00:16:58.286 A:middle
time and a duration, or if it's

00:16:58.286 --> 00:16:59.636 A:middle
a point schema, which means it

00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:01.046 A:middle
just as a timestamp, they're

00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:01.046 A:middle
just as a timestamp, they're

00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:01.816 A:middle
treated differently.

00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:04.705 A:middle
And if the column being targeted

00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:06.945 A:middle
has a magnitude, meaning that it

00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:08.296 A:middle
can draw a bar graph out of it,

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:10.026 A:middle
it will draw a bar graph like

00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:10.396 A:middle
this.

00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:13.136 A:middle
An alternative here is our Life

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:15.476 A:middle
Cycle lane where it's still an

00:17:15.476 --> 00:17:16.935 A:middle
interval schema but we're

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.756 A:middle
targeting a column that's a

00:17:18.756 --> 00:17:20.366 A:middle
state and the state does not

00:17:20.366 --> 00:17:21.955 A:middle
inherently have a magnitude.

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.126 A:middle
So it doesn't make sense to draw

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:23.896 A:middle
a bar graph there.

00:17:24.516 --> 00:17:25.476 A:middle
So the Standard UI will

00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:27.006 A:middle
automatically pick a state style

00:17:27.006 --> 00:17:28.976 A:middle
treatment which involves drawing

00:17:28.976 --> 00:17:31.626 A:middle
these intervals with a label in

00:17:31.626 --> 00:17:33.096 A:middle
a rounded rectangle style so you

00:17:33.096 --> 00:17:34.776 A:middle
can tell it apart from just a

00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:35.656 A:middle
flat bar graph.

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:37.296 A:middle
Now it's really important that

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:38.336 A:middle
the Standard UI be able to pick

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:39.796 A:middle
these treatments for you because

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:41.406 A:middle
that's what keeps Instruments UI

00:17:41.406 --> 00:17:42.086 A:middle
consistent.

00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:43.616 A:middle
So if you define a state graph

00:17:43.616 --> 00:17:45.356 A:middle
and we define a state graph, the

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:46.896 A:middle
Standard UI will enforce that

00:17:46.896 --> 00:17:48.046 A:middle
they look the same way, which

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:49.686 A:middle
makes it a lot easier for user

00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:51.526 A:middle
of Instruments to move from

00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:54.496 A:middle
instrument to instrument.

00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:57.156 A:middle
Now if you want to create graphs

00:17:57.156 --> 00:17:58.236 A:middle
or the number of lanes

00:17:58.236 --> 00:17:59.606 A:middle
dynamically, based on the

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:00.926 A:middle
contents of the data, you can

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:00.926 A:middle
contents of the data, you can

00:18:00.926 --> 00:18:01.866 A:middle
define what's called a plot

00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:02.326 A:middle
template.

00:18:02.996 --> 00:18:04.666 A:middle
Now a plot template is defined

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.316 A:middle
very similarly to a plot except

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:07.406 A:middle
there's an extra element in

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:08.936 A:middle
there that allows you to choose

00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:10.536 A:middle
a column in the table and it

00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.276 A:middle
will create a separate row for

00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:13.566 A:middle
each unique value in that

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:13.956 A:middle
column.

00:18:16.016 --> 00:18:17.046 A:middle
Now if you're looking for just

00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:18.456 A:middle
spikes or periods of activity,

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:19.126 A:middle
we have what's called a

00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:21.016 A:middle
histogram and what you can do is

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:22.846 A:middle
break the timeline over certain

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.066 A:middle
size buckets, let's say 100

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:25.566 A:middle
milliseconds, and then use

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.176 A:middle
functions like count or sum or

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.996 A:middle
min or max to sort of drive up

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:31.186 A:middle
the magnitude of those buckets

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:32.976 A:middle
as the different points or

00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:33.946 A:middle
intervals are intersecting.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.066 A:middle
So it's a great way to look for

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:38.136 A:middle
spikes in activity such as here

00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:39.046 A:middle
in the System Trace where we're

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:40.216 A:middle
looking for spikes of activity

00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:41.746 A:middle
in context switches or virtual

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.086 A:middle
memory.

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:45.126 A:middle
Now let's talk about details.

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:46.926 A:middle
Details are on the lower half of

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:47.396 A:middle
the UI.

00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:49.376 A:middle
And you've already seen the

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:50.626 A:middle
first one, which is the List.

00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:52.266 A:middle
That's very simple mapping

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:53.666 A:middle
between the Table and Analysis

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
Core and a table view in the UI.

00:18:56.896 --> 00:19:00.066 A:middle
We also have aggregations.

00:18:56.896 --> 00:19:00.066 A:middle
We also have aggregations.

00:19:00.176 --> 00:19:01.976 A:middle
And aggregations are nice when

00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:03.186 A:middle
you want to try to subtract out

00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:04.586 A:middle
the time component and you want

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.396 A:middle
to look at your data in

00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:05.906 A:middle
aggregate.

00:19:05.906 --> 00:19:06.726 A:middle
You want to apply some

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:07.956 A:middle
statistics to everything that's

00:19:07.956 --> 00:19:08.556 A:middle
in that table.

00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:10.406 A:middle
And so when we define an

00:19:10.406 --> 00:19:12.316 A:middle
aggregation, what we're doing is

00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:13.966 A:middle
the columns this time are now

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:14.596 A:middle
functions.

00:19:14.896 --> 00:19:15.956 A:middle
So you can use functions like

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:19.186 A:middle
sum, average, count, and several

00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:20.436 A:middle
other statistical functions to

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:24.396 A:middle
help you create the aggregation

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.256 A:middle
view that you want to create.

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:29.576 A:middle
Now the nice part about

00:19:29.716 --> 00:19:30.776 A:middle
aggregations is that you can

00:19:30.776 --> 00:19:32.096 A:middle
define a hierarchy as well.

00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:33.846 A:middle
So here we've defined a process

00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:35.296 A:middle
thread in virtual memory

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:37.316 A:middle
operation hierarchy, so we can

00:19:37.316 --> 00:19:38.976 A:middle
see these totals broken down by

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:40.626 A:middle
the process and then by each

00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:41.766 A:middle
thread that's in that process

00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:43.286 A:middle
and then by each type of

00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:45.156 A:middle
operation that's in that thread,

00:19:45.246 --> 00:19:46.036 A:middle
in that process.

00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:47.556 A:middle
So aggregation is a really nice,

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:49.156 A:middle
powerful way to look at a lot of

00:19:49.156 --> 00:19:50.386 A:middle
data in summary.

00:19:51.476 --> 00:19:53.396 A:middle
Now another type of aggregation

00:19:53.396 --> 00:19:54.476 A:middle
is called Call Tree.

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:56.696 A:middle
Now the Call Tree is useful when

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:57.876 A:middle
you have a column that is a

00:19:57.876 --> 00:19:59.466 A:middle
backtrace and you got another

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:00.246 A:middle
column that's a weight.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:00.246 A:middle
column that's a weight.

00:20:00.476 --> 00:20:01.316 A:middle
You can create weighted

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:02.556 A:middle
backtrace or a weighted Call

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:04.546 A:middle
Tree view using the Call Tree

00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:05.976 A:middle
like you see in Time Profiler.

00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:09.406 A:middle
Now another style is called a

00:20:09.406 --> 00:20:09.896 A:middle
narrative.

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.426 A:middle
And the narrative is used when

00:20:12.426 --> 00:20:14.166 A:middle
you want to convey information

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:15.506 A:middle
that's just best left to

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.046 A:middle
technical language, such as the

00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:18.526 A:middle
output of an expert system and

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:19.696 A:middle
that works hand-in-hand with the

00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:21.346 A:middle
narrative engineering type.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.776 A:middle
Now the last type of detail here

00:20:25.866 --> 00:20:26.956 A:middle
is called a time slice.

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.346 A:middle
The time slice looks very much

00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.176 A:middle
like a list except the contents

00:20:30.176 --> 00:20:31.866 A:middle
are filtered to include only the

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.506 A:middle
intervals that intersect with

00:20:33.506 --> 00:20:34.636 A:middle
that blue line you see on the

00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
graph.

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.116 A:middle
That's called the inspection

00:20:36.116 --> 00:20:36.366 A:middle
head.

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:37.866 A:middle
So as you move the inspection

00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:39.436 A:middle
head over the graph, the

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.756 A:middle
contents of the list will be

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.586 A:middle
filtered to match what

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:44.056 A:middle
intersects with that inspection

00:20:44.056 --> 00:20:44.226 A:middle
head.

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.156 A:middle
Now all of these UIs are bound

00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:50.896 A:middle
to tables in the Analysis Core.

00:20:51.306 --> 00:20:53.146 A:middle
And when you hit Record, the

00:20:53.146 --> 00:20:54.266 A:middle
data comes in through the

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:55.586 A:middle
Instruments app and fills in the

00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:57.176 A:middle
data in the Analysis Core.

00:20:57.936 --> 00:20:59.396 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit more

00:20:59.396 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
about how that process works.

00:20:59.396 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
about how that process works.

00:21:02.786 --> 00:21:04.226 A:middle
The first step before you can

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:06.996 A:middle
press Record is the Analysis

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.416 A:middle
Core will be taking the tables

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:09.796 A:middle
that are created within it and

00:21:09.796 --> 00:21:11.006 A:middle
it'll be mapping it and

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:12.576 A:middle
allocating storage for it in the

00:21:12.576 --> 00:21:12.916 A:middle
core.

00:21:13.756 --> 00:21:15.236 A:middle
Now if a table has the exact

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:16.516 A:middle
same schema and the exact same

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:17.796 A:middle
attributes, then by definition

00:21:17.796 --> 00:21:19.686 A:middle
it's the exact same data, so

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:21.126 A:middle
it's going to map to the exact

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:21.696 A:middle
same store.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.956 A:middle
Now for each store, the second

00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:26.406 A:middle
step is to try to find a

00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:27.386 A:middle
provider for the data.

00:21:27.776 --> 00:21:29.056 A:middle
Now sometimes we can record that

00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:30.196 A:middle
directly from the target through

00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:32.196 A:middle
the data stream and sometimes we

00:21:32.196 --> 00:21:33.346 A:middle
have to synthesize the data

00:21:33.486 --> 00:21:34.246 A:middle
using a modeler.

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:36.876 A:middle
Now modelers can require their

00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:38.556 A:middle
own inputs and those inputs can

00:21:38.556 --> 00:21:40.356 A:middle
be the outputs of other modelers

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:41.596 A:middle
or they can be recorded directly

00:21:41.596 --> 00:21:42.926 A:middle
from the data stream and that's

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.186 A:middle
how we synthesize the rest of

00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:45.476 A:middle
the data that we don't know how

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:46.366 A:middle
to directly record.

00:21:47.476 --> 00:21:49.516 A:middle
Now once we've got data sources

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.546 A:middle
for all of the stores in the

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.786 A:middle
Analysis Core, that's what's

00:21:53.786 --> 00:21:54.866 A:middle
called the binding solution.

00:21:55.026 --> 00:21:56.026 A:middle
And so the third step is to

00:21:56.026 --> 00:21:57.356 A:middle
optimize the binding solution.

00:21:57.546 --> 00:21:58.806 A:middle
And here you see Instruments is

00:21:58.806 --> 00:21:59.966 A:middle
visualizing its own binding

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:01.546 A:middle
solution for what we call the

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:01.546 A:middle
solution for what we call the

00:22:01.546 --> 00:22:02.216 A:middle
thread narrative.

00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:04.736 A:middle
Now the next part about the

00:22:04.736 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
binding solution is that it's

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:09.056 A:middle
trace-wide and so as you're

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:09.916 A:middle
dragging and dropping

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:11.196 A:middle
instruments into the trace,

00:22:11.386 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
Instruments is computing the

00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:15.956 A:middle
best possible recording solution

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.616 A:middle
to try to minimize the recording

00:22:17.616 --> 00:22:20.336 A:middle
impact on the target.

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:21.786 A:middle
Now when you create your own

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:23.256 A:middle
tables or when you create table

00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:24.196 A:middle
instances, you have to give them

00:22:24.196 --> 00:22:24.616 A:middle
a schema.

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:26.706 A:middle
And Instruments already has over

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.786 A:middle
100 schemas defined.

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:30.896 A:middle
And all of these schemas are

00:22:30.896 --> 00:22:31.956 A:middle
available to you and are

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.016 A:middle
contained in the packages that

00:22:33.016 --> 00:22:33.896 A:middle
you saw in the Package

00:22:33.896 --> 00:22:34.506 A:middle
Management UI.

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:36.376 A:middle
You can just simply import the

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:38.466 A:middle
schema into your own package.

00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:41.216 A:middle
Now if that schema is contained

00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:42.516 A:middle
in a package that's not the base

00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:44.246 A:middle
package, you have to also link

00:22:44.246 --> 00:22:45.756 A:middle
that package as a build setting

00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:47.086 A:middle
in Xcode for Linked Instruments

00:22:47.086 --> 00:22:49.046 A:middle
Packages that you can set so

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.116 A:middle
that we can find that extra

00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:51.526 A:middle
package that you're referring to

00:22:51.526 --> 00:22:52.746 A:middle
at build time and do some type

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:53.096 A:middle
checking.

00:22:54.716 --> 00:22:56.276 A:middle
Now because all of these schemas

00:22:56.276 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
are defined in other packages

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.346 A:middle
when you hit Record, all the

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
tables with those schemas will

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
tables with those schemas will

00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
fill in because they either have

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.026 A:middle
modelers defined or we know how

00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:04.866 A:middle
to record it from the data

00:23:04.866 --> 00:23:05.176 A:middle
stream.

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:06.426 A:middle
So these make excellent building

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.766 A:middle
blocks for your own instruments

00:23:08.216 --> 00:23:09.016 A:middle
but even better they make

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:10.856 A:middle
excellent inputs for writing

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:11.706 A:middle
your own modelers.

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:14.356 A:middle
Now you write a modeler or you

00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:15.316 A:middle
define a modeler in your

00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.896 A:middle
Instruments Package with the

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:19.046 A:middle
modeler element and you can also

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:22.236 A:middle
create a custom output schema

00:23:22.346 --> 00:23:23.676 A:middle
for that modeler.

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:25.616 A:middle
You can use the point-schema for

00:23:25.616 --> 00:23:27.336 A:middle
just a single point in time or

00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.416 A:middle
you can use the interval schema

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:29.276 A:middle
if you have a point and a

00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:29.726 A:middle
duration.

00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:33.216 A:middle
Now the modeler is able to

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:35.126 A:middle
define what inputs it needs and

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:36.266 A:middle
this is what tells the binding

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:37.906 A:middle
solution how to fill out the

00:23:37.906 --> 00:23:39.706 A:middle
rest of that data flow graph.

00:23:39.706 --> 00:23:41.976 A:middle
And so your modeler will snap

00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:43.076 A:middle
right into the binding solution.

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:45.756 A:middle
Now modelers are actually

00:23:45.756 --> 00:23:47.576 A:middle
miniature expert systems and

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:48.626 A:middle
they are written in the Clips

00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:50.136 A:middle
language, which means that

00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:52.006 A:middle
they're very powerful but

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
they're also pretty advanced.

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:54.346 A:middle
So we're going to save the

00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:55.896 A:middle
details on how to create

00:23:55.896 --> 00:23:57.106 A:middle
modelers for the advanced

00:23:57.106 --> 00:24:00.366 A:middle
section; however, it is really

00:23:57.106 --> 00:24:00.366 A:middle
section; however, it is really

00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:01.336 A:middle
important that you be able to

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:02.856 A:middle
define your own schemas and we

00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:04.826 A:middle
have a new os signpost API this

00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:06.696 A:middle
year, which is a great way to

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:07.736 A:middle
get data into Instruments.

00:24:08.596 --> 00:24:10.206 A:middle
So we've created a little bit of

00:24:10.206 --> 00:24:10.756 A:middle
a shortcut.

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:13.236 A:middle
Inside your package, you can

00:24:13.236 --> 00:24:14.246 A:middle
define what's called an os

00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:16.346 A:middle
signpost interval schema and

00:24:16.346 --> 00:24:17.616 A:middle
what that does is both define

00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:20.046 A:middle
schema and also give us enough

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:22.006 A:middle
instructions to be able to

00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:23.446 A:middle
generate a modeler on your

00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:23.616 A:middle
behalf.

00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:25.686 A:middle
Now inside there, you can

00:24:25.686 --> 00:24:26.776 A:middle
capture the data that you

00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:28.856 A:middle
recorded in the metadata of your

00:24:28.856 --> 00:24:31.926 A:middle
os signpost calls and you can

00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:33.986 A:middle
use that captured metadata and

00:24:33.986 --> 00:24:35.776 A:middle
expressions to define how we

00:24:35.776 --> 00:24:38.026 A:middle
should fill out the columns of

00:24:38.236 --> 00:24:38.796 A:middle
your schema.

00:24:39.816 --> 00:24:41.716 A:middle
So we'll look at a really simple

00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:42.196 A:middle
example.

00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:44.556 A:middle
Let's say we're going to do JSON

00:24:44.556 --> 00:24:46.776 A:middle
decoding and we have a signpost

00:24:47.026 --> 00:24:48.156 A:middle
that we mark the beginning of

00:24:48.156 --> 00:24:50.726 A:middle
that decoding activity and the

00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:52.186 A:middle
end of that decoding activity.

00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:54.276 A:middle
And in the beginning, we'll also

00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:55.936 A:middle
capture some metadata to

00:24:55.936 --> 00:24:57.676 A:middle
indicate the size of the JSON

00:24:57.676 --> 00:24:59.046 A:middle
object that we're about to try

00:24:59.046 --> 00:24:59.526 A:middle
to parse.

00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:01.956 A:middle
Now in your Instruments Package

00:25:01.956 --> 00:25:03.496 A:middle
definition, you can create an os

00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
signpost interval schema and you

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:08.126 A:middle
define the name of your schema

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:08.396 A:middle
here.

00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:11.656 A:middle
You select which signpost you

00:25:11.656 --> 00:25:12.726 A:middle
would like to have recorded,

00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:14.626 A:middle
including the signpost name, and

00:25:15.086 --> 00:25:16.806 A:middle
then here you can use a syntax

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.456 A:middle
to capture the different pieces

00:25:18.456 --> 00:25:20.186 A:middle
of metadata from your start

00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:21.586 A:middle
metadata message.

00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:22.986 A:middle
And here, we're going to take

00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:24.526 A:middle
that captured value and we're

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:25.296 A:middle
going to use that as the

00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:27.016 A:middle
expression to teach us how to

00:25:27.016 --> 00:25:28.956 A:middle
fill in the column for data size

00:25:28.956 --> 00:25:30.106 A:middle
that we just defined in line

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:30.256 A:middle
here.

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:35.756 A:middle
Now in Session 405, which is

00:25:35.756 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
Measuring Performance Using

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.816 A:middle
Logging, I demonstrated the

00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
Trailblazer application and also

00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.616 A:middle
showed you an instrument that

00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:46.056 A:middle
you guys could write based on

00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:47.366 A:middle
the signpost inside that.

00:25:47.956 --> 00:25:49.716 A:middle
And now that we know a lot more

00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:50.696 A:middle
about how to write custom

00:25:50.696 --> 00:25:52.406 A:middle
instruments, I'd like to invite

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:54.696 A:middle
Kacper back on stage to give you

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:56.136 A:middle
a demonstration and walk-through

00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:57.626 A:middle
of how we created that package.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:03.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:03.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:03.626 --> 00:26:03.986 A:middle
:15

00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:04.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chad.

00:26:09.836 --> 00:26:12.576 A:middle
So Trailblazer app is an iOS app

00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:14.676 A:middle
that displays lists of popular

00:26:14.796 --> 00:26:16.176 A:middle
hiking trails near you.

00:26:16.856 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
As an UI component, UI table

00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:19.976 A:middle
View.

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:22.766 A:middle
Each cell loads image for a

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:24.156 A:middle
trail asynchronously.

00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:26.936 A:middle
To prevent glitches and as an

00:26:26.936 --> 00:26:28.876 A:middle
optimization when cell is

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:30.376 A:middle
reused, we cancel the download.

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.276 A:middle
To visualize my flow of

00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:35.546 A:middle
downloads, I wrap every download

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.356 A:middle
in os signpost call.

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:36.936 A:middle
Let's take a look at it.

00:26:41.536 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
When my [inaudible] cell is

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:44.796 A:middle
displayed, start Image download

00:26:44.796 --> 00:26:45.556 A:middle
method is called.

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.456 A:middle
We create downloader signpost

00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:50.946 A:middle
ID, which takes os log handle

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.466 A:middle
and downloader object.

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:55.516 A:middle
We then grab address of UI table

00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:59.366 A:middle
View cell and call os signpost

00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:03.016 A:middle
begin with os log which is

00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:03.016 A:middle
begin with os log which is

00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:04.676 A:middle
coming from signpost.networking.

00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:07.336 A:middle
Let's take a look at it.

00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.916 A:middle
This log takes our app

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:11.076 A:middle
identifier as subsystem and

00:27:11.106 --> 00:27:12.296 A:middle
networking as category.

00:27:15.046 --> 00:27:16.506 A:middle
We pass background image name,

00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:18.996 A:middle
previously created signpost ID

00:27:19.436 --> 00:27:20.886 A:middle
and message format, which

00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:22.016 A:middle
includes image name.

00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:25.276 A:middle
Here, we wrap it in public

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.406 A:middle
specifier because it's a string

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:30.056 A:middle
and caller, which is address of

00:27:30.056 --> 00:27:30.406 A:middle
a cell.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.916 A:middle
Our download could complete in

00:27:33.956 --> 00:27:35.476 A:middle
two ways, successfully.

00:27:36.106 --> 00:27:39.086 A:middle
Let's take a look at it now.

00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:40.236 A:middle
When it completes like that,

00:27:40.756 --> 00:27:42.816 A:middle
delegate method it's called.

00:27:43.866 --> 00:27:45.636 A:middle
We create signpost ID just like

00:27:45.636 --> 00:27:48.496 A:middle
before and call OS signpost end.

00:27:49.546 --> 00:27:52.186 A:middle
This time we pass status and

00:27:52.186 --> 00:27:52.556 A:middle
size.

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:56.956 A:middle
Value for status is completed.

00:27:58.256 --> 00:28:00.996 A:middle
And size is set to the image

00:27:58.256 --> 00:28:00.996 A:middle
And size is set to the image

00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:01.786 A:middle
size.

00:28:02.236 --> 00:28:04.456 A:middle
Next let's take a look at our

00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:06.166 A:middle
prepare for use overwrite.

00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:09.546 A:middle
When there's running downloader

00:28:09.546 --> 00:28:11.116 A:middle
in progress, we cancel it.

00:28:12.126 --> 00:28:14.076 A:middle
We create signpost ID and call

00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:16.006 A:middle
our signpost end with the same

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:18.016 A:middle
format string but now value is

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:20.496 A:middle
canceled and size is zero

00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:21.896 A:middle
because download didn't succeed.

00:28:22.406 --> 00:28:25.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at our os

00:28:25.446 --> 00:28:26.786 A:middle
signpost interval schema

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:28.326 A:middle
definition and how we captured

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:30.386 A:middle
those signpost end package.

00:28:32.456 --> 00:28:34.456 A:middle
We define our signpost interval

00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:36.306 A:middle
schema with unique identifier

00:28:36.306 --> 00:28:36.936 A:middle
and title.

00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:40.306 A:middle
Then we define our subsystem and

00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:41.856 A:middle
category, which corresponds to

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:43.326 A:middle
the one that we passed when

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:44.596 A:middle
creating os log handle.

00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:49.346 A:middle
We create name element, which

00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:50.846 A:middle
corresponds to the one that we

00:28:50.846 --> 00:28:53.646 A:middle
passed in os signpost call and

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:56.156 A:middle
start pattern and end pattern.

00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:58.496 A:middle
These both correspond to the one

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.296 A:middle
that we passed in os signpost

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.296 A:middle
that we passed in os signpost

00:29:00.296 --> 00:29:01.756 A:middle
begin and end calls.

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:05.966 A:middle
Message element is the same as

00:29:05.966 --> 00:29:07.596 A:middle
the format string you passed but

00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:10.326 A:middle
instead of format arguments, you

00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:12.516 A:middle
pass variables here to capture

00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:14.406 A:middle
the values that you passed when

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:15.556 A:middle
calling os signpost.

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:18.786 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we fill

00:29:18.786 --> 00:29:20.576 A:middle
out those values in our columns.

00:29:23.926 --> 00:29:26.876 A:middle
Here, you can see status column.

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:28.566 A:middle
It's type of string because it's

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.246 A:middle
either completed or canceled,

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:32.756 A:middle
and we fill it out with the

00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:34.956 A:middle
value of status variable.

00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:38.806 A:middle
Because expression element could

00:29:38.926 --> 00:29:40.826 A:middle
take arbitrary Clips expression,

00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:42.586 A:middle
we could also do more

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:44.156 A:middle
sophisticated things in it.

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.056 A:middle
Here, we could compute event

00:29:47.056 --> 00:29:49.006 A:middle
impact by looking at size.

00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:51.536 A:middle
If it's greater than 3 and 1/2

00:29:51.536 --> 00:29:53.326 A:middle
megabytes, we say that impact is

00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:56.056 A:middle
high, else impact of operation

00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:56.516 A:middle
is low.

00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
That's our definition for os

00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
That's our definition for os

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
signpost interval schema.

00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:03.376 A:middle
Now let's take a look at table

00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:04.066 A:middle
creation.

00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
For schema ref, we pass

00:30:08.096 --> 00:30:10.456 A:middle
identifier of our os signpost

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:12.616 A:middle
interval schema and create

00:30:12.616 --> 00:30:13.846 A:middle
unique identifier for this

00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:14.686 A:middle
specific table.

00:30:15.906 --> 00:30:17.736 A:middle
Then, we can reference it in our

00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
UI definitions.

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
For graph, we create a single

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:22.676 A:middle
lane.

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:26.036 A:middle
It takes our table and this time

00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:27.706 A:middle
it graphs by using the plot

00:30:27.706 --> 00:30:28.056 A:middle
template.

00:30:28.796 --> 00:30:30.586 A:middle
Plot template is dynamic way of

00:30:30.586 --> 00:30:31.476 A:middle
creating graphs.

00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:35.446 A:middle
It looks at the table, at the

00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:37.386 A:middle
column that was passed in

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:40.126 A:middle
instance by element and for each

00:30:40.226 --> 00:30:41.966 A:middle
unique value of this column, it

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:44.436 A:middle
creates plot.

00:30:44.606 --> 00:30:46.436 A:middle
Label format element allows us

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:49.606 A:middle
to create format title for this

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:49.966 A:middle
plot.

00:30:50.336 --> 00:30:52.426 A:middle
Here it's img column and the

00:30:52.426 --> 00:30:53.956 A:middle
value from image name column.

00:30:54.516 --> 00:30:57.166 A:middle
We pass image name as a value of

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:57.656 A:middle
our plot.

00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
Each of our planes will be

00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
Each of our planes will be

00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:03.166 A:middle
colored with column of impact

00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:06.076 A:middle
and label on our plane will be

00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:06.976 A:middle
taken from image size.

00:31:09.436 --> 00:31:12.796 A:middle
Next, we have a list.

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:14.726 A:middle
You already saw this one in

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:15.526 A:middle
ticks example.

00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:18.176 A:middle
Here, we pass all of the columns

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:21.286 A:middle
that you would like to see.

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.766 A:middle
Next, aggregation.

00:31:23.726 --> 00:31:25.266 A:middle
This aggregation will track all

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:26.406 A:middle
of the completed downloads.

00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:29.836 A:middle
Because our table contains both

00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:31.146 A:middle
completed and canceled

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:32.406 A:middle
downloads, we need to apply

00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:34.436 A:middle
slice element to filter some of

00:31:34.436 --> 00:31:34.836 A:middle
the data.

00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.866 A:middle
In slice element we specify

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:39.456 A:middle
column that slice will be

00:31:39.456 --> 00:31:42.066 A:middle
applied on and predicate value

00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:43.496 A:middle
that has to be matched.

00:31:43.926 --> 00:31:45.546 A:middle
Here, we want to take only

00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:47.056 A:middle
completed rows from this table.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.746 A:middle
We define hierarchy, which is

00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:52.406 A:middle
only one level hierarchy with

00:31:52.486 --> 00:31:55.276 A:middle
image name and columns that will

00:31:55.276 --> 00:31:55.836 A:middle
be visible.

00:31:56.676 --> 00:31:58.786 A:middle
For each image name, we will

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:02.156 A:middle
specify count and image size.

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:02.156 A:middle
specify count and image size.

00:32:02.156 --> 00:32:04.146 A:middle
So we will be summing sizes of

00:32:04.326 --> 00:32:04.916 A:middle
an image.

00:32:05.386 --> 00:32:09.426 A:middle
Next, we have image, time slice,

00:32:10.456 --> 00:32:10.746 A:middle
sorry.

00:32:10.746 --> 00:32:12.186 A:middle
We specify all of the columns

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:13.046 A:middle
that will be visible.

00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:18.636 A:middle
And to use our instrument more

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:22.796 A:middle
easily, we can specify our

00:32:22.796 --> 00:32:23.566 A:middle
custom template.

00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:26.876 A:middle
Now let's try and build, and run

00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:27.306 A:middle
our package.

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.946 A:middle
You can see the template appears

00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:36.336 A:middle
here.

00:32:36.396 --> 00:32:36.976 A:middle
I can choose it,

00:32:41.536 --> 00:32:43.916 A:middle
and target my iPhone and

00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:45.186 A:middle
Trailblazer app.

00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:50.976 A:middle
I will record for just a while.

00:33:00.716 --> 00:33:03.786 A:middle
You can see that track view was

00:33:03.786 --> 00:33:04.936 A:middle
propagated with data.

00:33:06.616 --> 00:33:08.746 A:middle
Each plot was created for each

00:33:08.746 --> 00:33:09.636 A:middle
image name.

00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:12.816 A:middle
You can see that label format

00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:14.366 A:middle
matches the one that we passed

00:33:14.366 --> 00:33:15.586 A:middle
in package definition.

00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:19.056 A:middle
And if download is higher rather

00:33:19.056 --> 00:33:21.176 A:middle
than 3 and 1/2 megabytes, our

00:33:21.176 --> 00:33:22.406 A:middle
plane is colored in red.

00:33:23.596 --> 00:33:25.266 A:middle
Size appears on the plane.

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:28.576 A:middle
Next, we can take a look at all

00:33:28.576 --> 00:33:30.286 A:middle
of the details.

00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:35.146 A:middle
Firstly, we have list downloads.

00:33:36.066 --> 00:33:38.096 A:middle
This is just a list of all the

00:33:38.096 --> 00:33:38.976 A:middle
downloads that happened.

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:42.346 A:middle
We can choose our aggregation,

00:33:42.866 --> 00:33:46.746 A:middle
which divides all of the

00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:48.236 A:middle
downloads by image name.

00:33:48.616 --> 00:33:49.926 A:middle
You can see that it on top we

00:33:49.926 --> 00:33:51.856 A:middle
downloaded 12 images.

00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:55.886 A:middle
And image for location seven was

00:33:55.886 --> 00:33:59.436 A:middle
downloaded two times.

00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
Next, we can take a look at

00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
Next, we can take a look at

00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:02.676 A:middle
active requests.

00:34:03.296 --> 00:34:05.166 A:middle
Here, you can see that when I'm

00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:07.386 A:middle
grabbing my inspection head,

00:34:09.356 --> 00:34:12.786 A:middle
data in detail view changes.

00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:15.835 A:middle
We can track multiple active

00:34:15.876 --> 00:34:17.505 A:middle
requests and see what was the

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
duration at the time of current

00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:20.426 A:middle
inspection head.

00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:23.976 A:middle
If you would like to take a look

00:34:23.976 --> 00:34:25.286 A:middle
at your data from different

00:34:25.536 --> 00:34:26.545 A:middle
perspective, you would like to

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:28.226 A:middle
take a look at your stores and

00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:31.056 A:middle
modelers, we give you this by

00:34:31.056 --> 00:34:32.606 A:middle
using the Instrument inspector.

00:34:33.576 --> 00:34:34.976 A:middle
This is a way to debug your

00:34:34.976 --> 00:34:36.076 A:middle
custom instruments.

00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:38.396 A:middle
Here, you can see that I

00:34:38.396 --> 00:34:41.646 A:middle
selected Stores step and I see

00:34:41.976 --> 00:34:43.416 A:middle
store for os signpost being

00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:43.876 A:middle
created.

00:34:44.556 --> 00:34:46.916 A:middle
It looks at networking category

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:48.956 A:middle
and com apple trailblazer

00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:51.846 A:middle
subsystem and we gather 24 rows

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:52.216 A:middle
here.

00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:55.376 A:middle
Then, we can see our created

00:34:55.466 --> 00:34:57.216 A:middle
table image download, which has

00:34:57.366 --> 00:34:57.896 A:middle
12 rows.

00:35:02.156 --> 00:35:04.326 A:middle
In bottom area, you see whole

00:35:04.326 --> 00:35:04.976 A:middle
content of this table.

00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:09.146 A:middle
Next, we can jump to modelers

00:35:09.546 --> 00:35:10.706 A:middle
and we can see that we have

00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:12.576 A:middle
auto-generated os log modeler

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:12.936 A:middle
here.

00:35:13.456 --> 00:35:16.606 A:middle
It took 24 rows and outputted 12

00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:16.916 A:middle
rows.

00:35:18.346 --> 00:35:19.636 A:middle
On the right, you can see

00:35:19.636 --> 00:35:20.756 A:middle
binding solution here.

00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:23.826 A:middle
So our generated os log modeler

00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.026 A:middle
took data from os signpost table

00:35:26.026 --> 00:35:27.826 A:middle
and put it into image download

00:35:27.866 --> 00:35:28.216 A:middle
table.

00:35:29.386 --> 00:35:31.296 A:middle
Then it was consumed by our

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:31.886 A:middle
instrument.

00:35:32.446 --> 00:35:35.766 A:middle
So that's how you capture your

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.966 A:middle
os signpost invocations, create

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:40.366 A:middle
UI, and look at your data using

00:35:40.366 --> 00:35:41.376 A:middle
Instrument inspector.

00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:43.866 A:middle
Now let's go back to Chad who

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:44.846 A:middle
will tell you more about

00:35:44.846 --> 00:35:45.836 A:middle
advanced modeling.

00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:50.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:55.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:35:55.326 --> 00:35:56.006 A:middle
Thank you, Kacper.

00:35:57.646 --> 00:35:59.366 A:middle
Okay, so now we've seen how you

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
can combine os signpost data

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
can combine os signpost data

00:36:01.746 --> 00:36:03.396 A:middle
with custom instruments.

00:36:03.776 --> 00:36:04.806 A:middle
And we think that you'll be able

00:36:04.806 --> 00:36:07.566 A:middle
to take this, I think you'll be

00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:08.666 A:middle
able to take these two, this

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.106 A:middle
combination pretty far.

00:36:10.886 --> 00:36:13.846 A:middle
Now, we can talk about some of

00:36:13.846 --> 00:36:15.026 A:middle
the advanced topics,

00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:16.546 A:middle
specifically how you create and

00:36:16.546 --> 00:36:18.286 A:middle
define modelers.

00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:20.466 A:middle
Now a modeler conceptually is

00:36:20.466 --> 00:36:21.296 A:middle
very simple machine.

00:36:21.296 --> 00:36:23.156 A:middle
It takes a series of inputs.

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:24.256 A:middle
It does some reasoning over

00:36:24.256 --> 00:36:25.806 A:middle
those inputs and produces

00:36:25.806 --> 00:36:26.376 A:middle
outputs.

00:36:27.326 --> 00:36:28.506 A:middle
The inputs of the modelers are

00:36:28.506 --> 00:36:30.246 A:middle
always perfectly time ordered

00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:32.116 A:middle
and so if you request several

00:36:32.116 --> 00:36:33.506 A:middle
different input tables, those

00:36:33.506 --> 00:36:34.756 A:middle
tables are first time ordered

00:36:34.756 --> 00:36:36.246 A:middle
and then merged into a

00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:38.646 A:middle
time-ordered queue, which feeds

00:36:38.646 --> 00:36:39.406 A:middle
the working memory.

00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:41.356 A:middle
So as we pull these events off

00:36:41.356 --> 00:36:42.476 A:middle
one by one, they're entered into

00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:43.776 A:middle
what's called the working memory

00:36:43.776 --> 00:36:44.356 A:middle
of the modeler.

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:47.886 A:middle
And as the modeler sees the

00:36:47.886 --> 00:36:49.306 A:middle
evolution of this working

00:36:49.306 --> 00:36:51.006 A:middle
memory, it can draw inference.

00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:52.766 A:middle
And when it sees a pattern that

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:54.086 A:middle
it wants to produce an output

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:56.206 A:middle
for, it simply writes it to its

00:36:56.206 --> 00:36:57.406 A:middle
outbound output tables.

00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:00.256 A:middle
Let's walk over like a really

00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:00.256 A:middle
Let's walk over like a really

00:37:00.406 --> 00:37:01.766 A:middle
kind of playful example of how

00:37:01.766 --> 00:37:03.336 A:middle
you might use a modeler.

00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
So let's say you define a schema

00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:07.406 A:middle
called playing with matches,

00:37:07.636 --> 00:37:07.906 A:middle
right.

00:37:08.006 --> 00:37:10.166 A:middle
This is an os signpost interval

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
schema and it's for an os

00:37:12.876 --> 00:37:14.156 A:middle
signpost that you've defined

00:37:14.156 --> 00:37:15.036 A:middle
where you're going to do some

00:37:15.036 --> 00:37:16.816 A:middle
sort of dangerous operation in

00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
your code.

00:37:17.726 --> 00:37:19.996 A:middle
And we define another schema

00:37:20.156 --> 00:37:21.766 A:middle
called app on fire, right.

00:37:22.186 --> 00:37:23.916 A:middle
It's also a signpost schema but

00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:25.206 A:middle
these signposts mean that the

00:37:25.206 --> 00:37:27.386 A:middle
application has entered into a

00:37:27.386 --> 00:37:28.986 A:middle
bad state and we really want to

00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:29.396 A:middle
know why.

00:37:30.406 --> 00:37:31.816 A:middle
So you create an output schema,

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.306 A:middle
which is a point schema, that's

00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:34.426 A:middle
going to hold the object that

00:37:34.426 --> 00:37:35.836 A:middle
was playing with matches and the

00:37:35.836 --> 00:37:37.476 A:middle
time at which the fire started.

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:38.676 A:middle
We are going to call that the

00:37:38.676 --> 00:37:39.796 A:middle
started a fire schema.

00:37:39.796 --> 00:37:43.376 A:middle
Now the modeler's world looks

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:44.066 A:middle
like this.

00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:46.686 A:middle
So we have all of our inputs set

00:37:46.686 --> 00:37:48.486 A:middle
up in time order ready to go and

00:37:48.486 --> 00:37:51.096 A:middle
this dashed line on the left is

00:37:51.096 --> 00:37:52.436 A:middle
what's called the modeler's

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:53.126 A:middle
clock.

00:37:54.136 --> 00:37:55.976 A:middle
Now when we grab the first input

00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:57.206 A:middle
and we enter that into the

00:37:57.206 --> 00:37:58.636 A:middle
working memory, the modeler's

00:37:58.686 --> 00:37:59.686 A:middle
clock moves to the start of that

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:03.076 A:middle
interval and then we grab the

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:03.076 A:middle
interval and then we grab the

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:04.666 A:middle
next input, the modeler's clock

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:06.036 A:middle
again moves to the beginning of

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:07.226 A:middle
that interval and we enter that

00:38:07.226 --> 00:38:08.046 A:middle
into the working memory.

00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:10.376 A:middle
Now the modeler sees both of

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:12.656 A:middle
these in the working memory and

00:38:12.656 --> 00:38:14.366 A:middle
it can see that if playing with

00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:16.256 A:middle
matches started before the app

00:38:16.256 --> 00:38:17.336 A:middle
is on fire, it doesn't really

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.886 A:middle
make much difference, if it's

00:38:19.176 --> 00:38:19.956 A:middle
the other way around, it's

00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.406 A:middle
already on fire, then we can

00:38:22.406 --> 00:38:24.086 A:middle
draw a logical conclusion here

00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:27.936 A:middle
called the cause of fire and we

00:38:27.936 --> 00:38:29.526 A:middle
can enter that into the working

00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:29.846 A:middle
memory.

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.456 A:middle
Now as we grab this third input,

00:38:33.756 --> 00:38:34.986 A:middle
you'll notice that the modeler

00:38:34.986 --> 00:38:36.636 A:middle
clock has moved and it no longer

00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:38.396 A:middle
intersects with our first two

00:38:38.396 --> 00:38:38.996 A:middle
inputs.

00:38:39.516 --> 00:38:41.256 A:middle
And so those are removed from

00:38:41.256 --> 00:38:41.956 A:middle
the working memory.

00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:44.636 A:middle
Now if the cause of fire had

00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:45.886 A:middle
what's called logical support,

00:38:46.326 --> 00:38:48.236 A:middle
it would also be removed from

00:38:50.256 --> 00:38:50.556 A:middle
memory.

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.926 A:middle
Now to recap, the clock is

00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:54.336 A:middle
always set to the current input

00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:54.926 A:middle
timestamp.

00:38:55.556 --> 00:38:57.576 A:middle
And for an input to remain in

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:58.936 A:middle
the working memory, it must

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.836 A:middle
intersect with the current clock

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.836 A:middle
intersect with the current clock

00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:02.406 A:middle
in the modeler.

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:04.156 A:middle
This is what helps us establish

00:39:04.236 --> 00:39:04.876 A:middle
coincidence.

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:06.606 A:middle
It allows us to prune out the

00:39:06.606 --> 00:39:08.626 A:middle
old data and it also allows us

00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:10.186 A:middle
to see if there are inputs that

00:39:10.186 --> 00:39:13.386 A:middle
are possibly correlated in time.

00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:15.026 A:middle
Now the way that a modeler

00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:16.766 A:middle
reasons about its working memory

00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:19.196 A:middle
is defined by you through what's

00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:20.426 A:middle
called a production system.

00:39:21.496 --> 00:39:23.466 A:middle
Production systems work on facts

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.306 A:middle
in the working memory and

00:39:25.306 --> 00:39:26.486 A:middle
they're defined by rules that

00:39:26.486 --> 00:39:28.176 A:middle
have a left-hand side, a

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
production operator, and the

00:39:29.706 --> 00:39:30.346 A:middle
right-hand side.

00:39:31.106 --> 00:39:32.896 A:middle
The left-hand side is a pattern

00:39:33.306 --> 00:39:35.106 A:middle
in working memory that has to

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.336 A:middle
occur to activate the rule and

00:39:37.336 --> 00:39:38.976 A:middle
the right-hand side are the

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.426 A:middle
actions that will happen when

00:39:40.426 --> 00:39:41.576 A:middle
that rule fires.

00:39:42.036 --> 00:39:43.306 A:middle
Now the actions could include

00:39:43.746 --> 00:39:45.686 A:middle
adding a row to an output table

00:39:45.866 --> 00:39:48.476 A:middle
or include asserting a new fact

00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:50.896 A:middle
into the working memory as the

00:39:50.896 --> 00:39:52.566 A:middle
modeling process progresses.

00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:56.826 A:middle
So facts come from two sources.

00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:58.046 A:middle
One, they're from the table

00:39:58.046 --> 00:39:59.566 A:middle
inputs that you saw, so will

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.206 A:middle
automatically assert these as

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.206 A:middle
automatically assert these as

00:40:01.206 --> 00:40:03.336 A:middle
facts using the rules that I

00:40:03.336 --> 00:40:04.246 A:middle
showed you with the modeling

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:06.376 A:middle
clock, and they can also be

00:40:06.376 --> 00:40:07.846 A:middle
produced by assertions from the

00:40:07.846 --> 00:40:09.866 A:middle
right-hand side of a production.

00:40:11.066 --> 00:40:12.196 A:middle
Now if you're going to create

00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:14.336 A:middle
your own facts, Clips allows you

00:40:14.336 --> 00:40:15.316 A:middle
to find what's called a fact

00:40:15.426 --> 00:40:16.106 A:middle
template, which allows you to

00:40:16.106 --> 00:40:17.196 A:middle
provide structure to your fact

00:40:17.196 --> 00:40:17.976 A:middle
and do some basic type checking.

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:21.306 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:40:21.306 --> 00:40:22.356 A:middle
rules in Clips.

00:40:23.226 --> 00:40:24.326 A:middle
Our first rule that we're going

00:40:24.326 --> 00:40:25.466 A:middle
to look at is called found

00:40:25.466 --> 00:40:25.926 A:middle
cause.

00:40:27.306 --> 00:40:30.446 A:middle
And what that says is if there

00:40:30.446 --> 00:40:31.806 A:middle
is an object who's playing with

00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:35.526 A:middle
matches at t1, and the app is on

00:40:35.526 --> 00:40:38.996 A:middle
fire at t2, and t1 happened

00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:41.466 A:middle
before t2, then on the

00:40:41.466 --> 00:40:42.236 A:middle
right-hand side of this

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:43.756 A:middle
production, we can assert a new

00:40:43.756 --> 00:40:46.026 A:middle
fact called cause of fire with

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.326 A:middle
the object that started the

00:40:47.326 --> 00:40:47.616 A:middle
fire.

00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:49.336 A:middle
Now that will be entered into

00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:50.096 A:middle
the working memory.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:53.156 A:middle
Now we come down to our second

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:54.666 A:middle
rule, which is called record a

00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:58.296 A:middle
cause, if we have an app on fire

00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:00.166 A:middle
at some start time and we know

00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:00.166 A:middle
at some start time and we know

00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.796 A:middle
the cause of the fire and we

00:41:01.796 --> 00:41:03.536 A:middle
have a table that's bound to our

00:41:03.536 --> 00:41:05.876 A:middle
append side, that's the output

00:41:05.876 --> 00:41:08.876 A:middle
side of the modeler, and that

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:11.336 A:middle
table happens to be the schema

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.926 A:middle
that we define called started a

00:41:12.926 --> 00:41:16.776 A:middle
fire, then we can create a row

00:41:16.776 --> 00:41:18.126 A:middle
in that table and then set the

00:41:18.246 --> 00:41:19.946 A:middle
time and who started the fire to

00:41:19.946 --> 00:41:21.276 A:middle
the values that we captured up

00:41:21.276 --> 00:41:23.826 A:middle
here in the pattern.

00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:25.826 A:middle
Now with that, we basically

00:41:25.826 --> 00:41:27.756 A:middle
created our very first expert

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:29.356 A:middle
system to look for bad patterns

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:30.776 A:middle
in our application with these

00:41:30.776 --> 00:41:31.406 A:middle
two rules.

00:41:32.436 --> 00:41:34.376 A:middle
Now you may have noticed that

00:41:34.376 --> 00:41:36.016 A:middle
the rules were prepended by

00:41:36.016 --> 00:41:38.396 A:middle
either modeler or recorder.

00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:39.546 A:middle
Those are what are called

00:41:39.546 --> 00:41:41.606 A:middle
modules in Clips and they allow

00:41:41.606 --> 00:41:43.916 A:middle
you to both group rules but also

00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.426 A:middle
control the execution order of

00:41:45.426 --> 00:41:45.956 A:middle
the rules.

00:41:46.526 --> 00:41:48.556 A:middle
So for example, if you kept all

00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:50.946 A:middle
of your output, all of the rules

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:52.176 A:middle
that produced output the output

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.006 A:middle
tables in the recorder module,

00:41:55.116 --> 00:41:57.536 A:middle
then you can be sure that you

00:41:57.536 --> 00:41:59.896 A:middle
won't write an output while

00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:00.456 A:middle
you're in the middle of the

00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:00.456 A:middle
you're in the middle of the

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:01.916 A:middle
reasoning process in modeler

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:03.566 A:middle
because all the rules in modeler

00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:05.246 A:middle
have to execute before any of

00:42:05.246 --> 00:42:06.966 A:middle
the rules in recorder can

00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:07.746 A:middle
actually execute.

00:42:08.686 --> 00:42:10.736 A:middle
Now I mentioned the term before

00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.296 A:middle
logical support.

00:42:12.776 --> 00:42:14.556 A:middle
What logical support is usually

00:42:14.776 --> 00:42:17.066 A:middle
tied to what are called peer

00:42:17.066 --> 00:42:18.586 A:middle
inference rules and those are

00:42:18.586 --> 00:42:20.336 A:middle
rules that you say, well, if A

00:42:20.336 --> 00:42:21.736 A:middle
and B, then C.

00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:23.756 A:middle
Right. So by adding logical

00:42:23.756 --> 00:42:25.286 A:middle
support to your production, what

00:42:25.286 --> 00:42:29.646 A:middle
you're saying is if A and B are

00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:30.786 A:middle
no longer present in working

00:42:30.786 --> 00:42:32.126 A:middle
memory, then C should

00:42:32.126 --> 00:42:33.606 A:middle
automatically be retracted.

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:35.726 A:middle
So what we're saying is C is

00:42:35.726 --> 00:42:37.016 A:middle
logically supported by the

00:42:37.016 --> 00:42:38.326 A:middle
existence of A and B.

00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:40.346 A:middle
Now this is important because it

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.606 A:middle
limits working memory bloat

00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:43.156 A:middle
which helps with resource

00:42:43.156 --> 00:42:44.436 A:middle
consumption but it's also

00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:46.096 A:middle
important to remove facts from

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.356 A:middle
working memory that are no

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:48.076 A:middle
longer valid.

00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:49.486 A:middle
And if A and B are no longer

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.966 A:middle
valid, then you should really

00:42:50.966 --> 00:42:51.526 A:middle
remove C.

00:42:52.076 --> 00:42:54.596 A:middle
So to add logical support to

00:42:54.826 --> 00:42:57.606 A:middle
your production, your rule here,

00:42:57.906 --> 00:42:59.826 A:middle
you just wrap the pattern with

00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:01.226 A:middle
the keyword logical and then

00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:01.226 A:middle
the keyword logical and then

00:43:01.226 --> 00:43:02.146 A:middle
anything you assert on the

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.866 A:middle
right-hand side of the rule will

00:43:03.866 --> 00:43:05.986 A:middle
be automatically retracted when

00:43:05.986 --> 00:43:06.836 A:middle
these move forward.

00:43:07.056 --> 00:43:08.566 A:middle
And you'll notice these two

00:43:08.816 --> 00:43:10.566 A:middle
rules, I'm sorry, these two

00:43:11.146 --> 00:43:12.876 A:middle
facts here are the names that

00:43:12.876 --> 00:43:14.326 A:middle
come from our schema.

00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:16.446 A:middle
So those are inputs and so when

00:43:16.446 --> 00:43:17.176 A:middle
the modeler's clock move

00:43:17.176 --> 00:43:18.456 A:middle
forward, those will

00:43:18.456 --> 00:43:19.636 A:middle
automatically be retracted.

00:43:22.196 --> 00:43:23.626 A:middle
Okay, so now we know the basics

00:43:23.626 --> 00:43:25.476 A:middle
of how to create a modeler in

00:43:25.476 --> 00:43:27.336 A:middle
our package and we've seen some

00:43:27.436 --> 00:43:29.746 A:middle
of the Clips language and rules.

00:43:30.186 --> 00:43:32.096 A:middle
So let's take a look and see if

00:43:32.096 --> 00:43:34.626 A:middle
we can add an expert system to

00:43:34.626 --> 00:43:37.646 A:middle
our networking instrument to

00:43:37.646 --> 00:43:39.216 A:middle
find bad patterns and potential

00:43:39.426 --> 00:43:41.106 A:middle
misuses in our networking layer.

00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.286 A:middle
And to do that, I'd like to

00:43:43.286 --> 00:43:44.656 A:middle
invite Kacper up for one last

00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:44.886 A:middle
demo.

00:43:45.516 --> 00:43:50.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:55.016 --> 00:43:56.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So now with the existing

00:43:56.526 --> 00:43:58.176 A:middle
logging, I will try to write

00:43:58.246 --> 00:43:59.796 A:middle
modeler to detect some

00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:00.956 A:middle
anti-patterns in our app

00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:00.956 A:middle
anti-patterns in our app

00:44:00.956 --> 00:44:01.976 A:middle
networking behavior.

00:44:02.756 --> 00:44:03.656 A:middle
I was playing with my

00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:05.646 A:middle
Trailblazer app and it seemed

00:44:05.646 --> 00:44:07.086 A:middle
that if I'm scrolling pretty

00:44:07.136 --> 00:44:08.746 A:middle
fast, there are some glitches

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:09.476 A:middle
visible here.

00:44:09.906 --> 00:44:11.886 A:middle
So image is replaced multiple

00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:14.516 A:middle
times, so I suspect that our

00:44:14.516 --> 00:44:15.906 A:middle
cancel doesn't really work.

00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:18.846 A:middle
I would like to write modeler

00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:19.736 A:middle
that detects that.

00:44:21.186 --> 00:44:23.746 A:middle
So let's take a look in our

00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:24.736 A:middle
package definition.

00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:27.246 A:middle
We will start by writing modeler

00:44:27.466 --> 00:44:27.916 A:middle
element.

00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:31.336 A:middle
Modeler has identifier, title,

00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:32.366 A:middle
and purpose.

00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:35.316 A:middle
These fields will be extracted

00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:36.406 A:middle
to your documentation.

00:44:37.536 --> 00:44:39.366 A:middle
We specify production system

00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:41.576 A:middle
path which contains all of the

00:44:41.576 --> 00:44:42.756 A:middle
logic for our modeler.

00:44:45.086 --> 00:44:46.986 A:middle
Then, we define output of our

00:44:46.986 --> 00:44:47.466 A:middle
modeler.

00:44:48.086 --> 00:44:49.526 A:middle
It will be downloader narrative

00:44:49.526 --> 00:44:50.006 A:middle
schema.

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:53.506 A:middle
Required input for our modeler

00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:55.646 A:middle
will be os signpost table.

00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:58.836 A:middle
This table contains begin and

00:44:58.836 --> 00:44:59.686 A:middle
end events.

00:45:00.926 --> 00:45:02.076 A:middle
Now let's take a look at

00:45:02.526 --> 00:45:03.816 A:middle
definition for downloader

00:45:03.816 --> 00:45:04.946 A:middle
narrative schema.

00:45:10.896 --> 00:45:13.006 A:middle
This is point schema that

00:45:13.046 --> 00:45:15.026 A:middle
defines two columns, timestamp

00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:17.216 A:middle
which tracks the time of logging

00:45:17.216 --> 00:45:19.046 A:middle
that diagnostic message and

00:45:20.176 --> 00:45:22.156 A:middle
description that has information

00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:23.666 A:middle
about what's gone wrong.

00:45:26.116 --> 00:45:28.346 A:middle
Then, we can create this table

00:45:28.676 --> 00:45:30.086 A:middle
in our instrument definition.

00:45:30.656 --> 00:45:33.316 A:middle
We pass downloader narrative

00:45:33.316 --> 00:45:35.456 A:middle
schema ref and unique

00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:36.206 A:middle
identifier.

00:45:37.896 --> 00:45:40.006 A:middle
Then, we could use it in our

00:45:40.136 --> 00:45:42.206 A:middle
narrative element definition.

00:45:44.556 --> 00:45:46.266 A:middle
Here, we define narrative.

00:45:46.686 --> 00:45:49.006 A:middle
We pass table ref for the table

00:45:49.006 --> 00:45:51.466 A:middle
we previously created, define

00:45:51.546 --> 00:45:53.766 A:middle
time column, and narrative

00:45:55.616 --> 00:45:55.846 A:middle
column.

00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:57.876 A:middle
Now we are ready to define logic

00:45:57.876 --> 00:45:58.756 A:middle
for our modeler.

00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:01.826 A:middle
To do this, I will create file

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
that I previously referenced in

00:46:03.736 --> 00:46:04.766 A:middle
modeler definition.

00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:07.256 A:middle
To create Clips file, you go to

00:46:07.256 --> 00:46:12.796 A:middle
File, New, select macOS

00:46:14.276 --> 00:46:15.786 A:middle
platform, Other section, and

00:46:15.786 --> 00:46:16.366 A:middle
Clips file.

00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:19.976 A:middle
I will fill out the name

00:46:23.976 --> 00:46:27.586 A:middle
and create.

00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:30.286 A:middle
So algorithm for detecting

00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:31.936 A:middle
whether one cell is doing more

00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:33.486 A:middle
than one request at a time will

00:46:33.486 --> 00:46:34.256 A:middle
be as follows.

00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:37.036 A:middle
We'll be tracking every request

00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:38.756 A:middle
as a fact in working memory.

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.856 A:middle
Firstly, we need to create

00:46:41.046 --> 00:46:42.946 A:middle
template for this fact.

00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:47.696 A:middle
So every fact will be storing

00:46:47.786 --> 00:46:49.996 A:middle
time, caller address, which is

00:46:49.996 --> 00:46:53.236 A:middle
cell address, signpost id that

00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:56.286 A:middle
we captured, and the image name

00:46:56.286 --> 00:46:57.286 A:middle
that we are requesting.

00:46:57.806 --> 00:46:59.346 A:middle
We will call this fact started

00:46:59.406 --> 00:46:59.796 A:middle
download.

00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.296 A:middle
Then, you'll write modeler rule

00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:05.066 A:middle
that creates this fact in

00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:05.816 A:middle
working memory.

00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:11.286 A:middle
This rule looks at os signpost

00:47:11.326 --> 00:47:11.676 A:middle
table.

00:47:12.536 --> 00:47:15.336 A:middle
We specify subsystem, name, and

00:47:15.426 --> 00:47:18.006 A:middle
event type begin and we capture

00:47:18.006 --> 00:47:19.336 A:middle
all of the information that we

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.306 A:middle
want to have.

00:47:21.186 --> 00:47:22.926 A:middle
So we capture image name, caller

00:47:22.926 --> 00:47:25.026 A:middle
address, time, and signpost

00:47:25.026 --> 00:47:25.586 A:middle
identifier.

00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:28.306 A:middle
Then, we assert new fact to

00:47:28.436 --> 00:47:28.956 A:middle
working memory.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:36.676 A:middle
To clean it up after download

00:47:36.746 --> 00:47:39.406 A:middle
finishes, we need to retract

00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:40.666 A:middle
this fact from working memory.

00:47:44.426 --> 00:47:46.066 A:middle
Here, we are looking at the same

00:47:46.066 --> 00:47:48.606 A:middle
table but we are looking at only

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:51.736 A:middle
event of type end.

00:47:52.866 --> 00:47:54.246 A:middle
We capture identifier of the

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:54.836 A:middle
signpost.

00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.426 A:middle
And here, we are using the fact

00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:00.096 A:middle
that signpost begin and end has

00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:00.096 A:middle
that signpost begin and end has

00:48:00.136 --> 00:48:01.526 A:middle
to have the same identifier.

00:48:02.706 --> 00:48:04.336 A:middle
We are looking in working memory

00:48:04.566 --> 00:48:07.296 A:middle
for a fact that has a signpost

00:48:07.296 --> 00:48:09.726 A:middle
identifier that we captured and

00:48:09.726 --> 00:48:11.346 A:middle
retract this fact.

00:48:14.116 --> 00:48:16.286 A:middle
Then, we can write our recorder

00:48:16.286 --> 00:48:18.546 A:middle
rule that will generate all of

00:48:18.546 --> 00:48:18.976 A:middle
the narrative data.

00:48:24.216 --> 00:48:27.106 A:middle
This recorder rule looks at all

00:48:27.106 --> 00:48:28.546 A:middle
of the started download facts

00:48:28.726 --> 00:48:29.986 A:middle
and captures them.

00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:32.136 A:middle
We captured time, caller

00:48:32.136 --> 00:48:33.696 A:middle
address, and image name.

00:48:34.796 --> 00:48:36.936 A:middle
If that's true and there is

00:48:37.606 --> 00:48:39.176 A:middle
another started download which

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.996 A:middle
has the same caller address, you

00:48:40.996 --> 00:48:42.786 A:middle
can notice that variables

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.646 A:middle
referenced here are the same and

00:48:45.376 --> 00:48:48.616 A:middle
happened before the first fact.

00:48:49.606 --> 00:48:51.136 A:middle
We notice that there is some

00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:52.326 A:middle
anti-pattern and there is

00:48:52.326 --> 00:48:53.616 A:middle
overlap in our request.

00:48:54.716 --> 00:48:56.086 A:middle
We can then check whether we

00:48:56.086 --> 00:48:57.346 A:middle
have access to downloader

00:48:57.346 --> 00:49:01.386 A:middle
narrative schema, create new row

00:48:57.346 --> 00:49:01.386 A:middle
narrative schema, create new row

00:49:01.386 --> 00:49:05.766 A:middle
in it, set time column to the

00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:08.976 A:middle
time of the first fact, and set

00:49:08.976 --> 00:49:10.266 A:middle
your narrative description.

00:49:11.036 --> 00:49:13.796 A:middle
You'll output some information

00:49:13.796 --> 00:49:15.486 A:middle
about the problem so that

00:49:15.846 --> 00:49:19.216 A:middle
someone could debug it later.

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.466 A:middle
Now I can run Instrument against

00:49:21.466 --> 00:49:21.916 A:middle
our app.

00:49:22.636 --> 00:49:24.956 A:middle
Let's run it again.

00:49:32.216 --> 00:49:33.946 A:middle
Choose Trailblazer Networking in

00:49:33.946 --> 00:49:38.156 A:middle
template again, and record.

00:49:38.936 --> 00:49:41.766 A:middle
I will try to perform some fast

00:49:41.766 --> 00:49:44.236 A:middle
scrolling here and take a look

00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:44.976 A:middle
at my narrative table.

00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:51.836 A:middle
You can see that narrative table

00:49:51.886 --> 00:49:53.406 A:middle
contains lots of diagnostic

00:49:53.406 --> 00:49:55.066 A:middle
messages being outputted.

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:57.706 A:middle
So we can see that there are

00:49:57.706 --> 00:49:59.126 A:middle
some problems and we can later

00:49:59.126 --> 00:49:59.866 A:middle
investigate it.

00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:03.086 A:middle
You can see that narrative is

00:50:03.176 --> 00:50:04.186 A:middle
interactive detail.

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:06.526 A:middle
You could for example check all

00:50:06.526 --> 00:50:07.746 A:middle
of the arguments being passed

00:50:07.876 --> 00:50:09.066 A:middle
and you can filter.

00:50:09.496 --> 00:50:11.586 A:middle
So we can add this caller

00:50:11.586 --> 00:50:13.826 A:middle
address as a detail filter and

00:50:13.826 --> 00:50:15.476 A:middle
have this detail filter.

00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:19.386 A:middle
Now, let's back to Chad who will

00:50:19.386 --> 00:50:21.146 A:middle
tell you more about some best

00:50:21.216 --> 00:50:22.696 A:middle
practices when developing

00:50:22.736 --> 00:50:23.446 A:middle
instruments.

00:50:24.516 --> 00:50:29.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:50:30.396 --> 00:50:30.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:50:30.646 --> 00:50:31.326 A:middle
Thank you, Kacper.

00:50:32.076 --> 00:50:34.616 A:middle
So we've seen how we can create

00:50:34.616 --> 00:50:36.546 A:middle
some basic expert systems in

00:50:36.546 --> 00:50:37.016 A:middle
Instruments.

00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:39.656 A:middle
Alright, so let's talk about

00:50:39.826 --> 00:50:42.316 A:middle
some best practices that we've

00:50:42.316 --> 00:50:43.156 A:middle
learned along the way.

00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:46.796 A:middle
And the first one is to write

00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:47.986 A:middle
more than one instrument.

00:50:48.236 --> 00:50:49.566 A:middle
Now I don't mean get practice

00:50:49.566 --> 00:50:50.286 A:middle
writing instruments.

00:50:50.776 --> 00:50:52.146 A:middle
What I mean is that if you own

00:50:52.146 --> 00:50:52.926 A:middle
an instrument already and you

00:50:52.926 --> 00:50:54.096 A:middle
want to add some features to it,

00:50:54.396 --> 00:50:55.486 A:middle
sometimes it's really tempting

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:56.826 A:middle
to just add them, add extra

00:50:56.826 --> 00:50:57.826 A:middle
graphs or details to your

00:50:57.826 --> 00:50:59.346 A:middle
instrument, but you should

00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.306 A:middle
really be thinking, you know,

00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.306 A:middle
really be thinking, you know,

00:51:00.306 --> 00:51:01.876 A:middle
can this be its own instrument.

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:03.216 A:middle
And the reason for that is if

00:51:03.216 --> 00:51:05.366 A:middle
you create finer-grained

00:51:05.726 --> 00:51:07.326 A:middle
instruments, you give the users

00:51:07.326 --> 00:51:08.206 A:middle
of Instruments a lot more

00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:08.766 A:middle
choices.

00:51:09.256 --> 00:51:10.686 A:middle
They can drag just the

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:11.716 A:middle
instruments that they want out

00:51:11.716 --> 00:51:13.156 A:middle
of the library and that will

00:51:13.156 --> 00:51:14.996 A:middle
minimize the recording impact on

00:51:14.996 --> 00:51:15.496 A:middle
the target.

00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:17.306 A:middle
If you focus on one instrument

00:51:17.306 --> 00:51:18.546 A:middle
with lots of features, it's kind

00:51:18.546 --> 00:51:19.416 A:middle
of like an all-or-nothing

00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:20.026 A:middle
proposal there.

00:51:20.986 --> 00:51:24.616 A:middle
Now, if you want to create a

00:51:24.616 --> 00:51:26.066 A:middle
combination of instruments that

00:51:26.636 --> 00:51:27.476 A:middle
are going to be targeted at a

00:51:27.476 --> 00:51:29.666 A:middle
certain problem, you want to see

00:51:29.666 --> 00:51:30.486 A:middle
all these instruments used

00:51:30.486 --> 00:51:31.366 A:middle
together at the same time,

00:51:31.366 --> 00:51:33.616 A:middle
rather, then what you can do is

00:51:33.616 --> 00:51:34.976 A:middle
create your own custom template

00:51:35.146 --> 00:51:36.156 A:middle
like we did for the networking.

00:51:36.696 --> 00:51:37.896 A:middle
And so what you do to get that

00:51:37.896 --> 00:51:39.486 A:middle
started on that is create a

00:51:39.486 --> 00:51:40.966 A:middle
document, drag the instruments

00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:42.126 A:middle
in the way that you want to see

00:51:42.126 --> 00:51:44.116 A:middle
them, configure them, go to File

00:51:44.116 --> 00:51:44.926 A:middle
and then say, "save as

00:51:44.926 --> 00:51:45.316 A:middle
template."

00:51:45.706 --> 00:51:46.696 A:middle
And then you can use that

00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:48.656 A:middle
template inside your package

00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:50.666 A:middle
using the element that Kacper

00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:52.016 A:middle
had added to our Networking

00:51:52.216 --> 00:51:52.496 A:middle
Template.

00:51:53.226 --> 00:51:54.606 A:middle
So writing with more than one

00:51:54.606 --> 00:51:55.836 A:middle
instrument is a lot better way

00:51:55.836 --> 00:51:56.486 A:middle
to use tool.

00:51:58.046 --> 00:51:59.436 A:middle
The second one is immediate mode

00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
is hard.

00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
is hard.

00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:03.256 A:middle
Immediate mode refers to the

00:52:03.256 --> 00:52:04.616 A:middle
recording mode of Instruments

00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:07.016 A:middle
where we're visualizing the data

00:52:07.016 --> 00:52:08.916 A:middle
as it's coming in, in near

00:52:08.916 --> 00:52:10.586 A:middle
real-time, and the reason it's

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.156 A:middle
hard, well there's really two

00:52:12.156 --> 00:52:12.766 A:middle
reasons it's hard.

00:52:12.856 --> 00:52:14.246 A:middle
The first one is it requires

00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:16.006 A:middle
some additional support that as

00:52:16.006 --> 00:52:17.176 A:middle
much as we wanted to cover

00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:18.436 A:middle
today, we just couldn't.

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:19.546 A:middle
We just didn't have the time.

00:52:19.956 --> 00:52:20.726 A:middle
And so we're going to be working

00:52:20.726 --> 00:52:21.936 A:middle
on the documentation for that.

00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:24.156 A:middle
But the second reason, and this

00:52:24.156 --> 00:52:26.456 A:middle
is the more important reason, is

00:52:26.456 --> 00:52:28.606 A:middle
that, well it's interval data,

00:52:29.076 --> 00:52:29.296 A:middle
right.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:31.236 A:middle
So intervals can't be entered

00:52:31.236 --> 00:52:32.766 A:middle
into the tables in the Analysis

00:52:32.766 --> 00:52:34.406 A:middle
Core until they're closed,

00:52:34.406 --> 00:52:35.316 A:middle
meaning that we've seen both the

00:52:35.316 --> 00:52:36.346 A:middle
begin and the end.

00:52:36.496 --> 00:52:37.576 A:middle
And so when you're looking at a

00:52:37.576 --> 00:52:39.386 A:middle
recording live, you have a bunch

00:52:39.386 --> 00:52:40.176 A:middle
of what are called open

00:52:40.176 --> 00:52:40.696 A:middle
intervals.

00:52:40.886 --> 00:52:42.216 A:middle
Now if your modelers require

00:52:42.216 --> 00:52:43.506 A:middle
these as inputs, which is

00:52:43.586 --> 00:52:45.576 A:middle
totally feasible, then what

00:52:45.576 --> 00:52:46.956 A:middle
you'll notice is that if there's

00:52:46.956 --> 00:52:48.936 A:middle
an open interval upstream, well

00:52:48.936 --> 00:52:50.426 A:middle
all of the modeler clocks

00:52:50.426 --> 00:52:52.266 A:middle
downstream have to stop until

00:52:52.266 --> 00:52:53.716 A:middle
that interval is closed because

00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:55.186 A:middle
remember, the modeler's vision

00:52:55.186 --> 00:52:56.986 A:middle
is all in time order.

00:52:57.116 --> 00:52:58.796 A:middle
So it can't move that clock

00:52:58.796 --> 00:53:00.196 A:middle
forward until all those

00:52:58.796 --> 00:53:00.196 A:middle
forward until all those

00:53:00.196 --> 00:53:01.516 A:middle
intervals upstream have closed.

00:53:02.076 --> 00:53:03.086 A:middle
So if you have some intervals

00:53:03.086 --> 00:53:04.856 A:middle
that have a long run, what

00:53:04.856 --> 00:53:06.636 A:middle
you'll notice is that the output

00:53:06.636 --> 00:53:08.276 A:middle
of your modeler appears to stop.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:11.336 A:middle
And when the user hits the stop

00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:13.506 A:middle
recording button, well then all

00:53:13.556 --> 00:53:14.516 A:middle
open intervals close and

00:53:14.516 --> 00:53:15.836 A:middle
everything processes as normal

00:53:15.976 --> 00:53:17.136 A:middle
and the data fills in.

00:53:17.606 --> 00:53:18.536 A:middle
But that's not a great user

00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:19.036 A:middle
experience.

00:53:19.416 --> 00:53:21.676 A:middle
So if you hit that, you have one

00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:22.396 A:middle
of two options.

00:53:22.396 --> 00:53:24.686 A:middle
The first one is to opt your

00:53:24.686 --> 00:53:26.066 A:middle
instruments out of immediate

00:53:26.066 --> 00:53:27.376 A:middle
mode support and you can do that

00:53:27.376 --> 00:53:28.846 A:middle
by adding a limitation element

00:53:28.916 --> 00:53:31.396 A:middle
to your instrument and the

00:53:31.396 --> 00:53:34.096 A:middle
second is to move off the

00:53:34.096 --> 00:53:35.746 A:middle
interval data as input to your

00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:38.136 A:middle
modeler, just like we did in our

00:53:38.136 --> 00:53:39.246 A:middle
demonstration here for our

00:53:39.246 --> 00:53:39.856 A:middle
expert system.

00:53:39.856 --> 00:53:41.316 A:middle
We were actually using the os

00:53:41.316 --> 00:53:42.746 A:middle
signpost point events rather

00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:44.176 A:middle
than using the intervals.

00:53:45.316 --> 00:53:47.156 A:middle
So I know we make it look easy

00:53:47.326 --> 00:53:49.086 A:middle
but immediate mode is a little

00:53:49.086 --> 00:53:50.046 A:middle
tricky to implement.

00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:53.386 A:middle
And then third, one of the

00:53:53.386 --> 00:53:55.056 A:middle
things that's really important

00:53:55.056 --> 00:53:56.256 A:middle
if you're creating instruments

00:53:56.256 --> 00:53:57.046 A:middle
that are going to be targeting

00:53:57.046 --> 00:53:59.156 A:middle
high volumes of input data is

00:53:59.156 --> 00:54:00.646 A:middle
that the last five-second

00:53:59.156 --> 00:54:00.646 A:middle
that the last five-second

00:54:00.646 --> 00:54:03.466 A:middle
recording mode is by far the

00:54:03.466 --> 00:54:04.066 A:middle
most efficient.

00:54:04.346 --> 00:54:05.816 A:middle
Now the way you switch that is

00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:07.256 A:middle
in the recording options of your

00:54:07.256 --> 00:54:08.886 A:middle
trace document, you'll see that

00:54:08.886 --> 00:54:09.776 A:middle
you have a choice between

00:54:09.776 --> 00:54:11.256 A:middle
immediate, deferred, and this

00:54:11.256 --> 00:54:12.676 A:middle
last end seconds mode.

00:54:13.246 --> 00:54:14.486 A:middle
That is going to be a lot more

00:54:14.486 --> 00:54:16.476 A:middle
efficient because what it allows

00:54:16.476 --> 00:54:18.016 A:middle
the recording technology to do

00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:19.666 A:middle
is use buffering to improve

00:54:19.716 --> 00:54:20.906 A:middle
performance so that it's not

00:54:20.906 --> 00:54:21.896 A:middle
trying to feed the data to

00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:22.976 A:middle
Instruments in real time.

00:54:23.376 --> 00:54:24.586 A:middle
Now this can have a profound

00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:26.876 A:middle
effect and it can have a huge

00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:28.286 A:middle
effect on signpost data where it

00:54:28.286 --> 00:54:29.856 A:middle
can be up to ten times faster

00:54:30.096 --> 00:54:31.756 A:middle
inside five-second mode.

00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:33.326 A:middle
Now of course the trade-off is

00:54:33.466 --> 00:54:34.796 A:middle
that you're only seeing the last

00:54:34.796 --> 00:54:37.136 A:middle
five seconds of data but for

00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:39.056 A:middle
instruments that produce high

00:54:39.056 --> 00:54:40.736 A:middle
volumes of data, that's usually

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:41.276 A:middle
a good thing.

00:54:41.446 --> 00:54:43.016 A:middle
So this is the common mode for a

00:54:43.016 --> 00:54:45.346 A:middle
System Trace and a Metal System

00:54:45.346 --> 00:54:46.486 A:middle
Trace and Game Performance

00:54:46.536 --> 00:54:46.916 A:middle
template.

00:54:47.176 --> 00:54:48.566 A:middle
And if you're targeting one of

00:54:48.566 --> 00:54:50.066 A:middle
those kinds of applications, I

00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:51.546 A:middle
would also opt your instrument

00:54:51.546 --> 00:54:53.136 A:middle
out of supporting immediate mode

00:54:53.476 --> 00:54:54.506 A:middle
just so that your user

00:54:54.506 --> 00:54:56.096 A:middle
experience is not terrible or

00:54:56.096 --> 00:54:58.086 A:middle
Instruments gets way behind on

00:54:58.086 --> 00:54:59.236 A:middle
trying to get the data or you

00:54:59.236 --> 00:55:00.286 A:middle
run into that problem with the

00:54:59.236 --> 00:55:00.286 A:middle
run into that problem with the

00:55:00.286 --> 00:55:00.746 A:middle
intervals.

00:55:02.926 --> 00:55:04.326 A:middle
That is the end of the session.

00:55:04.896 --> 00:55:08.026 A:middle
So we did a lot of work here to

00:55:08.026 --> 00:55:09.116 A:middle
create the Instruments feature

00:55:09.116 --> 00:55:10.456 A:middle
and we're really, really excited

00:55:10.456 --> 00:55:11.386 A:middle
that we were able to get it out

00:55:11.386 --> 00:55:12.306 A:middle
to you guys this year.

00:55:12.686 --> 00:55:14.636 A:middle
And so we can't wait to see what

00:55:14.636 --> 00:55:15.566 A:middle
you guys are able to accomplish

00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:15.746 A:middle
with it.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.906 A:middle
So if you'd like to see us and

00:55:17.906 --> 00:55:18.926 A:middle
talk to us about custom

00:55:18.926 --> 00:55:21.176 A:middle
instruments, we have a lab in

00:55:21.566 --> 00:55:23.986 A:middle
lab eight today at 3:00 and also

00:55:23.986 --> 00:55:25.916 A:middle
Session 405 goes over in detail

00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:27.256 A:middle
how to use os signpost API which

00:55:27.256 --> 00:55:28.586 A:middle
is a great way to get data into

00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:29.156 A:middle
Instruments.

00:55:29.856 --> 00:55:30.606 A:middle
So enjoy the rest of the

00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:30.976 A:middle
conference.
