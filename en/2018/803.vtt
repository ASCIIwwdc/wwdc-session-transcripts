00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:27.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, guys.

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:31.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:33.006 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
Thanks for coming by, guys.

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.576 A:middle
Welcome to Designing Fluid

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:39.216 A:middle
Interfaces.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.456 A:middle
My name is Chan.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.826 A:middle
And, I work on the human

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
interface team here at Apple.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.536 A:middle
And, most recently, I worked on

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.536 A:middle
this, the fluid gestural

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.176 A:middle
interface for iPhone 10.

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:53.756 A:middle
So, me, Marcos, and Nathan, we

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:55.146 A:middle
want to share a little bit about

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.676 A:middle
what we learned working on this,

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:58.666 A:middle
and other projects like this in

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.056 A:middle
the past.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.576 A:middle
So, the question we ask

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.536 A:middle
ourselves a lot is, what

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.656 A:middle
actually makes an interface feel

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:07.156 A:middle
fluid?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.826 A:middle
And, we've noticed that a lot of

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.246 A:middle
people actually describe it

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:11.826 A:middle
differently.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
You know, sometimes, when people

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.226 A:middle
actually try this stuff, when we

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:16.516 A:middle
show them a demo, and they try

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:17.296 A:middle
it, and they hold it in their

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.226 A:middle
hands, they sometimes say it

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:19.636 A:middle
feels fast.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.356 A:middle
Or, other people sometimes say

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:22.496 A:middle
it feels smooth.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
And, when it's feeling really

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:25.606 A:middle
good, sometimes people even say

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.476 A:middle
it feels natural, or magical.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:29.766 A:middle
But, when it comes down to it,

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.356 A:middle
it really feels like, it's one

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
of those things where you just

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:34.656 A:middle
know it when you feel it.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:36.206 A:middle
It just feels right.

00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:38.526 A:middle
And, you can have a gestural UI,

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
and we've seen lots of gestural

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.866 A:middle
UI's out there, but if it's not

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:44.526 A:middle
done right, something just feels

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:45.426 A:middle
off about it.

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:47.456 A:middle
And, it's oftentimes hard to put

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:48.556 A:middle
your finger on why.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.776 A:middle
And, it's more than just about

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.956 A:middle
frame rates, you know.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.236 A:middle
You can have something chugging

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:54.906 A:middle
along at a nice 60 frames per

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.746 A:middle
second, but it just feels off.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.626 A:middle
So, what gives us this feeling?

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.916 A:middle
Well, we think it boils down to

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
when the tool feels like an

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.176 A:middle
extension of your mind.

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.506 A:middle
An extension of your mind.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.895 A:middle
So, why is this important?

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:13.526 A:middle
Well, if you look at it, the

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:15.226 A:middle
iPhone is a tool, right?

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.486 A:middle
It's a hand tool for information

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:18.396 A:middle
and communication.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.286 A:middle
And, it works by marrying our

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:22.986 A:middle
tactile senses with our sense of

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:23.396 A:middle
vision.

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:25.536 A:middle
But, if you think about it, it's

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.846 A:middle
actually part of a long line of

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.446 A:middle
hand tools extending back

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:31.056 A:middle
thousands of years.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.286 A:middle
The tool on the left here was

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.036 A:middle
used to extract bone marrow

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:37.846 A:middle
150,000 years ago, extending the

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:38.896 A:middle
sharpness of what our fingers

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:39.226 A:middle
could do.

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.586 A:middle
So, we've been making hand tools

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.686 A:middle
for some time now.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.276 A:middle
And, the most amazing thing is

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.326 A:middle
that our hands have actually

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.126 A:middle
evolved and adapted alongside

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:49.666 A:middle
our tools.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.296 A:middle
We've evolved a huge

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.726 A:middle
concentration of muscles,

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:54.766 A:middle
nerves, blood vessels that can

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.136 A:middle
perform the most delicate

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:57.766 A:middle
gestures, and sense the lightest

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:58.196 A:middle
of touches.

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.386 A:middle
So, we're extremely adapted to

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.386 A:middle
So, we're extremely adapted to

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.066 A:middle
this tactile world we all live

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:03.156 A:middle
in.

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:06.106 A:middle
But, if you look at the history

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:08.236 A:middle
of computers, we started in a

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.536 A:middle
place where there was a lot of

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:11.236 A:middle
layers of extraction between you

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:11.846 A:middle
and the interface.

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:13.636 A:middle
There was so much you had to

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:15.026 A:middle
know just to operate it.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.036 A:middle
And, that made it out of reach

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:17.956 A:middle
for a lot of people.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:21.756 A:middle
But, over the last few decades

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.046 A:middle
or so, you've sort of been

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:24.596 A:middle
stripping those layers back you

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:25.696 A:middle
know, starting with indirect

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:27.316 A:middle
manipulation, where things were

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:28.436 A:middle
a little bit more one-to-one.

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:30.836 A:middle
A little bit more direct all the

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.946 A:middle
way to now, where we're finally

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:35.776 A:middle
stripping away all those layers

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.096 A:middle
back, to where you're directly

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:38.736 A:middle
interacting with the content.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:40.916 A:middle
This to us is the magical

00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:41.266 A:middle
element.

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:42.586 A:middle
It's when it stops feeling like

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.906 A:middle
a computer, and starts feeling

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:48.466 A:middle
more like an extension of the

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:49.266 A:middle
natural world.

00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:51.916 A:middle
This means the interface is now

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:53.976 A:middle
communicating with us at a much

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
more ancient level than

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.366 A:middle
interfaces have ever done.

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.286 A:middle
And, we have really high

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
standards for it.

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
standards for it.

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:01.796 A:middle
You know, if the slightest thing

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:03.166 A:middle
feels wrong, boom, the illusion

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:04.136 A:middle
is just shattered.

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.566 A:middle
But, when it feels right, it

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:07.866 A:middle
feels like an extension of

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.266 A:middle
yourself, an extension of your

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:10.056 A:middle
physical body.

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:12.126 A:middle
It's a tool that's in sync with

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.066 A:middle
your thought.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:14.786 A:middle
It feels delightful to use, and

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:16.356 A:middle
it feels really low-friction,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.466 A:middle
and even playful.

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:19.966 A:middle
So, what gives us this feeling?

00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:21.805 A:middle
And, when it feels off, how do

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:22.866 A:middle
we make it feel right?

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:24.896 A:middle
That's what this presentation's

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:25.606 A:middle
all about.

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:28.016 A:middle
We're going to talk about four

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:28.586 A:middle
things today.

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
And, we're going to start with

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.546 A:middle
designing some principles,

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.106 A:middle
talking about how we build

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:35.386 A:middle
interfaces that feel like an

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:36.636 A:middle
extension of us.

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:39.516 A:middle
How to design motion that feels

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:40.776 A:middle
in tune with the motion of our

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:42.376 A:middle
own bodies, and the world around

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:42.736 A:middle
us.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.526 A:middle
And, also designing gestures

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:46.726 A:middle
that feel elegant and

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:47.476 A:middle
intelligent.

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:50.206 A:middle
We're also going to talk about

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.806 A:middle
that, now that we've built this

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.436 A:middle
kind of stuff, how do we build

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:54.786 A:middle
interactions on top of it that

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.416 A:middle
feel native to the medium of

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:57.786 A:middle
touch, as a medium?

00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:02.556 A:middle
How do we design an interface

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:04.316 A:middle
that actually extends our mind?

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:05.046 A:middle
How do we do this?

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:07.996 A:middle
Well, we think the way to do it,

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:10.406 A:middle
is to align the interface to the

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:12.396 A:middle
way we think and the way we

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:12.786 A:middle
move.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:14.916 A:middle
So, the most important part of

00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
that is that our minds are

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:19.386 A:middle
constantly responding to changes

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:21.536 A:middle
and stimulus and thought, you

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:21.766 A:middle
know?

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:22.856 A:middle
Our minds and bodies are

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:24.756 A:middle
constantly in a state of dynamic

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
change.

00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:27.226 A:middle
So, it's not that our interfaces

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.746 A:middle
should be fluid, it's that we're

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
fluid, and our interfaces need

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.626 A:middle
to be able to respond to that.

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:35.666 A:middle
So, that begins with response.

00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:38.986 A:middle
You know, our tools depend on

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:39.736 A:middle
the latency.

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:41.236 A:middle
Think about how hard it would be

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.056 A:middle
to use any tool, or play an

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.336 A:middle
instrument, or do anything in

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:45.436 A:middle
the physical world, if there was

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:46.536 A:middle
a delay to using it?

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:48.516 A:middle
And, we found that people are

00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:49.926 A:middle
really, really sensitive to

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:50.416 A:middle
latency.

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.386 A:middle
You know? If you introduce any

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.876 A:middle
amount of lag, things all of a

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.026 A:middle
sudden just kind of fall off a

00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:57.466 A:middle
cliff in terms of how they

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:58.106 A:middle
respond to you.

00:05:58.106 --> 00:05:59.436 A:middle
There's all this additional

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:00.246 A:middle
mental burden.

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:00.246 A:middle
mental burden.

00:06:00.546 --> 00:06:01.736 A:middle
It feels super disconnected.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
It doesn't feel like an

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
extension of you anymore.

00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
So, we work so hard to reduce

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
latency.

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:09.276 A:middle
Where, we actually engineered

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.696 A:middle
the latest iPhone to respond

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:12.286 A:middle
quicker to your finger, so we

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:13.916 A:middle
can detect all the nuances of

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.396 A:middle
your gestures as instantly as

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:15.876 A:middle
possible.

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:18.086 A:middle
So, we really care about this

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.486 A:middle
stuff, and we think you should

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:19.826 A:middle
too.

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.166 A:middle
And, that means look for delays

00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:23.936 A:middle
everywhere.

00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:25.016 A:middle
It's not just swipes.

00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:26.306 A:middle
It's taps, it's presses, it's

00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:27.546 A:middle
every interaction with the

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
object.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.926 A:middle
Everything needs to respond

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:30.606 A:middle
instantly.

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.486 A:middle
And, during the process of

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:34.076 A:middle
designing this stuff, you know,

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:36.906 A:middle
oftentimes the delays kind of

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:38.796 A:middle
tend to seep in a little bit.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:39.956 A:middle
You know? So, it's really

00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:41.866 A:middle
important to keep an eye out for

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:42.236 A:middle
delays.

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:44.136 A:middle
Be vigilant and mindful of all

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.046 A:middle
the latencies or timers that we

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.086 A:middle
could introduce into the

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:49.026 A:middle
interface so that it always

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.016 A:middle
feels responsive.

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:52.406 A:middle
So, that's the topic of

00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:53.256 A:middle
response.

00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:54.906 A:middle
It's really simple, but it makes

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:57.326 A:middle
an interface feel lively and

00:06:58.556 --> 00:06:58.786 A:middle
dynamic.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
Next, we want to allow for

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
Next, we want to allow for

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.216 A:middle
constant redirection and

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:04.896 A:middle
interruption.

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:05.866 A:middle
This one's big.

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:08.526 A:middle
So, our bodies and minds are

00:07:08.756 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
constantly in a state of

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.496 A:middle
redirecting in response to

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:12.206 A:middle
change in thought, like we

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:12.736 A:middle
talked about.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:14.916 A:middle
So, if I was walking to the end

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:16.496 A:middle
of this stage here, and I

00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:17.736 A:middle
realize I forgot something back

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:19.166 A:middle
there, I could just turn back

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:19.706 A:middle
immediately.

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:20.656 A:middle
And, I wouldn't have to wait for

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
my body to reach the end before

00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:23.936 A:middle
I did that, right?

00:07:24.336 --> 00:07:25.376 A:middle
So, it's important for our

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.896 A:middle
interfaces to be able to reflect

00:07:26.986 --> 00:07:28.666 A:middle
that ability of constantly

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:29.246 A:middle
redirecting.

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.086 A:middle
And, it makes it feel connected

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:31.486 A:middle
to you.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.286 A:middle
That's why for iPhone 10, we

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.936 A:middle
built a fully redirectable

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:36.416 A:middle
interface.

00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
So, what's that?

00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:41.206 A:middle
So, the iPhone 10's an

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:42.586 A:middle
actually-- it's pretty simple

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
two-axis gesture.

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:44.676 A:middle
You go horizontally between

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:44.836 A:middle
apps.

00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:46.366 A:middle
And, you go vertically to go

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:46.646 A:middle
home.

00:07:47.106 --> 00:07:48.586 A:middle
But you can also mix the two

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:50.136 A:middle
axes, so you can be on your way

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:52.036 A:middle
home, and peek at multitasking

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.156 A:middle
and decide whether or not to go

00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:53.336 A:middle
there.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:55.306 A:middle
Or, you can go to multitasking

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:57.046 A:middle
and decide, actually, no, I want

00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:57.426 A:middle
to go home.

00:07:58.286 --> 00:07:59.926 A:middle
So, this might not seem that

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
important, but what if we didn't

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
important, but what if we didn't

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:01.916 A:middle
do this?

00:08:02.026 --> 00:08:03.266 A:middle
What if it wasn't redirectable?

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
So, what if the only gestures

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.246 A:middle
you could do was this horizontal

00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.226 A:middle
gesture between apps, and then a

00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:12.666 A:middle
vertical gesture to go home, and

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:13.256 A:middle
that's it.

00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
You couldn't do any of that

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:15.416 A:middle
in-between stuff I just

00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:15.776 A:middle
mentioned.

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:17.846 A:middle
Well, what would happen is that

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:19.406 A:middle
you would have to think before

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:21.136 A:middle
what you did, before you

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:21.876 A:middle
performed the gesture, you'd

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.086 A:middle
have to think what you want to

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:23.153 A:middle
do.

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:25.156 A:middle
And so, the series of events

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.276 A:middle
would be very linear, right?

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.276 A:middle
So, you'd have to think, do I

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:28.106 A:middle
want to go home?

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.396 A:middle
Do I want to go to multitasking?

00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:30.876 A:middle
Then you make your decision,

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:32.306 A:middle
then you perform the gesture,

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:32.905 A:middle
and then you release.

00:08:34.206 --> 00:08:35.876 A:middle
But, the cool thing is when it's

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:37.876 A:middle
redirectable, the thought and

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:39.746 A:middle
gesture happen in parallel.

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.535 A:middle
And, you sort of think it with

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.756 A:middle
the gesture, and it turns out

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.776 A:middle
this is way faster than thinking

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:47.386 A:middle
before doing.

00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:48.826 A:middle
You know? Because it's a

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
multi-axis gestural space.

00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:53.676 A:middle
It's not separate gestures.

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.616 A:middle
It's one gesture that does all

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:55.976 A:middle
this stuff.

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.306 A:middle
Home, multitasking, quick app

00:08:57.306 --> 00:08:58.266 A:middle
switching, so you don't have to

00:08:58.646 --> 00:08:59.766 A:middle
think about it as a separate

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
gesture.

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
gesture.

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:03.796 A:middle
And, helps with discovery.

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
Because you can discover a new

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
gesture along the path of an

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:07.656 A:middle
existing gesture.

00:09:08.546 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
And, it allows you to layer

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:11.956 A:middle
gestures at the speed of

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:12.706 A:middle
thought.

00:09:13.256 --> 00:09:14.156 A:middle
So, what does that last one

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:14.286 A:middle
mean?

00:09:14.896 --> 00:09:15.986 A:middle
So, let me show you some

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:16.566 A:middle
examples.

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:17.846 A:middle
And, we've slowed down the

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:19.196 A:middle
physics on the simulation, so

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:20.626 A:middle
you can actually see a little

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:21.616 A:middle
bit what I'm talking about.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
So, I can swipe to go home, and

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.566 A:middle
then swipe to the next page, or

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.946 A:middle
springboard while I'm going

00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:29.176 A:middle
home.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.616 A:middle
I can layer these two gestures

00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:31.806 A:middle
once I've internalized them.

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:34.796 A:middle
Another example is that I can

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:35.846 A:middle
launch an app and realize, oh,

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.126 A:middle
actually I need to go to

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:38.186 A:middle
multitasking, and I can

00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.806 A:middle
interrupt the app and go

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.396 A:middle
straight to multitasking, while

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:42.256 A:middle
the app is launching.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:47.296 A:middle
Or, I can launch an app and

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:49.016 A:middle
realize, oh, that was the wrong

00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:49.136 A:middle
app.

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:51.096 A:middle
And, I can shoot it back home,

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:53.066 A:middle
while I'm launching it.

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:56.406 A:middle
Now, there's one other one where

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:58.516 A:middle
I can actually just launch an

00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
app, and if I'm in a hurry, I

00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
app, and if I'm in a hurry, I

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
can start interacting with the

00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
app as it's launching.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.366 A:middle
So, this stuff might not seem

00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:06.766 A:middle
really important, but we've

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:08.256 A:middle
found it's super important for

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:09.786 A:middle
the interface to be always

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:11.426 A:middle
responding, always understanding

00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:11.576 A:middle
you.

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:13.566 A:middle
It always feels alive.

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:16.306 A:middle
And, that's really important for

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.416 A:middle
your expectation and

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.776 A:middle
understanding of the interface,

00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:20.396 A:middle
to be comfortable with it.

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:21.736 A:middle
To realize that it's always

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:22.766 A:middle
going to respond to you when you

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:23.436 A:middle
need it.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:27.776 A:middle
And, that applies as well to

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.476 A:middle
changes in motion, not just to

00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:31.496 A:middle
the start of an interaction, but

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.796 A:middle
when you're in the middle of an

00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:33.526 A:middle
interaction, and you're

00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:34.106 A:middle
changing.

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:35.726 A:middle
It's important for us to be

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.196 A:middle
responsive to interruption as

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:37.486 A:middle
well.

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:39.236 A:middle
So, a good example is

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:40.606 A:middle
multitasking on iPhone 10.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.936 A:middle
So, we have this pause gesture

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:44.136 A:middle
where you slide your finger up

00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:45.506 A:middle
halfway up the screen, and

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:47.726 A:middle
pause, and so we need to figure

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:50.506 A:middle
out how to detect this change in

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:50.896 A:middle
motion.

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:52.166 A:middle
And so, how do we do this?

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:53.216 A:middle
How do we detect this change in

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:53.576 A:middle
motion?

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.036 A:middle
Should we use a timer?

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.586 A:middle
Should we wait until your finger

00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:57.756 A:middle
has come below a certain

00:10:57.756 --> 00:10:59.486 A:middle
velocity for a few amount of

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
time, and then [inaudible] bring

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
time, and then [inaudible] bring

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.886 A:middle
in the multitasking cards?

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:04.236 A:middle
Well, it turns out that's too

00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:04.976 A:middle
slow.

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:06.636 A:middle
People expect to be able to get

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.086 A:middle
to multitasking instantly.

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:10.856 A:middle
And, we need a way that can

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:13.986 A:middle
respond as fast as them.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.116 A:middle
So, instead we look at your

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:16.376 A:middle
finger's acceleration.

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:18.636 A:middle
It turns out there's a huge

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.336 A:middle
spike in the acceleration of

00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:21.416 A:middle
your finger when you pause.

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:23.056 A:middle
And, actually the faster you

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.076 A:middle
stop, the faster we can detect

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:25.226 A:middle
it.

00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:27.016 A:middle
So, it's actually responding to

00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:29.126 A:middle
the change in motion, as fast as

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.886 A:middle
we know how, instead of waiting

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:31.676 A:middle
for some timer.

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
So, this is a good example of

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:35.666 A:middle
responding to redirection as

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:37.006 A:middle
fast as possible.

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:40.856 A:middle
So, this is the concept of

00:11:41.196 --> 00:11:42.436 A:middle
interruption and redirection.

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:44.426 A:middle
This stuff makes the interface

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:45.936 A:middle
feel really, really connected to

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:46.246 A:middle
you.

00:11:47.596 --> 00:11:50.576 A:middle
Next, we want to talk a little

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.646 A:middle
bit about the architecture of

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:52.096 A:middle
the interface.

00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:52.976 A:middle
How you lay it out,

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:54.406 A:middle
conceptually.

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.596 A:middle
And, we think when you're doing

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:58.006 A:middle
that, it's important to maintain

00:11:58.116 --> 00:11:59.846 A:middle
spatial consistency throughout

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:00.246 A:middle
movement.

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:00.246 A:middle
movement.

00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:01.686 A:middle
What does that mean?

00:12:02.526 --> 00:12:03.716 A:middle
This kind of mimics the way our

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:05.656 A:middle
object persistence memory works

00:12:05.806 --> 00:12:06.436 A:middle
in the real world.

00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:08.766 A:middle
So, things smoothly leave and

00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:09.756 A:middle
enter our perception in

00:12:09.866 --> 00:12:10.426 A:middle
symmetric paths.

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:13.246 A:middle
So, if something disappears one

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:15.556 A:middle
way, we expect it to emerge from

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:16.146 A:middle
where it came?

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:18.056 A:middle
Right? So, if I walked off this

00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:20.006 A:middle
stage this way, and then emerged

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:21.836 A:middle
that way, you'd be pretty

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:22.496 A:middle
amazed, right?

00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:24.776 A:middle
Because that's impossible.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:27.256 A:middle
So, we wanted to play into this

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:29.516 A:middle
consistent sense of space that

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.246 A:middle
we all have in the world.

00:12:31.806 --> 00:12:34.776 A:middle
And so, what that means is, if

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:36.116 A:middle
something is going out of view

00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:37.186 A:middle
in your interface, and coming

00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:39.156 A:middle
back into view, it should do so

00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:40.386 A:middle
in symmetric paths.

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:42.006 A:middle
It should have a consistent

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:44.606 A:middle
offscreen path as it enters and

00:12:44.606 --> 00:12:44.836 A:middle
leaves.

00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:45.756 A:middle
A good example of this is

00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:47.246 A:middle
actually iOS navigation.

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:48.706 A:middle
When I tap on an element in this

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:50.176 A:middle
list here, it slides in from the

00:12:50.176 --> 00:12:50.406 A:middle
right.

00:12:51.196 --> 00:12:52.636 A:middle
When I tap the back button, it

00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:53.866 A:middle
goes back to the right.

00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:55.656 A:middle
It's a symmetric path.

00:12:55.656 --> 00:12:57.276 A:middle
Each element has a consistent

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.626 A:middle
place where it lives at both

00:12:58.716 --> 00:12:59.286 A:middle
states.

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:01.296 A:middle
This also reinforces the

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:01.296 A:middle
This also reinforces the

00:13:01.296 --> 00:13:01.646 A:middle
gesture.

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.336 A:middle
If I choose to slide it myself

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.576 A:middle
to the right, because I know

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.586 A:middle
that's where it lives, I can do

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:05.786 A:middle
that.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:06.466 A:middle
It's expected.

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:08.686 A:middle
So, what if we didn't do this.

00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:10.236 A:middle
Here's an example, where when I

00:13:10.236 --> 00:13:11.816 A:middle
tap on something, it slides in,

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:13.926 A:middle
and then when I hit back it goes

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:14.316 A:middle
down.

00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:15.916 A:middle
And, it feels disconnected and

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:16.796 A:middle
confusing, right?

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.826 A:middle
It feels like I'm sending it

00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
somewhere.

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:20.626 A:middle
In fact, if I wanted to

00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:21.736 A:middle
communicate that I was sending

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:22.746 A:middle
it somewhere, this is how I

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:23.616 A:middle
could do it, right?

00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:26.496 A:middle
So, that's the topic of spatial

00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:27.246 A:middle
consistency.

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:29.396 A:middle
It helps the gesture feel

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:30.736 A:middle
aligned with our spatial

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:33.796 A:middle
understanding of the world.

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:36.766 A:middle
Now, the next one is to hint in

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:37.906 A:middle
the direction of the gesture.

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:40.216 A:middle
You know, we humans are always,

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:41.596 A:middle
kind of, predicting the next few

00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:43.356 A:middle
steps of our experience.

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:44.906 A:middle
We're always using the, kind of,

00:13:44.906 --> 00:13:46.026 A:middle
trajectories of everything

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.546 A:middle
that's happening in the world to

00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:48.796 A:middle
predict the next few steps of

00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:49.296 A:middle
emotion.

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:52.016 A:middle
So, we think it's great when an

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:53.456 A:middle
interface plays into that

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:53.906 A:middle
prediction.

00:13:54.556 --> 00:13:56.246 A:middle
So, if you have two states here,

00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:58.706 A:middle
initial state and a final state.

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
The object-- and you have an

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
The object-- and you have an

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:01.996 A:middle
intermediate transition.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:03.746 A:middle
The object should transition

00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:05.586 A:middle
smoothly between these two

00:14:05.586 --> 00:14:07.176 A:middle
states in a way that it grows

00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:08.416 A:middle
from the initial state to the

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:10.086 A:middle
final state, whether it's

00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:10.926 A:middle
through a gesture or an

00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:11.396 A:middle
animation.

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:13.856 A:middle
So, good example is Control

00:14:13.856 --> 00:14:14.486 A:middle
Center actually.

00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:16.476 A:middle
We have these modules here in

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:17.516 A:middle
Control Center, where as you

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:19.286 A:middle
press they grow up and out

00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:21.166 A:middle
towards your finger in the

00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:22.696 A:middle
direction of the final state,

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:25.226 A:middle
where it actually finally just

00:14:26.056 --> 00:14:26.426 A:middle
pops open.

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.596 A:middle
So, that's hinting.

00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:29.586 A:middle
It makes the gestures feel

00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:33.626 A:middle
expected, and predictable.

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:35.646 A:middle
Now, the next important

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:37.556 A:middle
principle is to keep touch

00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:38.786 A:middle
interactions lightweight.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:40.526 A:middle
You know the lightness of

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:41.836 A:middle
multitouch is one of the most

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:43.406 A:middle
underrated aspects of it, I

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:43.686 A:middle
think.

00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:46.386 A:middle
It enables the airy swipes and

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.576 A:middle
scrolls, and all the taps and

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:49.646 A:middle
stuff that we're all used to.

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:51.236 A:middle
It's all super lightweight.

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:53.876 A:middle
But, we also want to amplify

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:54.436 A:middle
their motion.

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:56.726 A:middle
You want to take a small input

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:58.566 A:middle
and make a big output, to give

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:00.336 A:middle
that satisfying feeling of

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:00.336 A:middle
that satisfying feeling of

00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:01.656 A:middle
moving or throwing something and

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:03.066 A:middle
having a magnified result.

00:15:03.096 --> 00:15:05.416 A:middle
So, how does this apply to our

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:06.006 A:middle
interfaces?

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:07.816 A:middle
Well, it starts with a short

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:08.476 A:middle
interaction.

00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:10.416 A:middle
A short, lightweight

00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:11.016 A:middle
interaction.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:14.256 A:middle
And, we use all our sensors, all

00:15:14.256 --> 00:15:15.766 A:middle
our technology, to understand as

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:16.586 A:middle
much about it.

00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:18.956 A:middle
To, sort of, generate a profile

00:15:18.956 --> 00:15:21.026 A:middle
of energy and momentum contained

00:15:21.026 --> 00:15:21.836 A:middle
within the gesture.

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:24.426 A:middle
Using everything we know,

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:26.256 A:middle
including position, velocity,

00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:28.116 A:middle
speed, force, everything we know

00:15:28.116 --> 00:15:30.566 A:middle
about it to generate a kind of,

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:32.366 A:middle
inertial profile of this

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:32.746 A:middle
gesture.

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.506 A:middle
And then we take that, and

00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:37.406 A:middle
generate an amplified extension

00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:37.986 A:middle
of your movement.

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:39.266 A:middle
It still feels like an extension

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:39.556 A:middle
of you.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.696 A:middle
So, you get that satisfying

00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:43.666 A:middle
result with a light interaction.

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:46.936 A:middle
So, a good example of this is

00:15:46.936 --> 00:15:47.876 A:middle
scrolling, actually.

00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:49.756 A:middle
Your finger's only onscreen for

00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:51.876 A:middle
a brief amount of time, but the

00:15:51.876 --> 00:15:53.496 A:middle
system is preserving all your

00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:54.926 A:middle
energy and momentum, and

00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:56.466 A:middle
gracefully transferring it into

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:57.066 A:middle
the interface.

00:15:58.276 --> 00:15:59.506 A:middle
So, what if it didn't have this?

00:16:00.566 --> 00:16:02.566 A:middle
Those same swipes, well, they

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:03.526 A:middle
wouldn't get you very far.

00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:07.946 A:middle
And, in order to scroll, you'd

00:16:07.946 --> 00:16:09.816 A:middle
have to do these long, laborious

00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:11.766 A:middle
swipes that would require a lot

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:12.686 A:middle
more manual input.

00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:14.616 A:middle
It would be a huge pain to use.

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:17.196 A:middle
Another good example of this is

00:16:17.296 --> 00:16:18.326 A:middle
swipe to go home.

00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:20.026 A:middle
The amount of time that your

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.026 A:middle
finger's onscreen is very light.

00:16:22.736 --> 00:16:26.016 A:middle
And, it's-- ends up making it a

00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:27.656 A:middle
much more liquid and lightweight

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.466 A:middle
gesture that still feels native

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:30.706 A:middle
to the medium of multitouch.

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:32.726 A:middle
While still being able to reuse

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:33.976 A:middle
a lot of your muscle memory from

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:35.346 A:middle
a button, because you move your

00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:36.676 A:middle
finger down on the screen, and

00:16:36.676 --> 00:16:37.686 A:middle
back up to the springboard.

00:16:38.306 --> 00:16:43.336 A:middle
And, it's not just swipes, it's

00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:44.446 A:middle
taps too.

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:46.166 A:middle
It's important for an interface

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:48.186 A:middle
to respond satisfyingly to every

00:16:48.186 --> 00:16:48.746 A:middle
interaction.

00:16:49.136 --> 00:16:50.416 A:middle
The interface is signaling to

00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:51.886 A:middle
you that it understood you.

00:16:52.336 --> 00:16:53.676 A:middle
It's so important for the

00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.096 A:middle
interface to feel alive and

00:16:55.096 --> 00:16:55.816 A:middle
connected to you.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:57.956 A:middle
So, that's the topic of

00:16:57.956 --> 00:16:58.886 A:middle
lightweightness and

00:16:58.946 --> 00:16:59.766 A:middle
amplification.

00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:03.246 A:middle
The next one is called

00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:04.006 A:middle
rubberbanding.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.156 A:middle
It means we're softly indicating

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:08.665 A:middle
boundaries of the interface.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:12.296 A:middle
So, in this example, the

00:17:12.296 --> 00:17:14.215 A:middle
interface is gradually and

00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:15.626 A:middle
softly letting you know that

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:16.266 A:middle
there's nothing there.

00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:17.346 A:middle
And, it's tracking you

00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:17.796 A:middle
throughout.

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:19.266 A:middle
It's always letting you know

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.165 A:middle
that it's understanding you.

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.026 A:middle
What happens if you didn't do

00:17:22.026 --> 00:17:22.246 A:middle
that?

00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:23.846 A:middle
Well, it would feel like this.

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:25.106 A:middle
It would feel super harsh and

00:17:25.106 --> 00:17:25.726 A:middle
disconcerting.

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:27.126 A:middle
You kind of hit a wall there.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:28.326 A:middle
It would feel broken, right?

00:17:28.776 --> 00:17:29.976 A:middle
And, you actually wouldn't know

00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:31.476 A:middle
the difference between a frozen

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.076 A:middle
phone, and phone that's just at

00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:34.046 A:middle
the top of the edge of the

00:17:34.046 --> 00:17:34.696 A:middle
screen, right?

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:36.406 A:middle
So, it's really important that

00:17:36.406 --> 00:17:37.456 A:middle
it's always telling you that

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:38.346 A:middle
you've reached the edge.

00:17:38.736 --> 00:17:41.706 A:middle
And, this applies to

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:42.666 A:middle
transitions, too.

00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:43.736 A:middle
It's not just about when you hit

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:45.086 A:middle
the edge, it's also when you

00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:46.836 A:middle
hand off from one thing to

00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:47.466 A:middle
another thing.

00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.926 A:middle
Tracking. So, a good example of

00:17:50.926 --> 00:17:53.026 A:middle
this is when you transition from

00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.366 A:middle
sliding up the dock to sliding

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:54.876 A:middle
up the app.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:56.926 A:middle
It doesn't just hit a wall, and

00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:58.006 A:middle
one thing stops tracking, and

00:17:58.006 --> 00:17:59.196 A:middle
then the other thing takes over.

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:01.466 A:middle
They both smoothly hand off in

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:01.466 A:middle
They both smoothly hand off in

00:18:01.526 --> 00:18:04.026 A:middle
smooth curves, so that you don't

00:18:04.026 --> 00:18:06.166 A:middle
feel like there's this harsh

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:07.696 A:middle
moment where you hand off from

00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:10.146 A:middle
one thing to another.

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:12.236 A:middle
Next one is to design smooth

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:13.216 A:middle
frames of motion.

00:18:14.546 --> 00:18:16.166 A:middle
So, imagine I have a little

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.206 A:middle
object here moving up and down.

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:18.936 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:18:19.636 --> 00:18:22.396 A:middle
But, we all know this object is

00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:23.626 A:middle
not really moving, right?

00:18:24.316 --> 00:18:25.456 A:middle
We're all just having the

00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:26.676 A:middle
perception of it moving.

00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:27.536 A:middle
Because we're seeing a bunch of

00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:29.466 A:middle
frames on the screen all at

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:31.456 A:middle
once, and it's giving us the

00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:32.476 A:middle
illusion of it moving.

00:18:33.096 --> 00:18:33.916 A:middle
So, if we took all of those

00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:35.306 A:middle
frames of motion, and kind of,

00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:36.176 A:middle
spread them out here.

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:37.806 A:middle
And we see the ball's in motion

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:40.356 A:middle
over time, the thing that we're

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:42.746 A:middle
concerned about is right around

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.566 A:middle
here, where there's too much

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:46.686 A:middle
visual change between the

00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
adjacent frames.

00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:50.846 A:middle
This is when the perception of

00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:52.266 A:middle
the interface becomes a little

00:18:52.336 --> 00:18:52.866 A:middle
choppy.

00:18:53.326 --> 00:18:54.786 A:middle
You get this visual strobing.

00:18:55.796 --> 00:18:57.246 A:middle
And, this is because the

00:18:57.246 --> 00:18:58.336 A:middle
difference between the two

00:18:58.456 --> 00:18:59.776 A:middle
frames is too much.

00:19:00.966 --> 00:19:02.736 A:middle
And, it strobes against your

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:03.626 A:middle
vision, so.

00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:04.576 A:middle
Here's an example of where you

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.656 A:middle
have two things both moving at

00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:07.766 A:middle
30 frames per second.

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:09.276 A:middle
But the one on the left looks a

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:10.596 A:middle
bit smoother than the one on the

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:11.476 A:middle
right, because the one on the

00:19:11.476 --> 00:19:14.036 A:middle
right is moving so fast, that

00:19:14.606 --> 00:19:15.336 A:middle
it's strobing.

00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:19.086 A:middle
My perception of vision is, kind

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:19.946 A:middle
of, breaking down.

00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:21.806 A:middle
I don't believe that it's moving

00:19:21.806 --> 00:19:22.676 A:middle
smoothly any more.

00:19:23.566 --> 00:19:24.896 A:middle
So, the important thing to take

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.446 A:middle
away is that it's not just about

00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:27.016 A:middle
framerate.

00:19:27.556 --> 00:19:28.876 A:middle
It's what's in the frames.

00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:31.426 A:middle
So, we're kind of limited by the

00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:32.956 A:middle
framerate, and how fast we can

00:19:32.956 --> 00:19:34.736 A:middle
move and still preserve a smooth

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:35.186 A:middle
motion.

00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
So, this one's in 30 frames per

00:19:37.806 --> 00:19:38.216 A:middle
second.

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:40.016 A:middle
If we move it up to 60 frames

00:19:40.016 --> 00:19:42.036 A:middle
per second, you can see that we

00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:43.286 A:middle
can actually go a little bit

00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:45.486 A:middle
faster, and still preserve

00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:46.406 A:middle
smooth motion.

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:47.776 A:middle
We can do faster movement

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:48.586 A:middle
without strobing.

00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:50.736 A:middle
And, there's addition tricks we

00:19:50.736 --> 00:19:51.726 A:middle
can do too, we can do things

00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:52.556 A:middle
like motion blur.

00:19:52.556 --> 00:19:55.696 A:middle
Motion blur basically bakes in

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:57.476 A:middle
more information in each frame

00:19:57.476 --> 00:19:59.276 A:middle
about the movement, like the way

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
your eyes work, and the way a

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
your eyes work, and the way a

00:20:00.406 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
camera works.

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
And you can also do-- take a

00:20:03.356 --> 00:20:05.396 A:middle
page from 2D animation and video

00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:07.026 A:middle
games by stretching, this-- this

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:07.786 A:middle
technique called motion

00:20:07.786 --> 00:20:09.536 A:middle
stretching stretches the content

00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:12.376 A:middle
in each frame to provide this

00:20:12.376 --> 00:20:14.876 A:middle
elastic look as it moves with

00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:15.466 A:middle
velocity.

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:19.246 A:middle
And so, in motion, it kind of

00:20:19.246 --> 00:20:20.086 A:middle
looks like this.

00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:22.126 A:middle
So, each of the different

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.866 A:middle
techniques, kind of, tries to

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:26.556 A:middle
encode more information visually

00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:28.466 A:middle
about what's going on in the

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:28.896 A:middle
motion.

00:20:29.546 --> 00:20:30.386 A:middle
And, I want to focus a little

00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:31.286 A:middle
bit on this last one here,

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.906 A:middle
motion stretching, because we do

00:20:32.906 --> 00:20:34.206 A:middle
this on iPhone 10, actually.

00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:36.136 A:middle
You know, when you launch an

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:39.066 A:middle
app, the icon elastically

00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:40.606 A:middle
stretches down to become the app

00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:41.636 A:middle
as it opens.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.726 A:middle
And, it stretches up in the

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:45.096 A:middle
opposite direction as you close

00:20:45.096 --> 00:20:45.556 A:middle
the app.

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:46.876 A:middle
To give you that little bit

00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:48.486 A:middle
extra information between each

00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:49.786 A:middle
frame of motion to make it a

00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:53.366 A:middle
little bit smoother-looking.

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:55.356 A:middle
Lastly, we want to work with

00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:57.546 A:middle
behavior rather than animation.

00:20:58.226 --> 00:20:59.226 A:middle
You know, things in the real

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.836 A:middle
world are always in a state of

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.836 A:middle
world are always in a state of

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:02.006 A:middle
dynamic motion, and they're

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
always being influenced by you.

00:21:03.886 --> 00:21:05.316 A:middle
They don't really work like

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
animations in the animation

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:07.366 A:middle
sense, right?

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.336 A:middle
There's no animation curve

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.786 A:middle
prescribed by real life.

00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:12.256 A:middle
So, we want to think about

00:21:12.256 --> 00:21:13.816 A:middle
animation and behavior more as a

00:21:13.866 --> 00:21:15.216 A:middle
conversation between you and the

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:15.626 A:middle
object.

00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:17.376 A:middle
Not prescribed by the interface.

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:20.226 A:middle
So, to move away from static

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:21.436 A:middle
things transitioning into

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.926 A:middle
animated things, instead think

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:23.806 A:middle
about behavior.

00:21:24.506 --> 00:21:26.206 A:middle
So, Nathan's about to dive deep

00:21:26.206 --> 00:21:26.826 A:middle
into this one.

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:28.546 A:middle
But, here's a quick example.

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:33.036 A:middle
So, in Photos, there's less mass

00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:36.256 A:middle
on the photos, because it's

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:38.586 A:middle
conceptually lighter.

00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:40.596 A:middle
But, then when you swipe apps,

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.386 A:middle
there's more mass on the apps.

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:44.366 A:middle
It's conceptually heavier, so we

00:21:44.366 --> 00:21:45.936 A:middle
give more mass to the system.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:54.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:56.366 A:middle
So, that's a little bit about

00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:58.606 A:middle
how to design interfaces that

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
think and work like us.

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
think and work like us.

00:22:02.876 --> 00:22:04.906 A:middle
In-- it starts with response.

00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:06.586 A:middle
To make things feel connected to

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.546 A:middle
you, and to accommodate the way

00:22:08.546 --> 00:22:09.876 A:middle
our minds are constantly in

00:22:09.876 --> 00:22:10.286 A:middle
motion.

00:22:11.156 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
To maintain spatial consistency,

00:22:13.246 --> 00:22:15.236 A:middle
to reinforce a consistent sense

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:17.286 A:middle
of space, and symmetric

00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:18.626 A:middle
transitions within that space.

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.136 A:middle
And, to hint in the direction of

00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:21.646 A:middle
the gesture.

00:22:22.046 --> 00:22:23.526 A:middle
To play into our prediction of

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.036 A:middle
the future.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:26.586 A:middle
And, to maintain lightweight

00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:28.286 A:middle
interactions, but amplify their

00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:28.686 A:middle
output.

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:31.286 A:middle
To get that satisfying response,

00:22:31.366 --> 00:22:32.196 A:middle
while still keeping the

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:33.386 A:middle
interaction airy and

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:33.836 A:middle
lightweight.

00:22:34.506 --> 00:22:38.036 A:middle
And, to have soft boundaries and

00:22:38.036 --> 00:22:39.076 A:middle
edges to the interface.

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:40.816 A:middle
That interface is always

00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:42.066 A:middle
gracefully responding to you,

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:43.356 A:middle
even when you hit an edge, or

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:44.696 A:middle
transition from tracking one

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.726 A:middle
thing to tracking the other.

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:49.456 A:middle
And, to design smooth dynamic

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:51.646 A:middle
behavior that works in concert

00:22:51.646 --> 00:22:51.976 A:middle
with you.

00:22:52.566 --> 00:22:57.516 A:middle
So, that's some principles for

00:22:57.516 --> 00:22:58.366 A:middle
how to approach building

00:22:58.366 --> 00:22:59.656 A:middle
interfaces that feel like an

00:22:59.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
extension of our minds.

00:22:59.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
extension of our minds.

00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
So, let's dive in a little

00:23:02.786 --> 00:23:03.136 A:middle
deeper.

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:04.096 A:middle
I'm going to turn it over to

00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:05.396 A:middle
Nathan de Vries, my colleague,

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:07.616 A:middle
to design motion-- to talk about

00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:09.006 A:middle
designing motion in a way that

00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:10.566 A:middle
feels connected to motion, to

00:23:10.566 --> 00:23:12.346 A:middle
the motion of both you and the

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:12.976 A:middle
natural world.

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:22.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:23.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chan.

00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:24.686 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.866 A:middle
My name's Nathan, and I'm super

00:23:26.866 --> 00:23:28.406 A:middle
excited to be here today to talk

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.796 A:middle
to you about designing with

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:30.806 A:middle
dynamic motion.

00:23:32.196 --> 00:23:34.666 A:middle
So, as Chan mentioned, our minds

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.326 A:middle
and our bodies are constantly in

00:23:36.326 --> 00:23:37.276 A:middle
a state of change.

00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:38.636 A:middle
The world around us is in a

00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:39.556 A:middle
state of change.

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.366 A:middle
And, this introduces this

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:44.566 A:middle
expectation that our interfaces

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.396 A:middle
behave the same way, as they

00:23:46.396 --> 00:23:48.466 A:middle
become more tactile, it shifts

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:50.766 A:middle
our expectations to be much

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:51.676 A:middle
higher fidelity.

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:54.686 A:middle
Now, one way we've used motion

00:23:54.686 --> 00:23:56.806 A:middle
in interfaces is through timed

00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:57.576 A:middle
animations.

00:23:58.286 --> 00:23:59.366 A:middle
A button is tapped on the

00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:01.746 A:middle
screen, and the reins are, kind

00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:01.746 A:middle
screen, and the reins are, kind

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.406 A:middle
of, handed over to the designer.

00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:06.016 A:middle
And, their job is to craft these

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:08.206 A:middle
perfect frames of animation

00:24:08.206 --> 00:24:09.076 A:middle
through time.

00:24:09.656 --> 00:24:11.816 A:middle
And, once that animation is

00:24:11.816 --> 00:24:13.306 A:middle
complete, the controls are

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:14.706 A:middle
handed back to the person using

00:24:14.706 --> 00:24:16.316 A:middle
the interface, for them to

00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:17.466 A:middle
continue interacting.

00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:19.536 A:middle
So, you can kind of think of

00:24:19.536 --> 00:24:21.286 A:middle
animation and interaction as

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:23.716 A:middle
being-- as moving linearly

00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:24.836 A:middle
through time in this, kind of,

00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:28.006 A:middle
call and response pattern.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.056 A:middle
In a fluid interface, the

00:24:30.056 --> 00:24:31.556 A:middle
dynamic nature of the person

00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:33.026 A:middle
using the interface kind of

00:24:33.026 --> 00:24:35.046 A:middle
shifts control over time away

00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:36.146 A:middle
from us as designers.

00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:39.016 A:middle
And, instead, our role is to

00:24:39.016 --> 00:24:42.186 A:middle
design how the motion behaves in

00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:43.686 A:middle
concert with an interaction.

00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:46.676 A:middle
And, we do this through these

00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:49.016 A:middle
continuous dynamic behaviors

00:24:49.346 --> 00:24:50.536 A:middle
that are always running, that

00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:51.646 A:middle
are always active.

00:24:52.206 --> 00:24:55.016 A:middle
So, it's these dynamic behaviors

00:24:55.056 --> 00:24:57.156 A:middle
that I'm going to, really focus

00:24:57.156 --> 00:24:57.676 A:middle
on today.

00:24:58.236 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
First of all, we're going to

00:24:58.236 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
First of all, we're going to

00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:02.756 A:middle
talk about seamless motion.

00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:06.226 A:middle
And, it's this element of motion

00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:07.486 A:middle
that makes it feel like the

00:25:07.486 --> 00:25:09.056 A:middle
dynamic motion is an extension

00:25:09.056 --> 00:25:09.656 A:middle
of yourself.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:11.896 A:middle
Then, we're going to take a look

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:12.386 A:middle
at character.

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:14.806 A:middle
How, even without timing curves,

00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:16.196 A:middle
and timed animations, we can

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:17.726 A:middle
introduce the concept of

00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:19.836 A:middle
playfulness, or character, or

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:22.566 A:middle
texture to motion in your

00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:23.206 A:middle
interfaces.

00:25:24.696 --> 00:25:26.196 A:middle
And finally, we'll look at how

00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:27.816 A:middle
motion itself gives us some

00:25:27.906 --> 00:25:29.916 A:middle
clues about what people intend

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:32.126 A:middle
to do with your interface.

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:33.456 A:middle
How we can resolve some

00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:35.176 A:middle
uncertainty about what a gesture

00:25:35.176 --> 00:25:36.796 A:middle
is trying to do by really

00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:38.816 A:middle
looking at the motion of the

00:25:38.816 --> 00:25:39.206 A:middle
gesture.

00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:44.206 A:middle
So, to kick things off, let's

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:45.516 A:middle
look at seamless motion.

00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:47.076 A:middle
What do I mean by seamless

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:47.466 A:middle
motion?

00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:49.866 A:middle
So, let's look at an example

00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:51.116 A:middle
that I think we can all

00:25:51.936 --> 00:25:53.496 A:middle
familiarize with.

00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:56.086 A:middle
So, here we have a car, and it's

00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:57.686 A:middle
cruising along at a constant

00:25:57.686 --> 00:25:58.086 A:middle
speed.

00:25:58.776 --> 00:25:59.636 A:middle
And then, the brakes are

00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
applied, slowing it down to a

00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
applied, slowing it down to a

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:02.126 A:middle
complete stop.

00:26:02.126 --> 00:26:05.636 A:middle
Let's look at it again, but this

00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:07.756 A:middle
time we'll plot out the position

00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:08.946 A:middle
of the car over time.

00:26:09.466 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
So, at the very start of this

00:26:12.826 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
curve it's, kind of, straight,

00:26:14.236 --> 00:26:15.816 A:middle
and pointing up to the right.

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:17.376 A:middle
And, this shows that the car's

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.056 A:middle
position is moving at a constant

00:26:19.056 --> 00:26:20.906 A:middle
rate, it's kind of unchanging.

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:22.626 A:middle
But then, you'll notice the

00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:24.356 A:middle
curve starts to bend, to

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:27.406 A:middle
smoothly curve away from this

00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:28.206 A:middle
straight line.

00:26:28.496 --> 00:26:29.696 A:middle
And, this is the brakes being

00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:30.166 A:middle
applied.

00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:32.016 A:middle
The car is decelerating from

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:33.346 A:middle
friction being introduced.

00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:35.796 A:middle
And, by the end of the curve,

00:26:35.796 --> 00:26:36.986 A:middle
the curve is completely flat,

00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:38.206 A:middle
horizontal, showing that the

00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:40.106 A:middle
position is now unchanging.

00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
That the car is stopped.

00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:45.916 A:middle
So, this position curve is

00:26:46.006 --> 00:26:47.726 A:middle
visualizing essentially what we

00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:49.236 A:middle
call seamless motion.

00:26:49.236 --> 00:26:51.446 A:middle
The line is completely unbroken,

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:53.676 A:middle
and there are no sudden changes

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.426 A:middle
in direction.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.376 A:middle
So, it's smooth and it's

00:26:57.376 --> 00:26:57.916 A:middle
seamless.

00:26:58.426 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
Even when, actually, new dynamic

00:26:58.426 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
Even when, actually, new dynamic

00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:01.626 A:middle
behaviors are being introduced

00:27:01.626 --> 00:27:02.816 A:middle
to the motion of the car, like a

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:04.316 A:middle
brake, which is applying

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:06.866 A:middle
friction to the car.

00:27:08.346 --> 00:27:09.536 A:middle
And, even when the car comes to

00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.396 A:middle
a complete stop, you'll notice

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.266 A:middle
that the curve is completely

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:13.656 A:middle
smooth.

00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:15.016 A:middle
There's this indiscernible

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:16.126 A:middle
quality to it.

00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.436 A:middle
You can't tell when the car

00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:18.486 A:middle
precisely stopped.

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:21.936 A:middle
So, why am I talking about cars?

00:27:21.936 --> 00:27:23.806 A:middle
This is a talk about fluid

00:27:23.806 --> 00:27:24.666 A:middle
interfaces, right?

00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:28.056 A:middle
So, we feel like the

00:27:28.056 --> 00:27:29.596 A:middle
characteristics of the physical

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:31.556 A:middle
world make for great behaviors.

00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:34.256 A:middle
Everyone in this room finds the

00:27:34.326 --> 00:27:36.786 A:middle
car example so simple because we

00:27:36.786 --> 00:27:38.276 A:middle
have a shared understanding, or

00:27:38.276 --> 00:27:40.486 A:middle
a shared intuition for how an

00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:42.206 A:middle
object like a car moves through

00:27:42.206 --> 00:27:42.676 A:middle
the world.

00:27:43.966 --> 00:27:44.906 A:middle
And, this makes us a great

00:27:44.906 --> 00:27:47.086 A:middle
reference point.

00:27:47.276 --> 00:27:48.186 A:middle
Now, I don't mean that we need

00:27:48.186 --> 00:27:49.736 A:middle
to build perfect physical

00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:51.516 A:middle
simulations of cars that

00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:53.086 A:middle
literally drive our interface.

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.476 A:middle
But, we can draw on the motion

00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:57.406 A:middle
of a car, of objects that we

00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:58.896 A:middle
throw or move around in the

00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:01.636 A:middle
physical world around us and use

00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:01.636 A:middle
physical world around us and use

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.676 A:middle
them in our own dynamic

00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:04.986 A:middle
behaviors to make their motion

00:28:04.986 --> 00:28:07.466 A:middle
feel familiar, or relatable, or

00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:09.086 A:middle
even believable, which is the

00:28:09.086 --> 00:28:11.756 A:middle
most important thing.

00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:13.666 A:middle
Now, this idea of referencing

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.646 A:middle
the physical world in dynamic

00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:17.906 A:middle
behaviors has been in the iPhone

00:28:17.906 --> 00:28:19.046 A:middle
since the very beginning with

00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
scrolling.

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:22.766 A:middle
A child can pick up an iPhone

00:28:22.766 --> 00:28:24.156 A:middle
and scroll to their favorite app

00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:25.936 A:middle
on the Home screen, just as

00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:27.376 A:middle
easily as they can push a toy

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:30.666 A:middle
car across the floor.

00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.716 A:middle
So, what are some key, kind of,

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:34.556 A:middle
characteristics of this

00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:36.116 A:middle
scrolling, dynamic behavior that

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:36.606 A:middle
we have?

00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.376 A:middle
Well, firstly it's tapping into

00:28:39.376 --> 00:28:41.236 A:middle
that intuition, that shared

00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:42.756 A:middle
understanding that we all have

00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:45.276 A:middle
for objects moving around in the

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:45.706 A:middle
world.

00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:47.256 A:middle
And, our influence on those

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:47.866 A:middle
objects.

00:28:49.296 --> 00:28:51.366 A:middle
The motion of the content is

00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:53.786 A:middle
perfectly seamless, so while I'm

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:55.086 A:middle
interacting with it, while I'm

00:28:55.086 --> 00:28:57.306 A:middle
dragging the content around, my

00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:59.096 A:middle
body is providing the fluidity

00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
of the movement, because my body

00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
of the movement, because my body

00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:01.386 A:middle
is fluid.

00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:03.766 A:middle
But, as soon as I let go of the

00:29:03.766 --> 00:29:06.926 A:middle
content, it seamlessly coasts to

00:29:06.926 --> 00:29:07.716 A:middle
a stop.

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.346 A:middle
So, we're kind of maintaining

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:11.146 A:middle
the momentum of the effort being

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:12.896 A:middle
put into the interface.

00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:15.896 A:middle
The amount of friction that's

00:29:15.956 --> 00:29:17.966 A:middle
being used for scrolling is

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:19.806 A:middle
consistent, which makes it

00:29:19.876 --> 00:29:21.576 A:middle
predictable, and very easy to

00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:22.026 A:middle
master.

00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:25.956 A:middle
And finally, the content comes

00:29:25.986 --> 00:29:28.096 A:middle
to an imperceptible stop, kind

00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:29.246 A:middle
of like the car, not really

00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:31.186 A:middle
knowing precisely when it came

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:31.696 A:middle
to a stop.

00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:34.016 A:middle
And, we feel that this distinct

00:29:34.516 --> 00:29:36.366 A:middle
lack of an ending kind of

00:29:36.366 --> 00:29:38.446 A:middle
reinforces this idea that the

00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:39.966 A:middle
content is always moving, and

00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:42.066 A:middle
always able to move, so while

00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:43.226 A:middle
content is scrolling, it makes

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:44.866 A:middle
it feel like you can just put

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.366 A:middle
your finger down again, and

00:29:46.466 --> 00:29:47.346 A:middle
continue scrolling.

00:29:47.346 --> 00:29:48.226 A:middle
You don't have to wait for

00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:49.166 A:middle
anything to finish.

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:53.186 A:middle
So, there are innumerable

00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:55.116 A:middle
characteristics of the physical

00:29:55.116 --> 00:29:56.756 A:middle
world that would make for great

00:29:56.756 --> 00:29:57.406 A:middle
behaviors.

00:29:58.136 --> 00:29:59.296 A:middle
We don't have time to talk about

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
them all, but I'd like to focus

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
them all, but I'd like to focus

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.346 A:middle
on this next one, because we

00:30:02.346 --> 00:30:04.276 A:middle
personally find it incredibly

00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:05.886 A:middle
indispensable in our own design

00:30:05.886 --> 00:30:05.976 A:middle
work.

00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:10.116 A:middle
So, materials like this

00:30:10.826 --> 00:30:12.626 A:middle
beautiful flower here, the

00:30:12.626 --> 00:30:14.386 A:middle
natural fibers of this flower

00:30:15.136 --> 00:30:17.106 A:middle
have this organic characteristic

00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:18.546 A:middle
called elasticity.

00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
And, elasticity is this tendency

00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.776 A:middle
for a material to gracefully

00:30:23.776 --> 00:30:26.526 A:middle
return into a resting state once

00:30:26.526 --> 00:30:28.036 A:middle
stress or strain is removed.

00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:31.766 A:middle
Our own bodies are incredibly

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:32.286 A:middle
elastic.

00:30:33.216 --> 00:30:34.746 A:middle
Now, we're capable of running

00:30:35.196 --> 00:30:37.626 A:middle
incredibly long distances, not

00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:38.956 A:middle
because of the strength of our

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:40.646 A:middle
muscles, but because of their

00:30:40.646 --> 00:30:41.786 A:middle
ability to relax.

00:30:43.296 --> 00:30:44.596 A:middle
It's their elasticity that's

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:45.156 A:middle
doing this.

00:30:46.296 --> 00:30:47.726 A:middle
So, our muscles contract and

00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:49.256 A:middle
relax once stress and strain is

00:30:49.256 --> 00:30:49.786 A:middle
removed.

00:30:49.896 --> 00:30:51.116 A:middle
And, this is how we conserve

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:51.556 A:middle
energy.

00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:53.856 A:middle
Makes us feel natural and

00:30:54.576 --> 00:30:54.806 A:middle
organic.

00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:58.476 A:middle
The same elasticity is used in

00:30:58.686 --> 00:30:59.206 A:middle
iPhone 10.

00:30:59.966 --> 00:31:01.546 A:middle
Tap an icon on the Home screen,

00:30:59.966 --> 00:31:01.546 A:middle
Tap an icon on the Home screen,

00:31:01.936 --> 00:31:03.836 A:middle
and an elastic behavior is

00:31:03.836 --> 00:31:05.156 A:middle
pulling the app towards you.

00:31:05.986 --> 00:31:07.626 A:middle
Bring it exactly where you want

00:31:07.626 --> 00:31:08.076 A:middle
it to be.

00:31:08.136 --> 00:31:09.566 A:middle
And, when you swipe from the

00:31:09.566 --> 00:31:12.046 A:middle
bottom, the app is placed back

00:31:12.046 --> 00:31:13.176 A:middle
on the Home screen in its

00:31:13.176 --> 00:31:14.136 A:middle
perfect position.

00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:18.326 A:middle
We also use elasticity in

00:31:18.326 --> 00:31:18.966 A:middle
scrolling.

00:31:19.366 --> 00:31:20.706 A:middle
So, if I scroll too far and

00:31:20.706 --> 00:31:21.966 A:middle
rubberband, like Chan was

00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:23.996 A:middle
talking about, when you let go,

00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:26.736 A:middle
the content uses elasticity to

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:29.256 A:middle
pull back within the boundaries,

00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.496 A:middle
helping you get into this

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:32.466 A:middle
resting position, ready for the

00:31:32.466 --> 00:31:33.656 A:middle
next time you want to scroll.

00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:37.126 A:middle
So, let's dig in a little deeper

00:31:37.126 --> 00:31:39.596 A:middle
on how this elasticity works

00:31:39.726 --> 00:31:40.636 A:middle
behind the scenes.

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.466 A:middle
You can think of the scrolling

00:31:44.466 --> 00:31:48.306 A:middle
content as a ball attached to a

00:31:49.456 --> 00:31:49.606 A:middle
spring.

00:31:49.786 --> 00:31:51.276 A:middle
On one end of the spring is the

00:31:51.416 --> 00:31:52.246 A:middle
current value.

00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:55.006 A:middle
This is where the content is on

00:31:55.006 --> 00:31:55.626 A:middle
the display.

00:31:56.616 --> 00:31:58.316 A:middle
And, the other end of the spring

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.146 A:middle
is where the content wants to go

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.146 A:middle
is where the content wants to go

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:01.596 A:middle
because of its elasticity.

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
So, you've got this spring

00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:04.226 A:middle
that's pulling the current value

00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:05.896 A:middle
towards the target.

00:32:06.136 --> 00:32:08.276 A:middle
Its behavior is influencing the

00:32:08.276 --> 00:32:09.376 A:middle
position of the content.

00:32:11.176 --> 00:32:13.126 A:middle
Now, the spring is essentially

00:32:13.126 --> 00:32:14.456 A:middle
pulling that current value

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:15.596 A:middle
towards the target.

00:32:16.636 --> 00:32:18.016 A:middle
And, what's interesting about a

00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:19.116 A:middle
spring is, it does this

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:19.986 A:middle
seamlessly.

00:32:19.986 --> 00:32:21.396 A:middle
This seamlessness is, kind of,

00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:23.756 A:middle
built in to the behavior.

00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:26.256 A:middle
And, this is what makes them

00:32:26.256 --> 00:32:28.356 A:middle
such versatile tools for doing

00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:30.176 A:middle
fluid interface design.

00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:32.426 A:middle
Is that you, kind of, get this

00:32:32.426 --> 00:32:33.196 A:middle
stuff for free.

00:32:33.536 --> 00:32:35.086 A:middle
It's baked in to the behavior

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:35.476 A:middle
itself.

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:40.326 A:middle
So, we love this behavior of a

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.876 A:middle
value moving towards a target.

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.766 A:middle
We can just tell the ball where

00:32:43.766 --> 00:32:45.126 A:middle
to go, and we'll get this

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:47.696 A:middle
seamless motion of the ball

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:48.896 A:middle
moving towards the target.

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:50.506 A:middle
But, we want a little bit more

00:32:50.506 --> 00:32:52.446 A:middle
control over how fast it moves.

00:32:53.016 --> 00:32:54.736 A:middle
And, whether it overshoots.

00:32:55.236 --> 00:32:55.986 A:middle
So, how do we do that?

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:58.326 A:middle
Well, we could give the ball a

00:32:58.326 --> 00:33:00.046 A:middle
little more mass, like make it

00:32:58.326 --> 00:33:00.046 A:middle
little more mass, like make it

00:33:00.106 --> 00:33:01.266 A:middle
bigger, or make it heavier.

00:33:02.296 --> 00:33:03.796 A:middle
And, if we do that, then it

00:33:04.236 --> 00:33:05.776 A:middle
changes the inertia of the ball,

00:33:06.106 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
or its willingness to want to

00:33:07.696 --> 00:33:08.536 A:middle
start moving.

00:33:09.116 --> 00:33:10.956 A:middle
Or, maybe its unwillingness to

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:12.126 A:middle
want to stop moving.

00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:13.746 A:middle
And, you end up with this little

00:33:13.746 --> 00:33:16.526 A:middle
overshoot that happens.

00:33:16.716 --> 00:33:17.786 A:middle
Another property that we could

00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:19.166 A:middle
change is the stiffness of the

00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:20.886 A:middle
spring, or the tensile strength

00:33:20.886 --> 00:33:21.566 A:middle
of the spring.

00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:23.066 A:middle
And, what this does, is it

00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:24.696 A:middle
affects the force that's being

00:33:24.696 --> 00:33:26.726 A:middle
applied to the ball, changing

00:33:26.726 --> 00:33:28.106 A:middle
how quickly it moves towards the

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:28.526 A:middle
target.

00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:31.786 A:middle
And, finally, much like the car,

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:34.506 A:middle
and the braking of a car, we can

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:36.156 A:middle
change the damping, or the

00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:37.936 A:middle
friction, of the surface that

00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:39.076 A:middle
the ball is sitting on.

00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:40.876 A:middle
And, this will act as, kind of,

00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:42.626 A:middle
a brake that slows the ball down

00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:44.776 A:middle
over time, also affecting our

00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:46.046 A:middle
ability to overshoot.

00:33:46.596 --> 00:33:50.576 A:middle
So, the physical properties of a

00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:51.946 A:middle
ball and a spring are, kind of,

00:33:52.176 --> 00:33:53.686 A:middle
physics class material, right?

00:33:53.686 --> 00:33:54.666 A:middle
It's super useful in a

00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:55.996 A:middle
scientific context, but we've

00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:57.946 A:middle
found that in our own design

00:33:57.946 --> 00:33:59.196 A:middle
work they can be a little bit

00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:01.336 A:middle
overwhelming or unwieldy for

00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:01.336 A:middle
overwhelming or unwieldy for

00:34:01.636 --> 00:34:02.996 A:middle
controlling the behavior of

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:04.426 A:middle
objects on the screen.

00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:07.376 A:middle
So, we think our design tool

00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:09.366 A:middle
should have a bit of a human

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:10.346 A:middle
interface to them.

00:34:10.786 --> 00:34:11.806 A:middle
That they need to reflect the

00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:12.906 A:middle
needs of the designer that's

00:34:13.056 --> 00:34:13.746 A:middle
using the tool.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.255 A:middle
And so, how do we go about that?

00:34:16.255 --> 00:34:17.246 A:middle
How do we simplify these

00:34:17.246 --> 00:34:18.806 A:middle
properties down to make it more

00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:20.626 A:middle
design friendly?

00:34:22.516 --> 00:34:24.396 A:middle
So, mass stiffness and damping

00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:25.815 A:middle
will remain behind the scenes,

00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:26.606 A:middle
they're the fundamental

00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:28.016 A:middle
properties of the spring system

00:34:28.016 --> 00:34:28.696 A:middle
that we're using.

00:34:28.696 --> 00:34:30.226 A:middle
But, we can simplify our

00:34:30.226 --> 00:34:31.775 A:middle
interface down to two simple

00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:32.266 A:middle
properties.

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:35.176 A:middle
The first is damping, which

00:34:35.176 --> 00:34:36.835 A:middle
controls how much or little

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.306 A:middle
overshoot there is from 100%

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:40.565 A:middle
damping, where there will be no

00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:43.136 A:middle
overshoot to 0% damping where

00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:44.545 A:middle
the spring would oscillate

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:45.246 A:middle
indefinitely.

00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:50.485 A:middle
The second property is response.

00:34:52.025 --> 00:34:53.565 A:middle
And, this controls how quickly

00:34:53.565 --> 00:34:55.186 A:middle
the value will try and get to

00:34:55.186 --> 00:34:55.735 A:middle
the target.

00:34:56.956 --> 00:34:58.296 A:middle
And, you might notice that I

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.956 A:middle
haven't used the word duration.

00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:02.506 A:middle
We actually like to avoid using

00:35:02.506 --> 00:35:03.986 A:middle
duration when we're describing

00:35:03.986 --> 00:35:05.456 A:middle
elastic behaviors, because it

00:35:05.456 --> 00:35:07.356 A:middle
reinforces this concept of

00:35:07.726 --> 00:35:09.506 A:middle
constant dynamic change.

00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:11.656 A:middle
The spring is always moving, and

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:12.866 A:middle
it's ready to move somewhere

00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:13.066 A:middle
else.

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:15.466 A:middle
Now, the technical terms for

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.016 A:middle
these two properties are damping

00:35:17.016 --> 00:35:18.836 A:middle
ratio and frequency response.

00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:20.426 A:middle
So, if you'd like to use these

00:35:20.426 --> 00:35:21.666 A:middle
for your own design work, you

00:35:21.666 --> 00:35:23.396 A:middle
can look up those terms, and

00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:25.866 A:middle
you'll find easy ways to convert

00:35:27.436 --> 00:35:27.546 A:middle
them.

00:35:27.776 --> 00:35:29.836 A:middle
So, we now have these two simple

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:31.116 A:middle
properties for controlling

00:35:31.116 --> 00:35:32.086 A:middle
elastic behaviors.

00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:35.166 A:middle
But, there's still an infinite

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.666 A:middle
number of possibilities that we

00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:38.106 A:middle
can have with these curves.

00:35:38.106 --> 00:35:39.836 A:middle
Like, there's just hundreds,

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:41.176 A:middle
thousands, millions of different

00:35:41.176 --> 00:35:42.756 A:middle
ways we can configure those two

00:35:42.756 --> 00:35:44.916 A:middle
simple properties and get very

00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:45.826 A:middle
different behavior.

00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:49.636 A:middle
How do we use these to craft a

00:35:49.636 --> 00:35:50.786 A:middle
character in our app?

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:53.996 A:middle
To control the feel of our app?

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
Well, first and foremost, we

00:35:56.286 --> 00:35:57.516 A:middle
need to remember that our

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:59.246 A:middle
devices are tools.

00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:02.716 A:middle
And, we need to respect that

00:36:03.276 --> 00:36:04.736 A:middle
tools, when they're used with

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:08.186 A:middle
purpose, require us to not be in

00:36:08.186 --> 00:36:09.836 A:middle
the way, not get in the way with

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:12.146 A:middle
introducing unnecessary motion.

00:36:13.366 --> 00:36:14.496 A:middle
So, we think that you should

00:36:14.496 --> 00:36:15.386 A:middle
start simple.

00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.266 A:middle
A spring doesn't need to

00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:18.146 A:middle
overshoot.

00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:19.746 A:middle
You don't need to use springy

00:36:19.746 --> 00:36:20.246 A:middle
springs.

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:23.426 A:middle
So, we recommend starting with

00:36:23.426 --> 00:36:26.146 A:middle
100% damping, or no overshoot

00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:27.446 A:middle
when you're tuning elastic

00:36:27.486 --> 00:36:28.026 A:middle
behaviors.

00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:30.056 A:middle
That way you'll get smooth,

00:36:30.286 --> 00:36:32.266 A:middle
graceful, and seamless motion

00:36:32.806 --> 00:36:33.996 A:middle
that doesn't distract from the

00:36:34.086 --> 00:36:34.916 A:middle
task at hand.

00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:36.446 A:middle
Like, just quickly shooting off

00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:36.986 A:middle
an email.

00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:40.836 A:middle
So, when is it appropriate to

00:36:40.836 --> 00:36:41.766 A:middle
use bounciness?

00:36:42.306 --> 00:36:43.346 A:middle
There's got to be a time when

00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:44.196 A:middle
that's appropriate, right?

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.526 A:middle
Well, we feel if the gesture

00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:48.796 A:middle
that's driving the motion itself

00:36:48.796 --> 00:36:50.886 A:middle
has momentum, then you should

00:36:50.886 --> 00:36:52.056 A:middle
reward that momentum with a

00:36:52.056 --> 00:36:53.066 A:middle
little bit of overshoot.

00:36:54.256 --> 00:36:56.496 A:middle
Put another way, if a gesture

00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:58.126 A:middle
has momentum, and there isn't

00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
any overshoot, it can often feel

00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
any overshoot, it can often feel

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:03.506 A:middle
broken or unsatisfying to have

00:37:03.566 --> 00:37:05.236 A:middle
the motion follow that gesture.

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:08.796 A:middle
An example of where we use this

00:37:08.796 --> 00:37:09.696 A:middle
is in the Music app.

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:12.186 A:middle
So, the Music app has a small

00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:14.076 A:middle
minibar representing Now Playing

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:15.796 A:middle
at the bottom of the screen, and

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:18.076 A:middle
you can tap the bar to show Now

00:37:18.076 --> 00:37:18.456 A:middle
Playing.

00:37:18.946 --> 00:37:22.306 A:middle
Because the tap doesn't have any

00:37:22.356 --> 00:37:24.316 A:middle
momentum in the direction of the

00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:26.286 A:middle
presentation of Now Playing, we

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.606 A:middle
use 100% damping to make sure it

00:37:28.636 --> 00:37:29.486 A:middle
doesn't overshoot.

00:37:30.126 --> 00:37:32.656 A:middle
But, if you swipe to dismiss Now

00:37:32.736 --> 00:37:34.506 A:middle
Playing, there is momentum in

00:37:34.506 --> 00:37:36.566 A:middle
the direction of the dismissal,

00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:39.166 A:middle
and so we use 80% damping to

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.426 A:middle
have a little bit of bounce and

00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:42.306 A:middle
squish, making the gesture a lot

00:37:42.306 --> 00:37:43.126 A:middle
more satisfying.

00:37:46.416 --> 00:37:48.766 A:middle
Bounciness can also be used as a

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.696 A:middle
utility, as a functional means.

00:37:51.476 --> 00:37:53.106 A:middle
It can serve as a helpful hint

00:37:53.176 --> 00:37:54.576 A:middle
that there's something more

00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:57.166 A:middle
below the surface.

00:37:57.306 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
With iPhone 10, we introduced

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.136 A:middle
two buttons to the cover sheet

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.136 A:middle
two buttons to the cover sheet

00:38:01.776 --> 00:38:03.056 A:middle
for turning on the Flashlight,

00:38:03.056 --> 00:38:04.476 A:middle
and for launching the Camera.

00:38:06.336 --> 00:38:08.246 A:middle
To avoid accidentally turning on

00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:09.906 A:middle
the flashlight by mistake, we

00:38:09.906 --> 00:38:11.416 A:middle
require a more intentional

00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:13.336 A:middle
gesture to activate the

00:38:13.336 --> 00:38:13.976 A:middle
Flashlight.

00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:16.006 A:middle
But, if you don't know that

00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:17.066 A:middle
there's a more intentional

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.906 A:middle
gesture needed to activate it,

00:38:19.696 --> 00:38:22.466 A:middle
when you tap on the button, it

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.206 A:middle
responds with bounciness.

00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:25.926 A:middle
Has this kind of playful feel to

00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:26.196 A:middle
it.

00:38:27.116 --> 00:38:28.756 A:middle
And, that hint is teaching you

00:38:28.756 --> 00:38:29.776 A:middle
not only that the button is

00:38:29.836 --> 00:38:30.466 A:middle
working, but that it's

00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:31.466 A:middle
responding to you.

00:38:31.636 --> 00:38:33.146 A:middle
But, it's kind of teaching you

00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:34.836 A:middle
that if you press just a little

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:37.426 A:middle
bit more firmly, it'll activate.

00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:38.236 A:middle
It's like teaching you.

00:38:38.236 --> 00:38:39.446 A:middle
It's hinting in the direction of

00:38:39.446 --> 00:38:40.086 A:middle
the motion.

00:38:40.696 --> 00:38:42.936 A:middle
So, bounciness can be used to

00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:47.396 A:middle
indicate this kind of thing.

00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:48.706 A:middle
Now, so far we've been talking

00:38:48.706 --> 00:38:50.806 A:middle
about using motion to move

00:38:50.866 --> 00:38:52.286 A:middle
things around, or to change

00:38:52.286 --> 00:38:54.096 A:middle
their scale, change their visual

00:38:54.096 --> 00:38:55.596 A:middle
representation on the screen.

00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:58.666 A:middle
But, we perceive motion in many

00:38:58.666 --> 00:38:59.386 A:middle
different ways.

00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:01.746 A:middle
Through changes in light and

00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:04.056 A:middle
color, or texture and feel.

00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:05.756 A:middle
Or even sound.

00:39:06.036 --> 00:39:07.876 A:middle
Many other sensations that we--

00:39:08.386 --> 00:39:11.656 A:middle
our senses can detect.

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.036 A:middle
We feel this is an opportunity

00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:15.556 A:middle
to go even further, go beyond

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:17.626 A:middle
motion, when you're tuning the

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:18.886 A:middle
character of your app.

00:39:19.946 --> 00:39:21.606 A:middle
By combining dynamic behaviors

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:23.256 A:middle
for motion with dynamic

00:39:23.256 --> 00:39:25.766 A:middle
behaviors for sound and haptics,

00:39:26.346 --> 00:39:28.256 A:middle
you can really fundamentally

00:39:28.256 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
change the way an interface

00:39:29.706 --> 00:39:29.976 A:middle
feels.

00:39:35.216 --> 00:39:37.746 A:middle
So, when you see, and you hear,

00:39:38.256 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
and you feel the result of the

00:39:40.076 --> 00:39:42.506 A:middle
gesture, it can transform what

00:39:42.506 --> 00:39:43.986 A:middle
was otherwise just a scrolling

00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:45.316 A:middle
behavior into something that

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:48.056 A:middle
feels like a very tactile

00:39:48.056 --> 00:39:48.746 A:middle
interface.

00:39:49.356 --> 00:39:53.206 A:middle
Now, there's one final note I

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:54.556 A:middle
want you thinking about when

00:39:54.556 --> 00:39:56.006 A:middle
you're crafting the character of

00:39:56.006 --> 00:39:56.396 A:middle
your app.

00:39:57.336 --> 00:39:59.086 A:middle
And, that's that it feels

00:39:59.086 --> 00:40:00.746 A:middle
cohesive, that you're staying in

00:39:59.086 --> 00:40:00.746 A:middle
cohesive, that you're staying in

00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
character.

00:40:01.186 --> 00:40:03.506 A:middle
Now, what does this mean?

00:40:04.816 --> 00:40:07.156 A:middle
So, even within your app, or

00:40:07.156 --> 00:40:08.726 A:middle
across the whole system, it's

00:40:08.726 --> 00:40:10.056 A:middle
important that you treat

00:40:10.056 --> 00:40:11.456 A:middle
behaviors as a family of

00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:12.136 A:middle
behaviors.

00:40:13.166 --> 00:40:15.206 A:middle
So, in scrolling for example,

00:40:15.706 --> 00:40:17.936 A:middle
when I scroll down a page, using

00:40:17.936 --> 00:40:19.946 A:middle
a scrolling behavior, and then I

00:40:19.946 --> 00:40:21.946 A:middle
tap the status bar to scroll to

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:23.196 A:middle
the stop of the page, using an

00:40:23.196 --> 00:40:24.176 A:middle
elastic behavior.

00:40:24.946 --> 00:40:27.316 A:middle
In both cases, the page itself

00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:28.626 A:middle
feels like it's moving in the

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.766 A:middle
same way, that it has the same

00:40:30.766 --> 00:40:32.086 A:middle
behavior, even though two

00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:33.506 A:middle
different types of behaviors are

00:40:33.506 --> 00:40:34.496 A:middle
driving its motion, are

00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:35.726 A:middle
influencing its motion.

00:40:37.036 --> 00:40:38.276 A:middle
Now, this extends beyond a

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:39.876 A:middle
single interaction like

00:40:39.986 --> 00:40:40.576 A:middle
scrolling.

00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:42.716 A:middle
It applies to your whole app.

00:40:43.236 --> 00:40:45.046 A:middle
If you have a playful app, then

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:46.016 A:middle
you should embrace that

00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:47.676 A:middle
character, and make your whole

00:40:47.676 --> 00:40:49.666 A:middle
app feel the same way.

00:40:49.876 --> 00:40:50.996 A:middle
So, that people-- once they

00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:52.506 A:middle
learn one behavior of your app,

00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:53.936 A:middle
they can pick up another

00:40:53.936 --> 00:40:55.666 A:middle
behavior really easily, because

00:40:55.666 --> 00:40:57.146 A:middle
we learn through repetition.

00:40:57.566 --> 00:40:59.636 A:middle
And, what we learn bleeds over

00:40:59.636 --> 00:41:00.896 A:middle
into other behaviors.

00:40:59.636 --> 00:41:00.896 A:middle
into other behaviors.

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:07.396 A:middle
So, next up, I'd like to talk a

00:41:07.396 --> 00:41:10.156 A:middle
little bit about aligning

00:41:10.186 --> 00:41:12.466 A:middle
motion, or dynamic motion, with

00:41:12.506 --> 00:41:12.976 A:middle
intent.

00:41:17.216 --> 00:41:19.146 A:middle
So, for a discrete interaction

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:21.906 A:middle
like a button, it's pretty clear

00:41:21.906 --> 00:41:23.406 A:middle
what the intent of the gesture

00:41:23.406 --> 00:41:23.756 A:middle
is.

00:41:23.966 --> 00:41:26.086 A:middle
Right? You've got three distinct

00:41:26.226 --> 00:41:28.036 A:middle
visual representations on screen

00:41:28.036 --> 00:41:28.276 A:middle
here.

00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:31.256 A:middle
And, when I tap one of them, the

00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:32.196 A:middle
outcome is clear.

00:41:33.856 --> 00:41:35.096 A:middle
But, with a gesture like a

00:41:35.216 --> 00:41:37.796 A:middle
swipe, the intent is less

00:41:37.866 --> 00:41:39.246 A:middle
immediately clear.

00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:41.456 A:middle
You could say that the intent is

00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:43.126 A:middle
almost encoded in the motion of

00:41:43.126 --> 00:41:45.176 A:middle
the gesture, and so it's our

00:41:45.176 --> 00:41:47.736 A:middle
job, our role, to interpret what

00:41:47.736 --> 00:41:50.006 A:middle
the motion means to decide what

00:41:50.226 --> 00:41:51.786 A:middle
we should do with it.

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.696 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:41:55.086 --> 00:41:56.546 A:middle
So, let's say I made a FaceTime

00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:58.046 A:middle
call, a one-on-one FaceTime

00:41:58.046 --> 00:42:01.216 A:middle
call, and in FaceTime, we have a

00:41:58.046 --> 00:42:01.216 A:middle
call, and in FaceTime, we have a

00:42:01.356 --> 00:42:03.036 A:middle
small video representation of

00:42:03.036 --> 00:42:04.816 A:middle
yourself in the corner of the

00:42:04.816 --> 00:42:05.296 A:middle
screen.

00:42:05.396 --> 00:42:07.276 A:middle
And, this is so I can see what

00:42:07.276 --> 00:42:08.256 A:middle
the person on the other end

00:42:08.256 --> 00:42:08.596 A:middle
sees.

00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:11.086 A:middle
We call this floating video the

00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:13.036 A:middle
PIP, short for picture in

00:42:13.036 --> 00:42:13.306 A:middle
picture.

00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:16.466 A:middle
Now, we give the PIP a floating

00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:18.146 A:middle
appearance to make it clear that

00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:19.166 A:middle
it can be moved.

00:42:20.026 --> 00:42:22.166 A:middle
And, it can be moved to any

00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:23.566 A:middle
corner of the screen, with just

00:42:23.566 --> 00:42:25.846 A:middle
a really lightweight flick.

00:42:27.636 --> 00:42:29.136 A:middle
So, if we compare that to the

00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:31.676 A:middle
Play, Pause, and Skip buttons,

00:42:32.646 --> 00:42:33.546 A:middle
like, what's the difference

00:42:33.586 --> 00:42:33.826 A:middle
here?

00:42:35.266 --> 00:42:36.116 A:middle
So, in this case, there's

00:42:36.116 --> 00:42:38.796 A:middle
actually four invisible regions

00:42:39.076 --> 00:42:39.976 A:middle
that we're dealing with.

00:42:40.656 --> 00:42:42.126 A:middle
No longer do we have these three

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:44.196 A:middle
distinct visual representations

00:42:44.196 --> 00:42:45.476 A:middle
on screen that are being tapped.

00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:47.176 A:middle
We kind of have to look at the

00:42:47.176 --> 00:42:49.436 A:middle
motion that's happening through

00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:52.446 A:middle
the gesture, and intuit what was

00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:52.786 A:middle
meant.

00:42:52.786 --> 00:42:54.266 A:middle
Which corner did we intend to go

00:42:54.266 --> 00:42:54.516 A:middle
to?

00:42:55.686 --> 00:42:57.236 A:middle
Now, we call these regions of

00:42:57.236 --> 00:42:59.246 A:middle
the screen endpoints of the

00:42:59.246 --> 00:42:59.676 A:middle
gesture.

00:43:00.506 --> 00:43:02.816 A:middle
And, when the PIP is thrown, our

00:43:02.816 --> 00:43:04.986 A:middle
goal is to find the correct

00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:06.086 A:middle
endpoint, the one that was

00:43:06.086 --> 00:43:06.746 A:middle
intended.

00:43:07.426 --> 00:43:09.726 A:middle
And, we call this aligning the

00:43:10.216 --> 00:43:11.896 A:middle
endpoint with the intent of the

00:43:11.896 --> 00:43:12.306 A:middle
gesture.

00:43:12.986 --> 00:43:17.446 A:middle
So, one approach for this is to

00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:18.936 A:middle
keep track of the closest

00:43:18.936 --> 00:43:21.366 A:middle
endpoint as I'm dragging the

00:43:21.936 --> 00:43:22.046 A:middle
PIP.

00:43:22.226 --> 00:43:24.056 A:middle
Now, this kind of works.

00:43:24.056 --> 00:43:25.286 A:middle
I can move the PIP to the other

00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:29.086 A:middle
corner of the screen, but it

00:43:29.086 --> 00:43:30.366 A:middle
starts to break down as soon as

00:43:30.366 --> 00:43:32.886 A:middle
I move the PIP a little bit

00:43:33.446 --> 00:43:33.596 A:middle
further.

00:43:33.776 --> 00:43:35.796 A:middle
Now, I actually need to drag the

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:38.506 A:middle
PIP quite far, like past halfway

00:43:38.676 --> 00:43:39.516 A:middle
over the screen.

00:43:39.636 --> 00:43:40.496 A:middle
Pretty close to the other

00:43:40.496 --> 00:43:40.836 A:middle
corner.

00:43:40.836 --> 00:43:42.606 A:middle
So, it's not really magnifying

00:43:42.606 --> 00:43:43.046 A:middle
my input.

00:43:43.046 --> 00:43:44.656 A:middle
It's not really working for me.

00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:47.056 A:middle
And, if I try and flick the PIP,

00:43:48.196 --> 00:43:49.566 A:middle
it kind of goes back to the

00:43:49.566 --> 00:43:50.586 A:middle
nearest corner, which isn't

00:43:50.586 --> 00:43:52.036 A:middle
necessarily what I expected.

00:43:52.146 --> 00:43:54.726 A:middle
So, the issue here is that we're

00:43:54.816 --> 00:43:56.206 A:middle
only looking at position.

00:43:56.366 --> 00:43:58.756 A:middle
We're completely ignoring the

00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:00.386 A:middle
momentum of the PIP, and its

00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:00.386 A:middle
momentum of the PIP, and its

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.236 A:middle
velocity when it's thrown.

00:44:03.446 --> 00:44:05.486 A:middle
So, how can we incorporate

00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:08.696 A:middle
momentum into deciding which

00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:09.646 A:middle
endpoint we go to?

00:44:10.256 --> 00:44:13.396 A:middle
So, to think about this, I think

00:44:13.396 --> 00:44:15.346 A:middle
we can set aside endpoints for a

00:44:15.346 --> 00:44:16.896 A:middle
moment, and take a step back.

00:44:17.816 --> 00:44:20.986 A:middle
And, just really simplify the

00:44:22.096 --> 00:44:22.326 A:middle
problem.

00:44:22.386 --> 00:44:23.686 A:middle
Ultimately, what I'm trying to

00:44:23.736 --> 00:44:26.186 A:middle
do here is move content around

00:44:26.186 --> 00:44:27.026 A:middle
on the screen.

00:44:27.796 --> 00:44:29.206 A:middle
And, I actually already have a

00:44:29.206 --> 00:44:31.126 A:middle
lot of muscle memory for doing

00:44:31.436 --> 00:44:35.466 A:middle
exactly that with scrolling.

00:44:35.876 --> 00:44:37.186 A:middle
So, why don't we use that here?

00:44:38.616 --> 00:44:40.326 A:middle
We use scrolling behaviors all

00:44:40.326 --> 00:44:41.496 A:middle
the time, so we have this

00:44:41.496 --> 00:44:44.596 A:middle
natural intuition for how far

00:44:44.596 --> 00:44:45.936 A:middle
content goes when I scroll.

00:44:47.366 --> 00:44:50.096 A:middle
So, here you can see that when I

00:44:50.096 --> 00:44:52.706 A:middle
scroll the PIP instead, it

00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:54.586 A:middle
coasts along, and it slows down,

00:44:54.866 --> 00:44:57.536 A:middle
using this familiar deceleration

00:44:58.176 --> 00:44:59.206 A:middle
that we're familiar with from

00:44:59.206 --> 00:44:59.796 A:middle
scrolling.

00:45:01.026 --> 00:45:02.896 A:middle
And, basically by taking

00:45:02.896 --> 00:45:05.066 A:middle
advantage of that here, we're

00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:06.906 A:middle
reinforcing things that people

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:07.876 A:middle
have learned elsewhere.

00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.786 A:middle
That the behavior is just doing

00:45:10.786 --> 00:45:15.426 A:middle
what was expected of the system.

00:45:15.566 --> 00:45:17.756 A:middle
Now this new, hypothetical,

00:45:18.126 --> 00:45:21.296 A:middle
imaginary PIP position is not

00:45:21.296 --> 00:45:21.566 A:middle
real.

00:45:21.566 --> 00:45:22.756 A:middle
We're not going to show the PIP

00:45:22.756 --> 00:45:24.056 A:middle
go here in the interface.

00:45:24.266 --> 00:45:25.196 A:middle
This is what we call a

00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:25.826 A:middle
projection.

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:28.656 A:middle
So, we've taken the velocity of

00:45:28.656 --> 00:45:30.526 A:middle
the PIP, when it was thrown.

00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:32.066 A:middle
We've, kind of, mixed in the

00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:34.336 A:middle
deceleration rate, and we end up

00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:35.926 A:middle
with this projected position

00:45:36.196 --> 00:45:38.586 A:middle
where it could go if we scrolled

00:45:39.416 --> 00:45:40.936 A:middle
it there.

00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:42.666 A:middle
And so, now instead of finding

00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:44.346 A:middle
the nearest endpoint to the PIP

00:45:45.056 --> 00:45:47.096 A:middle
when we throw, we can calculate

00:45:47.096 --> 00:45:49.466 A:middle
its projected position and move

00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:50.946 A:middle
there instead.

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:53.346 A:middle
So now, when I swipe from one

00:45:53.346 --> 00:45:55.036 A:middle
corner of the screen to another

00:45:55.036 --> 00:45:56.216 A:middle
with just a lightweight flick,

00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:58.216 A:middle
it goes to the endpoint that I

00:45:58.216 --> 00:45:58.956 A:middle
expected.

00:46:03.176 --> 00:46:05.306 A:middle
So, this idea of projecting

00:46:05.306 --> 00:46:08.346 A:middle
momentum is incredibly useful.

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:10.406 A:middle
And, we think its super

00:46:10.406 --> 00:46:10.806 A:middle
important.

00:46:10.806 --> 00:46:12.136 A:middle
I'd like to share some code for

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.536 A:middle
doing this with you, so that you

00:46:13.536 --> 00:46:16.196 A:middle
can do this in your own apps.

00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:17.596 A:middle
So, this function will take a

00:46:17.596 --> 00:46:19.366 A:middle
velocity like the PIP's position

00:46:19.366 --> 00:46:22.086 A:middle
velocity, and deceleration rate,

00:46:22.956 --> 00:46:24.966 A:middle
and it'll give you the value

00:46:24.996 --> 00:46:26.086 A:middle
that you could use as an

00:46:26.336 --> 00:46:28.206 A:middle
endpoint for dynamic behavior.

00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:29.876 A:middle
It's pretty simple.

00:46:30.556 --> 00:46:33.056 A:middle
If we look at my FaceTime

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:35.606 A:middle
example of the pan gesture

00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:38.556 A:middle
ending code, you can see that

00:46:38.556 --> 00:46:39.186 A:middle
I'm just using the

00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:41.326 A:middle
UIScrollView.DecelerationRate.

00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:43.106 A:middle
So, we're leaning on that

00:46:43.106 --> 00:46:44.556 A:middle
familiarity people have with

00:46:44.556 --> 00:46:46.186 A:middle
scrolling and how far content

00:46:46.186 --> 00:46:47.106 A:middle
will go when scrolled.

00:46:48.256 --> 00:46:50.966 A:middle
And, I'm using that with my

00:46:51.176 --> 00:46:51.846 A:middle
projection.

00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:53.536 A:middle
So, I take the velocity of the

00:46:53.606 --> 00:46:55.546 A:middle
PIP and the deceleration rate,

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:57.376 A:middle
and I create that imaginary PIP

00:46:57.416 --> 00:46:57.976 A:middle
position.

00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:01.336 A:middle
And, it's this imaginary,

00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:01.336 A:middle
And, it's this imaginary,

00:47:01.336 --> 00:47:03.196 A:middle
projected position that I then

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:04.676 A:middle
use as the nearest corner

00:47:04.676 --> 00:47:05.246 A:middle
position.

00:47:06.246 --> 00:47:07.616 A:middle
And, I send my PIP there, by

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.166 A:middle
retargeting it.

00:47:11.236 --> 00:47:13.406 A:middle
So, this idea of using

00:47:13.836 --> 00:47:17.156 A:middle
projection to find out the

00:47:17.216 --> 00:47:19.266 A:middle
endpoint of a position, is

00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:21.026 A:middle
incredibly useful for things

00:47:21.026 --> 00:47:22.366 A:middle
being dragged or swiped, where

00:47:22.366 --> 00:47:23.676 A:middle
you really need to respect the

00:47:23.676 --> 00:47:24.856 A:middle
momentum of the gesture.

00:47:26.396 --> 00:47:27.516 A:middle
But, this projection function

00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:29.706 A:middle
isn't just useful for positions,

00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:31.756 A:middle
you can also use it for scales,

00:47:32.636 --> 00:47:34.126 A:middle
or even for rotations.

00:47:35.026 --> 00:47:36.506 A:middle
Or, even combinations of the

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:36.876 A:middle
two.

00:47:37.866 --> 00:47:39.496 A:middle
It's a really versatile tool

00:47:39.496 --> 00:47:40.696 A:middle
that you should really be using

00:47:40.696 --> 00:47:41.796 A:middle
to make sure that you're

00:47:41.836 --> 00:47:43.866 A:middle
respecting the momentum of a

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:45.856 A:middle
gesture, and making it feel like

00:47:46.036 --> 00:47:47.326 A:middle
the dynamic motion in your app

00:47:47.766 --> 00:47:49.186 A:middle
is an extension of yourself.

00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:53.776 A:middle
So, that's designing with

00:47:53.906 --> 00:47:54.496 A:middle
motion.

00:47:54.976 --> 00:47:55.936 A:middle
Dynamic motion.

00:47:56.896 --> 00:47:58.916 A:middle
Behaviors should continuously

00:47:58.916 --> 00:48:00.986 A:middle
and seamlessly work in concert

00:47:58.916 --> 00:48:00.986 A:middle
and seamlessly work in concert

00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:02.946 A:middle
with interactions.

00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:06.976 A:middle
We should be leaning on that

00:48:06.976 --> 00:48:08.646 A:middle
shared intuition that we have

00:48:08.646 --> 00:48:10.086 A:middle
for the physical world around

00:48:10.086 --> 00:48:10.406 A:middle
us.

00:48:10.896 --> 00:48:11.916 A:middle
The things that we learn as

00:48:11.916 --> 00:48:13.316 A:middle
children about how objects

00:48:13.366 --> 00:48:14.766 A:middle
behave and move in the physical

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:17.506 A:middle
world, apply just as readily to

00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:19.236 A:middle
our dynamic interfaces.

00:48:21.076 --> 00:48:22.246 A:middle
You should remember that

00:48:22.246 --> 00:48:23.416 A:middle
bounciness needs to be

00:48:23.476 --> 00:48:24.146 A:middle
purposeful.

00:48:24.856 --> 00:48:26.346 A:middle
Think about why you're using it,

00:48:26.456 --> 00:48:27.666 A:middle
and whether it's appropriate.

00:48:28.336 --> 00:48:29.686 A:middle
And, make sure that as you add

00:48:30.206 --> 00:48:32.856 A:middle
character, and texture, that

00:48:32.856 --> 00:48:33.726 A:middle
you're balancing it with

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:34.326 A:middle
utility.

00:48:35.066 --> 00:48:38.096 A:middle
And finally, remember to project

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:38.866 A:middle
momentum.

00:48:39.226 --> 00:48:40.836 A:middle
Don't just use position, use all

00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:41.826 A:middle
of the information that's at

00:48:41.826 --> 00:48:43.586 A:middle
your disposal to ensure that

00:48:43.586 --> 00:48:45.576 A:middle
motion is aligned with the

00:48:45.576 --> 00:48:47.166 A:middle
intent of where people actually

00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:47.616 A:middle
want to go.

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:51.376 A:middle
And then, take them there.

00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:52.356 A:middle
So, to talk a little bit more

00:48:52.356 --> 00:48:54.126 A:middle
about how to fluidly respond to

00:48:54.276 --> 00:48:56.146 A:middle
gestures and interactions, I'd

00:48:56.146 --> 00:48:57.466 A:middle
like to introduce my colleague,

00:48:57.466 --> 00:48:58.626 A:middle
Marcos, to the stage.

00:48:59.006 --> 00:48:59.956 A:middle
Thanks for having me, everyone.

00:49:00.516 --> 00:49:05.086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:06.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was great.

00:49:06.836 --> 00:49:07.906 A:middle
Thanks, Nathan.

00:49:13.446 --> 00:49:14.176 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:15.936 A:middle
My name is Marcos.

00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:18.816 A:middle
So far, we've seen how important

00:49:18.816 --> 00:49:20.266 A:middle
fluidity is when designing

00:49:20.266 --> 00:49:20.956 A:middle
interfaces.

00:49:21.786 --> 00:49:24.096 A:middle
And, a lot of that comes from

00:49:24.096 --> 00:49:25.366 A:middle
your interaction with a device.

00:49:26.776 --> 00:49:28.366 A:middle
So, in this section, we're going

00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:29.996 A:middle
to show you how touches on the

00:49:29.996 --> 00:49:32.136 A:middle
screen become gestures in your

00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:32.566 A:middle
apps.

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.316 A:middle
And, how to design these

00:49:34.366 --> 00:49:36.106 A:middle
gestures to capture all the

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.746 A:middle
expression and intent into your

00:49:37.746 --> 00:49:38.476 A:middle
interfaces.

00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:43.206 A:middle
So, we're going to start by

00:49:43.206 --> 00:49:44.656 A:middle
looking at the design of some

00:49:44.656 --> 00:49:46.366 A:middle
core gestures like taps and

00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:46.936 A:middle
swipes.

00:49:47.966 --> 00:49:48.956 A:middle
Then, we'll look at some

00:49:48.956 --> 00:49:50.586 A:middle
interaction principles, that you

00:49:50.586 --> 00:49:51.606 A:middle
should follow when designing

00:49:51.606 --> 00:49:52.956 A:middle
gestures for your interface.

00:49:54.176 --> 00:49:55.686 A:middle
And then, we'll see how to deal

00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:57.386 A:middle
with multiple gestures, and how

00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:59.376 A:middle
to combine them into your apps.

00:50:00.116 --> 00:50:01.956 A:middle
We're going to start by looking

00:50:01.956 --> 00:50:03.196 A:middle
at a gesture that is apparently

00:50:03.196 --> 00:50:04.926 A:middle
very simple, a tap.

00:50:05.786 --> 00:50:07.006 A:middle
You would think that something--

00:50:07.006 --> 00:50:08.866 A:middle
you would think that a tap is

00:50:08.866 --> 00:50:09.786 A:middle
something that doesn't have to

00:50:09.786 --> 00:50:11.396 A:middle
be designed, but you'll see how

00:50:11.396 --> 00:50:13.006 A:middle
its behavior has more nuances

00:50:13.006 --> 00:50:13.766 A:middle
than it seems.

00:50:14.896 --> 00:50:16.926 A:middle
In our example, we're going to

00:50:16.926 --> 00:50:18.856 A:middle
look at tapping on a button, in

00:50:18.856 --> 00:50:19.916 A:middle
this case, on the Calculator

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:19.983 A:middle
app.

00:50:24.476 --> 00:50:26.216 A:middle
The first thing to remember is

00:50:26.216 --> 00:50:27.276 A:middle
that the button should highlight

00:50:27.276 --> 00:50:29.176 A:middle
immediately when I touch down on

00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:29.346 A:middle
it.

00:50:30.226 --> 00:50:31.246 A:middle
This shows me the button is

00:50:31.246 --> 00:50:32.916 A:middle
working, and that the system is

00:50:32.916 --> 00:50:34.026 A:middle
reacting to my gesture.

00:50:34.766 --> 00:50:36.526 A:middle
But, we shouldn't confirm the

00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:39.006 A:middle
tap until my touch goes up.

00:50:39.976 --> 00:50:41.866 A:middle
The next thing to remember is to

00:50:41.866 --> 00:50:43.456 A:middle
create an extra margin around

00:50:43.456 --> 00:50:44.006 A:middle
the tap area.

00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:46.516 A:middle
This extra margin will make our

00:50:46.516 --> 00:50:48.506 A:middle
taps more comfortable, and avoid

00:50:48.506 --> 00:50:50.336 A:middle
accidental cancellations if a

00:50:50.336 --> 00:50:51.906 A:middle
touch moves during interaction.

00:50:52.376 --> 00:50:54.746 A:middle
And, like my colleague Chan was

00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:56.276 A:middle
saying, I should be able to

00:50:56.276 --> 00:50:57.386 A:middle
change my mind after I've

00:50:57.456 --> 00:50:58.566 A:middle
touched down on the button.

00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:00.686 A:middle
So, if I drag my finger outside

00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:00.686 A:middle
So, if I drag my finger outside

00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:02.976 A:middle
the tap area, and lift it, I can

00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:04.346 A:middle
cancel the tap.

00:51:05.056 --> 00:51:07.266 A:middle
The same way, if I swipe it back

00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:08.686 A:middle
on the button, the button should

00:51:08.686 --> 00:51:09.896 A:middle
highlight again, and let me

00:51:09.896 --> 00:51:11.226 A:middle
confirm the tap.

00:51:12.956 --> 00:51:16.066 A:middle
The next gesture we're going to

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.756 A:middle
talk about is swipe.

00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:19.816 A:middle
Swipes are one of the core

00:51:19.856 --> 00:51:21.786 A:middle
gestures of iOS, and they're

00:51:21.786 --> 00:51:23.466 A:middle
used for multiple actions like

00:51:23.466 --> 00:51:25.316 A:middle
scrolling, dragging, and paging.

00:51:26.606 --> 00:51:27.826 A:middle
But, no matter what you use it

00:51:27.826 --> 00:51:30.006 A:middle
for, or how you call it, the

00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:31.506 A:middle
core principles of a gesture are

00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:32.106 A:middle
always the same.

00:51:32.106 --> 00:51:35.026 A:middle
In this example, we're going to

00:51:35.026 --> 00:51:36.626 A:middle
use a swipe to drag this image

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:37.116 A:middle
to the right.

00:51:38.026 --> 00:51:39.956 A:middle
So, the interaction starts the

00:51:39.956 --> 00:51:40.976 A:middle
moment I touch down on the image

00:51:40.976 --> 00:51:41.976 A:middle
with intention to drag it.

00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:49.126 A:middle
But, before we can be sure it's

00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:50.716 A:middle
a swipe, the touch has to move a

00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:51.576 A:middle
certain distance.

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:53.876 A:middle
We learn to differentiate swipes

00:51:53.876 --> 00:51:54.976 A:middle
from other gestures.

00:51:55.516 --> 00:51:56.956 A:middle
This distance is called

00:51:56.956 --> 00:51:58.866 A:middle
hysteresis, and is usually 10

00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.006 A:middle
points in iOS.

00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.006 A:middle
points in iOS.

00:52:01.456 --> 00:52:03.266 A:middle
So, once the touch reaches this

00:52:03.266 --> 00:52:04.776 A:middle
distance, the swipe begins.

00:52:05.976 --> 00:52:07.706 A:middle
This is also a good moment to

00:52:07.706 --> 00:52:08.706 A:middle
decide the direction of the

00:52:08.706 --> 00:52:09.086 A:middle
swipe.

00:52:09.516 --> 00:52:11.366 A:middle
If it's horizontal, or vertical

00:52:11.366 --> 00:52:12.136 A:middle
for instance.

00:52:12.526 --> 00:52:13.796 A:middle
We don't really need it for

00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:15.766 A:middle
example, but it's very useful in

00:52:15.766 --> 00:52:16.626 A:middle
some situations.

00:52:16.626 --> 00:52:19.356 A:middle
So, now that the swipe has been

00:52:19.356 --> 00:52:20.856 A:middle
detected, this is the initial

00:52:20.856 --> 00:52:21.976 A:middle
position of a gesture.

00:52:22.816 --> 00:52:24.746 A:middle
After this moment, the touch and

00:52:24.746 --> 00:52:26.516 A:middle
the image should stay together

00:52:26.516 --> 00:52:27.686 A:middle
and move as one thing.

00:52:28.286 --> 00:52:29.426 A:middle
We should respect the relative

00:52:29.426 --> 00:52:31.106 A:middle
position, and never use the

00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:32.396 A:middle
center of the image as the

00:52:32.396 --> 00:52:33.186 A:middle
dragging point.

00:52:34.266 --> 00:52:35.456 A:middle
During the drag, we should also

00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:36.926 A:middle
keep track of the position and

00:52:36.926 --> 00:52:38.576 A:middle
speed up the touch, so when the

00:52:38.576 --> 00:52:40.136 A:middle
drag is over, we don't use the

00:52:40.136 --> 00:52:41.036 A:middle
last position.

00:52:41.406 --> 00:52:42.846 A:middle
We use the history of the touch,

00:52:42.966 --> 00:52:44.876 A:middle
to ensure that all the motion is

00:52:44.876 --> 00:52:46.436 A:middle
transferred fluidly into the

00:52:46.436 --> 00:52:46.896 A:middle
image.

00:52:50.296 --> 00:52:52.286 A:middle
So, as we've seen, touch and

00:52:52.316 --> 00:52:53.906 A:middle
content should move together.

00:52:54.436 --> 00:52:56.136 A:middle
One-to-one tracking is extremely

00:52:56.136 --> 00:52:56.806 A:middle
important.

00:52:57.406 --> 00:52:59.436 A:middle
When swiping or dragging, the

00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:00.696 A:middle
contents should stay attached to

00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:00.696 A:middle
contents should stay attached to

00:53:00.696 --> 00:53:01.326 A:middle
the gesture.

00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:04.066 A:middle
This is one of the principles of

00:53:04.066 --> 00:53:04.516 A:middle
iOS.

00:53:05.086 --> 00:53:06.706 A:middle
You enable scrolling, and makes

00:53:06.706 --> 00:53:08.106 A:middle
the device feel natural and

00:53:08.106 --> 00:53:08.466 A:middle
intuitive.

00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:11.406 A:middle
It's so recognizable and

00:53:11.406 --> 00:53:13.196 A:middle
expected that the moment the

00:53:13.196 --> 00:53:14.446 A:middle
touch and content stop tracking

00:53:14.446 --> 00:53:16.076 A:middle
one-to-one, we immediately

00:53:16.076 --> 00:53:16.646 A:middle
notice it.

00:53:17.106 --> 00:53:18.346 A:middle
And, in the case of scrolling,

00:53:18.406 --> 00:53:20.106 A:middle
it shows us that we've reached

00:53:20.106 --> 00:53:21.836 A:middle
the end of the content.

00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:25.826 A:middle
But, one-to-one tracking is not

00:53:25.826 --> 00:53:27.106 A:middle
limited to touch screens.

00:53:27.686 --> 00:53:30.096 A:middle
For instance, manipulating UI on

00:53:30.096 --> 00:53:31.736 A:middle
the Apple TV was designed around

00:53:31.736 --> 00:53:32.426 A:middle
this concept.

00:53:33.486 --> 00:53:34.686 A:middle
So, even if the touch is not

00:53:34.686 --> 00:53:35.796 A:middle
manipulating the content

00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:37.316 A:middle
directly, having a direct

00:53:37.316 --> 00:53:38.736 A:middle
connection between the gesture

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:40.436 A:middle
and the interface puts you in

00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:42.106 A:middle
control of the action, and makes

00:53:42.106 --> 00:53:43.246 A:middle
the interaction intuitive.

00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:48.776 A:middle
Another core principle when

00:53:48.776 --> 00:53:50.146 A:middle
designing gestures, is to

00:53:50.146 --> 00:53:51.366 A:middle
provide continuous feedback

00:53:51.366 --> 00:53:52.456 A:middle
during the interaction.

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.176 A:middle
And, this is not just limited to

00:53:54.176 --> 00:53:55.166 A:middle
swipes or drags.

00:53:55.706 --> 00:53:57.536 A:middle
It applies to all interactions.

00:53:58.146 --> 00:53:59.706 A:middle
So, if you look again at the

00:53:59.706 --> 00:54:00.956 A:middle
Flashlight button on the iPhone

00:53:59.706 --> 00:54:00.956 A:middle
Flashlight button on the iPhone

00:54:00.956 --> 00:54:03.296 A:middle
10, the size of button changes

00:54:03.626 --> 00:54:04.666 A:middle
based on the pressure of my

00:54:04.666 --> 00:54:05.176 A:middle
touch.

00:54:05.786 --> 00:54:06.426 A:middle
And, this gives me a

00:54:06.426 --> 00:54:07.846 A:middle
confirmation of my action.

00:54:08.136 --> 00:54:09.376 A:middle
It shows me the system is

00:54:09.376 --> 00:54:11.206 A:middle
responding to my gesture, but it

00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.946 A:middle
also teaches me that pressing

00:54:12.946 --> 00:54:14.706 A:middle
harder will eventually turn on

00:54:14.706 --> 00:54:15.306 A:middle
the flashlight.

00:54:15.736 --> 00:54:18.246 A:middle
Another good example of

00:54:18.246 --> 00:54:19.966 A:middle
continuous feedback, is the

00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:21.446 A:middle
focus engine on the Apple TV.

00:54:22.466 --> 00:54:23.606 A:middle
So, the movements on the Siri

00:54:23.606 --> 00:54:25.146 A:middle
remote are continuously

00:54:25.146 --> 00:54:26.486 A:middle
represented on the screen.

00:54:26.956 --> 00:54:28.596 A:middle
And, they show me the item that

00:54:28.596 --> 00:54:30.456 A:middle
is currently selected, the

00:54:30.456 --> 00:54:31.736 A:middle
moment the selection is going to

00:54:31.736 --> 00:54:33.666 A:middle
change, and the direction the

00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:37.516 A:middle
selection is going to go.

00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:39.286 A:middle
So, having our UI respond during

00:54:39.286 --> 00:54:41.176 A:middle
the gesture is critical to

00:54:41.176 --> 00:54:42.496 A:middle
create a fluid experience.

00:54:42.886 --> 00:54:44.416 A:middle
For that reason, when

00:54:44.416 --> 00:54:46.146 A:middle
implementing your gestures, you

00:54:46.146 --> 00:54:47.566 A:middle
should avoid methods that are

00:54:47.566 --> 00:54:48.906 A:middle
only detected at the end of the

00:54:48.906 --> 00:54:49.986 A:middle
gesture, like

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.566 A:middle
UISwipeGestureRecognizer.

00:54:52.236 --> 00:54:53.586 A:middle
And, use ones like the actual

00:54:53.586 --> 00:54:54.876 A:middle
touches, or other

00:54:54.926 --> 00:54:56.916 A:middle
gestureRecognizers that provide

00:54:56.916 --> 00:54:58.306 A:middle
all possible information about

00:54:58.306 --> 00:54:59.466 A:middle
the gesture.

00:55:00.586 --> 00:55:01.846 A:middle
So, not just the position, but

00:55:01.846 --> 00:55:03.996 A:middle
also the velocity, the pressure,

00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:07.886 A:middle
the size of the touch.

00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:10.106 A:middle
In most situations though, your

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:12.006 A:middle
interfaces must respond to more

00:55:12.006 --> 00:55:12.856 A:middle
than one gesture.

00:55:13.586 --> 00:55:14.836 A:middle
As you keep adding features to

00:55:14.836 --> 00:55:16.766 A:middle
your apps, the complexity and

00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:18.446 A:middle
number of gestures increases,

00:55:19.216 --> 00:55:19.296 A:middle
too.

00:55:19.836 --> 00:55:21.976 A:middle
For instance, almost all UIs

00:55:21.976 --> 00:55:23.476 A:middle
that use a scroll view will have

00:55:23.476 --> 00:55:25.196 A:middle
other gestures like taps and

00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.626 A:middle
swipes competing with each

00:55:26.626 --> 00:55:26.996 A:middle
other.

00:55:27.476 --> 00:55:29.116 A:middle
Like in this example, I can

00:55:29.116 --> 00:55:30.846 A:middle
scroll the list of Contacts, or

00:55:30.846 --> 00:55:32.306 A:middle
freely touch on one of them to

00:55:32.306 --> 00:55:33.486 A:middle
preview it.

00:55:34.996 --> 00:55:36.846 A:middle
So, if we had to wait for the

00:55:36.846 --> 00:55:39.006 A:middle
final gesture, before we show

00:55:39.006 --> 00:55:40.676 A:middle
any feedback, we would have to

00:55:40.676 --> 00:55:41.656 A:middle
introduce a delay.

00:55:42.276 --> 00:55:43.566 A:middle
And, during that wait, the

00:55:43.566 --> 00:55:44.566 A:middle
interface wouldn't feel

00:55:44.566 --> 00:55:45.236 A:middle
responsive.

00:55:45.726 --> 00:55:48.306 A:middle
For that reason, we should

00:55:48.306 --> 00:55:49.896 A:middle
detect all possible gestures

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:50.996 A:middle
from the beginning of the

00:55:50.996 --> 00:55:51.536 A:middle
action.

00:55:52.106 --> 00:55:53.456 A:middle
And, once we are confident of

00:55:53.456 --> 00:55:55.286 A:middle
the intention, cancel all the

00:55:55.286 --> 00:55:55.976 A:middle
other gestures.

00:55:58.556 --> 00:55:59.856 A:middle
So, if we go back to our

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.756 A:middle
example, I start pressing that

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.756 A:middle
example, I start pressing that

00:56:01.756 --> 00:56:03.646 A:middle
contact, but I decide to scroll

00:56:03.646 --> 00:56:04.166 A:middle
instead.

00:56:04.836 --> 00:56:06.426 A:middle
And, it's at that moment that we

00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:08.336 A:middle
cancel the 3D touch action, and

00:56:08.336 --> 00:56:09.436 A:middle
transition into the right

00:56:09.516 --> 00:56:09.956 A:middle
gesture.

00:56:14.116 --> 00:56:15.506 A:middle
Sometimes, though, it's

00:56:15.506 --> 00:56:17.006 A:middle
inevitable to introduce delay.

00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:19.496 A:middle
For instance, every time we use

00:56:19.496 --> 00:56:21.306 A:middle
the double-tap in our UIs, all

00:56:21.306 --> 00:56:22.716 A:middle
normal taps will be delayed.

00:56:23.596 --> 00:56:25.446 A:middle
The system has to wait after the

00:56:25.446 --> 00:56:27.366 A:middle
tap, to see if it's a tap or a

00:56:27.366 --> 00:56:27.936 A:middle
double-tap.

00:56:28.476 --> 00:56:32.146 A:middle
In this example, since I can

00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:33.576 A:middle
double-tap to zoom in and out of

00:56:33.726 --> 00:56:36.336 A:middle
a photo, tapping to show the app

00:56:36.336 --> 00:56:38.176 A:middle
menu is delayed by about half a

00:56:38.176 --> 00:56:38.766 A:middle
second.

00:56:39.826 --> 00:56:41.056 A:middle
So, when designing gestures for

00:56:41.056 --> 00:56:42.676 A:middle
your applications, you should be

00:56:42.676 --> 00:56:44.256 A:middle
aware of these situations, and

00:56:44.256 --> 00:56:45.516 A:middle
try to avoid delays whenever

00:56:45.516 --> 00:56:46.046 A:middle
possible.

00:56:49.216 --> 00:56:51.406 A:middle
So, to summarize, we've seen how

00:56:51.406 --> 00:56:53.506 A:middle
to design some core gestures,

00:56:53.616 --> 00:56:54.826 A:middle
like taps and swipes.

00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:56.636 A:middle
We've seen that content and

00:56:56.636 --> 00:57:00.326 A:middle
touch should move one-to-one,

00:56:56.636 --> 00:57:00.326 A:middle
touch should move one-to-one,

00:57:00.536 --> 00:57:01.456 A:middle
and that is one of the core

00:57:01.456 --> 00:57:02.536 A:middle
concepts of iOS.

00:57:03.426 --> 00:57:04.286 A:middle
You should also provide

00:57:04.316 --> 00:57:05.836 A:middle
continuous feedback during all

00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:08.106 A:middle
interactions, and when having

00:57:08.106 --> 00:57:10.146 A:middle
multiple gestures, detect them

00:57:10.146 --> 00:57:11.866 A:middle
in parallel from the beginning.

00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:15.246 A:middle
And now, I'd like to hand it

00:57:15.246 --> 00:57:16.876 A:middle
back to Chan, who will talk

00:57:16.876 --> 00:57:18.356 A:middle
about working with fluid

00:57:18.356 --> 00:57:19.106 A:middle
interfaces.

00:57:19.456 --> 00:57:19.976 A:middle
Thanks, everyone.

00:57:20.516 --> 00:57:25.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:57:25.696 --> 00:57:26.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Nice job.

00:57:28.446 --> 00:57:29.656 A:middle
Alright, I'm back.

00:57:30.776 --> 00:57:32.046 A:middle
So, we just learned about how to

00:57:32.046 --> 00:57:33.816 A:middle
approach building interfaces

00:57:34.216 --> 00:57:35.466 A:middle
that feel as fluid, as

00:57:35.506 --> 00:57:37.636 A:middle
responsive, and as lively as we

00:57:37.636 --> 00:57:37.886 A:middle
are.

00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:39.796 A:middle
So, lets talk about some

00:57:39.796 --> 00:57:41.096 A:middle
considerations now that we're

00:57:41.096 --> 00:57:41.926 A:middle
feeling a little bit more

00:57:41.926 --> 00:57:43.036 A:middle
comfortable with this, for

00:57:43.036 --> 00:57:44.646 A:middle
working within the medium of

00:57:44.676 --> 00:57:45.586 A:middle
fluid interfaces.

00:57:46.136 --> 00:57:47.816 A:middle
And that begins with teaching.

00:57:48.706 --> 00:57:50.716 A:middle
So, one downside to a gestural

00:57:50.716 --> 00:57:52.406 A:middle
interface is that it's not

00:57:52.526 --> 00:57:54.416 A:middle
immediately obvious what the

00:57:54.416 --> 00:57:55.476 A:middle
gestures are.

00:57:55.826 --> 00:57:57.266 A:middle
So, we have to be friendly and

00:57:57.266 --> 00:57:59.376 A:middle
clever about how we bring users

00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:00.476 A:middle
along with us in a way that's

00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:00.476 A:middle
along with us in a way that's

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.336 A:middle
friendly and inviting.

00:58:02.716 --> 00:58:04.196 A:middle
And so, one way we can do that

00:58:04.196 --> 00:58:05.606 A:middle
is with visual cues.

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.136 A:middle
So, the world is filled with

00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:08.936 A:middle
these things, right?

00:58:09.726 --> 00:58:10.996 A:middle
You can learn them once, and you

00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:12.116 A:middle
can use them everywhere.

00:58:12.116 --> 00:58:12.986 A:middle
They're portable.

00:58:12.986 --> 00:58:15.226 A:middle
And so, when you see this, you

00:58:15.226 --> 00:58:16.046 A:middle
know how to use it.

00:58:17.686 --> 00:58:19.156 A:middle
So, we've tried to establish

00:58:19.156 --> 00:58:20.766 A:middle
similar conventions in iOS.

00:58:21.106 --> 00:58:22.146 A:middle
Here's a couple examples.

00:58:23.196 --> 00:58:24.396 A:middle
So, if you have a scrolling list

00:58:24.396 --> 00:58:25.726 A:middle
of content, you can clip the

00:58:25.726 --> 00:58:27.566 A:middle
content off the bottom there, to

00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:28.786 A:middle
indicate that there's more to

00:58:28.836 --> 00:58:30.596 A:middle
see, that invites me to try and

00:58:30.596 --> 00:58:31.666 A:middle
reveal what's under there.

00:58:31.706 --> 00:58:34.036 A:middle
And, if we're dealing with pages

00:58:34.036 --> 00:58:36.106 A:middle
of content, you can use a paging

00:58:36.106 --> 00:58:37.916 A:middle
indicator to indicate that

00:58:37.916 --> 00:58:39.226 A:middle
there's multiple pages of

00:58:39.226 --> 00:58:39.576 A:middle
content.

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.676 A:middle
And, for sliding panes of

00:58:41.676 --> 00:58:42.636 A:middle
content, you can use an

00:58:42.636 --> 00:58:44.166 A:middle
affordance, or a grabber handle

00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:46.646 A:middle
like this, to indicate that it's

00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:47.776 A:middle
grabbable and slidable.

00:58:49.326 --> 00:58:50.926 A:middle
Another technique you can use is

00:58:50.926 --> 00:58:53.146 A:middle
to elevate interactive elements

00:58:53.146 --> 00:58:54.136 A:middle
to a separate plane.

00:58:54.566 --> 00:58:55.946 A:middle
So, if you have an interactive

00:58:55.946 --> 00:58:57.576 A:middle
element, lifting it up to a

00:58:57.626 --> 00:58:58.676 A:middle
separate plane can help

00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:00.286 A:middle
distinguish it from the content.

00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:00.286 A:middle
distinguish it from the content.

00:59:01.586 --> 00:59:03.006 A:middle
So, a good example of this is

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.056 A:middle
our on/off switch.

00:59:04.496 --> 00:59:05.696 A:middle
We want to indicate that the

00:59:05.696 --> 00:59:07.136 A:middle
knob of the switch is grabbable,

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:08.996 A:middle
so we elevate it to another

00:59:09.076 --> 00:59:09.396 A:middle
plane.

00:59:10.036 --> 00:59:11.656 A:middle
This helps visually separate it,

00:59:11.816 --> 00:59:13.316 A:middle
and indicate its draggable

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:13.776 A:middle
nature.

00:59:14.696 --> 00:59:16.096 A:middle
So, floating elements,

00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:17.716 A:middle
interactive elements like this,

00:59:17.716 --> 00:59:19.406 A:middle
above the interface can help

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:20.816 A:middle
indicate that they're grabbable.

00:59:21.506 --> 00:59:26.136 A:middle
Next, we can use behavior, you

00:59:26.136 --> 00:59:28.156 A:middle
know, to show rather than tell

00:59:28.516 --> 00:59:29.656 A:middle
to use-- how to use an

00:59:29.656 --> 00:59:30.136 A:middle
interface.

00:59:30.426 --> 00:59:32.356 A:middle
So, we can reinforce a dynamic

00:59:32.396 --> 00:59:33.526 A:middle
behavior with a static

00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.106 A:middle
animation.

00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:35.976 A:middle
So, an example of this is

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:36.446 A:middle
Safari.

00:59:37.076 --> 00:59:39.166 A:middle
In Safari, we have this x icon

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.456 A:middle
at the top left to close the

00:59:40.456 --> 00:59:41.816 A:middle
tab, and when you hit that

00:59:41.866 --> 00:59:43.646 A:middle
button, we slide the tab left to

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:44.766 A:middle
indicate it's deleted.

00:59:45.596 --> 00:59:46.846 A:middle
This hints to me that I can

00:59:46.846 --> 00:59:48.576 A:middle
slide it myself to the left.

00:59:48.676 --> 00:59:50.536 A:middle
And, accomplish the same action

00:59:50.536 --> 00:59:52.116 A:middle
of deleting the tab through a

00:59:52.116 --> 00:59:52.586 A:middle
gesture.

00:59:53.436 --> 00:59:54.886 A:middle
So, by keeping the discrete

00:59:55.046 --> 00:59:56.246 A:middle
animation and the gesture

00:59:56.246 --> 00:59:58.786 A:middle
aligned, we can use one to teach

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.246 A:middle
the other.

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.246 A:middle
the other.

01:00:02.296 --> 01:00:03.196 A:middle
And, there's another technique

01:00:03.196 --> 01:00:04.166 A:middle
we can use, which is

01:00:04.566 --> 01:00:05.306 A:middle
explanations.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:07.196 A:middle
This is when you explicitly tell

01:00:07.196 --> 01:00:08.576 A:middle
users how to use a gesture.

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:10.796 A:middle
So, this is best when used

01:00:10.796 --> 01:00:12.456 A:middle
sparingly, but it's best when

01:00:12.456 --> 01:00:14.196 A:middle
you have one gesture that's used

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:15.766 A:middle
repeatedly in a bunch of places,

01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:18.216 A:middle
and you explain it once up

01:00:18.216 --> 01:00:19.246 A:middle
front, and then you just keep

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.966 A:middle
using it, and keep reinforcing

01:00:20.966 --> 01:00:21.036 A:middle
it.

01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:23.136 A:middle
Don't use it for a gesture

01:00:23.136 --> 01:00:24.836 A:middle
that's used only intermittently.

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:25.976 A:middle
People won't remember that.

01:00:26.946 --> 01:00:29.706 A:middle
Now, I want to talk a little bit

01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:31.786 A:middle
about fun and playfulness.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:33.606 A:middle
Because this is one of the most

01:00:33.606 --> 01:00:35.346 A:middle
important aspects of a fluid

01:00:35.346 --> 01:00:35.976 A:middle
interface.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.906 A:middle
And, it only happens when you

01:00:37.906 --> 01:00:39.076 A:middle
nail everything.

01:00:40.326 --> 01:00:42.196 A:middle
It's a natural consequence of a

01:00:42.196 --> 01:00:43.136 A:middle
fluid interface.

01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:44.056 A:middle
It's when the interface is

01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:45.656 A:middle
responding instantly and

01:00:45.656 --> 01:00:46.186 A:middle
satisfyingly.

01:00:46.506 --> 01:00:47.686 A:middle
When it's redirectable and

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.216 A:middle
forgiving.

01:00:48.676 --> 01:00:49.956 A:middle
When the motion and gestures are

01:00:49.956 --> 01:00:50.496 A:middle
smooth.

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:51.556 A:middle
And, everything we just talked

01:00:51.556 --> 01:00:51.816 A:middle
about.

01:00:52.426 --> 01:00:53.836 A:middle
The interface starts to feel in

01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:54.546 A:middle
sync with you.

01:00:55.336 --> 01:00:57.486 A:middle
And, something magical happens

01:00:57.486 --> 01:00:58.996 A:middle
where you don't feel like you

01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:00.446 A:middle
need to learn the interface, you

01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:00.446 A:middle
need to learn the interface, you

01:01:00.546 --> 01:01:01.836 A:middle
feel like you're discovering the

01:01:01.836 --> 01:01:02.326 A:middle
interface.

01:01:03.806 --> 01:01:06.016 A:middle
And so, we think it's great when

01:01:06.016 --> 01:01:08.026 A:middle
we allow people to discover the

01:01:08.026 --> 01:01:09.026 A:middle
interface through play.

01:01:09.026 --> 01:01:10.076 A:middle
And, it doesn't even feel like

01:01:10.076 --> 01:01:11.216 A:middle
they're learning it, it feels

01:01:11.216 --> 01:01:11.626 A:middle
fun.

01:01:12.876 --> 01:01:15.436 A:middle
So, people love playing with

01:01:15.436 --> 01:01:15.836 A:middle
stuff.

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.176 A:middle
So, we think it's great to play

01:01:18.176 --> 01:01:19.936 A:middle
into our natural fiddle factor.

01:01:20.696 --> 01:01:22.486 A:middle
You know, play is our mind's

01:01:22.486 --> 01:01:24.146 A:middle
internalizing the feel of an

01:01:24.146 --> 01:01:24.646 A:middle
interface.

01:01:25.356 --> 01:01:26.306 A:middle
So, it's great when we're

01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:27.256 A:middle
building this stuff, when we're

01:01:27.256 --> 01:01:29.066 A:middle
prototyping it, just to build

01:01:29.066 --> 01:01:29.646 A:middle
it.

01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:30.736 A:middle
You know, play with it yourself.

01:01:30.796 --> 01:01:32.176 A:middle
See how you fiddle with it.

01:01:32.266 --> 01:01:33.426 A:middle
Hand it to others see how they

01:01:33.426 --> 01:01:33.976 A:middle
play with it.

01:01:34.376 --> 01:01:35.486 A:middle
And, think about how you can

01:01:35.486 --> 01:01:37.536 A:middle
reinforce that with something

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:39.106 A:middle
like an animation, or behavior,

01:01:39.106 --> 01:01:39.926 A:middle
an explanation.

01:01:41.336 --> 01:01:43.006 A:middle
And, it's surprising how far

01:01:43.126 --> 01:01:45.076 A:middle
play can go, and having

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.726 A:middle
interface teach itself to

01:01:46.726 --> 01:01:47.056 A:middle
people.

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:51.486 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

01:01:51.486 --> 01:01:52.696 A:middle
fluidity as a medium.

01:01:53.216 --> 01:01:54.146 A:middle
How we actually go about

01:01:54.206 --> 01:01:55.056 A:middle
building this stuff.

01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:56.716 A:middle
You know, we think interfaces

01:01:56.716 --> 01:01:58.426 A:middle
like this are a unique medium,

01:01:58.426 --> 01:01:59.426 A:middle
and it's important that we

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:00.606 A:middle
approach it right.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:00.606 A:middle
approach it right.

01:02:02.376 --> 01:02:04.296 A:middle
So, the first thing is to design

01:02:04.296 --> 01:02:05.356 A:middle
the interactions to be

01:02:05.396 --> 01:02:07.036 A:middle
inseparable from the visuals,

01:02:07.616 --> 01:02:08.936 A:middle
not an afterthought.

01:02:09.566 --> 01:02:11.506 A:middle
The interaction design should be

01:02:11.506 --> 01:02:12.776 A:middle
done in concert with the

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:13.196 A:middle
visuals.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.166 A:middle
You shouldn't be able to even

01:02:14.306 --> 01:02:15.776 A:middle
tell when one ends and another

01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:16.226 A:middle
begins.

01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:18.526 A:middle
And, it's really important that

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:19.926 A:middle
we build demos of this stuff.

01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:21.326 A:middle
The interactive demo we think is

01:02:21.326 --> 01:02:23.006 A:middle
really worth a million static

01:02:23.046 --> 01:02:23.476 A:middle
designs.

01:02:23.926 --> 01:02:25.766 A:middle
Not just to show other people,

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.806 A:middle
but to also understand the true

01:02:27.806 --> 01:02:29.016 A:middle
nature of the interface

01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:29.606 A:middle
yourself.

01:02:30.996 --> 01:02:33.646 A:middle
And, when you prototype this

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:35.806 A:middle
stuff, it's so valuable for you

01:02:35.806 --> 01:02:36.846 A:middle
because you get to almost

01:02:36.846 --> 01:02:38.466 A:middle
discover the interface as you're

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:38.886 A:middle
building it.

01:02:39.696 --> 01:02:40.436 A:middle
You know, this technique is

01:02:40.436 --> 01:02:41.796 A:middle
actually how we built the iPhone

01:02:41.886 --> 01:02:42.566 A:middle
10 interface.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:45.016 A:middle
And, it's really important

01:02:45.016 --> 01:02:46.636 A:middle
because it also sets a goal for

01:02:46.636 --> 01:02:47.406 A:middle
the implementation.

01:02:47.826 --> 01:02:49.416 A:middle
We're so lucky here at Apple

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:50.596 A:middle
that we have this amazing

01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:52.056 A:middle
engineering team to build this

01:02:52.056 --> 01:02:53.386 A:middle
stuff, because it's really hard

01:02:53.386 --> 01:02:53.826 A:middle
to build.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:56.866 A:middle
And, it's so important also to

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.126 A:middle
have that kind of magical

01:02:58.126 --> 01:02:59.706 A:middle
example that reminds yourself

01:02:59.706 --> 01:03:01.446 A:middle
and the engineering teams, and

01:02:59.706 --> 01:03:01.446 A:middle
and the engineering teams, and

01:03:01.586 --> 01:03:05.066 A:middle
yourselves that what it can feel

01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:05.746 A:middle
like, you know?

01:03:05.746 --> 01:03:08.276 A:middle
And, it's really important to,

01:03:08.486 --> 01:03:09.806 A:middle
kind of, remember, remind

01:03:09.806 --> 01:03:10.476 A:middle
yourself of that.

01:03:11.896 --> 01:03:15.086 A:middle
And, it makes-- when you

01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:16.426 A:middle
actually build it, it makes

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:17.626 A:middle
something that's hard to copy,

01:03:17.896 --> 01:03:19.386 A:middle
and it gives your app a unique

01:03:19.426 --> 01:03:19.936 A:middle
character.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:27.286 A:middle
So, you know, multitouch is such

01:03:27.286 --> 01:03:28.726 A:middle
an amazing medium we all get to

01:03:28.726 --> 01:03:29.156 A:middle
play in.

01:03:30.196 --> 01:03:31.446 A:middle
We get to use technology to

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:32.596 A:middle
interface with people at an

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.106 A:middle
ancient, tactile level.

01:03:34.756 --> 01:03:36.126 A:middle
It's actually really cool.

01:03:38.206 --> 01:03:40.066 A:middle
You know, all those principles

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.226 A:middle
we talked about today, they're

01:03:42.226 --> 01:03:43.616 A:middle
at the core of the design of the

01:03:43.746 --> 01:03:45.646 A:middle
iPhone 10 gestural interface,

01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:47.526 A:middle
you know, responsive,

01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:48.976 A:middle
redirectable, interruptible

01:03:48.976 --> 01:03:50.926 A:middle
gestures, dynamic motion,

01:03:51.306 --> 01:03:52.876 A:middle
elegant gesture handling.

01:03:53.636 --> 01:03:55.056 A:middle
In a lot of ways, it's kind of

01:03:55.056 --> 01:03:56.486 A:middle
the embodiment of what we think

01:03:56.486 --> 01:03:57.646 A:middle
a fluid interface could be.

01:03:58.996 --> 01:04:01.246 A:middle
When we align the interface to

01:03:58.996 --> 01:04:01.246 A:middle
When we align the interface to

01:04:01.246 --> 01:04:02.586 A:middle
the way we think and move,

01:04:03.376 --> 01:04:04.756 A:middle
something kind of magical

01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:05.166 A:middle
happens.

01:04:05.986 --> 01:04:07.796 A:middle
It really stops feeling like a

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:09.906 A:middle
computer, and starts feeling

01:04:09.906 --> 01:04:11.596 A:middle
like a seamless extension of us.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.206 A:middle
You know, as we design the

01:04:16.276 --> 01:04:18.336 A:middle
future of interfaces, we think

01:04:18.336 --> 01:04:19.776 A:middle
it's really important to try and

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.716 A:middle
capture our humanity in the

01:04:21.716 --> 01:04:22.626 A:middle
technology like this.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:24.416 A:middle
So, that one of the most

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:26.596 A:middle
important tools of humankind is

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.966 A:middle
not a burden, but a pleasure and

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.086 A:middle
a delight to use.

01:04:30.966 --> 01:04:31.956 A:middle
Thank you very much.

01:04:32.516 --> 01:04:36.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
