&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is
Lauren Strehlow,

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:39.026 A:middle
and I'm User Experience
Evangelist at Apple.

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:43.386 A:middle
I work directly with developers
to improve the user experience

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.216 A:middle
of their apps on Apple TV.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.436 A:middle
And I'm here today to talk to
you about Designing for tvOS.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.786 A:middle
This is a really exciting time

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:57.066 A:middle
because this is the
Apple TV's first WWDC.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:00:59.686 A:middle
Yeah. Right.

[ Applause ]

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.376 A:middle
And your Apple TV apps
have already started

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:07.736 A:middle
to change the way
we think of TV.

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:12.106 A:middle
And Apple TV App Store
is only 9 months old.

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:16.356 A:middle
And this newness provides
an incredible opportunity

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:18.386 A:middle
for your apps.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.576 A:middle
So, today we will
talk about tvOS,

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:25.996 A:middle
because this is a unique
platform that has its own set

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.296 A:middle
of design considerations.

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:29.996 A:middle
But, before we dive
into all of that,

00:01:30.726 --> 00:01:34.816 A:middle
we need to first take a
step back and talk about TV.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.806 A:middle
This is TV.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.646 A:middle
And we love TV.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:46.086 A:middle
We love TV because it's
a way to be entertained.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:51.766 A:middle
It's a way to learn, to
play, and to connect.

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:52.956 A:middle
TV's are powerful.

00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:56.436 A:middle
And the TV is something that
multiple people can experience

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:59.746 A:middle
at the same time, which
makes the experience

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:04.356 A:middle
at Apple TV unique from the rest
of our devices, because most


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:04.356 A:middle
at Apple TV unique from the rest
of our devices, because most

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.926 A:middle
of our devices are close.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.506 A:middle
Their personal because
they're in our hands

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.526 A:middle
and we interact with
them directly.

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:15.086 A:middle
But, the TV is not in
your hands, a remote is.

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.906 A:middle
And that screen is
far away from you.

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:21.816 A:middle
So, if you want to make
an awesome Apple TV app,

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:24.386 A:middle
you must first acknowledge
that distance

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.406 A:middle
between you and the screen.

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:30.426 A:middle
And you have to understand
that when you interact

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.836 A:middle
with that screen that's far
away from you it's indirect,

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.836 A:middle
because of that distance.

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.886 A:middle
So, this makes the
Apple TV different

00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:39.456 A:middle
from the rest of our devices.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:43.196 A:middle
So, you have to design
differently for the TV.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:48.976 A:middle
So, today talking about
designing for tvOS,

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:51.166 A:middle
we will first go
over some basics.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.336 A:middle
And that way we will
all be on the same page.

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.236 A:middle
And then we'll jump into
the fundamental differences

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:56.996 A:middle
of the TV.

00:02:57.316 --> 00:02:59.746 A:middle
And how to design
your app for distance.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.636 A:middle
And how to design your app
to work well with the remote.

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:07.006 A:middle
We're going to touch on some
great new features in tvOS,

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.556 A:middle
and those will be the ones
that impact your designs.

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.496 A:middle
And I also want to
share a few apps

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:15.406 A:middle
that have designed
differently for the Apple TV.

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.176 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and
start with some basics.

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:25.906 A:middle
If you're coming over from
iOS, note that on Apple TV,

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.156 A:middle
app layouts don't
automatically adjust

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:29.526 A:middle
to the size of the screen.

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:33.136 A:middle
Your interface is going to
be the same size regardless

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:34.756 A:middle
of the TV screen size.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:39.436 A:middle
So, you need to design with
a screen resolution of 1920

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:45.056 A:middle
by 1080 pixels, which implies a
16:9 wide screen aspect ratio.

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:49.546 A:middle
And all of your assets
will be at a 1x resolution.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.446 A:middle
And there's something
else to keep in mind,

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.096 A:middle
over scanning can
occur on older TV's.

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:57.786 A:middle
And this could cause
unintentional cropping.

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
So, keep your apps
main content away


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
So, keep your apps
main content away

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:02.076 A:middle
from the edges of the screen.

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:06.596 A:middle
And a good guide is to avoid 60
pixels from the top and bottom,

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:08.696 A:middle
and 90 pixels from each side.

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:12.316 A:middle
So, that's it.

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:13.346 A:middle
Those are the basics.

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:17.196 A:middle
So, now we can talk about
the first key factor

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:20.875 A:middle
that makes the TV unique and
how it impacts your designs.

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:24.026 A:middle
And that is our distance
from the screen.

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:30.356 A:middle
So, on average we are 10
feet away from the TV screen.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:34.496 A:middle
And that's significant,
because you need to be aware

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:36.746 A:middle
of that distance when you're
considering your apps layout.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:41.236 A:middle
So, keep in mind that
larger items are much easier

00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:42.336 A:middle
to see from far away.

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:46.216 A:middle
Everything in your user
interface should be larger.

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:48.946 A:middle
And that's starting
with graphics.

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:52.626 A:middle
Both graphics and your user
interface elements such as,

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.286 A:middle
buttons or controls
need to be larger

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:57.426 A:middle
so they can be easily
seen from across the room.

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.426 A:middle
Now, I know it may
feel unnatural


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.426 A:middle
Now, I know it may
feel unnatural

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:03.406 A:middle
if you're used to
designing for iOS.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.606 A:middle
But, on Apple TV you want
to make sure that nobody has

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
to struggle to see
what's on screen.

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:13.796 A:middle
So, larger items are simply
easier to see from a distance.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
In addition to increasing your
graphic size, it's important

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.866 A:middle
to include plenty of spacing

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.456 A:middle
between those elements
on screen.

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:25.756 A:middle
This will help people
see each individual item.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.646 A:middle
And it makes them easier
to navigate and select.

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:34.336 A:middle
Now, grid layouts tend to work
really well on the Apple TV.

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:37.716 A:middle
And if you use a grid
layout note that if all

00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:41.926 A:middle
of your content doesn't fit onto
a single screen, you can elude

00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:43.206 A:middle
to those off-screen items.

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:45.876 A:middle
This will let people know
they can navigate there.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:50.036 A:middle
And only those partially
off-screen items should appear

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:51.066 A:middle
in this zone.

00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:56.566 A:middle
So, for Apple TV, if you want
a jump start on your designs,

00:05:56.876 --> 00:05:58.186 A:middle
there's some templates
available,

00:05:58.186 --> 00:05:59.986 A:middle
and they're all highly
customizable.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:03.676 A:middle
You have control over
the layout, size,

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.776 A:middle
background, tinting, and more.

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:10.136 A:middle
You can find these on the
tvOS Interface Guidelines.

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:12.856 A:middle
And I'll include a link to them
at the end of this talk today.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:17.096 A:middle
So, now let's talk about text.

00:06:18.046 --> 00:06:22.226 A:middle
Let's just imagine we're
in a really big room

00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:24.936 A:middle
and we're sitting away
from a big screen.

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:26.586 A:middle
All right.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.706 A:middle
So, let's just toss some
text up on that screen.

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:32.366 A:middle
And can anybody see this?

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:35.166 A:middle
Well? Somewhat.

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:37.606 A:middle
Okay. People in the
front, I know you can.

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.776 A:middle
But, people in the back, it
might be a little bit harder.

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:41.596 A:middle
So, what's my point?

00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:45.486 A:middle
Make your text much
larger on the TV.

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:48.856 A:middle
This will insure your
titles, buttons, labels,

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:50.886 A:middle
and descriptions
will all be legible.

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:54.216 A:middle
But, increasing the point
size isn't the only thing

00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:56.216 A:middle
that you can do for
text on screen.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:00.706 A:middle
You can also use a heavier font
weight to increase legibility.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:00.706 A:middle
You can also use a heavier font
weight to increase legibility.

00:07:01.896 --> 00:07:05.716 A:middle
This weight is significantly
easier to see than this one.

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:11.406 A:middle
So, when you're evaluating a
font for your Apple TV app,

00:07:11.406 --> 00:07:14.956 A:middle
font's with weights like
regular, medium, semi-bold,

00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:17.076 A:middle
and bold are all great options.

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:21.366 A:middle
And you typically want to avoid
fonts that are light or thin.

00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:24.766 A:middle
So, if you have a brand
font that is thin,

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.806 A:middle
I highly recommend
prioritizing legibility.

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:30.856 A:middle
And then see where you can
integrate a heavier font weight.

00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:34.086 A:middle
Even if it's just up to
regular, because it will be

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.106 A:middle
so much easier to see on the TV.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.666 A:middle
And I know that beautiful,
thin font weight is a part

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:41.806 A:middle
of your brand identity.

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:45.536 A:middle
But, if people can't read
the text in your app,

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:47.246 A:middle
it's going to be a
poor user experience.

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:49.486 A:middle
And that's going to reflect
poorly on your brand.

00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
So, in the system, we
use this great font

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.506 A:middle
and it's called San Francisco.

00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:57.926 A:middle
There are two variants
of this font.

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:01.826 A:middle
Both of which were designed for
high legibility on a big screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:01.826 A:middle
Both of which were designed for
high legibility on a big screen.

00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:05.726 A:middle
There's San Francisco text
and San Francisco display.

00:08:06.676 --> 00:08:08.576 A:middle
So, let's take a look
at them in the system.

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:12.596 A:middle
This is San Francisco
on Apple TV.

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:15.996 A:middle
And when you use San
Francisco in your apps,

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:19.236 A:middle
tvOS automatically applies the
most appropriate text style

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:20.386 A:middle
based on point size.

00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:23.306 A:middle
And it's going to respect
accessibility settings

00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.466 A:middle
such as bold type.

00:08:26.036 --> 00:08:29.026 A:middle
San Francisco will work
great in most apps.

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:31.596 A:middle
But, if you need to
use a custom font,

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:35.285 A:middle
make sure that it respects
accessibility settings,

00:08:35.696 --> 00:08:37.556 A:middle
and it's legible
from a distance.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:44.145 A:middle
So, for example, in Badland they
use a custom font that fits well

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:45.856 A:middle
within the style of the game.

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:48.556 A:middle
It reads clearly across the room

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:49.946 A:middle
because of its heavier
font weight.

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:53.086 A:middle
So, unless your app
has a compelling reason

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:55.876 A:middle
for a custom font, stick
with San Francisco,

00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:59.916 A:middle
because above all text on
screen must be legible.

So, I've only touched
on a few pieces of what

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:06.846 A:middle
to consider with text on screen.

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:11.066 A:middle
If you want to learn more about
type, I recommend checking

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.736 A:middle
out the Typography and Font
talk happening tomorrow morning

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:16.036 A:middle
on this stage with
my friend, Antonio.

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:21.326 A:middle
So, we've already
covered layout, graphics,

00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:23.866 A:middle
spacing, templates, and text.

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:26.226 A:middle
All to accommodate
for the distance

00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:28.496 A:middle
between us and the TV screen.

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:31.676 A:middle
But, there's still one
more thing to consider.

00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:34.086 A:middle
And that is your apps hierarchy.

00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:37.986 A:middle
Keep your app approachable
on Apple TV.

00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:41.326 A:middle
Do you remember how you
could just turn on TV

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:43.496 A:middle
and just instantly be
watching your favorite show?

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:48.016 A:middle
Well, that ease and instant
access should still hold true

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:49.886 A:middle
to your apps on the
Apple TV today.

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:54.476 A:middle
So, in designing your apps
hierarchy, keep it simple.

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:58.316 A:middle
Let people jump immediately
into your apps experience.

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
Too many choices or options
can easily overwhelm,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
Too many choices or options
can easily overwhelm,

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:05.486 A:middle
which will add a psychological
distance in addition

00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:07.506 A:middle
to the physical distance
from the TV screen.

00:10:08.826 --> 00:10:10.236 A:middle
So, if you have a
lot of content,

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:13.946 A:middle
a great way to simplify your
app is to use a tab bar.

00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:17.356 A:middle
This will instantly
flatten your apps hierarchy

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:20.426 A:middle
and it'll organize all of your
content into different sections

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:22.786 A:middle
that are quick and
easy to access.

00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:27.106 A:middle
Each tab bar should provide
value and easy navigation

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:29.706 A:middle
from the top level of your app.

00:10:29.706 --> 00:10:32.276 A:middle
And if you use a tab
bar all tabs should fit

00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:33.096 A:middle
on the screen at once.

00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:36.496 A:middle
And don't just use it as
your apps junk drawer.

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.036 A:middle
If you need to declutter
your app,

00:10:40.036 --> 00:10:43.196 A:middle
I recommend placing your app
settings in system settings.

00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:46.876 A:middle
People tend to only go
to settings once and so

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:49.556 A:middle
that you don't need to waste
space for it in your tab bar

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:52.086 A:middle
or in the main level
of your app.

00:10:53.516 --> 00:10:57.066 A:middle
So, to recap, when
designing for Apple TV,

00:10:57.526 --> 00:11:00.046 A:middle
remember on average
there's a 10 foot distance


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.526 --> 00:11:00.046 A:middle
remember on average
there's a 10 foot distance

00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:01.486 A:middle
between you and the screen.

00:11:02.386 --> 00:11:04.236 A:middle
And to accommodate
for that distance,

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:07.346 A:middle
you want to use larger
graphics and interface elements.

00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:11.326 A:middle
You want to provide adequate
spacing between those elements

00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:15.066 A:middle
so they're easier to see,
navigate, and select.

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:19.316 A:middle
With text, legibility
is essential.

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:22.766 A:middle
Use large point sizes
and heavier font weights.

00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:26.556 A:middle
So, don't be afraid to go big
and bold with your text on TV.

00:11:27.096 --> 00:11:31.076 A:middle
And remember to keep
your app approachable

00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:32.726 A:middle
with a very simple hierarchy.

00:11:33.496 --> 00:11:36.926 A:middle
Don't add to the distance with
an overly complicated app.

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.746 A:middle
And there's actually
a really easy way

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:42.366 A:middle
to check your designs
before jumping into Xcode.

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:46.716 A:middle
And that is to toss your wire
frames or concept with AirPlay

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:49.946 A:middle
and review your layout,
spacing, graphics,

00:11:50.016 --> 00:11:52.846 A:middle
and text on an actual
TV across the room.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.826 A:middle
And you can ask yourself,

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:57.766 A:middle
can you see everything
clearly from 10 feet away?

00:11:57.766 --> 00:12:01.576 A:middle
And is it easy to jump
into your apps experience.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.766 --> 00:12:01.576 A:middle
And is it easy to jump
into your apps experience.

00:12:03.036 --> 00:12:05.646 A:middle
I know this may seem like
a really obvious point,

00:12:05.806 --> 00:12:08.756 A:middle
but I've been in many UI
reviews were the majority

00:12:08.756 --> 00:12:10.006 A:middle
of issues could have been caught

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:12.376 A:middle
if the app had simply
been checked

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:15.906 A:middle
on an actual TV across the room.

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:19.956 A:middle
I've seen some really great
seasoned iOS developers get

00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:21.996 A:middle
tripped up on designing
for the Apple TV,

00:12:22.106 --> 00:12:24.506 A:middle
because they have not
designed with distance in mind.

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:29.276 A:middle
If you don't have a TV to
review your app on, get one.

00:12:29.356 --> 00:12:33.366 A:middle
And don't just, yeah, and
don't just place it next

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:34.326 A:middle
to you at your desk.

00:12:35.096 --> 00:12:38.696 A:middle
You need to place it across
the room, because if you do all

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:42.296 A:middle
of that, people will be able to
see clearly what's on screen.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:45.156 A:middle
And they will love being
able to jump immediately

00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:46.436 A:middle
into your apps experience.

00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:50.736 A:middle
So, that's designing
for distance on tvOS.

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:55.636 A:middle
And because of that distance,
we interact with the TV

00:12:55.636 --> 00:12:59.426 A:middle
with the remote, which is the
second key factor that you need

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:02.226 A:middle
to consider when
designing for tvOS.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:02.226 A:middle
to consider when
designing for tvOS.

00:13:03.776 --> 00:13:07.876 A:middle
So, as I mentioned, the rest
of our devices, where you look

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:09.976 A:middle
and where you interact
is the same.

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:13.316 A:middle
However, on the Apple
TV, where you look

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:15.096 A:middle
and where you interact
is separate.

00:13:16.556 --> 00:13:18.776 A:middle
The Siri Remote allows
us to connect

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.176 A:middle
with the TV screen
that's far away from us.

00:13:22.596 --> 00:13:25.416 A:middle
And people want to be
immersed with what's on screen.

00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:29.056 A:middle
They expect interacting
to be easy and intuitive.

00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:33.136 A:middle
So, if they have to look down
at the remote and guess how

00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:37.566 A:middle
to go back, the connection with
your app on screen is broken.

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:40.236 A:middle
So, to avoid breaking

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.826 A:middle
that connection you
should implement your app

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
to work seamlessly
with the Siri Remote.

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:48.836 A:middle
And to do that, you need to
know how the Siri Remote works.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:52.706 A:middle
First, there's a touch surface

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.076 A:middle
on the Siri Remote
where you can swipe.

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:58.466 A:middle
And that's going to move focus
up, down, left, and right.

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:01.176 A:middle
And that's typically used
for scrolling on screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:01.176 A:middle
And that's typically used
for scrolling on screen.

00:14:02.506 --> 00:14:04.736 A:middle
You can also click
on the touch surface

00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:07.096 A:middle
and that activates a
control or selects an item.

00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:09.716 A:middle
You can also click
and hold if you want

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:11.036 A:middle
to enter into an edit state.

00:14:11.376 --> 00:14:14.506 A:middle
And this could also be great
in a game if you want to select

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:16.866 A:middle
and drag an item
around on screen.

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:21.236 A:middle
And finally you can
tap, which navigates

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.116 A:middle
through a collection one by one.

00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:26.156 A:middle
But, it's also a really
easy gesture to repeat.

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:30.306 A:middle
So, it could be great in a game
if a quick response is needed

00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:34.936 A:middle
as long as that action is
different from a click.

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:36.456 A:middle
So, moving on to the buttons.

00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:37.876 A:middle
You have the menu button.

00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:40.536 A:middle
And pressing this should return
you to the previous screen.

00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:44.226 A:middle
There's Play/Pause,
which should do exactly

00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:45.406 A:middle
that during media playback.

00:14:45.896 --> 00:14:48.306 A:middle
And it's also a great
secondary trigger in games.

00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:52.786 A:middle
And also remember that you
can leverage the remotes

00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:56.386 A:middle
accelerometer, gyroscope,
and use it in landscape mode.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.226 A:middle
Siri, home, and the volume
buttons are all reserved


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.226 A:middle
Siri, home, and the volume
buttons are all reserved

00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:01.876 A:middle
for the system.

00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:06.866 A:middle
But, I want to go back
and give menu a little bit

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:12.606 A:middle
of special attention, and give
you some detail on how it works.

00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:14.566 A:middle
So, here's your app hierarchy.

00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:17.906 A:middle
If you click, that's
going to take you deeper

00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:19.996 A:middle
into each level of your app.

00:15:19.996 --> 00:15:23.146 A:middle
And pressing menu will return
you to the previous screen.

00:15:24.026 --> 00:15:28.346 A:middle
This is the correct and expected
behavior of menu in most apps.

00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:32.556 A:middle
However, only in
games on a pause menu,

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:34.166 A:middle
there's a slight variation,

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.006 A:middle
and I'll like to
show that to you now.

00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:39.946 A:middle
So, for example in the
game, Rayman Adventures,

00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:43.106 A:middle
if I press menu while
playing the game,

00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:45.126 A:middle
I'm presented with a pause menu.

00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:49.586 A:middle
And because we're used to
pressing the same button

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:51.546 A:middle
to bring us out of
a pause state,

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:54.236 A:middle
pressing menu here
would resume the game.

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:57.776 A:middle
So, it's important to
include a place on this menu

00:15:57.776 --> 00:15:58.886 A:middle
to exit out of the game.

00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:01.606 A:middle
So, in this case
it's the map icon.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:01.606 A:middle
So, in this case
it's the map icon.

00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:04.596 A:middle
And if I navigate to
that, that will take me

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.186 A:middle
to the level selection screen.

00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:09.606 A:middle
And this is where menu
resumes its expected behavior.

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:13.536 A:middle
If you press menu, it brings you
back to the game start screen.

00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:15.816 A:middle
And with one more
press you're back

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:17.066 A:middle
on the Apple TV home screen.

00:16:17.616 --> 00:16:21.366 A:middle
So, that's how the
Siri Remote works.

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:25.006 A:middle
And it should behave exactly
like that in your app or game.

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:30.766 A:middle
So, as you may have heard in a
keynote, there is a fantastic,

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:34.476 A:middle
new remote app that works
just like a Siri Remote.

00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:37.486 A:middle
It has a great game
controller layout.

00:16:38.636 --> 00:16:40.296 A:middle
And speaking of game
controllers,

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.486 A:middle
if your game has an
advanced input mechanic

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:46.756 A:middle
that can't be supported
by the Siri Remote,

00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:49.736 A:middle
you can now require the
use of the game controller.

00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:53.006 A:middle
And if your game
is controller only,

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:55.306 A:middle
or if you support game
controllers in addition

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:59.496 A:middle
to the Siri Remote, make sure
that your app allows people

00:16:59.496 --> 00:17:03.396 A:middle
to navigate through the Apple TV
UI in addition to play the game.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.496 --> 00:17:03.396 A:middle
to navigate through the Apple TV
UI in addition to play the game.

00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:07.006 A:middle
And you should always
gracefully inform people

00:17:07.006 --> 00:17:10.445 A:middle
if a controller is required,
or if one is not connected,

00:17:11.566 --> 00:17:16.205 A:middle
because your app can be
launched at any time.

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:19.036 A:middle
And even though your game may
be enhanced with a controller,

00:17:19.036 --> 00:17:21.636 A:middle
remember that the
Siri Remote comes

00:17:21.636 --> 00:17:23.226 A:middle
with every single Apple TV.

00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:25.846 A:middle
And a controller is
an optional purchase.

00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:30.016 A:middle
So, if you go controller
only, you could be missing

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.616 A:middle
out on new players who want

00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:34.796 A:middle
to try your game first before
purchasing a controller.

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:40.406 A:middle
So, remember, with Apple TV,
people's eyes are onscreen

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:42.886 A:middle
and they don't want to look
down, or think about how

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:44.346 A:middle
to navigate, or interact.

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:48.616 A:middle
So, use intuitive gestures
and expected button behaviors.

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:52.016 A:middle
And if your app works
seamlessly with the Siri Remote,

00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:54.786 A:middle
new remote app, and
game controllers,

00:17:55.326 --> 00:17:57.746 A:middle
people will stay connect
to your apps experience.

00:17:59.256 --> 00:18:02.516 A:middle
So, what do all of these
devices control on screen?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.256 --> 00:18:02.516 A:middle
So, what do all of these
devices control on screen?

00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:05.286 A:middle
They control focus.

00:18:06.366 --> 00:18:10.076 A:middle
And focus needs to be obvious so
people know what is actionable.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:14.936 A:middle
So, on Apple TV,
focus is identified

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:18.336 A:middle
when an object is elevated,
and it responds with parallax

00:18:18.386 --> 00:18:21.406 A:middle
to subtle movements on the touch
surface of the Siri Remote.

00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:24.906 A:middle
Did you all notice how your
eyes were immediately drawn

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:25.676 A:middle
to that movement?

00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:28.166 A:middle
Well, that's exactly
what you want.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.926 A:middle
And that's why the system
focus model is so great.

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:37.856 A:middle
People expect to be able to
tap, and also swipe to be able

00:18:37.856 --> 00:18:39.526 A:middle
to navigate around onscreen.

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:41.396 A:middle
And they should always
know where they are

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:42.766 A:middle
and what's actionable.

00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:46.316 A:middle
So, now watch closely.

00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:49.496 A:middle
This will be a very slow
and controlled swipe

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
to illustrate something unique
about the system focus model.

00:18:53.756 --> 00:18:56.796 A:middle
Notice how it gently indicates

00:18:56.856 --> 00:18:59.216 A:middle
which direction you're
navigating onscreen.

00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:02.046 A:middle
And this helps aid
in navigation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:02.046 A:middle
And this helps aid
in navigation.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.386 A:middle
This focus model is used
throughout the system.

00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:08.286 A:middle
And this consistent look

00:19:08.286 --> 00:19:10.936 A:middle
and feel helps maintain
the connection that we have

00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:12.276 A:middle
with what's on screen.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:16.156 A:middle
So, use the system focus model.

00:19:17.346 --> 00:19:20.406 A:middle
Only in a few special
cases, most common in games,

00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:23.206 A:middle
you may want to customize
the focus appearance.

00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:30.006 A:middle
So, for example, back in Badland
they use animation for focus.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.456 A:middle
And this fits well within the
style of the game, and it works

00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:35.156 A:middle
because focus is obvious.

00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:39.786 A:middle
So, if you want to learn more
about UI Kit and the focus API,

00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:42.206 A:middle
check out the Focus
and Interaction

00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:45.596 A:middle
on tvOS session tomorrow
at 4:00 in Mission.

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:53.106 A:middle
So, with your app icon on
Apple TV, you should design

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:56.976 A:middle
with focus and parallax in mind.

00:19:57.066 --> 00:20:00.306 A:middle
You can create some pretty cool
effects with image layering,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.066 --> 00:20:00.306 A:middle
You can create some pretty cool
effects with image layering,

00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:02.666 A:middle
transparency, scaling,
and motion.

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:06.156 A:middle
And there's a great parallax
preview tool that I'll

00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:10.936 A:middle
in include in the
resources for this talk.

00:20:11.146 --> 00:20:15.336 A:middle
So, when you're designing
your app for Apple TV,

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:17.456 A:middle
you should use intuitive
gestures

00:20:17.556 --> 00:20:20.306 A:middle
and expected button behaviors
such as, menu, returning you

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.366 A:middle
to the previous screen.

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:24.326 A:middle
And implement your
app to work seamlessly

00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:27.866 A:middle
with the Siri Remote's new
remote app and game controllers.

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:31.416 A:middle
You should use the
system focus model

00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:33.386 A:middle
for clarity and consistency.

00:20:34.196 --> 00:20:36.576 A:middle
That way people will feel like
they're interacting directly

00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:39.436 A:middle
with the screen even though
it may be 10 feet away.

00:20:40.126 --> 00:20:44.076 A:middle
And if you make a
custom focus appearance,

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
be sure to make focus obvious.

00:20:47.326 --> 00:20:50.006 A:middle
And focus should always move
in the expected direction

00:20:50.006 --> 00:20:51.496 A:middle
to help aid in navigation.

00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:56.966 A:middle
And finally with the
remote, it's most important

00:20:56.966 --> 00:20:59.926 A:middle
that you don't break people's
connection with what's onscreen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.496 --> 00:21:06.816 A:middle
So, that's designing
for the remote on tvOS.

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:07.326 A:middle
All right.

00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:10.406 A:middle
Awesome. We've made
it to features.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.586 A:middle
And there are a lot of great
new features in tvOS 10.

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:18.336 A:middle
For those of you who were in
this room before, you heard all

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:21.276 A:middle
about these directly from
the engineering team.

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:24.986 A:middle
And don't worry, if you missed
it and came just for design,

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:26.506 A:middle
first, thank you so much.

00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:29.736 A:middle
And secondly, you
can catch up on

00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:31.956 A:middle
that session on your WWDC app.

00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:34.676 A:middle
So, I'm just going
to be focusing

00:21:34.716 --> 00:21:36.566 A:middle
on the new appearance feature,

00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:39.946 A:middle
because that is what
directly impacts your designs.

00:21:41.896 --> 00:21:46.846 A:middle
There is now light and dark
appearance on the Apple TV.

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:49.896 A:middle
And this is user
specified in settings.

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:52.556 A:middle
And it changes the look
of the entire system.

00:21:53.366 --> 00:21:55.766 A:middle
Pretty much every single
control has been adjusted

00:21:55.766 --> 00:21:57.906 A:middle
to some degree for
dark appearance.

00:21:58.456 --> 00:22:00.266 A:middle
This include place
holder images,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.456 --> 00:22:00.266 A:middle
This include place
holder images,

00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:01.876 A:middle
they're dark instead of light.

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.696 A:middle
Shadows have different values.

00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:06.486 A:middle
And this is a great
new feature on tvOS.

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:12.276 A:middle
So, to support dark appearance,
your app needs to opt in.

00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:15.146 A:middle
And I encourage you to do
so, because you've seen

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:17.976 A:middle
in this talk today
how awesome it is.

00:22:18.746 --> 00:22:23.296 A:middle
So, opt in and your app will
respect people's preferences

00:22:23.296 --> 00:22:25.466 A:middle
on how they wish to
experience their TV

00:22:25.826 --> 00:22:27.086 A:middle
in their own environment.

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:32.576 A:middle
Now, user preferences also
apply to accessibility.

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:37.486 A:middle
And Apple TV is packed full
of accessibility features

00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:40.266 A:middle
that provide the best user
experience for everyone.

00:22:41.606 --> 00:22:45.276 A:middle
Apps implementing custom fonts
should match the accessibility

00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:49.176 A:middle
behavior of system fonts and
respect settings like bold type.

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:53.056 A:middle
Accessibility options
also can change contrast,

00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:55.166 A:middle
reduce motion, and more.

00:22:55.796 --> 00:22:57.566 A:middle
So, if you have a
UIKit based app

00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:01.336 A:middle
that could be made accessible
for very little effort.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:01.336 A:middle
that could be made accessible
for very little effort.

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:04.576 A:middle
So, I encourage you to check out
these sessions to learn more.

00:23:07.696 --> 00:23:11.646 A:middle
So, appearance and accessibility
features are powerful

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:12.746 A:middle
on tvOS 10.

00:23:13.236 --> 00:23:16.016 A:middle
And I'm looking forward to
seeing your apps support them.

00:23:17.586 --> 00:23:18.466 A:middle
So, that's features.

00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:23.886 A:middle
Now, I would love to
show you a few apps

00:23:24.186 --> 00:23:27.376 A:middle
that have not only designed
for distance and the remote,

00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:31.896 A:middle
but they're also changing
what we expect from the TV.

00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:36.826 A:middle
So, first this app is Zova.

00:23:37.526 --> 00:23:40.446 A:middle
And it's a lifestyle fitness
app that turns your living room

00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:42.156 A:middle
into a yoga studio or place

00:23:42.156 --> 00:23:43.406 A:middle
where you could workout
with a friend.

00:23:44.546 --> 00:23:47.156 A:middle
Not only is this significantly
better than investing

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:50.776 A:middle
in some workout DVD's, but
it also works beautifully

00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:53.036 A:middle
on Apple TV, because
it's so easy

00:23:53.036 --> 00:23:56.076 A:middle
to find a workout
that you want to do.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.406 A:middle
It has a great well
spaced layout.

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:02.546 A:middle
It's very easy to navigate and
find exactly what you're looking


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:02.546 A:middle
It's very easy to navigate and
find exactly what you're looking

00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:04.136 A:middle
for right from this main screen.

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:07.076 A:middle
And with one click
from the main screen,

00:24:07.506 --> 00:24:09.006 A:middle
you're instantly into a workout.

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:10.746 A:middle
That's it.

00:24:11.386 --> 00:24:13.126 A:middle
Main screen to workout.

00:24:13.726 --> 00:24:14.716 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:17.376 A:middle
And it's not overwhelming,
which is great,

00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:19.806 A:middle
because you don't want
any additional barriers

00:24:19.806 --> 00:24:22.846 A:middle
between you and getting fit.

00:24:23.056 --> 00:24:25.136 A:middle
Zova does a great job
with their layout,

00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:28.086 A:middle
because they use large graphics,
and it keeps you focused

00:24:28.086 --> 00:24:29.926 A:middle
on the content of the app.

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:33.486 A:middle
This app also does something
that is really great.

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:38.706 A:middle
If you put Zova in the top shelf
of your Apple TV, you'll be able

00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:40.916 A:middle
to jump immediately
into a workout,

00:24:41.226 --> 00:24:44.096 A:middle
because it uses dynamic
content in the top shelf.

00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:46.836 A:middle
If you want to find
out more about it,

00:24:46.836 --> 00:24:50.486 A:middle
I will link to the Apple TV Tech
Talks and the resources today.

00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:52.906 A:middle
So, that is Zova.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
This next app that I want to
show you is called, Reuters TV.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:53.806 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
This next app that I want to
show you is called, Reuters TV.

00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:04.756 A:middle
And Reuters really
reimagined what news could be

00:25:05.026 --> 00:25:06.066 A:middle
on the Apple TV.

00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:09.746 A:middle
If you think about traditional
news, when you turn it

00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:12.926 A:middle
on you may be popping in five
minutes late to a broadcast

00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:15.546 A:middle
and you've already missed all of
the big news stories of the day.

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:19.076 A:middle
And I know you can
definitely get all your news

00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:21.696 A:middle
from the internet, but
if you really wanted

00:25:21.696 --> 00:25:26.026 A:middle
to just watch a nice segment
that had everything you needed

00:25:26.026 --> 00:25:28.966 A:middle
to know, well, wouldn't
that be great?

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:31.996 A:middle
Well, that's exactly
what Reuters did.

00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:36.996 A:middle
When you open this app you
only have one decision to make.

00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:41.286 A:middle
And that is, how much time do
you have for the news today?

00:25:42.446 --> 00:25:44.086 A:middle
You make a single action.

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:47.726 A:middle
You choose whether that's
10, 15, or 30 minutes.

00:25:47.726 --> 00:25:49.376 A:middle
And as soon as you select one,

00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:52.026 A:middle
you are immediately
into the experience.

00:25:53.146 --> 00:25:55.296 A:middle
You're given a quick
trailer of what videos are

00:25:55.296 --> 00:25:58.326 A:middle
in your playlist, and then
you're watching the news.

00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:02.496 A:middle
If you wanted to swipe up
to reveal that playlist,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:02.496 A:middle
If you wanted to swipe up
to reveal that playlist,

00:26:02.496 --> 00:26:04.746 A:middle
you can jump to stories that
you are more interested in.

00:26:05.566 --> 00:26:09.346 A:middle
And that's the beauty of
next level on demand content.

00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:13.156 A:middle
Not only did I choose when
I wanted to watch this,

00:26:13.656 --> 00:26:15.486 A:middle
but I was also easily
able to skip

00:26:15.566 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
to what I wanted
to watch with ease.

00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:21.496 A:middle
This app makes it possible
to watch the news again.

00:26:23.216 --> 00:26:27.256 A:middle
Now, while there's an amazing
team who's behind providing all

00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:31.956 A:middle
of this news content, the apps
focused experience is what truly

00:26:31.956 --> 00:26:32.676 A:middle
makes it great.

00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:33.466 A:middle
All right.

00:26:34.536 --> 00:26:37.106 A:middle
So, that is Reuters TV.

00:26:37.646 --> 00:26:40.246 A:middle
Next up is a game.

00:26:40.246 --> 00:26:43.986 A:middle
And this game is
called, Chameleon Run.

00:26:44.886 --> 00:26:48.406 A:middle
This is a colorful,
fun, auto-runner game,

00:26:48.466 --> 00:26:50.036 A:middle
and you may be familiar with it,

00:26:50.396 --> 00:26:52.316 A:middle
because it is an ADA
winner this year.

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:54.376 A:middle
But, that's not why
I'm including it.

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.896 A:middle
I have it here for a
completely different reason.

00:26:58.006 --> 00:27:00.796 A:middle
So, let's just say that I
downloaded Chameleon Run


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.006 --> 00:27:00.796 A:middle
So, let's just say that I
downloaded Chameleon Run

00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
from the app store, and I've
never launched this game before.

00:27:05.516 --> 00:27:08.936 A:middle
So, let's just see what
happens when I click open.

00:27:21.476 --> 00:27:22.536 A:middle
Did you guys see that?

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:24.486 A:middle
It was awesome.

00:27:24.866 --> 00:27:26.946 A:middle
We were instantly into the game.

00:27:27.016 --> 00:27:28.266 A:middle
We just started playing.

00:27:28.896 --> 00:27:31.876 A:middle
Right from launch you're in
and you're playing the game.

00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:33.576 A:middle
And that is awesome.

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:36.776 A:middle
So, now I just want to continue

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:38.346 A:middle
through this first
level a little bit more,

00:27:39.056 --> 00:27:42.306 A:middle
because there's something
else special that is going on.

00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:47.166 A:middle
You are reading a text,
and seeing the animation

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:49.466 A:middle
on the Siri Remote, and
watching your runner,

00:27:50.036 --> 00:27:51.346 A:middle
all at the same time.

00:27:52.506 --> 00:27:54.186 A:middle
The texting graphics are clear.

00:27:54.186 --> 00:27:57.846 A:middle
So, you're able to play and
learn at the exact same time.

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.836 A:middle
And that is fantastic.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:02.816 A:middle
So, let's just fast forward
to the end of this level.

00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:05.326 A:middle
I assure you I landed
every single jump

00:28:05.406 --> 00:28:08.426 A:middle
and I only had to
cut this for time.

00:28:08.626 --> 00:28:10.526 A:middle
So, when you pass
this first level,

00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:14.316 A:middle
which is your first experience
in the game, you get this party.

00:28:14.316 --> 00:28:15.516 A:middle
And you feel great.

00:28:15.996 --> 00:28:17.106 A:middle
You feel accomplished.

00:28:17.576 --> 00:28:20.296 A:middle
And now you're just
welcomed to play more.

00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:24.356 A:middle
Chameleon Run is so much
fun on the Siri Remote.

00:28:24.756 --> 00:28:26.236 A:middle
It has great game play.

00:28:26.626 --> 00:28:28.376 A:middle
And they support
game controllers too.

00:28:29.196 --> 00:28:32.326 A:middle
But, most of all I love
that you're immediately able

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:35.246 A:middle
to jump into the game.

00:28:35.446 --> 00:28:38.316 A:middle
Now, granted not every single
app or game can do this.

00:28:38.756 --> 00:28:41.716 A:middle
But, you should still
consider what you need to do

00:28:41.716 --> 00:28:45.046 A:middle
to make your apps experience
easy, and as quick to jump

00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:48.836 A:middle
to as possible, because
that's why people are there.

00:28:49.006 --> 00:28:50.906 A:middle
They just want to
jump into your app.

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.016 A:middle
And that's Chameleon Run.

00:28:55.436 --> 00:28:57.966 A:middle
This final app is unique.

00:28:58.616 --> 00:29:00.476 A:middle
And it is called, Late Shift.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.616 --> 00:29:00.476 A:middle
And it is called, Late Shift.

00:29:02.156 --> 00:29:03.926 A:middle
This is a cinematic game

00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:06.256 A:middle
that lets you control
the main character.

00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:10.506 A:middle
Decisions you make change
what happens in the movie.

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:13.276 A:middle
And if you want to watch
and play with friends,

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:16.016 A:middle
there's a companion app for the
iPhone that you can download

00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:17.296 A:middle
and make decisions together.

00:29:18.766 --> 00:29:21.596 A:middle
So, potentially you
could have a protagonist

00:29:21.596 --> 00:29:23.256 A:middle
that then turns into
an antagonist.

00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:26.756 A:middle
This is a
choose-your-own-adventure game

00:29:26.786 --> 00:29:30.806 A:middle
with a really easy
navigation, navigational bottle

00:29:31.216 --> 00:29:33.096 A:middle
and a very simple
level selection UI.

00:29:33.216 --> 00:29:37.506 A:middle
And the majority of your
experience is inside this film.

00:29:38.126 --> 00:29:40.836 A:middle
And this game play is
great on the big screen.

00:29:41.316 --> 00:29:43.816 A:middle
You control the movie's
plot from your Siri Remote.

00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:46.316 A:middle
The onboarding is integrated

00:29:46.316 --> 00:29:47.826 A:middle
into the first level's
voice over.

00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:50.456 A:middle
And it lets you know
the important of choice.

00:29:51.716 --> 00:29:54.436 A:middle
Late Shift is an intriguing,
entertainment hybrid

00:29:54.686 --> 00:29:57.386 A:middle
that I'm really excited
to see emerging

00:29:57.386 --> 00:29:58.856 A:middle
in apps on the Apple TV.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:06.676 A:middle
So, we just took a look at
a workout app, a news app,

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:10.426 A:middle
an auto-runner, and an
entertainment hybrid.

00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:13.396 A:middle
So, what do all these
apps have in common?

00:30:14.726 --> 00:30:17.126 A:middle
Well, they all design for
distance and the remote.

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:19.936 A:middle
But, they also really thought

00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:24.556 A:middle
about what their app could do
differently on the Apple TV.

00:30:24.726 --> 00:30:26.676 A:middle
While we've gone through
a few examples today's,

00:30:27.206 --> 00:30:29.636 A:middle
remember that TV's are not
just in your living room.

00:30:30.536 --> 00:30:32.976 A:middle
They're in classrooms,
in offices,

00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:35.276 A:middle
conferences, airports, and more.

00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:39.466 A:middle
So, what do you want your
apps TV experience to be?

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:42.276 A:middle
You need to get into the mindset

00:30:42.576 --> 00:30:44.556 A:middle
of what you want
to do on the TV.

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:48.716 A:middle
And then how to elevate
it with tvOS.

00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:50.806 A:middle
This is not a traditional
device,

00:30:51.246 --> 00:30:53.316 A:middle
so why have a traditional
experience?

00:30:54.116 --> 00:30:57.386 A:middle
We are on the precipice
of change for the TV.

00:30:58.016 --> 00:31:00.596 A:middle
And the TV deserves
your fresh prospective,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.016 --> 00:31:00.596 A:middle
And the TV deserves
your fresh prospective,

00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:04.886 A:middle
because you can create
something powerful and new

00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:07.076 A:middle
that people will love.

00:31:08.436 --> 00:31:10.616 A:middle
So, if there's just one
thing that you take away

00:31:10.616 --> 00:31:15.986 A:middle
from this talk today
it is, design for TV.

00:31:18.016 --> 00:31:21.556 A:middle
For more information including
related resources and the video

00:31:21.556 --> 00:31:23.816 A:middle
of this session,
check out this link.

00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:25.636 A:middle
This is has been session 802.

00:31:26.916 --> 00:31:29.176 A:middle
And there are a lot of
great related sessions,

00:31:29.176 --> 00:31:32.236 A:middle
including the Typography and
Fonts, and Focus Interaction

00:31:32.236 --> 00:31:34.046 A:middle
on tvOS Talk that I mentioned.

00:31:34.876 --> 00:31:37.566 A:middle
And there's a great design
talk that's happening on Friday

00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:41.526 A:middle
at 10 AM, here on this stage,
called Iterative UI Design.

00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:44.346 A:middle
And if you have an idea for
an app and you don't know how

00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:47.446 A:middle
to get started, that would
be a great talk to attend.

00:31:48.216 --> 00:31:49.996 A:middle
This has been Designing
for tvOS.

00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:51.316 A:middle
Have a great conference.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:56.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
