Senior Vice President,

[ Applause ]

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:12.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, well I'm
really excited to be here

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:17.336 A:middle
because this is not the type
of audience I usually address.

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.296 A:middle
I'm not a developer,
as you've heard,

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.316 A:middle
I'm head of Wildlife
Conservation

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:26.006 A:middle
at World Wildlife Fund, which is
the leading organization working

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:30.756 A:middle
globally to protect wild
places and wild species

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.986 A:middle
and to reduce the human
footprint on the planet.

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:37.796 A:middle
WWF has been around
for more than 50 years.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:41.856 A:middle
We work in more than 100
countries and we have more

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.046 A:middle
than 6 million members
worldwide.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.796 A:middle
I'm usually talking to audiences
of conservation scientists

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:52.556 A:middle
or policymakers like congress
or donors and supporters.

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.276 A:middle
But one of the things
I want to talk to you

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:58.826 A:middle
about today is how we're
beginning to use technology

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
to help save the planet and
to help conserve wildlife.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
to help save the planet and
to help conserve wildlife.

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.036 A:middle
And it may surprise you to hear
about some of the interesting

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:08.506 A:middle
and new ways we're using
technology to save wildlife.

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:14.336 A:middle
But first, I want to
step back and take a look

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:15.766 A:middle
at the state of the planet.

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.156 A:middle
We don't hear a lot of good
news on this front these days,

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:23.236 A:middle
we are in fact facing
unprecedented declines of some

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.516 A:middle
of the world's most
magnificent wildlife.

00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:32.016 A:middle
But we're also on the cusp of
some amazing wildlife recoveries

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:34.576 A:middle
and I'm going to tell you
about some of those today.

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:38.906 A:middle
But first, here's the backdrop.

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:41.556 A:middle
Our living planet
report tells us

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:46.026 A:middle
that in the last 40 years
we've lost half the populations

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.446 A:middle
of the world's vertebrate
species.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:53.816 A:middle
That's mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.436 A:middle
It's affecting many of our most
iconic species, including rhinos

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:00.046 A:middle
and tigers and elephants.

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:00.046 A:middle
and tigers and elephants.

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:02.836 A:middle
Why is this happening?

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:07.846 A:middle
The reason it's happening
is twofold, habitat loss

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:12.996 A:middle
and degradation and
illegal hunting or poaching.

00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:18.336 A:middle
Habitat loss is driven mainly
by agricultural expansion due

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.005 A:middle
to growing human numbers,
the demand for food

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:25.766 A:middle
and for commodities like
soy and palm oil and sugar.

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:30.646 A:middle
Also developing infrastructure
like roads

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:33.606 A:middle
and generally growing
urbanization.

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:38.316 A:middle
And climate change is only
adding to the challenge

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:42.116 A:middle
by creating increased
environmental stresses,

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:45.316 A:middle
such as more intense
droughts and flooding,

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.336 A:middle
which is impacting
a lot of things,

00:04:47.646 --> 00:04:49.586 A:middle
including wildlife migrations

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:53.906 A:middle
and seasonal breeding
and feeding patterns.

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:57.986 A:middle
Now simultaneously a
booming illegal trade

00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:00.776 A:middle
in wildlife products
is impacting some

00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:00.776 A:middle
in wildlife products
is impacting some

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:02.306 A:middle
of our most endangered species.

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:08.696 A:middle
This is a trade that is valued
at, at least $20 billion a year

00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:10.256 A:middle
in wildlife and wildlife
products.

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.616 A:middle
Which makes it one of the
top illegal enterprises

00:05:13.616 --> 00:05:17.646 A:middle
in the world amazingly
after narcotics and weapons

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:19.436 A:middle
and human trafficking.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:25.856 A:middle
And it's taking its toll on some
of our most endangered species.

00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:30.356 A:middle
For example, a surge
in the trade of ivory

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.966 A:middle
in recent years has led
to the death of as many

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.896 A:middle
as 30,000 elephants a year.

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
Are traded for their ivory,
which is consumed mainly

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:41.836 A:middle
in Asia, but also here
in the United States.

00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:45.076 A:middle
We are a major wildlife
consuming country,

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:46.406 A:middle
which surprises a lot of people.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:53.166 A:middle
By the time I finish this talk
three elephants will have been

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.476 A:middle
killed illegally
for their ivory.

00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:06.206 A:middle
Now surge in poaching of rhinos
in South Africa has happened

00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:06.206 A:middle
Now surge in poaching of rhinos
in South Africa has happened

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:11.076 A:middle
over the last decade from
13 animals killed in 2007

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:14.246 A:middle
to over 1200 killed last year.

00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:19.066 A:middle
This is driven by
demand in Vietnam mainly,

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:22.736 A:middle
but also in China where rhino
horn is marketed as a cure

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:27.236 A:middle
for cancer and unbelievably
as a hangover treatment.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:31.626 A:middle
And this latter use is a
recent fad and is not rooted

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:34.366 A:middle
in any kind of traditional
medicine and neither

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.496 A:middle
of these uses has any
proven medical efficacy.

00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:42.846 A:middle
And in the last century
we've lost 97%

00:06:42.846 --> 00:06:46.486 A:middle
of the world's wild
tigers, we're down to

00:06:46.486 --> 00:06:48.566 A:middle
as few as 3900 in the wild.

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:52.506 A:middle
Tigers are killed illegally for
their skins, for their bones

00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:54.246 A:middle
and other body parts,
which are used

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.496 A:middle
in modern-day health tonics.

00:06:56.896 --> 00:07:00.226 A:middle
So it's a pretty grim
picture, there's no question

00:06:56.896 --> 00:07:00.226 A:middle
So it's a pretty grim
picture, there's no question

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:03.196 A:middle
and people often ask me well
how do you not just get totally

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:04.896 A:middle
discouraged all the
time in your work

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:07.986 A:middle
with these horrifying statistics
and all the trends going

00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:08.996 A:middle
in the wrong direction.

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:13.306 A:middle
And my response is well yes,
there are a lot of challenges

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:16.576 A:middle
for sure, but we're making
important progress and in fact,

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:19.166 A:middle
some of these trends are
beginning to be reversed.

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:25.136 A:middle
And that is because I believe
that power and possibility.

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:28.926 A:middle
I'm going to talk to you today
about the power of big ideas,

00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:33.566 A:middle
the power of technology, and
the power of communities.

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.546 A:middle
Now I know these
are big concepts

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:37.816 A:middle
that this conference is
famous for dealing with,

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:39.566 A:middle
but what I want to
do today is put

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:42.296 A:middle
into a wildlife conservation
context for you.

00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:47.096 A:middle
So let me tell you what's
happening with tigers.

00:07:47.856 --> 00:07:52.996 A:middle
Seven years ago tiger numbers
reached an all-time low.

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:57.216 A:middle
When we look back now we realize
that something big had to happen

00:07:57.216 --> 00:07:58.726 A:middle
if tigers were going to survive.

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:02.926 A:middle
So we came up with the idea
to hold a global summit

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:02.926 A:middle
So we came up with the idea
to hold a global summit

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
on tiger conservation.

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:07.466 A:middle
That had never been done before
for an endangered species

00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:10.126 A:middle
and we wondered if anyone
would take us seriously.

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:12.176 A:middle
With all the pressing
problems in the world

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:13.486 A:middle
who would care about tigers.

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:17.086 A:middle
Well, we found an
unlikely champion

00:08:17.516 --> 00:08:21.456 A:middle
in President Vladimir Putin
of Russia who it turns

00:08:21.456 --> 00:08:25.026 A:middle
out has a soft spot for
tigers, who would have guessed.

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:29.606 A:middle
Well, we convinced him
to invite world leaders

00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:32.296 A:middle
to a unique gathering
in St. Petersburg,

00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:36.116 A:middle
Russia to chart a path
for the tiger's recovery.

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:42.285 A:middle
We put forward an ambitious
challenge to double the number

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:45.746 A:middle
of tigers in the wild
by the year 2022,

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:49.976 A:middle
which is the next
Chinese year of the tiger.

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:53.086 A:middle
We knew what it would
take to recover tigers,

00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:54.546 A:middle
it's a pretty simple formula.

00:08:55.126 --> 00:08:58.206 A:middle
They need healthy habitat,
they need enough prey to eat

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:01.156 A:middle
and they need to be
protected from poaching.

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:01.156 A:middle
and they need to be
protected from poaching.

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:07.596 A:middle
We also knew that the main
missing ingredient was

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:08.546 A:middle
political will.

00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:14.076 A:middle
Well fortunately, the leaders
of the 13 tiger range countries

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:16.186 A:middle
and these are the countries
where tigers are still left

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:19.816 A:middle
in the wild agreed
and they committed

00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:23.046 A:middle
to a bold new recovery
plan for tigers.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:28.646 A:middle
This was the first of its kind
ever for an endangered species.

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:34.146 A:middle
We call this TX2, Doubling
Tigers in the Wild.

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:38.056 A:middle
And this year marks the
halfway point to 2022.

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:42.786 A:middle
And guess what, governments
in Asia are beginning

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:44.426 A:middle
to implement the recovery plan

00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:49.896 A:middle
and tiger numbers are
beginning to grow in the wild.

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:55.856 A:middle
For example, tigers have been
documented for the first time

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:58.736 A:middle
as breeding in the wild
in northeast China.

00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:02.166 A:middle
And tigers have been recorded

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.906 A:middle
in places they've
never been seen before

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
or documented before, which
is on the border of Thailand

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:11.536 A:middle
and Myanmar, which is where
this video of a mother

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:14.000 A:middle
and her cubs was
taken just last year.

00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:25.296 A:middle
For the first time in a century
overall tiger numbers are

00:10:25.296 --> 00:10:27.216 A:middle
beginning to tick
upward in the wild.

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:30.706 A:middle
If we are successful
in reaching our goal

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.176 A:middle
of doubling tigers it
will be I think one

00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:37.506 A:middle
of the greatest achievements
ever in wildlife conservation.

00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:41.266 A:middle
And personally, I
believe we can do it

00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:44.246 A:middle
because I've seen this
recovery firsthand.

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:52.046 A:middle
So 20 years ago, gosh that
was probably before a lot

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:53.796 A:middle
of you were born.

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:56.736 A:middle
Twenty years ago
I visited a park

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
in India called Ranthambore,
a tiger reserve.

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
in India called Ranthambore,
a tiger reserve.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.566 A:middle
It was a bad time for tigers,

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:07.286 A:middle
poaching had hit many areas
really hard and Ranthambore,

00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:10.456 A:middle
which was once a tiger
stronghold was down to

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:12.666 A:middle
about 10 tigers left
in the whole park.

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:15.706 A:middle
The park was suffering
from bad management,

00:11:16.186 --> 00:11:18.476 A:middle
poor enforcement,
it was pretty bleak.

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:21.116 A:middle
We saw almost no
wildlife at all and I left

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:23.396 A:middle
that place thinking well there's
just no way this park can

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:26.686 A:middle
survive with all the pressing
issues that India has to deal

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.506 A:middle
with how can park
have any future.

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:35.226 A:middle
Well this tiger named
Machali was born

00:11:35.226 --> 00:11:37.086 A:middle
about the time I
visited Ranthambore.

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:40.476 A:middle
We didn't see her then,
but she was there in fact,

00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:42.126 A:middle
she did manage to survive.

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:44.896 A:middle
In fact, she went
on to become one

00:11:44.896 --> 00:11:46.926 A:middle
of Ranthambore's
most famous tigers.

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:51.086 A:middle
Well after I left Ranthambore
things got a little bit worse

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.636 A:middle
in the park, but
then they got better.

00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:57.296 A:middle
The Indian government started
to invest in better enforcement,

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.636 A:middle
more park rangers,
critical research

00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:02.036 A:middle
and things started
to turn around there.

00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:05.736 A:middle
And amazingly, tigers
have started to come back.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:10.426 A:middle
And Machali not only
did she survive she went

00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:15.006 A:middle
on to have 11 cubs with
two different mates,

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.346 A:middle
one of them appropriately
called Big Daddy

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:19.176 A:middle
because he was the
father of seven of them.

00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:23.116 A:middle
And then those cubs went
on to have another 20.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:28.846 A:middle
And so Machali's dynasty
includes more than 30 offspring

00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:30.656 A:middle
and many of them are
doing really well today.

00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:36.046 A:middle
Well I had the chance to go back

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.566 A:middle
to Ranthambore just a few months
ago, in December of last year,

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:42.556 A:middle
and I witnessed an
amazing transformation.

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:44.226 A:middle
The park was teeming with life

00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:48.676 A:middle
and Ranthambore's tiger
numbers are now close to 60.

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:53.696 A:middle
That's a number that actually
exceeds the carrying capacity

00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:58.406 A:middle
of the park, so much so that the
government is actually capturing

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:02.056 A:middle
some tigers and relocating them
to other areas outside the park

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:02.056 A:middle
some tigers and relocating them
to other areas outside the park

00:13:02.456 --> 00:13:05.056 A:middle
and is planning a set of new
reserves for these tigers.

00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:06.926 A:middle
And that's unprecedented

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.436 A:middle
in recent tiger conservation
history.

00:13:09.866 --> 00:13:13.196 A:middle
So I believe we can double the
number of tigers in the wild

00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:14.316 A:middle
if governments

00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:17.656 A:middle
and conservationists help
create the necessary conditions.

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:21.406 A:middle
Perhaps the boldest idea

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:25.876 A:middle
in tiger conservation today is
bringing tigers back to places

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:26.996 A:middle
where they've become extinct.

00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:30.506 A:middle
And this is what Cambodia
is planning to do.

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:33.646 A:middle
This photo was taken in 2007

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.206 A:middle
and it's the last known
tiger in Cambodia.

00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:39.176 A:middle
None have been seen there since.

00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:43.566 A:middle
Well just three months ago the
Cambodian government announced a

00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:47.736 A:middle
plan to bring tigers back to
the eastern plains landscape

00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:51.016 A:middle
of the country, which is a
very biologically diverse area,

00:13:51.016 --> 00:13:53.706 A:middle
there's still a lot of
habitat, tigers can live there,

00:13:53.706 --> 00:13:55.216 A:middle
it's under pretty
serious threat,

00:13:55.756 --> 00:13:57.576 A:middle
but there's enough
habitat for tigers.

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
And we are working with
the Cambodian government

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
And we are working with
the Cambodian government

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.466 A:middle
in several ways to help prepare

00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:05.306 A:middle
for this possible
reintroduction.

00:14:05.306 --> 00:14:09.286 A:middle
We're working to help bring
back the prey species,

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:12.666 A:middle
such as the sambar
dear, kouprey,

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:13.856 A:middle
which is a type of wild cattle.

00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:16.436 A:middle
These are important species
for the tigers to eat.

00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:19.266 A:middle
It happens to also be that
these species are popular

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.836 A:middle
with local people and a lot
of them have been hunted

00:14:21.836 --> 00:14:23.476 A:middle
out because of poor enforcement.

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:25.506 A:middle
So we're helping to
bring these species back

00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:28.566 A:middle
and also helping the government
to increase its enforcement

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:31.836 A:middle
in this area because tigers and
their prey will never survive

00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:32.946 A:middle
without good enforcement.

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:37.596 A:middle
And we're also working to
prepare the local people

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:40.496 A:middle
for the prospect of
living next to one

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:42.276 A:middle
of the world's great predators.

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:46.666 A:middle
Interestingly, in our
conservation work with wildlife

00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:50.366 A:middle
as human populations grow
we have increasing conflict

00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:51.136 A:middle
with people.

00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:55.386 A:middle
It's happening all over the
world, but also interestingly

00:14:55.386 --> 00:14:57.896 A:middle
in Cambodia, there's
a lot of local support

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.816 A:middle
for bringing tigers
back as it turns out.

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:02.786 A:middle
Because tigers have
always been a popular part

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:02.786 A:middle
Because tigers have
always been a popular part

00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:05.726 A:middle
of Cambodian culture
and natural history.

00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:10.576 A:middle
Well if all goes well the
government of Cambodia hopes

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:15.536 A:middle
to get eight tigers from India
in 2019 for release to the wild.

00:15:16.356 --> 00:15:20.236 A:middle
It's a long and complicated
road ahead and it's not

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:24.536 A:middle
without controversy or risk,
but if it happens it will be one

00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:26.756 A:middle
of the most exciting
developments I think

00:15:26.756 --> 00:15:28.246 A:middle
in wildlife conservation.

00:15:28.246 --> 00:15:35.006 A:middle
Well I'm happy to say that
rhinos are also recovering

00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:36.366 A:middle
in parts of their range.

00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:39.406 A:middle
Whole new populations
actually are being established

00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:42.426 A:middle
by physically moving these
prehistoric looking animals

00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:45.136 A:middle
to help set up safe
new homes for them

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:46.966 A:middle
where their numbers can grow.

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:50.976 A:middle
And I want to show you a video
of a big idea that's playing

00:15:50.976 --> 00:15:55.846 A:middle
out in South Africa where
incredibly the safest way

00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:58.516 A:middle
to physically move these
animals is to tranquilize them

00:15:58.516 --> 00:16:02.776 A:middle
and lift them up by
helicopter for transport by air

00:15:58.516 --> 00:16:02.776 A:middle
and lift them up by
helicopter for transport by air

00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:06.076 A:middle

otherwise take many hours

fight for them.

pioneering rhino translocations

is Nepal where it has
increased its populations

of greater one horned
rhino, another species,

Well, sometimes big ideas
need to be backed by the power

00:21:11.356 --> 00:21:14.576 A:middle
of technology and we are
increasingly using tech

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:18.306 A:middle
in our work, on the ground, in
the cloud, information sharing,

00:21:18.306 --> 00:21:21.036 A:middle
crowdsourcing to the
Internet of things

00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:23.116 A:middle
and all the sensors
that are part of it.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:27.286 A:middle
There's no question that
technology is helping to fortify

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:30.306 A:middle
and accelerate many of our
wildlife conservation efforts.

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:34.476 A:middle
But just for a larger context,
when I first went to Ranthambore

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:38.626 A:middle
in India, the human
population of India was

00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:39.886 A:middle
about a billion people.

00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:43.746 A:middle
India is projected to add
another half billion people

00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:45.866 A:middle
to its population by 2050.

00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:50.216 A:middle
In Africa, the human
population is expected to double

00:21:50.406 --> 00:21:54.206 A:middle
by the year 2015 and double
again by the end of the century.

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:57.646 A:middle
Technology needs to
help conservation adapt

00:21:57.886 --> 00:21:59.916 A:middle
to this crowded new world.

00:22:00.926 --> 00:22:03.316 A:middle
So let me show you some of
the ways that we're using tech

00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:08.396 A:middle
in our work from new tracking
methods of wildlife using DNA

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:12.956 A:middle
to detecting and deterring
poaching using thermal cameras

00:22:13.036 --> 00:22:13.836 A:middle

So our work tracking
wildlife has come a long way.

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:23.916 A:middle
We used to rely on pugmarks
to footprints or scat,

00:22:24.516 --> 00:22:27.866 A:middle
which are animal droppings
to count and monitor animals

00:22:27.866 --> 00:22:31.286 A:middle
and that was very laborious
and pretty imprecise.

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:36.886 A:middle
So camera traps have become
kind of the mainstream way

00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:39.966 A:middle
of monitoring animals
in the natural habitat.

00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:43.366 A:middle
Camera traps are cameras set
up remotely that are triggered

00:22:43.366 --> 00:22:46.836 A:middle
by a motion sensor when an
animal crosses its path.

00:22:46.836 --> 00:22:50.706 A:middle
And these are especially useful
for species that are most active

00:22:50.706 --> 00:22:56.146 A:middle
at night like lions or species
that have distinctive markings

00:22:56.146 --> 00:22:59.786 A:middle
like a brown hyena where
you can identify individuals

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:02.276 A:middle
by their markings and
the same with tigers.

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:02.276 A:middle
by their markings and
the same with tigers.

00:23:02.376 --> 00:23:07.066 A:middle
In fact, the latest tiger
surveys have relied on thousands

00:23:07.066 --> 00:23:09.776 A:middle
and thousands of
images from camera traps

00:23:10.386 --> 00:23:13.356 A:middle
that are giving us the latest
tiger population trends.

00:23:14.016 --> 00:23:16.776 A:middle
And as cameras become lighter

00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:21.606 A:middle
and smaller they are
giving us a wonderful window

00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:25.276 A:middle
into what the world looks like
from an animal's perspective.

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:29.696 A:middle
And videos like this help
us understand how species

00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:31.406 A:middle
like turtles are
using their habitat,

00:23:31.596 --> 00:23:34.376 A:middle
which helps us understand
how to protect them better.

00:23:34.756 --> 00:23:36.926 A:middle
They are also great tools
for raising awareness.

00:23:37.756 --> 00:23:40.986 A:middle
This video has been viewed
by millions of people,

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:44.246 A:middle
it's gone viral and it's been a
very popular one that's really

00:23:44.246 --> 00:23:51.386 A:middle
helped connect people to
turtles in a unique way.

00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:55.186 A:middle
And innovative uses of GPS
technology are helping us

00:23:55.186 --> 00:23:59.196 A:middle
to understand where wildlife
is going, their daily movements

00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:00.716 A:middle
and their seasonal migrations.

00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:00.716 A:middle
and their seasonal migrations.

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:06.526 A:middle
One of our scientists made
a cool discovery in 2012

00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:10.116 A:middle
by putting special
satellite collars

00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:12.146 A:middle
with the latest GPS
technology on a group

00:24:12.146 --> 00:24:16.716 A:middle
of eight zebras he discovered
that they moved from a part

00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:19.486 A:middle
of northern Namibia to
the middle of Botswana,

00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:21.876 A:middle
about 200 miles south.

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:26.306 A:middle
And this turns out to be the
longest known terrestrial

00:24:26.306 --> 00:24:29.396 A:middle
migration in Africa and
it's amazing to think

00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:32.286 A:middle
that as recently as just
four years ago we didn't know

00:24:32.526 --> 00:24:34.796 A:middle
about the longest land
migration in Africa

00:24:35.346 --> 00:24:37.336 A:middle
and this technology
made that possible.

00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:41.906 A:middle
So here's an animation of the
zebras moving over the course

00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:43.336 A:middle
of about six or seven months.

00:24:43.546 --> 00:24:47.276 A:middle
Each colored dot represents
an individual zebra.

00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:49.286 A:middle
They start in this
northern part of Namibia

00:24:49.286 --> 00:24:53.306 A:middle
and they start moving south
as the wet season comes on.

00:24:53.306 --> 00:24:55.406 A:middle
You'll see the dark green
background indicating the wet

00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:56.186 A:middle
season is coming.

00:24:56.186 --> 00:24:58.886 A:middle
They move south pretty
quickly to a special place

00:24:58.886 --> 00:25:02.046 A:middle
where it turns out they eat a
very nutritious grass during the

00:24:58.886 --> 00:25:02.046 A:middle
where it turns out they eat a
very nutritious grass during the

00:25:02.046 --> 00:25:02.696 A:middle
wet season.

00:25:03.056 --> 00:25:07.366 A:middle
They hang out there for about
10 weeks and then they kind

00:25:07.366 --> 00:25:09.666 A:middle
of start meandering
back up north

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.976 A:middle
to the place from
where they came.

00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:14.596 A:middle
It takes them a little
longer to get back up,

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:17.296 A:middle
but they finally end up back
when the dry season comes

00:25:17.296 --> 00:25:20.226 A:middle
to their preferred
habitat in Namibia.

00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:24.066 A:middle
And the importance of this
data is that we can now use it

00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:27.866 A:middle
to advocate for protecting
the species

00:25:28.406 --> 00:25:31.326 A:middle
through its whole
migration corridor

00:25:31.686 --> 00:25:33.876 A:middle
and thus preserve the
lifecycle of the herd

00:25:34.236 --> 00:25:35.286 A:middle
in this particular area.

00:25:35.956 --> 00:25:38.926 A:middle
Well, one of the most
recent developments

00:25:39.336 --> 00:25:42.776 A:middle
that I'm most excited
about is the use

00:25:42.776 --> 00:25:46.736 A:middle
of thermal imaging cameras to
help identify poaching threats.

00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:49.086 A:middle
Thermal cameras are also known

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.946 A:middle
as infrared cameras
detect the heat emitted

00:25:52.026 --> 00:25:53.856 A:middle
from a person or an animal.

00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:56.366 A:middle
And in a pilot we're undertaking

00:25:56.476 --> 00:26:00.406 A:middle
in Africa we're pairing
these cameras with software

00:25:56.476 --> 00:26:00.406 A:middle
in Africa we're pairing
these cameras with software

00:26:00.406 --> 00:26:03.826 A:middle
that is able to distinguish
an animal from a person.

00:26:03.926 --> 00:26:07.386 A:middle
So when a person crosses
into a park illegally

00:26:07.386 --> 00:26:11.676 A:middle
or inappropriately the software
automatically sends a signal

00:26:11.746 --> 00:26:13.006 A:middle
to enforcement authorities.

00:26:14.096 --> 00:26:17.086 A:middle
Since these cameras were
installed a few weeks ago,

00:26:17.086 --> 00:26:20.886 A:middle
they're put on poles actually
and they have a viewing range

00:26:20.886 --> 00:26:24.236 A:middle
of 2 miles, up to 2
miles, a huge range.

00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:28.436 A:middle
And since they were installed
they have detected several

00:26:28.476 --> 00:26:30.586 A:middle
intruders in this
particular area

00:26:30.586 --> 00:26:33.316 A:middle
and one suspected
poacher has been arrested.

00:26:33.316 --> 00:26:35.976 A:middle
And let me show you the
video of the poacher

00:26:36.026 --> 00:26:38.086 A:middle
or suspected poacher
who was arrested.

00:26:38.716 --> 00:26:40.796 A:middle
You see him walking
along the fence line,

00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:42.446 A:middle
which is the border of the park.

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:47.716 A:middle
He's looking for a way to get
into the park inappropriately.

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:54.046 A:middle
Finally finds a way, jumps
over and he's in the park.

00:26:54.476 --> 00:26:57.916 A:middle
And that red box around him
is what triggers the signal,

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:58.736 A:middle
the alert that's sent

00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:01.196 A:middle
to enforcement authorities
who later nabbed him.

00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:01.196 A:middle
to enforcement authorities
who later nabbed him.

00:27:02.076 --> 00:27:05.136 A:middle
So if this technology
is successful,

00:27:05.136 --> 00:27:08.446 A:middle
if this pilot works we hope
to scale it to other areas

00:27:08.446 --> 00:27:10.716 A:middle
where we think it could
have a really good use

00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:13.916 A:middle
in perimeter security
around protected areas.

00:27:15.856 --> 00:27:20.476 A:middle
Well remember I said earlier we
started our work years ago using

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:22.966 A:middle
footprints as a way to track
animals and count them.

00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:25.116 A:middle
Well we're still
using footprints,

00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:28.216 A:middle
but these days we're
extracting DNA from them.

00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:33.136 A:middle
Through advances in DNA
technology an amazing amount

00:27:33.136 --> 00:27:36.696 A:middle
of information can be drawn
from a polar bear footprint

00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:40.386 A:middle
in the snow, including
the gender of the animal

00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:44.026 A:middle
and incredibly what it
had for its last meal.

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
So as we're working
with DNA experts

00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:52.026 A:middle
to refine this technology
and get the cost down.

00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:53.416 A:middle
But this has the potential

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:56.016 A:middle
to revolutionize
how we track animals

00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:58.916 A:middle
in their natural habitats and
it's particularly useful --

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:01.966 A:middle
it could be useful for species
like polar bears who live

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:01.966 A:middle
it could be useful for species
like polar bears who live

00:28:01.966 --> 00:28:05.096 A:middle
in very extreme environments,
making them extremely difficult

00:28:05.096 --> 00:28:07.266 A:middle
to study and very
expensive to study.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:12.446 A:middle
So this is exciting as well.

00:28:13.286 --> 00:28:16.756 A:middle
Well, we've been hearing
a lot about drones

00:28:16.756 --> 00:28:21.066 A:middle
in so many different ways
and drones are a big part

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.236 A:middle
of our work in conservation.

00:28:22.236 --> 00:28:24.716 A:middle
There's been a lot of
hype about them as well.

00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:28.966 A:middle
The challenge we have with
using drones in conservation is

00:28:29.066 --> 00:28:33.446 A:middle
to develop civilian level
systems of drones that have some

00:28:33.446 --> 00:28:35.506 A:middle
of the similar capabilities
as military drones,

00:28:35.506 --> 00:28:36.966 A:middle
but at a fraction of the cost,

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.836 A:middle
otherwise they're just
never going to be used

00:28:38.836 --> 00:28:40.886 A:middle
by park managers and
conservationists.

00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:44.116 A:middle
So we're experimenting
with these different sort

00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:48.476 A:middle
of downscaled systems of
using different approaches

00:28:48.476 --> 00:28:50.616 A:middle
and for different needs.

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:53.806 A:middle
For example, we're using
them to map colonies

00:28:53.806 --> 00:28:56.386 A:middle
of prairie dogs here
in United States.

00:28:57.366 --> 00:29:00.306 A:middle
Prairie dogs happen to
be the main prey species

00:28:57.366 --> 00:29:00.306 A:middle
Prairie dogs happen to
be the main prey species

00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:03.326 A:middle
for the most endangered
mammal in North America,

00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:05.856 A:middle
which is the black-footed
ferrets.

00:29:06.436 --> 00:29:11.256 A:middle
So by knowing where prairie dogs
live we know where ferrets live

00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:12.746 A:middle
or have the potential to live

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:16.366 A:middle
so we can thus help better
develop recovery efforts

00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:17.286 A:middle
for them.

00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:22.936 A:middle
We're also using drones to
help identify poaching threats

00:29:23.256 --> 00:29:24.896 A:middle
and address poaching in Africa.

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:29.446 A:middle
Well the challenge
we've had with drones is

00:29:29.446 --> 00:29:33.696 A:middle
that they are probably
best used and best function

00:29:33.696 --> 00:29:38.276 A:middle
as reactionary tools or
devices that are deployed

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:42.036 A:middle
when another sensor is set
off somewhere else in the area

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.416 A:middle
that the drones can
then help pinpoint

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.966 A:middle
where potential illegal
activity is taking place.

00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:52.036 A:middle
In fact, drones because
right now the viewing

00:29:52.696 --> 00:29:58.706 A:middle
of the videos is not as broad
as it could be the range.

00:29:58.926 --> 00:30:01.816 A:middle
We are now working to
try to get those improved

00:29:58.926 --> 00:30:01.816 A:middle
We are now working to
try to get those improved

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:03.966 A:middle
so that more can be
seen from a drone.

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:06.736 A:middle
We're also trying to
develop software much

00:30:06.736 --> 00:30:10.356 A:middle
like with the thermal cameras
that can help us identify people

00:30:10.506 --> 00:30:14.596 A:middle
from animals and thus, send
alerts automatically to rangers.

00:30:14.656 --> 00:30:16.986 A:middle
So we're continuing to
evolve our work with drones

00:30:16.986 --> 00:30:19.516 A:middle
and they certainly have a
role to play in different ways

00:30:19.966 --> 00:30:21.796 A:middle
if we can get the
capabilities improved.

00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:27.346 A:middle
We're also continuing to think
of new ideas to help some

00:30:27.346 --> 00:30:30.156 A:middle
of our challenges and I wanted
to share a couple that are

00:30:30.156 --> 00:30:31.696 A:middle
in their early stages
of development.

00:30:32.246 --> 00:30:37.036 A:middle
These are wire snares, snares
are one of the greatest hazards

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:38.686 A:middle
to wildlife everywhere.

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:41.026 A:middle
Literally millions and
millions of them are used

00:30:41.026 --> 00:30:45.376 A:middle
around the world and they
are creating real havoc

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.646 A:middle
for wildlife.

00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:50.316 A:middle
They're easy, unfortunately
they're inexpensive

00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:54.396 A:middle
and relatively easy to use
and we need to find a way

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:57.616 A:middle
to detect them better, so
that rangers can collect them.

00:30:58.226 --> 00:31:01.126 A:middle
In fact, in one park in
Malawi last year just

00:30:58.226 --> 00:31:01.126 A:middle
In fact, in one park in
Malawi last year just

00:31:01.126 --> 00:31:02.976 A:middle
to give you a sense of
how widely these are used.

00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:07.486 A:middle
Malawi is a country in Africa,
13,000 snares were collected

00:31:07.486 --> 00:31:10.196 A:middle
over an eight month period
and that probably wasn't all

00:31:10.196 --> 00:31:11.586 A:middle
that were in this
particular park.

00:31:11.966 --> 00:31:14.506 A:middle
So what we're doing is we're
experimenting with types

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:18.026 A:middle
of radar to try to map where
snares are because they're made

00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:19.576 A:middle
of metal we can use
radar we hope.

00:31:19.896 --> 00:31:21.786 A:middle
Potentially positioned
from drones,

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:24.986 A:middle
so that rangers can
more easily find them

00:31:24.986 --> 00:31:26.056 A:middle
and go out and collect them.

00:31:26.346 --> 00:31:27.296 A:middle
And if we can do this

00:31:27.296 --> 00:31:31.346 A:middle
in a cost-effective way it could
be a huge gain for wildlife.

00:31:32.366 --> 00:31:36.226 A:middle
Snares typically grab
an animal by its leg

00:31:36.446 --> 00:31:38.156 A:middle
and inflict a lot of injury.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:41.626 A:middle
Sometimes it'll grab them
by the neck like this zebra,

00:31:41.956 --> 00:31:44.326 A:middle
fortunately the zebra
was able to survive,

00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:48.286 A:middle
but often species do not.

00:31:49.056 --> 00:31:54.296 A:middle
We're also working on a gunshot
detector to help pinpoint

00:31:54.336 --> 00:31:56.166 A:middle
where poaching is happening.

00:31:57.116 --> 00:32:00.116 A:middle
And we got the idea from
a tool called ShotSpotter,

00:31:57.116 --> 00:32:00.116 A:middle
And we got the idea from
a tool called ShotSpotter,

00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:03.256 A:middle
which we actually read about
in the Washington Post.

00:32:03.746 --> 00:32:07.636 A:middle
ShotSpotter is used by police
departments to try to pinpoint

00:32:07.636 --> 00:32:11.916 A:middle
where gunshots are happening
in cities through audio sensors

00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:13.216 A:middle
that are placed on buildings.

00:32:14.146 --> 00:32:17.106 A:middle
We called up the Washington DC
Police Department who invited us

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:19.446 A:middle
down to see ShotSpotter
in action.

00:32:20.256 --> 00:32:23.666 A:middle
We sat in the command center
looking at this big screen

00:32:24.226 --> 00:32:26.736 A:middle
as pins dropped in real time

00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:29.216 A:middle
as shots were going
off around the city.

00:32:29.286 --> 00:32:31.366 A:middle
It was quite a surreal
experience.

00:32:32.496 --> 00:32:35.466 A:middle
The challenge we have on
the wildlife front is,

00:32:35.546 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
where do you put
sensors, audio sensors,

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:40.286 A:middle
in a vast national park?

00:32:40.936 --> 00:32:43.236 A:middle
No buildings there,
huge territory.

00:32:44.006 --> 00:32:47.826 A:middle
Well the idea that we're working
on is to place the detector

00:32:47.826 --> 00:32:50.386 A:middle
on a special collar
fitted on an elephant

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:54.336 A:middle
that could help rangers
quickly come to an area

00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:55.726 A:middle
where maybe an animal
has been shot

00:32:55.726 --> 00:32:58.546 A:middle
and if it's only wounded they
may stand a better chance

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:00.726 A:middle
of saving it than
they otherwise would

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:00.726 A:middle
of saving it than
they otherwise would

00:33:00.726 --> 00:33:05.646 A:middle
and it could prevent
further killing of the herd.

00:33:06.446 --> 00:33:08.496 A:middle
Also it could be
a good deterrent

00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:10.396 A:middle
by simply seeing this device

00:33:10.706 --> 00:33:14.676 A:middle
on the elephant poachers
may stay away.

00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:18.236 A:middle
This could be a great
tool for conservation,

00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:20.986 A:middle
but right now the costs
are a pretty significant

00:33:20.986 --> 00:33:21.956 A:middle
limiting factor.

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:28.746 A:middle
Well none of this really
promising technology can replace

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:31.276 A:middle
people on the ground,
the rangers,

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:34.316 A:middle
the enforcement officers,
the communities

00:33:34.466 --> 00:33:37.756 A:middle
who are really critical
to protecting wildlife.

00:33:37.756 --> 00:33:41.376 A:middle
In fact, it's often the people
who live closest to the wildlife

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.606 A:middle
who are its greatest guardians.

00:33:44.236 --> 00:33:47.176 A:middle
I mentioned earlier
the country of Nepal

00:33:47.176 --> 00:33:50.506 A:middle
and its successful rhino
conservation efforts.

00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:54.726 A:middle
A lot of that success is due
to the direct involvement

00:33:54.726 --> 00:33:56.926 A:middle
of communities and conservation.

00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:01.596 A:middle
Nepal has achieved
a remarkable record.

00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:01.596 A:middle
Nepal has achieved
a remarkable record.

00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:09.235 A:middle
In fact, in the last six
years, four of those years,

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:12.726 A:middle
Nepal has had zero
poaching of rhinos.

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:15.386 A:middle
This is an amazing
achievement at a time

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.786 A:middle
when rhino poaching
is happening,

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:20.286 A:middle
big rates everywhere
in the world.

00:34:20.835 --> 00:34:23.476 A:middle
The reason for this
is the involvement

00:34:23.476 --> 00:34:25.755 A:middle
of local communities, big
commitments from the government,

00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:29.606 A:middle
but particularly communities
have set up informer networks

00:34:30.315 --> 00:34:34.235 A:middle
that share critical tips
on illegal activities

00:34:34.295 --> 00:34:36.406 A:middle
and help track poaching

00:34:36.406 --> 00:34:39.996 A:middle
and illegal trading
activities in wildlife.

00:34:40.056 --> 00:34:46.686 A:middle
And in fact, one notorious rhino
smuggler was recently prosecuted

00:34:46.686 --> 00:34:51.356 A:middle
in Nepal after community
members collected information

00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:54.346 A:middle
and they banded together
to turn him in.

00:34:54.346 --> 00:34:57.476 A:middle
And he's now serving
a seven year sentence,

00:34:58.106 --> 00:35:01.066 A:middle
which is a long sentence
for a wildlife crime.

00:34:58.106 --> 00:35:01.066 A:middle
which is a long sentence
for a wildlife crime.

00:35:02.396 --> 00:35:08.086 A:middle
In the country of Namibia all
the trends that you're seeing

00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:12.696 A:middle
across Africa have been bucked
in this country and that is due

00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:14.976 A:middle
to the involvement of
communities and conservation.

00:35:16.036 --> 00:35:19.176 A:middle
Namibia has actually seen
growth almost across the board

00:35:19.176 --> 00:35:21.716 A:middle
of its wildlife populations
in the last 20 years

00:35:22.206 --> 00:35:26.436 A:middle
and its elephant numbers have in
fact tripled since the 1990's.

00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:30.256 A:middle
At a time when unfortunately
numbers have plummeted

00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:32.196 A:middle
in most other countries
in Africa.

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:36.756 A:middle
And this is because communities
are directly involved

00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:39.076 A:middle
in conservation as the
managers and stewards

00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:40.116 A:middle
of the wildlife there.

00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:44.246 A:middle
Legislation in Namibia
gives communities the right

00:35:44.246 --> 00:35:47.396 A:middle
and the responsibility to
manage wildlife resources

00:35:47.396 --> 00:35:48.916 A:middle
under their jurisdictions.

00:35:49.826 --> 00:35:52.266 A:middle
It also allows them
to benefit directly

00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:54.186 A:middle
from the revenues associated

00:35:54.186 --> 00:35:58.546 A:middle
with wildlife related
activities like ecotourism.

00:35:59.236 --> 00:36:02.176 A:middle
This gives them a direct
incentive in and stake

00:35:59.236 --> 00:36:02.176 A:middle
This gives them a direct
incentive in and stake

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:05.086 A:middle
in conservation and that
has made all the difference.

00:36:05.656 --> 00:36:09.996 A:middle
This is truly a model program
for both wildlife conservation

00:36:10.096 --> 00:36:12.056 A:middle
and world development
and in fact,

00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:13.906 A:middle
a lot of countries
are looking to Namibia

00:36:14.346 --> 00:36:17.426 A:middle
to learn how they're doing it
so they can also adopt some

00:36:17.516 --> 00:36:19.906 A:middle
of these same practices.

00:36:20.126 --> 00:36:22.566 A:middle
While communities of
another sort are helping us

00:36:22.566 --> 00:36:26.566 A:middle
to address the needed
reforms and policies in some

00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:29.026 A:middle
of the most important
wildlife consuming countries.

00:36:29.816 --> 00:36:33.506 A:middle
That letter that was up
there is called Chor Chang,

00:36:33.856 --> 00:36:36.246 A:middle
it is a letter in
the Thai alphabet.

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:40.426 A:middle
It also happens to
be the first letter

00:36:40.806 --> 00:36:45.336 A:middle
for the word elephant in Thai.

00:36:45.596 --> 00:36:48.376 A:middle
We asked people in
Thailand, which happens

00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:52.646 A:middle
to be the world's second
largest market for ivory,

00:36:53.526 --> 00:36:57.786 A:middle
to help raise awareness
about the illegal ivory trade

00:36:58.356 --> 00:37:01.476 A:middle
by trying to imagine a
world without elephants.

00:36:58.356 --> 00:37:01.476 A:middle
by trying to imagine a
world without elephants.

00:37:01.966 --> 00:37:06.336 A:middle
By symbolically erasing
the letter Chor Chang

00:37:06.336 --> 00:37:07.186 A:middle
from their names.

00:37:07.866 --> 00:37:14.486 A:middle
This campaign went viral, over
a million people participated.

00:37:15.046 --> 00:37:18.656 A:middle
They posted pictures
of their name online

00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:22.076 A:middle
without the letter Chor
Chang in it on Facebook,

00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.506 A:middle
on Twitter, on Instagram.

00:37:23.896 --> 00:37:27.316 A:middle
And result was huge public
pressure on the Thai government

00:37:27.616 --> 00:37:29.676 A:middle
to crack down on the
illegal ivory trade

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:33.926 A:middle
and to reform its ivory
trade laws and they did.

00:37:33.926 --> 00:37:35.496 A:middle
It was a big success.

00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:41.696 A:middle
Just two weeks ago here in
this country our own federal

00:37:41.696 --> 00:37:46.616 A:middle
government announced a new
regulation, a final regulation

00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:48.956 A:middle
to ban almost all
commercial trade

00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:51.206 A:middle
of ivory in the United States.

00:37:52.246 --> 00:37:55.226 A:middle
Something we've been working
on for more than three years.

00:37:57.256 --> 00:38:02.456 A:middle
This regulation was
partly made real

00:37:57.256 --> 00:38:02.456 A:middle
This regulation was
partly made real

00:38:02.456 --> 00:38:05.716 A:middle
by huge public outpouring
of support for it.

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.656 A:middle
In fact, WWF was
able to generate more

00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:11.436 A:middle
than a million signatures
on an online petition,

00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:13.476 A:middle
which is the most the
governments ever received

00:38:14.026 --> 00:38:16.146 A:middle
from an organization
on a wildlife issue.

00:38:16.636 --> 00:38:20.686 A:middle
And the significance of
this regulation is not only

00:38:20.686 --> 00:38:24.316 A:middle
because the U.S. is one of
the top five ivory markets

00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:28.156 A:middle
in the world, it has also
prompted similar action

00:38:28.186 --> 00:38:32.206 A:middle
in China, the world's
largest market for ivory.

00:38:32.826 --> 00:38:36.436 A:middle
In fact, one of our big
breakthroughs last year was a

00:38:36.436 --> 00:38:40.726 A:middle
joint commitment by President
Obama and President Xi of China

00:38:41.646 --> 00:38:44.206 A:middle
to take action against
the illegal ivory trade

00:38:45.376 --> 00:38:49.596 A:middle
and we're beginning to see
that commitment implemented.

00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:52.506 A:middle
And I'm really happy to share

00:38:52.506 --> 00:38:57.806 A:middle
that just a week
ago China announced

00:38:57.806 --> 00:39:01.846 A:middle
at the U.S. China strategic
and economic dialogue talks

00:38:57.806 --> 00:39:01.846 A:middle
at the U.S. China strategic
and economic dialogue talks

00:39:01.996 --> 00:39:05.456 A:middle
in Beijing that they
will announce by the end

00:39:05.456 --> 00:39:08.436 A:middle
of this year a timetable
for shutting

00:39:08.436 --> 00:39:10.456 A:middle
down their domestic
ivory market.

00:39:11.526 --> 00:39:14.546 A:middle
This is a huge deal
for conservation.

00:39:15.496 --> 00:39:18.006 A:middle
If China makes good
on its commitment

00:39:19.266 --> 00:39:22.106 A:middle
and we will do everything we
can to ensure that they do,

00:39:22.106 --> 00:39:25.086 A:middle
it will be a game changer
for Africa's elephants.

actively participate

00:39:39.396 --> 00:39:42.906 A:middle
in conservation issues
is a really critical part

00:39:42.906 --> 00:39:46.336 A:middle
of our strategy at WWF.

Our work in close collaboration

with Apple actually started last
year with a conservation project

in China to protect up to
a million acres of forest.

00:41:25.096 --> 00:41:30.086 A:middle

00:42:39.076 --> 00:42:41.756 A:middle
of our time, such
as climate change.

00:42:42.976 --> 00:42:44.676 A:middle
We reached millions of people

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.846 A:middle
with critical conservation
messages.

00:42:48.256 --> 00:42:52.256 A:middle
And we also raised critical
funding for conservation.

00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:57.296 A:middle
In fact, I am super excited to
be able to share with you today

00:42:58.496 --> 00:43:03.476 A:middle
that Apps for Earth raised over
$8 million for conservation.

00:42:58.496 --> 00:43:03.476 A:middle
that Apps for Earth raised over
$8 million for conservation.

00:43:09.046 --> 00:43:12.866 A:middle
This is unprecedented, it's
a huge deal for conservation

00:43:12.866 --> 00:43:16.586 A:middle
and this critical funding
will go to help advance some

00:43:16.586 --> 00:43:19.436 A:middle
of the initiatives you've heard
about today like doubling tigers

00:43:19.436 --> 00:43:22.506 A:middle
in the wild and protecting
forest and saving coral reefs.

00:43:23.296 --> 00:43:24.066 A:middle
It's a huge deal.

00:43:24.496 --> 00:43:28.336 A:middle
We are so grateful to everyone
who participated and especially,

00:43:28.336 --> 00:43:30.256 A:middle
to Apple who made
it all possible.

00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:35.496 A:middle
If we can do this kind of thing
together just imagine what we

00:43:35.496 --> 00:43:39.306 A:middle
can do if we continue to
apply our most creative ideas

00:43:39.306 --> 00:43:41.096 A:middle
in support of conservation.

00:43:42.776 --> 00:43:46.316 A:middle
We're making important progress,
but there's so much more to do.

00:43:47.856 --> 00:43:52.356 A:middle
To save everything we need
everyone and there are a lot

00:43:52.356 --> 00:43:55.746 A:middle
of critical challenges that the
tech industry can help with.

00:43:56.876 --> 00:43:59.566 A:middle
There's no question that
technology has a critical role

00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:01.986 A:middle
to play in our vision
for saving the planet.

00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:01.986 A:middle
to play in our vision
for saving the planet.

00:44:03.476 --> 00:44:06.486 A:middle
We need your help to
address the digital divide,

00:44:07.976 --> 00:44:10.266 A:middle
the lack of connectivity
in remote areas

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:13.206 A:middle
where conservation happens,
which are often beyond the reach

00:44:13.206 --> 00:44:15.686 A:middle
of the global system for
mobile communication.

00:44:16.496 --> 00:44:20.596 A:middle
And we need your help to develop
smaller, less expensive devices

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:24.546 A:middle
with longer battery times so
that we can track all the users

00:44:24.986 --> 00:44:28.346 A:middle
in a protected area, both
the animals and the people,

00:44:29.306 --> 00:44:31.206 A:middle
and transmit data in real time

00:44:31.206 --> 00:44:33.466 A:middle
to conservation scientists
and managers.

00:44:34.686 --> 00:44:36.756 A:middle
And as the technology
of the Internet

00:44:36.756 --> 00:44:38.426 A:middle
of things develops
we need your help

00:44:38.426 --> 00:44:40.656 A:middle
to deploy it in conservation.

00:44:41.236 --> 00:44:46.626 A:middle
And we need your help to
find the most innovative ways

00:44:46.626 --> 00:44:49.206 A:middle
to reach people everywhere
with compelling stories

00:44:49.206 --> 00:44:53.000 A:middle
about conservation to get
them onboard with our mission.

00:44:58.046 --> 00:45:01.506 A:middle
Nature and all the wonderful
wildlife that is part

00:44:58.046 --> 00:45:01.506 A:middle
Nature and all the wonderful
wildlife that is part

00:45:01.506 --> 00:45:08.256 A:middle
of it is powerful and resilient
and it will respond and rebound

00:45:08.496 --> 00:45:09.506 A:middle
if given half a chance.

00:45:10.996 --> 00:45:17.226 A:middle
Technology can help do that,
as can all of us in this room

00:45:17.326 --> 00:45:19.936 A:middle
when we share ideas
and work together.

00:45:21.356 --> 00:45:23.876 A:middle
And we at WWF look
forward to that.

00:45:25.176 --> 00:45:25.566 A:middle
Thank you.
