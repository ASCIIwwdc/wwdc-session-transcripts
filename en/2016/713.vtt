00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:29.786 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.595 A:middle
A very good afternoon
and welcome.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:34.546 A:middle
My name is Bharath Rao.

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:36.726 A:middle
I'm an engineer with
the Core Motion Team,

00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:39.416 A:middle
and today I'm really
excited to be talking to you

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.536 A:middle
about health and fitness.

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:45.446 A:middle
In this talk, I'll be showing
you how you can use Core Motion

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:49.646 A:middle
framework to add some
interesting and engaging health

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:53.166 A:middle
and fitness features
into your apps.

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.816 A:middle
Before we get started, for
those of you who are new

00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:58.036 A:middle
to Core Motion, I'd like
to remind you to go check

00:00:58.036 --> 00:00:59.606 A:middle
out some of our past sessions.

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.716 A:middle
They have some excellent
information

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.716 A:middle
They have some excellent
information

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:06.356 A:middle
about how sensors work, and
how we use, in Core Motion,

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:08.666 A:middle
those sensors to provide APIs

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:13.866 A:middle
that help your apps
observe stats and activity

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.166 A:middle
and Device Motion,
and a whole lot more.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:17.306 A:middle
Go check them out.

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:20.806 A:middle
So with that, let's get started.

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:23.346 A:middle
Here's what we have in
store for you today.

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:26.266 A:middle
I have an update to the
Historical Accelerometer

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.546 A:middle
that I would like
to share with you.

00:01:29.206 --> 00:01:31.656 A:middle
We have a new pedometer
events API,

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:34.326 A:middle
both for the iPhone
and the Apple Watch.

00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:38.926 A:middle
And finally, we are also
bringing the Device Motion APIs

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.456 A:middle
to Apple Watch, with watchOS 3.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:45.226 A:middle
Thank you.

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:51.296 A:middle
First up is Historical
Accelerometer.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.756 A:middle
Last year, we introduced
the CM Sensor Recorder API.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.156 A:middle
With this API, now
your apps have access

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.156 A:middle
With this API, now
your apps have access

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:04.746 A:middle
to raw accelerometer samples,
or long durations of time.

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:09.106 A:middle
And you can also get this
access with very low power.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.356 A:middle
After your apps have
requested the framework

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:14.166 A:middle
to start recording these
samples, they can get suspended.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.756 A:middle
And the OS will offer
those samples,

00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:18.286 A:middle
even across device sleeps.

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:21.466 A:middle
And when your app is ready to
consume them, it can launch

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:24.386 A:middle
and make a query,
and get access to all

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:26.206 A:middle
of those buffered samples.

00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:32.356 A:middle
In watchOS 3, we have a
couple of important updates.

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:34.856 A:middle
First of which is
the greater duration.

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:40.136 A:middle
Now, your apps have a 36-hour
window in which they can launch

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.596 A:middle
and get access to all
of that Historical

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:43.946 A:middle
Accelerometer samples.

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:48.276 A:middle
The second update should not
come as a surprise to you,

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:51.626 A:middle
this is one of the most
requested updates for this API.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:54.576 A:middle
So I'm happy to announce
that in watchOS 3,

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:57.786 A:middle
now the sample delay is
as little as 3 seconds.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:03.516 A:middle
With these updates, now you
can use Sensor Recorder,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.526 A:middle
not only to observe user
activity, or at long durations,

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:10.016 A:middle
but there are some
real time applications

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
for which you can use the
sensor recorder now maybe

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:18.596 A:middle
to track sports activities or
to record workouts at the gym

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:20.126 A:middle
or even health diagnosis.

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:23.096 A:middle
Imagine an app on
the Apple Watch

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:24.676 A:middle
that can detect hand tremors.

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:28.406 A:middle
So now, whenever the user
experiences some hand tremors,

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:29.806 A:middle
they can launch the app.

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:31.856 A:middle
Your app will be
able to pull all

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:35.236 A:middle
of the historical accelerometer
samples, do some analysis

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:41.076 A:middle
on them and get a report that
says how severe that tremor was,

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:44.366 A:middle
and what kind of tremor it
was and share it with the user

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:46.546 A:middle
and maybe even with the
physician with consent,

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.106 A:middle
so that it can speed
up the diagnosis

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:51.516 A:middle
and the treatment
of such conditions.

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.696 A:middle
So that was a great update

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.236 A:middle
to Historical Accelerometer
in watchOS 3.

00:03:57.856 --> 00:03:59.846 A:middle
Next up is pedometer.

00:04:06.156 --> 00:04:08.966 A:middle
CMPedometer is a versatile API.

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:13.986 A:middle
It records stats and
distance, and flights of stairs

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:16.245 A:middle
that the users climb
throughout the day.

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:19.666 A:middle
So you could use it to build
an all-day activity tracker

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:23.016 A:middle
where you set some interesting
goals for your users to achieve.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.946 A:middle
And that way you
can motivate them

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:26.356 A:middle
to lead a healthier lifestyle.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:31.376 A:middle
But where CMPedometer
is really powerful is

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.026 A:middle
in the context of workouts.

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.586 A:middle
Take for example,
the pace metric.

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.276 A:middle
We have stride estimation
algorithms that are running both

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.706 A:middle
on the iPhone and Apple
Watch and using those,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:45.716 A:middle
we are able to provide
really accurate pace

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:47.176 A:middle
and distance metrics, even

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
when the phone doesn't
have a GPS signal.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.286 A:middle
Or when you go run
with your Apple Watch,

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:53.756 A:middle
and you leave the phone
behind, even then,

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:55.926 A:middle
the users get very
accurate metrics.

00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
The pedometer events API that
we are adding today is actually

00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
The pedometer events API that
we are adding today is actually

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:05.376 A:middle
going to help you make those
workout experiences even more

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:06.956 A:middle
engaging and accurate.

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:13.596 A:middle
Let's consider a typical
running workout; an urban run.

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:16.726 A:middle
As third packet [inaudible],
one of the challenges

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:19.586 A:middle
that you'll face with this
scenario is how do you detect

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:22.336 A:middle
all those starts and stops
that the users experience

00:05:22.336 --> 00:05:24.896 A:middle
at intersections while
they're running in a city?

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:27.856 A:middle
So the user comes to a
stop at the stoplight,

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:32.186 A:middle
and your app will continue to
accumulate all of that time

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.326 A:middle
that they're just
standing around.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.576 A:middle
So by the time they get
to the end of their run,

00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:39.066 A:middle
now you have accumulated
enough time, and you --

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:42.286 A:middle
if you try to compute
their average pace

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:45.046 A:middle
over their entire run, you'll
probably end up with something

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:47.496 A:middle
that will resemble
that of their granddad.

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:53.476 A:middle
Or maybe granddad's gone faster
than them, so never mind.

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:56.306 A:middle
So what I mean to say is,

00:05:56.306 --> 00:05:59.116 A:middle
you'll end up with
really inaccurate pace,

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:01.596 A:middle
which is probably much lower
than their running pace.

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:01.596 A:middle
which is probably much lower
than their running pace.

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:06.946 A:middle
So one probable solution is you
could provide a manual pause

00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:07.786 A:middle
and resume option.

00:06:08.366 --> 00:06:11.936 A:middle
But now, once they have paused,
they will also have to remember

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:14.126 A:middle
to resume the workout
when they start running.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.006 A:middle
And if they don't, now all

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.846 A:middle
of the running they do
while their app is paused,

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:21.646 A:middle
is going to be not recorded
towards their workout.

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:25.816 A:middle
So if they forget to pause,
then they get inaccurate pace.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:29.396 A:middle
If they forget to resume,
they lose out on distance.

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:35.706 A:middle
So clearly, you need some auto
pause and resume detection

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:38.846 A:middle
that is not only accurate, but
it also has to be responsive.

00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:41.456 A:middle
It has to feel like your
app is doing a good job

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:44.436 A:middle
of detecting those
starts and stops.

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:47.466 A:middle
At this point, you
might be wondering,

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:49.126 A:middle
why not just use GPS and steps.

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:51.666 A:middle
After all, you have access
to those in your apps.

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:55.566 A:middle
If you have ever used GPS
before, you know that you have

00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:57.626 A:middle
to do a considerable
amount of filtering on it,

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.226 A:middle
so that you can remove
all the noise.

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:02.736 A:middle
Which means that it is going
to be again, slow to respond.

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:02.736 A:middle
Which means that it is going
to be again, slow to respond.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:06.556 A:middle
And with the steps that you
receive from CMpedometer,

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:07.626 A:middle
it has a built in delay.

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:11.306 A:middle
And we do that because we
want to avoid false positives.

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:13.866 A:middle
We use steps to estimate stride.

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:16.426 A:middle
And from that we compute
distance and pace.

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:18.186 A:middle
So it's very important for us

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:22.666 A:middle
to have accurate step
counts at the first step.

00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:28.626 A:middle
So in this release, we are
giving you pedometer events

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.836 A:middle
that is going to help you
detect those starts and stops,

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:35.126 A:middle
not only with good accuracy,
but with low latency.

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:39.466 A:middle
Our pedometer events
solution, or the auto-pause

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:42.496 A:middle
and resume solution uses
a predictive algorithm.

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:45.546 A:middle
This predictive algorithm
was trained on user data

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:48.086 A:middle
so that we can improve
the likelihood estimate

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:49.766 A:middle
of whether the user is moving,

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.046 A:middle
or have they come
to a complete stop?

00:07:52.576 --> 00:07:54.496 A:middle
Of course, all in a
pedestrian context.

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:59.216 A:middle
By doing this, now we are able
to recover most of the delay

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:01.976 A:middle
that is associated with the
step counting algorithm.

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:01.976 A:middle
that is associated with the
step counting algorithm.

00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:05.226 A:middle
But we are able to do so
with pretty good accuracy.

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:09.026 A:middle
I would also like to point out,

00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:11.756 A:middle
because the predictive
algorithm keeps track

00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:15.096 A:middle
of whether the user is moving,
or if they have come to a stop,

00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:17.686 A:middle
we can also support walk base.

00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:21.026 A:middle
So when you are -- when
the user comes to a stop,

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:24.816 A:middle
whether from a walk or a run,
you'll get a pause event.

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:27.886 A:middle
And as soon as the user
starts to run or walk,

00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:30.356 A:middle
you'll get a resume
event within your app.

00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:35.196 A:middle
Pedometer Events API,
they look identical both

00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:37.006 A:middle
on iOS X and watchOS 3.

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:42.876 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the API itself.

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:44.616 A:middle
You have the pause
and resume events.

00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:47.546 A:middle
Each event is timestamped
with the exact time

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.256 A:middle
when the algorithm detected
the transition from moving

00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:52.526 A:middle
to not moving state,
and vice versa.

00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:57.566 A:middle
And you had to start and stop a
pace to help your app register

00:08:57.566 --> 00:08:59.016 A:middle
and deregister for these events.

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:06.936 A:middle
I've been talking about how
pedometer events can be used

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:10.806 A:middle
to clearly demarcate just
the running segments during a

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:14.466 A:middle
complete running workout
and how you can, using that,

00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:15.946 A:middle
derive accurate metrics.

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:19.026 A:middle
But you can also
use pedometer events

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.036 A:middle
in some other interesting ways.

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.866 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:26.676 A:middle
This is a trail-running
app on the iPhone.

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:29.796 A:middle
So here we are going to use
pedometer events to see --

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:34.176 A:middle
to figure out when we can engage
with the user, and when we do,

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:35.646 A:middle
how we can present them

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.116 A:middle
with some interesting
information that's going

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:41.346 A:middle
to make them respond
to those more actively.

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:44.146 A:middle
And because this is
a trail-running app,

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:46.156 A:middle
there is going to be an
elevation change throughout the

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:47.406 A:middle
run so we are going to see

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
if there is some
meaningful information there.

00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:57.206 A:middle
We are going to use the
CMpedometer class to register

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:58.686 A:middle
for the pause and resume events.

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:01.306 A:middle
And we are going to get the
relative altitude updates

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:01.306 A:middle
And we are going to get the
relative altitude updates

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:04.846 A:middle
or the elevation changes
using the CMAltimeter class.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:09.386 A:middle
If you want to continue to
receive pedometer events

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:11.676 A:middle
within your app, even
when the screen turns off,

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:13.516 A:middle
your app has to stay running.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:17.846 A:middle
And one way of doing that on
the iPhone is to subscribe

00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:19.926 A:middle
to continuous background
location.

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:22.196 A:middle
If you are interested in
knowing more about this,

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:24.076 A:middle
I suggest that you go check

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.266 A:middle
out the Core Location
Best Practices session

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.456 A:middle
that is happening at WWDC today.

00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:31.496 A:middle
Next, we are going to register

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:33.346 A:middle
for the relative
altitude updates first

00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:35.166 A:middle
availability check.

00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:37.686 A:middle
And then we provide
an operations queue,

00:10:37.686 --> 00:10:39.636 A:middle
and provide a callback handler

00:10:39.736 --> 00:10:41.146 A:middle
to start receiving
those updates.

00:10:41.936 --> 00:10:45.376 A:middle
In this example, I'm
just going to make a note

00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:46.826 A:middle
of the most recent update.

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:50.706 A:middle
But potentially in your app, you
can cache all of those updates.

00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
And at the end of the workout
you can potentially provide a

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:56.756 A:middle
nice elevation profile
for the entire run.

00:10:59.146 --> 00:11:01.846 A:middle
Next, we'll register for the
pedometer events themselves.

00:10:59.146 --> 00:11:01.846 A:middle
Next, we'll register for the
pedometer events themselves.

00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:03.936 A:middle
So first an availability check.

00:11:03.936 --> 00:11:06.966 A:middle
And then register by
providing a callback handler.

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:12.006 A:middle
This is just a quick tip to
make sure that I don't run

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:15.036 A:middle
into any concurrence issues,
I'm doing work from all

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:17.046 A:middle
of the handlers on the
same operations queue.

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:23.206 A:middle
So now that the app is
set up to exactly figure

00:11:23.206 --> 00:11:24.986 A:middle
out when the user
has started running,

00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:26.396 A:middle
and when they have
stopped running.

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:29.516 A:middle
We are ready to see
if they can use

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.126 A:middle
that in a very contextual
manner.

00:11:31.856 --> 00:11:33.726 A:middle
As soon as they start
running, we are going

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.246 A:middle
to get the resume
event in the app.

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:40.496 A:middle
At this time you could make
a note of that exact time

00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:42.966 A:middle
when we got the resume
event, so that way at the end

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:45.756 A:middle
of the workout, you can
basically add up all

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:46.986 A:middle
of those running times

00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:51.366 A:middle
to compute very accurate
average pace for the entire run.

00:11:51.936 --> 00:11:53.916 A:middle
In this example, I'm
just going to make a note

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:56.866 A:middle
of the most recent
elevation update,

00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:59.516 A:middle
so that I know exactly
what elevation they started

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.366 A:middle
when they started running.

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.366 A:middle
when they started running.

00:12:01.806 --> 00:12:03.626 A:middle
And when the user
comes to a stop,

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:05.736 A:middle
now this is a very
good opportunity for us

00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:08.496 A:middle
to figure out, because we
have elevation, we can figure

00:12:08.496 --> 00:12:09.966 A:middle
out if they have run up a hill.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:11.896 A:middle
And if they have done so,

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:13.766 A:middle
this might be their
first ever hill run.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.536 A:middle
So why not just give them
a hill bagging achievement.

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:20.186 A:middle
Or if they have been doing that
same hill run multiple times,

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:24.366 A:middle
because we have exact, accurate
timings for each of those runs,

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:27.516 A:middle
now we can compare those
and give them a stat

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:29.706 A:middle
of how well they are doing
on that particular hill run.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:35.166 A:middle
So that was an example where we
use pedometer events not only

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:37.526 A:middle
to arrive as very
accurate metrics

00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:39.156 A:middle
and demarcate those
running segments.

00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:42.686 A:middle
But it's also an example
where you could use --

00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:44.956 A:middle
do something interesting
with those events.

00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:49.306 A:middle
At the end of the run, of
course you go ahead and pay

00:12:49.306 --> 00:12:53.036 A:middle
down the registrations and this
will also release any block

00:12:53.036 --> 00:12:55.046 A:middle
handlers that have been
captured in the framework.

00:12:56.856 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
Pedometer events are available
on iPhone 6s and later iPhones,

00:12:56.856 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
Pedometer events are available
on iPhone 6s and later iPhones,

00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
and of course the Apple Watch.

00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:07.226 A:middle
So that's pedometer in
iOS X and watchOS 3.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.156 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about Device Motion.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:16.016 A:middle
As you're all aware,
Device Motion APIs have been

00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:18.076 A:middle
on the iPhone since iOS 5.

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:22.086 A:middle
With watchOS 3, now we are
bringing the exact same APIs

00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:23.716 A:middle
to the Apple Watch.

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:30.036 A:middle
With the Apple Watch, we have
a very capable sensor package

00:13:30.036 --> 00:13:32.436 A:middle
that is at a fixed
location on our wrist

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.316 A:middle
and we use it throughout
the day.

00:13:34.716 --> 00:13:37.616 A:middle
And because we use our
hands for almost everything

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:41.036 A:middle
that we do throughout the day,
it's a really powerful tool

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:42.946 A:middle
to observe all of
that user activity.

00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:46.806 A:middle
And what Device Motion does
is it takes the samples

00:13:46.806 --> 00:13:49.726 A:middle
from the accelerometer and
the gyroscope, and it fuses it

00:13:50.136 --> 00:13:53.326 A:middle
to give you a very clear picture
of all of that user activity,

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:55.466 A:middle
and all of this right
on your wrist.

00:13:57.166 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
All of that motion at wrist
is described by Device Motion,

00:13:57.166 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
All of that motion at wrist
is described by Device Motion,

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:04.386 A:middle
using four distinct
properties: Attitude, gravity,

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:07.426 A:middle
rotation rate, and
user acceleration.

00:14:09.686 --> 00:14:14.206 A:middle
If you want to know in depth how
these properties are derived,

00:14:14.206 --> 00:14:16.746 A:middle
and how they behave, I
encourage you to go check

00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:20.326 A:middle
out these sessions
from 2011 and 2012.

00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:23.846 A:middle
In this talk though, I'll be
giving you a very brief overview

00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:27.176 A:middle
of this property so that we can
build some infusion and go look

00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:31.086 A:middle
at some examples of how you
can apply them in some health

00:14:31.086 --> 00:14:33.166 A:middle
and fitness apps in
interesting ways.

00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:36.326 A:middle
The first property is attitude.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:42.266 A:middle
Using attitude in your apps,
you can get an observation

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.616 A:middle
of the orientation
of device and space.

00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:46.916 A:middle
And when you use CMDeviceMotion,

00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:49.726 A:middle
you get these three
representations of attitude.

00:14:50.496 --> 00:14:54.426 A:middle
As Quaternion, rotation
matrix, and as Euler angles.

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:57.786 A:middle
Whenever you are using
attitude within your app,

00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:01.726 A:middle
one thing to note is every
single attitude observation is

00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:01.726 A:middle
one thing to note is every
single attitude observation is

00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:04.776 A:middle
going to be relative to
a fixed reference frame.

00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:10.176 A:middle
What this means is every single
orientation observation is going

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.686 A:middle
to be observed from a point

00:15:11.686 --> 00:15:13.536 A:middle
that is not fixed to
the device itself.

00:15:13.536 --> 00:15:17.036 A:middle
So the reference frame remains
static while the device can move

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:19.396 A:middle
around, and that's
how you observe

00:15:19.396 --> 00:15:20.926 A:middle
orientation-using attitude.

00:15:22.516 --> 00:15:26.196 A:middle
And furthermore, when
your app registers

00:15:26.286 --> 00:15:27.806 A:middle
to start receiving the updates,

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:30.916 A:middle
that is when the
reference frame is set.

00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:33.396 A:middle
And so every subsequent
sample that you receive

00:15:33.396 --> 00:15:36.286 A:middle
within your app is going
to be computed using

00:15:36.576 --> 00:15:39.046 A:middle
that relative reference
frame that was set

00:15:39.046 --> 00:15:40.426 A:middle
at the start of updates.

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle
So this is something that
you need to kind of be aware

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
of when you use attitude
in your apps.

00:15:46.586 --> 00:15:48.906 A:middle
And so that you don't
make assumptions

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:52.476 A:middle
about where the device is
oriented in absolute space.

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:56.006 A:middle
The next property is gravity.

00:15:57.376 --> 00:16:00.586 A:middle
Gravity is -- well,
it's gravity.

00:15:57.376 --> 00:16:00.586 A:middle
Gravity is -- well,
it's gravity.

00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:02.356 A:middle
It is the force that
is pulling us all

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:04.426 A:middle
down to the center of the Earth.

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:06.716 A:middle
And within Device
Motion, it is represented

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.646 A:middle
as a unit vector in
the device frame.

00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:13.366 A:middle
Using gravity, you
can observe the tip

00:16:14.116 --> 00:16:15.726 A:middle
and the tilt of the device.

00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:18.016 A:middle
But you might be wondering,

00:16:18.016 --> 00:16:20.716 A:middle
isn't different tilt also the
orientation just like attitude?

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:24.206 A:middle
But one key difference is,
now you're observing all

00:16:24.206 --> 00:16:26.776 A:middle
of this orientation
from the device frame.

00:16:27.116 --> 00:16:29.026 A:middle
So take for example, if I were

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:31.376 A:middle
to hold my hand perfectly
parallel to the ground

00:16:31.376 --> 00:16:35.466 A:middle
to my side, and then I move it
to my front, you won't be able

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.746 A:middle
to observe this using gravity.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
Because the x, y, z
components of gravity are going

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:42.056 A:middle
to remain exactly same
between these two orientations.

00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:45.456 A:middle
To observe something like this,
you need a point of observation

00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:49.326 A:middle
that is external or fixed
while the device is moving.

00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:50.526 A:middle
Which is basically attitude.

00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:53.806 A:middle
So you could use gravity
to observe orientation,

00:16:53.806 --> 00:16:55.706 A:middle
but only in a limited form.

00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:59.036 A:middle
But it might work just
good for the kind of app

00:16:59.036 --> 00:17:01.406 A:middle
that you are thinking of.

00:16:59.036 --> 00:17:01.406 A:middle
that you are thinking of.

00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:03.526 A:middle
One other thing about gravity is

00:17:03.526 --> 00:17:05.816 A:middle
when you hold the
device perfectly still,

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.965 A:middle
you can observe it
using the accelerometer.

00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:09.566 A:middle
It's a constant acceleration

00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:11.036 A:middle
that the accelerometer
will pick up,

00:17:11.496 --> 00:17:14.445 A:middle
and you can read it right
out of accelerometer.

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:17.876 A:middle
But as soon as you
start moving the device,

00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:19.336 A:middle
now the accelerometer is picking

00:17:19.336 --> 00:17:21.806 A:middle
up not just the gravity
component, but it's also picking

00:17:21.806 --> 00:17:24.195 A:middle
up all of the user-generated
motion.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.126 A:middle
So it becomes harder and harder

00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:27.896 A:middle
to just get the gravity
component.

00:17:28.556 --> 00:17:31.616 A:middle
What Device Motion does, is
by using sense of fusion,

00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:33.366 A:middle
we switch over to the gyroscope

00:17:33.526 --> 00:17:40.276 A:middle
to start tracking the
gravity unit vector.

00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:42.826 A:middle
Next property is rotation rate.

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:45.376 A:middle
As the name suggests,
it's the rate

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:47.146 A:middle
of change of angular motion.

00:17:47.656 --> 00:17:50.636 A:middle
It's very good for observing
something like wrist rotation.

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.396 A:middle
When you are rotating
your wrist,

00:17:52.396 --> 00:17:55.196 A:middle
there is a rotational motion
around the x-axis of the device,

00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:57.556 A:middle
and you can observe that
using rotation rate.

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
You can also observe any
rotation around the body.

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
You can also observe any
rotation around the body.

00:18:01.436 --> 00:18:05.566 A:middle
Because most of us, we fix
our torso and we move our arms

00:18:05.696 --> 00:18:08.876 A:middle
so there is going to be some
kind of an arcing motion.

00:18:08.876 --> 00:18:13.016 A:middle
So there is rotation and you can
observe it using the rotation

00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:14.646 A:middle
rate property of Device Motion.

00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:19.966 A:middle
The last of the properties
is user acceleration.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.406 A:middle
And the user acceleration
that you get

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:24.706 A:middle
through Device Motion is
compensated for gravity.

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:28.026 A:middle
Recall how I mentioned
that accelerometer picks

00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:29.416 A:middle
up both the gravity component

00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:30.906 A:middle
and the user-generated
component.

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.206 A:middle
So this is just the
user-generated component.

00:18:33.676 --> 00:18:35.936 A:middle
But it has been compensated
with gravity

00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:39.566 A:middle
that was derived using
device sensor fusion.

00:18:40.776 --> 00:18:44.416 A:middle
So that was a very quick
overview of these properties.

00:18:44.696 --> 00:18:46.866 A:middle
Now let's take a look
at a few examples

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.786 A:middle
of how you can use
them in your apps.

00:18:50.536 --> 00:18:52.786 A:middle
The first property is attitude.

00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:55.116 A:middle
Attitude is very good

00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:57.686 A:middle
for observing any kind
of repetitive motion.

00:18:57.916 --> 00:18:59.536 A:middle
Like rep counting
in weightlifting.

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:03.536 A:middle
So when you are lifting
weights, you are literally going

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:03.536 A:middle
So when you are lifting
weights, you are literally going

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:05.626 A:middle
through a set of
orientation changes.

00:19:05.756 --> 00:19:09.996 A:middle
So just by looking at how
those orientation changes are

00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:12.006 A:middle
repeating, you can
count the reps.

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:14.336 A:middle
And the best part about
using attitude for doing

00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:16.656 A:middle
that is now they might
be using a machine

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.846 A:middle
where they're pulling
horizontally or from the top

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:22.576 A:middle
and you can observe all of
those reps using attitude.

00:19:24.636 --> 00:19:26.746 A:middle
Gravity, as I already
mentioned, it's very good

00:19:26.746 --> 00:19:28.326 A:middle
for measuring tip and tilt.

00:19:28.856 --> 00:19:31.646 A:middle
Which basically means you
can use it in a yoga app.

00:19:32.436 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
So if they're doing a downward
dog or holding a warrior pose,

00:19:37.806 --> 00:19:40.706 A:middle
then you can figure out whether
-- how still they're holding it.

00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:43.906 A:middle
And when they're also going
from one pose to another,

00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:46.506 A:middle
you can figure out whether
they're really doing it

00:19:46.506 --> 00:19:48.986 A:middle
in a graceful way, or just
falling over themselves.

00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:57.266 A:middle
One of the most useful ways
of using rotation rate is

00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:59.566 A:middle
to observe the speed
of circular motion.

00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.946 A:middle
Take, for example,
a batting cage.

00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.946 A:middle
Take, for example,
a batting cage.

00:20:01.986 --> 00:20:04.056 A:middle
So when you are swinging
the bat,

00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:06.856 A:middle
you're not only rotating
your arms around your body,

00:20:06.856 --> 00:20:08.766 A:middle
but there is also the
rotation around wrist.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:12.166 A:middle
So you could use both of those
components of rotation rate

00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:13.876 A:middle
to estimate the bat speed.

00:20:14.206 --> 00:20:17.076 A:middle
Of course you'll need to
know how long of a bat it is,

00:20:17.076 --> 00:20:19.806 A:middle
and at what point on the bat
you want to measure the speed.

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.686 A:middle
User acceleration is best used

00:20:24.686 --> 00:20:26.316 A:middle
when there is some
abrupt motion.

00:20:26.716 --> 00:20:30.046 A:middle
Because accelerometer
picks up all of the motion

00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:33.946 A:middle
that the user is doing, if
you try to do some kind of app

00:20:33.996 --> 00:20:35.556 A:middle
where you're using
user acceleration

00:20:35.556 --> 00:20:36.966 A:middle
to measure some small movements,

00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
it might get drowned
out by noise.

00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:42.706 A:middle
So wherever there is a very
abrupt motion is the best place

00:20:42.736 --> 00:20:44.096 A:middle
to use user acceleration.

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.186 A:middle
So something like
a punch and recoil.

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:49.646 A:middle
You can tell how much
pain they're inflicting

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:52.716 A:middle
on that sandbag,
or that opponent

00:20:52.716 --> 00:20:54.176 A:middle
that is hopefully
made out of air.

00:20:56.476 --> 00:20:59.936 A:middle
So those were only a
very few set of examples

00:20:59.936 --> 00:21:02.526 A:middle
of how you can use Device
Motion within your apps.

00:20:59.936 --> 00:21:02.526 A:middle
of how you can use Device
Motion within your apps.

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.816 A:middle
By -- after going through this,

00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:06.736 A:middle
if you feel that
you have an app idea

00:21:06.736 --> 00:21:09.386 A:middle
that could use Device Motion
and you want to find out more

00:21:09.386 --> 00:21:12.366 A:middle
about how you can apply
Device Motion, please do stop

00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:14.546 A:middle
by our lab tomorrow,
and we would be more

00:21:14.546 --> 00:21:16.496 A:middle
than happy to help you.

00:21:16.496 --> 00:21:20.406 A:middle
Now let's take a look
at that API itself.

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:21.606 A:middle
You have the four properties.

00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:24.146 A:middle
Attitude and gravity,
they're unitlness.

00:21:24.146 --> 00:21:25.246 A:middle
Gravity's the uniflector.

00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:29.456 A:middle
User acceleration is in
G's and rotation rate is

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.686 A:middle
in radians per second.

00:21:32.656 --> 00:21:35.626 A:middle
Before you can start
receiving Device Motion updates

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:38.226 A:middle
within your app, you have
to set their sample rate.

00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:41.296 A:middle
You can set sample
rates up to 100 hertz.

00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:44.266 A:middle
And once you have set that
sample rate, you can go ahead

00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:47.526 A:middle
and register for updates
using the startup date method.

00:21:48.786 --> 00:21:51.286 A:middle
From this point onwards,
you can either choose

00:21:51.286 --> 00:21:53.626 A:middle
to poll the Device Motion
property periodically

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:55.466 A:middle
to receive the most
recent sample.

00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:58.106 A:middle
Or you could provide
a callback handler

00:21:58.106 --> 00:22:01.186 A:middle
on which you can get every
single update the Device Motion

00:21:58.106 --> 00:22:01.186 A:middle
on which you can get every
single update the Device Motion

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.206 A:middle
is generating for you.

00:22:03.676 --> 00:22:06.486 A:middle
And of course, once you
are done with the --

00:22:06.486 --> 00:22:08.696 A:middle
listening to the Device Motion
updates, you can go ahead

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:11.956 A:middle
and deregister using the
stopDeviceMotionUpdates.

00:22:12.296 --> 00:22:15.916 A:middle
That brings me to the end
of my section of the talk.

00:22:16.146 --> 00:22:18.956 A:middle
Now I'll be handing it forward
to Paul, who will be walking you

00:22:18.956 --> 00:22:21.706 A:middle
through an example
app on the Apple Watch

00:22:21.836 --> 00:22:24.166 A:middle
that uses Device Motion
in an interesting manner.

00:22:24.906 --> 00:22:25.456 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:25.976 A:middle
Over to you Paul.

00:22:26.516 --> 00:22:33.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:34.046 --> 00:22:36.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Bharath.

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:36.736 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:22:37.696 --> 00:22:38.696 A:middle
My name is Paul Thompson,

00:22:38.976 --> 00:22:40.076 A:middle
and I'm an engineer
with Core Motion.

00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:42.816 A:middle
So Bharath just talked
about what's new

00:22:42.816 --> 00:22:43.956 A:middle
with Core Motion APIs.

00:22:44.556 --> 00:22:47.376 A:middle
What I'd like to do is show
you how to use one of them

00:22:47.376 --> 00:22:50.166 A:middle
in an Apple Watch fitness app.

00:22:50.446 --> 00:22:52.136 A:middle
So in this app, what we'd

00:22:52.136 --> 00:22:54.126 A:middle
like to do is create a
tennis workout session.

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.086 A:middle
Then we'll do -- we'll subscribe

00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:58.026 A:middle
to sensor updates
with Device Motion.

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:02.266 A:middle
Finally, we'll detect
swings and differentiate

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:02.266 A:middle
Finally, we'll detect
swings and differentiate

00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:04.146 A:middle
between a forehand
and a backhand swing.

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:09.136 A:middle
Now to do this, what we'll need
to do is leverage capabilities

00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:10.936 A:middle
from Core Motion, as well

00:23:10.936 --> 00:23:14.526 A:middle
as some new capabilities
from HealthKit.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
Now as you may remember,
watchOS 2 apps strongly relied

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:21.286 A:middle
on HealthKit and Core Motion
to do real-time analysis

00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:23.576 A:middle
and sensor output and
provide you with values

00:23:23.576 --> 00:23:29.056 A:middle
such as step count, flights,
distance, and calorie estimates.

00:23:29.056 --> 00:23:32.736 A:middle
Now, during a workout session,
your app can do limited work

00:23:33.466 --> 00:23:36.696 A:middle
and process Device Motion
samples while the user's not

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:38.286 A:middle
directly engaged in your app.

00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:43.276 A:middle
But of course, this ability
comes with some caveats.

00:23:44.446 --> 00:23:47.106 A:middle
To begin with, you must have
enabled this new HealthKit

00:23:47.106 --> 00:23:48.916 A:middle
entitlement in your
Xcode project.

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:54.376 A:middle
Further, this background work
can only be done during an

00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:55.336 A:middle
active workout session.

00:23:55.796 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
And in addition,
while backgrounded,

00:23:55.796 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
And in addition,
while backgrounded,

00:24:00.766 --> 00:24:03.056 A:middle
you must minimize
your CPU usage.

00:24:04.106 --> 00:24:05.806 A:middle
If you do not minimize
your CPU usage,

00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:07.196 A:middle
your app will be suspended

00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:13.176 A:middle
until the user explicitly
foregrounds it again.

00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:15.346 A:middle
Now since this background
capability is being provided

00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:18.286 A:middle
by HealthKit, I encourage you
to view the earlier session

00:24:18.286 --> 00:24:22.056 A:middle
to learn more in
detail about this.

00:24:22.276 --> 00:24:24.026 A:middle
With that in mind, let's think

00:24:24.026 --> 00:24:25.096 A:middle
about what our app
might look like.

00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:29.576 A:middle
Well with app, you would
expect you and a friend to out

00:24:29.576 --> 00:24:31.206 A:middle
to the tennis courts
with your Apple Watches,

00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:32.626 A:middle
and practicing volleying
for a bit.

00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:35.526 A:middle
There, you simply
start a quick workout,

00:24:35.956 --> 00:24:37.806 A:middle
and hit the ball back and forth.

00:24:39.356 --> 00:24:43.156 A:middle
Then, you'd expect that at any
time you take a quick glance

00:24:43.156 --> 00:24:44.976 A:middle
at your watch, and get some
media feedback on the play.

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:54.126 A:middle
So with that in mind,

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.146 A:middle
let's think about the
structure of our project.

00:24:57.126 --> 00:24:59.226 A:middle
Here, there'll be three layers
that we want to care about.

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:03.146 A:middle
First is the UI, where
we'll ultimately present

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:03.146 A:middle
First is the UI, where
we'll ultimately present

00:25:03.146 --> 00:25:05.536 A:middle
to the user what we've done.

00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:07.966 A:middle
Then, we'll have
our workout manager.

00:25:08.826 --> 00:25:11.836 A:middle
We'll interact with
HealthKit and start

00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
and stop our workout sessions

00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:14.996 A:middle
and enable our background
inability.

00:25:16.936 --> 00:25:19.576 A:middle
Then we'll enable our -- then
we'll have our motion manager.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:23.316 A:middle
Here we'll interact with
Core Motion directly,

00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:25.606 A:middle
and implement our
detection algorithm.

00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:29.576 A:middle
There we'll respond to 50
hertz Device Motion updates,

00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:31.676 A:middle
and add the resulting
samples to a running buffer.

00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:34.716 A:middle
Afterwards, on every update,

00:25:35.346 --> 00:25:37.446 A:middle
we'll assess whether a
swing occurred, and if so,

00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:38.296 A:middle
we'll implement the UI.

00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:45.406 A:middle
So how do we want to -- how
do we want to model the swing

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:46.226 A:middle
that we wish to detect?

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:49.876 A:middle
Well, tennis is a
complicated sport.

00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:52.806 A:middle
So in this case, all
we'll do is we'll look

00:25:52.806 --> 00:25:54.406 A:middle
at the essence of two gestures.

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:56.996 A:middle
A full forehand and
backhand swing.

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:01.366 A:middle
We'll do this using the
gravity and rotation vectors

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:01.366 A:middle
We'll do this using the
gravity and rotation vectors

00:26:01.366 --> 00:26:04.566 A:middle
as provided by Device Motion.

00:26:04.676 --> 00:26:08.196 A:middle
So if you expect the watch
to be in the dominant arm,

00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:10.556 A:middle
then you would expect
a full forehand swing

00:26:10.556 --> 00:26:14.356 A:middle
to include a simple
rotation about the user.

00:26:14.356 --> 00:26:18.066 A:middle
So if we take the dot
product of the rotation rate

00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:20.736 A:middle
from a potential swing with
the gravity unit vector,

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:24.416 A:middle
we can isolate this movement
while ignoring the attitude

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.076 A:middle
of the device.

00:26:25.696 --> 00:26:27.556 A:middle
And also ignoring some
extraneous movement.

00:26:29.496 --> 00:26:33.906 A:middle
Then, once we've got
enough samples of this,

00:26:34.316 --> 00:26:35.756 A:middle
we'll see if we've
rotated far enough

00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:37.866 A:middle
and fast enough to
count as a swing.

00:26:37.866 --> 00:26:41.876 A:middle
So now that we know what to do,

00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:44.186 A:middle
let's take a look
at our sample app.

00:26:46.016 --> 00:26:48.656 A:middle
To begin, we'll envision
our simple UI.

00:26:49.186 --> 00:26:54.096 A:middle
We'll display our
information to the user.

00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:56.826 A:middle
Here we'll have three watch kit
interface labels that we'll want

00:26:56.826 --> 00:26:57.826 A:middle
to update during runtime.

00:26:58.906 --> 00:27:00.766 A:middle
These will include
the workout label.

00:26:58.906 --> 00:27:00.766 A:middle
These will include
the workout label.

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.076 A:middle
The forehand count label.

00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:04.986 A:middle
And the backhand count label.

00:27:05.546 --> 00:27:07.946 A:middle
And what the workout label will
do, will simply tell a user

00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:10.306 A:middle
when we've started and
stopped the workout session.

00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:14.346 A:middle
And the forehand and backhand
count labels will simply show

00:27:14.546 --> 00:27:16.826 A:middle
how many times we've
detected the right movement.

00:27:18.076 --> 00:27:20.576 A:middle
Here we'll also have a
force touch menu to start

00:27:20.576 --> 00:27:21.726 A:middle
and stop the workout session.

00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:29.916 A:middle
So now that we know what the
UI will show, let's take a look

00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:30.786 A:middle
at our workout manager.

00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:35.976 A:middle
Here, we'll handle our
interactions with HealthKit,

00:27:35.976 --> 00:27:37.836 A:middle
as well as create
our workout session.

00:27:39.236 --> 00:27:42.266 A:middle
We'll also direct our motion
manager below to start

00:27:42.266 --> 00:27:43.476 A:middle
and stop sensor updates.

00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:50.746 A:middle
So here, in our workout manager,
we'll have to start a workout.

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:55.066 A:middle
So to begin, we'll create
our workout configuration

00:27:55.316 --> 00:27:57.146 A:middle
which we'll use to initiate
the workout session.

00:27:57.686 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
Since we're creating
a tennis app,

00:28:00.356 --> 00:28:01.936 A:middle
let's use tennis as
the activity type.

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:03.766 A:middle
And outdoors as the location.

00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:07.556 A:middle
Then, after initialization,

00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:11.316 A:middle
we'll have HealthKit start the
workout session and subscribe

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:12.426 A:middle
to Device Motion updates.

00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:14.986 A:middle
At this point, we'll now be able

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:16.726 A:middle
to do work while
the screen is off.

00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:22.946 A:middle
In addition, we'll also
need to stop our workout.

00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:27.916 A:middle
Here, we'll simply do the
reverse motion and unsubscribe

00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:30.116 A:middle
from sensor updates,
and then tell HealthKit

00:28:30.116 --> 00:28:31.156 A:middle
to end the workout session.

00:28:31.966 --> 00:28:38.186 A:middle
At this point, normal
backgrounding rules will apply.

00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:40.706 A:middle
So now, let's take a look
at our motion manager.

00:28:41.256 --> 00:28:43.616 A:middle
He will interface with
Core Motion directly,

00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:44.946 A:middle
and implement our
detection algorithm.

00:28:50.076 --> 00:28:54.026 A:middle
So to begin, what we'll do
here is we'll create a link

00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:55.086 A:middle
to the CM motion manager.

00:28:55.616 --> 00:28:58.186 A:middle
As well as create an
NS operation queue for

00:28:58.186 --> 00:28:59.236 A:middle
or samples to do work on.

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:03.136 A:middle
At this point, we'll
also ask if the watch is

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:03.136 A:middle
At this point, we'll
also ask if the watch is

00:29:03.136 --> 00:29:04.716 A:middle
on the left or the right wrist.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.866 A:middle
There's a difference
between the forehand

00:29:06.866 --> 00:29:09.256 A:middle
and the backhand swing
will depend entirely

00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:09.916 A:middle
on this perspective.

00:29:10.246 --> 00:29:15.996 A:middle
We'll also keep a local count of
a forehand and backhand swings,

00:29:16.716 --> 00:29:22.616 A:middle
as well as mark as whether
we've recently seen a swing.

00:29:22.756 --> 00:29:24.666 A:middle
We'll also choose 50
hertz as our sample rate.

00:29:25.276 --> 00:29:26.166 A:middle
And create a running buffer

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:27.786 A:middle
that should hold no more
than a second's data.

00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:31.836 A:middle
Now as Bharath mentioned
earlier,

00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:34.176 A:middle
Device Motion samples
can be provided

00:29:34.176 --> 00:29:35.506 A:middle
at a rate up to 100 hertz.

00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:38.836 A:middle
While you generally want to pick
the sample rate that's as small

00:29:38.836 --> 00:29:40.646 A:middle
as you can get away with,
while also providing you

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:42.326 A:middle
with fidelity that you need.

00:29:44.696 --> 00:29:48.276 A:middle
In addition, we'll set three
constants which we'll use

00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:49.176 A:middle
in our detection algorithm.

00:29:50.216 --> 00:29:52.846 A:middle
These will include the minimum
angle's [inaudible] swing,

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:55.766 A:middle
the lower bound on the peak
speed through the swing,

00:29:56.916 --> 00:29:58.886 A:middle
and an upper bound on the
settling speed of the swing.

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:03.386 A:middle
Now we chose these values
based on experimentation

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:03.386 A:middle
Now we chose these values
based on experimentation

00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:04.576 A:middle
and sample data that
we collected.

00:30:05.526 --> 00:30:08.116 A:middle
But generally, you'll find
that the process of collecting

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
and picking these values will
be half the battle of your app.

00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:15.176 A:middle
Finally, we'll create this
delegate reference here,

00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:20.796 A:middle
which we'll use to
communicate back to the UI.

00:30:20.956 --> 00:30:23.466 A:middle
So now, after we set
all of our properties,

00:30:24.116 --> 00:30:27.136 A:middle
we'll adjust the operation queue
to reflect as a serial queue

00:30:27.566 --> 00:30:29.876 A:middle
that we'll use to handle all
of our Device Motion samples.

00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:33.756 A:middle
I'd like to emphasize
here, that we chose --

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:36.736 A:middle
we created this operation
queue to ensure that all

00:30:36.736 --> 00:30:38.886 A:middle
of our data processing
happens off of the main queue.

00:30:39.496 --> 00:30:44.736 A:middle
So now we'll also create
this function which we'll use

00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:46.296 A:middle
to reset all the
statement class,

00:30:46.716 --> 00:30:50.846 A:middle
as well as zero out the UI.

00:30:50.846 --> 00:30:53.606 A:middle
And then, as a final set
of convenience methods,

00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:56.886 A:middle
we'll create some complementary
update delegate functions.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.276 A:middle
Here, we'll simply implement
our count of the swing,

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.276 A:middle
Here, we'll simply implement
our count of the swing,

00:31:02.156 --> 00:31:03.566 A:middle
mark that we've recently
seen a swing,

00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:05.986 A:middle
and then let the UI know it.

00:31:09.716 --> 00:31:12.546 A:middle
So let's start interfacing
with Core Motion.

00:31:13.986 --> 00:31:17.886 A:middle
So as always, the first thing
we should do is ask whether the

00:31:17.886 --> 00:31:20.316 A:middle
API's supported on the
device we're running on.

00:31:21.496 --> 00:31:25.686 A:middle
Then, we'll tell Core Motion to
update us at a 50 hertz cadence.

00:31:26.376 --> 00:31:30.166 A:middle
And finally, we'll subscribe
to Device Motion updates

00:31:30.686 --> 00:31:33.386 A:middle
by passing our operation
queue, as well as a block

00:31:33.386 --> 00:31:36.296 A:middle
that we'll use to respond to all
incoming Device Motion samples.

00:31:37.686 --> 00:31:40.166 A:middle
All this block will do
is simply check to see

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:43.016 A:middle
if there are any errors with
the update, then pass it along

00:31:43.016 --> 00:31:43.966 A:middle
to our detection function.

00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:50.806 A:middle
So let's take a look at what
our detection function's going

00:31:50.806 --> 00:31:51.736 A:middle
to do.

00:31:52.556 --> 00:31:54.036 A:middle
So as Bharath mentioned earlier,

00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:56.066 A:middle
Device Motion gives
us quite a few things.

00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:59.106 A:middle
But in this example, we're only
going to look at the gravity

00:31:59.236 --> 00:32:00.486 A:middle
and rotation rate vectors.

00:31:59.236 --> 00:32:00.486 A:middle
and rotation rate vectors.

00:32:00.486 --> 00:32:03.256 A:middle
Now, as you may remember,

00:32:03.726 --> 00:32:06.106 A:middle
the gravity vector is simply
Core Motion's destination.

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:07.486 A:middle
The gravity univector,

00:32:07.836 --> 00:32:09.346 A:middle
regardless of how much
the device has moved.

00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:12.896 A:middle
And the rotation rate is
simply a rotation vector

00:32:12.896 --> 00:32:16.766 A:middle
for the device, giving
us radians per second.

00:32:16.876 --> 00:32:21.286 A:middle
So now, what our [inaudible]
will do is we'll take the dot

00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:24.286 A:middle
product -- will take the dot
product of the rotation vector

00:32:24.286 --> 00:32:26.896 A:middle
from a potential swing
with a gravity univector.

00:32:27.606 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
So we only analyzed
the proportion

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:29.896 A:middle
of motion about gravity.

00:32:31.676 --> 00:32:34.336 A:middle
Then, we'll add the
resulting scaler

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:36.746 A:middle
to a running buffer holding
no more than a second's data.

00:32:37.236 --> 00:32:40.726 A:middle
Once we have enough
content, we begin to analyze

00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:44.116 A:middle
in the content within.

00:32:44.256 --> 00:32:46.596 A:middle
So the two metrics we'll use

00:32:46.596 --> 00:32:49.586 A:middle
to analyze the swing are the
accumulated angle of rotation

00:32:50.236 --> 00:32:51.356 A:middle
and the peak speed of the swing.

00:32:51.906 --> 00:32:56.806 A:middle
Here, to get the accumulating
rotation simply integrate all

00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:58.926 A:middle
the accumulated samples that
we've collected from rotation

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:02.326 A:middle
over the second that
we've collected them.

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:02.326 A:middle
over the second that
we've collected them.

00:33:02.326 --> 00:33:05.226 A:middle
Then you have peak rate, you
simply take a min or max,

00:33:05.526 --> 00:33:06.886 A:middle
depending on the
direction of rotation.

00:33:07.336 --> 00:33:12.806 A:middle
Further down our
function, we'll check to see

00:33:13.206 --> 00:33:17.646 A:middle
if we subtended far enough and
fast enough to count as a swing.

00:33:17.826 --> 00:33:21.956 A:middle
If so, we'll choose forehand or
backhand conveying the position

00:33:21.956 --> 00:33:24.196 A:middle
of the Apple Watch and
the sign of the scalers.

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:31.316 A:middle
And finally, to end the
function, we'll add a check

00:33:31.316 --> 00:33:32.436 A:middle
to see that the swing
is settled.

00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:35.476 A:middle
This way we can reject
some of the recoil movement

00:33:35.686 --> 00:33:39.776 A:middle
as the user's arm moves back in
position for the next volley.

00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:42.056 A:middle
And finally, to finish
off the class,

00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:43.956 A:middle
we'll have the stopUpdates
function.

00:33:44.486 --> 00:33:46.936 A:middle
Which we'll use to unsubscribe
from DeviceMotionUpdates

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:48.216 A:middle
when the workout has ended.

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:54.066 A:middle
And that concludes the
basics of our sample app.

00:33:54.416 --> 00:33:56.366 A:middle
We simply described a
simple user interface.

00:33:57.126 --> 00:33:58.746 A:middle
We then created a
workout management.

00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:00.386 A:middle
Handle interfacing
with HealthKit.

00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:00.386 A:middle
Handle interfacing
with HealthKit.

00:34:00.976 --> 00:34:04.456 A:middle
And then we created our motion
manager to handle Core Motion,

00:34:04.456 --> 00:34:06.316 A:middle
as well as implement
our detection algorithm.

00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:10.896 A:middle
So I hope you all have
gotten a good feel for how

00:34:10.896 --> 00:34:13.596 A:middle
to use Device Motion as newly
brought to the Apple Watch.

00:34:17.516 --> 00:34:20.775 A:middle
So before I wrap up, I'd like
to emphasize a few details

00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:21.746 A:middle
on the use of this API.

00:34:22.476 --> 00:34:26.576 A:middle
So now while you may expect
the watch to be in a fixed

00:34:26.576 --> 00:34:29.376 A:middle
and predictable location,
always remember to check

00:34:29.626 --> 00:34:32.726 A:middle
which wrist the device
is on as this difference

00:34:32.726 --> 00:34:35.116 A:middle
of position can have significant
impact on your analysis.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:40.356 A:middle
Further, when using
inertial senses,

00:34:40.666 --> 00:34:41.616 A:middle
always try to remember --

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:44.356 A:middle
try to understand what
the reference frame you're

00:34:44.356 --> 00:34:45.396 A:middle
operating in.

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:50.746 A:middle
And further, as we said earlier,
Device Motion provides you

00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:52.636 A:middle
with samples at a
rate up to 100 hertz.

00:34:53.545 --> 00:34:54.926 A:middle
We always want to
strike a balance

00:34:55.376 --> 00:34:57.656 A:middle
between the resources required
to service your sample rate,

00:34:57.956 --> 00:34:59.986 A:middle
and the fidelity demanded
by your application.

00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:02.216 A:middle
This is especially important,

00:35:02.576 --> 00:35:04.376 A:middle
given the restrictions
placed during backgrounding

00:35:04.446 --> 00:35:05.286 A:middle
of a workout session.

00:35:05.816 --> 00:35:11.676 A:middle
And so to summarize the talk
as a whole, we earlier talked

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:12.966 A:middle
about the performance
improvements

00:35:12.966 --> 00:35:14.136 A:middle
to historical accelerometer.

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:17.746 A:middle
Then we demonstrated how
you can use pedometer events

00:35:18.056 --> 00:35:20.386 A:middle
to precisely tag
segments, provide important,

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:24.146 A:middle
