00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.786 A:middle
Thank for the introduction
Felice.

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:09.876 A:middle
My name is Haben Girma.

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:14.166 A:middle
I work as an accessibility
and inclusion advocate,

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.606 A:middle
teaching organizations
and individuals to design

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.626 A:middle
with accessibility in mind.

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:21.586 A:middle
I'm deaf-blind.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.626 A:middle
Deaf-blindness encompasses
a wide spectrum

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:26.606 A:middle
of vision and hearing loss.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:32.126 A:middle
I have a little bit of hearing,
and a little bit of vision.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.406 A:middle
I see maybe about 1% of what
the average sighted person sees.

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:41.936 A:middle
By identifying as deaf-blind,
I'm telling the world

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.226 A:middle
that I'm part of a community
where knowledge gained

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:51.246 A:middle
through touch is equal in
value to knowledge gained

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:55.616 A:middle
through sight, sound,
or other means.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:59.876 A:middle
Our world is incredibly diverse,
and when we design apps,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.276 A:middle
that celebrate that
diversity, and recognize

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:07.056 A:middle
that diversity, we all benefit.

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:11.006 A:middle
So I identify as
deaf-blind to tell the world

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:16.036 A:middle
to design non-visual access
and non-auditory access

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:20.766 A:middle
to help maximize communication.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:25.606 A:middle
This is tricky for some people.

00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:28.366 A:middle
One of my best friends,
when she first met me,

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.316 A:middle
wasn't sure how to say hi.

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:32.886 A:middle
She was sitting next to me,

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
in one of our classes
at law school.

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:39.206 A:middle
And she waved hi, but
I couldn't see it.

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:46.086 A:middle
And she voice hi, and
I couldn't hear it.

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.306 A:middle
It was our first day of
international law class,

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:53.826 A:middle
and she wasn't thinking
about international law.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:57.686 A:middle
She was thinking about
how to get my attention.

00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:02.406 A:middle
And after a while, during the
class, she came up with a plan.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:02.406 A:middle
And after a while, during the
class, she came up with a plan.

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:05.996 A:middle
She did the most logical
thing for a student.

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:09.986 A:middle
She went onto Facebook and sent
me a message saying Hi, Haben,

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:12.996 A:middle
I'm sitting right next to you.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:17.346 A:middle
Technology has facilitated
access communication

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.756 A:middle
for a lot of people.

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:24.406 A:middle
And when apps are designed
with accessibility in mind,

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:27.926 A:middle
iMessages, mail, other
communication tools,

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:32.496 A:middle
people with disabilities like
myself can use them and are able

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.556 A:middle
to connect and share
information with people.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:39.786 A:middle
I saw that Facebook message my
friend sent later, and I reached

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:44.476 A:middle
out to her and we were
able to communicate

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:50.216 A:middle
and I explained the various
communication methods I use.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.776 A:middle
Technology facilitates
connections,

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:57.066 A:middle
when both parties are
willing and interested

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:57.906 A:middle
in practicing inclusion.

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
I want to share a photo,
that highlights some


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
I want to share a photo,
that highlights some

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:04.316 A:middle
of the communication
methods I use.

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:09.376 A:middle
In this photo I'm standing
at a table, and I'm reading

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:11.706 A:middle
from a digital Braille display.

00:04:12.216 --> 00:04:17.826 A:middle
Digital Braille, comes through
a device with mechanical pins

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
that pop up to form
Braille letters.

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:24.536 A:middle
And I read these letters
by feeling the dots.

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:28.856 A:middle
Braille is a tool,
not a language.

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:34.156 A:middle
I primarily use English Braille,
I can read Spanish Braille,

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:37.436 A:middle
and I've seen Braille in
many different languages.

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:41.096 A:middle
I was once on a ferry
going from Italy to Greece,

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:47.556 A:middle
and I remembered feeling a bit
lost on the ferry because all

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:48.986 A:middle
of the signs were
in Greek Braille.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:55.416 A:middle
So Braille is a tool and the
Braille display is a device

00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:57.996 A:middle
that produces this
information Braille.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.816 A:middle
Also in the photo, President
Obama is standing at the table


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.816 A:middle
Also in the photo, President
Obama is standing at the table

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.006 A:middle
and he's typing on an
Apple wireless keyboard

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.176 A:middle
and what's being
typed is being sent

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
to the digital Braille display.

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:14.046 A:middle
I'm reading what's being typed

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
and this is a communication
method that I developed.

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:23.686 A:middle
Deaf individuals have been
developing communication tools

00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:25.516 A:middle
for hundreds of years.

00:05:27.236 --> 00:05:31.196 A:middle
Communities around the world,
have developed sign languages.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:33.796 A:middle
In the United States,

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:37.136 A:middle
the dominant sign language
is American Sign Language.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:40.836 A:middle
Which is heavily influenced
by French Sign Language.

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:43.716 A:middle
My brother is deaf-blind.

00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:50.476 A:middle
And when he communicates with
me he uses sign language.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:53.286 A:middle
When he's signing I put
my hand over his hand,

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:57.196 A:middle
and feel what he is signing.

00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
When he wants to listen to me,
he'll put his hand over my hand,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
When he wants to listen to me,
he'll put his hand over my hand,

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:03.076 A:middle
and feel what I'm signing.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:08.276 A:middle
Tactile sign language is
another form of communication

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:11.296 A:middle
that has developed,
that has been developed

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:15.406 A:middle
by the deaf-blind community.

00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:19.706 A:middle
Another form is print on palm,
where people write on palms,

00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:24.166 A:middle
they could write in
English characters, Mandarin

00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:26.226 A:middle
and other forms of characters.

00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:33.336 A:middle
Humans are incredibly creative,
we design new ways for each

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:38.146 A:middle
of us to connect and engage
and share information.

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:40.446 A:middle
Another form of communication
is dance.

00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:46.296 A:middle
And dance is expressed
in many different forms.

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:51.576 A:middle
Some deaf individuals who are
sighted will watch the other

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:54.376 A:middle
dancers and will
pick up the beats

00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:56.456 A:middle
by watching the other dancers.

00:06:57.106 --> 00:07:04.016 A:middle
Other individuals will watch the
musicians, and pick up the beat


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.106 --> 00:07:04.016 A:middle
Other individuals will watch the
musicians, and pick up the beat

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:08.286 A:middle
by watching the fingers and
instruments of the musicians.

00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:12.526 A:middle
People are very creative
and find solutions.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:17.256 A:middle
For me, dance is all
about the connection.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:20.856 A:middle
Salsa is like a kind
of sign language

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:25.736 A:middle
and people communicate
information, rhythm, beat,

00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:29.016 A:middle
music, emotions,
through their hands.

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:33.966 A:middle
Some of the signals
in salsa, are visual

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:37.886 A:middle
and the people I dance with
will switch them around

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:42.386 A:middle
and switch those visual
signals to physical signals.

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:48.746 A:middle
Through dance we celebrate
joy, connection and community.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:53.266 A:middle
Communities that celebrate
diversity will find ways

00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:56.796 A:middle
to be inclusive,
they'll adapt strategies

00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.386 A:middle
to make sure everyone can
participate and be involved.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.386 A:middle
to make sure everyone can
participate and be involved.

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:05.566 A:middle
So dance is one community
in which I belong,

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:06.966 A:middle
that practices inclusion.

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:10.506 A:middle
When I join a community,

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:13.416 A:middle
the first question people
usually ask me is how do

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:14.696 A:middle
you communicate?

00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:18.176 A:middle
The second question
people usually ask me is,

00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:19.926 A:middle
have you heard of Helen Keller?

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:23.736 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:27.116 A:middle
Helen Keller was an
amazing advocate,

00:08:27.526 --> 00:08:33.076 A:middle
she lived from 1880 to 1968.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.086 A:middle
She advocated for
women's rights,

00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:37.336 A:middle
disability's rights,
worker's rights.

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:43.025 A:middle
She spent her whole life
advocating, and yet many stories

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:45.446 A:middle
of Helen reduce her
to one theme.

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:49.846 A:middle
She succeeded despite
her disability.

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:53.166 A:middle
Disability never
holds anyone back,

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:56.986 A:middle
disability is not something
that people need to overcome.

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:01.536 A:middle
The barriers that exist
are created by society.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:01.536 A:middle
The barriers that exist
are created by society.

00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:05.796 A:middle
And it's up to every single
one of us to work together

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.116 A:middle
to remove those barriers.

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:12.066 A:middle
Helen was successful because
she is part of communities

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:13.866 A:middle
that chose to practice
inclusion.

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:16.426 A:middle
She went to Radcliffe College,

00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:19.316 A:middle
and Radcliffe provided
books in Braille.

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:21.616 A:middle
And made sure she
had interpreters.

00:09:22.616 --> 00:09:25.036 A:middle
They worked to ensure
access and inclusion.

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:29.306 A:middle
Not every community
practices inclusion.

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.326 A:middle
Harvard wouldn't admit Helen.

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:37.266 A:middle
Back then Harvard
only admitted men.

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:40.716 A:middle
Helen's disability
didn't hold her back,

00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:46.276 A:middle
her gender didn't hold her back,
it was the community of Harvard

00:09:46.746 --> 00:09:48.976 A:middle
that chose to deny
access to women.

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:54.666 A:middle
As another example, Helen's
family would not allow her

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.436 A:middle
to experience marriage.

00:09:56.536 --> 00:10:01.126 A:middle
Helen fell in love,
secretly got engaged,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:56.536 --> 00:10:01.126 A:middle
Helen fell in love,
secretly got engaged,

00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:05.626 A:middle
but her family prevented her

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:07.736 A:middle
from marrying the
person she loved.

00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:12.396 A:middle
Helen's disability didn't
stop her from feeling love.

00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:15.446 A:middle
She wrote extensively
about love.

00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:18.996 A:middle
But her family, her community,

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:23.336 A:middle
chose to create insurmountable
barriers.

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:27.666 A:middle
All the barriers that exist
are created by society.

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:33.466 A:middle
Of members of society, we play a
role in removing those barriers

00:10:33.746 --> 00:10:36.906 A:middle
and making sure that everyone
can access information

00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:39.546 A:middle
and has access to opportunities.

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:42.756 A:middle
We've come a long way
since Helen's time.

00:10:42.856 --> 00:10:47.706 A:middle
More and more communities
celebrate diverse families

00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:48.336 A:middle
and relationships.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:52.336 A:middle
Harvard eventually
made the smart decision

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:54.086 A:middle
to open its doors to women.

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:59.776 A:middle
And now technology
creates more opportunities

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:02.676 A:middle
for people to connect.

00:11:02.676 --> 00:11:06.376 A:middle
I often wonder, what would
Helen have accomplished,

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:11.296 A:middle
what freedom would she have
enjoyed, if she had access

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.186 A:middle
to the world of apps
that were accessible

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:15.816 A:middle
to people with disabilities?

00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:21.376 A:middle
One of the features
Apple offers,

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.296 A:middle
for developers, is
called VoiceOver.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:28.046 A:middle
And VoiceOver is a
screen reader that,

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:32.606 A:middle
when an app is compatible
with, will produce information

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:36.876 A:middle
in speech or digital
Braille for users of the app.

00:11:36.876 --> 00:11:38.996 A:middle
I'm going to share a
demonstration video

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:40.546 A:middle
that shows how VoiceOver works.

[ Applause ]

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.866 A:middle
Apple has a variety of
accessibility features,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.866 A:middle
Apple has a variety of
accessibility features,

00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:04.806 A:middle
VoiceOver is one
which you just saw.

00:14:04.806 --> 00:14:07.786 A:middle
Another one, support
for Dynamic Type.

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:12.156 A:middle
When you support Dynamic Type,
people who are low vision

00:14:12.156 --> 00:14:17.306 A:middle
and need larger font sizes can
have better access to your apps.

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:19.046 A:middle
Another feature is Captioning.

00:14:19.806 --> 00:14:23.216 A:middle
Support for Captioning allows
individuals who are deaf or hard

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:26.586 A:middle
of hearing, to access the
audio content of your videos.

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:32.066 A:middle
Support for Assistive
Devices like Braille displays,

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:37.706 A:middle
switch controls, switch
controls benefit individuals

00:14:37.706 --> 00:14:38.986 A:middle
with limited mobility.

00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:42.866 A:middle
So these are some of the
features that if you design

00:14:43.106 --> 00:14:46.346 A:middle
for your apps to be accessible,
will allow greater access

00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:47.866 A:middle
for people with disabilities.

00:14:49.366 --> 00:14:53.406 A:middle
But don't stop there, keep
innovating, keep thinking

00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:56.136 A:middle
of new ways for people to
access your information.

00:14:57.406 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
Our goal is to have a
world where all the apps


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.406 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
Our goal is to have a
world where all the apps

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:05.976 A:middle
in the app store,
are accessible.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:09.126 A:middle
Right now if I need an app,
from anything from travel

00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:12.376 A:middle
to shopping, I need
to spend hours looking

00:15:12.376 --> 00:15:14.066 A:middle
for an accessible app.

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:17.706 A:middle
And sometimes, there isn't
an accessible option.

00:15:18.236 --> 00:15:21.136 A:middle
Our goal is to have every app

00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:24.976 A:middle
and I mean every single
app to be accessible.

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:31.306 A:middle
Several years ago, I went
to China for the first time,

00:15:32.546 --> 00:15:34.956 A:middle
and when I arrived in my hotel

00:15:34.956 --> 00:15:38.746 A:middle
in Beijing I did what I always
do when I get somewhere new.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:42.856 A:middle
I explored and while
exploring the room,

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:46.636 A:middle
I discovered an unidentifiable
object.

00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:50.396 A:middle
It felt a little like
a piece of fruit,

00:15:51.316 --> 00:15:53.456 A:middle
but I've never seen
anything like it before.

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:57.976 A:middle
I was wondering,
should I taste it?

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:00.076 A:middle
[Laughter]


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:00.076 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:03.566 A:middle
I was super curious to
find out what it was,

00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:07.936 A:middle
but not curious enough to taste
an unknown object [laughter].

00:16:10.376 --> 00:16:16.256 A:middle
So instead I got out my camera,
on my iPhone, took a picture,

00:16:16.256 --> 00:16:21.226 A:middle
and texted it to a friend,
asking what on earth is this?

00:16:22.686 --> 00:16:23.826 A:middle
Is it safe to eat?

00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:28.366 A:middle
I learned that it
was dragon fruit.

00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:33.956 A:middle
And I discovered I
like dragon fruit.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.966 A:middle
Now imagine a lot
of people thinking,

00:16:36.436 --> 00:16:38.646 A:middle
why would a camera app
need to be accessible?

00:16:38.646 --> 00:16:41.986 A:middle
Why would blind people
ever take pictures?

00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:45.626 A:middle
We take pictures for the
same reasons sighted people

00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:46.476 A:middle
take pictures.

00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:51.316 A:middle
To capture moments, to share
experiences with friends.

00:16:52.606 --> 00:16:55.016 A:middle
Our goal is to make sure
all apps are accessible.

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:58.866 A:middle
Try not to make assumptions
about what people

00:16:58.866 --> 00:17:02.226 A:middle
with disabilities
can and can't do.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.866 --> 00:17:02.226 A:middle
with disabilities
can and can't do.

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:03.546 A:middle
Instead, strive for inclusion.

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
And after you strive for
inclusion for your apps,

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:10.606 A:middle
here are a few things
to keep in mind.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:15.896 A:middle
It helps to plan for
accessibility from the start.

00:17:15.896 --> 00:17:18.226 A:middle
It's much easier, it
saves you resources.

00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:22.616 A:middle
If you plan for accessibility,
from the very start.

00:17:23.816 --> 00:17:26.846 A:middle
I'll give an example
from the physical world.

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:28.676 A:middle
Imagine someone builds
a skyscraper

00:17:29.606 --> 00:17:33.836 A:middle
but realizes they forgot to put
an elevator, tears down part

00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:37.046 A:middle
of the building, and then
installs an elevator.

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:40.566 A:middle
That's more time consuming
and drains resources,

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:43.946 A:middle
it would be much
easier to just plan

00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:46.756 A:middle
for an elevator from the start.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.046 A:middle
Same principle applies
in the digital world.

00:17:49.956 --> 00:17:51.426 A:middle
You save yourself resources

00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:53.906 A:middle
when you can have accessibility
from the very start.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.906 A:middle
And there are engineers
with disabilities,

00:17:56.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
designers with disabilities,
testers with disabilities,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:56.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
designers with disabilities,
testers with disabilities,

00:18:01.536 --> 00:18:02.646 A:middle
to help you with the process.

00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.966 A:middle
There are all so many disability
organizations in the U.S.

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:11.996 A:middle
and around the world, to
help provide feedback,

00:18:13.076 --> 00:18:17.086 A:middle
engage with us, from initial
design to app updates.

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:20.636 A:middle
Apple also has a
lot of resources

00:18:20.706 --> 00:18:21.876 A:middle
to help you with this process.

00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:25.816 A:middle
Their online tutorials,
documentation,

00:18:25.816 --> 00:18:27.586 A:middle
accessibility guidelines
for iOS.

00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:32.676 A:middle
Tomorrow evening here, at WWDC,

00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:36.926 A:middle
we're going to have an
accessibility mixer come

00:18:37.106 --> 00:18:38.486 A:middle
and join us.

00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:41.416 A:middle
I'll be there to
answer questions,

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.806 A:middle
lots of accessibility
people will be there,

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:46.596 A:middle
including developers who've
gone through this process

00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:49.866 A:middle
of making sure their
apps are accessible.

00:18:51.036 --> 00:18:55.376 A:middle
So these are resources
that are available to you

00:18:55.376 --> 00:18:59.296 A:middle
and will help you design
apps that are accessible.

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:00.746 A:middle
Accessibility benefits
your consumers,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:00.746 A:middle
Accessibility benefits
your consumers,

00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:03.326 A:middle
but it also benefits you.

00:19:04.786 --> 00:19:08.756 A:middle
Accessibility has many
benefits for you because one,

00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:12.756 A:middle
people with disabilities are
the largest minority group.

00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:16.536 A:middle
About 1 in 5 Americans
lives with a disability.

00:19:17.346 --> 00:19:19.486 A:middle
So when you design with
accessibility in mind,

00:19:19.486 --> 00:19:21.526 A:middle
you get access to
more customers,

00:19:22.296 --> 00:19:24.336 A:middle
more people can benefit
from your services.

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:30.586 A:middle
Another thing to keep in mind is
accessibility increases access

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.336 A:middle
for everyone including
non-disabled users.

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:37.416 A:middle
For example, when you
caption your videos,

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:42.486 A:middle
and you add alternative
text to your images,

00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:45.466 A:middle
more text is associated
with your content.

00:19:45.466 --> 00:19:53.406 A:middle
And because of that, it's easier
for people to find your content

00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:55.406 A:middle
through powerful
keyword searches.

00:19:55.706 --> 00:20:00.896 A:middle
The videos from WWDC are
captioned and those captions,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:55.706 --> 00:20:00.896 A:middle
The videos from WWDC are
captioned and those captions,

00:20:00.896 --> 00:20:07.446 A:middle
produce a transcript and
anyone can do a keyword search

00:20:07.866 --> 00:20:12.746 A:middle
and find exactly where in the
video a topic was discussed.

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.056 A:middle
This is an example
of how a feature

00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:18.566 A:middle
that benefits the
deaf community,

00:20:19.126 --> 00:20:21.506 A:middle
also benefits the
greater community.

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:25.566 A:middle
But the most important
point is innovation.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:29.496 A:middle
Disability drives innovation.

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:33.586 A:middle
When you think about new ways
of accessing information,

00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:40.516 A:middle
new ways for people to connect,
and engage with each other,

00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:44.646 A:middle
you're going to find yourself
designing the next best thing.

00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:48.776 A:middle
Throughout our history
disability has sparked

00:20:49.126 --> 00:20:54.076 A:middle
innovation, that benefits
all of us today and many

00:20:54.076 --> 00:20:56.776 A:middle
of the products we use today,

00:20:56.776 --> 00:21:01.166 A:middle
can be traced back
to disability.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:56.776 --> 00:21:01.166 A:middle
can be traced back
to disability.

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:05.406 A:middle
In 1808, an Italian inventor
named Turri built one

00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:07.416 A:middle
of the first working
typewriters.

00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:10.926 A:middle
He wanted a solution
for producing print

00:21:11.726 --> 00:21:13.636 A:middle
that didn't require vision.

00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:18.036 A:middle
That someone can do by touch.

00:21:18.036 --> 00:21:22.896 A:middle
Now Turri had a lover who was
blind, and he wanted for her

00:21:22.896 --> 00:21:26.206 A:middle
to be able to write
him love letters.

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:29.416 A:middle
So he designed the first, one
of the first working typewriters

00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:31.526 A:middle
as a possible solution.

00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:37.166 A:middle
And now today, around the world,
we have lots of touch typists,

00:21:37.556 --> 00:21:41.286 A:middle
lots of people who use
keyboards without using vision,

00:21:41.746 --> 00:21:46.496 A:middle
both sighted typists
and blind typists.

00:21:46.826 --> 00:21:50.356 A:middle
More recently, one of the
fathers of the internet,

00:21:51.246 --> 00:21:53.896 A:middle
Vinton Cerf, is hard of hearing,

00:21:54.706 --> 00:21:59.086 A:middle
and his wife is also hearing
impaired, and they were looking

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
for a solution that would
allow them to communicate


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
for a solution that would
allow them to communicate

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:06.486 A:middle
without using hearing.

00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:12.796 A:middle
And to communicate from afar.

00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:14.446 A:middle
Disability drives innovation,

00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:17.316 A:middle
not just by non-disabled
inventors but by people

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.596 A:middle
with disabilities as well.

00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:23.926 A:middle
Vinton ended up developing one
of the earliest email protocols,

00:22:24.916 --> 00:22:27.756 A:middle
and electronic mail
was one way for them

00:22:27.756 --> 00:22:30.066 A:middle
to communicate from afar.

00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:34.216 A:middle
And now, just about
everybody uses email,

00:22:35.106 --> 00:22:36.526 A:middle
and sends text messages.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:42.066 A:middle
Solutions designed with
disability in mind end

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:44.046 A:middle
up benefiting the
entire community.

00:22:44.646 --> 00:22:50.106 A:middle
And central to innovation
is exploration.

00:22:50.696 --> 00:22:55.896 A:middle
I'm going to share a
photo of a jungle gym.

00:22:55.896 --> 00:23:00.636 A:middle
And a jungle gym
highlights exploration.

And a jungle gym
highlights exploration.

00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:04.736 A:middle
There are multiple ways to get
to the top, there isn't a right

00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:07.396 A:middle
or wrong way to climb,
there isn't a right

00:23:07.396 --> 00:23:10.576 A:middle
or wrong path to take.

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:13.476 A:middle
When I'm climbing I
can't see the ropes.

00:23:15.906 --> 00:23:18.876 A:middle
This is about, 20 feet tall,

00:23:19.696 --> 00:23:23.156 A:middle
it's a pyramid shaped
rope based jungle gym.

00:23:23.706 --> 00:23:29.936 A:middle
And when I climb, I reach out,
explore, until I find the ropes,

00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:32.046 A:middle
until I find the solution.

00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:37.796 A:middle
There are many, many, many
different ways to climb,

00:23:37.796 --> 00:23:41.966 A:middle
by touch, by sight, by sound.

00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:44.996 A:middle
You could have someone
down on the ground offering

00:23:44.996 --> 00:23:45.666 A:middle
voice guidance.

00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:48.566 A:middle
If you have a mobility
disability,

00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:53.136 A:middle
you can design an
assistive climbing device.

alternative techniques

00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:59.916 A:middle
and the more open you
are to seeing the world

00:24:00.236 --> 00:24:04.886 A:middle
in multiple perspectives,
the more likely you are going

00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:08.686 A:middle
to design, develop
the next big thing.

00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:13.046 A:middle
One area where we rarely
seek innovation is haptics.

00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:16.386 A:middle
And haptics is the concept

00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
of communication
information through touch.

00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:22.686 A:middle
I have an Apple Watch,

00:24:23.356 --> 00:24:26.166 A:middle
and it taps my wrist twice
when I get a message.

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:28.596 A:middle
And that's a form

00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:32.886 A:middle
of communication based
on haptics, touch.

00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:35.746 A:middle
I recently went surfing,

00:24:35.846 --> 00:24:41.226 A:middle
and that whole experience
was about haptics.

00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:47.336 A:middle
Here's a photo of
me on a tandem board

00:24:47.336 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
and a tandem board
is a large board.

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:52.206 A:middle
I'm standing near the front

00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:55.966 A:middle
and in the back is
the surf instructor,

00:24:55.966 --> 00:24:58.266 A:middle
Matt Allen from Maui
Surf Academy.

00:24:58.266 --> 00:25:00.946 A:middle
He was using tactile signals.

He was using tactile signals.

00:25:00.986 --> 00:25:07.416 A:middle
I could also feel the power
of the waves vibrating

00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:08.226 A:middle
through the surf board.

00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:13.336 A:middle
The wind, the sun,
the cold water.

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:17.646 A:middle
Skin is our largest organ,

00:25:18.796 --> 00:25:22.736 A:middle
yet we've barely explored
the potential of haptics.

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:26.976 A:middle
There's a lot of potential
at this intersection

00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:29.646 A:middle
of haptics and technology.

00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:36.076 A:middle
Keep exploring, keep
innovating, keep designing apps

00:25:36.596 --> 00:25:39.246 A:middle
that are going to increase
access for everyone.

00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:41.386 A:middle
And as you go through this,

00:25:41.386 --> 00:25:44.266 A:middle
engage with the disability
community,

00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:49.656 A:middle
plan for accessibility from
the start and design knowing

00:25:49.656 --> 00:25:50.716 A:middle
that it's going to benefit you.

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:54.016 A:middle
Thanks for listening everyone.

00:25:55.516 --> 00:26:01.500 A:middle
