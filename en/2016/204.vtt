00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:32.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good morning,
everyone.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.886 A:middle
Welcome to Part 1 of
iMessage Apps and Stickers.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:38.566 A:middle
My name is Bhaskar
and I'm an engineer

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.946 A:middle
on the Messages Team at Apple.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:43.616 A:middle
Today we are introducing
iMessage apps.

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.326 A:middle
And what that means is that
you will be able to write apps

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:48.976 A:middle
that run within the context
of the Messages application.

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:53.596 A:middle
iMessage apps can provide
three main types of content.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.476 A:middle
Number one, they can
provide interactive messages.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
Interactive messages
are a type of message


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
Interactive messages
are a type of message

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:03.446 A:middle
that your application generates
and when your user taps

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:05.556 A:middle
on this message, it will
launch your application.

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:08.906 A:middle
For example, in the
screenshot shown here,

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:12.376 A:middle
I'm using the DoorDash app
to send a menu to my friends

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
for the party that we
are having later tonight.

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.616 A:middle
On their phones they will
be able to see that message

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:20.686 A:middle
and if they have the application
installed, they will be able

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.316 A:middle
to tap on it and tapping
will launch DoorDash.

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:25.986 A:middle
At that point they will be
able to modify the menu,

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
add stuff to it, and
send a reply back to me.

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:31.926 A:middle
iMessage apps can
also provide Stickers.

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:35.906 A:middle
Stickers are images
generated by your application

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.586 A:middle
and we believe it
helps create a very fun

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:41.696 A:middle
and interactive experience
between iMessage users.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:47.976 A:middle
And lastly, iMessage apps
can provide every other type

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:51.336 A:middle
of content that Messages has
always supported, like photos,

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:57.476 A:middle
videos, text, links, et cetera.

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.106 A:middle
Also in iOS X we will
have a Messages App Store.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.106 A:middle
Also in iOS X we will
have a Messages App Store.

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:03.806 A:middle
What that means is that
the apps that you write

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:06.526 A:middle
and create will be
shown and displayed

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:07.636 A:middle
in this Messages App Store.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.266 A:middle
Users will be able to get to
this App Store via Messages

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.486 A:middle
and they will be able to
download your applications.

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:17.586 A:middle
Applications that your users
have downloaded will be

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:19.386 A:middle
displayed within
Messages in the UI

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:23.706 A:middle
which we call the
Messages App Drawer.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.996 A:middle
We also have this great
feature that allows your users

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.066 A:middle
to discover your
applications very easily

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:31.636 A:middle
and we call it inline
app attribution.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:34.616 A:middle
Let's try to understand what
that means with an example.

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:38.856 A:middle
In the screenshot shown here
I have received a Sticker

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:43.016 A:middle
from my friend but I do not
have that application installed

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:44.566 A:middle
from which he sent the Sticker.

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:48.176 A:middle
In that case, as you can
see the zoomed in area,

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.486 A:middle
beneath the Sticker we will
have the name of the application

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:52.746 A:middle
from which the Sticker was sent.

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:56.086 A:middle
And tapping on the piece of text
will launch the Messages App

00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:58.816 A:middle
Store and present me
with the application

00:02:58.816 --> 00:02:59.946 A:middle
from which the Sticker was sent.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:02.776 A:middle
And then I can download
the application and use it

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:04.396 A:middle
like any other iMessage app.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:10.446 A:middle
In this example shown here, I
used the Sticker as an example

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:12.286 A:middle
to illustrate inline
app attribution.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.556 A:middle
However, it applies to
every other type of content

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:20.786 A:middle
that your iMessage
app can generate.

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:23.866 A:middle
Also creating an iMessage
app is very similar

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.656 A:middle
to creating any other
iOS application

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:26.836 A:middle
that you have already created.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.766 A:middle
You will be able to use the
same set of technologies

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.836 A:middle
and framework that you
already use currently.

00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:35.846 A:middle
For example, some of the
things that you can use are:

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:41.166 A:middle
You can do in-app purchase
within your application;

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:43.916 A:middle
you will have access
to Apple Pay;

00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:48.266 A:middle
and your iMessage app will
also be able to use the camera.

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:50.196 A:middle
And we believe these
technologies

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.186 A:middle
and features will allow you

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.386 A:middle
to create great apps
for your users.

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:57.406 A:middle
Now let's talk about
supportive platforms.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.706 A:middle
iMessage apps will
only run on iOS X.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.706 A:middle
iMessage apps will
only run on iOS X.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:05.756 A:middle
However, the content that your
application generates will be

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:09.846 A:middle
sent to, and can be viewed
on watchOS and macOS devices.

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:15.776 A:middle
In watchOS 3.0, within
the Messages application,

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:18.096 A:middle
we also have a new page
called the Recents Page.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:22.246 A:middle
The Recents Page, amongst other
things, will display Stickers

00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:24.786 A:middle
that your users had recently
sent from their phone.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:27.086 A:middle
And you users will
not only be able

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.216 A:middle
to see these recent Stickers,
they will also be able

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:31.666 A:middle
to send these Stickers
from their watch just

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.186 A:middle
like they are able to
send it from their phones.

00:04:33.186 --> 00:04:37.946 A:middle
So that was about the
Messages App Store

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.556 A:middle
and the Messages platform.

00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:42.556 A:middle
Now let's get into details
of creating iMessage apps.

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:44.666 A:middle
This is what we're
going to cover

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.116 A:middle
in the rest of the
session today.

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:49.756 A:middle
First we are going to talk
about the Messages framework.

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.526 A:middle
Messages framework is the
framework that you guys need

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.936 A:middle
to familiarize yourself with
to create iMessage apps.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.666 A:middle
Then we're going to talk

00:04:57.666 --> 00:04:59.726 A:middle
about creating a
Sticker Pack application.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
Next we are going to go into
details of Sticker file formats

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.516 A:middle
and other constraints
around Stickers.

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:09.206 A:middle
And lastly we're going to talk

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.216 A:middle
about creating a custom
Sticker experience using the

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:12.026 A:middle
Messages framework.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:16.106 A:middle
What we will not cover
in today's talk is how

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:18.856 A:middle
to create an application that
provides interactive messages.

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:22.676 A:middle
We will cover such an
application in Part 2

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:24.986 A:middle
of our talk and I
do request you guys

00:05:24.986 --> 00:05:26.226 A:middle
to please come back for that.

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:32.356 A:middle
That will be here on Thursday
at 1:40 p.m. Messages framework,

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
Messages framework
is the new framework

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:36.266 A:middle
that we are introducing
in iOS X.

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.986 A:middle
Messages framework
acts as an interface

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:41.706 A:middle
between your iMessages app
and the Messages application.

00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:45.586 A:middle
When your user taps on your app
icon to launch your application,

00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:48.976 A:middle
it is through this framework
that we discover your app,

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:51.616 A:middle
launch it, and provide
your application with data

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.956 A:middle
and other context
your application needs

00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:54.846 A:middle
to lay out its UI.

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:59.496 A:middle
Once your application has
presented its UI your users are

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.206 A:middle
ready to interact with it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.206 A:middle
ready to interact with it.

00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:04.216 A:middle
And at the end of that
interaction your application

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:08.636 A:middle
will hopefully generate some
content that your user wants

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:14.076 A:middle
to share by Messages and your
app hands this content back

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.706 A:middle
to Messages by this framework.

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:18.146 A:middle
And at that point your
users are ready to share

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.256 A:middle
that thing via Messages

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:23.096 A:middle
with whomever they're
talking to at that point.

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:25.926 A:middle
I would like to mention
that the Messages framework

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:28.296 A:middle
and iMessage apps
are built on top

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:30.386 A:middle
of existing app extension
technology.

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:34.916 A:middle
And in that sense your
iMessage app is an app extension

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:37.826 A:middle
and in this scenario the
Messages app is acting

00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:41.266 A:middle
as the host application
for your iMessage app.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:44.656 A:middle
For those of you
who are not familiar

00:06:44.656 --> 00:06:47.956 A:middle
or who have not made extensions
before, I do recommend

00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:50.936 A:middle
that you please go back and
take a look at this WWDC talk

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:56.406 A:middle
from 2014 that introduces
extensions in iOS and OS X.

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:01.826 A:middle
So as I just mentioned, iMessage
apps are extensions, however,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:01.826 A:middle
So as I just mentioned, iMessage
apps are extensions, however,

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:03.746 A:middle
there's one key difference
as compared

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.716 A:middle
to other extension
points on iOS.

00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:09.516 A:middle
Unlike other extension
points you do not have

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
to provide a containing
application

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:12.856 A:middle
for your iMessage app.

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:15.326 A:middle
You can only ship your
iMessage app if you want to.

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:18.926 A:middle
But if you already have
a containing application

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:21.026 A:middle
that you created or that
you're already shipping

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:24.376 A:middle
to the App Store, you can
always include an iMessage app

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:26.376 A:middle
within your containing
application because,

00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:27.746 A:middle
as I mentioned, these
are extensions.

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:33.316 A:middle
So if you provide a
containing application,

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:36.596 A:middle
then your application will
show up in the main Home screen

00:07:36.596 --> 00:07:39.356 A:middle
of your users' phones and
the Messages App Drawer

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:40.116 A:middle
within Messages.

00:07:40.696 --> 00:07:42.566 A:middle
It will also show up
in the main App Store

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.326 A:middle
and in the Messages App Store.

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.496 A:middle
But if you do not provide a
containing application, then,

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:50.936 A:middle
as you can see, your
application will not show

00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:53.776 A:middle
up in the main Home screen
and the main App Store.

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:56.566 A:middle
It will only show up in
the Messages App Drawer

00:07:56.856 --> 00:07:59.576 A:middle
and the Messages App Store.

00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:03.106 A:middle
I would like to mention that if
you do not provide a containing


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:03.106 A:middle
I would like to mention that if
you do not provide a containing

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:05.916 A:middle
application, you still
have to provide an icon

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
for your containing application.

00:08:08.296 --> 00:08:10.456 A:middle
This is the icon that will
be used in other parts

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:13.506 A:middle
of the system like the Settings
application to show information

00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:15.326 A:middle
about your application,
for example,

00:08:15.326 --> 00:08:16.516 A:middle
the amount of storage
it is using.

00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:20.976 A:middle
So now let's talk
about Stickers.

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:24.406 A:middle
Stickers are a fun way and
a new way to communicate

00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:25.806 A:middle
with other iMessage users.

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:29.836 A:middle
Your users can send
Stickers inline just

00:08:29.836 --> 00:08:32.256 A:middle
like any other iMessage
your users already send.

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.626 A:middle
Or your users, not
your Stickers,

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:40.155 A:middle
or your users can drag Stickers
out of their applications

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:42.275 A:middle
and attach them to
other Message bubbles.

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:46.026 A:middle
And we believe this lends
itself to a very expressive

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.076 A:middle
and engaging messaging
experience.

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
But what do Stickers
mean to you?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.766 A:middle
Stickers are basically images
that your application provides.

00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:00.186 A:middle
These images can be animated
or they can be static.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:00.186 A:middle
These images can be animated
or they can be static.

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:04.106 A:middle
And we believe Stickers
are a great way to share

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:06.216 A:middle
or promote any content
that you may have.

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:09.116 A:middle
And we generally think
Sticker applications are going

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.786 A:middle
to be very, very popular
amongst iMessage users.

00:09:12.346 --> 00:09:16.466 A:middle
So now let's talk about
creating Sticker apps.

00:09:17.086 --> 00:09:18.506 A:middle
There are two ways to
create a Sticker app.

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:22.746 A:middle
First, you can create a Sticker
Pack application using Xcode.

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:25.886 A:middle
If you go down this
route, you do not have

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:28.206 A:middle
to provide any code
for your application.

00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:30.376 A:middle
You only have to
provide the assets

00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:32.366 A:middle
for your Stickers
and the app icons.

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:35.706 A:middle
But if you want to
customize your application,

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:37.206 A:middle
you can do so by providing code.

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:39.986 A:middle
And your code in this case
will provide Stickers via the

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:40.806 A:middle
Messages framework.

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:45.886 A:middle
At this point let me
show you a demo of how

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:48.966 A:middle
to create a Sticker Pack
application using Xcode.

00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:55.956 A:middle
So I have my machine here and
I'm going to launch Xcode.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.816 A:middle
And here I'm going
to say I'm going

00:09:57.816 --> 00:09:59.636 A:middle
to create a new Xcode project.

00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:03.986 A:middle
And under the Title of
Application I'm going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:03.986 A:middle
And under the Title of
Application I'm going

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:05.916 A:middle
to select Sticker
Pack Application.

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:08.226 A:middle
And then I'm going to hit Next.

00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:12.026 A:middle
And I'm going to name my project
"SFStickers" as the assets

00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:14.356 A:middle
that I'm going to use are going

00:10:14.356 --> 00:10:17.826 A:middle
to be assets depicting various
landmarks in San Francisco.

00:10:18.896 --> 00:10:19.716 A:middle
So I click Next here.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:23.126 A:middle
And for now just let me
create it on my desktop.

00:10:23.126 --> 00:10:27.966 A:middle
I'm done. Let me quickly
make Xcode bigger.

00:10:28.556 --> 00:10:32.556 A:middle
Great. So, as you can see here
in the template that you get

00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:35.646 A:middle
in a Sticker Pack application,
there are no source code files.

00:10:36.396 --> 00:10:38.986 A:middle
That is a very deliberate
design of this template

00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:40.706 A:middle
and so let me reiterate this,

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:42.796 A:middle
if you create a Sticker
Pack Application,

00:10:43.026 --> 00:10:44.436 A:middle
you cannot provide any code.

00:10:44.626 --> 00:10:47.116 A:middle
You only provide the Sticker
and the app icon assets.

00:10:47.986 --> 00:10:49.176 A:middle
So let's see how to do that.

00:10:50.156 --> 00:10:51.256 A:middle
I go into the Stickers --

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:53.446 A:middle
that's the Catalog which
has two catalogs within it.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.746 A:middle
One is the Sticker Pack and the
other is the iMessage App Icon.

00:10:57.826 --> 00:10:59.136 A:middle
I click on Sticker Pack.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:03.136 A:middle
And, as you can see it says I do
not have any Stickers and I need

00:11:03.136 --> 00:11:05.566 A:middle
to drag and drop the
images to add new Stickers.

00:11:05.986 --> 00:11:07.186 A:middle
So let me do that.

00:11:07.796 --> 00:11:11.976 A:middle
So go to Finder and
I go to Desktop.

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:14.506 A:middle
And I have some assets
here that I want to use.

00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:17.756 A:middle
So I'm going to click on
the first one and I'm going

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:19.336 A:middle
to drag and drop it here.

00:11:19.406 --> 00:11:20.956 A:middle
So that's Golden Gate Bridge.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:23.806 A:middle
I'm going to drag
the second one.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:24.726 A:middle
That's Chinatown.

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:28.486 A:middle
And just to be quick
I'm just going

00:11:28.486 --> 00:11:32.166 A:middle
to select everything
else and drag it here.

00:11:33.436 --> 00:11:34.666 A:middle
Great. So I have all my assets.

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.396 A:middle
So these assets are a PNG type.

00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.956 A:middle
Xcode also allows you
to create an [inaudible]

00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:43.236 A:middle
in your Sticker using the
individual frames of the PNG.

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:45.026 A:middle
Let me show you how to do that.

00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:48.316 A:middle
So I'm going to click, or
rather right-click here

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:50.406 A:middle
and I'm going to
go to Add Assets.

00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:53.476 A:middle
And I'm going to say
New Sticker Sequence.

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:57.616 A:middle
So when you create a new Sticker
sequence Xcode expects you

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.446 A:middle
to provide the individual
frames of the Sticker


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.446 A:middle
to provide the individual
frames of the Sticker

00:12:00.566 --> 00:12:02.006 A:middle
that you're about to create.

00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:04.236 A:middle
So I'm going to go
back to my desktop.

00:12:04.236 --> 00:12:07.446 A:middle
I'm going to click here where
I have the individual frames.

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:10.506 A:middle
I'm going to drag
the first one in.

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:14.236 A:middle
I'm going to drag
the second one in.

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:16.006 A:middle
Third one.

00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:18.086 A:middle
And finally the fourth one.

00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:21.586 A:middle
Now let's go back to Xcode
and see what it does.

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:24.426 A:middle
So as you can see, I
have an enlarged version

00:12:24.426 --> 00:12:26.196 A:middle
of the Sticker here and click

00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.856 A:middle
in its center will actually
show it to me animating.

00:12:28.856 --> 00:12:29.406 A:middle
Looks good.

00:12:30.526 --> 00:12:32.316 A:middle
Now let me just throw
in the app icons.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:37.686 A:middle
I go to the App Icon Catalog.

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:44.986 A:middle
I go in here and I select
these things, drag it here.

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:46.306 A:middle
Looks like I may
have missed one.

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:47.606 A:middle
Let me quickly do
that one again.

00:12:52.096 --> 00:12:52.706 A:middle
All right.

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.106 A:middle
So I provided the app icons.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:55.866 A:middle
At this point I'm ready.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:56.906 A:middle
My app is done.

00:12:57.106 --> 00:12:59.206 A:middle
So let me try and see
how it looks like.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.956 A:middle
I'm going to go here
and test my application


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.956 A:middle
I'm going to go here
and test my application

00:13:01.956 --> 00:13:02.906 A:middle
against the simulator.

00:13:03.676 --> 00:13:05.206 A:middle
I'm going to select iPhone 6s

00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:06.576 A:middle
as the device I want
to test against.

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.866 A:middle
And I'm going to go to Product
and I'm going to hit Run.

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:14.436 A:middle
I'm just going to wait
for this thing to show up.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.506 A:middle
Great. So Messages has shown up

00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:17.906 A:middle
and since I'm creating
an iMessage app,

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:19.606 A:middle
I'm testing it against Messages.

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:21.326 A:middle
And I'm going to run it.

00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:24.286 A:middle
And the simulator is launching.

00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:29.126 A:middle
Great. So here you can see I
have two simulated conversations

00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:30.566 A:middle
in Messages in the simulator.

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:34.226 A:middle
By simulated conversation what
I mean is if you go into one

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:36.226 A:middle
of them and send a
message, it will show

00:13:36.226 --> 00:13:38.886 A:middle
up as an incoming message
in the other conversation.

00:13:39.566 --> 00:13:42.616 A:middle
And just to clarify, you will
not be able to send messages

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:45.856 A:middle
out of the simulator
to real devices.

00:13:46.516 --> 00:13:50.536 A:middle
So going into the first one
and I type in something.

00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:54.506 A:middle
And at this point I'm
just talking to myself so.

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:56.776 A:middle
As you can see, this
is my message here.

00:13:56.866 --> 00:14:00.676 A:middle
Great. Now let me see
what my app looks like.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.866 --> 00:14:00.676 A:middle
Great. Now let me see
what my app looks like.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:03.116 A:middle
So I go in the App
Drawer, and there you go.

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:06.006 A:middle
My application is ready
here to be launched.

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:08.066 A:middle
I click on it.

00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:09.536 A:middle
There you go.

00:14:09.746 --> 00:14:10.986 A:middle
The assets have shown
up right there.

00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:15.176 A:middle
These are the same assets that I
just added and I can scroll down

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:18.726 A:middle
and look how they look like.

00:14:18.726 --> 00:14:20.796 A:middle
And, as you can see the
animated PNG is also here.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.286 A:middle
And I can click on one
of them, peel them,

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:26.436 A:middle
drag them out of
the application,

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:28.306 A:middle
and attach to a message
bubble right here.

00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:31.386 A:middle
Great. And as you can
see, I can go back out,

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:33.196 A:middle
go into the other conversation.

00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:34.026 A:middle
I see the Sticker here.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:37.566 A:middle
So this is how you create
a Sticker Pack application.

00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:40.766 A:middle
However, there's one more thing
that I want to show you here

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:43.606 A:middle
and that is how to
customize certain aspects

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:44.466 A:middle
of this application.

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:50.326 A:middle
So going back to asset Stickers,
I will show you now how

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:52.116 A:middle
to change the sizes of the cells

00:14:52.116 --> 00:14:55.736 A:middle
in which your Stickers are being
displayed in this grid here.

00:14:56.716 --> 00:14:58.646 A:middle
So to do that, let
me go back to Xcode.

00:14:59.826 --> 00:15:03.276 A:middle
And I'm going to click
Go To The Top right here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.826 --> 00:15:03.276 A:middle
And I'm going to click
Go To The Top right here.

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:06.666 A:middle
And as you can see,
there's a drop-down menu

00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:07.696 A:middle
by the name Sticker Size.

00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:09.276 A:middle
I click on that.

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:11.726 A:middle
There are three options,
Small, Medium, and Large.

00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:14.446 A:middle
And I'm going to click
Large and see how

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:15.756 A:middle
that changes my application.

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:17.976 A:middle
I run it again.

00:15:22.206 --> 00:15:23.836 A:middle
And Messages is launched.

00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:25.376 A:middle
Let me go back to
my application.

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:28.746 A:middle
And there you go.

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:32.406 A:middle
As you can see, the Stickers
are now presented two-in-a-row

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:33.986 A:middle
and they're presented
in larger cells.

00:15:33.986 --> 00:15:35.226 A:middle
And there's more
space between them.

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:39.296 A:middle
I'm going to go into more
details of the implications

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:42.246 A:middle
of changing the Sticker cell
size later in this session.

00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:45.346 A:middle
In that demo I showed you how

00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:48.206 A:middle
to create a Sticker Pack
application using Xcode

00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:49.786 A:middle
and in this technique,
like I showed you,

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:51.426 A:middle
you do not have to
provide any code.

00:15:51.726 --> 00:15:54.666 A:middle
You only provide the
assets for the Stickers

00:15:54.706 --> 00:15:55.896 A:middle
and for your app icons.

00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:00.356 A:middle
I also showed you how to use
the tool built into Xcode


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:00.356 A:middle
I also showed you how to use
the tool built into Xcode

00:16:00.566 --> 00:16:03.876 A:middle
to create an APNG Sticker
using the individual frames

00:16:03.876 --> 00:16:04.746 A:middle
of the APNG.

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.166 A:middle
And lastly, we also
talked about how

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.816 A:middle
to change the Sticker
cell sizes.

00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:14.566 A:middle
Now let's talk about supported
file formats for Stickers.

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:16.506 A:middle
We support four formats.

00:16:16.806 --> 00:16:19.826 A:middle
These are PNG, APNG,
JPEG, and GIFs.

00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:23.066 A:middle
And out of these four formats,

00:16:23.096 --> 00:16:25.586 A:middle
if you want to provide
animated Stickers,

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:27.476 A:middle
we support APNG and GIFs.

00:16:28.346 --> 00:16:31.506 A:middle
We are also making certain
optimization under the hood

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:34.406 A:middle
to make sending Stickers
faster as compared

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:37.576 A:middle
to other iMessage attachments
and also to reduce the

00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:39.386 A:middle
on disk storage space
for Stickers.

00:16:39.886 --> 00:16:42.536 A:middle
And to help us make these
optimizations we have

00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:45.596 A:middle
to limit the file sizes for
Stickers to 500 kilobytes.

00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:50.666 A:middle
So as I just mentioned, we
support four file formats,

00:16:51.196 --> 00:16:56.146 A:middle
however, we do recommend that
you use PNG and APNG for most,

00:16:56.146 --> 00:16:57.606 A:middle
if not for all of your Stickers.

00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
Let's try to understand why
we have that recommendation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:00.826 A:middle
Let's try to understand why
we have that recommendation

00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:02.506 A:middle
by taking a look at
these screenshots.

00:17:03.076 --> 00:17:06.786 A:middle
So here I have two conversations
which look nearly identical

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:08.736 A:middle
but there's a subtle
difference between them.

00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:10.965 A:middle
And so let me zoom in
to show what that is.

00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:17.996 A:middle
As you can see, the conversation
to the left has Sticker placed

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.506 A:middle
on the photo and it
is in PNG format.

00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:24.806 A:middle
And the conversation to the
right has the same photo

00:17:24.806 --> 00:17:29.346 A:middle
and the same Sticker but that
Sticker is now in a GIF format.

00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:33.306 A:middle
If you observe carefully
and in the zoomed in areas,

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:35.866 A:middle
the one on the left,
that is the PNG,

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:40.226 A:middle
does not display any
artifacts around it's edges.

00:17:40.436 --> 00:17:42.216 A:middle
But the one on the
right, that is the GIF,

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:43.766 A:middle
is displaying certain artifacts

00:17:43.766 --> 00:17:45.146 A:middle
around the edges
of the Stickers.

00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:48.036 A:middle
Now this is happening
because PNGs

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:51.776 A:middle
and APNGs handle
transparency very well

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:54.446 A:middle
but GIFs do not handle
transparency that well.

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:58.016 A:middle
And if you were to compare
the transparency properties

00:17:58.016 --> 00:18:02.196 A:middle
of JPEGs, JPEGs in fact do not
handle transparency at all.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.016 --> 00:18:02.196 A:middle
of JPEGs, JPEGs in fact do not
handle transparency at all.

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:06.736 A:middle
And hence keep in mind your
Stickers can be dragged

00:18:06.736 --> 00:18:09.116 A:middle
out of your applications and
attached to Message bubbles

00:18:09.626 --> 00:18:12.936 A:middle
and therefore transparency
is a very important factor

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:15.296 A:middle
to consider while
designing your Stickers.

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:19.136 A:middle
We also request you to
please try out your Stickers

00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:21.526 A:middle
on various colored
backgrounds like black, white,

00:18:21.526 --> 00:18:25.326 A:middle
and even multi-colored
backgrounds because, again,

00:18:25.326 --> 00:18:26.856 A:middle
your Stickers can
be placed on photos.

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:32.336 A:middle
In the demo I just showed
you how to change the sizes

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:35.176 A:middle
of the cells in which your
Stickers are being displayed.

00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:38.006 A:middle
There are three supported
cell sizes

00:18:38.006 --> 00:18:40.286 A:middle
and they are small,
regular, and large.

00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:44.426 A:middle
And for each of these sizes
we have a recommended maximum

00:18:44.426 --> 00:18:46.376 A:middle
dimensions of the
Stickers that it supports.

00:18:47.096 --> 00:18:51.516 A:middle
For small it is 100 by 100
points at 3x the scale.

00:18:52.206 --> 00:18:55.856 A:middle
For regular it is 136 by
136 points at 3x the scale.

00:18:56.226 --> 00:18:58.906 A:middle
For large the maximum
supported dimension is 206

00:18:59.376 --> 00:19:01.376 A:middle
by 206 points at 3x the scale.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.376 --> 00:19:01.376 A:middle
by 206 points at 3x the scale.

00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:06.376 A:middle
If you provide Stickers that
are larger than the dimensions

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:09.096 A:middle
that are supported by the cell
size that you have selected,

00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:11.736 A:middle
then your Stickers will be
shrunken down and displayed

00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:14.696 A:middle
by Messages framework and in
that case they may not look

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.786 A:middle
like exactly the way you
intended them to look like.

00:19:18.496 --> 00:19:20.496 A:middle
But if your Stickers
are within these bounds,

00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:22.126 A:middle
then they will be
displayed as is.

00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:26.436 A:middle
I would also like to clarify
that we always request you

00:19:26.656 --> 00:19:30.126 A:middle
to provide us Stickers at
3x the scale regardless

00:19:30.126 --> 00:19:31.806 A:middle
of the resolution of the device

00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:33.676 A:middle
in which your application
is running.

00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:37.356 A:middle
Messages will take care of
scaling down your Stickers

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:39.546 A:middle
if needed according
to the device

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:41.856 A:middle
in which your Stickers are
being currently displayed.

00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:46.176 A:middle
So that is all I had to talk
about the Messages framework

00:19:46.176 --> 00:19:47.646 A:middle
and creating Sticker
applications.

00:19:48.016 --> 00:19:50.076 A:middle
At this point I would like
to hand it over to Lily

00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:50.606 A:middle
who is going to talk

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.336 A:middle
about creating a custom
Sticker experience.

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:52.816 A:middle
Thank you.

00:19:53.516 --> 00:19:58.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:58.656 --> 00:19:59.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Bhaskar.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:02.576 A:middle
My name is Lily and I'm an
engineer on the Messages Team.

00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:03.966 A:middle
I'm going to talk to you

00:20:03.966 --> 00:20:06.256 A:middle
about creating a custom
Sticker application.

00:20:07.326 --> 00:20:08.806 A:middle
First, why would you want

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:10.416 A:middle
to create a custom
Sticker application?

00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:13.546 A:middle
The first major benefit
is you will be able

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.446 A:middle
to customize how you display
Stickers in your application.

00:20:16.926 --> 00:20:19.756 A:middle
In our previous example
we saw Stickers displayed

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:20.956 A:middle
in a nice grid layout.

00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:23.566 A:middle
However, if you wanted
to position your Stickers

00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:26.226 A:middle
in any other format or even
change the background color,

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.706 A:middle
you would need to create a
custom Sticker application.

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:32.626 A:middle
A custom Sticker
application will allow you

00:20:32.626 --> 00:20:34.066 A:middle
to dynamically create stickers.

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:37.176 A:middle
In our previous example
we bundled assets

00:20:37.176 --> 00:20:39.016 A:middle
into our application
and in order

00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:40.876 A:middle
to update those assets
we would have

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:42.436 A:middle
to push an update
to the App Store.

00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:45.206 A:middle
If you want to pull your
assets from your servers,

00:20:45.206 --> 00:20:47.276 A:middle
or allow you users to
dynamically create them

00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:50.476 A:middle
on device, they could do so and
then you wouldn't have to update

00:20:50.786 --> 00:20:52.456 A:middle
through the App Store.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:55.816 A:middle
Messages extensions will
also provide camera access,

00:20:56.196 --> 00:20:58.926 A:middle
allowing your users to create
fun Stickers using the camera.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:03.986 A:middle
And finally your application
can utilize In-app purchases,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:03.986 A:middle
And finally your application
can utilize In-app purchases,

00:21:04.286 --> 00:21:06.176 A:middle
allowing your users
to unlock Stickers.

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:09.446 A:middle
We can create a custom
Sticker application using

00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:10.326 A:middle
Messages framework.

00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:13.156 A:middle
Messages framework
provides the building blocks

00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:14.786 A:middle
for creating a Sticker
application.

00:21:14.786 --> 00:21:17.576 A:middle
In our example of Sticker
Pack applications built

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:20.716 A:middle
through Xcode, they use the
same classes in this framework

00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:23.546 A:middle
so you could ideally create
the same application using

00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:24.376 A:middle
Messages framework.

00:21:24.676 --> 00:21:28.836 A:middle
In the screenshot we have
onscreen we have an application

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:29.956 A:middle
that's displaying Stickers.

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:32.456 A:middle
Well, you'll notice that the
background color is pink.

00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.736 A:middle
So I'm going to show
you how we can customize

00:21:34.736 --> 00:21:36.036 A:middle
and create an application
like this.

00:21:36.316 --> 00:21:37.416 A:middle
So let's go into a demo.

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:43.766 A:middle
So I'm going to open
up Xcode and I'm going

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.366 A:middle
to create a new project.

00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:49.046 A:middle
Bhaskar created a
Sticker Pack application

00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:51.456 A:middle
but this time we're going to
create a Messages application.

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:54.326 A:middle
So I'm going to go
ahead and choose that.

00:21:54.326 --> 00:21:56.676 A:middle
And I'm going to call my
project "Nature Stickies"

00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:59.116 A:middle
as we're going to
use nature assets.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.846 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and
create this project


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.846 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and
create this project

00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:03.746 A:middle
and we'll put it on our desktop.

00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:09.186 A:middle
Great. So you'll see here
that we have two folders:

00:22:09.376 --> 00:22:11.326 A:middle
Nature Stickies and
Messages Extension.

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:13.466 A:middle
Nature Stickies does
not have source code

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:15.626 A:middle
as this is the containing
bundle application.

00:22:15.926 --> 00:22:18.836 A:middle
You'll provide an app icon
here for your System Settings.

00:22:19.246 --> 00:22:22.526 A:middle
However, we're interested in
the folder, Messages Extension.

00:22:22.746 --> 00:22:25.696 A:middle
So we're going to go ahead and
click on MessagesViewController.

00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:28.976 A:middle
And we'll see that
MessagesViewController is going

00:22:28.976 --> 00:22:30.016 A:middle
to be our principal class.

00:22:30.556 --> 00:22:33.346 A:middle
It is a subclass of the
MSMessagesAppViewController.

00:22:33.816 --> 00:22:37.546 A:middle
The MSMessagesAppViewController
is going to be the controller

00:22:37.546 --> 00:22:40.006 A:middle
that handles callbacks from
the Messages application.

00:22:40.646 --> 00:22:42.686 A:middle
We'll be talking more
about these callbacks

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:44.796 A:middle
and how your application
can handle them

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.056 A:middle
in Part 2 of our talk.

00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:48.756 A:middle
So we can go ahead and get
rid of these functions here.

00:22:49.756 --> 00:22:54.656 A:middle
I'm going to select them
and then press Delete.

00:22:55.676 --> 00:22:58.376 A:middle
Great. So let's take a
look at Messages framework.

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:03.106 A:middle
If we click here we have an
MSStickerBrowserViewController.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:03.106 A:middle
If we click here we have an
MSStickerBrowserViewController.

00:23:03.576 --> 00:23:05.296 A:middle
The
MSStickerBrowseViewController

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:06.716 A:middle
will allow us to
display stickers.

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.476 A:middle
It has two properties.

00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:11.756 A:middle
It has an MSStickerBrowserView
which is the view

00:23:11.756 --> 00:23:13.046 A:middle
that our Stickers
will be displayed in.

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:17.746 A:middle
And it also has an MSStickerSize
which decide the cell sizes

00:23:17.746 --> 00:23:20.396 A:middle
of our grid for the
MSStickerBrowserView.

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:24.006 A:middle
We'll also see that the
MSStickerBrowserViewController

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:24.946 A:middle
conforms

00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:27.296 A:middle
to the MSStickerBrowserView
DataSource protocol.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:30.826 A:middle
This protocol, when implemented,
will return the number

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.406 A:middle
of Stickers your
application will be displaying

00:23:33.406 --> 00:23:36.536 A:middle
and the Sticker at a given index
for the MSStickerBrowserView.

00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:38.696 A:middle
So if we want to
display our Stickers,

00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:41.386 A:middle
we'll need to create an
MSStickerBrowserViewController.

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.576 A:middle
And to implement the data
source we'll go ahead

00:23:43.576 --> 00:23:44.336 A:middle
and subclass this.

00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:47.676 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead
and create a new file.

00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:52.116 A:middle
And I'm going to choose
Swift and click Next.

00:23:52.216 --> 00:23:55.306 A:middle
And I'm going to call
this NatureStickerBrowser

00:23:56.026 --> 00:23:56.736 A:middle
ViewController.

00:23:57.316 --> 00:24:04.036 A:middle
Great. So I'm going to go
ahead and import UIKit.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.316 --> 00:24:04.036 A:middle
Great. So I'm going to go
ahead and import UIKit.

00:24:04.806 --> 00:24:08.956 A:middle
And then I'll go ahead
and import Messages.

00:24:10.246 --> 00:24:12.786 A:middle
Great. So now let's
create our class.

00:24:13.406 --> 00:24:17.266 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
create our NatureStickerBrowser

00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:19.256 A:middle
ViewController class
as a subclass

00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:20.976 A:middle
of the
MSStickerBrowserViewController.

00:24:21.676 --> 00:24:22.416 A:middle
As I mentioned,

00:24:22.416 --> 00:24:23.996 A:middle
the
MSStickerBrowserViewController

00:24:24.436 --> 00:24:26.786 A:middle
has two data source methods
that we'll need to implement.

00:24:26.876 --> 00:24:28.916 A:middle
So I'll go ahead
and fill those in.

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.606 A:middle
So now we'll need a way

00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:33.266 A:middle
to create our Stickers
and store them.

00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:38.836 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and create
an array to hold our Stickers

00:24:38.986 --> 00:24:42.306 A:middle
and we'll see that our
Stickers are at MSSticker.

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:45.716 A:middle
And MSSticker is an
object that has a file URL

00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:47.176 A:middle
that points to an asset on disk.

00:24:47.516 --> 00:24:49.696 A:middle
It will also have a
localized description

00:24:49.996 --> 00:24:51.636 A:middle
which will be used
for accessibility.

00:24:52.586 --> 00:24:54.216 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and create a Sticker.

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:58.086 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
add assets to our bundle.

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:02.916 A:middle
I'm going to click Add Files
and then go to my desktop


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:02.916 A:middle
I'm going to click Add Files
and then go to my desktop

00:25:03.316 --> 00:25:05.946 A:middle
and choose these assets here.

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.966 A:middle
And I've added them
to my application.

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:12.136 A:middle
In this example we're just
adding assets to our application

00:25:12.376 --> 00:25:14.886 A:middle
but you can imagine how your
applications can either pull

00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:17.146 A:middle
these assets from your
servers or allow your users

00:25:17.146 --> 00:25:18.136 A:middle
to create them on device.

00:25:18.896 --> 00:25:20.586 A:middle
So now we'll need
to create a Sticker.

00:25:22.576 --> 00:25:24.766 A:middle
So we'll write a
function to do that.

00:25:25.886 --> 00:25:28.926 A:middle
Great. So here we
take our bundle.

00:25:28.926 --> 00:25:31.746 A:middle
We create a file URL
pointing to our asset on disk,

00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:33.806 A:middle
and then we initialize
our MSSticker

00:25:34.206 --> 00:25:36.666 A:middle
with a localized description,
and then add it to our array.

00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:38.936 A:middle
So now let's go ahead
and write a function

00:25:38.936 --> 00:25:40.226 A:middle
that will load all
of the Stickers.

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:46.936 A:middle
Cool. So now we can go back
to our MessagesViewController

00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:50.306 A:middle
and create an instance.

00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:53.876 A:middle
And we'll create a
NatureStickerBrowser

00:25:53.876 --> 00:25:57.556 A:middle
ViewController, and we'll
instantiate it, and viewDidLoad.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.836 --> 00:26:04.756 A:middle
Great. So now we instantiated
our browserViewController

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:06.176 A:middle
with a Sticker size.

00:26:06.556 --> 00:26:09.316 A:middle
This will allow your application
to display your Stickers

00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:11.206 A:middle
in the grid layouts that
we showed you earlier.

00:26:11.846 --> 00:26:14.176 A:middle
So this application will
create a Sticker application

00:26:14.176 --> 00:26:16.166 A:middle
like we did through
Xcode without code.

00:26:16.486 --> 00:26:18.016 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and customize this.

00:26:18.086 --> 00:26:20.226 A:middle
I'm going to write a
function that will allow me

00:26:20.226 --> 00:26:22.976 A:middle
to change the background color
of our MSStickerBrowserView.

00:26:24.556 --> 00:26:26.026 A:middle
So we'll write that
function here.

00:26:26.026 --> 00:26:28.296 A:middle
And we're just changing
the background color

00:26:28.296 --> 00:26:29.516 A:middle
of the MSStickerBrowserView.

00:26:29.516 --> 00:26:31.026 A:middle
And I'm going to go back

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:36.966 A:middle
to the MessagesViewController
and call that.

00:26:36.966 --> 00:26:39.596 A:middle
So now we can change
the background.

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:42.466 A:middle
And let's go ahead and
run our application.

00:26:43.016 --> 00:26:45.956 A:middle
So I'm going to choose
the iPhone 6s

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:52.416 A:middle
and I'm going to hit Run.

00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:54.086 A:middle
Oops. Oh, I forgot something.

00:26:54.086 --> 00:26:55.746 A:middle
We forgot to actually
implement our data source.

00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:57.466 A:middle
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:26:58.176 --> 00:27:02.956 A:middle
So I'm going to return the
Stickers count and I'm going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.176 --> 00:27:02.956 A:middle
So I'm going to return the
Stickers count and I'm going

00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:07.036 A:middle
to return a Sticker
out of given index.

00:27:07.886 --> 00:27:08.996 A:middle
And now we're ready to run.

00:27:11.056 --> 00:27:13.666 A:middle
So I'll choose Messages as the
application I want to run in.

00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:23.066 A:middle
Great. And now we can
open up the App Drawer

00:27:23.136 --> 00:27:28.196 A:middle
and then you'll see that
we don't have an icon

00:27:28.196 --> 00:27:29.296 A:middle
because we forgot to add that.

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:32.226 A:middle
And we'll see that we have our
app named Messages Extension.

00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:35.006 A:middle
In order to change what our
display name is we would have

00:27:35.006 --> 00:27:38.026 A:middle
to go into our project, click on
the Messages Extension Target,

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:39.576 A:middle
and then we could
change it here.

00:27:40.186 --> 00:27:45.426 A:middle
But for now let's just see what
our application looks like.

00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:52.306 A:middle
So you'll see we now have an
application that has Stickers

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:53.286 A:middle
with a pink background.

00:27:54.096 --> 00:27:55.356 A:middle
So this is one small example

00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:57.546 A:middle
of how you can customize
your Sticker applications.

00:27:57.946 --> 00:27:59.106 A:middle
So let's go back to the slides.

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
So to recap what
we just went over,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
So to recap what
we just went over,

00:28:01.996 --> 00:28:05.046 A:middle
we introduced the
MSStickerBrowserView Controller.

00:28:05.366 --> 00:28:07.316 A:middle
This ViewController
will display Stickers

00:28:07.316 --> 00:28:10.366 A:middle
in your application using
the MSStickerBrowserView.

00:28:11.036 --> 00:28:12.846 A:middle
This controller also conforms

00:28:12.986 --> 00:28:15.276 A:middle
to the MSStickerBrowserView
DataSource protocol.

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:17.756 A:middle
This protocol will
return the number

00:28:17.756 --> 00:28:20.076 A:middle
of Stickers your
application will be displaying

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:21.086 A:middle
and the given Sticker.

00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:24.266 A:middle
We also introduced the MS
MessagesAppViewController.

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:27.946 A:middle
This ViewController is what your
principal class will subclass.

00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:31.196 A:middle
This MSMessagesAppViewController
handles callbacks

00:28:31.236 --> 00:28:32.596 A:middle
from the Messages application.

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:34.946 A:middle
Again, we'll talk more
about this in Part 2

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:37.106 A:middle
and how your application
can handle these callbacks.

00:28:37.386 --> 00:28:38.866 A:middle
So that was a small example

00:28:38.866 --> 00:28:41.036 A:middle
of how we could customize
a Sticker application

00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:42.446 A:middle
by just changing the
background color.

00:28:42.766 --> 00:28:45.626 A:middle
But what if we want to do more?

00:28:45.626 --> 00:28:49.696 A:middle
Your application can add Sticker
support using just two classes,

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:52.236 A:middle
the MSStickerView
and an MSSticker.

00:28:52.966 --> 00:28:54.766 A:middle
So if we wanted to
create an application

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:56.566 A:middle
that displays Stickers
in a different way

00:28:56.566 --> 00:28:58.366 A:middle
than the
MSStickerBrowserViewController

00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:01.866 A:middle
does, we can do so by
using these two classes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:01.866 A:middle
does, we can do so by
using these two classes.

00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:05.266 A:middle
On the example I have behind
me we have an application.

00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.166 A:middle
This application
is actually using a

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:10.196 A:middle
UICollectionViewController
to display Stickers.

00:29:10.856 --> 00:29:11.886 A:middle
And each cell

00:29:11.886 --> 00:29:14.496 A:middle
of the UICollectionView
has an MSStickerView.

00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
The MSStickerView is the class
that will be providing the drag

00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:19.856 A:middle
and drop functionality
of Stickers

00:29:19.856 --> 00:29:21.186 A:middle
into the Messages transcript.

00:29:22.196 --> 00:29:24.316 A:middle
So we also see that
there's a Plus icon

00:29:24.606 --> 00:29:26.206 A:middle
which doesn't have
the MSStickerView.

00:29:26.516 --> 00:29:28.556 A:middle
Tapping it will expand
our application,

00:29:28.986 --> 00:29:33.856 A:middle
allow us to choose a Sticker,
and add it to our collection.

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:35.276 A:middle
Also note that we were able

00:29:35.276 --> 00:29:37.636 A:middle
to transition how our
Stickers were displayed.

00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:39.636 A:middle
Your application
can go from being

00:29:39.636 --> 00:29:41.866 A:middle
in a compact mode
to an expanded mode.

00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:45.216 A:middle
Your users can also
toggle this so by clicking

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.416 A:middle
on the chevron in the bottom.

00:29:46.506 --> 00:29:49.416 A:middle
So your application will have
to be able to handle being

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:51.176 A:middle
in a compact and
an expanded mode.

00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:53.706 A:middle
So I'm going to show you how
you can handle these callbacks

00:29:53.706 --> 00:29:55.186 A:middle
and create an application
like this.

00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:56.796 A:middle
So let's go into another demo.

00:29:56.796 --> 00:30:01.776 A:middle
So I'm going to open up an
application I already have.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:56.796 --> 00:30:01.776 A:middle
So I'm going to open up an
application I already have.

00:30:02.746 --> 00:30:03.906 A:middle
And it's called Sticker Picker.

00:30:07.566 --> 00:30:09.236 A:middle
And let's go ahead
and make this bigger.

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:12.246 A:middle
Great. So we're back in
our MessagesViewController

00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:14.436 A:middle
which is our principal
class, again,

00:30:14.436 --> 00:30:17.136 A:middle
subclassing the
MSMessagesAppViewController.

00:30:17.976 --> 00:30:19.836 A:middle
We had two views
that we displayed,

00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:22.246 A:middle
our UICollectionView
holding MSStickerViews,

00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:24.576 A:middle
and we also had a view
that would allow us

00:30:24.576 --> 00:30:25.956 A:middle
to add Stickers to
our application.

00:30:26.336 --> 00:30:28.236 A:middle
These two views are
going to be represented

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:30.316 A:middle
in a StickerPickerCollection
ViewController

00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:32.386 A:middle
and in an
AddStickersViewController.

00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:33.776 A:middle
Let's take a look

00:30:33.776 --> 00:30:36.206 A:middle
at the StickerPickerCollection
ViewController.

00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:39.346 A:middle
The StickerPickerCollection
ViewController,

00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:42.736 A:middle
subclass is a
UICollectionViewController.

00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:45.466 A:middle
The items that we'll have
are a CollectionViewItem.

00:30:45.806 --> 00:30:48.536 A:middle
So it can either be
the AddSticker item

00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:49.796 A:middle
or it could be a Sticker.

00:30:50.096 --> 00:30:52.036 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
look at the Sticker cell.

00:30:53.136 --> 00:30:54.996 A:middle
The Sticker cell has
an MSStickerView.

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:59.106 A:middle
The MSStickerView will
have a Sticker and,

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:03.176 A:middle
in order to handle animations
of your animated Stickers,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:03.176 A:middle
in order to handle animations
of your animated Stickers,

00:31:03.476 --> 00:31:06.766 A:middle
we would have to call
startAnimating and stopAnimating

00:31:06.946 --> 00:31:08.746 A:middle
when we are displaying
our MSStickerView.

00:31:09.896 --> 00:31:10.676 A:middle
So let's go back

00:31:10.676 --> 00:31:12.576 A:middle
to the StickerPickerCollection
ViewController.

00:31:14.636 --> 00:31:19.536 A:middle
Great. So when we create this
ViewController we're going

00:31:19.536 --> 00:31:21.206 A:middle
to go ahead and create
all of our items.

00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:23.706 A:middle
We'll create an AddStickerItem

00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:25.526 A:middle
and then we'll load our
Stickers the same way we did

00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:26.586 A:middle
in our previous example.

00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:29.426 A:middle
We'll return the number of
items in our collectionView

00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:33.046 A:middle
and we'll create Sticker
cells or the Add Sticker cell

00:31:33.046 --> 00:31:36.316 A:middle
for an item at a
given index path.

00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:38.856 A:middle
When creating the Sticker
cell we're going to want

00:31:38.856 --> 00:31:41.386 A:middle
to assign the Sticker
value of our stickerView.

00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:42.976 A:middle
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:31:47.256 --> 00:31:50.876 A:middle
So we have now put a
Sticker on our stickerView.

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:54.276 A:middle
And, as I mentioned, our
Stickers can be animated.

00:31:54.386 --> 00:31:57.696 A:middle
And we'll need to be calling
start and stopAnimating

00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:59.086 A:middle
to control these animations.

00:31:59.366 --> 00:32:02.096 A:middle
When we're going to display
our Sticker we're going to want


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.366 --> 00:32:02.096 A:middle
When we're going to display
our Sticker we're going to want

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:05.236 A:middle
to call startAnimating and when
we stop displaying our Sticker

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:07.036 A:middle
we're going to want
to call stopAnimating.

00:32:07.546 --> 00:32:08.986 A:middle
So we can write a
function to check

00:32:08.986 --> 00:32:10.756 A:middle
if the Sticker is
animatable or not

00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:15.316 A:middle
by loading the image file URL,
and using a CG image source,

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:16.936 A:middle
and counting the frames.

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:18.706 A:middle
If we have more than one frame,

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:20.466 A:middle
we know that we have
an animated Sticker.

00:32:21.296 --> 00:32:23.336 A:middle
So we'll go ahead
and implement this.

00:32:24.826 --> 00:32:26.056 A:middle
So we'll check to see

00:32:26.306 --> 00:32:28.706 A:middle
if our Sticker cell
Sticker can animate.

00:32:28.706 --> 00:32:31.216 A:middle
And if it can, then we'll
call startAnimating.

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:36.966 A:middle
And then when we're done
displaying our cell we'll go

00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:41.026 A:middle
ahead and check if our Sticker
is animating, and if it is,

00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:42.366 A:middle
we'll call stopAnimating.

00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:46.226 A:middle
Great. So let's go back to
the MessagesViewController.

00:32:46.226 --> 00:32:48.576 A:middle
And we'll go ahead

00:32:48.576 --> 00:32:50.636 A:middle
and instantiate the
StickerPickerViewController

00:32:50.636 --> 00:32:52.776 A:middle
as that's going to be
the view we want loaded

00:32:52.776 --> 00:32:54.276 A:middle
when we first launch
our application.

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:57.026 A:middle
So we'll do that in viewDidLoad
and then we'll present it.

00:32:57.026 --> 00:33:01.486 A:middle
When the user taps the
Add icon we'll want


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.026 --> 00:33:01.486 A:middle
When the user taps the
Add icon we'll want

00:33:01.486 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
to create the
AddStickersViewController.

00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
And then we're going
to want to transition

00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:06.216 A:middle
into an expanded mode.

00:33:06.606 --> 00:33:09.216 A:middle
We can do so by calling
requestPresentationStyle.

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:11.316 A:middle
This will tell the
Messages application

00:33:11.546 --> 00:33:13.526 A:middle
that your application
wants to be expanded.

00:33:14.176 --> 00:33:15.156 A:middle
You'll then get a call back

00:33:15.156 --> 00:33:17.116 A:middle
from the Messages
application once you've done

00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:17.856 A:middle
this transition.

00:33:18.306 --> 00:33:18.546 A:middle
So

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:21.956 A:middle
in didTransitiontopresentation
Style we'll get a call back

00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:23.786 A:middle
and we'll first check to see

00:33:23.786 --> 00:33:25.676 A:middle
if we have an
AddStickersViewController.

00:33:25.876 --> 00:33:28.936 A:middle
And if we do and our
presentation style is expanded,

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:30.576 A:middle
we'll go ahead and
present that view.

00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:33.916 A:middle
Or else we'll present the other
view we want to show in compact.

00:33:34.206 --> 00:33:36.086 A:middle
After we choose a Sticker
we're going to want

00:33:36.086 --> 00:33:37.156 A:middle
to go back to compact.

00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:39.966 A:middle
So we'll then again call
requestPresentationStyle

00:33:39.966 --> 00:33:40.806 A:middle
.compact.

00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
So if we run our
application we'll be able

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:44.256 A:middle
to see all of this in play.

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:48.346 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead
and choose Messages

00:33:48.346 --> 00:33:49.856 A:middle
as the application
I want to run.

00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:55.236 A:middle
And we're going to launch.

00:33:56.406 --> 00:33:59.996 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
click on the App Drawer.

00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:01.826 A:middle
And we're going to
click on Sticker Picker


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:01.826 A:middle
And we're going to
click on Sticker Picker

00:34:04.436 --> 00:34:09.556 A:middle
and wait for it to load.

00:34:09.556 --> 00:34:12.746 A:middle
Great. So now we can go
ahead and add a Sticker.

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:16.235 A:middle
And I'm going to choose
this cute panda right here.

00:34:16.235 --> 00:34:18.985 A:middle
And we'll see it
also animating here.

00:34:18.985 --> 00:34:20.565 A:middle
And then we can send
our Stickers.

00:34:21.996 --> 00:34:25.795 A:middle
So to recap what we just
went over, we introduced,

00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:28.866 A:middle
we showed you how to create
a Sticker application using a

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:31.306 A:middle
UICollectionView and
in each of the cells

00:34:31.306 --> 00:34:34.036 A:middle
of the UICollectionView
we had an MSStickerView.

00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:37.696 A:middle
The MSStickerView allowed
us to drag and drop Stickers

00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:40.386 A:middle
into the transcript and
it also had an MSSticker.

00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:44.286 A:middle
We also showed you how you
can transition from a compact

00:34:44.286 --> 00:34:45.866 A:middle
to an expanded presentation
style.

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:48.936 A:middle
And we also showed you how
you can handle such callbacks

00:34:48.936 --> 00:34:50.216 A:middle
from the Messages application.

00:34:50.606 --> 00:34:52.856 A:middle
Remember that your users
can toggle between the two

00:34:52.856 --> 00:34:55.696 A:middle
by tapping on the chevron icon
so please keep that in mind

00:34:55.696 --> 00:34:56.916 A:middle
on designing your application.

00:34:58.676 --> 00:35:01.836 A:middle
Bhaskar talked about the Sticker
File Formats that we used


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.676 --> 00:35:01.836 A:middle
Bhaskar talked about the Sticker
File Formats that we used

00:35:01.836 --> 00:35:03.776 A:middle
when creating a Sticker
Pack Application.

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:06.106 A:middle
These same file formats apply

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:07.856 A:middle
to creating a custom
Sticker application.

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.816 A:middle
So to summarize what
we went over today,

00:35:10.366 --> 00:35:13.926 A:middle
we introduced iMessage apps as a
platform to you as a developer.

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:16.216 A:middle
There's a new way to
interact with Messages

00:35:16.216 --> 00:35:17.696 A:middle
and it's really fun
and exciting.

00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:20.176 A:middle
We also introduced
Messages framework

00:35:20.176 --> 00:35:22.996 A:middle
and how you could create
Sticker Pack Applications using

00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:23.836 A:middle
Messages framework.

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:27.896 A:middle
We showed you how to create a
Sticker Pack Application using

00:35:27.896 --> 00:35:29.066 A:middle
Xcode with no code.

00:35:29.066 --> 00:35:30.806 A:middle
And we also showed you how

00:35:30.806 --> 00:35:33.646 A:middle
to programmatically create a
custom Sticker application.

00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:36.646 A:middle
In Part 2 of our talk
we're going to show you how

00:35:36.646 --> 00:35:39.376 A:middle
to create an application that
will allow your application

00:35:39.376 --> 00:35:40.726 A:middle
to send interactive messages.

00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:43.556 A:middle
For more information
please visit the website

00:35:43.556 --> 00:35:46.946 A:middle
and we'll have a related session
back here in the Presidio

00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:48.686 A:middle
at 1:40 p.m. on Thursday.

00:35:49.026 --> 00:35:49.856 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.956 A:middle
We can't wait to see
what you guys create

00:35:51.956 --> 00:35:52.986 A:middle
and please come to our labs.

00:35:53.466 --> 00:35:54.576 A:middle
Have a great rest
of the conference.

00:35:55.016 --> 00:35:57.000 A:middle
