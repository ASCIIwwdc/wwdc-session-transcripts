[ Music ]

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:21.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Todd Ritland,
AirPrint engineer

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:23.606 A:middle
and the lead engineer
on iOS printing.

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.166 A:middle
And this is Deploying
AirPrint in Enterprise.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.356 A:middle
AirPrint is Apple's
total printing solution.

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:34.556 A:middle
It's a technology that helps you

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:37.476 A:middle
to create full-quality
printed output without the need

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.236 A:middle
to download or install drivers.

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:42.516 A:middle
If you're an app developer
and want to add printing

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:46.426 A:middle
to your app, see
developer.apple.com/airprint

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:51.106 A:middle
for a previous talk I gave at
WWDC titled Advances in AirPrint

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.566 A:middle
and download the sample
code to get started.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.326 A:middle
If you are a printer
manufacturer

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.566 A:middle
or a print server
developer and wish

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.726 A:middle
to license AirPrint
technology for your product,

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.726 A:middle
to license AirPrint
technology for your product,

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.766 A:middle
please email airprint@apple.com.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:07.636 A:middle
This talk will focus on
those who are responsible

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:09.516 A:middle
for deploying AirPrint
and want to learn more

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:11.056 A:middle
about all the enterprise
features

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.616 A:middle
that make AirPrint work great
in enterprise environments.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.626 A:middle
Printing in enterprise has
many unique requirements.

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:22.026 A:middle
Our enterprise customers
are dealing with a fleet

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:24.226 A:middle
of printers, often
from many manufacturers

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:27.376 A:middle
and with different features,
across floors of buildings

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:28.926 A:middle
or across many different
buildings,

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:30.536 A:middle
and in many locations.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.716 A:middle
These can be hugely
complex printers as well.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.316 A:middle
The network infrastructure
is often very complex.

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.756 A:middle
Often they're wireless
and wired clients

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:45.076 A:middle
and their network
structure may be unrelated

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:46.806 A:middle
to the physical location
in a building.

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:51.706 A:middle
IT departments also have
varying network requirements,

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.756 A:middle
such as no access
to software update,

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:56.286 A:middle
no multicast packet
traffic allowed,

00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.366 A:middle
and certain ports blocks, which
all have impact on printers.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.366 A:middle
and certain ports blocks, which
all have impact on printers.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
Enterprise customers also may
have accounting requirements

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:06.906 A:middle
since every page
printed costs money.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.436 A:middle
And of course security
requirements are essential

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.516 A:middle
and are increasingly important
in enterprise printing.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:22.446 A:middle
The top requests we get from
enterprise are the ability

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:27.276 A:middle
to create PDF and have more
paper-free workflows, security,

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:29.436 A:middle
access control and accounting,

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:31.806 A:middle
and better discovery
of printers.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.596 A:middle
So let's go into
what AirPrint offers

00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:35.836 A:middle
for each of these in detail.

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:40.386 A:middle
First, create PDF
from the Print panel.

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.646 A:middle
Mac OS has long had the ability

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.056 A:middle
to get a PDF anywhere
you can print.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:49.666 A:middle
And now in iOS 10, all iOS
devices have this ability

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:50.976 A:middle
as well and I'd like to
show you how this works.

00:02:56.116 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
Here we have an iPad running
iOS 10, and when I tap Print,

00:02:56.116 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
Here we have an iPad running
iOS 10, and when I tap Print,

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:04.576 A:middle
I just pinch out with my two
fingers on the Print Preview.

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:09.976 A:middle
And from here, I have a Share
button at the top corner.

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:14.756 A:middle
Any app can accept PDFs will
appear under the Share menu,

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:17.486 A:middle
as well as AirDrop and other
system-sharing options.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:22.166 A:middle
This also works with the Managed
Open In Enterprise feature

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
that keeps business items
and personal items separate.

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:29.966 A:middle
On devices with 3D Touch, you
can alternatively use the Peek

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.776 A:middle
and Pop gesture to
access this same view

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:33.696 A:middle
from the Print Preview.

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:37.586 A:middle
We think enterprise users will
love having this new paper-free

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:40.206 A:middle
workflow on all of
their iOS devices.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:46.496 A:middle
Next onto a hugely
important topic, security.

00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:52.546 A:middle
AirPrint on iOS and Mac
OS support full end-to-end

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:55.126 A:middle
encryption so your documents
are protected on the network.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
AirPrint supports the latest
industry standard TLS 1.2

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
AirPrint supports the latest
industry standard TLS 1.2

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.206 A:middle
encryption on top of HTTP.

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:06.066 A:middle
This encryption technology
is a requirement

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:08.206 A:middle
for all new AirPrint
printers and servers.

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:13.366 A:middle
Next, for additional security,

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:16.565 A:middle
many enterprise customers don't
want printed pages sitting

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:18.156 A:middle
around in the output
bin of a printer,

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:23.496 A:middle
where an unauthorized person
can pick it up and view it.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.516 A:middle
iOS and Mac OS support PIN
Release for printers and servers

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:30.316 A:middle
that support it, where the user
will enter a PIN at the printer

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:31.606 A:middle
to receive their output.

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:35.576 A:middle
On iOS, when a PIN is required,

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.686 A:middle
the Print panel has a
label explaining that.

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:42.896 A:middle
And when the user taps
Print, an alert is displayed

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:43.976 A:middle
with the PIN to release the job.

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:53.646 A:middle
On Mac OS, the user can
type the PIN they want

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:55.726 A:middle
to use to release the job.

00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:59.496 A:middle
Mac OS also supports
PIN when PIN is optional

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:00.706 A:middle
and not required to print.

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:00.706 A:middle
and not required to print.

00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:03.506 A:middle
Next, Access Control
and Accounting.

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:07.726 A:middle
AirPrint has always
supported printers and servers

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
that require authentication
with a username and password.

00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:14.456 A:middle
We store the username and
password entered in the keychain

00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:16.616 A:middle
so the user never has
to enter it again.

00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:20.836 A:middle
iOS 10 now supports
the ability to forget

00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:23.876 A:middle
that stored authentication
information to support workflows

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:24.976 A:middle
where a different
user name is needed.

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:33.836 A:middle
Also new this year is support
for password-only authentication

00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:35.246 A:middle
so printer can be protected

00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:36.976 A:middle
with just a simple
password, as shown here.

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:43.756 A:middle
When an enterprise
needs to have billing

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:46.736 A:middle
or account information
added to each print job,

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:50.596 A:middle
iOS and Mac OS both support
printers and servers that take

00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:51.776 A:middle
that account information.

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:55.456 A:middle
If the account information
is required for every job,

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:57.676 A:middle
the user will be
required to enter

00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:58.946 A:middle
that information before
the job continues.

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
And iOS and Mac OS
support either optional

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.186 A:middle
or required account
ID for print jobs,

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:10.976 A:middle
and this is what the UI
looks like on Mac OS X.

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
Next, Better Discovery.

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:25.426 A:middle
AirPrint has many supportive
ways to find and use printers.

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:27.926 A:middle
The main method which
most people associate

00:06:27.926 --> 00:06:29.586 A:middle
with AirPrint is Local Bonjour.

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:31.976 A:middle
There is no setup required.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.056 A:middle
The printer automatically
appears as an available printer

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:36.336 A:middle
in the list without any setup.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:41.516 A:middle
AirPrint has also always
supported Wide-Area Bonjour.

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:45.546 A:middle
Bonjour is based on
DNS Service Discovery.

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:47.556 A:middle
And if a DNS server
is configured

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:48.636 A:middle
with the correct records,

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.946 A:middle
printers can be discovered
this way

00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
and I'll go over how to do this.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:58.526 A:middle
Both iOS and Mac OS also now
support Mobile Device Management

00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
or MDM profiles with a
configured AirPrint payload.

00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
or MDM profiles with a
configured AirPrint payload.

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:07.816 A:middle
And new in iOS 10, we have
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacons

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
as a way to discover
printers using Bluetooth

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:11.796 A:middle
low-energy beacons.

00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:16.336 A:middle
Configuring a DNS server

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.176 A:middle
to advertise AirPrint
printers is easy.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:22.516 A:middle
First, the configured DNS
server must be in the list

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:24.956 A:middle
of DNS servers used
by the iOS devices

00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:26.566 A:middle
and Macs you want
printers to appear.

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:30.186 A:middle
There are lots of ways to
manage which DNS servers

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:34.686 A:middle
and search domains are used,
such as DHCP or MDM profiles.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:41.446 A:middle
And next you want to add A
or AAAA records to the name

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:44.876 A:middle
of the printer and the printer
setup with a static IP address.

00:07:46.936 --> 00:07:50.066 A:middle
Add a PTR record for the
main IPPS service type

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:53.136 A:middle
and one additional PTR record
for the universal subtype.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.046 A:middle
This is key for AirPrint
because AirPrint isn't just an

00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:57.916 A:middle
IPPS service.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
It has a subtype of universal

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
It has a subtype of universal

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:03.126 A:middle
and that's what iOS
devices and Mac search for.

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:09.526 A:middle
You'll add a SRV record for
the service and than a TXT

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:12.406 A:middle
or text record that
describes many capabilities

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:13.556 A:middle
and information about
the printer.

00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:18.336 A:middle
It's super important to
find the TXT or text record

00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:19.426 A:middle
of the printer or server,

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:22.626 A:middle
which can easily be accomplished
using the Command Line tool Mac

00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:24.116 A:middle
OS, dns-sd.

00:08:24.116 --> 00:08:30.796 A:middle
To use dns-sd to figure out the
records, just run this command

00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:33.006 A:middle
on the same subnet as the
printer you're setting up.

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:37.076 A:middle
You run with the -Z option
to display the records

00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:41.405 A:middle
in zone file format and
you'll use the underscore tcp.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:45.916 A:middle
underscore ipps.service
type in the local domain,

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:47.256 A:middle
like shown here in blue.

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:50.806 A:middle
This is the output you'll get

00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:52.676 A:middle
for each printer that's
discovered locally.

00:08:53.996 --> 00:08:58.176 A:middle
These are almost the PTR, SRV,
and TXT records you'll need

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
to add to DNS server
with a couple additions.

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
to add to DNS server
with a couple additions.

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:05.246 A:middle
The changes are highlighted
here in green.

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:08.456 A:middle
As I mentioned, you'll add
an additional PTR record

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:11.836 A:middle
for the universal subtype, like
this one on the second line.

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:16.086 A:middle
You'll also replace the local
printer name in the SRV record

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
with the fully-qualified
domain name,

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:22.326 A:middle
the A record I mentioned
earlier, and you'll also need

00:09:22.326 --> 00:09:25.296 A:middle
to replace any other instances
of the local Bonjour name

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:28.706 A:middle
with this fully-qualified domain
name, like I have shown here

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:31.026 A:middle
in green, with the
printer's administration URL.

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:35.846 A:middle
If this isn't fixed, users
won't be able to use the button

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:38.116 A:middle
in Mac OS that quickly
takes them

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:39.786 A:middle
to the printer's admin webpage.

00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:43.766 A:middle
And so this is the text here
that could be copied right

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.616 A:middle
into a zone file and a
printer will appear in the list

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:47.836 A:middle
of printers for your users,

00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:50.056 A:middle
if they have this
DNS server configured

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:51.816 A:middle
as one of their DNS servers.

00:09:52.456 --> 00:09:55.166 A:middle
So the key to setting up
Wide-Area Bonjour printers is

00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:58.246 A:middle
to get some help from the
dns-sd Command Line tool.

00:10:01.696 --> 00:10:04.796 A:middle
MDM profiles are very
popular and a super easy way

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:06.376 A:middle
to configure printers
for your users.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.736 A:middle
The AirPrint payload can
be added to any profile

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.016 A:middle
and that payload
consists of a host

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:14.336 A:middle
or IP address and
a resource path.

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:20.036 A:middle
The resource path is ipp/print
for most AirPrint printers,

00:10:20.896 --> 00:10:22.866 A:middle
and for an AirPrint server,
this will be the queue.

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:27.846 A:middle
And the screenshot shown
here is Apple Configurator,

00:10:28.286 --> 00:10:31.016 A:middle
one of the most popular Mobile
Device Management tools.

00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:35.746 A:middle
Next we have a new
technology we're really excited

00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:37.306 A:middle
about that's new in iOS 10

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:39.266 A:middle
and that's the AirPrint
Bluetooth Beacon.

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
So what is an AirPrint Bluetooth
Beacon, and how does it work?

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:47.476 A:middle
Well, it can be configured
using one

00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:49.936 A:middle
of the many third-party
Bluetooth beacon devices

00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:53.806 A:middle
available on the market and
set next to or near a printer

00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:57.116 A:middle
or can it be built into the
printer itself using the

00:10:57.116 --> 00:10:59.036 A:middle
printer's built-in
radios and antennas.

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:02.226 A:middle
And future AirPrint printers
will have this capability built

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:02.226 A:middle
And future AirPrint printers
will have this capability built

00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:03.986 A:middle
right in.

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:07.336 A:middle
What it does is beacon out
the connection information.

00:11:08.026 --> 00:11:11.546 A:middle
And if the iPhone can
reach that IP address,

00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.686 A:middle
the printer will be
accessible to send jobs to.

00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:18.436 A:middle
This is really powerful
because the network complexities

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:19.096 A:middle
don't matter.

00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:21.666 A:middle
All that matters is that
the IP address is reachable.

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:25.146 A:middle
This could even be a public
IP address on the Internet.

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:28.206 A:middle
So long as the iOS device
is in Bluetooth range

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:30.206 A:middle
and the IP address
is accessible,

00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:31.836 A:middle
the printer will show up
as an available printer

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:32.996 A:middle
on the list for users.

00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:38.546 A:middle
And the AirPrint Beacon works
great with print servers too.

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:44.046 A:middle
Here we have an AirPrint server
on the right, and each printer

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:46.266 A:middle
on the network has an
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:49.076 A:middle
which is advertising
the server's IP address

00:11:49.546 --> 00:11:51.616 A:middle
and the Queue ID
associated with that printer.

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:56.726 A:middle
When the user prints, the
job goes to the print server

00:11:57.696 --> 00:12:02.716 A:middle
with the queue information, and
then the server sends the job

00:11:57.696 --> 00:12:02.716 A:middle
with the queue information, and
then the server sends the job

00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:05.496 A:middle
to the associated printer that
the user has chosen in the UI.

00:12:09.166 --> 00:12:11.816 A:middle
Let's go into detail about what
the AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon

00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:14.356 A:middle
format is so you can set
these up for your printers.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.316 A:middle
First, we have a header.

00:12:19.046 --> 00:12:23.516 A:middle
This is what identifies this BLE
beacon as an AirPrint Beacon.

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:27.046 A:middle
It's the same for all
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacons,

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.306 A:middle
so this can just be copied.

00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:32.486 A:middle
Next, we have the
connection information.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:35.036 A:middle
This tells whether the
IP address found later

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:38.586 A:middle
in the beacon is an IPv4
address or an IPv6 address.

00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:42.216 A:middle
It also tells whether the
IP address is for a server

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:44.836 A:middle
or identifies a printer
and this byte identifies

00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:47.026 A:middle
if the connection
must be TLS encrypted.

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:51.006 A:middle
For this example, the
connection is TLS encrypted,

00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:54.186 A:middle
the IP address is
an IPv6 address,

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:55.816 A:middle
and this is not a server.

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
See the specification
published on developer.apple.com

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
See the specification
published on developer.apple.com

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:02.646 A:middle
for how this byte is set up.

00:13:05.696 --> 00:13:07.976 A:middle
Next we have a printer
ID if this job should go

00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:11.896 A:middle
to a print server or information
about the resource path

00:13:11.896 --> 00:13:13.266 A:middle
if this is directly
to a printer.

00:13:14.936 --> 00:13:18.156 A:middle
This printer has ipp/print
as the resource path.

00:13:19.356 --> 00:13:22.936 A:middle
Again, see the specification
published for more details

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:25.356 A:middle
about specifying resource paths.

00:13:28.076 --> 00:13:29.906 A:middle
Next we have the port
for the connection;

00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:33.536 A:middle
631 is the standard IPP port.

00:13:34.176 --> 00:13:37.736 A:middle
Port 443 is often used for
TLS secure connections.

00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:43.456 A:middle
For this example, 277
is hexadecimal for 631,

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.466 A:middle
which is the standard IPP port.

00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:50.186 A:middle
And next we have the IP address.

00:13:50.676 --> 00:13:55.326 A:middle
If you're using a non-updatable
external beacon for the printer,

00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:57.716 A:middle
make sure the printer
has a static IP address.

00:13:58.396 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
Otherwise, this IP in the
beacon will become stale

00:13:58.396 --> 00:14:01.036 A:middle
Otherwise, this IP in the
beacon will become stale

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:02.486 A:middle
when the IP address changes.

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:09.276 A:middle
And last, like iBeacon, we have
a measured signal strength value

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:10.076 A:middle
at 1 meter.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:14.536 A:middle
This uses the same methodology
as Apple iBeacon measured power.

00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:17.606 A:middle
This gives the iOS
device better information

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.216 A:middle
about the physical
distance of the printer.

00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:23.536 A:middle
For this example, the
transmission power was found

00:14:23.536 --> 00:14:27.666 A:middle
to be on average 64 decibels,
which is 40 in hexadecimal.

00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:32.106 A:middle
The format of the AirPrint
Bluetooth Beacon is somewhat

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:33.116 A:middle
similar to iBeacon.

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:37.406 A:middle
iBeacon format is
one byte shorter,

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:39.556 A:middle
but the beginning
header is very similar.

00:14:41.236 --> 00:14:43.396 A:middle
If you're following setup
instructions for a device

00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:46.636 A:middle
with iBeacon technology,
you may be able to adjust

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.436 A:middle
and use a similar setup for
the AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon,

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:54.036 A:middle
and many manufacturers of
Bluetooth hardware have

00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:56.406 A:middle
or will have specific
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon

00:14:56.406 --> 00:14:57.536 A:middle
setup procedures.

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:02.016 A:middle
So for enterprise users, iOS

00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:04.286 A:middle
and Mac OS provides
many great technologies

00:15:04.286 --> 00:15:07.576 A:middle
to support PDF workflows for
an increasingly digital world.

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:11.856 A:middle
And AirPrint provides great
security, access control,

00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:14.486 A:middle
accounting, and new
discovery technologies

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:16.456 A:middle
to make printing great
in any environment.

00:15:17.796 --> 00:15:19.736 A:middle
