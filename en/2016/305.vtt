00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:29.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, good afternoon.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:35.916 A:middle
Good afternoon, and welcome to
What's New in iTunes Connect.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:37.696 A:middle
I'm Dave Van Tassell,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.686 A:middle
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:42.606 A:middle
I'm excited to spend some times
this afternoon talking to you

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.676 A:middle
about what we've been up
to and where we're headed.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:50.046 A:middle
Now iTunes Connect covers the
whole lifespan of your app,

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:52.996 A:middle
from uploading the metadata,
submitting to App Review,

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:55.736 A:middle
releasing your app onto the
App Store, and even tracking

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:57.316 A:middle
to see how well you're
doing on the App Store.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:00:59.546 A:middle
And so, today we're
going to touch on a few

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.176 A:middle
of these different
pieces of iTunes Connect.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.176 A:middle
of these different
pieces of iTunes Connect.

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:06.896 A:middle
We're going to start with
all the changes we're making

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:10.896 A:middle
to in-app purchases and
also talk a little bit

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.236 A:middle
about iTunes Connect for iOS,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.486 A:middle
our mobile companion
app to iTunes Connect.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:21.596 A:middle
We're also going to
talk about App Analytics

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.626 A:middle
and what's new with
App Analytics.

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:29.356 A:middle
And then something
completely different and new,

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:30.966 A:middle
which is screenshot
simplification,

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:34.076 A:middle
and this is about the
rules and requirements

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.966 A:middle
about uploading images and
app previews for your app.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
We want to talk a little
bit about iMessage apps,

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
what you have to do in iTunes
Connect in order to set up

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.486 A:middle
and submit your iMessage apps.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.996 A:middle
And then we're going to finish
off with the updated guidelines.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:53.706 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:56.646 A:middle
We're going to talk
about in-app purchases,

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.886 A:middle
and the first area we're going
to talk about are subscriptions.

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.356 A:middle
Now when we talk
about subscriptions,

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.356 A:middle
Now when we talk
about subscriptions,

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:04.026 A:middle
what we're talking about are
autorenewable in-app purchases,

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:07.306 A:middle
and the biggest change we made
there is we're opening them

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
up to all categories.

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:11.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:16.086 A:middle
So no longer is it
only a few categories

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:17.006 A:middle
that can use autorenewables.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:18.716 A:middle
Everybody's eligible
to use them.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:22.156 A:middle
Now we're also introducing
a new feature

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:25.966 A:middle
so that you can price your
subscriptions differently

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:26.966 A:middle
in each territory.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.286 A:middle
Instead of selecting one price
tier for all the territories,

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:33.856 A:middle
you can select individual
price tiers for each territory.

00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:37.246 A:middle
And to go along with that, we're
actually increasing the number

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.766 A:middle
of available price
tiers for autorenewables

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.636 A:middle
to over 200 different
price tiers,

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:44.556 A:middle
and this should really let
you pick the right price

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:48.716 A:middle
in the right country
for your subscriptions

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:49.906 A:middle
and your subscribers.

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.196 A:middle
Another new feature we're adding

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.716 A:middle
to the subscriptions is
called price preservation.

00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:59.296 A:middle
Now this is for your
existing subscribers.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:02.896 A:middle
When you raise the price of a
subscription, you can choose

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:02.896 A:middle
When you raise the price of a
subscription, you can choose

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.366 A:middle
if you want them to also
pay this new, higher price,

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:09.056 A:middle
or you can let them keep
their existing price

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:12.036 A:middle
so when they renew,
they will continue

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:13.656 A:middle
to pay their existing price.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:19.506 A:middle
And the last change we're making
is for subscribers who have been

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:20.686 A:middle
with you for over a year.

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:24.476 A:middle
When they renew,
they'll get 85 percent

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.036 A:middle
of the proceeds, and
this is live now.

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:31.406 A:middle
So you no longer have to
wait 12 months until works.

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:32.956 A:middle
Anyone who's already
been subscribing

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:35.736 A:middle
to your in-app purchase for
more than year, when they renew

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:37.136 A:middle
with their next subscription
period,

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:38.976 A:middle
you will receive 85
percent of those proceeds.

00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.171 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:41.836 A:middle
This is a good one.

00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:44.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.716 A:middle
Now there's actually so much
to talk about with the changes

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:51.876 A:middle
to subscriptions we've
created two sessions

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.036 A:middle
that are dedicated just to this.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.666 A:middle
The first is a more
technical deep dive and how

00:03:55.666 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
to actually program a
StoreKit, work with it in Swift,

00:03:55.666 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
to actually program a
StoreKit, work with it in Swift,

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.536 A:middle
check your receipt,
and validation.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:03.646 A:middle
It's a great session.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:07.066 A:middle
The second one is more about
what subscriptions actually are

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:10.406 A:middle
and how to set up all this new
information in iTunes Connect.

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:15.586 A:middle
To change the price in
different territories

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:18.995 A:middle
and preserve your price, so
these are both on Tuesday.

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
If you didn't get a
chance to see them,

00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.625 A:middle
then I highly recommend
you check it out.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:26.356 A:middle
And those are the changes
we have for subscriptions.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:28.456 A:middle
Now this next change
is applicable

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:30.016 A:middle
to all in-app purchases,

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:31.716 A:middle
and this is in-app
purchase promo codes.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:36.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.546 A:middle
In-app purchase promo
codes are going to live

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.206 A:middle
in iTunes Connect right next to
where you get the promo codes

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:43.996 A:middle
for your app versions.

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:48.166 A:middle
So you go to the features
tab for your app, and up top,

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.066 A:middle
you have where you can
select your promo codes

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.046 A:middle
for your app version.

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.106 A:middle
And then down below,
we're going to let you set

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.886 A:middle
up in-app purchase promo codes.

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:57.606 A:middle
The first thing you
do is you select

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.686 A:middle
which in-app purchase you
want to get a promo code for.

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.686 A:middle
which in-app purchase you
want to get a promo code for.

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.696 A:middle
I'm going to do Dream
Trips to Europe.

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:04.916 A:middle
I just need the one right now.

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:08.346 A:middle
And so we go through
the next step.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:09.506 A:middle
It's how many promo
codes do you want?

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.636 A:middle
So we can select in here.

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:14.226 A:middle
I think right now I need 25.

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:15.546 A:middle
That ought to do it.

00:05:17.086 --> 00:05:17.856 A:middle
And that's it.

00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:19.536 A:middle
Now I'm ready to
generate my promo codes.

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:22.666 A:middle
I can download them as a text
file and distribute those,

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:26.606 A:middle
and people can download my
in-app purchase via promo code.

00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:29.806 A:middle
Now this feature, as well
as the rest of the changes

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:32.386 A:middle
to subscriptions, will be
available later this fall.

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:36.896 A:middle
And those are our changes
to in-app purchase.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:41.786 A:middle
Now the next thing
I want to talk

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:43.736 A:middle
about is iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:46.736 A:middle
And to do that, I'm
going to introduce Mike

00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:48.046 A:middle
on state to tell you more.

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:48.726 A:middle
Mike?

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:56.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dave.

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:58.096 A:middle
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:05:58.186 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
My name is Mike Amirault, and I
am very excited to be here today

00:05:58.186 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
My name is Mike Amirault, and I
am very excited to be here today

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:04.396 A:middle
to talk to you about
iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:06.586 A:middle
Before I begin, how many of you

00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:09.336 A:middle
out there have downloaded
and used our app?

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:10.656 A:middle
All right.

00:06:10.656 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
Quite a few.

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:12.646 A:middle
We'll try to get the rest of you

00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:14.236 A:middle
to download it before
this session's over.

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:17.266 A:middle
For those of you who
haven't downloaded it,

00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:20.316 A:middle
let me give you a brief
description about what it does.

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.556 A:middle
iTunes Connect for iOS is
our mobile companion app

00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:26.106 A:middle
to the iTunes Connect website.

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:29.896 A:middle
It allows you on-the-go access
to your sales and trends,

00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:34.296 A:middle
ratings and reviews
for all your apps,

00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:37.576 A:middle
the ability to reject a
binary or at least your app

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:40.566 A:middle
for the store, and
push notifications,

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.836 A:middle
so you can be immediately
notified

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:45.726 A:middle
of any changes to your apps.

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:50.546 A:middle
It is available for
free in the App Store.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:51.866 A:middle
Let's talk about what's new.

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:55.646 A:middle
In the past year, we
released many new features

00:06:55.646 --> 00:06:58.706 A:middle
for the mobile app, but
there's three that I would

00:06:58.706 --> 00:06:59.936 A:middle
like to highlight for you today.

00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:07.206 A:middle
First, new push notifications,
second, multiprovider support,

00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:11.736 A:middle
and third, full access
to Resolution Center

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.476 A:middle
within the mobile app.

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:15.176 A:middle
Let's look at each of these.

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:19.886 A:middle
New push notifications,
we added three new types

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:21.696 A:middle
of push notifications
in the past year.

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:28.476 A:middle
First, if your app contracts
are about to expire, second,

00:07:28.476 --> 00:07:30.436 A:middle
if you get a message
from our App Review team,

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:32.956 A:middle
you can now get a push
notification so you can deal

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:34.316 A:middle
with the issue immediately.

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:39.026 A:middle
And lastly, and this has been
a developer favorite so far,

00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:41.026 A:middle
you can get a push notification

00:07:41.386 --> 00:07:44.216 A:middle
when your app has finished
input processing for the store.

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:48.046 --> 00:07:48.996 A:middle
I know. It's the little things.

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:53.396 A:middle
So let's talk about
multiprovider support.

00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:54.916 A:middle
What does that mean?

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:57.866 A:middle
Some of you work on apps
for more than one provider.

00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:00.406 A:middle
In the past, this was
not the easiest thing

00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:00.406 A:middle
In the past, this was
not the easiest thing

00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:01.036 A:middle
in the world to do.

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:03.356 A:middle
You would have to have
a separate user account,

00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:06.036 A:middle
and you would have to
log out and log back in,

00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:07.676 A:middle
in order to see all your apps.

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:11.606 A:middle
With multiprovider support,
you can one account,

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:13.126 A:middle
and you can have it associated

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.336 A:middle
with all the providers
that you work for.

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:19.636 A:middle
I'd like to show you how
that works in the mobile app.

00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:23.836 A:middle
When you log in, we'll
automatically set the provider

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.586 A:middle
to the last one that
you logged in with.

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:29.816 A:middle
If you want to change it,
simply tap on the settings icon

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:34.556 A:middle
in the bottom right, and then
tap on the providers line.

00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:38.405 A:middle
This will show you all
the providers associated

00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:39.166 A:middle
with your account.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:45.006 A:middle
Simply pick the one you want,
and now you're seeing content

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:46.186 A:middle
for just that provider.

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.956 A:middle
Now push notifications
are unique per provider.

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:52.086 A:middle
So you can turn them on
for some of your providers

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:53.596 A:middle
or turn them off for others.

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:56.176 A:middle
It's completely up to you
how you want to set it up.

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:01.036 A:middle
So that's multiprovider support,
and I hope that helps those

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:01.036 A:middle
So that's multiprovider support,
and I hope that helps those

00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:03.106 A:middle
of you that work with
more than one provider.

00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:08.216 A:middle
Resolution Center, this was the
biggest new feature we've added

00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:11.146 A:middle
in the past year, full
access to resolution center

00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:12.666 A:middle
within the mobile app.

00:09:13.026 --> 00:09:14.226 A:middle
Let me show you what
that looks like.

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:19.316 A:middle
Anywhere within the mobile
app where we display a list

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:23.376 A:middle
of your apps, either in recents,
favorites, or search results,

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:27.306 A:middle
any of your apps that have
active Resolution Center issues

00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:28.886 A:middle
will be displayed
with a red badge.

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:31.026 A:middle
Let's tap into one of those.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:34.286 A:middle
So you can see at the top

00:09:34.286 --> 00:09:37.586 A:middle
of the view it gives you a
brief description of the number

00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:40.576 A:middle
of active issues you have and
which platform they're on.

00:09:40.896 --> 00:09:41.956 A:middle
Let's tap on that header.

00:09:44.696 --> 00:09:46.856 A:middle
Here you can see the
full text of the issue,

00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:49.056 A:middle
and you can get a
complete history

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:50.956 A:middle
of all the replies
associated with it.

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:54.676 A:middle
If you tap on the reply
icon in the top right,

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.996 A:middle
you have the option here
to forward this issue

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:02.666 A:middle
on through email to another
member of your team to look at,

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:02.666 A:middle
on through email to another
member of your team to look at,

00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:08.006 A:middle
or you can reply directly
within the mobile app

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:10.526 A:middle
to the App Review team.

00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
When App Review responds, you
can get a push notification

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:18.706 A:middle
so you can deal with
the issue immediately.

00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:23.426 A:middle
So that's the Resolution
Center feature.

00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:24.976 A:middle
It's just one of the three --

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:30.996 A:middle
So that's the Resolution
Center feature.

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:34.686 A:middle
Now let's talk about
what's coming next.

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:41.176 A:middle
Now there's one feature
that's been at or near the top

00:10:41.176 --> 00:10:46.236 A:middle
of this list for most
developers, sales and proceeds,

00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:50.396 A:middle
the ability to see exactly
how much money you're making

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:54.636 A:middle
in gross sales and proceeds
directly within the mobile app.

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:57.646 A:middle
I am happy to say that
this feature will be coming

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.976 A:middle
in our next release, and I would
like to show it to you now.

00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:06.226 A:middle
So this is the Sales and
Trends module as it looks

00:11:06.226 --> 00:11:07.176 A:middle
when you sign in today.

00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:10.616 A:middle
On the left side, you'll
see the number of downloads

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:13.646 A:middle
for each line item, and on
the right side in the red

00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:16.606 A:middle
and green rectangles,
you see the delta change

00:11:16.636 --> 00:11:18.676 A:middle
between the current
period you're looking at

00:11:18.676 --> 00:11:19.836 A:middle
and the previous period.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:23.966 A:middle
Much like the stocks app,
if you tap on one of the red

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:26.406 A:middle
and green rectangles, you
can change the display.

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:31.116 A:middle
So let's tap on it, and now
we're looking at proceeds

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.276 A:middle
for each of these line items.

00:11:32.896 --> 00:11:37.216 A:middle
If we tap on it again, now we're
seeing the gross sales figures.

00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.146 A:middle
As we tap through
the various displays,

00:11:40.146 --> 00:11:42.726 A:middle
the graph at the bottom
of the page will change

00:11:42.726 --> 00:11:44.606 A:middle
to represent the dimension
that you're looking at.

00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:47.376 A:middle
Let's look at top products.

00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:51.606 A:middle
Here we're showing the
gross sales numbers

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:53.046 A:middle
for your top products.

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:57.796 A:middle
This will allow you to easily
see exactly how much money your

00:11:57.796 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
most popular apps are
generating for you, and again,

00:11:57.796 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
most popular apps are
generating for you, and again,

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.976 A:middle
you can tap the red or
green rectangles to change

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.446 A:middle
between sales, proceeds,
and units.

00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:10.136 A:middle
Let's look at a specific app.

00:12:10.906 --> 00:12:12.166 A:middle
When you're looking
at a specific app,

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.816 A:middle
you can get the daily
sales breakdowns.

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:16.876 A:middle
Here we're showing the
number of downloads.

00:12:18.096 --> 00:12:22.476 A:middle
If we tap on the view line,
we can switch between units,

00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:24.486 A:middle
proceeds, sales, and updates.

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:30.396 A:middle
Let's look at sales.

00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:31.166 A:middle
Then we hit back.

00:12:31.746 --> 00:12:33.596 A:middle
So now we're displaying
the gross sales numbers

00:12:34.136 --> 00:12:35.286 A:middle
on a per day basis.

00:12:36.466 --> 00:12:39.426 A:middle
So that's our new sales
and proceeds feature.

00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:41.786 A:middle
It will be available
in our next release,

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:44.776 A:middle
and we know you've been
waiting for it for a while,

00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:47.646 A:middle
so it'll be available today.

00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:53.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:56.966 A:middle
Now since we're going to be
releasing this feature today,

00:12:57.266 --> 00:12:59.576 A:middle
I'd like to take this
opportunity to demonstrate

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:02.336 A:middle
for you my favorite
feature of our mobile app,

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:02.336 A:middle
for you my favorite
feature of our mobile app,

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:03.856 A:middle
and that's the ability

00:13:03.856 --> 00:13:06.016 A:middle
to release your app
for the App Store.

00:13:07.926 --> 00:13:11.136 A:middle
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you

00:13:11.136 --> 00:13:15.666 A:middle
on the current version
of iTunes Connect for iOS

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:19.486 A:middle
to release the new version
of iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:20.976 A:middle
So we're going to do that now.

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:26.836 A:middle
First off, you want
to find your app.

00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:30.596 A:middle
Mine's very easy to find because
naturally it's in my favorites.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.646 A:middle
And you can see we
have two versions.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.056 A:middle
One is currently
live on the store.

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:37.266 A:middle
We don't want to be
downloading that one right now.

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:39.936 A:middle
And our second one is
pending developer release.

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:42.626 A:middle
So let's look at
our new version.

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:46.006 A:middle
And you can see we
have two options here.

00:13:46.356 --> 00:13:49.556 A:middle
We can either release this
version, or reject the binary.

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:51.356 A:middle
We don't want to reject
the binary right now.

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:53.726 A:middle
So we're going to tap
on release this version,

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:56.886 A:middle
and it will give us
a confirmation panel

00:13:56.926 --> 00:13:59.336 A:middle
because we don't want you
to accidentally reject

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
or release your binary.

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
or release your binary.

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:02.466 A:middle
And we're going to
tap on release.

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:04.706 A:middle
And there it is.

00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:05.896 A:middle
The app is now ready for sale.

00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:11.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:13.716 A:middle
So the app is now
live in the App Store,

00:14:13.716 --> 00:14:15.726 A:middle
and it'll be available
for download shortly,

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:18.646 A:middle
and I'm now going to hand
you back over to Dave.

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:19.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:14:19.796 --> 00:14:20.286 A:middle
Thanks, Mike.

00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:23.736 A:middle
That's what's coming up
in iTunes Connect for iOS,

00:14:24.126 --> 00:14:25.796 A:middle
with enhanced notification
support,

00:14:26.196 --> 00:14:27.986 A:middle
Resolution Center built
right into the app,

00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:31.386 A:middle
as well as the just released
sales and proceeds updates.

00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:35.796 A:middle
So I'm going to talk about
App Analytics, and it's hard

00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:37.796 A:middle
to believe that it's
been just over a year

00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:40.756 A:middle
since this has become
such a great tool

00:14:40.866 --> 00:14:42.076 A:middle
in iTunes Connect Toolbox.

00:14:43.336 --> 00:14:45.786 A:middle
And to talk more about what
is new with App Analytics,

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:48.176 A:middle
I'm going to invite
David on stage.

00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:48.786 A:middle
David?

00:14:49.516 --> 00:14:51.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:52.296 --> 00:14:52.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:14:52.656 --> 00:14:53.176 A:middle
Thanks, Dave.

00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.246 A:middle
I'm David Hopkins, and I'm going
to talk to you a little bit

00:14:56.246 --> 00:14:58.496 A:middle
about what's new
in App Analytics.

00:14:58.996 --> 00:15:02.506 A:middle
For those of you who
haven't used App Analytics,

00:14:58.996 --> 00:15:02.506 A:middle
For those of you who
haven't used App Analytics,

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:04.446 A:middle
it's available as a
part of iTunes Connect.

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:05.776 A:middle
It's free.

00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:08.116 A:middle
There's no integration
required, no SDK,

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.826 A:middle
and it has customer
privacy built in.

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:15.246 A:middle
So let's talk about
why App Analytics.

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:16.776 A:middle
Why are analytics important?

00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:20.576 A:middle
First, analytics
provides answers.

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.386 A:middle
Are customers finding my app?

00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:24.466 A:middle
Are customers downloading
my app?

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.646 A:middle
Are they using my app?

00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:26.656 A:middle
How stable is my app?

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:28.476 A:middle
These are some of the questions

00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:29.996 A:middle
that App Analytics
can help you answer.

00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:34.826 A:middle
Next, App Analytics reveals
missed opportunities.

00:15:35.326 --> 00:15:37.666 A:middle
Perhaps you have a large
customer base in Japan,

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:38.646 A:middle
and you didn't realize

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.526 A:middle
that customers were
using your app in Japan.

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:42.936 A:middle
Well, that's an opportunity
for you to go

00:15:42.936 --> 00:15:44.506 A:middle
and localize your
app to Japanese.

00:15:44.876 --> 00:15:49.266 A:middle
And App Analytics can help you
find opportunities like this.

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:52.386 A:middle
Next, App Analytics helps
you build a better app.

00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:55.036 A:middle
There's been a lot of great
sessions this week helping you

00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:56.666 A:middle
design and build great apps.

00:15:56.886 --> 00:15:59.396 A:middle
But we believe that building
great apps doesn't just stop

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:00.826 A:middle
when you release
the first version.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:00.826 A:middle
when you release
the first version.

00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:05.056 A:middle
It's important to continue
to iterate on your app,

00:16:05.056 --> 00:16:07.776 A:middle
and App Analytics can
provide you the information

00:16:07.826 --> 00:16:09.636 A:middle
to make great decisions
moving forward.

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:15.126 A:middle
So let's talk about the types of
analytics data that we provide.

00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:18.156 A:middle
First, we provide
App Store data.

00:16:18.806 --> 00:16:21.216 A:middle
This is data about how many
times your app is being viewed

00:16:21.216 --> 00:16:23.886 A:middle
on the App Store, how many
customers are purchasing

00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:24.806 A:middle
your app.

00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:28.436 A:middle
Next, we provide sales data.

00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:31.146 A:middle
This is data about how much
money customers are spending

00:16:31.146 --> 00:16:35.806 A:middle
in your app, how many users
are spending money in your app,

00:16:35.806 --> 00:16:39.256 A:middle
and how much -- and how many
in-app purchases are occurring

00:16:39.256 --> 00:16:40.966 A:middle
in your app.

00:16:41.026 --> 00:16:43.126 A:middle
And finally, there's usage data.

00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:46.206 A:middle
This is data about how
frequently customers are using

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.476 A:middle
your app, what your
customer retention is like,

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:50.396 A:middle
and how stable your app is.

00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:53.896 A:middle
So with this data, we're able
to provide you data all the way

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:55.716 A:middle
from the time that
you're acquiring customers

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:58.396 A:middle
with App Store data
down to engaging

00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
with customers with usage data.

00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
with customers with usage data.

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:02.946 A:middle
But today, we're primarily
going to be focused

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:04.695 A:middle
on updates to App Store data.

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:10.425 A:middle
And App Store data starts
with product page views.

00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:15.156 A:middle
Every time a customer views your
App Store page on the App Store,

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.006 A:middle
this registers a
product page view.

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:20.516 A:middle
So, for example, we have
our app, Trip Guide,

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.935 A:middle
and this is our product page.

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:23.185 A:middle
Customer views this.

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.036 A:middle
This would count as
a product page view.

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:28.916 A:middle
If a customer goes on to
purchase our app, it's $3.99.

00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
They purchase our app.

00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:32.136 A:middle
This would count as an app unit.

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:35.186 A:middle
So app units help you track
the number of new users

00:17:35.186 --> 00:17:37.226 A:middle
that you have in any
given time period.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.146 A:middle
So this helps you understand
your App Store presence.

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:42.356 A:middle
You're able to see
the number of times

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:43.626 A:middle
that your product
page was viewed.

00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:45.866 A:middle
You're able to see the
number of new users you have.

00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:49.846 A:middle
But it doesn't tell the whole
story of your App Store presence

00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:52.696 A:middle
because it doesn't tell
you all the other places

00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:55.006 A:middle
in the App Store that
customers can view your app.

00:17:55.346 --> 00:17:57.486 A:middle
And so, to help you
understand that,

00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:00.976 A:middle
we're introducing a new
measure called impressions.

00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:00.976 A:middle
we're introducing a new
measure called impressions.

00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:07.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:07.576 --> 00:18:10.606 A:middle
So impressions are going to
show you the number of times

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:12.926 A:middle
that customers have viewed
your app on the App Store.

00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:15.716 A:middle
So we talked about one way
that customers view your apps.

00:18:15.716 --> 00:18:17.476 A:middle
That's your product page.

00:18:17.476 --> 00:18:19.186 A:middle
But let's talk about other ways

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:20.846 A:middle
that customers view your
app on the App Store.

00:18:22.176 --> 00:18:23.506 A:middle
First, there's search.

00:18:24.086 --> 00:18:26.426 A:middle
A customer searches for
guides, for example,

00:18:26.696 --> 00:18:28.876 A:middle
and our app Trip Guide shows
up in the search results.

00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:30.796 A:middle
This will count as an
impression as well.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:35.526 A:middle
If you're taking advantage
of the new search ads

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.326 A:middle
and your app shows up in
search results this way,

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.986 A:middle
this will also count
as an impression.

00:18:40.546 --> 00:18:44.706 A:middle
If your app shows up
in the category section

00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:48.726 A:middle
or in our top charts or
featured, these are all ways

00:18:48.726 --> 00:18:51.866 A:middle
that will register
impressions in App Analytics.

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:55.176 A:middle
So this is the new
feature impressions.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.266 A:middle
Let's take a look at what this
looks like in the product.

00:18:57.266 --> 00:19:00.096 A:middle
This is the App List.

00:18:57.266 --> 00:19:00.096 A:middle
This is the App List.

00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:03.626 A:middle
This the entry point to
the App Analytics product.

00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:07.506 A:middle
From here, you can see a
snapshot across all of your iOS

00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:10.256 A:middle
and Apple TV apps
across five key measures,

00:19:10.536 --> 00:19:11.926 A:middle
starting with your impressions

00:19:11.956 --> 00:19:13.596 A:middle
to see how many customers
are viewing your app

00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.516 A:middle
on the App Store, app units

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:17.256 A:middle
to tell you how many
new users you have,

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:21.056 A:middle
sales to tell you how much
money customers are spending in

00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:24.716 A:middle
or on your app, sessions to tell
you how many times customers

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:27.916 A:middle
have opened your app, and
crashes to give you an idea

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.706 A:middle
of how stable your app is.

00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:33.416 A:middle
We show you the value for
the current period as well

00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:35.486 A:middle
as the percentage change
from the previous period

00:19:35.706 --> 00:19:38.876 A:middle
to help you understand whether
this number is good or bad.

00:19:40.186 --> 00:19:41.536 A:middle
So we can see our
app, Trip Guide.

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:42.896 A:middle
It's in the first row here.

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:46.056 A:middle
And we can see that
in the last 30 days,

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:48.456 A:middle
we had around 300,000
impressions.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:51.716 A:middle
This is a 17 percent increase
from the previous period.

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:55.186 A:middle
If we want to find out more
information about this number,

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:56.796 A:middle
you can click into that number,

00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:58.546 A:middle
and it'll take you
to the metrics view.

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:02.406 A:middle
So the metrics view allows
you to see a little bit

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:02.406 A:middle
So the metrics view allows
you to see a little bit

00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:04.486 A:middle
of more information about
any of these numbers.

00:20:04.486 --> 00:20:06.986 A:middle
You can see this data
charted over time,

00:20:07.226 --> 00:20:10.526 A:middle
and you can also slice this
by various dimensions to see

00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:11.706 A:middle
if you want to see something --

00:20:11.706 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
drill down to something
more specific,

00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:17.016 A:middle
perhaps how many impression you
have just in the United States.

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:20.736 A:middle
In addition to providing
a count of impressions,

00:20:21.206 --> 00:20:25.346 A:middle
we're also providing unique
devices on impressions.

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:27.876 A:middle
So if you select
that, you'll filter

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.456 A:middle
down to just the unique
devices for impressions.

00:20:30.456 --> 00:20:33.086 A:middle
So if I were to view
my app Trip Guide

00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:35.976 A:middle
on the App Store three times
in one day on the same device,

00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:38.056 A:middle
that would count as
three impressions,

00:20:38.246 --> 00:20:40.316 A:middle
but one unique impression.

00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:45.196 A:middle
So if I select that, now I'm
viewing just the unique devices

00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:45.976 A:middle
for impressions.

00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:49.986 A:middle
This helps us better understand
the total number of customers

00:20:50.106 --> 00:20:52.206 A:middle
who are viewing our
app on the App Store

00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:53.396 A:middle
at any given time period.

00:20:54.446 --> 00:20:57.186 A:middle
With this, we can start
to compare that number

00:20:57.696 --> 00:21:00.556 A:middle
to the number of new users we
have, and then we can start

00:20:57.696 --> 00:21:00.556 A:middle
to the number of new users we
have, and then we can start

00:21:00.556 --> 00:21:03.006 A:middle
to understand our App
Store conversion rate,

00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:06.996 A:middle
how well our App Store presence
is converting to new users.

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:08.386 A:middle
So I'll walk you through that.

00:21:09.366 --> 00:21:13.086 A:middle
You can select compare to
and compare to app units.

00:21:14.336 --> 00:21:17.066 A:middle
Now you're viewing app units
compared to impressions

00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:19.226 A:middle
on the same graph, but
it'd be a little easier

00:21:19.226 --> 00:21:20.726 A:middle
to view this data as a ratio.

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:25.276 A:middle
So if you change from single
access and select ratio,

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:29.446 A:middle
now you can view this as
a ratio trended over time,

00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:31.696 A:middle
and we can see that
our app has about --

00:21:31.896 --> 00:21:35.746 A:middle
it takes about ten
impressions for one app unit.

00:21:35.856 --> 00:21:39.226 A:middle
And so, we can start to --
as we update our screenshots

00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:41.726 A:middle
and our description to our
App Store page, we can start

00:21:41.726 --> 00:21:45.366 A:middle
to see what effect that has on
our App Store conversion rate.

00:21:46.036 --> 00:21:50.066 A:middle
So that's the impression feature
and how you can start to use it

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
to look at your App
Store conversion rate.

00:21:51.916 --> 00:21:53.336 A:middle
And we're excited to announce

00:21:53.336 --> 00:21:55.796 A:middle
that all this is available
now in App Analytics.

00:21:56.516 --> 00:22:00.786 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:56.516 --> 00:22:00.786 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:03.756 A:middle
So let's talk about what's
next in App Analytics.

00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:07.196 A:middle
We've given you impressions to
help you understand the number

00:22:07.196 --> 00:22:09.386 A:middle
of customers that are viewing
your app on the App Store,

00:22:10.216 --> 00:22:11.296 A:middle
but the next question we want

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:15.916 A:middle
to help you answer is how
are customers finding my app?

00:22:16.096 --> 00:22:18.636 A:middle
And we do this today
with sources.

00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:22.136 A:middle
And so, let's talk about what
types of sources there are

00:22:22.136 --> 00:22:24.906 A:middle
for customers to find
your app on the App Store.

00:22:29.046 --> 00:22:31.586 A:middle
The first source is
browsing the App Store.

00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:33.426 A:middle
So we talked about
one example earlier

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:34.896 A:middle
with searching on the App Store.

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:35.986 A:middle
We've searched for guides.

00:22:36.256 --> 00:22:40.646 A:middle
That's one way that
customers discover your app.

00:22:40.906 --> 00:22:44.056 A:middle
Similarly, if we were to find
our app browsing the App Store

00:22:44.056 --> 00:22:47.676 A:middle
in the top charts, in featured,
in the categories section,

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.486 A:middle
these are all ways that
customers are finding your app

00:22:50.766 --> 00:22:52.106 A:middle
by browsing the App Store.

00:22:52.106 --> 00:22:56.256 A:middle
So that's one source for
customers to find your app.

00:22:56.436 --> 00:22:58.416 A:middle
But we recognize that
there are other ways

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:02.556 A:middle
that customers are finding your
apps outside of the App Store.

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:02.556 A:middle
that customers are finding your
apps outside of the App Store.

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:04.696 A:middle
And so, the first source
that we're going to talk

00:23:04.696 --> 00:23:07.426 A:middle
about outside of the
App Store are websites.

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:12.556 A:middle
So websites are tracked any
time a customer taps on a link

00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:15.336 A:middle
from a website in Mobile
Safari, and that takes you

00:23:15.336 --> 00:23:16.286 A:middle
to the App Store page.

00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:19.526 A:middle
This counts as a
source type of websites.

00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:23.836 A:middle
So we have our app Trip Guide
here, and we've included a link

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:25.996 A:middle
on our website,
TripGuide.Apple.com.

00:23:26.336 --> 00:23:29.576 A:middle
This would be a situation
where the source is website,

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.676 A:middle
and the website is
TripGuide.Apple.com.

00:23:32.206 --> 00:23:36.096 A:middle
So that's one source

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:40.426 A:middle
where customers can find your
app outside of the App Store.

00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:41.876 A:middle
The other source that
we're going to talk

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:44.046 A:middle
about for customers to
find your app outside

00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:46.976 A:middle
of the App Store are other apps.

00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:52.606 A:middle
So for example, we tweeted
about our app Trip Guide here,

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.706 A:middle
and we included a link
to our App Store page.

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:57.036 A:middle
We're trying to promote our
app socially on Twitter.

00:23:57.216 --> 00:23:58.486 A:middle
Someone follows that link.

00:23:58.486 --> 00:24:02.036 A:middle
That would be an
example of a case

00:23:58.486 --> 00:24:02.036 A:middle
That would be an
example of a case

00:24:02.036 --> 00:24:05.396 A:middle
where the source was another
app, and the app was Twitter.

00:24:06.906 --> 00:24:10.456 A:middle
Similarly, if customers are
sharing your app using mail,

00:24:10.556 --> 00:24:13.856 A:middle
if you're taking advantage
of the new messages features

00:24:13.856 --> 00:24:16.946 A:middle
in iOS 10 and customers are
sharing your app on messages,

00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:18.786 A:middle
these are other examples

00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:21.086 A:middle
of where the source
would be another app

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.646 A:middle
for customers to find your app.

00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:25.726 A:middle
And the apps here would
be mail and messages.

00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:28.866 A:middle
Okay. So those are the
three sources types

00:24:28.866 --> 00:24:31.306 A:middle
for how customers
are find your apps.

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:32.586 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we plan

00:24:32.586 --> 00:24:37.326 A:middle
to visualize this
in the product.

00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:39.616 A:middle
First, if you've been
using the product today,

00:24:39.796 --> 00:24:41.516 A:middle
you're probably familiar
with this view.

00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:43.816 A:middle
This is the list of
your top websites.

00:24:44.506 --> 00:24:46.126 A:middle
From here, you're able to see

00:24:46.126 --> 00:24:49.006 A:middle
which websites are driving
the most traffic to your app,

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:51.556 A:middle
and not only are you able to
see the number of impressions

00:24:51.626 --> 00:24:54.326 A:middle
that came from these websites,
but you're also able to see

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
that across your app units

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:58.586 A:middle
to understand how many new
users came from each website.

00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:00.616 A:middle
You're able to see the sales

00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:00.616 A:middle
You're able to see the sales

00:25:00.616 --> 00:25:03.056 A:middle
to understand how much money
these customers are spending

00:25:03.056 --> 00:25:04.266 A:middle
who came from each website.

00:25:04.426 --> 00:25:07.176 A:middle
And you're able to see sessions
so you can understand the usage

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:09.226 A:middle
from customers who
came from each website.

00:25:09.456 --> 00:25:12.616 A:middle
So we talked about the Twitter
mobile app as an example.

00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:16.516 A:middle
Well, if a customer also is
viewing your app and came

00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:19.196 A:middle
from Twitter.com in
Safari, this would show

00:25:19.196 --> 00:25:20.856 A:middle
up under your top websites.

00:25:21.156 --> 00:25:21.546 A:middle
All right.

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:25.106 A:middle
So that's the list
of your top websites.

00:25:25.366 --> 00:25:26.416 A:middle
Let's talk about how we plan

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
to visualize the list
of your top apps.

00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:32.656 A:middle
This is the App List.

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:37.606 A:middle
From here, you're able to view
the top apps that contributed

00:25:37.756 --> 00:25:40.086 A:middle
to traffic for customers
finding your app.

00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:43.206 A:middle
So we talked -- again,
we talked about Twitter,

00:25:43.206 --> 00:25:44.746 A:middle
the Twitter mobile app.

00:25:44.746 --> 00:25:45.536 A:middle
It'll show up here.

00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:48.916 A:middle
Messages, if that's a source
for customers finding your app,

00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:50.436 A:middle
this will show up here as well.

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.316 A:middle
So as you start to
promote your app

00:25:52.316 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
across many different
channels, you'll be able to view

00:25:56.416 --> 00:25:58.926 A:middle
which channels are the
most effective and be able

00:25:58.926 --> 00:26:02.016 A:middle
to compare them not just across
impressions, but across all

00:25:58.926 --> 00:26:02.016 A:middle
to compare them not just across
impressions, but across all

00:26:02.016 --> 00:26:03.956 A:middle
of the measures that
you have available

00:26:03.956 --> 00:26:04.936 A:middle
on App Analytics today.

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:10.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:12.496 --> 00:26:17.386 A:middle
So that's the new app sources
feature with the new top apps.

00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:18.786 A:middle
Next we're going to
talk about how we plan

00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:20.996 A:middle
to visualize the three sources

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.186 A:middle
that I talked to
you about before.

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:25.616 A:middle
And the first way is
with the Source Overview.

00:26:26.226 --> 00:26:29.716 A:middle
With the Source Overview, we're
planning to give you visibility

00:26:29.936 --> 00:26:32.406 A:middle
into each of these three sources
so that you can understand

00:26:32.666 --> 00:26:35.046 A:middle
which of these three
sources is contributing

00:26:35.046 --> 00:26:38.206 A:middle
to the most customers
discovering your app.

00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:41.626 A:middle
So you can see customers
who found your app

00:26:41.626 --> 00:26:44.386 A:middle
from browsing the App
Store, customers who came

00:26:44.386 --> 00:26:46.526 A:middle
from an app refer,
and customers who came

00:26:46.526 --> 00:26:48.576 A:middle
from a web refer,
all in one place.

00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:50.816 A:middle
And you can see a percentage
from each of those sources.

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:52.936 A:middle
Right now, we're
looking at impressions,

00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:56.136 A:middle
but you can also look at
any of the other measures.

00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:57.856 A:middle
So again, you can
look at your sales.

00:26:57.856 --> 00:26:59.976 A:middle
You can look at your sessions

00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:02.306 A:middle
and understand how
customers are using your app

00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:02.306 A:middle
and understand how
customers are using your app

00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:03.506 A:middle
that came from each source.

00:27:04.266 --> 00:27:07.286 A:middle
And so, we talked before about
the App Store conversion rate

00:27:07.286 --> 00:27:09.826 A:middle
and how you're able to look at
your App Store conversion rate.

00:27:10.196 --> 00:27:12.516 A:middle
Well, you could also look at
your App Store conversion rate

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:14.286 A:middle
across each of these sources.

00:27:14.286 --> 00:27:15.886 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:20.666 A:middle
When we left off in the
metrics view, we were here

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:21.866 A:middle
in the App Store
conversion rate.

00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:24.796 A:middle
If we want to view this rate
across each of our sources,

00:27:25.066 --> 00:27:26.086 A:middle
we can select view by.

00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:29.856 A:middle
And you can see in there we have
all of our sources available.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:30.966 A:middle
We could look at territory

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:33.546 A:middle
to understand how our App
Store conversion rate is

00:27:33.576 --> 00:27:34.576 A:middle
on each territory.

00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:36.736 A:middle
But for right now, we're
going to select source type.

00:27:37.096 --> 00:27:40.356 A:middle
And so, if we select
source type, now we're able

00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:42.936 A:middle
to see our App Store
conversion rate for each

00:27:42.936 --> 00:27:44.696 A:middle
of the three sources
that we talked about

00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:46.196 A:middle
and better understand

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:51.036 A:middle
which source is converting
the best on the App Store.

00:27:51.206 --> 00:27:53.196 A:middle
So that's the new sources
feature and how we plan

00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:54.456 A:middle
to visualize it in the product.

00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:56.976 A:middle
We're excited to say that this
will be coming later this year.

00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:04.846 A:middle
That's what's new
in App Analytics

00:28:04.846 --> 00:28:06.016 A:middle
and a little bit
of what's coming.

00:28:06.056 --> 00:28:07.256 A:middle
I'm going to hand it
back over to Dave.

00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:07.956 A:middle
Thank you.

00:28:08.516 --> 00:28:12.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:17.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:28:17.266 --> 00:28:17.776 A:middle
Thanks, David.

00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:20.066 A:middle
That's what's new
in App Analytics.

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:25.016 A:middle
So let's talk about
screenshot simplification.

00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:30.016 A:middle
And to talk about this,
the best way to do it is

00:28:30.016 --> 00:28:33.776 A:middle
to take a step back and think
about what are our screenshots?

00:28:33.776 --> 00:28:37.056 A:middle
So you can have up to
five screenshots for each

00:28:37.056 --> 00:28:40.626 A:middle
of your devices that give
customers a real quick snapshot

00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:42.226 A:middle
into what's going on in your app

00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:43.436 A:middle
when they're browsing
the App Store.

00:28:43.986 --> 00:28:48.496 A:middle
And since we give
you five screenshots

00:28:48.846 --> 00:28:52.016 A:middle
for each device size, when
you're developing for iPhone,

00:28:53.176 --> 00:28:55.296 A:middle
that's going to give
you 20 screenshots.

00:28:56.256 --> 00:29:01.266 A:middle
As you start to include
iPad into your app,

00:28:56.256 --> 00:29:01.266 A:middle
As you start to include
iPad into your app,

00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:04.326 A:middle
that number increases to 30,

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:08.206 A:middle
and this is before you've even
done any kind of localization.

00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:11.906 A:middle
And we support up to
28 different languages

00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:14.556 A:middle
on iTunes Connect and the
App Store, bringing you

00:29:14.556 --> 00:29:17.136 A:middle
up to 840 different
screenshots that you can upload.

00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:19.226 A:middle
And we haven't even
included the Apple Watch.

00:29:21.546 --> 00:29:24.006 A:middle
With Apple Watch, that
number increases to up

00:29:24.006 --> 00:29:26.156 A:middle
to 980 screenshots,
and this is great.

00:29:26.446 --> 00:29:27.716 A:middle
There's a lot of power in this

00:29:28.276 --> 00:29:31.526 A:middle
because you can actually
get the right screenshot

00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:34.626 A:middle
for the right device and
the correct localization.

00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:38.576 A:middle
But you don't always
need this much power,

00:29:39.856 --> 00:29:42.646 A:middle
and that's what screenshot
simplification is about

00:29:43.286 --> 00:29:46.556 A:middle
and how we can simplify
this into just one set

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:48.686 A:middle
of screenshots per
device family.

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:50.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:50.976 A:middle
Yeah, we can clap for this one.

00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:54.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:55.396 --> 00:29:57.806 A:middle
So let's see what this is going
to look like in iTunes Connect.

00:29:57.806 --> 00:29:59.926 A:middle
So we're going to start
on the version page,

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:02.226 A:middle
and the first thing
you'll notice is that there

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:02.226 A:middle
and the first thing
you'll notice is that there

00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:05.906 A:middle
at the top we just have the
two sections, iPhone, iPad.

00:30:06.626 --> 00:30:10.986 A:middle
And now the [inaudible] will
support our larger sized iPhone

00:30:10.986 --> 00:30:13.206 A:middle
screenshots, the 5-1/2 inch.

00:30:13.736 --> 00:30:17.026 A:middle
So we drag those on in.

00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:18.466 A:middle
They fill in.

00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:20.246 A:middle
We have our app preview first,

00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:22.486 A:middle
followed by our five
screenshots.

00:30:23.386 --> 00:30:26.616 A:middle
And if we want to see our other
sizes, that's just down below.

00:30:26.876 --> 00:30:29.156 A:middle
We can open it up,
and we can see

00:30:29.156 --> 00:30:30.916 A:middle
that automatically we've begun

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:33.806 A:middle
to share those screenshots I
uploaded from my 5-1/2 inch

00:30:33.806 --> 00:30:35.466 A:middle
down to these smaller sizes.

00:30:36.266 --> 00:30:38.686 A:middle
In fact, if we zoom in,
we can tell we've written

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:39.976 A:middle
on the screenshot where
these images came from.

00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:47.886 A:middle
And if we want to change
this, what screenshots we have

00:30:47.886 --> 00:30:50.526 A:middle
for these other sizes,
then we have a new area

00:30:50.526 --> 00:30:52.276 A:middle
of iTunes Connect
called the Media Manager.

00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:54.396 A:middle
Now let's look into this.

00:30:54.836 --> 00:30:57.276 A:middle
This Media Manager is going
to hold all of our information

00:30:57.306 --> 00:30:59.756 A:middle
about all those screenshots
and app previews that we upload

00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:02.326 A:middle
across different languages
on all of our devices.

00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:06.546 A:middle
So you can see at the top we
have our 5-1/2 inch screenshots,

00:31:06.546 --> 00:31:09.426 A:middle
and they've been shared down
below with the smaller sizes.

00:31:09.936 --> 00:31:13.056 A:middle
In fact, if we change
our screenshot order

00:31:13.056 --> 00:31:16.136 A:middle
for the 5-1/2 inch, it's
also going to change those

00:31:16.136 --> 00:31:16.756 A:middle
that have been shared.

00:31:18.236 --> 00:31:21.226 A:middle
But not every app looks
and behaves the same

00:31:21.786 --> 00:31:25.526 A:middle
on the 5-1/2 inch iPhone as
it does on the smaller sizes.

00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:27.856 A:middle
So you may want to
upload screenshots

00:31:27.856 --> 00:31:29.756 A:middle
that are more specific
for your device size.

00:31:30.846 --> 00:31:35.376 A:middle
In order to do that,
there's a checkbox right here

00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:36.576 A:middle
for our 4.7 inch.

00:31:37.346 --> 00:31:40.286 A:middle
We're going to stop sharing
by unchecking that box,

00:31:40.326 --> 00:31:42.686 A:middle
and that's going to clear
out these shared screenshots.

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:47.086 A:middle
We simply drag in the
new 4.7 inch screenshots,

00:31:47.576 --> 00:31:53.136 A:middle
and now these screenshots
are actually sharing

00:31:53.136 --> 00:31:54.446 A:middle
with those that are smaller.

00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:57.376 A:middle
We're going to find the
next closest larger size

00:31:57.376 --> 00:31:59.096 A:middle
from which we can
share screenshots.

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:05.436 A:middle
Now if we want to localize our
app on our app screenshots,

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:05.436 A:middle
Now if we want to localize our
app on our app screenshots,

00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:07.576 A:middle
we can do the same thing
in other languages.

00:32:09.036 --> 00:32:10.916 A:middle
So let's pick German.

00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:15.036 A:middle
When we look at our German
images inside of Media Manager,

00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:19.906 A:middle
we're going to see that the
5-1/2 inch German screenshots

00:32:19.906 --> 00:32:21.446 A:middle
came from my default
localization,

00:32:21.446 --> 00:32:23.176 A:middle
in this case my US English.

00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:28.516 A:middle
And the 4.7 are copied from
the 4.7 default localization.

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:32.106 A:middle
If I want to upload
German-specific screenshots,

00:32:32.236 --> 00:32:36.146 A:middle
I can come here to my
checkbox, uncheck this sharing,

00:32:36.146 --> 00:32:38.136 A:middle
and this is actually
going to clear out all

00:32:38.136 --> 00:32:39.206 A:middle
of my screenshots for German.

00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:41.626 A:middle
We're going to favor your
localized screenshots

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.906 A:middle
over all else.

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:47.886 A:middle
So now we can drag in my
5-1/2 inch German screenshots,

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:50.446 A:middle
and they're going to fill in
not only this larger size,

00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:51.156 A:middle
but everything down below.

00:32:51.686 --> 00:32:57.466 A:middle
And since my German app
also behaves differently

00:32:57.706 --> 00:33:00.756 A:middle
on these different
sizes, I can come in here,

00:32:57.706 --> 00:33:00.756 A:middle
on these different
sizes, I can come in here,

00:33:01.206 --> 00:33:03.676 A:middle
uncheck the sharing
for this 4.7 inch.

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:08.136 A:middle
They get cleared out, and I
drag in my new screenshots.

00:33:08.566 --> 00:33:10.766 A:middle
And that's it.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:12.676 A:middle
And that's how we use
screenshot simplification.

00:33:13.536 --> 00:33:17.836 A:middle
There's two different
kinds of media management.

00:33:17.916 --> 00:33:20.306 A:middle
We start with iPhone and iPad
where they're going to share

00:33:20.306 --> 00:33:22.776 A:middle
across all the different
localizations as well

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:24.006 A:middle
as the different
size that you have.

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:26.996 A:middle
But there are some device types
that don't have multiple sizes,

00:33:27.646 --> 00:33:30.236 A:middle
Apple Watch, Apple
TV, and the Mac.

00:33:30.866 --> 00:33:32.956 A:middle
You can still use
screenshot simplification,

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:34.756 A:middle
but in this case, all
you're going to share

00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:36.286 A:middle
across are the localizations.

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:42.536 A:middle
What if you do want to still
upload all 980 screenshots?

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:46.646 A:middle
Well, the best way to do that
is for the Transporter XML Feed.

00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:49.966 A:middle
This is a command line
automation tool that we provide

00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:52.366 A:middle
that lets you upload
all screenshot sizes,

00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:56.286 A:middle
all your app previews, as well
as any other localized metadata.

00:33:56.286 --> 00:33:57.716 A:middle
You can set your
pricing for your app.

00:33:58.166 --> 00:34:00.486 A:middle
You can include metadata
for your in-app purchases,

00:33:58.166 --> 00:34:00.486 A:middle
You can include metadata
for your in-app purchases,

00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:02.636 A:middle
your leaderboards, and
achievements in Game Center.

00:34:02.636 --> 00:34:05.156 A:middle
And if you want more
information about this,

00:34:05.156 --> 00:34:08.426 A:middle
you can go to the Resources and
Help section of iTunes Connect,

00:34:09.016 --> 00:34:11.786 A:middle
or last year we had a great
session on getting the most

00:34:11.786 --> 00:34:14.396 A:middle
out of iTunes Connect, where
we went over a little bit more

00:34:14.576 --> 00:34:17.406 A:middle
to Transporter XML Feed.

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:20.735 A:middle
So what is screenshot
simplification?

00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:23.525 A:middle
Quite simply, create only
the required screenshots

00:34:23.525 --> 00:34:27.076 A:middle
that you need and share those
across localizations and sizes.

00:34:28.206 --> 00:34:30.085 A:middle
And this will be
available later this summer.

00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:33.456 A:middle
Now I want to talk
about iMessage apps.

00:34:33.456 --> 00:34:36.186 A:middle
This is a great new
feature that we're providing

00:34:36.186 --> 00:34:37.386 A:middle
so you can really interact

00:34:37.386 --> 00:34:39.576 A:middle
with the people using
your app in new ways.

00:34:39.706 --> 00:34:41.846 A:middle
And we wanted to touch
on what do you have to do

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:44.596 A:middle
on iTunes Connect to get these
apps ready for the App Store?

00:34:45.536 --> 00:34:49.746 A:middle
We tried to make it as simple
as possible and as relatable

00:34:49.746 --> 00:34:50.936 A:middle
to what you're already doing.

00:34:51.896 --> 00:34:52.786 A:middle
So the first thing is,

00:34:53.286 --> 00:34:55.126 A:middle
is if you're creating a
Stickers iMessage app,

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.616 A:middle
then we have a new category
for you, a Stickers category,

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.686 A:middle
with some more subcategories,
all about Stickers.

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.686 A:middle
with some more subcategories,
all about Stickers.

00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:07.586 A:middle
And the second thing is we
have device screenshots just

00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:08.366 A:middle
for your iMessage apps.

00:35:08.366 --> 00:35:11.856 A:middle
So you can show what it'll be
like to use your app inside

00:35:11.856 --> 00:35:13.866 A:middle
of messages, and
we can show those

00:35:13.866 --> 00:35:15.626 A:middle
on the App Store
for iMessage apps.

00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:20.526 A:middle
Now how does this work
with the Media Management?

00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:24.046 A:middle
iMessage apps behave
just like iPhone and iPad

00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.296 A:middle
in that we have different
sizes we take

00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:29.066 A:middle
so you can show how it works
on all of your devices as well

00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:30.436 A:middle
as across localizations.

00:35:31.056 --> 00:35:34.136 A:middle
And this works the same way
with screenshot simplification.

00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:38.686 A:middle
Now if you want to know more
information about iMessage apps,

00:35:39.026 --> 00:35:40.926 A:middle
we have two great
sessions on that.

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:42.676 A:middle
If you didn't get a
chance to see those, again,

00:35:42.676 --> 00:35:44.186 A:middle
I encourage you to
check those out.

00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:48.496 A:middle
And that's what it
takes in order

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:50.716 A:middle
to use your iMessage
apps on iTunes Connect.

00:35:50.806 --> 00:35:54.406 A:middle
Now the last thing
we want to talk

00:35:54.406 --> 00:35:55.836 A:middle
about today are the
guideline changes.

00:35:56.376 --> 00:36:01.016 A:middle
And those of you who
are frequent viewers

00:35:56.376 --> 00:36:01.016 A:middle
And those of you who
are frequent viewers

00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:02.146 A:middle
of "What's New on
iTunes Connect?"

00:36:02.736 --> 00:36:05.416 A:middle
know that often we take this
time to talk with App Review

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:08.136 A:middle
about do they have any
suggestions for you on ways

00:36:08.136 --> 00:36:11.636 A:middle
to maybe get your app through
App Review more efficiently

00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:15.416 A:middle
or perhaps some common stumbling
blocks that developers run into.

00:36:15.516 --> 00:36:17.786 A:middle
And this year, we're going to
do it a little bit differently

00:36:17.786 --> 00:36:18.566 A:middle
for a couple of reasons.

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:23.186 A:middle
The first is that App Review
times have gone way down,

00:36:23.216 --> 00:36:24.826 A:middle
and we've worked really
hard to make that faster.

00:36:26.516 --> 00:36:31.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:34.016 A:middle
And the second is that
we've updated our guidelines

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:37.006 A:middle
to hopefully make it easier
for you to get these answers

00:36:37.006 --> 00:36:39.236 A:middle
to the questions, and you
can get this information

00:36:39.236 --> 00:36:39.836 A:middle
much faster.

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:44.696 A:middle
So the biggest change in
our guidelines is the way

00:36:44.696 --> 00:36:45.396 A:middle
in which they're worded.

00:36:45.586 --> 00:36:46.856 A:middle
You could call it
more human readable.

00:36:47.316 --> 00:36:50.806 A:middle
Instead of a list of things,
don't do this, or don't do that,

00:36:50.806 --> 00:36:54.096 A:middle
we've really tried to give you
advice on what makes a good app

00:36:54.096 --> 00:36:55.826 A:middle
and what are the best ways

00:36:55.826 --> 00:36:56.966 A:middle
to get your app ready
for the App Store.

00:37:01.166 --> 00:37:05.126 A:middle
In fact, we've also
included information in here

00:37:05.446 --> 00:37:09.106 A:middle
for when you're ready to submit
your app, sort of a checklist

00:37:09.266 --> 00:37:14.146 A:middle
on things you can be thinking
of, such as is my server ready

00:37:14.146 --> 00:37:17.336 A:middle
to go when I submit to App
Review, not just when it's ready

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:18.056 A:middle
to go on the App Store?

00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:21.396 A:middle
Does your app require a
login in order to work?

00:37:22.026 --> 00:37:23.736 A:middle
If that's the case,
go ahead and put

00:37:23.736 --> 00:37:25.896 A:middle
that on iTunes Connect before
you submit to App Review.

00:37:27.596 --> 00:37:30.376 A:middle
These guidelines are
really meant to be read

00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:33.216 A:middle
so you can understand them,
just sort of sit down.

00:37:33.216 --> 00:37:34.896 A:middle
In fact, how many people
have already read the new

00:37:34.896 --> 00:37:35.686 A:middle
App Guidelines?

00:37:36.226 --> 00:37:38.206 A:middle
So that's not enough.

00:37:38.426 --> 00:37:39.546 A:middle
Those at home can't see this.

00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:42.716 A:middle
It takes about 20 to
30 minutes to sit down

00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:45.096 A:middle
and read the guidelines and
get a feel for what they are.

00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:50.106 A:middle
The great thing about
them being human readable

00:37:50.106 --> 00:37:52.596 A:middle
in English is it's much
easier to translate them

00:37:52.596 --> 00:37:54.916 A:middle
to be human readable in Spanish
or human readable in Chinese.

00:37:55.796 --> 00:37:58.066 A:middle
And so, we've localized in
these App Guidelines in up

00:37:58.066 --> 00:37:59.136 A:middle
to ten different languages.

00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:07.256 A:middle
We've also combined our macOS
guidelines with iOS guidelines.

00:38:07.256 --> 00:38:09.606 A:middle
You only have one place
to go to get an answer

00:38:09.606 --> 00:38:12.426 A:middle
to what is appropriate
for my app.

00:38:15.156 --> 00:38:16.186 A:middle
And lastly, I want to talk

00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:17.926 A:middle
about the organization
of these guidelines.

00:38:19.086 --> 00:38:21.116 A:middle
We want to try to make
it easier, like I said,

00:38:21.116 --> 00:38:26.306 A:middle
to find answers to questions
that you have about your app

00:38:26.466 --> 00:38:29.456 A:middle
and getting it through App
Review, sort of changing it

00:38:29.456 --> 00:38:32.576 A:middle
from more of a feature-based
system to more contextual.

00:38:34.016 --> 00:38:35.696 A:middle
And so, we broke this
into five different areas.

00:38:35.986 --> 00:38:39.316 A:middle
And in fact, it kind
of shows some

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.656 A:middle
of the changes with
the guidelines.

00:38:40.656 --> 00:38:43.536 A:middle
We've created a comic book and
broke these five different areas

00:38:43.536 --> 00:38:45.296 A:middle
into five different
parts of that book.

00:38:46.086 --> 00:38:47.476 A:middle
So let's talk about
this different areas.

00:38:48.606 --> 00:38:51.796 A:middle
The first is safety, and
this is really the safety

00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:56.006 A:middle
of the people using your app,
the content, if it's appropriate

00:38:56.006 --> 00:38:57.926 A:middle
for kids, if it's safe for kids.

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:00.026 A:middle
And also, are the
people that are going

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:00.026 A:middle
And also, are the
people that are going

00:39:00.026 --> 00:39:01.496 A:middle
to be using your
app doing some harm

00:39:01.496 --> 00:39:02.696 A:middle
to themselves or to the device?

00:39:02.696 --> 00:39:05.916 A:middle
It's that kind of safety.

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:08.886 A:middle
The next area is performance.

00:39:09.396 --> 00:39:11.996 A:middle
What kind of hardware
does your app need?

00:39:11.996 --> 00:39:12.786 A:middle
How is it running?

00:39:13.266 --> 00:39:17.256 A:middle
Then we can talk about business.

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:21.416 A:middle
Is your app appropriate
for these in-app purchases?

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:23.216 A:middle
How does it work
well with Apple Pay?

00:39:23.216 --> 00:39:25.676 A:middle
Do you have a alternate
business model?

00:39:26.536 --> 00:39:27.626 A:middle
You want to understand what kind

00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.646 A:middle
of business models are
appropriate for the App Store.

00:39:30.516 --> 00:39:32.946 A:middle
You can check with the
business area of the guidelines.

00:39:33.466 --> 00:39:39.166 A:middle
Let me talk with design
and what makes a great app

00:39:39.356 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
for the App Store?

00:39:40.496 --> 00:39:47.976 A:middle
Simple, refined,
innovative, and easy to use.

00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:50.226 A:middle
And last, everybody's
favorite, legal.

00:39:50.226 --> 00:39:53.926 A:middle
A couple of people
thought that was funny.

00:39:54.426 --> 00:39:58.656 A:middle
This is where we can talk
about the rules around privacy,

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.096 A:middle
intellectual property,
and gambling apps.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.096 A:middle
intellectual property,
and gambling apps.

00:40:01.926 --> 00:40:04.096 A:middle
If you want to know when do I
need to have a privacy policy

00:40:04.096 --> 00:40:06.066 A:middle
and more information about
that, you can check these out.

00:40:06.546 --> 00:40:10.336 A:middle
And these are our different
areas for the guideline changes.

00:40:11.056 --> 00:40:14.216 A:middle
Again, instead of reading
the guidelines and finding

00:40:14.216 --> 00:40:17.136 A:middle
out that you need a privacy
policy for a kid's category

00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:20.556 A:middle
or you need a privacy
policy for an autorenewable,

00:40:20.686 --> 00:40:22.546 A:middle
why don't you instead
go to one place to find

00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:24.316 A:middle
out what are the rules
around privacy policies?

00:40:25.586 --> 00:40:27.426 A:middle
In order to help
you find the answers

00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:29.056 A:middle
to the questions
you have better.

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:32.866 A:middle
And those are our
changes to the guidelines.

00:40:34.736 --> 00:40:36.246 A:middle
So what's new in iTunes Connect?

00:40:36.556 --> 00:40:38.776 A:middle
Well, we've got the
changes to in-app purchases

00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:40.656 A:middle
with subscriptions
and promo codes.

00:40:41.196 --> 00:40:44.356 A:middle
We have updates to
iTunes Connect for iOS

00:40:45.006 --> 00:40:47.126 A:middle
with a Resolution
Center built into the app

00:40:47.126 --> 00:40:50.306 A:middle
and just released changes
to sales and proceeds.

00:40:51.376 --> 00:40:54.046 A:middle
We also talked about the
new impressions coming

00:40:54.046 --> 00:40:57.866 A:middle
to App Analytics
and other sources.

00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:00.106 A:middle
Screenshot simplification
allows you

00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:00.106 A:middle
Screenshot simplification
allows you

00:41:00.106 --> 00:41:04.516 A:middle
to create just the screenshots
that you need and the languages

00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:05.596 A:middle
and sizes that work for you.

00:41:06.176 --> 00:41:09.296 A:middle
We talked about what
do you need to do

00:41:09.296 --> 00:41:11.286 A:middle
to get your iMessage apps
ready for the App Store

00:41:11.286 --> 00:41:14.556 A:middle
through iTunes Connects and the
changes to the App Guidelines.

00:41:15.096 --> 00:41:19.146 A:middle
If you have any more questions,
you can get more information

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:21.716 A:middle
from our sessions URL here
at the Developers Conference.

00:41:22.716 --> 00:41:24.526 A:middle
We talked about these
other related sessions.

00:41:24.796 --> 00:41:26.216 A:middle
I'm putting them here so
you can take a look at them.

00:41:26.216 --> 00:41:28.436 A:middle
And with that, I hope you've
had a great conference

00:41:28.436 --> 00:41:30.046 A:middle
and a great week, and
we'll see you next year.

00:41:30.306 --> 00:41:30.976 A:middle
Thanks a lot.

00:41:31.508 --> 00:41:33.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]
