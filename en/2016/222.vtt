[ Applause ]

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:24.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning guys, how's
your conference going so far?

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:27.666 A:middle
My name is Kevin, I'm one of
interface builder engineers

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.616 A:middle
and Brent is going to join
us a little bit later.

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.636 A:middle
And what we want talk to you
guys about today is adaptivity,

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:38.316 A:middle
which is how do I make one app
that doesn't just look passable

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:41.076 A:middle
on all our devices right,
but looks freaking awesome.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.826 A:middle
And so that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:47.156 A:middle
And I'm going to give away my
entire presentation right now.

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:49.776 A:middle
If there's one thing that
you take away it's this,

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:54.286 A:middle
when it comes to adaptivity
the system is going to do most

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.336 A:middle
of the work for you and so
we're going to unpack this.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:00.366 A:middle
I'm going to tell you what the
system is actually doing for you

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:00.366 A:middle
I'm going to tell you what the
system is actually doing for you

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.336 A:middle
that would be nice to know.

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.325 A:middle
But also how you guys as
developers will get to interact

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:07.376 A:middle
and plug into that system.

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.306 A:middle
But before I do I actually
want to step back and I want

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.356 A:middle
to give this a little bit of
motivation here and I want

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:16.496 A:middle
to tell you why this statement
is actually really good news.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.356 A:middle
So Apple had a pretty big mouth

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:22.486 A:middle
on this last year we
sold our 1 billionth iOS.

00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:24.556 A:middle
I don't know about you,
but this number is just

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:26.586 A:middle
like mind-boggling to me.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.286 A:middle
Now you make a fair point,

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:32.156 A:middle
when it comes adaptivity
volume doesn't really matter.

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:33.836 A:middle
Fair, I'll give that to you.

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:36.996 A:middle
But we know that it's
not all the same device,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.176 A:middle
it's not all 1 billion
original iPhones,

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:40.346 A:middle
so that would be
really cool wouldn't it.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:43.486 A:middle
Over the years Apple has
introduced lots of devices

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.296 A:middle
of various form factors
and sizes

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:48.766 A:middle
and shapes, I mean even colors.

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:53.176 A:middle
And at Apple we also
believe that regardless

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
of what device you have you can
hold it however you want whether

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.076 A:middle
that be in portrait
or landscape.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.716 A:middle
But beyond the physical devices
themselves we also have software

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.716 A:middle
But beyond the physical devices
themselves we also have software

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.446 A:middle
features like slide over and
these multitasking features

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:09.515 A:middle
as well that just increases
the number of combinations

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:10.696 A:middle
that your application can be in.

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:13.636 A:middle
Don't forget things
like dynamic type right,

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:16.106 A:middle
where the user can
set a font size

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:18.696 A:middle
and all your applications
are going to react and relay

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.006 A:middle
out right, you're
all doing that?

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:23.326 A:middle
And then we also have features

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:27.266 A:middle
like the language
direction whether it's left

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.426 A:middle
to right or right to left.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:31.846 A:middle
We also have the display gamut
on those awesome new iPads

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:32.856 A:middle
that we released this year.

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.186 A:middle
And Apple TV we also
have features

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.726 A:middle
like the interface style
with its light and dark.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:40.606 A:middle
So kind of a conservative
estimate for the number

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:42.336 A:middle
of combinations that your
application can be in,

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:45.356 A:middle
in iOS applications like
over 300 combinations.

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:46.856 A:middle
That's a lot.

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:51.136 A:middle
So that's why this statement
of the system doing work

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.336 A:middle
for you is really good news.

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:56.616 A:middle
Now the keyword here is most.

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:01.976 A:middle
There are a lot of ways that
you as developers can plug in

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:01.976 A:middle
There are a lot of ways that
you as developers can plug in

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.426 A:middle
and customize this experience

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:05.106 A:middle
because you want your
applications to look unique.

00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:07.536 A:middle
And that's what we want
to talk to you guys about.

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:12.456 A:middle
So first we're going to talk
about the fundamental system

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:14.546 A:middle
of adaptivity, which we
call the trait system.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:17.246 A:middle
And then Brent's going to come
up and give you guys a demo

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.576 A:middle
of how we've improved
the tools to work

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.296 A:middle
with building adaptive
applications.

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:23.696 A:middle
And that's what we're
going to cover in part 1,

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.176 A:middle
which is today's session.

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:28.496 A:middle
You're definitely going to want
to come back tomorrow for part 2

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:30.736 A:middle
because we're going to give
you this like utility knife

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:33.606 A:middle
of all these additional
technologies and techniques

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.426 A:middle
that you guys can use to make
your applications adaptive.

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:39.166 A:middle
And then we're going to put it
all together and we're going

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.946 A:middle
to give you guys some
really awesome demos

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:42.396 A:middle
and examples in code.

00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:44.326 A:middle
All right, so let's
start by talking

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.946 A:middle
about the fundamental
system of adaptivity,

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:48.186 A:middle
which is called the trait system

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.456 A:middle
and there's three particular
things I want to mention

00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:51.756 A:middle
to you guys about this.

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.096 A:middle
The first thing is I'm
just going to start

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.226 A:middle
by telling you what it is, it's
a pretty good place to start.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:58.386 A:middle
And then we're going to laser
in on one particular part

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:00.656 A:middle
of the trait system, which
we call size classes.

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:00.656 A:middle
of the trait system, which
we call size classes.

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:02.906 A:middle
And I think it would be a
really good idea to kind

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.036 A:middle
of give you guys a
little background

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:05.386 A:middle
about how the system works

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.446 A:middle
because that will make it
really clear how you are going

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:08.286 A:middle
to interact with it.

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:11.116 A:middle
So what are traits?

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:14.006 A:middle
Traits describe the environment

00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:16.266 A:middle
that your application
is running in.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:20.346 A:middle
So here's an example of a
trait, the horizontalSizeClass.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:23.546 A:middle
And this just describes what
the experience should be

00:04:23.546 --> 00:04:26.326 A:middle
for the available space of your
application horizontally whether

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:28.006 A:middle
you have a little bit of
space or a lot of space.

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:32.526 A:middle
Now a trait by itself doesn't
really have any associated value

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:35.746 A:middle
with it and that's where trait
collections come into play.

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:37.756 A:middle
You can think of
a trait collection

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.056 A:middle
as pretty much a
dictionary mapping keys

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:42.216 A:middle
which are traits to values.

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:45.536 A:middle
Most of the traits have
kind of an enumeration

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.666 A:middle
of possible values, so you know
what you need to be thinking

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.746 A:middle
about as you're building
your applications.

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:54.126 A:middle
Now trait collections don't
usually have one thing in them

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.266 A:middle
that would be awesome, usually
they have many things in them.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:57.536 A:middle
And even the three that you see

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
on the screen here is even
a supplication of the size

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
on the screen here is even
a supplication of the size

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
of the trait collections that
you guys will be interacting

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:04.666 A:middle
with and making your
applications adaptive for.

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:07.736 A:middle
Let me give you a
few more examples

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:09.036 A:middle
of what some of the traits are.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.056 A:middle
So we'll talk more
about size classes.

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:14.396 A:middle
There's also dynamic type
size, which is new this year.

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.106 A:middle
There's also the
layout direction,

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:17.846 A:middle
so left to right, right to left.

00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:21.716 A:middle
And the three up here are
examples of layout traits.

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:24.256 A:middle
Traits can also describe
appearance though.

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:28.856 A:middle
So what gamut is the display
that you're running on

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.276 A:middle
or for Apple TV what
is the interface style,

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:33.026 A:middle
is it light or dark.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:36.506 A:middle
But traits can also
describe capabilities.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.966 A:middle
So for example, whether
or not the device

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.676 A:middle
that you're using supports
three touch or not.

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.966 A:middle
If you want a full list
of all the possible traits

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
that you can make your
applications adaptive over check

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:49.496 A:middle
out UITraitCollection's
interface.

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.486 A:middle
But now I want to
specifically focus

00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:53.646 A:middle
in on talking about
size classes.

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:59.446 A:middle
Your application can be in
a lot of different sizes.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.316 A:middle
This is humorously
a simplification

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.316 A:middle
This is humorously
a simplification

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.456 A:middle
of what some of those sizes are.

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:06.746 A:middle
And when you look at this
there's kind of three axes

00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:08.336 A:middle
of customization that
kind of stick out.

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:12.656 A:middle
So first is the screen size,
second would be the orientation,

00:06:13.026 --> 00:06:15.066 A:middle
and third would be something
that we call adaptation,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:17.216 A:middle
this would be like which
multitasking mode you're in.

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:20.196 A:middle
So one way to do this without
any formal system would be

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.016 A:middle
to look for and respond
to changes in any one

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.476 A:middle
of these things, but
that's a lot of work.

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:31.056 A:middle
And so what will you do
instead is to base your layout

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:34.776 A:middle
on the available space for your
application and not on any one

00:06:34.776 --> 00:06:36.936 A:middle
of those three axes
of customization.

00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:39.746 A:middle
So what do I mean by
react to available space?

00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:41.176 A:middle
There's kind of two
ways we react

00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:44.276 A:middle
to available space given
the size of the change.

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:47.486 A:middle
So there's coarse grain changes
and these will be like changes

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:50.886 A:middle
from within iPhone to an
iPad, a large change in size.

00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:54.166 A:middle
There's also fine grain
changes, which would be examples

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:58.516 A:middle
of like going from iPhone
6s to SE smaller changes.

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.116 A:middle
And for each one of
these changes fine

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.116 A:middle
And for each one of
these changes fine

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.076 A:middle
or coarse you're going to
use different techniques,

00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:04.886 A:middle
different technologies
to help you through.

00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:08.356 A:middle
Let's start by talking
about coarse grain changes.

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.466 A:middle
I think we're pretty
familiar with this quote,

00:07:11.686 --> 00:07:12.866 A:middle
it's of my favorite quotes.

00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.336 A:middle
We as engineers love to
create layers of indirection

00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:17.756 A:middle
to help us solve problems,

00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:20.226 A:middle
to make things easier,
honestly to be lazy.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:23.746 A:middle
So size classes is a
layer of indirection.

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:26.836 A:middle
Now layers of indirection
always describe some sort

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:28.416 A:middle
of higher order behavior.

00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:30.596 A:middle
So what's the higher
order behavior

00:07:30.596 --> 00:07:34.536 A:middle
that size class is describing
and that's experience.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:37.356 A:middle
Let me give you two
examples here.

00:07:37.846 --> 00:07:40.766 A:middle
So first will be the canonical
example we see this all the

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:41.306 A:middle
time right.

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:43.326 A:middle
On iPad we have a master detail

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:45.936 A:middle
where the information is
presented side-by-side.

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:49.086 A:middle
A change in the master
reflects in seeing the details

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:50.056 A:middle
on the right-hand side.

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:53.216 A:middle
However, on an iPhone where
there's not as much room

00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:56.196 A:middle
that way that we present
information changes.

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:59.196 A:middle
We instead use a navigation
controller and use more

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:01.946 A:middle
of a drill in way of
presenting information.

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:01.946 A:middle
of a drill in way of
presenting information.

00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:04.006 A:middle
News would be another example.

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:08.076 A:middle
On the iPad we have this awesome
grid view, it's great to sit

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.196 A:middle
on your couch and just be able
to scroll through stories.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.456 A:middle
But on my iPhone
it's a table view

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:15.686 A:middle
where I can just quickly
scroll through with my thumb.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:20.086 A:middle
So experience comes down to how
we're presenting information

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:22.116 A:middle
and when you think about
coarse grain changes

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:25.016 A:middle
in your applications think
about the kinds of experiences,

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:27.916 A:middle
the ways you're presenting
information to decide whether

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:30.656 A:middle
or not or how you're going
to present that information.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:34.816 A:middle
So let's get specific for a
second, I was going over kind

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.086 A:middle
of some higher-order things.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.416 A:middle
What specifically
is size classes?

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.676 A:middle
And this is where we bring
the trait system back in.

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:44.656 A:middle
So size classes is two traits,
there's a horizontalSizeClass

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:45.966 A:middle
and there's verticalSizeClass

00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:49.516 A:middle
and there's two possible
values, compact and regular.

00:08:50.006 --> 00:08:52.336 A:middle
Compact just simply means
that you're space constrained.

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:54.166 A:middle
And so you're going to
want to present information

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.866 A:middle
in a more compact way.

00:08:56.716 --> 00:08:58.966 A:middle
Regular means that you're
not as space constrained

00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:02.156 A:middle
and you should totally feel
free to explore at least

00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:02.156 A:middle
and you should totally feel
free to explore at least

00:09:02.156 --> 00:09:04.566 A:middle
up to the edges of your
12.9 inch iPad Pro.

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:07.996 A:middle
Now this means that we
have four combinations

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.146 A:middle
of traits and possible values.

00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:13.676 A:middle
Now I just want to point
out real quick here some

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:15.236 A:middle
of the notation that
I'm using on the slide

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:16.706 A:middle
because this is notation
that you're going to see

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:18.326 A:middle
in Interface Builder
and in documentation

00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:19.616 A:middle
and elsewhere in the system.

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:22.346 A:middle
So this is describing a
size class combination

00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:23.686 A:middle
and there's two things
to look here.

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:27.216 A:middle
First, it says there's a W
it stands for the width class

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:29.856 A:middle
and then the value C or
R, so compact or regular.

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:32.616 A:middle
And then H is for the height
class or the vertical class

00:09:32.696 --> 00:09:34.356 A:middle
that again, has either C or R.

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:35.976 A:middle
So you're going to see
this in Interface Builder

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.486 A:middle
and you're going to see
this in documentation

00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:39.486 A:middle
and I just want you guys
to be familiar with this.

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:43.216 A:middle
So how do some of the devices
fit into these combinations?

00:09:43.796 --> 00:09:47.636 A:middle
Well, a compact with experience,
but regular height an example

00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:49.876 A:middle
of that is going to be
our iPhones in portrait,

00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:53.646 A:middle
iPad in contrast is going
to be regular regular

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:55.976 A:middle
in both orientations
for all orientations.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:59.696 A:middle
You're going to see
compact compact with iPhones

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:03.776 A:middle
in landscape with the notable
exception of the 6s Plus,

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:03.776 A:middle
in landscape with the notable
exception of the 6s Plus,

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:06.396 A:middle
which is actually regular
horizontally when you're

00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:08.996 A:middle
in landscape, which is why
you see a master detail

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:11.806 A:middle
in for example mail when
you're using a 6s Plus.

00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:17.526 A:middle
How does this actually
help me though?

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:18.786 A:middle
How does this make
my life easier?

00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:21.146 A:middle
Well, one obvious thing is
that instead of thinking

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:24.436 A:middle
of 300 combinations you
only have to think about 4,

00:10:25.046 --> 00:10:26.176 A:middle
but wait it gets better.

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:29.406 A:middle
You really only have to
think about two and that's

00:10:29.406 --> 00:10:33.896 A:middle
because the width class is
by far the most common class

00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:36.646 A:middle
or trait that you're going
to have to interact with it.

00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:38.186 A:middle
If we think about all the
traits that are possible,

00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:41.316 A:middle
the layout traits are the
most common kind of category

00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
of traits that you're
going to work with.

00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:46.336 A:middle
And within the layout traits
size classes is the most common

00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
layout trait that you're
going to interact with.

00:10:48.426 --> 00:10:52.006 A:middle
And then specifically within
size classes the width class is

00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:53.526 A:middle
by far the most common class

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:54.716 A:middle
that you're going
to interact with.

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:57.176 A:middle
Which means that as you're
designing your applications

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:59.066 A:middle
and thinking about how you
want them to be different

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:02.616 A:middle
between iPad and
iPhone think primarily

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:02.616 A:middle
between iPad and
iPhone think primarily

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.486 A:middle
about the differences
horizontally.

00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:06.006 A:middle
Now certainly guys you're going

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.196 A:middle
to have custom applications
you're going

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:09.206 A:middle
to do special things,
we understand that.

00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:12.486 A:middle
But certainly that's the most
common case is just thinking

00:11:12.486 --> 00:11:14.966 A:middle
about the width class.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:19.566 A:middle
Now the system gets to decide
how devices, orientations,

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:22.026 A:middle
and adaptations fit
into these combinations.

00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:24.266 A:middle
And what's interesting
about this is

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:27.886 A:middle
that these combinations can
change on the same device

00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:30.086 A:middle
as the users interacting
with your application right,

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:32.576 A:middle
I can bring over slide over,
I can go into multitasking,

00:11:32.846 --> 00:11:34.756 A:middle
I can change the
orientation of my device.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.676 A:middle
And so if you're
using size classes

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.106 A:middle
and you're expressing your
data more declaratively,

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:43.426 A:middle
the system can do a bunch of
work for you as it transitions

00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:45.906 A:middle
through all these different
devices, orientations

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.966 A:middle
and adaptations past,
present and future.

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.226 A:middle
And that's really, really
helpful and that's going

00:11:50.226 --> 00:11:51.486 A:middle
to make it much easier
for you guys

00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:53.386 A:middle
to make your applications
adaptive.

00:11:54.456 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
Let me give you two examples
of some of the dynamic kind

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:59.766 A:middle
of changes that can
happen on the system.

00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
So here again, we're going back

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.106 A:middle
to our split view
controller for a second here.

00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:06.166 A:middle
And when I'm on an iPad
in landscape we're going

00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:08.256 A:middle
to have those two view
controllers side-by-side,

00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:10.316 A:middle
but when I go to an iPhone,
you know, we collapse it

00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:11.776 A:middle
into a navigation controller.

00:12:12.186 --> 00:12:13.856 A:middle
If you're using UI Split
View Controller you're going

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:15.356 A:middle
to get this behavior for free.

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:19.096 A:middle
Now besides just view controller
structure this also applies

00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:19.986 A:middle
to presentations.

00:12:20.276 --> 00:12:22.596 A:middle
So if I have an iPad and I
bring up a popover it's going

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:23.886 A:middle
to be this callout style.

00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:26.256 A:middle
But if I move to an
iPhone it's going

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:28.236 A:middle
to be a modal presentation
instead.

00:12:28.856 --> 00:12:30.786 A:middle
So again, if you're
using the kit controls

00:12:30.786 --> 00:12:32.116 A:middle
and the kit presentations
you're going

00:12:32.116 --> 00:12:34.076 A:middle
to get a lot of behavior
for you.

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:35.996 A:middle
The size classes
are going to change

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:36.986 A:middle
and your application is going

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.606 A:middle
to automatically adapt,
which is super neat.

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:42.466 A:middle
So let me talk to you a second
about fine grain changes.

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:44.266 A:middle
I just want to say one
note about this and that's

00:12:44.606 --> 00:12:47.476 A:middle
within the same size
class you're going to want

00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:51.966 A:middle
to use Auto Layout to react to
the available space changing.

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:55.036 A:middle
Withy Auto Layout you can
specify the layout relationships

00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:56.246 A:middle
in a very declarative form

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.326 A:middle
and then the system will
automatically move things

00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:01.926 A:middle
and resize things for you as
that available space is changing

00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:01.926 A:middle
and resize things for you as
that available space is changing

00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:03.336 A:middle
at a more fine grain level.

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:08.706 A:middle
Now there's one more type of
change besides coarse and fine

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:11.036 A:middle
and I call that medium
grain changes.

00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:13.256 A:middle
I'm not going to tell you
what it is though I'm going

00:13:13.256 --> 00:13:15.186 A:middle
to keep the suspense high
and you're going to come back

00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:16.486 A:middle
for part 2 and they're
going to tell you all

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:18.096 A:middle
about medium grain changes.

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:21.936 A:middle
All right, so we've talked
about what size classes are,

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:25.036 A:middle
we have given you kind of an
overview of the trait system.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.976 A:middle
What I want to do now is just
give you a little background

00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:28.886 A:middle
about how the system
works and how

00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:32.006 A:middle
as developers you're
going to plug into that.

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:34.776 A:middle
In a nutshell or in
a sentence rather,

00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:37.726 A:middle
the way the trait system works
is it takes a trait collection

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:38.926 A:middle
and it propagates it

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:42.836 A:middle
down through your view hierarchy
giving each stop along the way a

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:44.746 A:middle
chance to react to
that trait collection.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.436 A:middle
So it all starts at the screen
level and the screen's going

00:13:47.436 --> 00:13:48.476 A:middle
to have a trait collection.

00:13:48.806 --> 00:13:52.166 A:middle
What's important to note about
this is that the every device

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.876 A:middle
and orientation and
adaptation is going

00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:56.366 A:middle
to have a fully specified
trait collection.

00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:57.496 A:middle
And what I mean by that is

00:13:57.496 --> 00:14:00.046 A:middle
that all the different traits
are going to have values.

00:13:57.496 --> 00:14:00.046 A:middle
that all the different traits
are going to have values.

00:14:00.096 --> 00:14:03.066 A:middle
Then the screen is going to
pass it down to all the windows

00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:06.106 A:middle
that are on that screen and then
the window is going to pass it

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:08.426 A:middle
to its root view
controller to its view,

00:14:08.426 --> 00:14:10.146 A:middle
then down to its
subview controllers

00:14:10.146 --> 00:14:11.806 A:middle
and subviews and so on.

00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:16.596 A:middle
Now each stop along the way
here is a class that conforms

00:14:16.596 --> 00:14:20.076 A:middle
to UITraitEnvironment and the
UITraitEnvironment has a key

00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:22.816 A:middle
method called
traitCollectionDidChange.

00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:24.826 A:middle
So at each stop along the way

00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:26.326 A:middle
as this trait collection
is getting propagated

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:28.716 A:middle
down it's going to call
traitCollectionDidChange.

00:14:29.106 --> 00:14:31.966 A:middle
This is where you as
developers are going to override

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.066 A:middle
and make your applications
adaptive.

00:14:34.446 --> 00:14:36.526 A:middle
So traitCollectionDidChange
is the key method here.

00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:40.416 A:middle
And you're almost exclusively
going to override this

00:14:40.536 --> 00:14:42.676 A:middle
at the view controller
and the view level.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.446 A:middle
Now that was a pretty simple
linear example what's a little

00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:47.736 A:middle
bit more complicated example?

00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:50.456 A:middle
So let's go to an iPad
here in landscape.

00:14:50.496 --> 00:14:52.336 A:middle
We have our screen, just going
to go to the window and down

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.686 A:middle
to the view split view
controller and so on.

00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:56.726 A:middle
Now here is where we see a
little bit of a change here

00:14:57.076 --> 00:14:59.296 A:middle
and that's as the trait
collection is getting propagated

00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:02.156 A:middle
down you can actually
change the trait collection

00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:02.156 A:middle
down you can actually
change the trait collection

00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:04.446 A:middle
as it gets propagated to
child view controllers.

00:15:04.856 --> 00:15:06.666 A:middle
So the split view controller
is going to do this for you.

00:15:06.986 --> 00:15:07.986 A:middle
So what it's going
to do is it's going

00:15:07.986 --> 00:15:10.236 A:middle
to change the trait
collection that it passes off

00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:11.706 A:middle
to the master view controller.

00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:14.716 A:middle
It's going to change
that horizontalSizeClass

00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:17.516 A:middle
to a compact size
class and it's going

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:19.276 A:middle
to pass the regular
one off to the detail.

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:21.086 A:middle
You guys can do this too

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:24.256 A:middle
as you build your own custom
container view controllers,

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:28.416 A:middle
but most commonly you
won't need to do that.

00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:30.886 A:middle
Here's an example of what
traitCollectionDidChange might

00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:31.276 A:middle
look like.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.746 A:middle
I'm going to walk you
through a few key things here.

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:36.046 A:middle
First, in order for the system
to do a lot of the work for you,

00:15:36.046 --> 00:15:37.196 A:middle
you want to make
sure you call super.

00:15:38.056 --> 00:15:41.036 A:middle
Next, you want to only
do work if the traits

00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:42.906 A:middle
that you're interested
in are actually changing.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.726 A:middle
Now I hear you questioning
Kevin,

00:15:45.726 --> 00:15:47.836 A:middle
traitCollectionDidChange
getting called doesn't that mean

00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:48.656 A:middle
that traits are changing?

00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:49.746 A:middle
That is absolutely true.

00:15:50.156 --> 00:15:53.666 A:middle
Trait collection gets called
though for any trait changing.

00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:56.356 A:middle
Typically, your application
is only going to be interested

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:59.916 A:middle
in a few traits and most
commonly just the horizontal

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:01.066 A:middle
size class.

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:02.266 A:middle
And so you want to make sure

00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:05.246 A:middle
that you're not doing any extra
work if that particular trait

00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:07.086 A:middle
that you're interested
in is not changing.

00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:11.336 A:middle
Next, I'm going to switch
over the possible values

00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.346 A:middle
for the horizontalSizeClass.

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:14.656 A:middle
As just a side note here,

00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:18.246 A:middle
I really prefer using switch
statements when I'm working

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:21.706 A:middle
with enumerations in both Swift
and Objective-C because it means

00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:24.596 A:middle
that if the definition
that enumeration changes

00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:28.006 A:middle
if a new case comes in I'm
going to get build time warnings

00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:30.146 A:middle
if I'm using an exhaustive
switch statement.

00:16:30.486 --> 00:16:32.636 A:middle
So I would just really encourage
you guys to do that as well,

00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:34.206 A:middle
that's really saved
me a lot of times.

00:16:35.096 --> 00:16:37.356 A:middle
So then for example if
this value is compact,

00:16:37.356 --> 00:16:39.406 A:middle
then I would go off
and set my constraints.

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:42.766 A:middle
So for any view, for any
view controller that I want

00:16:42.766 --> 00:16:44.386 A:middle
to be adaptive I would need

00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:47.006 A:middle
to override
traitCollectionDidChange.

00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:49.586 A:middle
So again, this is going
to get called for anything

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:51.356 A:middle
that conforms to
UITraitEnvironment.

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:54.536 A:middle
And this is where you're
going to do your adaptivity.

00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:57.426 A:middle
Now it might seem like
a lot of work to have

00:16:57.426 --> 00:16:59.426 A:middle
to implement
traitCollectionDidChange

00:16:59.426 --> 00:17:01.576 A:middle
for every single view
controller and every single view

00:16:59.426 --> 00:17:01.576 A:middle
for every single view
controller and every single view

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:03.626 A:middle
for all the possible
changes in your application.

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:05.526 A:middle
A lot of things can change.

00:17:05.986 --> 00:17:09.126 A:middle
So that's why there's a number
of systems that will react

00:17:09.126 --> 00:17:11.126 A:middle
to traitCollectionDidChange
for you.

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:14.726 A:middle
So for example, one system
would be Interface Builder.

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:17.486 A:middle
If you're using Interface
Builder to build your interface

00:17:17.806 --> 00:17:19.746 A:middle
and you're using
adaptivity and size class

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:22.226 A:middle
within Interface Builder
the system knows how

00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:25.256 A:middle
to automatically apply that as
the trait collection changes.

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:27.806 A:middle
Another example would
be asset catalogs.

00:17:28.116 --> 00:17:30.256 A:middle
You can specify images
for different gamuts,

00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:32.576 A:middle
for different size classes,
different scale factors

00:17:32.746 --> 00:17:34.726 A:middle
and those will automatically
be applied again

00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:36.126 A:middle
in traitCollectionDidChange.

00:17:36.926 --> 00:17:40.676 A:middle
And then finally, UIAppearance
can also be customized

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:41.886 A:middle
for trait collection.

00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:44.616 A:middle
So you could for example set
up different color schemes

00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:48.036 A:middle
for light and dark mode in Apple
TV and those changes will again,

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:49.366 A:middle
automatically be applied

00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:51.266 A:middle
in traitCollectionDidChange
for you.

00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:53.446 A:middle
So you really want to take
advantage of these systems

00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:55.406 A:middle
that respond to this for
you because it allows you

00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:58.596 A:middle
to be very declarative about
how you want your interface

00:17:58.596 --> 00:17:59.866 A:middle
to react and to adapt.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:02.276 A:middle
And it makes it really easy
to follow and maintain.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:02.276 A:middle
And it makes it really easy
to follow and maintain.

00:18:03.656 --> 00:18:06.436 A:middle
So just to recap
a couple takeaways

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:07.386 A:middle
that we've seen so far.

00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:11.436 A:middle
Traits describe the environment
that your application is running

00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:14.646 A:middle
in and a trait collection is
going to be a bunch of traits

00:18:14.646 --> 00:18:16.106 A:middle
with their associated values.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:20.606 A:middle
These could be layout traits,
they could be appearance traits,

00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:21.936 A:middle
they could be capabilities
traits.

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.936 A:middle
You want to override
traitCollectionDidChange

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:26.856 A:middle
to make your application
adaptive

00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:29.106 A:middle
and you want take advantage
of those systems that respond

00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:30.646 A:middle
to traitCollectionDidChange
for you.

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:34.976 A:middle
The size classes describe the
experience of your application,

00:18:35.276 --> 00:18:37.206 A:middle
how is your information
laid out.

00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:40.666 A:middle
And then just to drive it home
again, the system is going

00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.466 A:middle
to be able to do so
much work for you

00:18:42.466 --> 00:18:44.166 A:middle
if you're taking
advantage of these tools

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:44.786 A:middle
that we're giving you.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:49.396 A:middle
Now I could draw on
for another 20 minutes

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:51.326 A:middle
about how awesome aptivity is,

00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:53.676 A:middle
but really to see how
cool it is you really want

00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:54.646 A:middle
to see it in action.

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:57.536 A:middle
And so I want to bring up
Brent to give you guys a demo

00:18:57.826 --> 00:18:59.746 A:middle
of the changes that we have
been making to the tools

00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:01.476 A:middle
to improve our workflows
with adaptivity.

00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:01.476 A:middle
to improve our workflows
with adaptivity.

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:02.976 A:middle
So the one and only Brent Shank.

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:09.336 --> 00:19:09.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Kevin.

00:19:10.356 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
So now that you understand
the basic building blocks

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:14.596 A:middle
of adding adaptivity
to your applications.

00:19:14.776 --> 00:19:16.696 A:middle
So that's traits,
trait collections

00:19:16.696 --> 00:19:19.546 A:middle
and size classes I'm going
to show you how Xcode

00:19:19.546 --> 00:19:22.306 A:middle
and the Interface Builder editor
make it really easy to do this.

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:23.736 A:middle
So let's go over to
the demo machine.

00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:27.000 A:middle
It's a long way over here man.

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.636 A:middle
Okay, so I thought
it would be useful

00:19:33.636 --> 00:19:38.416 A:middle
to build a really simple view to
really focus on the fundamentals

00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:40.106 A:middle
of using the trait
collection system

00:19:40.536 --> 00:19:41.946 A:middle
to add a little bit
of adaptivity.

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:44.096 A:middle
So here's what we're
going to build.

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:47.676 A:middle
This is simple, this describes
a location I chose Tenaya Lake,

00:19:47.676 --> 00:19:48.376 A:middle
you should definitely put it

00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:49.786 A:middle
on your bucket list
it's a great place

00:19:49.786 --> 00:19:50.956 A:middle
in Yosemite to see one day.

00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:53.466 A:middle
So this view shows
us a label at the top

00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:55.656 A:middle
and at the bottom is
an image of the place.

00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:58.096 A:middle
And notice that on
iPad there are a couple

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.536 A:middle
of different changes,
a couple of things

00:19:59.536 --> 00:20:00.846 A:middle
that aren't present on iPhone.

00:19:59.536 --> 00:20:00.846 A:middle
that aren't present on iPhone.

00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:04.626 A:middle
You see at the top the label
looks a little bit different

00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:06.186 A:middle
and in fact, there's
a whole another view

00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:07.726 A:middle
that appears just on iPad.

00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:09.676 A:middle
So we're going to build
all this right now

00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:13.116 A:middle
and you'll see how easy it is
to do with the tools in Xcode 8.

00:20:13.926 --> 00:20:15.816 A:middle
So I've already created
this project and I'll switch

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:20.036 A:middle
over to this other tab where
I have the storyboard loaded.

00:20:20.626 --> 00:20:22.676 A:middle
So there are couple
of things to look

00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:26.236 A:middle
at in the Interface
Builder canvas in Xcode 8.

00:20:26.766 --> 00:20:28.456 A:middle
First off, is look how
this view is rendered.

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:31.736 A:middle
It looks like an iPhone
6s in portrait and that's

00:20:31.736 --> 00:20:33.006 A:middle
because it actually is.

00:20:33.006 --> 00:20:34.476 A:middle
We're actually using
the simulator

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:35.756 A:middle
to render this content,

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:38.376 A:middle
so you now get pixel
perfect rendering right

00:20:38.376 --> 00:20:39.376 A:middle
in the design canvas.

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:42.256 A:middle
We think this is going to be a
huge benefit to your workflow

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:44.126 A:middle
as you try to take
these beautiful designs

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:46.886 A:middle
from a designer and translate
it into your application.

00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:50.556 A:middle
The other thing to point out
is that [applause], thank you.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.916 A:middle
The other big changes
is that now scenes

00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:59.196 A:middle
in Interface Builder canvas
are always being rendered

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:02.036 A:middle
in the dimensions of actual
ethical devices or one

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:02.036 A:middle
in the dimensions of actual
ethical devices or one

00:21:02.036 --> 00:21:04.366 A:middle
of their configurations
and that's a big change

00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:05.576 A:middle
from previous versions of Xcode.

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:09.136 A:middle
Let's take another look at
something else that's new.

00:21:09.216 --> 00:21:11.806 A:middle
I'm going to zoom in
here at the bottom bar,

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:13.646 A:middle
so you can see everything here.

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:16.376 A:middle
So this is the bottom button bar
in the Interface Builder canvas,

00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:17.786 A:middle
it's been around
for a long time.

00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:20.586 A:middle
Over on the right-hand side
you can see the controls

00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:21.866 A:middle
for adding all the
layout constraints,

00:21:22.136 --> 00:21:23.206 A:middle
I hope you're familiar
with those.

00:21:23.646 --> 00:21:26.916 A:middle
And in the middle are the new
zoom in controls in Xcode 8.

00:21:27.196 --> 00:21:29.776 A:middle
And if you haven't yet installed
the betas and played with this,

00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:31.676 A:middle
it's amazing to be able
to edit your scenes

00:21:31.966 --> 00:21:33.686 A:middle
at any magnification
level you want.

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:34.976 A:middle
So definitely check
that out it's awesome.

00:21:35.516 --> 00:21:39.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:42.866 A:middle
But today I'm going to talk
about this button over here.

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:45.816 A:middle
So it says View As
iPhone 6s and then

00:21:45.816 --> 00:21:47.716 A:middle
in parenthesis it's got
this notation it says,

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:51.656 A:middle
if you can't read it back
there, it says wC hR.

00:21:51.916 --> 00:21:53.536 A:middle
So this is telling
me the size class

00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:55.266 A:middle
of the current device
configuration

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:55.906 A:middle
that I'm looking at.

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:57.816 A:middle
It's an iPhone 6s in portrait,

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:01.046 A:middle
which means that it's a compact
width regular height device.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:01.046 A:middle
which means that it's a compact
width regular height device.

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:03.236 A:middle
So it's a little bit of
terminology Kevin's talked about

00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:06.446 A:middle
and I'll show you how you can
apply that to add adaptations.

00:22:07.246 --> 00:22:10.336 A:middle
So the scene is currently
being rendered as an iPhone 6s

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.156 A:middle
in portrait what if I
want to change this?

00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:15.476 A:middle
Well, all you need to do
is click the View As button

00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:17.426 A:middle
and it opens the new
Device Configuration bar.

00:22:17.826 --> 00:22:19.856 A:middle
This is brand new in Xcode
8 and it's really cool.

00:22:25.096 --> 00:22:27.516 A:middle
So I zoomed in here so you can
see exactly what's going on.

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:29.716 A:middle
So there are a couple
of stacks of icons here

00:22:29.946 --> 00:22:32.366 A:middle
and the leftmost stack
represents all the different

00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.896 A:middle
device sizes that
Apple currently ships.

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:37.066 A:middle
So we have the largest
iPad on the left

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.496 A:middle
and the smallest
iPhone on the right.

00:22:39.876 --> 00:22:42.186 A:middle
And next to that is
a stack of buttons

00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:44.126 A:middle
that lets you select the
orientation that you want

00:22:44.126 --> 00:22:44.896 A:middle
to view the scenes in.

00:22:45.236 --> 00:22:46.196 A:middle
So I'm going to do
that right now.

00:22:46.196 --> 00:22:48.276 A:middle
I'm going to switch
to landscape.

00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:50.506 A:middle
So right in the design canvas
you can cycle through all

00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:52.826 A:middle
of these devices
and all orientations

00:22:52.826 --> 00:22:55.506 A:middle
and see how your content
is going to be laid out

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:56.636 A:middle
and rendered, which
is really cool.

00:22:57.906 --> 00:22:58.226 A:middle
Thank you.

00:23:00.436 --> 00:23:04.006 A:middle
So iPhones are interesting
of course,

00:23:04.006 --> 00:23:06.216 A:middle
but iPads are even
more interesting.

00:23:06.216 --> 00:23:07.306 A:middle
I'm going to select
one right now

00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:09.876 A:middle
and you can see what happened
is there's actually another set

00:23:09.876 --> 00:23:12.626 A:middle
of icons that appeared and
this represents adaptation.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.746 A:middle
So for iPhone there's
just one adaptation

00:23:14.846 --> 00:23:16.756 A:middle
for each orientation,
that's full screen.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:20.096 A:middle
For iPad it's more
interesting because your app --

00:23:20.506 --> 00:23:22.176 A:middle
your users can choose
to run your app

00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:23.666 A:middle
in slide over or split view.

00:23:24.126 --> 00:23:25.586 A:middle
So that's what these
adaptations are here.

00:23:25.726 --> 00:23:29.446 A:middle
So if I select this one you can
see that the scene now renders

00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:32.216 A:middle
as the app would if
your user was running it

00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:33.526 A:middle
in slide over on iPad.

00:23:34.036 --> 00:23:36.526 A:middle
So think about this right in
the design canvas you can cycle

00:23:36.526 --> 00:23:38.406 A:middle
through all of these
configurations,

00:23:38.706 --> 00:23:40.596 A:middle
all these orientations,
all these devices

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:42.866 A:middle
and see how your content
is going to get laid out.

00:23:42.866 --> 00:23:44.696 A:middle
I mean, this is a really
powerful new workflow,

00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:46.976 A:middle
it's going to save
you a lot of time.

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:51.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:53.706 A:middle
Okay, so those are some
of the new features

00:23:53.706 --> 00:23:55.076 A:middle
in Interface Builder in Xcode 8.

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:57.976 A:middle
Now let's get down to the task
of actually building this view.

00:23:58.536 --> 00:24:00.036 A:middle
So here's what we're
going to do first.

00:23:58.536 --> 00:24:00.036 A:middle
So here's what we're
going to do first.

00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:02.006 A:middle
We're going to add this label
and we're going to add it

00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:05.206 A:middle
in such a way that it applies
to all device configurations.

00:24:05.306 --> 00:24:07.426 A:middle
This is probably
something you do most

00:24:07.426 --> 00:24:08.706 A:middle
of the time in Interface
Builder.

00:24:09.236 --> 00:24:11.236 A:middle
You're usually not making
customizations based

00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:13.106 A:middle
on size classes a lot.

00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:14.826 A:middle
So let's do this right now.

00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:19.276 A:middle
So I have the Device
Configuration bar

00:24:19.386 --> 00:24:20.566 A:middle
and iPads selected there,

00:24:20.566 --> 00:24:23.146 A:middle
it doesn't really matter what's
selected because what I'm going

00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:25.336 A:middle
to do is going to
apply to everything.

00:24:26.096 --> 00:24:27.456 A:middle
So I found a label

00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:30.236 A:middle
in the Interface Builder
library, I will drag it out.

00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.106 A:middle
And now what I'm
going to do I'm going

00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:33.516 A:middle
to add some Auto
Layout constraints.

00:24:33.896 --> 00:24:38.156 A:middle
And as Kevin said, this is one
of the systems that we provide

00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:41.736 A:middle
that actually makes
your UIs adapt

00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:43.366 A:middle
to all different
device configurations.

00:24:43.366 --> 00:24:45.136 A:middle
So I'm going to add
some constraints.

00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:50.186 A:middle
I'm going to pin this to
the top as vertical spacing.

00:24:50.606 --> 00:24:53.046 A:middle
I'm going to center it
horizontally in the container

00:24:53.446 --> 00:24:55.776 A:middle
and I'm going to add a vertical
spacing constraint between it

00:24:56.206 --> 00:24:58.766 A:middle
and the image view
below vertical spacing.

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:01.646 A:middle
And I've got some
content I will paste in

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:01.646 A:middle
And I've got some
content I will paste in

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:03.686 A:middle
and it looks like that's right.

00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:07.106 A:middle
And I had a constraint
between this image view

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:09.056 A:middle
and the top layout guide,
which I don't need any more

00:25:09.136 --> 00:25:12.326 A:middle
because I've added a label,
so I'll delete that now.

00:25:13.076 --> 00:25:14.816 A:middle
So how do I know that
I did everything right

00:25:14.816 --> 00:25:15.856 A:middle
and added the right constraints?

00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:17.706 A:middle
Well this is where the Device
Configuration bar comes

00:25:17.706 --> 00:25:19.156 A:middle
in because it's really easy

00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:21.096 A:middle
to see what it looks
like on iPhone.

00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:23.156 A:middle
And you can see that it's
staying in the right place

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:26.226 A:middle
as I cycle through all
these devices and even

00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:28.006 A:middle
through different
orientations okay.

00:25:28.436 --> 00:25:30.956 A:middle
So that's an operation
you do very commonly

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:34.376 A:middle
in Interface Builder
every day, very easy.

00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:37.266 A:middle
So now let's start
adding some adaptivity,

00:25:37.266 --> 00:25:39.976 A:middle
some customizations using
the free collection system.

00:25:40.696 --> 00:25:41.526 A:middle
So what are we going to do now?

00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:43.606 A:middle
We're going to change the label,

00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:45.636 A:middle
the font of this
top label up here.

00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:47.776 A:middle
And you see my designer
really wants it

00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:50.706 A:middle
to be System Semibold
36 just for iPads.

00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:53.046 A:middle
So let's go back
to the storyboard.

00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:56.986 A:middle
So when you think about
adding customizations

00:25:57.106 --> 00:25:58.836 A:middle
for a device you
really want to think

00:25:58.836 --> 00:26:02.576 A:middle
about adding a customization for
a particular trait collection

00:25:58.836 --> 00:26:02.576 A:middle
about adding a customization for
a particular trait collection

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:04.086 A:middle
or in this case a size class.

00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:08.166 A:middle
So we're all given designs for
devices for iPads and iPhones,

00:26:08.586 --> 00:26:11.286 A:middle
but as developers you need
to be able to translate

00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:13.916 A:middle
that into size class that
you're meaning to target.

00:26:14.236 --> 00:26:15.266 A:middle
We make that really
easy for you.

00:26:15.466 --> 00:26:19.536 A:middle
So for example, I have an iPad
selected in the Device bar

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:22.806 A:middle
and the size class and I'll zoom
in here so you can see that,

00:26:23.606 --> 00:26:26.016 A:middle
it now says regular
width, regular height.

00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:27.266 A:middle
Okay, so you don't need to guess

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:29.686 A:middle
about what size class a
particular device configuration

00:26:29.686 --> 00:26:32.386 A:middle
is you just select that
configuration in the Device bar

00:26:32.386 --> 00:26:34.206 A:middle
and Interface Builder
will tell you what it is.

00:26:34.206 --> 00:26:35.886 A:middle
And that's another great
improvement we think.

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:39.956 A:middle
So now let's introduce,

00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:43.756 A:middle
let's vary how this label
looks just for that size class.

00:26:44.576 --> 00:26:47.556 A:middle
So I'll select it in
the canvas and let's go

00:26:47.626 --> 00:26:48.836 A:middle
over to the Attributes
Inspector,

00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:50.256 A:middle
which I actually have
selected already.

00:26:50.326 --> 00:26:52.026 A:middle
And I'm going to
zoom in here again

00:26:52.066 --> 00:26:54.406 A:middle
so you can get a closer
look at the inspector.

00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:59.646 A:middle
So you might see out there that
a couple of these attributes,

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:02.396 A:middle
that is a big cursor, have
a + button next to them.

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:02.396 A:middle
that is a big cursor, have
a + button next to them.

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:04.336 A:middle
And so the + button means

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:07.576 A:middle
that particular attribute can
be customized using the trait

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:08.446 A:middle
collection system.

00:27:09.306 --> 00:27:10.156 A:middle
So let's do that right now.

00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:12.196 A:middle
I want to change the
font so I click it.

00:27:12.196 --> 00:27:14.516 A:middle
And the menu comes up
here is offering me

00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:15.706 A:middle
to add a customization

00:27:15.836 --> 00:27:17.616 A:middle
for regular width
and regular height.

00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:19.066 A:middle
Well why is it doing that?

00:27:19.386 --> 00:27:21.626 A:middle
Well it's because I
have a regular width,

00:27:21.796 --> 00:27:23.936 A:middle
regular height device
configuration selected,

00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:24.726 A:middle
so that makes sense.

00:27:25.906 --> 00:27:28.556 A:middle
So we'll do that
and what happens is

00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:31.196 A:middle
that the Attributes Inspector
now shows me another row

00:27:31.196 --> 00:27:31.656 A:middle
for font.

00:27:32.116 --> 00:27:33.656 A:middle
And again, it has
that same notation

00:27:34.066 --> 00:27:37.416 A:middle
in the Attributes Inspector
as I see in the Device bar.

00:27:37.566 --> 00:27:39.316 A:middle
Okay, so that's why
it's so important

00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:41.356 A:middle
that what's here is you
understand what's going on.

00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:47.806 A:middle
Okay, so let's make the change,
I'll bring up the Font Editor,

00:27:48.016 --> 00:27:51.276 A:middle
I'll select Semibold and since I
always do what my designers want

00:27:51.276 --> 00:27:52.546 A:middle
me to do 36.

00:27:53.096 --> 00:27:55.096 A:middle
There we go and I'll click Done.

00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
And you can see it rendered
and updated on the canvas.

00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
If I select an iPhone what I
would expect to happen happened,

00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
If I select an iPhone what I
would expect to happen happened,

00:28:02.596 --> 00:28:04.586 A:middle
the font remains what
it was before the change

00:28:04.676 --> 00:28:07.836 A:middle
because I only targeted regular
width, regular height devices

00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:09.136 A:middle
for that particular edit.

00:28:09.846 --> 00:28:12.866 A:middle
Okay, so that's an example of
using the Attributes Inspector

00:28:12.866 --> 00:28:15.756 A:middle
to add a customization
based on size class.

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:17.456 A:middle
So that's the first
customization.

00:28:18.116 --> 00:28:22.696 A:middle
Let's add another one and this
time I want to add this label

00:28:22.696 --> 00:28:24.776 A:middle
and I want to do it
again just for iPad.

00:28:25.276 --> 00:28:28.136 A:middle
So I'll go back to the
storyboard and because I want

00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:28.966 A:middle
to add this customization

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:30.766 A:middle
for iPad I should select
it in the Device bar.

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:35.086 A:middle
And let me draw your attention
to this button in the Device bar

00:28:35.086 --> 00:28:36.626 A:middle
that says Vary for
Traits down here.

00:28:37.446 --> 00:28:40.146 A:middle
So when you click this button
it's going to present a popover

00:28:40.146 --> 00:28:43.536 A:middle
and ask you how we want
to introduce the traits,

00:28:43.536 --> 00:28:46.346 A:middle
what kind of traits, the trait
collection you want to target.

00:28:47.206 --> 00:28:48.126 A:middle
So what does this mean?

00:28:48.456 --> 00:28:49.556 A:middle
Well I have a regular width,

00:28:49.776 --> 00:28:54.966 A:middle
regular height size class device
configuration and I can choose

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.746 A:middle
to customize for regular
width, regular height

00:28:56.746 --> 00:28:58.716 A:middle
if I hit click both
of these checkboxes.

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
But I also can choose to
customize just for regular width

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
But I also can choose to
customize just for regular width

00:29:02.496 --> 00:29:06.096 A:middle
and any height or for any
height and regular width okay.

00:29:06.696 --> 00:29:10.316 A:middle
So I think what I want is to
customize just for regular width

00:29:10.786 --> 00:29:13.316 A:middle
and when I do that the bar
turns this lovely shade of blue

00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:14.256 A:middle
to tell me that I'm going

00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:17.496 A:middle
to be making customizations
based on size class.

00:29:18.016 --> 00:29:21.116 A:middle
Let's take a closer look
at the contents of the bar.

00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:22.736 A:middle
I'll zoom in here.

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:27.356 A:middle
So you can see it says I'm
varying eight regular width

00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:29.446 A:middle
devices, the device
configurations.

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:33.296 A:middle
I see iPads both in portrait
and in landscape and in a couple

00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:37.136 A:middle
of the slide over configurations
and that makes sense.

00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:39.916 A:middle
But I also see an iPhone here,
so what's that all about?

00:29:40.356 --> 00:29:41.546 A:middle
Well if I put the mouse cursor

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:45.046 A:middle
over this I see this is an
iPhone 6s Plus in landscape

00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:46.476 A:middle
and as Kevin said,
because this device is

00:29:46.476 --> 00:29:49.616 A:middle
so big it actually uses the
regular width size class

00:29:49.666 --> 00:29:50.296 A:middle
in landscape.

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:53.186 A:middle
And this is great and you'll
frequently want to make

00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:56.586 A:middle
and provide a different
experience for that device

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:57.466 A:middle
in that configuration,

00:29:57.636 --> 00:29:58.976 A:middle
but in this case I
don't want to do that.

00:29:58.976 --> 00:30:01.486 A:middle
I only want to make the
customization for iPad.

00:29:58.976 --> 00:30:01.486 A:middle
I only want to make the
customization for iPad.

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:02.776 A:middle
So what do I do?

00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:04.676 A:middle
Well I can go back into
the Vary for Traits

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.866 A:middle
and this time I'm going to
vary for both regular width

00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:09.846 A:middle
and regular height and
when I do that notice

00:30:09.896 --> 00:30:12.176 A:middle
that the iPhone disappears
from the bar.

00:30:12.876 --> 00:30:15.106 A:middle
So the edits I'm about
to make will only apply

00:30:15.336 --> 00:30:17.736 A:middle
to these particular
configurations okay.

00:30:18.096 --> 00:30:20.336 A:middle
So let's do that now.

00:30:20.336 --> 00:30:23.996 A:middle
I'm going to drag out a label,
I'm going to put it right there

00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:27.366 A:middle
and I'll add just a
few constraints here

00:30:27.366 --> 00:30:30.926 A:middle
to make sure it stays in the
right place, there we go.

00:30:30.926 --> 00:30:32.506 A:middle
Now I'll click Done Varying.

00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:34.846 A:middle
So let's go back to the
Attributes Inspector

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:37.586 A:middle
because I want to focus
on a couple of checkboxes

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:38.856 A:middle
that you've maybe seen before,

00:30:39.186 --> 00:30:41.216 A:middle
I want to make sure you
understand what this is

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:41.606 A:middle
all about.

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:45.966 A:middle
So I varied for traits, I
selected width and height,

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:49.076 A:middle
which means I configured the
bar to make a customization

00:30:49.076 --> 00:30:50.326 A:middle
for regular width,
regular height.

00:30:50.776 --> 00:30:53.406 A:middle
And so when I did that
I dragged out a view,

00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:56.566 A:middle
I added it to a view hierarchy,
but it only installed it

00:30:56.806 --> 00:30:59.256 A:middle
for regular width
and regular height.

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:01.416 A:middle
So that's what this
checkbox shows me right here.

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:01.416 A:middle
So that's what this
checkbox shows me right here.

00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.906 A:middle
Most of the time
when you add views

00:31:04.026 --> 00:31:06.376 A:middle
to your scene they'll be
installed for everything,

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:08.766 A:middle
so they'll appear on all device
configurations regardless

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:09.596 A:middle
of the size class.

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:13.456 A:middle
But when I'm in this mode when
the bar is blue when I add views

00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:15.816 A:middle
or when I add Auto Layout
constraints they will get

00:31:15.816 --> 00:31:18.256 A:middle
installed only for the
particular size class

00:31:18.256 --> 00:31:20.046 A:middle
that I'm targeting
for the edit okay.

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.896 A:middle
So that's important
to understand.

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:25.316 A:middle
So again, to prove
this it can cycle

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.696 A:middle
through iPhones using the
Device Configuration bar

00:31:27.766 --> 00:31:28.746 A:middle
and the label isn't there.

00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:31.896 A:middle
So I did the right thing I added
this view and it only appears

00:31:31.896 --> 00:31:35.106 A:middle
for regular width, regular
height devices okay.

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:39.346 A:middle
So the next thing we're
going to do is we're going

00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:42.346 A:middle
to make a more surgical
edit using the Device bar.

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:45.396 A:middle
And as you can see when I cycle

00:31:45.396 --> 00:31:48.586 A:middle
through to an iPhone
there's too much space

00:31:48.586 --> 00:31:50.956 A:middle
between the top label here
and the imagine view below.

00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:52.416 A:middle
Now in fact if I go back

00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.626 A:middle
to the design my designer
wants them to be pretty tight.

00:31:55.506 --> 00:31:56.526 A:middle
So how do I do that?

00:31:56.646 --> 00:31:58.746 A:middle
Well what's really cool is

00:31:58.746 --> 00:32:01.796 A:middle
that you can actually customize
an Auto Layout constraint

00:31:58.746 --> 00:32:01.796 A:middle
that you can actually customize
an Auto Layout constraint

00:32:01.936 --> 00:32:05.806 A:middle
constant using a variation
like we've been doing

00:32:06.096 --> 00:32:07.706 A:middle
by targeting a size class.

00:32:08.466 --> 00:32:09.426 A:middle
So let's do that right now.

00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:11.216 A:middle
So you can see if I
select the image view,

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.686 A:middle
remember I added this
vertical spacing constraint

00:32:14.686 --> 00:32:19.726 A:middle
between it and there we go.

00:32:20.186 --> 00:32:23.186 A:middle
Okay, so I've clicked
this constraint

00:32:23.186 --> 00:32:25.576 A:middle
and I see this Auto Layout
constraint and I see a bunch

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:26.426 A:middle
of its attributes here.

00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:29.226 A:middle
You can see the constant
value is 61.

00:32:29.226 --> 00:32:31.176 A:middle
So this is the problem
this value is too big.

00:32:31.726 --> 00:32:34.116 A:middle
Well I can actually edit
this and I can edit it only

00:32:34.116 --> 00:32:35.756 A:middle
for iPhones for compact

00:32:35.756 --> 00:32:37.406 A:middle
with regular height
devices in portrait.

00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:40.866 A:middle
Again, I can click Vary for
Traits, I'll customize on width

00:32:41.236 --> 00:32:43.766 A:middle
and on height and you
can see the contents

00:32:43.766 --> 00:32:47.226 A:middle
of the bar show me iPhones.

00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:51.036 A:middle
But what are all these iPad
configurations in here?

00:32:51.286 --> 00:32:54.926 A:middle
Well remember when your user
is using the iPad in slide over

00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:57.256 A:middle
or split view there's
not that much space.

00:32:57.256 --> 00:32:58.946 A:middle
Your app will be
spaced constrained.

00:32:58.946 --> 00:33:01.236 A:middle
So you really want to
provide an iPhone experience

00:32:58.946 --> 00:33:01.236 A:middle
So you really want to
provide an iPhone experience

00:33:01.236 --> 00:33:02.396 A:middle
on iPad in that case.

00:33:02.796 --> 00:33:05.496 A:middle
So this actually makes sense
all of these iPad configurations

00:33:05.496 --> 00:33:08.346 A:middle
that you see here
are also compact

00:33:08.346 --> 00:33:09.816 A:middle
with regular height
configurations.

00:33:09.816 --> 00:33:11.356 A:middle
So this is good, this
is what I want to do.

00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:15.186 A:middle
Okay, so I've gone into Vary
for Traits, the bar is blue

00:33:15.186 --> 00:33:18.000 A:middle
and now I can select
this constraint again.

00:33:23.056 --> 00:33:23.556 A:middle
There we go.

00:33:23.556 --> 00:33:27.956 A:middle
Now notice I'm going to
change this value to say 45

00:33:27.956 --> 00:33:29.366 A:middle
and I'm going to draw
your attention back

00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:30.806 A:middle
to the Attributes Inspector.

00:33:31.106 --> 00:33:33.596 A:middle
So what happens when I
commit this edit just

00:33:33.596 --> 00:33:34.936 A:middle
like what happened
when we customize

00:33:34.936 --> 00:33:38.736 A:middle
for font Interface Builder added
another row for constant right.

00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:41.726 A:middle
And you can see this is
using the same size class

00:33:41.756 --> 00:33:43.026 A:middle
that I configured in the bar.

00:33:43.516 --> 00:33:45.586 A:middle
So I've changed this --

00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:48.376 A:middle
I've added a customization
for this constraint constant

00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:53.166 A:middle
by starting an editing
session with the Device bar,

00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:55.366 A:middle
but I'm making the edit
directly in the canvas okay.

00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:56.926 A:middle
So that's really cool.

00:33:57.436 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
And as I cycle through these
devices it looks pretty good,

00:33:57.436 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
And as I cycle through these
devices it looks pretty good,

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:02.266 A:middle
but it's still not
quite close enough.

00:34:02.856 --> 00:34:03.836 A:middle
So how do I fix this?

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:08.045 A:middle
Well you might think that I need
to go back and make the bar blue

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.406 A:middle
and try to make the
edit that way.

00:34:09.876 --> 00:34:11.386 A:middle
And that's not quite
the right thing to do.

00:34:11.766 --> 00:34:13.356 A:middle
So what's important
to understand is

00:34:13.356 --> 00:34:16.196 A:middle
when you're varying for traits
you're introducing variations

00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:17.366 A:middle
based on size class.

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:19.795 A:middle
But you don't use this
workflow for editing them.

00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:23.146 A:middle
Instead, wouldn't it be nice
if you could just directly edit

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.856 A:middle
that customization in
the canvas, well you can.

00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:30.186 A:middle
So I have an iPhone selected
Interface Builder knows that,

00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:33.516 A:middle
it also knows that I have
a customization for that.

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:37.176 A:middle
So now when I go to edit
this it's going to figure

00:34:37.176 --> 00:34:38.266 A:middle
out where I want the data to go.

00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:41.866 A:middle
So if I changed 45 to 30
again, notice what happens

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:44.456 A:middle
in the Attributes Inspector
it's going to update it

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:47.036 A:middle
for the size class because it
knows I have a customization

00:34:47.196 --> 00:34:47.786 A:middle
based on that.

00:34:48.306 --> 00:34:50.485 A:middle
So we think this is a really
powerful new workflow.

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.846 A:middle
It lets you introduce
variations using the Device bar,

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:54.806 A:middle
but then you can
continue to edit those

00:34:54.806 --> 00:34:56.156 A:middle
in the design canvas directly.

00:34:56.156 --> 00:34:59.136 A:middle
And with that I want to
bring it back to Kevin.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:04.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:07.136 --> 00:35:07.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Brent.

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:08.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:35:09.606 --> 00:35:11.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I just wanted to
recap a few of the things

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:14.716 A:middle
that Brent had talked
about in his demo.

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:17.606 A:middle
So first we introduced the
new Device Configuration bar

00:35:17.606 --> 00:35:19.926 A:middle
where you can see
these concrete devices

00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:22.856 A:middle
and you can see your application
in them and move through them.

00:35:23.346 --> 00:35:26.126 A:middle
We also have a new workflow
for introducing customizations

00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:27.706 A:middle
between the different traits.

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:31.146 A:middle
So you can do very surgical
fine grain edits using the

00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:32.136 A:middle
Attitudes Inspector.

00:35:32.566 --> 00:35:34.196 A:middle
And the Attributes
Inspector is also the

00:35:34.196 --> 00:35:36.756 A:middle
where you can see all the
changes that you've made.

00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:39.486 A:middle
So if you're ever questioning
I wonder how I set this up,

00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:40.626 A:middle
you can always go
to the inspector

00:35:40.626 --> 00:35:42.816 A:middle
to see what the customizations
you made are.

00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:45.236 A:middle
But there's also this
Vary for Traits mode

00:35:45.236 --> 00:35:47.686 A:middle
where you can do kind of
larger broad paint stroke

00:35:47.686 --> 00:35:48.656 A:middle
style changes.

00:35:49.226 --> 00:35:51.266 A:middle
And as Brett mentioned,
it's really important

00:35:51.266 --> 00:35:52.416 A:middle
to note this mode is important

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.806 A:middle
for introducing new
customizations.

00:35:55.436 --> 00:35:58.206 A:middle
Once you've exited this mode
Interface Builder will still

00:35:58.206 --> 00:36:00.696 A:middle
know how to update
those customizations

00:35:58.206 --> 00:36:00.696 A:middle
know how to update
those customizations

00:36:00.696 --> 00:36:03.236 A:middle
that you've made
based on the device

00:36:03.236 --> 00:36:04.646 A:middle
that you're currently looking at

00:36:04.646 --> 00:36:06.196 A:middle
and it works really
well, it's awesome.

00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:09.506 A:middle
Now these changes
work not only for iOS,

00:36:09.826 --> 00:36:14.096 A:middle
but these workflow changes
also apply to tvOS and watchOS

00:36:14.096 --> 00:36:15.286 A:middle
as well in Interface Builder.

00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:19.496 A:middle
So just in summary
one more time.

00:36:19.836 --> 00:36:21.466 A:middle
So I talked about
the fundamentals

00:36:21.466 --> 00:36:22.156 A:middle
of the trait system.

00:36:22.156 --> 00:36:24.526 A:middle
We talked about how traits
describe the environment,

00:36:24.866 --> 00:36:27.226 A:middle
how you're going to override
traitCollectionDidChange

00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:29.306 A:middle
to do all your adaptivity
taking advantage

00:36:29.306 --> 00:36:30.806 A:middle
of the systems that
do it for you.

00:36:31.366 --> 00:36:32.546 A:middle
And that size classes

00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:36.466 A:middle
that describe the experience how
you're displaying information.

00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:39.886 A:middle
Brett gave you a demo of the
new workflows and the tools

00:36:39.886 --> 00:36:41.496 A:middle
and how Interface
Builder now allows you

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
to both see your interface

00:36:44.886 --> 00:36:48.486 A:middle
in concrete devices while
simultaneously being able

00:36:48.486 --> 00:36:50.986 A:middle
to edit all the underlying
data for the trait collections

00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:52.436 A:middle
and the traits that you want

00:36:52.436 --> 00:36:53.796 A:middle
to make your application
adapt over.

00:36:54.876 --> 00:36:59.336 A:middle
So this was part 1 and again,
the big takeaway with part 1 is

00:36:59.336 --> 00:37:02.216 A:middle
